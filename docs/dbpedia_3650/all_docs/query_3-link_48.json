        "text": "LEARNING HISTORY through STORY: MG/YA HISTORICAL FICTION NOVELS\n\nOne of the most effective ways to learn about any historical event, and the nuances and effects of those events, is through novel study—the power of story. Every historical event is distinct and affects people and places uniquely—and each is surrounded by misconceptions, misunderstandings, miscommunications, and differing and shifting perspectives. We may learn about history through textbooks and lectures, but we experience history through novels. And when we live it, we learn it; we do not merely learn about it. We discern the complex issues, and we feel empathy for all affected. We bear witness to the events we read and the plights of the people affected by those events.\n\nI continue to read, and learn from, some amazing novels which can be read as whole-class, book club, or individual texts to learn more about history in English, Language Arts, and Social Studies classes. A suggestion for Social Studies classes would be for Book Clubs to each read a novel from a time period or location studied in class so that groups can present “their” historic event to the class and the class can compare and contrast the novels, the events, and the discerned effects of these events on the characters.\n\nBelow are reviews of 70 of my more-recently-read historical fiction including a separate section below for Novels, Memoirs, and Graphics about the Events of Nine Eleven.\n\nA Night Divided by Jennifer A. Nielsen\n\nI remember when the Berlin Wall came down, but I did not really understand the story of its building and how it affected those on either side until reading A Night Divided.\n\nIn 1961 Germany—Russia controlled the East; Britain, US and France controlled the West. Gerta, her brother Fritz, and their mother live in East Berlin. Papa and brother Dominic had gone on a short trip to the West. On August 13 the wall went up—overnight—and one family, as were many, was divided. Twelve-year-old Gerta longed for her family and for freedom and a future.\n\n“It wasn’t things I longed for…. I wanted books that weren’t censored.…I wanted a home without hidden microphones, and friends and neighbors I could talk to without wondering if they would report me to the secret police. And I wanted control over my own life, the chance to succeed” (125).\n\nOne day Gerta sees Dominic and father on the other side and interprets their message to dig a tunnel under the Death Strip to the West. Bravely, she and her brother Fritz risk everything—their friendships and even their lives—to try to reach safety and reunite their family.\n\nA Night Divided is a narrative of events in history, but it is also a story of family and the bravery of even adolescents.\n\n-----\n\nAbove the Rim: How Elgin Baylor Changed Basketball by Jen F. Bryant\n\n“In one smooth move, like a plane taking off,\n\nHe leaped…\n\nHigher and higher and higher--\n\nAs if pulled by some invisible wire,\n\nAnd just when it seemed he’d have to come down,\n\nNo!\n\nHe’d HANG there, suspended, floating like a bird or a cloud,\n\nChanging direction, shifting the ball to the other side,\n\nTwisting in midair, slashing, crashing,\n\nGliding past the defense, up—up—above the rim.”\n\nAbove the Rim is the story of NBA player Elgin Baylor and how he changed basketball, but it is also the story of Civil Rights in the United States and how Elgin contributed to that movement.\n\nReaders follow Elgin from age 14 when he began playing basketball “in a field down the street” to college ball at the College of Idaho to becoming the #1 draft pick for the Minneapolis Lakers (later the LA Lakers) to being named 1959 NBA Rookie of the Year. At the same time readers follow the peaceful protests of Rosa Parks, the Little Rock Nine, and the African American college students sitting at the “whites only” Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, NC.\n\nIn his first season Baylor sat out a game to protest the hotel and restaurants serving “whites only,” leading the NBA commissioner to make an anti-discrimination rule. “Elgin had already changed the way basketball was played. Now by sitting down and NOT playing, he helped change things off court.”\n\n“Artists [such as Baylor,] change how we see things, how we perceive human limits, and how we define ourselves and our culture.” (Author’s Note)\n\nThis picture book, exquisitely illustrated by Frank Morrison, belongs in every classroom and home library for readers of all ages. Lyrically written in free verse by Jen Bryant, it would serve as a mentor text for many writing focus lessons:\n\nrepetition, free verse, and rhyming lines for musicality\n\ntechnical language (jargon), i.e., hanging jumper, spin-shot, backboard\n\nactive verbs, i.e., gliding, shifting, floating, twisted, reverse dunked\n\nFigurative language, i.e., floating like a bird or a cloud\n\nSensory details, i.e., steamy summer day, padlocked fences, clickety-clack trains, flick of his wrist, beds that were too short, cold food\n\nFollowing the story, the author provides a lengthy Author’s Note about Baylor, a bibliography of Further Reading, and a 1934-2018 Timeline of Elgin’s life, black athletes, and Civil Rights highlights.\n\n-----\n\nAcross So Many Seas by Ruth Behar\n\n“I feel like I carry a lot of history on my shoulders. Not only were my ancestors driven out of Spain, but my abuela had to leave Turkey, and my parents had to leave Cuba. So many seas were crossed.”—Paloma, 2003 (ARC 201)\n\nThere are numerous parts of history that we do not learn—or at least I didn’t learn until I visited foreign lands through travel and novels. There are many reasons why people emigrate to other lands—sometimes it is political; other times the catalyst is religious persecution; and sometimes the cause is being sent away by family members—and sometimes we cross the sea to discover our ancestral homeland. The characters in Ruth Behar’s new novel who travel across so many seas do so for many of these reasons.\n\nThe family saga begins in 1492 in Toledo formerly “known as the city of three cultures [where] Jews, Muslims, and Christians lived together peacefully for centuries.” (ARC 212). However, the Spanish Inquisition first persecuted the Muslims, turning mosques into cathedrals, and then the Jews who are threatened with the choice of conversion or hanging. Benvenida, her two brothers, and her parents are forced to leave Toledo and walk for days to the coast, carrying a few possessions and the Torah scrolls, where, on the last possible day, they sail to join family in Naples; her father dies on the way. When they hear of cruelties being inflicted upon Jewish immigrants, the entire family leaves for Constantinople. “Can it be that at last we’ve arrived at a place where all kinds of people—Muslims, Christians, Jews—are allowed to live together side by side? And live peacefully?” (ARC 67)\n\nIn Part Two we meet Benvenida’s descendant Reina, who in 1923 longs for freedoms that are prohibited because she is a girl. When she attends a firework display celebrating Turkey’s independence with a male neighbor and sings to the other teens who are all boys, her father banishes her to Cuba to an aunt and an arranged marriage. “He has done what he needed to do. It has been very difficult for him.…he weeps for you as he has wept for the ancestors who fled Spain during the expulsion.” (ARC 97)\n\nThe story continues in 1963 in Fidel Castro’s Cuba with Reina’s youngest daughter Alegra who, along with her Muslim neighbor Teresita, volunteers to become a brigadista and teach people in the countryside to read and write. “I am so thankful for my freedom. And that I am able to fight for a cause I believe in.” (ARC 150) The family is politically divided, and people are leaving the country. Reina’s older children and their families leave for Israel and, after two weeks in jail, Alegra’s father brings her home and sends her to Miami, supported by the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. There she lives with foster parents for three years until her parents join her.\n\nAnd last, in 2003 readers meet Alegra’s daughter Paloma, Sephardic-Cuban on mother’s side and Afro-Cuban on her father’s side. On a business trip the family visits Toledo and meets some surprising people, bringing the story full circle.\n\nThis is a story of history, prejudices and persecution, emigration, religion and Jewish tradition, freedoms, language, and four 12-year-old girls who come alive through poetry and song.\n\n-----\n\nAllies by Alan Gratz\n\nThe Battle of Normandy, codenamed Operation Overlord, began on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day, when some 156,000 American, British and Canadian forces landed on five beaches along a 50-mile stretch of the heavily fortified coast of France’s Normandy region. The invasion was one of the largest amphibious military assaults in history and resulted in the Allied liberation of Western Europe from Nazi Germany’s control (www.History.com).\n\nIn Gratz’s new novel Allies, readers learn about the invasion on D-Day from multiple perspectives.\n\nFirst, readers meet Dee Carpenter, a soldier from Philadelphia with a secret; his real name is Dietrich Zimmerman and he was born in Germany, his family having fled the Nazis. His best friend Sid is Jewish. Eleven-year-old Samira is French Algerian, and after her mother, a member of the French Resistance, is captured, she joins the Marquis (resistance codename) to find and free her mother. Unfortunately, as one of my favorite characters, she doesn’t reappear until the end of the book. James and his friend Sam, a Cree Indian, are members of the Canadian army, and Bill and Thomas are soldiers from England.\n\nReaders last meet the black medic Henry who calms his patients by asking about their favorite movies and is faced with discrimination even as he saves lives. When he saves the white southern officer Lieutenant Hoyte, the man who had delivered discrimination with “the vilest of racial slurs,” and Hoyte says, “Thank you, corporal…You saved my life,” Henry thinks, “Maybe, just maybe, this was a beginning. Maybe serving together, fighting together, living and suffering together, would make white people see black people as equals.” (194)\n\nLast, readers meet Dorothy, the American reporter disguised as a man so she can cover the battle, and the 13-year-old French Monique, who has an interest in first aid. Together they help save soldiers in the field, Monique soothing them with her singing.\n\nAs soldiers storm the beaches and parachute from airplanes, the fighting is described in great detail. “James had seen what happens when IF Day became WHEN Day. ‘Nobody should have to live like this, under the boot of Nazi rule, anywhere in the world,' James thought.” (132)\n\nThis novel would appeal to those who are interested in history, battles, artillery, and strategy. It would be a good choice for an author-study, historical-fiction book club, grouped with Gratz's Grenade, Refugee, Projeckt 1065, and Prisoner B-3087 in ELA or History/Social Studies classes.\n\n-----\n\nAn Uninterrupted View of the Sky by Melanie Crowder\n\nIn a novel I read straight though, I again learned from Crowder, author of Audacity [see above]. An Uninterrupted View of the Sky takes place in Bolivia at the beginning of the 21st century and reveals how the United States’ role in the passage and enforcement of a law that violated the rights of citizens, especially the poor and indigenous peoples, led to innocent families living in prisons for years, hoping for the reform that has been slowly occurring. “Our lives are stretching out before us, unplanned and unpredictable” (p. 277).\n\nReaders meet Francisco and his little sister Pilar and Francisco’s classmate and new friend Soledad, who become a part Bolivia’s prison children population. As they struggle to survive the violence of prison life and the streets and loss of family, they realize that education can help them make a change.\n\n​\n\nSuggestion: Pair with Deborah Ellis” I Am a Taxi, also about those who become caught in the Bolivian government’s war on drugs.\n\n-----\n\nAudacity by Melanie Crowder\n\nAudacity has become one of my all-time favorites historical novels and some of the best writing I have read. I usually choose books about more contemporary issues but am finding the same issues appearing throughout history, wearing different masks. Unfortunately oppression, intolerance, and treatment of refugees are not past, and we still need people unafraid to stand for their own rights and those of others.\n\nAudacity relates the true story of Clara Lemlich, a Russian Jewish immigrant with dreams of an education who sacrifices everything to fight for better working conditions for women in the factories of Manhattan's Lower East Side in the early 1900's. Lyrically related in verse, the use of parallelism and the purposeful placement of the words is as effective as the words themselves.\n\nThe novel includes the history behind the story and a glossary of terms. What a wonderful \"text\" for a social studies class.\n\n-----\n\nEverything Sad Is Untrue by Daniel Nayeri\n\nYears ago I heard Tim O’Brien, author of The Things They Carried, tell an audience, “You don’t have to tell a true story to tell the truth.” When I facilitate memoir workshops, I advise writers that memoir is how the memoirist remembers and interprets events.\n\nEverything Sad is Untrue is the story of Khosrou Nayeri on his way to becoming Daniel Nayeri. It is the stories of his childhood in Iran, in Dubai, in a refugee “camp” in Italy, in his relocation home in Oklahoma; it is also the stories of the Persian and Iranian people and history. It is a recounting that flits from time to time and person to person and place to place, inviting readers to participate as we form a relationship with the storyteller.\n\nThis is a collection of stories reminiscent of 1001 Arabian Nights. In fact, Daniel frequently compares himself to Scheherazade, telling readers, “Every story is the sound of a storyteller begging to stay alive.” (59) The author further explains that, in his case, “You don’t get to choose what you remember. A patchwork memory is the shame of a refugee.” (49) and later explains, “Memories are just stories we tell ourselves, after all. (349)\n\nEverything Sad is Untrue reminds me of my favorite children’s book Haroun and the Sea of Stories in which Salman Rushdie proves “the use of stories that aren’t even true,” a novel that likewise blends Eastern and Western cultures.\n\nBut the most important feature of this wonderful novel is the author’s voice which comes through on every page. As our storyteller discloses, “The point of Nights is that if you spend time with each other—if we really listen in the parlors of our minds and look at each other as we were meant to be seen—then we would fall in love.…The stories aren’t the thing. The thing is the story of the story. The spending of the time. The falling in love.” (301) And that is why I am not recounting a summary of this story as in many of my reviews. I fell in love with the telling of the story.\n\nA book certainly deserving its 2021 Michael L. Printz award, an award which annually honors the best book written for teens, based entirely on its literary merit.\n\n-----\n\nFarewell Cuba, Mi Isla by Alexandra Diaz\n\n“Look outside your window, children,” Mami said as they took their seats. “You may never see your country again.” (ARC, 36)\n\nVictoria had a wonderful life in Cuba where she lived with her mother, father, and younger sister and brother. Also in the same duplex lived her cousin Jackie, her aunt, her uncle, and her baby cousin/godson. Even though they were very different and attended different schools in Havana, 12-year-old Victoria and Jackie were best friends, and they both spent time at their Papalfonso and Mamlara’s finca where Victoria rode her horse and swam with her cousin, a ranch that Victoria would inherit.\n\nOctober 1960: With Fidel Castro in power and protestors arrested, news restricted, and professionals prohibited from leaving the country, Victoria’s family makes the decision to go to Miami, expecting their exile to “only last a few weeks, until the U.S. presidential election.” (14)\n\nAlternating chapters focus on Victoria and Jackie and permit readers to learn what is happening in Cuba and about the Cuban community in Miami. Here Victoria lives in poverty (her father’s engineering degree of no use as he labors for minimum wage), and she tries to take charge of feeding her family. When Jackie arrives in Miami through the Peter Pan Project (reminiscent of the Holocaust Kindertransport), readers see how being apart from her immediate family affects her and her relationship with Victoria.\n\nI often have read and reviewed novels (and memoirs) by Margarita Engle and noted that I learned quite a lot of Cuban history, a history missing from my education. Diaz’s novel, inspired by the experiences of her mother and family who came to the\n\nUnited States from Cuba in 1960, spans October 1960 to June 1961 and teaches readers even more about Castro and his effect on Cuba and the Cuban citizens and the role the U.S. government played. This novel should be included in every American history course. This is also a story of prejudice, as experienced by Katya, Victoria’s Russian school friend, and of resilience and family. The Author’s Note further expands on the historical facts and includes a glossary of Cuban terms.\n\nFast Pitch by Nic Stone\n\nTwelve-year-old Shanice Lockwood is captain of a softball team, the Firebirds, the only all-Black softball team in the Dixie Youth Softball Association. She comes from a long line of batball players—her father, her grandfather PopPop, her great-grandfather. Her one goal is for her team to win the state championship.\n\nBut her goal shifts when she meets her Great-Great Uncle Jack, her Great-Grampy JonJon’s brother.\n\nShanice’s father had to quit baseball when he blew out his knee, his father had to stop playing to support his family, but why did JonJon quit when he was successfully playing for the Negro American League and was one of the first Black players recruited to the MLB? When Shanice is taken to Peachtree Hills Place to meet her sometimes-senile uncle, he tells her that JonJon “didn’t do what they said he did…He was framed.” (46) “My brother ain’t no thief. He didn’t do it…But I know who did.” (47)\n\nAnd Shanice is off on a quest to research the incident that caused her great grandfather to leave baseball and to see if she, with Jack’s information and JonJon’s leather journal, can clear his name while still trying to lead her softball team to victory.\n\nFast Pitch is a fun new novel by Nic Stone, full of batball, adventure, a little mystery, peer and family relationships, Negro League history, prejudice, and maybe a first crush.\n\n-----\n\nFlooded: Requiem for Johnstown by Ann E. Burg\n\nOn May 31, 1889, the South Fork Dam collapsed. Twenty million tons of water from Lake Conemaugh poured into Johnstown [Pennsylvania] and neighboring communities. More than 2,200 people died, including 99 entire families and 396 children. [Author’s Note] The flood still stands as the second or third deadliest day in U.S. history resulting from a natural calamity.\n\nRichard Peck wrote, “The bigger the issue, the smaller you write.” And author Ann E. Burg\n\nintroduces readers to individual residents of the town.\n\nWe read the stories of fifteen-year-old Joe Dixon who wants to run his own newsstand and marry his Maggie; Gertrude Quinn who tells us about her brother, three sisters, Aunt Abbie, and her father who owns the general store. We come to know Daniel and Monica Fagan. Daniel’s friend Willy, the poet, encouraged by his teacher to write, and George with 3 brothers and 4 sisters who wants to leave school and help support them. We watch the town prepare for the Decoration Day ceremony honoring the war dead.\n\nAnd after the flood, readers hear from Red Cross nurse Clara Barton, and Ann Jenkins and Nancy Little who brought law suits that found no justice, and a few of the 700 unidentified victims of the flood.\n\nAnd there are the members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club—Andrew Carnegie, Charles J. Clarke, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew Mellon, Cyrus Elder, and Elias Unger, the wealthy of Pittsburgh who ignored repeated warnings that the dam holding their private lake needed to be repaired so it wouldn't give way. “They don’t care a whit about the likes of us.” (57)\n\nThis is a story of class and privilege and those who work tirelessly to make ends meet. As Monica says, “People who have money, who shop at fancy stores and buy pretty things, shouldn’t think they’re better than folks who scrabble and scrounge and go to sleep tired and hungry.” (111)\n\nIn free-verse narrative monologues, readers experience the lives of a town and its hard-working, family-oriented inhabitants—people we come to know and love, reluctant to turn the pages leading towards the disaster we know they will encounter. We bear witness to the events as we read and empathy for the plights of the people affected by those events.\n\nThis is a book that could be shared across middle grade and high school ELA, social studies, and science classes.\n\n-----\n\nGenesis Begins Again by Alicia D. Williams\n\n“We’re gonna get evicted again. If we get evicted again, you said you’re gonna leave…. I’m tired of coming home and our stuff’s on the lawn waiting for crackheads to steal it. I’m tired of staying in people’s basements! Why can’t you just pay the rent! Just stop gambling and pay the rent!” (280)\n\nEighth-grader Genesis Anderson’s family has been evicted four times already. Her father has a gambling problem and is an alcoholic but somehow he moves them from Detroit to a house in the fashionable Farmington Hills. But again the rent is not paid, and they will probably lose this home also.\n\nGenesis has other problem, problems with other kids at her schools calling her names based on the darkness of her skin. Her parents are from complicated families with ideas about skin color and class. Genesis hates the color of her skin and the texture of her hair, wishing she looked like her beautiful light-skinned mother. “’I can’t stand you, ‘ I say to my reflection.” (10) She thinks her father has rejected her because she is dark like he is. “What if I inherited all Dad’s ways? What if no one recognizes that I’m…one of the good ones?” (154) “Every single night I’ve prayed for God to make me beautiful—make me light. And every morning I wake up exactly the same.” (157)\n\nEven though she is finally making friends in her new school, two friends—Todd and Sophia—who know what it’s like to be stereotyped and bullied and like Genesis for who she is, she tries to bleach her skin and relax her hair to fit in, become popular, and please her father and grandmother.\n\nThrough her chorus teacher’s discovery of her singing talent and introductions to the music of Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Eta James, Genesis finds the courage to audition for the school talent show and sing. “I can’t believe it. I did it. I, Genesis Anderson, stepped out onto that stage and sang. Out loud. In Public. Alone.” (249) At the actual performance, she discovers her strength. “I let each word soar. I swoop down to hug the little girl sitting on the curb with all her furniture. I visit the girl in the basement with the wrinkled brown bag passing from hand to hand. I kiss the lonely girl who hears ugly taunts from the mirror. I experience every moment. And I’m not afraid.” (348)\n\n-----\n\nGhost Boys by Jewell Parker Rhoads\n\nJerome, a black 12-year-old child who is bullied and has made his first friend was playing with a toy gun when a white policeman in a car shot him in the back and then offered no medical help. However, a 911 call misrepresented the 5’, 90-pound Jerome as a person with a gun, rather than a toy gun, and the policeman, against all evidence to the contrary, under oath swore, “I was in fear for my life.” And Jerome questions “when truth is a feeling, can it be both—true and untrue?” (132)\n\nJerome roams the world as a ghost, and when he and Officer Moore’s daughter Sarah become acquainted, he also meets the ghost of Emmett Till who shares his story. Jerome watches over this family and questions his new role —“Why haven’t I moved on?” (95), his relationship with Sarah, the relationships within Sarah’s family, and his relationships with the Ghost Boys, the hundreds of other black youth who have been killed. As he roams, he sees a Chicago filled with beauty and parks and flowers that was denied him as a child of color and poverty, and a recognition of injustice and tragedy is sparked. As Emmett says, “Someone decided they didn’t like us…. We were a threat, a danger. A menace.” (160) They are children.\n\nI don’t advocate for employing many whole-class novels during the year, but this is a book that will generate important conversations about prejudice, discrimination, stereotyping, fear, and the historical span of racism in this country that need to be held. This novel also would be a valuable addition to a social studies class study of civil rights and social justice.\n\n-----\n\nGringolandia by Lyn Miller-Lachmann\n\n\"The bigger the issue, the smaller you write.\"- Richard Price.\n\nWe read for many reasons but one essential purpose is to learn about our world, including its history, and to develop empathy for others. I found that, by teaching a social justice course through novels, my 8th graders learned about the effects of history on others, even others their age.\n\nLyn Miller-Lachmann's Gringolandia shares the story of high school student Daniel, a refugee from Chile's Pinochet regime, his activist \"gringo\" girlfriend Courtney, and Daniel's father who has just been released from years of torture in a Chilean prison and joins his family in Gringolandia.\n\nSpanning 1980-1991 this novel would be a valuable addition to a Social Justice or History curriculum or in my personal case, a good read to learn a history generally not covered in curriculum.\n\n-----\n\nHow I Became a Spy: A Mystery of WWII London by Deborah Hopkinson\n\nMystery, spies, double agents, coded messages, a heroic dog, and WWII! How I Became A Spy takes place between February 18 and March 1, 1944, a time period which affected the successful invasion held on D-Day.\n\nBertie is a 13-year-old who lives in a London experiencing the Little Blitz attacks. Feeling guilt over his older brother’s serious injuries from the Blitz a few years before, Bertie lives in the police barracks with his father and serves as a civil defense volunteer with Little Roo, his dog trained to rescue people from bombed buildings.\n\nDuring one nighttime raid, he meets a mysterious American girl, finds a notebook, discovers a young woman who is passed out on a street (disappearing by the time he brings back help), and he becomes involved in a mystery of intrigue. As he reads through the notebook, which belongs to a female French spy being trained by the Special Operations Executive, he finds that it contains coded messages that he needs to crack to save the woman and the secrecy of the planned invasion of Occupied France. Bertie joins forces with Eleanor, the American girl who was holding the notebook for her former French tutor and friend, and his best friend and classmate David, a Jewish refugee from Germany, who is well-versed in ciphers.\n\nWith only a few days until the trap is to be set for the double agent, the three have to determine whom to trust as they work to break the ciphers and put Violette’s plan in motion.\n\nDavid encourages them, “Sometimes people do the impossible…look at me, and others who came here on trains. Thousands of us are here, and alive, only because a few people did what others thought couldn’t be done.” (179-180)\n\nWith references to Sherlock Holmes and quotes from the actual Special Operations Executive training lecture and manual, as well as practice cipher messages, this novel is a fun and exciting read through history with memorable characters, some of whom actually existed.\n\nAs the boys’ history teacher says, “…because we are living through a war against tyranny, we have a special responsibility…To learn from the past, understand the present, and change the future.” (191)\n\n-----\n\nI Can Make This Promise by Christine Day\n\n“I think about Roger. He was the first person to ever say those words to me. ‘You look Native.’ And it didn’t feel presumptuous. It didn’t feel like a wild guess. It was like he recognized me. Like he saw something in me.” (24)\n\nTwelve-year-old Edie Green knows she is half Native American and that her mother was adopted and raised by a white couple at a very young age. But that is all she knows about her heritage, and she has never thought to ask for whom she is named. She discovered that she was “different” on the first day of kindergarten, a day she remembers in great detail, a day when her teacher’s questions about “where she was from” panicked her. But this was something she and her mother never discussed.\n\nThe summer before seventh grade, Edie and her friends discover a box in her attic, a box with pictures and letter from a young woman named Edith who looks just like Edie. When she asks her mother about her name, her mother lies, and a few days later they have a fight when Edie wants to see a movie featuring a Native American character. Now Edie doesn’t know how her mother will react when she tells her she has found the box and has read Edith Graham’s letters. Even her mother’s older brother, Uncle Phil, won’t tell her the secret.\n\nWhen Edie’s mother finally shares her past and the past of her birth family, “I didn’t picture this. I wasn’t ready for this horrific injustice.” (230)\n\nI Can Make This Promise shares a time of intolerance and injustice in U.S. history, a time before the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 became a vital piece of legislation.\n\n-----\n\nIceberg by Jenniefer A. Nielsen\n\n“So I’d begun to work hard and to sacrifice what I wanted for what my family needed. I’d learned to be bold and to take risks when necessary. That’s what had kept my family going for the past two years. It’s how I would help them now.” (45)\n\nMany of us know, or think we know, a lot about the Titanic, but Jennifer Nielsen lets us travel on the Titanic and learn about the tragedy through the eyes of twelve-year-old future journalist Hazel Rothbury, a stowaway third-class passenger. Hers is one story out of 2,224; one survivor out of 705.\n\nHazel didn’t mean to stow away. After her father’s death at sea, her mother was sending her to America to work in a factory with her aunt to support, and save, the family at home. When the money she had was not enough for a ticket, Hazel stows away, eventually with the help of Charlie Blight, a young porter also supporting his family. Hazel is also befriended by Sylvia, a girl in first class, much to the consternation of Sylvia’s governess.\n\nHazel had done her research on the Titanic, but when she overhears that there is a fire on the ship, she realizes how little she—and the other passengers—actually know and her questions grow. As she illicitly traverses the ship, talking with crew and passengers, she fills her notebook with questions and answers, hoping to sell a story when she arrives in New York and become a journalist rather than a factory worker. Her questions, and her doubts about the safety of the unsinkable Titanic, grow as she leans about single and double hulls, coal fires, the different types of icebergs and how they are discerned, Morse Code, and, most important, refraction.\n\nIn the midst of all this, Hazel becomes embroiled in a mystery. Is there a devious plot that will harm her new friend Sylvia? Her new, older friend Mrs. Abelman? Just who are the villains, what are they up to, and why do they wish her harm.\n\nReaders learn much more about the Titanic, the passengers, their activities, the on-board class system—and the tragedy that sent 2/3 of the passengers and crews to their deaths and the heroes that helped 1/3 to survive. They learn such eye-opening facts that while the Titanic could have carried 64 lifeboats., it only carried 20, 18 of which were launched with passengers but with 472 empty seats. (299)\n\nThis is a novel for cross-curricular study: English-Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science, while the mystery will engage reluctant readers.\n\n-----\n\nIt Doesn't Take a Genius by Olugbemisola Rhuday-Perkovich\n\n“I don’t even like debate, to be honest. But I’m good at it, and I learned early on that’s what matters. People love a winner. When you win, everyone sees you. And if people don’t see you, maybe you’re not really there.” (8)\n\nThirteen-year-old Emmett Charles is a winner, or at least at his school where his vocabulary, three debate trophies, science fair award, and Spelling Bee record have him feeling he might even be a genius.\n\nAnd when his social skills and small size fail him, his older brother Luke is always there to bail him out , especially with Mac, his bully. “Luke has come out of nowhere. Like a superhero. He’s even taller than Mac, wears his shirts a little small so girls can peep his muscles, and his fade is tight and gleaming.” (6-7) “Sometimes it feels like I’m in a river, and the current’s real strong. And I have a choice between clinging to a rock and getting left behind, or letting myself get swept up in it and carried along without any control. Luke’s my rock.” (138)\n\nBut when his brother Luke gets a scholarship to a private art school in Maine for his last year of high school, summer is all Emmett, or E as he wants to be called, will have for Luke to turn him back into a winner after he passed on competing in this year’s debate championship. “We’re a team. Batman and Robin.” (29)\n\nBut when he discovers that Luke has gotten a job as a junior counselor at Camp DuBois, a historic Black summer camp in New York, and Emmett schemes to get himself a scholarship to attend as a camper. When he arrives he discovers that\n\nHis brother will be too busy to spend any time with him\n\nThe camp is filled with “geniuses” and nerds—and new friends who have his back\n\nHe will be discovering more of his culture and history through classes like “Black to the Future” and the camp focuses on community, not individual success. He finally realizes that “DuBois is preparing me for something more than bubble tests, more than I’d ever thought it would.” (190)\n\nEven though he is a great dancer, he is an even better choreographer\n\nAlthough he sees himself as a winner, without effort and spreading himself too thin, he can lose, more than he thought\n\nHe will have to take swimming lessons (with the Littles) and pass a swimming test\n\n“What my friends, and my family for that matter, don’t seem to understand is that I don’t swim. I guess they get the fact that I can’t. But they keep thinking that I will, one day. That I even want to. And they’re WRONG. Dad was supposed to teach me, and he’s not here.” (19) Emmett’s father died when he was 5, and Like and his mother don’t discuss his father with him which saddens him. In fact, seeing other kids with their dads sadden him.\n\nAnd most important he discovers, as Natasha says, “It doesn’t take a genius to be a friend.” (291)\n\nE’s story is filled with great characters: the socially-awkward Charles who can “do you” the best I have seen; Charles’ love interest and budding playwright Michelle, Emmett’s crush Natasha who does win at everything but is just as happy when the camp director decides there will be no final competitions; the alleged-bully Derek who is able to spend more time with Luke than Emmett does, but, as is often the case, is more complex than presumed; and the assortment of other campers, counselors, and group leaders. Readers will learn not only a lot of Black history but the importance of studying one’s cultural roots.\n\nThere will be adolescents in the classroom and community who need to read this book. I know that I learned quite a lot which led me to want to know more‑about Black culture and my culture and the cultures of others.\n\n-----\n\nKaleidoscope Eyes by Jen F. Bryant\n\nThis Jen Bryant novel in verse is yet another opportunity for readers to learn history through story, discovering patterns the pieces make.\n\n“I lie down on my bed,\n\nPoint my kaleidoscope at the ceiling light,\n\nWatch the patterns scatter, the pieces\n\nSlide apart and come back together\n\nIn ways I hadn’t noticed before.” (149)\n\nThe time period of the novel is 1966-1968, but eighth-grader Lyza’s life is also affected by the years before.\n\nShe is affected by the “Unwritten Rules” that govern her close friendship with Malcolm Dupree—from tricycle days until now, they have “gotten along like peas in a pod.” (11) But it is a friendship that causes Lyza to experience the prejudice of the times and her town. “We sure didn’t make the rules / about who can be friends with whom / and we don’t like the rules the way they are…/ but we are also not fools… And so—/ in the halls, at lunch, and in class / Malcolm stays with the other black kids / and I stay with the other white kids…” (12) And when they meet new people and go to new places, they are wary and watchful in a way adolescents should not need to be.\n\nHer every action is affected by her mother’s leaving two years before when Lyza was in sixth grade and “when our family began to unravel” (5). Her college professor father works all hours, taking on extra classes and leaving Kyza and Denise to their own devices and discipline. Denise gives up college and her dreams of becoming a doctor to work in the local diner and hang out with her hippie boyfriend, Harry.\n\nThe town is affected by war in Vietnam which causes Lyza to don her black funeral dress too many times, and “Not coming back” attains a new meaning. So much so, Lyza realizes that her mother is probably never coming back either. And when Malcolm’s brother Dixon is drafted and sent to Vietnam, feelings of helplessness overwhelm her,\n\n“When someone you love\n\nleaves,\n\nand there is\n\nnothing nothing nothing\n\nyou can do about it, not one thing\n\nyou can say to\n\nstop that person whom you love\n\nso much\n\nfrom going away, and you know that today\n\nmay just be\n\nthe very last time you will ever\n\nsee them hear them hold them,\n\nwhen that day comes, there is not much\n\nyou can do,\n\nnot much you can say.” (120)\n\nLyza’s grandfather dies and leaves her a mystery tied to pirate Captain Kidd, maps—old and current, a key, and a drawer, file, and documents numbers for the Historical Society of Brigantine. Lyza, Malcolm, and Carolann (“…whenever I am with Carolann and Malcolm at the same time…that’s when I feel almost normal.”) (15) spend the summer working out the mystery with the help of, surprisingly, Denise, and even more unexpectedly, Harry, Denise’s “strong, long-haired boyfriend” who is smarter, more resourceful, and more trustworthy than Lyza presumed.\n\nIt is a summer of spyglasses and kaleidoscopes, letting go, realization that “…my family might be messed up but my friends [a widening circle] are as steady as they come.” (214) A summer that is important to Lyza, her family, and the town.\n\n“I take my kaleidoscope off the shelf…\n\nI turn and turn and turn and turn,\n\nLetting the crystals shift into strange\n\nAnd beautiful patterns, letting the pieces fall\n\nWherever they will.” (257)\n\n-----\n\nKent State by Deborah Wiles\n\n“With any story, with any life, with any event whether joyous or tragic, there is so much more to know than the established, inadequate norm: There will be as many versions of the truth as there are persons who lived it.” (Author’s Note, 121)\n\nDeborah Wiles’ historical verse novel does just that. It tells the story of the Vietnam War protest held on the campus of Kent State University and the students who were wounded and killed when the Ohio National Guard opened fire, students who may or may not have been actively involved in the demonstration. The novel chronicles the four days from Friday, May 1 to Monday, May 4, 1970.\n\nBut what is unique is that this is the story told by all the voices those involved, in whatever way—those readers may agree with, and those they may not. Author Salman Rushdie has told audiences that anyone who values freedom of expression should recognize that it must apply also to expression of which they disapprove. In Kent State we hear from protestors, faculty, and students, and friends of the four who were killed—Allison Krause, Jeffrey Miller, Sandy Scheuer, and Bill Schroeder. We also observe the perspectives of the National Guardsmen, the people of the community of Kent, Ohio; and the Black United Students at Kent State. The readers themselves are addressed at times.\n\n-----\n\nLines of Courage by Jennifer A, Nielsen\n\n“There is a fire within each of us. If you fuel that fire with anger, it will burn all your happiness. But if you fuel it with courage, then the fire will give you strength to do difficult things.” (45-46)\n\nMy father once told me the story about how, as a six-year-old, he finally was able to walk to the candy store by himself to buy some penny candy. Imagine his excitement! And imagine his disappointment to discover that the store was closing at that very moment. World War I had been declared. A war which meant nothing to a little boy living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. World War I also had little meaning for me, just more dates and names. In Nielsen’s newest novel, Lines of Courage, I learned more in the first chapter about this war than from my high school history classes, seeing the events which precipitated the war from the up close perspective of a young adolescent.\n\nIn Lines of Courage readers experience the war from all perspectives, the Allies and the Central Powers, through the stories of five adolescents: Felix, a young Jew from Austria-Hungary; Kara from Britain whose burning ambition is to earn her Red Cross pin; Juliette from France whose father has been imprisoned; a too-young soldier, Dimitri from Russia; and Elsa from Germany who raises homing pigeons. From June 1914 to November 11, 1918, their stories span the timeline of war. And, as unlikely as it seems, their paths cross as the each find courage to be saved and to save.\n\n“…that is life. Mademoiselle, something will always be in your way. So draw your line around it and keep going. You will find your family again, but it will come at the end of a long and crooked path.” (230)\n\n-----\n\nLoving vs. Virginia: A Documentary Novel of the Landmark Civil Rights Case by Patricia Hruby Powell\n\nLoving vs Virgina is the story behind the unanimous landmark decision of June 1967. Told in free verse through alternating narrations by Richard and Mildred, the story begins in Fall 1952 when 13-year old Mildred notices that her desk in the colored school is “ sad excuse for a desk” and her reader “reeks of grime and mildew and has been in the hands of many boys,” but she also relates the closeness of family and friends in her summer vacation essay. This closeness is also expressed in the family’s Saturday dinner where “folks drop by,” one of them being the boy who catches Mildred’s ball during the kickball game and “Because of him I don’t get home.” That boy is her neighbor, nineteen-year-old Richard Loving, and that phrase becomes truer than Mildred could have guessed.\n\n​On June 2, 1958, Richard, who is white, and Mildred marry in Washington, D.C., and on July 11, 1958 they are arrested at her parents’ house in Virginia. The couple spends the next ten years living in D.C., sneaking into Virginia, and finally contacting the American Civil Liberties Union who brings their case through the courts to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe documentary novel brings the story behind the case alive, interspersed with quotes, news headlines and news reports, maps, timelines, and information on the various court cases, and the players involved, as the case made its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nStudents can learn history from textbooks, from lectures, or more effectively and affectively, through the stories of the people involved. Novels are where readers learn empathy, vicariously living the lives of others.\n\n-----\n\nParkland Speaks: Survivors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas Share Their Stories by Lerner, Sarah, Ed.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, I read the writings of the survivors of that unspeakable event. In this “yearbook,” students and teachers share their stories of grief, terror, anger, and hope, and honor those who died through narratives, letters, speeches, free verse and rhyming poetry, and art. As the editor, MSD English and journalism teacher Sarah Lerner, writes, “Watching my students find their voices after someone tried to silence them was impressive…. It was awe-inspiring. It was brave…. They turned their grief into words, into pictures, into something that helped them begin the healing process.”\n\n“[The news] keeps coming in,\n\nIt doesn’t pause\n\nOr give you a break. It keeps hitting you\n\nWith debilitating blows, one after the other,\n\nAs those missing responses remain empty,\n\nAnd your messages remain unread.” –C. Chalita\n\n“We entered a war zone.…I came out of that building a different person than the one who left for school that day.” –J. DeArce\n\n“Somehow, through the darkness, we found another shade of love, too\n\nsomething that outweighed the hate and swept the grays away.\n\nA love so strong it transcended colors, something so empowering and true it couldn’t be traced to one hue.” – H. Korr\n\n“I just don’t want to let go of all the people I love,\n\nI want to continuously tell them “I love you” until\n\nMy voice is raw and my throat is sore” – S. Bonnin\n\n“I invite you [Dear Mr. President] to learn, to hear the story from inside,\n\nCause if not now, when will be the right time to discuss?” –A. Sheehy\n\nA look into the minds and hearts of those who experienced an event no one, especially adolescents, should ever expect to encounter as they share with readers in similar and disparate circumstances across the globe. Not technically historical (and sadly not fiction), this tragic event has become part of our history.\n\n-----\n\nRescue by Jennifer A, Nielsen\n\n“Maman once told me that surviving in an occupied country meant we had to learn to live in the middle—somewhere between accepting our fate and outright resistance. With my next step, I left the middle.” 97\n\nOn May 10, 1940 Germany invaded France. On May 11, Meg’s British father left to fight the Germans, working on secret missions for the Special Operations Executive (S.O.E.). Almost two years later, 12-year-old Meg is helping the resistance in The Perche. When she is sought for questioning by the Nazis, Meg leaves France. With her are a young boy named Jakob and Arthur and Liesel, who are posing as his parents. Meg is tasked to help them escape to neutral Spain so that Arthur will give orders to free her father who was being hunted as an enemy of the Nazis. All Meg has to go on is a code from her father and a spy book from an injured resistance fighter. As Jakob and Meg work together and try to solve the code, they realize that there may be a traitor among them.\n\n“Jakob stuffed his hands in his pockets. ‘I was taught that everyone has three choices in life. To be part of the good, part of the evil, or to try standing in the middle. But I don’t think that’s true anymore. There is no middle. Those who refuse to choose one side or the other only get in the way of those who are doing good, and in that way, end up helping those who wish to do evil.’” (111)\n\nEspionage. Secrecy. Danger. Mystery. Betrayal. Resistance. Heroes. Enemies. Traitors. Spies. This novel has it all and will engage the most reluctant of readers and challenge the more proficient readers.\n\n“This war seemed to me like a chain of dominoes stacked on their ends. With the first invasion, one tile had toppled another, and then another and another. And not only in the destruction of governments and border lines but destroying dreams for the future and traditions of the past. Destroying families.” (147)\n\nRescue is another well-written history fiction novel with engaging developed characters by Jennifer Nielsen.\n\n-----\n\nRima’s Rebellion: Courage in the Time of Tyranny by Margarita Engle\n\nI dream of being legitimate\n\nMy father would love me,\n\nsociety could accept me,\n\nstrangers might even admire\n\nmy short, simple first name\n\nif it were followed\n\nby two surnames\n\ninstead of\n\none. (53)\n\nTwelve-year-old Rima Marin is a natural child, the illegitimate child of a father who will not acknowledge her.\n\nI am a living, breathing secret.\n\nNatural children aren’t supposed to exist.\n\nOur names don’t appear on family trees,\n\nour framed photos never rest affectionately\n\nbeside a father’s armchair, and when priests\n\nwrite about us in official documents,\n\nthey follow the single surname of a mother\n\nwith the letters SOA,\n\nmeaning sin otro apellido,\n\nso that anyone reading\n\nwill understand clearly\n\nthat without two last names\n\nwe have no legal right to money\n\nfor school uniforms, books, papers, pencils,\n\nshelter,\n\nor food. (11)\n\nRima, her Mama, and her abuela live in poverty, squatting in a small building owned by her wealthy father. Her mother is a lacemaker and her abulela—a nurse during the wars for independence from Spain—works as a farrier and founded La Mambisa Voting Club whose members are fighting for voting rights, equality for “natural children,” and the end of the Adultery Law which permits men to kill unfaithful wives and daughters along with their lovers.\n\nTaking place from 1923 to 1936, Rima also joins La Mambisas; becomes friends with her acknowledged, wealthy half-sister, keeping her safe when she defies their father, refusing arranged marriage and becomes pregnant by her boyfriend; falls in love; and becomes trained as a typesetter, printing revolutionary books and posters for suffrage.\n\nOver the thirteen years she grows from a girl who cowers from bullies who call her “bastarda,” finding confidence only in riding Ala, her buttermilk mare,\n\nto an adolescent, living in the city and fighting dictatorship with words—hers and others:\n\nabsorb[ing] the strength of female hopes,\n\nwondering if this is how it will be\n\nsomeday\n\nwhen women\n\ncan finally\n\nvote. (43)\n\nto a young married woman and mother voting in her first election:\n\nVoting rights are our only\n\nPathway to freedom from fear. (167)\n\nIn this new novel, Rima joins author Margarita Engle’s other strong women, real and fictitious, in their fight for the people of Cuba: Liana of Your Heart My Sky; Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda or Tula, The Lightning Dreamer: Cuba's Greatest Abolitionist; Rosa of The Surrender Tree: Poems of Cuba’s Struggle for Freedom; and Paloma of Tropical Secrets: Holocaust Refugees in Cuba. Perfect reads for International Women’s Day.\n\n-----\n\nRingside, 1925: Views from the Scopes Trial by Jen F. Bryant\n\nI have always been interested in the Scopes “Monkey” Trial; I think much of America has—whether it be about religion vs science, text book and curricula decisions, the role of law and government in education, William Jennings Bryan vs Clarence Darrow, or Spencer Tracy vs Fredric March (Inherit the Wind).\n\nMost of us know the Who, What, Where, When, and believe we know the Why – but do we? How often do we know the true story of historic events—and the stories behind the story, and the different perspectives on the story. Jen Bryant’s historical novel grants us the chance to observe the events of the Scopes Trial close up and personally.\n\nThrough this novel, written in the voices of those who had a ringside seat to this trial, readers secure a ringside seat to the trial, the people who participated in it, and the town that hosted it.\n\nAs the reader views the controversy and the trial from the point of view of nine fictitious, diverse characters (plus quotes from the real participants), each character develops as the story progresses. My favorite are the teenagers of Dayton, Tennessee; while meeting those on both sides of the issue and closely observing them, readers discover how the trial affects them, their relationships, and their futures. Peter and Jimmy Lee, best friends become divided by their beliefs; Marybeth is a young lady who finds the strength to stand up to her father’s traditional view of the role of women in society; and my favorite character, Willy Amos, meets Clarence Darrow and dares to believe what he can attempt to achieve. “’Well,’ I pointed out, ‘there ain’t no such thing as a colored lawyer.’”…”Do you plan to let that stop you?” (210)\n\nThe novel is powerfully written in multiple formats—free verse in a variety of stanza configurations and spacing decisions, a few rhyming lines here and there, and some prose. And the messages are powerful: Peter Sykes: “Why should a bigger mind need a smaller God.” (11); Marybeth Dodd: “I think some people can look at a thing a lot of different ways at once and they can all be partly right.” (131); and Constable Fraybel: “[Darrow] claims [his witnesses] are anxious to explain the difference between science and religious faith and how they made places in their heart and minds for both.” (143)\n\nAn epilogue shares the aftermath and the lasting effects of the trial. Every American History/Social Justice teacher and English-Language Arts teacher should have copies of this novel.\n\n-----\n\nHotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet by Jamie Ford\n\n​\n\nThis is a World War II story that focuses on race, ethnicity, nationality, culture, prejudice, and stereotyping. It is a love story and a friendship story between and among those of diverse cultures and in so, functions as a true multicultural story.\n\nI have read many WWII stories but less about the war with Japan and those Japanese Americans sent to internment camps. In Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet readers see how loyal Americans (some second generation) were rounded up and sent to first one camp where they lived in horse stalls and then to another built in the middle of nowhere by their own labor. I have read no others novels that focus on the antipathy of the Chinese for the Japanese.\n\nIn this love story between Chinese and Japanese adolescents, readers can discover just how intolerance and stereotyping can destroy a family and how open mindedness in our newest generation can bring it back again.\n\nNot technically considered a YA novel, this is a book for both adolescents and adults.\n\n-----\n\nSwim Team by Johnnie Christmas\n\n“But…Black people aren’t good at swimming.” (78)\n\nWhen Bree and her father move from Brooklyn to Florida, she is excited about her first day of school. She has already made a friend, another 7th grader who lives in her apartment complex. Excited about joining the Math Team, Bree finds that the only elective that is still open is Swimming. And even though she tries to think about the things that make her happy—doing homework with her Dad, cooking, reading, and math—frequently “negative thoughts take over. And I think about the things that make me nervous and scared. I second-guess and doubt myself, even when I don’t want to.” (7) And some of the things that Bree doesn’t like are sports, pools, and she worries about not having friends. She is especially worried about Swimming class because she has never learned to swim.\n\nBree eludes the class, and, when she can no longer avoid it, Ms Etta, her neighbor and a former professional swimmer who happens to have swum on the team at Bree’s middle school back when the team almost won the championship, teaches Bree to swim. Ms Etta also explains the reasons that Bree assumes that Black people aren’t good at swimming. “From ancient Africa to modern Africa, from Chicago to Peru, in seas, rivers, lakes and pools, Black people have always swum and always will.” (80-81) But she also explains the history of segregation and discrimination that limited Blacks’ access to pools, Telling about Eugene Williams’ murder (1919), David Isom’s breaking of the color line (1958), and John Lewis’ protest (1962).\n\nBree becomes quite a good swimmer, and the coach of the school swim team tricks her into trying out. She joins the team with her new best friend Clara, and, with the help of Ms. Etta, the team makes it to the championship. But when a student, Mean-Girl Keisha, transfers from the rival private school and joins the team and the girls find out that Clara has won a swimming scholarship to the same private school for the next year, the team relay threatens to fall apart.\n\nThat is when they learn what happened to Ms. Etta’s team years ago that cost them the championship. Reuniting the former Swim Sisters reunites the present team as they learn about relationships. “A team is like a family. Sometimes family shows you how to do a flip turn. Or tells funny jokes—And is a little annoying. (215)\n\nJohnnie Christmas’ new graphic novel tells the story of middle-grade friendships, socioeconomic prejudice and racial discrimination, and swimming through those negative thoughts that hold us back. In the classroom this novel could lead to some research on Black athletes in sports through history and discrimination.\n\n-----\n\nThe Last Cherry Blossom by Kathleen Burkinshaw\n\nAll wars have two sides, but, as Winston Churchill said, “History is written by the victors.” Through history books and archives our students learn only one point of view, but we must disrupt the narrative with tales from the other side.\n\nWhen our students study World War II—the war in Europe and the war with Japan, it is crucial that we help our students to see all perspectives and bear witness to the experiences of others. They need to learn that actions and decisions of governments have effects. One of those actions by the United States in 1945 was the bombing of Hiroshima, employing the first atomic bombs.\n\nThrough author Kathleen Burkinshaw’s poignant story, based on her mother’s childhood in Japan, readers can gain empathy and understanding for those innocent victims of war. This is the first-person narrative of 12-year-old Yuriko, her family members who are inundated with family secrets and shifting relationships, her neighbors who are sending their boys off to war, and her best friend. Through this important and well-written story, readers are introduced to Japanese culture, experience the strain of family secrets, and observe the war from the Japanese perspective. Not only a story of war, The Last Cherry Blossom is the story of family, heritage, and relationships.\n\n-----\n\nThe Lightning Dreamer: Cuba’s Greatest Abolitionist by Margarita Engle\n\n“I feel certain that words / can be as human / as people, / alive / with the breath / of compassion.”\n\nThe Lightning Dreamer shares the story of feminist Gertrudis Gomez de Avellaneda, known as Tula. The story follows Tula from 1827, where she tells us that “Books are door-shaped portals…helping me feel less alone,” to 1836 where she begins the first of her books to spread her hope of racial and gender equality.\n\nAs a girl, Tula reads in secret and burns her writings because reading and writing are unladylike. At 13 she is nearing the age of forced marriage, and her grandfather and mother make plans to barter her for riches. The reader follows Tula through Engle’s beautiful verse as she writes plays and stories to give hope to orphaned children and slaves; refuses not one, but two arranged marriages; falls in love with a half-African freed slave who loves another; and at last, independent, moves to Havana to be healed by poetry and plan the writing of “a gentle tale of love,” a story about how human souls are “free of all color, class, and gender.”\n\nThe real Tula wrote that abolitionist novel and spread her hope of racial and gender equality. “Some people are born with words flowing in their veins.” -The Nuns\n\n-----\n\nThe Long Ride by Marina Budhos\n\n“You know, it’s a lot easier to be one side or the other. It’s harder to be in the middle. People don’t like the middle. That’s the bravest thing of all.” (178)\n\nJamila, Josie, and Francesca are best friends of mixed race in 1971 Queens, NY. Their plans for starting seventh grade with each other and their white schoolmates at the neighborhood junior high school change when they become part of social experiment—integration. Francesca’s parents send her to a private school where she doesn’t fit, while Josie and Jamila take a long bus ride to a predominately black school in a much rougher neighborhood. They hope they may fit in better there, but Jamila is too white for the girls and Josie is no longer in the advanced classes and worries about her future. The girls don’t fit into their new school neighborhood and their new friends don’t fit into their neighborhood.\n\nAs they try to navigate seventh grade, boyfriends, teachers, classes, narrator Jamila’s anger, and Josie’s shyness, Jamilla realizes, “if anyone had told me this was what being in junior high would be like: Your best friend is silent beside you. You’re skinny and knock-kneed and you get lost easily. You aren’t at the top of the Ferris Wheel. I’d have said: You can have it. (60)\n\nThe world seemed to have changed. “…I’m starting to notice that something bigger s going on in the city. Everyone is edgier, angry. You can feel it in the way people squint through the bus windows.\n\n-----\n\nThe Night Diary by Veera Hiranandani\n\n“There was one thing I did understand. I would have memories of life here in Mirpur Khas and memories of life in the new India. My childhood would always have a line drawn through it, the before and after.” (86)\n\nWhen 12-year-old Nisha and her twin brother Amil were born, their mother died. They grew up in a town in what was then India where their Muslim mother and Hindu father settled after they married. But in August 1947 India gained independence from British rule and was partitioned into two republics, India and Pakistan. (Author’s Note) And violence and killing broke out between the Hindus who were crossing the border into new India and the Muslims who were fleeing to Pakistan, groups who had peacefully co-existed, at least in Nisha’s village.\n\nOn July 14 when she turns 12 Nisha begins writing letters to her mother in her diary, chronicling the family’s life. Readers learn that Nisha speaks only a little but loves to cook with Kazi, their Muslim cook. That Amil has dyslexia and doesn’t do well in school; he is an artist, fails at sports, and is bullied. Dadi, their paternal grandmother, lives with them, but no one shows them much love.\n\n“You know what I wish, Mama, more than anything in the world? That I could spend just one day with you, so I’d know what your skin looks like up close and the sound of your voice. I’d know the scent of you…. Then I could think about that when I write these words, and when I try to fall asleep.” (33)\n\nWhen they have to flee, leaving Kazi to tend to the house and presumably the new, Muslim doctor, readers learn through Nisha’s written words about the hardships and suffering of refugees—and Nisha’s anxieties. Waking miles each day, the family runs out of water and competes with other refugees for water in the pumps at the villages and space on the trains. At one point Nisha is held at knife point by a grieving man who thinks they killed his family.\n\n“I wouldn’t dare say this out loud, but I’m so angry at all the leaders, like Jinnah and Nehru, who were supposed to know better, who were supposed to protect us, who were supposed to make sure things like this didn’t happen. I’m even angry at Gandhi for not being able to stop it.” (127)\n\nWhen they find refuge with their mother’s brother, a Muslim, they need to keep hidden. But Nisha has finally found a friend she can talk to and, to keep their uncle safe, they again must leave—“Maybe if Papa finds out and [Hafa’s] parents find out, they will see that we’re just two lonely girls who want to be friends. How could a friendship be dangerous?” (217)—heading to the new India.\n\nOne of the most effective ways to learn about any historical event, and the nuances and effects of those events, is through novel study—the power of story. Through Nisha’s story readers will learn the history of India and Pakistan but also learn about the malevolent and traumatic power of prejudice which, sadly, does not only exist in history. This is a story of 1947, but it is also a story of today.\n\nI look forward to the continuation of this family’s story through Amil’s perspective in the upcoming Amil and the After.\n\n-----\n\nThe Night War by Kimberly Brubaker Bradley\n\nJuly 1942: “I didn’t know it, but that was my last Shabbos in the Pletzl. Inside of a week, my whole world shattered. (ARC, 16)\n\nTwelve-year-old German-born Miriam lived in the Paris Pletz in a one-room apartment with her parents, surrounded by other displaced Jews. She feels overwhelming guilt that she couldn’t help stop the arrest of her Jewish neighbor, Mr. Rosenbaum, two years before, and when her own father is forced into hiding and Miri returns to the apartment to the sound of what could be the flowerpot falling or a gunshot, not finding her mother, she runs with Sara Rosenbaum and her baby daughter Nora. When all the Jews are rounded up and herded into the velodrome, Miri escapes with the child. Sara asks that she get Nora to the Vichy side and to Zurich to a relative and freedom. “Not can you. Will you.” (ARC, 24)\n\nA nun helps the two girls escape Paris, but, falling asleep in the long ride, upon wakening Miri finds that Nora has been taken away to live with foster parents. She vows to find her and take her away.\n\nMiri, now living in a Catholic boarding school under the Catholic name Marie with two other students her age and some younger students who are staying over the summer, never gives up on finding Nora and escaping.\n\nNear them is the castle of Catherine de Medici with beautiful gardens that have fallen into ruin. There she meets the owner of the castle, a mysterious woman all in black. Miri also discovers that the castle acts as a bridge between occupied and Vichy France. She does not know who she can trust, but when the nun who has been helping refugees to escape breaks her leg, Miri offers to take her place, remembering her father’s words, “We don’t choose how we feel, but we choose how we act. Choose courage.” (ARC, 16)\n\nThis exciting story of espionage, mystery, betrayal, power, unusual friendships, learning how history repeats itself in different guises, and making choices —“Sometimes there are no good choices.” (ARC, 229)—will keep readers reading, guessing, and learning about two time periods in history.\n\n-----\n\nThe Orphan Band of Springdale by Anne Nesbet\n\nThis novel presents small-town life in the United States in 1941 prior to the bombing of Pearl Harbor—before the U.S. was involved in the war in Europe. But through the story, we can see patriotism being emphasized, even in the schools, and the suspicions of those of German descent. In this small town in Maine, immigrants need to register and unions are coming to the mills in a direct clash with the powerful mill owners. As one classmate says, “[My Daddy] says we have to be really cautious these days, with all the countries over in Europe fighting each other and aliens everywhere.” (276)\n\nIn the midst of all this comes fifth-grader Augusta Neubronner, who, as the child of a German-born labor organizer, has had to move many times and live on ethics rather than money. As Gusta’s father flees the country and her mother tries to make ends meet, Gusta is sent to her grandmother’s orphanage in Maine, taking her beloved French horn, a family treasure which she loves with all her heart but is willing to sacrifice for her new family.\n\nLiving with her extended family and the orphans and fighting for their rights (and her father’s reputation), Gusta becomes stronger and more confident. There are many family problems and secrets, so she searches for her great-grandfather’s Wish that her mother told her about, “because her papa had taught her that whatever you can do to put things right in the world, you really must do” (295). But the more she finds out about the people around her, her more her wishes add up until she realizes she can’t name the one wish that would solve everything. And as her mother says, “Wishes are such sneaky things. You can never tell how they’re going to go, wishes.” (429)\n\nThis is a book about the importance of truth although sometimes a lie is necessary. And for a truthful person to tell a necessary lie “must take something a lot like love.” (406). It is a story of family and other relationships and acceptance and coming home. Based on the author's mother's family stories, it is a story that rings true.\n\n-----\n\nThe Surrender Tree: Poems of Cuba’s Struggle for Freedom by Margarita Engle\n\nThrough Margarita Engle’s verse novels and her memoir, I am learning the history of Cuba and Cuban-American relationships more thoroughly and effectively than I ever learned about them in school.\n\nThe Surrender Tree is the story of Cuba's three wars for independence and the story of Rosa, the nurse who saved lives and spirits through all of them. This novel portrays the lives and heroic actions of real people in the face of evil, letting the reader live history along with memorable characters.\n\n-----\n\nThe Trial by Jen F. Bryant\n\nFamiliar with aviator Charles Lindbergh, I was not as knowledgeable about the 1932 kidnapping of his son and the resulting trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, but the most effective way to learn about it was through the eyes, and words, of seventh-grader Katie Leigh Flynn.\n\nKatie is a resident of Flemington, New Jersey, a town where “nothing ever happens.” (5). Katie’s father left her and her mother years ago, and both Katie and her mother are compassionate about the plight of others. The Great Depression has begun; Katie donates food and clothing for less-fortunate children and, when the hotel’s assistant chef is caught putting food in his pockets, her mother says she will “find him an apron with larger pockets.” Katie supports her best friend Mike who “is not like / the other boys I know…he’s not / stuck-up or loudmouthed or silly” (10) and lives with his father, a drunk.\n\nKatie, nicknamed “Word Girl” by the local newspaper editor, plans to become a reporter and keeps a scrapbook of news clippings and headlines, especially about Colonel Lindbergh and the kidnapping. When the Hauptmann is arrested and the trial comes to the local courthouse, her reporter uncle needs a secretary to take notes, and she takes six weeks off school to help. Thus, readers experience the 1935 trial through Katie.\n\nDuring the trial, readers meet the Lindbergs; the judge; the defendant; the alcoholic defense lawyer who hasn’t won a case in years; prosecutor Wilentz; Anna Hauptmann who swears her husband was at home with her and their baby that night; a witness (paid by the prosecution); and Walter Winchell and other celebrities who come to town for the trial.\n\nThe story reminds us that at this time Hitler is in power and discrimination and his persecution has begun in Europe. But Americans are just as prone to prejudice and discrimination. The German bakery changes its sign to “Good American-Baked Bread and Desserts.” [Katie’s] “Mother shrugs, ‘Everything German is suspicious these days.’” (96) And Hauptmann is a German immigrant.\n\nPrejudice is not limited to Germans. People talk about Katie’s friend Mike. “They say: ‘Kids like Mike / never amount to much.’” (24) He is accused of vandalism but when Katie wants to tell who really was responsible, he tells her,\n\n“I’m a drunkard’s son.\n\nYou’re a dancer’s daughter.\n\nBobby Fenwick is a surgeon’s son.\n\nHis mother is on\n\nthe School Board,\n\nthe Women’s League,\n\nthe Hospital Auxiliary,\n\nthe Town Council,\n\nIf you were Mrs, McTavish,\n\n[who is a member of\n\nthe School Board,\n\nthe Women’s League,\n\nthe Hospital Auxiliary,\n\nthe Town Council, (110)]\n\nWho would you believe?” (112)\n\nTruth moves to center stage for Katie (if not for anyone else). Thinking about the conflicting testimonies and absence of evidence, she reflects, “Truth must be … like a lizard that’s too quick to catch and turns a different color to match whatever rock it sits upon.” (126) She is careful to write down every word of testimony. “I say, ‘But when a man’s on trial for his life / isn’t every word important?’” (84)\n\nThe search for truth is the heart of Jen Bryant’s novel told in free verse. After her experiences, Katie is disillusioned with the American Justice System and says that “…everything used to lay out so neatly, / everything seemed / pretty clear and straight. / Now all the streets run slantwise / and even the steeples look crooked.” (151)\n\nAs in Ringside 1925, the novel ends with an epilogue and a reflection on “reasonable doubt,” media, and “the complexities of human behavior” and will lead to important classroom conversations, not about the trial, but about justice.\n\n-----\n\nThe True History of Lyndie B. Hawkins by Gail Shepherd\n\nThis story of 11-year-old Lyndie Baines covers a lot of territory, but it is primarily about truth and the effect of lies or sometimes just not knowing the truth. The novel also shares the effects of war on those who serve, their families, and their communities.\n\nLyndie’s father, his friends, and neighbors served in the war in Viet Nam. Some never returned, some returned with physical scars, and others, like Lyndie’s dad, returned with psychological scars, scars which affect their families and lives.\n\nLyndon Baines (yes, named after that Lyndon Baines), an avid student of history, knows this isn’t particular to the Viet Nam conflict; she has read many letters written by Civil War soldiers. She doesn’t realize just how damaged her father is, but she suspects that he and her mother, a former activist who now stays in her bedroom with constant headaches, are not quite okay. “I don’t think my parents know how to head us in the right direction” (24).\n\nLyndie struggles in her school, where she doesn’t fit in; she struggles in her new home with her parents, Grandpa Tad, her proper Southern grandmother Lady, to whom keeping family secret private and keeping to schedules is primary, even when the family needs help and even if perpetually-grounded Lyddie needs a normal childhood; and she struggles with the type of person she wants to be—more like her altruistic best friend Dawn. She is a fighter, but she also cares about things deeply.\n\nAnd then D.B. enters the picture, a former foster child released from a juvenile detention center to live with Dawn’s family, at least for the school year. Lyndie decides she needs to save D.B. despite her father’s words, “Take care, what you lend your heart to” (73). Through her relationship with D.B., Lyndie learns that things are not always what they seem—with him, with Pee Wee, with her family.\n\nWhen things come to a crisis on her twelfth birthday, Lyndie has to take steps to expose the truth, “’No,’ I correct myself. We’re not okay. Not really.’” (267) and make things right—for her, her family, and D.B., putting all the scraps together.\n\n-----\n\nTorch by Lyn Miller-Lachmann\n\n“THEY had all the power. There was no such thing as fairness in their world.” (19)\n\nThere is so much world history of which many of us, especially our adolescent readers, are unaware. Novelists, such as Lyn Miller-Lachmann, can teach us this history while making it come alive, putting human faces on the many who dies and survived during this time.\n\nOn August 21, 1968, the Soviet Union and three other Communist regimes—Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria—invaded Czechoslovakia. The new wave of repression that followed saw the withdrawal of freedoms, mass firings, expulsions from the Party, the imprisonment of dissidents, and the closing of the borders. (Author’s Note)\n\nTaking place from December 1968 to Summer 1969, Torch is a story of not only a time in history but resilience, freedoms, resistance, creativity, family, and, above all, friendship.\n\nWhen Pavol finds his dreams of attending university in Prague have been ended by the Party, and he faces a life in the mines that killed his father, he and his friends Stepan and Tomas write a letter to be delivered to the castle in Prague. When he and Stepan are stopped and sent away, Pavol follows the example of martyr Jan Palach and sets himself on fire, a human torch.\n\nReaders see how not only the increasing restrictive and punitive government’s actions but also Pavol’s actions affect his pregnant girlfriend Lydia; Ondrej, her father, a WWII freedom fighter; his friends Stepan and Tomas; and his mother and three younger sisters.\n\n“Pavol’s death hadn’t changed anything. One by one, the reformers in the government had been fired and replaced, not even a figurehead remaining. Every proclamation announced ‘normalization’: the return to dictatorship. The censorship was tighter than ever.” (161)\n\nStepan, a former bully who had been transformed through his friendship with—and maybe a crush on—the kind Pavol, is the star player of his high school hockey team and dreams of a hockey scholarship and eventually the Olympics, but lets the poetry and life of Walt Whitman guide him. Instead of moving toward his goals, he is beaten, arrested, imprisoned, and finally sent to work for the State in the worst conditions.\n\nTomas, always socially awkward—“He was so much better with problem sets and the grammar of foreign languages than with people (31), Pavol was his first real friend. Tomas’ father, Comrade Kuchar, was high in the Party and sent his son to youth leadership classes and camp, calling him “antisocial” and threatening to send him to a mental hospital when he turned 18.\n\nLydia lived in the woods with her father who moved them frequently and in the middle of the night; she worked in the shoe factory without much hope for a future until she fell in love with Pavol giving her hopes to live in Prague and her own chance to finish her education. After his death, she found she was pregnant with his child which gives her even less opportunities. When she finds out that her father is dying, she plans an escape to Austria, hoping to encourage Stepan and even Tomas to join her.\n\nThese characters became real and got under my skin as I returned to them each day of reading, feeling their pain and frustrations and cheering any victories. One reason is that they formed unlikely bonds with each other as they began trying to cheer each other on to lives with freedoms. This novel belongs in high school World History classes to expand our knowledge of the people in our world.\n\n-----\n\nTropical Secrets: Holocaust Refugees in Cuba by Margarita Engle\n\nI have read many diverse Holocaust novels and memoirs set in Europe but have never read about the Jews who sought refuge in Cuba (other than passengers of the St. Louis, most of whom were turned away). In her novel Tropical Secrets, Engle shares the stories of Daniel, a young boy who is a Gernan Jewish refugee, unwittingly arriving in Cuba in 1939. It is also the story of Paloma, a Catholic native who is surviving a mother who left and a father who is profiting from the refugees, and David, also a Jewish refugee but from the pogroms, both serving as Daniel’s (and the readers’) “guides” to island life.\n\nI found the verse to grow smoother and more lyrical as David (and I) adapts to Cuban culture--\n\ncreating an entirely new\n\nsort of music,\n\nthe sound of a future\n\ndancing with the past.\n\nWhile this book also serves as a window into another time, another culture, it also served as a mirror for me. I grew up with friends whose parents were victims of the Holocaust and I have lived in communities where they eat pigs and shellfish and felt as the “other.”\n\nThis book is even more relevant today as xenophobia grows, no longer allocated to specific places or times. It is important that our children learn\n\nA refugee,\n\nnot a spy.\n\nStill, there is the terror\n\nof being questioned\n\nby police …\n\nit will help them\n\nunderstand\n\nthat those who feel safe today\n\ncould be the ones in need of refuge\n\ntomorrow\n\n-----\n\nUnbound: A Novel in Verse by Ann E. Burg\n\nConsidering history through novels lets the reader experience, and make sense of, history through the perspective of those most affected by historic events, getting to know them as real people—their hopes, desires, ambitions.\n\nAnn Burg’s verse novel Unbound does just that. The story invites the reader into the hearts and thoughts of the characters, especially the main character, Grace, a young slave in the 1860’s. Grace, who has light skin and blue eyes, lives with her Mama, her two young half-brothers and their father Uncle Jim, and old Aunt Sara who helped raise her. When she is called to work in the Big House, her Mama warns her to keep her eyes down, ”to always be good, to listen to the Missus, n never talk back…n not to speak less spoken to first,” (3)\n\nObserving the heartless Master and hateful Missus, Grace can’t help but question why they can’t do anything for themselves “Why do grown folks / need help getting dressed?” (91) She wonders why Aunt Tempie silently ignores the unfairness and abuse, “Things’ll change, Grace / maybe even sooner’n later / but till thy do—‘ (91) and why Anna and Jordon have to bear beatings and mistreatment. Reading the Missus’ words and threats is more chilling than reading about the treatment by slaveowners in textbooks.\n\nEventually Grace angers the Missus, “You are nothing but a slave / who needs to learn her place.” (204), and when Jordan runs away and the Master needs the money to replace him, the Missus suggests selling Grace’s family. Grace recognizes that they also need to run away: “Not sure where my place is / but I know it’s not / the Big House.” (204), and they leave in the middle of the night. Helped by OleGeorgeCooper and others, they have to decide whether to go north or go deep. And even though Grace has a chance for passing as white and “a chance / of escaping for real / of livin like the good Lord / intended folks to live. / [She] has a chance to own herself…”(212-3), the family decides to stay together.\n\nThey travel through the treacherous swamp, but as OleGeorgeCooper tells them, “There’s nothing in the swamp / what’s worse’n / the stink / of bein a slave.” (261), and as they move through, “[Grace] feels part / of another world, / a beautiful world, / A world / what whispers ‘ Freedom.” (271)\n\nSafe (relatively) and free in a settlement in the Great Daniel Swamp, Grace explains to her new friend Brooklyn, another runaway, “Everyone’s got a way of mattering. / The only thing / what doesn’t matter / is what color / the good Lord paints us.” (336)\n\nWell-researched and written in dialect, this is an inspiring story of the maroons, enslaved people seeking freedom in the wilderness.\n\n-----\n\nUprising by Jennifer A. Nielsen\n\n“Then we need more people on the side of good,’ I said. “Let me help. I want to join the resistance.”\n\n“No.” Ryszard’s tone was as firm as ever.\n\nAs soon as he left my room, I opened the wood block of my window and peered down into the ghetto. The Jews inside there were planning something, I was sure of it. They knew they had upset the Nazis and that before long, the Nazis would return. They were getting ready.\n\nI was going to help them. One way or another, I was making myself part of the resistance. (ARC 148-9)\n\nOn September 1, 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland. Lidia Durr was twelve years old when the bombing began; her father left to join the war and fight on the eastern front, Warsaw surrendered, and the schools, libraries, and museums in Poland were closed. “Piece by piece, the Nazis were dismantling everything it was to be Polish…The Nazis would accept us only in one of two ways: either as Germans, or as dead.” (57)\n\nLidia’s family house in Warsaw is taken and, a dedicated musician, Lidia and her family are forced to leave their home —and her beloved piano—and move to the one-bedroom apartment of their Jewish maid Doda and her mother, Bubbe, where they lived on the one can of soup per day Lidia’s mother earned. When the Warsaw Ghetto is built behind the apartment, Doda and Bubbe were imprisoned with the other Jews of the city.\n\nWith her new best friend Lidia smuggles food to the inhabitants of the ghetto and attends a hidden school, keeping it a secret from her mother. From her window she witnesses the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising which spurs her to action.\n\nEven though her brother Ryszard works as a builder for the Nazis, Lidia suspects that he is a member of the resistance, and Lidia joins herself, advancing from messenger, smuggling messages and weapons throughout Warsaw, to a trusted fighter. Taking an active part in the Warsaw City Uprising in which 150,000 to 250,000 Polish civilians were killed (Author’s Note), she joins in with everything she has, knowing that she may be giving her life to free Poland.\n\n“Nothing can be done about any of this, dear. Better that you learn to ignore what’s happening around us.”\n\n“No. that would not be better at all. Easier, maybe, but I wasn’t interested in easy. I cared about what was right.” (ARC 193)\n\nWritten in first person narrative, readers follow Lidia and her fellow resistance fighters from 1939-1944 through one harrowing moment and heroic action to the next, leaning what it is to have courage, dependability, and devotion to a cause. One of the most effective ways to learn about any historical event, and the nuances and effects of those events, is through novel study—the power of story. Reading Jennifer Nielsen’s newest historical (biographical) fiction novel, readers grades 5 and up will learn history through the story of a person their age who lived it.\n\n-----\n\nWe Were the Fire: Birmingham 1963 by Sheila P. Moses\n\n“On May 2, 1963, more than one thousand students skipped classes and gathered at Sixth Street Baptist Church to march to downtown Birmingham, Alabama. As they approached police lines, hundreds were arrested and carried off to jail in paddy wagons and school buses. When hundreds more young people gathered the following day for another march, white commissioner, Bull Connor, directed the local police and fire departments to use force to halt the demonstration. Images of children being blasted by high-pressure fire hoses, being clubbed by police officers, and being attacked by police dogs appeared on television and in newspapers, and triggered outrage throughout the world. Despite the violence, children continued to march and protest in an organizing action now known as the Children’s Crusade.” (National Museum of African American History & Culture)\n\nI am just now learning the history I should have been taught in my years in school, thankful for the novels, memoirs, and authors which have become my guides. One of the most important of these is Sheila P. Moses’ upcoming novel We Were the Fire: Birmingham 1963, a Civil Rights story for upper elementary and middle-grade readers. This is the story of one fictional child crusader and his family and friends, but it is also the story of thousands of other real children on the days from May 2-4, 1963.\n\nTwelve-year-old Rufus Jackson Jones Jr. was born and grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, the place Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called the most segregated place in the country. (1)\n\nHis Daddy having died in an accident at the mill when he was 9 year old, Rufus lives with his Mama and his younger sister Georgia in Bull Hill. The neighborhood is run by a slumlord. I knew [Mama] was tired of our house and all that came with it. hauling water from the well. Tired of sharing an outhouse with other families and having to pour bleach and scatter lavender into the toilet hole every day so it would not smell so bad. Tired of our wash freezing outside on the clothesline… (28)\n\nWhen Mama remarries, they are offered a house by, and next to, the white mill owner, Miss Boone. “Somebody got to be the first or second person to move into these white neighborhoods. Integration is hard, but someone got to do it. We going to be the second to move to Ivy Town, Daddy Paul looked at us. “Do y’all know what integration means?” (22) Every day Miss Boone drives the children to their school and, despite a cross being burned on their yard, manages to keep them (and herself) protected.\n\nDaddy Paul, Uncle Sam, and their friends begin attending meetings at night to organize a peaceful march to City Hall. “We need to change things. I want you and the other children to live in a different kind of Birmingham than the one I was raised in. A free Birmingham.” (53-54)\n\nThe children make plans to join the march in Kelly Park We wanted our rights just like the white children. We were young, but we understood that Bull Connor was wrong. We understood that having to walk through the back doors just to get ice cream was wrong. We wanted to walk and live and get educated where we wanted. We wanted to be free. (73) I wanted my little sister to have a doll that looked like her. I wanted her to go to the amusement park one day. (133)\n\nWith their teachers’ blessings, the students leave school. “When I turned around, I could see more children behind us than I could count.” (126) And, as the police load up school buses with children to take them to jail, even more arrive. “The children of Birmingham could not be stopped!” (127) Even after being jailed, clubbed, blasted with fire hoses, and bitten by police dogs, the children return to Kelly Park for a second and third days of marching and singing. When the firemen first turn on their hoses, Rufus realizes, “We were the fire!”\n\nOn May 4, safe back at home, Rufus wishes on a star, “I wished for a better world for all of us. Where we’re all treated the same.” (152)\n\nThis is a novel for all upper elementary and middle grade classrooms and could be read in ELA or Social Studies classes.\n\nReading this short novel reminds me of the Soweto Riots. “On 16 June 1976 between 3000 and 10 000 students mobilized by the South African Students Movement's Action Committee supported by the BCM marched peacefully to demonstrate and protest against the government’s directive. The march was meant to culminate at a rally in Orlando Stadium. On their pathway they were met by heavily armed police who fired teargas and later live ammunition on demonstrating students. This resulted in a widespread revolt that turned into an uprising against the government. While the uprising began in Soweto, it spread across the country and carried on until the following year.” (South African History Online). In this way We Were the Fire and other middle-grade Civil Rights novels, such as The Watsons Go to Birmingham—1963, can be paired with Sheila Gordon’s Waiting for the Rain and Beverly Naidoo‘s novel Journey to Jo’burg and Out of Bounds, her book of short stories that take readers through the decades of Apartheid.\n\n-----\n\nWords on Fire by Jennifer A. Nielsen\n\n​\n\n“How do you destroy a people? You take away their culture. And how is that done? You must take their language, their history, their very identity. How would you do that?”I pressed my lips together, then looked up at her. “You ban their books.” (78)\n\nJennifer A. Nielsen’s novel takes place during the Russian occupation of Lithuania (1795-1918), specifically the time period between June and November 1893. After the January Uprising of 1863-1864, there was a forty-year ban on the Lithuanian language, press, and books. Young adolescent Audra lives on a farm with her parents and is illiterate—by choice. She chooses not to go to school or learn to read or write. When her parents are arrested and their house burned, Audra, who describes herself as “the girl who watched life from afar but rarely participated” (2) escapes, having been entrusted by her parents with a package to deliver. When she finds out that they risked their lives to deliver merely a book, she is dismayed.\n\nThrough her new friends—Lukas, Ben, and Milda, who are book smugglers like her parents—Audra learns to read, to write, and the importance of books to her people and to preserve her culture, and she willingly becomes a book smuggler, even again the wishes of these new friends who fear for her safety. “I’d seen a glimpse of myself as I wished to be, a reflection of who I might become if I allowed courage to enter my heart, or ideas to enter my head…. When I imagined the girl I wanted to be, it was the girl who smuggled books.” (111-112)\n\nConstantly in danger, Audra becomes inventive, using her father’s magic and her awakening sense of story to evade and escape the Cossacks. She has complicated decisions to make as she tries to save both her parents from prison in Siberia, but at the same time, her new friends and herself. And the books.\n\n​\n\nA novel of adventure, danger, courage, secrets, ideas and ideals, and strong adolescent characters “honoring the knygnesiai—the book carriers, who are among the true heroes of Lithuanian history” (Author Acknowledgments). Words on Fire is another story that teaches a part of history we seldom study.\n\n-----\n\nYour Heart—My Sky: Love in a Time of Hunger by Margarita Engle\n\nI began learning about the history of Cuba through Cuban-American poet Margarita Engle’s memoir, Enchanted Sky. I continued my study, learning more Cuban history through the stories of Tula, The Lightning Dreamer: Cuba’s Greatest Abolitionist; though the story of Rosa in The Surrender Tree: Poems of Cuba’s Struggle for Freedom; with Daniel, one of the Holocaust refugees in Cuba in Tropical Secrets; and the story of Fefa (based on Engle’s grandmother) in The Wild Book. But there is still more history to learn.\n\nYour Heart—My Sky: Love In The Time Of Hunger introduced me to a different, more contemporary era, “el period especial en tiempos de paz.” The government’s name for the 1990s is “the special period in times of peace,” but in reality is a period of extreme hunger resulting from the loss of Soviet aid, the US trade embargo, and the government prohibition of the growing, buying, and selling of agricultural products. Even though the 1991 Pan Am Games are being held in Havana, where visitors and athletes are sure to find food, the people in the towns face starvation, their food rations reduced even more.\n\nNo witnesses.\n\nWe are like an outer isle\n\nOff the shore of another island.\n\nForgotten. (3)\n\nMy parents quietly call it tourist apartheid.\n\nEverything for outsiders.\n\nNothing for islanders.” (Liana, 6)\n\nReaders are introduced to the disastrous effects of these policies on the citizens through the three narrators: Liana, Amado, and the Singing Dog who serves as a matchmaker between, and a guard of, the two adolescents.\n\nLiana and Amado are both rebels in their own ways: Liana skips la escuela al campo “a summer of forced so-called-volunteer farm labor,” possibly giving up college or a government-assigned tolerable job, spending her days looking for food. Amado has made a pact with his brother who is in jail for speaking against the government. He is worried that he won’t be able to keep his promise to avoid the mandatory military service—“men have to serve in the reserves until they’re fifty”—and promote peace, possibly joining his brother in prison.\n\nMaybe I should let myself be trained to kill,\n\nbecome a soldier, gun-wielding, violent,\n\na dangerous stranger, no longer\n\nme. (Amado, 24)\n\nIn beautiful lyrical verse, lines that caused me to re-read and savor, Liana and Amado meet and fall in love,\n\nThe pulse in my mind wanders away\n\nFrom hunger, toward something I can barely name.\n\nA spark\n\nof wishlight\n\non the dark horizon’s\n\noceanic warmth. (Liana, 35)\n\nLiana meets Amado’s grandparents who are growing vegetables and fruits in hidden gardens, and she is given seeds to start her own gardens. She dreams of starting a kitchen restaurant.\n\nEverything has changed inside our minds\n\nSo that we are intensely aware of our ability\n\nTo seize control of hunger,\n\nTransforming food\n\nInto freedom. (110)\n\nAmado and Liana help fleeing refugees, even though\n\nLeaving the island is forbidden by law\n\nAnd it is equally illegal\n\nTo know that someone is planning to flee. (95)\n\nWhen Amado receives a note from his brother releasing him from their pact, he secretly plans their rafting escape. But the indecision brought about by the precariousness of the trip cause them to reconsider.\n\nAll we have in our shared hearts\n\nis one imaginary raft--\n\nHow shall we use it?\n\nClimb aboard or set it loose,\n\nLet that alternate future\n\ndrift away? (Liana and Amado, 197)\n\nA beautiful story of a terrible time in Cuban history and two resilient families connected by love (and a singing dog).\n\nLearning about the Events of September 11, 2001, through Story\n\nNo historical event may be as unique and complicated to discuss and teach as the events of September 11, 2001, the day terrorists crashed planes into, and destroyed, the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. At the time of this event no child in our present K-12 educational system was yet born, but, in most cases, their parents and educators would have been old enough to have some knowledge of, and even personal experience with, these events, making this a very difficult historic event for many to teach. However, with the devastation and impact of these events on our past, present, and future and as ingrained a part of history these events are, they need to be discussed and understood as much as possible.\n\nAgain, an effective way to learn about these events are through story. There are powerful novels that have been written about this tragedy, for all age levels and, fascinatingly, each presents a different perspective of the events. Some take place during September 11, some following the events, some a few years later or many years later, and a few include two timelines. Many take place from the perspectives of multiple characters.\n\nOn September 11, 2021 YA Wednesday posted my guest-blog “Novels, Memoirs, Graphics, and Picture Books to Commemorate September 11th,\" my 4th blog on novels covering these events. In this blog I interviewed authors and reviewed (or re-reviewed) and recommended 24 texts and six picture books.\n\nI have taught a unit on NINE ELEVEN through book clubs in multiple schools from grades 5 through 9 in both ELA and Social Studies classes. Children and adolescents have felt comfortable these sensitive and challenging concepts and examining these troubling events, and some of the ensuing difficulties, prejudices, and bullying, through the eyes of characters who are around their ages, some readers sharing personal stories in their small collaborative groups. I am thankful for the authors who have allowed our children to experience these events in a safe and compassionate way. I have presented these novels and strategies and lessons for reading through book clubs at local workshops and national conferences. I included my 9/11 Book Club unit as a chapter in TALKING TEXTS: A Teacher’s Guide To Book Clubs Across The Curriculum.\n\nSee my interviews with eight of these authors on my blog for YA Wednesday \"Novels, Memoirs, Graphics, and Picture Books to Commemorate September 11th.\"\n\n-----\n\n9-11: The World’s Finest Comic Book Writers and Artists Tell Stories to Remember.
