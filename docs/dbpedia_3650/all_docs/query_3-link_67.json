        "meta_description": "La ville a indéniablement perdu l’attrait mythologique qu’elle avait pour les écrivains modernistes. Pourtant, elle n’a pas totalement disparu de la fiction américaine récente. Elle pourrait être considérée, de manière concrète, comme l’environnement où s’inscrit l’expérience d’un quartier spécifique ou comme un lieu de transaction transculturelle (en particulier dans les romans récents consacrés aux communautés ethniques) mais aussi, de manière abstraite, comme le signe visible de forces invisibles qui simultanément transcendent et absorbent la ville dans des romans où semble se perpétuer la tradition moderniste du sublime urbain. Cet article s’intéresse à plusieurs romans contemporains où la ville est à la fois représentée comme localement concrète et globalement abstraite—comme un espace d’expérience sensuelle mais aussi comme un référent sémiotique où se rencontrent des forces nouvelles et désincarnées. De même que Dos Passes explorait les \"merveilles\" du sublime urbain dans Manhattan Transfer, ces romans—Lookout Cartridge de Joseph McElroy et Cosmopolis de Don DeLillo—entretiennent et transforment à la fois la tradition moderniste en révélant les possibilités et les limites d’une nouvelle réalité virtuelle.",

        "text": "8It is Joseph McElroy, however, who converts this new urban technological environment most rigorously into a map of consciousness and conceives of the city as the source of a \"collaborative network\" of experience and (self)reflexion (LeClair/McCaffery 242-43). In the preface to a later edition of his Lookout Cartridge, he calls his huge (and hugely complex) novel of 1974 \"a tale of two cities [New York and London]\", narrated \"between these densely-inside-out-described, different but eerily composed spaces\" (n.p.). And yet, it would be difficult to call Lookout Cartridge a city novel. Metropolitan space is nevertheless present as a closely observed and densely described cityscape (as map and maze) that also extends into the structures of new media: the circuits of film, television and computer. Or, to phrase it differently, McElroy imagines the novel as a human-made system analogous to other complex systems such as the city or the computer. \"Their labyrinthine intricacy can bring us to a threshold of ravishment and wonder\", McElroy writes using a metaphor that Dreiser had employed in describing the sublimity of the city of his own experience (Le Clair/McCaffery 244).\n\n9The book projects an intricate narrative system, a network of proliferating and shifting relations. A dynamics of relation drives its action and creates a constant need for re-positioning and re-mapping. \"Lookout Cartridge\", writes McElroy, \"is a journey. But many of its arrivals feel unsettlingly inconclusive.... You are right\", he addresses the reader in the 1985 preface to his novel, \"this book Lookout Cartridge is in motion—multiple motion. Like thinking your way diagonally across a busy city intersection, or into or out of a picture devised by someone else\" (n.p.).\n\n11The novel’s progress is thus defined by the information Cartwright gathers on the fate of his lost film. Yet it is also possible to see the book as following \"a rhythm of gatherings together and dispersions\" (thus McElroy in LeClair/McCaffery 242). The dispersions are connected with Cartwright’s being pushed down the stairs of a New York subway escalator at the beginning of the book. It is the first in a series of pushes (or \"shtips\") which set things in motion. According to Cartwright, they exemplify \"the multiple and parallel sorties which raise our brain above the digital computer to which it is akin\" (477). \"The gatherings\", on the other hand, are associated with a quasi-mystical moment of his Brooklyn childhood when he, leaning out of a high window, caught a baseball, playfully thrown up to him, precisely at the stationary apex of its curve (282). This is the dreamlike \"lookout\" or in-between state which, for Cartwright, is a form of self-empowerment. He seems to achieve this godlike state, if only momentarily, in the hallucinatory tour-de-force of the last chapter, simply called \"Cartridge\", which transforms New York and London into a spatial continuum, gathers persons and information from past and present into a constantly moving and yet strangely disconnected and stationary network of convergence—a \"system of accident\" as it is also called (327)—in which he is center but only one of many and thus part of an open and ever expanding field of interactive consciousness.\n\n12At one point Cartwright thinks of his film as \"lurking on the margins of some unstable, implicit ground that might well shiver into revolution\" (245). \"Revolution\" surely refers to the throes of the sixties, the social tremors of the Vietnam War, but is also linked, throughout the novel, to the cycles of an evolution which contains Maya hieroglyphics, Stonehenge’s undecipherable geometry (\"a Stone Age computer\", 346) as well as the postmodern local/global city of Manhattan over whose bulging grid Cartwright, in the first and the last chapters of the novel, hovers—birdlike—in a helicopter that is on the verge of crashing. The novel appears to imply that these are stages in a constant revolution/evolution of an ever expanding human bodybrain, unfolding modes of consciousness generated through the interplay of the mind with its urban and technological environment. Except that, in a final \"dispersion\", Cartwright’s belief \"in the multiple and collaborative impingement of many systems beyond my own\" (530) suffers a relapse. Accident reigns when the TV-set he helps to throw out of the window of his friend’s apartment in an instinctive act of Luddite \"collaboration\" kills the murderous antagonist waiting for him below.\n\n13The shaping of the mind by structures outside the mind—corporate structures, speech patterns, architectural formations, the rhythmic flow of numbers on the computer screen—is also dominant in DeLillo’s Cosmopolis which I take to be a contemporary re-vision of Dos Passos’ Manhattan Transfer, with New York as the global capital of cyber-finance, of incessant electronic streams of market information. As in Players, the shifting world of urban surfaces is continued in the highly unstable relationship between the novel’s figures. Thus the marriage of the entrepreneurial self-made man Eric Packer, who made an immense fortune by inspired if ruthless currency speculation, seems to consist mainly of a series of casual encounters interlaced with his equally casual sexual involvements with other women. On a day in April 2000 he decides to have his hair cut on the other side of town—a bad idea in the eyes of his bodyguard since not only is the President in the city and are the streets blocked with cars and demonstrations, but there are also anonymous threats against his life. He nevertheless follows his whim and, in his oversized, noise-and bullet-proof white limousine, is driven along 47th Street from East to West, from First to Twelfth Avenue, from rich to poor New York. The limousine is Packer’s mobile office from which he conducts his financial operations. It is electronically connected to the financial movements on the global market as well as to various news channels. He is not only informed of current events in what is for him the only \"real\" world but can also see himself constantly on camera, supervised by his corporation’s invisible control center. On his slow progress west (which begins early in the morning and ends only in the early morning hours of the next day), he receives his daily medical check-up, while his TV screens show pictures of VIPs \"killed live on the money channel\" (33). Around Fifth Avenue the car is stopped by a violent demonstration of anti-globalists, while it also becomes clear that Packer, for once, has miscalculated and is in the process of losing his huge fortune as fast and as abstractly as he had gained it. When he enters New York’s West Side a change of self begins. He gives in to a reckless urge for destruction, accelerates his own financial ruin and pushes the global market toward collapse. In following his new desire for \"the business of living\", he frees himself step by step from the screens protecting his life, turns off his control system, kills his bodyguard. Until he finally receives the wished-for haircut from his childhood barber, but then, at Twelfth Avenue, meets his assassin, a former employee—his failed alter-ego—who shoots him, in uncanny time-reversal, after Packer has seen the image of his own dead body on the electron camera built into his wrist-watch.\n\n16Cosmopolis is focused on one day of the year 2000. It was published, however, in 2003. It is therefore impossible to read it without thinking of that eleventh of September 2001 about which DeLillo, three months later, wrote his essay \"In the Ruins of the Future\". Still traumatized by the event, he embraces the cause of Western civilization by reverting, emphatically, to the rhetoric of urban as technological sublime:\n\n16 Although DeLillo thus seems to underwrite, in the spirit of humanist enlightenment, the dominant na (...)\n\nTechnology is our fate, our truth... The materials and methods we devise make it possible for us to claim our future. We don’t have to depend on God or the prophets or other astonishments. We are the astonishment. The miracle is what we ourselves produce, the systems and networks that change the way we live and think. But whatever great skeins of technology lie ahead, ever more complex, connective, precise, micro-fractional, the future has yielded, for now, to medieval experience, to the slow furies of cut-throat religion. (The Guardian 6)\n\n18Both writers have explored the manners of thinking, speaking and behaving under the conditions of the \"new and fluid reality\" of a digital technology that has absorbed (and is thus also continued in) the urban scene. In this, they are still tied to Dos Passos’s highly ambivalent admiration for the \"wonders\" of a world of our own making; and, like Dos Passos, they also project the knowledge of the price paid for these wonders into the wish of their protagonists to escape the symmetries of abstract systems and to acknowledge the physical concreteness of their mortal bodies."
