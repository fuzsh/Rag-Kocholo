        "text": "Flood. Deluge. Squall. Gale. Tempest. Cyclone. Hurricane. Typhoon. Tsunami.\n\nHowever you want to record it, EXTREME WATER EVENTS are terrible things. They are costly, destructive, and worst of all, deadly. I would prefer they exist only as fictional fodder in the pages of a book, or in the form of an illustration on its covers, and never in the real world. But they do exist in the real world, and they are increasing in intensity and numbers at a rate that should be alarming to all of us.\n\nWhen I was a seasonal worker for the Colorado State Forest Service, I participated in the cleanup and restoration of the Big Thompson Canyon after its historic flash flood of July 31, 1976. It claimed the lives of 144 people and caused tens of millions of dollars in property damage. It was thought at the time to be a \"once in a hundred year event.\" But thirty-seven years later, on September 11-12, 2013, it happened again, only this time it wasn't a freak flash flood but an increasingly heavy downpour that went beyond the Big Thompson Canyon, covering more than 4,500 square miles from Boulder to just over the Wyoming border. The flood damage was estimated at 4 billion dollars. Unbelievably, only nine people were killed this time around.\n\nBut so much for that old, \"once every hundred years,\" theory.\n\nNow of course we know exactly what is causing some of the extreme water events that have taken place in the 21st century. It's climate change. And not surprisingly, we have only ourselves to blame for it. If we don't get smart right now and make the necessary changes that are absolutely required to stop the Earth's temperature from rising, we will continue to face more and more extreme water events, and every other type of extreme weather event that the elements can deliver. And so will our children. And their children too.\n\nBut don't take my word for it, listen to what the science is saying:\n\n\"Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convert land from forests to agriculture. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, people have burned more and more fossil fuels and changed vast areas of land from forests to farmland. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It is called a greenhouse gas because it produces a “greenhouse effect”. The greenhouse effect makes the earth warmer, just as a greenhouse is warmer than its surroundings. Carbon dioxide is the main cause of human-induced global warming and associated climate change. It is a very long-lived gas, which means carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere with ongoing human emissions and remains in the atmosphere for centuries. Global warming can only be stopped by reducing global emissions of carbon dioxide from human fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes to zero, but even with zero emissions, the global temperature will remain essentially constant at its new warmer level. Emissions of other substances that warm the climate must also be substantially reduced. This indicates how difficult the challenge is.\" --- CANADIAN GOVERNMENT Climate Assessment, 2023.\n\n\"Given the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth’s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means a significant increase in accumulated heat. That extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals—expanding some and shrinking others. Most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\" --- NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Climate Assessment, 2023.\n\n\"The future is made of the same stuff as the present.\"\n\n--- Simone Weil\n\nALL THAT BEING SAID, the books featured below were all written and illustrated in the 20th century, back when extreme water events were considered to be just a normal part of the natural cycle of weather, or Earth's mutability, or else the product of someone's incompetence, negligence, or criminal behavior.\n\nYou know, a simpler time in history when flood insurance was actually affordable.\n\nHigh Water was published in hardcover by Little Brown & Company in 1954. The jacket art depicts a rescue taking place on the rooftop of a flooded Mississippi River home, and was produced by one of the 20th century's most prolific book cover illustrators, Barye Phillips (1905-1968). Phillips was such an accomplished illustrator during his 30 plus years as a professional that I have no doubt he inspired countless others to follow in his footsteps.\n\nRichard Bissell (1913-1977) was a Harvard graduate and the author of twelve books, a mix of fiction and non-fiction alike. Allegedly, after college he was able to \"secure a mate's and pilot's license--both all tonnage--on the Upper Mississippi and Monongahela rivers, the only author so licensed since Mark Twain.\" I guess you could say Bissel was following in the footsteps of greatness too.\n\n\"At about two miles an hour and mostly less the Royal Prince pulled out of St. Louis and started shoving a tow of eight coal barges upriver. And with all the water out of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa coming down the valley, the crew was in no happy mood: FIRST MATE DUKE: I have been in floods before and they never bothered me a particle... but we weren't having no big time with this flood.\" CAPTAIN CASEY: \"We are shoving damn poor... and what's more she is steering like we had left the rudders back at St. Louis.\" PILOT IRONHAT: \"Next thing I expect to see is a whole town coming down-river including the courthouse and the depot.\" GREASE CUP, CHIEF ENGINEER: \"We have all got a few bolts loose. We none of us have to be here unless we want to.\" Except Marie Chouteau, who was a refugee they took off a flooded farm house roof: Marie had on just a pair of blue jeans and a lot of mud... MARIE: \"Yeah-- I'm in a hell of a fine shape. The farm is under six feet of water, Maw and Paw and Frank are all drownded... and I'm layin here in a steamboat. Sure, I'm O.K.\" ARKANSAS, DECK HAND: \"That's bad luck, havin a wooman aboard. You look at the record you'll find most always when a boat gets into some trouble or another why there was a wooman aboard.\" With the river working up to flood crest, and with the Captain right away feeling sorry for Marie-- \"it sometimes is a shame the things that can happen...\"\n\nRain of Terror is about an American reporter living in Rome who accepts an assignment in a mountain village to cover a regional flood, one that is still ongoing and has so far killed 32 people. Mix in a half dozen subplots involving murder, art thefts, political power struggles, a troublesome teenage waif, the reporter's clinging lover (the boss' wife wouldn't you know), and a hired killer bent on his demise and you have one hardboiled, convoluted mess of a razor-thin, entertaining disaster novel.\n\nThe powerful cover art by James Meese has our haunted protagonist attempting to rescue his lover from a torrent of water. Meese (1917-1971), who excelled at painting damsels, dames, molls and gumshoes in sometimes intense situations, was in constant demand by paperback houses in the 1950's and 60's, including Gold Medal, which published Rain of Terror in 1959.\n\n\"You pig!\" she shouted. \"I thought you'd been killed!\"\n\nShe stopped. She moved forward and put a hand on his head. \"Darling, I'm sorry. The rain, the floods, all those men dead on the mountain. It's been terrible for you. I wasn't thinking. Forgive me.\"\n\nHe tilted back his head. The hand slid over his forehead and then he was looking into her eyes. He said, \"Your husband's dead, too. I saw him. He's deader than a doornail. He went floating off down the mountainside.\"\n\nHer eyes went a fraction wider. She stared. She shook her head and the tangled, wet hair tumbled around her face. A half-uttered sob died in her throat.\n\nShe whispered, \"Jake, you didn't...\"\n\nThey both sat without moving a muscle.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"Did you?\"\n\nMalcolm Douglas was a pseudonym of Ronald Douglas Sanderson, an Englishman who emigrated to Montreal, Canada in 1947. Sanderson (1920-2002) worked a variety of odd jobs at first, factory worker, waiter, retail clerk, and nightclub singer before finding permanency as a writer/producer for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. His first novel, a literary endeavor written in 1952, failed to find an audience and so he set his sights on writing crime novels instead, ultimately publishing 25 of them in his lifetime. The worldwide settings in his books were often a reflection of his own eventual travel wanderings, from Europe to Africa to America and then back to Europe, where he lived out his remaining days with his wife and kids in Alicante, Spain.\n\nThe Flood was published in hardcover by Hodder and Stoughton of London in 1956. The jacket artist is unknown. John Creasey (1908-1973) was among the most prolific writers in 20th century history, with more than 600 novels published in just under forty years using at least twenty-eight different pseudonyms. In one year alone (1937) he published 29 books. He often spent fourteen hours a day at his typewriter. Several of his fictional characters have become household names to crime fiction fans, such as The Toff, Gideon of Scotland Yard, The Baron, and Doctor Palfrey. Many of his novels were also adapted into radio, film and television. In 1962 he received the Edgar Award for Best Novel (Gideon's Fire), and in 1969 he received the Mystery Writers of America's highest honor, the Grand Master Award.\n\n\"The worst floods that have ever been known start to besiege the world. Islands disappear and Great Britain is on the point of extinction. In a state of National crisis Dr. Palfrey comes to the fore. But he is unable to do anything until he knows the source of the flood. A terrifying and thrilling adventure--all the more frightening because it seems quite possible.\"\n\nHodder published a paperback edition of The Flood in 1958. They used the same art that was on the original hardcover edition, but with the added figure of a woman superimposed over it. By default, paperbacks have always had to strive harder than hardbacks to attract attention.\n\n\"Islands had been disappearing-- under the worst floods ever known. Natural Disasters? Or something much more sinister? Dr. Palfrey was not alone in fearing the latter. Was it mere coincidence that Sir Gabriel Davos, the research chemist, had been in the vicinity of each island before it was overtaken by misery? And what were the mysterious crab-like creatures that had invaded the islands in their thousands? One thing Palfrey did now-- that unless he acted soon, the whole of Great Britain might be threatened. Not merely with floods, but with extinction!\"\n\nHere in America it was Lancer that first published The Flood (1968) in paperback. Not having read the novel I wasn't quite sure what kind of creature was being depicted on the cover so I enlarged it. I still don't know what it is, but a good guess would be some kind of giant octopus (the Octi! Duh!), with a double hog snout for a nose.\n\nAn artist was not credited.\n\n\"Noah and the Ark... At times Dr. Palfrey was willing to admit that the world was less than perfect. He and the agents of Z-5, the international intelligence agency that he headed, had many times saved the world from the forces of darkness... but when the strange water creatures known as the OCTI invaded the land, bringing the powers of an ocean free from the barriers of the shore, it seemed that only the madman who considered himself the new Noah would survive--and with him his insanities, two by two!\"\n\nWhy I failed to recognize the collectibility of the the Blackwater Series when they were first published in paperback by Avon in 1983 is something I can't explain. If I was to try and collect them now it would cost me a small fortune, assuming that I could even find high-grade copies for sale, which I doubt.\n\nMichael McDowell (1950-1999), according to Stephen King and practically everyone else who has ever read his works, was a major genre writing talent, if not literary talent (even if he didn't believe so himself). If I told you what screenplays he also wrote that were made into films and TV episodes you would probably be amazed, even if I think only one of them has actually stood the test of time (hint: it combines Halloween with Christmas). McDowell was also a collector of death memorabilia, and after his passing from Aids in 1999, all seventy-six boxes of his unique collection was donated to Chicago's Northwestern University, where it went on display in 2013. Items included death pins, photographs and plaques from infant caskets, along with a bunch of other macabre things. Weird, to be sure, but from my experience the best writers have always been a little weird.\n\nBlackwater I, The Flood, was published by Avon in 1983 as a paperback original. Volumes II thru V were also published in 1983. The cover art on the series was produced by Wayne Barlowe, who became celebrated among science fiction fans in 1978 for writing and illustrating the outstanding Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials. In 1996 he struck again with his Barlowe's Guide to Fantasy. In between and after he produced literally hundreds of outstanding genre book covers, and he's still at it today.\n\nThe Volume 1 Corgi paperback edition, with its hissing snake, was published in 1985. Although not credited, the cover art is most likely that of Welshman Terry Oakes, one of the United Kingdom's finest artists of the fantastic, with hundreds of jaw-dropping book covers to his credit.\n\n\"Elinor Dammert was rescued from her room in the flood-isolated hotel. What strange mission brought her there? How did she survive her isolation? Why was she in the Alabama town of Perdido that Easter morning in 1919? These questions would never be answered because larger and even more terrifying ones would be asked. She soon would become a strange presence in the wealthy Caskey family and their town. Horror, virtually unspeakable and nearly undescribable, follow.\" --- Avon edition, 1983.\n\nTorrential rains have infiltrated the Broderick copper mine on Hungry Hill, threatening its operation. In an effort to halt the water a hole is blown in the side of the mine to divert the water away from the shaft. Water then roars down the road engulfing everything in its path. A carriage occupied by the flame-haired Fanny Rosa and her young friend Jane is caught unawares in the torrent, overturning. John Broderick, Fanny's brazen husband, is seen here carrying his wife to safety. Don't even ask about poor little Jane.\n\nWalter Baumhofer is the artist who produced the manly rescue scene on the cover of the 1951 Cardinal paperback edition of Hungry Hill, Daphne du Maurier's bestselling Irish family saga, though he wasn't the first to illustrate her novel. Among the notables that have are; Hugo Steiner-Prag, Bernard D'Andrea, Harry Bennett, Renato Fratini, Clark Raymond, Gene Szafran, and Fred Pfeiffer. Those names notwithstanding, Baumhofer is still a giant in the field of illustration and fine art. He provided pulp magazine covers and interior illustrations for decades, including and especially Doc Savage, before moving on to paperbacks, the slicks and art galleries.\n\n\"When Fanny-Rosa Flower married young John Brodrick, she brought a reckless train into the smug Brodrick blood. From this combination of opposing temperaments all of their troubles flowed. Here is the powerful story of the destiny that engulfed them. Here is the unforgettable drama of men and women who lived and loved with all the passionate wildness of the Irish country that surrounded them.\"\n\nI've not been able to find one drop of information about the British book illustrator D. Brook. That he or she was a prolific cover artist is obvious, but only if you happen to be familiar with the written works of Elinor M. Brent-Dyer, one of the United Kingdom's most beloved authors of children literature. Brent-Dyer wrote more than a hundred books during her lifetime (1894-1969), which included the popular Chalet School series, all 57 volumes, set among the beautiful Tyrolean Alps. Brook illustrated dozens of her books throughout the 1950's and 60's for publisher W. & R. Chambers Ltd., and also for the other authors that they held in tow. It's a body of artwork that is as admirable in its accomplishment as it is just plain fun to look at. (Expect a post on Brook in the future, or the Chalet series itself).\n\nThe Chalet School and Richenda was published by Chambers in 1958. The story is typical for this series aimed at teens: A young girl, Richenda Fry, is sent to the Chalet School as punishment for disregarding her father's instructions. She is quickly welcomed though, losing her sulkiness in the process, and with the help of her new school chums she finally makes amends with her deeply agitated father. A happy ending yes, but before we get to that Richenda and her friends are nearly drowned in a flooded river.\n\nThis is a solid cover illustration that I came across one day depicting what looks to be a flooded schoolhouse, or house anyway, according to its title, The House in the Floods. The novel was published by Blackie & Son of London in 1942. The only information about its author, Norah Pulling, that I could find was that she wrote maybe a half of dozen children's books between the 1940's and 50's. The jacket art was produced by Inez Topham, a prolific British illustrator of juvenile books during the 1930's, 40's and 50's, about whom very little has been written about.\n\nCLICK ON IMAGE TO ENLARGE\n\nTrying to describe in detail the many themes, or plot devices, in Nevil Shute's In the Wet, would probably take up more space than I am willing to commit, so here's an abridgment: Alcoholism, opium-addiction, disease, adventure, romance, sailing, flying, religion, reincarnation, soul-transference, extra-sensory-perception, futurism, democracy, voting-rights, nationalism, socialism, classism, racialism, a bomb (on a plane, of course), and oh yes, the Commonwealth and the English Monarchy. Oh, and I almost forgot---monsoon rains. That's what's coming down on the cover of the 1953 U.K. hardcover first edition published by William Heinemann.\n\nThe jacket art was produced by Val Biro (1921-2014). Biro was a Hungarian, but on the eve of WWII his father sent him to England to study art. He never left the Isles after that and became an extremely prolific illustrator of books for children and adults alike, and on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nBallantine published this paperback edition of In the Wet in 1964. Their cover art was not credited, but I believe it could be the work of Robert Blanchard. Blanchard (1914-1993) was born in Massachusetts and learned to draw at the Worcester Art Museum. While serving in the Coast Guard during WWII he was sent to work on films in support the war effort at Disney. After the war he found work in NYC as an illustrator and Art Director for several publishing companies. In the late 1950's he began to produce cover art for Ballantine Books. He is noted today primarily for his fine art paintings, many of which are abstract, which he continued to produce well into his retirement.\n\n\"Woven into the richly dramatic background of Australia today, \"the wet\", is a story of tomorrow-- where the tensely moving love of an Australian flyer for an English girl has to take second place to a loyalty of the future that threatens to engulf their love and their lives.\"\n\nTaken at the Flood is a novel that was first published in hardcover by Macmillan in 1957. The jacket art was produced by the aforementioned Val Biro. George Woodman based his story on the North Sea Flood which struck the East Coast of England on January 31, 1953 (as well as coastal areas in Scotland, Belgium and the Netherlands). The flood was borne by a combination of high spring tide, low pressure, and a severe windstorm over the North Sea. The storm tide rose 18 feet above sea level, crashing inland. Sea walls were breached in more than one-thousand places, inundating 250 square miles and forcing more than 30,000 people from their homes. 307 lives were lost in England alone (hundreds more at sea and in neighboring countries). According to the paperback blurb, Woodman, was \"well qualified to write this novel for he was living in a house backing on the beach at Whitstable when the great flood of 1953 struck the town. He still lives there.\"\n\nStorm is not George Stewart's most famous novel, but that doesn't make it any less impactful. Told from multiple points of view, it is the story of a massive Pacific cyclone slamming into the West Coast of the United States, and of the twelve tense days leading up to it (each day a chapter in the book). The main protagonist is not human however, but rather the storm itself. And she has a name---Maria!\n\nPenguin published the first mass-marked paperback edition in 1944, under its 'Infantry Journal' imprint. It was one of the first paperbacks that was issued with a protective jacket (seen top), a practice that didn't last long (the art on the inner cover, seen lower, is uncredited). The jacket artist was Denver Laredo Gillen. The Vancouver, Canada, born Gillen (1914-1975) came up the usual way, rendering catalog illustrations for clients like The Hudson Bay Company and Montgomery Ward. Then things picked up for him and he began to produce book covers for some of the biggest publishers in New York. In addition, he began providing illustrations for slicks like the The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, Esquire, True and Outdoor Life, among others. He also established a long, lucrative association with Reader's Digest Condensed Books.\n\n\"Storm is the absorbing story of \"Maria,\" a tropical hussy, a raging hurricane, that cannonballed out of Asia, swept across the Pacific and cracked down on the whole coast of Western United States. Author George R. Stewart tells how hussies like \"Maria\" are made-- what they do to people. He takes you into the heart of the men who run the San Francisco Weather Bureau-- it was one of them who named the STORM \"Maria.\" With Superintendent Martley you crawl down a 250-foot ladder into the bottom of a great dam to release the sluice gates-- only to find on your return to the top that the raging water is out of hand, breaking over the rim... how will you get out alive? Storm will be one of the big adventures of your life! Don't wait! Buy it now! And read every single one of its 310 complete and unabridged pages in this edition!\"\n\nComstock, an outdoor or nature themed imprint of Ballantine Books, republished Storm in paperback in 1974. Walter Rane (1949-) produced the cover art, which shows a dam overflowing with storm surge water. Storm was one of Rane's first commissions, and he would go on to be an extremely productive, high quality cover artist for more than twenty years in New York City. Today he creates mostly fine art paintings, usually along religious themes. The LDS church has become one of his mainstay clients.\n\n\"Sweeping across the Pacific, a devastating storm wreaks havoc on San Francisco and the California coast and then moves relentlessly toward the Sierra Nevada, burying mountain passes and railroad tracks under tons of snow. First published in 1941, Storm presaged trends in literature and ecology that would appear decades later; an engrossing novel constructed by a master storyteller, it delineates an intricate web of humanity, wildlife, and landscape, all interacting in a drama that includes the weather itself in its cast of characters.\"\n\nThe title of this novel tells us the what, but not the why. For that all we need to do is look at the jacket art by John Woods and think of what would happen if that dam failed. Woods was a British book illustrator and comic book illustrator who thrived from the 1930's to the 1980's. He was also a contributing artist on several cool Dr. Who book publications: The Dalek Book (1964), The Dalek World (1965), and The Dalek Outer Space Book (1966), all of which have fantastic looking covers.\n\nVillage Under Water was published in hardcover by Brockhampton of London in 1953. Eric Leyland (1911-2001) was trained as a librarian and worked for many years as Chief Librarian in Chingford, Essex, Great Britain. After this he became a Joint Principal, together with his wife, of Normanhurst School in Chingford. In his spare time he apparently liked to write books, lots and lots of books. At least 300 of them, or so it's been reported (many under pseudonyms). They were primarily juvenile genre novels, but he also wrote books for adults on occasion.\n\nThe Raging Flood was published by Belmont Tower as a paperback original in 1975. The author, R. T. Larkin, is actually Rochelle Larkin (1935-2004), a Brooklyn native who wrote quite a few romances, mysteries and thrillers in her day, some under various pseudonyms such as Glen Chase. Her daughter, Julie Davis, is a commercial writer too. The cover art is signed O'Brien, who appears to have produced about a dozen or more horror and SF paperback covers beginning as far back as 1967. However, this O'Brien should not be confused with the currently famous and still very active book and magazine illustrator, Tim O'Brien, who was born in 1964.\n\n\"For nearly forty years the giant federal dam loomed over the desert gambling resort of El Paradisio. Right from the start, its construction was marked by violence and bloodshed, and now it was in the news again. An engineer named Cordovan warned that sooner of later the mammoth dam-- weakened by years of stress and shoddy construction-- would break, flooding half the state and killing thousands of people. The immense wall of concrete became a political football that was kicked back and forth from the country courthouse to the Oval Office in Washington. And all the time disaster was getting closer and closer and closer...\"\n\nFlood shares a nearly identical set-up with A Raging Flood: a shoddily built dam is looming like a ticking time-bomb over an unsuspecting desert town in New Mexico. And we know time-bombs always go off unless the red wire is cut. Or is it the yellow wire? Doubleday published Richard Martin Stern's dam disaster novel (no pun intended) in 1979. It was preceded by his first two disaster novels: The Tower (1973), filmed famously as The Towering Inferno, and Snowbound Six (1977), about a huge blizzard pummeling the mountains of New Mexico. Stern then wrote three more disaster novels after that: The Big Bridge (1982), about a giant suspension bridge collapsing over a New Mexico gorge, Wildfire (1985), about a forest fire exploding in the mountains of New Mexico, and Tsunami (1988), about a monstrous wave crashing into the California coast (sound familiar?). Stern (1915-2001) stopped writing after that, but not because his books received bad press (critics did hate them but readers loved them), but because he felt it was time to relax after nearly forty years of relatively successful writing in various genres. He started off with a big splash too, winning an Edgar Award in 1958 for his first novel, The Bright Road to Fear.\n\n\"Two towns lie in the valley--one bustling and thriving, the other submerged and forgotten, intentionally flooded beneath the waters of a big new dam. Jay Harper's mind is on the old town as he rows across the lake, stone buildings clearly visible beneath the placid surface. He doesn't know why he has come to see this place, but something inside him--a premonition--has led him here. The new town has long since forgotten the silent warnings of the old, and now ambitious entrepreneurs are trying to get the dam enlarged. But some, like Jay Harper, suspect the dam may not be safe. Trained as a geophysicist, he thinks the dam is too big, even as it is. There have been earth tremors, and bad weather is brewing. At any time, the dam could unleash its waters across the valley, blindly crushing everything in its wake. \"Think of Johnstown in 1889,\" he says to disbelieving ears, \"only this could be worse, much worse, with the whole city downstream.\" As factions in the town battle one another, the danger grows...\"\n\nDoubleday's 1979 jacket art was produced by Dave Christensen. Christensen graduated from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena in 1973, about the time as I was graduating from high school. I always wanted to be a professional illustrator like Christensen, but for some reason I went into libraries instead (an easier path, no doubt), which after the fact turned out to be a choice I could live with. It's all water under the bridge now, and while I still firmly believe I could have made it as an illustrator, would I have ever been as successful as Christensen is? He did, after all, produce more than 150 book covers, including the first edition covers of Stephen King's Salem's Lot and The Shining, along with hundreds of film and television movie posters and advertisements. He also created the pulp styled illustration on the cover of the 1979 first edition of Peter Nicholl's The Science Fiction Encyclopedia (pictured below), an homage to the original painting by Frank R. Paul that was on the cover of the February, 1933 issue of Wonder Stories (also seen below in bigger format).\n\nGranada, a United Kingdom publisher, issued Stern's Flood in paperback in 1980. Although the cover is merely a photograph, bold font combined with intense color, plus that bubbling drowned hand, does make for a rather effective presentation.\n\n\"For years the city on the plain had been shielded from floods by the massive Harper's Park dam. But now the brilliant young geophysicist Jay Harper has discovered serious fracturing at the dam's base. Day by day, as the freak weather moves ominously nearer, the city trembles on a grueling knife-edge of fear. Unless the rich and powerful in their storm-sheltered houses, and the poor Chicanos in their shanties by the sluggish river can unite to bury their differences and work together, all will perish in a cataclysmic disaster worse than anything the world seen since ancient times...\"\n\nThe U.S. paperback edition of Stern's Flood was published by Ace in 1981. The cover art was not credited nor is is signed, but I love the way the artist made the giant wave look like some kind of monstrous, malevolent creature. What a great image to lure someone into the story.\n\n\"First there was THE TOWERING INFERNO, then EARTHQUAKE. Now the chilling reality of FLOOD. Two towns lie in the valley-- one thriving, the other submerged and forgotten beneath the waters of the dam. Ambitious entrepreneurs want to enlarge the dam-- but it's already too big, dangerously so. At any time, the dam could unleash its waters across the valley, blindly crushing everything in its wake, dwarfing the disaster that was the Johnstown Flood of 1889.\"\n\nDoubleday published the first edition of The Wave in hardcover in 1979 (top). The jacket appears to be a photograph and not an illustration, or at least I think it is. Christopher Hyde was born in Ottawa in 1949. Before becoming a writer he worked in various media outlets in Canada, as an editor, TV interviewer, and researcher, specializing in technology and the environment. The Wave was his fiction debut. It's a doomsday novel, about the failure of the largest dam in the world, located on the Columbia River. Hyde spent three years researching the story, his warning of a disaster that could be. To date he has written more than 30 thrillers, 16 of them as standalones. Many of his novels were published under the pseudonyms Paul Christopher and A. J. Holt. His brother Anthony is also a professional writer and editor and together they collaborated on a retelling of the Robin Hood myth, Locksley (Allen Lane, 1983), using the pseudonym Nicholas Chase.\n\nSeal, Bantam's Canadian imprint, published the first paperback edition of The Wave in 1980. The cover art was painted by Lou Feck. I'm pretty sure this is a full wraparound illustration, but until I actually order one from the Great White North I won't really know for sure. I just wish those northern shipping costs weren't as high as Feck's wave.\n\n\"High above the huge Mica Dam, a mountain rumbles. Below the dam lies a nuclear reactor. A young scientist grasps the horrible truth; a landslide will unleash a radioactive wall of water 745 feet high. Millions will die. Cities will drown. The Pacific will become a dead sea. But someone is trying to kill the only man who can stop... THE WAVE.\"\n\nPlayboy Press published their paperback edition of The Wave a year after Bantam/Seal did, in 1981. The cover art was produced by James Dietz. Lou Feck, who was particularly adept at painting transportation equipment (and everything else under the sun), would've been thrilled with the work of Dietz, who is now one of the best illustrators of historical scenes involving transportation and military equipment in the world. This is one of his earliest book covers, but it's no less awesome by being so.\n\n\"Water. Jonathan Kane is afraid of water. An engineer for the government, Kane has discovered that a major dam is on the brink of collapse. Once it bursts, a deadly domino effect will be set in motion. From the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean, a chain of dams will cave in-- forming the biggest wall of water mankind has ever seen. But then Kane and reporter Charlene Daly discover some frightening facts that point to a mysterious conspiracy. While they try to make them known, the first dam bursts and The Wave becomes a reality. Its speed: 100 miles an hour. Its height: over 600 feet. Its destiny: to smash everything in its path, including a nuclear generator in the hands of environmental terrorists. Unless Jonathan and Charlene can escape their would-be assassins, the entire Pacific Northwest-- and the Pacific Ocean itself-- will be contaminated for the next 5000,000 years.\"\n\nDeluge has to be one of the best disaster novels of the 20th century. It's packed with everything you ever hoped would be in such a story, and then some. But don't get attached to too many of its characters because you will have your heart drowned. Deluge doesn't show any mercy---it's as unrelenting as the swollen river water was coming down the Big Thompson Canyon.\n\nDeluge was Richard Doyles debut, published in hardcover by Arlington Books in 1976. The jacket art was not credited but it's very dramatic and I wish I had a better, flatter image of it to post. According to the flap Doyle was the great nephew of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and a great great nephew of Richard Doyle the famous Punch illustrator. Doyle was born in the Channel Islands in 1948, and spent the first twenty years of his life abroad, in Ethiopia, the Middle-East and North Africa. His wiki bio omits the nephew part but does reiterate his globe trekking lifestyle. Other stays were in Cape Ann, Massachusetts, and Gascony, France. Doyle also wrote one of the best aviation thrillers I've ever read, almost an epic really, titled, Imperial 109. It was a huge bestseller on this side of the Atlantic as well as in his native country, selling more that a million copies in paperback. In 2002 Doyle rewrote Deluge into Flood, adding among other things the Thames Barrier, a defense against sea surges, which in 1976 was only a work in progress. Of interest too is that Doyle became a respected expert on climate change and flooding, lecturing frequently on the subject, with regular appearances on TV and radio. Doyle, an avid yachtsman whose passion was shared by his wife and son, passed away in 2017.\n\n\"Deluge is a riveting novel about the almost total annihilation of London by a freak flood in winter and its horrendous aftermath. With the massive river barrier planned at Woolwich still unbuilt, due to strikes and official procrastination, Deluge traces the path of millions of tons of water from the North Atlantic into the North Sea during the night and onto the unsuspecting metropolis. Despite warnings from meteorologists and engineers, the authorities at first refuse to recognize the danger, until the thirty-foot surge, on top of a high tide, is less than an hour away from London Bridge. Even so, the predictions of the storm's horrifying power are belittled not only to stop panic but for fear of disrupting the imminent arrival on a state visit of The President of the United States. While the people of London continue, unsuspectingly, about their daily lives a belated warning is finally issued. The reconditioned air-raid sirens are sounded. In the storm conditions, however, few hear this pitiful warning and fewer still understand its significance. The flood sweeps up the river and falls upon the helpless city; seventy square miles of central London disappear as the water rises above the level of the bridges. A million and a half people are surrounded and cut off. In the Underground system hundreds are trapped and drowned. In all, over 1000,000 die creating one of the worst disasters in the history of mankind. The authorities are powerless, and from their secret control room beneath the streets of Holborn they can only watch and wait as the flood destroys the capital.\"\n\nPan published the first paperback edition of Doyle's Deluge in 1977. It has a terrific cover illustration, a scene shot from a helicopter's perspective, that again was not credited.\n\n\"It was to be the day that the American President drove in state through the streets of London. By the middle of the morning those streets are under water already several feet deep and still rising. Freak winds and driving rain have pushed a thirty foot surge up the Thames and London is facing the worst disaster in its history. The death toll from drowning, injury and disease tops 100,000. A power station explodes like a bomb. The central London Underground system is flooded and passengers are trapped in trains. A barge is hurled into the first floor of St. Thomas's Hospital and parts of dockland are flooded to a depth of twenty feet...\"\n\nLou Feck produced the cover art on the U.S. paperback edition of Doyle's Deluge. It was published by Bantam in 1978.\n\n\"TRAPPED IN THE TUNNEL: Lungs bursting, the blood pounding in his head, he flung himself through, clutching with desperate strength at the hand rail as his feet slipped from under him on the slimy steps. Behind, he heard a tremendous boom of thunder and a single piercing scream of animal terror, before the water burst from the tunnel mouth like an erupting geyser. Clouds of spray vomited forth, half blinding him... Dimly, in the now almost total darkness, he saw the figures of his companions flung down the maelstrom that seethed around the iron gates... He made a last desperate attempt to clutch at the ladder, his fingers touching its rungs, then with a dull clang that rang through the chamber, the giant doors slid open and the whirling current swept him through the gates.\"\n\nOn the heels of Deluge came The Big Wave: The Day London Collapsed by Conrad Voss Bark. New English Library published it in paperback in 1979. The cover artist is unknown. Going by the blurb on the back cover, it would seem that Voss Bark upped the ante as far as flood casualties go. Wow, ten million! Seriously dude? Voss Bark (1913-2000) was a British journalist, ground-breaking parliamentary correspondent for the BBC, and the author 21 books, an equal mix of fiction and non-fiction. Among them are mysteries, fly-fishing instructionals, and a Lost Race novel (Sealed Entrance, 1947) that takes place in, of all places, Albania!\n\n\"-- \"One of the few, one of the very few, to survive by a miracle from among ten million Londoners dead in the greatest disaster of all time, was a reporter, Corrie Wilson of the London Daily Express.\" Matt was a professional. No one else could have done it but he did. When he said \"a reporter\" something came alive in me. I don't remember what I said; words dissolve after you use them. I gave him facts--the stone cliffs above the tideline of the Mall, the twisted steel skeleton that had been New Zealand House, the heaped bodies along Whitehall, the search for the Queen...\"\n\nCyclone by Hector Holthouse was published in Australia by Rigby in 1971. The jacket artist is unknown. Holthouse grew up in the heart of Queensland's original squatter country, milking cows and riding horses to school. As an adult he became a sugar chemist working in northern Queensland sugar mills, but history was always his passion and so he began writing articles for the Sydney Bulletin and other Australian journals which were eventually turned into popular books, 30 of them between the years 1967 and 1991. Upon his death in 1991 at the age of 76, his books and manuscripts were donated to the Bribie Island Library, where his legacy was honored with the naming of the \"Hector Holthouse Room.\"\n\n\"Cyclone tells a century-long story of the monstrous elemental forces which rage out of the Pacific and Coral Sea to smash against the coasts of eastern Australia. Since the early days of settlement they have taken hundreds of lives, sunk scores of ships, and caused damage totaling many millions of dollars. The force of cyclonic winds seems incredible to those who have not experienced them, and has caused such tragedies as the 1875 wreck of the Gothenburg and the 1899 destruction of the pearling fleet. 307 lives were lost, and only one battered schooner remained. Humanity's only solution is to create systems which give some warning of impending assault. This was realized by the Queensland meteorologist Clement Wragge, a colourful character whose forthright and eccentric nature was somewhat cyclonic in itself. This book tells his story and those of many others who have fought, suffered, or died in these wars which nature wages.\"\n\nManor Books published Cyclone as a paperback original in 1975. The cover artist, while not credited (O'Brien?), should be commended for putting together a truly demonstrative scene. The story takes place in a small town in Texas, starting with a busload of passengers taking shelter in a municipal auditorium as a cyclone approaches. The set-up is basically the same as that great \"bus episode\" from Murder She Wrote, except toss in a whole series of harrowing sequences as townspeople are forced to scramble for safety against the cyclone.\n\nI have to thank Paperback Warrior, one of my favorite review blogs, for giving me a leg up on the author of Cyclone. I figured Eric Nilsen was a pseudonym, and I was right. Nilsen was actually Jack A. Nelson (1930-2015), a journalist by profession as well as a communications instructor at Brigham Young University. Nelson was also the Utah editor for Western Outdoors magazine and was passionate about outdoor recreation, especially trout fishing (like me!). Among his many pursuits in life were tennis (like me!), wheelchair sporting events, serving his church in various capacities, and fiction and non-fiction writing, with which he published seven books. His first novels were published under the pseudonyms Eric Nilsen, Jeremiah Jack and Helen Lee Poole. If you find a copy of his other Manor thriller, Train Wreck (Jeremiah Jack), about a passenger train caught in an avalanche, set your hook hard; it's as rare as catching a seven-pound brook trout in the mountain waters of Utah.\n\nJudith Kazdym Leeds produced the jacket art on the first edition of Cat Five, one of approximately 3000 covers she produced over a long and distinguished commercial art career, which also included teaching workshops and giving demonstrations. William Morrow published this novel in hardcover in 1977.\n\nRobert P. Davis (1929-2005) was a novelist, screenplay writer, and a director, and garnered an Academy Award in 1961 for Best Short Subject for his film, Day of the Painter. Davis published at least six books that I know of. Aviation adventure and natural disasters were his favorite themes.\n\n\"In the weatherman lingo \"cat five\" means a category five tropical cyclone with wind speeds in excess of 155 miles per hour--the worst possible storm. Hurricane Claudine looked as if she might become a cat five, at least to Steve Mitchell, the old-fashioned expert who could feel Claudine's every move in his bones. Keith Landon, a new-breed scientist who put his trust in computers, felt otherwise. The men battled over Claudine--and over the third member of the hurricane-tracking team, the beautiful Dr. Haughton. But all three knew that if Steve's storm materialized, landfall would be near Palm Beach. Oblivious to the goings-on at the hurricane center--and the seas and skies above and around--the beautiful people in Palm Beach carry on as usual. We meet Mel Hansen, an unscrupulous architect, and his wife, Denise, a cunning French movie star; Nicole Bouchard, the glamorous Belgian lesbian who has a sensuous hold over Denise which cannot be broken; the Baxters, whose social position is threatened by the Hansens; and finally, the lovable \"Queen\" of Palm Beach, Maggie Dunsmore, who rules over the resort as a social arbiter. As the great hurricane Claudine grinds out of the doldrums toward Palm Beach, rivalries surface and private dramas erupt in this playground for the very rich. Here is the story of a ferocious storm and what happens to the people caught in its whirling, killing path.\"\n\nThe paperback edition of Davis' Cat Five was published by Pocket in 1978. The cover art is not credited or signed, but I'm pretty sure it's the work of Robert Maguire, who was one of publishing's most distinguished cover artists from his professional beginning in 1950 until his death in 2005 at the age of 84. He produced more than 1,200 covers during that stretch, and is recognized especially for his exceptional skill at rendering the female figure.\n\n\"CAT FIVE on the Cyclone scale-- the worst that nature can do to man! No force of land, sea, or sky ever equaled Claudine! Yet the Palm Beach jet-setters and spoiled rich, the con men and the careless lovers, make jokes about the raging fury headed straight for them. Then Claudine hits. Water rises at an astounding rate. Tiger sharks slip through now-panicked crowds, buildings explode and are ripped away. And as Claudine's victims frantically struggle along roads that go nowhere-- or into luxury towers rising out of the sand-- they cling to lives that take on a new meaning as their world tumbles down around them! CAT FIVE will draw you into its vortex-- and leave you battered and shaken!\"\n\nI don't read French so I don't have a clue about the plot of this novel, other than gale winds are blowing fiercely behind our embracing couple. Cyclone sur la Jamaique (Cyclone in Jamaica) was written by Robert Gaillard and published in hardcover by Fleuve Noir of Paris in 1970. Frenchman Gaillard (1905-1975) was responsible for quite a few romantic novels, thrillers and historicals in his heyday and looks to have been imprisoned briefly during WWII in a Stalag, where he became friends with Francois Mitterand, France's long-standing future President.\n\nThe cover art was produced by Frenchman Michel Gourdon (1925-2011). Gourdon and his famous artist/sculptor brother Alain (known professionally as Aslan), had a thing or two for painting beautiful women (men too I suppose). Between them they created scores of pin-up style paintings and illustrations for use in magazines, posters, postcards, and what have you, but Michel in particular favored book covers, so we have lots of those from him as well.\n\n\"Welcome to Golden Sands, the dream condominium built on a weak foundation and a thousand dirty secrets. John D. MacDonald's biggest, most powerful novel to date. Here is a panoramic look at the shocking facts of life in a Sun Belt community: the real estate swindles and political payoffs, the maintenance charges that run up and the health benefits that run out, the crackups and marital breakdowns, the disaster that awaits those who play in the path of the hurricane...\"\n\nCLICK ON IMAGE TO ENLARGE\n\nLou Feck could go as big as anyone when it was required, especially when it concerned a hurricane slamming into the Florida coast. Passion in the Wind was published in paperback by Popular Library in 1977. It was one of six novels, two of them mysteries, that longtime (now deceased) Florida resident Herman Nathan Weiss wrote during his time away from his day job as a Photo-Processing manager.\n\n\"The rain on his face was painful; he had to escape. Before he could turn, he heard the rumbling. Lifting his eyes, he was horror-stricken. In the bay, on the other side of the causeway, a mountainous wall of water was racing in his direction. It hadn't reached the road yet, and it was impossible to judge its distance. The roaring was tremendous. His fists, knees and chest tried to burrow into the soft mud. He thought his ear-drum would burs and he glanced upward. The sky was a solid green mass, dark and foreboding. But an instant later, he realized it wasn't the sky. He was under the wall of the monster wave... This was Larry Toren, trapped in his desperate race against time to reach the house where his pregnant wife lay exposed to the approaching terror. He was just one of the people about to be swallowed up in an unleashed fury that would turn each life into a savage drama of sheer survival.\"\n\nI think these two covers of Gale Force, Elleston Trevor's storm-battered sea novel, compliment each other quite well. One shows the devastating effect the storm has on humans, and the other on the vessel itself.\n\nStanley Zuckerberg produced the cover art on the 1960 Bantam edition (top). American born Zuckerberg (1919- 1995) was a great artist whose oil paintings sometimes transcended the very paperbacks they were transposed on, especially if they were given edge to edge coverage, like here. He produced more than 300 of them too, and he also supplied illustrations for most of the major slick magazines of his era, including McCall's and The Saturday Evening Post. In 1965 he left the publishing field altogether to concentrate instead on fine art painting, producing maritime and coastal scenes for galleries and exhibitions.\n\n\"Captain Harkness felt the signs. The SS. Atlantic Whipper had been pummeled and thrashed and violated by hungry seas and gale-force winds. Now in her last struggle to keep afloat she had still another enemy--fear, a fear that made passengers into bumbling nuisances, seamen into dangerous rebels. The only strength lay in the unyielding authority of her captain.\" --- Bantam edition.\n\nChristopher Mayger produced the cover art on the 1971 New English Library edition (bottom). Mayger (1919-1994) was one of Britain's leading painters of maritime scenes, be it historical or contemporary, and he represented some of the biggest authors in maritime literature, including Alexander Kent, Nicholas Monsarrat, Farley Mowat, Patrick O'Hara and Douglas Reeman.\n\n\"She was a big deep-water merchantman. Six thousand tons and forty in her crew. On this trip she was carrying ten passengers and a cargo of grain. 200 miles off Land's End at the close of her swift Atlantic crossing she runs into a storm. This is a novel about a struggle of classic proportions. The struggle of one man against the gale forces of the Atlantic in a desperate effort to save his ship, his life and his self esteem.\" --- NEL edition.\n\nEnglishman Trevor Dudley-Smith (1920-1995) changed his name legally to Elleston Trevor after the success of his first novel using that pseudonym in 1946. He wrote more than 100 novels after that, many of them bestsellers, even ones that were still published under additional pseudonyms. Trevor was in fact about as good and entertaining a writer of adventure, mystery and espionage as we've ever had.\n\nHere are two covers from Hammond Innes's classic mystery-adventure novel, Atlantic Fury, each depicting the savage fury of the sea during a storm. They remind me of why I'm a land-lubber, and why I shall remain so.\n\nHoward Terpning produced the cover art on the Dell paperback edition published in 1963. Terpning (1927-) was a prolific illustrator or slick magazines and book covers. He also produced over 80 movie posters, among them Cleopatra, The Sound of Music, Lawrence of Arabia, The Sand Pebbles and The Guns of Navarone. In 1974 he decided to leave commercial art to try his hand at creating Western style paintings and selling them in galleries. Forty-two awards later says it was the right decision. Two of his paintings recently sold for more than $1 million dollars each.\n\n\"The smashing power of the sea, the roaring might of the wind and the valiant endeavor of men in the face of Nature's wildest fury... Innes has no equal when it comes to describing a storm at sea... and this tale must, by all odds, stamp him as a sea-writer as great as Joseph Conrad and C. S. Forrester.\" --- Springfield Sunday News and Leader."
