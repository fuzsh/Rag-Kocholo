        "text": "Original Columbia Pictures Window Card (14x22). Very Fine.\n\nOriginal Columbia Pictures Window Card (14x22) for the Jerry Paris madcap comedy, DON'T RAISE THE BRIDGE, LOWER THE RIVER (1968) starring Jerry Lewis, Terry-Thomas, and Jacqueline Pearce. This nutty comedy features Lewis and Terry-Thomas involved in a scam to raise money quickly. Unlike the majority of his films in the Sixties, Lewis neither wrote nor directed this film. The screenplay was adapted by Max Wilk from his original novel, and the film was directed by Jerry Paris, whose other credits include the popular TV series \"Happy Days\" and a couple of POLICE ACADEMY sequels. This original window card is in very fine condition.\n\nJERRY LEWIS - Actor\n\nTERRY-THOMAS - Actor\n\nJERRY PARIS - Actor/Director\n\nBernard Cribbins - Actor\n\nMichael Bates - Actor"
