        "text": "We’re into the second half of July. The striking arts workers who are members of the Writers’ Guild of America (WGA) continue their strike, and have been joined by members of The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG/AFTRA).\n\nI thought I’d take a little time to gather some information to share with others who haven’t had the chance to inform themselves of what is going on.\n\nThe issues include fair pay and compensation, ending labor exploitation and labor theft, the threats presented by AI, and the tremendous wealth created by digital streaming that is not shared by those who “own” the delivery platforms with those who wrote and performed and created the work feeding that bonanza. Here is a good breakdown of the issues.\n\nAttitude among “regular” people (is there really such a thing?), who daily partake of the art created by these individuals, sometimes leans towards resentment: What are they complaining about? They get to work in a great industry, don’t they? They get to rub shoulders with celebrities and famous artists, right? They want glamour AND fair pay? They probably already make 100x what I earn as a (fill in the blank). The truth is that so few of us in this country earn a living wage that it is mind-boggling. Arts workers suffer low wages in a far-reaching way that is often concealed by the perceived glamour of the industry.\n\nThe way striking workers find themselves maligned in the media hasn’t changed in generations. The narrative usually shapes around things like this: The workers are already spoiled, already over-demanding, already getting more than their fair share and are being unreasonable. They should be grateful for the opportunities provided to them. Others would happily take their place and keep their mouths shut except to express that gratitude.\n\nWell, the realities are not to be found in the illusions created by the executives of the corporations and production companies and streaming services.\n\nMarissa Messiano informs us who the Writers Guild of America is:\n\n“The Writer’s Guild of America (WGA) was first founded in 1933, and almost all television and film writers (along with writers of some scripted podcasts and other digital media) are members of the WGA. It’s the WGA’s Basic Agreement contract that writers work under.”\n\nShe also explains who the writers are striking against: “On the other side of the negotiation table is The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), a group that represents over 350 production companies in the country, including Warner Bros. Entertainment, Universal Studios, Paramount, Netflix, Walt Disney Studios, Amazon, Sony, and many others.”\n\nWhat is the Writers Guild of America demanding? Read the document here.\n\nMessiano says, “There are a few themes within the writer’s requests that led to the WGA strike: asking for better pay and stability for writers, restricting the use of artificial intelligence in writing, and improving pay and residuals for streaming content – something that has significantly fallen behind since the introduction of streaming.”\n\nYou can read Messiano’s whole article, which details the reasons for the requests that WGA is making here.\n\nYou can read more about this strike and its issues here, in an article by Jess Weatherbed.\n\nSome of what she writes, “The companies’ behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing,” said the WGA West on Monday. “From their refusal to guarantee any level of weekly employment in episodic television, to the creation of a ‘day rate’ in comedy variety, to their stonewalling on free work for screenwriters and on AI for all writers, they have closed the door on their labor force and opened the door to writing as an entirely freelance profession. No such deal could ever be contemplated by this membership.”\n\nWhat about the SAG/AFTRA strike? First, it is the first time in over 60 years that this combined union has struck their industries. James Poniewozik, TV Critic for the NYT, writes about it here\n\nHe identifies that big problem about narrative I spoke about above: “SAG-AFTRA, the union representing TV and film actors, joined the writers in a walkout over how Hollywood divvies up the cash in the streaming era and how humans can thrive in the artificial-intelligence era. With that star power comes an easy cheap shot: Why should anybody care about a bunch of privileged elites whining about a dream job?”\n\nPoniewozik points out what most of us who have faced labor exploitation already know: that the “star system” of high pay for a few holds the majority of workers in all occupations at poverty levels of income. In the SAG/AFTRA story, those poverty workers are the background actors. “The lower-paid actors who make up the vast bulk of the profession are facing simple dollars-and-cents threats to their livelihoods. They’re trying to maintain their income amid the vanishing of residual payments, as streaming has shortened TV seasons and decimated the syndication model. They’re seeking guardrails against A.I. encroaching on their jobs.There’s also a particular, chilling question on the table: Who owns a performer’s face? Background actors are seeking protections and better compensation in the practice of scanning their images for digital reuse.” And, by “reuse” the issue is how, or if, an actor’s image can be scanned and used into perpetuity for a single day’s pay. And what do background actors make for a day’s work? As of July 2023, the average hourly pay for a background actor’s work is $12.63/hour.\n\nBottom line, these jobs have been turned into gig jobs in unsustainable ways for human beings, and now there is the threat of AI digitizing and, essentially, stealing the writing, the images, the being-ness of all of these artists and their work.\n\nFran Drescher, the current president of SAG/AFTRA made a speech that has gone viral. In explanation of the strike, she makes the point that all workers, across all disciplines and occupations are facing the same exact kinds of “unpay” and exploitation, unsustainable compensation, lack of living wages. Here is the text of what Dresher said.\n\nHere is a video of her speech.\n\nLest any of us think that the more high-profile actors face little hardship, the internet offers plenty of other stories from actors about their financial realities. In an interview with Bethy Squires, Kimiko Glenn talks about how many of the actors on “Orange is the New Black” continued to have “day jobs” and “side gigs” even at the height of the show’s success.\n\nAccording to Glenn, most of the actors on the show, even at a point when they were internationally famous, still couldn’t afford to take a cab to set, still held down jobs like bartending. Can we all admit that this is absolutely insane?\n\nThe decision to strike is never made easily. It actually creates more hardship while the works are fighting for better circumstances. This is especially true when part of the strategy of the opposite side is to drag out negotiations and starve out the already-underpaid strikers. What does the strike mean for actors? What is required, and what is prohibited? Andrew Dalton explains in his article.\n\nThe strike rules go far beyond “acting”. “They are not allowed to make personal appearances or promote their work on podcasts or at premieres. They are barred from doing any production work including auditions, readings, rehearsals, voiceovers or wardrobe fittings. Newly minted Emmy nominees can’t publicly make their case for votes, nor appear at the ceremony, which is planned for September but is likely to be seriously scaled back or delayed.\n\nThey are instead expected to spend their days on picket lines, outside the corporate headquarters and production hubs of studios. This is no vacation.\n\nHow does this combined strike impact the industry? And how will the viewers experience the strike’s impact? Dalton says, “Actors joining writers on strike will force nearly every U.S.-based show or film that hasn’t already been shut down into hiatus. Upcoming shows are likely to be delayed indefinitely, and some movie releases will pushed back.” Where the writers’ strike had something more like an immediate effect on late-night and comedy programs, it may take a while longer to see the impact on scripted television series. Production has been shut down on some shows, like “Stranger Things,” “Hacks,” or “Yellow Jackets.” Release dates have been pushed back or placed on hold for series and movies and shows.\n\nSo, given the way the writers and actors and other industry professionals are being treated, how do WE, the people who pay for streaming content, buy movie tickets, watch TV and movies and series support the people without whom there would BE no TV, movies and series? Should we be boycotting movie theatres, cancelling our streaming? Not yet, we’re told. This is not yet seen as “crossing a picket line”\n\nNarrowing that question a bit, how do we artists, working in publishing, teaching creative writing or screenwriting or filmmaking respond? How do artists in ALL disciplines respond? We certainly can identify with the struggles created by the ever-increasing power inequalities between the artists and the owners of the delivery platforms/spaces — whether that is a music streaming platform, a gallery system, publishing inequalities, academic gig-i-fication — Are any of us receiving living wages? How do we support our fellow artists? I suggest that it is time for us to amp up the ways and places where we share information about these strikes. We can use our own social media sites to “speak” in support and to share the truth about the struggles. We can even use our professional membership organizations to speak in support of these strikes.\n\nI would suggest that we ALL be prepared to join the strike, because there may be a time when our efforts have to be gathered and added to this fight. We may reach a point when our solidarity with these artists has to be brought to bear. We can exert enormous pressure on the powerful studios with our own consolidated actions in order to make our own voices heard, in order to join a fight that, as Fran Dresher said, is a fight that connects all workers, all those who have suffered exploitation. None of us can afford to see this strike action fail.\n\nThe independent small press community is filled with passionate people who love great writing, dedicated people who love helping talented writers bring their work out into the world. We often work on shoestring budgets, are almost always over-extended and running behind on everything. It has never been an easy occupation. It certainly doesn’t make anyone rich. In fact, it is not at all surprising to find a balance sheet completely in the red – cash negative, in other words. But the wealth of this life is to be found in the beauty of language, the excitement of new, well-written and well-edited manuscripts, the thrill of designing a beautiful book cover, of creating a physical artifact, proof of that which remains glorious in our crumbling society, our dying empire.\n\nAs the Founding Executive Director of Hidden River Arts, and Founding Editor-in-Chief of Hidden River Publishing, I am proud to be part of this community of determined dreamers and ferocious protectors of literature. Hidden River’s publishing endeavor passed our tenth anniversary during the pandemic. COVID nearly killed us. We’re struggling on many fronts to reframe our work in this post-pandemic world. It is to be expected that when a world-wide crisis causes a global meltdown, a lot of problems will remain even after the threat of disease has, largely, passed.\n\nWhat was not be expected, and what should never be accepted, are the ways in which our supposed business partners are making it even harder to restore ourselves and get back to creating and launching high quality books by talented writers, books that readers fall in love with.\n\nLet me be more explicit, and start naming names.\n\nFor the last month, I’ve had struggles with the online booksellers – and these are the sellers who command the lion’s share of all booksales in the U.S. (if not around the world). As an independent small publisher, Hidden River uses Lightning Source/Ingram for printing and distribution. When we first launched our publishing venture, it was a pleasure to work with them.\n\nSo, first, let’s talk about a troublesome situation that now exists with Lightning Source itself. We’ve been with them since 2010. It used to be that, if a problem arose, or if there was a question of any kind, I could simply pick up the telephone and call, speak to a knowledgeable and lovely employee (often with a charming Tennessee accent) and the issue would be resolved in a matter of minutes. Unfortunately, as Lightning Source/Ingram has grown, publishers are no longer offered what I see as a right to high quality, personal customer service. Now, there is no active by-phone customer service. Now, if there is a problem, you have to fill out an email or a “ticket” describing the issue, and then…..wait. Often, you wait for little more than a canned response that does little to address the actual issue, offers nothing beyond the canned language, and if the problem persists, you are plum out of luck since your only option, it seems, is to do it all over again. I’m sure that there is some “best practices” industry manual that claims this new procedural change is “stream-lined” and “cost-reductive”. But here’s a news flash: It does not address your customers’ needs sufficiently….or, in many cases, at all. It is not, in fact, “customer service” in any traditional or satisfactory sense. This change in Lightning Source’s business practices means that a small press often has to wrestle with the same problem in a kind of limbo, often for weeks or months. Sometimes the issue is never resolved. With impossible-to-solve problems externalized onto already overworked small press owners and staff, it means that the issue becomes yet one more largely unresolvable problem in a long line of what my attorney daughter would call “unbillable hours” of miserable frustration. This new practice of Lightning Source/Ingram is uncaring to the point of being hostile to its customers and business partners. Give us back our well-trained human representatives. Show us the respect we deserve. Go back to your older, more accountable and more honorable business model. Stop treating your partners with so little regard.\n\nNow, let’s explore the nightmare that is Amazon. By far the most dominant platform for book sales, Amazon can make life and business absolutely miserable for authors and publishers.\n\nLet me describe to you what we and our authors have been dealing with now for a month. During the first week in April, we uploaded three new paperback titles to Lightning Source. All three were picked up by the Amazon site without their cover images – and with a message that said there WAS no cover image. Since that same image appeared on the vendor pages of Barnes and Noble and Bookshop, it is unlikely that the problem is with the files at Lightning Source. (Although it sure would be nice to have a human at Lightning Source confirm that.) The problem that exists with Amazon is doubled by the problem that IS Amazon. Are there knowledgeable, well-trained, available humans ready to deal with such problems at Amazon? Of course not. A month has gone by, and several attempts to reach out to the organization, using its “help” links and “chat” options have accomplished nothing by way of corrected sales pages. Often, if you get a response at all, it’s from someone who, most likely, is using a false name who writes to tell you that the problem must be with your account at Lightning Source. In other words, their response is “Sorry. Not our problem.”\n\nIn addition to none of the three new titles having their covers showing on Amazon, one of the titles has a message that says the book has not yet been released, and that anyone interested should “pre-order” the book. The book has been available since April 5. Again – is there a way to deal with this, human to human? Of course not.\n\nWhat does this do to our credibility? To our professional profile? To our sanity and the emotional stability of our writers and poets? To our sales? Take a wild guess.\n\nAs I write this, it is May 9, 2023; the problems have existed since the first week of April and remain unresolved. These three books all sit on their Amazon site like some digital version of a remaindered book with a ripped-off cover. Our only solution, at this point, is to drive as many readers and possible book buyers away from Amazon as we can.\n\nNow to Barnes and Noble. Their site had our books up quickly with a functioning purchase button – within about 24 hours – with the cover art, but without the necessary book information – there was no book description, no bio for the author, no reviews. So….great. Here’s a picture of a beautiful book cover and the name of a book, but we’re not going to tell you anything that would inform or interest you in actually buying and reading the book. Would you buy a book, no matter how exquisite the cover, if you have no idea what it was about? Is it a cookbook?….a travel advice book?…..a Victorian murder mystery?…..a book about Mesopotamian clothing styles?\n\nTo their credit: Barnes and Noble does have a more transparent customer service structure, with specified emails for specified needs. They appear to be more publisher-friendly and more oriented to bookselling in a way respectful of books, of publishing, of writers, of the small press community. And, with them, there is something of a happy ending – although it took nearly THREE weeks, all three of our books, as of today, now have not only the buy button, the beautiful cover art displayed but the book info, the writer’s bio….but still none of the reviews or endorsements. So, for purposes of this writing we’ll be displaying ONLY the links to the Barnes and Noble site for these three titles, despite the fact that they don’t include the endorsements. But we’ll be leaning on our relationship with Barnes and Noble now, going forward; the goal is to partner more dramatically with the online seller that offers our authors and their work the most respect.\n\nNow, to the final issue we’ve faced over these past few weeks: Bookshop’s issues. First, they were by far the slowest to upload our titles. Second, once they uploaded them, they also posted a sale price that was significantly higher than the price we posted with Lightning Source. Our price point was $21.99. Bookshop saw fit to post $25.29 as the price. If Bookshop exists in order to help independent bookstores compete with the behemoth online sellers, isn’t overpricing our books a sure-fire way to NOT be competitive? Here is their explanation:\n\nhttps://support.bookshop.org/en/support/solutions/articles/65000183623-why-is-my-book-s-price-different-on-your-site-\n\nThey say: “Bookshop.org pays our booksellers 30% of the cover price of all books sold through them. That means that we lose money on any book with less than a 30% wholesale discount. If your discount is under 20%, we will increase the sale price of the book to make up for this loss. If you do not want your book’s price increased, please offer a wholesale discount greater than 20%. …If you are an IngramSpark author, you must offer a 40% wholesale discount; Ingram’s 20% distribution fee is non-negotiable, so to give Bookshop.org a 20% wholesale discount, you need a 40% discount overall.”\n\nSince we are working with Lightning Source/Ingram, that means that our 30% discount isn’t sufficient for Bookshop, so they are going to jack up our price and take their chunk from the customer…..A customer who will not exist, obviously, since their prices are too high. However, if Hidden River (or any small press) feels hereby coerced into raising their discount to 40% in order to help out our potential readers and the independent bookstores, then WE are earning less money for each book sale. That means that what is left over after Lightning Source, Bookshop and the indy bookstore take their chunks is about $7 to be divided between publisher and author. Even at 30%, the publisher and author are earning less than everybody else along the publishing food chain. Obviously, this is not sustainable. It’s no wonder so many small presses are throwing in the towel.\n\nOh…one last thing. IF we were to give in to Bookshop’s passive-aggressive extortion, that means that a 40% discount would be taken by ALL the sellers, because, with Lightning Source, you can set only one price in each market (one for the US, one for the UK, one for Europe, etc). So, then, Amazon, B&N, and all other sellers would get that extra 10% from the sales, and we would get 10% less from all those sales, across all platforms. So, think about it: with those higher discounts, Amazon and B&N and the others may well decide they can drop the price of the book, thereby remaining cheaper than Bookshop anyway. And who loses? The author and the publisher.\n\nI’m going to end my rant here for now. I’m going to ask those among you who are struggling with similar issues to reach out to us here and leave messages and comments. We want to start a conversation. We want to start a fire. If we come together, make demands in a chorus of voices, maybe even bring in the CLMP (who are also ignoring my emails requesting assistance) and other organizations in support of the authors and publishers, do you think there is hope of addressing and fixing this mess? Otherwise, what are our options?\n\nBy the way, here are those three wonderful new books, linked to their Barnes and Noble pages WITH their beautiful book covers. I encourage you to use these Barnes and Noble links should you wish to make a purchase.\n\nMediterranean by João Luis Barreto Giumarães.\n\nTravels With Ferdinand (A Centennial Journey Through Austria-Hungary) by Mark Eliot Nuckols\n\nRemembering Water: A Memoir of Departure and Return by Tuan Phan\n\nYou can also see our entire catalogue of books on Barnes and Noble here. Check them all out. They are spectacular. Our family of writers and poets are spectacular. They are worth fighting for.\n\nMany of us are shell-shocked, and are likely to remain so for quite some time. Lockdowns. Illness, death, occupational and financial meltdowns.\n\nA sense of dread was pervasive. It has been three years. Are any of us completely free of that feeling of dread?\n\nA new term, “essential workers” came into use; a new respect for those who provide the rest of us with care, service, and support was expressed. But it didn’t last long. It certainly didn’t last long enough for our society at large to support living wages for those in such occupations. Our legislators haven’t passed laws sufficient to create the kind of changes that would right labor exploitation and wage theft. Instead, there is a zeal to put the “working poor” right back in their place and keep them there.\n\nAnother sort of “essential worker” appeared – those who provided us with the moments of pleasure that were so sorely needed. The artists stepped up, didn’t they? Live events were shut down; but it didn’t take long for those in our creative communities to figure out how to move all sorts of events, all kinds of entertainment, into online presentations. Theatre professionals performed online. Singers created Zoom cabaret performances. Musicians, in general, provided thousands of hours of performance. Artists built virtual galleries online. Writers and publishers shifted book readings and interviews into the virtual spaces they worked to create.\n\nArtists, by giving of themselves despite their own struggles and difficulties, helped to support the general well-being during very dark times.\n\nAs life emerges into a post-pandemic stage, it is clear that many things have changed permanently. Security and trust in many of our institutions have been shattered. Communities are suffering even greater ruptures than before.\n\nBut we have to remember: We still need all our essential workers; and we still owe them for what they sacrificed for the good of the rest of us. THEY could be depended upon.\n\nWe still need our artists. It’s become obvious that, in times of difficulty, art is an essential part of healing, of community building. Art provides uplifting moments of human experience and human interaction. Artists could be depended upon.\n\nBut post-pandemic, our arts communities are still struggling. Financial difficulties, staffing shortages, operations in chaos, practices and programs in need of restructure….none of us have escaped without facing at least some of these challenges. And for many, the challenges have expanded to become threats to existence. Theatres and musical venues have failed to re-open, others opened their doors only to have to close them again. Galleries remain empty. In person events, in general, are still struggling to re-grow pre-pandemic numbers of attendees. They may never succeed. Arts organizations across all disciplines report these issues.\n\nWe are all deeply exhausted; it’s hard not to feel demoralized.\n\nAt Hidden River, when lock-downs began, we had to shut down any and all live events. In the past, we had maintained a gallery space with visual art on the walls, music and theatrical performance, poetry and literary readings. We offered workshops and in-person classes. We took our programs into schools.\n\nAll that is gone. It’s unclear how, or even if, these programs can be restored. Should we, like so many of our colleagues, construct virtual spaces in order to provide these events to a wider audience, in order for our offerings to be more far-reaching? There are benefits to that. But there are also benefits to actual human interaction. Without these activities, Hidden River isn’t offering space for musicians or performing artists or visual artists. We want to bring them back.\n\nWe haven’t really begun to address the questions about restoring the live arts programs, because we are currently wrestling with other difficulties that the COVID era caused. Hidden River is an all-volunteer organization; maintaining a long-term committed staff in arts organizations like ours has always been a struggle. But with the pandemic, we lost staff in higher numbers and have yet to rebuild sufficiently. We have faced illnesses, we have faced a death.\n\nMost arts organizations, especially smaller organizations, are facing extensive challenges. Here in Philadelphia, programs have closed, many of the small theatres have cut their seasons from four to one or two plays a year, musical venues are shutting their doors permanently. Galleries are closing. Even the Philly POPS orchestra – certainly not a small institution – came very close to bankruptcy and closing down. Its future is still not certain.\n\nAcross the country, similar reports are everywhere. Literary magazines and small presses are closing down. Small arts organizations are pulling the plug. Hidden River, which launched over 30 years ago, is still struggling with the aftermath of our pandemic shortfalls. Without sufficient staff, our publishing pipeline has slowed, our award decisions have slowed. Our blog sits too long without being updated. Our newsletters are not being published. There is simply too much waiting for too long for the appropriate attention. It’s not fair to anyone.\n\nAt first, it appeared that we could catch up quickly once life “returned to normal”. But there is no normal until a new “normal” is created. Meanwhile, our questions here have been “How do we catch up on the mountains of backlogged work? How do we best serve our authors, and those who submitted their work to us and continue to wait for award decisions?” How do we handle all this?\n\nThe first decision: We will not explore re-opening any of what had once been our live arts programs. They have to stay closed for now. The second decision: We will suspend our calls for submissions and our literary awards, at least for the remainder of 2023. This is in order to allow us to address the backlog of submissions too long awaiting proper attention. It will allow us to finalize awards. To course-correct the chaos of the last several years. It will allow us to provide more attention to our authors waiting in the publishing pipeline – to attend to the editing, the cover and interior design, the community-building and promotion needed for successful book launches. It will allow us to stay “on task” with our authors post-publication, to help them continue to grow their readership and reputation.\n\nWe remain committed to those who have placed their faith in us. We remain committed to our internship program, which is the one program that continued to run and to flourish even during the darkest times of the recent plague.\n\nSome of the decisions we’ve made may become permanent. It’s simply too soon to say. For the time being, we want to focus on getting our house in order, and on serving those who have trusted us, and who are relying on us.\n\nYou’ll be hearing from us – announcements of the award decisions, introductions and profiles offered about our authors and their books. There is still a LOT of work to be done here, and a lot to report as we move through that work.\n\nIt’s been hard to share this news, and to write of our difficulties. But our Hidden River family has always been filled with loving people. This report, and these decisions, are the best way we can love you back.\n\nWinner of The Eludia Award, Elise Atchison’s Crazy Mountain chronicles a rapidly changing place and community through the diverse and conflicting stories of the people who live in a fictional mountain valley in Montana over nearly half a century (1970-2015). As newly built roads carve through the primal wild, and the rural landscape transforms into subdivisions, McMansions and resorts, conflicts escalate between locals and newcomers, developers and environmentalists, the wealthy and the homeless. Through multiple perspectives we hear the voices of ranchers, real estate agents, carpenters, artists, New Agers, Native American activists, landscapers, movie stars, musicians, pizza delivery drivers, gun-toting fundamentalists, and others including Kate, a troubled young woman who becomes homeless over the course of the book and whose own story in many ways mirrors the destruction and resurrection of the land. These varied threads weave together into a rich tapestry of place, exploring timely themes of housing booms and homelessness, loss of open land to development, cultural clashes, and the correlation between how we treat the natural world and how we treat each other, especially the most vulnerable among us. What does it mean to lose a place we love, and what does it mean to gain from it? Perhaps it depends on perspective.\n\nPraise for Crazy Mountain:\n\n“Crazy Mountain is a powerful story about possession and dispossession. Gritty and tough and gut wrenching, Atchison shows us how the West continues to be an explosive and embittered battleground, both sh*t show and love story. Crazy Mountain ignites a firestorm.”\n\nDebra Magpie Earling, author of Perma Red and The Lost Journals of Sacajewea\n\n“Crazy Mountain is a grand tale of the power of wilderness to heal wounds-scars on the land and the troubled humans who live in it … This is a crazy and wonderful book.”\n\nDoug Peacock, author of Grizzly Years and Was It Worth It, filmmaker, “Disabled Veteran”\n\n“I absolutely love this kind of storytelling. Reminiscent of Winesburg, Ohio and Olive Kitteridge, this collection blooms from the diverse points of view held within Crazy Mountain’s boundaries. And the stories are the real thing-complex, sophisticated stories of the American West, not the tired mythologies that sadly continue to prevail. From subdivisions to resorts to the homeless, from wilderness to ski slopes to private land, we find an accurate, sensitive, and nuanced view of rural Montana.”\n\nLaura Pritchett, winner of PEN USA and author of The Blue Hour and Stars Go Blue\n\n“In the Mountain West, the landscape is a constant. It’s the people who change. Ranchers, realtors, carpenters, painters, archeologists, bad-ass baristas … in this artful, lyrical, deeply moving novel, Elise Atchison follows a piece of landscape through several lifetimes, capturing the dramatic complexity of the disrupted West through a full cast of characters, one lens after another. It’s a full-time job, trying to make sense of the West these days. I find that this extraordinary book helps make that job a little easier.”\n\nAllen Morris Jones, author of A Bloom of Bones and Sweeney on the Rocks\n\n“In Crazy Mountain the lives of those who people landscapes of beauty and despair are multilayered, evocative, and rich with unforeseen mystery. Elise Atchison’s prose is a vessel of precision and depth, unafraid to draw the reader into the more shadowed crucibles of life and help us emerge with light in our hands. In stories that cover nearly five decades in the life of a mountain and its residents, there is the wildness of the human heart shaped by the wildness that surrounds us. May you take this book home, cherish it as I did, and find in it the treasure it gives without measure … that of ‘the wildland that has been lost, and all that remains.'”\n\nShann Ray, author of American Copper and Sweetclover\n\n“With great insight, intelligence, and intimacy, Elise Atchison explores a singular dilemma: How do we live in paradise without destroying the very thing we love? Set in a place changing so rapidly that its inhabitants no longer recognize the landscape, one another, or even themselves, these individual narratives of love and loss, celebration and lament, interweave as the dreams of one generation give way to the disillusionment of the next. A story of human intrusion and intervention, in which moments of brutality give way to gestures of charity, Crazy Mountain serves as a reminder that what we think we own may not be ours after all.”\n\nKim Barnes, author of In the Kingdom of Men and In the Wilderness\n\nCrazy Mountain can be purchased at Barnes & Noble, Amazon, Bookshop and other online sellers. It can also be ordered from your neighborhood brick and mortar store."
