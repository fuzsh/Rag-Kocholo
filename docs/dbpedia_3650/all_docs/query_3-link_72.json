        "text": "Cosy and romantasy are currently my two bête noires, so I anticipated that I might not be the right reader for this book – and I wasn’t, but for reasons that had nothing to do with either cosiness or romance. S.A. MacLean’s adult fantasy debut, The Phoenix Keeper, stars bisexual Aila, who is in charge of a certain type of phoenix at a magical zoo. Aila struggles with anxiety and so avoids anything public-facing, but knows her phoenix biology inside out, and dreams of acquiring a second phoenix to begin a breeding programme. Her nemesis is Luciana, the beautiful and confident griffin keeper, who seems to be everything she is not – and whom she harboured a secret crush on in college.\n\nFirst things first: this might be marketed as adult, and Aila might be supposed to be twenty-eight years old, but it’s definitely YA. The whole feel of the book is wrong for the adult market, but also, it would all have worked so much better if Aila had just been a sixteen-year-old apprentice. As an adult protagonist, she’s impossibly frustrating: naive, blinkered, unable to understand that a conservation programme might need to make money, and intensely uninterested in anybody except herself for at least the first half of the novel. Her difficult backstory with Luciana is practically middle grade. I felt particularly sorry for her best friend Tanya, who continually supports Aila and gets nothing back. This feels especially uncomfortable as Tanya is a trans woman of colour whom Aila keeps objectifying with weird epithets (‘Tanya. You magnificent tropical merhorse’.) Aila’s character arc follows the typical YA trajectory of simplistically acknowledging and apologising for all her faults about halfway through, after which she becomes more bearable, but she’s never a great protagonist.\n\nThe Phoenix Keeper would also have worked better for me if it had been set in a skewed version of our own world (I’m thinking Robin McKinley’s Dragonhaven, which is the only other book about magical conservation I’ve come across), rather than in an incredibly sketchy fantasy world that is basically place names and nothing else. The worldbuilding is so weak that I spent most of the book wondering whether a character being referred to as a ‘witch’ meant that she was actually a witch or whether this was just an insult. I enjoyed the care-of-magical-creatures material in the zoo and the practicalities of the phoenix programme, but I thought MacLean could have taken this much further, especially given that she has a PhD in Environmental Science. What sort of ecosystems do these animals fit into? How is conserving them beneficial for nature more generally? OK, other readers may not have been as keen on these geeky details, but BRING ON THE MAGICAL ECOLOGY, I say.\n\nHaving said all this… I think this is the first ‘cosy’ book I’ve read that actually felt cosy to me. It flashed me right back to the kind of fantasy I read as a teenager, and after the midway point, I genuinely enjoyed reading it, despite Aila, despite everything. The romance is low-key but that’s perfectly fine with me, and I thought MacLean did a good job of developing Aila and Luciana’s relationship. I’d read more set in this world, but I’d want more cryptid ecobiology and a different protagonist.\n\nI received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review. It’s out in the UK on 13th August.\n\nA bit of a step-up for my 20 Books after some disappointments… Here are two haunting summer reads that have both just been released!\n\nI was absorbed by Hazel Barkworth’s thoughtful and atmospheric debut Heatstroke, and The Drownings drew me in equally deeply. Serena is a new student at an ancient British university that is fictional but seems intended to reflect St Andrews, with its far northern coastal setting and its history of witch-trials and weird rituals. While only a year older than her fellow freshers, she feels like she’s already lived a lifetime underwater as a competitive swimmer, and is still invisible on land. Meanwhile, her cousin Zara has come out of her shell and is now a body-positive influencer, happily celebrating the curves and armpit hair Serena eschewed when she was competing. Serena attracts the attention of Jane, a history lecturer in her early thirties, when they team up to rescue a girl from drowning, and both are drawn into a wider campus movement to oppose institutional misogyny. Serena is captivated by how Jane links what’s happening to women today to the history of witch trials in this remote place – and she begins to believe that she has her own powers.\n\nAs in Heatstroke, Barkworth’s prose is hypnotic without ever becoming excessive, and I fully believed in Serena as a character and how her own experience of the water made her so painfully relate to the university’s history of drownings. The power balance between Serena and Zara is played beautifully, without either cousin becoming simplistically good or bad, and Serena’s swimming backstory is fascinating. There’s a hint of Tana French’s unforgettable The Secret Place in the way she comes to employ magic that may be real or imaginary but is linked to a certain kind of belief in herself that she loses, for better or worse, as she moves towards adulthood. I was a little unsure why Barkworth had chosen to replay the very familiar trope of a female educational authority figure who leads girls astray in the name of feminism, which dates back at least to Lois Duncan’s Daughters of Eve of 1979 and, for me, always risks straying into sexism and lesbophobia (Jane is explicitly a lesbian but these figures are often coded queer). However, The Drownings is handled so well that it becomes far more than its cliches, and I look forward to seeing what element Barkworth tackles next.\n\nI realise now why ghosts are not the main characters of stories. Even the cat has stopped paying attention to me.\n\nMax is dead, but his spirit cannot leave the flat he shared with his troubled girlfriend Hannah. As he lingers, we learn about Hannah’s traumatic family history, growing up with her goat-farming parents in the Australian outback on a patch of land called the Echoes. Her uncle Tone is now the only one of her relatives who still carries the memory of the industrial school that once stood there, where Indigenous children were stolen from their people and forced to attend, sometimes until they died. At a family Christmas dinner, he announces, to everybody’s discomfort, that he wants to do a toast: ‘I’d like to respect the people who were here before. It’s not a lot. But it’s something’. He takes his teenage nieces to the old schoolhouse, where he tells them ‘There’s bones over the whole fucking place. My roots shouldn’t be growing over those bones’. Evie Wyld’s choice of Tone as witness is inspired; as both abused and abuser, alcoholic and self-harmer, he speaks to one of the central questions at the heart of The Echoes. Who gets to tell certain stories? Is Tone right when he says ‘I’m the wrong one to be talking, but what’s worse, the wrong person talking or no one talking?’ or is Hannah’s statement ‘I think sometimes silence is better than the wrong person speaking’ more important, as she thinks back to the impact Tone had on her life and on her sister Rach’s?\n\nThe Echoes seems to be in conversation with all of Wyld’s previous work. It picks up on themes of abusive families and men in rural Australia more strongly, for my money, than The Bass Rock and After The Fire, A Small Still Voice. Hannah and Rach’s fascination with sharks also recalls how cleverly Wyld explored her own childhood obsession in the graphic novel Everything is Teeth. But the unravelling of a traumatic past has rarely been done better by anyone than Wyld does in All The Birds, Singing, and for that reason some of The Echoes felt superfluous to me. I found the book weakest when it jumped outside the perspectives of Hannah and Max – it’s here that it comes closest to being a more simplistic story about how damaged people inevitably damage others, because the voices of most of the other narrators aren’t strongly differentiated enough to lift it. This, however, sits in sharp contrast with how vividly Wyld writes secondary characters like Hannah’s parents, Piers and Kerry, her best friend Janey, and Janey’s daughter Maddie – so long as we stay outside their heads. Tonally, the book also feels a little more uncertain in the middle, when Max’s wry, slightly silly narration begins to jar both with the fact of his own death and Wyld’s deep, brilliant engagement with the derealisation that Hannah begins to experience. Somehow, though, Wyld brings this back to deliver a knockout ending, as Max too adopts a more elegiac tone.\n\nI was left wondering, as Max does, why he lingers in this story at all, but I think he is there to say something bigger about how we persist as long as there’s one person left to remember us. Given this, perhaps Tone’s toast isn’t completely useless; it’s an attempt to speak, however clumsily, to a wider forgetting. Max’s role also illustrates the limitations of the white Western narrative structures he taught as a creative writing lecturer; sometimes characters don’t have agency, or a clear goal, or a problem they can overcome. Sometimes all they can do is keep hanging around.\n\nI received free proof copies of both these novels from the publisher for review. They both came out in the UK on the 1st August.\n\nA different kind of Superlatives this month as most of my reading has been focused on 20 Books of Summer – so rather than using the usual categories, I’ve just focused on four books that I want to showcase in longer reviews – two of which were borrowed from the library. Here goes!\n\nThe First Book I Want To Showcase Is…\n\n… Happiness Falls by Angie Kim. Twenty-year-old Mia narrates what happened after her father Adam goes missing in a national park in Virginia centred on the Great Falls of the Potomac River, leaving her disabled brother, Eugene, as the only witness. Mia’s clever, logical, tangential first-person voice contrasts sharply with what seems like Eugene’s complete inability to communicate with words due to his autism and mosaic Angelman syndrome. But as Mia and her family dig deeper into the mystery of what happened to Adam, they realise that Eugene may not be non-verbal after all – and so may be able to give them crucial answers.\n\nHappiness Falls seamlessly weaves together themes of disability, language, relative happiness, shared consciousness and stereotyping through its warm portrait of a single family. I loved Kim’s depiction not only of each individual character but of the close family culture they share, which is delightful despite its unwitting exclusion of Eugene. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen such an accurate evocation of Gen Z characters on the cusp of adulthood, capturing that in-between relationship some people have with their parents when they’ve just left their teens but are still at university and living at home most of the time. I felt unethused by Kim’s debut, Miracle Submarine (later retitled Miracle Creek, which I still think is a shame), because of the way it hopped between multiple voices, which not only diluted the force of the novel but made it feel like a game Kim was playing with her readers due to the way she dropped clues to the central mystery.\n\nGiven this, the choice to stick solely to Mia’s perspective here is a very smart one, allowing Kim to explore not only the limits of Mia’s knowledge but how it is shaped by her world-view. We also see that the way Mia uses language doesn’t mean she’s always easily heard; she’s almost at the other end of the spectrum from Eugene, so fast with her words that she struggles to get what she really wants to say across. The moments of miscommunication throughout the novel, when Mia clocks how her family sometimes sees her, genuinely hurt, and it definitely feels like her twin brother John is the really privileged one among the siblings. I imagine readers will be split on the ending; I loved Kim’s willingness to leave some things uncertain, which left me thinking, as I imagine she intended, that sometimes we have to choose whether or not to believe in those we love rather than demanding absolute proof. As for Eugene, check out my Goodreads review if you want my spoilery thoughts.\n\nLike Miracle Creek, this still reminded me strongly of Jodi Picoult – I’m particularly thinking of House Rules, which is about an autistic (though not non-speaking) teenager whose motives are called into question because of his difficulties in communicating, and Nineteen Minutes, which features a father studying the economics of happiness. I also got some Celeste Ng vibes, though, unlike Miracle Creek, I’d compare this one not to the simplistic Little Fires Everywhere but to the more interesting Everything I Never Told You, where an Asian-American family never get answers after the loss of their daughter. But ultimately, this is better than both Picoult and Ng, even at their best. A brilliant one-off. I borrowed this book from my local library #LoveYourLibrary\n\nThe Next Book I Want To Showcase Is…\n\n…The Echo Wife by Sarah Gailey. This is a book that has really suffered from its marketing. It’s been jacketed like a domestic thriller but it’s actually a smart, taut piece of speculative fiction. As a result, readers like me, who’d love it, have been put off and its Goodreads reviews are full of people complaining that they didn’t like the protagonist. Anyway, The Echo Wife has a great premise: Evelyn finds out that her ex-husband has used her own research on cloning to create a duplicate of her who is more malleable, domestic and maternal. What makes this a great book rather than just a great premise is where Gailey goes from there. The Echo Wife is a perfect example of a book that doesn’t rely on one big twist, but is consistently wrong-footing the reader, because of the way Gailey logically deals with the consequences of that opening gambit. It also delivers on the more litfic aspects of its concerns, making Evelyn an especially compelling narrator. She’s not easy to like, but her abusive childhood and relationship with her own clone, Martine, throws up so much stuff about how the way we think about ourselves and our doppelgängers shapes the way we are. Martine doesn’t get to narrate but she becomes equally fascinating, as she deals with the knowledge that she was assigned a certain kind of personality, and wonders if her desires are really her own. I loved the uncanny Stepford–esque details: poor Martine can only sleep from nine pm to six-thirty am, however tired she is, because of her programmed circadian rhythm; she has to be told to shower, but is compelled to clean. I’ll read more by Gailey. I bought this book second-hand from Barter Books in Alnwick!\n\nThe Next Book I Want To Showcase Is…\n\n… Code Dependent: Living in the Shadow of AI by Madhumita Murgia. My local library has bought the entire Women’s Prize for Non-Fiction shortlist, and I’m gradually reading my way through it. This one is currently second in my rankings, behind A Flat Place but ahead of the actual winner, Doppelgänger, which I felt would have been better as a long essay. As the title suggests, this one is a series of case studies of the impact of AI systems on people’s lives. At first, I found Code Dependent too journalistic and too familiar. The first three chapters showcase material I’d already seen in news reporting and on social media, dealing with ‘deepfakes’, face recognition apps, data-tagging jobs and the hideousness of getting workers in the Global South to filter out violent material from our social media feeds. All important issues, but I not only knew about them but felt they’d been addressed better in fiction, from Cory Doctorow’s prescient For The Win to Lisa Ko’s short story ‘The Contractors‘. The last couple chapters, on legal and societal frameworks, were also too broad-brush for me, and I was frustrated by a throwaway sentence that referenced a much more interesting story that Murgia wrote for the Financial Times, on a woman who challenged a new algorithm the NHS uses to allocate livers for transplant (I imagine the FT didn’t allow her to reproduce it here, but such a shame!).\n\nBut the middle of the book is much stronger, with great chapters on how the Uber app screws over riders, how AI-powered diagnosis tools can improve healthcare in rural India, and how data collected from families living in Salta, in north-west Argentina, was supposed to improve outcomes for teenage mothers but ended up surveilling families pointlessly. I was most struck by Murgia’s case study of the ProKid machine learning system used in Amsterdam, that collates a list of young people supposedly at risk of committing crimes but, unsurprisingly, both over-represents teenagers of colour and labels them in a way that makes things worse. Not only did young people on the list feel set up for failure, the list was actually used by drug gangs to recruit ‘easy targets’. So much resonance here with the way young people were policed in England and Wales in the inter-war and post-war periods, when, even though there was no AI, their family circumstances and supposed vulnerabilities were used to determine what happened to them in the criminal justice system. So Code Dependent may be patchy, but it’s worth reading, and I was especially impressed by its global reach. I borrowed this book from my local library #LoveYourLibrary\n\nThe Final Book I Want To Showcase Is…\n\n… Slammed by Lola Keeley. Elin is ranked number one, smashing through tennis Grand Slams and going for an all-time record. But what has become a rather joyless race to the top is knocked off course when she meets Toni, a lower-ranked player who is making a strong comeback after injury. As the women play matches around the world, they fall for each other, but how will they handle their relationship, especially as Elin is not yet publicly out as a lesbian? This was a sure-fire hit for me: tennis* + lesbians + total annihilation of the Ambitious Women Meet Bad Ends trope, which I’ve noticed is much less in play in queer romance. The pacing felt slightly off, as Keeley doesn’t quite raise the stakes high enough, and I was unsure about a minor subplot that involves women of colour unfairly getting tested for drugs far more often than white players, as it seemed to only be present as a vehicle for Elin to showcase what a great ally she is (the awkward handling reminded me of the way race is written in Mary Robinette Kowal’s The Fated Sky, which is otherwise a very different novel!). Nevertheless, I loved the unabashed tennis geekery and the sweet romance between Elin and Toni. I was also delighted to discover that this is published by an independent press called Ylva, which turns out to be a women-owned international publisher that especially focuses on WLW romance. I’ll definitely be reading more from them, and from Keeley. I received a free proof copy of this book from the publisher for review.\n\n*lest anyone is misled, I never actually watch tennis but love reading about it. I blame Anne Digby’s Trebizon series for starting me on this path.\n\nWhat stood out to you this month?\n\nI liked Gareth E. Rees’s Unofficial Britain, which looked for the weirdness in everyday places like car parks and underpasses, as well as his short story ‘The Knucker’ in Dan Coxon ed., This Dreaming Isle, so I thought he’d handle his latest, Sunken Lands: A Journey Through Flooded Kingdoms and Lost Worlds, equally well. Unfortunately, this was a bit of a slog for me. Rees’s approach is interesting: he tends to start with folktale, then casts us back into deep geological time to trace the origins of these stories, before considering what this waterlogged place looks like today and linking our climate crisis to longer histories of climate change. The problem I had was that he uses this structure in every chapter, so it becomes predictable and repetitive. It was also a shame that this book is so focused on Britain; I could feel it livening up in the last two chapters on the Louisiana wetlands and the flooding of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, perhaps simply because this material was less familiar. Writing-wise, Rees, at least in this book, tends to evoke place in a list-like fashion (‘Weeds grow… Buildings sit… Bridges arc…’) which also becomes tiring, as in this description of the Cambridgeshire fens:\n\nGrassed embankments devoid of flowers. Waterways empty of wildlife, surfaces like glass, reflecting bruised clouds. Fallow fields covered by flapping sheets of polythene, weighed down with stones. Farm buildings slung together with telegraph wires. Houses with wooden-jetty driveways over streams, like shacks on a Louisiana delta. Ruined windmills consumed by ivy, towered over by gleaming wind turbines.\n\nI actually like quite a lot of this descriptive prose but the repeated sentence structure doesn’t work for me. Again, it’s at the end of the book that we get a glimpse of what Rees can do, in this superb description of driving down Highway 23 along the Mississippi towards where Louisiana melts into the Gulf of Mexico:\n\nBy this point in my journey, the rain was beyond torrential, drilling into the car windows, blurring my view, blending the radio jazz with a monstrous percussive hiss. The road was coated in a film of dancing water. Effluent fountains of brown spray erupted from truck wheels… It was only 2 pm but all the vehicles’ headlamps were on full beam, diffused by rain into frazzled orbs. Every now and then I’d hit a puddle and the car aquaplaned, forcing me to grip hard on the wheel. Just when I thought the deluge was peaking there was a roar as it came down with even more force, bouncing so hard off the asphalt that it appeared to be raining upwards.\n\nI mean, I am THERE! I wonder if it also helps that Rees is an actor in the scene rather than a passive observer, unlike the fens passage above. Anyway, I don’t think Sunken Lands is him at his best, and I’d encourage those seeking the uncanny to check out his other work.\n\nReadalike: John Vaillant’s Fire Weather, which deals with the fires that emerge from climate crisis rather than the floods.\n\nI received a free proof copy of this book from the publisher for review.\n\nAnd now for something completely different… Yasmin Zaher’s debut The Coin was one of my most anticipated 2024 releases. Turns out, this wasn’t my kind of thing at all, though I’d press it into the hands of anybody who loves Ottessa Moshfegh, especially My Year of Rest and Relaxation. One thing I did love about The Coin is how thoroughly it smashes any expectations about what fiction written by a Palestinian woman about a Palestinian woman should look like. Its unnamed narrator is wealthy, young and aimless in New York, obsessed with her personal hygiene and increasingly trying out experimental pedagogy with the young teenage boys she teaches. What starts as ‘free lessons’, where she allows the boys to do what they like, morphs until they become guinea pigs for her own literary and political tastes. On one occasion, she takes them to see a radical poetry reading in New Jersey: ‘After the dagger poems, I called for a head count’. The Coin is one of those novels where the blurb promises something that doesn’t turn up until halfway through the book and doesn’t end up being that important, but the publisher had to say something about what happens. In this case, it’s the focus on the narrator getting involved in a scheme to resell Birkin bags, which she does do, but it lasts about twenty pages. The writing is sharper than Moshfegh, for my money, and I particularly liked Zaher’s wry observations on beauty routines: ‘Two thousand years of snail cream and you will see a woman’s brain through her face’; ‘I even used a hand mirror for better views, the type women use to be stunned by their vaginas’. We see her conflicted relationship with race as she continually tans to look more visibly Other, then loofahs off the dead skin. And while I struggled to connect with the first three-quarters of the book, I thought Zaher showcased her protagonist’s alienation and dispossession cleverly in the surreal final section, which reaches beyond the unravelling woman trope to become something rawer.\n\nI received a free proof copy of this book from the publisher for review.\n\nWe’re halfway through 20 Books of Summer! And I’m behind! How about you? Today, I review two new releases that I found both frustrating and disappointing…\n\nBehind You Is The Sea, Susan Muaddi Darraj’s third collection for adults, is billed as a novel but is definitely a (very) loosely connected series of short stories about Palestinian-American families in Baltimore. This in itself is not a problem for me. Indeed, looking at the book this way helps me to appreciate the stories that I did like. The standout here is the final entry, ‘Escorting the Body’, where Marcus accompanies his father’s body back to be buried in Palestine despite their estrangement in life; Marcus detested his father for disowning his younger sister Amal. In a homeland he has never visited before, Marcus discovers that his fluent Arabic sounds old-fashioned because he learned it from older relatives, and negotiates a more complex memory incarnated in the figure of Rita, a woman shunned after her arrest and rape during the intifada in 1989, but protected by his father, who also gave her the task of shielding his house from settlers. Despite its cliched plot, I also emotionally connected to Samira in ‘Worry Beads’, who is negotiating her beloved father’s dementia in the face of family indifference and past violence.\n\nThe rest… not so much. A lot of Behind You Is The Sea reminded me of Aisha Abdel Gawad’s Between Two Moons, which focuses on an Egyptian-American family in New York; both books often feel like YA because of their reliance on familiar coming-of-age beats. Many of Darraj’s narrators are very young, dealing with things like teen pregnancy, abusive parents, body image issues and the problematic school production of Aladdin; these issues are obviously important but felt too hackneyed for me. Having said that, though, Darraj’s writing is nowhere near as distinctive as Gawad’s. It’s the sort of pared-back simple prose that I suspect comes from US creative writing classes, as I seem to read versions of it in a lot of American debuts. I struggled constantly to remember who anybody was, partly because the stories flip between a lot of characters and time periods, but partly because very few of the characters are distinguished other than by their family roles. And for a collection which Etaf Rum thinks ‘fearlessly confronts stereotypes about Palestinian culture’, I found a lot of the situations quite stereotyped – I’m not really equipped to comment on this, but I was interested to note that the two reviews I’ve found from Arab-American readers make the same criticism.\n\nI’m sorry not to have liked this more, especially as Swift Press were kind enough to send me a hardback copy after my Netgalley file didn’t work; check out Rebecca’s review for a more positive take on this collection.\n\nI received a free proof copy of this collection from the publisher for review.\n\nHow We Named The Stars, Andrés N. Ordorica’s debut, is about a Mexican-American teenager, Daniel, who describes himself as ‘quiet, short, geeky and brown’. When he meets his jock roommate Sam at Cayuga University (the invented name seems to be a reference to one of the Native American peoples who are part of the Haudenosaunee/Iroquois confederacy in upstate New York), he’s just relieved that Sam doesn’t bully him. But after they fall in love and Daniel travels briefly back to México to keep an eye on his grandfather, his world is upended when Sam suddenly dies (this is not a spoiler, it is on the first page of the first chapter). Sadly, this novel did not work for me at all. The writing is incredibly repetitive and self-indulgent, reminiscent of Hua Hsu’s Stay True, which is also about a young immigrant man at an American university who suddenly loses a friend. A lot of people rated that one, though, so I’ll let you decide for yourself if this kind of thing is your bag, repeated x 100:\n\nI was happy, and now, looking back, I am grateful I have these memories of you, that I can remember it all with such vividness. Wherever you are, are you remembering it the same way? How the birds flew overhead, weaving from branch to branch, following us as we hiked up the path. How the squirrels scaled trees, chasing one another. Everything had its purpose and understood its seasonality and temporality in that place. Just like us.\n\nDialogue is also clunky, as the characters have the habit of just telling each other exactly what they’re thinking (this feels especially unrealistic for Sam, who is struggling with his sexuality, and is supposedly not being honest with Daniel), and not using contractions:\n\n“Honestly, Daniel, I am so glad you are my roommate,” you said, out of nowhere.\n\n“What makes you say that?”\n\n“You just make me happy. To have someone who is a genuine friend but not in my classes, or on my soccer team, or just like, you know… I know I sound drunk but what I’m trying to say is… well… at the party I was thinking how it’s nice to have a friend who is a friend because we actually get each other. You’re not like other guys, not some self-centred asshole. You’re… you are a really nice person, Daniel.”\n\nI was dismayed to see that How We Named The Stars was picked as one of the Observer’s best debuts of 2024, where it’s billed as ‘joyfully updating the campus novel for the 21st century’ (have there not been plenty of them since the year 2000? Including many gay/immigrant/Black ones?) Like Behind You Is The Sea, this feels very YA. The plot unfolds in manner of a soap opera, which makes it superficially easy to read and kept me flipping pages, but I wasn’t ultimately won over. I’d suggest checking out this review by a gay Latino man that says it better than I can: Augustine Jimenez’s review.\n\nI received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nA recent discussion on Twitter/X has picked up on a problem I’ve long been mulling over in fiction – ‘the plot twist you won’t see coming’. While ‘twists’ in novels have been praised for my entire reading life, and crime fiction has always invited the reader to try and figure out whodunnit, the rise of the psychological thriller over the last fifteen years or so does seem to have fetishised the idea of an unguessable twist as the peak of the reading experience in this genre. I imagine, like so many things in psych thrillers, this dates back to Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl, which does indeed pull off a satisfying twist. But personally, I think the idea of the ‘twist’ has become so distorting that I’ll now deliberately seek out books where other readers complain that there ‘wasn’t a twist’ or that the twist was obvious.\n\nI entirely agree with Julie Gourinchas (@julielaura in that thread) that a twist that is genuinely impossible to guess is usually a bad twist. It’s also, as she implies, just lazy writing. Anybody can sit down and write a story with an unguessable twist. If my contemporary romance ends with the heroine being beamed up by aliens it’s unlikely that anybody will see that coming, but that doesn’t make it good writing. But, for me, even twists that aren’t ‘world-breaking’ often get in the way. Let’s take a plot that is common to a LOT of recent novels, as I don’t want to single anybody out here: a group of female friends go on holiday to a tropical paradise, but one of them starts bumping off the others after past secrets threaten to be revealed. We, the reader, know that one of these women is the killer; but which one is it, and why is she doing this?\n\nThere are obviously readers out there who enjoy treating a book as a parlour game, but for me, this kind of narrative, unless done exceptionally well, severs connection to the characters, especially when the author decides to try the cut-price version of an ‘unreliable narrator’, giving us all the characters’ first-person perspectives but deliberately omitting information in the killer’s story. This kind of guessing game also favours making all of the cast into horrible people so they have motive to kill, and tends to devolve into a mess at the end of the novel, as the writer feels obliged to bait-and-switch us several times before revealing the shocking truth. Bonus points if there’s a final twist on the very last page, which has ruined many a good thriller for me.\n\nAnd yet, I think we’ve all had an amazing reading experience that’s bowled us over with ‘a twist we didn’t see coming’, and the memory of that experience is what keeps us hunting for these twists that genuinely upend our understanding of what we are reading. For me, a few immediately spring to mind, in very different genres. The Red Wedding in George R.R. Martin’s A Storm of Swords. The switch of perspective in Sarah Waters’s Fingersmith. The slow-burn realisation of James Smythe’s The Explorer. The reveal in Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca. But what sets all these novels apart, for me, was that I wasn’t reading for a twist. I didn’t see a twist coming because I didn’t think there was a twist coming, or at least not a twist of that kind. When you manage the reader’s expectations like this, that’s when you can actually deliver those gobsmacking moments.\n\nI enjoy how these three novels look like the same book here.\n\nBut of course, given what the psych thriller has become, this means its authors are increasingly hamstrung: readers want and expect a twist, so you need to give it to them, but you can’t, because they know it’s coming, and are almost certainly going to guess whatever you pull out of your hat unless you violate some established rule of plot or character or world. And it’s notable that people often love certain novels even when they know the twist. I was very, very lucky to read Rebecca unspoiled; on the other hand, I of course knew what happens in The Stepford Wives, but this didn’t detract one iota from my experience. Also, think what happens when great novels are reduced to their plot twists: ‘Mr Rochester has a mad wife in the attic’ is indeed a twist, but it doesn’t explain why people love Jane Eyre.\n\nA final reflection: very few of the twists that I’ve really loved come at the end of a novel. Indeed, what often seems to work best is a really stonking midpoint twist, which of course, is what Gone Girl does so well. When you flip the reader’s understanding of the world or the characters on its head, you also need to give yourself time to pick up the pieces. Again, this is not to say that you can’t write a satisfying ‘twist at the end’ – Orson Scott Card’s Ender’s Game pulls this off, for example – but that it’s really, really hard, and takes great emotional and structural skill. And despite my love of these classic examples, I wish writers would think less about massive twists and more about the gentler twists that are inherent to any good story. We don’t always need to think Oh my God. Sometimes it’s much more satisfying to think Of course.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on twists? Are there any particular twists you love? Any twists that distorted or ruined the story?\n\nI’ve been so busy with conferences over the last week and a half that I’ve done almost no reading. Hence, this post has interrupted our regular 20 Books of Summer scheduling, and I’m also sorry that I’ve not had much time to read other people’s posts. Hopefully, I’ll be back on track soon!\n\nMy next two 20 Books are both second novels; both have attractive pink covers; both are just quite weird; but both won me over, slowly, as they went along…\n\nTrust & Safety, Laura Blackett and Eve Gleichman’s sophomore novel, is a strange little book, and I still don’t quite know what to make of it. The first third made me think this was going to be a tiresomely cringy story about an oblivious rich couple who move from a New York apartment to a fixer-upper in the Hudson Valley after the wife, Rosie, falls in love with the visions of a rural idyll she’s seen on Instagram. The register is obviously satirical, but I wasn’t sure what Blackett and Gleichman were trying to say with their over-the-top depiction of these ignorant people, who think of themselves as queer allies but make gaffes at every turn when they encounter actual lesbians and trans men, and don’t get that ‘butchering’ a chicken might mean killing it. And that early vibe never goes away, but it’s somehow transmuted into something sweeter and funnier. Against all odds, Rosie starts to become more likeable as she gets to know the queer couple, Dylan and Lark, who are renting an outbuilding on their new property. Dylan and Lark seem to have walked straight out of one of the Instagram stories Rosie adores: they eat breakfast at a table ‘outfitted with indigo-dyed linens, matte porcelain plates, mismatched mugs, and a jar of wildflowers’ and Lark keeps ‘a tall wooden cabinet filled with amber jars and bags of dried herbs’. I really enjoyed Dylan’s practicality and her mix of kindness and self-protection, and as she warmed to Rosie, I did too. A gentle twist near the end makes it clearer what this novel is all about, and that it’s not as simple as bad Instagram versus actual reality. And while others have struggled with the ending, I thought Blackett and Gleichman struck the right balance between unrealistic utopia and total cynicism; there’s a sense that change doesn’t happen all at once, but the possibility is still there. By the end, Trust & Safety is quietly compelling. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nIt’s as futile as banging my head against the wall; though Ji-woo once said that if you did that an infinite number of times, your head would pass through – something about the vacuum in the atoms and molecules in your head lining up perfectly.\n\nOn her way to begin her PhD in physiology at Cambridge, Anna witnesses a car wrecked in a ditch and a violent altercation between two men. She drives on, but this incident is mirrored weeks later by a sudden explosion of violence at the Eagle. Signing up to her college’s rowing team, she cycles along the river in ‘the early morning mist’ where ‘cows loomed out of the fog like ghosts’; the same riverside which is occasionally evacuated when unexploded bombs are fished out of the Cam. Plaything, Bea Setton’s sophomore novel, purports to be about the obsessive relationship between Anna and a hot physiotherapist, but feels like it’s about the destructiveness lurking beneath the flatness of everyday life. It takes about half its length to get going but once it does, it’s so worth it. As we’re warned at the start, this is not set in the Cambridge of rose gardens and King’s College Chapel but farther north along the dirty river into Chesterton and Fen Ditton, parts of the place that became familiar to me after living there for nine years but certainly weren’t when I was an undergraduate student. And Setton is an incredible, observational writer; she totally evokes Anna’s inner world, the ‘Anna Show’ she puts on to be socially acceptable and the tumbling paranoia of her actual thoughts. Because Setton is so good at tracking how Anna thinks, the occasional blip in reality when she sees something unreal makes sense rather than feeling like a writerly affectation to amp up the mood. And all of this builds to the novel’s haunting ending, when Setton both sticks the landing on a genuinely gutwrenching twist and then draws us into Anna’s growing fear, as she drives once again past the place where she saw the car wreck with the same song playing: ‘What if I’m in an infinite loop of eternal recurrence, and it’s all about to kick off again?’ Plaything doesn’t actually go meta but it’s so good on that liminal space of reality, the cows appearing from the mist, the gaps between the atoms. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nA weird readalike: I had recurring moments of Bookish Beck’s book serendipity while reading Plaything alongside Noreen Masud’s movingly exact memoir A Flat Place. The flat landscapes of the fens are already familiar to me from my long time in Cambridge, but we also, in both books, encounter cows grazing on common land; Covid-19 lockdowns bringing strange relief; a significant cat with distinctive green eyes; and the derealisation that Masud talks about as a result of her complex PTSD is clearly affecting Anna by the end of Setton’s novel. This made Plaything an even more hallucinatory experience, as my own Cambridge mingled with other people’s versions.\n\nA very frivolous set of Superlatives as all my serious reading has been covered elsewhere this month, and I have to say that June has been a bit blah as far as reading goes. I read some very fun books but no real standouts. Nevertheless…\n\nThe Best Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… Of The Flesh, a remarkably consistent collection of horror short stories. It’s difficult to maintain this standard across a multi-author collection, and I feel that the editor/s deserve a lot of credit here… except that they aren’t named. What is with this trend? Anyway, I enjoyed the variety and diversity of styles here, including one graphic short from Lewis Hancox, ‘Sketchy’, which was one of my favourite contributions. In fact, it would be easier to tell you about the stories that didn’t work for me than the ones that did, as there really were only a couple I didn’t vibe with: Ainslie Hogarth’s ‘Waffle Thomas’ was too experimental for my tastes, and Louisa Young’s ‘Mouse’ a bit obvious. I already knew that I don’t click with Irenosen Okojie’s writing, so I wasn’t surprised not to love ‘Rosheen’ – though it is more straightforwardly told than the bulk of the other short fiction I’ve read from her, which made it stronger for me. But that’s it! And on the other hand, there are some real standouts here. Susan Barker’s haunting ‘Fight, Flight, Freeze’, about a woman pursued across the globe by another woman she wronged, has made me even more excited about her forthcoming horror novel Old Soul. JK Chukwu’s ‘Flight 2212’ packs such a big world into such a small space. Domestic horrors especially hit home: Bridget Collins’s ‘The Fruiting Body’ and Evie Wyld’s ‘The Old Lion’ were both intensely creepy, as was Emilia Hart’s ‘Apples’, which both presented a beautiful moral dilemma and reminded me of the terrifying fruit in Chuck Wendig’s Black River Orchard. It’s so satisfying to turn to the next story in an anthology like this and be pretty confident it’s going to be a banger, so bravo, Borough Press. I received a free proof copy of this collection from the publisher for review. It’s out in the UK on 10th October.\n\nThe Worst Book I Read This Month Was…\n\n… One of Our Kind by Nicola Yoon. Not a competitive category this time. My full review is here.\n\nThe Most Surprisingly Beautiful Love Story This Month Was In…\n\n… The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley. Bradley’s debut novel, one of my most anticipated 2024 releases, is about a young British-Cambodian woman working as a civil servant who is recruited to act as a ‘bridge’ for one of a group of ‘expats’ – people plucked out of their own times shortly before impending death and brought to the present day. Our narrator is assigned Commander Graham Gore, once a naval officer on John Franklin’s ‘lost expedition’ to the Arctic in 1845-8, now trying to adjust to the twenty-first century. I found the first three-fifths of The Ministry of Time entertaining but slow and directionless; then the last fifth goes, jarringly, full time-travel-thriller, with handwavy fake-jargon explanations which only make it clearer that this is not the sort of time travel that makes sense (‘You’re uniquely duplicate in space-time’). But that remaining fifth, when Gore and our protagonist finally get it together? Perfection. I’m very keen to see what Bradley writes next. My full review is on Goodreads. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nThe Author That Pulled Off The Best Genre-Switch This Month Was…\n\n… Zen Cho with her latest novel, The Friend Zone Experiment. I’m a big fan of Cho’s SFF: I absolutely adored her short story collection Spirits Abroad and loved her novel Black Water Sister. So when I saw that she’d made an unexpected genre-switch into contemporary romance, I had to check it out. First things first: I think this is a bit misjacketed and definitely mistitled. It’s less of a straightforward contemporary romance and more a knotty Asian family story, with romance: I’d have called it something like Family Business. Both our Malaysian-Chinese protagonists – Renee and Ket Siong – are deeply entwined with their family’s problems and held back by family secrets. For me, this made The Friend Zone Experiment a lot more satisfying than the typical will-they-won’t-they, as both leads have genuine reasons to hesitate about getting involved, both in the past and the present, that aren’t based on stupid misunderstandings. The dry humour that I’ve loved in Cho’s other writing is still present here, as well. I was fascinated by the way that familiar plotlines, e.g. breaking free from the corrupt family business, took on new emotional weight in this novel because of the way Cho wrote them. I got properly invested in the relationship between Renee and her brother, for example. Having said all this, The Friend Zone Experiment, unsurprisingly, is much more conventional than Cho’s SFF, and for me, less interesting. It does what it does well but I hope Cho doesn’t continue to focus on this genre. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review. It’s out in the UK on 8th August.\n\nThe Domestic Thriller That Could Have Pushed Its Concept Much Further This Month Was…\n\n… Cutting Teeth by Chandler Baker. I enjoyed Baker’s The Husbands, which was a gender-flipped version of The Stepford Wives, so I was intrigued to read Cutting Teeth, which promised an epidemic of vampiric four-year-olds at an exclusive preschool. Sadly, this one didn’t work as well for me. I’m not quite sure it knows what it wants to be: is it an exploration of the pressures on mothers via a murder mystery, or a darker satire about how children bleed you dry? Personally, I wanted more of the latter and less of the former, as there are plenty of domestic thrillers about the unreasonable expectations placed on mothers already. Baker somehow manages to make this premise feel almost too normal, as she labels the children’s biting and blood-drinking ‘paediatric Renfield’s syndrome’ (RM Renfield is Dracula’s servant in the original Dracula) and makes it seem like a behavioural phase. I wanted her to push the concept further, make it darker and weirder, and yet have the mothers still desperately try to rationalise it. There are still some nicely twisted moments, and it’s a fun read, but less original than I’d hoped. Interestingly, the original US cover leans into the concept more while the UK rejacketing makes this look like any domestic thriller, complete with the infamous house-in-darkness-with-yellow-windows. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nThe Most Fun I Had With A Book This Month Was With…\n\n…How To Survive A Horror Movie by Scarlett Dunmore. This is a spectacularly silly YA novel about a teenage girl, Charley, who realises somebody’s bumping off the other girls in her year at an isolated boarding school in the Irish Sea. Charley’s horror film obsession means she’s armed with a knowledge of all the tropes she has to watch out for, and she also teams up with the ghosts of those who have already died – but will she be able to figure out the mystery before the Halloween formal, when the plot will obviously come to a head? The first few chapters of How To Survive A Horror Movie struggle to find the right tongue-in-cheek tone – in particular, starting with a long description of the cool girls at school probably seemed like a good idea if you’re thinking of the establishing shot of a teen movie, but doesn’t work at all for a novel. However, once the ghosts appear, I found this consistently funny and engaging. I did miss the Fear Street/Scream vibes I was anticipating – despite the references to ‘senior class’ in the blurb, this is set in Ireland, and I wanted more of a US high school feel. Nevertheless, this definitely stands out from the crowd of YA horror novels by just having a very good time with its source material. And of course, there’s a sequel. I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review. It’s out in the UK on 5th September.\n\nHow was your June in books? Any standouts or disappointments? Tempted by any of these?\n\nAny horror story could be said to work in two pieces: the fear of being wholly alone and of realising that one has company.\n\nJulia Armfield’s debut novel, Our Wives Under The Sea, was one of my top ten books of 2022, so it’s not surprising that I found her second, Private Rites, a bit disappointing in comparison. Private Rites follows three queer sisters, Isla, Irene and Agnes, as they face the slow dissolving of their world in the face of climate chaos. Rain is almost constant and floods are increasingly common, but like the Canadians in Fort McMurray who dropped off their dry-cleaning as a catastrophic wildfire was approaching, the sisters continue living their everyday lives, working at coffee shops, offering therapy sessions and negotiating romantic relationships. The event that ruptures their world is not a tsunami nor a maelstrom but the death of their distant architect father and their revisiting of the house he designed himself, which is ‘both transparent and impenetrable’. ‘It was built to rise above water… strung with ribbon windows that run to fifty feet on either side, it streams from north to south as a single linear form… Its legs are mechanical, extending as necessary to match the rising water levels… Easy to watch the water lap against the bottom of the windows and miss the fact that the house is rising higher to account for this encroachment’. Honestly, it sounds a bit like Halley VI.\n\nThe house the sisters inherit is a tremendous metaphor for the world they live in, and Armfield’s writing is as brilliant as ever. She is so good at writing both emotion and description, at making us feel many different kinds of rain. For me, though, Private Rites felt too diffuse. It obviously lacks the taut plot-thread that led us through Our Wives, but that in itself wouldn’t have been a problem for me; I think writing a great plot is much harder than we’re led to believe, but I’ve also enjoyed many a plotless book. What I struggled with was the way we dance between the sisters’ points of view and even once, into the heads of two of their partners. Irene was the only sister who really comes into full focus, as Isla and Agnes fail to move beyond the stock roles they are forced to play (Isla->older sister->emotionally closed->needs to be in control; Agnes->younger sister->free spirit->scared of commitment->frustrates her older sisters with her scattiness). And even Irene felt hard to grasp hold of because we are constantly being whisked away from her as soon as we connect with her. I would have loved Armfield to have trapped the sisters in the house, together, earlier on in the book. Although Private Rites is a much better novel, the scattering of its cast reminded me a little of Coco Mellor’s Blue Sisters, which only really worked for me when all the living sisters were in the same room.\n\nPrivate Rites has been framed as more ambitious than Our Wives Under The Sea, even if it’s not totally successful, but while I’d agree that this is an ambitious novel, I think that assessment underplays just how good Our Wives is. As I wrote at the time, it’s so, so difficult to achieve that kind of crossover between literary and speculative fiction, and to write an ending as powerful as the ending of Our Wives, which brings both strands together. It looks simple because it tells an old story about strange monsters under the sea, but its straightforwardness hides its accomplishment. Private Rites, in contrast, is not a horror novel, and not meant to be. It aims for the same kind of emotional-speculative intertwining in its climax, but it felt too sudden, and fell short. Having said that, though, I’m still a huge Armfield fan. This book was worth reading for the line I quoted at the start of this review alone, but it’s also, despite its unevenness, the best account of everyday apocalypse I’ve ever encountered.\n\nI received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review.\n\nThe beguines of medieval Europe were lay religious orders of women who lived in community but did not take monastic vows. As the translator, Susan Emanuel, explains in her afterword to Aline Kiner’s The Mirror of Simple Souls, becoming a beguine allowed women to follow a different path outside ‘the binary choice between marriage and the cloister’. This liminal space attracted fear and suspicion from authorities. In the late thirteenth century, the Parisian satirist Rutebeuf ridiculed these women for what he saw as the inherent contradictions in their lives:\n\nIf the Beguine marries,\n\nThat is her conversion:\n\nSince her vows, her profession\n\nAre not for life.\n\nNow she weeps and then she prays,\n\nAnd then she will take a husband:\n\nNow she is Martha, now she is Mary;\n\nNow she is chaste, now she marries.\n\nBut do not speak ill of her.\n\nThe king will not tolerate it.\n\nAs this suggests, the beguines of early fourteenth-century Paris, on which this novel focuses, had enjoyed royal protection for their way of life and their beguinage, the walled haven in which most of the women lived. At the time Rutebeuf was writing, King Louis IX was a staunch supporter of mendicant orders like the Franciscans, who were responsible for the spiritual guidance of the beguines. But when this novel opens, Louis is long dead and there are ongoing tensions between the current king, Philip the Fair, and the pope. Hundreds of warrior monks, the Templars, have been arrested after malicious rumours about their practices and the beguine Marguerite Porete has been accused of heresy for her work of religious mysticism, The Mirror of Simple Souls. This novel starts with Marguerite burning at the stake, the only medieval author to be executed for a book.\n\nL: The last existing beguinage, in Antwerp; R: an image of beguines\n\nThe Mirror of Simple Souls was originally published in French as La nuit des béguines [The Night of the Beguines], recognising the doom approaching this Parisian order in a time of turmoil. Although beguines continued to practice in the Low Countries, the Parisian beguinage was closed in 1317, just after this novel finishes, after a set of decrees published by Pope John XXII condemned and banned them. The canon Jean de Saint-Victor wrote at the time, ‘The beguines no longer sing, the beguines no longer read’. This sense of menace is visible from early on in The Mirror of Simple Souls, as an older beguine, Ysabel, reflects that something is up with the weather: ‘The winters have become steadily harsher. In 1303, a frost scorched the earth… In 1308, on the first Saturday after Ascension, a snowstorm made more destructive by huge hailstones devastated the region around Paris… And on 30th October 1309, a wind blew for an hour that was so strong it made the stone arches of Saint-Denis cathedral tremble’.\n\nKiner is brilliant at conveying these complex histories throughout her novel. The Mirror of Simple Souls is the opposite of much bad histfic which seizes upon an exciting setting and then just uses it to play out modern cliches. This book is steeped in the story of the Parisian beguines, and it’s fascinating. I love novels about nuns but I had no idea that so many medieval European women lived in this different kind of religious space. Kiner also writes well about her two principal settings: the beguinage itself and a silk workshop where some of the beguines work. If there’s a medieval setting I truly adore other than a nunnery, it’s a craft workshop, so this was right up my street.\n\nHaving said that, I didn’t love The Mirror of Simple Souls as much as I wanted to, despite its great strengths. The central cast of beguines are serviceable enough characters but never quite sparked into life for me. They fulfil slightly stock roles in this kind of book: the older herbalist, the intelligent woman who dabbles in forbidden texts, the rebellious redhead who wants to flee the institution, the one who has her nose in everybody’s business. The plot reminded me of Sarah Dunant’s Sacred Hearts but without the same kind of emotional depth. The Mirror of Simple Souls is absolutely worth reading, but it’s inspired me to seek out more non-fiction about the beguines (the go-to seems to be Tanya Stabler Miller’s work) rather than to really take this book to my heart.\n\nI received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review. It will be published in the UK by indie Pushkin Press TOMORROW, Tuesday 25th June.\n\nI will be back later this week with a review of another of my 20 Books that focuses on themes of sisterhood, freaky weather, and a world that’s slowly coming to an end…"
