        "text": "To: UI Special Collections\n\nFiction with an Iowa City Setting:\n\nAn Updated Checklist\n\nEARL M. ROGERS\n\nFrom Books at Iowa 55 (November 1991)\n\nCopyright: The University of Iowa\n\n[Ed. note: The following article incorporates additional citations reported by Mr. Rogers as of October 2010.]\n\nIowa City and The University of Iowa have been home for many writers. The Iowa Writers Workshop and the International Writing Program are at present the best-known cultivators of writing on the University campus. But student publications, especially the Iowa Literary Magazine (1924-30), and the encouragement of writers by the Department of English are traditions that began much earlier. Students, professors, and visitors have sometimes turned to the local scene for their subjects. This checklist is an expansion and revision of a 1986 article in Books at Iowa. [1]\n\nMany works fall into the category of academic novels, primarily about students or professors. Published studies and bibliographies of academic novels list several UI novels and supply a context for them. [2] The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, which forms a large part of the Iowa City community, has also provided subjects for novelists. Athletics and homosexuality are becoming new topics for local literary exploration, once in the same novel (it would be unfair to reveal which one).\n\nMany of these novels bring out-of-state visitors to the University or the city, giving their writers an opportunity to comment on local characteristics or problems. In many of the novels of the sixties and later decades, several patterns can be discerned. Counterculture sexual behavior, drugs, student demonstrations, avaricious landlords, farmhouses, and Volkswagens can be anticipated as almost a set formula. The downtown Iowa City urban renewal project continues to be severely criticized, both for the closing of Harold Donnelly's and Irene Kenney's bars and for the allegedly poor architectural quality of the new buildings. Several writers who refer to Meredith Willson, author of The Music Man, mistakenly assume that his \"River City\" refers to Iowa City, not Mason City, and all of them misspell his name as \"Wilson.\" Old Capitol, the University's central building and symbol, unsurprisingly, is almost always in the background. The University president, for whatever reasons, is rarely mentioned in Iowa City novels, unlike novels set at other academic institutions. Local places and people may be portrayed with their real names but more often they are disguised. Writers sometimes make obvious factual errors, though these gaffes do not usually detract from their stories.\n\nThe current reputations of the following authors seem to stand in direct proportion to the quality of their writings. Vance Bourjaily's Now Playing at Canterbury is probably the best novel for description of Iowa City and the University and for portraying the state of mind of its characters. Philip Roth's Letting Go and John Irving's The World According to Garp are important novels with comparatively little on Iowa City. The athletic novels by David Shields and W. P. Kinsella are more entertaining to read than most on the list. Elizabeth Hardwick has the best lines about reactions to Iowa City; her comments should be compared to nonfiction articles by John Cheever and others. [3]\n\nThe novels, poems, short stories, and creative writing dissertations listed below are set, at least in part, in Iowa City. The annotations concentrate on the Iowa City settings rather than on character development or literary value. I am grateful to the many people who gave me leads to the following works; their interest and assistance are appreciated. [4] Several printed sources have also been useful in identifying Iowa City fiction. [5] Only a few examples from International Writing Program participants have been found. The compiler alone is responsible for omissions and errors of interpretation. Additions will be welcomed.\n\nAgee, Jonis. SWEET EYES. New York: Crown, 1991. 405 pp. Divinity, a small town in Iowa on the Mercy River, is about to celebrate its centennial. The characters remember a local murder and other events in the sixties. The young people then visited Des Moines, Iowa City, and Spirit Lake. \"We'd heard the stories about how wild it was getting in Iowa City with hippies and radicals.\" A high school student and her friend sat in on a history class in Iowa City. \"I remember once I cut school and went over there, just Clinton and me, and he took me right onto campus, walking directly to this big gray stone building, inside, up the stairs and down the hall, and right into the back of this class that was just starting. Up in front there was this guy wearing a plaid shirt and a pair of jeans tucked into hunting boots. I guessed he was the teacher because he was the one talking, but you wouldn't know it from anything else, except maybe the pipe he kept playing with.\" A rich fat man in Divinity is named Leigh Hunt. The author may have taken the name from the poor thin English literary figure whose works are collected by The University of Iowa Libraries.\n\nAlvarez, Carlos. REFLEJOS EN EL IOWA RIVER: DIVERTIMENTO EN TONO MENOR. Madrid: Editorial Origenes, 1984. 77 pp. A Spanish student in the International Writing Program publishes poems inspired by such subjects as the river, the Iowa City bus station, the Johnson County jail, the Bijou theater, and the Mayflower apartments.\n\nAsala, Joanne, ed.

Some of the writings have the Iowa River, Donnelly's bar, or other local settings as their subjects.\n\nBaker, Larry. ATHENS, AMERICA. St. Augustine, Fla.: First Coast Books, 2005. 300 pp. Iowa City is in disguise, based on the shooting death of a sculptor-businessman by a policeman, 1995, and on Baker's two terms on the city council. The actual killing, in which everyone involved was white, is turned into a deadly car chase with racial overtones. Most personal names are altered. Locations range from the downtown pedestrian mall to the municipal cemetery (Oakland) with its Black Angel tomb sculpture.\n\nBarza, Steven Lee. SCISSORS, PAPER, ROCK: A NOVEL. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Iowa, 1975. 348 pp. Here is a novel apparently set in but not really about Iowa City. One major character teaches at Casehill College and rents a farmhouse in Amishland, on the highway beyond the Joetown flat. Except for the Inner City Revival Program and its streets blocked for repaving, the town, Stockton, in central Illinois, does not physically resemble either Iowa City or the genuine Stockton in Illinois near Galena.\n\nBeachy, Stephen Eric. THE WHISTLING SONG. New York: Norton, 1991. 411 pp. Matt, an orphan from Des Moines, is placed at the East Liberty Home for Boys. The boys \"were not forgotten. Every Halloween they came, busloads of sorority girls from the university, to help us carve smiling or snarling faces in pumpkins. The local television station was close behind, dutifully recording this heartwarming scene of philanthropy for all to see.\" The novel is expanded from Beachy's M.F.A. thesis, Iowa, 1990.\n\nBeard, Jo Ann.

The author's collie is dying, her husband left her but telephones her constantly, and squirrels loudly occupy her spare bedroom.

New York: Holt, 2002. 348 pp. Gurny, a Maquoketa native at the University of Iowa, learns that he will be a father. \"There were sitting in the Union, drinking coffee, looking over the frozen Iowa River...\" The mother-to-be ate at the Thai Star Café.

Fayette, Ia.: Iowa Authors Publishing Company, 1983. 268 pp. An Iowa country doctor set his first novel at the University in Iowa City. A rape victim and her rescuer, both freshman athletes from farm families, meet through violence and find love. The author's philosophizing overwhelms his characters' speech. Physicians at the University Hospitals are praised highly; lawyers fare less well.\n\nBirkbeck, John. DONNELLYS BEVERAGE: POEMS. Edited by Sue Rogers. Photography by Steve Moon. Iowa City: Left Bank Press, 1976. 51 pp., illus. The poems are set in the former Donnelly's bar or are about people in Iowa City.\n\nBlackwell, Elise. GRUB.

Among them are Jackson Miller and Eddie Renfros, both graduates of the Iowa Writers' Workshop.\n\nBlaise, Clark. LUSTS. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1983. 253 pp. Philip Roth, then only 28, leads a story discussion in the Iowa Writers' Workshop in this novel by Clark Blaise, who both studied and taught in the Workshop. The hero spends two years in Iowa City in the early sixties, a crucial interlude in a life stretching from Pittsburgh through Kentucky and New York to India. His life is changed forever in Iowa when a splinter on a library table severs an artery. Shortly before that painful event, he headed \"uphill to Kenney's Bar, where the writers hung out, and over pitchers of beer and schooners of popcorn,\" they \"would batter each other silly with opinions, with trivia, with judgments. We found all the soft spots in allegedly great stories.\" Clark Blaise is now director of the International Writing Program and husband of author Bharati Mukherjee.\n\nBourjaily, Vance. NOW PLAYING AT CANTERBURY. New York: Dial Press, 1976. 518 pp. Bourjaily, formerly of the Iowa Writers Workshop, uses State University, State City, along the State River, as the setting for a novel centered around the opening of a new auditorium in 1972. (The new Hancher Auditorium on The University of Iowa campus was dedicated in 1972.) Several professors (one of whom, like the author, owns a farm near the town) and students produce a new opera and live the antiwar protests of the sixties and early seventies. Former Territorial [Old Capitol], that lovely, calm, gold-domed antique building,\" watches the battles in the streets. Students occupy the office of tall, scholarly President Lawrence Esterhart and try to prevent a Dow Chemical interview. \"Half the Value for Twice the Rent\" is the landlords' first commandment according to the students who live on one block, and the description of their housing confirms every complaint.\n\nBoyle, T.C.

Boston: Little, Brown, 1979. 219 pp. Grace and Rubie's on North Linn Street in Iowa City in the mid-seventies inspired a short story about a man determined to eat in their restaurant. \"It is a women's restaurant. Men are not permitted. Women go there to be in the company of other women, to sit in the tasteful rooms beneath the ancient revolving fans and the cool green of spilling plants...\n\nBradbury, Malcolm. STEPPING WESTWARD. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1966. 390 pp. The English university professor and novelist Malcolm Bradbury writes about an English novelist visiting an American university that in no way resembles Iowa. However, on the boat train and ocean liner to America, the fictional novelist meets a girls' college bagpipe band returning from a European tour. \"It was a great success. They have had enormous audiences in Paris and Rome and Salzburg and Vienna and London. Europe is fascinated by American girls playing the bagpipes.\" Scotland also enjoyed the pretty girls with bare knees.

The short story by the conservative writer is about the efforts to keep a third-party candidate out of a scheduled televised presidential campaign debate in 1992. The third-party (Peace Now!) candidate is Iowa farm boy, war hero, and millionaire businessman Lemuel S. Ellington III. In the first half of the story (August 20, page 31), Ellington's education is described: \"Simultaneously he did graduate work at the University of Iowa, where, during his five years of night work....

The student and his own wife were squeezed into a one-room apartment. \"Although only of moderate size this single room had so many recesses given over to some function of housekeeping usually placed alone that there was hardly anything, unless it might be the little spot in the center covered with a tiny, red tufted rug, that could properly be called the living room itself.\" Most of the transients in this university town \"'simply abhorred the place with a manic volubility. The aliens who had settled for good had more troubled minds, recalling sometimes with a sigh the lost hills and bays of San Francisco, horseback riding in Arizona, and most of all the great East from the Green at Concord to the steak and fish houses of Baltimore.... Here also at the University were many teachers from Europe ... remarkable souls pacing the Iowa pavements.... They were in America, no doubt about that, even if perhaps they had not bargained for so completely the real thing and wondered at their fate.\"\n\nHarter, Evelyn. DR. KATHERINE BELL.

We have a drugstore with a soda fountain.... It's dark and cool and you can smell malt in the air like a musky perfume.

The clergyman is at the center of the student antiwar demonstrations in \"Iowa City, a turn-of-the-century town whose Victorian rooming houses and maple-shaded walks still held out against the bulldozers and transit-mix concrete trucks. A gold-domed Old Capitol building presided over a University which sprawled along both banks of the Iowa River. On its steps a hoarse speaker was haranguing a circle of thirty students. \"Facing it the town appeared to be under siege. In a doorway a merchant swept shattered glass into a dustpan. Many show windows had been replaced by widths of plywood. The few which had been spared were protected by embrasures of chickenwire.... There was a smell of destruction in the air.\"'\n\nLehrman, Robert. DEFECTORS.

I sighed after the art majors with paint stains on their clothes, actors who posed themselves in the student-union cafeteria, talking and gesturing self-confidently, musicians who carried scores and instruments with them and vanished into the listening room, where my sorority sisters had forbidden me to go because just sitting and listening to classical music was a waste of time.\"\n\nLovely, Stephen.

Lincoln, Neb.: iUniverse, 2008. 206 pp. The mystery is loosely based on the murder of a pre-nursing sophomore in a dormitory room at the University of Iowa in 1973. The novel's victim is a female doctor, an intern at the university hospital, who has had several lovers, all potential suspects. The protagonist is a newspaper reporter and Ph.D. candidate, a divorcee with her own lovers, including some of the suspects. There is much description of Iowa City in the 1970s: Summit Street, sororities, Hamburg Inn, the Pentacrest campus buildings, Rainer (i.e. Rienow) Hall murder site, canoe house (converted to an artist's studio), the Art Museum with its enormous Jackson Pollock artwork, Whetstone's drug store, and the Joffrey Ballet. Seventies events appear: antiwar protest, urban renewal, a Jewish police chief. A version of the Bednasek trial (see Elizabeth Hardwick's fictional account in this checklist) is included.

Just before her sophomore year, she works as a legal secretary in a murder trial strongly resembling the real-life case in Elizabeth Hardwick's The Simple Truth. The Lark restaurant in Tiffin, Professor Mosse of history, and \"the golden dome of Old Capitol\" are mentioned in passing. A glass of wine with a dinner at the Lark may be an anachronism. \"There never seemed to be time to contemplate the pool below the Law Commons with its rugged rock wall, to cut through the art building and smell the paint, to mosey across the acres of formally-patterned carpet in the Union ballroom.\"\n\nMcMenamin, Thomas John.

Evans, 1967. 239 pp. The Laysan Island cyclorama, in The University of Iowa Museum of Natural History, Macbride Hall, is the result of a collecting expedition by the museum in 1911. This juvenile novel is about a follow-up expedition to Laysan, now part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The hero, a freshman at the University in a little college town on the Iowa River, \"bears some outward resemblance to Alfred M. Bailey ... the Director of the Denver Museum of Natural History.\" Bailey (1894-1978), an Iowa City native, was a member of such an expedition, 1912-13. The hero's mother buys her furniture at the Amana Colonies. The author repeats the discredited theory that the Mound Builders were not Indians.\n\nNelson, Peter N. COOLEY AND KEDNEY. Iowa Review 14, no. 1 (Winter 1984): 73-102.

Boston: Beacon Press, 1988. 207 pp. This novel by the retired director of the International Writing Program at The University of Iowa ends with a Chinese widow living in Lone Tree, Iowa (big enough to have a parochial high school and one-way streets), surviving an automobile accident, and escaping from Mercy Hospital. Perhaps her \"Lone Tree\" is inspired by Iowa City. Mulberry and Peach was written and published in Chinese and translated into English (first published in 1981) and other languages.\n\nOlsen, Lance. LIVE FROM EARTH. New York: Ballantine Books, 1991. 196 pp. Bink Fischer, a native of Des Moines, returns from Vietnam in 1973 to be accepted by \"the Writers' Workshop at the University in Iowa City\" where he has a teaching assistantship. \"He rented a neat apartment in a brick building on Woodside Drive a block from a small park with two swings in it. The town reminded him of photographs he had seen of Hiroshima the day after they dropped the bomb, virtually no traffic, a barren landscape, a number of half-finished construction sites.\" The time is during Iowa City's urban renewal period. \"Every Tuesday afternoon he walked to campus, up the poorly lit stairs of the English-Philosophy Building, down the dim brick-lined hall, and into a white room where fifteen other writers had gathered.\" The novel has briefer mentions of Grinnell College and the University of Virginia. Virginia becomes Bink's base for his save-the-whales campaign.\n\nPalmer, Michael. THE PATIENT. New York: Bantam Books, 2000. 324 pp. The medical thriller opens in Iowa City. A successful neurologist \"gazed out at the countryside, where late afternoon shadows were lengthening across the Iowa River.\" His \"gleaming seven-story Mays Institute for Neurological Surgery had put Iowa City on the map and brought millions of dollars in research and industrial development grants to the university.\" The action swiftly moves to Boston.\n\nPorter, William E.

The author, who rose to the rank of professor of journalism at Iowa and is now retired from the University of Michigan, told his local readers that the setting, Hilltop, Iowa, was not modeled on Iowa City, but the local newspaper is the Citizen. In this serial, the Lost Indian River \"nicks a corner off the Gideon College campus.\" The characters include jewel thieves, murderers, and a college president who will do almost anything for contributions. The climax is at the college commencement. Near Hilltop is \"the tractor plant in Cedar Rapids,\" where there has never been such a factory.\n\nRacine, David. BO KNOWS FICTION. New Yorker 66, no. 5 (March 19, 1990): 38-40. Bo, writer and baseball and football player, performs with his Smith-Corona at Madison Square Garden in front of a raucus crowd of New Yorkers.

New York is the second stop and Iowa City will be the fourth on Bo's six-city itinerary across the country before his summer of creativity is published by E.P. Dutton. \"The Iowa stop, at Carver-Hawkeye Arena, on the University of Iowa campus, has been sold out for weeks.\"\n\nReuter, Linda. FROM LITTLE HAWK TO HAWKEYE.

New York: Harper & Row, 1975. 379 pp. Sharon Center, Iowa, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, are the settings, but the Iowa City railway station is the scene of key transitions in the life of a small boy growing to young manhood. His description of Iowa City is concise. \"'Not big. There's a university there. Thats nearly as big as the whole town.\"\n\nRinehart, Steven. BUILT IN A DAY. New York: Doubleday, 2003. 241 pp. A youth counselor in Iowa City experiences marital problems and sexual distractions. At age 34, he still lacks the final credits to earn a bachelor's degree. Local references include Procter and Gamble factory, Coralville strip and Coralville Mall, Hancher Auditorium footbridge, Emma Goldman clinic, Prairie Lights bookstore, Dirty John's grocery, and Prairie du Chien (the street). The protagonist describes the town after classes resume. \"Iowa City had opened up in the last few weeks and gorged itself on humanity. Kids, parents, scholars, professors, shoe store owners, cops. The town was full again, everyone had money.\"\n\nRoth, Philip. LETTING GO. New York: Random House, 1962. 630 pp. Letting Go opens at The University of Iowa in the fall of 1953. The hero and his friends are graduate students, living in apartments and in married students' barracks. Coe College, where one student also teaches, and Dubuque Street are named, but Roth concentrates on the lives of his characters rather than on the setting.\n\nSandford, John, pseud. SHADOW PREY. New York: Putnam, 1990. 318 pp. At the end of an early volume of the author's Minnesota series of thrillers, his hero \"sat in an easy chair and watched an Iowa-Notre Dame football game. Notre Dame was losing and no amount of prayer would help.\" (The last game in the long series between the two schools had been scheduled for Nov. 23, 1963, cancelled because of the assassination of President Kennedy the day before.)\n\nSandroff, Ronni. PARTY PARTY: GIRLFRIENDS: TWO SHORT NOVELS. New York: Knopf, 1975. 196 pp. Both novelettes are set in Candle City, Iowa, which has the Mainliner bar and College and Market streets. One can walk \"down past the hospital complex, under the campus elms, past the girls' dormitories into the suppertime emptiness of the downtown area.\" Among minor characters in Party Party, \"Kenny Loren owns a bookstore in town and prints the local Socialist sheet in his cellar. He's forty years old.\" Some readers may be reminded of the now-defunct Paper Place bookstore.\n\nShammas, Anton. ARABESQUES. New York: Harper & Row, 1988. 263 pp. An excerpt was published as \"The Storyteller, Mayflower,\" in The World Comes to Iowa: Iowa International Anthology, edited by Paul Engle and Rowena Torrevillas, pp. 66-74. Ames: Iowa State University Press, 1987. 295 pp. The original novel here translated into English is remarkable for being written in Hebrew by an Israeli Christian Arab. It was published in Tel Aviv in 1986 and was a best-seller in Israel. Four sections of Arabesques are set at the Mayflower dormitory at The University of Iowa, where the author, like his namesake character, attended the International Writing Program and met Paul and Hualing Nieh Engle. \"There is a special savor to evenings at the Engles'.\" Along the ride downtown from the Mayflower, past the white houses, \"[s]quirrels rushed about at the feet of the trees, their tails erect with midwestern pride.\" Later in the program, \"the red hush of Indian summer in the foliage of the maples ... pauses over the waters of the river and floats down with the falling leaves.\" Soon after, \"[w]inter shows the first signs of its coming, then lurks in ambush behind the thinning foliage.\"\n\nShattuck, Katharine.

New York: McDowell, Obolensky, 1958. 279 pp. A professor and his wife and daughter and their guest, a young woman who has completed her student years, spend a summer in the country at a stone mansion above Rockville, Kansas, a quarrying ghost town. The setting strongly resem bles Paul Engle's former summer house at Stone City, Iowa, \"the stone church with its square tower ... the single winding road on which the town was strung ... most of all the mansion house on the hill.\" At the end of the summer the group returns to an unnamed university town with a hospital hill. Robert Frost was at a party in the town a few nights before the novel began.\n\nShields, David. HEROES. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1984. 347 pp. To date, the only Ul basketball novel is Heroes. A sportswriter for the River City Register investigates a recruiting scandal involving the River State University Stallions, an Oxford, Iowa, philanthropist who \"gets hospital wings named after him,\"' and the reporter's own wife, who hopes to get tenure in English. The reporter, his wife, and their seven-year-old diabetic son are unusually appealing fictional characters in their reactions and weaknesses. The novelist condemns the Downtown Refurbishment Project, which gutted the best bar in Johnston [sic] County. \"The pedestrian greenway and Sycamore Mall and Plaza Center [sic] One have ruined this town, and now the Old Capitol Center promises to bury it under eight feet of cement.\" His newspaper's wackiest columnist, Susie Smyth, \"takes her show-stopping vamp-stripper parody to motel lounges and bars around town.\" River City has the River State Clinics, KHAK and KRNA, the downtown Rec Center, the Coralville Strip (studied by a university class), and the Coralville Reservoir.\n\nSiciliano, Sam. BLOOD FARM. New York: Pageant Books, 1988. 336 pp. You think the farm crisis was bad? This \"Iowa Gothic\" horror novel's circumstances are much worse. Angela, the heroine, is hitching to Iowa City on the interstate on a below-zero February night in 1972 when she becomes the prisoner of a vampire. Angela's boyfriend seeks help in Iowa City at Center East, the former Catholic Student Center. \"The black metal of the fire escapes zigzagged back and forth, stuck to the flat wall of red brick.\" Nearby were the dormitories, \"modern edifices of glass and gaudy orange brick,\" the Green Cross drugstore, an unnumbered Hamburger Inn, and the Congregational Church, \"the gray-brown building complete with ornate windows and a pointed steeple.\" The novel is dedicated to Professors Archibald Coolidge and W.R. Irwin.\n\nSiddons, Anne Rivers. FOX'S EARTH. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1981. 477 pp. At a university in Georgia, a visiting professor of English has \"been to the University of Iowa in Iowa City. That's near Cedar Rapids, in case you're interested.\" He was a Rhodes scholar, \"bummed around Europe,\" \"finished graduate school at New Haven,\" and \"came back to Iowa City and started teaching English. Full circle.\" The newly-divorced professor came to Georgia to seduce the wife of his department chairman.\n\nSilkman, Anne. HERKY: A BIOGRAPHY. Illustrated by Nori Cornick. Fort Madison, Ia.: Foley Printing and Graphic Design, 1984. 32 pp. Herky, son of Tommy and Kitty, was a \"special baby hawk.\" \"One day, while Herky was on a training flight with his dad . . .\" over a rectangular stadium, he \"dove to where he could see men in black and yellow uniforms running and falling and kicking. He could hear cheering and yelling. It was so exciting!\"' Herky, whose life is told in cartoons, worked hard to be a Hawkeye, becoming a student, football and basketball player, and wrestler. His younger sister Holly is headed for the women's basketball team.\n\nSpivak, Talbot. THE BRIDE WORE THE TRADITIONAL GOLD. New York: Knopf, 1972. 196 pp. The bride teaches Sanskrit poetry to Iowa undergraduates while her husband commutes to teach drugstore Latin at a liberal arts college sixty miles south of their Johnson County farmhouse.

Minneapolis: New Rivers Press, 1997. 155 pp. The title story is set in Coralville, Iowa City's suburb. The manager of the Nutty Squirrel, a self storage firm, lives in one of the cubicles and refers to educational testing, a tenured researcher, and a house full of dental students. Another story mentions a former teacher's college.\n\nStegner, Wallace. BEYOND THE GLASS MOUNTAIN. Harper's Magazine 194 (May 1947): 446-52. Also in his The Women on the Wall, pp. 1-14. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1950. 277 pp. Two alumni, an Iowa City businessman and a Yale professor, meet after 17 years apart. The visitor from Yale \"found himself at the corner of College and Dubuque Streets in Iowa City, at a little past ten on a Sunday morning in May, and as he stopped on the corner to let a car pass, the utter and passionate familiarity of everything smote him like a wind. ...the stone lace of the hospital tower . . . the union and the reserve library [Old Armory] strung out along the riverbank. . . . \" He climbed the hill to the field house. \"He would have liked to go in under the big round roof just to soak himself in the sensations he remembered: smell of lockers opened on stale gym clothes and stiff sweated socks; steam and thumping radiators and liquid soap smell; sweat and medicated foot baths and the chlorine smell and the jiggly reflecting chemical blue of the pool ....\n\nStegner, Wallace. CROSSING TO SAFETY. New York: Random House, 1987. 277 pp. The first part of the novel is set at the University of Wisconsin in the late thirties, with Madison locations and two of its four lakes, Mendota and Monona. However, the narrator is said to be Stegner himself and another major character, Sid Lang, is said to be modeled on the late Wilbur Schramm, professor of English, first director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, and director of the School of Journalism before leaving for a distinguished career at other universities. The sailboat sinking on page 114 is supposed to have really happened on Lake Macbride, near Iowa City.\n\nStegner, Wallace. FIRE AND ICE. New York: Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1941. 214 pp. Stegner, who earned his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Iowa and who became a distinguished novelist and teacher of writing at Stanford University, wrote Fire and Ice about a desperately poor freshman active in the Young Communist League while holding down several student jobs at once. There is little physical description of the campus (or is it Wisconsin?) and town but Stegner finely portrays the mind of his fictional student and the reactions of the other characters.\n\nStegner, Wallace.

EXCERPTS FROM THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CONSTANCE TURABIAN. Vital Signs (April 1982): 1, 6. A short story in the medical students' newsletter is a parody set against the background of the fictional University of Iowa Sportswriter's Workshop.

Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2001. 216 pp. In the second volume of a series, a rare book librarian at the University of New Mexico attempts to solve a Southwestern literary mystery and possible murder. \"The novel read as if it had been written by a graduate of the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, which to Claire meant intensely personal observations ending in an epiphany that she couldn't share. She glanced at the author photo and bio on the back flap. The bio confirmed that the author had graduated from the University of Iowa.\"\n\nVermillion, Mary. DEATH BY DISCOUNT. Los Angeles: Alyson Books, 2004. 275 pp. An Iowa City lesbian speeds down I-80 to her home town, where her aunt has been murdered after campaigning against the arrival of Wal-Mart.

MURDER BY MASCOT. Los Angeles: Alyson Books, 2006. 272 pp. The second book in a lesbian mystery series set in Iowa is inspired by rapes by a University of Iowa men's basketball player.

The author has a good eye for local detail. Donnelly's Bar, soon to be lost to urban renewal, appears along with the Airliner. \"There were old-fashioned hardware and dime stores with wooden floors, bars with billiard tables, diners that served homemade chili, the Epstein Brothers' homey bookstores where you could browse all day without being hassled.\"\n\nWallis, Ruth Sawtell. COLD BED IN THE CLAY. New York: Dodd, Mead, 1947. 212 pp. The author, who was an anthropologist at the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station, 1929-31, at the beginning of her college teaching career, combines elements of more than one college town in this academic mystery set near the end of World War II. \"A State University was holding its annual commencement.... Flat in the middle of the U.S.A., a college campus ought to meet a cornfield. Corn paid taxes and taxes paid for the pomp and circumstance which the student band was demanding for the boys and girls....

New York: Viking, 1986. 368 pp. A Jewish survivor of World War II in Berlin, where he was a teenager protected at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, becomes an anesthesiologist, moving down from McGill to The University of Iowa College of Medicine in 1967.

Another slight anachronism for 1967 is the Cambus. The long day ends with a prayer service at Agudas Achim on Washington Street. The Spanish physician in the author's Joanna Reddinghood appears as a minor character in this novel.\n\nWelt, Elly. JOANNA REDDINGHOOD. New York: Random House, 1980. 314 pp. A publishing party with a flock of English professors and the staff of the Writers' Workshop is a highlight of a medical murder mystery featuring a Spanish anesthesiologist at the University Hospital, University City, who owns three farms and subscribes to Wallaces Farmer.\n\nWeverka, Robert, THE STORY OF BILL. New York: Bantam Books, 1983. 184 pp. Bill Sackter (1913-83) operated the coffee shop in The University of Iowa School of Social Work after his release from mistaken institutionalization in Minnesota for forty-four years. Bill became one of Iowa City's most beloved and celebrated citizens. His life was the subject of two television docudramas. This novel, based on the television scripts, outraged Bill's friends. The author never interviewed anyone who knew Bill and the novel adds nothing about Bill's life not covered in the scripts. The reader will learn little about Iowa City.\n\nWill, Frederic.

Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1990. 162 pp. \"John,\"' a Comparative Literature professor who resembles the author, \"rolled into Iowa City\" to direct the Translation Workshop. \"What a town Iowa City was, with its magical blend of pedant-redneck-poet-hick! Everything was alive....\" John spent \"four years in the gold-domed shadow of the Iowa State Capitol....\n\nWirt, Mildred A. GHOST GABLES. Cleveland: World Publishing Company, 1939. 205 pp. Ghost Gables begins at the boat landing on \"the winding Big Bear river which flowed through the town, dividing the campus of Ardmore college.\" The tomboy heroine of this mystery story for girls rents canoes to students for her father. She helps a new friend, a freshman, turn a mysterious old house into a rooming house for other women students. There is a \"second-hand book store on Clinton street\" in Ardmore.\n\nYates, Richard.

They rent a former artist's studio out in the country. \"Iowa City was a pleasant town, built in the shadow of the university along a slow river. Some of the straight, tree-lined, sun-splashed residential streets reminded Emily of illustrations in The Saturday Evening Post....\"\n\nYoseloff, Martin. WHAT ARE LITTLE GIRLS MADE OF? South Brunswick, N.J.: A.S. Barnes, 1979. 214 pp. A Miss Iowa candidate lives at the Fenmore Women's Dormitory as a senior at Iowa U, soon to marry her steady.
