        "text": "Neil Gaiman is a famous author from the UK who has written many notable books. Some of his works\n\ninclude Coraline, Good Omens, The Graveyard Book, and The Ocean at the End of the Lane. This year, Gaiman will be turning 63 years old.\n\nHis life started in Hampshire, UK, where, as a child, his love for reading bloomed. Ever since he was young, he has had a love for reading. While his parents were working, he’d often be at the local library, reading books by authors he enjoyed. Edgar Allen Poe, C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Ursula K. LeGuin are among these authors. While at the library and immersing himself in various stories, the librarians would help him develop his passion for reading. Gaiman is really grateful to them for allowing his passion to grow in such a good environment.\n\nDuring his early writing years, he was a journalist before beginning to work on other projects. His first book, a Duran Duran biography, took him only three months to write. After that, he wrote Don’t Panic: The Official Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy Companion, a biography of Douglas Adams. His comic book series, Sandman, was a groundbreaking part of his early writing career. It went on to win many US awards and became the first-ever comic to receive a literary award, the 1991 World Fantasy Award for Best Short Story.\n\nWith the many books he’s written, Gaiman has reached a large audience of all ages. Some of his books\n\ntargeted at a younger audience include Blueberry Girl (2009), The Wolves in the Walls (2003), and Coraline (2002). Initially, Coraline was considered to be too scary for children, but it ended up winning several awards anyway, including the British Science Fiction Award. It was also adapted into musical format by Stephen Merritt in 2009. The Graveyard Book (2008) won some awards as well, including the Newbery Medal, which is the highest honor that can be given in US children’s literature.\n\nNot only does Gaiman write for a younger audience, but some of his works are also for adults. Good Omens (with Terry Pratchett, 1990), American Gods (2001), and Smoke and Mirrors (1998) are all some\n\nadult fiction he’s written. Both Good Omens and American Gods even received TV adaptations. Neil Gaiman has written a lot in his writing career, and people of all ages can find enjoyment in the stories he writes. If one is looking for good fantasy books, he’s one of the first authors to choose from with his impressive written collection.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://neilgaiman.com/About_Neil/Biography\n\nImage Source and License:\n\nImage Provider: Ståle Grut / NRKbeta\n\nLicense: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\n\nImage description: Man with dark curly hair, beard and glasses wearing black jacket, black shirt and black pants.\n\nIt’s not hard to find interesting or useful facts when you crack open a book in the library. Let’s see what fun facts Megan found when she browsed through the reference related materials.\n\nSocial media is a pervasive part of modern society. 84% of adults in the age range of 18-29 years use social media and average a daily usage of 2 hours. Social media can influence everything from purchasing behavior to political views, and some of these adults utilize social media as their only source of health information. FROM: Social Media for Public Health: Framework for Social Media–Based Public Health Campaigns, (2022), p. 1, ProQuest.\n\nResearchers are looking into ways to reduce the energy consumption of ceiling fans by at least 20%. By creating innovations in motors and mechanical designs, future ceiling fans may become even more energy efficient and lead to a global reduction carbon dioxide emission. This is important in tropical countries such as India, where over 6% of household energy use is due to electric fans. FROM: Ceiling Fan Drives- Past, Present and Future, (2021), p. 44888-44904, IEEE access: Practical Innovations, Open Solutions.\n\nBlack students with emotional disturbance are perpetually treated worse than their non-black counterparts within the school system. The systematic oppression creates an environment that segregates these students from their peers, and ignores their specific hardships. The authors of this paper cite a drastic need for qualitative studies that investigate the voices of students of all backgrounds with emotional disturbances, and make note that there is an extreme lack of literature that has been published on the experiences of black students in particular. FROM: Lifting the Voices of Black Students Labeled With Emotional Disturbance: Calling All Special Education Researchers, (2023), p. 121-133, EBSCOhost.\n\nApproximately 31% of the Cactaceae family is categorized as threatened at this time, with several species of cacti facing extinction. In Brazil there are 261 species of Cactaceae, many of which are extremely important not only environmentally, but economically as well. Cacti are used for food, decoration, and even medicine. They are often highly sensitive to environmental changes, and diversity is lessening as their habitats are threatened from human population growth and invasive bacteria. FROM: Cacti: Ecology, conservation, uses and significance, (2019), ProQuest Ebook Central.\n\nA study of older adults determined that a single week of senior summer camp can have lasting effects on self-confidence and positive attitudes. The physical activity component of camp allowed the participants to do things they may not have previously thought was possible, and the break from everyday life offered a chance to make new friends and helped lessen boredom. Older adults often suffer from loneliness and their attendance at a senior summer camp helped foster new connections and lessened loneliness. FROM: Older Adults’ Experiences of How Participating in a Senior Summer Camp Has Affected Their Lives – A Phenomenographic Study, (2023), p. 321-338, Taylor & Francis Open Access.\n\nOriginally posted in the Freeman/Lozier Library’s quarterly newsletter, More Than Books, V. 26 No. 4, Fall 2023.\n\nWe have received the following titles in the last quarter.\n\nInterested?

The area is rich in cultural and natural history, offering an abundance of scenic and recreational opportunities. It has been prized as one of southern West Virginia’s more spectacular natural places. The designation of the area is roughly 72,000 acres of land and The National Park and Preserve stretches for 53 miles with over 100 miles of hiking and biking trails in the park. Lawmakers decided during the pandemic to transform this tired industrial area into a national landmark. If you are looking for some time to get out and enjoy nature, you might want to consider visiting The New River Gorge National Park and Preserve in southern West Virginia in the Appalachian Mountains. The New River is among the oldest rivers on the continent and is a popular spot for whitewater rafting and jetboat rides. The New River itself originates in North Carolina and flows north up through Virginia and into West Virginia and Ohio.\n\nOther outdoor activities include ranger led guided activities and programs, scenic overlooks, fishing, camping, kayaking and camping. The steep terrain of the gorge adds to the dramatic scenery of this park and offers shelter to at least 63 species of mammals, including the endangered Virginia big-eared and Indiana bats. This area is essential for supporting endangered mammals, rare birds, amphibians, and plants.\n\nAnother impressive attraction is the New River Gorge Bridge. The bridge is a steel arch bridge 3,030 feet long over the New River Gorge. The bridge has an arch of 1,700 feet and is the 5th longest. An average of 16,200 motor vehicles travel across the bridge each day.\n\nFor more information, please check out the following websites below:\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/neri/index.htm\n\nEvery year Banned Books Week is celebrated in an effort to underscore the importance of reading and maintaining intellectual freedom. Books that are banned, challenged, or censored over the past year include titles that address LGBTQ+ issues, sexuality, abuse, and profanity. It is important that these books continue to be promoted as libraries of all kinds seek to protect the freedom to read. Although some of the topics highlighted in these banned books may be uncomfortable or controversial, reading banned books is a great way to explore diverse perspectives, critically question societal norms, and gain a deeper sense of empathy for others.\n\nThe banning of books is an infringement of intellectual freedom and encroaches on the rights protected by the First Amendment. Books are supposed to be a form of expression and communication for all. Not only do they allow readers to understand the perspectives of others, they serve as a bridge between cultures, nations, and entire ideologies. By removing the right to read certain books, readers are missing out on the access to information that they are owed. Without these banned books many may struggle to find representation of themselves on library shelves.\n\nRead the #1 most challenged book of 2022, “Gender Queer”. This graphic memoir tells the story of Maia Kobabe’s journey of self-discovery and identity. Kobabe’s book has been challenged and censored for “obscene and pornographic materials.” Critics have cited LGBTQ+ indoctrination, grooming, and harm to minors as additional reasons why this book should be banned. This censorship perpetuates a culture of intolerance, ignorance, and discrimination. Not only does this book highlight the importance of acceptance of queer people in a heteronormative world, it takes on the challenges of societal and familial expectations. Gender Queer is an important step forward in the ongoing battle for equality.\n\nThe Library’s Discovery Search aggregates search results from over 100 different databases in different formats, including eBooks, Journals, streaming video, and physical library materials. Since a Library search contains results from so many different sources, sometimes a link may not resolve correctly, or a resource may no longer be available. In these cases, we have added a new feature which allows you to easily report a broken link to Library staff.\n\nIn your Discovery Search results, simply select the “!” icon in the lower right hand of the screen. A dialog box will open that allows you to easily report a broken link. These reports will go directly to our Library staff for further investigation. Once reported, we will either update and fix the link if possible, or remove it from the search index so it can no longer be accessed.\n\nWe are always looking to improve our Discovery Search results, and the best way is through direct feedback from our patrons. We can only fix an issue if we are aware of its existence, so we encourage you to report any broken search results that you may come across."
