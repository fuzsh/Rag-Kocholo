        "text": "THE Jerry Lewis mystique is authentic and well-deserved. He has been a top-flight funny man in nightclubs, on television and in a good many of the 36 films he has made over the last 19 years. But in his 37th effort, \"Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River,\" and the first to be shot in England, the bridge, the river, England and Mr. Lewis somehow do not work properly. The spiritless farce descended yesterday on local theaters.\"Nobody loves a loser,\" our hapless hero concludes early in the aimlessly frenzied proceedings, thereby making the director, his cast and the writer, who adapted his novel to the screen, remarkably prescient. Sadly enough, there's little to adore, or laugh at, in this labored antic about a wacky American wheeler-dealer's attemps to win his rich, estranged, pretty English wife through a harebrained scheme.Mr. Lewis has spent a wad of his wife's money to turn her manorial home into a Chinese restaurant-discoth√®que. But except for some comic, brief moments of weird dialect and mugging to restore domestic order, he clowns mirthlessly with Terry-Thomas, his gap-toothed, grinning co-conspirator, in a confusingly convoluted plot having to do with selling stolen oil-drilling plans to burlesque Arabs.Terry-Thomas is professionally adept but hardly a revelation and Jacqueline Pearce, a comparative newcomer, is decorative as Mr. Lewis's put-upon spouse. And Bernard Cribbins, Patricia Routledge, Nicholas Parsons and other willing Britons lend them athletic but uninspired support. Mr. Lewis and company do not destroy the Lewis mystique but this \"Bridge\" makes it awfully hard to appreciate.\n\nThe CastDON'T RAISE THE BRIDGE, LOWER THE RIVER; screenplay by Max Wilk; based on his novel of the same name; directed by Jerry Paris, produced by Walter Shenson and presented by Columbia Pictures. At neighborhood theaters. Running time: 97 minutes.George Lester . . . . . Jerry LewisH. William Homer . . . . . Terry-ThomasPamela Lester . . . . . Jacqueline PearceFred Davies . . . . .
