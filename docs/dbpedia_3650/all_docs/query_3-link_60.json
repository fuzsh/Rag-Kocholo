        "text": "I COVER THE WATERFRONT\n\nA Collection of Non-Fiction Articles 1980-2008\n\nby Maritime Writer Robert R. Frump,\n\nThese articles are collected from various magazines and books and draw on many happy years at The Philadelphia Inquirer where Gene Roberts and Larry Williams showed me where the waterfront began. I’ve never found the end.\n\nMy hope is that these jottings foster an understanding of our modern maritime world, its contributions, its shortcomings, and its heroes.\n\nThe waterfront “beat” is one often overlooked by today’s news organizations, a fact that made it even more of a rich source of stories, characters and issues for me. The joy of covering the waterfront often was a welcome escape from the pack of media that creates a conventional wisdom and frames issues in a set, pat manner.\n\nIn that sense, I had the same sort of freedom that modern and ancient mariners feel when they set out on a voyage.\n\nThe title is in the present tense because I don’t feel there is an end to this “beat” and I will be engaged with it for the scope of my life. Larry Williams and Bill Eddins contributed world class editing to my writing in many of these articles. Tim Dwyer was an indispensable partner in our articles about the SS Marine Electric.\n\n.\n\nRobert R.

The layman would be right. These were among my most enjoyable assignments – and included some of my best waterfront eats. As any good mariner knows, a good cook makes a good ship and the tugs of the Delaware River had a good reputation as “good feeders.” After the Lefthero incident, on a cold day on the water, I was welcomed back down the rope ladder with a hot bowl of soup – and several shots of very good scotch whiskey for special occasions like tugs saving Philadelphia from certain catastrophe.)\n\nThe Heroic Tugs of the Delaware River\n\nBy Robert R. Frump\n\nInquirer Staff Writer\n\nThe freighter Lefthero drifted powerless in the Schuylkill with the inertia of a glacier directly toward the supports of the busy Girard Point Bridge. On the ship, Capt. Cho Yung Yun stood helplessly by the engine room control.\n\nHe cranked the big control lever once, twice, with no response from the massive engine below. Then Cho moved the lever to and fro, pumping it as if he were desperately throwing a switch to divert a speeding freight train. His eyes grew wide, then riveted directly on tugboat captain and pilot Clark Cain standing beside him.\n\nCain turned to the Korean officer and calmly said, in distinct English: ”Captain – find out what is wrong. Use your phone. Your phone. Call the engine room.” Inside, he recalled later, there was another voice saying over and over, “Oh, God. We’re going to hit the bridge. . . . ”\n\nIt was not a typical day in the life of a Philadelphia tugboat captain.\n\nFor every second of sheer terror on the water, there are days and weeks of mind-numbing routine mingled with interludes of pleasant inaction. But as days and weeks pass on the river, the veteran tugboat man and pilot always holds in a corner of his brain the possibility that disaster may lie just around the bend.\n\nThe simplest docking of ships the length of two football fields requires precision measured in inches. One mistake in jockeying the immense vessels can rip out a pier, squash a tug, or send thigh-thick lines snapping back like whips toward deckhands.\n\nBut this day and this moment of fear on the Lefthero were in a class all their own.\n\nThe Lefthero, a good-size freighter at 60,000 tons, was adrift and gaining momentum, without the ability to change its course, heading straight for the supports of the bridge that carries Interstate 95 traffic over the Schuylkill.\n\nThe situation was not Cain’s fault. The old, rust-covered bulk carrier – Greek-owned, flying a Panamanian flag, crewed by Koreans – was at an age at which most vessels are scrapped.\n\nBut suddenly, it had become Cain’s responsibility. He had scrambled up the side of the Lefthero from the tiny tug the Dorothy McAllister about 10 a.m. Dec. 7 to show the ship captain how to dock, and to direct the harbor tugs below. A reporter seeking to chronicle a day in the life of a tugboat captain had followed him on board.\n\nLife on the river\n\nCain, 55, is a native Philadelphian. Raised at 23d and Morris Streets in South Philadelphia, he now lives in Glenolden. He first went to sea as a youth on a ship carrying horses to France. In 1952 he began work on the tugs to stay closer to home.\n\nAlways, Cain had said, there was at least a little strain in his job. And always, he had said earlier in the day, it was important to remain calm. If the ship‘s captain sees that you are upset, Cain had said before climbing aboard the Lefthero, . . . well, it would be better not to let that happen.\n\nOn the Lefthero, as he saw the bridge looming larger and larger, Captain Cain’s stomach seemed to just fall away toward the floor, he would recall later.\n\nDead ahead, the commuters on the bridge over the Schuylkill were unaware of the Lefthero passing below, just as commuters on the Sunshine Skyway Bridge spanning Tampa Bay in Florida had been oblivious of the passage beneath of the Summit Venture on May 9, 1980.\n\nThat ship rammed the bridge in Florida. Half the double span fell, and 35 men, women and children on that bridge tumbled to their deaths.\n\nThe Lefthero had just turned off the wide Delaware into the narrow channel of the Schuylkill when its engines failed. The wind, always the worst enemy of tugmen, was strong. Empty ships such as the Lefthero ride high on the water, all surface and sail. With no engine and no power for steering, the wind could blow the Lefthero as it would a Styrofoam cup on a pond.\n\nNear-irresistible\n\nNow, the Lefthero was a near-irresistible force, moving in a slack tide at about 5 m.p.h. toward the concrete pillars of the bridge. It had been precisely the wrong time for the old ship to lose its power, and now, at less than a hundred yards from the pillars, it had no way to stop the forward momentum generated by its huge screws.\n\nThere were only a few options, Cain thought: Use the tugs to run the ship aground. Run the risk of another Tampa disaster. Or call in the tugs, threading the ship through the narrow channel beneath the bridge to reach the safe water on the other side and the Tidewater pier.\n\nThe tugs played like porpoises on the water near the freighter. Cute little boats of dark maroon and black – overpowered and undersized, all torque and growl, like Volkswagen “beetles” loaded with truck engines – the tugboats Dorothy, Donal and Eric McAllister spun, backed, throbbed, pivoted, circled, hooted, tooted and turned in the Delaware 70 feet under the ship’s bridge.\n\nIt was up to them to guide the ship to safety.\n\nIn the old days they were powered by steam, and 80 or more of them would\n\nply the Delaware. In the 1920s, the Port Richmond community of Philadelphia would declare a holiday just to see them help one of the big barges dock.\n\nGrain was big, coal was king and the tugs pushed the barges down river and up the coast to New England. Louis Szalejko, a retired captain now, remembered coastal runs where, if conditions were right past Cape May, N.J., a tug crew would unfurl a sail and ride the wind.\n\nCaptains usually ended up owning portions of their tugs outright. And sometimes the captains would form their own companies, as the Taylor and Anderson families did in 1931 to form Taylor & Anderson Towing and Lighterage Co., Philadelphia’s one locally owned survivor in these days of shrinking trade through the ports along the Delaware.\n\nTwo other companies, McAllister Brothers Inc. and Curtis Bay Towing Co., operate harbor tug companies here, but are not locally owned.\n\nA diminished fleet\n\nThe ranks of the harbor tugs – the small, powerful boats that push freighters and tankers to dockside, not the barge pushers and tow boats – have been thinned. Decimated, the old hands would say. Of the 80 boats active in 1948, only 13 or 14 remain.\n\n“Today, there’s nothing,” said Anthony J. Clark, 72, a semi-retired tug captain. He was a dispatcher the day in 1925 that the five-masted schooner Edna Hoyt got towed down river – one of the last commercial sailing ships to trade out of Philadelphia. “It’s a rarity to see action out my window now.”\n\n“The business is dramatically down today,” said George Anderson, 64, a second-generation partner in Taylor & Anderson and the father of a third- generation tugman, Bruce, 30, his son.\n\n“The tonnage of shipping is still there,” George Anderson continued. ”But the ships are larger, and where you used to have three ships yesterday carrying what one does today, now you have one ship for three.”\n\nHardy traditions\n\nThe traditions are still there, though. At the three major, unionized companies, the tugs carry a complement of six: a captain, a mate, an engineer, an oiler, a deckhand and the cook.\n\nThe men who operate the tugs make good money: a captain about $50,000 a year, and crew members can make $30,000. The work is irregular, though, and the hours are often long. Help a ship dock at Delaware City in Delaware, another at the old Sun Ship yard in Chester and one more at the Northern Metals yard north of Philadelphia, and you’ve put in for 18-hour days. And then there may be a week-long wait for another ship.\n\nNor should one look to get a start on tugs these days, either. Anderson’s father was a tugman. So was Tony Clark’s. Cain cannot find work for his sons in the tug business.\n\nOn board the Lefthero, Cain prepared to call in the tugs and thread the freighter through the bridge.\n\n”Uh, hello Eric and Dorothy,” he said into a walkie-talkie cradled to his shoulder as if it were a baby in need of a burp. He looked over at the phone where Captain Cho was desperately pumping the receiver of the engine- room phone. The phone was not working, either.\n\n“We have no motor here. Uh, the captain does not really seem to know what’s wrong,” Cain said, adding, after a pause, “or what he is doing.\n\n“Uh, warn that barge and other traffic in the vicinity that we have a dead motor in the Schuylkill, please.\n\n“Let’s see what we can do here,” Cain said into the radio.\n\nThe freighter’s horn sounded a basso profundo warning. Then, as if on cue, it malfunctioned, too, and began emitting quarter-note blasts. Whhomp, whhomp, whhomp, whhompa, whhomp, whhomp, whhompa came the sound of the horn, like the suspenseful soundtrack of an Alfred Hitchcock movie.\n\nPast panic\n\nCaptain Cho was way past panic at the phone. His right hand fanned the receiver. He alternately banged the phone on the wall and shouted into its mouthpiece. His glistening eyes stared wide, and he locked a slightly hurt look on Captain Cain, who was dressed in a blue, quilted jacket and black pants. A dark blue baseball cap with five stars on the front covered a full head of gray hair.\n\nCain turned to the reporter. His words landed with dull thuds, bitten off with the same cadence as a John Wayne monologue: “Well, you sure picked the day to see what tugboat work is about.”\n\nHe would not look up again for the next 15 minutes, during which took place a graceful water ballet of tugboats directed by a nonstop stream of orders radioed from Cain.\n\nHe spoke quietly into the walkie-talkie, his slightly doughy face creased but implacable, his manner calm, and his stomach, by his estimate, somewhere far below his ankles.\n\nThe tugs moved below, churning up huge torrents of white water behind them, roaring with torque and power. The trick was to break the big ship’s forward motion enough to keep it from hitting the bridge, while turning it into the Schuylkill’s channel.\n\nA walkie-talkie had replaced the whistle Cain still carried on his jacket. But the tugs acknowledged directions by tooting their whistles or blowing their horns. The Dorothy peeped. The Eric bawped.\n\nAs the tug whistles tooted to acknowledge Cain’s orders and the ship’s siren wailed, the river was awash in sound and confusion.\n\nThreading the needle\n\n”Back, Dorothy, one-half full. (Peep, peep, bawp.) One bell, one bell. Eaaassssy, Dorothy, easy. (To Captain Cho) Hard astarboard!\n\n“Bring up, Donald. Fall Dorothy idle. (Bawp, bawp, peep, bawp.) Stop, Dorothy. Back, Dorothy. Easy. . . . Hard right, Eric. Back, Dorothy. Easy, Eric. Midships! Midships!\n\nCain went on as the Dorothy, the Donald and the Eric spun in response to the orders. The ship turned away from the massive bridge supports and more toward the channel.\n\nNow what? Run aground? “That would be better than trapping a tug or brushing the pillars,” Cain recalled thinking.\n\nBut then it looked as if the freighter and its escorts might all make it through the bridge, too.\n\n“Back Dorothy, one-half. Back Dorothy, full. (Peep, peep, bawp.) Easy on the Eric. Easy on the Dorothy. (Peep, peep. Bawp, bawp, bawp. Peep.)”\n\nThe ship turned and pivoted again with the dignity of a glacier as the tugs frantically pushed and pulled, little vectors of force and leverage. The white water that churned up behind them sometimes turned dark, warning that the water was too shallow.\n\nAn extra push here? The Eric put its shoulder to the Dorothy, which already had its shoulder to the big ship, and both engines rrrrrmmmmmm’ed and churned.\n\nBells and sirens\n\nThe world was all bells, sirens, peeps, roars and surges of revving tug engines and the incredible torque, as the tugs fought wind, tide, current and momentum.\n\nThen they were through it. The Girard Point Bridge was above. The Lefthero was square and true in the channel. The tugs tucked in their tails, like high jumpers pulling in their legs, to clear the pillars.\n\nCain signaled all was well when he let out a long breath and looked down at Mate Joe Powers in the window of the Dorothy. They shook their heads together.\n\nWhen Captain Cho came out onto the wing of the bridge, eyes down, Cain turned away for a second, as if not wanting to talk to him.\n\nBut he swung around almost immediately and fluttered his hand over his heart. He smiled wryly and raised his eyebrows, as if to say, “Real close, huh?” Cho, a stocky man in his late 40s whose straight, black hair contained a few strands of gray, seemed grateful for the sympathetic gesture.\n\nFlustered\n\nStill flustered, he fluttered his hand over his heart, too, but then walked quickly away.\n\nMinutes later, as lines were being thrown to the Tidewater terminal, Cho came back, composed, and said to Cain in a formal tone as their eyes met:\n\n“Captain. Thank you. You can see. The air compressor failed. I could do nothing, captain. I am very sorry.”\n\n“Oh, you are very welcome,” Cain said, shaking Cho’s extended hand.\n\nA few minutes later, though, as Cain and the visitor walked through the bridge area, preparing to leave, Cho was standing slumped over on the rail of the bridge, head cradled in his elbow, eyes buried in his arm, silently sobbing.\n\nCain made a sort of “hey, c’mon,” gesture with his shoulders, and then walked over to the Korean. The tug captain put an arm around the shoulders of Cho and then gave him a hug with one big, bearlike arm.\n\n“It’s all right now, huh?” Cain said with a smile. He was thumping the Korean on the back. “These things happen, now. It’s over, huh?”\n\nSHIPS VS. ICE: A RIVER TUG OF WAR\n\nBy Robert R. Frump\n\nInquirer Staff Writer\n\nTugboats leading convoys of ships may save the day on the icy Delaware\n\nRiver.\n\nSteel-hulled and squat in the water, they alone can square off against the\n\nice that now floats in the river and threatens the commerce of New Jersey,\n\nPennsylvania and Delaware.\n\nAlready, the waterfront most Philadelphians know is icebound. The tourist\n\nfleet at Penn’s Landing is frozen. Stalactites hang from the pumps on the\n\ngreat white sides of the old battleship Olympia. An ugly plastic cocoon\n\nprotects the barkentine Gazela Primeiro. The submarine Becuna rocks in the\n\nwind and cracks the ice that rattles and tinkles like shards of glass when\n\nwaves roll into the inner harbor at the foot of Chestnut Street.\n\nBut the Delaware is a meat-and-potatoes river, no pretty tourist harbor. And\n\nto the men and women who work the river, the more beautiful sight in this\n\nweather is the tug Frederick E. Bouchard, a short, red, stubby vessel that\n\nrested alongside Penn’s Landing yesterday with its diesel engines snorting as\n\nthe ice cakes floated by in the main channel.\n\nIn this weather, the Bouchard and tugs like her are the equivalent of\n\nsnowplows. For example, at 7 o’clock this morning, two Coast Guard tugs were\n\nscheduled to lead a convoy of ships through the icebound Chesapeake\n\n& Delaware Canal. Ice two to three inches thick has covered 80 percent of the\n\ncanal, an important shortcut between the Delaware River and the Chesapeake\n\nBay. No ships moved through it yesterday.\n\nBut today, the tugs will rendezvous with ships near Baltimore and then\n\nconvoy them through the ice in the canal, just as the tugs convoyed ships up\n\nthe Delaware River during the cold winter of 1977-78.\n\nIt has to be very cold for that to happen on the Delaware. Normally, the\n\ntides and the current and the maintenance trips of the Coast Guard cutters and\n\ntugs keep the ice broken.\n\nBut the ice has come early this year – three to four weeks earlier than\n\nnormal. Already one ship has had to turn back because of it.\n\nYesterday, ice clogged the cooling intakes of the Chemical Venturer, a 170-\n\nfoot, 17,000-gross-ton chemical ship bound for Unitank’s Pier 179,\n\naccording to Jack Branson of TTT Shipping Agency. Its engines heated up, and\n\nthe Chemical Venturer was forced to return to an anchorage at Breakwater\n\nHarbor near Lewes, Del. The tugs were on their way yesterday to escort the\n\nship to dockside.\n\nThey will clear the way through two-inch ice that covered 85 percent of the\n\nriver at the Walt Whitman Bridge. The Coast Guard at Gloucester City, N.J., is\n\nconcerned enough that its officers now are dispensing tugs and buoy tenders\n\nlike chess pieces in a close game. The tug Catenary has been sent down to the\n\nbay. A request is in for the Coast Guard to send a 110-foot tug down from New\n\nYork.\n\nIn the meantime, Chief Petty Officer Arthur G. Grist and his crew cruise\n\nrelentlessly on the 65-foot tug Cleat through ice from Riverton, N.J., to the\n\nWalt Whitman Bridge, to the Sun Co. docks at the Delaware state line. They\n\nwork from 8 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. Icebreaking after dark is too dangerous.\n\nThe big ships could not find their way in 1978 because the channel buoys\n\nwere lost to the ice. Then, too, river pilot launches could not negotiate the\n\nthick ice at Lewes and had to be landed by helicopter. Only the convoys led\n\nby tugs carried the day.\n\nThis year, the cold has slowed coal- loading operations as well. Coal\n\ndumped in train cars after being washed down freezes in a solid block. William\n\nBurns, the head of loading operations at Pier 124, runs the cars through\n\nheating sheds before trying to dump them into ships.\n\n” But very little warms six to eight feet of solid coal and ice in this\n\nweather,” he said.\n\nThe answer largely has been muscle power, picks and time. Burns and his\n\ncrews have been loading 420 railroad cars into a ship for the last four days;\n\nit may take them another three. It normally takes three days, period.\n\nAnd if it freezes harder around the pier, Burns also will have to turn to\n\nthe winter workhorse on the river. He, too, will have to use tugs to get the\n\nship out.\n\nPart Two: At Sea\n\n(After years of political and investigative coverage, I yearned for “real world” coverage where not all subjects were abstract, where objects moved and touched the earth and the sea. Nothing like an oil tanker to provide that for you. This story was Gene Roberts’ baby. The Delaware River is a great oil port. He wanted to show how the oil got there. I was all in favor of a sea cruise – thought I had not quite expected the one I got.)\n\nBRINGING THE MEDITERRANEAN SUN TO MARCUS HOOK\n\nBY ROBERT R. FRUMP\n\n(Inquirer Sunday Magazine, Circa 1981)\n\nBeginning the night before, continuing all through the day, and then for much\n\nof this night, the big tanker had sucked crude oil through pipes that looked\n\nlike three long straws attached to the pier at La Sakhirra, Tunisia. The\n\nstraws in turn were attached to a pipeline that arched back along a gray\n\ncauseway toward the sand-brown land with its scrubby sandalwood and olive\n\ntrees, and then west toward the oilfields of Algeria, where it had come up\n\nout of the ground.\n\nNow, bloated like a fat black tick, her weight slung like lead below her\n\nwaist at the waterline, the tanker, named the Mediterranean Sun and owned by\n\nSun Transport of Aston, Pa., routinely prepared to cast off in the black\n\nNorth African night and start her journey from this land of dates and almonds\n\nto the land of cheese steaks and hoagies. Her next stop would be the Sun Co.\n\nrefinery at Marcus Hook, Pa.\n\nA whole section of the landscape was about to move. Scowling Domenica\n\nFragala, half Arab and half Sicilian, wrestled to release the ropes half again\n\nas thick as his thigh that had held the ship’s stern to the long pier jutting\n\nout into the Gulf of Gabes. Six stories up, Captain Antonio Mancini wound\n\nhimself tight as a clenched fist as he watched the stern of the ship swing out\n\nfrom the pier. There was no hint of the small crisis to come in the dime’s\n\nworth of green wire under the control panel on the bridge where he paced. The\n\nangle between pier and ship seemed right. Everything seemed to be going\n\nroutinely.\n\nAt 5 feet 5 inches and 125 pounds, Mancini was the smallest man on the\n\nbridge, but his manner and the flashing cobalt-blue eyes beneath arched\n\neyebrows left no question as to who was in command. A tennis sweater hung\n\njauntily over his shoulders, and a long, thin, brown cigarette stuck in his\n\nfist. Soon he would order the lines that held the bow of the tanker released,\n\nso that it would swing out from the pier, and then, at just the right moment,\n\nhe personally would turn the huge, turbocharged engine to full power, using a\n\ndevice near the wheel that looks like an oversized automatic floor shift on an\n\nexpensive American car. The device buzzed sharply whenever speed changes were\n\nmade. But its resemblance to the old ” telegraph,” which rang bells in the\n\nengine room to increase power, ended there. This lever controlled the engine\n\nfrom the bridge. Advancing it was like pressing an accelerator. Sliding it\n\nall the way to ” Full Ahead” would bring the engine throbbing to full power.\n\nThat surge of power was crucial to the maneuver. The huge propeller would\n\nbite into the dark sea, frothing it white and driving the great ship, almost\n\nthree football fields long, forward in a graceful arc, pivoting her bow away\n\nfrom the pier and sending her out toward the deep ship channels of the\n\nMediterranean with all the grace of a fat figure skater.\n\nThe moment arrived. Mancini stepped decisively to the engine control and\n\nslid it forward through ” Dead Slow,” ” Slow” and ” Half” to the ultimate\n\nposition: ” Full Ahead.” He waited for the surge. It didn’t come.\n\nDirectly beneath him the small green wire had popped loose inside the\n\nengine- control mechanism. It dangled a fraction of an inch from the sliver\n\nof solder that had held it in place.\n\nBut this was not apparent then. What was apparent was that there was trouble\n\n– that the Mediterranean Sun, loaded with 97,000 tons of crude oil, was\n\nadrift.\n\nHer weight at that moment was equal to 50,000 automobiles, many more than\n\nthe number parked at Veterans Stadium for a football game. The ship, at least\n\nin relation to everything near her at La Sakhirra, had become something of an\n\nirresistible force. At only 0.2 knot, she could crush anything in the slow,\n\ncreeping, relentless manner of an advancing glacier. The modern pier of\n\nreinforced concrete and steel could be crumpled like a mockup of aluminum\n\nfoil and toothpicks if the tanker drifted back against it. That would cost\n\nmoney.\n\nThe ship’s hull itself, in the event of such a collision, could be breached.\n\nOil vapors and oxygen could mix, inviting the ball-of-fire explosions for\n\nwhich tankers are famous. That would cost lives. (More than 400 persons have\n\ndied in such tanker explosions since 1968.)\n\nNow the stern continued to sweep outward, at a bigger and bigger angle. And\n\nthe bow of the ship was turning, too, lazily but surely, through an arc that\n\nwould take it right through the pier if something was not done.\n\nFar below the bridge, in the main control room of the ship, Chief Engineer\n\nLuigi Germelli sat in a light blue jumpsuit behind a glass wall overlooking\n\nthe clattering, gargantuan eight-cylinder engine. He was the oldest officer\n\non the ship, but he wore no paunch to show his 50-plus years, and he had no\n\nmacho-man bearing to prove he was the engineer. Germelli has the manner of a\n\nkind surgeon, or a gentle priest. In fact, he is a gentleman in the old\n\nItalian tradition, a bachelor with a villa in Florence once owned by a Medici\n\nprince, a yacht near Portofino, vineyards, a taste for opera and fine food and\n\na love of plants.\n\nPerched behind the glass wall overlooking the pea-green engine the size of a\n\ntwo- story house, he resembled an attentive concert-goer, craning his neck\n\nslightly, tilting his head one way, then the other.\n\nGermelli knew that the symphony was being played wrong. He cocked his head,\n\nand a look of concern played over his scrubbed-clean face, as if a bassoon had\n\nhit a flatulent note. The engine, he knew, should be throbbing now, not\n\nidling. Quickly he snapped up his phone to the bridge and began to say\n\nsomething to his old friend Mancini, but the captain spoke first. Overriding\n\nthe ship’s computerized navigation and control systems, which were blinking\n\nand buzzing their ineffectuality, Mancini had reached across the non-operating\n\nengine control to snatch the rubber-armored engine-room phone and bellow an\n\norder. ” Give me the power ,” he shouted.\n\nGermelli, still exuding calm, pushed on a metal lever that feeds the fuel\n\nmanually to the engine. A tremor touched the ship. In seconds the engine was\n\nthrobbing to full power. Pistons that could not be circled by five people\n\nholding hands chugged up and down with maximum force. Fuel valves the girth of\n\na fat man jiggled and shook. Up top, the surge was more subdued. It was as if\n\nan elevator had bumped lightly into motion as the prop dug in.\n\nAt the stern, the water boiled. The bow’s movement toward the pier slowed,\n\nchecked and stopped. The bow swung away from the pier and out toward deep\n\nwater.\n\n” You see, it is a silly little thing, heh?” said Mancini later. He was\n\nkneeling on the floor where the panel beneath the control lever had been\n\nremoved to reveal the electronic guts of the bridge. A fresh glob of solder\n\nnow held the green wire in its place. Mancini pointed to it and a dozen other\n\nconnections.\n\n” It is a silly little thing, yes, one silly little thing that can make this\n\ngo ‘BARROOM!,’ heh? Unless you have the situation always in hand!”\n\n” Ahh,” he said, now bubbling with good humor. ” This is why Sun Oil sends\n\nits masters to expensive schools. This is why they pay them so much. Hah! But\n\nthey do not pay for my big liver, hey? For the stress?”\n\nCalm returned. A few minutes later a falling star streaked from the skies\n\nacross the bow, and after a little more than an hour a huge, half-crescent\n\nmoon rose, framing the bow of the ship and pointing the way through water so\n\ncalm and beautiful that it seemed to be frozen black lava etched in silver.\n\nThe delicate shore scents of sandalwood and olive were joined now by the\n\nricher aroma of strong espresso coffee.\n\nOn the control panel, the radar screens swept an amber terrain. The ” Data\n\nSail” system had been turned on. Course-setting instructions had been fed into\n\nthe system’s computer on punched tape, and the computer had taken on the job\n\nof analyzing the movements of the ship and the data gathered by the radar\n\nunits as they scanned the night, reporting what they found on the two amber\n\nscreens. The control panel, with its dozens of lighted dials and buttons,\n\nblinked, buzzed and glowed comfortingly. The Mediterranean Sun was on her way.\n\nTankers are the capital ships of our times, the Yankee Clippers, the\n\nlifeline of a Western world whose economic life depends on massive\n\ntransfusions of foreign oil. They form great energy convoys bringing the black\n\nblood that gives us economic life from the Mideast and the North African\n\nshores. Always these ships are out there, in the Mediterranean, in the\n\nAtlantic, on the Delaware River. We take much notice of them only when these\n\nspecial ships have their special, spectacular problems. We were aware of what\n\ncan happen to tankers, for instance, in the early hours of Jan. 31, 1975, the\n\nmorning the Corinthos went up.\n\nOrange and yellow flames boiled up from the Corinthos, tied up at Marcus\n\nHook, until they were lost in the clouds. Tiny fireboats darted in and out of\n\nthe billowing smoke, whistles shrieking like parent birds trying to save\n\ntheir young. But there was no one to save. Twenty-six men and women, including\n\nthe captain of the Corinthos and most of his family, were killed in that\n\ndisaster, caused by a collision that was, in part, the result of a\n\nmalfunction by a five-inch valve.\n\nNor was that an isolated instance. The tanker trade is a dangerous trade,\n\nand 1979 and 1980 were particularly bad years for tanker losses. Twenty-seven\n\ntankers – including five big supertankers – were lost in 1979 alone.\n\nInterestingly, there is more peril of fire on an empty tanker than a full one.\n\nWhen a tanker is loaded to the brim, there is little danger of explosion. But\n\nwhen the tanks are empty or just part full, there is a constant danger of the\n\noil fumes combining with oxygen until the mix is just right. Or just wrong.\n\nToday, many tankers have an ” inert gas” system that is supposed to prevent\n\nsuch explosions by pumping oxygenless gas into the holds. (It is a process Sun\n\nOil first employed in the 1930s.) But roughly two-thirds of all tankers at\n\nsea do not have such a system, and even for those ships that do, the system is\n\nfar from foolproof. A half-dozen of the tankers that blew up in 1979 were\n\nequipped with the new gas systems.\n\nThe recollection of these and other recent losses had caused the waxen skin\n\naround John Oliver’s eyes to crinkle in distaste during an interview that took\n\nplace in the company tearoom of Lloyd’s of London a few days before the\n\nMediterranean Sun sailed from La Sakhirra. Oliver, an elderly, dignified\n\n” lead broker” in the international maritime insurance field, noted that as a\n\nresult of that ” spate” of losses, ” we had to screw the rates a bit more.\n\nInert gas systems are not simple to operate. There are crews who do not know\n\nwhat they are doing.”\n\nBut the Mediterranean Sun crew does know what it’s doing. So skilled is\n\nFrancesco Russo, the handsome, 29-year-old first mate of the ship, that Sun\n\nTransport would like to have him train other crews. In port, he studies\n\ngauges, pipelines and pressure needles, employing just the right blend of\n\nexperience and calculation to keep the tanks ” inerted” properly.\n\nYes, the crew of the Mediterranean Sun takes pride in handling or preventing\n\nthe conventional tanker problems. Such problems can be seen. They are\n\ncomfortable and, almost always, ultimately solvable. One later realizes that\n\nthere was something akin to enjoyment in the reaction to Captain Mancini’s\n\nhandling of the problem created by the malfunctioning engine control. Ah, if\n\nonly things were always so challenging and exciting, this melancholy that\n\ncreeps over tanker men might burn away like sea haze under a hot sun.\n\nIt is not that their life is bleak. Sun Transport, Inc., the Sun Oil\n\nsubsidiary that owns the tanker, does things right. There are staterooms,\n\ngourmet meals, movies and even a swimming pool. But these and other touches\n\nare an incomplete defense against a problem that is a central fact of life for\n\nthe men aboard the Mediterranean Sun and hundreds of other tankers.\n\nTanker crews are isolated in a manner that sailors in modern times only\n\nrecently have begun to experience. As always, of course, they are isolated\n\nfrom the land during the period of the voyage. What is more, the technology\n\nnecessary to operate these huge new ships increasingly isolates them from the\n\nsea as well.\n\nBut all of this becomes more understandable as we continue with the\n\nMediteranean Sun, sluicing through the Gulf of Gabes south through the starlit\n\nnight toward the point at which it can loop around and head up into the\n\nMediterranean Sea.\n\nThe ship slipped easily through the oil rigs scattered through the gulf.\n\nTheir positions are fixed. Radar spots them easily. Captain Mancini was more\n\nworried about the dozens of tiny blips on the amber radar screens\n\nrepresenting the tiny Tunisian shrimp boats. Often, these boats run without\n\nlights and drift into the channels. The tanker’s bulbous snout could wreck\n\nseveral of the small wooden vessels without rattling the china tucked in the\n\ngalley 800 feet from the prow.\n\nThe officers kept a lookout for shrimpers atop the bridge. This control room\n\nand lookout room is stacked on the six-deck- high superstructure that rises\n\nlike a pre- fab motel from the rear eighth of the ship. A complex of cabins,\n\nlounges and game rooms is contained in that motel. Winged balconies flare out\n\nfrom each side of the bridge to provide vantage points overlooking the ship’s\n\nsides.\n\nThe dominant color scheme was utilitarian green and gray, and there was very\n\nlittle that seemed nautical in the usual sense. There was very little shined\n\nbrass. The ” wheel” in the center of the floor was an unprepossessing\n\ncircular piece of metal that a landlubber could mistake for a valve control.\n\nAt night the bridge was pitch black, permitting good vision through the\n\nwindows.\n\nClear of the shrimpers, the ship left the gulf and turned in a wide arc to\n\nthe north, pointing directly at the homeland of the 29 men on board, all of\n\nwhom are Italian. As it happens, most of the crewmen are from Sicily. The\n\nofficers, for the most part, are from Genoa. Sun Transport thinks that the\n\nstrong Italian tradition of skilled seamanship, combined with a relatively low\n\nwage pattern, makes an Italian crew the optimum buy. Other oil companies look\n\nfor more complex combinations, hiring, say, Norwegian or British officers,\n\nGerman engineers, a Hong Kong cook and Haitian, Taiwanese and Tunisian deck\n\nhands.\n\nThe wages can be cheap in such a mix, but the communication and morale are\n\noften poor. Jeff Lappin, an American expert in tanker unloading who boards\n\nmany tankers, put it this way, ” When you see a crew like that, a lot of the\n\ntime every one of them is wearing a sheath knife. You know you don’t have a\n\ngood atmosphere.”\n\nOn the Mediterranean Sun, everyone is Italian. No one wears knives. Messmen\n\nare the lowest-paid men on board, and they make $1,200 a month, a good wage\n\nanywhere and a great one in Italy. Captain Mancini makes more than $30,000 a\n\nyear. He and the other ship captains are among the most respected of\n\nprofessionals in their country.\n\nThe history of the Mediterranean Sun, though, is truly a multinational story\n\nof the forces of supply and demand operating on a worldwide scale. It was a\n\nNorwegian company that ordered the ship in the first place, and it did the\n\njob right. The Mediterranean Sun carried a price tag of $31 million, just\n\nseven million dollars less than the cost of one of the big supertankers twice\n\nits size.\n\nIt was built to weather any storm, but not the freakish economic winds\n\nblowing in 1974, the year it was launched. The Arab oil embargo in that year\n\nled to a reduction in oil consumption, and this reduced the need for tankers.\n\nThus Sun Oil got the buy of its life. It paid the Norwegian company $12\n\nmillion for the $31 million ship.\n\nThe American company registered the tanker under the Liberian flag, which\n\nflies over some of the worst tankers in the world, and also over some of the\n\nbest. U.S.-registered ships must hire American crews, who get up to three and\n\nfour times the salaries of an average crew on the world market. The Liberian\n\nflag gave Sun a license to hunt the crews, and the hunt stopped in Italy.\n\nIn the morning the radio picked up Italian newscasts that said the weather\n\nin northern Italy was uncommonly cold for May, but there was little\n\nconversation among the ship’s officers about their home. The mountains and\n\ndeserts of the North African coast were clearly visible off the port side,\n\nonly 30 miles away. Fine sand from the Sahara, blown out over the sea on\n\nsilken winds, coated the deck of the Mediterranean Sun.\n\nThe crew was out on the deck chipping and painting amid a forest of pipes\n\nand valves. The sea parted on each side of the tanker’s prow in surf-like\n\nlight blue waves and played out behind as 100 yards of turbulent white wake.\n\nSmaller ships bucked in the waves, but aboard the tanker it was like being on\n\nan immense, solidly rooted steel island in the middle of a river whose rapid\n\ncurrent was slicing to either side.\n\nAl parts of the vessel hummed slightly from the huge engine, which sounded\n\nlike a distant jet. It was a deceptively calming sound. ” Vibration is the\n\nenemy of all things,” Germelli says. In particular, vibration is the enemy of\n\nthe thousands of little green wires that can pop loose at the wrong time.\n\nAnd in these waters, the present would be the wrong time. The Mediterranean\n\nSea is an energy highway. Informal convoys are formed – tankers and liquid\n\nnatural gas carriers called LNGs – heading for the U.S. or ports in France,\n\nEngland or Holland. The Med Sun plowed westward in the midst of the traffic.\n\nTwo tankers cruised three miles off her starboard. A tanker and an LNG carrier\n\nparalleled her to port.\n\nThe officers, who work two four-hour shifts each 24 hours, paced the bridge\n\ndeck, Zeiss and Nikon binoculars in hand. The Med Sun’s twirling radar\n\nantennas tracked the other ships on screens that resemble sophisticated\n\nversions of electronic games. The officers can electronically circle the\n\nlittle blips on the screen and push a button, and the computer will plot the\n\nspeed and direction of the nearby ship. Another read-out shows the Med Sun’s\n\nspeed. Yet another provides the estimated time to Gibraltar. There is a\n\nsensitive ” collision course” button with ” audio alarm” that sounds whenever\n\nthe computer senses the slightest chance of ships’ paths crossing – and the\n\n” beep . . . beep . . . beep” of the alarm sounds frequently.\n\nBut there are some holes in the electronic armor. While tankers show up on\n\nradar, wooden or fiberglass sailing boats sometimes do not. ” They say we\n\nsleep and the computer runs the ships at night,” said one of the ship’s\n\nofficers one morning at 3. He had just spotted a small vessel invisible to the\n\nradar. His manner was that of a wide receiver who had caught an impossible\n\npass and was spiking the ball triumphantly in the end zone. ” Tanker officers\n\ndo not sleep. We watch, hey? For fools. Like this one.”\n\nThe next day a whale passed, sounding and rolling in the sea. Graceful sea-\n\ngoing yachts humped up and down over the small waves. The crewmen smiled at\n\nthe whale, and they waved at the sailboats. In many ways they were glad for\n\nthe company. But even before the ship drew even with the wild coastal mountain\n\nranges of Algeria, the crew and officers activated their own informal systems\n\nto deal with the deadly boredom that would settle in quickly once they were\n\nout on the Atlantic.\n\nAt the officers mess there was a perpetual comedy show, involving the Med\n\nSun’s two senior officers, Captain Mancini and Chief Engineer Germelli. One\n\nlunchtime, after the dishes for the pasta, soup and salad had been cleared\n\nand while the waiters were serving veal in a cream sauce (which was followed\n\nby red snapper), Captain Mancini looked over at Germelli and began, in a tone\n\nof deep seriousness, a discusssion of the heraldic crests of their respective\n\nfamilies. He guided the discussion around until he had established the fact\n\nthat his crest contained three spherical ornaments, while Germelli’s had none.\n\nThis, the captain happily declared, proved a point he had long believed to be\n\ntrue but for which until now he had lacked proof.\n\n” Aha,” the captain exulted, ” the man admits it himself. His family has no\n\nballs!”\n\n” Oh no!” Germelli said. ” I think I have been tricked.” (Without knowing\n\nit, he mimicked the ” Mr. Bill” voice.) ” I cannot trust you.”\n\nBut it happens again and again. Always, Germelli is the straight man,\n\nMancini the Pan-like corrupter of the innocent. Always, there is a ribald\n\npatter of jokes, double entendres and sexual innuendoes. ” Mr. Germelli is my\n\nhobby,” Mancini explained with a warm smile one day. ” I think of ways to\n\ncause him trouble. It is all a game.”\n\nEveryone has a way to beat the boredom. Many of the crew members play\n\nhyperactive Ping Pong, with skilled smashes, lunges and parries. They retrieve\n\nloose balls with soccer kicks and head butts.\n\nThe videotape cassettes of movies get heavy use on the play-back equipment\n\nin both the crew and the officer lounges. Most are English, dubbed in Italian.\n\nIl Padrino – Parte Prima is popular, though Marlon Brando’s lips are slightly\n\nout of sync in this version of The Godfather – Part One, and everyone has\n\nseen at least three times Rosa Pantera ( Pink Panther ) and Grazioza Bebe\n\n( Pretty Baby ).\n\nThe four-course meals often feature champagne and cognac, cappuccino and\n\nespresso. Last Christmas, the crew dined on eggs with caviar stuffing,\n\nprosciutto antipasto, shrimp cocktail, cannelloni, shrimps butterflied with a\n\ncream sauce, fried shrimps American style, filet mignon, salad with very thin\n\nslices of eggs and ham, pannefone (a cake), cream puffs, fruit and\n\nchampagne.\n\nThe cabins – officers’ quarters – are little hotel suites with finely\n\njointed Scandinavian wood dressers, bedsteads and tables. The living room\n\ncontains a desk, rug, couch and table. The sleeping room has a comfortable\n\nrecessed bed. There is a separate bathroom with shower. Each member of the\n\ncrew has his own room with bath.\n\nThe furniture in the crewmen’s rooms is identical, but the decor offers a\n\nchance to express individual tastes. Some desks are topped with pictures of\n\nvillage saints. Others have pin-up posters from Penthouse on the walls. The\n\nmore rounded men have pictures of saints and nude posters.\n\nThere could be real women on board soon. The Norwegians regularly carry\n\nwomen officers now, and a few women are enrolled in the Italian maritime\n\nschools. Also, under a new contract affecting the Mediterranean Sun, seamen\n\nand officers with three years of seniority can bring their wives on board.\n\nSecond Mate Antonio Stillittano and First Mate Russo agree that they would do\n\nthat – if they were married, and if the wife of either would not be the lone\n\nwoman on board.\n\nThere are some moments when the automated systems that have appropriated\n\nmuch of the excitement and responsibility of life at sea do a turnabout and\n\nadd a bit of extra excitement. The highly sensitive fire alarm is frequently\n\ntriggered, and the alarms are almost always false, but too many tankers have\n\ngone up in flames and fireballs for anyone to take the false alarms casually.\n\nAt one point during this voyage the alarm sounded in the middle of a\n\nspirited post-lunch card game. ” Stay!” said a player.” No!” said another, his\n\nchair sliding back. ” Play!” said the first player. But his friend had\n\nalready slapped down his cards and was running for it. The second player\n\nfollowed.\n\nDomenico Fragala, the tough Arab-Sicilian deckhand, laughed scornfully and a\n\ncontemptuous grin spread across his face as his colleagues raced from the game\n\nroom for lifejackets, hard hats and lifeboat stations. Fragala reached across\n\nthe cards to an abandoned glass of Remy Martin Very Special Old Pale cognac.\n\nHe tossed it down, turned his stubbled face skyward and laughed.\n\nThen the alarm sounded again. Fragala did a cartoon-like double-take and\n\nscurried after his colleagues, discarding bravado for an orange life vest.\n\nThe men on the tankers do have some fears besides fire. They talk, too, of\n\nthe unpredictable phenomenon along the South African coast called freak waves.\n\nThe waves, appearing out of calm seas, can be as high as 45 feet. For them to\n\nform, currents and gale-driven winds must align themselves. One wave is\n\nsuperimposed on another so that two become one towering monster preceded by a\n\nformidable trough.\n\nMancini encountered one years ago when he was commanding a smaller tanker.\n\n” Mein Gott, you see this mountain of water coming, 10 miles off. A wall of\n\nwater. A monster,” says Mancini, who learned German and English at the same\n\ntime in school and frequently intermixes them. ” You must be very careful that\n\nyou hit it straight on. Then . . . ahhhh . . . hold on . . . Mein Gott,\n\nit was terrible . . . like skiing . . . surfing . . . you must be\n\ncareful to keep the ship straight coming down the other side. If the wave\n\nturns to white water on the top, then you are in trouble. It breaks\n\n. . . shhhhhaaa aaaccckkk . . . tons of water on top of you . . . you\n\nare finished. It destroys all.”\n\nFew sailors are apt to encounter the huge waves, but conventional storms\n\nalso are capable of creating killer waves that threaten even the largest of\n\nships. Antonio Stillittano told of his days aboard the Atlantic Sun, Sun\n\nTransport’s one and only supertanker, when a squall blew up off the West\n\nAfrican Coast.\n\nTwo waves joined together to form one big wave that lifted the bow of the\n\nAtlantic Sun up as an Atlantic City roller might lift up your air mattress.\n\nThe supertanker had no problem handling that, but as her bow descended into\n\nthe oncoming trough, a third wave slapped over her deck. ” We look,\n\n” Stillitanto recalled. ” We see the wave cover the pipelines and the derrick.\n\nIt goes. We look and say, ‘Where is the derrick?’ Gone. It broke over.”\n\nA short while later a helicopter buzzed the Atlantic Sun and told her by\n\nradio that a relatively tiny, 10,000-ton Singapore freighter had broken up in\n\nthe storm, and the copter signaled the supertanker to follow and aid in\n\nrescuing survivors. Excitement grew, and in the distance the officers spotted\n\nwhat appeared to be a covered lifeboat. As they approached, the crew was on\n\nthe verge of cheering. But the lifeboat was not covered. It was upside down.\n\nThere was no one in it.\n\n” It was not such a good time,” said Stillittano with moist, melancholy\n\neyes. ” We think we are going to save them. It was not so good and makes us\n\nall very sad.”\n\nThe passage through the Strait of Gibraltar went routinely. The famous rock\n\nwas only an ominous black presence in the pre-dawn darkness. Amber blips of a\n\ndozen ships filled the radar screen as all the officers clustered on the\n\nbridge to help in crossing this heavily trafficked area. ” Sometimes it is\n\njust like walking on Broadway,” Mancini said. ” ‘Excuse me. Can I get by?\n\nPardon me? Excuse me?’ We are very lucky tonight; it is a joke tonight.”\n\nThe crossing fell on Luigi Massagli’s midnight-to-4 watch. (Massagli is a\n\nsecond mate, like Antonio Stillittano; the Med Sun had two second mates on\n\nthis voyage because Stillittano was replacing Massagli and there was an\n\noverlap of tours of duty.) The 32-year-old Massagli remained deadly serious\n\neven after the dry and slightly bored British voice from Lloyd’s Gibraltar\n\nreporting station, which lists all passing ships, said, ” Thank you very\n\nmuch, Mediterranean Sun. We wish you a safe passage to Philadelphia. Bye-bye\n\nand good morning.”\n\nBut when his command of the bridge had ended, Massagli went to the wing\n\ndeck, eyes alight with a mock manic look, and started doing a Charleston to\n\nhis own off-key rendition of Chicago . ” Shee-ka-go, Illinois. Yes?” he\n\nsaid, his eyes wide. ” You are Mafioso, yes? American? Kissinger? Allende?\n\nChile? Yes? John Wayne? Ahhh! Fascisto! Fascisto!”\n\nHe was the only one of the officers who had been on the ship five months.\n\nFive solid months. He would be getting off in Marcus Hook and flying back to\n\nhis apartment near Portofino, to his Alfa Romeo, and to his girlfriend. But\n\nnow, so very close to the end, the other officers explained, he needed the\n\nbroad humor of feigned madness to shore up his defenses.\n\nLike many of the officers, messmen and engineers, Massagli had once served\n\non a passenger ship. Their faces light up when such duty is mentioned. There\n\nis a little society there. Frequent ports of call. And in the Caribbean a\n\nconstant parade of American women who do not quite know what hit them when forthe first time they meet the dark-complexioned Italian officers in their\n\nstarched white uniforms with the gold braid.\n\n” Yes, yes, Madam, you have a problem?” Massagli was demonstrating his suave\n\npassenger-ship manner. He looked like a debonair Al Pacino with a slice of\n\nMarcello Mastroianni thrown in. ” I see. Oh? The problem is in your cabin.\n\nYes. Yes. The bed in your cabin is broken. Perhaps I can help fix it. I will\n\ncome to your cabin now.”\n\nBut the women and the glory of liner duty are hard to come by. Luigi\n\nMassagli was a tankerman this trip, and he did not like it. ” I want to go ho-\n\no-o-o- mmmmmme,” he howled plaintively at the moon and the stars above\n\nGibraltar. ” I want to go ho-o*o-o-mmmmmmme.”\n\nThe others did not yell it, but they thought it, especially past Gibraltar,\n\nwhere there is nothing but water and sky and where Germelli’s hanging spider\n\nplants began to sway lazily, regularly, back and forth in the paneled bar of\n\nthe officers lounge. The big rollers of the Atlantic move the ship now. You\n\nhear the sad sounds of the night waves as they slough and heave in sighs. The\n\nlines of the lifeboats flap, click and chime, and during the lonely nights\n\nthere IS an unmistakable feeling of doing time.\n\nThe young officers went to sea for varying reasons – for the money, for the\n\nromance, to uphold the maritime traditions of their families and of Genoa.\n\n” From the beginning,” Russo said, shrugging, when asked when he knew he\n\nwould go to sea. ” It is tradition. My grandfather was captain of a sailing\n\nship.”\n\nMassagli, too, was captured by the romance of it all. ” A bambino, yes?\n\nI was a child. I see the big ships come in. Ahhhhhh,” he sighed, looking up with\n\nhis mouth and eyes wide open. His imaginary first ship loomed in front of\n\nhim. ” I see the uniforms. Ahhhhhh. The officers. Ahhhhhh.\n\n” I think it is wonderful. Bambino! Hey? Fool! Fool! See the world, hey?\n\nSail on the ships and see the world, hey? America, hey? ” Marcus Hook is America. See America. See Tunisia. La Sakhirra is Tunisia.\n\nSee Tunisia. Hah! Twenty hours in Marcus Hook.\n\n” The Coast Guard comes,” Massagli said. He clasped his hands as if in\n\nprayer and bowed slightly in mock politeness. ” We must be on board. The cargo\n\nis discharged hands clasped and a bow . We must be on board.\n\n” There is no time! There is just the pier! Twenty hours! Then back!\n\nTunisia. La Sakhirra. Twenty hours. The pier. Then back. Marcus Hook. The\n\npier. I do not see Tunisia. I do not see America. I see . . . this . .\n\n. pier! I do not see America. I see . . . this . . . ship!\n\n” For the modern sailor, this is not 198l,” he said. ” It is nineteen zero\n\nzero.”\n\nMassagli was an angry young man. First Mate Russo was the quiet one. A\n\nshrug. A slightly sour look. Pursed lips. The trace of a grimace, and a\n\nwrinkling of the brow. That is how Russo communicated displeasure. Massagli\n\nwas loved for his antics and acting. Russo was respected by the officers on\n\nboard and admired by the crew, who called after him, ” Hey, Roose!” They will\n\ntell you with pride how Roose once ran 22 laps around the deck – 13\n\nkilometers.\n\nHe no longer runs. He has a new way of fighting the loneliness, and he cut a\n\nbizarrely noble figure as he walked up the deck of the Med Sun at 7 in the\n\nmorning, his double-breasted khaki Italian navy officer’s shirt loose and\n\nflapping in the wind, a single arrow clutched in his right hand, a Ben Pearson\n\n40-pound bow over his shoulder.\n\nHe levered loose the clamps of a hatchway at the front of the ship and\n\ndescended into a cavernous steel vault known as the boatswain stores. The\n\nwaves of the Atlantic crashed into the ship at irregular lazy intervals,\n\nrumbling the hull as if it were so many yards of sheetmetal shaken at arm’s\n\nlength. This is the secret place of Roose. The other men know about it, but\n\nthey do not trespass.\n\nDangling in the center of the cavern, strung from two ropes, was a\n\nbull’s-eye tacked on a mattress folded double. Russo walked to the end of the\n\nroom opposite the target. ” I will show you what I do,” he said with a\n\nslightly mischievous pursing of the lips. He pulled the bow to full draw,\n\nsighted down the arrow and let loose the bowstring. ” Pffftwiinnnnng.\n\nSPLATTT!” The arrow struck home.\n\nRusso’s steps echoed in the metal chamber as he crossed the 15 meters to\n\nretrieve the arrow, his last after five others shattered against steel\n\nbulkheads.\n\nLater, just before reaching Marcus Hook, Russo confided that even he thinks\n\nof leaving the sea. ” From the beginning, I want to do this. It is a\n\ntradition. The sea. But now that I see, I believe I will leave in one or two\n\nyears.”\n\nHe paused, this quiet man, and then spoke in careful, clear English.\n\n” The life is not normal. When you leave, you are in another world. When you\n\ncome back, it is as if you drop from the stars. You walk different. You talk\n\ndifferent. You look different. You are very nervous the first few days. You\n\nlose your personality, I am afraid. Not right away, but over the years, I\n\nbelieve, it slips away from you. I believe sometimes that I will get a job\n\ntyping perhaps. It is enough. Or perhaps the ferryboats along the shore. That\n\nis not so bad.”\n\nIn the meantime, he sights down his last arrow. ” Pffftwiinnn nnnggg\n\n. SPLATTT!” Another hit. Another 10 seconds closer to the end of five months\n\nat sea.\n\n” Always they think about what they do not have, not what they have,\n\n” Captain Mancini said one day with an atypical touch of bitterness. ” These\n\nyoung have a new mentality. What is the matter with them? You cannot drink\n\nthe wine and have the bottle full, yes? They make money. Good money. My God!\n\nTo make what my chief petty officer make, you must be an architect for 15\n\nyears. To make what my bosun make, a good man who love the sea, yes, but not\n\na brilliant man, you must be a bank director in Italy. Men my age! All the\n\ntime at sea. We give our lives! The young say, no sacrifice. But there must be\n\nsacrifice.”\n\nThe captain began his career when men regularly shipped out for two to three\n\nyears. But that was before technological improvements made the ships so big\n\nand expensive to operate and the loading and unloading procedures so fast. It\n\nwas common then for ships to remain in port for a week while longshoremen\n\nwrestled the cargoes by hand, and in one of those stops in the mid-1960s at a\n\nmainland Chinese port a younger, wide-eyed Antonio Mancini watched as the Red\n\nGuards dynamited a Russian freighter and then trained Tommy guns on his\n\nItalian crew as they attempted to help the drowning Russian sailors. It was\n\nhorrible, of course. But an adventure, too.\n\nIn the old slow days at sea, Mancini was away from his wife and two children\n\nfor more than a year, but he saw the world and collected adventures in ports.\n\nThe young officers sat attentively when Mancini told the Red Guard story, and\n\nwhen he told of Carnivale in Rio, of typhoons in the Malacca Straits, of\n\nfights in Hong Kong.\n\nThe younger officers on the Med Sun – Russo, Massagli, Stillittano\n\n– sometimes have enough time during the ship’s turnaround to stay a night at\n\nthe Brandywine Hilton at Naaman’s Road off Interstate 95 in northern\n\nDelaware, and maybe go to a suburban-mall Basco’s to buy discount goods.\n\n” When they say five months these days, they mean five months – you stay\n\non board five months,” Mancini said, his voice hushed. ” It may be harder. In\n\nmany ways, it is much harder.”\n\nWe forged ahead. There are notes from the mid-Atlantic: A storm blew wave\n\nafter wave over the forward part of the deck. . . . The temperature dropped\n\nto sweater weather. . . . Three laps around the ship make a mile.. . . The computer gets a new data tape punched out to put the ship on a new\n\ncourse. . . . The Godfather is quite good in Italian. The Pink Panther\n\nis not. . . . It takes 3 1/2 minutes to walk from one end of the ship to\n\nthe other. . . . One day the ship rocked like a slow pendulum and a porthole\n\nin my cabin showed nothing but water for a long count of four before the ship\n\nrolled back. Then the porthole lined up with slate-gray sky for four more\n\nseconds. . . . Sea . . . sky . . . sea.\n\nThe land appears finally as if buildings were bales of hay on the far horizon. We dock smoothly at Marcus Hook – but only a few of the men are able to leave the ship, on a mission to buy provisions.\n\nAs they left, Russo, who stayed onboard the ship constantly, had a last minute request.\n\nIf you see the right store, he said, could you buy arrows? Could you buy me lots of arrows?\n\nSidebar Story\n\nIT’S NOT JUST CHEESECAKES\n\nThe officers have talked of them for days at sea. Then, finally, they arrive.\n\nThe tanker Mediterranean Sun has reached Delaware Bay, and the small launch\n\nchops over the waves toward her from Lewes, Del., and the eight cherry\n\ncheesecakes are taken aboard the tanker with the pilot.\n\nThe desserts are a favorite of the Med Sun’s officers. They are also a good illustration of howships like the Med Sun pump money into the regional economy.\n\nSupposedly, tankers produce about $8 in spin-off benefits for every ton of\n\noil they pump into refinery reservoirs. The Mediterranean Sun, for example,\n\ncarried 97,000 tons of oil. So this trip should produce about $776,000 in\n\nbenefits to the local economy.\n\nIt seems an incredible amount. The ships simply come upriver and pump off\n\noil, after all. It is easier to understand that cargo ships, which require\n\ncranes and longshoremen, punch about $25 per ton of cargo into local cash\n\nregisters and paychecks.\n\nBut tankers, too, require expensive and often complex services on a grand\n\nscale, as well as costly materials. Fuel oil to run a ship costs $300 a ton.\n\nThe Med Sun burns around 75 tons a day – at a cost of something like $22,500.\n\nAll food except for fish, which is better and cheaper in Tunisia, is purchased\n\nhere by agents for the vessel.\n\nTugs, pilots and sometimes even fresh water can cost a ship money. The\n\nbarges that took off some of the Med Sun’s crude oil so she could clear the\n\n40-foot-deep Delaware River channel provide jobs for a half-dozen people. The\n\noffices of the barge company, the Interstate Ocean and Transport Co., the\n\nbiggest lighterage concern in the region, are filled with dozens of white-\n\ncollar workers.\n\nOn shore near the bay, there are launch services to bring on board\n\ninspectors. The U.S. Customs Service contracts with firms to measure the\n\namount of oil in the ship. A consortium of oil companies keeps a modern\n\nantipollution oil-skimmer vessel, the Delbay, stationed at Lewes. The\n\nPhiladelphia Maritime Exchange mans a reporting station overlooking the mouth\n\nof Delaware Bay, to keep tabs on ship traffic. Upriver, the Coast Guard\n\ninspects for pollution and tanker-safety compliance. Tugboat operators wait\n\nto dock the big ships.\n\nSun Transport (a Sun Co. subsidiary), which operates the Med Sun and other\n\ntankers, has just put up a modern building in Aston, Pa., just north of the\n\nDelaware line. Taxi drivers in Marcus Hook regularly make the $35 run (for\n\ntwo) to Philadelphia.\n\nWhen the Med Sun’s crew gets any sizable leave, U.S. immigration officers\n\nmust check them out. Then they may stay in the Brandywine Hilton, near\n\nClaymont, Del., or head for the blue-jean joints, or Basco’s.\n\nLast year, 289 fewer tankers came up the river than the year before, a 17\n\npercent decrease, in large part because Americans were using less petroleum.\n\nThat was good – but it meant more than just a downturn in demand for\n\ncheesecakes.\n\nA Very Modern Mutiny\n\nTHESE YEARS BEFORE THE MAST: A ‘MUTINY’ OFF CAPE MAY\n\nBy ROBERT R. FRUMP\n\nPublished 1982 The Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nThe Americans aboard the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Alert keep their\n\nbinoculars glued to the big tanker Ypapanti as it swings lazily at anchor in\n\nthe gentle rollers of the Atlantic 17 miles off Cape May, N.J.\n\nSolemn Pakistani crewmen quietly stalk the decks, and everything\n\nseems peaceful now, according to the Coast Guard.\n\nYet no one knows the truth of the Ypapanti affair. The tanker rests in international waters flying a foreign flag – a little chunk of Liberia floating out there,” as one Coast Guard officer put it – and a certain air of mystery may forever surround the\n\nmutiny alleged to have occurred on board.\n\nEven the Liberian officials know little about what goes on the tanker,\n\nwhich is registered in their country, led by a Greek captain, staffed by a\n\nPakistani crew and bound for the American port of Philadelphia.\n\n“My real fear is that some maniac in the crew may decide to torch it,\n\nand boom, there is oil all along the Atlantic seaboard and the Delaware\n\ncoast,” said Guy E. C. Maitland, the frustrated counsel to the Liberian\n\nBureau of Maritime Affairs. “Of course, with this kind of owner, I’m afraid\n\nthat he might try to scuttle it.\n\n“Oh, you can call it mutiny or a labor dispute, or anything you want to,\n\ncan’t you? I tend to believe the crew, because obviously the owner has not\n\ndealt in good faith. My concern is that neither the crew nor the officers are\n\nharmed and that there is no pollution as a result of sabotage.”\n\nSo goes the story of the Ypapanti, a tale with a plot that plays out\n\neach week in one port or another along the Delaware River and Bay with only\n\nsome slight twists to the plot and scope.\n\nIn the shadow of Center City skyscrapers, beneath the pipes and plumbing of\n\nrefineries in Delaware County and in New Jersey, the docks and the piers of\n\nthe river at times resemble a Third World country.\n\nThere is little law and less justice for the men and women who come here\n\nin ships, and crew members and officers alike frequently fall victim to the\n\nnon-system governing international shipping.\n\nThe Ypapanti is unique only in that the role of victim is not clearly\n\nassigned.\n\nWas it mutiny? The officers were forcibly removed from the bridge and\n\nphysically held prisoner by the crew, the ship owners say.\n\nOr was it a case of the officers and owners ripping off the crew?\n\nMost of the Pakistani crew members had been aboard for nine months. Some\n\nhad not been paid in all that time, attorneys for the crew say.\n\nEither way, such conflicts hardly cause a stir on the Philadelphia\n\nwaterfront. Sources along the river, such as the Rev. Robert Peoples and the\n\nsmall squad of ship’s visitors who operate from the Merchant Seamen’s Center\n\nof the Seamen’s Church Institute at Third and Arch Streets, provide this\n\nroutine sampler of crew life.\n\nNear the heart of Philadelphia’s riverfront renaissance area, at a pier\n\nwhere Reed Street meets Delaware Avenue, two Pakistani sailors aboard the\n\nJuanita Halkias last month asked for medical attention while in port. One had\n\na serious hernia; another had venereal disease.\n\nBoth men were refused leave from the ship. The captain argued that the\n\nproblems could wait until the ship returned weeks later to Greece, where\n\nmedical bills would be cheaper. Only after the seamen’s institute and the\n\nSeafarer’s International Union pressured the captain were the men treated\n\nhere.\n\nMany crew members, working on an expired contract, want to fly home to\n\nGreece. That matter remains unsettled.\n\nThe aging tanker Fadi B came upriver in January 1981, bound for a\n\nrefinery in Delaware. An oil-pollution inspector, stepping amid garbage and\n\nrotting vegetables in the hallways, said members of the Egyptian crew had\n\ncomplained of inadequate food and water.\n\nThey said, “Sir, sir, please help us,’ ” said the inspector, who\n\nrequested anonymity. “You run into so many of these. What could I do? I was\n\nthere to inspect for pollution.”\n\nThe Fadi B’s hull later cracked while unloading oil at Delaware City. The\n\nship was ordered to make repairs. No one knows the fate of the crew.\n\nThe Filipino crew members of the Terzia “jumped ship” in Philadelphia\n\nin April 1980 after maintaining they had not been paid properly. Shipping\n\nofficials admitted to keeping two payroll books: one to be shown to union\n\nofficials in Europe, the other to record the actual, lower wages paid to the\n\ncrew.\n\nThe crew members were flown back to Manila, but there their seamen’s\n\nbooks were confiscated by government shipping officials who supposedly\n\nsafeguard the rights of Filipino seamen. Union officials filed suit in\n\nfederal court, challenging the confiscation and alleged improper payments.\n\nSubsequently the seamen’s books were returned, along with a notation that the\n\ncrew members were complainers. The case is still pending.\n\nAuthorities here had some leverage in those cases because the crews were\n\nin U.S. territorial waters, where seamen have access to this country’s\n\ncourts and laws. The Ypapanti case differs. From the start, the Coast Guard\n\nrefused to allow the ship entrance to the bay.\n\nThe vessel was christened the Permina. Built in 1968, it was three\n\nfootball fields long and just light of supertanker status at 100,000\n\ndeadweight tons.\n\nLater the vessel would become the Stavik. Later still it was\n\ncalled the African Queen, and by the time the vessel was renamed the Ypapanti,\n\nthe ship flew a “flag of convenience” – here, the Liberian flag. Such a\n\nmaneuver gave the owner tax advantages and the ability to select crews from\n\nanywhere in the world.\n\nIt is a device employed by the best and the worst of ship owners. Or so say\n\nthe Liberians. The Ypapanti was now under the control of a group of Greek\n\nowners headed by a man named Karavias, whom the Liberians say they consider a\n\nshady operator. And the Ypapanti was already considered old by oil-tanker\n\nstandards when it first ran into trouble here with the Coast Guard in\n\nNovember.\n\nThe ship was made instantly older last year by new Coast Guard standards\n\nthat required the installation of inert gas” systems to help prevent\n\nexplosions. Oil vapors need a spark and oxygen to ignite. Inert gas, rigged\n\nfrom the ship’s funnels to its holds, displaces the oxygen and prevents\n\nexplosion.\n\nBut it costs about $1 million to install such equipment – a high cost\n\nfor an old tanker at a time when the world market is glutted with oil and with\n\nthe ships that carry it.\n\nSo in November, the Ypapanti came to Philadelphia without such a system installed. U.S. Coast Guard inspectors discovered the violation. They allowed the ship to discharge its cargo, then banned it from all U.S. ports until the new system had been installed.\n\nBut last month, the Ypapanti was back knocking on the door. The captain\n\nrequested entrance to the bay and river system to deliver oil to the Atlantic\n\nRichfield terminal at Fort Mifflin in Philadelphia. The Coast Guard said no.\n\nThe improvements had not been made.\n\nThe tanker dropped the hook.\n\nThat is to say, it released its anchor as its owner, the Astrolabe Bay\n\nShipping Corp. of London and Monrovia, and the charterers, Latino Oil Corp. of\n\nHouston, pondered what to do.\n\n“You have to wonder how the owners and charterers had the galvanized\n\ngall to send this ship up the river,” Maitland of the Liberian Maritime\n\nBureau asked. “Now what did they think? That the Coast Guard could be bribed\n\nor bargained with? Probably so. We are dealing with Karavias here, one of our\n\nless cosmetically concerned ship owners.\n\n“And it should be noted that no less a bunch of luminaries as the\n\nAtlantic Richfield Oil Co. had a role to play. Oh, yes, they’ve kept a low\n\nprofile. But they are one of the guilty parties here.\n\n“How could they not know that the ship had no inert gas system? How you\n\ncannot know something like that, God only knows. But Atlantic Richfield takes\n\nthis What, me worry?’ stance over this while the whole shoreline is placed\n\nunder potential hazard.\n\n“It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. If you look at any accident\n\ninvolving Liberian tankers, you’ll find a major (oil company) involved. The\n\noil companies share responsibility in this.”\n\nAn Atlantic Richfield spokesman said the company had contracted to buy\n\nthe oil on a “landed basis.” That is, he said, Atlantic Richfield owned the\n\noil only when it was delivered.\n\n“We were not the charterers of the ship,” the spokesman said, and\n\ntherefore had no knowledge of what ship would be used. “We agreed to\n\npurchase the oil once the ship arrived at Fort Mifflin. It has not, and so we\n\nhave no involvement with the ship or its cargo.”\n\nThere the matter might have ended. A maritime expert in such matters said\n\nit would be common practice for the vessel to simply steam to one of the\n\nCaribbean terminals near the island of Aruba and unload there. The cargo\n\nmight then be delivered by a newer, sounder ship to a U.S. port.\n\nInstead, something else happened. Coast Guard officials believe it\n\nhappened May 26.\n\nCall it a mutiny. Call it a strike. Of the 40 crew members, 28 of them, most Pakistani, said no to the Greek officers.\n\nNo more sailing. No more ports of call. No more promises of pay that they say had not arrived.\n\nThey simply stopped work. And the Ypapanti stopped moving.\n\nAnd there it sits, as it has for almost a month, too close to the shore\n\nto remove the pollution threat, too far away to bring help from U.S.\n\nauthorities.\n\nMaitland and the Liberian government asked the State Department to allow\n\nthe Coast Guard to remove the seamen because of the threat of a catastrophe\n\nand pollution. Such a move might have gotten the ship moving again with a new\n\ncrew. The State Department declined, saying the government could not intervene\n\nin a labor case.\n\nAnd the ship sits at sea still, with crew members threatening to throw\n\njust about anyone in the water who attempts to board, and the “owners’\n\nattorneys advocating storming the ship by force,” Maitland said. Other\n\nagencies are powerless to help.\n\n“We can’t help them or send them help through government agencies,\n\nthough the Coast Guard asked us to, because the ship is in international\n\nwaters,” Peoples said. “That leaves those poor devils at the mercy of the\n\nmaster of the ship.”\n\nOn the contrary, attorneys for the owners say, the situation is just the\n\nreverse.\n\nCapt. Stiliano Frangopoulos is more sinned against than sinning,\n\nthey say. He was removed from the bridge forcibly on Monday, they say, and\n\nhas been confined against his will.\n\n“It is a mutiny,” said attorney Bob Mullen of New York City, in defense of\n\nthe owners he represents. “We are hopeful this will be resolved quietly. We\n\nhope to have it cleared up by the end of the weekend. We are trying to\n\nnegotiate and quiet everything down.”\n\nIndeed, the Liberians have held conferences for the attorneys involved.\n\nAnd a legal representative of the crew was scheduled to board the ship soon to\n\ninspect conditions aboard it.\n\nBut Maitland is not so optimistic. “If it is a labor dispute,” he\n\nsaid, “then we’re likely to see that ship sitting there, and sitting there\n\nfor two to three months.\n\n“If there were an anti-pollution boom surrounding it, I’d rest easier.\n\nThe Liberian government has really done about all it can in this. We are\n\ntrying to get rid of owners like Karavias. We thought we had.”\n\nThe Ypapanti incident is likely to overshadow for the moment the great\n\nimprovements made in the inspection and regulation of ships by the Liberian\n\ngovernment in the past five years. Even the harshest critics of flags-of-\n\nconvenience shipping concede those improvements.\n\nAnd in reporting the frequency of crew disputes here, a number of states\n\nof affairs could get out of focus. Many oil companies along the river have an\n\nadmirable record of aiding seamen in distress. Local industries support the\n\nseamen’s institute and its staff of ship’s visitors. Most oil companies,\n\nPeoples said, have a good record in allowing such visits. The Sun Co., for\n\nexample, even offered to provide space for a substation for the ship’s\n\nvisitors.\n\nMoreover, U.S. harbors afford great advantages to foreign seamen, and the\n\nadvantages taken by some of the seamen filing complaints do not paint a\n\npicture of lily white innocence. (An engineer aboard one ship, for\n\nexample, accepted the help of People’s staff, then stiffed the center on a\n\n$5,000 check.)\n\nStill, there are oil companies here – Atlantic Richfield is one of them\n\n– that do not allow ship’s visitors at terminals where tankers are unloading.\n\n–\n\n“Our policy is clear and consistent,” an Atlantic Richfield spokesman said.\n\n“No member of the public is allowed in there for security reasons.”\n\nAnd all the ship’s visitors here cannot counteract conditions in the\n\nhiring halls of Piraeus, Greece, and Manila, the Philippines.\n\nA scene in Manila at offices of the Far East Tramp Operating Co., the company that hired the crew members who jumped ship from the Terzia in Philadelphia, is\n\nillustrative.\n\n“Elevator for employees only,” the sign for the sixth-floor offices\n\nstates in the lobby. “Sailors must use stairs.”\n\nThe Far East officials freely admit there were two sets of contracts\n\n– record books – in the Terzia affair. The crew members knew about it, they\n\nsay, and agreed to the ruse so that the ships could obtain union clearance\n\nand avoid boycotts in European ports.\n\n“When the men are looking for work, they will sign anything,” said a\n\ncaptain in the offices of Far East Tramp. They all kiss your feet.”\n\nMore than 150,000 Filipinos hope to ship out, according to Capt. Lou A.\n\nAtienza, the president and general manager of Far East Tramp. Only about\n\n50,000 get jobs. The double-contract set-up helps attract ship owners to\n\nFilipino crews. It is the unofficial national policy of the Philippine\n\ngovernment’s National Seamen’s Board, Atienza said.\n\n“If the world will not understand the side of the Third World, and if they\n\nwant to force us to pay the so-called (union) wages, it will lower the chance\n\nfor employment of our seamen,” he said in an interview.\n\nIt is an argument that leaves Brian Laughton of the International\n\nTransportation Federation unmoved and yawning in his London offices, leaning\n\non a stack of crew complaints that run from run-of-the-mill salary disputes\n\nto the shackling of African crew members in their quarters.\n\nThe federation has led the European boycott of vessels that do not keep contract provisions.\n\n“What keeps vessel owners from then going to the Burmese and then to the\n\nMicronesians in a vicious downward spiral?” he asked. “This is all about\n\ngoing back 100 to 150 years, isn’t it? To a form of capital not subject to\n\nsocial control.\n\n“Businesses think they have absolute freedom on the open seas, don’t\n\nthey? That they can do whatever the hell they want – to whomever the hell they\n\nwant.”\n\nSaid Stanley Kops, a Philadelphia-based legal expert on such matters and\n\ncounsel for the Terzia crew members:\n\n“Two sets of contracts? Three sets of contracts? Where does this all\n\nend? It is a bad, bad system, and I don’t know the solution. I think it lies\n\nwith ship owners who sometime, somewhere must get together and say, ‘We are\n\nmaking a contract and will stand by it.’ ”\n\nBut shippers worldwide have not. And the Ypapanti rocks in the big\n\nAtlantic swells while the Alert watches, helpless to intervene.\n\n“The Liberian government has done about all it can,” Maitland said.\n\nWe’ve asked your State Department to intervene. “They call it a labor\n\ndispute, which it may be, but it is the menace to the coast line, to the\n\nentire resort shore, which should concern them.\n\n“What happens if the crew – which is very rebellious, make no mistake\n\nabout that, although I tend to believe them in their claims – what happens if\n\nthe crew takes a meat cleaver to the captain’s head?\n\n“What happens then? That’s the menace. Right now there is a captain and\n\nthere is a crew. But how much authority there is out there is another\n\nquestion, and I hate to think about what is going through the minds of\n\ncrewmen who have been on board the ship for nine months, who are now just\n\nwaiting and waiting, cooped up on a ship going nowhere.”\n\nPost note: A part of the mutiny was resolved when officers and crews literally jumped ships after Coast Guard patrol vessels came near. They stood on the rail and dove or jumped into the open ocean – where Coast Guard rescuers – who could not board the ship — were bound to rescue the crew once they were in peril in the water, offboard of the ship. .\n\nThe Voyage of the Pendleton\n\nand the Fort Mercer\n\n(Excerpt from manuscript that would develop into “Two Tankers Down,” published in 2008 by Lyons Press)\n\nThe ships were nearly identical with the same cargoes heading for the same general destination at the same speed. Across the Gulf of Mexico, they sailed, in warm temperatures in the 70’s, then rounded Florida and made the turn toward New England and colder weather. They were two huge floating containers joined by dozens of others in the coastal trade that moved oil and kerosene that helped power the frigid Northeast during the winter months.\n\nPaetzel, onboard the Fort Mercer, knew T-2s had troubles but had faith in the crack arresters. He could see two of them on deck and knew two more were below on the hull. The big steel belts were recommended in 1947 to attempt to stop cracks from spreading in the T-2’s. The ships were among the first all-welded produced en masse in the war and mariners were suspicious of the welding process. Riveted ships with hulls of small steel-plating each held together with steel pins would suffer cracks but rarely casualties. The one plate might crack, but the crack would only run through the plate, not the entire ship. The crack would be stopped by the rivets, or the next plate over would hold firm.\n\nNot so for the all-welded T-2s with nary a rivet in place. Welds did not stop cracks as rivets and plate-ends did. Welds might even create cracks, some thought. And when started, the cracks did not stop. They shot around the ship at the speed of sound.\n\nAnd the most dramatic example of what could go wrong was the Schenectady, a brand new tanker that had been to sea trials in 1943 and was moored dockside. Without warning, in calm waters, she simply cracked in two. One crack raced through the girth of the ship in seconds and met itself in the middle. The Schenectady jackknifed down with her bow and stern pointing toward the sky, still moored dockside.\n\nEveryone thought bad welding was the problem. Everyone was pretty much wrong. Welding was visible but at best played a bit role. The real problem existed not in view of the naked eye but at a molecular level.\n\nThe problem was the steel. Yet not even that was clear at first. Wartime steel contained too much sulfur. The steel worked fine in riveted ships, but not in all-welded ships. Not at certain times, at least.\n\nMostly those times were a.) when it got cold and b.) when it got rough.\n\nAnd now, the Pendleton and the Fort Mercer, far from the 80 degreee weather of Louisiana, were going where it was both rough and cold.\n\nThe two tankers first felt the brunt of the gale as they rounded Long Island on February 16th. The storm was bad, but both ships had weathered far worse. Captain Fitzgerald onboard the Pendleton saw no need to alter course nor did Captain Spaetzel onboard the Fort Mercer. Miles apart, casually aware of each other on their radars, they both kept forward speed with the props rotating between 45 and 65 revolutions per minute depending on conditions.\n\nThey passed Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard and moved north on February 17th. The two ships came even with Chatham and Bernie Webber’s little outpost around, noting the lightships that guarded Chatham Bar and Pollocks Rip and marked the dangerous currents at the elbow of Cape Cod. There was a new experimental radar machine at the Coast Guard station and it picked up the T-2’s as they passed, headed for their ports of call.\n\nAt Race Point, near the tip of the cape, their paths divurged finally, each heading to her port of call.\n\nBut once there – the Pendleton outside Boston, the Fort Mercer outside Portland, Maine – visibility was next to nothing and the storm had worsened.\n\nIndependent of one another, each captain came to the same careful decision: docking in this sort of weather was not worth the risk. It would be much easier to ride out the storm overnight in deep water and come into port on a sunnier day. Ships bumped into things in ports when visibility was so poor. Or they bumped bottom in shallow water if they missed channel markers.\n\nOff the cape, in the deep waters there, lay safety. The ships would pitch and buck in the waves there but they would come to no harm as there was nothing hard to hit. The Fort Mercer turned south from Maine and took up a position about 25 miles off Cape Cod. The Pendleton took a similar bearing from Boston and turned her bow into the waves keeping just enough forward movement to maintain steering and stability. She was much closer to the cape but under full control. Both ships turned slightly into the waves at an angle and kept up power at around 45 rpm. It was a big blow but each ship had handled much bigger ones.\n\nThis was all routine and the crews of both ships settled into the routine. The deck officers and able seamen stood watch four hours on, four hours off, as was the tradition, on the bridge, which was forward on the ship. The engineers and oilers and wipers toiled deep below decks keeping the boiler fires burning, the steam coming, and the smooth electrical drives turning the powerful props. Someone measured the ocean temperature. It varied between 38 and 42 degrees that night. The winds were 50 miles per hour and the waves, some of them crested at 30 to 45 feet.\n\nStill, this was no big deal. Cape Cod coast was famous for its beaches, resorts and tourism now, but in the age of sail it was famous as a wrecking grounds. Thousands of sail vessels had crashed on that leeward shore in storms just like this. A dismasting, a loss of a rudder, a sudden failure of wooden seams and a ship was quickly blown into the surf line and ruin. Running ashore was not salvation; it was ruin. Ships would drag bottom hundreds of yards from safety and the waves would pound the ship and the men into the sand.\n\nBut that was then and this was now – in the age of steam and power. The Fort Mercer, and the Pendleton, took the seas. forged on. The strong and sturdy bows would plunge and be buried by the sea, then explode back into the air triumphant, pointing toward Boston, toward Maine. Just waiting for the storm to clear a bit. Most of them expected to be on land in two hours.\n\nChief Engineer Sievert in the bowels of the Pendleton kept the prop spinning just as Fitzgerald had signaled him with a series of bells that ran from the forward bridge to the engine room astern. Sometimes he would speed up; sometimes slow down. The bells told the engine room what the bridge desired.\n\nShe was handling nicely, Sybert thought, but early in the morning, before 5 a.m., a heavy sea washed over the poopdeck. It was nothing really, but notable enough to call to the bridge. If they changed watch and sent seamen back from the forward bridge to the stern quarters, they could be in real trouble. Sybert told Paetzel something like:\n\n“We’ve got seas over the poopdeck — best not to send anyone back aft on the catwalk else they might get drenched.”\n\nFitzgerald acknowledged the seas. Had already seen them. Told Sybert that he had sent the seamen down to get copy in the forward salon. But thanks for the heads up.\n\nThus did little decisions above the decks of the Pendleton affect the fate of the crew as below the decks, in the very structure of the ship, inside the steel itself, very small changes in the steel of the Pendleton would have a profound impact upon them all.\n\nThe men may have been warm aboard the Pendleton but the Pendleton’s steel was far too cold and far too stressed. The metal in her hull began behaving differently. It was far less ductile. Normally, steel flexes. The whole ship bends and moves with the sea. But the ductility in this steel – “mild steel” it was called by some; “dirty steel” by others – changed with temperature. The colder it got, the more the steel took on the characteristics of crystal than a ductile, flexible metal. It became brittle. Taffy may stretch at room temperature; freeze it and it will shatter when hit with a hammer. In a sense, that is what was happening to the steel in the Pendleton’s hull.\n\nAnd with 35 foot waves, that steel was most certainly being hammered.\n\nAt around 5:50AM, Sybert felt the ship take a heavy lurch. There was an explosive bang, very loud. Then Sybert felt an even heavier lurch and the explosive sound this time was even louder than the first bang.\n\nOthers felt it more than heard it. A sound. A force. A pulse of energy. Another said it was tearing sound. They were not sure what it was, only that “it” was not good.\n\nDid it take five minutes, one of the men was asked later.\n\n“Five seconds,” he replied.\n\nSybert felt the ship roll heavily and take a list to port. Then she straightened. It was normal again.\n\nEverything seemed okay. But he could not reach the captain to find out what Fitzgerald wanted done, to see what had happened. The signals were dead and so were the phones. Had they run aground? Struck something? Sybert needed instructions now. How fast? How slow? Forward? After? What did Captain Fitzgerald want? There were no bells.\n\nThen Sybert dispatched an oiler, Tchuda W. Southerland, to the deck to see if he could make his way forward to contact Fitzgerald. Ask the captain what we should do.\n\nAnd when the Southerland got topside he ran forward against the ripping gale — and found there was not a forward there. He gaped out at the emptiness where the forward part of the ship had been. Then looked over and saw what he thought was another ship – a ship that oddly had painted on its bow the words, “Pendleton.”\n\nBut he was on the Pendleton and there was a split second before he understood that he was looking at the free-floating bow of his ship, and that the Pendleton had split in two at the number 7 and 8 tanks.\n\nPumpman James E. Young awakened from sleep though the ship had just taken a heavy lurch. He went to the mess where everyone else was. The ship’s split, they said. He did not believe it. and rushed topside. Instantly, he was scared. The gale knocked him about and the wind and ice and snow stung him. And there was the bow. Unmistakably. He rushed back down to confirm the bad news to Sybert. ……\n\nSybert kept up steam, ordered water tight hatches closed, and closed down the electrical power for a moment as a precaution. Then he summoned everyone to the mess room.\n\nThe fracture was such that the officers were stranded on the front part of the ship – the bow section. The engineers and most of the crew were in the stern section.\n\nCircuit breakers kicked out all electricity to the forward part of the vessel, while the machinery in the rear continued as if normal. The stern section resembled a hotel that had had one wall blown away. The cross section of the ship was exposed to the elements – but functioning and to an extent seaworthy, even in a gale.\n\nAll of them waited for an explosion. Their kerosene and heating oil had sprung from the tanks when the ship halves separated. Hell, they were tankermen. Death by explosion was fore-ordained.\n\nBut mercifully, the fire never came. The wind was too strong. It whipped away the fumes. Or the break — so complete and large — dispelled the fumes quickly so no magical and deadly mixture of oxygen, gas vapors and spark created the traditional tanker bomb.\n\nFor these things the men on the stern could be thankful.\n\nThe officers on the bow on the other hand were in a different world. Without time for an SOS, without time for anything. The men were stranded on the bridge of the ship with no way to life rafts or lifeboats. The bow pitched and bucked at a 45 degree angle to the sea. It was buffeted, swept and raked by heavy seas. The bridge was like a beach at storm tide. Breakers swept over it. The bow-half bobbed about, tilting evermore toward a vertical plane.\n\nThen the whole bow, twisting and torqueing like a rodeo bull, swung in a wave’s eddy and veered back toward the stern.\n\nSybert ordered the engine room men to go full reverse. Not that he thought they could. To his amazement, the stern responded as if she were just a smaller, clumbsier ship. She had maneuverability. The bow section swung close to the stern, but missed, passing through the waters that Sybert’s half of the ship had occuppied just moments before.\n\nThe thought had to strike Sybert there and then. It was strange, but there it was. He was master of a ship. His half-ship. He had given a command, maneuvered her. She responded. He was a master.\n\nHe took command. But there was one problem with that. And he quickly confessed it. He gathered all members of the survivors in the mess and told it to them straight: Boys, our officers are gone and you able bodied seamen are going to have to pick up the slack. I know engines. Don’t know much about navigation, lifeboats, and seamanship in general.\n\nQuickly, he found that one able bodied seaman, Jacob Hicks, and another, Ray Steele, would take leadership positions. He came to think of Hicks as a makeshift chief mate, the ranking deck officer.\n\nDid Sybert want them to check the life boats? Yes, Sybert said, but he thought the best thing to do was remain on board the stern section of the ship if it seemed seaworthy. Others were dispatched to close all water tight doors. Sybert and his engineers checked the salinity of the boilers to see if too much seawater had leaked in.\n\nHicks and Steele scrambled up on the deck and what they saw and felt there was disheartening. The gale was now a full blown screeching storm with winds of 50 mph and more. They struggled to reach the lifeboats and once there prepared them for launch. But below them – sometimes over them – soared 35 to 45 foot waves. Launching a lifeboat into such mountains of water would be fearsome work. It would be a miracle just to get a boat out there without the sea splintering it. Once launched, how long could a small lifeboat remain afloat?\n\nThey seemed stuck staying with the stern.\n\nThey looked across the water toward the bow. The bow and all the deck officers on it were carried swiftly away from the stern by the mountainous waves. The bow section was still afloat but increasingly it rose at an angle to the plane of the sea, lifting the bow to the sky, plunging the bridge and deckhouse down toward the bottom. In fifteen to twenty minutes, the bow disappeared from view.\n\nSybert was certain they would get help soon. The radioman had almost certainly sent an SOS from the bridge.\n\nIt took time for it to sink in that this was improbable and that no one on shore was aware any of this was happening. Slowly, they were understanding the fix they were in.\n\nThe splitting of the ship was clear enough; the ramifications of the split less so. The T-2’s had a forward bridge house. That is to say, the captain and most officers were located toward the front of the ship in a structure that rose from the deck and gave them a clear view ahead. The engineers and engine room were located aft.\n\nThe bow had the radio but no power. Sybert’s new half-ship had the power but no radio. Sybert did the math. The ship had split in part in about five seconds. There could not have been time, no time at all, to understand what was happening and send out a signal.\n\nNow, Sybert took stock. The fact that they were close to shore had been a blessing he thought initially. But now?\n\nHe could maneuver the stern section a bit, but he knew they were drifting rapidly toward shore – the Cape Cod shore where so many thousands of wrecks had washed up. If he attempted to steer and control too aggressively, the ship would pitch and lurch. There was little that he could do other than go with the flow and steer to keep the stern section straight. He could not steam her farther out to sea, just keep her straight as she drifted. Everytime he attempted to steer and maneuver, he could, briefly, but the forward exposed part of the stern dipped down and got drenched.\n\nAbove him, on deck, Hicks dug out a flare gun from the lifeboat. He pointed it skyward and the flare arched out over the water into the darkness.\n\nPerhaps they would be spotted visually from shore. Perhaps the officers on the bow would respond with a flare back. He took out another flare cartridge and aimed it skyward. The cartridge flizzled and popped but did not fire. From the bow, no reply came at all. Hicks looked at the date stamped on the flares. “July 1942.” He threw the dud flare into the water after it had fizzled. He loaded another. No luck. No signals. He took smoke markers from the lifeboat and lit them, then tossed them overboard. They put out a pathetic smudge of smoke quickly whipped away to nothing in the gale.\n\nNo radio. No flares. No smoke. No blinker lights for sending code. No one who could send or understand code, either.\n\nNo one knew they were out there. No one knew they were in trouble. No one had any way of finding out.\n\nWell, there was one way. One ancient way.\n\nAaron Powell, a wiper, rigged up a whistle. Another wiper was too small a man to work the rig himself; it took some heft to pull the line. So Powell drafted George “Tiny Myers,” an AB. He weighed more than 300 pounds, not much of it muscle, it had to be said, but enough weight to heave that whistle lanyard.\n\nThey were not sure what the true naviagational signals were, but kept blowing and blowing and blowing. The danger signal was all Powell knew… a series of short blasts. They would blast out four short signals and then pause to listen for any reply.\n\nThere was none. They were alone.\n\nBombs on the Water:\n\nThe Story of the SS Badger State\n\n(The following is a longer version of what appeared in the book “Until the Sea Shall Free Them.”)\n\nThen he (Corl, master of the Marine Electric) shrugged and added sheepishly, “This may be my imagination with the way the seas are running. I can’t really tell but I think she’s settling by the head. ”\n\nWas the tire flat or not? Was the bow sluggish or not? The more you listened for it, the more it seemed flat. Then when you listened again, you weren’t so sure. Was the ship sinking slowly in the bow? Corl had been watching and listening too long to be sure.\n\nCusick went first to get his friend and fellow Marine Electric veteran Richard Powers, the chief engineer. The two men mounted the stairs to the bridge and looked out to the bow. They were the old pros on the Marine Electric and knew how she rode seas.\n\nThey were horrified. It was apparent they were in trouble. The bow was not lifting properly. The seas were roaring down the deck. They had to act fast now. If they did not function as a team, all would be lost. They let Corl know they were in trouble. Maybe big trouble.\n\nCorl did three things. He called the Coast Guard. Then he set the engineers to pumping and shifting ballast around. And he ordered all crew and officers awakened and the lifeboats prepared.\n\nNow he faced a difficult decision. Captains could not abandon ship too soon. Most basically, they would be safer riding out the storm in a 605 foot 24,000 ton coal carrier than a 25 foot lifeboat. Even with its deck awash, the Marine Electric was a safer haven than out there.\n\nHe had only to look at the case of the SS Marine Merchant, a Liberty ship from the war, loaded with sulphur, when it ran into trouble off New Hampshire in April 1961. The ship split in two, but the main deck held the two halves together – like a broken index finger held together only by the skin. The captain made ready to abandon ship, but weighed that option against staying on board the old vessel. There were Force 10 storm conditions in the still chilly North Atlantic – about what the Marine Electric faced now. He stood pat. Morning came. The weather lightened. All men made it\n\nFor Corl, that case and others were a major factor. There was no indication that the ship was actually sinking. Only that they were having trouble. They could all walk away from this dry. Could wait out the weather and step daintily onto a rescue cutter from the Coast Guard. Even get a tow in, ship and cargo undamaged.\n\nAnd that too was a concern. The master had a responsibility to his men, yes, but weighed always against his responsibility to the owner and shipper. If he left too soon, he could be held liable, lose his license. If he left the ship to the elements before it was clear the ship was sinking, he would violate civil law standards and modern laws of a master’s conduct. Settling at the head was not sinking. He had an obligation to the owners to preserve the ship unless it was clear the ship was sinking.\n\nAnd if he needed a reminder of that, he needed only look at the case of the Smith Voyager, another old World War II leftover, that developed a severe 20 degree list in the South Atlantic back in 1964, on its way to India with a cargo of grain. Water had breached the hatches. Water was spraying into the engine room. The crew manned the lifeboats and most of them were rescued.\n\nBut a formal Marine Board of Investigation found the master in error for letting his men go — even though it appeared they left without his leave. The ship eventually sank, and that may not have happened had the captain kept his cool and his men on board, the board said. The master was brought up on charges and his license and livelihood threatened.\n\nEven more powerful than the threat of formal action were the traditions and customs of the sea. The old saying about the master going down with his ship was not an ancient myth. It happened in contemporary times. The master of the Flying Enterprise stayed with his ship in 1952 and received a ticker tape parade in New York City. The tendency, the tradition, was to fight to save the ship. And these extremes were taken for granted whether or not you got the ticker tape parade.\n\nNo one, for example, made a big fuss over what the captain and crew did in the late 1960’s aboard The Badger State –one of the most heroic and least known voyages in contemporary history. And no one would have prosecuted the master and his men for leaving.\n\nIn the case of the Smith Voyager, the crew were said to have abandoned a grain ship prematurely. In the case of The Badger State, the crew would not leave a leaking, listing ammunition ship with bombs rolling around in its holds, when told to by their captain. Not just the captain but the crew was prepared to go down.\n\nAnd many of them did.\n\nShe was bound for Da Nang during the Vietnam War, an old liberty ship built in 1944, about five years past the 20-year age limit where most ships are retired or officially called “over-age.” In her holds were more than 5,000 tons of bombs. Steel bands held the bombs to each other and to their metal pallet frames. So large were the 2,000-pound bombs that their noses protruded from the pallets by 29 inches. 100 pallets of the one-ton finned cylinders"
