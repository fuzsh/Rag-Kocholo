The Bridge is a structure that connects the Main Biome to the Safari, which is separated by the River.

Function[]

Its main function is granting access to the Safari, which occurs when the bridge is lowered, upon the payment of its fee. It can also be used to access the Lone Cave. When a player lowers the bridge when there is an ostrich eye placed within the hole in the glass, the bridge will lower down further than normal, then the water under the bridge disappears, and after that the player must jump down, and then they are at the Lone Cave.

To lower it, one must pay $100 Money to Seranok or Merely, who are located at the Bridge Booths, located at opposite sides of the Bridge. If one has the Super Bridge gamepass, then lowering the bridge has no cost.

Moving the bridge usually takes 10 to 15 seconds, but it can take longer if the server is slow. The bridge stays down for three minutes, but by paying $100 whilst the bridge is lowered one can extend the remaining time by another three minutes.

Design[]

The bridge is large in size and primarily coloured a faded-cyan and grey. It uses a vertical-lift design with two sets of counterweights to lower and elevate the road. The road on either side of the bridge is flanked by a purple booth where the player can pay to lower the bridge.

A supposed easter egg is also located under its platform on the Main Biome's side; Sorcus.
