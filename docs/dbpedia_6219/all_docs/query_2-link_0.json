        "text": "\"Point me!\"\n\nThis article is about the video game. You may be looking for the novel, film, soundtrack, video game soundtrack of the same name or man nicknamed Half-Blood Prince.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a video game developed by Electronic Arts and published by Electronic Arts. The game coincides with the theatrical release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The game was released on 30 June, 2009, on the Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, and Xbox 360 platforms.\n\nPlot[]\n\nIn Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore prepares Harry for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching as Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defences and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information about Voldemort's power.\n\nContent[]\n\nQuidditch\n\nWizard duels and multiplayer duelling mode\n\nPotion-making\n\nHogwarts free-roaming (similar to the previous Harry Potter game, Order of the Phoenix)\n\nMissions at night\n\nRon's love-life\n\nInferi battle\n\nLocations[]\n\nNote:- Locations in italics are optional areas that are not necessary to visit to complete the game.\n\nHogwarts[]\n\nInitial location\n\nFront Gates\n\nHagrid's Hut\n\n1st location area unlocked (Main Entrance Area and Grand Staircase Tower)\n\nGryffindor Tower\n\nGrand Staircase\n\nEntrance Hall\n\nEntrance Courtyard\n\nViaduct\n\nViaduct Entrance\n\nEntrance Dungeon\n\nDungeons\n\nPotions Classroom\n\nGreat Hall (Gryffindor Duelling Club Location)\n\nDumbledore's office\n\nPaved Courtyard\n\n2nd location area unlocked (Clock Tower Area - 5th Floor)\n\nHospital Wing\n\nClock Tower\n\nClock Tower Courtyard\n\nCovered Bridge\n\nStone Circle\n\nQuidditch Gate (Flying Club Location)\n\nTraining Grounds (Hufflepuff Duelling Club Location)\n\nHogwarts Greenhouses (Potions Club Location)\n\nBoathouse\n\n3rd Location area unlocked (7th Floor)\n\nSixth Floor\n\nSeventh Floor\n\nSlughorn's Office\n\nPaved Courtyard (Slytherin Duelling Club Location)\n\n4th Location area unlocked (Transfiguration Area)\n\nStone Bridge\n\nTransfiguration Courtyard (Ravenclaw Duelling Club Location)\n\nLibrary\n\nCharms Classroom\n\nTransfiguration Classroom\n\n5th Location area unlocked (Astronomy Tower Area)\n\nSuspension Bridge\n\nAstronomy Tower\n\nMoaning Myrtle's Bathroom (similar to sixth-floor boys' bathroom)\n\nOwlery\n\nOther locations[]\n\nHorcrux Cave\n\nThe Burrow\n\nSpinner's End (in cutscenes)\n\nDiagon Alley (in cutscenes)\n\nGameplay[]\n\nWii[]\n\nThe game utilises the Wii Remote features as it did in the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix video game.[1]. But unlike the previous game, players can now also use the motion sensing and vibration features to brew potions. Potion brewing involves following a complex recipe one step at a time. The steps include picking up vials of liquid, shaking them (by shaking the Wii Remote) until they froth, and tipping the Wii Remote to pour it into the mixture, being very careful not to pour in too much. Another possible step is stirring the mixture with the Wii Remote until it changes colour. If it starts vibrating, that is the sign to move away before it blows up.[2]\n\nHarry Potter can duel against Draco Malfoy in a Duelling Room with a long platform, similar to the one seen in the second film, but wider to allow dodging of spells. Moving in order to dodge is done with the Nunchuk Control Stick, while casting spells is done with Wii Remote and Nunchuk gestures. Combat spells currently implemented include a shield spell (\"Protego\") cast by crossing the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, a standard attack spell by striking downwards with the Wii Remote (\"Stupefy\"), a charged version by holding the Wii Remote up for longer first, and a more powerful attack spell by swinging the Wii Remote and Nunchuck to the left.[2] There is also Quidditch & 2-player Duelling.\n\nThe game follows the film nearly word for word but misses out on some points from the book, just like the film did. First the player follows a story mode type of play and completes missions, but after Dumbledore's death, there is free time to finish potions, complete Quidditch trials and practise duelling with the Gryffindor's, Hufflepuff's, Ravenclaw's and Slytherins.\n\nNintendo DS[]\n\nIn the Nintendo DS version of the game, the Stylus is used, once again, for spells as well as mini-games such as Gobstones, collecting ingredients for potions, Quidditch games, and Exploding Snap. It also has have six \"environmental\" spells including Accio and Incendio, and twelve combat spells. The game is free roaming with mini quests as well as closely following the story line[3].\n\nPSP[]\n\nThe Game-Mechanics are different in the PSP version, because of the lack of the right analogue stick. Detailed information about the mechanics is missing.\n\nPlayStation 3[]\n\nThe game uses SIXAXIS controls or the right analogue stick just like the previous game, but this time it includes DUALSHOCK 3 vibration capability. Also, it includes use of the PS3's trophy system.\n\nPC[]\n\nA keyboard and mouse is used, just like the previous game and the controls are reportedly easier to use. However, the game can also be controlled with an analogue joypad. Support for the XBOX 360 controller is built in (and graphics of controls use this controller), but other generic controllers work perfectly as well. There is no multiplayer wizard duelling for the PC platform, as the PC is purely single player.\n\nXbox 360[]\n\nSpells are cast with the control stick just like the previous game.\n\nPlaystation 2[]\n\nSpells are cast with the control stick just like the previous game.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nDaniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter (appearance), voiced by Adam Sopp\n\nRupert Grint as Ron Weasley\n\nEmma Watson as Hermione Granger (appearance), voiced by Rachel Sternberg\n\nBonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley\n\nTom Felton as Draco Malfoy\n\nEvanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood\n\nKatie Leung as Cho Chang\n\nGeorgina Leonidas as Katie Bell\n\nJessie Cave as Lavender Brown\n\nJosh Herdman as Gregory Goyle\n\nJamie Waylett as Vincent Crabbe\n\nAlfie Enoch as Dean Thomas\n\nJim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn (appearance), voiced by Michael Percival\n\nAlan Rickman as Severus Snape (appearance), voiced by James Faulkner\n\nHelena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange (appearance), voiced by Beth Chalmers\n\nViolet Columbus as Shepherdess (appearance), voiced by Eleanor Hans\n\nMichael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore (appearance), voiced by Christopher Birch\n\nHelen McCrory as Narcissa Malfoy (appearance)\n\nDave Legeno as Fenrir Greyback\n\nDavid Bradley as Argus Filch (appearance), voiced by Allan Corduner[4]\n\nRomilda Vane (Mentioned only)\n\nHannah Abbott (Mentioned only)\n\nSusan Bones (Mentioned only)\n\nAmelia Bones (Mentioned only)\n\nThe Bloody Baron (Mentioned only)\n\nTony Dudson as Giffard Abbott\n\nJonathan Kydd as Basil Fronsac / Temeritus Shanks\n\nBeth Chalmers as Damara Dodderidge / Gargoyle\n\nMichael Percival as Timothy the Timid / Gargoyle\n\nIsobel Middleton as Fat Lady\n\nFred and George Weasley (Mentioned only)\n\nSybill Trelawney (Mentioned only)\n\nFang (Heard only)\n\nLeanne\n\nTom Riddle\n\nLestrange\n\nAvery\n\nPansy Parkinson\n\nSirius Black (Mentioned only)\n\nFreddie Stroma as Cormac McLaggen\n\nJohn Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick (appearance), voiced by David Coker\n\nGryffindor students[]\n\nKatherine Armitage\n\nBradley Cook\n\nJess Hill\n\nRosalind Knox\n\nMatthew Sharman-Hayles\n\nElliot Smith\n\nHufflepuff students[]\n\nMichael Hindmarsh\n\nMatthew Hodge\n\nAlex Howes\n\nJack Saunders\n\nChelsey Seymour\n\nJoanna Shah\n\nPlayable characters[]\n\nHarry Potter - Set as the main character, Harry can travel around the castle, on the grounds, at the Quidditch Pitch, duel, and mix potions.\n\nRon Weasley - when he is under the love potion sent by Romilda Vane.

In the film, Harry only deflects a few of their spells, and sends a couple of spells back at them, with the aid of Ginny and later with the aid of Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and Arthur Weasley. In the book, the attack on the burrow scene doesn't take place.\n\nIn the game, Harry duels two normal Death Eaters in the castle, Fenrir Greyback in the Clock Tower Courtyard, and Bellatrix Lestrange by Rubeus Hagrid's cabin, which is on fire. In the film, Harry doesn't duel with any of the Death Eaters. He casts two spells at Snape, both of which get deflected, and Bellatrix hits him with a spell. In the book, Harry sends several curses at Snape, all of which get deflected. Snape retaliates with some spells of his own, then he leaves. Some other Death Eaters also attack Harry.\n\nIn the game, the stalls in the bathroom that Harry and Draco duel in have disappeared, leaving a wide open space with urinals on two walls. There is no cover whatsoever, unlike in the film.\n\nAfter Harry takes Felix Felicis, he duels Crabbe and Goyle. During this duel, Crabbe and Goyle cannot hit Harry even when aiming directly at him. He then meets Slughorn in the Herbology greenhouses and brews a Dragon Dung Fertiliser. While brewing this potion, Harry can add as much of each correct ingredient, and boil or stir the potion as much as he likes without causing it to smoke.\n\nSeveral areas were added to the castle, and some were taken away. Areas that were added are the Entrance Gates, the Quidditch Gate, the Quidditch Pitch, the Astronomy Tower, the Training Grounds, Slughorn's office, and a passage in the dungeons that leads to a spiral staircase that goes up to the sixth and seventh floors. Areas that were taken away include the entire Fourth Floor (except the Hospital Wing and the corridor outside of it that leads to the Clock Tower), the Prefect's Bathroom (you can see the door, but you can't go inside), Myrtle Warren's bathroom (replaced with the boys bathroom), the Trophy Room (you can see the door, but can't go in), the North Tower, the DADA Classroom (which is inaccessible) and the Room of Requirement, which is also not accessible.\n\nAs described in the book, whenever Harry goes near the Room of Requirement, a girl drops a scale. In the game, when you do the mission to find Draco on the seventh floor (where you find the Polyjuice Potion recipe), a girl drops scales which can be repaired, broken, levitated, and repulsed.\n\nAll the wands in the game are exact replicas of Harry Potter's wand and all brooms resemble Harry Potter's Firebolt.\n\nIn the game, only a fully charged Protego sends Expelliarmus, Levicorpus, and Petrificus Totalus back, but if it's a non charged Protego the spell is not deflected, and the spell still hits you.\n\nIn the game, if you beat all of the Duelling Clubs, you can fire two Stupefys in one shot, making it easier to stun someone.\n\nIn the game, during Gryffindor's second Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry catches the snitch and Gryffindor wins the match. In the book, Harry is hit in the head with a bludger by McLaggen, causing him to fall from his broom, and for Hufflepuff to win the match.\n\nIf Harry use Levicorpus on Bellatrix or Fenrir Greyback, the effect is not like when Harry casts it on students. Bellatrix and Greyback just fly up, they are not hoisted into the air and dangle upside-down.\n\nThis was the last Harry Potter game released for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable.\n\nThere was a small cutscene where Harry finished making a Shrinking Solution and asked Ginny to go to Hogsmeade which she denied it. During this, you can hear a record screeching sound effect and becomes one of the hilarious transitions in an HP game.\n\nNotes and references[]\n\nJ. K.
