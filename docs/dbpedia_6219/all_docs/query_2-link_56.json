        "text": "The idea is to make a card game with robots. An SD card game if you will. That can fit story or gameplay wise every other theme but the alchemy. I can make the same mechanics with elements and spells and use alchemy, but robots can be just squares and stuff… Drawing people turns out is really hard…\n\nNo, I just did this 2 weeks ago\n\nI need to get in the mindset of progress and finishing stuff.\n\nGame jams are fast, require no polish, just raw he mechanics and design.\n\nAnd I get my name out there, so at the end I will have some kind of audience whenever I finally finish my passion project and decide to sell it…\n\nAh, also it’s fun… Remember that? Fun? I need some. 2018 was a generally shitty year.\n\nPS: also my plan is to participate in jams every now and then so expect a lot more of those topics …\n\nCan I make a potion shop or something?\n\nYou will be like a vendor in an RPG game and you will run the shop for potions.\n\nSomething like recetear but with potions… And much less polished and deeper…\n\nI’ll have to boil a shit load of healing and mana potions, alongside antidotes and stuff…\n\nI have 3 days to finish the thing. I have pretty straight forward plan as to what I want to do.\n\nWhat I need ATM is art and sound.\n\nCan anyone help me with the sound? All I need are 3-4 nice medieval mystery sounding melodies, that would be able to loop without much of a noticeable cut.\n\nArt will be entirely pixel art, so it shouldn’t be that much of an issue to do something by miself. But I need hyouge HYOUGE help with the sound…\n\nRight…\n\nI made some very basic setup of some stuff. It’s 5:30 AM, I need some sleep. When I wake up I will do some more stuff…\n\nThere will be a lot of crunch involved here, since I am doing multiple databases referencing each other and a single digit can kill everything. So that’s that…\n\nOK, the game is chugging along.\n\nThe storefront part is almost done. I will have couple more hours of work on it, and I will move on to potion boiling. That will take some time to do properly.\n\nIf I have time I will try to do a thing where you grow your own herbs and stuff, but I may not have enough time for that. I have 24 hours left to work on it, cause I will be at work after that…\n\nI think I will be finished in time if I skip the herb growing…"
