Just like IGN's Mark Bozon. Now get this: there's a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who might just hold the secret to Lord Voldemort's mysterious past and in turn spotlight a character weakness that Dumbledore and Potter can capitalize on. Meanwhile, Ron, who now looks like a red-headed linebacker, continues to bicker with Hermione as the two of them struggle to define their ever-changing relationship. Harry is the Captain of the Quidditch team. Draco Malfoy might be conspiring with the Death Eaters. And on top of everything else, the Boy Who Lived has come into an extremely handy potions book penned by the Half-Blood Prince. What does it all mean?",
