        "text": "My Harry Potter & the Half Blood Prince PC Game won't work on my new windows 10 laptop, even though it worked well on my old windows 8 laptop. I bought another Harry Potter 6 game CD and the problem is still the same. But, Harry Potter 1, 2, 3 & 7 work perfectly well on my new laptop. Please help as I really love Harry Potter 6 and can't wait to play it again. I am really feeling dejected cause of this. Hence, I have even added a screenshot of the problem.\n\nP.S.: I had downloaded Harry Potter 1, 2 & 3 from the internet. Harry Potter 6 & 7 were bought online.\n\nPlease please please help me with the same.\n\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\n\nIkan\n\nHello all\n\nPersonnaly i've played all harry potter game since two year in windows 10, and .....\n\nEverything runs perfectlys, 4k 60 /fps (at least for harry potter 1 to 4), i've done the 5 on wii, and just try today the 6 on a my pc (980TI / 16gb / windows 10 / i7-5820k) i can't find anyway to bypass the 1600*900 resolution but not a big deal the game work fine, and do 4k when you play in windowed borderless ^^\n\nI know it has been a while but i would be really grateful if you could send me links to whichever HP games you got to work on win10. I was able to get Goblet of Fire and Phoenix to work great with their discs. I have discs for the others but I cant play them. Please and thank you!\n\nCan you please help me to get any of my HP games to work on my Win10 laptop? I have discs for all of the games. I was able to get Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix to work just fine. I would really like to get the Half Blood Prince working. Thank you.\n\n@clarke83ash You have two legal choices: a dual-boot system with both Windows 10 and Windows 7 or a Virtual Machine with Windows 7 installed in it.\n\nMicrosoft blocked the old copy protection drivers in Win10 as it considered those a security risk. That means that any game with SafeDisc, SecuROM, TAGES, StarForce (and pretty much any of the old disc copy protection) will not even install on Win 10. Their solution: rebuy them on GOG (like they are all available there - oh, wait, they are not) or use a less legal method (their words, not mine). MS rendered a fragton CD's and DVD's unplayable.\n\nThe problem with the legal methods is that they are hardware dependent. They would work on an Intel based CPU up to Kaby Lake, while on AMD on anything BEFORE Ryzen. If you have something newer, it will be way harder to use those methods.\n\nI do not work for EA and i am not associated with the company in any way. I am a player just like you, trying to help wherever i can.I will not answer to any unsolicited PM."
