        "text": "VOICE OVER: Riccardo Tucci WRITTEN BY: Matthew Guida\n\nThe world of Harry Potter has led to some pretty magical games! For this list, we'll be taking a look at the video games from the Harry Potter franchise that had the best reception from gamers. Our list includes “Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup” (2003), \"Hogwarts Legacy\" (2023), “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” (2002), and more!\n\nWelcome to MojoPlays! Today we’re looking at the 10 Best Harry Potter Video Games. For this list, we'll be taking a look at the video games from the Harry Potter franchise that had the best reception from gamers. As most reviews per game vary depending on the platform, we will be taking into account the rating difference between platforms, the highest ratings awarded, as well as accolades and accomplishments for each game. Which of Harry’s mystical misadventures did you enjoy playing the most? Let us know in the comments below.\n\n“Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells” (2020)\n\nWhile puzzle solving is a frequent theme in most “Harry Potter\" games, this entry takes it to a whole new level. Combining the concept of match-three puzzles with elements of the Harry Potter mythos, this award-winning mobile game features more than a thousand puzzles filled to the brim with magical mayhem and fun, as well as obstacles such as magic slugs, dragons and even chocolate frogs. Along with receiving the occasional support from iconic “Harry Potter” characters, the game also features in-game clubs where players can either compete against or collaborate with each other. With its addicting gameplay and references to Wizarding World lore, it’s no wonder that most muggles find this game so popular.\n\n“Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” (2009)\n\nWhile this game’s handheld versions failed to impress, the PC and console ones were pretty decent. Among the many highlights of “Half-Blood Prince”, one of the best is being able to explore Hogwarts castle, allowing players to visit iconic locations, interact with familiar characters, as well as collect hidden Hogwarts crests. There are also plenty of side quests and mini-games to enjoy such as playing Quidditch, brewing potions, and even wizard duels. The latter is especially entertaining thanks to the game's new and improved dueling system, complete with an arsenal of spells guaranteed to leave enemies stupefied. Despite only briefly touching upon key moments from the source material, this game is still loads of fun to play, especially for true Harry Potter fans.\n\n“Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” (2007)\n\nWhen it comes to the “Order of the Phoenix” video game, the developers at EA UK really went all out to provide fans with a truly immersive experience. As a sandbox game, “Order of the Phoenix” gives players unparalleled freedom to move and explore Hogwarts castle, which is made even better thanks to the immense level of detail that went into the game’s design. An achievement made possible by combining descriptions from the novel, blueprints from the titular film, as well as input from Harry Potter creator, J.K. Rowling. While the game may have had its flaws, like its dueling system, it's overshadowed by its ability to immerse fans into the “Harry Potter” universe in a way that prior titles failed to achieve.\n\n“Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup” (2003)\n\nUnlike other “Harry Potter\" video games, “Quidditch World Cup” deviates from the traditional puzzle-adventure formula to focus exclusively on the Wizarding World’s favorite pastime. Receiving mixed to positive reviews, “Quidditch World Cup” provides a more in-depth look into the world of Quidditch through fun and dynamic gameplay. Instead of focusing on just Harry, players can also control other Quidditch players, and even play on any of the four Hogwarts house teams, including Slytherin. But wait, there’s more, after completing the Hogwarts stage, players move on to the Quidditch World Cup, where they can choose to play as one of many international teams. With amazing graphics for its time, “Quidditch World Cup\" provides a much needed and enjoyable change of pace from other Harry Potter games.\n\n“Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire” (2005)\n\nKnown for possessing unique elements not seen in prior titles, the gameplay for “Goblet of Fire” focuses more on action than puzzle solving or exploration. Along with being the first “Harry Potter” game to feature a multiplayer mode, “Goblet of Fire” also has replayable levels and a combat system where players assume control of either Harry, Ron or Hermione and fight off hordes of magical monsters and enemies. There is even a group casting feature where the trio can combine their magic to clear obstacles or increase their spell power, and can be accessed either alone or with friends. Additional highlights include the Triwizard Tournament trials where players must overcome intense challenges such as outflying an angry dragon and fighting swarms of underwater monsters.\n\n“Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone” (2001)\n\nAlso known as “the Sorcerer’s Stone” in the U.S., this puzzle adventure game is famous for being one of the best selling video games of all time. Released across multiple platforms, each version of the “Philosopher’s Stone” was created by a different developer, resulting in different styles of gameplay, graphics, as well as level structure. Overall, the game received plenty of mixed reviews across its many platforms regarding its graphics, gameplay, as well as voice acting. The latter of which was well praised. Despite its flaws, “Philosopher’s Stone” still had quite an appeal over fans. The PlayStation version alone was so popular that it sold more than 8 million copies, rendering it a classic among PlayStation’s greatest hits.\n\n“Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban” (2004)\n\nRegardless of age, all “Harry Potter” fans are bound to enjoy playing “Prisoner of Azkaban.” Overall, it generated mostly positive reviews, especially the PS2 and GBA versions. The latter of which featured a unique turn based RPG, similar to its predecessors. All versions of the “Prisoner of Azkaban” also benefited from a groundbreaking new co-op feature where players can switch between Harry, Ron or Hermione. Each character possesses their own unique set of skills and spells that help with solving the game's many puzzles and challenges. Whether it's the game's co-op mode, fighting Dementors, or even the ability to fly on everyone’s favorite Hippogriff, there are plenty of reasons why this game ranks as highly as it does.\n\n“Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” (2002)\n\nThey say that sequels are never as good as the originals. However, “Chamber of Secrets” is one of the few to prove otherwise. Released across multiple platforms, the game was especially popular on the sixth generation consoles which featured improved graphics and the addition of new gaming mechanics such as free-flight mode. The game also has plenty of fun side quests and mini games such as Quidditch, as well as some good old-fashioned gnome tossing. Yet nothing compares to the final epic battle against the deadly Basilisk. Overall, the game received positive reviews and also sold nine million copies across all platforms by 2003, leading many fans to recognize it as one of the best video games in the “Harry Potter” franchise.\n\n“Lego Harry Potter Collection” (2016)\n\nInitially released on the PS4, the “Lego Harry Potter Collection” features the remastered versions of the “Lego Harry Potter” games, following Harry and his adventures through years one through four and years five through seven respectively. With gameplay similar to other Lego games, players collect Lego bricks while exploring various locations throughout the Wizarding World, as well as solve puzzles, learn new spells and even build and customize their surroundings. In the end, both games exceeded expectations, earning very positive reviews. The first game was especially successful, with most reviews claiming it was one of the best “Harry Potter\" video games ever made. Not surprising considering some of the game’s rather impressive looking boss fights.\n\n\"Hogwarts Legacy\" (2023)\n\nWith the release of this long awaited title, “Harry Potter” fans can finally enjoy an original Hogwarts student experience. Unlike previous titles, “Hogwarts Legacy\" is set in the 1890s and allows players to create and customize their own protagonist, as well as choose their Hogwarts house. With its captivating open world gameplay, players are free to explore Hogwarts and other magical locations, ride on brooms and magical beasts, as well as interact with fun new characters. The game’s combat system has also been generously praised as players can duel against all manner of magical foes while casting powerful spell combos. With the potential to do great things, both good and evil alike, there’s plenty of fun to be had in the bewitching world of “Hogwarts Legacy”."
