        "text": "24 2 9\n\nSince I also made a review of the last Harry Potter game, I will try to judge this one.\n\nThe Graphics\n\nNot a new benchmark for any system, but they get you in the right 'Hogwarts mood' for sure!\n\nThere is better lighting than in the last game.\n\nFacial animations can look a bit weird.\n\nSomething ugly tho is when you look down from a high place (Stone Circle, Owlery), you see that there is only one line of trees in the forest; the rest looks like some kind of sludge.\n\nCome on, a bit more effort would be nice!\n\nSpells look ok.\n\nBut sometimes it can look a bit... dull (outside). Grass and trees don't look good; there isn't any rain/wind or even an bright sun.\n\nA day/night cycle is also absent.\n\nSound\n\nIt's Harry Potter, so the music is instantly great. [king]\n\nVoiceacting... Damn, what did they do? Snape is by far the most afwul sounding character. I think the 'voice-doubles' for the real actors did a much better job in OotP than this year.\n\nAlso; the lines from the students that just roam Hogwarts get repetitive really quickly. For some reason it seems they have LESS lines than in OotP.\n\nEven the portraits sound a bit... off.\n\nGameplay\n\nWell...They made improvements. They added new areas and new minigames...\n\nSo; the improvements:\n\nCamera control, you can now freely control the camera by holding the RT button.\n\nDuels are a bit more intuitive.\n\nNight missions for some more variety.\n\nThe added areas are:\n\nQuidditch gate\n\nTraining Grounds\n\nThe road from the main gates to Hagrid's hut\n\nSlughorn's office\n\nAstronomy Tower\n\nNew minigames\n\nPotions making\n\nQuidditch\n\nDuelling\n\nWell, that all sounds good, but:\n\nThere are less spells! (only 3)\n\nThere is no Myrtle's or Prefects Bathroom. You can't go beyond Hagrid's Hut anymore. No more Room of Requirement. There still are locked doors. etc.\n\nYou can't talk to random students anymore (not that they had much to tell, but I still liked it)\n\nRon and Hermione don't keep following you anymore. I actually miss that. It feels much more empty now.\n\nNo more Chess.\n\nNo more Exploding Snaps\n\nNo more Gobstones\n\nThere is no way of choosing your preferred language.\n\nMuch less objects to screw around with.\n\nA lot of invisible walls.\n\nNo more Charms lessons.\n\nOr teacher mini quests\n\nNo more Marauders Map. (there now is Nearly Headless Nick to guide you around, but no static map). I liked the Marauders map more.\n\nHarry still controls clunky\n\nHarry can't climb anymore\n\nNo references to previous books/games/movies\n\nQuidditch is just a 'Fly through the hoops' mini-game\n\netc.\n\nDiscovery\n\nThere are less portrait shortcuts.\n\nYou don't even have to solve a riddle to get their password. They just give it to you.\n\nThe biggest part is collecting crests, wich is far less fun than the discovery system in the previous game.\n\nThere are 3 ways to get crests:\n\n1. By collecting mini crests. You do that by casting 'Depulso' on a glowing object. Mini crests fall out, and you pick them up. At every ~1000 you will get a regular crest.\n\n2. By getting them off walls. They are not very well hidden.\n\nEven if you can't find it, just look for something you can pick up with Wingardium Leviosa; that means there is a crest nearby.\n\nPick up the object - throw it at the crest. (only a few you can get by doing something else)\n\n3. And then there are the 'Lion quests' it doesn't even deserve the name quest tho. There is a student wich needs your help. That means either duelling a Slytherin or making them a potion.\n\nSo OotP had a more diverse and fun way of discovering everything.\n\nThis gets tedious very fast.\n\nStory\n\nVERY short. (4/5 hours) With afwul cutscenes.\n\nAnd if you haven't read the book you will more than likely go 'W T F!' at some moments. It just isn't explained very well.\n\nBut; that's all I am going to say about it. Wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone.\n\nReplayability\n\nThe story is +/- 4/5 hours. But after that you gan go and find every hidden crest (125) and go and play the mini games.\n\nIt depends on how much you like Harry Potter. I love it, so I am well over 10 hours play time now.\n\nMost people won't get that far. It just isn't that interesting to do.\n\nConclusion\n\nWell, there is much to complain about. They made a few improvements, but all in all the game is worse than te last one.\n\nI am actually really angry now, because it had so much potential and a good basis to build upon, and THIS is wat we get?\n\nA less fun game with less to do? It's worse in almost every department.\n\nLet's end with the Achievements:\n\nThey are easy.\n\nJust until the last few ones, wich can need a bid practise. But still very doable.\n\nYou have achievements for\n\nStory\n\nFinding crests\n\nMinigames\n\nThe achievements aren't very creative, but they get the job done. Not bad. Not good.\n\nSo:\n\n4/5 stars. Just because I love the franchise. But hey, I am the one reviewing it\n\nSee the summary for my advice.\n\n4.0\n\n9 1 5\n\nHarry Potter and The Half Blood Prince\n\nIf you played the last game in the series then playing HBP will come just as easy. If you are picking the game up for the first time then it will flow just the same after just a few minutes of playing the game. The opening moments of the game do a great job of walking you through the basics. Once you have them mastered, you are set for the rest of the game.\n\nAfter playing OOTP and then coming to HBP I noticed a great change in graphics. Half Blood Prince steps it up a tad and brings us better eye candy (graphic wise).\n\nAlong with the graphics you are going to notice a big change in Hogwarts itself. The castle is pretty much the same, give or take some new portrait shortcuts. What has really changed since the previous game is the outside of Hogwarts. You'll see more in depth level design as you fall, it would seem, into the books and movies themselves.\n\nAside from the enhanced graphics and new design, the gameplay is overall the same. You are running around Hogwarts preforming miscellaneous tasks for friends, teachers, and yourself. The leveling feature makes its return but with a different style. Instead of \"tidying up\" Hogwarts, you are collecting Crests. Collect enough of these tedious things and you level up.\n\nFlying, Potion Making, and Dueling make a appearance in the game as well. Doing these tasks will flow naturally after only one or two times of trying and will loose their fun quickly and instead turn into a chore working towards your achievements.\n\nOn that note the achievements in this game are very simple. On a scale of 1-10 the achievements stand at a 2. Perhaps even a 1 if you played the last game in the series.\n\nIn all, Harry Potter fan or not, this game is a rent. I say this because the story is extremely short and you can be done with it in a days time whether you are only playing for the story, or playing for the achievements.\n\nThank you all for reading. This has been my first review. It isn't as great as I'd hoped, but they will improve with time.\n\n4.0"
