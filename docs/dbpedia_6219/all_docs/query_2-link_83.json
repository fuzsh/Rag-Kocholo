        "text": "Professor Cuthbert Binns\n\nThe only ghost teaching at Hogwarts – he died in his sleep one day years ago, didn’t notice and just carried on turning up to take his lessons.\n\nThe students wish he hadn’t, though: he’s legendarily dull, making his History Of Magic lessons a war of attrition. The only excitement in his classroom is when he drifts in through the blackboard.\n\nDad’s Army’s Private Godfrey would have been perfect for the role. And he’s dead – that’s Method for you.\n\nPeeves The Poltergeist\n\nPesky prankster Peeves is an anarchic poltergeist whose only goal is to create chaos. His sworn enemy is Argus Filch, the school caretaker, who has to clear up after him.\n\nRumours that he could be the ghost of Jeremy Beadle remain unfounded. Rik Mayall did film a scene as Peeves for Philosopher’s Stone , but it got chopped.\n\nBorgin & Burke's\n\nTenpole Tudor front man (and Crystal Maze presenter) Ed Tudor Pole filmed a scene as Mr Borgin – proprietor of the shop in Knockturn Alley that buys and sells objects of dark magic and other dangerous artefacts – for Chamber Of Secrets , but it was cut.\n\nDespite the character appearing in the book of Half-Blood Prince, there’s no sign of Mr Tudor in the cast list. Time for that Tenpole reunion tour, perhaps?\n\nSir Patrick Delaney-Podmore\n\nThis deceased Sir is the head of the Headless Hunt – a group for spirits that has a zero-tolerance entrance requirement: you’re barred if your head isn’t completely cleaved from your body. Such rules are much to the annoyance of Hogwarts spook Nearly Headless Nick (John Cleese in the film), whose bouncing bonce clings on by a single sinew.\n\nThe Origins Of The Marauder's Map\n\nIf you’ve never read the book, the magic map given to Harry in Prisoner Of Azkaban seems to have ‘lazy plot device’ written all over it.\n\nIn fact, what it actually had written all over it is ‘Messrs Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs’, which is a clue as to its origins and a whole subplot about Harry’s dad, Sirius Black and the other map creators being animagii – those with the ability to turn into animals.\n\nSpew\n\nBy Goblet Of Fire, huge swathes of the novels had to be ejected, but few mourned the loss of a subplot that would have seen the return of irritating house elf Dobby.\n\nHermione forms SPEW – Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare – to champion the rights of house elves. She’s spurred on by the maltreatment of Winky, a female house elf who became an alcoholic.\n\nRon's Quidditch Exploits\n\nQuidditch was a casualty in Order Of The Phoenix. An entire comedy subplot about Ron becoming the unlikely Keeper in the Gryffindor Quidditch team was completely excised, to the disappointment of Rupert Grint, who’d been looking forward to some broom action.\n\nThis meant we were also sadly robbed of the Slytherins’ dubious terrace chant: “Weasley cannot save a thing, He can’t block a single ring.”\n\nLudo Bagman\n\nA smooth-talking rogue who manages to charm his way into the role of Minister of Magical Games and Sports. He’s in charge of the Quidditch World Cup and even commentates on the matches.\n\nA gambling man who owes a lot of gold to some Goblins, he bets on Harry to win the TriWizard Tournament then uses his influence to try and fix the result.\n\nQuidditch World Cup\n\nThe Quidditch World Cup is a major set-piece that chews up a massive chunk of Goblet Of Fire, with a succession of matches leading to a spectacular final between Ireland and Bulgaria.\n\nIn the film we get an opening ceremony, a bit of scarf waving and a jarring jump cut. OK, it’s not essential to the plot, but the lack of any Quidditch action after all the build-up (and the stunning stadium) is a gaping absence in the film.\n\nShame. The Apprentice’s Nick Hewer could have done a great cameo as the ref.\n\nMarietta Edgecombe\n\nDirty rotten sneak Marietta is the grass who betrays Harry’s secret army to Hogwarts headmistress Dolores Umbridge. Daringly in the film, this betrayal is given instead to Harry’s girlfriend Cho, which is much more dramatically satisfying.\n\nSadly, Cho doesn’t share the unfortunate fate of the book’s traitor: a vengeful Hermione jinxes her so that her forehead erupts with zits spelling out 'SNEAK’.\n\nPercy Weasley: Traitor\n\nIn the film, elder Weasley sprog Percy – now working for the Ministry of Magic – comes across as a slimy yes-man. In the books he’s an all-out traitor, disowning his family and sending Christmas presents back unopened.\n\nThe film could have run with the idea of Percy going really evil – fiddling his expenses and claiming on a second Gnome or something.\n\nKreacher's Hoarding\n\nAged house elf Kreacher would have been a no-brainer to cut from the fifth film, but JK Rowling herself insisted on his appearance.\n\nBut his role was snipped to a virtual cameo, wandering around the Order Of The Phoenix ’s HQ (Sirius Black’s family home) grumbling and cursing.\n\nIn the book, the sour creature has a major role to play in betraying Sirius to the Malfoys. A big plot point about him hoarding old Black family heirlooms was left out, but will have to be addressed at some point in the film series..."
