        "text": "Should Hogwarts Legacy capture your attention, numerous comparable games stand ready to further enchant you.\n\nHogwarts Legacy is an immersive, open-world, action role-playing game set in the world first introduced in the Harry Potter books. Now you can take control of your destiny in a brand new wizarding world adventure that puts you at the center of your own story. The game is set in the 1800s, which means you'll explore Hogwarts and its surrounding areas in a time before Harry and friends ever set foot there. As a student, you can choose your house, attend classes, build relationships, and of course, master powerful magic. The more you play, the more you'll notice this isn't just a fresh coat of paint on a familiar location - it's an entirely new narrative within a beloved and richly constructed universe.\n\nIf you're a fan of role-playing games and the Wizarding World, you'll likely find similar enjoyment in other titles. Games like the Witcher series, where you'll also venture into an extensive world filled with magic, intrigue, and complex characters. Or maybe you'd delight in something like the towering landscapes and immersive lore of the Elder Scrolls series. Perhaps titles with emphasis on choice and morality that affects the narrative, like in the Mass Effect series, would capture your attention. These games, among many others, could offer you a range of experiences as nuanced and engaging as Hogwarts Legacy promises to be. But wait, there's actually a more comprehensive list of recommendations, carefully tailored to align closely with...\n\nNote: I may earn a commission from purchases through links in this article, but the price is the same.\n\n25. Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery\n\nIf you're a fan of Hogwarts Legacy, you'll find a lot to love in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery. Just like Hogwarts Legacy, Hogwarts Mystery invites you on a thrilling journey through the enchanted halls of Hogwarts. You can cast spells, brew potions, and forge friendships or rivalries just as you would in Legacy, but here's the kicker: You're the one choosing how your magical adventure unfolds! You have the freedom to choose your own house, select your friends, and even decide how you want to respond in critical situations, adding an exciting element of personal strategy and decision-making that mirrors the choices you make in Legacy.\n\nWhat sets Hogwarts Mystery apart and yet keeps it on the same magical wavelength as Hogwarts Legacy is the time setting. Unlike Hogwarts Legacy which is set in the 17th century, Hogwarts Mystery takes place right after Harry Potter's birth, meaning you get an enriching variety of character interactions with younger versions of characters you've been familiar with in Legacy, making for an exhilarating twist. This setting shift allows for unique story-telling possibilities which give depth and new perspectives to the cherished Wizarding World we have come to love in both games.\n\nHarry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery is available on iOS and Android devices, typically priced around $0 USD as it's a free-to-play game with optional in-app purchases.\n\nMain Site\n\n24. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix game shares a lot of similarities with Hogwarts Legacy in that they both represent the enchanting world of Hogwarts in an interactive experience. You get to roam around Hogwarts, interact with the characters, participate in lessons, and even play Quidditch, which should definitely pique your interest if you liked the open-world aspect of Hogwarts Legacy. Both games also lean heavily into the role-playing aspect where you get to be a student at Hogwarts, completing daily tasks, brewing potions, learning spells and charms and solving mysteries, just like in Hogwarts Legacy.\n\nThe aspect of storytelling is also shared between the two games. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, you play through the events of the fifth book, which is an exceptional experience, especially for those who admire J.K. Rowling's storytelling. On the other hand, in Hogwarts Legacy you explore an original narrative set in the 1800s which still holds the same Hogwarts charm. You'll come across elements that tie back to the Harry Potter series, just like how Hogwarts Legacy integrated items and spells from the original books, making it a treat for any Harry Potter fan.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is available on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PC, and PSP, typically priced around $20 USD.\n\n$23 from Amazon\n\n23. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nHogwarts Legacy and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince share a compelling, familiar world brimming with magic, mystery, and adventure — the extraordinary universe of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Much like Hogwarts Legacy, Half-Blood Prince greatly emphasizes exploration throughout Hogwarts. This provides a fan-pleasing dive into the deeper, previously unseen corners of the wizarding school. The game is not strictly linear, as side quests and optional activities like potion brewing, Quidditch, and dueling add layers of depth to the gameplay. You very much forge your own path through these activities, similar to the free-roaming experience of Hogwarts Legacy.\n\nThe strong narrative thread in the Half-Blood Prince will appeal to you if you enjoyed the engaging story-driven aspects of Hogwarts Legacy. The game follows the story of the sixth book and film closely, with thrilling puzzles and battles intertwined with the unfolding plot. One key point that sets it apart is the inclusion of iconic characters from the series, allowing you to interact with beloved figures like Dumbledore and Snape, recreating a narrative experience that is on par with Hogwarts Legacy's immersive storytelling.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is available on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, and PC, typically priced around $20 USD.\n\n$23 from Amazon\n\n22.

Deathly Hallows - Part 1 lets you step into Harry's shoes and experience first-hand the thrilling story as you venture to defeat Voldemort, which is not dissimilar to the epic journey you undertook in Hogwarts Legacy.\n\nThe gameplay of Deathly Hallows - Part 1 is pretty unique in its style, but if you liked the spellcasting and exploration aspect of Hogwarts Legacy, you'll truly appreciate the mechanics in this game. In Deathly Hallows - Part 1, as Harry, you'll have a variety of spells at your disposal - much like in Legacy; you will also explore dynamic environments and engage in battles with Death Eaters and Snatchers. The attention to detail in the game's visual representation of these fantastical locations, creatures and magic, paired with its immersive storyline, is remarkably similar to what you experienced in Hogwarts Legacy, hence making the transition between games quite smooth.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 is available on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, and Microsoft Windows, typically priced around $20 USD.\n\n$44 from Amazon\n\n21. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 is incredibly similar to Hogwarts Legacy, offering a familiar and deeply immersive experience. Just as in the Hogwarts Legacy game where the story progresses based on your choices and actions, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, you get the chance to shape the narrative, encountering familiar faces and exploring well-known locations. You also get to participate in epic battles, solve riddles and embark on thrilling quests, just like how Hogwarts Legacy captivated you with its engaging gameplay elements.\n\nBesides, a shared sense of magical immersion is evident in both games.

That means casting spells and successfully sneaking around will gradually make you better at those activities. Not to mention, Skyrim also offers a myriad of quests and side missions that involve solving puzzles, negotiating with NPCs and often moral choices - much like the challenges you faced in Hogwarts Legacy.

Dark Souls III\n\nBoth Dark Souls III and Hogwarts Legacy are games that offer richly detailed and immersive worlds, full of atmospheric locations to explore and secrets to uncover. Just like in Hogwarts Legacy where every corner of the Hogwarts school and its surroundings is filled with mysteries and magic, Dark Souls III presents its medieval fantasy world in a way that requires careful exploration and encourages discovery.

In Hogwarts Legacy, you seek to improve your magical abilities and brew various potions to take down foes and solve puzzles.

You can choose from a wide array of weapons, spells, and equipment, and develop your skills as you toughen your way through hordes of intimidating adversaries.
