The actor has been a strong advocate for the people of Ukraine during their ongoing war with Russia.\n\n\"The Oscars producer thought, ‘Oh, he’s [Zelenskyy] not light-hearted enough.’ Well, guess what you got instead? Will Smith,\" Penn told Variety. The outlet noted that the \"Milk\" actor was visibly infuriated speaking on the subject, even turning red during the interview.\n\n'EMANCIPATION'S' WILL SMITH ADMITS HE 'LOST IT' DURING CHRIS ROCK OSCAR SLAP, WAS FULL OF 'RAGE'\n\n\"I don’t know Will Smith. I met him once,\" Penn said. \"He seemed very nice when I met him. He was so f---ing good in ‘King Richard.'\"\n\n\"So why the f--- did you just spit on yourself and everybody else with this stupid f---ing thing? Why did I go to f---ing jail for what you just did? And you’re still sitting there? Why are you guys standing and applauding his worst moment as a person?\" the 63-year-old said, referencing his 1987 arrest and jail stint for punching a film extra in the face.\n\nRepresentatives for Smith did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
