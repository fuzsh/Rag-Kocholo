The brother of Sean Penn was 43.\n\nNo details on the cause of death, not even a cursory nod to his IMDb profile...odd. We'll post the details when they become available.\n\nUPDATE: The original AP story has changed and been updated ( here's another link), and the KABC website has apparently changed the story from the AP to their own."
