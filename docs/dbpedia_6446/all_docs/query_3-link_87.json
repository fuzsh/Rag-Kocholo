        "text": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Penn\n\nSean Justin Penn (born August 17, 1960) is an American film actor and director, also known for his political activism. He is a two-time Academy Award winner for his roles in Mystic River and Milk, as well as the recipient of a Golden Globe Award for the former and a Screen Actors Guild Award for the latter.\n\nEarly life\n\nPenn was born in Los Angeles County, California,[1] the son of actor and director Leo Penn and Eileen Ryan (née Annucci), an actress. He has one living brother, musician Michael Penn. Another brother, actor Chris Penn, died in 2006. His paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Russia,[2][3][4] while his mother is a Catholic of Italian and Irish descent.[4] According to Penn's mother, Leo Penn may have had distant Spanish ancestry, as his family's surname was originally \"Piñón\".[4] Penn was raised in a secular home[2] and is an agnostic.[5] He attended Santa Monica High School.[6]\n\nActing career\n\nPenn appeared in a 1974 episode of the Little House on the Prairie television series as a then blond-haired extra when his father, Leo, directed some of the episodes.\n\nPenn launched his film career with the 1981 film Taps, where he played a key role as a military high school cadet opposite protagonist Timothy Hutton. Tom Cruise also made one of his first film appearances as another cadet in the action-drama. A year later, he appeared in the hit comedy Fast Times at Ridgemont High (in the role of surfer-stoner Jeff Spicoli). In 1983, Penn turned in one of his best early performances as Mick O'Brien, a troubled youth in the drama Bad Boys. It earned Penn favorable reviews and jump started his career as a serious actor.\n\nIn 1985, Penn gave a memorable performance in the role of Andrew Daulton Lee in The Falcon and the Snowman, which closely followed an actual criminal case. Lee was a former drug dealer by trade, convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union and was originally sentenced to life in prison. Lee was paroled in 1998. In an interview for The Guardian in April, 2005, it was stated that Penn later hired Lee as his personal assistant, partly because he wanted to reward Lee for allowing him to play Lee in the film, and also because he was a firm believer in rehabilitation and thought Andrew Lee should be successfully reintegrated into society since he was a free man again.[7]\n\nIn 1986 he starred in the drama At Close Range, opposite Christopher Walken. The film featured his then wife Madonna's single \"Live to Tell\". The music video for the song, which featured clips from the film, played heavily on MTV and helped promote the film.\n\nAt the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.Penn, nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor five times, has won the award twice. The academy first recognized his work playing a racist murderer on death row in Tim Robbins' 1995 drama Dead Man Walking. Penn was noted in 1999 for his comedic performance as an egotistical jazz guitarist in Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown. He received his third nomination in 2001 after portraying a mentally-handicapped father in I am Sam. In 2003, Penn finally won for his role in Clint Eastwood's Boston crime-drama Mystic River. In 2004, he played a disturbed man bent on killing the president in The Assassination of Richard Nixon. He received his fifth nomination and second win for his role as the charismatic and vibrant gay politician Harvey Milk in the 2008 film Milk. He was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2004.[8]\n\nIn 2006 he portrayed populist governor Willie Stark (based on Huey Long) in an adaptation of the classic American novel All the King's Men, though the film was a critical and commercial failure. In November 2008, Penn earned rave reviews for his portrayal of real-life gay-rights icon and politician Harvey Milk in the biopic Milk and was nominated for best actor for the 2008 Independent Spirit Awards.[9]\n\nDirector\n\nIn 1991, Penn made his directorial debut with The Indian Runner, a film based on Bruce Springsteen's song \"Highway Patrolman\" from the Nebraska album. He also directed music videos, such as Shania Twain's \"Dance with the One That Brought You\" in 1993 and Peter Gabriel's \"The Barry Williams Show\" in 2002. He has since directed three more films, all of which were well-received by critics: The Crossing Guard in 1995, The Pledge in 2001, and Into the Wild in 2007.\n\nPersonal life\n\nPenn was supposedly engaged to actress Elizabeth McGovern, his co-star in 1984's Racing with the Moon, after which he dated Susan Sarandon. Penn's personal life began to attract media attention when he married pop star Madonna in 1985. The relationship was marred by violent outbursts against the press, including one incident for which he was arrested for assaulting a photographer on a film set; Penn was sentenced to 60 days in jail in mid-1987, of which he served 33 days.[10] It is also alleged that when Penn discovered the paparazzo in his hotel room, he hung him by his ankles from the ninth-floor balcony.[11] Madonna dedicated her third studio album True Blue to Penn, referring to him in the liner notes as \"the coolest guy in the universe\". Later in the marriage, Penn was charged with felony domestic assault, a charge for which he pleaded to a misdemeanor. Penn and Madonna divorced in 1989.\n\nHe soon began a relationship with Robin Wright, and their first child – a daughter named Dylan Frances – was born in 1991. Their second child, a son whom they named Hopper Jack, was born in 1993. Penn and Wright married in 1996 and lived in Ross, California. The relationship went through on-and-off periods in the late 2000s. The couple filed for divorce in December 2007, but reconciled several months later, requesting a court dismissal of their divorce case.[12] In April 2009, Penn filed for legal separation, only to withdraw the case once again when the couple reconciled in May.[13][14][15] On August 12, 2009, Wright Penn filed for divorce again,[16] declaring that she had no plans to reconcile this time.[17] The couple's divorce was finalized on July 22, 2010, with the couple reaching a private agreement on child and spousal support, division of assets, and custody over their underage son.[18]\n\nDuring a separation from Wright in the mid 1990s, Penn dated singer and songwriter Jewel. He was also the director of the original video for Jewel's hit song \"You Were Meant for Me\".[19]\n\nRecently, Penn has been linked with model Jessica White.[20]\n\nPenn's younger brother, Chris, died from an enlarged heart in his Santa Monica condominium on January 24, 2006.[11]\n\nAlong with Johnny Depp, Mick Hucknall, and John Malkovich, Penn was a part-owner of the Parisian restaurant-bar Man Ray.[19]\n\nPolitical and social causes\n\nPenn has been active in supporting several political and social causes. On June 10, 2005, Penn made a visit to Iran. Acting as a journalist on an assignment for the San Francisco Chronicle, he attended a Friday prayer at Tehran University.[21]\n\nOn January 7, 2006, Penn was a special guest at the Progressive Democrats of America, where he was joined by author and media critic Norman Solomon, Democratic congressional candidate Charles Brown, and activist Cindy Sheehan. The \"Out of Iraq Forum\", which took place in Sacramento, California, was organized to promote the anti-war movement calling for an end to the War in Iraq.\n\nIn August 2008, Penn made an appearance at one of Ralph Nader's \"Open the Debates\" Super Rallies. He protested the political exclusion of Nader and other third parties.[22]\n\nIn October 2008, Penn traveled to Cuba, where he met with and interviewed President Raúl Castro.[23]\n\nCriticism of President Bush\n\nPenn at an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C.On October 18, 2002, Penn placed a US$56,000 advertisement in the Washington Post asking then President George W. Bush to end a cycle of violence. It was written as an open letter and referred to the planned attack on Iraq and the War on Terror.[24] In the letter, Penn also criticized the Bush administration for its \"deconstruction of civil liberties\" and its \"simplistic and inflammatory view of good and evil.\"[25] Penn visited Iran briefly in December 2002.[24]\n\nThis advertisement was cited as a primary reason for the development of his relationship with Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez. In one of his televised speeches, Chávez used and read aloud an open letter Penn wrote to Bush.[11] The letter condemned the Iraq War, called for Bush to be impeached, and also called Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \"villainously and criminally obscene people.\".[26] In August 2007, Penn met with Chávez in Caracas for two hours, after which Chávez praised him for urging Americans to impeach Bush. Penn also visited a new film studio on the outskirts of Caracas, though he did not speak publicly.[26]\n\nOn April 19, 2007, Penn appeared on The Colbert Report and had a \"Meta-Free-Phor-All\" versus Stephen Colbert that was judged by Robert Pinsky. This stemmed from some of Penn's criticisms of Bush. His exact quote was \"We cower as you point your fingers telling us to support our troops. You and the smarmy pundits in your pocket– those who bathe in the moisture of your soiled and blood-soaked underwear– can take that noise and shove it.\"[27][28] He won the contest with 10,000,000 points to Colbert's 1.[29]\n\nOn December 7, 2007, Penn said he supported Ohio Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich for U.S. President in 2008, and criticized Bush's handling of the Iraq war. Penn questioned whether Bush's twin daughters supported the war in Iraq.[30]\n\nHurricane Katrina\n\nIn September 2005, Penn traveled to New Orleans, Louisiana, to aid Hurricane Katrina victims. He was physically involved in rescuing people,[31] although there was criticism that his involvement was a PR stunt as he hired a photographer to come along with his entourage.[32]\n\nDirector Spike Lee interviewed Penn for his documentary When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts, about Hurricane Katrina.\n\nLGBT Civil Rights\n\nOn February 22, 2009, Penn received the Best Actor Academy Award for the film Milk. In his acceptance speech, Penn said \"...I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that way of support. We've got to have equal rights for everyone!\"[33]\n\nHaitian Earthquake: Manager of Relief Organization and Tent Camp\n\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Sean Penn co-founded the J/P Haitian Relief Organization and has been running a 55,000 person tent camp.[34]\n\nFilmography and awards\n\nOn December 18, 2006, Penn received the Christopher Reeve First Amendment Award from the Creative Coalition.[35]\n\nActor\n\nYear Film Role Notes\n\n1981 Taps Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer film debut\n\n1982 Fast Times at Ridgemont High Jeff Spicoli\n\n1983 Summerspell Buddy\n\nBad Boys Michael O'Brien\n\n1984 Crackers Dillard\n\nRacing with the Moon Henry 'Hopper' Nash/Lou\n\n1985 The Falcon and the Snowman Daulton Lee\n\n1986 At Close Range Brad Whitewood Jr.\n\nShanghai Surprise Glendon Wasey\n\n1987 Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam Narrator\n\n1988 Cool Blue Phil the Plumber uncredited[36]\n\nColors Officer Danny McGavin\n\nJudgment in Berlin Guenther X\n\n1989 Casualties of War Sgt.

He is a two-time Academy Award winner for his roles in Mystic River and Milk, as well as the recipient of a Golden Globe Award for the former and a Screen Actors Guild Award for the latter.\n\nEarly life\n\nPenn was born in Los Angeles County, California,[1] the son of actor and director Leo Penn and Eileen Ryan (née Annucci), an actress. He has one living brother, musician Michael Penn. Another brother, actor Chris Penn, died in 2006. His paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Russia,[2][3][4] while his mother is a Catholic of Italian and Irish descent.[4] According to Penn's mother, Leo Penn may have had distant Spanish ancestry, as his family's surname was originally \"Piñón\".[4] Penn was raised in a secular home[2] and is an agnostic.[5] He attended Santa Monica High School.[6]\n\nActing career\n\nPenn appeared in a 1974 episode of the Little House on the Prairie television series as a then blond-haired extra when his father, Leo, directed some of the episodes.\n\nPenn launched his film career with the 1981 film Taps, where he played a key role as a military high school cadet opposite protagonist Timothy Hutton. Tom Cruise also made one of his first film appearances as another cadet in the action-drama. A year later, he appeared in the hit comedy Fast Times at Ridgemont High (in the role of surfer-stoner Jeff Spicoli). In 1983, Penn turned in one of his best early performances as Mick O'Brien, a troubled youth in the drama Bad Boys. It earned Penn favorable reviews and jump started his career as a serious actor.\n\nIn 1985, Penn gave a memorable performance in the role of Andrew Daulton Lee in The Falcon and the Snowman, which closely followed an actual criminal case. Lee was a former drug dealer by trade, convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union and was originally sentenced to life in prison. Lee was paroled in 1998. In an interview for The Guardian in April, 2005, it was stated that Penn later hired Lee as his personal assistant, partly because he wanted to reward Lee for allowing him to play Lee in the film, and also because he was a firm believer in rehabilitation and thought Andrew Lee should be successfully reintegrated into society since he was a free man again.[7]\n\nIn 1986 he starred in the drama At Close Range, opposite Christopher Walken. The film featured his then wife Madonna's single \"Live to Tell\". The music video for the song, which featured clips from the film, played heavily on MTV and helped promote the film.\n\nAt the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.Penn, nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor five times, has won the award twice. The academy first recognized his work playing a racist murderer on death row in Tim Robbins' 1995 drama Dead Man Walking. Penn was noted in 1999 for his comedic performance as an egotistical jazz guitarist in Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown. He received his third nomination in 2001 after portraying a mentally-handicapped father in I am Sam. In 2003, Penn finally won for his role in Clint Eastwood's Boston crime-drama Mystic River. In 2004, he played a disturbed man bent on killing the president in The Assassination of Richard Nixon. He received his fifth nomination and second win for his role as the charismatic and vibrant gay politician Harvey Milk in the 2008 film Milk. He was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2004.[8]\n\nIn 2006 he portrayed populist governor Willie Stark (based on Huey Long) in an adaptation of the classic American novel All the King's Men, though the film was a critical and commercial failure. In November 2008, Penn earned rave reviews for his portrayal of real-life gay-rights icon and politician Harvey Milk in the biopic Milk and was nominated for best actor for the 2008 Independent Spirit Awards.[9]\n\nDirector\n\nIn 1991, Penn made his directorial debut with The Indian Runner, a film based on Bruce Springsteen's song \"Highway Patrolman\" from the Nebraska album. He also directed music videos, such as Shania Twain's \"Dance with the One That Brought You\" in 1993 and Peter Gabriel's \"The Barry Williams Show\" in 2002. He has since directed three more films, all of which were well-received by critics: The Crossing Guard in 1995, The Pledge in 2001, and Into the Wild in 2007.\n\nPersonal life\n\nPenn was supposedly engaged to actress Elizabeth McGovern, his co-star in 1984's Racing with the Moon, after which he dated Susan Sarandon. Penn's personal life began to attract media attention when he married pop star Madonna in 1985. The relationship was marred by violent outbursts against the press, including one incident for which he was arrested for assaulting a photographer on a film set; Penn was sentenced to 60 days in jail in mid-1987, of which he served 33 days.[10] It is also alleged that when Penn discovered the paparazzo in his hotel room, he hung him by his ankles from the ninth-floor balcony.[11] Madonna dedicated her third studio album True Blue to Penn, referring to him in the liner notes as \"the coolest guy in the universe\". Later in the marriage, Penn was charged with felony domestic assault, a charge for which he pleaded to a misdemeanor. Penn and Madonna divorced in 1989.\n\nHe soon began a relationship with Robin Wright, and their first child – a daughter named Dylan Frances – was born in 1991. Their second child, a son whom they named Hopper Jack, was born in 1993. Penn and Wright married in 1996 and lived in Ross, California. The relationship went through on-and-off periods in the late 2000s. The couple filed for divorce in December 2007, but reconciled several months later, requesting a court dismissal of their divorce case.[12] In April 2009, Penn filed for legal separation, only to withdraw the case once again when the couple reconciled in May.[13][14][15] On August 12, 2009, Wright Penn filed for divorce again,[16] declaring that she had no plans to reconcile this time.[17] The couple's divorce was finalized on July 22, 2010, with the couple reaching a private agreement on child and spousal support, division of assets, and custody over their underage son.[18]\n\nDuring a separation from Wright in the mid 1990s, Penn dated singer and songwriter Jewel. He was also the director of the original video for Jewel's hit song \"You Were Meant for Me\".[19]\n\nRecently, Penn has been linked with model Jessica White.[20]\n\nPenn's younger brother, Chris, died from an enlarged heart in his Santa Monica condominium on January 24, 2006.[11]\n\nAlong with Johnny Depp, Mick Hucknall, and John Malkovich, Penn was a part-owner of the Parisian restaurant-bar Man Ray.[19]\n\nPolitical and social causes\n\nPenn has been active in supporting several political and social causes. On June 10, 2005, Penn made a visit to Iran. Acting as a journalist on an assignment for the San Francisco Chronicle, he attended a Friday prayer at Tehran University.[21]\n\nOn January 7, 2006, Penn was a special guest at the Progressive Democrats of America, where he was joined by author and media critic Norman Solomon, Democratic congressional candidate Charles Brown, and activist Cindy Sheehan. The \"Out of Iraq Forum\", which took place in Sacramento, California, was organized to promote the anti-war movement calling for an end to the War in Iraq.\n\nIn August 2008, Penn made an appearance at one of Ralph Nader's \"Open the Debates\" Super Rallies. He protested the political exclusion of Nader and other third parties.[22]\n\nIn October 2008, Penn traveled to Cuba, where he met with and interviewed President Raúl Castro.[23]\n\nCriticism of President Bush\n\nPenn at an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C.On October 18, 2002, Penn placed a US$56,000 advertisement in the Washington Post asking then President George W. Bush to end a cycle of violence. It was written as an open letter and referred to the planned attack on Iraq and the War on Terror.[24] In the letter, Penn also criticized the Bush administration for its \"deconstruction of civil liberties\" and its \"simplistic and inflammatory view of good and evil.\"[25] Penn visited Iran briefly in December 2002.[24]\n\nThis advertisement was cited as a primary reason for the development of his relationship with Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez. In one of his televised speeches, Chávez used and read aloud an open letter Penn wrote to Bush.[11] The letter condemned the Iraq War, called for Bush to be impeached, and also called Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \"villainously and criminally obscene people.\".[26] In August 2007, Penn met with Chávez in Caracas for two hours, after which Chávez praised him for urging Americans to impeach Bush. Penn also visited a new film studio on the outskirts of Caracas, though he did not speak publicly.[26]\n\nOn April 19, 2007, Penn appeared on The Colbert Report and had a \"Meta-Free-Phor-All\" versus Stephen Colbert that was judged by Robert Pinsky. This stemmed from some of Penn's criticisms of Bush. His exact quote was \"We cower as you point your fingers telling us to support our troops. You and the smarmy pundits in your pocket– those who bathe in the moisture of your soiled and blood-soaked underwear– can take that noise and shove it.\"[27][28] He won the contest with 10,000,000 points to Colbert's 1.[29]\n\nOn December 7, 2007, Penn said he supported Ohio Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich for U.S. President in 2008, and criticized Bush's handling of the Iraq war. Penn questioned whether Bush's twin daughters supported the war in Iraq.[30]\n\nHurricane Katrina\n\nIn September 2005, Penn traveled to New Orleans, Louisiana, to aid Hurricane Katrina victims. He was physically involved in rescuing people,[31] although there was criticism that his involvement was a PR stunt as he hired a photographer to come along with his entourage.[32]\n\nDirector Spike Lee interviewed Penn for his documentary When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts, about Hurricane Katrina.\n\nLGBT Civil Rights\n\nOn February 22, 2009, Penn received the Best Actor Academy Award for the film Milk. In his acceptance speech, Penn said \"...I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren's eyes if they continue that way of support. We've got to have equal rights for everyone!\"[33]\n\nHaitian Earthquake: Manager of Relief Organization and Tent Camp\n\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Sean Penn co-founded the J/P Haitian Relief Organization and has been running a 55,000 person tent camp.[34]\n\nFilmography and awards\n\nOn December 18, 2006, Penn received the Christopher Reeve First Amendment Award from the Creative Coalition.[35]\n\nActor\n\nYear Film Role Notes\n\n1981 Taps Cadet Captain Alex Dwyer film debut\n\n1982 Fast Times at Ridgemont High Jeff Spicoli\n\n1983 Summerspell Buddy\n\nBad Boys Michael O'Brien\n\n1984 Crackers Dillard\n\nRacing with the Moon Henry 'Hopper' Nash/Lou\n\n1985 The Falcon and the Snowman Daulton Lee\n\n1986 At Close Range Brad Whitewood Jr.\n\nShanghai Surprise Glendon Wasey\n\n1987 Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam Narrator\n\n1988 Cool Blue Phil the Plumber uncredited[36]\n\nColors Officer Danny McGavin\n\nJudgment in Berlin Guenther X\n\n1989 Casualties of War Sgt.
