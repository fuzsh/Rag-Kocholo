        "text": "Chris Penn was said to be Sean Penn's better-looking younger brother, which actually may have been true in his younger days. Our favorite of Penn's many roles was as Nice Guy Eddie Cabot in Quentin Tarantino's edgy RESERVOIR DOGS, though his film resume lists some 65 film and TV roles. Penn died intestate, so this 9 page file is pretty straight-forward. Petition for probate, proof of publication, and a bond indicating that the estate was worth in excess of $1 million."
