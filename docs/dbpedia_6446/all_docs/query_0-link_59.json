        "text": "Ellen DeGeneres and Vance DeGeneres\n\nWhen your younger sister is one of the most well-known celebrities in Hollywood, it can be easy for people to forget that there is another talented DeGeneres sibling. Vance DeGeneres began his career as a musician and later as a screenwriter and producer.\n\nHe has contributed to his sister’s sitcom \"Ellen\" and to \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\" While Vance usually works behind the scenes, Ellen is one of the most recognizable figures in television thanks to her talk show \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" and as an awards show host.\n\nRob Lowe and Chad Lowe\n\nBy the 1980s, both Lowe brothers were prominent figures in the film and television industry. While Chad was a common fixture in television shows like \"Melrose Place\" and \"ER,\" brother Rob became part of the new “brat pack” of Hollywood thanks to successful films like \"St. Elmo’s Fire\" and \"About Last Night.\"\n\nIn the decades since then, Rob has remained a mainstay on our screens with roles in the popular comedy series \"Parks and Recreation\" and the drama \"9-1-1: Lone Star\" which means he's surpassed his brother's popularity with an entirely new generation of fans.\n\nFlorence Pugh and Toby Sebastian\n\nFrom a young age, siblings Florence Pugh and Toby Sebastian showed an interest in the arts. While older brother Toby found himself launching a career as a musician, his sister was slowly gaining acting roles in various British productions. Though Toby eventually transitioned to the world of acting, his sister had already become an internationally recognized star thanks to critically acclaimed performances in films like \"Midsommar\" and \"Little Women.\"\n\nHowever, what's really cemented her super-stardom is her role as Yelena Belova in the Marvel superhero film \"Black Widow.\"\n\nDavid Arquette and the Arquette Family\n\nMost people would agree that there was no shortage of talent and stardom in the Arquette household. Four of the five Arquette siblings pursued their acting dreams including Rosanna, Patricia, and Alexis Arquette. While each is well-known, David Arquette became even more so thanks to his relationship with \"Friends\" actress, Courteney Cox.\n\nDavid has also starred in some of the most popular films in recent years including \"Never Been Kissed\" and the \"Scream\" horror film franchise.\n\nBill Murray and Brian Doyle-Murray\n\nThough both Murray brothers appeared in many of the same films and television shows including \"Caddyshack\" and \"Saturday Night Live,\" their careers have taken different directions. After appearing in films like \"Groundhog Day\" and \"National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation,\" Brian Doyle-Murray found success on the small screen in shows like \"Veep\" and \"The Middle.\"\n\nBrother Bill, however, is one of the most acclaimed and popular actors in the industry with memorable roles in films like \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Lost in Translation.\"\n\nPatrick Swayze and Don Swayze\n\nWhen most people hear the name “Swayze”, they tend to think of Patrick Swayze. Known for his memorable roles in films like \"Dirty Dancing,\" \"Ghost,\" and \"Point Break,\" Patrick quickly became an icon in Hollywood. His younger brother, Don, also enjoyed a steady acting career.\n\nThough despite having roles in popular shows like \"True Blood\" and \"Criminal Minds,\" Don’s career never took off in the same way his brothers did. Even after his untimely passing, Patrick's contribution to film lives on.\n\nNatasha Bedingfield and Daniel Bedingfield\n\nIn the very early 2000s, singer Daniel Bedingfield achieved international success with his hit pop song “Gotta Get Thru This” and the still-popular love song “If You’re Not the One”. His younger sister Natasha, also a singer, would soon surpass Daniel with her own successful music career.\n\nHer breakthrough album, Unwritten, featured the popular tracks “These Words”, “Unwritten”, and “Single”. This success was followed by another hit, “Pocketful of Sunshine” which was made even more popular as part of a memorable scene in the comedy \"Easy A.\" Now just try getting that song out of your head. Impossible!\n\nAmy Sedaris and David Sedaris\n\nThe Sedaris siblings are known for their contributions to the arts. Brother David is an award-winning author known for his best-selling books \"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\" and \"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\" Sister Amy is an actress and also a writer. Amy is known for her roles in \"The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\" and \"The Mandalorian.\"\n\nAmy has also appeared in films like \"Maid in Manhattan\" and \"Jennifer’s Body.\" Known for her eccentric characters and comedic writing, Amy’s talent has made her popular on and off the screen.\n\nJurnee Smollett and Jussie Smollett\n\nAs children, siblings Jurnee and Jussie Smollett were encouraged to pursue their acting dreams. As a child, older brother Jussie appeared in a variety of films including \"The Mighty Ducks.\" Jurnee also started her acting career young, with roles in \"Full House\" and the film \"Eve’s Bayou.\" While Jussie’s role on the show \"Empire\" earned him fame and acclaim, his career was since plummeted due to a variety of legal issues.\n\nToday, Jurnee has carved a name out for herself with roles in \"Lovecraft Country\" and as Dinah Lance/ Black Canary in the superhero film \"Birds of Prey.\" We can't wait to see what comes next for the rising star.\n\nTaissa Farmiga and Vera Farmiga\n\nThere’s no denying actress Vera Farmiga’s talent. As the star of \"The Conjuring\" horror film series, Vera has earned the nickname of “scream queen”. In addition to horror films, Vera has also starred in films like \"The Departed\" and \"Up in the Air\" opposite silver-screen royalty like Leonardo Dicaprio and George Clooney.\n\nIt seems that talent must run in the Farmiga family because younger sister Taissa is quickly making a name for herself in Hollywood. With roles in the \"American Horror Story\" television franchise and \"The Gilded Age\" television series, Taissa seems to be quickly becoming a star in her own right.\n\nDennis Quaid and Randy Quaid\n\nYears before his younger brother Dennis would become an international star, Randy Quaid was receiving critical acclaim for his roles in films like \"The Last Detail\" and \"Midnight Express.\" By the ‘80s however, Dennis had captured the eye of Hollywood thanks to roles in films like \"The Big Easy\" and \"Great Balls of Fire!\"\n\nDennis’ success continued with roles in \"The Parent Trap,\" and \"Any Given Sunday.\" Dennis has also become a fan favorite to a new generation with roles in family films such as \"A Dog’s Purpose.\"\n\nBillie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell\n\nGuiding younger siblings with their musical aspirations can be a kind thing, but it can also result in that sibling becoming more famous. As a child, Billie Eilish looked up to her older brother Finneas O’Connell, a musician. O’Connell helped Billie compose what would become her breakout hit, “Ocean Eyes.\"\n\nEilish soon became one of the most popular musicians in the world, winning various awards for her chart-topping hits. But don't count Finneas out just yet, he seems to be forging his own solo career as a music producer and singer.\n\nDavid Spade and Andy Spade\n\nFew people know that the comedic actor David Spade and co-founder of the luxury lifestyle brand Kate Spade New York are related. Older brother Andy co-founded the iconic brand with his late wife, Kate. His younger brother, David, also pursued a creative career — in entertainment.\n\nAfter becoming a beloved cast member of \"Saturday Night Live,\" David starred in comedies like \"Tommy Boy,\" \"Joe Dirt,\" and \"The Emperor’s New Groove.\" He’s also become a successful television host, guest-hosting \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and launching his own late-night talk show called \"Lights Out With David Spade\".\n\nMamie Gummer and Grace Gummer\n\nWith Meryl Streep as their mother, it’s no surprise that the Gummer sisters are extremely talented actresses. Grace Gummer is known for her work in television shows like \"The Newsroom,\" \"American Horror Story: Freak Show,\" and \"Mr. Robot.\" Sister Mamie has starred in films like \"Side Effects\" and \"The Flash.\"\n\nShe also shot to fame with roles in shows like \"The Good Wife\" and its spin-off, \"The Good Fight.\" She also starred in the crime mystery show, \"True Detective.\"\n\nDan Levy and Sarah Levy\n\nEven fans of the comedy series \"Schitt’s Creek\" would be surprised to learn that the actress who plays waitress Twyla Sands is actually the sister of actor Dan Levy. Though they both act on the show, Dan has become one of the most promising figures in Hollywood.\n\nAfter starting his career as a host on MTV Canada, he co-created the hit sitcom \"Schitt’s Creek\" with his father, veteran comedic actor Eugene Levy. As part of one of the most acclaimed comedies, Dan’s career continues to grow with other hilarious projects in the works. Not to mention that he's now an Emmy Award winner!\n\nBlake Lively and Robyn Lively\n\nYears before Blake Lively was strutting the streets of the Upper East Side on the show \"Gossip Girl,\" actress Robyn Lively had one of the hottest careers in Hollywood. Known for her roles in \"The Karate Kid Part III\" and \"Teen Witch,\" Robyn was one of the most popular actresses in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s.\n\nToday, younger half-sister, Blake Lively, has quickly risen in fame thanks to roles in \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\" \"The Town,\" and \"A Simple Favor.\" Blake has also become a style icon and muse to various designers.\n\nJason Bateman and Justine Bateman\n\nDuring the ‘80s, Justine Bateman was one of the most popular figures on television thanks to her role in the hit sitcom \"Family Ties.\" Around the same time, brother Jason also rose in popularity with the success of his television show, \"The Hogan Family.\"\n\nWorking steadily, he soon garnered critical acclaim for his role in the cult-favorite series \"Arrested Development.\" He parlayed his acting talent into films with success in movies like \"Horrible Bosses\" and \"The Gift.\" His fame has grown even further thanks to his role in the award-winning series, \"Ozark.\"\n\nMark Wahlberg and Donnie Wahlberg\n\nGrowing up in a rough neighborhood in Boston, the Wahlberg brothers never dreamed that they would become major celebrities. In the late 1980s, Donnie reached international fame as a founding member of the boy band New Kids on the Block. By the mid-1990s, New Kids on the Block had disbanded and Donnie had turned to acting. Mark also had his time in the rap universe as the main member of Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.\n\nAfter his musical moment, Mark’s acting career was taking off thanks to roles in \"Fear\" and \"Boogie Nights.\" Though Donnie has worked consistently in film and television, Mark has become a bonafide film star.\n\nRooney Mara and Kate Mara\n\nAs a child, Rooney Mara used to admire her older sister’s acting career. Destined to also become an actress, she would often appear as an extra in her sister’s films. While Kate had already established a respectful career in Hollywood, her younger sister would soon get a role that would change her life.\n\nIn her role as Lisbeth Salander in the film adaptation of \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\" she received a multitude of accolades for her work. Today, Rooney has established herself as one of the biggest actresses in the industry.\n\nShawn Ashmore and Aaron Ashmore\n\nIt may seem strange to see how two identical twin actors could have such different careers in Hollywood but such is the case for twins Shawn and Aaron Ashmore.\n\nBoth Ashmore brothers got their film break in the film \"Married to It.\" Following the film, Shawn received international fame when he was cast as Bobby Drake/ Iceman in the \"X-Men\" superhero film series. Other roles followed including roles in the television shows \"The Following,\" \"Conviction,\" and \"The Boys.\" While brother Aaron continues to work in their native Canada and recently starred in the horror film \"The Retreat,\" it appears that Shawn's Hollywood star shines far brighter.\n\nRufus Wainwright and Martha Wainwright\n\nHaving been born to folk singer parents, Rufus and Martha Wainwright began their musical careers at an early age. As teenagers, they toured with their siblings, mother, and aunt in their family band called The McGarrigle Sisters and Family.\n\nThough they were all immensely talented, it was Rufus whose song “I’m a-Runnin” gained industry attention and helped launch his solo career. Though Martha has also enjoyed a successful music career, Rufus is the better-known Wainwright sibling.\n\nMatt Dillon and Kevin Dillon\n\nThough brothers Matt Dillon and Kevin Dillon began acting around the same time, their careers took different turns. After finding success in films like \"Platoon\" and \"The Doors,\" Kevin took on more television work including his most famous role as Johnny “Drama” Chase on HBO’s \"Entourage.\"\n\nToday, brother Matt has carved out a successful career in film with roles in \"The Outsiders,\" \"There’s Something About Mary,\" and \"Wild Things.\" With roles in everything from comedies to dark dramas, Matt Dillon is considered one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood.\n\nAriel Winter and Jimmy Workman\n\nWith different last names and appearances, many people would find it hard to believe that actors Ariel Winter and Jimmy Workman are related. Older brother Jimmy came to fame as Pugsley Addams in \"The Addams Family\" film series. Today he works mostly behind the scenes as a transportation coordinator on film sets.\n\nYounger sister Ariel is known for her role as Alex Dunphy on the hit sitcom \"Modern Family\" which shot her into superstardom almost overnight. We can't wait to see what the young star does next!\n\nBella Hadid and Gigi Hadid\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock, you've certainly seen at least one of the Hadid sister's faces splashed all over social media and top-tier fashion magazines. Gigi and Bella Hadid have taken the fashion industry by storm. While older sister Gigi was the first Hadid kid to make it big by landing the cover of every major magazine and contracts with international fashion campaigns, it's little sister Bella that has become one of the hottest celebrities in the world.\n\nWith trendsetting looks and high-profile romances, Bella has attracted a large following on social media. Bella has been able to parlay her popularity into several lucrative modeling gigs and as a frequent fixture on the runways of major fashion shows.\n\nZooey Deschanel and Emily Deschanel\n\nNot only do the Deschanel sisters share similar stunning blue eyes, but both sisters are extremely talented. Older sister Emily is best known for her role in the crime procedural series \"Bones,\" while Zooey is known for her role in the sitcom \"New Girl.\"\n\nUnlike Emily, however, Zooey has also found success on the big screen with roles in the popular holiday film \"Elf\" and the anti-romantic film \"500 Days of Summer.\" In addition to acting and singing, Zooey also co-founded the popular website HelloGiggles.\n\nAbigail Breslin and Spencer Breslin\n\nBoth Spencer and Abigail Breslin began their acting careers when they were just toddlers. Older brother Spencer quickly found himself cast in commercials and films like Disney’s \"The Kid\" and \"Raising Helen.\" His sister also followed suit, appearing in films like \"Signs\" and her break-out role, \"Little Miss Sunshine.\"\n\nNow an adult, Abigail continues to be an in-demand actress with roles in television shows like \"Scream Queens\" and films like \"Stillwater.\" Spencer has chosen to focus on his music career and to host a weekly podcast called \"Spencer & Lara’s Vomitorium.\" Hmm...sounds...interesting?\n\nLily Collins and Simon Collins\n\nWith a voice and musical style often compared to his father, Phil Collins, musician Simon Collins is extremely talented. Though he achieved moderate international success with his singles “Pride” and “Unconditional”, he has had difficulty making more of an impact in the music industry.\n\nSister Lily Collins, however, has become one of the most in-demand actresses in the business thanks to roles in \"To the Bone,\" and the popular yet controversial Netflix series \"Emily in Paris.\"\n\nBilly Zane and Lisa Zane\n\nReaders of a certain age may remember Lisa Zane from films like the dark thriller \"Bad Influence\" and the cult classic horror movie \"Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare.\"\n\nThe older sister of actor Billy Zane, Lisa left Hollywood to pursue a career as a musician and songwriter. Her younger brother, Billy Zane, is known to many as the villainous Cal in \"Titanic.\" Though Billy’s career has cooled off quite a bit since that role, he has made a return to television with roles in shows like \"Community\" and \"The Boys.\"\n\nLily Aldridge and Saffron Aldridge\n\nBefore she was sporting her “angel wings” on the runway, Victoria’s Secret model Lily Aldridge’s older half-sister was gracing the covers of the most prestigious fashion magazines. During the ‘90s, Saffron Aldridge became the face of designer Ralph Lauren and appeared in a variety of international fashion campaigns.\n\nWhile Saffron has since focused on charity work, half-sister Lily is one of the most popular models and fashionistas. Known for her Victoria’s Secret campaigns and marriage to Kings of Leon rocker Caleb Followill, Lily is one of the most popular models in the fashion industry.\n\nPhylicia Rashad and Debbie Allen\n\nDebbie Allen is considered one of the most celebrated and decorated stars in Tinseltown. That said, there is no denying that her sister Phylicia Rashad is also a star. As Clair Huxtable on the classic sitcom \"The Cosby Show,\" Rashad enchanted viewers for almost a decade.\n\nBeyond that iconic role, Rashad has also provided her voice to children’s television shows like \"Little Bill\" and the film \"Soul.\" Today, both women remain beloved icons for their talent and barrier-breaking achievement in the arts.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal and Maggie Gyllenhaal\n\nBorn to filmmakers Stephen Gyllenhaal and Naomi Foner, the Gyllenhaal siblings seemed destined to become famous. Though both siblings had appeared in several of their father’s films, it was their roles (as...you guessed it, brother and sister) in the cult-favorite \"Donnie Darko\" that helped launch their careers.\n\nWhile Maggie is known for critically-acclaimed roles in films like \"Secretary\" and her directorial debut with \"The Lost Daughter, \"Jake is considered to be one of Tinsel Town's leading men. In addition to starring in films like \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Nightcrawler,\" and \"Spider-Man: Far From Home,\" Jake’s fame has grown thanks to his heartthrob appearance and his high-profile relationships with other stars.\n\nBritney Spears and Jamie Lynn Spears\n\nIconic pop princess Britney Spears needs no introduction. Alongside her platinum music career, her scandalous life and recent legal battles have kept her in the public eye at all times.\n\nHer younger sister Jamie Lynn enjoyed some success with her Nickelodeon show \"Zoey 101\" but she never came close to eclipsing her sister's star power. Britney has and always will be the superstar Spears sister.\n\nAshley Judd and Wynonna Judd\n\nBefore Ashley Judd had become one of the biggest actresses in Hollywood, most people associated the last name Judd with the mother-daughter country music duo, the Judds. Made up of mother Naomi Judd and Ashley’s half-sister Wynonna, the duo dominated the charts with hits like “Why Not Me'' and “Mama, He’s Crazy”.\n\nBy the ’90s, Ashley had risen to fame with roles in \"Heat,\" \"A Time to Kill,\" and \"Double Jeopardy.\" While Wynonna is still a beloved part of the music industry, Ashley continues to be a famous figure as an actress and political activist.\n\nRalph Fiennes and Joseph Fiennes\n\nThough younger brother Joseph shot to fame thanks to his role in \"Shakespeare in Love,\" he never achieved the career momentum of his older brother, Ralph. Ralph’s impressive acting resume includes his iconic villainous role as Voldemort in the mega-successful \"Harry Potter\" franchise.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that both brothers are immensely talented, it seems that Ralph has stolen his brother's acting thunder.\n\nSofia Richie and Nicole Richie\n\nFrom headline-grabbing antics to high-profile romances, Nicole Richie seemed to be the “it girl” of the early 2000s. After finding success on the reality television show \"The Simple Life\" with socialite bestie Paris Hilton, Nicole became known as a fashionista and even launched her own brand, House of Harlow.\n\nLittle did fans know, that her younger sister Sofia, would become this generation’s new “it girl”. Sofia has become known as a popular model and fashion designer. Like her older sister, she is also known for her famous exes including Justin Bieber and Scott Disick.\n\nRobert Pattinson and Lizzy Pattinson\n\nBefore actor Robert Pattinson was a teen heartthrob thanks to his role as vampire Edward Cullen in the \"Twilight\" saga, his sister was enjoying success as a singer. Her singles “Let the Sunshine in” and “Dreaming”, to which she contributed vocals, performed well on the charts.\n\nDespite this success and even her contribution to the \"Twilight\" movie soundtrack, her brother quickly became the more famous Pattinson. With roles in \"Tenet\" and \"The Batman,\" Robert is one of the most popular and critically acclaimed actors in Hollywood.\n\nSienna Miller and Savannah Miller\n\nThough Savannah Miller had formally studied fashion, it was her sister, actress Sienna Miller, who became known for her style and fashion sense. Sienna made the transition from model to actress with roles in films like \"Layer Cake\" and \"Alfie.\"\n\nOff-screen, the actress became internationally known thanks to her headline-grabbing personal life and admirable street style dubbed “boho-chic.” Though the two sisters collaborated on a fashion label called Twenty8Twelve, Sienna's continually evolving acting career makes Sienna the more well-known Miller sibling for sure!\n\nKylie Minogue and Dannii Minogue\n\nAchieving international fame can be a difficult thing for any artist. A perfect example can be found in the Minogue sisters, Kylie and Dannii. Though both sisters achieved fame early on in their native Australia, Kylie became a global pop star with hits like “The Loco-Motion” and “ Can’t Get You Out of My Head.\"\n\nTo her credit, Dannii is still a popular celebrity in Australia and the U.K. where she frequently stars as a judge on a variety of reality shows including \"The X Factor UK\" and \"The Masked Singer Australia.\"\n\nBlake Lively and Eric Lively\n\nHaving an actress and fashionista as a sister can be intimidating for anyone, especially a fellow actor. Though Eric Lively had a strong start in show business with roles in \"American Pie,\" the television series \"So Weird\" and \"The L Word,\" his fame has been overshadowed by his sister Blake Lively.\n\nIn addition to being one of the most in-demand actresses, Blake is known for her relationship with fellow star Ryan Reynolds. While it seems that Eric has taken a break from Hollywood, his sister seems to have had no trouble taking over the spotlight.\n\nEmma Thompson and Sophie Thompson\n\nIt can be difficult to achieve success as an actress when your sister is considered one of the most celebrated actresses in recent times. Younger sister, actress Sophie Thompson, has had roles on the British television series \"EastEnders\" and in films like \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\"\n\nOlder sister Emma is an award-winning actress known for her work in films like \"The Remains of the Day,\" the \"Harry Potter\" film series, \"Love Actually,\" and the \"Nanny McPhee\" films. Having acted in everything from period dramas to family comedies, Emma’s fame continues to grow.\n\nMark Ronson and Samantha Ronson\n\nThough Mark Ronson had already established himself as a key figure in the music industry as a musician and producer, there was a time when his fame was overshadowed by his younger sister, DJ, and fellow musician Samatha Ronson.\n\nIn addition to being one of the most in-demand DJs for the celebrity set, Samantha was known for her infamous relationship with Lindsay Lohan. The tables turned once again when Mark produced huge hits like “Uptown Funk” and helped co-write the equally large hit “Shallow” from the film “A Star is Born”.\n\nJulia Roberts and Eric Roberts\n\nThough Eric Roberts had been acting for about a decade before his younger sister’s big Hollywood break, their acting careers took vastly different directions. By the mid-1980s, Eric was an established actor with films like \"Star 80\" and \"Runaway Train\" under his belt.\n\nUnfortunately, his career began to suffer due to various issues in his personal life. Julia soon found international fame with films like \"Pretty Woman\" and critical acclaim with her Best Actress Oscar win for her role in \"Erin Brockovich.\" Today, she is one of the industry’s most bankable stars thanks to her successful films and has earned countless awards and accolades for her work.\n\nElle Fanning and Dakota Fanning\n\nSporting similar flaxen locks, the Fanning sisters are a formidable force in Hollywood. While older sister Dakota made a name for herself with critically acclaimed roles in films like \"I am Sam\" and \"War of the Worlds\" it seems that she's taken a step back from acting. Younger sister Elle Fanning on the other hand is quickly becoming one of the industry’s biggest stars.\n\nElle has starred in Disney’s \"Maleficent\" film series, the historical comedy television series \"The Great,\" and the gripping true-crime series \"The Girl From Plainville.\" In addition to being an award-nominated actress, Elle has also become a fashionista with her daring red-carpet looks.\n\nElizabeth Olsen, Mary-Kate, and Ashley Olsen\n\nDuring the ‘90s and early 2000s, there was no escaping the popularity of the Olsen twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley. From movies to apparel, these celebrity sisters were everywhere. Who could've guessed that it would be the twins' younger sister who would eventually become the more popular Olsen family member?\n\nFrom small roles in her older sisters’ films, Elizabeth Olsen soon found herself winning accolades for her work in a variety of films. Her biggest role has been that of Wanda Maximoff which she has played in a variety of Marvel Cinematic Universe projects.\n\nJeff Bridges and Beau Bridges\n\nWith a famous father, the Bridges brothers were born to act! Older brother Beau had already established himself as an actor when his younger brother Jeff decided to give the whole acting thing a go. While the two have appeared together on screen in films like \"The Fabulous Baker Boys,\" Jeff gained fame thanks to cult-favorite \"The Big Lebowski.\"\n\nAs one of the most celebrated actors in Hollywood, thanks to his ability to completely transform into his characters, there’s no denying the star power that Jeff Bridges possesses.\n\nOwen Wilson and Luke Wilson\n\nLuke, the younger Wilson brother, got his start appearing in none other than Owen's short film \"Bottle Rocket.\" Luke’s career soon kicked off with roles in \"Legally Blonde\" and \"Old School.\" While he's still a popular actor, it's safe to say that his fame was eclipsed by his brother’s string of commercial successes in the early 2000s.\n\nOwen Wilson's immense popularity propelled him into the pop culture zeitgeist. However, the two seem to collaborate now and then and show off their brotherly bond. We love to see it!\n\nEmily Osment and Haley Joel Osment\n\nMost people can remember the terrifying moment when actor Haley Joel Osment turned to the camera and said “I see dead people'' in the psychological thriller, \"The Sixth Sense.\" After that memorable film, Haley appeared in a variety of films including \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" and \"Secondhand Lions.\"\n\nHis younger sister, Emily, has also made quite a career for herself. Though she was also a child actress with roles in the \"Hannah Montana\" television series, she has also successfully transitioned into more adult roles including \"The Kominsky Method,\" \"Pretty Smart,\" and \"Young Sheldon.\"\n\nMarie Osmond and Donny Osmond\n\nFeatured on the cover of countless teen magazines in the ‘70s, Donny Osmond quickly became a teen idol as a part of his family’s band, the Osmonds.\n\nThough he would later join his sister Marie as host on their variety show \"The Donny & Marie Show,\" the siblings would have very different futures. While Donny’s career hit a slump in the ‘80s, Marie found success as a country and pop singer and as an actress. She has also hosted her own variety show, \"Marie,\" and served as a host on the daytime talk show, \"The Talk.\"\n\nHailey Bieber and Alaia Baldwin\n\nAlaia and Hailey B may have been born into one of the most famous Hollywood families, but this new generation of Baldwins has carved out completely unique identities. Though both siblings began as models, older sister Alaia has taken time off to focus on her family and to raise awareness of women’s health issues.\n\nYounger sister Hailey is known as one of the most popular models and social media influencers. She is also known for her marriage to pop icon Justin Bieber. It doesn't seem that Hailey will be shying away from the spotlight anytime soon.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Lynda Lopez\n\nBy the time Jennifer Lopez was embarking on her music career, her younger sister Lynda was a well-known and respected radio personality and news anchor in New York. Though Lynda secured jobs with VH1 and E! News Live and was an Emmy Award-winning news anchor, her sister had already achieved international stardom.\n\nWith fashion lines, a film career, and a multitude of chart-topping hits, Jennifer is a pop icon. More than just a triple threat, Jennifer has broken barriers for other Latin entertainers and celebrities.\n\nKendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner\n\nThe two youngest Kardashian/Jenner sisters have certainly forged their own paths out of the mega-famous older sister's shadows. While initially, it appeared that Kendall Jenner, with her blossoming supermodel career, would be the more successful of the pair, it's Kylie Jenner that reigns supreme.\n\nKylie found her niche in the beauty industry with her mega-successful company Kylie Cosmetics. Her beauty brand is so popular that it's propelled the star to (almost) billionaire status. All at the ripe age of 24! Not to mention, she's amassed over 300 million Instagram followers (and counting). Kendall is a mere 100 million followers behind. Catch-up, Kendall!\n\nGary Oldman and Laila Morse\n\nBy the 1990s, actor Gary Oldman was one of the most in-demand actors in Hollywood thanks to films like Bram Stoker’s \"Dracula\" and \"The Fifth Element.\" By the early 2000s, however, his career seemed to come to a stop.\n\nAt the same time, his older sister, actress Laila Morse was enjoying fame and success on the long-running British television series \"EastEnders.\" Thankfully, roles in the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and \"Batman Begins\" gave his career a much-needed energy boost. Today, Gary Oldman is considered one of the best actors in the industry.\n\nKieran Culkin and Macaulay Culkin\n\nWhen most people think of child stars, one of the first celebrities they tend to think of is Macaulay Culkin. As the star of the first two \"Home Alone\" films, Macaulay became one of the most popular actors in the early ‘90s.\n\nMacaulay eventually decided to take a hiatus from acting. Younger brother Kieran was able to continue the momentum of his child actor career with critically acclaimed performances in \"Igby Goes Down.\" However, it's Kieran's recent role as a bad boy with a heart (and pocket full) of gold Roman Roy in the critically acclaimed television series \"Succession\" that has helped him overshadow his brother's fame.\n\nSeth Meyers and Josh Meyers\n\nComedic timing is certainly a gift both Meyers brothers share. While younger brother Josh found success on the sketch comedy series \"MADtv,\" older brother Seth also gained a comedy cult following for his hilarious \"Weekend Update\" skits on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nSeth's star power has continued to grow with him landing the gig as host of the late-night talk show \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\" While Josh continues to act, there’s no doubt that his brother Seth has forged a more noteworthy career.\n\nAlfie Allen and Lily Allen\n\nIn the early 2000s, Lily Allen became a common fixture on the music charts with hits like “ Smile” “LDN”, and “Alfie”. While Allen is still making music, her popularity has slowly waned. In a surprising twist, her younger brother Alfie (and the subject of one of her greatest hits, “Alfie”) has enjoyed growing success as an actor.\n\nWith major roles in \"Game of Thrones,\" \"John Wick\" and \"Jojo Rabbit,\" Alfie has clearly grown past being just Lily Allen’s younger brother.\n\nJesse Eisenberg and Hallie Eisenberg\n\nMost people would be surprised to know that the adorably dimpled commercial star is actually the sister of actor Jesse Eisenberg. After finding success as “The Pepsi Girl”, Hallie appeared in several films including \"Beautiful\" and \"How to Eat Fried Worms.\"\n\nYears later, brother Jesse received fame and acclaim for his role as the infamous Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" Jesse’s success has continued with roles in films like \"Adventureland\" and the \"Now You See Me\" film series. With more major roles in his future, Jesse’s career shows no signs of stopping.\n\nCharlie O’Connell and Jerry O’Connell\n\nThere’s no denying that actor Jerry O’Connell has had one of the longest-running careers compared to most former child stars. With roles in the classic ’80s film \"Stand by Me\" and the television drama \"Crossing Jordan,\" Jerry has quite the acting resume.\n\nThough younger brother Charlie never achieved the same acting career as Jerry, he found fame as the star of the reality dating show \"The Bachelor\" in 2005. The show, which featured his on-off relationship with contestant Sarah Brice, quickly became a fan favorite and helped boost his popularity.\n\nAlec Baldwin and the Baldwin Brothers\n\nDuring the ‘80s and ‘90s, the Baldwin brothers seemed to be everywhere. From television shows to films, viewers couldn’t get enough of the talented family. As time went on, however, the fame of brothers Daniel, William, and Stephen seemed to wane.\n\nAlec’s career, on the other hand, continued to be successful with roles in sitcoms like \"30 Rock,\" and films like \"The Aviator.\" Alec also gained new notoriety in his popular politically-themed skits on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nCara Delevingne and Poppy Delevingne\n\nWhile Poppy Delevinge was first on the UK modeling and socialite scene, it was baby sister Cara who really stole the show. A frequent fixture in the tabloids and socialite scene, Poppy had become a muse for some of Britain’s hottest designers.\n\nHowever, soon enough Cara cat-walked right past her older sister to become fashion's \"It Girl\". Now a highly successful model, Cara has explored the world of acting with roles in the action film \"Suicide Squad\" and the television series \"Carnival Row.\"\n\nBeanie Feldstein and Jonah Hill\n\nDid you know that Jonah Hill and Beanie Feldstein are brother and sister!? Neither did we! While older brother Jonah is an established actor thanks to roles in \"Superbad\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" Beanie isn’t too far behind.\n\nIn fact, with roles in the comedy \"Booksmart,\" the show \"Impeachment: American Crime Story,\" and the Broadway revival of \"Funny Girl,\" Beanie’s career is on track to overshadow her brother's very soon.\n\nStella McCartney and Mary McCartney\n\nBorn to artistic icons Paul and Linda McCartney, Stella and Mary McCartney grew up in an undeniably creative environment. Older sister Mary pursued her passion for photography, influenced by her late mother Linda, while sister Stella pursued fashion design.\n\nWhile Mary is a respected photographer known for photos of celebrities and politicians, her sister Stella is one of the biggest names in fashion. With dozens of stores around the world, designer collaborations, and a successful fragrance line, Stella’s name has become synonymous with style. While Stella is certainly the more successful sibling, she's still nowhere close to her father's fame.\n\nMargaret Qualley and Rainey Qualley\n\nWith Andie MacDowell as their mother, it's no surprise that the Qualley sisters would be naturals in front of the camera. After appearances in the hit show \"Mad Men,\" Rainey began to pursue a music career performing under the name Rainsford.\n\nHer sister Margaret has also pursued an acting career, and quickly received attention for her roles in \"The Leftovers\" and \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" Still early in her career, Margaret has become one of the most promising young actresses in Hollywood.\n\nJoey King and Hunter King\n\nThough older sister Hunter King had achieved success with roles in shows like \"Roswell,\" \"The Young and the Restless,\" and \"Life in Pieces,\" her younger sister quickly found herself with a blossoming film career. After appearing in shows like \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\" and \"New Girl,\" Joey was cast in films like \"Ramona and Beezus,\" and in the horror films \"The Conjuring\" and \"Slender Man.\"\n\nHer biggest break, however, came as Elle Evans in the successful rom-com \"The Kissing Booth\" film series on Netflix. With her dramatic role in \"The Act,\" she's carving her own space out in the film industry.\n\nToni Braxton and the Braxton Sisters\n\nLike many artists, R&B superstar Toni Braxton began performing with her siblings Toni, Towanda, Tamar, Trina, and Traci Braxton. Now that's a lot of T. Toni soon caught the eyes of record executives who persuaded her to embark on a solo career. Today, Toni has sold millions of records and her hit songs “Un-Break My Heart” and “He Wasn’t Man Enough” have become classics.\n\nBeyond being an award-winning and influential artist, Toni has also starred in and produced reality shows centering around her life and the lives of her sisters called \"Braxton Family Values\" and \"Tamar & Vince.\"\n\nJohn Cusack and Joan Cusack\n\nThere’s no denying that siblings John and Joan Cusack are some of Hollywood’s most acclaimed stars. While older sister Joan is known for critically-acclaimed performances in films like \"Working Girl\" and \"In & Out,\" her brother became an ‘80s heartthrob thanks to that iconic boombox scene in \"Say Anything.\"\n\nThough both siblings have enjoyed long-spanning and successful careers, there's no denying that John has made more of a mark on Hollywood.\n\nJohn Travolta and Ellen Travolta\n\nBefore John Travolta was showing off his disco dance moves in \"Saturday Night Fever,\" his older sister had already started her television career. Ellen Travolta appeared in iconic television series like \"General Hospital,\" \"Happy Days,\" and \"Charles in Charge.\"\n\nWhile she forged quite a career for herself in television, her brother later became one of the most famous actors in the world. Thanks to roles in \"Grease,\" \"Urban Cowboy,\" \"Pulp Fiction,\" and \"Get Shorty,\" John has become a formidable force in the industry.\n\nNicole Kidman and Antonia Kidman\n\nIt can be difficult to pursue a career in the public eye when your sister is one of the biggest stars on the planet. Though Antonia Kidman has established herself as a well-respected journalist and television presenter in Australia, older sister Nicole is the more well-known Kidman sibling. Known for roles in \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" \"Moulin Rouge!,\" \"Big Little Lies,\" and \"The Northman,\" Nicole is considered one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood.\n\nWhile Antonia may be well-known to Australian audiences, there’s no doubt that she is often overshadowed by her more famous sister.\n\nCandace Cameron Bure and Kirk Cameron\n\nBy the late ‘80s, actor Kirk Cameron had moved past his iconic role on the sitcom \"Growing Pains\" and had become a teen heartthrob with countless adoring teen fans. Around the same time, his younger sister Candace was launching her own career on the hit sitcom \"Full House.\"\n\nAs D.J. Tanner, she quickly became a household name. Today, Candace is known for co-hosting the daytime talk show \"The View,\" for appearing in more than two-dozen Hallmark Channel movies, and for her role in the revival of \"Full House\", \"Fuller House.\"\n\nGiovanni Ribisi and Marissa Ribisi\n\nThough acting siblings Giovanni and Marissa Ribisi both appeared on the ‘80s sitcom \"My Two Dads,\" they would soon embark on different paths.\n\nAfter appearing in films like \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Pleasantville,\" Marissa began finding more work in television with appearances on shows like \"Felicity\" and \"Grown Ups.\" Brother Giovanni, however, has appeared in films like \"Avatar,\" \"Lost in Translation\" and television shows like \"My Name is Earl\" and \"Sneaky Pete.\"\n\nNoah Cyrus and Miley Cyrus\n\nNot only is Noah Cyrus the daughter of country crooner Billy Ray Cyrus, but she is also the younger sister of another mega-celebrity — Miley Cyrus.\n\nThough there’s no doubt that Miley Cyrus is still one of the biggest names in music, younger sister Noah is quickly making a name for herself. Her single “Make Me (Cry)”, which featured British musician Labrinth, helped launch a successful music career. In addition to making music, Noah has explored acting with a role on the FX horror television series \"American Horror Stories.\"\n\nJane Fonda and Peter Fonda\n\nWhile Peter achieved critical acclaim and attention for roles in iconic films such as \"Easy Rider\" and \"Ulee’s Gold,\" his sister’s fame went beyond the silver screen. In addition to roles in films like \"Barbarella\" and \"9 to 5,\" Jane became known for her popular workout videos and outspoken political beliefs.\n\nJane also made a return to film with roles in the popular comedy \"Monster-in-Law\" and the television show \"Grace and Frankie.\"\n\nHilary Duff and Haylie Duff\n\nThough sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff began their careers at relatively the same time, younger sister Hilary was lucky enough to catch her big break on the Disney television series \"Lizzie McGuire.\". Though Haylie made appearances on \"Lizzie McGuire\" and in the cult-classic \"Napoleon Dynamite,\" she hasn’t been able to achieve the long-running success of her younger sister.\n\nHilary was able to successfully transition from teen actress to established actress and singer with roles in films like \"A Cinderella Story,\" and television shows like \"Younger,\" and \"How I Met Your Father.\"\n\nBen Savage and Fred Savage\n\nBoth Ben and Fred Savage are known for playing characters on some of the most iconic television shows. After starring in the show \"The Wonder Years\" and in the film \"The Princess Bride,\" Fred was able to make the successful transition from child star to a respected director. Younger brother Ben also became a popular star thanks to his role in the hit sitcom \"Boy Meets World.\"\n\nBen enjoyed a new resurgence of fame thanks to the show’s spin-off series, \"Girl Meets World.\" However, there's no doubt that Fred has had more success in his career as a director.\n\nVanessa Williams and Chris Williams\n\nIt can be difficult to live in the shadow of Miss America, as Chris Williams would find out. While he managed to find roles on well-known television shows like \"JAG\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" he hasn’t been able to achieve the heights of fame that his older sister Vanessa has achieved.\n\nWith a successful music and film career, Vanessa is one of the most popular female entertainers in Hollywood. In addition to being talented, Vanessa is known for her barrier-breaking achievements including becoming the first African American woman to receive the title of Miss America. Talk about a trailblazer!\n\nJanet Jackson and Michael Jackson\n\nThere’s no denying that the late Michael Jackson was truly the “King of Pop”. Younger sister Janet, however, also managed to carve out her own identity as an artist to become known as the “Queen of Pop” and one of the best-selling artists in history.\n\nFrom appearances on classic television shows like \"Diff’rent Strokes\" and \"Good Times\" to sold-out arenas and chart-topping hits, Janet has become so much more than Michael’s sister. Today, Janet is still recognized as a powerful influence in the music and entertainment industry.\n\nCharlie Sheen and Emilio Estévez\n\nBy the 1980s, both Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estévez were Hollywood heavyweights. Charlie had starred in major films like \"Platoon\" and \"Wall Street\" while Emilio was part of the decade’s “brat pack” thanks to roles in films like \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"The Outsiders.\" In the decades to follow, Charlie's scandalous life and risque romances kept him in the spotlight and on the cover of tabloid magazines.\n\nAll that attention helped him land his role in the hit sitcom \"Two and a Half Men\" making him the highest-paid actor on television at the time. We're sure that Charlie's infamy made Emilio sing \"don't you...forget about me.\" Yes, that is a \"Breakfast Club\" reference!\n\nRashida Jones and Kidada Jones\n\nIn the ‘90s, model and fashion designer Kidada Jones was the go-to designer when it came to street style. She worked with labels like Tommy Hilfiger and dressed stars like Aaliyah and Snoop Dogg,\n\nKidada was one of the most in-demand fashionistas. Her younger sister, however, enjoyed a career surge in the early 2000s thanks to roles in the sitcoms \"The Office\" and \"Parks and Recreation\" and comedic films like \"I Love You, Man.\" With an established acting and writing career, it seems that Rashida’s fame will only continue to grow.\n\nChris Hemsworth and Liam Hemsworth\n\nMost people would agree that there is no shortage of good looks and talent in the Hemsworth family. Aussie brothers Chris and Liam have both conquered Hollywood much to the delight of their fans.\n\nThe younger Hemsworth, Liam, has had memorable roles in \"The Hunger Games\" films and is known for his high-profile relationship with Miley Cyrus. Chris, however, saw his career soar when he was cast as Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. Fingers crossed Liam catches up to his brother's success sometime soon.\n\nKate Hudson and Oliver Hudson\n\nThere's just no way that the offspring of showbiz veterans like Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson wouldn't have fame in their veins. While older brother Oliver Hudson has enjoyed a somewhat successful career in Hollywood, his sister Kate has become known as the unofficial queen of 2000s the rom-com.\n\nThink \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,\" \"Raising Helen,\" and \"Bride Wars.\" As if acting wasn't enough, Kate helped launch the popular fitness brand Fabletics and she's rumored to be flexing her vocal muscles soon by pivoting into a singing career. Talk about a triple threat!\n\nDave Franco and James Franco\n\nFrom television roles to edgy independent films, actor James Franco is one of Hollywood’s most famous stars. Given his brother’s successful career, it’s no surprise that younger brother Dave would want to follow in his sibling’s footsteps.\n\nDave has starred in popular films such as \"Superbad,\" \"Now You See Me,\" and \"Neighbors.\" While Dave has yet to bag an Oscar nomination like his older brother, he's certainly the Franco brother that people prefer personality-wise. Ouch!\n\nSpike Lee and Joie Lee\n\nThere is no denying that Joie Lee owes a lot of her fame and fortune to the fact that her brother, Spike Lee, is one of the most important filmmakers of the last few decades. Consider the fact that the majority of the movies that Joie has featured in are movies her talented bro directed. Probably her most memorable role came in the 1989 classic \"Do the Right Thing,\" in which she played the character Jade.\n\nAs for Spike, movie fans know the huge impact he's had on the world of movies. He has made so many classics, including the aforementioned \"Do the Right Thing,\" \"Malcolm X,\" \"25th Hour,\" and \"BlacKkKlansman,\" which he won an Academy Award for \"Best Adapted Screenplay.\"\n\nEddie Murphy and Charlie Murphy\n\nWhile Eddie Murphy obviously steals the headlines for his reputation as one of Hollywood's most prolific comedians, his late brother Charlie Murphy also deserves recognition for his contribution to the genre. Looking virtually identical to Eddie, Charlie made a name for himself primarily for his work on the critically acclaimed \"Chappelle's Show.\"\n\nOver the years, Charlie had roles of varying sizes in movies such as \"Mo' Better Blues,\" \"Jungle Fever,\" \"Vampire in Brooklyn,\" \"Night at the Museum,\" \"Norbit,\" and more. Charlie also had some voice roles in video games such as \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\" Sadly, Murphy passed away in 2017 from leukemia.\n\nJohn Turturro and the Turturro Siblings\n\nJohn Turturro has gradually developed a reputation for being one of the most sought-after character actors in all of Hollywood. With an extensive resume including roles in movies like \"Do the Right Thing,\" \"Barton Fink,\" \"Clockers,\" \"The Big Lebowski,\" \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" and many, many more, it's impossible to deny Turturro's contribution to cinema. He's also delighted Apple TV viewers with his role in the hit series \"Severance.\"\n\nAnd he actually comes from a very talented family, with his siblings Nicholas and Aida Turturro also establishing themselves as serious actors. Nicholas has co-starred with his brother on numerous Spike Lee joints, while sister Aida is probably best known for her role as Janice Soprano on the classic HBO series \"The Sopranos.\"\n\nBen Affleck and Casey Affleck\n\nThis might be the quintessential example of a duo where one sibling has clearly outshone the other over the years. There might not be a more famous name in all of Hollywood than Ben Affleck. After all, when you've starred in movies such as \"Good Will Hunting,\" \"Argo,\" \"Batman vs. Superman,\" \"The Town,\" and many more, you know you're doing something right.\n\nNot to mention the fact that Ben is married to one of the world's biggest pop stars in Jennifer Lopez. But we need to give some love to his brother Casey too. Many movie purists would argue that Casey is a far superior actor to brother Ben. And this was all but confirmed in 2017 when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the movie \"Manchester by the Sea.\"\n\nSean Penn and Chris Penn\n\nThere's a sad reason why Sean Penn has eclipsed his brother Chris in the acting realm. And that's most likely due to the fact that Chris's life was tragically cut short when he passed away at just 40 years of age. During the height of his powers, Chris had noteworthy roles in films such as \"Footloose,\" \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"True Romance,\" among others.\n\nAs for Sean, he has had a couple more decades to establish himself as one of Hollywood's true greats. From his role in '80s hits like \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" to winning the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in the movies \"Mystic River\" and \"Milk,\" Sean really has done it all.\n\nDavid Carradine and Keith Carradine\n\nUp until this very day, many would agree that the later actor David Carradine is the most famous out of all of these siblings. He first came to prominence with his role as Caine in the hit 1970s series \"Kung Fu.\" His character even gets name-dropped in \"Pulp Fiction.\" Funnily enough, about a decade later, David had a pretty important role in one of Quentin Tarantino's other movies, playing the titular Bill in the \"Kill Bill\" movies.\n\nEven after his tragic passing, David is still arguably more famous than his brother Keith Carradine. But Keith also deserves recognition for his achievements in the world of acting. The talented character actor famously portrayed Penny's dad in \"The Big Bang Theory,\" and also had noteworthy roles in shows such as \"Deadwood\" and \"Fargo.\"\n\nTimothee Chalamet and Pauline Chalamet\n\nMost people would agree that the biggest actor of the last few years is Timothee Chalamet. After bursting onto the scene with scene-stealing roles in movies like \"Call Me By Your Name\" and \"Lady Bird,\" it was clear that the young man was destined for greatness. Chalamet has become Hollywood's hottest commodity, starring in blockbusters such as \"Dune\" and \"Wonka.\"\n\nBut Timothee's not the only Chalamet with plenty of talent. His sister, Pauline, is also an actress, having had key roles in movies such as \"The King of Staten Island.\" Since 2021, she has been one of the leads of the series \"The Sex Lives of College Girls.\"\n\nBeyonce Knowles-Carter and Solange Knowles\n\nThere might not be a more famous woman in the world than Beyonce. Having already reached household status with the work she did with Destiny's Child, Queen Bey became her own brand when she went solo and dominated the charts with hit after hit, all by herself. To top it all off, she formed one of the biggest power couples in all of pop music, when she tied the knot with rapper Jay-Z.\n\nWhat many people forget though is that she has a sister who is also a really talented singer. Solange Knowles has had nowhere near the level of commercial success that Beyonce has. With that said, she's had a few critically acclaimed albums to her name. She also won a Grammy for Best R&B Performance for her song \"Cranes in the Sky.\"\n\nRio Ferdinand and Anton Ferdinand\n\nAt the peak of his powers, Rio Ferdinand was considered to be one of the best defenders in all of soccer. Integral to Manchester United's success during the 00s, Rio had a stellar partnership with Nemanja Vidic. During his time at the club, Rio won the Premier League six times and triumphed against Chelsea in the Champions League final in 2008.\n\nApart from falling short of expectations with the England national team, Rio basically had a perfect career. His brother Anton also was a professional footballer. However, he had nowhere near the level of success that Rio did. He played for the likes of West Ham United and Queens Park Rangers, but never won a single trophy in his career.\n\nPrince William and Prince Harry\n\nThe question of which of these brothers outshines the other is up for serious debate. On paper, Prince William is the dominant brother of the two, seeing that he is the next line to the British throne and all. With that said Prince Harry has stolen all of the headlines over the last decade.\n\nThis is largely in part due to his highly-publicized marriage to actress Meghan Markle and their subsequent departure from royal duties and relocation to the States. Large parts of the British public look at Harry as something of a pariah, creating a sort of hero-and-villain dynamic between the brothers. But in truth, we think it's probably safe to say that the two brothers are just as famous as one another.\n\nWillow Smith and Jaden Smith\n\nWe'd go as far as to say that Willow and Jaden are famous in equal measures. Sure, Willow had that big hit when she was a kid called \"Whip My Hair,\" but it's Jaden who has had more of a presence on the big screen. The young man has had roles in \"The Karate Kid,\" \"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\" and \"After Earth,\" to name a few.\n\nThere is no denying though that the prime reason for their fame is because they are the offspring of one of Hollywood's most powerful couples - Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. Despite being two of the most famous nepo-babies in all of Hollywood, Jaden and Willow are determined to distance themselves from the public eye in the future.\n\nShirley Maclaine and Warren Beatty\n\nMany casual moviegoers out there have been unaware for a long time that Shirley Maclaine and Warren Beatty are actually siblings. Of course, the two have had different surnames for many, many decades, so that has something to do with it. Originally, it's safe to say that Shirley was the more famous of the two.\n\nAfter all, she was the star of classic movies such as \"The Apartment\" and \"Around the World in 80 Days.\" Eventually, though, Warren took the reigns and became a household name too, starring in movies like \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and \"Bugsy.\" Warren stole the headlines in more recent times, albeit for negative reasons. Of course, he was at the center of the Moonlight-La La Land Oscar fiasco.\n\nSerena Williams and Venus Williams\n\nThis is the perfect example of a sibling rivalry that is rooted in love and respect. Serena and Venus Williams have always been in each other's corner. That of course, is when they weren't playing each other on center court. The two sisters have had some of the most epic contests together that the world of tennis has ever seen.\n\nIn 2017, Serena beat Venus to win her 23rd Grand Slam, the second most of all time. But don't discount Venus. She also has seven Grand Slams to her name and was at one point the world number one. Despite all of this, the sisters still love each other more than ever.\n\nCatherine, Princess of Wales, and Pippa Middleton\n\nUnlike the dynamic between Prince William and Prince Harry, there is no contest as to who is the more famous out of these two siblings. Of course, Kate Middleton (known these days as Catherine, Princess of Wales) is a lot more well-known than her sister, Pippa, primarily because she has been married to William, meaning that she will be Queen Consort once he eventually becomes king.\n\nPippa has commented on her fame, saying, \"It is a bit startling to achieve global recognition before the age of 30 on account of your sister, your brother-in-law, and your bottom.\" Despite the way their lives have changed, Kate and Pippa remain remarkably close.\n\nJessica Simpson and Ashlee Simpson\n\nThere is certainly one sibling here that is the more famous of the two. Jessica Simpson has often been considered to be a worthy rival to Britney Spears, mainly due to a respectable string of hit singles she released a few decades ago. Jessica also reached fame on TV when she had one of the early reality TV shows with her ex-husband Nick Lachey.\n\nSister Ashlee has also seen her fair share of fame and fortune over the years. Having varying levels of success in singing, acting, and beyond, Ashlee is probably best known for her lead role in the series \"7th Heaven.\" She has also had some high-profile marriages, having once been married to musician Pete Wentz. Now she's married to musician Evan Ross.\n\nAriana Grande and Frankie Grande\n\nIs there a more influential singer over the last decade than Ariana Grande? Between her hugely successful albums and her high-profile relationships with the likes of Mac Miller, Pete Davidson, and Big Sean, the girl from Boca Raton seems to have done it all. But many casual fans don't realize that her older half-brother, Frankie Grande, also has developed a decent following in his field.\n\nFrankie has been a big hit on Broadway, having starred in shows like \"Mamma Mia!\" and \"Rock of Ages.\" He has also made a big splash on social media, with successful YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter accounts. Frankie's also been a reality TV hit, showing up on season 16 of \"Big Brother.\"\n\nBenji Madden and Joel Madden\n\nAt face value, it's nearly impossible to tell the difference between Benji and Joe Madden. Apart from a hiatus that lasted a handful of years, Good Charlotte is still actively performing until this very day. But the two twins at the heart of the band have gone on different trajectories in life. One thing they do have in common is that they are both family men.\n\nJoel has settled down with Nicole Richie, and together, they have a son by the name of Sparrow. As for Benji, he tied the knot with none other than Cameron Diaz. The power couple has been married for about a decade now, and their relationship went to a whole other level when they welcomed their first child into the world - a girl by the name of Raddix.\n\nKelly Osbourne and Jack Osbourne\n\nEarly on, there wasn't much difference between Kelly and Jack Osbourne in terms of how famous they were. This was in large part due to the fact that they were stars of one of the early reality TV shows, \"The Osbournes.\" From day one, they have been on the edge of Hollywood, being the children of one of rock's most iconic stars, Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nSince then, it's safe to say that Kelly has been the Osbourne sibling who has had more hunger to stay relevant and in the public eye. Over the years, she has had varying levels of success in many fields. These include as an actress, a reality TV host, a singer, and even as a fashion designer.\n\nParis Hilton and Nicky Hilton\n\nWhile Paris Hilton's rise to fame is shrouded in infamy at this point (we won't go into the specifics), her fame, along with her sister Nicky, can be attributed to the fact that they are part of one of the most successful families in the world of hospitality. Although family members like Kathy Hilton, Kyle, and Kim Richards have been popular reality TV stars over the years, Paris and Nicky have chosen to find success elsewhere in life.\n\nOf course, Paris has had plenty of success as a socialite, a businesswoman, a model, and even as a DJ. Despite the fact that the sisters have lived on either side of the country for years now, they have managed to maintain a close bond.\n\nScarlett Johansson and Hunter Johansson\n\nThere is no denying that the more famous sibling out of these two is Scarlet Johannson. In fact, many would agree that she is one of the most recognizable faces in all of Hollywood. This is in large part due to her role as Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Not to mention the fact that her movies have grossed more than $14 billion worldwide, making her the highest-grossing actor of all time!\n\nBut Scarlet's brother Hunter also happens to be an actor, albeit on a much smaller scale. Up until today, Hunter has had two acting credits to his name, appearing on Entertainment Tonight all the way back in 1981 and \"Manny and Lo\" in 1996. He's still waiting for his big break."
