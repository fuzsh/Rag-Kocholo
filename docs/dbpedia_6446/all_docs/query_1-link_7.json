Frank Fabrega said. Police said he was 40 years old.\n\nThere were no obvious signs of foul play, Fabrega said.\n\n“The Penn family would appreciate the media’s respect of their privacy during this difficult time,” Mara Buxbaum, Sean Penn’s publicist, said in a statement.\n\nPenn’s body was found inside a four-story condominium complex near the beach on Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica. Police were called to the condominium complex by someone from within the building, Fabrega said.\n\nAn autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death, authorities said.\n\nChris Penn’s credits included “Mulholland Falls,” “Rumble Fish,” “All the Right Moves,” “Footloose” and “Rush Hour.” He also played Nice Guy Eddie Cabot in the 1992 Quentin Tarantino crime drama “Reservoir Dogs.”\n\nHis late father, Leo Penn, directed television shows. His mother, Eileen Ryan, is an actress whose credits include “I Am Sam,” “Magnolia” and “Parenthood.” And his brother is musician Michael Penn.\n\nChris Penn’s latest film, “The Darwin Awards,” was scheduled to premiere today at the Sundance Film Festival."
