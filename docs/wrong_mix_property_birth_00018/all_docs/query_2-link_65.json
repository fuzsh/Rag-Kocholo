        "text": "Now that Game of Thrones has finally wrapped, the members of its beloved cast are likely enjoying a little bit of time off before plunging into their next projects. After all that double-crossing, battling, incestuous canoodling, and crying in Westeros, some R&R is in order—and perhaps a break from donning furs, breastplates, and weaponry. However, downtime aside, many of the leading actors—like Emilia Clarke, Sophie Turner, and Maisie Williams—do have interesting projects in the works, some even coming out now. A few are actually choosing to continue on in the action-thriller genre (sans dragons), while others are going in different directions, doing comedies and children’s movies.\n\nBelow, see what the Game of Thrones actors are up to next:\n\nEmilia Clarke (Daenerys)\n\nHer upcoming project, Last Christmas, is slated for a November release. It’s a holiday rom-com based in London, costarring Emma Thompson, Henry Golding, and Michelle Yeoh. Clarke will also star in Above Suspicion, a dark thriller, though it has no release date yet.\n\nKit Harington (Jon Snow)\n\nAs of now, the actor isn’t slated for any upcoming film or TV projects. “I’d like to step away and enjoy the obscurity, cut my hair, make myself less recognizable as the character, and go do some other things with a completely new look and tone,” Harington told Entertainment Weekly.\n\nSophie Turner (Sansa)\n\nIn addition to enjoying life as a newlywed with her husband, Joe Jonas, Turner will star in the upcoming June film Dark Phoenix, the latest in the X-Men franchise. In it, she reprises her role as Jean Grey, who begins to develop powers that turn her evil (turning into the Dark Phoenix). The rest of the X-Men must then decide “if the life of a team member is worth more than all the people living in the world.” She is also set to star in the drama Heavy and the thriller Broken Soldier.\n\nMaisie Williams (Arya)\n\nThe actress will star in The New Mutants in 2020. It’s a horror film about five mutants who discover their abilities while being held against their will in a secret facility and attempt to escape. She is also on board for The Owners, a thriller about a group of friends who plot a burglary that goes out of control.\n\nPeter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister)\n\nDinklage is taking a brief rest from acting in favor of voice acting for children’s movies: He will lend his voice to August’s The Angry Birds Movie 2, as well as The Croods 2, releasing in 2020. He will have film roles, though, in The Thicket, a dark crime drama, and The Dwarf, which follows “a Machiavellian dwarf in a medieval Italian court that brings the kingdom to the brink of ruin by manipulating the prince he serves.”\n\nLena Headey (Cersei Lannister)\n\nThe actress has a few upcoming films in the works. In June, she will star in The Flood, about a “hardened immigration officer who decides the fate of a dangerous asylum seeker.” Headey will also be a part of two films that are in preproduction: Gunpowder Milkshake and Crooks.\n\nNikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister)\n\nThe actor is starring in Domino at the end of the month, about a police officer in Copenhagen who seeks justice for his partner’s murder. He will continue the murder-mystery momentum with the upcoming flick Suicide Tourist, where he’ll play an insurance detective who investigates the disappearance of a man. On the roster as well are films Notat and The Silencing.\n\nGwendoline Christie (Ser Brienne of Tarth)\n\nChristie has two upcoming films in the works. She will star in The Personal History of David Copperfield alongside Tilda Swinton and Dev Patel, based on the novel by Charles Dickens. In 2020, she will star in The Friend with Dakota Johnson, about a man whose wife is terminally ill and whose best friend moves into their home to help.\n\nIsaac Hempstead Wright (Bran)\n\nThe young actor (and Iron Throne winner) has two films on the roster. The Blue Mauritius is about five international thieves who meet in Cape Town to steal the most valuable stamp in the world. Voyagers is a sci-fi feature about a group of children sent on a space mission to populate a newly discovered planet who then reverts to a primitive colony after their adult captain is killed. (Lord of the Flies vibes.)"
