You are nearly always employed on a freelance/contracted basis and the responsibilities can vary depending on the company and how long the production runs for. Sometimes Performers start out in fringe or small-scale theatre or create their own work, there can be ensemble roles in larger companies or understudy parts. However some Actors and Performers may start in a lead role if they are the right fit for the character. Often Performers will need to do a number of jobs to financially support their acting careers. Find out what you can do between acting jobs with our blog 'What jobs can you do in between theatre jobs to earn' and our Misconception Series blog on having a second job to support your career.\n\nAgent representation for Actors and Performers\n\nMany Actors are represented by an Agent. An Agent puts their clients up for roles they think they are suited for and are often given breakdowns for castings that are not readily available to the public, they will take a percentage of the pay, often between 10% and 20%. You can gain an Agent by writing to them, inviting them to shows that you are in, or asking for a meeting. It’s a good idea to research Agents and apply for those who have ‘open books’, meaning they are actively looking to represent new clients. However, some Actors don’t have an Agent and apply for castings themselves. Read this blog on whether you need an Agent.\n\nHow much can an Actor/Performer earn?\n\nStarting pay can be very low, with some fringe productions employing ‘profit-share’ models, but a small number of star Actors and Performers can receive extremely high wages – for example a pantomime star or West End lead can be paid tens of thousands of pounds per week.\n\nEquity minimum for 2024/2025 is £573 per week, plus food, travel, accommodation and relocation costs.\n\nThe above is a guide. Pay, salary or fee can vary depending on the theatre or company, as well as your personal experience. National institutions or commercial productions can pay in excess of the above, with profit-share or community theatre paying less.\n\nYou can find theatre jobs via The Stage Jobs here\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/actor\n\nhttps://uktheatre.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/110823-UK-Theatre-Equity-Commercial-Theatre-rates-2023-2026-Actor-Musician-rates-only.pdf\n\nhttps://www.backstage.com/uk/magazine/article/how-much-do-actors-get-paid-in-the-uk-74998/\n\nhttps://www.whatsonstage.com/news/how-much-do-west-end-performers-earn-compared-to-broadway_58192/\n\nhttps://www.itc-arts.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Rates-of-Pay-2024-27-Sheet.pdf"
