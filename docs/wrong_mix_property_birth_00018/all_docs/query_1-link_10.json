As a young journalist just getting his start, Dickens encountered a story that would affect him for the rest of his life.\n\nAs his “Sketches by Boz” column is just beginning to find acclaim, young Dickens encounters the wealthy and powerful Charles Wingate. While researching the mysterious businessman, Dickens uncovers a horrific story of corruption and violence, centered on a mutilated prostitute and the murder of her lover. Dickens’s investigation could wreak havoc on Wingate and, more importantly, his beautiful wife Amanda. Dickens, already betrothed to his publisher’s daughter, realizes just how loveless his future marriage will be as he falls in love with Amanda  even as his story threatens to ruin the Wingates."
