        "text": "Since the film was announced, readers and BookTok followers have been desperate to who‚Äôs in the It Ends With Us cast. Now that the trailer is out, we finally know which actors will play Lily, Ryle, Atlas and more characters in Colleen Hoover‚Äôs book adaptation.\n\nIt Ends With Us, which was published in August 2016, is an adult fiction novel by Colleen Hoover, who has also written best-selling titles like Verity, Ugly Love, All Your Perfects and Reminders of Him. The book follows Lily Bloom, a college graduate who moves to Boston, where she meets handsome neurosurgeon, Ryle Kincaid, and reconnects with her old boyfriend and first love, Atlas Corrigan. ‚ÄúEven as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his ‚Äòno dating‚Äô rule, she can‚Äôt help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan ‚Äî her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened,‚Äù the book‚Äôs description reads.\n\nSince it was published in 2016, It Ends With Us has sold more than one million copies across the world and been translated into more than 20 languages. It debuted at number one on The New York Times best sellers list in January 2022 and was number one on Publishers Weekly‚Äôs adult list and number one on its overall list for the first six months of 2022. Hoover credits the recent success of the novel to the #BookTok community on TikTok. A sequel titled It Starts With Us was published in October 2022.\n\nThe trailer of the movie premiered on May 16, 2024, and fans‚Ä¶well they had some thoughts. ‚ÄúLiterally every character casting was wrong,‚Äô wrote one X user, as another one sneered: ‚Äòi hate the way they casted this.‚Äù Another person wrote, ‚ÄúLively looks the same in every damn film. She‚Äôs so boring.‚Äù Though some fans were supportive of the whole thing, with one fan writing, ‚ÄúThey are so perfect for their respective role. I‚Äôm already in tears. FREAKING CANT WAIT.‚Äù\n\nRead on for the It Ends With Us cast so far and the actors playing Lily, Ryle, Atlas and more characters.\n\nIt Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover\n\nWho‚Äôs in the It Ends With Us Cast?\n\nWho‚Äôs in the It Ends With Us cast? Read on for the confirmed actors in the It Ends With Us cast so far.\n\nWho plays Lily Bloom in It Ends With Us?\n\nColleen Hoover announced in an Instagram video in January 2023 that Blake Lively would play Lily in the It Ends With Us movie. Lively is also an executive producer of the film. ‚ÄúWe have a cast and I‚Äôm going to tell you who our Ryle and Lily are,‚Äù Hoover said in the video. ‚ÄúOur Lily is going to be played by Blake Lively. Blake Lively, y‚Äôall! She‚Äôs my dream Lily.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúBlake Lively! Blake Lively! I can‚Äôt say it enough.‚Äù She captioned the video, ‚ÄúCAST ANNOUNCEMENT for #ItEndsWithUsMovie! ‚ù§Ô∏è So grateful to all of you for the support. AND TO YOU, MOM üòç.‚Äù After the announcement, Lively posted a photo of her with red hair on her Instagram Story. (In the It Ends With Us book, Lily is described as a redhead.)\n\nLily, the protagonist of It Ends With Us, is a young college graduate who moves to Boston, Massachusetts, where she opens her own floral business and meets Ryle Kincaid, a neurosurgeon who she starts a serious relationship with. While on a date with Ryle, Lily runs into Atlas Corrigan, her first love and teenage boyfriend who Ryle suspects she still has feelings for.\n\nThere was a little controversy regarding Lively‚Äôs casting, as the actor is more than a decade older than the character she‚Äôs portraying‚Äîthe 23-year-old Lily. Five months after the news of Lively‚Äôs casting, Hoover defended the move but admitted the casting was actually rectifying a mistake made by the author herself. ‚ÄúBack when I wrote It Ends With Us, the new adult [genre] was very popular,‚Äù she said at Book Bonanza, Hoover‚Äôs annual book festival held in Grapevine, Texas, according to Today. ‚ÄúYou were writing college-age characters. That‚Äôs what I was contracted to do.‚Äù The author continued, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that neurosurgeons went to school for 50 years. There‚Äôs not a 20-something neurosurgeon,‚Äù admitting that it was the author‚Äôs fault. ‚ÄúAs I started making this movie, I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòWe need to age them out because I messed up,‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs my fault.‚Äù\n\nHowever, Hoover said she was thrilled with how the on-screen adaptation is coming together. ‚ÄúI got to see the footage they filmed thus far,‚Äù she said, per Today. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a crier. I know that I write emotional books but I‚Äôm not an emotional person. And I cried so much on set.‚Äù Hoover continued, ‚ÄúYou guys are going to be so happy. I‚Äôm extremely happy and now my expectations are up and I‚Äôm going to keep them there.‚Äù\n\nIsabela Ferrer was announced as young Lily on January 16, 2024, according to Deadline.\n\nWho plays Ryle Kincaid in It Ends With Us?\n\nColleen Hoover announced in an Instagram video in January 2023 that Justin Baldoni will play Ryle in the It Ends With Us movie. Baldoni is also the director and an executive producer on the film. ‚ÄúWhen I first met Justin Baldoni, who is directing the film for It Ends With Us, I immediately wanted him to be Ryle,‚Äù Hoover said in the video. ‚ÄúI just had thought that he had what it takes to play that character, and the good news is he‚Äôs going to be Ryle. So we have our Ryle and our Lily. I think Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively have what it takes to bring these characters to life and I cannot wait for you guys to see that happen.‚Äù\n\nShe continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do my best to sneak y‚Äôall as much footage as I can without getting kicked off the set. I‚Äôm so excited y‚Äôall. I can‚Äôt even wrap my mind around this. That I‚Äôm going to to get to go on set, that I got to read the amazing script, and I know y‚Äôall are going to be happy. Y‚Äôall are going to be happy.‚Äù\n\nRyle, a neurosurgeon, is one of Lily Bloom‚Äôs two love interests in It Ends With Us, along with Atlas Corrigan. He is also the older brother of Allysa Kincaid and the brother-in-law of Marshall.\n\nWho plays Allysa in It Ends With Us?\n\nJenny Slate joined the cast as Allysa as Ryle‚Äôs sister, per a Deadline report published on May 1, 2023. Slate most recently co-wrote, produced and voiced the title role for A24‚Äôs stop-motion hit Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, an expansion of a series of short films that were adored on YouTube. She also happened to create the character and show with her ex-husband, Dean Fleischer Camp.\n\nOn her advice for weathering Hollywood and a notoriously judgmental industry, she told The Guardian in February 2023: ‚ÄúI needed to learn how to stop participating in useless self-criticism,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf there are more people looking at you than you‚Äôre used to, that can be wonderful, but while the sun can warm you, it can also burn you.‚Äù\n\nWho plays Atlas Corrigan in It Ends With Us?\n\nWho plays Atlas Corrigan in It Ends With Us?

He told The Hollywood Reporter, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always looked to people like Tina Fey, for the way she was able to create amazing worlds for young performers through projects like Mean Girls, and I want to have kids from my culture to have that level of snappy dialogue and great comedy scenes to perform.\n\nMarshall is Allysa‚Äôs husband in the novel.\n\nWho is the It Ends With Us director?\n\nThe It Ends With Us director is Justin Baldoni.
