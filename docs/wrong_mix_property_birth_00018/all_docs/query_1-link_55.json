        "text": "You can’t get much more Christmassy than Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol.\n\nYet, there can’t be many fictional characters with a real gravestone. But in Shrewsbury’s St Chad’s churchyard lies a weather-worn memorial with Ebenezer Scrooge’s name carved right across its surface.\n\nScrooge’s name was etched into reality when Shrewsbury hosted the 1984 film adaptation of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. The churchyard was the setting for that famous scene where the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come encourages Ebenezer to brush away the freshly fallen snow from the stone, revealing his name and the consequences if he doesn’t change his ways.\n\nEven in daylight, when the jackdaws caw, its atmosphere is spooky. Unfortunately for the cast, this scene was shot at 2.30 in the morning, while the rest of Shrewsbury slept.\n\nThe 1984 film adaptation is one of the most popular versions of this cherished seasonal film, because it starred so many of our favourite actors. George C Scott played Scrooge, Frank Finlay was Jacob Marley, and Angela Pleasence first spooked Scrooge as the Ghost of Christmas Past."
