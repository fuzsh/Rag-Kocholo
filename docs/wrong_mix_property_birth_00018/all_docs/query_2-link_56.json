        "text": "One of the most anticipated new movies to come out this summer would have to be It Ends With Us. The film, which was adapted from the novel of the same name written by Colleen Hoover, has been on the radar for movie lovers (and book lovers) for quite some time now. The book itself has taken over and #bookstagram on social media—something that Alex Drummond even got behind previously. The only thing that has made this movie all the more exciting has been the casting updates. Some very familiar actors and actresses have been taking the lead roles of these already well-known characters. For starters, fans of the Yellowstone prequel 1923 will be thrilled to learn that one familiar face from the franchise will be appearing in the film.\n\nIf you haven't read it, the book follows Lily Bloom, a recent college grad and florist who falls for a brooding and abusive neurosurgeon, Ryle Kincaid. Lily is plagued by questions about her new flame, but the book's drama really ramps up when Lily's old boyfriend and first love, Atlas Corrigan, suddenly reappears in her life. In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Colleen addressed the book's massive success. \"It’s changed lives. Women have given this to friends who needed it.\" So, put on the stovetop popcorn because here's everything you need to know about the It Ends With Us movie and cast.\n\nSome more movie and book magic:"
