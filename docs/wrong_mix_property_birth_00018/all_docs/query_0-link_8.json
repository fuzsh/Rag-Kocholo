        "text": "The first Charles Dickens statue in the UK has been unveiled, on what would have been his 202nd birthday.\n\nThe bronze statue of the writer surrounded by books has been placed in Guildhall Square in Portsmouth, the city in which he was born.\n\nMore than 100 invited guests, including 40 members of the Dickens family, attended.\n\nOne of the youngest members, nine-year-old Oliver Dickens, helped to unveil the Â£140,000 statue.\n\nDickens stipulated that when he died there should be no memorial to his life, apart from his published works.\n\nHowever, professor Tony Pointon, chairman of the Charles Dickens statue committee, said the event marked a \"wonderful day for Portsmouth\".\n\nHe said: \"When we had the idea 20 years ago, we knew the statue had to be in his place of birth.\n\n\"Finally after years of fundraising Charles Dickens and the city are both getting what they deserve.\""
