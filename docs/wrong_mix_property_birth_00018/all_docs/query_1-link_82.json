        "text": "Are you ready for the grand Charles Dickens’ cinematic universe? Well, okay, that’s not really a thing that’s happening… yet. But you can kinda see the gears turning in peoples’ heads when you watch the trailer for “The Artful Dodger.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Reacher’ Season 2 Trailer: Prime Video’s Action Hit Returns With A New Mystery In December\n\nAs seen in the trailer, “The Artful Dodger” serves as a sequel to the Charles Dickens classic, “Oliver Twist.” Picking up well after ‘Twist,’ the new series finds Jack Dawkins, aka the Artful Dodger, living a new, not all that truthful life in Australia. He’s given up his life as a thief and is now attempting to make it as a surgeon. However, things get turned upside down when a person from Dawkins’ past arrives and threatens to expose him. While there are no overt mentions of a larger Dickens universe, you could really see something like that come together if ‘Dodger’ is a hit, right?\n\nThe cast includes Thomas Brodie-Sangster, David Thewlis, Maia Mitchell, Damon Herriman, Tim Minchin, Miranda Tapsell, Susie Porter, Damien Garvey, Kym Gyngell, Vivienne Awosoga, and Albert Latailakepa. “The Artful Dodger” is co-created by James McNamara, David Maher, and David Taylor.\n\nAll episodes of “The Artful Dodger” drop on Hulu on November 29. You can watch the trailer below.\n\nHere’s the synopsis:\n\n“The Artful Dodger” explores the adult double life of Charles Dickens’ famous prince of thieves, Jack Dawkins aka The Artful Dodger, whose fast pickpocketing fingers have turned into the skilled hands of a surgeon. Set in 1850s Australia, in the lively colony of Port Victory, Dodger’s past returns to haunt him with the arrival of Fagin, luring him back into a world of crime. A greater threat – to Dodger’s heart – is Lady Belle, the Governor’s daughter, determined to become the colony’s first female surgeon. From heists to life-and-death surgeries to the harsh realities of the criminal world mingling with the middle ground and gentry, this is a tale of reinvention, betrayal, redemption, and love with a twist."
