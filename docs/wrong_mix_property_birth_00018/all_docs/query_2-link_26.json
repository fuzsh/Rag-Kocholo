        "text": "Harry Potter is officially becoming a HBO series, with seven seasons planned over ten years. The show will inevitably see plenty of iconic roles recast, and as much as we couldn’t imagine anyone else playing certain characters, speculation is already rife on who will be starring in the new franchise - and what to expect from the show.\n\nWhile there has been no official word from HBO on casting - and there's more on potential casting calls for young stars here - but fans have been discussing who will be involved - and one TikTok user, in particular, has gone viral after sharing rumoured casting details. The Harry Potter fan account claims to have \"exclusive information\" about the production - and here’s who is allegedly cast so far…\n\nToby Woolf - Harry Potter\n\nBritish actor Toby is rumoured to be taking over from Daniel Radcliffe as our newest Harry Potter. The actor has previously appeared in Billie Piper’s film Rare Beasts, as well as TV shows including Pistol and The Last Post. He also starred opposite Bella Ramsay in a short film, On the Beaches.\n\nBronte Carmichael - Hermione\n\nBronte is a British actress who already has several movies and TV shows under her belt, having played Leida in Andor, Madeline in Christopher Robin and Martha, one of Varys’ little birds, in Game of Thrones. She most recently was on our screens as young Biddy in the BBC adaptation of Great Expectations.\n\nJoshua Pickering - Ron Weasley\n\nCould this be our next Ron? According to the TikTok insider, Joshua will portray the youngest Weasley brother. Joshua is set to star in Peter Pan and Wendy as John, and previously portrayed Jack in A Discovery of Witches.\n\nTom Felton - Lucius Malfoy\n\nIn a circle of life move, Draco Malfoy himself Tom Felton is apparently set to return to the franchise as Lucius Malfoy, his original character’s cold, posh dad. Since Harry Potter, Tom has appeared in plenty of shows and films, including The Flash.\n\nAdam Driver - Severus Snape\n\nThis is indeed the only possible casting that would ever make sense - and the only actor who we truly wouldn’t be mad to take over from the late, great Alan Rickman - but will Adam Driver really be on board for the ten-year project to play Snape? We hope so!\n\nHelen Mirren - Minerva McGonagall\n\nAs a self-confessed fan of the series, it sounds like Helen is on board to play everyone’s favourite no-nonsense Transfiguration professor. Helen previously hosted a quiz show about the beloved series, so we could certainly see her donning her witch’s hat and cape for the show!\n\nBlair Underwood - Albus Dumbledore\n\nThe viral TikTok video has revealed that Blair is tipped to take over as the twinkly-eyed headmaster of Hogwarts. Blair, 58, has previously starred in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Three Women and When They See Us - but will he be our next Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore? And more importantly, will he ask Harry if he put his name in the goblet of fire CALMLY?\n\nMORE: Emma Thompson has a seriously famous sister - who also starred in Harry Potter!\n\nMORE: Remembering the Harry Potter stars who have died\n\nFans took to the comments to discuss the potential casting, with one writing: \"Tom Felton is obsessed with the franchise. I’m so glad he’s coming back, he’s so genuine. And Adam Drive as Snape - so perfect!\" Another person added: \"If they’re bringing him back they HAVE to bring Evan [Lynch, who played Luna Lovegood] back as Trelawney!\""
