        "text": "Twisters starring Glen Powell has been creating a lot of hype this summer, but when is it coming out? Who is starring in it and what is the film about? Release date, cast and plot explained.\n\nThere’s been a severe lack of environmental thrillers released in cinemas over the last decade, but Twisters has arrived to change all that.\n\nNot only does the tornado movie, starring Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar Jones, hit the exact spot of fear that the 1996 film Twister did when it comes to being whisked into a giant wind vortex, but the cast took method acting to the next level during filming.\n\nDuring production, the cast and crew had to seek shelter as an EF3 tornado spouted just 30 miles from where they were shooting.\n\nListen now on Global Player, the official Heart app: Love Island: The Morning After\n\nSo when is this action-packed film going to release in the UK? Is it connected to the 1996 film? What’s the plot of Twisters and who’s in the full cast? Here’s what we know.\n\nWhen does Twisters (2024) come out?\n\nThe 2024 film Twisters will be released on 17 July 2024 in cinemas across the UK.\n\nRead more: Gladiator 2 trailer, release date, plot and full cast revealed\n\nRead more: The Devil Wears Prada sequel 'in development'\n\nIs 'Twisters' (2024) a remake of 'Twister' (1996)?\n\nWhilst Twisters is technically a sequel to the 1996 film Twister, it will be a completely standalone sequel and you won’t need to have watched the first one to understand the plot.\n\nLead actor Glen Powell described the film to Vogue as \"its own standalone story in the modern day.\" According to him, the only thing that will connect the two films will be the storms.\n\n\"We're not trying to recreate the story from the first one,\" Glen told the magazine, \"It's a completely original story. There are no characters from the original movie back, so it's not really a continuation.\"\n\nWhat's the plot of Twisters (2024)?\n\nFilms buffs can get excited because the screenplay for Twisters has been written by Mark. L Smith, who adapted The Revenant, and Lee Isaac Chung, writer-director of Korean masterpiece Minari.\n\nThe film follows self-proclaimed Tornado Wrangler, Tyer Owens, who’s built himself a career on social media chasing wild storms for fun.\n\nStorm chaser Javi convinces his friend and storm tracker, Kate Cooper, to get out of her safety seat studying meteorology behind a desk and dive into the thick of it.\n\nKate embarks on a journey to test out a new form of technology on tornadoes in Oklahoma.\n\nWith Tyler’s confidence bordering on cockiness and Kate’s reserved nature, the mismatched pair end up chasing the ultimate storm.\n\nWatch the trailer for Twisters below\n\nThe full cast of Twisters\n\nGlen Powell plays Tyler Owens\n\nYou’ll recognise Glen Powell from his hit films Hitman and Anyone But You where he starred opposite Sydney Sweeney.\n\nDaisy Edgar Jones plays Kate Cooper\n\nYou’ll recognise Daisy Edgar Jones from her work in the award-winning series Normal People as well as Banner Under Heaven. She also starred in films Where The Crawdad Sings and modern cult classic Fresh.\n\nAnthony Ramos plays Javi\n\nAnthony Ramos is an actor who specialises in musical theatre and starred in dual roles of John Laurens and Philip Hamilton in the Broadway musical Hamilton.\n\nWith his background, it’s no wonder he’s also appeared in the musical likes of A Star Is Born and In The Heights.\n\nKiernan Shipka plays Addy\n\nIt’s no surprise if you recognise Kiernan Shipka, she’s had a huge career as a child actor, but her most recognisable work is her starring role in The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\n\nDavid Corenswet plays Scott\n\nIf you don’t already know David Corenswet, then you’re about to.\n\nHis career has been speckled with arthouse classics and smaller roles, but in 2025, David will star in Superman: Legacy as Clark Kent himself, so the whole world is about to know his name.\n\nKaty O'Brian plays Dani\n\nYou’ll recognise Katy O’Brian from her numerous roles in Disney and Marvel films as well as television shows such as The Mandalorian, Black Lightening, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\n\nBrandon Perea plays Boone\n\nYou’ll recognise Brandon Perea from his role as Alfonso Sosa on Netflix’s The OA as well as in Jordan Peele’s Oscar-nominated film Nope.\n\nMaura Tierney plays Cathy\n\nYou’ll recognise Maura Tierney from her work over the years in shows such as ER, The Affair, Primal Fear, Liar Liar and most recently The Iron Claw opposite Zac Efron.\n\nYou can find the rest of the talented cast below;\n\nDaryl McCormack (Peaky Blinders) plays Jeb\n\nNik Dodani (Atypical) plays Praveen\n\nHarry Haden-Paton (Downton Abby, The Crown) plays Ben\n\nSasha Lane (Loki) plays Lily\n\nTunde Adebimpe plays Dexter\n\nDavid Born plays Riggs\n\nLaura Poe plays Debra\n\nAustin Bullock plays Manny\n\nStephen Oyoung plays Mike\n\nRead more:"
