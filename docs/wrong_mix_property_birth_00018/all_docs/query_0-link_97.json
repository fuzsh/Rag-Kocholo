        "text": "Hi everyone! Today weâ€™ve got a review from a new FlixChatter contributor Ashley Steiner.\n\nWe both share an appreciation for period dramas, so today weâ€™ve got her review of one of them,\n\nstraight from Telluride By The Sea Film Fest in New England. Thanks Ashley!\n\nIt was a happy coincidence I was able to attend the 15th annual Telluride by the Sea film festival in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in September. Most of the films came straight from the Toronto Film Fest, and 12 Years A Slave was already generating Oscar-worthy buzz; however, I chose to see The Invisible Woman. Iâ€™m such a sucker for period film dramas, and, admittedly, not knowing much about Charles Dickensâ€™ personal life, I couldnâ€™t resist. I wasnâ€™t aware of this beforehand, but the film was based on Claire Tomalinâ€™s book, The Invisible Woman: The Story of Nelly Ternan and Charles Dickens. The film focuses on Dickensâ€™ (Ralph Fiennes, who also directs) early success as a novelist and showcases his desire as an aspiring playwright and actor. Dickens meets Nelly (Felicity Jones), an 18-year-old struggling actress, along with her traveling acting troupe, consisting of her mother and two sisters, beginning Dickensâ€™ and Nellyâ€™s torrid and long-term love affair.\n\nThe film moves back and forth between Nellyâ€™s present and her memories of Dickens, albeit somewhat jarringly. At the beginning we are introduced to an agitated Nelly, furiously walking, alone, alongside the seashore, while simultaneously receiving flashes of children preparing for a school play. Dramatic 19th Century classical violin music accompanies Nellyâ€™s inner turmoil. During her walk, she unexpectedly bumps into an older gentleman, who starts probing her about her work and rumors of her acquaintance with Dickens. Thus begins the confusing and rather long 111 minute The Invisible Woman.\n\nWe soon learn Nelly is a depressed and frustrated married schoolteacher, and is plagued by her past with Dickens. Through her memories, we see glimpses of their time together, starting with the first time they met: acting together in a play. Nelly soon becomes enamored by Dickensâ€™ passion for writing and his vigor for acting. After a few not so subtle hints from Dickensâ€™, Nelly has a heart-to-heart talk with her mother about becoming his mistress, the implications and how her life will change, essentially she would become an invisible woman to society. Nelly concedes and becomes Dickensâ€™ mistress and ultimately muse for Great Expectations. All the while, his wife and multitude of children are left to suffer the aftermath through heated rumors and scandalous tabloids exposing Nelly and Dickensâ€™ affair. Nellyâ€™s gilt is short lived when she discovers she is pregnant with Dickensâ€™ love child. Learning the happy news, Dickensâ€™ publicly separates from his wife, burns any letters or legal documents pertaining to his marriage and whisks Nelly away to France to live our her confinement. Sadly, she miscarries and they are brought back home to England. Through some great epiphany, unbeknownst to the audience, Nelly decides sheâ€™s had enough of Dickensâ€™ and we are thrust back into her present, never to see Dickens again.\n\nThings are obviously strained and tense between Nelly and her husband; however, the audience is still subjected to an unnecessary and jarring love scene. We witness more walking scenes, where itâ€™s half heartedly suggested she works out her guilt and marital frustrations. However, as the film nears a drawn- out conclusion, Nelly seems to make her peace with her affair and admits her true relationship with Dickens to her husband. All seems to be forgiven, and at the very end we learn Nelly has had another son, and he is the star of her play, coincidentally written by Dickens.\n\nIn summary, provided that the script, storyline and direction were lacking, the actors rose above the road blocks and were exceptionally good. However, I truly believe Fiennes shouldâ€™ve stuck with acting rather than overextending himself as the director. The cut scenes were clumsy and downright harsh, and the flip between Nellyâ€™s present and her memories didnâ€™t quite weave a strong enough thread for viewers to jump to a conclusive ending. All in all, this film is, at best, a 2.5 out of 5 reels. If youâ€™re curious to know more about Dickensâ€™ life like I was, feel free to add it to your Netflix queue, but it probably wouldnâ€™t be a shame if itâ€™s #180.\n\n2.5 out of 5 reels"
