        "text": "A Christmas Carol\n\nMy favorite film version of A Christmas Carol is the 1984 made-for-TV version starring George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Faithful to Dickens' original with much of the dialogue lifted right out of the book, this version includes an excellent cast: Susannah York, Roger Rees, David Warner, and Edward Woodward, supporting the cranky Scott who is perfect as Scrooge.\n\nThe film was shot in locations in and around the town of Shrewsbury, England and has the gritty look and feel of early nineteenth-century London. Scrooge's grave from the film can still be seen in the graveyard of St Chad's church (Wikipedia).\n\nBuy it at Amazon.com\n\nMy Other Favorites:\n\nNicholas Nickleby (2002)\n\nExcellent retelling of one of Dickens' best. Starring Charlie Hunnam, Nathan Lane and Christopher Plummer.\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop (2007) Sophie Vavasseur, Derek Jacobi\n\nA Christmas Carol (2009)\n\nFact Sheet\n\nBleak House (2005)\n\nGillian Anderson, Anna Maxwell Martin, Denis Lawson\n\nLittle Dorrit (2008)\n\nClaire Foy, Matthew Macfadyen\n\nGreat Expectations (2012)\n\nGillian Anderson, Douglas Booth, Jack Roth, Ray Winstone\n\nOliver Twist (2005)\n\nBarney Clark, Ben Kingsley, Jeremy Swift\n\nAffiliate Links Disclosure\n\nThe Charles Dickens Page is a member of affiliate programs at Amazon and Zazzle.
