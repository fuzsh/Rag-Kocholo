        "text": "Hello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nIt’s Christmas… time? Yeah, this is one of two birthday presents I received from Stephen, my best mate at school, this year. The other present being ‘Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves’ on DVD. It seems I get Christmas DVDs early for my birthday, which I really don’t mind, as it’s quite fun. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone.\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley.\n\nI’m very saddened that Bernard Hill, who played King Théoden in ‘The Lord of the Rings’ film trilogy by director Peter Jackson, has passed away recently. I was shocked to hear the news, especially as I hoping to meet him in person at the ‘Comic Con Mania Bolton’ event happening on the 18th of May. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nToday, I’m sharing my second to last review from the days when I used to do reviews on Amazon.co.uk. Over the years, I’ve transferred my old Amazon reviews and updated them for ‘Bradley’s Basement’. When my final Amazon review will be shared on my blog remains to be determined. It’s likely I’ll be sharing that review sometime in 2025 for ‘Bradley’s Basement’s 10th anniversary. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nOver the Christmas period, I’ve had the chance to check out two Christmas films that are currently available on Netflix in the UK. This includes the 2022 animated musical film ‘Scrooge: A Christmas Carol’ and the 2018 film ‘The Grinch’. These have been very fascinating films to check out and with varying measures. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nHere we are on the season finale of Series 6 of the new ‘Doctor Who’ TV series. This isn’t a two-part story as you would expect. The finale happens to be a single episode. 😐 This is where theoretically mostly everything that’s been going on in Series 6 of the new ‘Doctor Who’ TV series comes together in the episode. It’s time for ‘The Wedding of River Song’ by Steven Moffat, starring Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor, Karen Gillan as Amy Pond, Arthur Darvill as Rory Williams and Alex Kingston as River Song. This ‘Doctor Who’ episode also features the return of Frances Barber as Madame Kovarian, along with the Silence. There’s also the return of Simon Fisher-Becker as Dorium Maldovar, Ian McNeice as Winston Churchill, Richard Hope as Malokeh and there’s even Simon Callow as Charles Dickens. Was this is a satisfying ‘Doctor Who’ season finale for me? Were all the unanswered questions that went on in Series 6 answered in this episode? ‘The Wedding of River Song’ can be checked out on DVD, Blu-ray and BBC iPlayer. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nHere we are on the third episode of the Christopher Eccleston/Ninth Doctor era of ‘Doctor Who’ called ‘The Unquiet Dead’. And it happens to be the first ‘Doctor Who’ TV episode by Mark Gatiss. 😀 Starring Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose, this ‘Doctor Who’ episode takes us back to Earth’s past where we visit Cardiff in Victorian times. There are ghosts running amok in Cardiff on Christmas Eve in 1869. The Doctor and Rose must solve the ghost mystery with help from author Charles Dickens. Simon Callow guest stars as Mr. Dickens and there’s also Eve Myles who plays Gwyneth. ‘The Unquiet Dead’ can be checked out on DVD, Blu-ray and BBC iPlayer. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nHere’s my latest review on the 1987 film adaptation of ‘Little Dorrit’, based on the novel by Charles Dickens. The 1987 film adaptation of ‘Little Dorrit’ is a two-part film. Each part is about 3 hours long, which makes this a 6-hour film altogether. You’ll probably want to spend two days watching this particular film. 🙂 Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nDuring these unprecedented times – please keep safe – my parents and I have recently found another opportunity to catch up with watching something that we never got to see at the cinema. We saw ‘The Personal History of David Copperfield’ as a download for rent on our home computer. 🙂 Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nIt’s time for a film review that combines both The World of Charles Dickens and Disney together. Here’s my review on the 1997 TV film adaptation of ‘Oliver Twist’. This TV movie was shown in ‘The Wonderful World of Disney’ US programme back in 1997. Like most film adaptations, this differs to what’s in the book. Continue reading →\n\nHello everyone! 🙂\n\nWelcome to ‘Bradley’s Basement’ blog and I’m Tim Bradley!\n\nThis is the season finale of Series 6 in ‘Doctor Who’. It’s a story that should’ve been a two-parter with everything crammed in at the end. It features the return of River Song as well as the Silence. Can the Doctor stop time collapsing with the world now seemingly jumbled up with many time zones? Continue reading →"
