Add $75 onto your ticket and receive a signature La Jolla Playhouse mug.\n\nExperience A Christmas Carol unlike any other—past, present or future. The timeless tale of Ebenezer Scrooge comes to thrilling new life as Tony Award® winner Jefferson Mays (I Am My Own Wife, Gentleman’s Guide…) plays over 50 roles in a virtuosic, master class of a performance that must be seen to be believed. This theatrical achievement comes from the haunting vision of one of Broadway’s most imaginative directors, Michael Arden (Tony-winning Best Revival – Once on this Island).\n\nLa Jolla Playhouse subscribers were the first to see Jefferson Mays’ brilliant performance in the Page To Stage production of I Am My Own Wife in 2001, which went on to win the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award, while Jefferson took home the Tony for Best Actor for his stunning portrayal of over 40 characters. And who can forget the incomparable Michael Arden as Quasimodo in our production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Another beloved Playhouse alum, Tony Award winner Nikki James (The Wiz), joins Jefferson and Michael as Assistant Director.\n\nHow It Works\n\nPurchase a ticket from On the Stage streaming through our La Jolla Playhouse website portal. A portion of your ticket will benefit La Jolla Playhouse.\n\nYou’ll receive an email from On the Stage with your viewing link.\n\nBeginning November 28 at 9pm ET / 6pm PT, when you’re ready, you’ll have 24 hours to watch your performance after activating your link.\n\nPerformance can be watched on any device or cast to your TV.\n\nA Christmas Carol is available for unlimited viewings within a 24-hour period, on or after the opening stream date of November 28, 2020.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is not a La Jolla Playhouse production. We do not have control over ticketing and we are not responsible for the delivery of streaming content. On The Stage is the streaming company for this show, and will be donating a portion of sales to La Jolla Playhouse and their other partners to support non-profit theaters during the pandemic. All sales are final, no refunds.\n\n» Read the Frequently Asked Questions at On the Stage.\n\nWorldwide Digital Lottery for A Christmas Carol\n\nEach day, the A Christmas Carol lottery will offer $15 tickets to 10 randomly selected winners. The lottery will open daily at 12:00 AM ET and close at 11:59 PM ET. Winners will be notified via email the following morning at 11:00 AM ET and will be able to purchase at any time that day.
