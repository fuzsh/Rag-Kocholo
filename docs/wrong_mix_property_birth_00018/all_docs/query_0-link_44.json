        "text": "For spectacular storytelling and an unforgettable performance, book your Simon Callow’s A Christmas Carol tickets\n\nDickens devotee Simon Callow returns in the highly-acclaimed production of A Christmas Carol at the Arts Theatre. One of the most famous and enduring ghost stories around, this morality tale is a festive favourite designed to thrill, frighten and ultimately warm your heart. Having sold-out during its 2012, 2013 and 2016 seasons, this production promises to win over audiences as reliably as ever before.\n\nA Christmas Carol is a one-man show and a theatrical piece of storytelling. Join in the spectacular journey with tight-fisted Ebenezer Scrooge as he is visited by the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future. Travel from graveyards at night to joyous festivities as Scrooge reluctantly walks the path to redemption. The time-honoured story can’t fail to leave you with a cosy Christmassy glow and the reassurance of light and goodness beyond the darkness.\n\nCharles Dickens was an English writer whose oeuvre includes novels hailed as the greatest classics today. His works document his social commentary and show a deep empathy for the human plight. Dickens was born in Portsmouth in 1812 and died in Gads Hill Place in 1870.\n\nSimon Callow is a writer, director and actor whose glittering film, stage and television career spans several decades. He is a devoted admirer of Shakespeare and Dickens, which is evidenced in his roles throughout the years.\n\nThe show’s director and designer is Tom Cairns, who has worked for the Royal Opera House, English National Opera and National Theatre, to name just a few.\n\nA Christmas Carol will have a strictly limited run between December 2018 and January 2019.\n\nChild Friendly\n\nA Christmas Carol is suitable for those aged 8 and above."
