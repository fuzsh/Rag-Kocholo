He delivers an epic performance embodying 50 characters.\" –The Hollywood Reporter\n\nExperience A Christmas Carol unlike any other — past, present, or future. The timeless tale of Ebenezer Scrooge comes to thrilling new life as Tony Award® winner Jefferson Mays (I Am My Own Wife, Gentleman’s Guide …) plays over 50 roles in a virtuosic, master class of a performance that must be seen to be believed. This theatrical achievement comes from the haunting vision of one of Broadway’s most imaginative directors, Michael Arden (Tony-winning Best Revival - Once on this Island).\n\nStaged exclusively for this production and captured live with breathtaking clarity, this must-watch streaming event conjures the powerful spirits of Christmas and brings all the magic of live theater home for the holidays.\n\nOne of the biggest lifelong hurdles as a writer is to find your voice--and learn to love it! In this workshop, through several writing and performance exercises we'll explore all the different ways to encourage your creativity and imagination and let your own authentic voice soar, even through characters and stories that are totally, 100% fictional."
