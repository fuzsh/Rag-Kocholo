        "text": "Tuesday was a day off. A whole day off – no travelling, no interviews, no nothing. Except laundry. Thanks to the recent lack of working washing machines the need to launder was getting rather desperate, with two bulging plastic bags filling my case. But, guess what? The Oyster Point Hotel doesn’t have a guest laundry either! They do, however send out dry cleaning for a same day return, but the thought of sending out so many shorts, pairs of socks, shirts etc was rather a bewildering (not to mention a potentially expensive) prospect. I did a quick online search and discovered that Red Bank has plenty of laundromats, so I could spend my morning watching clothes go round and round. The idea of sending the main components of my two costumes (trousers and frock coats) for dry cleaning was appealing, however, so at 7.30 I bundled them up into the bag, filled out the slip and took them down to reception in plenty of time for the 8 o’clock pick up. As I waited, there was another man at the front desk asking when the local bank would open, and having learned that the answer was 9am, he went into a long a very loud explanation as to why he had to be there (he was getting a large cheque, to pay for a car, that needed preparing, which would take 4 hours to do, and he had to call the dealership first thing). The man behind the desk who was having all of this explained to him looked very relieved when I appeared with my dry cleaning, meaning that he could absent himself from the verbose other.\n\nI went back up to my room, and waited until 8, when the breakfast service started. There were three of us waiting at the podium to be seated. The other two gentlemen were in conversation, or at least one of them was: my loud friend from the front desk was repeating his whole car purchase story once again, in his grating voice, much to the annoyance of the the other guest, who eventually went to find someone to seat and serve us. We all three sat in front of the impressive large window, the loud guy to the left, me in the centre and the third man, who looked as if he was dressed for a day’s business, on the right. The server came out (the same lady who had served me coffee the day before) and asked business man what he would like? He ordered, and added “I am in a hurry this morning, so if it could be fast, thank you'”. She asked the loud man what he required, and he ordered, adding that he also was in a hurry, because he had to be at the bank to pick up a large cheque, because he was buying a new car…….etc.’ She asked me what I would like, and I ordered, without making any demands on her for speed of service. When our respective breakfasts arrived it amused me that mine came first, businessman second and loud gentleman third, which probably was OK, for he had been making a very important and, of course, a very loud call to the car dealer, telling them exactly when he was going to be there, what he needed them to do, and, yes he would have the cheque with him (he was going to the bank first thing). As far as I could tell he was being put on hold a lot, and passed around various different departments. I entered a sort of Zen state, absenting myself from the reality of this verbal barrage, and enjoyed my breakfast in front of a beautiful view.\n\nBack in my room, I bundled all of the laundry up, wrote my blog, answered some emails, and went down to the restaurant again at 10, as my friend Laurel was popping in for another coffee. We sat and chatted at the same table I had occupied two hours before. When Laurel left, I grabbed my laundry, and set off for one of the many Red Bank launderettes, which was situated on The Shrewsbury Road. Why do I mention the name of the road? Well, for its connection to A Christmas Carol. The town of Shrewsbury in England is a beautiful old town with some fine, grand architecture, and it was selected to be the location for George C Scott’s film version of A Christmas Carol. The producers asked St Chad’s church if they could put a fake tombstone among the other graves, complete with EBENEZER SCROOGE engraved on it. The minister had an entrepreneurial mind, for he agreed, on the proviso that it was left there after the production was completed. That stone is now one of the most visited sites in Shrewsbury!\n\nI had a huge amount of quarters at the ready for my morning’s activities and loaded two machines, one with white costume shirts on a hot wash, and one with darks and coloured clothing on a medium wash. Soon both machines were churning around.\n\nI am sure that there is a James Bond novel in which Ian Fleming lovingly describes the sounds of a busy casino: the quiet incantations of the croupiers, the rattle of the ball in a roulette wheel, the occasional gasp of celebration at an unexpected win, and, although this last one was not in the novel, the clatter of coins cascading out of a one-armed bandit machine. As I sat in the laundrette, I felt the same: there was the constant hum of the machines, the electronic beeps as a programme finished, the clunk as doors were opened or closed, and the clatter of coins, as someone fed a $10 bill into the change machine, and the quarters cascaded out. It all had an unchanging and reassuring rhythm to it. After about an hour the clothes were ready, and I carefully folded them all, before slipping them back into the bags and leaving the casino – sorry, laundrette.\n\nNow what to do with my day? I had taken a look at the map earlier that morning, and noticed that there was an impressive looking coastline not far away, along with some parks and trails, so I decided to go and explore there. I set the map and drove along the banks of the river passing some very large and desirable waterside properties. Some were obviously older and elegant houses, respectfully remodelled and extended, whilst others were new, built to show off wealth rather than taste.\n\nMy first visit was to the historic twin lighthouses in the town of Highlands, NJ. The site is on a hill overlooking the ocean below, and has two remarkable octagonal towers, originally built in 1841which protected shipping making its way into New York Harbour.\n\nAs I stood in front of the building, I had a clear view of the Manhattan skyline in the distance. Below me I noticed a long spit of sand, and saw that there was a road running along it, so I decided that I would next go and see what that was all about.\n\nThe sand spit is in fact called Sandy Hook and is 6 miles long. This is not, I should say, the Sandy Hook where the terrible mass shooting of school children took place in 2012.\n\nI drove onto the hook, and found that the whole area was owned and preserved by the National Parks Service, the beaches along the way are wide and, of course, sandy, with grassy dunes behind them – they rather reminded me of the beaches featured in the early scenes of Jaws.\n\nI walked on a beach for a while, and then got back onto the car and drove further up, towards the end. Much of the area is given over to wildlife and deer roamed across the road and grazed on the verges. At one time a beautiful russet-coloured fox ambled out in front of me, stopped, looked at me as if inquiring why I was in his road, and then continued on his way. On I drove, passing deserted car carks which I imagined would be overflowing with cars during the summer. I was glad that it was December, and that I almost had the park to myself.\n\nAs I got near to the end there were suddenly buildings. To my left there was what appeared to be a ghost town of large wooden houses, obviously historic, obviously once grand, but now collapsing in disrepair with great gashes in their roofs and decks under porches collapsed. To my right were even starker buildings, great concrete gun emplacements, again collapsing and decaying.\n\nThis area was Fort Hancock, an area that had been used for the defence of New York since the days of the Revolutionary War, and on through the Second World War. In the 1950s defence missiles were stationed on Sandy Hook, and a few are still there in remembrance of those times.\n\nI drove to the furthermost carpark, and started to walk through the dunes, leaving the scars of war behind me, and simply enjoying the nature and the fresh air. I walked and walked until I came upon a flat beach, and there before me was New York City. In the foreground, well, actually the forewater, were two buoys, green and red, with their bells tolling mournfully as they rose and fell with the waves.\n\nAs I looked towards Manhattan, and those bells tolled, I had all sorts of confusing emotions about the horror of 9-11 as well as memories of the events at Sandy Hook, Connecticut. A few years ago I was privileged enough to attend a rehearsal of a production of A Christmas Carol, that was being staged as a benefit and memorial to the survivors of the massacre, and actually met parents of some of the students involved. It was one of the most moving days of my life.\n\nI walked back through the dunes to my car, and made my way along the hook and back to the mainland, back to Red Bank, back to the Oyster Point Hotel. It had been an amazing day, and I had loved the nature and beauty of the coast, and been surprised at my reaction to what I saw.\n\nIn the hotel I returned to the mundane, unpacking the laundry and putting it into my suitcase for the rest of my tour. I watched the movie The Majestic (inspired by my visit to The Cinema Arts Centre the previous weekend), and at 7.30 I went to the restaurant where I treated myself to a delicious dinner of glazed salmon, served with chestnuts, and rice, followed by an apple bread pudding. A lovely way to bring the day to a close.\n\nOn Wednesday I am on the road again, heading further south, to Winterthur.\n\nAfter a very hectic start to this trip, with double performing days on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Monday saw me wake with the knowledge that I had a day off. I did have a couple of interviews to do, and a short drive ahead of me, but I fully intended to embrace the luxury of inactivity.\n\nFor breakfast I chose a continental platter, with meats, cheeses and a hard boiled egg, which was delicious, washed down with fresh orange juice and, of course, coffee. Back in my room I watched a bit of TV, and packed my cases until 10.00 arrived and I called Erin, a journalist who would be writing a feature about my forthcoming show in Nashua, New Hampshire. We talked for around thirty minutes, as I paced around the room, and it was a fun chat. Erin is involved with writing musical theatre, so was very interested in the theatrical aspect of what I do, although we did discuss the Dickens family, and Charles’ work too.\n\nThe interview done, I finished packing and checked out of room 210 and descended to the parking garage to load up the car. Once the driver’s seat had slid into place, I selected reverse and looked at the video monitor, and remembered that the rear-facing camera was very dirty and I couldn’t see anything at all. I jumped out to clean the lens, but couldn’t immediately see it, so decided to set off anyway, and deal with the problem later.\n\nThe other issue with my Mitsubishi was the navigation system, I found it very difficult to find my way through city streets, it not being clear which turn I should be taking, so the first part of my journey, getting out of Worcester, was a little longer than I had hoped for.\n\nI was only driving to Nashua, a journey of less than an hour, and the roads were relatively clear, and the weather was beautiful. I sped past signs to the various New England towns that share their names with old England ones, and gradually found settings on the navigation system that gave me a much clearer sense of where I was going (complete with intersection numbers, which had been lacking before). I also tried to look at other cars, as I passed them or they passed me, to see if I could find the location of those pesky reversing cameras, but had no luck.\n\nSoon I was passing Lowell, and on towards Nashua where I pulled up outside the Courtyard at Marriott which would be my home for the next three nights. Before going in, I did an internet search on my phone and at last discovered where the camera was located,hidden under a sculptured part of the boot (trunk) door. A single wipe with my fingertip, and I would be able to reverse out of the parking place later in safety.\n\nI took my cases into the lobby, It was 12pm, but there was a room available. Indeed, I was given a choice as to whether I wanted a low room or a high one, but as the hotel only had 4 floors it didn’t seem to make too much difference.\n\nMy first job was to effect repairs to my frock coat and waistcoat by re-attaching the buttons that had failed during my performances of the day before. The stitching on a few other buttons (probably previous amateur repairs by me) was looking a little suspect too, so I pre-emptively strengthened them, before hanging the costumes up in the small wardrobe..\n\nFor the rest of the afternoon I did nothing. I stayed in the room and rested. I did have a video call to home, and chatted to Liz and the girls just before their bedtime, which was lovely, and at 2.30 had another interview call, but basically Mr Dickens was VERY lazy.\n\nI had been invited to dinner with Sandy Belknap, so at around 6 I had a shower to wake myself up. attached to the wall were three plastic bottles, presumably containing shower-gel, shampoo and conditioner, but the product details were printed in pale green, against on an ever so slightly darker olive green background, so I have no idea as to which product I was using!\n\nSandy has not only looked after the PR for most of my shows in Nashua over the years, and assisted me and Bob Byers with the production and distribution of my film version of the show, but she has also become an invaluable and close friend. Sandy’s house was only a 10 minute drive away and it was lovely to see her and catch up with our respective news from two years (I didn’t manage to have a performance in Nashua last year, due to my bout of Covid 19). We also talked about the show on Tuesday evening, which was due to be held in the brand new Nashua Performing Arts Centre, and for which ticket sales have soared, over 600 currently booked!\n\nSandy had prepared a delicious chicken dish, with mashed potatoes and green beans, as well as some leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving. When we had cleared our plates Sandy suggested that we take a stroll around the neighbourhood to look at the Christmas lights that were appearing, before returning for dessert. Outside the sky was clear and a bright full moon shone, apparently in America it is known as the Beaver Moon because it is at this time of year that the nocturnal creatures are particularly active in building their dams in preparation for the winter hibernation.\n\nBack to the house and we ate a spiced pear cake with ice cream and I had a coffee, before saying goodbye, and heading back to The Marriot for an early night.\n\nIt is strange preparing for a show as big as the Nashua one is going to be, for the fact that it is a large venue and audience doesn’t actually make any difference to the performance itself: physically it is the same challenge, it begins with ‘Marley was dead, to begin with’, it ends with ‘God bless us every one!’ and it lasts around 75 minutes, but there is a sense of responsibility for the occasion and the audience, which brings with it an extra layer of anticipation and excitement. I enjoy all of the spaces that I am fortunate enough to play, the intimacy of a stage like that at Vaillancourts, the history and friendship at Burlington, and the large spaces of stage to roam about on, in a purpose-built auditorium such as I will have at my disposal at Nashua.\n\nI am a lucky boy to have so many opportunities to indulge a passion that has been present within me since childhood and to show off my craft.\n\nOn Tuesday morning it was time to pack up and leave California for this year. My flight was at 8.00am, and I wanted to be at the airport good and early, so I decided to leave the hotel at 5.30 (which with my ongoing confused sleep patterns would not be a problem).\n\nWhen I had dropped the car off for parking on Monday afternoon I had mentioned that I would need an early departure, and would someone be there to fetch the vehicle for me? I had been assured that the vehicle would ready, and sure enough as I pulled my bags into the lobby, there was the car outside the door, waiting for me.\n\nI was loading my bags in when a young man approached me, to check that I was indeed the owner, or at least the temporary custodian, of that particular vehicle, and after we had gone through the official rigmarole we began to chat. I pointed out to him that the car projects a little GMC logo onto the floor beneath the rear bumper, and I had no idea why.\n\n‘Is it for your foot?’ he asked, and then mused quietly: ‘it may be for your foot.’ I had no idea what he could be talking about, until he waved his foot over the image and the boot (trunk) magically opened! I have never seen anything like this before, so I shut the boot again and then waved my foot over the light and was rewarded with a clunk and a whir. I love how car manufacturers feel the need to solve problems that you never knew existed. In this case, I can see the benefit, especially if you have a large arm full of shopping, and just need the boot to open, but the system is a little too fussy, pernickety one may say – it doesn’t work if you simply place your foot on the floor, no, you have to hover it in the air, about half way between the ground and the chassis, which could cause anyone with a heavy bundle of goods to topple over in a most undignified manner.\n\nJason and I chatted for a little longer, and then I set off into the darkness, headed for John Wayne airport, a drive of only 30 minutes or so. Actually, the day promised to be one of minor connections with the past, for when I was last performing in California it was at The Rogers Gardens plant nursery, and my hotel had been just across the street from John Wayne. Of course this is the airport that I should have flown into on Friday, if it had not been for the various delays.\n\nHaving filled the car with fuel, and left it in the Hertz garage (ensuring that I had all of my belongings), I checked in, cleared security and then found a restaurant open for breakfast. With breakfast over I walked up and down the terminal for a while, as I had built in SO much extra time to my schedule. With about twenty minutes to go before the flight was due to board, I went to the restroom, and into a cubicle, where I had quite a shock (it’s ok, nothing alarming, keep reading). I had just taken a seat (I really am trying to be as delicate as I can here), when a lady, with a cultured clear voice, and very close at hand said ‘Hello!’ politely. I almost jumped out of my skin. Throughout the terminal a recording was played, by the CEO of the airport, or the mayor of Orange County, or someone, extolling the virtues of the region and encouraging visitors to try the award winning restaurants, the miles of sandy beaches and the fantastic shopping opportunities, and she began her chat with a this most welcoming and personal ‘hello’. In that particular stall, in that particular rest room there was a speaker right over the top, meaning that the voice came through with no distortion, making it sound as if I was being talked to very personally!\n\nOnce on the plane I dutifully watched the safety video, and a thought came into my mind, which was this: on all flights the cabin crew insist that you listen to the briefing and watch the video because, ‘although you may be a frequent flyer, all aircraft are different’. I understand that, but the video shown by United Airlines is exactly the same on every flight. It is slickly produced and filmed, with a little humour to keep the interest, but in less than a week I have flown on three different makes of plane and the video was the same for each. The cabin crew do not stand in the aisles now to indicate exits. As an experienced flier I do always make a point of checking out the nearest exit, but other than that I don’t see any difference between briefing these days, so do not tend to give my full attention to the screen.\n\nWe took off at 8am, circled to the south and then headed west over Arizona and on towards Texas: miles and miles of nothing, just wild, uninhabited mountains and then desert. The flight was a little under two hours, so not too arduous, and as we began our descent into Houston, another little memory from my travelling past came to me, for one of my very first appearances was at the Galveston Dickens Festival in 1994, and Houston was my first port of call. I remember feeling very very nervous as I flew in back then, wondering if I would be able to give the audiences and organisers what they wanted, not actually knowing if I had the ability and confidence to carry the whole thing off. It was quite a leap of faith for me.\n\nAt Houston airport I had over an hour to change gates so there was no rush, in fact we even arrived at our gate early. I took the opportunity to fully charge my phone as I waited for my second flight, as I would need it for navigation purposes later that evening, and I didn’t want to be in the same situation as I had been in Long Beach on Monday.\n\nThe second flight of the day was back to Newark, and it was a full one. My seat was right at the back, and once again I had decided to travel with my mask on. During a long day of flying the ear loops began to get very uncomfortable, but I had discovered on the trip from England that if I had my headphones on, I could hook the loops over them thus easing the pain!\n\nIncidentally, at this point I need to confess to a falsehood earlier in this post (which I wrote as I waited to board in Houston). I watched the safety briefing more attentively this time and noticed that United Airlines DO in fact edit in a picture of the particular plane that you are travelling on, with an explanation of exits, slides and rafts etc. But, I am sure many, like me, simply assume that the video is a generic one across the fleet and don’t bother to watch. In the current case I was glad that I did, for being at the rear of the plane my nearest exits were just behind me, but the video specifically said that those doors would not be used, so in case of an emergency I would need to make my forward to the wing exits.\n\nThe aircraft was a nice shiny new 737 Max, with seat-back entertainment, so I was able to settle in for a couple of movies, the first of which was ‘The Boat That Rocked’ which I haven’t watched for a few years now. It is a really fun film (apart from Kenneth Branagh playing a rather stereotypical British government minister bent on banning the pirate radio stations of the ’60s and ’70s), The saddest thing about the movie was to watch the beautiful performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman – such a tragic loss.\n\nWhen the film finished there was still over an hour left, so continuing the musical theme I started to watch Bohemian Rhapsody again (I only seem to watch it on planes). I was into the last 45 minutes, building up to the amazing recreation of the Live Aid concert as we touched down at Newark. I had a little bonus viewing time, as our arrival gate was in use and we had to wait for ten minutes, but I didn’t quite get to the end. I, of course, had no connection or deadline to make, so could just sit calmly in my seat until it was time to disembark, but thanks to the delay on the tarmac others were getting very nervous and crowded into the aisle, so that they could run through the terminal in an attempt to catch another plane.\n\nMy day of untroubled travelling continued, as I collected my bag and joined a shuttle bus which took me to the car rental facility, where I was introduced to a very nice white Jeep Compass, which will be my companion for the rest of the week.\n\nOur relationship got off to a slightly rocky start, for as soon as I started on the freeway I noticed that the steering seemed rather wayward, and a quick glance at the dash display informed me that the front left tyre had been inflated to 55 psi, whereas all the others were at a much more conventional 35. I found a petrol station along the way and deflated the tyre to the correct figure, and resumed my journey with a much more compliant car.\n\nI had an hour’s journey ahead of me, to Bob and Pam’s beautiful and remote cabin overlooking the Delaware River. I have stayed there a few times now, not least last December as I recovered from Covid, and it is a beautifully calming, nurturing and homely place. It was very dark as I arrived and the wildlife in the woods were in full song. Above, a slender crescent moon glowed with a rich deep orange light, making it look like a slice of apricot, and the stars shone vividly.\n\nI hadn’t been sure what provisions would be at the cabin, so I had bought a pizza at the petrol station. I put it in the oven, then watched the last 45 minutes of Bohemian Rhapsody on my laptop, before spending the rest of the evening watching various YouTube clips of Queen concerts and confirming how amazingly the entire cast had captured the band.\n\nHaving lost three hours during my day’s travels, it was late now, and I was tired from having done so little. I hung up my costumes and then retired for the night, hoping that being on Eastern time again, I may wake at a sensible hour on Wednesday morning.\n\nOn Friday 15 September I prepared to fly to the USA once more, to commence my 30th anniversary performance tour, for it was back in 1993 that I first stood alone on a stage and performed A Christmas Carol. I say I prepared on Friday, actually all of my packing was done on Thursday for my taxi was due to pick me up at 4.30 am in order to get me to Heathrow airport in time for a 7.45 flight – it promised to be a long day.\n\nLiz and I were up at 4, and having showered and dressed (making sure to don a pair of bright, colourful socks to bring a smile to security agents and fellow passengers when I have to remove my shoes) and said my goodbyes, I sat in the back of a Toyota Prius which swished along the empty roads and deposited me at Terminal 2 bang on time. The airport was surprisingly busy for that hour of the morning, but the whole process of checking in, dropping bags and clearing security has improved immeasurably in recent years, and I still had plenty of time for a small breakfast before making my way to the departure gate. Sadly, I wasn’t required to take my shoes off, so I never got to show off my new socks, until now:\n\nUnited Airlines fly from a remote concourse, separate from the main terminal, so even though the gate wasn’t posted on the information screens, I took a punt based on previous experience and made my way down the huge escalator, along various moving walkways beneath the taxiways, and back up to ground level again. Sure enough by the time I emerged into the light the screens conformed that I was in the right area, and that my plane was waiting for me at gate B32. Unfortunately, I was also greeted with the news that our flight would be delayed, due to the late arrival of the incoming one (it is also a relief to know that a delay is caused by the need to clean and re-stock a plane, rather than because an engineer has noticed that a self-tapping flange grommet is worn, and may have damaged the male coupling to the wing control, or whatever)\n\nThe delay was not long, but the passengers, and there were a lot of them, were like caged lions, standing in impatient lines, edging forward, desperate to be allowed to sit down again for the next 7 hours. I remained seating, diligently wearing a face mask, following my brush with Covid last year, I had decided to play it safe in airports and on planes this year.\n\nAt last we boarded, and the captain assured us that he would attempt to fly higher and faster to try and make up time (thank heavens that the self-tapping flange grommet was OK: I would have worried about the extra strain on it if it was worn).\n\nAbout thirty minutes late we taxied away from our gate and past the beautiful lines of the Concorde aircraft that still stands proudly in front of the British Airways hanger. One of the great sadness of my life is that never got to fly on Concorde.\n\nThe flight was fairly uneventful, I watched a couple of films, and it is always fascinating to me how a theme between my choices seem to develop, even though I make no conscious decision to link them. On Friday my first selection was Jackie featuring Natalie Portman’s remarkable performance of Jackie Kennedy and it was followed by the most recent Bond film, No Time to Die, the tenuous connection being my shows ‘Mr Dickens is Coming’, and ‘Dickens & the Queen’ which will form the central part of this mini tour. In Jackie there is a recreation of the 1962 television documentary in which Mrs Kennedy showed viewers the White House, and talks at length about the Lincoln bedroom. Of course, there is also much coverage in the movie of JFK’s lying in state at the Capitol Building. When Charles Dickens met Queen Victoria he told her of a dream that Abraham Lincoln had just ten days before his assassination, in it he had walked into the Capitol’s East Room and seen a casket draped with the American flag, on asking a solider who had died he was told ‘The President. He was killed by an assassin.’\n\nThe connection with No Time to Die is more obvious, in that Mr Dickens is Coming features a rendition of ‘The Bagman’s Uncle’ from The Pickwick Papers, performed in the style of a James Bond theme.\n\nBack at Heathrow in the early morning I had been worried by the effect that our delay would have on my onward journey, as I had only a couple of hours to clear immigration, collect and re-check my bags, before clearing security again and catch my onward flight to California. Sure enough my heart sank as I walked into the immigration hall and it was filled – completely filled – by a snaking line. There are thirty booths available at Newark Airport, but on Friday afternoon only five were occupied by TSA agents. For 90 minutes I shuffled slowly and by the time I was finally admitted to America (the ‘interview itself lasted as long as it takes to pose for a photo and for a stamp to be thumped into my passport), boarding for my flight to Orange County had closed.\n\nI had warned Bob Byers that there may be a problem, and when it became apparent that we would have to make alternative arrangements he started doing some research back in Dickens Tour HQ, otherwise known as The Byers’ Choice facility in Chalfont. At Newark I was directed to the United Airlines service desk and was told that the next flight to Orange County would be at 6.45pm, which would see me arrive at around midnight, and then a brainwave came to me, ‘Is there an earlier flight to Los Angeles?’ I asked, remembering that in previous years when I had performed in Riverside I had driven from LAX. Sure enough there was a flight at around 2.40, and there was a seat available. I called Bob and he set about changing the car rental reservation, and I was back on track.\n\nI rechecked my bag and then took the monorail system to terminal C and started queueing all over again, this time for security which was by no means as efficient as it had been in London. For the second time that day I edged forward, backwards and forwards, passing the same people every twenty minutes or so, until at last I was able to remove my shoes, belt, watch and belt and committing them to the x-ray machine. Time was tight, and boarding for my flight was getting near, but it would be but a moment before I had my bags back and could get to the gate, however to my astonishment my leather shoulder bag (a present from Liz a few years ago, embossed with my initials) was taken aside for further inspection. That bag has NEVER been inspected before. And now I had to wait again, for there were five bags to be searched before the single agent got onto mine. He was a friendly officer who chatted to each of those people whose property he was searching, which although lovely, was very frustrating in that it all took time. At last he got to my bag, and the trouble was caused by a small silver cigarette case that had belonged to my grandfather (also Gerald) and in which I now carry spare ink cartridges for my fountain pen. Apparently satisfied that all was well he returned my bag and I ran through terminal C (of course my gate was at the very far end) and just managed to join the last of the stragglers boarding the plane\n\nIt was a very full flight and because of the last minute nature of my inclusion onto it, I had to forgo any possibility of sitting next to a window, in fact I was squeezed into a middle seat in a block of three, but I was at least heading towards California.\n\nWith all of my adventures at Newark I hadn’t managed to eat any lunch, so I purchased a ‘Takeoff Snackbox’ which had a little packet of salami slices, some humus, crackers, breadsticks, dried apricots, and the tiniest tiniest Toblerone bar you have ever seen. The flight lasted for a little over five hours and, thankfully, I was able to doze a little bit before we descended through the cloud and smog into Los Angeles airport.\n\nAt baggage claim I was relieved to see my blue suitcase appear on the conveyor belt (there was no reason to suppose that it would get lost, but the way my luck had gone so far that day, I wouldn’t have been surprised), and boarded a shuttle bus to the car rental facility, where I was able to choose my own vehicle, a white GMC Terrain, and set off for Riverside. It being a Friday afternoon, and around 4pm, the Los Angeles freeways were very congested, meaning that a journey that should have taken one hour and twenty five minutes, actually took me over two hours. I didn’t care though, for I was free of airports and airplanes, I was in my own temporary environment and I wasn’t wearing a mask! Eventually I broke away from the gravity of Los Angeles, passed Long Beach, with its palm trees and headed towards the hills that form the backdrop to Riverside.\n\nThe Riverside Dickens Festival (more of them tomorrow) had booked a room for me at the famous and historic, Mission Inn, in the heart of downtown Riverside. I have been fortunate enough to stay, and perform, at The Inn before, and in fact it played a very important role in one of my very early tours, but to know that anecdote you will have to read my new book ‘Gerald Dickens: My Life on the Road With A Christmas Carol’ which hopefully will be published before I return for my November tours.\n\nThe Mission Inn is a wonderful and typical Hacienda-style Californian hotel, with lots of marble and tiles and which has none of the uniformity and predictability of a modern hotel, giving it a real sense of character. On Friday night guests were gathering for a weekend wedding and there was a real sense of excitement, joy, bustle and energy throughout the ground floor. My room was on the fourth (top) floor, and rather being in a faceless corridor, opened out into the open air and looked down upon a courtyard below.\n\nIt was now after 8pm, Pacific time, and it had been more than twenty four hours after I woke back in Oxfordshire.\n\nThe Mission Inn boasts quite a few restaurants, but I chose the simplest and quietest of them, an Italian trattoria, where I had a delicious pasta dish, before finally returning to my room and falling asleep very quickly.\n\nWhen I was a child, in the years long before wall-to-wall kids TV and when there were only 3 channels to chose from, I loved a simple animated programme called Mr Benn. At this point many of my English readers will be smiling fondly and nodding their heads as their minds go back to the early 1970s, whilst my American readers will either be skipping forward to a part of this post that means something to them, or hurriedly Googling ‘Mr Benn’ to see where this is leading; let me help you out. Mr Benn was a respectable gentleman who lived at number 52 Festive Road. He wore a black suit and a bowler hat and presumably was employed in the Civil Service. At the beginning of each episode Mr Benn would walk to a fancy dress shop where a shopkeeper appeared, as if by magic. Mr Benn would choose a costume (a knight, a chef, a caveman, a pirate among many others), and would make his way to the changing room where he would take off his bowler hat, put it on the ground and then magically his suit would disappear to be replaced by the costume. a green door at the back of the changing room stood open and Mr Benn would walk through and into an adventure. It was simple stuff, lasting only five minutes, but I liked it!\n\nOver the Easter weekend I felt a bit like Mr Benn as I put on my Victorian costume for the first time in months, because it felt as if I was returning to an adventure that had happened long ago. The start of 2023 was not easy thanks to various complications stemming from the bout of Covid that I caught during my American tour. I had noticed that one of my eyes had drooped and the pupil in it had shrunk to a much smaller size than its counterpart. I took myself to my doctor who immediately diagnosed Horner’s Syndrome, and I was booked in to hospital with great haste to find the origins of this condition. Horner’s Syndrome in itself is not serious or dangerous, but it is cause by damage to the nerves which run from the brain stem down to your neck and then back to the eye (a rather clumsy piece of engineering, it seems to me!) Damage to those nerves can be caused by all sorts of things, some of which are potentially very serious indeed. I was given a great many tests: blood tests, CT scans, MRI scans and blood pressure tests, and it was the last two that threw up the answer – thanks to Covid, the doctor thought, my blood pressure had soared to catastrophic levels, so much so that one of the arteries in my neck had split causing a small blood clot which fortunately didn’t travel north! The course of treatment was a prescription of blood pressure medication and very regular checks to keep an eye on things.\n\nFortunately, three months on, my blood pressure is back to the levels it should be, and I am feeling healthy and ready to tackle another year, a year which will mark my 30th anniversary of performing A Christmas Carol.\n\nSo, on Good Friday I was channelling my inner Mr Benn for my costume seemed to magically become part of me again and I was ready to go. The weekend commitment was not actually a show, but three days of appearances at our local historical railway museum, the Dicot Railway Centre which is situated only a few miles from our home. When I was writing my book about the Staplehurst rail crash I was fortunate enough to use the centre for some research, including actually driving a steam locomotive. During the holiday weekend the centre were staging a Victorian event, and it seemed like a great opportunity to sell some books and sign some copies.\n\nI arrived at 10.30 on Friday morning, gently making my way past the long queue of public waiting to buy their tickets, as if my top hat were a special pass, and, as I was a little early, I decided to take a ride on the steam train which was waiting at the platform. I sat in a compartment and within a few minutes the whistle blew, the carriages shuddered and we were off. I was clutching a copy of ‘Dickens and Staplehurst: A Biography of a Rail Crash’ and once again wondered how Charles Dickens must have felt as the train left Folkestone on the 9 June 1865. I didn’t realise it at the time, but the locomotive that pulled my train did in fact have a connection to Staplehurst, but more of that later.\n\nThe first train ride took me the length of the centre, and then I boarded another train which took me back to the little square where the museum, cafe and book shop are situated, and which would be my home for the next few days. I was greeted by Sarah, the events manager at Didcot, who had planned this whole idea. As well as selling my books (of which she had bought a huge stock), Sarah had also produced a special edition beer which had been brewed to her own recipe by the Hook Norton Brewery Company, which still brews in the traditional ways, even having the original steam engine which used to power the brewery (indeed, they still fire the engine up once a month). Sarah had christened her beer ‘Off The Rails’ and apparently it had slight notes of orange to give a fresh citrus flavour for the summer months. Some suggested that this ale had a slight taste of marmalade, which may be very suitable for a forthcoming event when the centre is running ‘A Day With Paddington’. So, outside the shop, one end of the table was piled high with my books, and the other with bottles of beer and a tray of little plastic cups filled with free samples for visitors to taste – you can guess which end of the counter was more popular!\n\nThe Didcot Railway Centre is an amazing and vibrant place – it is very much a working museum with the focus very much on renovation and restoration. Some historical railways offer long stretches of line, giving passengers plenty of time to experience the age of steam and even dine on board, but that is as far as the experience goes. Other Rail museums, such as The National Rail Museum in York, have huge sheds with static displays, showing some of the great locomotives of the past in all their glory, but they do not run. All have sheds where restoration and repair work are carried out, but it is rare that you are able to see that. Didcot has all of this and more – the site is a breathing piece of history, the smell of coal and oil and grease and polish pervades the great engine shed (itself a grade 2 listed building dating back to the 1930s) as volunteers go about their daily tasks, and they all do it with a passion and a pride that is rarely seen in the modern world. This is no sterile visitor attraction, it is a visceral experience.\n\nThe books sold well throughout the weekend, and were especially popular with the many enthusiasts who came to the event clutching their cameras. I chatted at length to people who had maybe heard of the story and in some cases researched it for themselves. In one case a young man had actually adapted his own version of The Signalman to be performed and, by chance, he works in Westminster Abbey where Charles is buried in Poet’s Corner.\n\nDuring quieter moments I took the opportunity to walk around the site, marvelling at the engines and watching the Easter Bunny reward the younger visitors with chocolate eggs. It was on one such sojourn that I ran into the team from The Furness Trust who had brought a special guest locomotive to the party.\n\nFurness No 20 is the oldest running standard gauge locomotive in the country, having been built in 1863, and is a beautiful machine to behold, gleaming in her rust-coloured paintwork and highly-polished brass trimmings around the cab. Furness 20 was the engine that pulled my morning train on Friday, and the team mentioned that she had a special connection to the Charles Dickens story. Ten years ago the actor Ralph Fiennes directed and acted in ‘The Invisible Woman’, which is the story of Charles Dickens’ relationship with Ellen Ternan. Those of you who have read my book (and if not, why not?) will know that Ellen was on the train when it crashed just outside the town of Staplehurst, so the accident was featured in the movie, and it was Furness No 20 that pulled the train in those scenes (being the only operative locomotive of the correct age). Whilst I was chatting to the driver, a fellow with splendid muttonchop whiskers, he told me that during the filming of the aftermath of the crash, when he was attending to a lady flung from the wreck, he whispered to her ‘You know what? You should’ve got an earlier train!’ Fiennes, in his Dickens persona, was nearby and apparently hissed ‘this is supposed to be serious!’\n\nOn the last day of the event I happened to be in the staff and volunteers mess having a bite of lunch, having a conversation with Kevin Dare who had been my teacher in all things railway during the research for the book. It turned out that Kevin was on driving duty that day and invited me to join him on the footplate of Furness 20, an opportunity I leapt at! The appropriate permissions were granted and the formal slip of paper signed and I found myself in the cramped open cab of the train, with the furnace glowing and all the pressure gauges reading as they should. Kevin let me sound the whistle before he carefully opened the regulator, released the brakes, and the sheer power of steam began to turn the wheels and we were off. What a joy, what a privilege.\n\nThe weather on Monday was not as kind as it had been over the rest of the weekend, meaning that visitor numbers were lower, so Sarah and I walked around the whole complex looking for possible venues for a performance of ‘The Signalman’ later in the year. There are various sheds that would work, but the most obvious setting to me was in the open air, outside a genuine signal box. Sarah suggested that if I performed there she would bring a locomotive in behind, with steam and smoke creating a wonderful atmosphere at dusk. We do not have a date set as yet, but do watch this space, for it promises to be an exciting prospect.\n\nI was sad to say my final goodbye to all at Didcot for I had really felt like a member of the team during the weekend, and I look forward to co-operating with them all more very soon.\n\nIn Mr Benn, the adventure over, the shopkeeper appears again, as if by magic, and leads our hero back through a door where he finds himself in the changing room again. Mr Benn changes back into his suit and picks up his bowler hat once more and walks back into the shop to hand the costume back. The shopkeeper gives Mr Benn a souvenir of the adventure, and in my case that was a copy of the stylish new guidebook which has just been produced.\n\nWith happy memories of a fun weekend I returned to ‘Festive Road’ and returned to my normal life.\n\nOn Friday it was time to travel again, returning to America for the second part of my 2022 tour. Typically, an international travel day involves departing Heathrow at around 10am, which means packing my cases the night before and getting a taxi at around 6 in the morning. However, on this occasion my flight was not due to depart until 5pm, which gave me plenty of time at home with Liz. My cab was booked for 1.45, so I spent the morning with my cases on the living room floor methodically packing everything that I will need over the next two and a half weeks. Our parting is also difficult, but somehow the extra time on Friday made it more so.\n\nMy cab arrived bang on time (a rather scruffy Toyota Prius, compared to the nice Mercedes that takes the early morning shift) and soon I was being driven around the Oxford ring road, and onto the M40, towards London. There was a fair amount of traffic, but I had plenty of time in hand and arrived at Terminal 2 good and early. I had managed to negotiate the United Airlines check-in app (including not only having to upload my Covid vaccination status, but also being requested to manually type every date and drug supplier of my two original injections plus two boosters), so I was able to stroll straight up to the bag drop counter where my passport was checked, and bag tagged. It suddenly struck me that one is never asked if you have packed your own bag, or if anyone has given you anything to take on board anymore, I wonder when that stopped being a safety requirement?\n\nThe airport didn’t seem to be very busy, and I cleared security quite rapidly, although my roller case was deemed worthy of extra inspection, and when the agent opened it and saw my gold and red costume waistcoats, she let out a loud ‘Ooooooh!’\n\nThe change in my timings was very confusing to me, for having completed the formalities it really felt as if I should go and buy breakfast, because that’s what I always do. Time in an airport, like in a Las Vegas casino, works in a different way to normal life. I mooched around a bit until the signs told me that I should proceed to my gate, which for United means taking an escalator far down into the ground and walking beneath the taxiways before rising into another part of the terminal again. I have made this walk on plenty of occasions, not least back in September when I flew with United, but this time I had a real sense of vertigo as I was taken into the abyss (my online dictionary defines abyss as ‘a deep or seemingly bottomless chasm’, and that is how it felt). I held the rail tightly, aware that I had two United pilots behind me, and I hoped that they didn’t choose today to suffer from the same affliction\n\nThe relative quietness of the airport continued into the satellite terminal, for we appeared to be the only flight departing at that time of day, and there was none of the bustle and excitement that makes airports interesting places to be. I knew from the seat plans on the United app that it was quite a full flight, but I had managed to find myself an aisle seat in the centre section with an empty seat next to me. As regulars know I usually prefer to have a window seat, but other than two rows right at the back of the plane outside the lavatories and galley, United don’t offer window seats to economy passengers, unless they pay an extra $169 for the privilege, which I was not inclined to do – especially as the entire flight would be in darkness, making any possibility of a view fairly unlikely.\n\nI settled into seat 34D and spread myself out, took my shoes off and started to look through the film choices. Then I realised that I should have been in 33D, and sure enough another passenger came along the aisle brandishing her boarding card. 33D, my assigned seat, was full also, so I asked that passenger where he should be (I would have been perfectly happy to go to his correct seat), and he looked at his pass to discover that he should have been in 32C. The cabin became like one of those children’s games where you have to switch tiles about to make a picture, having only one empty square to move into each time. Eventually everyone was settled where they should be, and we were ready to leave.\n\nOnce again, I scrolled through the film listings and for my first choice decided on Shakespear in Love. It is a fun film, and Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow are superb, as is the supporting cast which features some amazing actors such as Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench, Colin Firth, Ben Affleck, Antony Sher, Martin Clunes and that nice butler Carson, from Downton Abbey, playing the nurse in Romeo and Juliet. Now, of course, the main part of the plot is that William Shakespeare falls in love (not really a plot spoiler, the clue is in the title), and at one point he ends up in the bed of Viola de Lesseps, and it was at this moment that the meal service came around, so I paused the film in order to discuss my dining options and to deliberate between chicken or ravioli. I was aware that the flight attendant gave a rather uneasy look at the screen, before serving me quickly and moving on – the scene was of two entwined naked bodies (admittedly, just about artfully decent with sheets), glowing golden in candlelight, in the very heights of passion and extasy, and it looked for all the world that I was watching some x-rated adult movie. The ravioli was nice, though….\n\nMy next two film choices were rather less adult, in fact positively childlike, as I watched ET for the first time in many years, and The Golden Compass, staring Daniel Craig and that nice Mr Carson again, this time as John Faa.\n\nMy final movie selection, which would get me onto the ground, was much more highbrow as I decided to watch Kenneth Branagh’s 1996 film version of Hamlet. It is unabridged production and beautifully told and I enjoyed a great sense of pride in that the location for the castle of Elsinore was Blenheim Palace, just a few miles from our home. If the cast of Shakespeare in Love and The Golden Compass had been stellar, then Hamlet was a real who’s who – Branagh, himself of course, Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Richard Briers, Brian Blessed, Kate Winslet, not to mention cameos from such as Robin Williams, Ken Dodd, Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal, John Mills, Richard Attenborough, John Gielgud, Charlton Heston and even a brief appearance by John Spencer-Churchill, the 11th Ducke of Marlborough, whose house they using top film in.\n\nAs I watched the opening scenes, I was reminded of a passage in A Christmas Carol which is never used in any adaptations, but one which I always enjoy: when the narrator is trying to convince the reader that Jacob Marley really was dead, and. ‘ this must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate’ he goes on to reference Hamlet, saying that: ‘If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet’s Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot—say Saint Paul’s Churchyard for instance—literally to astonish his son’s weak mind’\n\nIn fact, as I continued to watch the scene, the influence of it on Dickens became ever clearer, for the conversation between Hamlets senior and junior is so similar to that between Marley and Scrooge. Each ghost bemoans that they are doomed to an eternity of helpless wandering – Hamlet: ‘I am thy father’s spirit. doom’d for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confined to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature, Are burnt and purged away’, whilst Jacob tells Scrooge, ‘Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!” The ghost of Hamlet’s father says to his son ‘My hour is almost come….lend thy serious hearing to what I shall unfold.’ and Marley says ‘“Hear me! My time is nearly gone.” Charles Dickens was a great admirer of Shakespear, and the opening of A Christmas Carol is testament to that.\n\nI didn’t have enough time in flight to get too far into the plot, but I think that I will download the film so that I can watch it during the rest of my trip.\n\nThe landing at Boston’s Logan airport was uneventful, and in no time we were at the gate at gathering cases, coats and bags. The relative deserted nature of Heathrow was mirrored in America for it seemed as if the London flight was the only international one coming in at that hour. Certainly, the immigration hall was very empty and the whole process was completed in record time, as it always seems to be when I do not have a connection to make. I have been flying into Boston on the Thanksgiving weekend for many years now and know exactly where to go and which bus to board (33 or 55) to take me to the car rental facility. I presented myself at the Hertz Gold member’s office and was directed to a Nissan Pathfinder – an all-wheel drive SUV, in case the snow should begin to fall, which has happened to me here in the past. I settled myself in, fixed the little phone holder, that I had bought a couple of days before, into the air vent and asked the navigation app to take me to the AC Marriott in downtown Worcester.\n\nThis year’s tour, although essentially similar to those of the past, has a few changes – some venues have gone (most sadly The Country Cupboard in Lewisburg PA, which has closed for business during the last year – I will so miss my time there with Missy and KJ), and in other places hotels that have become a home from home to me over the years are no longer open or viable. In Worcester I have traditionally stayed at the Beechwood Hotel, but this year the Vaillancourts had booked me into the Marriott, so I had to concentrate a little more than usual, as I was driving through a part of the city that I do not know well yet. The lobby of the hotel was loud with a variety of parties and conferences taking place, but I was soon checked in and riding to the 4th floor, away from the carousing, where I found myself in a very spacious and superbly stylish room.\n\nI unpacked my costumes and hung them so that the creases could gently fall out before Saturday’s performances, and then went back to the restaurant where I had a superb Thai salmon and rice. As soon as the server heard my accent, he fist-pumped me and said ‘Hey, great result today!’ England had been playing the USA in the football World Cup, and they (you) had held us to a goalless draw. The game had been played while I was at 35,000 feet, but the news reports that I read after landing suggested that England had been pretty woeful, and the game had been a rather dull one.\n\nIt was about 2.30am in my world when I finished my supper, so I went back to my room and fell asleep to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1. There is no rest for the wicked, and on Saturday it is back on stage with two performances of my 2-act version of A Christmas Carol for my good friends at Vaillancourt Folk Art\n\nI arrived back home from Minneapolis on Tuesday morning and on Thursday morning, after just one full day at home, it was time to set off on my travels once more. My first UK venue of the season was to be at The Lit and Phil society in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, a drive of about 4 1/2 hours. When I came to load, I had to think carefully about what I needed for my shows, as I have become used to turning up to a venue in America and having the set all laid out for me. As I was about to drive away, I took one final look at the load and was worried that I didn’t seem to have enough equipment and realised that I had omitted to put the hat rack in, so I went back to the house and fetched it. Hmmm, it still didn’t look right, so I did a mental skim through the script, and discovered that I hadn’t put the little table in either. Back to the prop store to liberate the table and at last I was on my way.\n\nThe weather on Wednesday was foul and the whole drive was carried out in heavy heavy rain, with patches of the road flooded with standing water. To pass the time I discovered a new 8-part podcast about a particular scandal in Formula One racing, dating back to 2007, when one team illegally obtained a complete dossier about a competitor’s car design. The scandal only came to light because the designer of the team with the stollen information sent his wife to a high street copy-shop where she asked them to photocopy the entire 780 pages of information. Unfortunately for her, and the designer, the man who ran the copy shop happened to be a fan of the aggrieved team and emailed them, setting in place the course of events that became known, unimaginatively, as ‘Spygate’.\n\nNewcastle is in the far Northeast of England, so my journey took me through the whole range of countryside that the country has to offer. Earlier in the week my brother and I were discussing the question ‘where does the north begin?’ For my part I always think that when I get to Derby I am in the north of England.\n\nI arrived at my hotel, the Sleeperz at 3.30, which gave to me 90 minutes to relax before I needed to be at the venue, the Literary and Philosophical Society, a very fine and historic library in the heart of the city. I have been performing for the Lit and Phil for the last 5 years, or so, and the routine is a familiar one. The only parking for the hotel is on the street, but fortunately the library itself is only a few doors away, so I did not have to move the car when it was time to leave. I left my room to get into the lift and for a moment forgot that I was back in the UK, rather than in America, for I automatically hit ‘1’ and was surprised when the doors opened into a corridor of rooms – in England the bottom floor, or lobby. level is called the Ground Floor, whereas the 1st floor, is actually the 2nd. In America, of course, the ground floor is the first, and the 2nd is the 2nd. I don’t know why I should have been confused\n\nI walked to the car, unlocked the boot and started to unload the props in the pouring rain and. After three or four trips everything was inside. I was greeted by a poster for my show with the very happy tidings ‘SOLD OUT’ stuck across it.\n\nI laid out my set on the floor, there not being a stage, and as is tradition we played around with various combinations of overhead florescent tubes and standard lamps to create some sort of theatrical atmosphere. The room at The Lit and Phil is not a particularly atmospheric one, but the shows here have always worked very well there, with the enthusiastic Newcastle audience bringing it to life.\n\nWhen everything was set, and before the audience arrived, I popped to the loo, in which there was a notice pinned to the wall: ‘Please do NOT empty the basin when the urinal is flushing. Thank you.’ Goodness, what would happen? The sign had the sort of effect on me that a large red button bearing the legend ‘UNDER NO CIRCUSMTANCES PRESS THIS BUTTON’ You just have to, don’t you? There is an inner curiosity to do the complete opposite, despite the warnings. Fortunately, for the continued stability of the Lit & Phil building, I managed to conquer my rebellious nature and did NOT empty the basin while the urinal was flushing.\n\nI settled myself into my dressing room, actually a large meeting room with a large table, and spent some time going over the extra lines for the 2-act version of A Christmas Carol which I will be performing later in the week. There are not too many additions, but Marley gets a little extra time to tell us that he only has little time and cannot stay, rest or linger. When Scrooge first stands in the snow with the Ghost of Christmas Past, he sees his school friends making their way home and he recognises them all, feeling strangely moved to see and hear them wish each other ‘Merry Christmas!’ There is an extra scene at the school, in which Scrooge’s little sister bounds in, and there are a few extra lines at the start of the second act, when Scrooge wakes expecting to see the second spirit. The wisdom of learning lines that I was not about to use may be debatable, but I was confident that I would be able to perform the very familiar 1 act version without a problem. I also attached black Velcro strips to my frock coat, as I did last year, so that I could create a fully black creature, with no gold waistcoat showing, when the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come makes his first appearance.\n\nI could hear the audience arriving and just before 7pm there was a knock on the door, and it was time to make my way to the back of the room. As I mentioned earlier, the Lit and Phil audiences are always excellent, and this year was no exception. The show went really well, with lots of reaction, leading to a very noisy standing ovation at the end. I took my bows and then lingered in the large room through which the audience exited to chat and answer questions. I had copies of ‘Dickens and Staplehurst’ as well as the DVD version of ‘A Christmas Carol’, and both sold well. It was lovely to discover that there were audience members who had seen me perform at The Word on South Tyneside (the same has been the case the other way round), meaning that although geographically the venues are fairly close, they actually support each other.\n\nWhen the audience had left I changed and loaded up the car (it was still raining hard), and strolled back to my hotel, where I ordered my supper from a local Chinese restaurant and twenty minutes later an Uber Eats courier delivered it to me. I ate in my room and then after a long, but successful, day went to sleep knowing that I had a quite relaxing day ahead of me on Friday.\n\nWednesday marked my first day off since I arrived in America, although it would be fully taken up with travelling from the Midwest to the East coast. I woke very early, I mean VERY early for some reason, but used the morning to get back to Wordle, which I had not played for a few days, and had a very satisfying result of three, and then got to work on writing my blog post.\n\nMy flight was not actually until 1.50, so I had plenty of time throughout the morning to get packed and ready. Over the last few days of performing I had amassed a very large amount of laundry, so after breakfast I went to the hotel’s front desk to get enough quarters to pay for two loads of washing and drying. The lady at the desk looked in her cash register and when we had finished the transaction, the Element Hotel, Mid Town Crossing, had only 75c of quarters left, whilst I had a jingling, jangling bag of booty.\n\nWhen I had flown from Heathrow a week before my large suitcase had been perilously close to the weight limit, so I decided to try and back both of my costumes (the frockcoats and trousers are made from quite thick material and therefore are heavy) into my carry-on roller case, and sure enough I managed to squeeze them all in. I watched TV (avoiding anything political, as it was the day of the Midterm elections and passions were running hot) until the cycles of washing and drying were complete. I carefully folded all 10 of my costume shirts and packed the main case, which was still heavy (note to self, be more careful when packing for the second leg of my trip later this month) and closed everything up.\n\nI checked out at around 11.15, meaning I had plenty of time to fill my car with petrol, get to the car rental return and into the terminal and still allow the recommended 2-hour window before my departure. Before I left, I remembered to leave the radio microphone pack, that I had inadvertently ‘stolen’ from the Westside High School the day before, in an envelope at reception.\n\nThe drive to Eppley Field Airport is a very short one, and I relished it for I had greatly enjoyed my time in the Venza and will miss it. I stopped at a gas station on the way to fill up, and had the usual battle in working out how to open the filler cap in an unfamiliar car. After sitting at the pump for a while looking through the owner’s manual, I finally found a little button low down on the left, about the level of my shin – there would certainly be no possibility of accidentally opening it, which is why, I presume, it is so carefully hidden away.\n\nWhen I put my credit card into the pump it came up with a message that they couldn’t currently process remote card payments and I would have to go into the shop and pay there before filling the tank (this is one of the biggest differences between America and Britain that I come across: in England a driver is trusted enough to be permitted to pay for their fuel after they have filled their tank, rather than having to prepay). At the counter I had to guess how much fuel I was going to need, and I had no idea. Gas prices have been fluctuating wildly across the globe in recent months, and I wasn’t really sure if they are very expensive or back to normal in America at the moment. I also knew that the Venza would need half a tank, but what did that mean? I made a very random guess of $20, and the girl assured me that if I didn’t reach that amount, then the balance would be returned to the card. When the pump clunked to a stop, I had actually put a little over $17 in, so my estimate had been a pretty good one.\n\nAt the Enterprise rental car drop-off, I bade farewell to my trusty steed, that had actually spent most of its time with me stationary in parking lots, thanks to the generosity of Kimberly in Missouri and Frank in Nebraska, and I hauled my luggage to the terminal where I grabbed a bite of lunch, before clearing security and waiting at my gate. It was obviously going to be a very busy flight, and sure enough an announcement was made asking if anyone would like to check their carry-on baggage to free up space in the cabin. I did so, and immediately regretted it, as all of my costumes where in that bag – metaphoric eggs in a metaphoric basket, indeed.\n\nWhen we were called to board, I had a wave of happy nostalgia come over me, as the plane was a Boeing 737. OK, I know this sounds silly, and one aeroplane cabin looks very like another, but when I started touring back in the 1990s the 737 was the staple workhorse of every airline, and I spent so much time in them, quite often flying in costume. Over the years Airbus have supplied many of the carriers, but today I could wallow in memories. One remarkable development in air travel over recent years is the ability to access an airlines database of movies on your phone or tablet, and as I settled into my seat, I perused the choices on offer before selecting ‘The Damned United’, the story of English football manager Brian Clough’s disastrous period in charge of the Leeds United soccer team in 1974 – he only lasted in the post for 44 days, coincidentally the same time that our last Prime Minister survived in her job before being forced to retire. Brian Clough would go on to great success later in his career, winning the European Cup twice with Nottingham Forest: somehow, I don’t foresee such heady heights for Liz Truss, certainly not in Europe…\n\nMy journey from Omaha to Philadelphia was made via Charlotte, North Carolina, which seemed to be a somewhat circuitous route, but when you are blasting through the air at 35,000 feet, geography does not mean much. The view out of the window was truly beautiful as we made our way over either the Nantahala or Pisgah National Forest, a setting sun casting a rich golden glow over the gentle wooded contours below and creating shadows that gave the terrain the look of the swelling waves on an ocean\n\nMy film finished as we approached Charlotte, and I spent the rest of the flight watching a travel programme featuring Stanley Tucci exploring the culinary delights of Rome. During this time the purser on the flight announced the wonderful rewards that would come my way if I signed up for a certain credit card, after which the cabin crew made their way up the aisle with leaflets complete with an application form – does anybody, has anybody, ever taken one of those forms on a flight, and applied? It seems a very archaic method of marketing, and I would be fascinated to know if it actually bears fruit for the financial institution involved, or for the airline.\n\nWe landed at Charlotte airport a little early, and there was a crazy rush to get off, as obviously some other passengers had a very tight connection time. I was able to relax and hold back as I had an hour in hand, and thanks to the America Airlines app I could see that my departure gate was in the same terminal as we were arriving at, which gave me a great sense of peace. I ambled off the plane and made my way from gate B5 to B 15 where there was a huge crowd waiting to board, Actually the large group was made up of passengers for three flights, one to Richmond, Virginia, one for Philly (mine) and one for Vegas. I made sure that I was in the correct mass of humanity, lest I should be erroneously whisked away to Nevada. I might have fun there, but my luggage would be in Philadelphia – to paraphrase the famous saying, ‘what arrives in Philadelphia stays in Philadelphia’.\n\nThe next flight, which would take me back North again was very busy, and the boarding process took a long time. As I stood in the aisle waiting to get back to seat A24, the captain came over the intercom in a somewhat agitate fashion ‘ ‘Hey guys, lets hurry this process up, we have a hurricane coming up from the South and we need to get this thing outta here and out run it! I think he fancied himself as starring in a 2nd World War adventure movie, although passengers did begin to take their seats with a renewed sense of urgency.\n\nFor my second movie choice I watched Ford Vs Ferrari, but the flight was not long enough to finish it, which was a shame. Philadelphia airport was its usual bustling self. I waited at baggage carousel 12, where a screen told me that the luggage from the Charlotte flight would be delivered, but for a long while nothing came, until I noticed a passenger that I recognised pulling his luggage from a different location. I asked him if he had indeed been on the Charlotte flight, and he replied that yes and the baggage was on carousel 10. I made my way there and looked at the screen, which told me that bags from flights arriving from Phoenix, Las Vegas, Dallas and Los Angeles would be delivered there: no mention of Charlotte, but sure enough there were my two cases making their languid way round and round. I collected them, and walked back up to carousel 12 and told the scattering of miserable folk who were forlornly still waiting for their bags that maybe they should try number 10 instead, and off they ran with a renewed sense of hope.\n\nTo get to the car rental garages at Philly you have to wait outside baggage reclaim next to a road, and wave down a courtesy bus for your particular company. Unfortunately, as I arrived at the curb, I saw a Hertz bus disappearing around the corner and so had to wait for quite a while, until another one appeared.\n\nOver the last few years Bob Byers had set me up as Gold member with Hertz which gives me the great privilege of avoiding the lines at the counter and just going straight to a certain area of the garage and choosing my own car. Usually, I go for an SUV, but on this occasion, I spied a rather sleek looking Cheverolet Malibu, and loaded my bags into that and set off for the 40-minute drive to my hotel in the township of Mount Holly. It was almost 9 o’clock when I arrived, so I diverted to an Applebee’s restaurant which was near to the hotel, and had a supper of fish and chips. My accent attracted some attention and soon people were asking where I was from and on my reply of England, one guy said ‘Yep, I thought so! I thought either England or Australia, but you weren’t rude enough to come from Australia, so I figured it must be England!’ The conversation then turned to what I was doing here, and when it was discovered that I performed A Christmas Carol people started suggesting other towns where I should perform, most specifically one in Williams Arizona and another in Old Forge New York, both of which feature railroad journeys after the fashion of The Polar Express. The New York venue is in the heart of the Adirondack mountains, which feature as the setting of the James Bond novel, The Spy Who Loved Me, so it would be fun to go there.\n\nWhen my dinner was finished, I made the short drive to my hotel, another Hilton Garden Inn, and soon was in my room. I unpacked my squashed-up costumes, so that some of the creases would have a chance to hang out overnight, and then gratefully let sleep take me after what had been a very long day off.\n\nAlthough my Friday alarm was set for 5.45 I woke before it and so it was easy to get ready and leave my room by 6.30. I had a three hour drive ahead of me and I was keen to get to Massachusetts by about 10am, therefore I decided to forego a hotel breakfast (as regulars know, this was a painful thing to do) and just grab something on the road. The traffic heading towards New York City was very heavy, even at that early hour, so it was as well that I left when I did.\n\nI crawled and edged and trundled and inched and lumbered and crept, in fact I went so slowly that I would have had time to read a thesaurus if I’d had one to hand. Eventually I was passed New York and the heavy traffic was now filling the opposite carriageway and I could speed up and head towards New England. This is a journey I have done on many occasions, in one direction or the other, and it always brings to mind Charles Dickens’ American Notes, as I pass many of the cities that he visited and commented on.\n\nAfter a while I pulled in at a service station and had a Panera Bread breakfast of oatmeal and fruit and a pastry, washed down with orange juice and coffee, before getting back into the Rogue and continuing north.\n\nMy destination was Old Sturbridge Village, a living museum near Worcester. I have heard a lot about it over the years but have never had the opportunity to visit, and on Friday I was to perform there. I made good time and pulled into the large car park a little after 10. My contact at Sturbridge was Ellen Taviano, with whom I have worked for many years at Winterthur House and Gardens in Delaware. Thanks to staff layoffs and changes during the pandemic, Ellen left Winterthur and took up a position at Sturbridge, heading up the retail operation. Having enjoyed such a close and successful relationship in the past she was keen to get me to to the museum to perform and the September tour proved to be the perfect opportunity. When I arrived, I left a voicemail on Ellen’s phone and made my way to the visitor centre, where the staff welcomed me and showed me into the empty auditorium where I was to perform. I say ‘I was to perform’, but actually I should say ‘where we were to perform’ for today I would be sharing the stage with fellow actor Jennifer Emerson, and this is the day I have been working towards and, yes, sometimes fretting over throughout the tour.\n\nI took a look at the stage and saw that Ellen had placed a few articles of furniture for our set, but some were not quite right, so I took a look back stage and was delighted to find all sorts of bits and pieces that I could chose from Firstly, I pulled a few bits out, and brought them to the stage and as I did a lady dressed in an elegant Victorian gown entered the theatre, and this was Jennifer.\n\nJennifer has a long history in working at museums, interpreting characters and performing a series of her own one-person shows (including her version of A Christmas Carol). She has worked in costume and has directed and taught and is generally a very talented and committed go getter, and is also a member of the Dickens Fellowship.\n\nWhen Ellen had chosen the shows for my visit she had asked for The Signalman (as she ordered plenty of my books), and A Child’s Journey With Dickens, which she had seen me perform at Winterthur. As soon as I saw that on the schedule I got in touch with Bob and suggested that we ask Jennifer to be involved. The performance is based around a speech made in 1912 by Kate Douglas Wiggin recounting the day that she met Charles Dickens on a train bound for Boston. The speech was made when Kate was 55, but the train journey had taken place in 1868, when she had been only 11, and the show features her at both ages. Now, I have performed it, with a degree of success in the past, but really? A balding, bearded Englishman trying to convince a New England audience that he is an 11 year girl from Maine is pushing it somewhat. Back in 2021 the Dickens Fellowship had asked me if I could give a Zoom performance, and I had suggested A Child’s Journey performed on the anniversary of the meeting on the train. One of the positives of the Covid pandemic was that it shrank the world, and people were suddenly communicating in ways that they had never realised possible. This extended to performance, and Id contacted Jennifer to ask her if she would like to work with me on the project. We developed a script together using purely archive material – letters, newspaper articles, memoirs, and of course Kate’s speech itself. As the story involved Dickens’ reading tour, we also featured a scathing review of one of his performances written by Mark Twain. Again the shrinking world had enabled me to ask yet another performer, Mark Dawidziak (who ‘does’ Twain), to record the piece for us – this was going to be a show performed by three actors each of whom specialised in performing on their own! The Zoom performance had been a great success and at the time I had said to Jennifer if there was ever a chance to actually perform it live, then we should grab it. Old Sturbridge Village was that chance.\n\nWe didn’t change the script very much, but had to think about how we would actually stage it. The idea was to have a lectern at one side of the stage where Jennifer would give the speech, as if addressing the guests at Delmonico’s restaurant in 1912, and on the other side would be a desk where I would sit as Dickens, writing letters about the tour, which were slipped into Kate’s dialogue at suitable moments. For example at one time Kate recalled praying fervently that Dickens didn’t suffer the pangs of seasickness as he sailed to America, and on that line I would recite two letters that he wrote from the SS Cuba as he sailed across the Atlantic detailing rough weather and sickness throughout the ship. The writing desk was angled away from where Kate stood, meaning that there was absolutely no connection between the two characters, until the key moment when the child Kate saw Dickens on the train, at which point we both sat next to one another on a small bench at centre stage, representing a seat in the railroad car.\n\nWhen Jennifer arrived we continued foraging for the perfect furniture and when we were satisfied we started a rehearsal, our very first run through together. It went well, we both fumbled a few lines, but the the basic setting and idea seemed to work perfectly and we retired to the green room behind the stage in a state of great excitement\n\nAt 1 o’clock Ellen came to check that we were ready and then went to the stage and introduced us both and we emerged to applause. I welcomed everyone and made a very brief introduction to the show, and then introduced Kate as if I were chairing the meeting of the New York Dickens Fellowship in 1912. And so the show started. Oh, it went well, Jennifer had adopted two very different personas – the 55 year old Kate who had spent a life in education especially in the field of the Kindergarten movement, had a a teacher’s voice and demeanour, direct, factual but kindly, but as soon as she was on the train she became the 11 year old, excited fidgety, crossing and uncrossing her ankles, and gazing at her idol, Charles Dickens. I knew that all of this working superbly, although I could not see her performance as I was turned away, thanks to the laughter and joy coming from the audience. When it came to the moment that she precociously sat next to Dickens and he first saw her there was an instant connection between the two character. The audience responded wonderfully and laughed at all of the appropriate places (including during the Twain voiceover, saying of Dickens ‘His pictures are hardly handsome, and he, like everybody else, is less handsome than his pictures!’ Ouch.\n\nLaughter turned to tears as Dickens asked Kate if she had wanted to go to his reading very much, and she had sobbed, ‘yes more than tongue can tell’ causing Dickens to cry also. Both Jennifer and I had tears in our eyes and we could see members of the audience wiping theirs too.\n\nThe applause at the end was wonderful and we knew that we had created a very special show which had worked just as we’d imagined it.\n\nWith all of the concentration and nerves that had surrounded the first act, it would have been easy to forget that I had The Signalman to perform in the second half and it required quite a mental re-set to get myself prepared for that. Actually I gave a very good performance of it, I think. It was dramatic and tight and the lines flowed well. The audience were hooked and applauded loudly when I had finished. During the applause I gestured to Jennifer (who had taken a seat in the auditorium to watch) and the clapping increased again as we both took more bows.\n\nWhat a wonderful success.\n\nAfter the show Ellen took me to the gift store for a signing session and it was wonderful to see many people who had come to see me in shows at other venues over the years. One man showed me a picture of me posing with his sons and said ‘Yes. that was seven years ago: look how young you look!’ Thanks!\n\nWhen the signing was over I went to find my accommodation for the night. Sturbridge had built a small collection of cabins which were originally to be hotel accommodation for visitors to the museum, but Covid closed them and now they are used for staff, professors and visiting entertainers. My room was large and very comfortable and I slumped onto the bed and dozed a little for an hour or so, before it was time to return to the theatre and get changed ready for the second performance. After a while Jennifer appeared (she had stayed in costume, so hadn’t needed to arrive as early as I), and we chatted about the first show and how it had been received.\n\nSoon Ellen appeared once more to check that all was well, and the evening show was under way. It was a larger audience than the afternoon, and once again they followed the story with rapt attention. I would say that at both performances it took a little while before everyone accepted the premise behind our performance, but it didn’t take long until they were fully involved and were laughing and crying. Once again our closing bows were met with a standing ovation.\n\nThe Signalman was also superbly received, and my most unsubtle plugging of the book was greeted with loud laughter, even applause. What a wonderful, and exciting day, and what a superb way to end what has been a difficult tour, not because of the schedule, or the venues, or the shows, but because I had wanted to be at home in England. I had wanted to file past the Queen’s coffin in Westminster Hall with Liz so that we could pay our respects to the only Monarch we have ever known; to be part of the national mourning. My home-made black arm band had been a token of my respect, but I had so wanted to do more.\n\nAfter another signing session where many friends came to say hello, including Gary and Judi Vaillancourt, I returned to the theatre, got changed and collected all of my props, with the exception of the danger light, which would be collected by someone, sometime. Ellen had booked a restaurant for her, Jennifer, myself and her colleague Jacqui who had been helping with the lights and changing the set between shows. We had a lovely dinner, although conversation was awkward due to a singer who was performing throughout the evening. He was very good and had a wonderful set of songs, but with my tinitus it made hearing conversation extremely problematic.\n\nThe restaurant was emptying as we finished our dinner and it was clear that they wanted to close, so we said our goodbyes and headed back to our respective homes and lodges.\n\nSaturday\n\nOn Saturday I would be flying home, but the morning was taken up to roaming around Old Sturbridge Village, and what an amazing place it is. The attraction was opened in 1946 and featured various historical New England buildings that had been dismantled and moved to the site. Now it covers 200 acres and features 59 properties. There is a blacksmith, a pottery, a cooper and various mills, all working. There are farms with cattle, sheep and pigs, there are demonstrations of 19th century cooking and crafting, and all in all it is a fascinating place to spend a day. On Saturday the sun shone, and I not only visited all of the properties, but also took the trails into woods and across pasture – I even ran a little.\n\nAfter lunch it was time to head to the Logan Airport in Boston and board a 777 to fly home to a different England to the one I left 10 days before.\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\nWednesday had promised to be another relaxing day in the cabin, possibly doing some work on the script for A Child’s Journey With Dickens, until I had received a text the day before from Bob’s son George asking me if I would like to join him for a round of golf (I had mentioned to Bob that I had brought my golf shoes just in case there was time for a round, and he had passed the message on). I readily agreed and George arrived at the cabin to pick me up at 8.45 in readiness for a 9.40 tee off. The course that he had selected was Heron Glenn Golf Club near to the town of Flemington from where I would be collecting a rental car later in the day.\n\nWe arrived at the club in good time and sorted out a set of rental clubs for me, which would provide a perfect excuse for poor play in the early holes, and made our way to the first tee, where another two players introduced themselves as Bill and Michael and told us that they would be playing with us, which turned out to be a good thing as they were able to show us the way around and warn us of hidden areas of rough. They had broad New York accents and George and I tried to guess what they had been during their working lives: we came up with either police officers, or maybe in the newspaper industry. We never did find out.\n\nWe had a wonderful time, I wont go into it hole by hole, but we all played some very good shots and we all played some woeful shots. On the whole George played more good shots than the rest of us, and if we had been competing he would have vanquished us, but we weren’t and instead we all had fun\n\nFrom the golf course I had to pick up a rental car which will be with me until I arrive at Logan airport on Saturday to fly home. We were to go to a Hertz dealership in Flemington, and it took a bit of finding. In our defence the venue didn’t look like a Hertz office. In fact it was a very small car repair shop, with scattered bits of wounded automobiles lying on the ground. The only clue that the office may be part of one of the world’s leading car rental concerns was a tiny sign on the wall outside the office. I walked in and said I was due to collect a car and that my name was Dickens. ‘Ah, yes.’ said the lady in the office, its the white Nissan Rogue, here are the keys. Its got 3/4 of a tank, just drop it off with the same wherever you’re leaving it.’ And that was it! No signatures, no driving licence check, no credit cards: nothing. Easy, but I was not entirely sure that Hertz head office knew that I had their car.\n\nI said goodbye to George, although we’d be meeting up again for dinner, and drove back to the cabin, where I took the Mustang out for one final journey to fill it up with petrol (during my drive to Burlington I’d watched the fuel gauge go down as quickly as the speed went up!) When I returned, I sorrowfully guided it into the garage and said my goodbyes.\n\nGeorge had booked a table for dinner in the town of New Hope, 30 minutes away, in a very smart restaurant overlooking the river. Maura, George’s girlfriend was also there and it was a great pleasure to meet her. She is going to be working with Pam on the administrative side of my tour and she was keen to find out as much as possible as to how it all works. She will be a great asset to the team, I think. We all dined well, I had a spicy Asian trout dish which was absolutely delicious, and it was a very pleasant evening with good company.\n\nI returned to the Cabin for my final night in the woods\n\nTHURSDAY\n\nAlthough I had only one show on Thursday, in the evening, I did have a little extra work to do at Byers’ Choice, for David wanted to record a few promotional videos for the forthcoming Christmas tour. Firstly I sat at a large table and, looking into the camera, cheerily invited people to come and see A Christmas Carol at Byers’ Choice. Next I cheerily asked them to come and see A Christmas Carol at their local venue (this means that sponsors can put their own captions and booking details on the screen.) Then I told people that they may like to buy my book, and finally a piece about my DVD of A Christmas Carol (Yes! It is available this year). When all those short clips had been filmed Dave and I created a mini Byers’ Choice travel show as I walked through the visitor centre pointing out things of interest, especially relating to Charles Dickens and A Christmas Carol.\n\nWhen the filming was finished I said my final goodbyes to Dave, Bob and George (who returned my golf shoes that I’d left in his ca)r, and I set out on the road East, towards Long Island. The traffic wasn’t too bad until I reached the environs of New York City, at which time I inevitably hit long tailbacks – some because of accidents, some because of roadworks and some just due to heavy city congestion. I had plenty of time in hand, though, so it was not a concern.\n\nTo skirt around Manhattan my route took me across the Verrazano Bridge from Staten Island to Brooklyn, and it has to be one of the world’s most truly impressive bridges to be sure, rivalling The Forth Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Sidney Harbour Bridge, and even its near neighbour, the Brooklyn Bridge. The heavy traffic continued onto the misnamed Long Island Expressways but I arrived at the Marriott Hotel in good time. I had stayed at the same venue last Christmas so everything was familiar to me.\n\nI had an hour or so at the hotel before I was due at the East Meadow Library where I was to perform the double bill of The Signalman and Doctor Marigold that evening. The drive to the library was only a matter of minutes and in no time I was greeting my friends from December Jude and her husband Mark, who helped me to unload my costumes and props ready to set up in the small auditorium. The first job was to reconstruct the danger light for The Signalman, using the screws and screwdriver that Dave had sent along with me. Mark used to be involved in Broadway theatre in the tech, set and props fields and as we built the light he was commenting on the construction of it, with a certain sense of admiration, but also with the inevitable ‘Ah, if I’d made this I would have……’\n\nSoon we had the set in place and Jude suggested that we all went to get some dinner before the show, so we piled into Marks huge RAM truck and headed to a lovely Italian restaurant, where we dined alfresco, beneath huge sunshades. I had a simple chicken dish in a white wine and lemon sauce, which was delicious, but I was aware that time was pushing on towards six pm and we were due to start at seven. Mark noticed my unease and offered to drive me back to the Library so that I could finish my preparations in as relaxed way as possible.\n\nThe priority was to do a sound check with Larry, who had looked after my performance in December and who I knew to be a safe pair of hands on the faders, because of that I had also given him the wind sound effect to play during the first half. With the sound check completed and the set checked once more I left the room, so that the audience could take their seats, and went downstairs where I changed in a small staff cafeteria room.\n\nAt seven o’clock Jude came down to say we were holding for 5 minutes as guests were still arriving, but soon everything was in place to begin. Jude opened the door to the auditorium (the seating was raked, and I would be performing on the floor level), and I slipped in behind her, which elicited a round of applause form the audience, to which Jude hissed back at me in a loud pantomime-style whisper ‘you were supposed to stay outside!’ It was all good fun banter, and Jude is a natural entertainer.\n\nWith the introductions completed I started the show. The audience weren’t as responsive during the two performances as some others, there was not the same laughter at Marigold for instance, but oh my they were appreciative and applauded long and loudly afterwards. I learned long ago that audiences respond in different ways and just because there isn’t an instant response, it doesn’t mean that they are not enjoying, or appreciating the performance, and the crowd at East Meadow were a case in point. After Marigold was finished (and, yes, they gasped at the correct moment), I opened the floor up to questions and we had an enjoyable session covering lots of ground, including how do I learn lines? What is my favourite film or TV adaptation of any Dickens novel? (David Lean’s Great Expectations, or the BBC’s Bleak House), and how did I feel about the Queen? which brought the emotions that have been there all week bubbling up to the surface again. Soon it was time to wrap up and I took another round of applause before leaving the room. I loitered outside as the audience left and the questions continued until the library emptied and it was time to pack up my belongings, say my goodbyes and head back to the Marriott where I set my alarm for 5.45, as I had a three hour drive ahead of me to Massachusetts."
