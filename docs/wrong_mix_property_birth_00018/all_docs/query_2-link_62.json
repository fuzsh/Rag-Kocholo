        "text": "AN award-winning detective series is finally coming to the small screen.\n\nA Good Girl's Guide to Murder is set to feature rising star Zain Iqbal. Here’s what we know about him.\n\nHow old is Zain Iqbal?\n\nZain Iqbal from Manchester, UK, grew up in the village of Cheadle, near Stockport in northwest England.\n\nAfter attending university to study economics, the 26-year-old participated in student films and completed the Young Company programme at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre.\n\nHowever, his passion for films outweighed his interest in economics.\n\nPost-graduation, he bravely moved to London to pursue acting.\n\nHis significant breakthrough is in the 2024 novel-based series A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, starring alongside Emma Myers.\n\nBesides acting, Zain is also passionate about boxing and continues to reside in the UK.\n\nWhat has Zain Iqbal been in before?\n\nDespite being labelled a newcomer, Zain has four years experience in the industry\n\nHe has played numerous background roles as schoolboys, which now blend together in his memory.\n\nHis commercial work helped him hone his craft away from the scrutiny of large audiences.\n\nZain debuted in All Crazy Random in 2022 and appeared in the short, Why ME?.\n\nWho is Zain Iqbal in A Good Girl's Guide to Murder?\n\nZain portrays Ravi, who joins forces with detective Pip to exonerate his brother and eventually becomes her boyfriend.\n\nRavi is cherished by fans as a refreshingly unique love interest on screen.\n\nIt’s so good that people who look like me have someone to look up to.\n\nZain Iqbal\n\nIn an interview, he said: “It’s so important that my character is an Asian boy who’s looked at as such a perfect, cool, handsome, sweet, humble boy.\n\n“People like us are not seen like that. We’re represented quite badly on screen.\n\n\"Now it’s going on Netflix, it’ll be seen by a lot of people in South Asia and East Asia.\"\n\nHe added: \"It’s so good that people who look like me have someone to look up to.”\n\nHe hopes the TV adaptation of Ravi and Pip's story resonates across all ages and genders, offering more depth than typical secondary school dramas.\n\n“The show is snappier,” he notes. “There’s more action going on. It’s pretty dark and gritty. I think anyone can watch it.”\n\nIn the show, high-achieving students Pip and Ravi leverage their intellect to solve mysteries.\n\nPip's school EPQ project leads her deep into a murder investigation.\n\nOff-screen, Zain was known for being less disciplined as a student.\n\n“I hated school,” he admits, “I was always a quiet kid. I wouldn’t even open my mouth.”\n\nThe actor only researched A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder after several auditions, relieved to have been unaware of its serious fandom at first.\n\n“It was a blessing in disguise. If I went in knowing the scale of it, it would have scared me away and I don’t think I would have auditioned as well.”\n\nUpon landing the role, Zain quickly bought the book from Waterstones on Tottenham Court Road and picked up wine and chocolates from Tesco to thank his agent.\n\n“I didn’t really celebrate. I was just relieved.”\n\nWho else stars in A Good Girl's Guide to Murder?\n\nZain is starring alongside American actress Emma Myers, who plays lead character Pippa Fitz-Amobi in the series.\n\nThe 22-year-old began her career as a child actress in 2010 when she appeared in The Glades.\n\nShe also had starring roles in the comedy horror series Wednesday.\n\nEmma plays Enid Sinclair in the show, a late-blooming werewolf and the roommate of Wednesday Addams, portrayed by Jenna Ortega.\n\nMyers also stars in the Netflix comedy film Family Switch alongside Jennifer Garner, Ed Helms, and Brady Noon.\n\nLine of Duty star Anna Maxwell Martin, who is known for starring in A Spy Among Friends and Motherland, will also join the cast alongside Rye Lane actor Gary Beadle and Ghosts star Mathew Baynton.\n\nWhen asked about her latest Role, Anna expressed: \"I so enjoyed being part of A Good Girl's Guide To Murder with a really lovely cast, crew and creatives.\n\n\"Can't wait for all the people who love Holly's book to see it brought to their screens.\"\n\nHow to watch A Good Girl's Guide to Murder\n\nThe show is expected to come on Netflix on August 1.\n\nThe show is already available for streaming from July 1 on BBC iPlayer.\n\nThe official synopsis for A Good Girl's Guide to Murder reads: \"Five years ago, schoolgirl Andie Bell was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh.\n\n\"Case closed. The police know he did it. Everyone in town knows he did it. But smart and single-minded Pip Fitz-Amobi isn't so sure, and she's determined to prove it.\n\n\"And if Sal Singh isn't a murderer and the real killer is still out there, how far will they go to keep Pip from the truth?\"\n\nThe limited series will consist of six episodes, which are 45 minutes long.\n\nThe show is written by lead writer Poppy Cogan alongside Zia Ahmed, Ajoke Ibironke and Ruby Thomas and is produced by Florence Walker.\n\nIt began airing on BBC Three on July 10, with two episodes being broadcast per week."
