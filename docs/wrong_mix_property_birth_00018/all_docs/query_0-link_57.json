        "text": "Our first hub, The Pompey Pirates, launched in the heart of the Charles Dickens Ward, Portsmouth in September 2020.\n\nThe Pompey Pirates provides an intensive, year long, catch up programme run from our bespoke, pirate themed hub.\n\nWe created the Pompey Pirates project with the inspiration and support of our friends at The Literacy Pirates.\n\nPortsea Sailors is our second hub in Portsmouth, and is based in the National Museum of the Royal Navy in the Historic Dockyard.\n\nThe hub opened in January 2022, and our first cohort of young sailors worked on an exhibition project inspired by the rich history on display in the NMRN galleries. Then they created their own published short stories.\n\nDuring the first term of the programme, the young pirates get to let their imaginations run wild as they work on crafting and polishing their own short story. Their finished tales of treasure, trials, and adventure on the high seas are collated into a published collection of short stories.\n\nFor our second project the pirates build on their story writing skills to develop a screenplay for an adventure film. With technical support from local filmmakers, they are able to bring their scripts to life; starring in the roles they have written for their very own movie!\n\nIn our final project the pirates collaborate to produce an hour long radio show, aired on local radio station Express FM. Focusing on a range of language techniques, the pirates use their powers of persuasion to let people know about a cause or topic that is close to their hearts.\n\nFor their first term, the Sailors embark on a creative journey to write their own stories that will be published in their very own book!\n\nHaving their own story published at such a young age is quite the impressive feat!\n\nLast year’s collection ‘The Adventures of Captain Hardy’ is sold in Pigeon Books if you’d like to see some examples of their incredible creativity.\n\nIn their second project, the Sailors collaborated to produce advertisements of places around the city to visit. They aired on local radio station Unmade Radio and were featured on BBC Radio Solent. Focusing on a range of language techniques, the Sailors use their powers of persuasion to entice the public to visit.\n\nIn their final project, the Sailors created a documentary telling the story of The Mary Rose ship. Learning and developing their research skills, they delved into the history of the ship. Preparing their own questions, They had the privilege of meeting and interviewing the original divers of the Mary Rose. Two generations coming together for one incredibly special project."
