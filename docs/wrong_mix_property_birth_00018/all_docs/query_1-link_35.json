        "text": "BEING A HISTORY OF A CHRISTMAS CAROL ON FILM\n\nBy Richard Jones\n\nIn recent weeks ghosts, dozens - maybe even thousands - of them, have been appearing in my front room.\n\nI have, you see, been watching the many film versions there have been of the Charles Dickens classic in an endeavour to find the best movie adaptation of A Christmas Carol.\n\nEvery year, around early December, I prepare myself for my Dickens Christmas Walk by both reading the book and watching the film.\n\nThe film version I have always watched is the 1951 adaptation starring Alastair Sim, largely because a) I consider it the finest version ever made and b) because it brings back happy childhood memories, of when it was always on TV.\n\nHowever, in 2013, I was asked to appear as an interviewee on Channel Five's Greatest Christmas Movies Ever to talk about various film versions of A Christmas Carol. As it happened, they didn't want me to speak about the Alastair Sim version but rather The Muppet Christmas Carol and Bill Murray's Scrooged, neither of which, I am ashamed to say, I had actually seen.\n\nBut, a quick visit (or should that be click) to Amazon and, a day later, the DVD's of both appeared before me and I spent the next two days watching them.\n\nI have to say I loved them both, in particular The Muppets version, which, more or less, stuck closer to Dickens original story than practically any other film version - apart from giving Charles Dickens a big blue nose and introducing us to the Marley twins in order to make use of both Statler and Waldorf! I thought Michael Caine gave one of the best performances of Scrooge I've ever seen, imbuing him with a pathos that suggests he (Scrooge not Michael) is very much a product of a miserable past.\n\nIt set me wondering about all the different film adaptations there must have been over the years, and so I decided to begin researching the various celluloid incarnations of Ebenezer Scrooge by compiling a list of the many adaptations of A Christmas Carol and, having done so, I set about watching as many of them as I could.\n\nBelow, you will find a selection of the different adaptations together with my thoughts on each one.\n\nSome of them are superb, some are middling, and a few are downright awful!\n\nBut they, at least, present us with a wonderful chronology of the various renditions of the second greatest Christmas story ever told, together with a terrific insight into the many and varied ways in which actors have portrayed Scrooge over the more than 150 years since Dickens created him.\n\nI hope you enjoy these various renditions and, should you happen to know of, or you happen to encounter, any online versions I've not included, please let me know in order that I can add them to the page.\n\nThis is an ongoing project and, eventually, it is my intention to have a review of every film version of A Christmas Carol, so please be sure to check back regularly for updates and new reviews.\n\nSCROOGE OR MARLEY'S GHOST - 1901\n\nWith Daniel Smith As Scrooge\n\nThe earliest version I have been able to track down is this incomplete silent film by Robert W. Paul that dates from 1901.\n\nIt is, so the credits claim, the earliest known version of A Christmas Carol on film.\n\nIt's spooky to think that, when this was made, Dickens had only been dead for thirty years and there were people around who had met him and who had even heard him read aloud from the book!\n\nKeep an eye on the section in scene two when Marley's face manifests on the doorknocker and, inadvertently, makes a brief appearance through the back of Scrooge's hat!\n\nGiven that this is a silent movie, and Dickens himself was such a dedicated wordsmith, it's interesting to watch a Dickens story being told without any actual words being spoken.\n\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL - 1910\n\nWith Mark McDermott As Scrooge\n\nLasting just over 13 minutes, this adaptation, made in 1910 and directed by J. Searle Dawley for Thomas Edison's film production company, this version makes a reasonable go at presenting the important aspects of Dickens story, and the ghosts themselves are well attempted.\n\nAs with the 1901 version, it's interesting to see a Dickens story being told without sound!\n\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL - 1923\n\nWith Russell Thorndike As Scrooge\n\nThis 1923 silent version, in which Russell Thorndike (1885 - 1972) took on the role of Dickens old skinflint, begins with the promising opening caption:-\n\n\"Wise men have always contended that the toughest skin that covers any animal is to be found on that of a miser.\n\nNothing short of a miracle can ever regenerate him.\n\nIn the joyous story of A Christmas Carol, we bring to life the world-renowned character of...\"\n\nAnd there, dear reader, I shall leave you in suspense! I bet you can't guess which \"world-renowned\" character they are going to bring to life?\n\nOh! All right then, it was Ebenezer Scrooge, and despite the fact that the film is black and white, silent, and, to say the least, dated, it does have a terrific atmosphere.\n\nIn the first scene, we encounter Scrooge sitting menacingly at his desk, counting up his ill-gotten gains, whilst his \"downtrodden clerk\", Bob Cratchit, sits at a desk in an outer \"dismal cell\", trying desperately to warm himself by a solitary candle.\n\nOh, you find yourself thinking, this Scrooge chappy must be \"a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner\" - largely on account of the fact that these exact words have just flickered across the screen in front of you.\n\nEvidently, Bob is no contender for the tidiest employee of the year award, 1923, as the floor of his \"dismal cell\" is strewn with discarded bits of paper; but, then again, maybe he's just so cold that his hand shakes too much form him to lob them accurately into the waste bin? Or, perhaps, Scrooge is just too mean to buy him one?\n\nEither way, Bob's \"dismal cell\" is a total mess, and, if I were Scrooge, I would tell him firmly, \"no turkey for you Bob Cratchit, unless you tidy your room.\"\n\nAnyway, back to the story.\n\nBob decides to sneak into the office of his grumpy old employer, in order to acquire a little coal for his fire - which, given, as far as I could tell, he doesn't actually have a fire in his \"dismal cell\", is a bit of a pointless exercise, so it is little wonder that Scrooge sends him packing with a flea in his ear. At least, I think he does, it's difficult to tell with a silent film!\n\nSuddenly, nephew Fred comes mincing in through Scrooge's door to wish him the compliments of the season, only to have his good wishes typed back at him with the words, \"Humbug! Christmas time is a time to pay bills and a time for finding yourself a day older.\"\n\nFred, evidently finds this hilarious and throws his head back in mirth, before sitting down at his uncle's desk and lecturing him on the virtues of enjoying Christmas etc. etc. etc.\n\nWhilst all this is going on, Bob, in his outer \"dismal cell\", appears to have developed a severe attack of Tourette's, as he seems to be constantly lobbing profanities in Scrooge's general direction.\n\nScrooge, of course, has no truck with Fred's love of Christmas and bids him a solemn, \"Good Afternoon\", whereupon Fred heads out into the cold and foggy film set, where he encounters a cheeky street urchin, whom he flips a coin to.\n\nWith Fred gone, the boy takes up a position outside Scrooge's office and begins to sing a Christmas carol. Whereupon, Scrooge picks up a massive ledger, rushes out, and smashes the urchin over the head with it, before subjecting the poor boy to an assault so vicious, that I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised if the actor playing the part of the jolly caroler didn't seek compensation for injuries received.\n\nEvidently, the film's budget would only stretch to one charity gentleman, who pops in to implore Scrooge to contribute generously to the welfare of the poor, only to receive the well-known homily about the Union Workhouses, albeit the bit about the poor rather dying and decreasing the surplus population is omitted, no doubt on the grounds that somebody had just looked at the clock and realised that they still had an awful lot to cram into the remaining 16 minutes of running time.\n\nSo, just like nephew Fred before him, the charity gentleman is bid \"good afternoon\". Pausing as he leaves, he turns and appears to lob an insult at Scrooge, who, if my eyes were not deceiving me, responds with a very rude hand gesture.\n\nAnd so our journey continues as, via a brief stop at the home of Mrs Fred and her sister who are preparing for Christmas, we head back back to Scrooge's office, where he reluctantly gives his \"downtrodden clerk\" the next day off, and then heads home for a quiet Christmas Eve by his fireside, where he intends to brood \"over the stupidity of Christmas festivities.\"\n\nUnfortunately, his Christmas Eve brood is rudely interrupted by the sudden appearance of his dead partner, Jacob Marley, who Scrooge dismisses as nothing more than his liver being \"out of order.\"\n\nSitting down, the transparent phantom tells Scrooge that he is to be haunted by three spirits, at which news Scrooge shakes his head vigorously, no doubt pointing out that that's an awful lot of ghostly activity to cram into the remaining thirteen minutes of running time.\n\nThe predicament is not helped by the fact that old Jacob insists on repeating as many of the lines from the book as the intertitleist's nimble fingers can type, which uses up almost two more minutes of precious running time.\n\nThe result is that, no sooner has Jacob's revenant shuffled off with his mortal coil, than the Ghost of Christmas Past flickers onto the screen and quickly tells the old skinflint to, \"behold the girl who would not marry you because your heart was obsessed by love of Gold, engrossed [by] the passion for gain!\"\n\n\"Hang on,\", you can hear Scrooge thinking, \"what about my school days, and old Fezziwig's Christmas jig? That was always my favourite part.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\", says the ghost, \"there are two more spirits and a redemption yet, and there are only 8 minutes left.\"\n\nAnd with that, the ghost quickly shows him getting the old heave-ho by his former lover, before Scrooge appears to have a fit, and the ghost vanishes.\n\nNext up, Santa - or, as it transpires, the Ghost of Christmas Present - materializes alongside Scrooge's fireplace, and informs him that he [the ghost] will, \"spend to-morrow at your nephew's home, your clerk's home (which is, hopefully, tidier than his office), and in the home of all who love Christmas.\"\n\n\"Oohh, goody\", you can sense Scrooge thinking, \"I love this bit. Watching the Cratchit's have lunch; shedding a tear for adorable Tiny Tim; joining in, unseen, with Fred's Christmas games, come on spirit let's go.\"\n\n\"Yeah, dream on,\" sneers the spirit, \"you're never going to manage all that in the remaining six minutes.\"\n\nInstead, the only contribution from the Ghost of Christmas Present is the miserly rebuke, \"No! You cannot tempt me to remain, for you have no love for your fellow men - only love for yourself.\"\n\nAnd, so saying - or, in this case, typing - he's off, leaving Scrooge on his knees, lamenting that he's not now the man he was.\n\nSuddenly, the \"Spirit of the Future\" turns up, causing poor old Scrooge to, apparently, suffer a heart attack, before beckoning him to follow to a churchyard, where Scrooge sees his own name writ large upon a gravestone.\n\nShocked by the fact he is destined to die, Scrooge implores the Spirit to assure him that he \"may yet change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life\" - which, given the fact that the only shadow he has been shown is that he is going to die, suggests that Scrooge wants the secret of everlasting life.\n\nThe spirit, though, has nothing to give, largely because they're down to the last two minutes of running time, and it promptly vanishes, leaving Scrooge to wake up in his chair by his fireside, where he thanks Jacob Marley for helping dispel the shadows of things that would have been.\n\nBut, of course, there is one major character who has been conspicuous by his absence.\n\nA character that is so important to the storyline, and who is so universally loved, that to exclude him from the film would be an unforgiveable omission.\n\nYes, you've guessed it - there has been no mention of Topper.\n\nSo, in order to right this wrong, we are spirited into a scene in which \"Topper, who is in love with Mrs. Fred's sister,\" tries to woo her by the fireside, only to have his passion extinguished by Mr and Mrs. Fred, who come barging into the room, without knocking, I couldn't help but notice, and proceed to inform the love-struck couple to cease with their shenanigans, as lunch is about to be served and the last thing they want is Topper slobbering over the vol au vents.\n\nBut, no sooner have they sat down to the table, than old uncle Scrooge comes bounding in and gets so many kisses from the women, and his nephew, that Topper must have been furious at being cuckolded by the old curmudgeon!\n\nThe film ends with Scrooge enjoying a beverage by his fireside with his \"downtrodden little clerk\" - which, given he's a good two feet taller than Scrooge, seems a rather odd choice of phrase on the part of the intertitleist - and promising to double his salary.\n\nAnd, with that, the film draws to its conclusion.\n\nI must say that, despite the fact that the film is silent, and it is evidently rushed, it does have a certain atmosphere to it, and the characters, especially Russell Thorndike as Scrooge, do remain true to how you expect the characters to look, and I have to say that I did enjoy it.\n\nAnd so, to use Tiny Tim's time honoured exclamation - oh, wait, sorry, he's not in it. God bless him wherever he was.\n\nSCROOGE - 1935\n\nWith Seymour Hicks As Scrooge\n\nThe best known silent adaptation of A Christmas Carol was the 1913 version starring Seymour Hicks as the miserly curmudgeon.\n\nIn 1935, Seymour Hicks reprised the part he had made his own in thousands of stage versions, plus the 1913 film adaptation, and played the title role in this, the first talking version of the Dickens classic.\n\nHicks gives us an exquisitely bad tempered and disheveled Scrooge who delivers his lines with such rasping maliciousness, that you genuinely believe he really does hate everyone he meets.\n\nThe first ten minutes or so are wonderfully atmospheric, and you can almost feel the cold emanating from the screen as you watch it. Donald Calthrop, as Bob Cratchitt, bears such an uncanny resemblance to John Leech's original illustrations in the book that it's as though he's stepped off the page and on to the film set.\n\nThere's a scene, early on, when nephew Fred drops by to, quite literally, shout the praises of keeping Christmas, and does it with such animated gusto that he appears to almost set fire to his nose on his uncle Scrooge's candle.\n\nOnce Scrooge has, reluctantly, allowed his downtrodden assistant to head home on Christmas Eve, we get taken on a tour of the streets of Victorian London, in the course of which we actually get to see Bob Cratchit go \"down a slide on Cornhill\", just as he does in the book.\n\nAnd then it starts to unravel.\n\nIn fairness, since this was the first version with sound, there was nothing to look back to as a benchmark and you get the impression that the screen writer, H. Fowler Mear, and the director, Henry Edwards, began with the best of intentions of following Dickens storyline as faithfully as possible but that they put so much effort and time into setting up the atmosphere, and contrasting the gulf between the rich and the poor of Victorian London, that, by the time Scrooge got home for the start of his Christmas Eve redemption, there was no money left in the kitty to do anything else.\n\nThere is, for example, an extended scene, as Scrooge makes his way home, during which we are treated to a visit to the Lord Mayor's banquet attended by a cast of so many extras that the cost of their costumes alone probably blew the larger part of the film's budget!\n\nWe then get shown the kitchens below, where the cooks are preparing the Christmas Eve feast whilst ye poor folk of olde London town scrabble hungrily outside the window begging for a few morsels to be cast in their direction, their wish being duly obliged by a chef who proceeds to fling the leftovers at them in a way that is reminiscent of feeding time at a zoo.\n\nThis scene also provides the makers with the opportunity to straddle the boundary between silent films and talkies by taking, what appears to be, a nostalgic trip down memory lane and including a slapstick routine that features two jovial wine waiters over imbibing, jellies wobbling in unison with the quivering folds of flesh on a fat chef's face, and, that staple of slapstick humour, a kitchen boy getting slapped round the face with a soggy napkin.\n\nYou find yourself just waiting for the first custard pie to be thrown but, instead, we get the film's only musical number when the assembled guests rise to their feet and give a stirring rendition of \"God Save the Queen.\" At which point the film cuts to the starving, scrabbling poor outside the kitchen window who are also standing to attention and singing along as well! How's that for gritty social realism?\n\nIt's a huge relief when the film cuts back to Scrooge who continues his homeward journey through the snow hurling rasping insults at every man and dog he meets.\n\nIt's at this point that you sense the moneymen taking the director to one side and telling him, \"look, that banquet scene was great, but we're afraid the money's running out, you're going to have to cut stuff.\" \"What stuff?\" you can hear the director asking. \"Well,\" reply the moneymen, stroking their chins and taking a sharp intake of breath, \"those ghosts, are they really necessary?\"\n\nThus we get a version of A Christmas Carol that opts for a somewhat radical approach to the story by doing away with the majority of the spirits!\n\nMarley, for example, is nothing more than a disembodied voice with whom Scrooge conducts an entire conversation whilst talking to an empty chair.\n\nOur hopes are raised when the Ghost of Christmas Past begins to materialise, but then it doesn't quite manage it, and you get the distinct impression that the special effects budget ran out half way through the scene. Thereafter Scrooge ventures off along memory lane accompanied by nothing more than a spooky voice and what appears to be an annoying smudge on the camera lens.\n\nFezziwig's feast and Scrooge's sister, Fan, are nowhere to be seen.\n\nHick's himself plays the part of Scrooge's younger self which, given the fact he was 64 years old at the time, and looked it, seems slightly creepy when we see him with his fiancée Belle, and you find yourself asking what could possibly have attracted such a pretty young woman to an old millionaire like Ebenezer Scrooge. When Belle sends him packing because \"something else\" has replaced her in his affections, you can't help but wonder if that something else was Viagra.\n\nFollowing Belle's rejection of him, there is a scene, which is in the book, but which is often left out of film versions, when the Ghost of Christmas Past tells Scrooge to \"look, and see the happiness you have missed.\" We then witness Belle as the happily married, doting mother of so many children, I counted at least sixteen, that, deep down, Scrooge must have been thanking his lucky stars that she gave him the old heave ho all those years ago.\n\nWe do get a full blown and, it must be said, splendidly rotund Ghost of Christmas Present, but this is followed by a BAFTA-worthy piece of shadow puppetry to depict the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.\n\nThis version is, almost, unique in that it's one of only two versions that shows Tiny Tim lying dead on his bed (Patrick Stewart's was the other version to do this) and the scene where a tearful Bob Cratchit visit's his dead son's bedside is genuinely moving, although the poignancy is slightly marred by the fact we catch a brief glimpse of a crew member's finger pulling the bedroom door shut behind him.\n\nI'm sure I won't spoil anything by revealing that it all comes right in the end, and Scrooge is as good as his word about being a better employer and friend to Bob Cratchit. So much so that when, in the final scene, we see Scrooge shuffle nervously up a church aisle to the joyous strains of \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\", and watch him lay a trembling hand on Bob Cratchit's arm, who then turns, smiles, and looks into his eyes, you almost expect the film's last words to be \"I do.\"\n\nAll in all, though, this is a genuine piece of Dickensian film history and, as such, is well worth watching, if only for its curiosity value. Its antiquated feel certainly adds to the atmosphere - and who needs ghosts when you've got a particularly annoying collection of Cratchit children?\n\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL - 1938\n\nWith Reginald Owen As Scrooge\n\nThe part of Scrooge was originally intended to be played by Lionel Barrymore. He had performed the role on his annual Christmas radio show for many years previously and the studio had hoped to take advantage of his popularity.\n\nUnfortunately, Barrymore was crippled with arthritis at the time and was barely able to walk, so he suggested Reginald Owen as his replacement.\n\nThis was the first American film version of A Christmas Carol.\n\nMGM's determination to make this a \"family friendly\" film meant that they took certain liberties with the original storyline as they attempted to tone down what they saw as the unsuitable elements of the Dickens narrative.\n\nIn this version, there are no phantoms wandering hither and thither outside Scrooge's window; his doomed romance with his fiancée, Belle, is doomed to have never happened; the \"wretched, frightful, hideous children,\" want and ignorance, are nowhere to be seen - let alone cowering within the folds of the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present; and the thieves who ransack Scrooge's room after his demise in the Christmas Yet To Come Sequence are also conspicuous by their absence.\n\nInstead we are left with sugar-coated Dickens in which even the starving beggars look like they could benefit from a New Year crash diet.\n\nReginald Owen doesn't make a particularly convincing Scrooge, and the makeup used to age him is even less convincing.\n\nGene and Kathleen Lockhart head a Cratchit family who are so cloyingly irritating that you find yourself wishing that the reformed Scrooge would revert to type and poison the turkey before he sends it to them.\n\nThat said, this version most certainly has redeeming features. It does, for example, possess the warmth of the original Dickens story and, with its overall feel good factor, it is easy to see why this remained the most famous version on American television until Alastair Sim's adaptation began to receive widespread exposure in the 1970's.\n\nTHE CHRISTMAS CAROL - 1949\n\nWith Taylor Holmes As Ebeneezer Scrooge\n\nNarrated By Vincent Price\n\nVincent Price, the Vincent Price narrating one of the greatest ghost stories ever told. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWell, you could give him a dodgy beard, and an even dodgier bow tie. You could stick him on a set that wouldn't be out of place in a Victorian children's nursery. For good measure, you could call it Charles Dickens The Christmas Carol.\n\nIn addition, you could give Scrooge an extra e in his first name and bill him as Ebeneezer. Whilst you're at it, why not have Price narrate it in his best Ghost of Christmas Patronising tone?\n\nAdd performances that are so hammy that they wouldn't be out of place on the table at Fezziwig's feast, and you can't help thinking that the entire cast and company must have watched the premier with a unanimous \"God help us, every one!\"\n\nEven Scrooge, played here by Taylor Holmes, seems somewhat embarrassed by it all and he repents his past transgressions with such little resistance and speed that the ghosts must have been left wondering if it had been worth the effort of appearing to him!\n\nStill, you get told the story by the Vincent Price, so it's not all bad!\n\nSCROOGE - 1951\n\nWith Alastair Sim As Scrooge\n\nTo many peoples reckoning, this is the best version of A Christmas Carol ever made, and there is little doubt that this is the one celluloid version of the story that well and truly deserves to be labeled a Christmas Classic.\n\nAlastair Sim is superb as Scrooge, and Michael Horden gives such a splendidly over the top performance as the ghost of Jacob Marley that, if I were Scrooge, I'd refuse to ever reform in the hope that he'd keep coming back and repeating it!\n\nThat said, it does take certain liberties with Dickens original story.\n\nWe are, for example, given a back story for Scrooge as a man of business that is noticeably absent from the book.\n\nAlthough Scrooge's fiancée returns, after having been jilted by the producers in the MGM 1938 version, she has, for reasons that are never explained, changed her name to Alice.\n\nThere is the suggestion, again absent from the book, that the reason for Scrooge's resentment of his nephew, Fred, is that Fred's mother, Scrooge's beloved sister, Fan, died giving birth to him.\n\nThe film also suggests that Scrooge's own father resented him because his wife, Scrooge's mother, died giving birth to him. This was most certainly not the fate that Dickens had in mind for Mrs. Scrooge as, in the book, his sister Fan is much younger than him. But, then again, as Scrooge himself observes, \"The spirits can do anything.. of course they can. Of course they can.\"\n\nBut, who really cares about liberties when you have such a first rate film version as this. It's well acted, well told, well presented and, as it draws to a close, you find yourself most certainly wanting to ask for more - oops wrong book!\n\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL - 1954\n\nWith Fredric March As Scrooge\n\nDon't you sometimes find yourself longing for those long ago Christmas's when it always snowed; when happy folk in jolly bonnets and furry muffs walked about the streets, bursting into song at every drop of a hat; and you came down stairs on Christmas Morning to find that Santa had been in the night and had left a shiny new Chrysler Dodge in your Christmas stocking whilst you were sleeping?\n\nIn this 1954 airing of the tale - which was brought to us by the Chrysler Corporation, a fact we keep getting reminded of throughout - Fredric March sticks a massive prosthetic conk over his own nose and, accompanied by a star lacking cast, many of whom appear to have stepped straight off the sets of those annoying 1950's washing powder commercials, he treats us to television's first musical version of A Christmas Carol.\n\nFrom the opening moments, when an annoying boy soprano and a merry band of equally annoying carolers sing us through the snowy streets of Olde London town, to the closing moments, when a particularly cringe worthy Tiny Tim asks Scrooge \"would you like to hear my Christmas song?\", you find yourself trapped in your own Yuletide nightmare, wondering if the clipped tones of the fake British accents could sound any more forced, or the acting could get any more wooden, only to find that the answer to both questions is a resounding yes.\n\nFrederic March, as Scrooge, bears an uncanny resemblance to William Hartnell, the first Dr. Who which, given I spent a large part of the production hiding behind the sofa, most certainly did bring back happy childhood memories of Christmas's past.\n\nThe ghost of Jacob Marley is played by Basil Rathbone who holds aloft a large ledger in a manner that leaves you just waiting for him to utter the words \"Ebenezer Scrooge, this is your life.\" Scrooge is singularly unimpressed by all this and reprimands the apparition, who by now is holding its hands in a pose that is reminiscent of Tommy Cooper's \"just like that\", by telling him \"I often heard it said in your life time Jacob Marley that you had no bowels\" - except he pronounces \"bowels\" as \"balls\", with the result that, when he adds \"now I can see that it's true\", you almost feel shortchanged by the fact that Basil Rathbone has his back to the camera.\n\nSally Fraser as the Ghost of Christmas Past takes him back to Fezziwig's party where we see him as he used to be and watch as he refuses to dance until his beloved Belle arrives.\n\nWhere can she be?\n\n\"Sorry I'm late Ebenezer\", she says, when she eventually turns up, and we realise that the reason for the delay was to give Sally Fraser enough time to change out of her ghost costume and into her Belle of the Ball outfit.\n\nNo sooner has she arrived than she and the younger Scrooge burst into song with an extended musical number that consists largely of the lyric \"What shall I give my lad/girl [depending on who's singing] for Christmas?\" sung over and over again. During a particularly excruciating sequence, in which she and Craig Hill, playing the younger Scrooge, seem to compete for who can hit the highest and loudest \"what shall I give my lad/girl for Christmas?\", you find yourself shouting at the TV \"singing lessons would be a good start.\"\n\nAs Scrooge backs away from these visions of the things that have been, crying \"no more, no more\", you find yourself in the rare position of actually agreeing wholeheartedly with the old curmudgeon, and crying out in unison.\n\nBut there is more.\n\nNo sooner has Scrooge got back to the safety of his bed, than the orchestra strikes up again and a rich baritone breaks into his slumbers.\n\nAnd, there he is, the Ghost of Christmas Present, striking a pose that could have come straight from the centerfold of an edition of Playgirl, and bearing an uncanny resemblance to Scrooge's nephew, Fred, who we met earlier. \"A very Merry Christmas,\" the spirit sings, to Scrooge's total bemusement - especially when, half way through the scene, he suddenly breaks into what appears to be an impression of C3-PO from Star Wars.\n\nThe Spirit then takes Scrooge to the Cratchits house where Queenie Leonard, as Mrs. Cratchit, treats us to a performance that is so wooden you expect Tiny Tim to limp over at any moment and stick her under his arm.\n\nThen, just when you think it's safe to come out from behind the sofa, Christopher Cook, as Tiny Tim, lets rip with a mournful ditty, watched by his adoring mum as she turns the goose on the spit and looks awfully like Mrs. Cunningham from Happy Days. \"Bless us everyone\" her precious, and precocious, Timmy warbles, as the camera cuts to a close up of Scrooge's face, and you sense that he is praying for the goose fat to set fire to the hearth and burn the house down so that he can go home and have a decent night's sleep.\n\n\"Will Tiny Tim live,\" Scrooge enquires of the Spirit, and it's all you can do to stop yourself shouting at the screen \"Please God no.\"\n\nBy now, the extended musical numbers have used up a huge chunk of the 60 minutes running time, so you can almost sense the panic as they realise they've got to cram the Ghost of Christmas yet To Come, Scrooge's redemption, and another plug for Chrysler into the fourteen or so minutes they've got left.\n\nTherefore, in a truly inspired piece of casting, the spirit of the future turns up as a crow perched on a tree branch in a mist enshrouded graveyard, and manages to cram all of Scrooge's Christmas's yet to come into 1 minute 40 seconds of screen time. We watch as Scrooge recoils in horror from the sight of his own name carved onto a gravestone and then proceeds to collapse onto the adjoining grave on which he sees, to his horror and our joy, the name Tiny Tim.\n\nThus, via another word about our sponsors, we join the redeemed Scrooge as he heads over to the Cratchit house and invites himself to their Christmas lunch, without, I couldn't help but notice, having, this time, paid for the turkey. He does, however, tell Bob \"I'm going to raise your salary and we'll procure the best of care for Tiny Tim.\" Poor old Bob must have been gutted that he didn't add \"and I'll throw in a brand new Chrysler Dodge, courtesy of our sponsors.\"\n\nBob then introduces his employer to his family, after which there follows an awkward moment in which the actors appear to have forgotten whose meant to speak next and proceed to exchange concerned glances before Tim saves the day by asking Scrooge \"would you like to hear my Christmas song?\"\n\nThe look that Scrooge shoots towards the front door says it all. But, it's too late, there's no escape. He's trapped, hemmed in by the Stepford Cratchits and, as the orchestra strikes up, and Tim takes a deep breath, Scrooge's left hand closes in on the back of the boy's neck and you can see the torment etched into his features as he fights the urge to drive Tim's face hard into the table and end the torment once and for all.\n\nAs the strains of yet another overtly sentimental number fill the air, the camera zooms in on Scrooge's face which contorts into an array of contemplative, bizarre and pained expressions, which are intended to show him mulling over his regret for his past transgressions and his joy at his redemption, but which look more like he's got a certain something stuck in his zipper and the camera man's having a right laugh at his expense.\n\nBut, all good things must come to the end, and so too must this outing of Scrooge. So, it's with a heavy heart that you bid a tearful farewell to sixty minutes of your life that you're never going to get back, as you watch Tiny Tim struggle to his feet and bring the festivities to a close with a rousing \"God Bless us, Everyone!\"\n\nBut, joy to the World, there's one more unintentional final nugget awaiting us.\n\nFor, no sooner have the credits ended, than the programme's host William Lundigan, who has popped up throughout to extol the virtues of Christmas and Chrysler, returns and utters the immortal words \"now, here is Joan Evans who's going to tell us something about next week's Climax.\"\n\nApparently, it was, most certainly, the most wonderful time of the year.\n\nTHE STINGIEST MAN IN TOWN - 1956\n\nStarring Basil Rathbone As Ebenezer Scrooge\n\nIn what has been described as \"the Holy Grail of lost Dickensian television adaptations\" - well, that's what it says on the sleeve of the DVD - Basil Rathbone doffs his deer-stalker, and dons the garb of literature's most infamous misanthropic miser to give us his portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge.\n\nThis lavish musical production originally aired on the 23rd of December 1956 as part of the Alcoa Hour, and the fact the whole thing was done live makes it a truly impressive feat and achievement.\n\n\"But, why is it the Holy Grail of lost Dickensian television adaptations?\" I hear you ask.\n\nWell, I'll tell you.\n\nAlthough the show was originally broadcast in colour, the only recording of it was preserved by Kinescope, which consisted of a film camera being placed in front of a black and white television set in the studio, in order to record the show.\n\nFor many years, this, the only recording of The Stingiest Man in Town, was believed to have suffered the fate of so many early TV shows, and was thought to have been lost or destroyed - hence its \"Holy Grail\" status amongst aficionados.\n\nBut then, in 2011, a copy of the master reel was found in the home of a retired Alcoa executive; and this discovery meant that, just like Scrooge, we can now look back with mixed emotions on a bygone Christmas.\n\nSince this is a kinescope of a live broadcast, the quality of the recording varies enormously from scene to scene. Sometimes, it's excellent, other times its just about watchable.\n\nThis becomes immediately apparent in the opening sequence, as a cheery, upbeat American announcer's voice - a master class in upbeat America announcing voices if ever there was one - introduces us to the cast, who are shown looking awkwardly out from what appear to be a series of ship's portholes with, snow flakes stuck around them to give us the authentic feel of the season.\n\nThere is an awkward moment when Robert Weede, who is wearing an odd head veil, is introduced, and the camera stays on him a little longer than was evidently intended, and you notice his eyes dart nervously from side to side as he wonders what's going on.\n\nAnd then we get the news that the broadcast has been brought to us by the \"Aluminum Company of America - The World's leading producer of Aluminum,\" - that's Aluminium for English readers and viewers - before the opening sequence closes with the revelation that the programme was produced by the, aptly named, Joel Spector - well, alright, I know for that line to work it should have been Joel Spectre, but, you get my drift - and, if you're listening to this on a screen reader, I bet you're in stitches!\n\nThe production is \"Holly Ho, Holly Ho, Ho, Ho'd\" in by The Four Lads, who then sing about a man named Ebenezer Scrooge, who counts his gold in his counting house, whilst people in the square outside celebrate Christmas Eve.\n\nThey turn to mingle with the Victorian clad cast, who break into a rousing rendition, entitled An Old Fashioned Christmas, for which Johnny Desmond, playing the part of Fred, takes centre stage amidst a gaggle of gregarious extras who dance, fawn, kiss and pirouette their way through an opening number that soon gets your foot tapping along to the rhythm.\n\nAs the dulcet tones drift off into the ether, Fred, wishes them all a merry Christmas and pushes open a door, over which we see the names of \"Scrooge and Marley\", and there he is, the wizened form of Basil Rathbone, crouched over his desk, scribbling away with his quill pen.\n\n\"Merry Christmas Uncle Scrooge\", shouts the exuberant Fred, only to have the word, \"humbug\", barked back at him.\n\n\"Oh, be merry Uncle Scrooge\", Fred persists.\n\nAnd then, Basil Rathbone does something that his agent really should have advised him not to do - he sings.\n\nWell, I think that's what he's doing.\n\nMind you, he does manage to rhyme St Nicholas with ridiculous, so, I'll give him that one and move on.\n\nBob Cratchit remains awkwardly in the background for this scene, only coming to the fore - or in this case the door - when Fred leaves and the two charity collectors enter the counting house.\n\nOne of them, played by John McGiver, appears to have over imbibed in the Green Room, and slurs his lines in such a way as to suggest the early arrival of the festive spirits, but perhaps it's just a fault on the recording.\n\nWe get a series of blandly forgettable exchanges between Scrooge and Bob Cratchit, and between Scrooge and Mrs Dilber, before the pace picks up with the arrival of John Heawood as \"'arry 'awkins, rag picker at you service\", and the Four Lads return to join him in a foot stomping number entitled \"The Stingiest Man in Town.\"\n\nAs the song dies away, and Mrs Dilber looks awkwardly around her, wondering if she was meant to exit stage left or stage right, the camera cuts to Scrooge, who is reclining in bed and appears to be sleeping peacefully, despite the fact that a loud baritone voice is singing about \"a pair of rattling chains\" that came \"clanking through the gloom,\" before continuing with, \"And while he lay there shivering, in the icy wind of fear, the ghost of Scrooge's partner, Jacob Marley, did appear.\"\n\nAnd, sure enough in comes Robert Weede, as said ghost, looking as though he got caught up in the net curtains on his way in and one of them has wrapped itself around him.\n\nWe get another musical ditty about how Scrooge should repent, after which he learns what the night has in store for him, and then Santa Claus appears in his bedroom, who, so it transpires, is, in fact, the Ghost of Christmas Past. Pay attention at the back.\n\nThe ghost and Scrooge simply discuss Scrooge's school days, as opposed to actually visiting them; but we then get a festive treat of dancing, swirling and twirling through Fezziwig's feast, before Vic Damone treats us to one of the most excruciating younger Scrooge's never committed to celluloid, and demonstrates his love for his sweetheart, Betty in this version, by, quite literally, building a wall of gold between them, although in the next song he claims he's \"built a wall of gold around us.\"\n\nBetty, however, is not impressed and gives him the old heave ho.\n\nThe Four Lads - following what was evidently an ad break in the original broadcast - \"Holly Ho, Holly Ho, Ho, Ho\" us into the Ghost Of Christmas Present's appearance, which begins with a surreal scene in which a collection of children's dolls and toy soldiers taunt Scrooge to, \"Listen To The Sound of the Christmas Spirit.\"\n\nSuddenly, the ghost and Scrooge have arrived in the Cratchit household, where we are introduced to Peter Cratchit, who must be 35, if he's a day.\n\nBut, the shock of how mature Peter is, pales into insignificance when Bob Cratchit staggers in, with the biggest Tiny Tim I've ever seen balanced, precariously, on his shoulder.\n\nAs Bob struggles to set the lad down, you can sense the collective concern that poor old Martyn Green, who plays the role of Bob, might well collapse from a coronary before Scrooge has had the chance to double his wages.\n\nMind you, you have to take your hat off to Dennis Kohler, playing the part of Tiny Tim, who, later in the scene, struggles to chew his way through a stubbornly tough slice of goose, while Robert Wright, as the ghost, blasts a song in his ear, and the camera remains in close up on his face for an inordinately long amount of time. To think, the poor lad endured all this on live TV.\n\nScrooge then heads over to eavesdrop on nephew Fred's Christmas celebrations and, following what would have been another ad break, the Four Lads return to \"Holly Ho, Holly Ho, Ho, Ho\" us into the Christmas Yet to Come segment of the story, which, if I saw it correctly, begins with Scrooge, apparently, picking his nose, in nervous anticipation of the arrival of this particular bogey.\n\nIn strides the ghost, bearing such a striking resemblance to Darth Vader that you expect its first words to be, \"Scrooge, I am your father.\"\n\nThis version breaks with other adaptations in that, at one stage, a group of writhing, shrouded figures chain Scrooge to his gravestone, whilst tormenting him mercilessly; and the camera pans in so close on his face that I fast forwarded to the end credits to see if Basil Rathbone's dentist got a well deserved mention.\n\nAnd then, Basil Rathbone does something that, even his dentist should have advised him that he really shouldn't do - he sings again.\n\nAs the shock wears away, and Scrooge clutches at the spirit's robe, begging it to intercede on his behalf, Scrooge finds himself back in bed; and we follow him through his Christmas morning redemption, as he heads out onto the snowy studio floor, to make amends with all those his old self has offended.\n\nHis final call is to the Cratchits' house where, having sought Bob's forgiveness, he seeks to enlist Tiny Tim's assistance in changing the future.\n\nHowever, no sooner have the words left Basil Rathbone's lips, than Tiny Tim bursts into song, and screeches - in a voice that can only be described as sounding like a cross between finger nails being dragged across a blackboard and the Hound of the Baskervilles being castrated with a pair of bricks that have been wrapped in barbed wire, before being dipped in liquid nitrogen - \"Yes there is a Santa Claus for children everywhere....\"\n\nI don't wish to denigrate the lad's singing, but it's the sort of voice that not even a mother could love; and there really should have been a public health warning before he opened his mouth and launched into what must surely be the Holy Wail of Tiny Tim portrayals.\n\nThankfully, the Four Lads reappear to \"Holly Ho, Holly Ho, Ho, Ho\" us to safety, as the camera pans out, and we bid farewell to what has, most certainly, been a festive feast of heart-warming nostalgia.\n\nI have to say that, although it has its flaws, and it can, in parts, look and sound dated, this production has a comfortingly reassuring charm about it; and the fact that it was all done live is a truly impressive feat, and one that I doubt many modern TV producers and directors could pull off, even with today's high tech wizardry. There are some excellent performances - and Basil Rathbone, whilst, perhaps, not the greatest Scrooge ever, certainly puts in a watchable performance.\n\nMR. MAGOO'S CHRISTMAS CAROL - 1962\n\nWith Quincy Magoo As Scrooge\n\nOn 2nd December 2006, the America radio programme Talk of the Nation (TOTN) asked its listeners to phone in and nominate their favourite Ebenezer Scrooge ever, with the result that, the majority who did so, opted for Mr. Magoo.\n\nMr. Magoo's Christmas Carol, which first aired on NBC on 18th December 1962, has the distinction of being both the first animated Christmas Special ever produced for television, and the first animated version of Dickens 1843 novella.\n\nWe first encounter Quincy (hands up all those who didn't know his first name was Quincy) Magoo, \"Broadway's Beau Brummel,\" driving the wrong way down a one way street en route to the theatre where he is, according to the critical notices that pepper the opening sequence, wowing audiences with his critically lauded version of A Christmas Carol.\n\nFollowing a series of Magoo type mishaps, he dons his costume and joins his fellow cast members on stage, at which point we take our place in the auditorium as the curtain rises on our myopic matinee idol in the role of Ebenezer Scrooge. Which means that the TOTN listeners voted a fictional character, playing the role of a fictional character in a fictional play as their favourite Scrooge ever!\n\nAnd, do know what? They might well have a point, as he makes a pretty darned good job of it!\n\nFitting the story in to a 60 minute TV time slot meant that sacrifices had to made.\n\nSo, out goes Scrooge's nephew, Fred, as does his sister Fan and the children, Ignorance and Want.\n\nHowever, the scenes that are included remain reasonably faithful to the book and Magoo actually delivers many of Dickens original lines verbatim without, as has happened in several recent versions, any attempt to alter or simplify them in order to make them understandable to modern ears.\n\nFor some reason, the first of Scrooge's three visitations is the ghost of Christmas Present, who tells Scrooge, \"you have never seen the like of me before,\" eliciting the response, \"I'm not sure I see the like of you now.\"\n\nThe ghost then takes Scrooge to the Cratchit household where we get our first glimpse of Tiny Tim played by Gerald McBoing-Boing.\n\nThe second spirit to appear is the Ghost Of Christmas Past. There is a genuinely moving sequence when Scrooge places a comforting, transparent arm around his younger self as they sing \"I'm all alone in the World\"\n\nOne thing that struck me towards the end as the reformed Scrooge goes about dispensing huge bags full of his beloved gold coins - and the moral here does seem to be that money can buy everybody happiness - to all the poor he had previously despised is what if Scrooge is only doing it in the hope that it will make them as miserable as it made him? Just a thought!!\n\nApart from several verbal references to Magooo's short sightedness, the production is free from the usual Mr. Magoo style catastrophes until the curtain call when Magoo drags the director onto the stage and, as he does so, manages to quite literally, bring the house down.\n\nHowever, given that this version, airing as it did regularly in the 1960's, 70's and 80's, was, for many adults, their introduction to Dickens classic, it would be churlish to find too much fault with it and, in honesty, it is still enjoyable and the songs, written by Jules Styne (Music) and Bob Merill (Lyrics), who shortly after this special collaborated on the musical Funny Girl and are, actually, quite memorable and, in a strange sort of way, rather haunting.\n\nCAROL FOR ANOTHER CHRISTMAS - 1964\n\nWith Sterling Hayden As Daniel Grudge\n\nIt's Christmas Eve, and a man, who bears a striking resemblance to Benson, the butler from Soap, proceeds to walk across the marble floor of a large Baronial pile, as a vaguely familiar tune, crackling somewhere in the dark depths of the creepy old mansion, keeps time with his every step.\n\nMaking his way upstairs, to the strains of distant voices warbling on the night breezes, he raises a clenched fist to knock on a door. But suddenly the haunting melody that accompanied his journey breaks into \"Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me\" and he turns and walks away, evidently not yet ready for a Christmas Eve encounter with the three spirits of the Andrew Sisters.\n\nThe camera though has no such reservations and, ghost like, it continues its journey through the door and into the room, where the silhouette of a lone figure sits in a high back arm chair, and the disembodied voices swirl around the room urging him not to go walking down lovers lane with anyone else.\n\nEvidently, this man is no fan of the Boogie Woogie Bugle Sisters from company nine, and proceeds to switch his gramophone off without even bothering to first lift the stylus off the record. Thus we hear, and I think I took this down correctly, \"I just got word from a girl who heard from therrrrr guurrrrrrr nxtster ter taaahhhhhhhhhhh merrrrrrrrawwwwwwaaaaaaa waaaa, warrrrrr..... Spooky stuff indeed.\n\nIt's even spookier when the man, who by his pained expression is a troubled man, goes to leave the room and the song starts playing again of its own volition, without the stylus actually being on the record. Dang it. He is going to be haunted by the Andrew Sisters.\n\nThus are we treated to one of the most unusual introductions to Ebenezer Scrooge, or as he is in this case, Daniel Grudge, ever to have been committed to film.\n\nHowever, the story of how this mid-60's re-working of the Carol came to be made in the first place is every bit as unorthodox as the opening we have just witnessed.\n\nFor, bizarrely, Carol For Another Christmas was brought to us by no less an organisation than that well known maker of blockbuster movies, The United Nations, who hijacked Charles Dickens immortal story to launch a charm offensive on the people of America, and, as charm offensives go, they made a bit of a hash of it. It's one thing to get a message across in a subtle and understated fashion, it's quite another to stuff your message into a sock and whack the viewer over the head with it.\n\nThe programme itself was produced by the Telsun Foundation (standing for Television Series for the United Nations), an organisation which had been founded in an attempt to tackle widespread hostility towards the United Nations amongst the American people. The Ultra-Conservative John Birch Society, for example, had launched a \"Get US out of UN\" campaign in 1959, and many ordinary American citizens shared their view that the United Nations real purpose was to build a \"One World Government (New Order).\"\n\nPaul Hoffman, Managing Director of the United Nations Special Fund, felt that a lack of understanding as to what his organisation actually did was at the root of the hostility, and so the Telsun Foundation was formed, with the express intention of educating the public about the activities of the UN.\n\nIn April 1963, The UN announced that its new foundation would be producing a series of six movies, each of which would air simultaneously on all three US television networks without, thanks to an investment of $4 million from the Xerox Corporation, the need for commercial breaks.\n\nUnfortunately, for various reasons, NBC and CBS declined to become involved and thus the first of these \"Specials\" Carol For Another Christmas aired on just one network, ABC, on 28th December 1964, and viewers sat down to watch the aforementioned opening sequence as the spectral voices of the Andrew Sisters drifted through the corridors of the old house that Daniel Grudge, who is evidently a man of extreme wealth, appears to share with nobody but his African-American butler.\n\nAnd, it has to be said, as opening sequences go, it is gripping and quite spooky. If they'd kept this momentum going we'd have a genuine marrow chiller of a film.\n\nBut it quickly becomes apparent that scaring the pants off us with a cracking ghost story for Christmas is the last thing on the mind of the programme's writer, Rod Serling, which is a great pity since, as his other achievements include being the creator of the Twilight Zone, as Christmas creepers go, this one most certainly had potential.\n\nAs we watch, Daniel heads downstairs to be greeted by his nephew, Fred, who has dropped by to ask \"I wonder if we could talk?\"\n\n\"I was planning to get to bed early tonight,\" his uncle Dan tells him, just as a little voice in your head chimes in with a mischievous \"I wouldn't count on it.\"\n\nWe then learn that Fred is of a liberal persuasion, and that he is on a mission to right as many of the World's wrongs as it is possible to do whilst wearing a tweed jacket and a wooly pullover.\n\n\"Well then nephew\", his uncle scoffs at him, \"which one of your many causes brings you out into the snowy night? Some perverted mass murderer who's seen the light and wishes to assume his rightful place in society, as an alternative to the electric chair? A movement to donate the Mississippi to the Sahara Desert?\" Old Uncle Dan, it is quickly becoming apparent, is as hard and sharp as flint!\n\nIt transpires that Fred is mightily miffed that Uncle Daniel has gone and nobbled a cultural exchange programme whereby one of the professors at Fred's university was due to spend a year lecturing abroad, whilst, in return, a professor from abroad was due to spend a year lecturing in America.\n\n\"Yes, abroad,\" sneers Uncle Dan, adding with barely concealed contempt, \"Poland wasn't it?\"\n\nIt turns out that if there's one thing Uncle Ebenezer, sorry, Uncle Daniel, hates more than the Andrew Sisters, its Commies, and the last thing he's going to stand for is some Eastern Bloc Johnny Foreigner, \"whose name, even if I knew what it was, is probably unpronounceable\", swapping roles and countries with a homegrown academic in order to poison the minds of impressionable young Americans with his own insidious brand of 18th century European literature.\n\n\"Get smart boy,\" he lambasts Fred, \"we've been digging his sort out of the woodwork for years. You don't really expect me to be a party to inviting one of them in here now do you?\"\n\nMan oh man, does old Uncle Dan carry his own low temperature always about with him. He could almost be a card carrying member of the John Birch Society.\n\n\"Merry Christmas, by the way,\" Fred mutters, as his uncle unceremoniously shows him the door.\n\n\"Yes, so it is \" his uncle fires back, \"and tonight, especially tonight, I'm in no mood for the Brotherhood of Man.\"\n\nSo, the Andrew Sisters it is then.\n\nDaniel then treats Fred to a terrific updating (well an updating to 1964 and the Cold War years) of Scrooge's berating of all and sundry at the beginning of the original Carol.\n\n\"Mind your own business\", he spits at his dejected nephew, \"and let everyone else mind theirs. Your responsibility happens to be your classroom. Not classrooms in Krakow, Poland; Butte, Montana [he's having a go at Butte, Montana now], or Johannesburg South Africa. Do you insist upon making it a better World? Wont you die happy until you do? Do you insist upon helping the needy and the oppressed? Is that some kind of an itch that you can't stop scratching? Then tell them to help themselves. Let them know the cash draw is closed and make them believe it. You'll be surprised how much less needy and oppressed the needy and oppressed turn out to be.\"\n\nHaving been told to stay out of his uncle's house and life, Fred catches Daniel off guard with a sneaky verbal jab and observes that, although they've never agreed on anything, they both have one thing in common, \"...we both have someone we cared the World about, your son, my cousin Marley.\"\n\nThe blow evidently lands home, as Daniel recoils at the mention of his dead son, Marley, and we get our first glimpse of where the story's going.\n\n\"The one solitary thing on this earth that I cared anything at all for,\" observes Daniel, as the two of them put aside their differences and share a drink, whilst standing before a portrait of his dead son, Marley, dressed in an army uniform and looking an awful lot like Peter Fonda.\n\n\"And to what end?\" Daniel enquires of no-one in particular. \"So that a life could be snuffed out? His fine young body turned into a bundle of bleeding garbage...in return for which I'm sent his dog tags...I give them a son and they give me back his effects.\"\n\nIn the course of the exchange that follows we learn that Marley died on Christmas Eve 1944, and that Grudge keeps his son's room - which is where we first encountered him at the beginning of the film - like a shrine. We learn that every Christmas Eve he sets a place for Marley at the table, and that Marley's favourite record was the Andrew Sisters \"Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree\". We also learn that, according to Fred, Daniel \"mourns the death of Marley less than you mourn your own personal loss of him.\"\n\nHang on. Run that one by me again Fred.\n\n\"You mourn the death of Marley less than you mourn your own personal loss of him.\"\n\nOne more time.\n\n\"You mourn the death of Marley less than you mourn your own personal loss of him.\"\n\nNo, still don't get it. What are the Andrew Sisters doing these days?\n\nFred then chides his uncle that he will go on feeling the pain until \"you realise the true tragedy of Marley's death. Not that your son was killed by another man's son, but that mankind still allows such dying to happen.\"\n\nHave the United Nations had anything to do with this script? You find yourself wondering.\n\nDaniel, though, is having none of this lily-livered liberalism, and his parting \"Christmas present\" to his nephew is a homily in which he tells him to put all his energies into \"developing the fastest bombers and the most powerful missiles on Earth, they'll provide a lot more security for our young, and for the rest of the World's young than all of your debating societies, forums, treaties and other forms of surrender and handout...\"\n\nFred, though is ready for him, \"of course you'll grant all other nations an equal right to put their faith and sweat and effort into trying to make their bombs faster and more powerful than ours?\"\n\nOld Dan, though, is not a man to be trifled with. \"Just let 'em try it,\" he snarls, \"just let 'em know we have the biggest and the fastest, just let 'em know we're not too chicken to use them...\"\n\nMy God, this man is bitter, and he's so ultra right wing that I bet the blind man's dogs would tug their masters away if they saw him coming towards them in the street.\n\nBut Fred has a parting salvo for his uncle. \"Peace on earth, goodwill to men, to all men by the way,\" he mutters sarcastically as he opens the front door, and then legs it before old uncle Dan has the chance to give him a clip round the ear for being such a smartarse.\n\nAnd then you realise, if you've not twigged already, that the purpose of this version of the Carol isn't so much to move and scare you as to preach at you.\n\nSo, for the next hour, the dialogue is peppered with grim facts and even grimmer statistics that, whilst highlighting the horrors of war, and the threat of an impending nuclear catastrophe, manage to, and I hate to be picky about this, put a right dampener on Christmas.\n\nThe central message here isn't so much \"God bless us, Everyone\" as \"God save us, Everyone.\"\n\n\"War is also a contagious disease Mr. G.\", the Ghost of Christmas Past will later tell Daniel, \"the only chance to keep this particular disease from spreading is to keep talking. So long as you talk you don't fight...When we stop talking, we start swinging, and then we bleed. Then we got problems, like winding up dead..\"\n\nIn all honesty, it is easy to mock the idealism behind Carol For Another Christmas. But to do so is to do so with hindsight and, in many ways, this was a brave piece of programming for Christmas 1964,when the World was genuinely looking the prospect of nuclear annihilation square in the face. Over the next 12 months more American sons would start heading off, in ever increasing numbers, to die or be maimed in a foreign country called Vietnam, and parents across the land would be asking the same question that Daniel Grudge is asking.\"Why?\"\n\nSo, the moral of the film was sound and, to an extent, and somewhat depressingly, it still is. It's just that the preachy, self righteous way it goes about making its point starts to grate very early on and you start wishing that Mr. Magoo would turn up and lighten the mood a little.\n\nWith Fred having departed, Daniel goes to close the front door and, as he does so, there in the glass he sees a reflection of his dead son, Marley. Hoorah, you think, the sermon's over. Turning, Daniel glances through the door to the dining room, and there he is again, Marley, occupying the place his doting dad has been setting for him at the table for the last 20 years. Except, when he looks again there's no sign of him. Here come the creepy bits, you think. Suddenly, the plaintive voices of the Andrew Sisters break the silence, and Daniel casts a concerned glance upstairs, just as Charles, his loyal butler, shuffles past, evidently oblivious to the ghostly tones.\n\nOh this is getting good.\n\nBut then, something truly bizarre happens.\n\nMarley fails to appear at all. Apparently, the ghost of Marley was meant to have been played by Peter Fonda, which is why the portrait in Daniel's house bears an uncanny resemblance to him. But, for reasons that have never been explained, his scenes were cut from the finished programme.\n\nSo, without knowing why it's happening, which, after all, was the reason for Marley's appearance in the first place, poor old Daniel finds himself on board a ship on a foggy night and, without so much as a by or leave - nor, for that matter, a word of explanation - he comes face to face with crooner Steve Lawrence, dressed as an infantryman with the World War One American Expeditionary Force (AEF).\n\n\"What is this place...some sort of troop transport?\" he enquires, without thinking to add, \"and what's it doing in my living room?\"\n\n\"You might call it that,\" the mysterious new arrival replies, adding, \"on its way.\"\n\n\"From France?\" Daniel asks.\n\n\"One of our stops,\" comes the reply, and then we see that the entire deck of the ship is strewn with coffins containing the bodies of troops killed in action in a list of First World War battles that the stranger proceeds to reel off.\n\nDaniel appears as confused as we are. After all, like us, he's not had the benefit of Marley having dropped by to put all this into context.\n\n\"You talk like the AEF, what's your name?\" Daniel enquires.\n\n\"I'm all of your AEF's,\" comes the reply, \"also the BEF's, the Huns, the Ruskies,\" and your heart sinks as you realise that the sermonising is far from over.\n\n\"I'm the dead,\" the stranger continues, \"all the dead. We're quite a stew.\"\n\nThen, finally, he introduces himself.\n\n\"Still, nameless as I am, I've got a terrific title - The Ghost of Christmas Past.\"\n\nThus do we realise that Grudge's Christmas Eve hauntings are underway.\n\nIt must be said that Steve Lawrence puts in a terrific performance as the Ghost of Christmas Past. But the exchanges between him and Grudge are so top heavy with UN propaganda and pro-isolationist rhetoric - the latter being clumsily scripted to show the absurdity of such a stance - that you find yourself in the strange position of not being sure whether you should reach for the mistletoe or a missile.\n\nAnd so we follow Grudge through his Christmas's past and present and on to the future which, as it transpires (surprise, surprise), is a post-apocalyptic future where the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, played by Robert Shaw, can't tell Grudge what year they've arrived in because no-one saw the necessity for calendars \"...after they rolled the H-bomb and nobody made their point.\"\n\nAs Grudge stands amongst the ruins of the Town Meeting Hall, we are treated to an appearance by the late, great Peter Sellers who - in a scene that is reminiscent of Dr Strangelove which Sellers had made earlier that year (and had then managed to fit a heart attack into the narrow gap between the two projects) - plays a demagogue who calls himself the \"Imperial Me\" and who is carried in aloft by his adoring disciples whilst the assembled mob scream hysterically in a manner not unlike the screaming fans that greeted the arrival of the Beatles on American soil that year!\n\nAs the final credits roll, you feel utterly drained, as you mutter to yourself that you will try to be a better human being.\n\nBut, all joking and cynicism aside, Carol For Another Christmas does have a certain nostalgic charm about it and the performances from the various actors are gripping, albeit depressing.\n\nYou can also watch several clips at the Turner Classic Movie Channel.\n\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL - ANIMATED VERSION - 1969\n\nThe editing is a little dodgy in this 1969, animated, re-telling of the story, but it does have a gloomy atmosphere that is not out of keeping with the book, and the Scrooge we are introduced to at the beginning is a delightfully unpleasant incarnation.\n\nThere is a bizarre moment early on when Fred, Scrooge's nephew, turns up at the counting house and, for some reason, feels it necessary to burst into song, accompanied by a full orchestra playing from somewhere deep within the depths of Scrooge's counting house!\n\nSince it's the only musical number in the whole programme, you can't help wondering if he did it simply to annoy his crotchety old uncle even more! Scrooge, however, gives as good as he gets and responds with a rasping musical retort, only to be rebuked, in song again, by Fred and his hidden orchestra.\n\nAt which point, Bob Cratchit - who, by the fawning look he gives him seems to have developed a massive crush on young Fred - interjects with a half-hearted handclap and an encouraging \"here, here,\" whereupon Scrooge brings the ditty to an abrupt halt, and, presumably out of concern for Bob's blood pressure, musical numbers are banned from the rest of the film.\n\nEither that, or the film's budget would only stretch to one musical number.\n\nMarley's ghost is particularly spooky, albeit Scrooge seems to black out several times throughout the visitation and, during his conscious moments, manages to, mysteriously, materialise in different parts of the room with such seamless dexterity that it's a wonder the ghost doesn't get fed up of trying to focus on him, call it quits, and tell him to stay miserable for the rest of his life.\n\nAll in all though, this version makes a good effort at re-telling the story, and its target audience - of which, given the fact is was made in 1969, I was one - would, no doubt, have loved it.\n\nSCROOGE - 1970\n\nWith Albert Finney As Scrooge\n\nBy 1970, foot stomping musical versions of Dickens works had become the order of the day.\n\nWe'd had Oliver and Pickwick and so the time seemed right to give Dickens Christmas classic the full razzle-dazzle musical treatment - they had a head start with this one since Dickens had, after all, written it in staves as opposed to chapters.\n\nThus Scrooge, in the robustly miserable form of Albert Finney, waltzed onto the screen, accompanied by a cast of all singing, all dancing, classically trained authentic working-class cockneys.\n\nIt must be said that Finney's depiction of the miserly old curmudgeon is superb and he, justifiably, won a Golden Globe for The Best Motion Picture Actor in a Musical/Comedy.\n\nThe sets really do capture the flavour of Victorian London, although I suspect there would have been a little less singing and dancing in the more poverty stricken parts of the 19th century Metropolis.\n\nAlec Guinness drops in as an, initially, quite camp Jacob Marley. In fact, he enters the room with such a convincing mince that you fully expect Scrooge to enquire \"are you free Mr. Marley\" and then await a spectral \"I'm free.\"\n\nHe doesn't, of course, and, for the rest of the scene, his Marley is quite creepy.\n\nEdith Evans appears as the Ghost of Christmas Past - evidently having forgotten to change out of her Lady Bracknell or Miss Western costumes from previous movies - and playing the spirit as such a sweet old dear that your first thought is that it's the woman from the Gainsborough films topping up her pension in her dotage.\n\nKenneth More turns in a splendidly jocular portrayal of the Ghost of Christmas Present and proceeds to get Scrooge so drunk on the milk of human kindness (which looks suspiciously like red wine) that it's a wonder he doesn't wake up on Christmas Morning with the mother of all hangovers and proceed to throw up all over the little boy he shouts down to from his bedroom window.\n\nIn this adaptation we even get a brief glimpse of the face of Christmas Yet To Come (I won't spoil the surprise) who proceeds to give Scrooge an almighty shove, which sends him toppling into his own open grave and plummeting into the pit of hell (you know it's hell because the entire set is painted red) where we're treated to one of the most surreal sequences ever to have appeared in a film version of a Dickens classic.\n\nIn a break with the book, and, for that matter, with other film versions, Marley returns and tells Scrooge that he is to become Lucifer's clerk, whereupon a line of hooded, burly, toned and topless male demons, with oiled bodies, proceed to wrap a chain around Scrooge, binding him to a post. You can't help but wonder, or perhaps it's just me, whether the Ghost of Christmas Present hasn't spiked Scrooge's drink and taken him to a dodgy pool party.\n\nAll that aside though, this is a terrific version of the Carol and the songs, although not particularly memorable, are most certainly catchy and you find yourself humming them at the most inopportune of moments.\n\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL ANIMATED - 1971\n\nWith Alastair Sim As The Voice Of Ebenezer Scrooge\n\nThis re-telling is narrated by Michael Redgrave in a tone that is so spookily reminiscent of the old Pathé news reels, reporting on the devastation of the London Blitz, that your first reaction on hearing the introduction is to dive for cover and await the wail of the all clear siren.\n\nAlastair Sim, provides the voiceover for Ebenezer Scrooge and does an adequate, though not particularly riveting job.\n\nGiven it's only 25 minutes in length, this is a quick jaunt through the story the chief glory of which is the stunning animation. The section when Scrooge arrives home is genuinely creepy, and the sequence with Marley's ghost is absolutely terrifying, especially when he undoes the bandage to allow his jaw to drop. Mind you, you do find yourself puzzling how he manages such clear enunciation of his words with his jaw stretched wide open throughout his entire dialogue.\n\nScrooge appears a little confused when the first of his supernatural visitors turns up wearing a dress, with long flowing hair, and with features so very feminine that its a wonder she doesn't take umbrage and give him a good slap when he addresses her as \"Sir.\"\n\nWe are treated to a whistle stop voyage through the visits of the Ghosts of Christmas past and present that manages to get the main points of the story in and which, again is beautifully animated. The depictions of Ignorance and Want are truly disturbing and extremely well done.\n\nAgain the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come sequence is rushed but, as with the previous visits manages to get the main points of Dickens narrative in.\n\nAll in all, whilst not an outstanding version, this is certainly a reasonable adaptation, beautifully illustrated throughout, and it manages to cram Dickens story into a mere twenty five minutes without losing too much of either the atmosphere or the moral of the original.\n\nTHE PASSIONS OF CAROL - 1975\n\nWith Mary Stewart as Carol Scrooge\n\nI suppose it was inevitable that, sooner or later, somebody would make a blue film version of the Charles Dickens classic. The only real surprises are that a) it took till 1975 and b) it's only ever been done once.\n\nWhen my researches revealed the existence of a pornographic adaptation two thoughts immediately crossed my mind. Firstly, how would they spell Scrooge's name and, secondly, what would be the nature of Tiny Tim's affliction.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not in a position to provide an answer to either question, nor am I able to supply any insightful comments regarding how faithfully it sticks to Dickens original story, not out of any moral indignation, but simply because it's not available in England.\n\nI have managed to track down one, decidedly un-titillating, clip on Youtube that shows Carol being led into her future by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (ooh matron) which, following an excruciatingly drawn out, mist shrouded tour of the flesh pots of what I presume to be Times Square, yields the memorable line \"spirit I don't understand any of this, it's just a cheap hooker picking up some creep.\" I wonder what the future has in store for Carol?\n\nMICKEY'S CHRISTMAS CAROL - 1983\n\nScrooge Mc Duck, the Scrooge Mc Duck, appearing as one of literature's most famous skinflints. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWell, to be honest, nothing.\n\nThis is a lovely retelling of A Christmas Carol with various Disney characters playing the parts.\n\nScrooge Mc Duck takes on the role of the miserly money lender, upon whom, incidentally, he was originally based, and presents us with the only Christmas bill you'll ever been delighted to see!\n\nMickey Mouse appears as the careworn and abused clerk, Bob Cratchit - whilst Donald Duck splutters his way through an Oscar worthy performance as Scrooge's nephew, Fred.\n\nGoofy appears as a delightfully clumsy, and far from terrifying, Marley's ghost, lamenting to his old partner that \"...when I was alive I robbed the widows and swindled the poor,\" only to have Scrooge misinterpret the intended warning as a boast and commenting \"Yes, and all in the same day. Oh you had class Jacob.\"\n\nAll in all, this is a beautifully animated and thoroughly entertaining version of Dickens classic, and anyone who argues otherwise should be boiled with their own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through their heart!\n\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL - 1984\n\nWith George C. Scott As Ebenezer Scrooge\n\nWhy is it that, whenever you see the words \"And Introducing\" in the opening credits of a film, you instinctively know that you're never going to hear of that actor, or actress, again?\n\nHow many students have, over the years, raced excitedly home from drama school, to burst in on their startled parents, panting, \"See, mum and dad, I told you those 4 years of dressing up as a banana and handing out leaflets on the pavement outside ASDA would pay off, they're introducing me in a new film\"?\n\n\"That's nice, dear,\" exclaims their doting mother, as she turns the goose on the spit. Father, meanwhile, nods his approval, and surreptitiously reaches for the local paper in order to peruse the situations vacant columns, on the off chance that McDonalds might be recruiting in the near future.\n\nI only mention this because we are treated to just such an introduction in the opening credits of this 1984 television outing of the Dickens Classic, when the words \"And Introducing Anthony Walters As Tiny Tim\" appear, writ large across the screen.\n\nIn fairness to him he did go on to play Liam Neeson's son in Shining Through, and the squire's son in the 1994 version of Black Beauty, so, as far as \"and introducing's\" go, he seems to have done alright for himself.\n\nBut, back to the film.\n\nIn this reworking of the novella, George C. Scott dominates the screen with a performance that is so masterful that it puts his Scrooge up there with the best of them.\n\nThe film itself is beautifully shot and, the moment it begins, you are overwhelmed with the sensation that you have been transported back to the 19th century; so much so that you can almost feel the cold of the chilly Christmas Eve engulfing you, as the acrid smoke, swirling through the air, seems to somehow fill your nostrils as your eyes alight upon the snowy, foggy streets of Victorian London, which, given the film was actually shot in Shrewsbury, is, to say the least, somewhat confusing. Still, it must be said, Shrewsbury makes a terrific bygone London.\n\nAs the fog swirls around the screen, a solitary bell begins tolling a mourning knell and the sombre funeral procession of Jacob Marley is shown edging its way through the streets.\n\nThen, the opening credits roll and, having been informed that we're about to have the honour of being introduced to \"Anthony Walters as Tiny Tim\", we find ourselves inside Scrooge's counting house, where Bob Cratchit informs us that 7 years have elapsed since the death of Marley. Wow, you think, that was a long opening credit sequence.\n\nBob then goes to put a coal on the fire, but his employer snaps at him that the human race invented clothes in order to keep warm, and so an additional coal on the fire is unnecessary.\n\nThere's no arguing against that sort of distorted logic, so Bob resigns himself to the fact he's going to have to shiver through the few hours of Christmas Eve he has left at work, and shuffles back to his work station.\n\nAs he leaves the room, Bob meets Scrooge's nephew, Fred, and they proceed to exchange pleasantries - of the \"Merry Christmas\" variety - before Fred marches into his uncle's office and subjects him to the familiar homily of how good Christmas has always been to him.\n\nNeedless to say, Scrooge, old curmudgeon that he is, begs to differ and gives his nephew short shrift, ending the exchange by declining Fred's invitation to come to Christmas dinner the next day\n\nOne of the few criticisms I have of this early section of the film is that the performances from both David Warner, as Bob Cratchit, and Roger Rees, as Fred, are a little too cloying and sentimental. Indeed, you fully expect David Warner to burst in to tears at any moment as he delivers some of his lines. However, this is more than made up for by the wonderfully gruff and menacing performance given by George C. Scott.\n\nScrooge then leaves the counting house, pausing to retrieve his top hat from his long-suffering assistant, and informs Cratchit that, in lieu of the fact he'll be taking Christmas Day off, he'd better be at work all the earlier the next day.\n\nSo saying, Scrooge heads out into the foggy, snow covered streets of Shrewsbu....sorry, London.\n\nBut, wait. Who could this be hobbling towards him through the snow, struggling to keep his crutch from slipping on the unforgiving ice? Yes, it's Anthony Walters, being introduced as Tiny Tim. And, my oh my, does he make a good Tiny Tim.\n\nFor one thing, he is, well, errr.. tiny.\n\nFor another, he looks ill and sickly, just as Tiny Tim should.\n\nIn fact, as he tries to wish Scrooge the compliments of the season, you find yourself wondering if he's actually going to make it through the rest of the film, in order to be able to deliver his closing \"God bless us, Every one!\"\n\nScrooge, however, is unmoved by the boy's haggard, sickly appearance, and dismisses him as a beggar - good heavens, you think, this man is hard and sharp as flint.\n\nJust how hard, and how sharp, we get to see in the next scene, when he arrives at the Exchange and meets with three businessmen who wish to buy corn off him. Scrooge informs them that, since they didn't make the purchase the previous day, the price has gone up 5%; and, unless they come to an agreement today, he snarls, the price will have gone up another 5% by tomorrow. The businessmen protest that what he is doing is totally unfair, only to be told by Scrooge that business is not fair. Reluctantly, the men agree to his price; and Scrooge informs them that he will not ship until he has their cash in his cold, grasping hand.\n\nHaving watched Bob and Tiny Tim set off on their walk home to the Cratchits' hovel in Camden Town, we rejoin Scrooge on his journey home, in the course of which we are treated to a wonderfully eerie scene in which he makes his way along an extremely gloomy and exceedingly creepy thoroughfare, pursued by a horse drawn hearse, which trots past him and then proceeds to melt into thin air, as a spooky voice intones \"SCROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGE\".\n\nHaving arrived at his front door - and having endured the vision of his partner's face appearing on his door knocker - Scrooge makes his way to the sanctuary of his rooms, where he proceeds to fill his bowl with gruel from a pot by his fireside.\n\nSitting down, he hears the same creepy voice intone once more \"SCROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGE\", and, looking into the fireplace, the voice appears to be emanating from Jesus Christ, whose Last Supper makes up the tiled wall at the rear of the fireplace.\n\nSurely, he's not going to be haunted by Jesus in this version?\n\nSuddenly, however, Marley's disembodied head appears, and begins darting around the tableau; and you find yourself admiring his nerve at turning up, uninvited, at the Last Supper, when he is, after all, as dead as a doornail.\n\nMoments later the irrepressible, much lamented, late Frank Finlay staggers into the room, weighed down by an onerous, mangled mass of metal boxes and chains.\n\nNow, I must observe that, when Marley undoes the bandage to let his mouth fall open, the effect isn't so much terrifying as - well, you think he's about to crack an hilarious joke.\n\nBut, Frank Finlay more than compensates for the lack-luster jaw-drop by emitting a positively splendid scream of spectral outrage when Scrooge informs him that there's more of gravy than of grave about him.\n\nHe then proceeds to inform Scrooge that he is to be visited by three spirits etc. etc. etc.\n\nAnd, with that, we're off on an oh so familiar journey through Scrooge's past, present and future, as the three ghosts proceed to show Scrooge the error of his ways.\n\nThe Christmas Past sequence isn't particularly memorable - albeit there is one Christmas miracle in that, when the ghost and Scrooge enter the classroom to find the solitary younger Scrooge sitting all alone, we learn that the reason Scrooge's father so despises his son is that his wife died giving birth to Scrooge.\n\nHowever, we are then taken a few years into the future where we are introduced to Scrooge's beloved \"younger\" sister, Little Fan. How can this be if his mother died giving birth to him?\n\nEdward Woodward gives a commanding performance as the Ghost of Christmas Present - at least I think he's the Ghost of Christmas Present, since he never actually identifies himself as such, and Scrooge, who has probably read the book a million times, and so knows the story inside out, doesn't bother to enquire.\n\nHe then takes Scrooge to the Cratchits' house, where preparations are underway for Christmas lunch.\n\nAnother minor miracle occurs when Bob hangs Tim's crutch on a hook by the fireside, only to have Tim come hobbling in a few seconds later with said crutch tucked under his arm. Tim then sits down at the table to tuck into his Christmas meal and, lo and behold, the crutch is back on its hook by the fireside. Darned clever these spirits.\n\nThe Christmas Present sequence ends with the spirit abandoning Scrooge beneath a railway arch, where Scrooge begins to lament his meanness, only to be rudely interrupted, mid flow, by a bright light coming towards him.\n\nAnd, there, in silhouette, is the shrouded figure of the ghost of Christmas yet to come.\n\nThis whole sequence is creepily shot and it has a truly atmospheric feel.\n\nAlso, the scene in which we witness the Cratchits' at home, mourning the death of Tiny Tim, is a truly moving one and it is extremely well acted.\n\nScrooge's transformation is brilliantly done, and a final scene that shows Scrooge and Tiny Tim walking off down the street together is genuinely heart-warming.\n\nA strong supporting cast backs George C. Scott's fantastic portrayal of Scrooge and, I have to say, I consider this to be one of the all time great versions, and one that certainly has the right mood and feel to both the settings and the performances.\n\nAnd, in all honesty, Anthony Walters makes a really convincing Tiny Tim, so much so that I think his depiction of the character is one of the best, if not the best I've watched. So, in closing, may I say, God bless him, whatever he's doing now.\n\nEBENEZER - 1998\n\nWith Jack Palance As Ebenezer Scrooge\n\nIn this 1998 Canadian version of the story, Jack Palance moseys onto the screen as Ebenezer Scrooge, a rootin' tootin, hard drinking, gun slinging, cigar-chomping miser who cheats at cards and thinks Christmas is \"blah...hogwash.\"\n\nIt is one of those films that is compulsive viewing, sometimes for the wrong reasons, and the storyline, whilst not deliberately setting out to be so, is riddled with unintentional comic moments.\n\nOle Ebenezer owns the local saloon, along with half the town, but is greedy for more and so we first encounter him playing cards on Christmas Eve and cheating short-sighted Sam Benson, played by Rick Shcroder (the artist formerly, and latterly, known as Ricky Shcroder), out of his money and land.\n\nWhen Sam remonstrates with the heartless old skinflint, a saloon brawl ensues with the hapless Sam coming off worse but, for good measure, Ebenezer confiscates his horse to pay for the breakages.\n\n\"Do you know what hurts me most?\" Sam later laments to his fiancée Erica, the daughter of Ebenezer's dead partner, Jacob Marlowe - who, because Scrooge has cheated her out of her rightful inheritance, the Saloon, has been reduced to working as a skivvy in the local brothel - \"he took ma horse, MA HORSE.\" Which, given he's just lost all his land and money, and with them any prospect of giving Erica the massive wedding we hear him promising her at the beginning of the film, makes you wonder about the nature of his relationship with his noble steed.\n\nBut I'm galloping ahead of myself here.\n\nSo, back to the saloon brawl.\n\nThe local sheriff, the \"long, limp arm of the law\" as Ebenezer calls him, turns up to see what the trouble is and, in the course of their exchange, we learn that the sheriff is, in fact, Scrooge's nephew, Fred, who is getting into the Christmas spirit by wearing what appears to be a box of chocolates on his head.\n\nFred invites his uncle to come and spend Christmas day with him and his wife, only to have the invitation flung back in his face with a gruff \"I'm spending tomorrow with the only person I care about, me.\"\n\nWhen Fred tries to give his uncle a goodbye hug, he receives short shrift, and a disgusted Ebenezer moseys on back into his saloon, where he tells his long suffering assistant, Bob Cratchit, \"next man who tries to hug me, I'm going to punch him right smack in the kisser.\"\n\nWhilst Scrooge is in his office, reluctantly counting out Bob Cratchit's Christmas pay packet, Bob sets about tidying up the saloon and, in the course of turning over the card table, he discovers the secret chamber where Scrooge hid the extra cards that enabled him to deprive Sam of all his worldly goods and \"ma horse, MA HORSE.\"\n\nRealising that he's been rumbled, Scrooge sacks his assistant, just as Bob's seriously ill son, Tiny Tim, limps into the saloon to give Scrooge a miniature horse that he's whittled for him out of wood as a Christmas present.\n\nScrooge, however, remains unmoved. So, to ramp up the cutesy tear jerk factor even more, Tiny Tim throws his arms around the old miser's waist and gives him a massive hug.\n\nSuddenly, you find yourself tensing as you ponder if Tim could, by any stretch of Scrooge's drink-sodden imagination, be construed as a man, and, for a very brief moment, you find yourself recoiling in horror at the awful prospect that Scrooge is going to make good on his earlier promise and punch cute little Timmy \"right smack in the kisser.\"\n\nThankfully, the moment passes, and Scrooge sets about paying his annual Christmas Eve visit to the local brothel where, surrounded by a bevvy of scantily clad beauties, he tucks in to a massive portion of turkey, waited on by Erica, the aforementioned daughter of his dead partner, whilst the pipe smoking Madame, Martha, bemoans the fact that he could have his pick of any of her girls but \"all you do is eat.\" You can see her point, how would he feel if all she ever did when she visited his saloon was roger the barman?\n\nMoseying on back to his living quarters, located above the saloon, Scrooge encounters a group of jovial carol singers and threatens to \"send you all away to a manger, the whole blasted bunch of you.\" Shocking as this might seem, it pales in comparison to a later scene when he throws the entire contents of his chamber pot over them from his balcony.\n\nThus is it time for Scrooge to be visited by his dead partner, Jacob Marlowe, who tells him that, yep you've guessed it, he's going to be visited by three spirits. Scrooge evidently misconstrues this as an instruction and proceeds to down three bottles of whiskey, awaking from the resultant drunken stupor to find the Ghost of Christmas Past standing at the foot of his bed in the form of an Indian squaw who initially mistakes for Pocahontas.\"I didn't know you people celebrated Christmas\", he snarls at her, as he points his rifle in the general direction of her head.\n\nAfter this awkward introduction, the two get on famously and the ghost takes him flying through the night, in a scene reminiscent of The Snowman, as they head back to his childhood where we learn that he grew up in Philadelphia and that his financially incompetent father lost all the family's money on a dodgy investment, causing Scrooge, who appears to have been a promising straight A's student, to have to leave the school he so enjoyed attending. At this point, the child actor playing the younger Ebenezer gives his dad a stare that is so menacingly demonic, that you expect Scrooge Snr. to burst into flames at any moment. \"Don't worry,\" his mother reassures her crestfallen husband, \"our Ebenezer will make his own way in the World. He'll take the right path\"\n\nWe then learn that Scrooge did, indeed, make his own way in the World and that the first step on his path to doing so was to steal the entire Christmas Eve takings from the till of his employer, the kindly old local store owner Mr. Fezziwig, and head West in search of gold.\n\nWhat he found, instead, was Rebecca, a pretty young thing, whose father owned the biggest cattle ranch this side of whichever river they lived in the vicinity of.\n\nWe witness the besotted couple getting married, then watch, open jawed, as Scrooge takes over the ranch, manages to infect the entire herd with some virulent strain of cattle plague, flogs the ranch to some unsuspecting Herbert who, evidently, thinks it perfectly normal for cows to lie on their backs with their hooves in the air, and then proceeds to chide his, by now bedridden, father-in-law for his ingratitude by asking, \"would it kill you to say thank you?\" Given that his father-in-law's immediate response is to die, you end up waiting for Scrooge to say, \"I'll take that as a yes then.\"\n\nHe and his beloved 'Becca then head for Canada in search of gold where, one snowy Christmas Eve, Rebecca, quite literally, embraces the festive spirit by running off with the local sheriff, causing Scrooge to end his appointment with his past by telling the spirit, \"people might let you down, but money never does. Put that in your peace pipe and smoke it.\"\n\nEvidently he hasn't quite got the hang of this redemption thingy just yet. One chance down, two to go.\n\nScrooge now finds himself back in bed, where he is woken by Sam's dulcet tones drifting up from the street below. With the ever faithful Erica at his side, Sam wants satisfaction, as in the dueling kind, and so he challenges Scrooge to a showdown at \"High Noon\" the next day, adding that they'll settle this \"the cowboy way.\" Unfortunately, Scrooge has sloshed back another bottle of whisky and, in his drunken state, he mistakes Sam for the next ghost and accepts.\n\nBy the time he realises his mistake, it's too late and he's committed to a shoot out which, if you think about it, is going to prove rather awkward if the next two spirits succeed in transforming him into a peace loving, none violent, overall good egg.\n\nJust when you think it can't get any worse for poor old Scrooge, nor for the viewer, the ghost of Christmas Present trots into his bedroom, riding a horse and dressed in a red tunic and white pith helmet that gives him an uncanny resemblance to an extra from Zulu. He's even brought a spare horse for Scrooge, who is more terrified by the prospect of the horses doing horsey things on his floor than by the fact he's got a spectral émigré from Rorke's Drift standing at the foot of his bed.\n\nOnce a reluctant Scrooge has been persuaded to mount his ghostly steed, they gallop off to take a peek at how other people are celebrating this Christmas. We get the traditional medley of Scrooge invisibly gatecrashing the Cratchits Christmas Day, witnessing his nephew toast his health, and watch him learn that most of the townsfolk agree with Sam when he tells him to his face that he's a \"thieving fart,\" a line that the editors evidently saw fit to omit from the text of my 1843 first edition of A Christmas Carol.\n\nYou expect the ghost of Christmas Yet To Come to be Buzz Lightyear but no, it's just a plain old ghost who transports Ebenezer into his future, where he learns to his horror that, if he doesn't desist from his drunken and spiteful ways, the last words he will speak with his dying breath will be \"Christmas..hogwash.\"\n\nAnd so Ebenezer is persuaded to reform, and he duly awakes on Christmas morning just in time to participate in the duel that Sam challenged his old self to.\n\nLuckily, when Scrooge takes his shot and deliberately misses, Sam's poor eye sight saves the day by causing him to miss the return shot and Scrooge is able to make good on all his past transgressions. And, needless to say, Sam is re-united with \"ma horse, MA HORSE.\"\n\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL - 1999\n\nWith Patrick Stewart As Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge\n\nIn the atmospheric opening scene of this 1999 outing for A Christmas Carol, a Victorian hearse, pulled by two black horses, and followed by two figures, dressed all in black - and sporting, if I might say, two particularly splendid stove-pipe hats - picks its way across the snowy summit of a hill to which skeletal trees cling tenaciously, as a blizzard rages all around.\n\nAs the hearse passes close to a camera, which some well meaning Secret Santa has left on the hillside, on the off chance, no doubt, that Patrick Stewart might, one day, decide to take on the role of Ebenezer Scrooge, we glide along the side of the hearse to glimpse a black coffin, that looks stark and so alone.\n\nEvidently, the coffin's occupant was not the sort of person who made friends easily, as no one has thought to send any flowers.\n\n\"I'll bet he was some hard-nosed businessman,\" you think to yourself, \"and one of the top-hatted figures, striding behind the hearse, is his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residual legatee (say what?), his sole friend, and sole mourner.\"\n\nOn arrival at a remote and isolated churchyard, where a sullen-faced vicar, accompanied by an equally sullen-faced group of mourners, are poised, ready for the procession's arrival; you find yourself awaiting the voice of the director, David Jones, as he shouts \"CUT! CUT!\"\n\nAbseiling down from the church tower, atop of which he has balanced his director's chair, he allows his megaphone to fall to his side, as he swipes his Directors Do It Standing Up baseball cap from his tousled mop of greying, matted hair.\n\n\"Didn't Charles Dickens write that Scrooge was Jacob Marley's, sole mourner?\" he quizzes - as the assembled cast and crew bow their heads in awkward silence and their eyes dart hither and thither in restless haste.\n\nAs the cigarette drops from the clenched jaw of Bert in the catering bus, and lands in the Gordon Ramsay, own brand, \"Coq Au F***** Vin Wholesale On Location Catering Mix\", Carole from casting shuffles nervously forward.\n\n\"I'm, I'm, ssssssorry, Mr Jones\", she stammers, as the director fixes her with a stare, so wilting, that it brings a decided flush to her cheeks, \"but the vicar said we could only use his churchyard if we let his sons appear in the film. And, it's not like it's cost us anything; after all, the parish Ladies Guild knitted their costumes out of used washing up bottles.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose no-one will notice,\" sighs David Jones, adding, \"I mean, it's not like there's anything called IMDb on which people, who really should get out more, will be able to highlight any of the factual errors we make; and, anyway, they'll be too gob smacked that we've got Jean-Luc Picard playing Scrooge to really care. Okay, Action!\"\n\nWe watch as Jacob Marley (1783 - 1836) is lowered into the ground; and then we join Scrooge, the vicar and the other mourner (whose name, we learn, is Mr Crump), as Scrooge scratches his signature against the record of his deceased partner's burial, and the three of them discuss what is so dead about a doornail, when, according to Mr Crump, a doorknob would be the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade - or, he adds, knowingly, a doorknocker.\n\n\"Nail, Knob or Knocker,\" snaps Scrooge, \"Jacob's gone, there's an end to it.\"\n\nLeft alone to \"grieve\" Marley's passing, Scrooge raises his meager glass of sherry, and, rather movingly, promises his deceased partner that the firm they built together \"will prosper.\"\n\nSo saying, he slams the register shut, and we find ourselves transported to a foggy and snowy London, where we drift down from the rooftops to join Ebenezer Scrooge as he strides through the streets of the Victorian metropolis, in which sundry, everyday, classically trained Victorians are making their preparations for Christmas.\n\nNo sooner has Scrooge entered his place of business, than the sign - bearing the names of \"Scrooge and Marley\" - rusts visibly before our very eyes, and, suddenly, Richard E. Grant is waving to us through the window of the counting house. No, wait, sorry, my mistake, he's rubbing the frost from the inside of the pane with his gloved hand.\n\nThe camera takes us into the counting house, where we get to assess the portrayals of two of the central characters, Scrooge and Bob Cratchit, the latter one of which is played by Richard E. Grant, which is why he was rubbing the frost from the inside of the window when we first encountered him.\n\nAt first, Patrick Stewart doesn't look particularly convincing as Scrooge. For one thing, he looks younger than you expect Scrooge to be. For another, he delivers his lines in a tone that is more RADA than rasping.\n\nRichard E. Grant, on the other hand, gives us a Bob Cratchit that is nervous and subservient, just as you imagine Bob Cratchit to be.\n\nAnd then nephew Fred, played by Dominic West, arrives in the street outside and peers in through the window pane from which Bob has, thoughtfully, wiped away the frost a few scenes earlier.\n\nMoments later, he's entered the counting house and, having motioned Bob not to spoil the pleasant surprise of his arrival for his doting uncle Ebenezer, he does a nifty little skip and bellows, \"A Merry Christmas Uncle, God save you.\"\n\nHis uncle, leans back in disgust, before leaning forward to continue scribbling away in his ledger, and Patrick Stewart growls an impressively throaty \"baaaahhhhhh humbug.\"\n\nThe exchange between Fred and his Uncle, in which Scrooge berates him for being a year older, but not an hour richer etc. etc., then follows and Patrick Stewart delivers the words about every idiot who goes about with \"Merry Christmas\" on his lips etc. with a sort of World-weary cynicism that starts you warming to his depiction of the character.\n\nAs Fred heads out into the frosty late afternoon, he encounters the two charity collectors, who are looking for the premises of Mr Scrooge and Mr Marley. He is somewhat taken aback by the fact th"
