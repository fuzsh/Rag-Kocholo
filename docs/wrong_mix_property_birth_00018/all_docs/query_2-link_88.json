Citadel: Diana stars Matilda De Angelis (The Undoing) as the central character and also features an international cast, including Lorenzo Cervasio, Maurizio Lombardi, Julia Piaton, Thekla Reuten, Giordana Faggiano, Daniele Paoloni, Bernhard Sch√ºtz and Filippo Nigro.\n\nCitadel: Diana is directed by Arnaldo Catinari and developed by Alessandro Fabbri, who is also the head writer, and wrote the series with Ilaria Bernardini, Gianluca Bernardini, Laura Colella and Giordana Mari. Citadel: Diana is produced by Amazon MGM Studios with Cattleya (ZeroZeroZero) - part of ITV Studios - and showrunner and executive producer Gina Gardini, with Riccardo Tozzi, Marco Chimenz, Giovanni Stabilini and Emanuele Savoini also serving as executive producers, and with the support of Italian Ministry of Culture - Directorate General for Cinema and Audiovisual. Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Angela Russo-Otstot, and Scott Nemes from AGBO, alongside David Weil (Hunters), executive produce Citadel: Diana and all series within the world of Citadel. Midnight Radio also executive produce.\n\nCitadel: Diana Synopsis\n\nMilan, 2030: Eight years ago, the independent global spy agency Citadel was destroyed by the powerful enemy syndicate, Manticore. Since then, Diana Cavalieri (Matilda De Angelis), an undercover Citadel agent, is alone, trapped behind enemy lines as a mole in Manticore. When she finally sees a way out and the chance to disappear forever, the only way to do so is trusting the most unexpected ally, Edo Zani (Lorenzo Cervasio), the heir of Manticore Italy and son of the head of the Italian organization, Ettore Zani (Maurizio Lombardi), who's vying for leadership against the other European families.\n\nAbout the World of Citadel\n\nThe first season of Citadel, starring Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas alongside Stanley Tucci and Lesley Manville, premiered to global success in 2023, becoming Prime Video's second most-watched new original series outside the U.S., and fourth most-watched worldwide. Executive produced by the Russo Brothers' AGBO, Citadel and its subsequent action-espionage Original Series traverse the globe, evolving the story of spy agency Citadel and its powerful enemy syndicate, Manticore. Each series born from the world of Citadel stars top local talent and is created, produced and filmed in region - bringing about stylistically unique shows with strong cultural identities rooted in their respective country of origin. The Italian Original, Citadel: Diana, is the second series to debut from the world of Citadel and will be followed by India's series, Citadel: Honey Bunny starring Varun Dhawan and Samantha Ruth Prabhu. Season Two of Citadel, starring Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, will begin production this year, with Joe Russo serving as director.\n\n# # #\n\nAbout Cattleya\n\nUnder the guidance of Riccardo Tozzi, Giovanni Stabilini and Francesca Longardi, Cattleya has been one of Italy's most important film and television producers for over 20 years. After producing, during its nascent years, feature films by Italy's most acclaimed writers and directors, the company, then, focused its activities primarily on television drama. Ground-breaking series such as Romanzo Criminale and Gomorrah are considered among forerunners of a new narrative style and rigor and have earned cult status. Building partnerships with Italian and foreign producers and diversifying genres have become Cattleya's hallmark over the last several years and have led to great international successes, such as ZeroZeroZero, Suburra, Summertime, Romulus and Django placing the company among the highest echelon of European producers. Part of this strand is also Citadel: Diana, the Italian series in the Citadel world, the ground-breaking global series executive produced by the Russo Brothers. At a more local level, it is worth mentioning the success of two detective stories with female protagonists, both well received by the public and critics alike: Voiceless (Bella da morire) and Petra. Cattleya along with writers Leonardo Fasoli and Maddalena Ravagli have recently launched Moontrip, a new production company focused on developing genre films and series marked by an innovative approach. On the international front, Cattleya and its majority shareholder since 2017, ITV Studios, recently launched Madrid-based Cattleya Producciones, a scripted label that will specialize in the creation and production of TV drama and films for Spain and the international market.\n\nAbout AGBO\n\nEstablished in 2017 by acclaimed directors Anthony and Joe Russo, AGBO's mission is to propel the next era of storytelling by developing and producing universe-driven intellectual properties that span film, TV, gaming, and interactive. As a powerhouse independent studio founded and operated by a collective of artists with decades of experience, AGBO has consistently shattered audience records with its globally resonant content.\n\nIn recent years, AGBO has achieved record-breaking success in both box office and streaming, setting new standards in global entertainment. The Russo Brothers and AGBO have had 11 number one global openings with over seven billion in box office including Marvel's highest grossing film of all time; Avengers: Endgame. Everything Everywhere All at Once broke records for A24 by winning seven Academy Awards including Best Picture in 2023. The Russo Brothers-directed film The Gray Man sits in the top six of Netflix's \"most viewed of all time\" list, and the Chris Hemsworth-starrer Extraction has become Netflix's most successful franchise to date. Additionally, Prime Video's Citadel franchise instantly landed as Prime's second-most-watched show in history.\n\nAbout Prime Video\n\nPrime Video is a one-stop entertainment destination offering customers a vast collection of premium programming in one application available across thousands of devices.
