        "text": "Are you curious about IF? Because we sure are – and we have plenty of facts to know about the upcoming film.\n\nBut what is this mysterious new fantasy film going to be about? And who is going to star in it? For everything that you want to know about IF, this article is for you.\n\nIF will release on May 17, 2024, according to Deadline. Before this shift, the film was supposed to come out a week later on the 24th, but it was pushed up a week so people get to enjoy it sooner – and so it wouldn't face a packed weekend of Memorial Day movies.\n\nThese include the animated version of Garfield and the next Mad Max movie, Furiosa, both of which will release the weekend after. So now, we have IF to look forward to a week before as part of the 2024 movie schedule.\n\nCheck Out The Trailer For IF\n\nAre you ready for mischief and wonder and… strange-looking imaginary friends? Because we are.\n\nThe final trailer for IF dropped in April 2024, and it features our cast of characters on an incredible adventure. It shows how the imaginary friends are forgotten when their kids grow up, so now, they all come together under a new roof to start a matchmaking agency to meet new kids – or else that vanish.\n\nRyan Reynolds, John Krasinski And More Will Star In The IF Cast\n\nWith the initial announcement of IF from The Hollywood Reporter in October 2019, it was confirmed that Ryan Reynolds and John Krasinski would star in the film, with Krasinski in the director's chair and writing the script, but aside from that, there are several other stars who have been confirmed for IF. In fact, the IF cast list is literally full of stars. Let’s start at the beginning:\n\nRyan Reynolds\n\nRyan Reynolds has not only had success with the Deadpool franchise (with the upcoming Deadpool 3 very much on the way), but he's appeared in several other successful films over the last couple of years, including one of the best Apple TV+ movies, Spirited, as well as movies such as Free Guy, The Adam Project, and more.\n\nJohn Krasinski\n\nKrasinski primarily rose to fame for his role as Jim as part of The Office cast but has undoubtedly established himself as a high-profile actor and director. He directed and wrote A Quiet Place, held a role as part of the DC League of Super-Pets cast, appeared in a surprise Reed Richards role in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and more.\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge\n\nIn October 2021, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Phoebe Waller-Bridge was signing on for the film. She is primarily known for her starring role in Fleabag, as well as the 2023 film, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nFiona Shaw\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter article about Waller-Bridge also confirmed Fiona Shaw was joining IF. She is primarily known for her role in Killing Eve.\n\nCailey Fleming\n\nDeadline reported in January 2022 that Cailey Fleming, along with four other actors, would sign on for the film. The actress is primarily known for her role in The Walking Dead.\n\nLouis Gossett Jr.\n\nFrom the Deadline article, it was confirmed that Louis Gossett Jr. would star in the IF cast. He has been in such films as An Officer and a Gentleman, The Landlord and more.\n\nAlan Kim\n\nDeadline also confirmed that Alan Kim, known for his role in Minari, would be in IF as well.\n\nSteve Carell\n\nIt’s going to be a The Office reunion because Deadline confirmed last that Steve Carell was joining IF. In fact, John Krasinski was so excited for his reunion with Carell that he shared his excitement about working with his former The Office co-star in an interview with Total Film in March 2024, saying that he was “crying all day” because of Carell’s praise of his work:\n\nCarell is also known for his roles in films such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Foxcatcher, Vice, Beautiful Boy and more.\n\nLiza Colón-Zayas\n\nWe also got word from Deadline in October 2023 that Liza Colón-Zayas, known for her role on The Bear, would appear in IF as well.\n\nOther IF Cast Members\n\nIn August 2022, Deadline reported that Bobby Moynihan (Saturday Night Live) signed onto the film.\n\nAnd then, in April 2023, the voice cast for the movie was confirmed by Deadline. This includes the following additional actors:\n\nMatt Damon (The Martian),\n\nJon Stewart (The Problem with Jon Stewart)\n\nEmily Blunt (A Quiet Place)\n\nMaya Rudolph (Loot)\n\nAwkwafina (The Little Mermaid)\n\nVince Vaughn (Hacksaw Ridge)\n\nSam Rockwell (Vice)\n\nSebastian Maniscalco (The Irishman)\n\nRichard Jenkins (Six Feet Under)\n\nChristopher Meloni (Law & Order: Special Victims Unit)\n\nJeez, talk about a stacked cast. I’m already eager to see where this leads.\n\nIF Follows A Little Girl Trying To Help Imaginary Friend’s Find New Kids After Their Old Kids Grow Up\n\nAccording to the trailer above released during the Super Bowl in 2024, IF will follow the story of a girl and her allies helping imaginary friends – otherwise known as IFs – find new children after their old kids grow up.\n\nPer the Deadline article from CinemaCon 2023 regarding the voice cast, Ryan Reynolds gave us an idea of the film's tone. When attendees of CinemaCon 2023 were given a first look at the film, Reynolds said that the movie is like a \"live-action Pixar film.\"\n\nI love all of the Pixar movies and have rewatched them repeatedly, so if I get the chance for a live-action movie that is like a Pixar film, I have an idea that I'm going to start crying my eyes out.\n\nIn an interview with John Krasinski from Entertainment Weekly in December 2023, he revealed his reasons for making the film, and that the concept was that imaginary friends are always “right there” and that we just have to look at them again. He revealed this to his producing partner, Allyson Seeger:\n\nKrasinski also revealed in that same interview how he created the IF’s in the movie, and how each one had to be personal in a certain way, “individual,” which also focuses on several other aspects, like timeframe, country, and more:\n\nThis honestly reminds me a little bit of the Cartoon Network show, Foster’s Home For Imaginary Friends, and I am here for those vibes.\n\nJohn Krasinski Directed The Feature\n\nKrasinski, as mentioned before, directed and wrote IF. Also previously mentioned is that this isn't Krasinski's first time in the director's chair, as he wrote and directed A Quiet Place, which not only went on to have a sequel but will have a prequel releasing in 2024, A Quiet Place: Day One.\n\nThe actor also directed The Hollars and Brief Interviews with Hideous Men. It's been some time since we last saw a film he made, and he's also been busy starring in one of the best Amazon Prime shows, Jack Ryan, which came to an end in 2023, so it's great that we'll see what he's been up to with IF.\n\nI know that we are counting down the days until we get to experience this excellent idea. Can May 17th get her soon enough?"
