        "text": "Are you ready for another season of treachery and deceit? Peacock delighted fans of The Traitors Wednesday by revealing the all-star cast for Season 3 of the Emmy Award-winning competition series hosted by Scottish screen star Alan Cumming (Spy Kids, The Good Wife). The first two seasons are now streaming right here.\n\nRELATED: Traitors & Deal or No Deal Island Contestants Talk Gaming Strategy with Joe Manganiello\n\nPeacock Announces Cast for Season 3 of The Traitors\n\nThe highly anticipated competitors on The Traitors Season 3 are...\n\nBob Harper (The Biggest Loser)\n\nSynonymous with NBC’s The Biggest Loser franchise, Harper was a team trainer for 16 seasons and then host for two seasons. In 2017, he survived a \"widowmaker\" heart attack, which prompted his own personal reinvention. Now married to Anton Gutierrez and a vocal advocate for heart health, Harper may be the most positive player in this cast.\n\nBob The Drag Queen (RuPaul’s Drag Race)\n\nA comic and actor, Bob is the alter ego of Caldwell Tidicue, who wowed the judges to become “America’s Next Drag Superstar” on Season 8 of RuPaul’s Drag Race. She also starred in HBO’s We’re Here and appeared on The Black Lady Sketch Show. Boasting a sharp wit from their comedy scene chops, Bob is going to have to manage some big personalities at the castle — something they have a little experience with.\n\nBritney Haynes (Big Brother)\n\nA reality competition show veteran, Haynes won America's Favorite Houseguest on U.S. Big Brother Season 12 and was a coach for Season 14. She also competed on The Amazing Race 31. Then she returned to compete in Big Brother: Reindeer Games, which also featured Danielle Reyes, so look out for a potential Big Brother alliance right from the start.\n\nCarolyn Wiger (Survivor)\n\nA drug counselor by profession, Wiger was also a very popular contestant during Survivor 44. So much so, that Wiger was awarded $100,000 by Australian musician Sia for being her favorite competitor ever on the long-running series. Fourteen years sober herself, Wiger is definitely going to play by the eccentric beat of her own drum.\n\nChanel Ayan (The Real Housewives of Dubai)\n\nThe breakout star of The Real Housewives of Dubai, Ayan is a supermodel and beauty line creator. She’s a renowned fashionista who styles herself, so expect the Scottish outfit swerves. Personality wise, Ayan has no problem being brutally frank with anyone who rubs her the wrong way, which means potential fireworks in the castle.\n\nChrishell Stause (Selling Sunset)\n\nAn actress-turned-reality star, Stause first became known for her work on the daytime soaps All My Children and Days of Our Lives. In 2019, she shifted over to reality TV as a core cast member of Selling Sunset, where she’s remained for seven seasons. She recently announced that she’s joining the venerable Australian soap opera Neighbours, which transplants her to the home country of her spouse, singer/songwriter G Flip.\n\nCiara Miller (Summer House)\n\nMiller joined Summer House, the Bravo Hampton’s reality series, in its fifth season. Professionally, she’s a part-time travel nurse and a part-time model. Hailing from Atlanta, she’s got an outsider’s view of the rich and famous but knows how to mingle with the other ladies of the Bravosphere.\n\nDanielle Reyes (Big Brother)\n\nReyes has a long history with Big Brother U.S. as a competitor in Season 3, Season 7, and Big Brother: Reindeer Games. She’s an extrovert and a leader, so she could function well as a Traitor or a Faithful. She’s also got a Big Brother buddy from the top with Britney Haynes.\n\nDolores Catania (The Real Housewives of New Jersey)\n\nA cousin of the infamously hot-headed Teresa Giudice of The Real Housewives of New Jersey, Catania first appeared on the early seasons of the show. But she eventually became a full cast member starting in Season 7. Voted as \"Miss Congeniality\" across the whole Housewives franchise, Catania’s smarts and even temperament could make her a formidable player.\n\nDorinda Medley (The Real Housewives of New York City)\n\nA main cast member of The Real Housewives of New York City from seasons seven through 12, Medley left the franchise for a few years until she returned in 2023’s The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip. She worked in fashion for years and post-Housewives wrote her memoir. She's known for bringing a bit of chaos to the screen, so she's sure to spark plenty of gasp-worthy moments.\n\nDylan Efron (Down to Earth with Zac Efron)\n\nThe lesser-known of the Efron siblings, Dylan is actor Zac Efron’s younger sibling by four years and works with him as a producer behind the scenes on projects like the docuseries Down to Earth with Zac Efron. Dylan is also very physically fit, having run multiple triathlons including the Ironman, so he's sure to be an asset during more physical challenges.\n\nGabby Windey (The Bachelorette)\n\nAn ICU nurse, Windey was also a contestant on Season 26 of The Bachelor before being chosen as the co-lead of The Bachelorette Season 19. She then competed in Dancing with the Stars Season 31 and went on to host the Dancing with the Stars Live 2023 tour.\n\nJeremy Collins (Survivor)\n\nA three-time Survivor competitor, Collins was featured in Survivor: San Juan del Sur, Survivor: Cambodia, and Survivor: Winners at War. He won the Cambodia season with all 10 jury votes, which just proves he can get his competitors to rally around him.\n\nLord Ivar Mountbatten (British Royal)\n\nThe only non-reality star of the cast, Mountbatten has gained his fame through lineage. He’s a second cousin of King Charles III and the first openly gay member of the British monarch's extended family.\n\nNikki Garcia (Professional Wrestler)\n\nA former professional wrestler for the WWE, Garcia performed under the name Nikki Bella and became one half of famous tag-team The Bella Twins. Together with her sister Brie, they were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2021. They also starred in the popular reality series Total Bellas. They’re both retired from wrestling and Nikki now co-hosts USA Network's Barmageddon with Blake Shelton and Carson Daly.\n\nRob Mariano (Survivor & Deal or No Deal Island)\n\nOne of the most well-known and popular competition reality stars ever, “Boston” Rob Mariano has competed on five seasons of Survivor, two seasons of The Amazing Race, and the inaugural season of NBC's Deal or No Deal Island. He’s a consummate strategist so look out for him whether he’s a Traitor or a Faithful.\n\nRobyn Dixon (The Real Housewives of Potomac)\n\nAn OG on The Real Housewives of Potomac, Dixon started the series as a main cast member but recently left the series at the end of Season 8. Professionally, Dixon is a publicist for a D.C. based PR firm, so she knows how to wiggle out of the kinds of personality conflicts that often come with being a contestant on The Traitors.\n\nSam Asghari (Actor & Model)\n\nThe owner of Asghari Fitness, Sam is a model, actor, and a fitness trainer. However, he’s best known in celeb gossip circles as the third husband of pop legend Britney Spears. The couple’s marriage only lasted a year, so this will be an opportunity to introduce himself to audiences as his own man.\n\nTom Sandoval (Vanderpump Rules)\n\nA main cast member since the beginning of Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules, Sandoval became the reality show’s villain when he was revealed to be cheating behind the backs of two cast members, creating a \"Scandoval\" of epic proportions. Let’s see how long he can last on The Traitors with his backstory so well known.\n\nTony Vlachos (Survivor)\n\nAnother former Survivor contestant, Vlachos has competed in three seasons: Cagayan, Game Changers, and Winners at War. He is only the second person to win two seasons of the competition reality show. It will be interesting to see if the three Survivor veterans will band together to form an alliance...\n\nWells Adams (Bachelor in Paradise)\n\nA contestant on Season 11 of The Bachelorette and Season 3 of Bachelor in Paradise, Adams then became the bartender for Bachelor in Paradise. Outside of reality TV, Adams is a radio host for iHeartRadio and podcasts with Brandi Cyrus. He’s also the husband of Modern Family actress and former Love Island USA host Sarah Hyland.\n\nHow Does The Traitors Work?\n\nSet at a remote castle deep within the Scottish Highlands, The Traitors features the usual missions and objectives of your average reality competition series. But here's the twist: hidden amongst the group of \"Faithful\" competitors are the titular Traitors, whose sole job is to eliminate the others and claim the $250,000 prize money as their own. It's up to the Faithful to root out these Traitors before it's too late. It's basically a more complicated version of the classic party game Werewolf (sometimes known as Mafia).\n\nThe show — which became the #1 unscripted series across all streaming platforms in the first week of Season 2's launch — is executive-produced by Stephen Lambert, Mike Cotton, Sam Rees-Jones, Rosie Franks, Jack Burgess, and Tim Harcourt."
