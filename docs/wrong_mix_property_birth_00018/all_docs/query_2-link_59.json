        "text": "Jenna Dewan, Channing Tatum and the Step Up cast never could have guessed they’d be part of such a wildly successful franchise when the first film hit theaters in 2006.\n\nDewan starred as Nora Clark, a privileged arts school student who finds an unlikely partner in Tyler Gage (Tatum) after he’s sentenced to complete community service hours at the studio he and his friends vandalized. The duo are forced to put their differences aside to give a show-stopping performance that changes both their lives forever.\n\nLike their characters, the leads were also transformed by the film. Dewan and Tatum tied the knot in 2009 after falling in love while filming. The pair welcomed daughter Everly in 2013 before announcing their separation five years later.\n\nAlthough Dewan and Tatum’s love didn’t last, Step Up’s legacy lives on thanks to its four sequels: Step Up 2: The Streets (2008), Step Up 3D (2010), Step Up Revolution (2012) and Step Up: All In (2014). The franchise expanded to TV in 2018 with Step Up: High Water.\n\nScroll down to see what the cast of the first Step Up film is doing now:"
