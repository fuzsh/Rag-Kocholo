        "text": "Starring Jefferson Mays\n\nBroadway's critically acclaimed holiday production! The yuletide classic arrives at the Geffen in a brand new adaptation by Tony winner Jefferson Mays (Oslo, A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder). This new take is based on the version of A Christmas Carol that Dickens himself used to perform on his live reading tours. Mays will be doing a master class of a performance in playing over 50 roles in this inspiring performance.\n\nAs everyone knows, Christmas Carol follows the story of the miserly business man Ebenezer Scrooge, who hates the holiday season and makes it a misery for his employee Bob Cratchet. However, Scrooge's life is turned around by the visit of three spirits, the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future, who show him the real meaning of the holiday season."
