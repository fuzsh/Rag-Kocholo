        "text": "Lionsgate has picked up the North American, UK and Ireland rights to John Carney’s musical comedy Power Ballad, which stars Nick Jonas and Paul Rudd.\n\nThe project, which was recently shot in Dublin, follows Rudd as a wedding singer and Jonas as a flagging pop star who come together to write a song to comedic consequences.\n\n“I’ve always been a huge fan of John’s movies, and I’ve had my eye on this particular film for some time. It combines the best of John’s immense creative talents with a marketable concept and an incredible cast. I couldn’t be happier that he and the rest of the team have entrusted us with it,” Adam Fogelson, chair of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, said in a statement about the acquisition.\n\nAnthony Bregman’s Likely Story is producing along with 30WEST, which is financing the picture with Screen Ireland and executive producing.\n\nAlong with Carney and Bregman, Likely Story’s Peter Cron will produce with Robert Walpole and Rebecca O’Flanagan for Treasure Entertainment, who worked with Carney on his last film, Flora and Son, which landed at Apple after a Sundance debut.\n\n“I am so delighted this film, which has been in my heart for so long, has found its home,” said Carney, who wrote the script with Peter McDonald.\n\nThe distribution deal was done by Charlotte Koh and Lauren Bixby for Lionsgate. 30WEST, WME Independent and UTA Independent Film Group represented the domestic sales on the title, with WME Independent handling the international rights.\n\nRudd is repped by Lighthouse Management & Media, UTA and Jackoway Austen. Jonas is repped by Philymack, UTA and Carroll Guido Groffman Cohen Bar & Karalian, LLP."
