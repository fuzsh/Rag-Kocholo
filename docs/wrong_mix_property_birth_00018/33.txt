Argonaut Theatre Company presents Charles Dickens - The Sparkler Of Albion, every Tuesday at the Phoenix Artist Club (Beneath the Phoenix Theatre), from 1 Feb to 3 May 2011.

Directed by Tessa Bell-briggs, starring Nik Wood-Jones as Charles Dickens.

Charles John Huffam Dickens conducts you through his life and works, from his birth near Portsmouth, through the troubled childhood that brought his father's imprisonment for debt and his own drudgery in a blacking warehouse, to the triumphs of his career, launched with the astonishing success of Pickwick Papers. Here he brings to life many of his immortal characters as he enacts scenes from some of the best loved works in English literature.
