This one of the very first (if not THE first) films by Alex Chandon, director of Bad Karma and Drillbit, two enjoyable SOV splatter flicks, as well as the feature length films Cradle of Fear and Inbred, which I have yet to see.

The "plot" of Chainsaw Scumf*ck is simple, some guys are hanging out in their apartment, somebody rings the doorbell, one of the guys answers the door and finds out that somebody is a masked maniac who wants to kill them all.

Being that it's shot with a 1980's home video camera, the video and sound quality are terrible. Shots are often very blurry, especially during the gore scenes, which makes it difficult to tell what's being cut up.

By regular standards, this is a terrible film, as it's basically just some friends goofing around with a camera, but can be enjoyed for what it is as long as you don't expect anything more than some friends goofing around with a camera.
