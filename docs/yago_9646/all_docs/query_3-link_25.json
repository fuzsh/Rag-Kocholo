Darrell Issa, chairman of the House committee on \\\\nOversight and Government Reform, took a major step toward holding \\\\nAttorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for his failure to \\\\nprovide subpoenaed documents and other information about Operation Fast \\\\nand Furious.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn a Jan. 31 letter, Issa had threatened Holder with such a move if he \\\\nfailed to provide all the subpoenaed documents relating to the Fast and \\\\nFurious gunwalking scandal by Feb. 9. That deadline has come and gone, \\\\nand Holder\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Department of Justice still hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t provided most of those \\\\ndocuments. Issa\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s subpoena dates back to Oct. 12, 2011.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOn Tuesday in a seven-page letter, Issa revealed that Deputy Attorney \\\\nGeneral James Cole begged Congress to extend the Feb. 9 deadline. Issa \\\\nwrote that the request was \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cironic\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cignores the reality that the \\\\nDepartment has unreasonably delayed producing these documents to the \\\\nCommittee.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn its face, the requested extension demonstrates a lack of good \\\\nfaith,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Issa wrote to Holder. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWith one exception, the Department has \\\\nonly produced documents responsive to the subpoena on the eve of \\\\ncongressional hearings in which senior Department officials testified. \\\\nThe Department appears to be more concerned with protecting its image \\\\nthrough spin control than actually cooperating with Congress.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe cannot wait any longer for the Department\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cooperation,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Issa \\\\ncontinued. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs such, please specify a date by which you expect the \\\\nDepartment to produce all documents responsive to the subpoena. In \\\\naddition, please specify a Department representative who will interface \\\\nwith the Committee for production purposes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIssa added that whoever Holder designates as the go-to DOJ official for \\\\ndelivering subpoenaed documents \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cshould also serve as the conduit for \\\\ndealing with the contempt proceedings, should the Department continue to\\\\n ignore the Committee\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s subpoena.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (RELATED: Full coverage of Eric \\\\nHolder)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe California Republican slammed Holder, too, for claiming the \\\\ncongressional investigation into Fast and Furious was a political game \\\\nfor Republicans.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRead more: http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/14/issa-takes-step-toward-holding-holder-in-contempt-of-congress/#ixzz1mQNF3g00\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"\"\"\n\n20120618222256Z,\"\"\"@ian21\\xa0\"\"Roger Clemens is the fucking man, and never did any fucking steroids because he is fucking awesome.

The \"\"everything is toxic\"\" philosophy embraced by the ONDCP toxicologists and controlling offices such as the FDA and DEA is the exact opposite of sound Christian theology [1,2], and the corollary truths built upon it are not Biblically founded, and can be proven to be Biblically incorrect. -And if it\\\\'s not Theologically true, if it\\\\'s not true in the Bible, than it isn\\\\'t true at all [3]. No Bible believing Christian can accept any \"\"toxicology\"\" studies or reports from the ONDCP in good conscience, when they consider the axioms that were used to build their studies. Do Christians adhere to \"\"scientific\"\" theories about big bang and evolution? No, and we can also reject the observations of the ONDCP about cannabis on similar grounds when all things are considered in a clear systematic theology. One must \"\"Test The Evidences\"\" that come from outside Scripture. Scripture, tradition, and reason imply that all things are good, and that substance (such as foods and drinks) only becomes toxic in it\\\\'s misuse, that is, in the uses that are not in order with the purposes God created them [4]. The Scripture\\\\'s warnings against these philosophies are traditionally viewed as warnings about the Gnostics of the second century. It was a blending of Jewish, Greek, or Eastern philosophy with Christianity. These Gnostic errors are widespread, they appear century after century, and shows itself in many forms of religion, not merely in distorted forms of Christianity. In life application today, we can see that same Gnostic germ resurface in our society in the influence of modernism and postmodernism. The war against cannabis is a frightening illustration, in that it is successful in stifling Evangelism within the local Church, and not many Leaders recognize what\\\\'s going on, despite the fact that it devastates the lives of millions in perdition. This ascetic teaching is unnatural, contrary to the constitution of the world as that has been arranged by a holy and wise Creator, and it is also subversive of Christian liberty. Nothing can be esteemed common or unclean without throwing a reproach upon the Creator. [5] To further discover the long term consequences of these unnatural teachings, we can observe the characterizations and acts employed in the war on pot have a resemblance to the warnings in Scripture regarding the signs of false teachers (which are directly linked to signs of the coming Rapture of Christ\\\\'s church). The war on cannabis shares at least 2 key qualities as the Gnostics. In the presence of the negative implications of statements such as \"\"there is no way to teach this to you in a brief, \"\" and, \"\"everything is toxic, there is no harmless substances. \"\", the Christian should be reminded that encouraging formalism and asceticism as the result of false teaching is traditionally known as the activities of demons [6]; and the acknowledgment of liberty of conscience in a free moral agent is the formation of evangelical theology- for this very reason the Reformers left the Roman Catholic Church! [7]. The binge drinking phenomena we see in the just say no generation, as well as the licentious rebellion in the 60\\\\'s, is evidences of the \"\"fleshly indulgence\"\", or antinomian development that results from these ascetic teachings. [8,9,10]To summarize; The Christian world view and the ONDCP world view can be sharply contrasted. In the ONDCP world view, the Truth is \"\"everything is toxic\"\" and application is \"\"just say no\"\". In the Christian world view, the Truth is \"\"God\\\\'s creation is good\"\" and application is \"\"be ye sober\"\". The Scripture provides us a sharper, more accurate understanding and response to the subjects of cannabis use in society than the secular drug use prevention community. And as Biblical passages are weighed and discovered as this more accurate Truth, it should bear witness that the Gospel message of Jesus Christ is Truth. We should lend thought to this greater spiritual Truth for which the Bible is compiled as evidence of; That Christ made atonement covering and salvation for our souls. \"\"For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that he world through him might be saved. God publicly displayed him as the mercy seat accessible through faith, all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, but by grace are you saved through faith, and it\\\\'s not of yourselves, it is a gift from God. For whosoever believes in Him will not perish. If you confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.\"\"\"\"\"\n\n,\"\"\"Start with impeaching this dumb ass usurper\"\"\"\n\n20120528150613Z,\"\"\"\"\"A lot of people like when oil and gas prices fall, but that's a negative for the economy, so you have to be careful what you wish for,\"\" said Schrader..............................................Maybe not.

You believe in the God of Government. With the first commandment being \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThou shalt pay confiscatory taxes such that resting on the Sabbath is not even an option.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Now that the riff raff have been kicked out of the private school, I guess that whole charity thing is shot too. Maybe, if you say \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHope and Change\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d a few times you might convince those kids that they are suffering for you, and their sacrifice to the God of Government will not be in vein.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s get back to the Government God, the protector and defender of all that is graft and collusion. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to hand it to all of you and especially Blagojevich, I am impressed, not only have you committed rape, and pillage upon \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe The People,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d but some of them thank you for it, they even get on a bus, and spit on people I really respect for you as you put in place the very plans that will destroy them.

For one thing The United States of America is still here, chugging along with all the accumulated dead weight that liberal democrats have heaved upon her. Government God is also upset that the people still have a voice, he doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like that. You, as his surrogate, should stop all free speech immediately; tell Kathleen Sebelious to issue another communiqu\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 threatening the CEO\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s of insurance companies with summary execution unless they place the blame for higher premiums on those that truly deserve it; breast cancer patients, and further, that it is wholly unsatisfactory that they should live another day - The God of Government commands it to you Mr. Obama, you will obey.\\\\n\\\\nThe bigger cheese is likely also upset at the Godless turn of events in God\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s country. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am the Lord your God . . . You shall have no other God\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s before me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Boy, have you screwed that one up. I imagine that is a big one with the man upstairs.

This was clear in anything and everything Starlin wrote following it (starting with <i>Infinity War</i>, which makes it pretty explicit, and was the next writing to feature Thanos\\\\xc2\\\\xb9), but boring, lame-o other writers couldn\\\\'t be arsed to keep up and went, \"\"What was his thing again...? Oh yeah, he\\\\'s in love with Death!\"\"\\\\nStarlin brought it up once after that, in <i>The End</i>, in which Thanos has clearly progressed far beyond that, but refers to her as his love all the same--though still in a way suggesting he had moved on, long ago, from pursuing this. She didn\\\\'t appear at all in what was to be his ongoing series (until Marvel pissed Starlin off for good)--that is, until Keith Giffen took over for the last six issues of it.\\\\n\\\\nI say this with love for Ron Marz (I\\\\'m a Kyle Rayner fan, even with his writing leading to an infamous comics-critical blog named for an event in *that* story...) and Keith Giffen. But everyone other than Starlin (including those two) tried to boil Thanos back down to a simplistic core: \"\"He\\\\'s the dude in love with Death!\"\" Though, to be fair, Giffen and Marz at least had a handle on the tenuous nature of his villainy, and even that it was almost abandoned--indeed, Giffen supports his aim to prevent the destruction of the universe as he writes him.\\\\n\\\\nBut no, he <b>was</b> the lover of Death. The same as he was once a Darkseid knock-off of sorts. The same as he once pursued power purely for power\\\\'s sake.\\\\xc2\\\\xa0 But those things all changed. Each story Starlin put him through over time gave him more and more dimension--as he asked himself at the end of <i>Infinity War</i>: \"\"And what now are you, Lord Thanos? Hero? Villain? Neither? Maybe just wiser.\"\"\\\\n\\\\nIt was shameful the way an extremely rounded character kept being sanded back down to two dimensions every time someone else got their hands on him...I actually got into a fight with the editor of <i>Annihilation</i> over this, who told me that the storyline of Thanos in said book was to prevent exactly what I hated: lame writers screwing the character up further (so I apologized).\\\\n\\\\nI grew up going \"\"Oooh! So many characters!!!\"\" when I first saw <i>Infinity War</i> on newsstands, but was taken in by Thanos and his peculiar character, which was neither good nor evil, nor even amoral or simplistically \"\"grey\"\" or antihero. Everyone turning him back into \"\"Oh, he\\\\'s in love with Death and wants to be with Death,\"\" was always such a waste of potential...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xc2\\\\xb9\"\"Death has rejected me.
