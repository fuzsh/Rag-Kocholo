        "text": "Post by stefancrosscoe on\n\nBurying the Ex (2014)\n\nI only bought this because of the name of Joe Dante, and well ok, I admit, because of Alexandra Daddario too. Anyway, the last \"new\" Dante picture I saw was of Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003), which I found to be a horrible movie, and I was very disappointed to learn how this once talented guy who used to made one great movie after another during the 70s and 80s, ended up with these big budget soulless CGI turkeys starring \"talents\" such as Brendan Fraser and Jenna Elfman.\n\nAnyway, Burying the Ex comes with a not so groundbreaking plot, where we have some whimpy guy called Max (Anton Yelchin) being bossed around by his psychotic girlfriend Evelyn (Ashley Greene), and one day he ends up meeting the free-spirited and sexy I Scream seller Olivia, played by Alexandra Daddario, and that means serious trouble as Evelyn do not appreciate any competition towards her one true love.\n\nIn a weak moment, poor Max decides to declare his everlasting love for his psycho girl, and in some freakish way, along with the \"help\" by some random statue lying around in his horror related shop, it later on goes to show that \"true\" love can survive anything.\n\nTo cut a long story short, the psycho bitch suddenly dies, only to come back from the dead to make Max's life a living nightmare.\n\nIt is not a very good movie, there is just too much cheap or vulgar slapstick \"comedy\" going on, and after a while with farting jokes, throwing up jokes and a extremely annoying and unfunny fat douchy sidekick (who we are gonna believe is screwing around with the hottest women in America 24/7), you end up with a rather poor and forgettable horror-comedy surrounding a theme/plot that has been done many times before.\n\nIt was a nice touch to watch Dick Miller show up here, not a big part, but still it was nice of Dante.\n\nI wanted to like the film, because of Joe Dante and him making another horror related movie, but this was not an impressive work, and while it never became boring, and I think it deserves a:\n\n4/10\n\nPost by stefancrosscoe on\n\nDead Space: Downfall (2008)\n\nAnimated sci-fi horror movie that seem to rip off a lot of classic sci-fi/horror/action films.\n\nIncredible dumb and silly film with awful animation, a script that must have been written inside the head of 12 year old boy's video game fantasy, lots of fucks, shit, fuck, shit, shit, shit, shit and more shit, and then for the sake of art, more fucks are thrown in, to make it look and sound \"cool\".\n\nEvery character is annoying as hell and the leading lady I wished a gruesome death within the first few minutes.\n\nThe soundtrack is a complete mess, where it seems to just rip-off that god-aweful sound Whooooaaaaaaaaa that is used to in pretty much any movie trailers for the past 7-10 years now, to try and make it sound \"epic\".\n\nThe voice acting is beyond garbage, and sounds like they just could not give a more flying fuck, \"Just hand me the money so I could escape this smelly turd, PLEEEEASE!\".\n\nAnd the \"icing\" on the cake, is that we get a whole lot of blood, gore and body parts sprayed all over the place, and as an even \"bigger\" surprise, there is zombies, a whole lot of them, groundbreaking material right there.\n\nThe only good part is that this turd is over within 74 minutes of run time, and if it had gone on for 10-15 minutes more, it would have been a 2/10, so I'll end up with a \"nice\":\n\n3/10\n\nPost by moviemaniac22 on\n\nSeen 'black mass' last year. If your asking for my opinion I thought it was good, not fantastic. But It will never hold a candle to classics like goodfellas, casino or godfather. Hell it couldn't even touch 'donnie brasco' I not sure why but lately It's hard to make a decent gangster flick. The last good movie was 'american gangster' But Depp's acting was the higlight and a few of the killing scenes. The running time was too long and the first hour was slow. However the second hour made up for it. The background music sucked.\n\nPost by moviemaniac22 on\n\nI honesty didn't care for \"Donnie Brasco\". Really could care less about Depp and his annoying ass nagging Wife in that.\n\nLast similar movies I liked were \"We are the night\", \"The Town\", and \"The Departed\". (I know \"Departed\" was a remake and loosely based on Bulger.)\n\n'we are the night' I vaguely remember. It was good. 'The town' could have been better. But the love story really dragged on. 'the departed' is fun and it has that scorsese hallmark stamped on it. Strange that people worship the movie more then the original"
