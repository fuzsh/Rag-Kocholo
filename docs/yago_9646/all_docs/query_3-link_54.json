        "text": "May 3, 2021\n\nA comic that screams for a raw black metal soundtrack. Mistress of the Macabre Q. Hayashida is back with a delectably weird scifi-something-or-other that's an easy must-read if you're already a fan of Dorohedoro.\n\nThe plot, such as it is, plays a bit like a riff on Doro. Teenage dude Zaha Sanko is burdened with an awful curse: purportedly his bones can grant any wish. As such every scumfuck in the dank universe he inhabits wants a piece of him. Not one to let this interfere with his life, Zaha wanders the universe with his dark paggy Avakian (think a skull-headed schoolbag that breathes fires...and can transform into a Geiger-esque skeleton!) seeking whomever it is that can grant wishes with his bones. Since clearly if they kill them, Zaha will be free. Or so the beleaguered spaceling hopes!\n\nI lost count of how much I cackled while reading this manga. Be it because someone was meeting a gory demise, or because of the nonchalance Hayashida's heroes display while meting out gory demises. The macabre humor, as in Dorohedoro, is relentless. Bones, bodily fluid, and organic growths are the order of the day in Hayashida's vision of inhabited outer-space. All while leaving room for corporate-owned elementary school starships, videogame-like powerups Zaha buys with bones he collects from fallen foes, black holes, and mystic darkness-powered spaceship AIs. Oh my.\n\nZaha and Avakian are a likeable enough duo. Hayashida doesn't answer much about their shared past, but the two are bloody, and bloody hilarious. They were a bit overshadowed for me however by the introduction of Shimada Death, Zaha's one friend outside of Avakian (Whom I guess is more like...a parent?). I can't really bring myself to say much about Shimada...their introduction, and a later chapter full of badassery kinda need to be seen to be believed. Suffice to say, the scene wherein they explain why they have no wishes to make was enough to cement a place for them in my ichorous heart.\n\nIf there's any weakness to the mad proceedings, it may simply be that there's less of a driving narrative going on here than there is a number of introductions and set-ups. It in fact reminded me more than a bit of the earlier chapters of Soul Eater. Or, once again, like Dorohedoro, which some accuse of being pretty meandering narrative-wise. I don't speak from experience, having only watched the anime and read the first two or three volumes of that series. I can only hope that Hayashida manages to drum up at least some sorta satisfactory arc for Zaha and Avakian. This volume does manage to pull a cliffhanger that gives at least some impression of where things are heading.\n\nBuuut I can't even really feel the above misgivings too too much. I loved reading this in a way I rarely feel with manga nowadays. It brought me back to the days of reading Berserk, Hellsing, and Gantz as a teen. Back when there was a more-than-usual illicit thrill in reading foreign comics about aesthetically pleasing ultra-violence. Maybe I'm just a simple dude who likes his comics slimy, dark, and spewed forth from a black hole. I don't wholly know, but I do know I fucking love Dai Dark 01, and am excited to open Volume 2's sticky, darkness-exuding pages whenever it finally drops out of the atmosphere like some blighted cosmic insect.\n\nAugust 31, 2022\n\nDai Dark volume 1 was a gritty, humorous, bloody introduction into an incredibly-designed necromantic world that I’m so eager to explore!\n\nI can’t even begin to put into words how much I adore this unique and wildly creative cast of characters that go along with this world. So much thought is always put into Q Hayashida’s work and you always can see it reflected on the page. Already I’m intrigued by all three protagonist introduced: Zaha Zanko, Avakian, and Shimada Death.\n\nIn an nutshell, it was worth every single star 😍.\n\nJune 22, 2022\n\nBizarre gory sci-fi horror by the author of Dorohedoro Q. Hayashida with lots of comedic sensibilities.\n\nHave absolutely no idea where this going to but I'm ready for the ride through Kahiya in Hyperdrive.\n\nCreative and gore-filled artwork. Not something you'd see somewhere else.\n\nJune 3, 2024\n\nThis feels heavily influenced by European sci-fi bande dessinée with its goofy, clueless protagonist bopping pointlessly between strange locales and brief battles while meeting colorful characters who either like him for no reason or want to kill him for a reward.\n\nI usually hate such Euro SF fantasy series, but maybe the manga-style art here makes it more tolerable because I'm willing to give the second volume a try.\n\nFOR REFERENCE:\n\nContents: Bone 1. Bloodbath Wanderer -- Bone 2. Fireball Mad Ax --Bone 3. Galactic School Days -- Bone 4. Allow Me to Kill You -- Bone 5. So Dark It's Scary -- Bone 6. The Hateful Four -- Bonus Bone: Shit That Happens in Space: You set off casually, then realize it's a hell of a long way.\n\nJuly 21, 2024\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐💫 4.5 out of 5 stars\n\nI added Vol. 2 to my cart right away.\n\nJuly 20, 2024\n\n\"Come dark flesh!\"\n\nSpotted this while at BN. Flipped through it to look at the illustrations and I was blown away by how gruesome they looked. Was sold instantly. I do love blood and guts strung across the pages.\n\nThe story was dark and quite comical. It held my attention from start to finish. The illustrations were wild and I had to go back to look at them again after completing this volume. Great start to a series and I’m excited to read more.\n\nOctober 19, 2021\n\nNádherný space road trip o přátelství, laskavém humoru, svlíkání lidí z kostí, střev, podivných mimozemských postav a to v krásném vizuálním kabátku.\n\nTenhle příběh o hrdinovi který má jako pomocníka mluvícího kostlivce kterého nosí jako baťoh- a samotného hrdinu se snaží všichni zabít, jelikož když někdo sebere jeho kosti tak se mu splní jakékoliv přání- vás prostě jen tak nepustí. Tohle je fakt parádní jízda, která nejenže nabízí černý humor a nějaký ten góre, ale zároveň je to tak hravý, i milý zároveň že to není možný.\n\nNavíc kresba má skvělý komediální timing a chemie mezi hlavní dvojkou je výborná. Tahle manga mě fakt bavila natolik že po dočtení objednávám dvojku. Jestli hledáte hravou jízdu s tunou fakt zábavných nápadů a hlavní bromance dvojkou, tak nehledejte jinde. Dai Dark je prostě překvapení roku!\n\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\ndritta dritta nelle mie cose preferite SUBITO. e adesso me lo rileggo\n\nMarch 8, 2022\n\nDai Dark is a Action, Horror and Sci-Fi Manga, Which Follows Zaha Sanko Who has been fighting for his life. As legends says, if you posses the bones of Zaha Sanko, you will be granted any wish.\n\nQ, Hayashida Does a Good Job Introduction Her Story and Building a Mystery around the main cast to take us in a journey in unavailing that Mystery. Also, Hayashida Does a Great Job in Terms of Her Art Work, in Both Dai Dark and Dorohedoro (her previous work)You Can Feel The Mustiness, Darkness and Strangeness of her Worlds. All The Gore and Violence Presented in a Way That You Can Enjoy Without Being Disguised.\n\nOverall, The Story is Interesting, Art Work is Great. Main Cast Seems a Bit Amusing. The World is A Mystery That I Would Love To See More of it and What Could Hayashida Bring To it.\n\nJune 13, 2022\n\nThis was bonkers and I loved it\n\nJanuary 10, 2024\n\nIconic art style, legendary comedy, interesting plot line.\n\nDecember 30, 2021\n\nWack space adventures, a lot of set up.\n\nI love it\n\nAugust 25, 2023\n\nAugust 2023. I posted some photos of this manga recently! Cursed teen in some sort of space mad max necromancy universe with a robot skeleton friend. Gory and silly and an absolute blast!\n\nI borrowed it from the library, after seeing the cover and being intrigued, when I was perusing for mystery manga series last weekend (I have a few on hold that aren’t in yet from other libraries). I could tell it wasn’t mystery but I flipped to a page near the start, saw the skeleton “Say okie dokie,” with a big happy smile and was immediately sold on getting both volumes.\n\nI was absolutely cracking up reading this and requested volumes 3-4. It’s very silly and often gory and messy. Our teen lead is some sort of dark being and there’s a rumor that if you kill him and take his bones they will grant any wish, so he’s constantly on the run with randos out to get him and demand to have his bones.\n\nHe has a robot skeleton friend caretaker and he befriends death at one point. It’s absurd and a fun romp while being full of some horrifying moments and visuals. I suspect this one would’ve been too gory for me in anime with color and sound effects, but with black and white panels it avoids being too much.\n\nCannot recommend highly enough for people who think that sounds fun and not too disgusting to check out. An absolute treat. My first series by the author and definitely interested in checking out their other stuff.\n\n“Dai Dark” vol 1-2 by Q Hayashida.\n\nFebruary 12, 2024\n\nTaking place in space, we follow teen boy Zaha Sanko who has a gift and a curse: his bones give him special powers but can also grant you any desire. With that, he is captured by a three-headed giant who plans to kill him for his bones. Luckily, Zaha has his skeletal companion Avakian💀 with him and they will escape their capture and continue their journey of finding the one responsible for Zaha’s deadly gift.\n\nIt’s a surprise read that I recently found at my library and I’m so glad I picked it up. “DD” feels a lot like a sci-fi version of “Chainsaw Man” with bones and filled with hellish-looking creatures. Sanko and his skeleton pal are a very great pair despite being opposites. Definitely proves to be another thrilling action packed manga that I’m hooked on, no bones about it 🦴. A (100%/Outstanding)\n\nMarch 17, 2022\n\nUma bizarra, mas menos interessante do que esperava, mistura de ficção científica com horror. Sanko é um adolescente que viaja pelo espaço na companhia de Avakian, uma entidade que se manifesta através de ossos. Há um constante saltitar entre dois mundos, o aparente real, povoado por personagens de moralidade muito duvidosa, e um de trevas, onde os devoradores de ossos se congregam. Criaturas essas que apesar do aspeto tenebroso e propensão para o horror, são no univero de Dai Dark forças curiosamente bondosas.\n\nAugust 19, 2022\n\nI just love Q Hayashida with all my heart. She rapidly became my favorite mangaka with Dorohedoro.\n\nI was really nervous about Dai Dark because glancing through I noticed a lot of the characters look like they came directly from Dorohedoro and I was hoping we weren't going to be lacking for originality.\n\nSo far I love it. I love that he had to go through school with the alias Meatball Spaghetti and everyone's just like \"yeah, cool\". I love his and Avakian's humor. Oh and obviously I would die for Shimada Death.\n\nMarch 16, 2024\n\nNot sure where this is going, but oh, what a fun ride is being.\n\nGore galore, but the comedy balances things out in a very nice way; and it's not even your raunchy manga jokes here and there, but something somehow far more endearing, which makes for a great contrast with all the bloody bits.\n\nI'll be reading the second volume soon, and we'll see if things start to get a little bit more defined, in this dark fantasy story, with a strong sci fi and horror component.\n\nSeptember 1, 2021\n\nLoved Dorohedoro, so had to check this out. Absolutely bonkers start to the series, over the top gore, surprisingly reasonable characters, a ridiculously detailed and singular style, a constant flood of creativity, a space story done in a way I’ve never seen before and just an overall absolute blast of a time. Highly recommend.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nI loved this! This series is so dark in aesthetic, but has a lot of heart and humor that makes it a breeze to read. Far less grimdark than the cover might suggest. Dai Dark is wildly inventive and fills me with creative energy and joy. I'll likely be keeping up with this one until it concludes, and am also now recommitted to finishing Dorohedoro!\n\nJune 11, 2022\n\nIt's really interesting to see Q Hayashida's take on scifi, I like how organic so much of it is. Already intrigued by the plot and felt like as chaotic as the story is, Hayashida still does a good job at giving you enough context to hold on to so you don't feel completely lost.\n\nDecember 10, 2021\n\nМалюнок якзавжди відпадний, сетинг хороший. Єдине тимчасова проблема, треба пам'ятати що тут вже немає Шіна та Нікайдо, то різні персонажі 😂\n\nJune 16, 2022\n\nHumorous and dark! Loved it! The art is the best out there!\n\nApril 13, 2023\n\nLes dessins 10/10, les touches d’humour on apprécie grandement"
