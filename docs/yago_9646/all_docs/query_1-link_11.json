        "text": "The overwhelming sense one gets from watching Karl Kozak’s The Unknown is that no-one involved in making it had any clue what their target audience was. For the most part it plays like a rather anaemic family film version of a Bigfoot film, with the usual collection of teenage stereotypes (the moody loner, the pretty girl, the not-very-bright-jock, another pretty girl) traipsing around the backwoods of the Pacific Northwest (the locations are particularly impressive, filming having taken place in the North Bend area of Washington and making great use of the region’s natural rugged beauty) where a mob of illegal bear poachers have recently been eviscerated on Echo Mountain by what the authorities insist is a grizzly bear.\n\nOf course it doesn’t take long before we find out that the real culprit is Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Ts’emekwes, Taku-he call it what you will (this film seems to favour the latter in the prologue narratiuon). Hot on the hirsute creature’s trail is the obligatory native American (spouting the sort of mystical guff that only white American screenwriters can come up with), a dour sheriff and the sole survivor of the ill-fated poaching party (played by Miles O’Keefe though if you didn’t see his name in the credits you’d be forgiven for not realising it was him) and his new gang off redneck morons.\n\nEvery so often (but probably not often enough) Bigfoot puts in an appearance and what he lacks in screen time he more than makes up for in volume – has there ever been a noisier Bigfoot on screen? Screeching at eardrum bursting volumes, you’d think he’d be easy to find, or at least be easy enough to spot sneaking up on you, but somehow he still manages to wipe out most of the hunters while the teens bond, learn to appreciate each other’s differences and notably fail to get up to any of the usual sexual hi-jinks we expect from our horny forest-exploring American adolescents."
