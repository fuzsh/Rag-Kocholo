        "text": "DAY 39, the final day\n\nHalloween:\n\nH40 didn't have to do a whole heck of a lot to be the best film since the original as the batting average of the series is not what one would call ready for the majors. But does it matter much when the best is still standing the long shadow of that most essential of slasher films, so frequently imitated and never equaled? It's then quite interesting that the screenwriters here use that very legacy and the discussions that have ensued about what it all really meant in the end as a big jumping off point, starting with a pair of podcasters that are trying to get to the bottom of what makes both Michael Myers and Laurie Strode tick after all these years. The film isn't blatantly meta, but it does give it an intriguing intellectual edge all the same as we see so much longing for answers and insight into the two leads. This does lead to an issue with there being a few too many characters dividing attention at times, but they do at least serve some kind of function by the time their fates are settled. There are some bits of humor that don't entirely work with the format, a particular one involving a young black child that is really on the nose comes to mind, but they do little to dissuade from the interest the script generates on its own merits.\n\nForty years in an institution has done little to dull Michael's instincts and certainly his strength, as his inevitable escape brings with him a wave of carnage that really hasn't been seen before in a Halloween film: what he lacks in number of showcase moments, he more than makes up for in sheer ruthlessness and efficiency, giving him a nasty edge that makes him a damn credible threat and bring back some of the same elemental qualities that he had in the original, with a far more gruesome playfulness and an unsparing attitude to anyone that he targets. On the other end, Jamie Lee Curtis returns to Laurie once more, and the film doesn't waste any of your time by presenting her as anything other than the kind of person she would be in her situation: traumatized and broken, but doing everything she can to make sure understand the danger and how to keep themselves when it does happen. It's a surprisingly elegant characterization that Curtis plays beautifully, and though she's not as nimble as she was in H20, she brings a great physical presence with her that makes her feel like a credible threat to Michael's near-supernatural strength. The rest of the cast is more than fine, though the chemistry that Judy Greer and Andi Matichak have with Curtis as her daughter and granddaughter is a real highlight and helps give the film's finale a really great emotional investment.\n\nWhat of the direction, then? David Gordon Green has long wanted to make a horror film, and it's hard to imagine how giddy he must have been when he was approached to craft his own take on the series. He makes a surprising yet correct choice: he literally does just that with making his own take. There are certainly nods throughout to other films in the series and familiar shots that are ever so subverted, but rather than aping Carpenter's techniques, he puts his own signature on the film from start to finish, with its more intimate character focus than we got in the original and a good sense to handle the more brutal violence in ways that gets the point across without feeling like he's catering to gorehounds exclusively. It's an unexpected delight after so many journeymen have been through the series to get something stylish again without it being Carpenter's style wholesale, while still crafting some damn fine sequences of suspense and terror that hold up quite favorably to the original, culminating in a killer climax that pulls out all the stops to deliver on everything you could want in a final showdown. And whatever magic he had that managed to rub off on Carpenter and company to turn in the soundtrack that they pulled off here may just be the most valuable commodity on the face of the planet, as even my highest expectations for Carpenter's return to the world of soundtracks did not prepare me for the peerless work that they turn in here, and it might actually be not only the strongest soundtrack in the entire series, but perhaps the strongest one that Carpenter has composed in his long and storied career.\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that this isn't as good as the original, as there's no way to match not only its genre-defining techniques, but also its iconography that's become famous the world over. It's also not a bad thing to not be as good as a masterpiece, as taken on its own merits, it's a great follow-up to that film that is respectful without being enslaved to it and also finding ways to make its continued discussion over the years an important part of its story. When I started my marathon this year, I was wondering just how the journey would ultimately end, now having seen so many films now to get a sense of the way the genre has grown and evolved over the course of 122 years. It turns out that this was the best possible way to end it, not only for a genuinely entertaining and exciting film to be capper, but one that takes everything that has come before and does everything it can to do something we haven't seen before. To some, that might just be as simple as making a Halloween sequel that doesn't suck, but for me, it was great to see a real passion for doing something new with something that only seems so old because it's so well worn. That's a real testament to the endurance of the genre I love so much as much as it is a nice summary of this film.\n\nSummaries to come in the next couple of days!\n\nHADDONFIELD, ILLINOIS\n\nHALLOWEEN NIGHT\n\n2018\n\n31) Suspiria (2018) [NEW]\n\nSuspiria (1977) is one of the most influential horror films ever created, so it's no secret that 40ish years later, everyone expects big things from the much anticipated reimagining.\n\nComing fresh off the heels of the Academy Nominated film \"Call Me By Your Name,\" director Luca Guadagnino brings Suspiria back to the silver screen with a lot more world and character building than it's predecessor. Gone are Argento's bright and vibrant colors that audiences have grown to associate Suspiria with and in its place a more realistic setting with a much bleaker color scheme. Argento was also known for his creative ways of lighting a scene, almost making the world resemble an \"Alice in Wonderland\" feel. These are two of many things that made the original special that don't standout as prominently in this new film.\n\nThat's not to say that Guadagnino didn't use an array of colors in this new world because I would be wrong to say so. The blues, reds and greens make a return, but in a fashion that blends them into the world a bit more discreetly. The main characters are largely the same, with a couple new welcome additions. Jessica Harper, who played Susie Bannion in the original adaption, makes a return in a new role this time around. Also, you'll be happy to know that the term \"feeling the cut\" returns in this film. Argento was all about watching the knife go in, and Guadagnino keeps up the tradition!\n\nBut this IS a much different film and Guadagnino's direction is largely the reason for this. The film is a lot slower paced than the original, and with a runtime of around two and a half hours, some parts of the movie can seem quite dragged out and a little dull. There are also a lot more camera cuts in this rendition. It was actually something that took me a bit to get used to. There are many fast cuts from here to there that in the beginning is almost naeuseating. Once the first chapter (the film has 6 chapters and an epilogue), i didn't bother me as much. Also, this film is quite graphic... like very graphic. If you're familiar with Guadanino's former works, you'll know what to expect, so expect that plus more.\n\nGoblin. No Goblin this time around, but there are two standout tracks by Thom Yorke of Radiohead ( who composed the entire soundtrack) that I really like: The Hooks and Volk. Paired with the scenes they play in, those songs truly took my breath away in the theater.\n\nThe coven members now all have on-screen names, and with that, comes a lot of individuality, which I found to be a big positive. Blanc and Tanner were really the only two to have that sort of individuality in the original. I actually found Ingrid Caven's character to be among one of my favorites and of course, Tilda Swinson's performance is amazing. Probably my favorite of hers that I've ever seen.\n\nThe film is good. It might even be great, but I really need some time for it to settle. When the credits rolled, I was kind of lost. I still am. I did enjoy the film, although I ultimately prefer the original, but the pacing really got to me.\n\nThere are some very creative ideas displayed in this film and it's one of the few horror remakes that truly stands on its own. It's such a different film than the original that with a few tweaks to the script, it could have been its own thing.\n\nI went in with low expectations and came out not knowing what to think except that I do appreciate that Guadagnino did his own thing with having to worry about pleasing loyalists of the original. Both films have their own place in history, so if you don't like one, hopefully the other is more up your alley.\n\nI can't imagine a better way to end 31 Nights of Horror than with this film though. None other would have my mind spiraling like it is right now.\n\nHappy Halloween everyone!\n\n27) Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970) (Oct 27)\n\nI've been going though Hammer's vampire movies during the marathon starting with the Karnstein trilogy and then going back and doing the Dracula series. After 8 of these fairly similar Gothic vampire movies, I've long since run out of things to say about them. Thankfully this one has a little more originality than a lot of the others and a rather unique set up.\n\nTaking place immediately after the finale of Dracula Has Risen from the Grave, a shopkeeper witnesses Dracula's final moments as his corpse decays into powered blood and a collection of tacky fashion accessories. Elsewhere, three distinguished gentlemen who have formed a secret circle to enjoy the more unusual aspects of life have become bored with their usual pleasures. Upon meeting the disgraced Lord Courtley who has been disowned by his father for practising the black arts, the gentlemen seek Courtley's advice to find new excitement. Courtley's suggestion: To sell their souls to the devil and resurrect the most evil man of all time. Count Dracula.\n\nThe setup with the three \"gentlemen\" really makes this one. Their bumbling not only resurrects Dracula, but also brings his wrath upon them. Perhaps a bit out of character for him, Dracula vows revenge on them and he basically becomes a slasher villain, only he has his enchanted underlings do the dirty work. It's really bizarre and a nice change of pace from the other Hammer Dracula offerings.\n\nThe end is a bit sloppy and feels like they didn't know what to do with it, but fun characters and performances make this one an easy recommendation for fans of the series.\n\nRecommended. 3 / 5\n\n28) Hellraiser: Judgment (2018) (Oct 28)\n\nHellraiser is another series I've been going though yearly with the marathon, starting with the original way back during my first year in 2011. I'm rather forgiving of the lesser films in the series and think they all at least have something interesting about them, yes, even Hellraiser: Revelations. When I started hearing praise for this one, I was pretty excited since that's rare for anything in the series after the second movie.\n\nTwo brother police detectives are trying catch a serial killer who cruelly mutilates his victims while Pinhead and the Cenobites are now some kind of bureaucratic gatekeepers for both heaven and hell.\n\nYeah... so... after a promising and disgustingly icky intro, this one quickly falls apart. Admittedly, it's been a while since I've watched them and read the book, but the mythology in this doesn't really fit in with the earlier works, in my opinion. The whole audit thing just feels so out of place. Is Pinhead an office drone now? Does he show up in dungarees on Casual Fridays? The Cenobites working under an angel is so weird. I don't recall heaven and God being an active part of the series before. Perhaps worst of all, Lemarchand's Boxes are seemingly just shoved in because they had to get the Lament Configuration in there somewhere. People are summoned or collected for judgment though other means.\n\nAnd then there's the budgetary issues. As poor as they were, the previous STV sequels (excluding Revelations) still looked like movies. This was shot on digital and looks super cheap, with dreadful acting to match. The only real pros I found here were the makeup effects were pretty good (though the new creatures don't feel \"Hellraiser\" at all) and the actor portraying Pinhead was a massive upgrade from the disastrous Revelations guy.\n\nThis was just boring as hell. Maybe there's some clever ideas in it somewhere, but everything is buried under the slow pacing, godawful performances and ugly look of the film.\n\nSkip it. 1 / 5\n\n29) Hack-O-Lantern (1988) (Oct 29)\n\nHack-O-Lantern is part slasher, part Satanic cult movie and part 80s hair metal music video – and that's not even including the part where the movie stops dead in its tracks so a random guy can do his stand up comedy act!\n\nTommy, a young boy is visited by his badly acted Grandpa before Halloween and given gifts including a pumpkin and a strange necklace. Upon discovering Tommy had been visited by his grandfather, his badly acted mother smashes the pumpkin in anger as Tommy is forbidden from seeing the old man. Years later, Tommy is now a badly acted adult who lives in his badly acted mothers basement and angrily lifts heavy things. Over the years, Grandpa has been preparing Tommy to be inducted into his Satanic cult where he wears a plaid shirt until his robes. Talk about a fashion faux pas! With Halloween around the corner, it's time for Tommy's ceremony. Oh, and there's some random murders and shit too.\n\nThis one is a trip. It's an explosion of 80s cheese with everything you'd expect from the time. Delightfully goofy with one of the most bizarre performances I've ever seen thanks to Grandpa's actor, this is a lot of fun. The real surprise here is that there's an actual real plot with foreshadowing and character motivation and everything! You may not notice it because of how inept everything else is, but it's there, I swear!\n\nFilms like this are hard to score because it's clearly awful, but for the right type of viewer it'll be a great time. If you're into stuff like Juan Piquer Simón's Pieces or other awful(ly fun) 80s slashers, check it out.\n\nRecommended for cheese fans, avoid for people who want actual quality. 2.5 / 5\n\nBonus 04) The Return of the Living Dead (1985) (Oct 29) (rewatch)\n\nIn honour of James Karen who passed away on Oct 23rd, I just had to fit in a viewing of The Return of the Living Dead.\n\nNot much new to say about this masterpiece. It's a riot from start to finish. James Karen is so great in this and Thom Mathews plays off him wonderfully. They're such a fantastic comedy duo, it's easy to see why they were brought back for the sequel where they again steal all the scenes they're in.\n\nIf I were to say anything constructive about The Return of the Living Dead, it would be the final act isn't quite as strong as the rest of the movie, and the direction falls apart a bit with the slow motion/still shots and reused footage in the ending.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n30) Bone Tomahawk (2015) (Oct 30)\n\nA hard as nails, no nonsense sheriff and his posse set out to rescue a group kidnapped from town by a pack of cannibalistic troglodytes.\n\nThis is one I've had sitting in my pile for years and I'm glad I finally got to it. I loved it. It's a slow burn western that focuses mostly on the cast of characters and their trek across the land, but when the horror action kicks in, it's swift and brutal as hell. Very powerful stuff. Kurt Russell is perfect in his role and the character fits him like a glove, but the real star of this one is Richard Jenkins as Chicory, his faithful backup deputy. I really don't want to say too much more about this one because if you haven't seen it, you need to. Really great movie with a fantastic ending.\n\nHighly recommended. 4 / 5\n\n31) Spirits of the Dead (1968) (Oct 31)\n\nI wanted to end off with an anthology, so I went with Spirits of the Dead which features adaptations of three stories by Edgar Allan Poe from three European directors. The segments are as follows:\n\nMetzengerstein (directed by Roger Vadim) – Yikes. We're off to a bad start here. Jane Fonda plays a cruel and sadistic countess who becomes enamoured with her reclusive cousin. If I say anything else I'd risk spoiling it because there's so little to this one. Slow and dreary, this feels mostly like it was put together as an excuse to ogle Jane Fonda for 40 minutes (Roger Vadim also directed Barbarella). I'm sure there's worse ways you could spend your time, but other than Fonda and some interesting period costuming there isn't anything worthwhile here.\n\nWilliam Wilson (directed by Louis Malle) – An improvement over the previous story. Alain Delon plays a cruel and sadistic man (I'm detecting a morality theme here) who his haunted by his better half double. Nothing too surprising or shocking here for modern audiences, but there's a nicely shot card game with Brigitte Bardot and the pacing is much better.\n\nToby Dammit (directed by Federico Fellini) – Thankfully this is the strongest of the bunch. Terence Stamp plays Toby Dammit, a pale faced English actor with one of the coolest names ever, who has been flown in to Italy for a role. Drunk and haunted by visions of his personal Devil, Dammit is praised and idolized by the Italian press while he sits, lost in his own disinterest as he waits for the Ferrari he was promised for his participation. I can't say much more than that, but this one is super Italian, and ends the film strongly.\n\nOne weak story, one passable and one decent with with a strong end. Overall, this is safe to skip. 2 / 5\n\nBonus 05) The Haunting of Hill House (2018) (TV Season 1)\n\nI wasn't planning on watching The Haunting of Hill House for the marathon as I try to keep things movie related, but I had it recommended to me so I threw it in as a bonus viewing.\n\nAs I said before, I'm not really a fan of haunted house/paranormal movies so all the SCARY FACES stuff was mostly boring to me, but I was really engaged by the drama and mystery of the story and 10 the episodes just flew by.\n\nWhile I emotionally liked the ending, it was very bittersweet and maybe a bit too happy/cheesy. I think something darker and more bleak would have fit the rest of the material better.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed The Haunting of Hill House and hopefully Netflix is smart enough to have Mike Flanagan do something new next year instead of trying to make a second season for this.\n\nHighly recommended. 4 / 5\n\nFinal Viewed List:\n\n01) Frogs (1972) (Oct 1) - 1 / 5\n\n02) The Food of the Gods (1976) (Oct 2) - 3 / 5\n\n03) Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981) (Oct 3) - 1.5 / 5\n\n04) Shakma (1990)(Oct 4) - 1 / 5\n\n05) Alligator (1980) (Oct 5) - 3 / 5\n\n06) Beyond the Black Rainbow (2010) (Oct 6) - 2 / 5\n\nBonus 01) The Frighteners (1996) (Oct 6) (rewatch)\n\n07) Thirsty for Love, Sex and Murder (1972) (Oct 8) - 0.5 / 5 (4 / 5)*\n\n08) So Sweet, So Dead (1972) (Oct 8) - 3 / 5\n\n09) Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye (1973) (Oct 9) - 4 / 5\n\n10) The Killer Reserved Nine Seats (1974) (Oct 10) - 3 / 5\n\n11) The Perfume of the Lady in Black (1974) (Oct 11) - 3.5 / 5\n\n12) The House with Laughing Windows (1976) (Oct 13) - 3 / 5\n\n13) Masks (2011) (Oct 14) - 3 / 5\n\n14) Mandy (2018) (Oct 15) - 3.5 / 5\n\n15) Altered States (1980) (Oct 16) - 2.5 / 5\n\n16) Jacob's Ladder (1990) (Oct 17) - 4.5 / 5\n\n17) Starry Eyes (2014) (Oct 18) - 4 / 5\n\n18) Rabid (1977) (Oct 19) - 3.5 / 5\n\n19) Upgrade (2018) (Oct 19) - 3.5 / 5\n\n20) I Am a Hero (2015) (Oct 20) - 4.5 / 5\n\nBonus 02) Train to Busan (2016) (Oct 20) (rewatch)\n\n21) Seoul Station (2016) (Oct 21) - 4 / 5\n\n22) The Masque of the Red Death (1964) (Oct 22) - 3.5 / 5\n\n23) The Devil Rides Out (1968) (Oct 23) - 2.5 / 5\n\n24) Daughters of Satan (1972) (Oct 24) - 1 / 5\n\n25) Evilspeak (1981) (Oct 25) - 2 / 5\n\n26) The Devil's Candy (2015) (Oct 26) - 3.5 / 5\n\nBonus 03) The Amityville Horror (1979) (Oct 26) (rewatch)\n\n27) Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970) (Oct 27) - 3 / 5\n\n28) Hellraiser: Judgment (2018) (Oct 28) - 1 / 5\n\n29) Hack-O-Lantern (1988) (Oct 29) - 2.5 / 5\n\nBonus 04) The Return of the Living Dead (1985) (Oct 29) (rewatch)\n\n30) Bone Tomahawk (2015) (Oct 30) - 4 / 5\n\n31) Spirits of the Dead (1968) (Oct 31) - 2 / 5\n\nBonus 05) The Haunting of Hill House (2018) (TV Season 1) - 4 / 5\n\n* (unintentional comedy score)\n\nPostmortem:\n\nNumber of New Movies Watched: 31\n\nNumber of Bonus Movies/TV Seasons: 5\n\nNumber of Aborted Viewings: 1\n\nHighlights: Alligator, Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye, Jacob's Ladder, Rabid, Starry Eyes, I Am a Hero, Seoul Station, Bone Tomahawk\n\nBest of Animal Attacks Weekdays: Alligator\n\nBest of Giallo Week: Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye\n\nBest of Body Horror Weekdays: Jacob's Ladder\n\nBest of Satanic Panic Weekdays: The Masque of the Red Death\n\nBest Overall: I Am a Hero\n\nBiggest Surprise: Alligator\n\nComplete Crap: Thirsty for Love, Sex and Murder\n\nUnwatchable Garbage: The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence)\n\nBiggest Disappointment: Shakma\n\nBest Kill: Frogs\n\nLizards creating a makeshift gas chamber.\n\nMost Messed Up Kill: Bone Tomahawk\n\nThe troglodytes preparing their meal of Deputy Nick.\n\nBest Character: Cheddar Goblin in Mandy\n\nWorst Character: Coopersmith in Evilspeak\n\nCutest Dog: Freddy in Evilspeak\n\nLeast Cute Dog: Nicodemus in Daughters of Satan\n\nMost Icky: Hack-O-Lantern (thanks to Grandpa)\n\nBest Fashion Sense: Jane Fonda in Spirits of the Dead\n\nWorst Fashion Sense: Grandpa in Hack-O-Lantern\n\nNumber of Movies That Start With \"The\" in the Title: 11\n\nMost \"What the FUCK?\": Beyond the Black Rainbow\n\nBoy, that Escalated Quickly: The Food of the Gods\n\nBoy, that Escalated Slowly: The Perfume of the Lady in Black\n\nPlease Don't Make Any More Movies: Tom Six\n\nSo I didn't get anywhere near 31 movies this month, but that's OK. I did watch a lot of horror shorts plus a couple of movies in the week or so leading up to October, not to mention a Netflix series and a half, so I guess I'll sort of half-count those.\n\nThe final list, including pre-October watches and short films, with ratings:\n\n1.

Halloween (2018) - 6/10\n\nWhich amounts to just 18 feature length films watched in the month of October, but oh well.\n\nLetterboxd list here\n\nBonus series: I watched The Haunting of Hill House and liked it a lot despite some unevenness and the fact that the ghosts are less interesting than the character drama and psychological element (except when they intersect in interesting ways, Episode 5 being a great example) - a problem it shares with Flanagan's fairly similar film Oculus. I'm currently more than halfway through The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and I'm enjoying it even more; it's just good Halloween fun.\n\nIn terms of quality, I had much better luck with the shorts this year than with the feature films.\n\nTop 5 Short Films of the Marathon:\n\nThe Ravishing of Frank N.
