Shots are often very blurry, especially during the gore scenes, which makes it difficult to tell what's being cut up.\n\nBy regular standards, this is a terrible film, as it's basically just some friends goofing around with a camera, but can be enjoyed for what it is as long as you don't expect anything more than some friends goofing around with a camera."
