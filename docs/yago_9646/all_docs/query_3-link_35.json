        "text": "last updated on 12/06/2020\n\nRamzi | Male | 20 | French | Algerian | Turkish .\n\nI started watching anime at a young age not knowing they were japanese, the like of OG HxH, Akachan to boku, Blue dragon, Captain tsubasa, Shoot, Tiger Mask, Thunder Jet and FOTNS (watched all of them in arabic dubs like most kids at the time/ i'll probablly get to rewatching some of them) But it was around Fall 2016 / Spring 2017. i was on vacation in Algeria and one of my friends kept telling me about how good they were, so i thought i'd get back to them, and so the first ones i watched were MHA and Bungou Stray Dogs. and Here we Are. even tho i started in 2016 i only started really investing my time into anime around summer 2018 when i went to college (in the span of those 2 years i only watched like 20-25 shows) ...\n\nFavorite Games: Arkham series . Yakuza 0 . FF VIII . Fifa 16 , as of lately; ToCS\n\nI mostly watch eng sub , but for text heavy anime shows like the Monogatari series i tend to choose the arabic sub since its faster to read and easier to understand [] i'm okay with eng dubs as long as they're good. [] i watch some anime series with French subs and dubs on tv\n\nwhat i enjoy: Psychological | Comedy | Sport | Love triangles/romance | long running series\n\n+ Mechas: specifically the old 80-90 OVAs (eg: bubblegum crisis, Gunbuster).. i recently started getting into them and they've been very entertaining and ,honestly, alot more interesting then the recent ones that came out ( darling in... , Deca-Dence. ect )\n\nwhat i dislike: Isekai | dull mechas\n\nI enjoy the majority of the show i finish. if i detest a show i wont force myself to finish it only to give it a low score on my list, it's an instant drop. the rating i use is abit weird but here's the jist of it: i Like All the show that got a score 3=< , but to different degrees. 7/10 means that the show is great (most of my seasonals that i really really enjoy end up here) and 8s & 9s are like my favorites of all time (again, different level of \"favorite\"). i still havent decided on what a 10/10 is for me so theres none scored such on my list. the series that nearly made me define them as what a 10/10 is were HxH and AnJ (such goated series).\n\nIm bit harsher on movies (all about expectation).\n\nI don't care about filler episodes . (except for gintama, every episode is great)\n\nIt usually take more than a single watch for a show to get a rating of 9 or higher.\n\nIn my spare time, i either consume anime/manga, skate or listen to music.\n\nI wanted to have Johan from Monster as one of my favorite characters but that kinda spoilery for those who didn't read/watch the series.\n\nIn this section, i'll just write/rant about whatever:*spoilers ahead for each series*\n\nDetective Conan:\n\nI was at ch430 where i first thought of binge reading/catching up to it. the anime was at episode 996 i think, i set myself a challenge, (i had to catch up before ep1000) In other words, i had less than 4 weeks to catch up before it reaches this millstone . This is a series that i've put on the side for a long time but now that im catching up and seeing this greatness.. im glad i finally decided to sit through it... while reading i also watched some of the anime on the side (i watched the first 300ish episodes without skipping any) some hatori and kaito kid cases and also the BO ones. The 1000s have been great. We're getting major development to the MAIN PLOT so if you're hesitant about catching up. please do so.\n\nIf you don't want to watch/read the anime/manga, Check out the Movies. They are great !!!!!\n\nOne piece:\n\nSo, let me start by saying; i didnt hear about the series until 2016/2017 when i watched one of Soolking's music videos ( fun fact: the artist im talking about got his name from the man himself BROOK the Soul king. he even uses his laugh as an intro in most of his songs)... it caught my eye so i wanted to watch it then i found out it was 800+ episodes, i said hell no! Plus at the time i wasnt that much into anime (especially long ones) then i watched this video , i started watching the series shortly after. I previously said that i usually go to Algeria on holidays (summer ones). There.. i had this one friend in my friend group that Looooooooved to spoil things, not small spoilers. he usually drops heavy and really important stuff ( for example: when i went there 2y ago -at the time he was into conan- he ,with no worries at all, dropped the name of the fucking boss of the BO knowing there were people in our group that werent that deep into the story) at the time i was at episode 40ish and i remember clear as day what episode i was on - it was that episode where the SH were going down reverse mountain and the fog appeared, i remember pausing the episode and switching straight to the manga. i read like the first 300ish chapters in B/W for thz next month or so then when we got to Water 7 i was told that the arc is better in the colored manga. \"it's 4pm\" i read the first chapter of the arc *46h later* just finished the post war arc.it took me less than 2 days to read 300ish ch. it was the best reading experience i've ever had. the Marine ford arc had one of / if not the best stretches of chapters ever (vol56-59). One piece greatness. The fishman island arc was ehh (especially for what happened to Sanji) but after that it got better and better. i remember reading WCI and having the most fun ever. Im really happy that i've never been spoiled for anything and im glad that i joined this amazing Community and reading this manga week to week (not always unfortunately) So the moral here is:\n\nDo yourself a favor and read one piece.\n\np/s: this OP summary video is great, check it out!\n\nHaikyuu\n\nShoutout to one of if not the best Sport series ever.\n\nit started really promising. after that, we got season 2 (10/10) then the Shiratorizawa match came around. it was around episode 4 or 5 where i said fuck waiting a week for the next episode; imma catch up to the manga AND TRUST ME DUDE, THAT WAS THE ONE OF/IF NOT THE BEST CATCH-UP EXPERIENCE IN A LONG TIME. i stopped right after the time skip because i had exams at the time. by this point, Haikyuu was already in my top 5. i came back to it a lot later (when chapter 398 came out, i read that it was ending soon; so i had to get back to the greatness). The last arc/part of the manga was one of the most satisfying pieces of art that i've ever read. Furudate sensei gave us such a great ending HOLY SHIT i cant wait to see this adapted in the anime.\n\nThe Monogatari Series:\n\nWatching this show was the most fun thing ever, i usually don't like text heavy anime but this was an exception. THIS is was the fisrt thing i saw from it and let me tell you that it is far more Crazier and wierder than you think.\n\n- Hanekawa Tsubasa is the best of the best waifus and there is not one girl that measures up to her, especially if we're talking Kizumonogatari Hanekawa\n\nEven tho she's my waifu , i do like them together. Here's best girl , No No Sorryy i meant !!!!!!. SHE is my second best girl and here's something about her.👀.\n\nMy ranking (always changing):\n\n-Monogatari Second Season\n\n-Owarimonogatari\n\n-Kizumonogatari\n\n-Bakemonogatari\n\n-Hanamonogatari\n\n-Nisemonogatari\n\n-Nekomonogatari Kuro\n\n-Tsukimonogatari\n\n-Koyomimonogatari\n\ni haven't watched Zoku Owari yet.\n\nYou should 10000% watch this\n\nGinTama:\n\nI only started this series because of King_recon, i was more into his one piece vids but whenever he got the chance; he'd mention his favorite Story Arc in all animanga being The Shogun assassination Arc. He spoke so highly of it for so many times that it intrigued me and actually made me wanna drop everything i was watching at the time and start this.\n\nMy rants and thoughts of GinTama (uncomplete)\n\n↓↓↓favorite ship by the way ↓↓↓\n\nHajime no Ippo (writing this right after reading chapter 978):\n\nOkay, like most people, i started this series with the anime (right after completing the goated Slam Dunk manga), i heard it was good but never paid that much attention to it.... 75 episodes watched in the span of 13 days; by the end of it, I WAS SHOOK. the show was great.. animation!! the OST!!!! the OPs & EDs (just listen to the 1st Ed and see for yourself) but what hooked me to the show was the story and the fights. So i continued... the Sanada v Ippo movie was great. the Mashiba v Kimura fight was fantastic (i really like Kimura's character in the show and i was glad he pulled off the W in this match, Season 2 hit another level of hype for me.. from the Ippo match to the Miyata greatness and Finally we got the Takamura Hawk fight (top 3 fight in all HnI).. from his first appearance to the match, the buildup was fantastic i loved it. Rising was really good, Aoki's match And Ippo's defences were quite enjoyable and the way they ended the season with after the war arc, it was great.... oc the manga, it's too long so im only going to mention some of my favorite moments from it: Mashiba v Sawamura wa incredible .. i remember every time Ippo had a defense fight it was hype ( especially the 3 consecutive defenses) and even when he got real mad before the match against Hisato \"THIS WON'T TAKE LONG\") and OC seeing Takamora destroying his opps was always fun... AOKIMURA matchs were very fun at the beginning (broccoli man) but them losing every time got redundant ,it's been so long since we last got a good Kimura fight but i know it's coming (especially after what happened in the Class A tournament). the Itagaki being a genius stuff was kinda ehh at the beginning but it grew on me, i started liking his speed matchs more and more (i hope he clashes with the lightning God at some point). if One piece is what you consider a slow burner, the romance in this manga is even slower... lmao. Edit: okay i reached a certain point in the manga where it get better\n\nch1082: Mashiba's ring walk has to be one of my favorites in the entire series (Undertaker style).\n\nch1202: what the actual fuck did i just read. My heart sanked\n\nch1269: just reached this double spread,I read somewhere that Morikawa sensei made a statement that the story has reached its half point.... OMG the comeback is gonna be outta this world.\n\nI finally caught up to the series at chapter 1335.. now i get to follow the Ippo greatness weekly.. LFGOOO\n\nch1338: im pretty sure this ongoing Takamura Match is going to be the greatest match in all HNI. Mark my words.\n\nch1392 maaaaaan i love this. i really like where the story is heading. this whole quartet of athlete coming together elevated my enjoyment of the series by 100x. and btw Yes the Takamura fight ended up being up there\n\nOverall, Great sport series, i highly recommend it even if you don't know anything about boxing ( don't let its number of chapters scares you, that just mean that you have so much awesomesauce to consume)\n\nJoJo's Bizzare Adventure\n\nRankings:\n\nParts:7>6>5=4>3>2>>1:\n\nPart 6 has been my favorite JoJo part for the longest time: the setting, the characters, the mystery aspect. i really loved it all of it, one of the few JoJo's that it didnt bore me at the start. it hooked me right from the beginning .. and then i read Part7. SBR was incredible. the story of it was fantastic and what made even more great was the characters. it had the best JoJo, Best JoBro, best JoFoe & best JoFoe' Stand. Also, i love how Araki spends so much time with the side characters and their ambitions from the chapter 1 before they become important later on. Steve Steel, Dio, Pico loco, Hot Pants, Sandman, mountain Tim. we get to see their side and everyone one of them have lots of moments to shine... i genuinely felt connected to all these characters. phenomenal writing.\n\ni don't understand how someone can switch from Shonen to Seinen ( weekly to monthly) mid serialization and make the transition feel so natural.\n\nThis will stay in my Top five for a long time.\n\nReasons (\"bad\", \"good\") why some parts are where they are on my ranking:\n\nPhantom Blood: too short, Sorry jonathan :(\n\nBattle Tendency: the villains weren't that interesting, Joseph carried\n\nStardust Crusaders: a little bit too long, DIO ZAAA WARUDO\n\nDiamond is Unbreakable: i dropped it at the start / i didnt enjoy the SoL aspect of it + i didnt like Josuke , the second half of the series is one of my favorite stretchs of episodes/chapters in all jojo\n\nVento Aureo: the ending was a little bit unsatisfying , the JoBros & JoJo's stand are among my favorite in all jojo (and also how can i forget about Diavolo)\n\nStone Ocean: nitpick: it needed to be planned out better (the overall structure of the part) , Jolyne Greatness delivered to us by Araki and his godly Art style (and also the setting)\n\nSBR: the complaint (it could also be seen as a good aspect of the part): D4C is way too complicated, Everything about it is Great\n\nJoJos: 2=7>3=6>5>4>1\n\nJoBros: i cant decide/ i'll update this once i catch up to part 8\n\nJoFoes: 7=4>5=3>6>2\n\nSetting:7>5>6>3>4>2>1\n\nBeginnings: 7=5>2=6>3>1>4\n\nEndings: 4=6=7>3=5>2>1\n\nJoJos stands: 7>3=5>6>4\n\nJoFoe stands: \"not yet\"\n\nArtstyle: 7>6=3>4=5>2>1\n\nChihayafuru\n\ni'll write and update my thoughts about this series later but for now, I just wanted to say:\n\ni finally reached chapters 204, 205, 206 and damn, this was one of the most legendary stretch of chapters i've ever read. im tearning up :'). Chihayagoat !!\n\nSpace brohers\n\nDamn i wish i had thought of documenting my journey catching up to this masterpiece. I just read chapter 376 and ithat single panel (with all the setup up until now) was just wow wow wow i can't find the word to express how much joy this manga has brought to me.\n\nthe panel in question:\n\nVAs i adore:\n\nHiroshi Kamiya (神谷 浩史)\n\nMaaan this mans voice is sooo smooth wtf, whenever he does internal monologues with whichever character he's playing ( Araragi , natsume being the most momerable) the scene suddenly peak. i'll try to watch more shows where he's playing the MC cause till this point i only watched like 8-10. ( haven't seen the GUNDAMs so i'm excited to see his performance there too)\n\nMiyuki Sawashiro (沢城 みゆき)\n\nThis Seiyu was the voice of soo many iconic characters in animanga! Kurapika, Nanba Mutta, Fujiko Mine and Ginko from Mushishi. She even VAed the G.o.a.t herserlf Suruga Kanbaru from the monogatari series. Im just Amazed by how wide the range of her voice acting is.\n\nAkira Kamiya (神谷 明)\n\nGAOT\n\n1st Anime: Boku no Hero Academia :]\n\n50th Anime: GTO\n\n100th Anime: Space Dandy\n\n150th Anime: Kakegurui\n\n200th Anime: VINLAND SAGA\n\n250th Anime: Grand Blue\n\n300th Anime: Soukihei MD Geist\n\n350th Anime: Clannad: Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, Tomoyo-hen\n\n400th Anime: Video Girl Ai\n\n450th Anime: H2\n\n500th Anime: Senya Ichiya Monogatari\n\nCurrently (re)playing: Trails in the Sky and more like ly going through the fate series\n\nCurrently (re)reading: *nothin*"
