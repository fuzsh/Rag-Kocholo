        "text": "“Dying’s easy. It’s over in a second. This hurts worse…”\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast is keeping it sleazy with the original 1978 cult classic THE TOOLBOX MURDERS!\n\nA series of brutal killings are committed at a small Californian apartment complex, all of them carried out by way of implements found in an average toolbox. The killer appears to be targeting young, attractive women in their twenties, but things take a turn when Laurie Ballard (Pamelyn Ferdin), a 15-year-old high school student, is abducted by the masked assailant.\n\nThe intensely graphic nail gun scene, as well as Stephen King’s fandom for the film, has not only helped the low-budget endeavor acquire cult status, but has kept horror fans interested nearly 45 years later.\n\n“Suck it, bitch.”\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast continues Sleazy ‘70s month with Meir Zarchi’s original 1978 cult classic I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, a film so notorious that it not only spawned its own subgenre, but inspired dozens of copycats over the past 40+ years.\n\nJennifer Hills, a New York City native, rents a cabin in the remote wilderness of Kent, Connecticut. There, she plans to spend the summer months crafting her first novel. Almost immediately, she is accosted by four ne’er-do-wells, who decide they’re going to spend the afternoon brutalizing her for their own sadistic pleasure.\n\nBut Jennifer is no shrinking violet.\n\nAfter recovering from multiple assaults, she retaliates with some of the most iconic revenge sequences ever put to celluloid. A simple, but effective plot that continues to stand the test of time.\n\nThis week, The Blind Rage Podcast takes a look at SHALLOW GRAVE, a straight-to-video quickie that, up until a few years back, was available exclusively on a long out-of-print VHS. Vinegar Syndrome has since found the original 35mm negative and gave this rarity the Blu-ray star treatment. But was it worth the effort? Ehh…\n\nSHALLOW GRAVE is the story of four friends known for causing trouble at their private Catholic girls school. After a prank, which leads them in hot water with their head mistress, they set off to spend their spring break vacation in Fort Lauderdale. They, of course, have a breakdown, which leaves them stranded on a desolate road. One cliché leads to another and they end up witnessing a backwoods murder. Unfortunately for them, the killer happens to be the small town’s sheriff. Once he realizes they know his secret, they come to find just how far he’s willing to go to cover his tracks.\n\n“I’m so horny I could fuck a cow.”\n\nThings are going from strange to downright bizarre on this week’s episode of The Blind Rage Podcast, as we take a look at Jackie Kong’s 1987 horror-comedy BLOOD DINER!\n\nAs children, brothers Michael and George witness the brutal death of their doting Uncle Anwar. 20 years later, they’re running a popular Hollywood diner, which serves exclusively vegetarian cuisine.\n\nOr so their clientele believes.\n\nUsing one of Anwar’s many absurd rituals, Michael and George are able to resurrect their favorite uncle, only now, he’s a talking brain in a jar. With eyeballs. Following Anwar’s instructions to the letter, the brothers begin butchering and dismembering the city’s most immoral women, using their body parts to bring to life the ancient Egyptian goddess Shetar.\n\nFollowing the blood trail, some local detectives are on the case. Unfortunately for Hollywood’s dwindling population, these guys are closer to Inspector Gadget than they are Hercule Poirot.\n\n“Want a date? Going out? Lookin’ for some action?”\n\nOn this week’s titillating episode of The Blind Rage Podcast, it’s Frank Henenlotter’s terrifying tale of sluts and bolts, the one and only FRANKENHOOKER!\n\nAfter a freak mishap with an out-of-control lawnmower, Jeffrey Franken’s (James Lorinz) fiancée (Patty Mullen) is eaten by the maniacally spinning blades. Only a few pieces of her remain: an arm, a foot, and, of course, her head. Unable to accept the loss, Jeffrey concocts an elaborate plan to resurrect her, using the dismembered limbs of New York City streetwalkers to fill in the blanks.\n\nOh, and did I mention there’s supercrack?\n\nFRANKENHOOKER is a hilarious and wildly entertaining dark comedy that remains a cult favorite, even close to 35 years later. I’m very happy to finally feature it on the podcast.\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast is ringing in the second week of July with Jim Hoskings’ absurdist horror-comedy THE GREASY STRANGLER, one of the most insane films we’ve covered so far.\n\nMeet Big Braden, a middle-aged incel, who shares a filthy, mold-coated dwelling with his eccentric father Big Ronny. Together, they conduct disco walking tours, telling fabricated tales of the biggest acts of the ‘70s.\n\nIt is on one such tour that Braden crosses paths with Janet. An explosive—and extraordinarily awkward—love affair immediately ensues. Creating a rift in the lovers’ newfound bliss is the jealous and overbearing Big Ronny, not to mention a naked, grease-coated psychopath stalking the streets under the cover of night. Dubbed The Greasy Strangler, the menace attacks at random, collecting a host of mutilated bodies during his multiple wraths.\n\nThings take an nasty turn when Braden begins to suspect Big Ronny could quite possibly be The Greasy Strangler…\n\n“Can you contract an STD by having sex with a dead person?”\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast kicks off this month with Richard Bates, Jr.’s EXCISION, a film destined to be a cult classic.\n\nMeet Pauline (AnnaLynne McCord), a high school outcast who aspires to one day become a surgeon. While most who plan for a career in medicine spend their days studying the human body, Pauline believes her understanding of the subject is far superior than anything found in necessary textbooks. She instead fills her days engaged in pseudo psychological counseling with a local priest (John Waters), isolating herself from her classmates by acting out in a plethora of reprehensible antics, and praying to a God she isn’t sure exists.\n\nWith strong performances by McCord, as well as Traci Lords, who plays Pauline’s overbearing mother, EXCISION is a breath of fresh air, especially in times like these, when most filmmaking is more copy and paste than innovation or originality.\n\nAgain, The Blind Rage Podcast says good-bye to one of horror’s most iconic voices, as Stephen King Month 2.0 comes to an end.\n\nWith this fond farewell, we’ll be discussing A GOOD MARRIAGE, a seemingly overlooked adaptation of a novella, which appeared in the 2010 collection FULL DARK, NO STARS. Heavily inspired by the BTK case, Joan Allen stars as Darcy, an ordinary suburban housewife, who discovers that her husband of 25 years is a sadistic killer, preying on women long before their paths even crossed.\n\nWith his ability to read her better than anyone, Bob (Anthony LaPaglia) immediately knows she’s stumbled upon his secret. However, rather than killing her to keep that secret safe, Bob tells her that she can go to the authorities if she so desires, he’ll do nothing to stand in her way. But this revelation will not only ruin her life, as no one will believe Darcy hadn’t known of his crimes, but it will also ruin the lives of their adult children, whose perception of their kind and loving father will be forever shattered.\n\nThat was a far too long and clunky sentence, but then again, I’m no Stephen King. Clearly.\n\nSummer’s only a few days away and The Blind Rage Podcast is celebrating the hottest time of year with another Stephen King adaptation!\n\nIn 1985’s CAT’S EYE, we’re introduced to an adorable little tabby, who journeys from place to place in search of something unknown. Between ventures, he finds himself in the midst of some rather unusual circumstances.\n\nFirst, we have a father (James Woods) who decides to quit smoking via an agency whose methods are highly unorthodox. Next, we’re in Atlantic City, where a wealthy gambler discovers his wife is having an affair with a young tennis pro and decides to solve matters by placing a bet with her new love interest. Lastly, we’re in the suburbs of a small town, where a little girl (Drew Barrymore) claims she’s being menaced by an evil troll who lives in her bedroom wall. The only one who can stop him is our sweet tabby, who she quickly adopts and names General, as she’s certain he’ll be her protector.\n\nStephen King Month 2.0 continues on The Blind Rage Podcast! For week two, we’re taking a look at the 1990 anthology TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE: THE MOVIE, a spinoff of the 1980s television series, featuring a stacked cast of well-knowns, including: Christian Slater, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, William Hickey, and legendary rock star Debbie Harry.\n\nA young Matthew Lawrence stars as Timmy, a neighborhood kid who’s been abducted by a suburban housewife (Harry), who just happens to be a witch.\n\nAnd a cannibal with a taste for children.\n\nThe only way Timmy can prevent her from cooking and eating him is by reading her stories from a massive tome, which holds dozens of twisted yarns. Will Timmy keep his captor distracted long enough to devise a plan to escape?\n\nSURPRISE!!!\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast is back with more Stephen King goodness! That’s right, Ragers (which is a name I’ve been meaning to dub the podcast’s most dedicated listeners the past few years, but as it should come as no surprise, I forgot). June is Stephen King Month 2.0!\n\nKicking things off is CREEPSHOW 2, the 1987 sequel to the immortal cult classic! Though it may only contain three segments and play just under 90 minutes, this installment runs the gamut, with such jaw-dropping elements as: murderous statues, ravenous sea creatures, undead hitch-hikers, gigantic Venus flytraps, and so much more! So buckle in, Ragers. It’s time to boogie!\n\nSadly, we’ve reached the end of Stephen King Month here on The Blind Rage Podcast. However, we’re going out with an absolute banger: George Romero’s 1982 cult classic anthology CREEPSHOW!\n\nThis is a movie that has it all: furry monsters in crates, bloodthirsty sea creatures, the reanimated corpse of an abusive father, hundreds of thousands of roaches, and a stacked cast of amazing actors. We have Ted Danson, Leslie Nielson, Ed Harris, Adrienne Barbeau, Carrie Nye, Tom Atkins, E.G. Marshall, and Stephen King himself!\n\nI can’t say enough about how fun and campy this one is. It’s a horror classic that only gets better with repeated viewings. So, grab a few cans of Raid, an industrial-strength weed whacker, and your cherished mail-order voodoo doll. The show is about to begin!\n\nStephen King Month continues on The Blind Rage Podcast!\n\nFor week three, we’re taking a look at the 2002 made-for-TV adaptation of CARRIE, starring Angela Bettis (MAY) in the title role. I’m struggling to come up with something to say about the original story that hasn’t already been said a thousand times. Unless you were born in the past decade or so, you know the classic tale of a teenage outcast who exacts bloody vengeance on her tormentors on the night of the senior prom.\n\nNo one could hope to match Sissy Spacek’s masterful performance in the original 1976 film, but I always thought Angela did a great job at making the role her own. She is aided by a wonderful supporting cast who help make this modern retelling worthwhile. Unfortunately, it’s one of those movies that’s overlooked far more than it’s appreciated.\n\nBut who knows? Maybe after this episode, fans of the original film, as well as the King novel, will give it a chance.\n\n“She can’t be dead. MISERY CHASTAIN CANNOT BE DEAD.”\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast rings in the second week of Stephen King month with an absolute banger: Kathy Bates and James Caan in Rob Reiner’s stellar adaptation of MISERY!\n\nAfter a horrific car wreck, romance novelist Paul Sheldon (Caan) wakes to find that instead of being in a hospital, he’s in the home of Annie Wilkes (Bates), a dedicated reader who can’t wait until he’s fully conscious to inform him that she’s his #1 fan.\n\nIt doesn’t take long for Paul to realize he’s in imminent danger, as after Annie finishes the latest installment in the best-selling series, she finds that Paul has killed off her beloved character. The only way he can right this wrong is to draft a new manuscript, one in which Misery Chastain is resurrected.\n\nAnd if Paul doesn’t want to write the book, well… Let’s just say Annie has ways of persuading him.\n\nIt’s Stephen King month on The Blind Rage Podcast!!!\n\nThat’s right, Ragers. Wall-to-wall novel adaptations by one of horror’s most celebrated and recognized titans. We begin with the original 1989PET SEMATARY, a movie that was nightmare fuel for at least 3 generations. And how could it not be? It features the brutal demise of a toddler, a zombified cat, the severing of an Achilles tendon, a split-open skull… And so much more.\n\nCome join us as we dive into this horror classic and remember: sometimes…dead is better.\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast wraps FINAL DESTINATION month with the fifth entry in the lucrative franchise.\n\nThis time around, we’re introduced to a group of co-workers who narrowly escape death after an accident causes a horrific bridge collapse. Unfortunately, it’s more of the same, with the exception of one very minor component: sacrificing the life of someone else to save your own.\n\nThe best part of the film is probably the return of Tony Todd, though he he’s given less to do than usual.\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast enters the third week of FINAL DESTINATION month with…well, FINAL DESTINATION 3.\n\nFor this go-round (see what I did there?) we’re introduced to a group of high school seniors celebrating graduation at an amusement park. A little low-rent, if you ask me. Especially when compared to the group of kids in the original film, whose plans were to celebrate their high school graduation in Paris.\n\nAfter boarding a roller coaster, Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) receives a premonition that the ride is going to crash, killing everyone in its fiery wake. Thanks to her intervention, a handful of her classmates depart, only for the rest to die in a horrific accident.\n\nDeath makes its third appearance, complete with ominous wind-gusts and constantly pooling water, ready to claim those who should’ve died in the crash.\n\nWill Wendy and the handful of survivors live to see freshman orientation?\n\nHere on The Blind Rage Podcast, FRIDAY THE 13TH month comes to an end. Join us as we wrap things up with 2003’s FREDDY Vs. JASON, a movie fans of both franchises had been clamoring for. Sadly, what we received wasn’t at all worth the wait.\n\nFREDDY Vs. JASON is a mishmash of plot holes, weak performances, bad dialogue, and some of the worst one-liners from everyone’s favorite charred villain. There are better quips and retorts in FREDDY’S DEAD. Hell, there were better quips on FREDDY’S NIGHTMARES, for God’s sake.\n\nThough the movie is deeply flawed, to say the least, its biggest sins were filling the shoes of Jason with someone other than Kane Hodder, and having one of Freddy’s victims call him what is probably the most offensive of all gay slurs moments before coming face-to-face with her grisly demise. Eesh.\n\nIt’s week three of FRIDAY THE 13TH month on The Blind Rage Podcast and I’m sorry to present…JASON GOES TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY.\n\nAs a fan himself, Adam Marcus clearly tried to create a sequel Jason fanatics would love. Sadly, this one falls short. In a number of areas. We get a heaping helping of convoluted backstory no one really asked for. Some bizarre body-jumping. The incorporation of THE EVIL DEAD’s Necronomicon. Homoerotic shaving. And about 13 minutes of an on-screen Jason Voorhees.\n\nOn a rare positive note, we get one of the best (and nastiest) kills in the entire franchise. But is that enough to make JASON GOES TO HELL worthwhile?\n\n“You didn’t get me in the lake…and you’re not gonna get me now.”\n\nIt’s the second week of March and FRIDAY THE 13TH month continues on The Blind Rage Podcast!\n\nJASON TAKES MANHATTAN isn’t exactly the most appropriate subtitle for the 8th installment of the franchise. But, as has been explained many times, the production wasn’t given a large enough budget for director Rob Hedden to accomplish even a fraction of what’d been intended. Instead, what we get is an hour of stalk-and-slash aboard a yacht the size of Biosphere, lots of Vancouver alleys and street corners, and only a few glimpses of The Big Apple. On top of this, we’re given a plot that makes very little sense, especially when it comes to the ultimate demise of our beloved villain.\n\nFRIDAY THE 13TH, PART VIII is far from a perfect film, but it’s still head and shoulders above JASON X, a movie so bad it hurts my soul.\n\n“You’re cute, Paul. But you’re not that fuckin’ cute.”\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast takes a look at Jamie Blanks’ URBAN LEGEND, one of the few post-SCREAM slashers still widely remembered. And, like SCREAM, cast actors from popular teen dramas (Jared Leto of MY SO-CALLED LIFE; Joshua Jackson of DAWSON’S CREEK) to help create the ensemble.\n\nThe most memorable performances, however, are by horror icons Robert Englund, Brad Dourif, and Danielle Harris.\n\nWhile far from perfect, it’s easy to see why URBAN LEGEND has maintained a dedicated cult following, as opposed to being quickly forgotten, as so many horror films of this era have. Join us as we take a trip back to the late ‘90s. A time before iPhones, Wi-Fi, and smart watches.\n\nFor this week’s episode of The Blind Rage Podcast, we’re focused on a film some would call…uh…an acquired taste, I imagine. When it comes to the avenues of the extreme, 29 NEEDLES runs the gamut, exploring taboo subjects such as sounding, self-harm, bloody ejaculations, sadomasochism, and just a smidge of torture. Definitely not for everyone, which is why Grindhouse released it under their “Too Extreme for Mainstream” line.\n\nBut is it any good…?\n\nJoin us as we take a journey through basement dungeons, fetish clubs, and the deepest, darkest corners of the human mind.\n\nThis week on The Blind Rage Podcast, we’re returning to The Land Down Under for Greg McLean’s cult classic WOLF CREEK!\n\nBrutal and oftentimes extreme, McLean’s celluloid nightmare holds up quite well. With its simple premise involving three backpackers who are accosted by a maniac in the middle of nowhere, it’s a raw terror that could—and does—happen to anyone.\n\nThe thought of being lost in the Australian Outback is horrifying enough, but to be lost with a psychopath like Mick Taylor hot on your trail… Well, that’s an experience I can do without. Unfortunately, for these friends, they’ll learn how it feels to be hunted, as well as the true meaning of “a head on a stick.”\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast ends the frigid month of January with a couple of firsts.\n\nThe focus of this week’s episode is 1997’s PERFECT BLUE, a Japanese anime feature which tells the story of a former pop idol who becomes a stalker’s prey while struggling to make the transition from singer to serious actress.\n\nAlso, this is the first time Tony fell asleep during a recording, which he vehemently denies. I cannot say for certain whether he chose my recent views monologue to nod off, but it’s pretty clear he lets out a yawn. I was going to edit that portion of the episode out, but I think Tony should be publicly shamed for being the sleepy little koala that he is.\n\nOn this week’s episode of The Blind Rage Podcast, Tony and I focus on a prime (see what I did there?) example of contemporary horror: Mimi Cave’s FRESH, a very dark comedy that explores the perils of modern dating.\n\nShot in Vancouver, British Colombia during the height of the pandemic, FRESH tells the story of Noah, a modern girl looking for love in all the wrong places. When she meets Steve in the supermarket, she’s reminded that it is possible to make connections without the aid of technology. But just like all the others, Noah quickly finds that her new beau is harboring a dark secret.\n\nExactly how dark this secret is, Noah never could’ve foreseen…\n\nMaria Ford (MIND GAMES) returns to The Blind Rage Podcast in Dan Golden’s 1995 erotic thriller STRIPTEASER.\n\nIt’s closing time at Zipper’s Clown Palace, a seedy Hollywood strip joint, when a blind man enters. In minutes, he drops the cane, sunglasses, and charade, now brandishing a shotgun, which he uses to hold the remaining employees, as well as its last patrons, hostage. What appears to be a random act of violence slowly becomes more sinister as we discover our gunman has something of an infatuation with Christina (Ford), one of Zipper’s most popular performers.\n\nChock full of violence, nudity, lap dances, and sleaze, STRIPTEASER remains one of my favorite Roger Corman straight-to-video quickies. Pull up a chair (not that one; there appears to be a sticky residue along the seat) and join Tony and I for this lost gem.\n\nBack in November of last year, Tony and I recorded a commentary for THE HITCHER (1986). Having done SINGLE WHITE FEMALE (1992) the week before, I spoke of the third Jennifer Jason Leigh movie that would make her a Blind Rage All-Star. Well, at the time, I’d forgotten James and I recorded a commentary for EYES OF A STRANGER (1981), one of Jennifer’s earliest films, a few years back.\n\nSo, making her fourth appearance on The Blind Rage Podcast is Jennifer Jason Leigh in the quite underwhelming erotic thriller HEART OF MIDNIGHT (1988). Actually, we were planning on featuring BURIED ALIVE (1990) this week, another thriller starring Mizz Leigh, but as is sometimes the case, I realized I didn’t have access to it. Forced to scramble for content, I came up with…this…mess of a film.\n\nJoin us as we try our best to make a good commentary out of a terrible movie.\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR!!!\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast is kicking off 2024 with a bang! Several, in fact.\n\nTony and I return to the land of the dirty, dirty for the third installment in the TABOO franchise. It truly amazes me how many downloads the commentaries for the first two films have gotten. Hell, the original has gotten well over 100,000 plays on YouTube and I’ve long since retired from updating the channel.\n\nI guess people really…REALLY love incest. So, grab a raincoat and come join us for TABOO III.\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE BLIND RAGE PODCAST!!!\n\nThis year, Tony and I are spending the most joyous of holidays abroad, as we head on over to Jolly Ol’ England for DON’T OPEN TILL CHRISTMAS.\n\nThis campy mess of a film concerns a deranged killer stalking the streets of London in search of department store Santa Clauses, who he quickly dispatches of in grisly fashion. Very little character development and a story that leaves much to be desired, I wouldn’t call this one a Christmas horror classic, but Tony and I enjoyed having a few chuckles at its expense.\n\nWishing everyone a wonderful holiday season. See you in 2024!\n\n“I’D RATHER YOU GO BALD TO SCHOOL THAN LOOKING LIKE A TRAMP!”\n\nMr. Tony the Tiger a.k.a. Daddie Dearest, it seems, was determined to ruin this week’s episode of The Blind Rage Podcast. First, he smacked me upside the head with a hairbrush—TWICE. Then, he tried to force gallons of Pepsi down my throat. And as if all that wasn’t bad enough, he received a delivery from Bear Daddy Bungalow in the middle of the commentary!\n\nAs if you couldn’t tell, we’re focused on Frank Perry’s MOMMIE DEAREST, considered by many critics to be one of the worst movies ever made, and by gay audiences to be one of the most compulsively watchable, not to mention endlessly quotable, gems of the previous century.\n\nJoin us as we watch Faye Dunaway swallow the scenery whole, co-stars and all, in this enduring cult classic!\n\n“If you think that’s bad, wait’ll you get my bill.”\n\nThis week on The Blind Rage Podcast, we take a look at one of horror’s underdogs.\n\nWhile Manny Coto’s DR. GIGGLES has accumulated a small, but dedicated cult following since its 1992 release, it never really got the love I always believed it truly deserved. Larry Drake gives one of the most memorable performances of his career, his portrayal of a killer Santa in the TALES FROM THE CRYPT episode “And All Through the House” coming in at a close second.\n\nWhile many are repelled by its wall-to-wall quips and one-liners, I think it adds to the fun of the experience. At the end of the day, that’s what DR. GIGGLES is: a popcorn movie. It’s not CITIZEN KANE.\n\nIf you’ve yet to experience this ‘90s classic, simply go in expecting a good time and a lot of laughs. I can almost guarantee you won’t be disappointed.\n\n“Pick a pet for the rugrat, bitch!”\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast is kicking off December with an early Christmas present for its most dedicated listeners! No, no. This isn’t something reserved purely for those who give us a few bucks a month. It’s for one and all. Isn’t that what Christmas is about? And by that I mean torso-shredding, neck-stabbing, and tongue-forking.\n\nThis special two-part episode begins with 1994’s WES CRAVEN’S NEW NIGHTMARE, then bleeds (literally) into the 2023 fan film DYLAN’S NEW NIGHTMARE, both of which can be found side-by-side in The Blind Rage Podcast’s ever-growing catalogue of fan commentaries!\n\n“You just tell ‘em how the cows eat the cabbage and you’ll be just fine.”\n\nI don’t understand why HIGH TENSION continues to get so much flack. If ever there was a horror movie that made zero sense, it’s this pile of…whatever this is.\n\nThis week on The Blind Rage Podcast, it’s TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE NEXT GENERATION a.k.a. THE RETURN OF THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, notorious for casting then unknowns Renée Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey\n\nDespite heaps of completely incoherent dialogue, this installment begins similarly to other films in the franchise. We’re introduced to our ensemble of main characters (this time, it’s a group of high school kids on prom night). Of course, they have a wreck and find themselves stranded in the middle of Texan woodland. During their seemingly endless quest for help, they come face-to-face with various members of a new inbred family, which, interestingly enough, don’t appear to be cannibals.\n\nAs the film progresses, the subplot concerning members of an underground society similar to the illuminati, whose objective is to capture random people and terrify them to the point of reaching a spiritual and transcendent experience., is introduced I suppose writer/director Kim Henkel ceased to realize that such a concept could traumatize someone to the point of sheer madness, i.e. Sally at the end of the original.\n\nIt wouldn’t surprise me if Henkel cranked the script out during an acid trip, because I doubt anyone other than he could possibly understand his true intentions. That doesn’t mean Tony and I aren’t going to give it a try. Join us as we fight to make sense of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW BIZARRO WORLD.\n\n“There’s roadkill all over Texas.”\n\nIt’s Thanksgiving week! Here on The Blind Rage Podcast, we’re showing our appreciation with severed limbs, crushed skulls, and a side of greens.\n\nLEATHERFACE: THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE III, in my opinion, marked the end of the franchise. Sure, there were additional sequels and some remakes, but they never felt tonally attached to the first three films. As a matter of fact, some of them were just plain godawful. And I was never wild about the idea of going back to produce sequels and prequels to the original franchise when a reboot already began. It just makes matters too damn confusing.\n\nAnd one of my biggest pet peeves has always been sequels without numbers in the title. How the hell is the audience supposed to know if it’s the 8th installment in the FINGER SOUP franchise if it’s called anything other than FINGER SOUP 8??\n\nWhile I step down off my soapbox, make some room for me at the table. And remember, the saw is family!!!\n\nIt’s almost impossible to believe, but there was once a time in America when hitch-hiking was considered safe. My grandfather would regularly pick up strangers walking along the side of the road (with kids in the car, mind you) and drop them off wherever they needed to go. More often than not, the hitch-hiker was just a poor down-on-his-luck schmuck who needed a ride to work. He’d be dropped off at his destination and likely never thought of again.\n\nUnfortunately for Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell), an 18-year-old kid driving cross-country, picking up a hitch-hiker will become one of the worst mistakes of his young life. Within minutes of climbing into the passenger seat, John Ryder (Rutger Hauer) begins behaving strangely. It isn’t long before a switchblade is drawn and a game of cat and mouse that stretches across four states begins.\n\nCo-starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, THE HITCHER is a tense thriller that grabs the viewer by the throat before the conclusion of the opening titles. Join Tony and I as we venture down this dark, rain-slick road, on our way to certain doom.\n\nGobble, gobble!\n\nThe Blind Rage Podcast kicks off the month of November with one of the most iconic thrillers of the ‘90s: SINGLE WHITE FEMALE.\n\nWithout movies like this, Lifetime would essentially have no content, as the premise has been duplicated and replicated many, many times. Few female villains have been able to match the rage and intensity of Hedra Carlson (Jennifer Jason Leigh), or the doe-eyed naiveté of Alison Jones (Bridget Fonda). Even after three decades, the many themes included in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE remain relevant, so much so that contemporary audiences should have no trouble identifying with one or more of its central characters.\n\nAfter the film hit theaters, I’m sure many thought twice before seeking roommates to help share the cost of rent and half utilities.\n\nVideo Nasties Month concludes not with a Video Nasty, but with a movie about Video Nasties. Specifically, about a woman, whose job it is to censor Video Nasties. That’s either absurdly confusing, or insanely meta.\n\nI consider Prano Bailey-Bond’s 2021 CENSOR to be a breath of fresh air in a decade which has been pretty disappointing for horror devotees. I’ve found very few current releases to be at all worthwhile, especially those which have been celebrated by fans and critics. Call me a contrarian, but movies like X, THE MENU, THE STYLIST, and BEAU IS AFRAID really didn’t do it for me. As a matter of fact, my faith in the genre has been on a steady decline. It’s movies like CENSOR, with strong performances by actors like Niamh Algar, that remind me there’s still good stuff out there. You just have to look for it.\n\nI’m very proud to end the month of October with this one. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.\n\nVideo Nasties Month just got nastier… And sleazier… And bloodier…\n\nThis week on The Blind Rage Podcast, Tony and I sit down to watch Romano Scavolini’s 1981 splatterfest NIGHTMARE a.k.a. NIGHTMARES IN A DAMAGED BRAIN. Steeped in controversy, this slice of acquired taste is remembered by many horror fans due to its excessive gore, censorship, and false accusations of Tom Savini being part of the crew.\n\nAside from that, there isn’t much going on here. The storyline is quite thin. A maniac escapes from an institution and goes on a killing spree, which leads him to Florida, where a woman who may or not be his ex-wife, and children who may or may not be his offspring, currently reside. I consider this to be in the same box as A SERBIAN FILM. Something for those who fancy themselves hardcore genre fans to see simply to satisfy their own morbid curiosity.\n\n“Darlings, you have made your mother very proud.”\n\nVideo Nasties Month continues on The Blind Rage Podcast!\n\nThis week, Tony and I take a look at Charles Kauffman’s 1980 cult classic MOTHER’S DAY, a favorite among Troma and slasher fans alike. The premise couldn’t be simpler: a trio of female friends camping in the woods of New Jersey are accosted by a pair of inbred brothers, led by their deranged and domineering mother.\n\nHowever, the campers aren’t about to fall victim to any vicious or sadomasochistic acts. Much to the surprise of this backwoods family, these women are fully prepared to fight back.\n\nVideo Nasties Month continues on The Blind Rage Podcast!\n\nFor week 2, Tony and I explore 1981’s THE BURNING, a camp slasher featuring some of the most infamous on-screen slaughters in horror history, as well as some of Tom Savini’s best and grisliest effects. I don’t think anyone ever has, or ever could, walk away from this movie without the notorious raft sequence ingrained in their memory. So, pack your bags and join us. We’re headed off to camp, where a hedge clipper-wielding maniac is lurking in the shadows…\n\n“I warned you not to go out tonight…”\n\nIt’s October!!! To help celebrate the Season of the Witch, it’s Video Nasties Month on The Blind Rage Podcast! First up is…uh…a movie that, well, isn’t technically a Video Nasty, but it was banned in the UK for many years and sold under video shop counters in brown paper bags. It was so notorious, in fact, that it wasn’t even given a proper, uncut release until last year, when the British boutique label 88 Films put it out on Blu-ray.\n\nFor a movie deemed so sleazy, misogynistic, and irredeemable, it’s since become absurdly easy to access. As a matter of fact, I’m pretty sure I caught it on Lifetime a few weeks back. Then again, it could’ve been one of those Vivica Fox Christmas movies... ***shudder***\n\n“You know the best advice I ever got? If you’re up there on stage, hopin’ on a spot, if someone gets in your way, step on ‘em. If you’re the only one left standin’ there, they hire you.”\n\nIt’s The SHOWGIRLS Shindig this week on The Blind Rage Podcast!\n\nBefore Tony and I dive into Paul Verhoeven’s 1995 enduring cult classic, we examine YOU DON’T NOMI, the documentary which coincided with the 25th anniversary of the film. I can honestly say, as a longtime fan of SHOWGIRLS, this episode was a blast to record. Hope you have just as much fun taking this journey with us."
