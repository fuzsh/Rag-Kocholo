Looks like the answer is not to book, at least this year. Many people felt that BYOFL had outlived its usefulness and was being abused. Many others felt it was still quite helpful for bands and labels. But since no- body actually came forward and said they wanted responsibility for typing in all the listings, proofing them and organizing them for eventual layout, plus doing the mailorder on it, we declined as well. We'll see next year if a re sponsible bunch of people or ex- isting organization is ready to come forward and whether there's a strong enough grassroots call for another edition. If you're so inclined, send us a letter staing what your resouces are (in terms of computers and typing person- nel) and why you'd like to share the job with us in 1999. WANNA SEND US SOMETHING?! scene Reports: PUNK'S NOT DEAD! It's happen ing out there and MRR readers want to hear about it! Hi! My name is Jenn and I input and edit the scene reports that come in. MRR relies on you scenesters out there to keep the pulse of what’s happening in your town, write up something fun and interesting about it, and send it in to MRR. Photos and artwork are mandatory. Tell us about local bands, zines, and cool and uncool venues, include info for travel- ling punks (non-US scene reports are especially welcome!) such as where to find cheap veggie eats, record stores, and strong coffee. Has your punk scene spawned any communally-run en- terprises such as show spaces, cafes or record stores! Are racist or homophobic thugs threat- ening your scene's harmony? Enquiring punk minds want to know! See details below for format info. interviews: Boy, is MRR ever looking to im- prove the quality of our interviews (which shouldn’t be hard!) We'd like to get a staff of reliable people across the country and around the world who could turn in some good, prob- ing interviews on a semi-regular basis. We're looking for people who already have some experience doing interviews (perhaps you have your own zine and would like to share some of your best stuff with a wider audience), who can challenge bands (I know, I know, most bands don’t have squat to say, but a good interviewer can take them where they haven't been be- fore!) or give some long overdue support for those behind-the-scenes types who do an aw- ful lot of the hard work in punk rock but get little of the ego or monetary rewards. Please give us a call if you are interested in covering new hardcore, punk or garage bands. Formatsfor submitting stuff? we preferthings typed up on a 3 1 /2\" computer disk, either Mac (preferred) or IBM. Please don’t type in ALL CAPS! if you can't access a computer, then typed up cleanly on paper should work, as long as it’s in a fairly common and straightforward font. Graphic stuff? Send photos (B&W pre- ferred, but color OK too), logos, etc. Thanks Records/zines? See detailed information listed on the mastheads of the Record Review and Zine Review sections. BACK ISSUE SALE: For every three you purchase, you get a fourth one free!! Please list alternates in case we're out of a particular issue. Price list is on previous page.

They educated a lot of people about voting land capitalism, among other things. They gave I I us a new sound of punk music and a fresh idea | |on life almost like Crass, but less abrasive. Now this band is educating a slew of I teens in jeeps on the importance of dance beats land catchy phrases of unimportance. They are | also the official band of “Home Alone 3”, a I horrible movie sequel to the other shallow mov- 1 lies before it. How a “punk band” could do a giant turn I | like this, eludes me. They actually said “we want | to get our message out and a major label can I | help with better distribution.” More like they! | could help with Chumba’s cash flowl So... intel- ligent punks: thy enemy is named| Ichumbawumba! Seek out and destroy major label punk 1 | impostors! ...And bands, please don’t sell out! f | Home Alone movies suck! Write to: | Joey Unfun/ 231 'S. Prospect St. # F/ Burlington, |VT 05401 L Dear MRR In all of my years being involved with the punk/underground music scene I have constantly been aware of the vast support of freedom | of speech and first amendment acknowledged | rights; observing our individual rights to decide | our own spiritual beliefs, to be able to express | ourselves verbally or literally as we see fit, and to I have a governirlg body that is not tied or directly I linked to any ecclesiastical organization or reli- Igious institution. As many have seen over the years of our I short lives, these promises of constitutional au- Itonomy are mere holograms of liberty, as politi- Ical dictators and religiously fueled special inter- lest groups headed by fascists like Tipper Gore, I have more or less decided for us what we should lor shouldn’t be permitted access to. Whether I this has been access to things like “booty rap,” I the allegedly suicide inspiring Judas Priest and lOzzy Osborne albums, “gansta” rap, \"danger- lous books such as Paladin Press’s “Hitman,” or ■any of the myriad of other underground publica- tions that have had tabs kept on them by federal ■ agencies, it has still been acknowledged by ■those in the punk rock community that this type lot prohibition is wrong. Not necessarily because I we believe in singing about how many girls we 1 “fuck” or how many “suckas we capped ‘cus they ■was stepping’ to us,” but because we recognize ■that if someone wants to express themselves ■that way, then they should, as autonomous 1 human beings, be permitted to do so with no ■ interference or legislation from the governing | bodies. To this degree I must applaud the under- ground scene all and give everyone the prover- Ibial “pat on the back.” Believe it or not we have I been quite successful at keeping their idea ban- lning at bay (while not yet actually being able to I stop them altogether). However, infringement Ion personal autonomy does not end with prohib- iting or limiting what we can say. It also is ■ encompassed by limiting or prohibiting what we I may own or what we may do. Now obviously this I does not include just running around town raping I and killing people , because by the very nature of I these actions you are stripping the freedoms and I liberties away from those whom you are commit- I ting actions against. No, what I am speaking of is far more sinister, and has, for reasons unknown, not been opposed to any extent by members of the punk rock community. This bit of insidious legisla- tion is commonly referred to as “gun control,” ironically enough is supported and condoned by the vast majority of so called “anti-authoritarians.” The reason for this evades me. If banning or legislating the ownership of firearms actually could make this a more just and peaceful world [then perhaps 1 could see the logic behind it. However, gun control legislation such as the Na- tion Fi rearms Act, the Gun Control Act of 1 968 and the so called “Crime Bill” (or “Brady” Bill) of 1994 have no impact whatsoever on federal or local “law” enforcement agencies. In fact while these acts have caused “civilians” to be prohibited from the ownership of select fire (full automatic) fire- arms, ammunition magazines with capacities over ten rounds, flash suppressors, threaded barrels, collapsible and folding stocks, barrel length of rifles under 1 6 inches, bayonet lugs and the like, the “law” enforcement community has been granted less and less restricted access to these things. Perhaps you are unaware of this but since the 1 930’s we lowly civilians have been barred of the right to own a small piece of metal with a spring that would enable our semiautomatic rifles to fire fully automatically, while at the same time there are now more than 400 local police forces who are equipped with military surplus, full-auto M-1 6s. We are not talking about S.W.A.T. teams and all of their fancy toys. These are the beat cops rolling around in their cruisers with assault rifles in their trunks. At this time there are more than 1 ,000 other police forces trying to get approval for similar firearms (which they probably will get within the next year). Perhaps gun control doesn’t frighten you. Perhaps you ignorantly view gun owners as back- woods dipshits out looking for “grub” (which some undoubtedly are). However, in regards to all gun owners, you couldn’t be further from the truth. I’m not going to give you a history lesson but you must realize that the first thing every modern dictator- ship has done before instituting their reign of terror was gradually and completely restrict the civilian populace from owning and possessing firearms (i.e. Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany). Why? Be- cause weapons are multipliers of strength. The corporate government has nothing to fear from several thousand unarmed revolutionaries who could be easily squashed by the state and their superior armament. However knowing that the masses possess these multipliers of strength and will not give in when the government tells them that they can no longer be trusted with the responsibil- ity of owning a piece of metal with a trigger, a hamrrler, a bunch of springs and pins in it, could definitely keep autonomy in the hands of the masses for a little bit longer. If the state did decide to instill 1 00% totali- tarian dictatorship (which they are well on their way) then how would they go about doing so? How could they possibly bully a well organized mass of people who simply want to live free autonomous lives, who were armed to the teeth? The answer is they couldn’t. Police are slaves to the corporate interest but they don’t want to die just to take guns away from people who aren’t bothering anyone in the first place. Take, for example, a situation that I and two close friends of mine were confronted with a month or two ago. We were moving back from the west coast to Ohio when our van (filled with all of our firearms) overheated in the middle of the night on an Indiana interstate. We decided to let it cool down and take a look at the engine in a minute. Not long after, we saw lights flashing behind us. Sure (enough, it’s officer John Lawman, coming to see what is going on. Quickly we unloaded the guns that we were carrying and removed them from our holsters. The driver of our van went to tell the officer that there was no problem, we just needed N , to let the sonofabitch cool down and we would be on our way. Well, this wasn’t quite acceptable to 1 Officer Lawman. He decided that he needed to check our identification and the driver needed to be patted down and wait in the cruiser. Upon the officers “Terry Frisk” he discovered a full hand- l gun magazine and a concealed carry holster still | attached to my friend’s belt. Time to call for back up. . . Six cops were there now. My girlfriend was flipping out inside the van. I told her to be I cool and everything would work out. As far as the cops knew, all of our guns were being carried legally. We had several rifles, a shotgun and a few thousand rounds of ammunition in the van, in addition to several handguns. Well, long story short, we knew the cops had probable cause to search the van so we consented to a search to get all of this bullshit over with (not that I am recommending this, you should normally never consent to any search). The officers couldn’t believe all of the weapons that we had. Aside from that, they were aston- ished by the other survival gear that we had, bullet proof vests, gasmasks, night vision, sev- eral dozen loaded magazines. ‘Why do you have all of this? Are you in some sorta militia?” they asked. “No, we have this because this is what I we are into. Because we want to and because we can,” we replied. We continued to “chat” with the obviously nervous and intimidated officers. We never spoke down to them and we never “got j smart” with them. We just spoke as if this were a routine aspect of travel, like paying a toll and we would soon be on our way. Well, they ran a check on all of the guns...”1 080\" the dispatch said, they all came up legal. So the cops let us go, but it was obvious that they were intimidated. Why were they intimidated? Because we had power over them. We had the capacity to end their lives if they decided to oppress us. Because if they decided to shoot us we had the capacity to protect our bodies from their bullets. Because they once again were given the role as I our servants rather than us assuming the role as their subjects who they “keep in line.” I am not even beginning to suggest that owning firearms will solve all of the world’s prob- lems but it is obvious that the governments of the world do not want their subjects to have posses- sion of things that will make the government subject to their approval. They want the guns, they want the magazine capacity, they want the select fire capability, they want the power. And if we continue, as I did for so many years, to believe that supporting their totalitarian organizations goals, like those of “Sarah Brady’s Handgun Control”, the United Nations (who have publicly stated that it is their goal to disarm the civilian populous of the world by the year 2000), the Parliament of the U.K., Canada and Australia (who have in recent years invoked an outright ban on civilian ownership of firearms while simul- taneously beefing up the armament of the “au- thorities,”) then we shall be to blame on the next “Krystal Nacht.” Please think about what I have said and feel free to write or argue with me if you disagree, or correspond if you agree. We have a lot of work To do if we are to ever achieve a free and just world and now is the time to start. I do hope that you realize that this has not been a letter about guns, it has been a letter about autonomy and what will work best to insure our freedom and I limit the power of the corporate governing bodies in the future. Thanks. Abel/ PO Box 18092/ Forest Park, OH 45218 Hello, After reading the letter sub- 1 mittedby Doug H. in #175, 1 thought I should provide an alternate view- 1 point. First, however I will kindly attack Doug’s views of what is “punk”. To me there are no “rules and regulations” of punk. The whole beauty I have found in the punk world is that you can have your own beliefs, ideas, opinions, standards, etc. and not feel pressured to fit into any mold just because you listen to a certain kind of music. I treasure this freedom and I think that Doug should be less concerned about what is “punk” and more concerned with what he believes. Tying into that is his statement about giving people equal chances. I think most will agree that equal chances also means equal choices. Maybe you think abortion is wrong, well so do I. The difference is that I think everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and choices and just be- cause I don’t believe abortion is the choice (for me), I also don’t believe that my opinion gives me any right to deny someone else of their own free choice. I don’t think it’s right but others may and they are just as much entitled to their choice and opinion as I am. I know that there are thousands of arguments for both sides but what it comes down to is we have 'the right to choose and I am not for any regulation that would take away another one of our dwindling rights. And about your friend, Doug, in all moral meaning, I would also urge her to keep the baby, except you mentioned that she uses heroin so the baby probably already has a very slim chance at living. It’s not a pretty world, we can’t always do what is morally correct. Everything human is conditional. Amy Bucciferro/ 5958 Curry Rd/ Schenectady, NY 12303 © Dear MRR, In regards to Doug : Hargrave’s pro-life letter in issue #175, as well as Jeff’s pro-choice response, I’d first like to thank the both of them for refraining from attacks on those whose abortion views differ from their own. Aside from Doug’s dismissive naivete sur- rounding parenting (“So what if it can be hard or discomforting...?”), and his seeming hyperbole in equating the logic of pro-choice with the ratio- nalizing of racism and homophobia, the discus- sion remained largely civil, if understandably emotional. (Note my tacit agreement that we “drop the fuckin’ bomb on everyone” - just kid- ding.) My personal say on abortion is the voice of ambiguity... an ambiguity with a passion! Yeah! If to be ambiguous means to be “difficult to classify” (Oxford Dictionary of Current English, Second Edition), then color me ambiguous. Al- though pro-choice friends consider me pro- choice, my stance that the individual woman be free to choose springs most from my faith in both anarchism and in the Christian suggestion that people “judge not.” I personally have difficulty accepting the argument, in regards to abortion, that one ought to be allowed to do as one wishes with her own body, as I regard the fetus as a totally other person altogether— and one whose dependence on the mother is significantly differ- ent only in degree to that which any other person has upon others. However, being a man, I can hardly fathom the concept of anything (other than a parasite or a virus) living inside me. I do support the woman’s right to choose, and I can empathize with various serious and meaningful reasons for choices made; and I also believe that I do not have the right to judge, as I cannot know enough about another’s heart. Doug, I would imagine abortion to be an pi extremely difficult decision for the greater number of women; I do not believe they take the decision to abort lightly. I think you probably feel the same. Aside from that, I believe adopting off a child to be a difficult thing for most mothers to do after having taken the responsibility and care to bring the fetus to term. Giving the child up after having brought him or her into the world seems probably more difficult to at least some women than aborting the fetus, especially a fetus in the early stages of development. I’m sure the self-imposed abortions and even outright infanticides hesitantly performed by black slave women in America during the last century (to spare those children the misery of slavery) were also difficult. (“Women, Race & Class”, by Angela Y. Davis; pup 204-205.) Also, Doug, condom breakage, which your friend says resulted in her pregnancy, would presumably oc- cur much less often with further and improved safer-sex education, especially education regard- ing condom care and use. I do have difficulty accepting abortion, par- ticularly in the later stages of pregnancy. My daugh- ter, Sheehan, now nine years old, was born at 52 months into gestation — during the second trimes- ter. And I see little reason, if any, to have consid- ered her a person only upon leaving the womb and not while within simply by virtue of her having lost the physical ties to her mother. (I also wonder whether we’re to regard the newborn as a nonper- son until the severing of the umbilical cord? Does the fetus become a person when the cord is cut? Or rather at conception? Or when?) Anyway, I believe the best approach for those of either in the abortion debate is one to- wards commonality. This was the deliberate deci- sion of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1 973, in an effort to achieve a strong and united front and minimalize societal conflict. Scientific evidence regarding personhood was inconclusive, leaving the Court necessarily legally indecisive regarding personhood, and the Court constructed a compro- mise based around that. The individual woman was legally awarded greater consideration to choose as she wished during the first trimester, the state’s interest greater consideration during the third, and a yet hazier consideration muddled the middle. Regardless of its being imperfect, com- monality is important, and necessary, in coming to an adequate conclusion to this fiasco which ex- tends back much further than twenty-four years. Commonality as well as practicality; we need objective solutions, not unproductive divisiveness. I am currently researching an organization which seems to be responding well to that call: Search For Common Ground in Washington, DC. Abortion is one domestic issue the organization tackles, among several issues worldwide. Ex- amples of ways to deal with the issue include the promoting of better pre-natal care, easier adopting (i.e., the recent New Jersey decision allowing non- married couples, including gay couples, to adopt children), reducing teen pregnancy through op- portunities and education, and the rejection of violence. Pro-lifers as well as pro-choicers work through Common Ground’s Network for Life and Choice. Search For Common Ground can be reached by phone at 202-265-4300 and by mail at 1601 Connecticut, NW; Suite 200; Washington, DC 20009. Anyway, I think I’ve covered enough shit for now. Everybody take care of yourselves. Randy Underdog/ PO Box 63458/ St Louis, MO 63163 Randy, SFCG’s work sounds good, but overall I would argue that health care/reproductive choice for all women is more important than avoiding “ divisiveness ” (i.e. pissed-off pro-lifers). Finding “ common ground ” with people opposed to repro- ductive choice is like telling women to “go back” to the days when the state/system (men) had more I say over their lives than it does today. “ Practical - I iff frequently means “is the money there?\", so I access to abortion for poor/rural women today is I not “pracitical.” You’re right on about the impor- I tance of safer-sex education. Thanks forwntinq. | JeffM. Mykel Board, re: “a nice exercise in the logic of fallacy.” - MRR #172. re: “Less Talk, More Rock” My friend brought it to my place cos she liked your piece on it. I just wanted to I let you know your analogy is flawed. Murder is I illegal, abortion is not. Regardless of whether or I not you approve of it. That’s what “Against abor- 1 tion? Don’t have one” has meant to me: “Against I abortion? Well fuck you it’s still legal!” The same I cannot be said for murder. The pro-choice phrase I you detest is closer to “Against homosexuality? I Then you don’t have to have a same-sex lover!” I than “Against murder? Don’t kill people!” If abor- I tion is ever outlawed, we probably would not hear I the popular phrase you mentioned. Anyway I’m I glad you’re pro-abortion. Like I’ve awlays said: I more abortions, less pregnancies! I Anna J PO Box 1040/ La Mesa, CA 91944-1040 MRR, Ever wonder why there is so much violence in the scene? It’s just another part of this fucking society we have not rejected. Education in America does not teach us to be tolerant of each other. Instead it taught us to be self-righteous cowards bent on destroying ourselves if we were different. Think about it: straight edge vs. punks, punks vs. rude boys, skins vs. skins. It’s fucking sick, self-destructing from within. For all you fucks who can’t accept personal differences, become a redneck, jock, or prep, cause you still have the good ol’ “American educational values” in your head. T o quote a line from a 4-Skins song ’’Nobody’s fighting the system, they’re fighting each other.” It’s about time we gave up personal vendettas and unite. Unity is the only way we can stand against the lying, corporate, religious groups running this fucked up government. I can’t stand against oppression if nobody stands by my side. I’ll stand by any good-natured, honest, open- minded, working class people. No, I’m not Jimmy Hoffa. United we stand, divided we fall, isn’t that what the American people are supposed to be about. How about no taxation without represen- tation ? Who the fuck’s representing the working class today? Again I say we need to unite. Most of you reading this are paying unrepresented taxes, one way or another. Every single working class person needs to unite in a national mass general strike. Who’d do the work for the rich dckers who own this nation? The economy would fall and then they’d pay us some attention. Weird Paul ® Dear Eric, . You may have miscon- strued the term “flak” as used by professors Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky in their 1989 book “Manufacturing Consent,” when you wrote your recent column in MRR #176. Rather than “discipline” as you suggest, I believe flak (as used by Herman and Chomsky) is about distrac- tion. Tpe marginal consequences of the news are made major issues through exaggerated hyperbole so as to distract us from any indepen- dent analysis. Thus, the most pressing issues are ignored in favor of mere flak or distraction. All the best, Mike Hogan/ Amsterdam Chronicle f Kanaaistraat 66 huis/ 1 054 XK Amsterdam/ Holland Dear] MRR, I n -I verting | the mast- head is a good I subversive idea. By putting the shitworkers at the top (where they be- long), and the coordinators at the bottom (where 1 “management” always belongs) you’ve subverted I the typical magazine masthead where the editor I is always at the top, and the hack writers are at | I the bottom. I was wondering though: why not elimi- Inate the structure altogether, and just list the I I names in alphabetical order? Or if that’s even I too orderly for some , then just jumble the names 1 up, listing them in random order. Let’s see a I more anarchic format! Thanks for listening! |Fr@nc Isible. P.S.

Tim O Maximum Rocknroll, I would like to know what I kind of zine you really are! You call yourself a punk zine that refuses major labels! Correct? Well you don’t accept cassettes from I bands. You only accept vinyl or CDs, why? I play ■ guitar in the Peds and we are definitely a punk ■ band. We can’t afford vinyl or CDs. All we can I afford is our cheap recorder and cassettes we ■duplicate ourselves. It sounds like to me you are a zine for rich I kids who can record a CD but don’t know shit | I about true punk music. Punk used to be bands that played simple I ■tunes because they only knew one chord moved ■around on their guitar. And played crap clubs in I front of 2 people and the bartenders.

Hey MRR, This is Henrike, I sing for a Brazilian I punk rock band called Blind Pigs. Well, 1 I’m writing about a recent gig we were I invited to play at. When we got to the gig we found 1 out the asshole (we’ll call him Mr. Asshole) who I was “sponsoring” the gig (his music store’s name I and logo was on the flyer. He was supposed to pay ■ for the flyers and the rent of the space) made an I opening band pay 50 dollars for the rent and also I pay for the flyers. We thought about not playing, I but a lot of kids had gone there to see us, so we I decided to just piss Mr. Asshole off. You see, Mr. 1 Asshole is a total Jesus freak, so we wrote “Satan 1 Is Love” on the backs of our t-shirts. But it seems I that we pissed off a lot of \"punk” and “hardcore” I kids who were there too. When some of these I “punk rockers” saw our t-shirts, they took out the I crucifixes they had around their necks and fuckin’ 1 kissed them! Shit, an opening band even played a I MxPx cover! During our set, we started giving out a stickers to whoever went up on stage and screamed I shit into the microphone like: “Fuck the Pope up I the ass,” “I love Satan,” and other anti-Christian (slogans. A lot of kids who consider themselves (“punk rockers” were offended ‘cause we were | talking shit about the motherfuckin’ Pope! Can you (fuckin’ believe this? I mean, what the fuck are (these kids doing in a punk rock show anyway? 1 They should be at home praying or listening to the | new MxPx CD. The whole point here is, what is (wrong with kids these days? They’re all con- formed, they got their parent’s values and they 1 listen to “punk rock” bands that have jack shit to | say. Anyway, after this show people started saying | we were urging kids to worship Satan. Fuck, get a 1 sense of humor, or better yet, get a fuckin’ brain. | “All religions make me sick.” (Henrike/ Caixa Postal 245/ Barveri-SP/ 06453- 970/ Brazil ® Dear readers, Okay, this is somewhat ad- dressed to The Positive Hardcore Alliance, it is really to anyone who will read it.

Jeff M. 1 MRR, I am writing in response to I the comments to Felix Havoc in is- 1 sue #176. Before reading these let- ters, I had not read his columns, but] (because the letters interested me, I went back| | and read what he had to say. In reference to the 1st letter and how| I political bands are “no fucking fun— who wants to | (be preached to,” and “knowpng] what [one’s]! (political beliefs are + ...not needing to be... re- 1 | minded,” I have two comments: 1 . 1 do somewhat | I agree that some bands take it too far, where they ( (are too demanding on the listener, and at times] (derogatory. But on the other hand, how many] (bands really take it this far? Do all political] (oriented bands deserve to be stereotyped as| (such? And what’s wrong with introducing ideas | (that someone may of previously been ignorant] (to? I’m sure that the writer of that letter may be [ (“confident” with his beliefs, but one must recog- 1 ] nize that: 1 . A lot of people are not, and could use | (the direction; 2. Just cause one holds certain] (beliefs, doesn’t mean that there’s still not room| (for further enlightenment; and 3. The writer of I | that letter’s beliefs probably were formed in some | I part by ideas promoted by some type of political | (band. The same letter also went on to say how | | the writer didn’t want to learn about political! (history or philosophy, that they’re “fucking silly”] ( and have “nothing to do with everyday life”. This | (is the comment that really took me back. They] (have everything to do with everyday life. First off, | ■&! without knowledge of the philosophy behind politics, how do we ever expect to understand it? And without knowledge of the genealogy of events, how can we ever expect to influ ence the change of I the future? It’s this very knowledge that allows ■those in power to remain in power, they know I what happened in the past, and even more ■ important, why. With this knowledge, they are I empowered to in some ways plan out and predict Ithe future course of this society, and without it I we, not as punks, but as humans, will just remain I their puppets. It has everything to do with every- ■ day life. Finally, in regards to the writer’s com- Iment on enjoying MRR being less political than I in the past, and that if people want more they can Igo elsewhere, I have two reactive thoughts: 1. I Although people can go elsewhere, MRR is in ■ some ways the “establishment’ that Havoc pro- ■claims it to be, and as such has much more I influence than other zines. Because of this influ- ence, I feel that MRR should continue to use it to ■ promote ideas and critical thinking, and utilize I the power they have to help better people, and in I turn, our society; 2. MRR is a much more widely I read zine, and can reach the ears of people who ■have not heard these ideas before, whereas the ■mentioned zines are primarily read by people Iwho already identify themselves with the pre- sented ideologies. Thus, MRR is a great intro- ductory vehicle to promote radical thoughts. My last note is on the second letter. I do I agree with the writer on two of his main points: 1 . ■ Havoc may be living too much in the past, but I then again , in some way or another who doesn’t. I Some more than others, but we do learn from our ■ past. Just some food for thought; 2. “Punk rock I is all about creating something new... about I living in the present. About reality.” Agreed. But ■with recognizing this, we must also recognize I that we don’t create something new without I thinking. Just listening to the music is not enough, ■ that alone will never “[create] anything new.” ■That’s what makes this scene special, is that it’s I not just about the music, which is why it saddens I me to hear the writers closing comments, about [the future and how “the real punks will be listen |ing to new music.” I hope that’s not all that “the | real punks” (whatever that means) will be doing. | Doing the best I can, | Danny Twelve, Cool Guy Records/ 10140 Gard Ave./ Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670 | Oh god damn, I just finished reading let- ' ters to the editor in #1 75 and these [arrogant comments from most of these bicycle | people make me want to puke\\ They think since [bicycles are “enviro-friendly” they are the great- jest thing since reservoir tip condoms.

Sure, it may have had some ! money behind it but probably not enough, consid- ering the support and money for a major label punk band was probably three-fourths less than they I receive now; which is more than enough since I haven’t heard of any stories or truths about Green Day or Bad Religion raising awareness for animal rights or anti-racist benefits. When Steve slags people for overcompensating it makes him look like a pretentious asshole and a fucking sell-out to | his past ideals. There is enough of that post- nineties anti-awareness trend in people’s con- sciousness, because it’s a lot more convenient to I live an apathetic life for morons who can’t accept change and turn themselves into one because it’s | j trendy. Racism and sexism are not dead issues, if ! anything, they are becoming more prevalent due to mainstreaming that never gives its viewpoint. Punk was against sexuality because sex had become a sick marketing tool used to exploit men j and (even worse) women. As far as I see it nothing has changed. If you dare, look at models, look at the videos, people don’t want to respect the other sex. When Steve talks about sexual liberation I personally think he’s an idiot because the media is j using sex to exploit men and women even worse than before. Dick is another word for asshole! Lovingly, Joey (Smith) First I Joey, Being aganst sexuality because it’s used I as a “sick marketing tool ” is like throwing out the [ baby with the bathwater. How about spending less time in front of the television, corporate media, garage records (oops), etc. and more time explor- ing some d.i.y. sexuality. Jeff M. 1 ,MRR, In MRR # 176 you printed a \\ letter from Steve Kingett in south west I England, and it’s letters like that that will harm the UK punk & hardcore scene.

I But I would just like to add for those who didn’t I read it that a lot of it was misquoted and edited I down making us sound like we said things that we I actually didn’t and our email address isn’t actually I ours but that for a record company we did a bit for, [to contact us it is better to write to the below [address and the email (originally wrong) is fl i&VO’ttars aiSis iyfrec@aol.com. Thanx for your time, Greg. Yellowskin/Pigman Records/ c/o Greg C. Pearson/ 35 The Leys/ Clevedon/ North Somerset/ BS21 71 Q/ England P.S. Any one wanting a copy of the new | Pigman distro list should write now also! MRR, Though l have great reser- vations about writing a letter in defense of Joe Queer, who I con- sider a leader of this new wimpy po- seur-punk movement, I feel I must. In Tim Yohannon’s column in MRR #176, I feel you were totally ridiculous, irresponsible, and off- base in turning Joe Queer’s comments into a big cacial stink. You were angered by Joe’s statement that “George T abb is a rich Jewish guy,” and said that he must be a “fucking bigot at heart” for writing a statement like that . You neglected to mention that George T abb (another leader in the bubble gum/softcore punk movement) constantly refers to himself as a Jew. He talks highly of “jew- core,” holds “Jewish Christmas shows,” and con- stantly paints himself up to be the stereotypical “cheap jew”. George Tabb’s image revolves around being a “Jew”. From this, do you assume that George is a hateful bigot against himself or I has an inferiority complex? No, of course not. r You merely use the race card in any instance | possible to discredit someone. You go on to call Joe Queer racist, sexist, I and ageist and say, “Whatsamatter, didn’t want to go for the homophobia, too?” He’s in the friggin’ Queers, for shit’s sake. How much more homosexual can you get than being in a band called the Queers? Joe Queer should be criti- cized for being a rock star, a corporate suck-up, and for playing sugar-coated watered down punk rock, not for being a “racist.” I recently sent the latest copy of my ‘zine Raw Sewage to MRR for review It is a parody on the state of race, sex, and homo issues. Though MRR has been fair to me in the past with music and print reviews, I’m curious to see if this will be ridiculously cast out as “hateful, racist material.” I’m glad that MRR chooses not to promote or support racist events, issues, and causes. That would suck if you did. But as a fan of MRR for many years now I ask, won’t you, fuckin’ loosen up just a bit? My band was once banned from ABC NO RIO as racist for making fun of Richard Simmons!?! Please don’t be phony race witch hunters like them. Thanks, Rahne Pistor c/o Raw Sewage ‘zine/ PO Box] 221/ Delaware, NJ 07833 Dear Rahne, I feel Tim was right-on in his statements in the last MRR. If you read the whole interview with Joe Queer, you could see that he was speaking with malice. Period. Malice can easily become racism, where humor, is, well, humor. If Joe had a problem with the Lookout fiasco, and wanted to slam me, there were better ways. Calling me a rich Jew just perpetuates a bullshit stereotype. Now, Rahne, when you write I am “ an- other leader in the bubblegum/softcore punk movement \\ that really pisses me off. Everyone knows Furious George is a Disco Band. Punk? Ya gotta be kidding.

It doesn't matter what you call things. It matters how they work, or don't. 5. Maximal freedom and knowledge. These are my particular biases. They are what is im- portant to me. If you're interested in something else, fine. Read another column. But my basic values are those. If something makes you smart- er and freer (but not at the expense of someone ; else), it's good. If it makes you dumber or less I free, then it's bad. I Strip me of my political power. Take away my I right to vote. These will not limit my freedom as long I as you don't deny me the right to spend my money as I I like. William F. Buckley Ok buckaroos. This is the economics is- sue. As thrilling as the dribble passing through I my urethra as I realize I did not, in fact, shake off the last drops. ] Economics: a pseudoscience that looks at a country filled with starving people and calls it a \"success\" because something called a \"gross national product\" -is bigger than it used to be. I Gross! I I don't want to write about world eco- I nomics. I'm sure someone else will tell you I about the evils of the World Bank and the Inter- I national Monetary Fund. Even the Pope has I criticized banks for living off the flesh they I impoverish. The Pope! Jezus Fuckin' Christ, | who's next? : Of course those are big problems, but readers here already know about them. I'm not I going to preach to the converted. That's The I Pope's job. Instead, I'm going to tell you how to spend your money. More than that, how to make it, xe I to ceep it and use it in the best way. First, we've got o decide what \"best\" is. Here are my criteria. ■allons of _ . _ jpilled g ink on hundreds of trees worth of columns 1. Minimal work. I've s I II lis. uii nuiiui tuj uv-w - talking about the evils of work. I'm sure I'll do it again, but not here. Right now, take it as a given. The less work you do, the better. By work I mean \"having a job.\" I mean slavery that requires you to be at a certain place at \"a certain time in I exchange for money. 2. Minimal destruction. An occupation is \"productive,\" if it makes one thing out of anoth- er. Any productive occupation is destructive. \\ To \"make\" something, you need to take I something natural and change it to an unnatural I state. You have to use energy in that change. You I have to destroy materials (burning coal, wood, I oil or polluting water with radioactivity) to make I the energy. You also have to destroy something I to get the resources in the first place. The more I resources used, the more destruction that takes I place. 3. Maximal fun. This mean that what you do should be fun. If you do it \"to be good,\" or * \"out of sacrifice\" it won't last. ■ Bob Black said, \"Any revolutionary who I is to be counted upon can only be in it for himself. Unselfish people can always, switch I loyaltv from one projection to another.\" I ' just look at the folks who've switched I from Commie to Nazi, Radical to Republican. I They embrace their new philosophy with the 1 same fervor thev embraced the old one. It's easy . They're not fighting for something that affects them. The urge to \"do good\" can find its outlet in the nastiest of causes. 4. Minimal jargon. If I hear \"capitalism,\" \"socialism\" or \"libertarianism\" once more, I'm | gonna shit. People get so wrapped up in labeh OK, now we've got the ground rules. Let's look at the game. 1 . Think about the situation , notthename. How many times have you heard people argue something is good or bad because of a name? \"Yuck, that's PC.\" \"How could you? That's capitalistic.\" \"Only a feminist would say that?\" \"You sound like a Republican?\" It's easy to dismiss another point of view without considering it. Just paste on a label and dump it in the trash. It's convenient for boring conversation, but it won't help you live your life. Start a business. Work for yourself. So what if it's capitalism. If you treat people well (customers, the competition, people who work with you), then you ve gained freedom. Don't worry about the name. If you get rich off it without doing any damage, CONGRATULA- TIONS. It can be done. Fat Mike is doing it right now. So are a lot of others. There is nothing wrong with making money, as long as you do it morally, with con- sideration. It's even better, though, to live with- out it, or with a minimal amount. How? 2. Banks are your friends. Banks want to give you money. They count on the traditional American fear of \"having a debt hanging over your head\" to get you to pay them back. They freely give out credit cards to build up your debt, TTien they count on your guilt to pay it back. [It's probably illegal to suggest you inten- tionally cheat the banks. I'd be the second-to- last person in the world to advocate something illegal. If anything I say here is illegal, then I don't advocate it and it's for information pur- poses only. Right?] It's easy to get a credit card. If you're a student, the banks are crying for you to gradu- ate owing even more money. Call up American Express, the easiest to get because you have to pay $55 for it. You also have to pay off their charges all at once. Once you get an Amex, though, it'll be a breeze to get the others. I get offers every day. Not only that, most credit cards give spe- cial rates if you \"transfer balances.\" What this to the food chain. You join it like any other animal. You kill a single being, like a lion down- ing a gazelle. What about growing your own food? Even if you want to spend the time and effort doing this (not fun), you still are environ- mentally destructive. You must use land. You have to pull weeds or clear forests. You destroy more nature than any food you eat. Kil"
