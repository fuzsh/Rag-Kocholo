        "text": "Joe Gill and Ian McGill hoped to secure investment for their board game About Time when they appeared on the BBC2 programme in December 2007, but came away empty handed when the dragons told them 'we're out'.\n\nBut the Brighton duo did not give up and have secured a high profile deal for their board game, which they devised with their friend Matt Gould, 37, and designer Michele(CORR) Rosaus, 41.\n\nAbout Time, a game of luck and skill based around guessing years, will be developed into special editions, using content and headlines from national newspapers.\n\nMr McGill, 43, from Fiveways, has also secured a deal in New York with Barnes and Noble, the biggest book and games retailer in the states. Who will exclusively distribute the game throughout the USA over Christmas this year.\n\nCo-inventor Mr Gill, from Hanover said: \"It's surreal. Every day seems to bring something new but now we're jumping up and down with excitement.\n\n\"Last year was scary but we sold 4,000 games. This year it looks like we're going to beat that figure by the end of February.\"\n\nSpeaking of the moment the pair met the dragons â€“ James Caan, Duncan Bannatyne, Deborah Meaden, Theo Paphitis and Peter Jones, Mr Gill, 40, said: \"Dragons Den was a fantastic launch pad. An adrenaline rush day of madness and just like on TV. What you see is true except it goes on much longer.\n\n\"The dragons are aggressive but serious about finding out about your offer.\"\n\nAfter being stocked and sold in Harrods, Borders, John Lewis and other national retailers, the game has sold out.\n\nMr Gill said: \"We survived a very difficult winter and sold out in all of our major retailers.\n\n\"The financial crisis is creating panic but consumers are still buying.\"\n\nThe inventors' company Circa Circa has also finalised a distribution deal in Scandinavia, which will see the game sold in Sweden, Norway and Denmark."
