        "text": "What’s important - April 2020\n\nAbove all else I was grateful for the health of my family, friends and I and that we had enough of what we needed as we did our best to adjust to this new surreal, terrifying, tragic normal during which time I tried to actively think only kind words towards myself (my negative rants didn't reflect my quiet inner strength).\n\nIt's good to help and support others, but sometimes it's harder to be good towards ourselves: I realized that if I genuinely believe in myself and continue learning how to respect myself fully, wonderful things can happen and so vowed to keep working towards my goals for 2020 despite COVID-19.\n\nI loved getting back to performing outside on my instruments and it was great to feel a sense of purpose and that I was appreciated when others were moved by my little solo concerts in Claybury Woods, Ilford. It was particularly heartening when an elderly gent sat and listened to my recorder echoing around the trees. I felt truly relieved that the world was on pause and that I could step off for a bit and enjoy the calm, joy and feeling of connection and perspective working on my allotments brings. It was a reminder that I can trust in nature wholeheartedly - just like I can trust myself. Clapping for the NHS with the neighbours was a very moving experience which gave me hope that my longing for more face-to-face interaction in life could become a reality. Finally, having written my 100th poem of the year, I appreciated how writing a poem every day is helping me to sort my head out.\n\nRising to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic - March 2020\n\nI've been so grateful for the health of my family and I throughout the peak of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThese circumstances forced me to teach my first online piano lesson over Skype. I was thrilled that I could even do it and was more relaxed in my own surroundings. It's made me sharpen my skills, too: I find trust and cooperation between teacher / student / parent, a flexible approach, an open mind, self-compassion, planning ahead, straightforward feedback, asking questions, mutual respect, curiosity, an iPad, headphones, a good Wi-Fi connection and a plan B are what I've needed to make remote learning work so far.\n\nI also loved performing meditative improvisations on guitar and my other instruments from a secluded spot in Claybury Woods, Ilford during the lockdown: my way of offering something joyful, healing and uplifting to the world, plus it helped me better cope with my struggles with OCD.\n\nMy WHY - February 2020\n\nIt was a confronting process, but I'm glad that I took the time to think / feel deeply about the why, hows and whats of my business in order to come up with the strapline, COMMUNICATION ~ CREATIVITY ~ CONNECTION: My objective is to enhance (especially face-to-face) communication, creativity and connection for the well-being of diverse communities. My completion of the eye-opening course, Develop Your Cultural Intelligence with Purdue University and FutureLearn complimented this goal well.\n\nAlso, I was proud of my piano student, Navjit, for achieving full marks for both the composition and performance elements of her GCSE Music, and I improvised some meditative pieces on thumb piano which can be heard on the ‘Listen' link on this website.\n\nJanuary 2020 - Dublin, Ireland\n\nThis blog is dedicated to the Scottish poet (and also my beloved teacher and poetic inspiration), Roddy Lumsden, who died this month. Here are some poems I wrote in his honour while I was in Dublin. They're from my new project, '2020: My Year Away From Social Media':\n\nIrish learnt from Dublin Bus tickets:\n\nSr Uí Chanaill = O’Connell Street\n\nBóthar Bhinn Éadair = Howth Road\n\nFásta = Adult\n\nBóthar Shoird = Swords Road\n\nMore delectable words and names\n\nI collected in Dublin today:\n\nGuinness whistle\n\nSantry\n\nIrish tricolour\n\nCrème Lavante Extra-Doux\n\nParfum Lavande\n\nRich and thick\n\nParis\n\n//////////////////////////////\n\nthe smooth white rectangle of\n\nwhite card that came with my\n\nspiral guide to Dublin found\n\nits way back to my feet after\n\nbeing blown down Kevin Street\n\nas I photographed lines for living\n\nfrom famous Irish writers etched\n\ninto metal railings surrounding\n\nthe new Garda Station\n\nhousing all humanity\n\n//////////////////////////////\n\nin Dublin’s Griffin Park Drumcondra\n\nI put around me the orange flower\n\nscarf from Paris that’d been protecting\n\nmy melodica I lifted to my blueing lips\n\nand played improvisations contemplating\n\nthe seasons going on without Roddy\n\nas ducks slipped down small river rapids\n\nthen black Scottie Lester sniffed my fingers\n\nPosted @ 11:20:42 on 08 February 2020 back to top\n\nDecember 2019\n\nI had an epiphany: I have something special and unique to offer the world and can choose to reject my faulty early programming of not feeling good / deserving enough. I'm also realizing that I have a right to my opinions and feelings. This isn't to say that my demons don't still hunt me down in my dreams, but I now know I can release some of them through journalling.\n\nSlowly, I moved forward with my 'Busking eBook'; a project I'd been planning for years which felt exciting and challenging. Also my website underwent a revamp and I delighted in the music and deliciousness of learning new foreign words during the completion of my third Spanish for Beginners course with FutureLearn. Experimenting with mixed media photography was fun, and I'm gaining more flexibility and stamina as a yogi.\n\nInteraction with talented and individualist members of my Poetry, Music and Art discussion group on Facebook made my days and my heart leapt at the idea of living simply and teaching creativity in a rural village far away.\n\nDolly Parton gives me goosebumps and I felt so grateful that my music is awaiting me when and if I feel ready to get back into it: Maybe my passions are no longer my passions? In the meantime, though, my student is engaging with my teaching and wanting to improve on piano, which is rewarding.\n\nI celebrated how rich in experience, love, creativity and nature I am, and really enjoyed Christmas with the family for the first time ever: No longer will I screw myself into a ball so that everyone else around me can shine.\n\nPosted @ 13:09:09 on 19 January 2020 back to top\n\n\"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\" - Buddhist Proverb - November 2019\n\nThis year has been about attending to my wellness: Tastes of pure peace, freedom and happiness (the likes of which I experienced in Spain) are there and I can believe in them, without my OCD/PTSD getting in the way.\n\nIt's been a very dark, solitary time with not a lot happening career-wise, but hopefully the life lessons I've been learning will stand me in good stead for the future.\n\nLife Coach, Lisa A. Romano's teachings about how to heal from toxic relationships have given me hope that I can reprogramme my early negative thinking, speaking and doing patterns in order to live my dreams.\n\nThank you, Lisa, Dana Morningstar, and everyone else who has kept me going with their inspiration, support, understanding, wisdom and comfort.\n\nPosted @ 13:25:30 on 31 December 2019 back to top\n\nAbsorbing Benalmádena - October 2019\n\nBenalmádena, Spain was like visiting a new planet, with lemons dropping like rubber balls from their autumnal trees; the veiny fragility of large, ribbony flowers perfectly lit from behind, and whitewashed houses gleaming against a wall of deep blue sky.\n\nI'd never felt so serene beauty-seeking in the evenings around the old town, wearing loud floral dresses with precious stone bead bracelets from the biggest Buddhist stupa in the Western world tingling cool at my wrists. It was so relaxing experimenting with original drawing techniques in deserted plazas.\n\nI tried to capture the sweet assault of scent and colour, lush greenery and the drama of the mountains in my artwork / improvisations on melodica, and in Paloma park I was able to indulge in my love of gargantuan cacti which cast zebra shadows across the parched ground.\n\nPosted @ 15:17:31 on 26 November 2019 back to top\n\nOn the cusp of new creative projects - September 2019\n\nWith my heart, I contemplated my 'life vision' as I practised my instruments. These ideas, images and sounds came up for me: Ascension; pinpricks of stars; long notes held with vibrato; rich abundance; a firm foundation; to give something starry of myself.\n\nI made some good '44th birthday' memories and asked about running music workshops at St Margaret's House in Bethnal Green (a unique charity supporting community, creativity and well-being).\n\nThe 'new' thing of studying Spanish for Beginners with The Open University and FutureLearn complimented perfectly the development of my aural skills as a musician, and I loved it.\n\nI want to write again, and coptic binding myself a copy of my debut collection of poetry, 'Vivarium', marked the dawn of this.\n\nDigital art sketches flowed out of me like a fountain so I moved in the direction of making some serious money out of my art at last.\n\nI was terrified, but the universe, my excitement, friends and the toss of a coin seemed to be telling me to go for it regarding taking a plane to Spain next month...\n\nPosted @ 12:02:24 on 28 October 2019 back to top\n\nMaking decisions from a place of love, not fear - August 2019\n\nAugust was spent cultivating peace of mind for myself:\n\nJournaling regularly brought to the surface treasures from my subconscious.\n\nI began oil-pulling for my dental and therefore overall health.\n\nEach time I found myself thinking too much (with Eckhart Tolle's help), I was able to focus on the present moment.\n\nMy mind buzzed with uplifting and inspirational musings after listening to episode upon episode of Radio 4' s Desert Island Discs.\n\nI realised that much of what I admire in and think I need from others, is already alive in me.\n\nI'm absorbing the physical and emotional nutrition I receive instead of immediately giving it away.\n\nDoing these activities have led to me feeling more creative and motivated once again:\n\nFutureLearn and ABRSM's Become A Better Music Teacher course lent a much-needed boost to my private music teaching enjoyment.\n\nI applied to teach English conversation online to foreign students with Cambly.\n\nFor the first time in years I made a dentist appointment.\n\nHaving worked so hard on breaking free from OCD/PTSD over the past three years, I now feel I want to see more of the world - especially before Brexit, so I booked myself nine days in Málaga, Spain in October.\n\nMy 30-minute free Enjoy Playing Music life coaching session with Enikó taught me that when goal-setting, it's important to start with finding what my 'life vision' is (through composing a short melody and asking myself what it's telling me), then to work backwards through 'life purpose' to 'long-term goals' and 'short-term goals'.\n\nPosted @ 07:44:10 on 08 September 2019 back to top\n\nJuly 2019\n\n\"Be concentrated and leonine\n\nin the hunt for what is your true nourishment.\n\nDon't be distracted by blandishment - noises\n\nof any sort.\" - Rumi\n\nBy changing one bad habit at a time, I'm taking control and beginning to feel like participating in life again (it all starts with the self): I've stopped reaching for poisonous comfort where food's concerned, am getting up at 6 am most days, and doing a few constructive things work-wise. My commitments to yoga, Self Journal, gardening, music and scaling down my Internet usage have been the foundation from which all of these things are being built.I've never really given myself the opportunity to rescue myself: I've been too busy surviving, proving myself to others, not wanting to let anyone down, sticking to my music no matter what, because that's what I've always done. At the moment I'm allowing myself to sit with the mess and ask myself questions.My teenage piano student, Navjit, told me her reason for continuing playing the piano is that she loves it and because she'd like to become a better pianist. This was very rewarding and heart-warming to hear.\n\nPosted @ 08:41:36 on 18 August 2019 back to top\n\nTreading water - June 2019\n\n\"In all darkness there is light and in all light there is darkness.\" - Yogi Bhajan\n\nRight now the place I feel happiest and most connected is at my allotments; in working with the earth, in loving and being creative with my plants, and in being grateful for each magical surprise I'm greeted by each time I go down there: Last season I was disappointed that the saved poppy seed I'd sown on my '2nd' allotment never materialised. This month, however, a stunning display of red poppies populated my '1st' allotment where I hadn't sown anything. They've brought me much joy.\n\nThe rest of the time I'm feeling completely lost; just treading water; questioning everything... Who am I? What makes me happy? What's important to me? Where do I want to be? Do I still want to be a professional musician? The reality is that nobody can help me... most likely nobody really cares... I must chose to live my life for me. I prefer to think of this as a new beginning...\n\nThe one thing I'm certain of is that I love playing the piano, and my only life goal is to be able to play the piano well (to feel as free as a bird): After hours and months of practising, I suddenly got the hang of playing 'Fugue in G' by J. S. Bach, and it felt wonderful. I was also proud of how I made it through and even enjoyed my solo gig at Thameside Folk (for which I sang and performed my own songs on multiple instruments) plus raised money for Essex Wildlife Trust.\n\nPosted @ 15:06:43 on 09 July 2019 back to top\n\nFilm reviewing - May 2019\n\nI know what I'm worth professionally, and shouldn't settle for less: a mantra I must repeat to myself often...\n\nbecause I can trust my gut.\n\nIt's so invigorating to be enormously challenged as an artist: I was offered a job reviewing all genres of lesbian erotic cinema by a company in America, but in the end it didn't work out because I wasn't happy with the terms of the contract. The journey I went on in preparing myself for this role, however, was far from wasted because I was able to complete my first film review to great acclaim. It was the most difficult piece I've ever had to write but I learnt loads and was able to face down more of my personal demons.\n\nPosted @ 15:55:32 on 17 June 2019 back to top\n\nTime to create more art! - April 2019\n\nThis month was spent working on loving and believing in myself again with the help of new friends and my yoga practice.\n\nThroughout the worst depression I can remember, I've remained committed to self-growth, artistic growth, and exploring new places.\n\nI'm listening to and following my internal nudges more, having applied for work which is excitingly outside of my safe zone, plus I rediscovered all that I've composed, drawn and written; my truth and reality solidified.\n\nPosted @ 14:36:14 on 12 May 2019 back to top\n\nMuse - March 2019\n\nThe World I Live In\n\nI have refused to live\n\nlocked in the orderly house of\n\nreasons and proofs.\n\nThe world I live in and believe in\n\nis wider than that. And anyway,\n\nwhat's wrong with Maybe?\n\nYou wouldn't believe what once or\n\ntwice I have seen. I'll just\n\ntell you this:\n\nonly if there are angels in your head will you\n\never, possibly, see one.\n\nby Mary Oliver\n\nThe late poet, Mary Oliver's book, 'Felicity' made me feel not so alone in how I see the world, and for the third time in my career a fellow artist has touched me so deeply as to change my life; the beautiful Magdalene St. Michaels.\n\nPosted @ 13:00:26 on 14 April 2019 back to top\n\nExtract from 'Busking in Paris Pre-Brexit' - February 2019\n\nSquare Jehan-Rictus, Place des Abbessess, Paris - 19th February 2019\n\nSitting in the square under Le mur des je t'aime with a face full of sun, I felt as if I'd lost my love of music and even of Paris, but the second I began fiddling some improvised jazz, Scottish folk and Allegro attrib. G. F. Handel (without any expectations), I fell straight back in love with what I do.\n\nI received a donation and smiles from a guy with slate grey hair and an appreciative Frenchwoman who'd been listening on a bench with her man, and sensed that I'd undergone a massive sea change since I was last here.\n\nA very tall black man paid me a compliment and lingered annoyingly as he mumbled something about food and playing the violin. I then thought I saw Nuna, all wrapped up, listening to me.\n\nFor a change my violin felt totally comfortable tucked under my chin as I continued to fiddle for the sheer love - until a boy on amplified guitar blasted me off the pitch.\n\nAfterwards, I went for a coffee at one of my favourite haunts, Au Rendez-Vous des Amis, where it was good to be remembered by Pascale; a pal of my late violinist friend, Piotr Urbanik: Peter (as I'd known him) and I (on double bass) had performed traditional music around these parts seven years ago. Pascale then informed the woman serving that Peter had lived a free life and had played lovely violin.\n\nTo read more about my busking adventures in Paris and on the London Underground, you'll soon be able to purchase e-books published by Brandy Publications containing all of my writings. More details soon!\n\nPosted @ 11:26:04 on 10 March 2019 back to top\n\nJanuary 2019 - Amsterdam from an artist's perspective\n\nPlease check out my Instagram profile at: instagram.com/gemmaboyd407/ to see the photographs I took and artwork I did based on my four days in a delightfully snowy Amsterdam.\n\nTo have been there in the heavy snow was a dream as an artist: It added a soft, clean edge to the pleasingly straight dark lines of the distinctive old buildings, whose top floors lean out steeply towards each other as if to kiss across the cobbled streets.\n\nI managed to capture the reflection of a huge yellow moon in an iced-over river in Westerpark, as cyclist after cyclist zoomed past me on their evening commutes home, plus I was astonished to see a display of daffodils in Sloterdijk village.\n\nFascinating, too, was the street art. I made photo collages of the images I captured in order to say something unique about music, the café smoking room culture, and the beauty of the womanly form.\n\nThe snow accentuated the sharp angles of dark green palm tree leaves, and I loved the tall black houses the shape and thinness of Toblerone segments; both such dramatic spectacles.\n\nPosted @ 15:17:08 on 17 February 2019 back to top\n\nDecember 2018\n\nI celebrated all of the challenging personal and professional journeys I took in 2018 towards cultivating more of a sense of self-worth.\n\nPosted @ 15:50:36 on 09 January 2019 back to top\n\nHow using BestSelf Co's Self Journal has made me into an optimist in just one month - November 2018\n\nI've been using BestSelf Co's Self Journal for one month to plan my days, and here are what have been the deluge of benefits:\n\nI feel more present and energised than I have done in months.\n\nI'm far more productive and often get more done than I plan to.\n\nI'm learning loads about myself and the value of setting SMART goals.\n\nI'm more playful, imaginative, creative and proactive.\n\nI've been regularly stepping out of my comfort zone and into the company of like-minded artists.\n\nI've rediscovered my purpose as an artist and what I truly love to do.\n\nI've made some very supportive and inspiring friends who are on the same 'Self Journal' journey as me.\n\nI'm enjoying fuller, well-paced days by scheduling enough rest and quality time with my family.\n\nI'm developing healthier habits.\n\nI've rewarded myself with an affordable short break to Amsterdam next January with one of my musical instruments.\n\nI'm better able to power through the odd shitty day and to shrug off the odd shitty person.\n\nI've felt proud of myself for having tried my very best for my child private music students, for which their parents have shown me genuine appreciation.\n\nEvery Monday I put aside ample time for a 'heart, head and body' self check-in before planning the coming week.\n\nI'm making less excuses for myself and am getting my butt off the sofa more.\n\nPosted @ 20:27:18 on 01 December 2018 back to top\n\nOctober 2018: The Empowered Musician\n\n\"Music produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without.\" - Confucius (many thanks to my friend, Hina, for this quote).\n\nThe FutureLearn course put together by the University of Sheffield, 'How To Write Your Own Song', was so enjoyable and very clear about all of the elements needed to craft a song, that I didn't want it to end. I now feel a lot more confident about songwriting, and look forward to getting stuck in and passing on what I've learnt to my students.On the menu this month, made with produce from my allotments: Pumpkin, banana and chickpea curry.The Empowered Musician day run by the Incorporated Society of Musicians was amazing. Some of the main points that spoke volumes to me:\n\nGenius is enhanced through being creative.\n\nFreelance musicians should regard themselves as a business unit with their own suite of contracts drawn up.\n\nTips for a portfolio artist such as myself: Know your story and who you're telling it to; know who you are as an artist; understand your market; find an area to work in that's most natural to you; make music that's new and special.\n\nDigital multimedia arts are an exciting medium to explore.\n\nManagers shouldn't charge you to represent them.\n\nTrust the people that you know.\n\nCreate a scene.\n\nThe idea of the collective is so important.\n\nFind a gap that's social.\n\nMake a plan.\n\nSend music to broadcasters.\n\nMost helpfully for me, composer, educator and researcher, Dr Kirsty Devaney mentioned that she uses the Self Journal for goal setting (which I really need to be doing more of). I now have a copy which I aim to start using in November.\n\nTeaching music privately has demanded that I develop my assertiveness skills as opposed to letting my anger get the better of me in frustrating situations. I haven't quite cracked it yet, but am a lot better at putting my point across without apology than I was at this time last year.\n\nPosted @ 17:10:32 on 01 November 2018 back to top\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nIt was good to catch up with my Worthing-based musician and artist friend, Michael Bishop (www.michaelbishopmusic.com): I feel an urge to reconnect musically and artistically with my mates in the south-east.\n\nI set up two new Facebook pages: Hainault and Chigwell Musicians and Gemma Boyd's Piano, Violin & Double Bass Teaching Studio, which you can find here under the link, 'Social Media & Commended Links'.\n\nSeptember was a tough month, with my beloved cat, Buddy being ill and personal struggles, but I took on a new teenage piano student. She's studying GCSE Music, which is exciting.\n\nPosted @ 18:46:02 on 08 October 2018 back to top\n\nResilience and the death of Irish poet, Matthew Sweeney - August 2018\n\nThis blog is dedicated to the wonderful Irish poet, Matthew Sweeney, who died this month. He taught me poetry at Morley College, London when I was in my twenties, and I shall never forget how he encouraged my writing in the face of the comments of some of the more traditionalist members of the class and likened my work to that of Sylvia Plath.\n\nThe Appointment\n\nAfter he'd crossed seven borders\n\non trains, in cars, on foot,\n\nand each language he heard\n\nmeant less to him than the last,\n\nhe came to a wooded lake,\n\nand he knew, looking at it,\n\nthat in winter it froze over,\n\nthat people walked across it\n\nto the island in the middle\n\nwhere bonfires were lit\n\nand dozens dance and sang\n\nto fresh-made music,\n\nlaughing amid the snow -\n\nhe knew, because he'd seen this\n\nin a recurring dream,\n\nand he'd been among them\n\ndancing alone.\n\nAnd now he'd come here\n\nbut not in winter,\n\nso he jumped in and swam,\n\nand a red-tailed hawk\n\nled him to the island,\n\nwhere among the silver birch\n\nhe found a lantern\n\nand a two-stringed guitar\n\nwhich he practised on\n\ntill he plucked out a jig\n\nthat set his feet tapping\n\nand got him singing,\n\nlouder and louder,\n\nout across the water\n\nto the listening town -\n\nwhen he lit the lantern\n\nhe knew the boats would come.\n\nMATTHEW SWEENEY\n\nI was pleased to be accepted as a member into the Incorporated Society of Musicians (ISM); the UK's professional body for musicians, through which I hope to meet and play with other like-minded musicians.\n\nHaving felt demotivated and scattered for various reasons for quite a while, I embarked on a Professional Resilience course run by Deakin University and www.futurelearn.com. I highly recommend this course, which highlighted for me that I need to develop a strong social network again, and to set doable goals on a regular basis.\n\n\"Essentialism: Only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.\" - Greg McKeown\n\nOn the menu this month, made with produce from my allotment: Spicy ridged cucumber and apple chutney; onion and cucumber relish; spicy beetroot and orange chutney; dark chocolate and yellow damson cake, and red wine.\n\nJan and I welcomed into our furry family, Philip Glass, the blue tortoiseshell rescue kitten. He's very special in that approximately only one in 3000 blue tortoiseshell cats are male!\n\nMy recipe for resilience in 2018: Love myself, love what I do, find like-minded, supportive people, and in the hardest of times, push the extra mile, take a breather, and see what comes.\n\nPosted @ 11:50:51 on 11 September 2018 back to top\n\nThree new additions to my family of musical instruments - July 2018\n\nFor the purpose of teaching 10-year-old Jon, who has an incredible memory, I've been learning the classical guitar. The sounds it makes are ethereal, and I find using the p i m a fingerstyle technique, deeply relaxing. As a treat to myself for the hard work I've put in with my teaching, I bought an acoustic guitar to go with my classical one (which had been sat in a corner for years since Jan bought it for me from a charity shop on Western Road, Brighton and Hove).\n\nMusicland in Romford gave me a good deal on the acoustic guitar, so I bought a second-hand viola to go with it. I now own all the instruments of a string quartet! It's very exiting, and I have lots of ideas for new busking / performing / composing ventures, whizzing around.\n\nThe icing on the cake has been my partner, Jan, buying for me (from Musicland, Romford again), a gorgeous white Yamaha digital piano! I've been waiting all my life to own 88 keys, and these days it's hard to shift me off the piano bench!\n\nYoga and meditation are helping me to become a more focused, precise and creative musician.\n\nAnother highlight of this month was the piano party I threw for my 9-year-old piano student, Raima, who's been learning with me for just over a year. We improvised together, she played her favourite pieces, her own compositions, and she sang along to a ragtime piece I played. Our audience were her family, who made a delicious Indian brunch in celebration. It was important for both of us to honour our respective journeys that had brought us to this point.\n\nOn the menu this month (using produce grown on my allotments): Fig and rhubarb crumble, and cucumber, lemon, garlic, coriander and chilli chutney.\n\nPosted @ 15:58:12 on 02 August 2018 back to top\n\nThe massive learning curve involved in setting up a private music teaching practice - June 2018\n\nEach of my five private music students (three studying piano, one violin, and one classical guitar), range in age from child to adult and have wildly differing personalities, musical and personal needs. My parents have their own individual ideas about the musical and social outcomes they want for their children. In the midst of all this, it's been hard to acknowledge and respect my own limitations, and to stand firm in the establishment of my professional boundaries. I love the fact that I've been able to utilize my yoga, counselling skills, my enjoyment of forensically researching and thinking about how best to solve problems, and I'm learning a ton about how to implement new ideas into my teaching. It's a job that's in turn massively rewarding and massively frustrating, but it's forcing me to grow very rapidly as a person and musician. I'm so glad to have been able to add teaching to my pallet as a musician, but also have a yearning to balance it out with performing again.\n\nFrom watching the International Day of Yoga Summit 2018 online, I picked up the following jewels of wisdom which I took on board both for myself, and for my students:\n\nDo 15 minutes of what you love every day.\n\nDo it; then stop doing it.\n\nIn one deep breath, everything can change.\n\nTake little steps. With each one, you shall become more empowered.\n\nOwn your power and live your truth.\n\nWith discipline comes freedom.\n\nPosted @ 15:06:44 on 23 July 2018 back to top\n\nSecret Paris - May 2018\n\nLa REcyclerie, 18th arr.\n\nI was lost again (not difficult to be in Paris), but finally spotted the street sign for Boulevard Ornano which I had to muscle my way down; through crowds exploring the market that lined its entire (very long) length. Having ducked into a store which sold seemingly every household item you could think of including yoga-related articles such as dusty incense boxes piled up in blocks, I was tempted to buy (but resisted) a mala made out of royal blue crystals.La REcyclerie is a spacious café / bar furnished with recycled items such as bikes, window frames, signage. Rubber plants and climbers cover the windows and creep around overhanging beams. The chatty guy who served me observed that, \"Paris is a little expensive and a little dirty, but a cool place.\" Exactly why I love it! I settled down with my vanilla latte and gluten-free carrot cake to do a sketch inspired by my day. A French girl (a student) sauntered over to ask me to fill in a questionnaire about what qualities drew me to this peculiar place that I felt so at home in.Picpus Historical Cemetery, 12th arr.The helpfulness of a group playing boules and following my nose enabled me to find the only private cemetery in Paris. On entering some gates I was confronted by a fat Frenchman slumped asleep in a deckchair. His German shepherd barked at me, then I was unexpectedly charged an entrance fee of two euros. The dog, man and I quickly formed an unspoken bond before I was seduced by startling roses of different shades, a pair of chickens, a meditation garden soothed by a dead straight architecture of trees, and an allotment to the rear with a caravan on it. All of this as thunder rolled continuously, and I luxuriated in the touch of rain on my face.Ligne de petite ceinture de Paris\n\nA disused railway line given over completely to wildlife and graffiti; I enjoyed a peaceful litter-free and (surprisingly for Paris) dog shit-free walk in the woods with majestic residences peeping through the leaves.\n\nPosted @ 19:08:43 on 12 July 2018 back to top\n\nApril 2018\n\nThe mother of my Grade 5 Violin student told me that I was bringing out the best in her daughter, Aryaa by challenging her, but being understanding of her needs at the same time. I felt proud of this, and I took on an 11-year-old Grade 4 Piano student called Aaron.\n\nMore digital art pieces of my cats and emotions were about all I could do in the face of particularly paralysing PMT.\n\nOn the menu this month: Red lentil dahl containing purple broccoli fresh from my allotment.\n\nI taught my friend, Aprille, hand and forearm stretches to help her with her classical guitar playing. We also took part in the '3 Day Challenge' with Cathy Heller (creator and host of the popular podcast, 'Don't Keep Your Day Job'), which helped me think about my new business ideas in terms of getting to know my ideal online and offline buyers.\n\nJazz pianist, Shan Verma's 'Jazz Skills' webinars continued to inspire both my piano playing and my teaching, and I participated in Meryl Pugh's Advanced Poetry Workshop at Morley College, London.\n\nThe brilliant Curious Piano Teachers member's site is helping me to develop fun teaching ideas, which are already benefiting my students.\n\nPosted @ 10:47:37 on 08 May 2018 back to top\n\nMarch 2018\n\nMy Polish concert pianist friend, Nuna and I were saying how fortunate we are to have the gift of being able to play music in these dark times of terrorism, war, greed and apathy.\n\nMark Tanner's book, The Mindful Pianist - Focus, practise, perform, engage, really brought home to me the value of savouring and listening to the sound of each and every note I play on my instruments (from beginning to end); a concept I've passed on to my students.\n\nI was reminded of the importance of focusing completely on just one task at a time to aid performance, as I studied Mindfulness for Well-being and Peak Performance with Monash University in Australia and FutureLearn.\n\nA guy called David Macphee told me that on seeing The Priory Street Stardusters (the 1930s and '40s swing jazz and blues band I played double bass in for five years) play at Pavilion Gardens Cafe, Brighton, his wife had been inspired to open leading club, Penny Black Jazz Cafe in Shenzhen, China. This was warming to know.\n\nMy dear friend, Aprille (a yoga and meditation teacher), loved my prescription (which came from the heart) for how to recapture her musical gift through playing classical guitar. In turn, I celebrated 10 years of being a self-employed musician by replacing the strings on the Romanian classical guitar my partner, Jan, bought me from a charity shop in Brighton, and recorded some meditation-inspired tunes on it.\n\nStreet I Am - The Outdoor Urban Culture Website, published more of my busking blogs, which I'm editing with a view to turn them into e-books.\n\nPosted @ 09:33:31 on 26 April 2018 back to top\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nThis month was mostly concerned with getting to know my new private music students and their specific needs (I took on Amy; another piano student who's 13 and sounds as if she's got a natural gift for playing tunes from YouTube by ear). I've also been recommended as a music teacher, which was rewarding.\n\nIt was a pleasure to sell a digital art sketch, 'Ginger Cat' to my jazz saxophonist friend, Paul, in Brighton. I want to try and sell more of my art, plus I was very much inspired by watching the resilience of some of the competitors in the PyeongChang 2018 Olmpic Winter Games.\n\nEveryone at Romford Folk Club did our fellow musician and friend, Kriss Pouch ('Mountain Man') proud at his funeral, and I played violin solo and with various groups at his wake: May he rest well beneath his beloved trees.\n\nOn the menu this month: Pumpkin pancakes, made with pumpkin grown on my allotment.\n\nAround the time of Valentine's Day I created a digital art sketch called 'Valentine's blossom', which I was delighted to see encouraged my friend, Aprille and her children to do similar trees, but with their fingerprints. Aprille's Visualisation Meditations were the spark which produced more sketches from me: 'Liquid sunlight' and 'Spirit animals', which can be seen on my Instagram profile: https://www.instagram.com/gemmaboyd407/\n\nI achieved fame at last when I appeared alongside Rod Standen's supergroup on the cover of the latest issue of Essex Folk News, and I collected lots of exciting information about teaching and running music workshops in the community from the Music and Drama Education Expo at London Olympia.\n\nPosted @ 18:04:20 on 05 March 2018 back to top\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nMy first lesson of 2018 learnt: People can be disgustingly narcissistic. Get EVERYTHING in writing before doing business with them!\n\nOn the menu this month (made with pumpkin from my allotment): Pumpkin and black bean burgers, vegan pumpkin and chilli pretzels, and pumpkin and apple soup.\n\nI took on two new private music students: Kaya (a five-year-old, left-handed beginner pianist), and Aryaa (a 12-year-old, to whom I will be teaching Grade 5 Violin). I shall enjoy this challenge.\n\nEngaging in daily meditation (with Aprille Walker of The Yoga Ranger Studio's online meditation course) and yoga, is opening creative doors: I'm more prolific in terms of composing music than I've ever been before; having written ambient pieces, 'Mudra of a Thousand Petals', 'Frustration' and 'Breath Meditation' (all of which can be heard on this website under the link, 'Music and Poetry: Listen', on my SoundCloud widget).\n\nOn a very quiet morning at Tesco, Woodford Green, I also raised almost £60 for Marie Curie cancer care.\n\nPosted @ 12:14:05 on 04 February 2018 back to top\n\nDecember 2017\n\nThis blog is dedicated to my friend and fellow multi-instrumentalist, Kriss Pouch, who passed away late this month. It'd been a privilege to have him and his dancing leprechaun beside me on my feature night at Romford Folk Club back in October.\n\nOn the menu this month: Easy vegan red lentil dahl; easy vegan nut roast, and winter vegetable curry with fruity raita (containing pumpkin from my allotment).After having found a fox cub that had been poisoned on my allotment during the summer, then later hearing rumours that some of the people whose houses back onto the allotments were responsible, I took it upon myself to make 'Humane Fox Deterrence' flyers (with a sketch I'd done of my favourite fox on it), and distributed them around the neighbourhood. This didn't go down at all well with one of the committee members on the allotment, who told me to \"get a life,\" screwed my poster up, and shouted, \"Everyone throws stones at foxes!\" I then got the backing of the local Wildlife Crime Unit who said that they'd carry out more regular inspections of the allotments. This was such a stressful time, but it was lovely to have the support of my friends and partner throughout. Also, due to my concerns about poisoning, we welcomed into our family the black cat (Buddy), who'd been my constant companion on my allotments for over a year. I performed on cello in public for the first time my composition, 'Winter Solstice' at Romford Folk Club, where I also won a beautiful red rose for being the 'Best Female Instrumentalist of 2017'. This meant a huge amount to me as I love this club and its lovely, talented members.Snow fell thickly on December 10th, and I enjoyed taking photos of snowmen and snowladies with amazing hairstyles at Claybury Park, Ilford. Jan and I also discovered the wonderful Cafe Ila on Fencepiece Road, Barkingside.My studies in Mindfulness and Social Enterprise were very exciting and I look forward to applying what I've learnt to my next project, which will be: Offering female survivors of incest affordable creative workshops in a sphere of subjects (music / art / poetry / gardening), on a termly basis. Imaginatively designed as vehicles to self-expression and well-being, these workshops will take place in an encouraging and safe space.I felt proud of the testimonial I received from Rashmi and Raima Singh for teaching piano to Raima, and I calmed myself while having my annual Christmas panic attacks by doing more digital artwork.Wishing you all a very happy, healthy, peaceful and loving 2018!\n\nPosted @ 10:43:27 on 04 January 2018 back to top\n\nNovember 2017\n\nRegarding the progress my double bass, violin and piano student, Stuart's made on violin, his mum congratulated me (it's very rewarding to hear the music he's been studying begin to 'come alive' under his fingertips), and I was touched by the gift my piano student, Raima, brought me back from India.\n\nI'm enjoying composing material for Stuart and I to play together: 'Blues for Stuart' for piano and double bass; a reworking of 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' for two violins, and for myself I wrote 'Winter Solstice' for cello (a delicious instrument which I now practise seriously).\n\nOn the menu this month (made with produce from my allotment): Pumpkin pie, 'Spanish' roasted pumpkin seeds with smoked paprika, pear and pumpkin soup, and fig and sultana 'Golden Glow' wine.\n\nAt the Docklands Maritime Festival in London, I performed on fiddle with duo, Mikanora, the great folk songs, 'Green Grow the Rashes', 'Windy Ol' Weather', 'Drunken Sailor' and 'Freight Train'. I also completed a Community Journalism course with Cardiff University and FutureLearn.\n\nI was telling the American actress, Barbara Niven on Facebook how I write candidly about my battle with OCD and PTSD in a blog and that only one person every comments. My hope is that someone who feels as desperate as I've often felt will stumble across it and see that there is hope. It also helps me to read it back and see how far I've come. She got back to me with a very encouraging and profound reply, some of which I shall share with you here: \"Thank you, Gemma for putting your heart and truth out there! What a beautiful spirit and soul you have, and I know you are reaching many people. Perhaps right now only one person is commenting on your blog, but it doesn't mean that others are not seeing it. I bet someone who is struggling the most is getting the most out of what you are writing - but perhaps they are not at a point in their lives when they can actually put words to what they are feeling. It's a great gift you have that allows you to do it. You will probably never know the lives you are touching. Please keep trying, because the world needs beautiful, giving people like you and the lessons you can teach. If we never go through tough times, we can never learn lessons. And if we never learn lessons, we can never teach them to someone else... You touched my heart today...\"\n\nWishing you all a very happy and peaceful Christmas and 2018!\n\nPosted @ 16:25:13 on 15 December 2017 back to top\n\nOctober 2017\n\nOn the menu this month (made with produce from my allotments): Roast beetroot with cumin seeds, aubergine and courgette pasta, green tomato jam with ginger and vanilla, vegan courgette and chocolate cake, courgette meatballs, lime and courgette cake, courgette and parsnip chutney, raspberry and vanilla tea, courgette wine, purple basil pesto with tomato and aubergine pasta, turmeric zucchini soup, 10 minute Thai peanut butter and pumpkin soup, and pumpkin latte.\n\nThe 2017 film, 'Gerald's Game' (story by Stephen King), was excellent in how it dealt with the issue of childhood sexual abuse.\n\nIt thrilled me to finally be able to play 'Autumn Leaves' on piano with chord inversions, and I enjoyed performing my feature night at Romford Folk Club: I sang and played all my instruments and read my poetry in a celebration of my musical life and all the places I've lived. People appreciated the amount of variety and humour in my performance, and folk singer, Garry Walker, called it a \"magical night.\" I was pleased given that I'd had to really fight to keep my demons firmly locked up in a cupboard in order to do this.\n\nMy partner, Jan's brother, David, very kindly bought me an iPad Pro and an iPencil for my birthday, which I've loved using to do more experimental digital art, and my double bass, piano and violin student, Stuart, told me that my teachings contribute to a \"circle of love\" he experiences with all of the approximately 20 instruments he plays (lovely)! In his honour, I composed a round for two violins called 'Singing Cave'.\n\nI also achieved a FutureLearn Certificate of Achievement from the University of Sheffield for their course, Forensic Facial Reconstruction: Finding Mr. X, and got The Fox Project to change their messaging service on Facebook that they'd misrepresented.\n\nPosted @ 15:53:00 on 24 November 2017 back to top\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nThe drama series, Top of the Lake (Jane Campion, Garth Davis and Gerard Lee) and its sequel, Top of the Lake: China Girl (Jane Campion and Gerard Lee) were pieces of art I found to be truly original, courageous, thought-provoking, exquisite, inspiring and exciting in every sense.\n\nThe University Libraries at Cambridge, Oxford and Trinity College in Dublin and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales, all have copies, now, of my debut collection of poetry, Vivarium.\n\nOn the menu this month (made with produce from my allotment): Yellow damson and banana smoothie, green tomato cake, white potatoes with mint, roasted courgettes and beetroot, moist rhubarb cake and red wine.\n\nJan and I enjoyed the Best of the Music Fest by Redbridge Music Lounge and the Green Fair Music Club at Valentines Mansion and Gardens, Ilford. We also celebrated 10 years of being together.\n\nAt Romford Folk Club I sang English folk songs a cappella for the first time and was complimented on the quality of my voice, which was encouraging.\n\nI'm beginning to trust in my own methods as a double bass, violin and piano teacher: It takes time and patience!\n\nPosted @ 09:03:07 on 17 October 2017 back to top\n\nAugust 2017\n\nMy partner, Jan, bought me a cello, bless her! I'd always wanted one, and it sounds and feels sublime!\n\nThis month was taken up mainly with completing 250 illustrations by hand to go in five copies of my poetry book, Vivarium, for the Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries, teaching music, and doing more creative coding sketches using Processing 3.\n\nThe very helpful shop assistant in Shepherds, London, where I purchased bookbinding materials for the making of Vivarium, told me about the art of coptic binding, which I enjoyed mastering: It's taken me two years to publish this book exactly the way I want it, but I'm glad I persisted with it.\n\nI made the following with produce from my allotments: Yellow damson chutney, kale smoothie, savoy cabbage curry, blackberry chutney, rhubarb gin, yellow damson vodka, green tomato chutney and rhubarb hummus.\n\nIt was lovely see that many of my followers on social media connected deeply with my poetry.\n\nPosted @ 14:06:43 on 15 September 2017 back to top\n\nJuly 2017\n\nA musician I much admire; Barry Harris' jazz workshop at the Vortex Jazz Club in London, was, as always, a special experience. I couldn't get a look in given that the great jazz sage was immediately surrounded at the piano by a crush of young, male student-types who refused to budge. Merely being in Harris' presence for a short time was enough to inspire me, though - before I demanded a refund for my ticket.\n\nThis is an amazing poem by my friend, Naomi Foyle, about the Grenfell Tower tragedy:\n\nGoing on Crutches to Grenfell Tower\n\nafter Ben Okri\n\n*If you want to see how the poor die, come see Grenfell Tower.*\n\nA Nigerian summons me to London from the sea.\n\nA Palestinian gives me directions from the south bank of the\n\nriver.\n\nAs I hesitate at the head of a plummeting escalator\n\ntwo sharp-suited businessmen turn to help me\n\ndescend into the Underground.\n\nIt’s rush hour and the carriages are crammed.\n\nBoarding the train, I shrug off my back pack,\n\ntuck it with the crutches close to my body,\n\nand grab the overhead rail, realising too late\n\nall this is difficult, strains my weak arm;\n\nas the force of the train rocks through me,\n\nan Irishman asks if I need help.\n\n‘I’m okay’, I say, and lurch against the door.\n\nQuietly, in a gesture that reminds me\n\nof the formal way South Koreans offer money,\n\nhe grips my elbow, holds my arm\n\nbetween Waterloo and Westminster —\n\nto keep him upright, he laughs\n\nbefore he hops off\n\nand I take his place by the plexiglass partition\n\nwith its yellow vertical grab-rail.\n\n‘Will someone give this lady a seat?’\n\na man asks. Not a single person looks up.\n\nOnly one of my fellow passengers is asleep.\n\n‘Charming,’ I murmur. The man repeats his question\n\nand a woman stands, without a word or a glance.\n\nI sit. I have taken her seat,\n\nher prized rush hour seat,\n\nbut I needed to sit.\n\nI felt unsafe on my feet.\n\nIf you want to see how the poor die, come see Grenfell Tower.\n\nAt Baker St Station it strikes me\n\nthat heeding the call of the poet\n\nwasn’t, perhaps, such a great idea.\n\nAs I teeter down a flight of stairs\n\na train arrives at the platform below me,\n\nand disgorges a sea of people,\n\na flood of people rising toward me,\n\nfilling the stairwell, shoulder to shoulder.\n\none solid mass, an interminable force\n\nI can’t thread my way through or bypass.\n\nNeither can I turn around and go back.\n\nI have to wait on the step\n\nas people push past me,\n\nand though my mind knows\n\nthat this muscular wave will soon pass,\n\nI feel guilty for waiting.\n\nFor taking up space. For taking up time.\n\nI feel stupid for thinking I could cross London on crutches.\n\nI feel I shouldn’t have come.\n\nI am no Biblical cripple.\n\nI am not journeying to meet Christ.\n\nI don’t need to be another Grenfell gawker.\n\nI need step-free access\n\nto a train home to Brighton.\n\nBut just as I realise\n\nhow foolish I’ve been, I see\n\nthat a small miracle is occurring:\n\npeople have noticed me,\n\nare pressing closer together,\n\nand a path has appeared\n\na narrow, shining hemline\n\nalong the edge of the stairs:\n\nan invitation to continue.\n\nHugging the wall, I step\n\non down to the platform\n\nas the physiotherapist taught me:\n\n‘Good foot to heaven,\n\nbad foot to hell.’\n\n*\n\nOn the Circle line, a petite Black woman\n\nsmiles, jumps up, insists I sit,\n\nand tells me about her corrected fourth toe.\n\nShe disembarks at Royal Oak,\n\nand a couple from Colorado get on,\n\nthe woman curious about how long I have to go . . .\n\nand before I know it, the train isn’t underground anymore,\n\nwe are rushing over grey streets and grey parks\n\nand council estates, beneath a dull white sky,\n\nand then we are there, at Latimer Road,\n\nand before the train has even pulled into the station\n\nit is there too.

She's a delight, and I welcomed the challenge of teaching a child for the first time.\n\nPosted @ 11:07:36 on 15 September 2017 back to top\n\nJune 2017\n\nThis blog is dedicated to my friend, a talented photographer and animal lover, Ralph King, who died suddenly late this month.\n\n\"A garden is a grand teacher. It teaches patience and careful watchfulness; it teaches industry and thrift; above all it teaches entire trust.\" - Gertrude Jekyll\n\nI continue to believe in working hard at what you love - especially in the darkest of times of personal struggle, terrorism and corporate greed. It will pay off in unexpected ways: I've discovered I really enjoy teaching musical instruments to adult learners, and have submitted my CV to Redbridge Music Service in the hope of doing more of the same near to where I live.\n\nVia my friend, Patricia Ann Zabran: \"If a person doesn't want to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions, they may try to blame others. Don't accept blame or try to fix things for them when you've done nothing wrong. They need to learn that if they want different outcomes, they will have to make different choices.\" - Doe Zantamata\n\nSome encouragement from my jazz guitarist and singer friend, Nils Solberg, lifted my spirits this very challenging month, and another friend - Polish concert pianist and artist, Nuna, adored the study I did of my fox friend which she said contained \"poetry.\"\n\n\"Shine your light.\" - Survivors' Network\n\nClifford Luty (a fellow music enthusiast) introduced me to the wonderful music of American blues guitarist and singer, Buddy Guy.\n\n\"Each morning we are born again. What we do today is what matters most.\" - Buddha\n\nI achieved my 'gardening' goal this year of growing an aubergine, plus neared completion of the mixed media art studies inspired by my allotments I'm hoping to publish and sell.\n\nOut of the blue I was called up by the fixer of Woodford Symphony Orchestra who desperately needed a double bassist. I excitedly obliged, and very much enjoyed playing in their classical concert for the British Red Cross at Roding Valley High School in Loughton. It was an especially amazing experience playing the piece, 'Sheep May Safely Graze' by Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\n\"Don't wait until you've reached your goal to be proud of yourself.

I also attended a challenging and exciting Bookbinding course at Create Space in Bethnal Green.\n\n\"Nothing diminishes anxiety faster than action.\" - Walter Anderson\n\nThe 'black dog' paid me a long visit this month for devastating reasons, but watching everything I'd grown from seed flourishing on my allotments, kept my head above water. Having spotted two fox cubs there, also cheered me up.\n\nOn the wall at the The Golden Lion pub, Romford: \"Try. There are no mistakes, only lessons.\"\n\nI enjoyed talking 'jazz' with my new friend, Cliff Luty on Twitter and think that I can safely say that OCD is no longer the boss of me.\n\nVia my friend, Alison Gardener: \"You must not fear, hold back, count or be a miser with your thoughts and feelings. It is also true that creation comes from an overflow, so you have to learn to intake, to imbibe, to nourish yourself and not be afraid of fullness. The fullness is like a tidal wave which then carries you, sweeps you into experience... Permit yourself to flow and overflow, allow for the rise in temperature, all the expansions and intensifications. Something is always born of excess: great art was born of great terrors, great loneliness, great inhibitions, instabilities, and it always balances them. If it seems to you that I move in a world of certitudes, you, par contre... must benefit from the great privilege which is that you move in a world of mysteries. But both must be ruled by faith.\" - Anaïs Nin\n\nDespite feeling like death, I still managed to teach double bass, violin and piano to my student: My music always has my back - if I work hard.\n\n\"Music... will help dissolve your perplexities and purify your character and sensibilities, and in time of care and sorrow, will keep a fountain of joy alive in you.\" - Dietrich Bonhoeffer.\n\nEvery time I say \"no\" both in a professional and personal sense, I grow a little stronger.\n\nWith regards to my attempted self-directed recovery from OCD, my staunch supporter, Manya Zuba commented: \"You're working steadily towards your goal - keep going!\"\n\nPosted @ 09:01:36 on 05 June 2017 back to top\n\nApril 2017\n\n\"Opportunity does not knock, it presents itself when you beat down the door.\" - Kyle Chandler\n\nI composed and performed at Romford Folk Club some more pieces: 'Deep Heart' and 'Monge Market' for piano accordion; 'Beeswax' for piano, and 'The Boatman's Mumbles' for fiddle.

AudenRegarding my journey to recovering from OCD, my friend Manya Zuba commented, \"Seems to me you've got substantial breakthroughs here! Congratulations! Keep playing and working on music! And breathing, of course. Onward!\" Her encouragement meant so much.\n\nPosted @ 10:56:36 on 12 December 2016 back to top\n\nOCTOBER 2016\n\nThis summer I noticed a marked change in peoples' attitude to me as a busker on the London Underground: I got the lovely reactions and good tips, still, but they were few and far between. Mostly I got literally kicked out of the way; quizzical looks; sarcastic comments - and felt I was wasting my time, my energy and talent. I'd come home feeling miserable, devalued, depressed and alone on this planet increasingly populated by disconnected automatons. I was beginning to hate being a musician but could see no way out because an artist is what I am. This, combined with the fact I was addressing trauma from my past in counselling, put me in a very dark place.\n\nI tried to hold on to my friend, Anne Macaulay's words, \"Look at all the beauty you have created at your allotment and your photos, your painting, your poetry, your music. And we all gain from seeing and hearing your work. You are a person of great worth contributing greatly to others' well-being through your art and of course as yourself. Breathe slowly and deeply. Unpick the dark clouds to a list of manageable things. Take care. xx\" Recognizing that I was going through a period of transition in my career as an artist, I remained committed to the things I could do; my yoga practice, my Creative Coding online course, counselling, working on my allotment, but couldn't shake the notion that everything I love doing in terms of being an artist, is no longer of any value to society (I sold just one copy of my debut book of poetry, Vivarium).\n\nMy depression continued, but then one afternoon I was cooking Gary Rhodes's Green Tomato Tarte Tatin (using the last of this year's bounteous crop of tomatoes from my allotment), while watching two wonderful TV documentaries; about the writer and humorist Sue Townsend, and dramatist, Willy Russell - both narrated by Julie Walters; an outstanding actress I had the pleasure of working with when I was a dresser at the National Theatre. I felt so inspired by the life's work of all three and realized that even in the depths of despair, I've never fallen out of love with or stopped believing in being an artist - and my creative mojo began to reignite.\n\nOn 21st October, Jan and I welcomed into our family Trevor the Hermann's tortoise. We rescued him from one of his previous owners who'd dumped him in a pet shop where he was placed on a top shelf at the back of the shop for a month, then put in a 'sanctuary' when the pet shop owner couldn't sell him. It was obvious he was suffering from neglect and his vivarium was beyond filthy. He now lives in a tortoise 'penthouse', is eating well, and bringing us much joy. He also made me want to pick up my musical instruments again and to share little videos of my performances on Instagram!\n\nFinally, I passed my Creative Coding course with Monash University in Australia! It was a satisfying to know that I could outrun the 'black dog' / OCD, and persist with a subject I found really challenging. It also gave me a lot of ideas about how I could develop my work as an artist. I thanked writer and journalist, Hina Pandya, who told me about this FutureLearn course. She advised me to join the organization, 'Women Who Code' and to attend Tech Day, London for free, which I did, and found the connections I made could lead to some writing projects in the future.\n\nMy massive thanks and gratitude go out to my partner, Jan, my counsellor, and my friends, without whom, I don't know where I'd be.\n\nPosted @ 10:04:46 on 21 November 2016 back to top\n\nSEPTEMBER 2016\n\nI finally published the handmade version of my debut collection of poetry, Vivarium.

Other folks need to see things like that - thoughtful and fun.\" My friend, Josh Langley also wrote, \"You're an inspiration, Gemma. It's inspiring to read about how you choose to work through the trauma and OCD and not fight it. Keep writing and sharing.\" Their words really lifted my spirits, especially since the mobile phone-obsessed public showed less and less interest in my busking performances over the summer.\n\nThe beauty and wonder of synchronicity when you want something enough...\n\nThe excellent, #PTSDchat on Twitter invited me to join in their conversation about PTSD topics on a Wednesday night (I can highly recommend their podcasts of the radio show discussions they broadcast), and Josh Langley said that because he'd been inspired by my passionate desire to express myself no matter what's affecting me, he wanted to include a little segment about me in his upcoming pocket guide book, Finding Your Creative Mojo. I agreed, but confessed that I'd lost sight of what makes me tick creatively, and that I needed to re-find it.\n\nPosted @ 17:12:12 on 27 October 2016 back to top\n\nAugust 2016\n\nI began studying Creative Coding with FutureLearn and produced some interesting sketches using Processing: It felt good to be stretching myself artistically.

She showed me her collection of antique china and books from the 17th century, and I gave her a study I'd just completed of my allotment (Allotment #9 that you can view on this website under the link 'Gallery & Artwork), then played folk fiddle for her during which I think Peter appeared to me in the guise of a pigeon on her window ledge.I felt honoured when she handed me Peter's CD, Don't Kiss the Fiddler, photocopies of some of his drawings, and his Jazz Violin Studies book, plus as a gift of two antique 'Egyptian' items: a dragon pot containing sand from the Sahara desert and a paperweight. She told me that I'm \"rich\" in so much as I have my violin and my art.When I'm with Nuna I don't feel so alone as an artist: Our meeting left me feeling very happy and in love with my music again (I'd rediscovered my passion for performing music outside among the people and decided that I no longer want to spend as much of my precious time on the Internet). I visited Peter's grave in Montmartre Cemetery where a grey cat with fleas on top of a gravestone nearby looked me directly in the eye - as cats have done here before: I've always felt as if cats and Peter are spiritually connected somehow.On the menu this month (using ingredients from my allotment): Rhubarb, strawberry and ginger tart.The Brexit win of the EU Referendum was my worst nightmare come true: I'd come back to England to vote 'IN' and really wish I hadn't bothered because now I must potentially wave goodbye to my hopes and dreams of living and working in Paris on a more permanent basis. My friend, Sarah Johnsrud Ronning's comment helped me galvanize myself again, though: \"Your artist flare is incredible. I know your photos brighten my day. Plus your music. You reach and connect to so many people in such a positive way.\" I also signed all the relevant petitions in an effort to reverse this mess.\n\nPosted @ 06:44:29 on 01 August 2016 back to top\n\nParis - May 2016\n\nAt the beginning of this month I felt passionless, directionless, bored, and as if I didn't have the energy to do anything about it - so despite my fears about security following last year's terror attacks, I booked three weeks in my beloved Paris and hoped that during that time I'd rediscover what makes me tick.\n\n\"Don't keep calm. Go out and make changes. The earth is being destroyed by psychopaths.\" - anonews\n\nTo see what transpired for me music-wise this month, please visit my 'busking' blog: www.buskingmystory.com.\"You can cut all the flowers, but you cannot keep spring from coming.\" - Pablo NerudaI felt so happy to be back in Paris; the place I love, and my need to gee myself up by making daily 'good news' posts on Facebook, disappeared. With my violin case squeezed securely between my legs, I danced to Boulevard du Jazz avec les Swing Ladies, who were playing traditional jazz from New Orleans, blues and Charleston dance music outside Les Deux Magots as part of this year's Festival à Saint-Germain-des-Près. The crowd followed them as they walked the streets of Saint-Germain singing and playing, but the four ladies moved on from a planned stationary performance spot when they saw a mother and child in sleeping bags beneath a cash machine.From Brocante des Abbesses, I bought an ancient book of poetry from approximately the 1700s, entitled ŒUVRES DE ROUSSEAU, which the Frenchman who sold it to me described as being \"beautiful\" size-wise, and told me it'd been a pleasure talking to a musician who plays on the terraces of Montmartre.Weaving their way through an increased police presence were swarms of skateboarders at Place de la République, at the centre of which was the monument covered in dying floral tributes to the victims of the 13th November 2015 terrorist attacks.Life seemed to be going on so normally at Le Carillon bar in the 10ème, that I couldn't believe that this had been the scene of one of the massacres of six months ago; a good thing in that it meant that people weren't cowering under the threat of terrorism, and tell-tale signs of peoples' grief remained in the powerful artwork etched on the walls. I also visited the Bataclan theatre to pay my respects. It looked like a building site and I found it hard to have hope in the face of such unbelievable tragedy.There was nothing much to see where I was staying in the suburbs of Paris at Chevilly-Larue, apart from some interesting graffiti and a German shepherd sleeping (with one eye open) under the fruit and vegetable rack outside a general store.We had in excess of four consecutive days of non-stop torrential rain which inevitably lead the the worst flooding Paris had seen in decades, though a raft of duckings atop a pallet in the middle of a lake at Parc de Bercy didn't seem to mind much! A few times I took shelter and treated myself to a delicious meal of ratatouille, mash, goat's cheese on toast and baguette from my favourite bar in Montmartre my violinist friend, Peter introduced me to; Le Rendez-vous des Amis.My friend, Nicki Heywood, introduced me to Brett Larkin's yoga routines on YouTube, which I did daily while I was in Paris and have continued on my arrival home. Yoga practice is really helping to centre and relax me both emotionally and professionally: I can't recommend it highly enough.On a Métro train into Paris was a guy with half of his hair in a ponytail busking brilliantly on melodica along to backing tracks. Thinking that the melodica would be a more portable alternative to the accordion to take busking on the London Underground, I treated myself to a Hohner melodion and melodica from Star's Music, Paris on boulevard de Clichy.As always, the free exhibitions and events I went to were eye-opening and interesting: 'Design for Peace: 2 expositions de la collection TRANSHUMANCE'; the Paris Folk Festival at Place des Abbessess; 'Rooftops Exposition Photographies' at the Centre d' Animation Maurice Ravel in the 12ème, and the 'Breath of Aegean' - Sofia Argyropoulou exhibition.\n\nPosted @ 08:50:57 on 28 June 2016 back to top\n\nApril 2016\n\n\"My wish for you is that you continue.

Much appreciated.\"My Polish concert pianist friend, Nuna, told me that what's extraordinary about my artwork is that all my pieces 'speak' to her; that behind every one, there's a secret, a mystery, and that they're very expressive and beautiful. I set up an Instagram account to display my artwork and photography on: It feels good to have all my work in one place at a decent resolution, and my friend, Ted Michael Morgan commented, \"Gosh, I love your work. Such a flow of beautiful work causes celebration.\"\"If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need.\" - CiceroTo read about what I got up to music-wise this month, please visit my blog: www.buskingmystory.com: Niume.com featured my post, 'The Brussels bombings and dog poo - 16th -27th March 2016' on their site, which cheered me up.For the first time I attended the little group, 'Poetry Please' at Hainault Library. It was most enjoyable being sat around with other poetry lovers again, and I read out some of my most recent poems.Following up on the research I've 'pinned' on Pinterest about working as a freelance writer, is leading to further 'pinning' of relevant links.

It's all a load of bollocks, making it harder for true, authentic voices to be heard.The strength of the connection I feel to my fellow artist friends enabled me to not lose hope when I discovered Lower Marsh in London had changed irrevocably: Waterloo Library is closing next month; Grammex Classical and Jazz record store has been forced into the basement of a discount book shop, and an art gallery I used to like to go in was closed (I'm hoping just because it was a Monday).On a more positive note, OCD and it's terrible intrusive thoughts slowly lost its power over my ability to enjoy time at home with my beloved cat, Tigger, at last.\n\nPosted @ 03:21:13 on 13 May 2016 back to top\n\nMarch 2016\n\nTo read what I got up to music-wise this month, please visit: www.buskingmystory.com\n\nSome welcome encouragement from my friend, Roger J. Foregard: \"Follow your passion, which will win out in the end.\"\n\nOn Facebook: \"Not everyone will understand your journey. That's okay. You're here to live your life, not to make everyone understand.\"Through my participation in the 'Poetry Chain Collective Exchange' via email, I received from Gail Walker this poem, which in the face of trying to recover from OCD, I found very calming:The Silken TentShe is as in a field a silken tentAt midday when the sunny summer breezeHas dried the dew and all its ropes relent,So that in guys it gently sways at ease,And its supporting central cedar pole,That is its pinnacle to heavenwardAnd signifies the sureness of the soul,Seems to owe naught to any single cord,But strictly held by none, is loosely boundBy countless silken ties of love and thoughtTo every thing on earth the compass round,And only by one's going slightly tautIn the capriciousness of summer airIs of the slightest bondage made aware.by Robert FrostEven though I kept hitting dead ends, I persevered with tackling items on my business action plan.\"People buy from people.\" - Janet AweTendinitis in the back of my left forearm blighted my getting back into playing double bass yet again.\"Try to remember that OCD plants thoughts, but the thoughts have no power unless we give in and give it power... You are stronger than your OCD.\" - Sarah Johnsrud RonningI started an online 'Community Journalism' course with Cardiff University and FutureLearn, which I'm finding both exciting and inspiring, and an MA in Paris Studies peaked my interest.\n\nVia my friend, Maroca Segatto: \"The greatest act of courage is to be and own all that you are. Without apology. Without excuses and without any mask to cover the truth of who you are.\" - Alter Ego\n\nUsing Exposure and Response Prevention to self-treat my OCD, I now no longer check page numbers when turning pages, and Kay Ska of thisiswhatapersonwithmentalillnesslookslike.wordpress.com, published a feature about me which contains a link to my 'OCD' blog. Peoples' belief in me that I'll eventually beat OCD spurred me on, for example, Leanne Marie's comment: \"Your music is a good idea... Resist it [the compulsion to perform rituals to lessen 'contamination' anxiety] this time and it will be easier the next time, until you wonder what all the fuss was about... Taking your life back one scary and uncomfortable moment at a time... You are so brave right now. I don't know if I could do it. You can.\"\n\nFrom my friend, David R. Aldridge: \"Keep pushing, I'm always very proud of how hard you push past your obstacles and challenges, and I admire you for it. So very inspiring!... You'll sort it out. Take small steps. Really small, breathable steps. Steady ones. You'll get there :)\"\n\nI attended a Digital Journalism Skills Workshop run by the NUJ, which delivered what it said on the tin. I came away thinking that producing writing ideas purely for their purchasing potential is not for me, however, and the journalist, Christian Payne's mantra that \"All media is digital; all digital is mobile,\" turned me off, too: The more I explore working in the digital realm, the more I long to be outside in nature and enjoying face-to-face interaction with others.\n\nThrough using Google AdSense on one of my blogs, I earned my first 4p as a freelance writer - but I later decided that I didn't want to run adverts alongside my writing.\n\nThe decision I made to prioritize my health over my career this year was a good - and a necessary one.\n\nPosted @ 07:34:25 on 11 April 2016 back to top\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\"Competitions are for horses, not artists.\" - Béla Bartók\n\nIn a bid to earn more money with my writing, I decided to write about what I love and believe in.\n\nVia Survivors' Network on Facebook: \"Hold your friends and colleagues accountable. Challenge rape jokes, don't let sexism slide. We deserve better than a world that sees sexual violence as a joke.\"\n\nI bought Writers' & Artists' Yearbook 2016: a gem of a resource that I can highly recommend.\n\nTo read what I got up to busking-wise this month, please visit: www.buskingmystory.com\n\nThe 'Google News Lab' training workshop at Google HQ in London, run by the National Union of Journalists, opened my eyes to creating online material that's quirky, novel, stand out, shareable, emotional, topical, and which has a broad appeal.\n\nVia Survivors' Network on Facebook: \"Look after yourself. You deserve to be listened to, to be loved, to express yourself. Follow the advice we so often give others and so rarely do for ourselves, and take time for yourself.\"\n\nMy Polish concert pianist friend, Nuna, admired the \"poetic\" aspect of my 'Allotment' studies (the latest of which you can view under 'Gallery' on this website).\n\nwabi-sabi = (n.) a way of living that focuses on finding beauty within the imperfections of life and accepting peacefully the natural cycle of growth and decay\n\n\"It's 29 years since Andy Warhol died. If he were alive today he'd look around and say, \"Wow. This is even more fucked up than I predicted.\" - Bette Midler\n\nThe Heart Is a Foreign Country\n\nOurs is a partial language part pantomime,\n\npart grimy guesswork: adulterated speculation\n\nas to meaning & motivation.\n\nTranslated, heart suggests a familiar, universal\n\ndevice but internal chemistries vary -\n\nthough components be the same & not uncommon.\n\nThe world owes us nothing. It promises less.\n\nCall it: freedom. Free will. Or Wednesday.\n\nby Rangi McNeil\n\nA number of mental health sites shared my 'OCD' blog: Hopefully I will help some fellow OCD sufferers along the way and go some towards challenging the shame, denial, embarrassment and ignorance that still surrounds mental illness and childhood sexual abuse.\n\nI raised £73.18 for Marie Curie cancer care at Tesco, Barkingside, north east London; the most I'd ever collected in my bucket.\n\nPosted @ 08:18:12 on 31 March 2016 back to top\n\nJanuary 2016\n\nFirstly, I'd like to wish all of you a very happy and healthy 2016! Having closed the book that was 2015 in the knowledge that I survived and grew some, my wish for the coming year is for global and personal peace.\n\n\"Poetry is the clear expression of mixed feelings.\" - W. H. Auden\n\nDaffodils,\n\nWith the green world\n\nThey live in.\n\n- KEATS\n\nI took the whole of January off work so I could try to figure out what I want out of my life and career, and in an attempt to pull myself out of depression and fear about the general state of the world, I decided to do a personal / universal 'Good News' post on Facebook for every day of 2016, which a couple of friends have found inspiring.\n\nArms folded\n\nTo the moon,\n\nAmong the cows.\n\n- KEROUAC\n\nMy debut poetry collection, Vivarium, is finally ready to be sent out into the world and I played double bass for five minutes most days without pain in my hands: One of my goals for this year is to get back fully into double bass playing.\n\n\"Don't be afraid to take a big step if one is indicated. You can't cross a chasm in two small jumps.\" - David Lloyd George\n\nFrom Thane Tierney on Facebook: \"\"Raise high the roof beam, carpenters. Like Ares comes the bridegroom, taller far than a tall man.\" - Sappho. Loveliest thing in the post today; a collection of poems by my pal, Gemma, one of which was dedicated to me. It wasn't this one, but this is brill:\n\nIt's impossible\n\nto remedy unrequited love,\n\nto take words back,\n\nto inhabit a dream,\n\nto imagine being dead,\n\nto know an angel,\n\nto teach a sense of rhythm.\"\"\n\nFOR BERKELEY\n\nCity of buds and flowers\n\nWhere are your fruits?\n\nWhere are your roots?\n\n- SNYDER\n\nI attended a 'skills' conference run by the National Union of Journalists and got lots of questions answered (regarding trying to break into paid freelance writing), and exciting stuff to get my teeth into.\n\nPatches of snow\n\nmirrored in the floating stream;\n\na long wedge of geese.\n\n- SPIESS\n\nOn the menu this month: Onion and red wine gravy; no butter sponge cake; allotment-grown Brussels sprouts soup; Jamie Oliver's leek and potato soup; three-pepper and onion spaghetti; hearty vegan vegetable pot pie, and broccoli soup.\n\n\"Music is a labyrinth with no beginning and no end, full of new paths to discover, where mystery remains eternal.\" - Pierre Boulez\n\nI continued with my 'allotment' artwork studies, which you can see on this web"
