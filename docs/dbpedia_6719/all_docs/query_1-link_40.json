        "text": "In recent years there have been an increasing number of biographies and autobiographies written by the leading figures of the British punk scene of the Seventies and Eighties. As we pass the 40th anniversary of 1977, it can be argued that the British punk scene has also ‘come of age’ in academia with a number of retrospectives that examine not only the contemporary impact of punk in the Seventies but also the legacy of the punk movement in shaping British culture. With a focus on John Lydon’s text Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs (1993) and Viv Albertine’s Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys (2014), this article will examine how these autobiographies draw attention to ways in which the British sub-cultural scene offered a platform through which British culture and identity could be reassessed as anti-American and anti-capitalist. This study will also highlight to what extent the self-reflexive framing of these personal narratives within the larger po...\n\nIt is Sydney 1998 and, ‘like some crazed pirate galleon on wheels’, a strange bus was seen making its way around the city. Equipped with a PA and ‘DJ booth’ facing out from its rear hatch, the Peace Bus was reported to ‘broadside renegade dance floors or earth destroying mining companies, with a barrage of sonic arsenal’. The ‘steel pulse of protest techno’ was heard from speakers positioned in the luggage hatches, as the bus made its way around Sydney ‘rattling people’s cappuccino cups’. The enthusiastic report concluded: ‘If this is a war for the future of Australia then this brightly coloured tank is there firing a funky arsenal designed to activate people into joining the growing movement for a more sustainable future.’ Committed to a nuclear-free Australia, the Ohms not Bombs techno-circus was in the driver’s seat. Likened to ‘stormtroopers spearheading a generation’s demands’ that their continent’s ecosystems be safeguarded from the radioactive perils of the nuclear industry (Daly, 1999, p. 9), Ohms were multimedia activists mobilizing for a sonic assault on the comfort zones of the nation’s psyche. But as the interventions of these and other techno-protagonists would illustrate, there was more than a nuclear-free future at stake. Impacted by a DiYactivist sensibility that can be traced back to the 1960s, appropriating new and alternative technologies and operating mobile events, these young technomad pioneers were implicated in a movement for legitimate presence and belonging in post-settler Australia. Exploring the characteristics of a ‘groovement’ (Strong, 1994) in evidence from the early 1990s, the article tracks the ‘intimate’ and ‘tactical’ aesthetics of a counter-colonial momentum.\n\nCommentators are unanimous about the important role of the UK in the 1970s in the history of popular music. Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, the Sex Pistols and the Police : perhaps no other country produced as many influential artistes in this decade. Yet there has generally been a separation between « serious » historical analyses of the decade’s social history and examinations of its musical legacy. This article attempts to look at the music in connection with the history of British society. What was changing about people’s relationship to music ? What were artistes proposing to consumers, as entertainment, as philosophical or political discourse or as aesthetic rebellion ?
