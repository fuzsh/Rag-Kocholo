        "text": "China is now the second most common domicile for students at Scottish universities, ahead of Edinburgh and every other Scottish council area bar Glasgow. More than one in 15 students is from China, according to the latest figures.\n\nOver the past eight years, the number of students from the rest of the world has increased by 65% while the number coming to Scotland from the rest of the UK has grown by 24%. The number of Scots studying in Scotland over that period has risen by a more modest 19%.\n\nThe figures undermine the claims by Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth that changes to UK immigration rules are \"harming\" Scottish universities and highlight the difficulty faced by many young Scots in getting one of the dwindling number of funded places in higher education.\n\nIn 2014/15, there were 232,570 students enrolled in Scottish universities and 152,925 of them were Scottish residents (66.2% of the total) with 50,105 from the rest of the world (21.5%) and 28,540 from the rest of the UK (12.3%). At that time, students from the EU (but not England, Wales or Northern Ireland) paid no tuition fees.\n\nREAD MORE: Jenny Gilruth rants about migration and calls UK Government 'opponents' when asked about cut in Scottish university students\n\nBy 2021/22, the student roll had grown to 301,230 including 183,030 Scottish residents (60.8% of the total), 82,710 from the rest of the world and (27.5%) and 35,490 from the rest of the UK (11.8%).\n\nEight years ago, the largest numbers were from Glasgow, Edinburgh, South Lanarkshire, Fife and North Lanarkshire respectively, followed by China in sixth place with 7595 students. However, by 2021/22, the number of Chinese students had grown by 174% to 20,830.\n\nChina appears well on course to become the most common domicile for Scottish universities, overtaking Glasgow – which had 22,395 students in the most recent figures. Indeed, if students from Hong Kong or Macau are taken into account the gap narrows to just a few hundred.\n\nIndia is now the seventh most common domicile, with 4595 students in Scottish universities in 21/22– an increase of 227% since 2014/15. The USA (6320 students, up 52% since 14/15), Nigeria (5620 students, up 206%) and Pakistan (3325 students, up 565%) have all seen big increases.\n\nEven after the SNP finally cut the funding for free tuition for EU residents – several years after Brexit would have allowed ministers to pull the plug – many Europeans are still paying full price to study in Scotland. Only Germany has seen a major reduction, down 30%, according to the figures from the Higher Education Statistics Authority.\n\nThere is no limit to what universities can charge students from overseas, with some courses costing in excess of £20,000 a year. Fees for those from the rest of the UK are capped at £9,250. Not surprisingly, the largest number come from Greater London with 6965 students from 'the Smoke' studying in Scotland in 21/22 (up 70%).\n\nWhere do students at Scottish universities come from?\n\n2014/15\n\nTotal student body\n\n232,570\n\nScotland\n\n153,925\n\n66.2%\n\nRest of UK\n\n28,540\n\n12.3%\n\nRest of world\n\n50,105\n\n21.5%\n\n2021/22\n\nTotal student body\n\n301,230\n\nScotland\n\n183,030\n\n60.7%\n\nRest of UK\n\n35,490\n\n11.8%\n\nRest of world\n\n82,710\n\n27.5%\n\nThe HESA figures represent the total number of students at Scottish universities and the 2022/23 figures have yet to be published. The Scottish Government said the latest data suggests the number of international students had now started to decline.\n\nA spokesman said: \"The latest UCAS data shows that 35,320 Scottish domiciled students were accepted to study at Scottish universities in 2023, which accounted for around 76% of all acceptances that year. This includes a record number of young people aged 19 and under. The Scottish Government welcomes international students and recognises the important and valuable contribution they make to our society, culture and economy.\n\n\"The number of international students being accepted at Scottish universities has decreased in recent years. The latest UCAS data shows a 7% decrease in non-EU acceptances between 2021 and 2023, while the number of EU students being accepted has fallen by 81% between 2016 and 2023.\""
