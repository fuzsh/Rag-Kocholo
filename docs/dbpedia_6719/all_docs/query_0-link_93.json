        "text": "A MEASURED INTELLECTUAL AND LEGAL RESPONSE TO THE PRO BREXIT COUP ATTEMPT OF AUGUST 2019\n\nPosted by in Uncategorized\n\n≈ 2 Comments\n\nColleagues are asking me for my response to the news that a small group of Privy councillors including Rees-Mogg, the arch brexiteer and ante-diluvian right-wing conservative financial profiteer from Brexit, have been with the soo called “Prime Minister” to Balmoral to demand that the Queen prorogue parliament and that the Queen has apparently given way and signed this into effect without blinking an eyelid. She has also apparently ignored a request from the Leader of the Opposition to hold a meeting. So what do I think ? What is my response, both legally and philosophically? Ok let me put you into the picture. Last year, in 2018, after campaigning against Brexit strongly for 2 years, I wrote to the Queen, finally, in frustration and told her that in my view, Brexit was an immoral, unethical and constitutionally unsound project which would lead to the break up of the UK. I expressed my view that the referendum of 2016 result ha been misinterpreted for reasons that are inexplicable and by interests who do not have the well being of the Uk at heart, in such a way that it will lead to the inevitable break up of the UK. I appealed to her as sovereign to resist the rush to brexit as her constitutional duty was to defend the realm, which meant that to ensure its continuation as a state came foremost before all else. She kindly had a correspondence secretary write back and tell me, that although she appreciated hearing my views, and had taken careful note of them, “as a constitutional sovereign, Her Majesty acts on the advice of Her Ministers and remains strongly non-political at all times”. I mulled over this response and watched events. Then when I saw that the Conservatives were continuing to act as if their interpretation of the outcome of the 2016 advisory referendum was the only permissible one, and as the BBC continued to give no air time to any effective opposition, and as parliament continued to be shackled, I then wrote again a long letter in which I made several points to her Majesty, even more specifically. Now I am putting into the public view this letter in full for the first time, on this same day August 28. St Augustines Day, 2019, as a result of her actions, which I regard as mistaken and unsound constitutionally. Here is the letter in full:\n\nINTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR PEACE STUDIES AND GLOBAL PHILOSOPHY\n\nDirector, Dr. Thomas Daffern B.A. (Hons) D.Sc. (Hon) Ph.D.\n\nFrench office: European Peace Museum, 13 Grande Rue, Betete, Limousin, 20270, France\n\nUK office: 213 Ham Road, Worthing, West Sussex, BN11 2QB\n\nEmail: iipsgp@educationaid.net websites: www.educationaid.net www.lulu.com/iipsgp https://thomascloughdaffern.wordpress.com/ http://musespress.wordpress.com/ http://daffernfamily.wordpress.com/ https://trcme.wordpress.com/ http://www.globalgreenuniversity.com/ https://ceppr.wordpress.com https://goldengateproject.wordpress.com https://interfaithpeacetreaty.wordpress.com https://multimediationservice.weebly.com https://europeanpeacemusaeon.weebly.com https://transpersonaltherapy.weebly.com/ Private email: thomasdaffern@gmail.com Facebook: International Institute of Peace Studies YouTube: IIPSGP1\n\nOctober 2018\n\nDear Queen Elizabeth 2nd,\n\nFurther to my previous letter of 28 June 2018, in which I warned of the likely consequences of Brexit and the break up of the UK with the secession of Scotland and the reunification of Ireland as an independent Republic, as well as the impoverishment and the people of the remaining England and Wales. You kindly replied in August and thanked me for expressing my views. I stated as follows:\n\n“It is my understanding that you have a constitutional duty as Monarch to defend the integrity of your realm. Your Privy Councillors have a sworn duty to protect Your Majesty from all enemies, foreign and domestic. I am writing to you not as a Privy Councillor but as a loyal subject, to warn you of the impending danger which I foresee for your kingdom.”\n\nI am forced to write again however because the Prime Minister shows no sign of listening to the facts of reality, she is ignoring the will of the House of Commons and the House of Lords (which is against either the Brexit deal she negotiated or a hard Brexit) and is doing her best to implement a falsely held and illegal engineered referendum which took place back in 2016 against the will of the vast majority of the people of the UK, and against the expressly declared will of the people of Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\nYou have told me in your letter that there is nothing you can do, and in effect that as a constitutional monarch you are duty bound to follow the instructions of the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons, who has the right to simply do whatever they want, and over-ride any views you may have yourself.\n\nWith all due respect I am myself duty bound to point out this is not strictly true.\n\nWe are all duty bound by our own consciousness, and by our loyalty to the cosmic codes of honour, duty and, truth and divine law, as have been all previous generations of human beings who have ever walked on earth.\n\nAll monarchs who have ever ruled are also duty bound to uphold the spiritual law in the light of which they themselves were anointed and rule, in your case, the spiritual laws of Christianity, which are based on love, as you so eloquently make the point year after year in your Christmas addresses to the Commonwealth.\n\nTo allow or permit your Prime Minister to wilfully implement a policy which is causing massive suffering to the people of the UK, including those many UK citizens who now live in Europe, as well as EU citizens who live in the UK – and to implement an ill thought out policy which will result in massive destabilisation to our nation, which will lead to the withdrawal of Scotland from the UK, which will lead to the people of Northern Ireland to leave the UK (although this will probably be accompanied by a resumption of violence) – is with all due respect going entirely contrary to your actual duties as a Queen. There is always an unwritten covenant between a monarch and his or her subjects, overseen by the Divine.\n\nI am writing to you as a loyal Anglican Christian layman, but also as an Archdruid, indeed the Archdruid of both the Uk and Europe when it comes to peace matters. My concern is that Theresa May’s actions are going to precipitate untold future violence on the UK, and that is what we must share a common commitment to preventing.\n\nYou can say to me, I have no authority to write to you, I am simply a citizen with no political power, and you must do what your prime minister tells you. But I would say that your right to rule as Monarch stems from the divine realms, and that whereas the British Isles have been a Christian land for nearly 2000 years, for approximately 10,000 years of settled habitation before that time, they were a pagan and Druid land, and thus I am writing with the authority of those accumulated 12,000 years of history, custom and law behind my words. I would beg you therefore to listen carefully.\n\nIn the ancient law of Britain, if a monarch acted against cosmic law, the Druid council had the duty to request them to resign and abdicate and to replace them with another monarch who could actually discern the cosmic law more properly.\n\nI had always thought you were a good and true monarch to your people, but in not standing up to this wilful, morally blind and future-ignorant Prime Minister (forgive my frankness, but I am duty bound to speak the truth) and the hard right wing of the Conservative party, you are dangerously close to colluding in an act of national vandalism that is frankly toxic to the future wellbeing of all your people and your own descendents. Do you not care about the impact this will have on the poor, the homeless, the less fortunate, the disabled, the unemployed ? Do you have no compassion, as monarch, for the horrendous backward step that leaving the EU will have for the rights of workers and all the less well off people in society ?\n\nIn ancient times, the greatest monarchs of all lands have always made it a habit to walk incognito amongst their subjects and to find out how they actually live, and what kinds of problems they were facing. I think it is time this custom was brought back into play. You of course would have to be in disguise since you are so well known !\n\nI am pleading with you whilst there is still time, to use your influence to try to persuade Theresa May to hold a second referendum, which is the only democratic fair and just way out of this constitutional crisis. It is not against your duty as monarch to ask her to do this, but on the contrary, it is directly and properly in your direct right and line of duty to ask her to do this. Your subjects would love you forever if this were to happen and breathe a huge sigh of relief. All the polls show that the UK would then not leave the EU after all, the economy would gradually restore itself and the lives of countless millions of people would be restored to their own sovereignty and happiness. A very small number of Brexit fanatics would be disappointed, but frankly they are not the sort of people one would want round for tea. And one should certainly not be afraid of such extremist types. That is why we have police and intelligence services and laws: to protect us from such people.\n\nThere is however another possibility here: it is just possible that you have yourself been persuaded, by advisers, friends, family, etc. that then Uk should indeed leave the EU as soon as possible, and that once we leave everything can then settle down and go back to normal – and that the people of Scotland will simply accept this, and the people of Northern Ireland can be made to accept it, if necessary by troops once more on the streets of Belfast. It is possible that it is your intention to force Brexit on the people of the UK and turn it into a personal loyalty conundrum – “if you are loyal to me as Queen then you must accept brexit, if not you are a traitor” etc. Is this possibly the case ? If so, then with all due respect I can only repeat that you have been catastrophically badly advised. The people of Scotland only very narrowly voted to remain in the UK, and largely only because they were told they would automatically be thrown out of the EU if they left the UK. Now this is reversed entirely. Likewise with the people of Northern Ireland.\n\nI would put it to you therefore that for your own good, as well as or your heirs and successors, you would be advised to do all you can to immediately prevent brexit happening, by advising your prime minister to hold a second referendum and to enact the necessary legislation at once to make this possible (including suspending article 50)..\n\nFinally, if you are convinced finally by the veracity of my word (and I swear on the throne of all the Gods and Goddesses that I am speaking 100% truthfully to you), then you have one last constitutional procedure open to you. You can threaten to the Prime Minister to abdicate rather than signing the final legislation to enable the Uk to leave the EU. You can say that in all conscience you cannot and will not tolerate this act to take place under your reign and therefore, you will abdicate unless she calls a second referendum. Finally, if she refuses to back down in private, then you can go public with this threat, and I believe that the vast mass of the British people will be supporting you in this brave and defiant act of common sense. Millions of ff people would surround Buckingham Palace to support you. We love you as our Queen, we love the Uk and we also love Europe and its European Union. We do not want to be tortured any more by the Brexit nightmare.\n\nYours truthfully, loyally and advisedly,\n\nDr Thomas Clough Daffern\n\nSo that was the letter I sent about a year ago. And her reply ? Nothing, zero. Not even a polite response, like I got to the last letter. And now this. It its beginning to look therefore to me that she has indeed decided to collude as much as possible in Brexit and to enable the hard-right coup to succeed. As she has ignored, blatantly and without even the courtesy of a reply. my moral and philosophical and constitutional advice. of course, I have no “power” in any formal political sense, but I do have the power of a clear conscience before God (Ulitmate Truth) and the power of having thought this through at the deepest possible level of analysis as a moral philosopher.\n\nI also believe that the Queen has been terribly badly advised that it is her duty to just do whatever Boris Johnson wants, and to sign into effect anything he deems appropriate. This is simply not the case. She has a duty as head of state to allow the commons to debate this matter in detail and see if a hard brexit, or any brexit, really is the will of parliament. To have intervened as she has done on the side of the hard brexiteers is a total usurpation of the rights of parliament, in my considered option, and to say otherwise is to distort the facts.\n\nHow have we got to this place, how has it been possible? think we cannot ignore the role of the media in this, including al the mass media of the Uk, such as the BBC, and al the television and print and on line media. Nearly all of them have since 2016 been driving home a relentless message that the “will of the people” is to leave the Eu adn this must be respected and implemented. This is a travesty. It was not the will of Scotland and not the will of Northern Ireland, and it was not the will of many other UK citizens. in fact the figures are as follows:\n\nThe majority of registered voters in fact, did not vote for this outcome in the Referendum in 2016: of all registered voters only 72% actually voted, meaning that 28% didn’t vote at all for whatever reason (an abstention is actually a vote for the status quo, which is to remain in the EU). Of those who did vote, 35% voted to remain, 36% voted to leave. This means that 64% of the total voters registered to vote in your kingdom did not vote to leave the EU. In addition, the majority of voters of Northern Ireland voted to remain in the European Union. The majority of voters of Scotland chose to remain in the European Union. The great majority of British citizens now want a second referendum of this most vital of political questions.\n\nThis accurate depiction of the 2016 referendum result is never given by the Uk media. Instead, it is endlessly repeated that the figures were 48% and 51% =- but this is a distortion of the facts as explained above,. The figures should be given as 35% voting to remain, and 36% voting to leave. but people have been literally brainwashed into thinking that 48% and 51% is factual. it is not, it is a distortion, that has been repeated so often, it has become “true”. the British people are known for their fairness and sense of justice, or at least they used to be, yet the way the 2016 was hijacked and misinterpreted by the Tory Party is so scandalous that it has forever brought that into question. The events of today just confirm this even further.\n\nAm I shocked at today’s events? Yes, of course. Am I suprised? I am not surprised that the Tory hard right coup leaders have gone to the Queen to ask them to prevent parliament from discussing Brexit properly. I am surprised that the Queen has so casually acquiesced to this request, and this has confirmed in me a growing sense of unease that she has now come down on the side of the Tory Brexit extremists, and has accepted their narrative of events, based on totally fake history. Why would she do this, a woman we assumed to be intelligent and morally sound? Each of us must draw our own conclusions about this. Perhaps the queen is not as morally intelligent as we thought, which is a bit of a shock to the Anglicans among us who assumed she was, or perhaps she has been blackmailed and leaned on by some nasty (offshore ?) intelligence agents who have compromising pictures of some of her relatives in strange sexual postures (perhaps her son Prince Andrew for instance, in connection with the Epstein case) and for her own domestic peace of mind, she is willing to do whatever is requested of her. This raises a profound constitutional question – if a monarch can indeed be blackmailed into committing acts of treason against her own subjects, at what point is it necessary to blow the whistle. What do honest patriots do at such a time ? in John Locke’s political philosophy, if a monarchy commits acts of treason against the well being of the peoples of a given country, then those people have the right to rebellion and to disavow loyalty to such a treasonous monarch. Why ? Because obedience to the laws of morality superseded all other mere legalisms, according to the philosophical tradition that John Locke represented, which was the very foundation of modern notions of human rights. His ideas were taken up by all subsequent revolutionary attempts, including the Americain revolution, and its premise that giovernemnt6 is instituted in order to preserve the freedom, liberties and happiness of the people in general. Leaving the EU is so grossly undercutting this compact, this unwritten law of our basic constitution as a country, that the entire edifice of the constitutional monarchy on which we thought our country was based, has now to be called into question. So if John Locke was right and we have a right to rebel and withdrawn obedience from a corrupt and compromised feudal hierarchical system, that has today declared war against the well being of its own people, in what form should that rebellion manifest? In my opinion it should take the form first and foremost of intellectual dissent, and truth seeking. Gandhi called active nonviolence resistance to oppression, the force of satyagraha. The people of the UK, all of us, the millions who voted to remain and the millions who have now decided remain is indeed in the best interests of the happiness of the vast majority of UK citizens, all have a duty to hold onto truth, and not allow the poisonous discourse of the extreme right, led by Johnson, Cummings, Farage, Bannon, Rees-Mogg, and yes, in her own way Queen Eliaebrth, it now seems – to disallow our right to our own knowledge, our own mind and our own conscience. Ultimately, as I have said in many of my philosophical works, especially my epic Being and Knowledge, the most important right of all, the one that underlies all others, is the right to wisdom. It isn’t a given and it is isn’t easy, like the right to enlightenment – we have to claim it. Kant said that we have to dare to be wise.. This is the foundation of the entire liberal democratic and social democratic and indeed Christian democratic tradition that underlies modern political thought. This has now been kicked in the teeth by an outdated feudal extreme right-wing idea of royal prerogative which is more outdated than Heath Robinson’s idea of a pop-up toaster made with rubber bands and balsa wood.\n\nSorry ma’am, but you’ve got this one wrong, and it might have incalculable consequences.\n\nPlease do write back and reply to my letter of last year, and let’s have a philosophical dialogue about ultimate truth, and its political implications, before its too late…\n\nSOME PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHTS ON PARLIAMENT AND THE KARMA OF BREXIT FROM A TRANSPERSONAL HISTORY PERSPECTIVE\n\nPosted by in Uncategorized\n\n≈ 3 Comments\n\n(The photo shows the author going to a meeting he was co-chairing in the House of Lords on ethics and peace policy, in 1993)\n\nMany of us are perplexed, angry and hurt about the antics of the UK House of Commons and its apparent inability to do the right thing, which all right thinking rational and ethically good people realise has to be done about brexit – namely hold a second referendum to consult again the will of the British people over the entire brexit fiasco.\n\nWe now know that the Brexit 2016 referendum was a con from beginning to end. Cameron did not set a proper limit to the number of votes needed to change the status quo, which is unheard of in referenda of this kind. Was he not intelligent enough to think it through ?\n\nSecondly, the vote leave and Leave EU parties running the leave campaign both broke the law and cheated considerably, yet apart from being fined, nothing has happened. The courts ruled that since the referendum was advisory only, it was not something that could be annulled. This is false legal reasoning if ever there was. It opens the way to prosecuting Theresa May and her cronies for then interpreting the result as if it was legally binding, when in fact it wasn’t, and someone is now doing just that.\n\nThirdly, this fiasco is all resulting from Theresa May’s triggering of Article 50 when the referendum had been only advisory, and being helped in this process by a whole bunch of supine MP’s who didn’t know what they were doing. Labour and Corbyn are as guilty as anyone else here. Only the SNP and the Liberal Democrats adn greens and a few others opposed this move, and have been consistent in their opposition throughout.\n\nThe Labour Party is also complicit in this entire fiasco, since under Jeremy Corbyn, who seems to have problems with integrity and intellectual clarity, he has been a secret closet Brexiteer all along, as witnessed in his disastrous refusal, to let his MP’s vote in favour of a second referendum last week. He seems to think it is more important to spend time on his allotment or to defend himself yet again for the millionth time against the charge against being “anti semitic”, than actually acting as the leader of the opposition and bringing the brexit process crashing down. A Labour leader of the calibre of the late John Smith, would long ago have brought brexit crashing to its knees, by getting together with all sensible opposition to it, all the SNP, all of the Liberal Democrats, moderate and right-thinking conservatives, and even Sinn Fein across the water (who could have come to parliament for a one off vote at his request to bring the Brexit project down in the interests of all the people of Ireland and the UK) and yet – instead, he has been colluding within the Tory led Brexit machine like Marshall Petain in the Nazi occupation of France.\n\nFinally, he is rumoured to be thinking of stepping down, but it is too little too late. If he can swop places with Sir Keir Starmer immediately – and Keir becomes Labour leader and Jeremy deputy leader, we might finally get some actual opposition to brexit in the Labour ranks. This should happen today !!! but I suspect it wont. They will have to drag Jeremy off in a white coat. He is going against labour Party policy which is now to call for a second referendum – and is in complete defiance of the entire Labour Party except a few hard line Brexiteers.\n\nBut the Tory Brexit machinery led by the ERG and the hard right, now annoyed that their plan to steam roller brexit through on a third vote has been blocked by the speaker, are determined to just have a short extension and then crash out with a hard brexit anyway. Or to try to bring some kind of amended Theresa May deal before the house, after trying no doubt to get rid of the speaker and overruling or replacing him. They will no doubt try a “vote of no-confidence in the speaker” which will fail, and then might try to find some arcane legislation to accuse him of “blocking government policy” and having him unseated. They might try having him declared insane and dragged from his chair by medics. They might, if all else fails, have him assassinated. Or they might do something very clever. Maybe they can activate their long term CIA asset namely Donald Tusk, and demand he make such a ridiculous and unreasonable demand of the UK for an extension (to pass the Theresa May deal) even thought the Speaker has ruled it out, that it will miraculous galvanise the nation against eh EU and lead to a happy hard brexit after all. Brilliant move.. Its a serious point – are EU officials vetted for members of foreign intelligence agencies ? Are UK officials ? I thought I could trust Mr Tusk, and then he goes and does something that stupid which is bound to annoy every right thinking UK citizen who had hitherto been trying to get the UK to remain in teh EU. I mean, that has to be a set up, right ? Or it could be fake news ?\n\nThese are dangerous times. Bring back the inquisition anyone ?\n\nI want to observe something about the very nature of parliament and ask, as a transpersonal historian, if this is one of the reasons we are seeing that Westminster seems to be incapable of doing the right thing. Why is it descending into a nest of vipers, factions jockeying for power, where the voices of the good are being drowned out by the wicked and the evil.\n\nMake no mistake about my position, I am, as Labour MP from East Lothian, Rt Hon,. Pat Macfadden said recently in debate, a “Hard Remainer” – I know the damage Brexit has already done to our country, and will do far worse once implemented.\n\nI am appalled that our so called government cannot see this, and continue to go along into the abyss without a care in the world. But then it is run by disaster capitalists for disaster capitalist, and has been aided and abetted by a disaster socialist who has left his brain down on the allotment.\n\nTheresa May is to me the very embodiment of ignorance and folly embodied in a form that you would not expect it from. When I met her and we chatted I thought she was rather intelligent and rather nice, so my fury at her brexit policies is also matched and amplified by personal disappointment. I feel it personally, as if one of my old friends has been found out lying about me behind my back, and doing the complete opposite of what she said she would. You know the type ? It leaves and deeply unpleasant taste in one’s mouth and a feeling of nausea in the pit of once stomach. This woman makes mendacity into a professional craft.\n\nShe has one way of redeeming this situation. She should immediately sack all the hard brexiteers in her cabinet. Announce a total U turn. Replace them with soft remainers. And announce a second referendum, to be accompanied by, on the same day, a general elections, three months from today. She should ask for an extension from the EU for one year to allow that result to be followed up and whoever wins the General election can them implement the result of the second referendum. That’s fair. That’s honourable. She should announce that tonight and see off her hard Brexiteer tormenters. If they refuse to shut up then they can leave the Tory party and join UKIP. She should bring Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve into her cabinet instead of Andrea Leadsom and her hard cronies.\n\nSadly however she doesn’t have the intelligence to see this is the right thing to do. She continues to bleat on about implementing the will of the 2016 referendum as if it were some kind of divine mandate. She ignores, totally, wilfully, ignorantly, the fact that the 2016 referendum was illegally run and gerrymandered. She says it will cause a lack of belief in democracy if the referendum is rerun, without realising that it is the total opposite of the truth. Not to have a second referendum is itself to destroy any trust in democracy. The voters have the right to change their minds. And the majority of UK citizens never voted for brexit at all, and the people of Scotland and Northern Ireland didn’t at all. So her narrative is entirely mendacious, selective and deceitful. We need to march on March 23 in our millions to insist on a second referendum. We have to take to the streets now to shake the arrogance of this disdainful and anti democratic and anti-intellectual figure.\n\nTo help this process, I want to offer here some historical reflections, as a historian, (of joint UK and Canadian dual citizenship), living in France and directing the International Institute of Peace Studies and Global Philosophy which was founded at the University of London back in 1991. My opposition to Brexit is based on a profound study of peace options for Europe and the UK, and an intensive study of European, British and world history for the last 500 years, and a conviction that the formation and development of the European Union is a vital peace project that the UK would be very unwise to abandon at this point in history.\n\nI think the majority of UK voters have also now come to a similar conclusion, having seen what brexit is doing to our nation, how it is very likely to leave us considerably poorer and how also it is 100% certain to see the rupture of Scotland from there UK, as the Scots never voted to leave the EU int eh first place. The mistreatment of Scotland’s voice by the Theresa May government has been constitutionally disgraceful, and I cannot blame the Scots for continuously stating that if brexit goes ahead they will leave the UK.\n\nWhat I cannot comprehend is why is parliament so rude to them ? What is the matter with the Tory MP’s that they cannot seem to understand English ? Is it the Scottish accent they cannot comprehend ? Have they got such contempt and hatred and ignorance for their Scottish brethren that they are daring them or bluffing them ? Do they think they will be able to prevent Scottish independence on legalistic grounds for ever and a day, even after brexit and therefore have no care to listen to the warning from the SNP in parliament, which represent the great majority of the Scottish people after all ? The UK parliament is rapidly losing its right to be the UK parliament, and when Scotland leaves the UK, it will no longer be so.\n\nLikewise, on the matter of Ireland, there is complete ignorance and disdain being shown by the government to the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland who likewise did not vote to leave the EU. But by making a cynical pact with the DUP, they are trying to implement Brexit over the heads of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland and without consent. It is likely this policy will totally backfire and we will see a successful second referendum fought, on the basis of the Good Friday agreement, in which the majority of the people of Northern Ireland will vote to rejoin the republic in a united Ireland. The Tory brexit will have brought this about. That much is historically certain. But there will probably be a resumption of fighting and bombing and killing in Northern Ireland before it happens. As Chair of the truth and Reconciliation Commission for Ireland and Britain, this is yet another reason why I believe brexit should be rejected by all right thinking and intelligent parliamentarians as the toxic and poisonous sludge it is, every bit as unpalatable as the radioactive sludge the government is dumping into the Irish sea without approval of Ireland and against all international environmental standards. This is precisely the sort of thing the European Union exists to prevent happening, another reason why this nuclear addicted government wants to get out of the EU which provides an extra layer environmental legal protection for the people of Europe.\n\nThis environmental reason for remain is yet another strong argument in favour of the EU, and Caroline Lucas, the sole voice of the green movement in parliament, has spoken up tirelessly against brexit and continues to do so, as she knows the negative impact brexit will have on our environmental standards as a nation. In a parliamentary system based on proportional representation the green party would have far more MP’s than it does now, and their voice would be listened to more intently.\n\nBut is the house of commons somehow congenitally unable to do the right thing ? How sound a place is this House of Commons that now claims the right to destroy our friendly relations with the EU after decades of mutual congress and well being ?\n\nI have as a professional historian made it my business to find out what I can about the history of the commons as an institution. Since living in France I have discovered some interesting facts which shed a new and interesting light on why the commons seems unable to do the right thing.\n\nIt was the brainchild of Simon V de Montfort (1208 – 4 August 1265) who was also the Earl of Leicester, and whose father Simon IV de Montfort (c. 1175 – 25 June 1218) was the most brutal and ruthless and disgraceful thug of a crusading type that went against every single law of mediaeval chivalry in his ruthless campaign of extermination against the Cathars of South Western France.\n\nLast year I help organise the Mary Magdalene conference in Betete, and Alet les Bains and visited the site of Montsegur and other Cathar places and researched deeply the story of Simon V de Montfort and his campaign of mass killings against simply honest people that he waged from 1206-2017. These are things we are never taught in UK schools about the lineage of the “founder of English democracy”.\n\nThis elder Simon de Montfort was a total fanatic, and reminds me of the worst kind of Brexiteer. There was no arguing with him, he was outwardly courteous, but behind your back was planning for destruction and massacre. If he was reborn now he would definitely be in Theresa May’s Cabinet.\n\nThis first phase of the Cathar crusade lasted from 1209-1215 and including such horrific episodes as the cruelty at Bram. At Bram, Simon de Montfort decided to terrorise the Cathars of the town he had captured, called Bram, near to Carcassonne, so he chose 100 men at random, some Catholics as well as Cathars, and had their eyes gouged out, their lips cut of and their noises sliced off, and sent them in a horrible mutilated column with the leading victim, allowed to retain one eye in order to lead them, and sent them walking to another Cathar town to warn the inhabitants to surrender straight away.\n\nSimon de Montfort was himself very anti semitic, which is to say he hated Jews. He hated them on religious grounds as well as racial and political grounds. One of the facts about the Cathars is that they were philo=-semitic. So his rage against the Cathars was partly explained by this, and so was that of his son, Simon V de Montfort (1208 – 4 August 1265) the founder of the English House of Commons. I have never quite gotten over the sneaking suspicion that for the De Montforts and their anti-esoteric crusades, when they talk about democracy they actually mean “mobocracy”. The de Montfort’s were also always both complaining above all against Jewish moneylenders who they regarded as the devils incarnate. Funny how the word anti-Semite is always hovering in the air in the House of Commons, isn’t it ?\n\nNow from the standpoint of transpersonal history, which is the particular field of history I am interested in, this tells us a lot. Transpersonal history studies the long term karmic cycles of events. It analyses how karmic cycles can recur over long intervals, and how reincarnational possibility becomes worked out as people’s karma is enacted and perfected life after life, and in a different historical context. As a field of history it is still in its infancy, and at what could be called a “pre-scientific” phase, drawing on authors such as Jung, Marx, Wilber, Steiner, Assagioli, Toynbee, Sorokin, and many others. I have written a PhD thesis on the transpersonal history of the period from 1945-2001 and have published over 35 books with some bearing on these complex matters. I have tried to interpret Biblical, Koranic and Enochian, and now also Marxist literature from the standpoint of transpersonal history, for one thing.\n\nSo from the standing of transpersonal history what can we say about brexit and the chaos in parliament ?\n\nThat the house of commons is a nasty and unpleasant place, in which truth speaking is not required, and indeed mendacity and lies seem to be the order of the day – and it was founded by an anti-semitic thug who hated intellectuals and the refinements of philosophy, preferring the sword as the way of doing business. He hated esoteric Christians or anyone who tried to follow the inner light of Christ and he hated the idea of the equality of men and women in seeking the peace of Christ in a open handed and open hearted free spirited kind of way. He was contemptuous of spirituality seekers of wisdom period. Sound familiar ?\n\nSince it was founded, parliament has done many other deeds of utter folly: in the English civil war period, it got embroiled in war against the Christian Anglican king and his followers (called royalists) which was totally unnecessary. It sent Cromwell into Ireland to ravage and destroy its ancient culture, and to murder priests and burn monasteries and their precious libraries. Its ignorant attitude to Ireland goes a very long way back indeed. Its cruelty to Scotland is also a matter of record. It permitted the clearances of hte highlands when people’s lives and homes were destroyed to make room for sheep. It outlawed the Scottish culture of the highlands and persecuted the Jacobites ruthlessly, and was behind the massacre of Glencoe. It thought it did a very clever thing by shutting down the Scottish parliament and then muzzling Scottish voices ever since. It has sent spies into Scotland to stifle any independent thinking ever since and as we now know, it sent its secret agents to report on the working of the SNP ever since it was founded. No doubt it is still doing the same.. Yawn..\n\nIt legislated further anti Semitic acts and expelled all Jews from England, and regarded all this as right and proper., adn only reluctantly let them back because it thought they would bring some money with them, not because it was the right thing to do. It also legalised and legislated or Slavery for several hundred years, and persecuted Indian independence fighters who were using non-violence under Gandhi with long stays in prison. It sanctioned the killings of Indian protestors such as at Amritsar by never punishing the army officer responsible. It very possibly colluded in launching world war one unnecessarily because it was going along with an elaborate trap devised by UK intelligence to embroil Germany in a world war, against its will, adn then had the gall to blame the Kaiser for everything afterwards, as two Scottish historians have recently discovered. World Wear one was declared without even a vote in parliament being allowed beforehand.\n\nThe House of common also condemned the Quakers to extreme forms of punishment for daring to speak truth to power, and asking for the right to worship in silent prayerfulness, and to refrain from killing, The first sincere Christian pacifists, they were persecuted by parliamentary legislation and many of them imprisoned and punished harshly and most cruelly. One of their greatest poets, James Naylor, has a red hot poker pushed through his tongue, on order of the House of Commons, for daring to speak words of visionary spirituality. You are not allowed to speak that truth to parliament from a spiritual place of enlightenment, as Naylor did, or you get a red hot poker through your tongue, literally. I see shades of Simon de Montfort’s treatment of the Cathars however over this bestial act.\n\nThe House of Commons also enacted countless acts and bills against the witches and wise folk, or cunning folk of England, and they were hung, drowned and burned at every opportunity, especially by the extreme parliamentarians of the Puritan period, because they and their Witchfinder generals literally believed the devil was amidst them and had to be burned out by torture and cruelly. All this brutality was sanctioned by the house of commons and bills duly passed to make it legal. Again, I see shades of the anti Cathar persecutions, for it was out of Simon de Montfort’s brutality against the Cathars that the Inquisition was invented in European history. For the first time the idea arose in the mind of man that it was better to torture and kill devout souls because they believed in a more spiritual or esoteric form of Christianity than you did, and by killing them, you are actually doing them and yourselves a favour. I see shades of the Nazi holocaust in the inquisition, and indeed, there are direct lines of intellectual descent from the Nazi persecution of the Jews and their extreme anti Semitism, and the inquisitional persecution of the Cathars. The same inquisitional apparatus that was invented to fight the Cathars was soon unleashed against he Jews adn Moos of Spain. Benjamin Netanyahu’s father, a historian, wrote the standard history of the work of this inquisition, but left out its original against the Cathars. This explains also why Netanyahu doesn’t quite know what is going on either.. he doesn’t realise that his mistreatment of the Palestinians is exactly what the Inquisition did to the Cathars.\n\nSo is it any wonder, I muse, as a transpersonal historian, that extreme right wing, anti semitic and neo-Nazi forces are now rallying behind Brexit as a cause worth using every trick they can think of to coerce on the British people and the good people of Scotland, Wales and Ireland, regardless of consequences ?\n\nThis is the same thought world as Brandon Tarrant who opened fire on innocent New Zealand Muslim worshippers and shot 49 of them in cold blood – in the name of white racism, Donald Trumpism and the right to brexit against all the universe. His manifesto proudly proclaims his allegiance to exactly ht same far right racism that underlies Trumps desire to build a wall against Mexico, and the brexiteers hatred of the openness, the liberalism, the freedom of movement, the sane social and Christian democratic decency, of the institutions of the European Union.\n\nSo where does that leave us now, on March 20 ? We should march on Saturday 23 March and demand a second referendum, a peoples vote. If 5 million people come out in to the streets it can show the sinister and dark forces that have attempted a coup against our democracy and our membership of the European Union, that we will not let them get away with it.\n\nAm I saying that parliament is a dark and sinister force and we should bypass it ? Not exactly. I am saying that parliament and specifically the commons does have a dark past, and that it behoves us to learn about that and understand it. I am saying it has been a nest of vipers and liars and puritanical and arrogant schemers since it was first born in the light of day.\n\nI am saying that the UK parliament in Westminster needs reforming in ways to make it genuinely more democratic and a system of proportional representation needs to come in whereby the number of MP’s in any given party are exactly proportional to the number of votes cast for the that party in any given general election. The current system is utterly corrupt and outdated. This idea to gradually reform parliament and make it properly modern and democratic is what the Liberal Democrats are proposing. They are also 100% opposing Brexit so they speak for me in Parliament at this time and they speak for common sense and wisdom in our political culture.\n\nI am saying the parliament should rescind, revoke and delay the article 50 process and do so for long enough to hold a second referendum on this whole matter. And also, following that, or perhaps before it, to hold a general election. We will need perhaps 2 years to do both these things. Then we will know exactly where we stand on Europe, and if as I hope, the majority decide to vote in favour of Remain next time, we will all be a great deal happier and economically and psychologically more secure.\n\nFor the second referendum however, the terms should be changed. There must be a threshold set. All voters over 16 should get to vote, and strict policing should prevent outside interference by foreign countries such as the USA or Russia, or any other country that might get involved in the referendum. Our our intelligence agencies should work to prevent all outside interference. And every intelligence office should be required to swear an oath of political neutrality on the outcome and promise not to interfere one way or another. Groups and individuals found to have broken the law during the last referendum should be disqualified from taking part (like Aron Banks et al).\n\nThis time there should be a clean contest between honourable parties.\n\nIs this going to happen ? Well, I am a philosopher and a theologian and historian, and a peace scientist and future studies expert, and I can say one thing confidently – if this route is not chosen, and brexit is forced down all our throats without a second referendum, then you can kiss goodbye to the UK, and probably to the Monarchy which will not survive its break up. You can say hello to decades of uncertainty, growing poverty, chaos and conflict, as lawyers and politicians fight over what used ot be a great and glorious country, the United Kingdom of great Britain and Northern Ireland, living in harmony with its neighbours and was a proud and upstanding member of the European Union. You can say goodbye to all that, and I for one, am not prepared to watch this country of ours, go down without a serious struggle for truth and justice, love and wisdom. As coordinator of Philosophers for Historians for Peace, and Director of IIPSGP in the UK and Europe you would expect nothing less from me, surely ?\n\nPROLEGOMENA TO A HISTORY OF 9/11: 9/11, BREXIT AND THE UK – JOINING UP THE DOTS\n\nPosted by in Uncategorized\n\n≈ 3 Comments\n\nHaving just recently returned from a whistle-stop visit to the U.K during which I gave two lectures on the Metaphysics of Brexit, called THE KARMA OF BREXIT: A THEOSOPHICAL AND TRANSPERSONAL PERSPECTIVE, I have now returned to France to continue my work as Director of the European Peace Museum and to reflect on what we are living through in contemporary history.\n\nToday, January 24 I have now finally published the fruit of some 3 years solid work, namely my history of the events of 9/11 and their possible causes, and proven consequences.\n\nSince 9/11 we have had a continual series of international geopolitical disasters, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the destabilisation of that country, the destabilisation (attempted) of Syria by the same UK/USA military alliance which invaded Iraq, and unleashed the extremist Islamic jihadis who formed ISIS and other Sunnite groups.\n\nIn my book on 9/11 I do not give a definite answer as to who was behind 9/11 but I do give 15 hypothesis as to whom might have been involved. One thing I am certain of, from years of study and research, that the official Bush narrative, that 9/11 was caused by 19 Al Qaeda agents acting along under the command of Ossama Bin Laden, was simply not true. In other words, it was a lie – but if so then was it deliberate, and who concealed it – who concocted these layers of deception ? That question is at the heart of this book. The answer to it will also implicate whoever was involved in the actual plot behind 9/11 namely the pre-wiring of the buildings at the Twin towers.\n\nI trained in my historical research at the University of London and ended up specialising in modern and contemporary history, so I have brought all my forensic skills as a contemporary historian to bear on the questions confronted in the book – who caused 9/11, why, and for what purposes. Other writers have tackled these questions before, and have come up with a variety of answers (Mossad did 9/11, the CIA did it, Saudi Intelligence did it, China did it, Iran or Iraq did it, UK intelligence was somehow involved, aliens and Dracos who are colonising our planet did it) and so on and on. I examine all these hypothesis, and more, from the most probable to the least probable, and suspend judgment on their veracity while examining the evidence. The one thing we can all agree on – somebody must have done it ! This is the first time that any trained historian has actually tackled this huge and complex subject.\n\nAnother thing I should add – in the last couple of years I have been developing a new field of religious studies called Comparative Diabology. I have been writing and lecturing on the whole complex history of what or who the “devils” are in different religious and philosophical traditions – and how should we understand them ? Extraterrestrials of very nasty mien ? Psychological shadows we all carry within us ? Fallen angels from a primordial paradise who dared top challenge the top God ? Every faith, and sub denomination within the faiths, has their own take on the Devil story. One thing I believe strongly, and that this book explores, is that however and whatever the devil actually may or may not be, then that same force was certainly behind 9/11, psychologically at least. So this book is also an exorcism, a confrontation, a calling out. In the Mary Magdalene Studies Association that we have launched here in France, we have learned, at our recent two annual conferences so far in 2017 and 2018, that Mary and Jesus were brave and fearless when it came to exorcising negative and demonic forces. So should we learn to be as historians, which is part of the point of “transpersonal history”. If you lack courage as a historian, stick to the history of cricket or something, if you are fearless, join me in studying the history of 9/11. As the quote says on the floor of the Cathedral of St John the Divine in Manhattan, the mother church of the entire Anglican Communion worldwide: “The truth Shall Set You Free”\n\nIt is a fact that the time-line of my PhD thesis covered the Intellectual history of the search for peace from 1945-2001, and it stopped exactly at 9/11. So it is perhaps also appropriate that I should, of all historians, be the one to take up the pen again to examine the complex history of the post 9/11 world and our search for answers to the riddles of 9/11.\n\nThe reason I have devoted some 3 years of my research time to this work, is because I think it is the single most important issue that historians need to solve, to answer the simple question: – who actually caused 9/11 to unfold as it did, and why ? Who commanded and ordered this operation ? Why has no one been put properly on trial as yet ? Why has no one been brought to justice over this ? Why was all the forensic evidence from the site removed so quickly after the explosions ?\n\nThe book is nearly 400 pages in length, as you would expect from a detailed coverage of such an important subject, and I hope it will be read by fellow historians around the world, but also by the general public, to begin with in the English speaking world. The book is dedicated to “everyone on planet earth who has ever wondered, if only fleetingly, whether the official narrative of the events of 9/11, which were soon marshalled into giving some kind of legitimacy or excuse for the tragic and needless invasion of Iraq in 2003 by the USA and UK, with incalculable subsequent consequences in terms of the destabilisation of the Islamic and Middle Eastern world, was actually founded on veracity or not ? It’s a work of historical research in greater depth and more sustained analysis on this topic than has hitherto been attempted and is the first such study by a professional academic historian to ask these questions in any sustained and comprehensive manner. This book is also dedicated as an homage to all those amazing historians who were part of my own intellectual training at the University of London, and whose lectures and seminars I have attended over the years, or who worked in previous decades and helped make history a recognise pursuit for genuine academics worldwide.” But perhaps most importantly, the book is dedicated to the memory of the lives of all those who died on 9/11 in the USA, as well as those who died subsequently in the Middle Eastern wars which were triggered following those tragic events, including the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the subsequent civil wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and elsewhere. Whoever was responsible for 9/11 seems to enjoy warfare and killing and does not take much joy in actually causing peace, and this is why I am determined to track down who was responsible for 9/11 and the subsequent wars and mayhem in the Middle East, as well as the victims of terrorism that have over spilled into other regions, including above all Europe, where a million refugees have fled the destabilisation of the middle east especially in Syria.\n\nThe book is also dedicated to Ahmad Shah Massoud, who was a brave general of the anti-Taliban forces trying to keep Afghanistan in the 21st century, yet who was assassinated in a complex plot, having all the hallmarks of an international covert intelligence attack, 2 days before the events of 9/11 unfolded.\n\nI knew people who were close to Ahmad Shah Massoud, and also met his brother, in 1997, when he was the then Afghan Ambassador to the UK, when I went to the Afghan Embassy for peace mediation talks having just set up my Multifaith and Multicultural Mediation Service (MMMS) whose history I subsequently recounted as part of my PHD thesis, and which still remains the only specialised mediation service dealing with interfaith conflict resolution. 18 years after 9/11 we still have civil war raging in Afghanistan, with tens of thousands having died in the interval since then, and no lasting peace in sight, and so this book is also dedicated to the all the Afghans who have died since 9/11, largely blamed by international opinion for events that may well have not been plotted exclusively or even mainly on their terrain. One thing is certain – that whoever killed Ahmad Shah Massoud, was also responsible for the events of 9/11 themselves, and I therefore address these puzzles in this complex and detailed historical study.\n\nBut this book is not the final word on the subject, on the contrary, it is the first word. It is a Prolegomena. It is the first time that the subject of 9/11 has been properly tackled in any shape or form by a trained historian. History however is a collaborative project, and just as in the work of mediaeval chroniclers sitting in their mediaeval abbeys, who relied on distant works by chroniclers and historians they had never met, to construct their narratives of history, and to join up all the pieces of the broken jagged edges of time, so too, to realise and comprehensively answer the historical questions in depth about who or what was responsible for 9/11 and with what purposes and motivations and with what ends and consequences, will be the work of many other present and future historians. I am simply an intellectual scout venturing into new territory that has not been covered before in any depth.\n\nIt is a simple fact that the topic has never been covered in any of the mainstream historical journals in the English speaking world, nor have any conferences or seminars been held at the most prestigious of our historical institutions, such as the School of History (University of London), or events organised by the Royal Historical Society, or the American Historical Association, nor even the World Conference of Historical Sciences (which meets every 5 years) and is due to meet in 2019 in Poland, where I hope to be presenting this work.\n\nAnd so we come to Brexit – readers of this blog will have noticed over recent months my absolute determination to expose the intellectual weakness and ignorance of Brexit as a policy decision for the future stability and well being of the UK. It will make everyone poorer in the UK apart from a few very rich disaster capitalists who will stand to gain, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and his type. I have published the only in depth Journal going into all aspects of the Brexit arguments, for and against, which is available here: http://www.lulu.com/shop/dr-thomas-clough-daffern/iipsgp-anti-brexit-and-pro-european-union-newsletter/paperback/product-23851836.html\n\nIn my recent talks in the UK I reminded listeners how the process of Brexit seems calculated to cause maximum self-harm to the UK and to lead to its demise as a great power. It will lead to a return to fighting on the streets of Belfast, and the eventual reunification of Ireland as the North of Ireland rejects Brexit and chooses instead to rejoin the Republic of Ireland and remain in the EU. It will lead to the separation of Scotland from the UK, as that proud nation also rejects brexit, and chooses instead a path of peace, social justice and social democracy, far more in tune with its own culture and intellectual history that the disaster capitalism that the Brexiteer Tories stand for. All this I foresee if brexit cannot be stopped in the remaining few weeks available to us. It is even possible that if Parliament actually legislates against a hard brexit, the Tory government extremist Brexiteers might try to do a coup and suspend parliament anyway, as Jacob Rees Mogg is advocating, like a being from another planet.\n\nBut what is the connection, if any, between Brexit and the events of 9/11 – is there any ? Will future historians shake their heads in disbelief that no one saw it at the time ? I suspend judgment, but all I will say here and now, is that the evidence is quite strong that whatever forces were behind 9/11 are also the same forces, in a similar or even identical combination, to the forces behind Brexit – and by that I mean the groups of shadowy operatives who use internet stalking, trolling, ghosting, false news, and all the other dark-arts that have been developed in covert intelligence circles in recent years. I am at least 90% certain that whoever was paying for and operating these dark arts to ensure a victory for the leave campaign, was also, at the uppermost chain of command, in the know about who had been responsible of the events of 9/11.\n\nBut how is that possible, you might ask – surely somebody by now would have blown the whistle ? Surely somebody would have exposed this massive conspiracy and called out the people who seem to be responsible ?\n\nWell, for historical reasons that readers of my autobiography might be able to work out, it has fallen to me to be the one to blow the whistle. You will understand more when you have read this my history of 9/11, which also gives something of my own personal reasons for writing the book.\n\nI would also like to state that if you thought the negative consequences of 9/11 were bad, the negative consequences of Brexit in the long run are also going to be bad, and on something approaching the same magnitude.\n\nAnd I can let the reader into a secret in advance: whoever was responsible for 9/11 was certainly not a European nation – it was not Belgium, France, Germany, Holland, Luxemburg, Greece, Estonia, Latvia, Ireland or any of the other nations of the European Union, with the sole possible exception of the UK, who may well have had advanced warning of 9/11 in their uppermost intelligence and political circles. I address this hypothesis, along with all the others, in the course of the book. (Of course I might be wrong, it could have been Slovenia !)\n\nThere is also as strange karmic twist – if someone(s) at the very pinnacle of UK intelligence and policy knew 9/11 was an at least partially false flag event, and yet authorized the invasion of Iraq in 2003, thus showing incredible arrogance and hubris and disregard for truth, then the karmic pay back for this action might well be the unraveling of the UK itself post brexit – which is really Gods way of showing that the rules of Karmic justice still prevail. The UK has for too long gone about destroying, subverting and meddling in the lives of other nations – now it is about to meddle in its own affairs to its own self-destruction, perhaps. How ironic ! (But of course, this is simply theory at this stage of play).\n\nBut ultimately this is not book written by one person. I have read through and studied virtually every single book previously written about 9/11 from a variety of perspectives, and have given a critical analysis of their contents in my own work. A huge literature review takes up over 100 pages of the current work, as you would expect in an academic historical study.\n\nBut it is only a beginning, which is why it is entitled PROLEGOMENA TO A HISTORY OF 9/11 – I have taken my cue from Kant here, in his Prolegomena To Any Future Metaphysic, (In the original German: Prolegomena zu einer jeden künftigen Metaphysik, die als Wissenschaft wird auftreten können) meaning that he was trying to point out certain common and fundamental problems which any future metaphysical theory after his day, would have to address.\n\nSo too in this work, I am merely writing a ground work so to speak, pointing out what terrain the work of future historians will have to cover, if we are to get a comprehensive, accurate and true version of the history of 9/11, as to who was actually behind it, and therefore why it happened. This obviously has huge implications for current policy in the Middle East, both among Middle Eastern nations themselves, but also for the whole of Europe and the USA and other nations worldwide.\n\nThe work also has huge implications for international organisations such as the United Nations, the European Union, the British Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Independent States (former USSR nations) and so on and in our common search for a peace policy as a global community of nations and inter-nations. The work also has significance for the various arms of the world federalist movement, and wherever people are trying to struggle towards some kind of global ethical world order. If elites within nations or intelligence services can conspire together to pull off events such as 9/11, then it means truly that the world’s ethical world-order activists are going to have one hell of an enormous struggle on their hands to challenge these dark War-Lords and their lackeys.\n\nThe subtitle of the work is TOWARDS A HISTORICAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO 9/11 and here is the final conclusion of my book, that the data is so complex, the sources we need to draw on are so varied and the rival and competing theories as to causation so varied and difficult to prove or disprove, that we are going to need an INTERNATIONAL HISTORICAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO 9/11. This body, which IIPSGP will inaugurate here from France, and chair, will comprise only of professional and fully trained historians of the highest calibre, with at least a PhD in the subject, who can be expected to be thoroughly objective and professional in their treatment of the topic and the evidence that we will examine. The work of the Commission is expected to take at least 3 years to complete and to run from 2019 to 2022, when it is hoped it shall be ready to deliver it first report.\n\nAny fellow historians reading this blog with appropriate expertise and who wish to get involved in this vital work, please first read this book in detail, and then contact the author with a request to be invited to serve on the Commission.\n\nThe final point to make, is that this book is not only an historical study, although it is mainly that – it is also a philosophical and ethical study of 9/11. One of the most active researchers working on 9/11 issues hitherto is philosopher David Ray Griffin, who is a Process philosopher and theologian who has been most active in 9/11 research. But the one topic he has never written about, or lectured about, is exactly what is covered in the current book – namely who or what might have been actually behind the events of 9/11. He is brilliant at showing, conclusively, that for countless reasons, the official Bush Presidency narrative is unsound and untrue – but he has never attempted to put forward any possible alternative narrative or explanations. This work begins therefore, where Griffin’s work ends. As Coordinator of Philosophers for Peace in Europe (and Vice President globally) it is my duty therefore to pose the complex questions I have pursued in this book, and to have adopted the historical methodology as the most likely to yield concrete results. I have written this book therefore as a philosopher as well as a historian and I hope that not only professional philosophers, but also true lovers of wisdom and intellectuals throughout the world will find insights and ideas of value concealed in its pages.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that in our media driven and information rich world, we have become more and more swept over by floods of detail, floods of concern, presented to us minute by minute by facebook and other social and digital media platforms, which give us hardly any time to stand back and focus on the deeper patterns behind events, or the deeper meanings of our lives. We are constantly in a state of reacting to this or that crisis, or this or that “world emergency”. The increasing impoverishment of large sections of the population adds yet further anxiety to our already crowded lives as many people must daily struggle for their own survival and have no time or leisure to ask bigger picture questions. But I have a duty as both a philosopher and historians to ask these bigger picture questions, and having been determined to make the leisure time to research and write this book, have managed to see it through to completion, and now present the fruits of those years of work to my fellow human beings, for all our sakes.\n\nAnyone desirous of owning a copy of this book, which has been a long time in the making, can find it here:\n\nhttp://www.lulu.com/shop/dr-thomas-clough-daffern/prolegomena-to-a-history-of-911-a-historical-and-philosophical-study-of-911/paperback/product-23959399.html\n\nANTI-BREXIT AND PRO EUROPEAN UNION AND PRO UK NEWSLETTER\n\nPosted by in Uncategorized\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nINTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PEACE STUDIES AND GLOBAL PHILOSOPHY\n\nDirector, Dr. Thomas Daffern B.A. (Hons) D.Sc.

It will most likely result in the breakup of the UK. The editor argues this is a deliberate policy imposed by an ignorant and immoral financial and global elite who are hoping to make a huge profit from the practice of “Disaster Capitalism”. Some hard left activists and Jeremy Corbyn are also following “Disaster Socialism” towards Brexit. Brexit involves the willful destruction of an entire country, and thus can perhaps be analysed psychologically as an extensive project in self-harming. The sheer folly of Theresa May driving the UK towards a “Hard brexit” is breathtaking and we must work hard to stop it. Plus the disaster that is brexit will possibly lead to a resumption of violence in Northern Ireland, that has been at peace since 1998 and the undoing of the Good Friday agreement. It is a thoroughly irresponsible piece of misgovernment and calls for all true lovers of the UK and lovers of the EU to come together and campaign for an end to this mistaken and self destructive policy. Moderate Conservative leaders like John Major and Dominic Grieve, moderate Labour leaders, Greens and Liberal Democrats are all opposed to brexit. This Journal offers us a chance to share our findings and research and campaigning strategies. I am also calling for a weekly fast for non-violence, to counter the Brexit nightmare. I am suggested that everyone who is truly opposed to brexit spend each Sunday from now in fasting, prayer, study and campaigning. Gandhi advocated this method to fuel non-violence campaigns, so did the Druids of Britain and Ireland of old, and so did the hunger strikers in Northern Ireland when the Time of Troubles were at their worst. We have to prevent the madness that is Brexit so I ask you to join me in this Sunday weekly fast each Sunday until brexit is stopped. The School of Nonviolence continues its work under the auspices of IIPSGP with its new base here in France, but our work is Europe wide, including all of the British isles. Whereas the UK government wants to impose brexit and then go on spending on militarism, we at IIPSGP are saying – lets invest in peace, love, cooperation, nonviolence, and education, and keep both Europe and the UK together.\n\n1.PEOPLES MARCH 20 OCTOBER, 2018:\n\n2.CALL FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM:\n\n3.PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSING A SECOND REFERENDUM:\n\n4.EFFECTS ON NORTHERN IRELAND OF BREXIT:\n\n5.EFFECTS ON SCOTLAND OF BREXIT:\n\n6.FUTURE BREAK UP OF UNITED KINGDOM:\n\n7.PLAID CYMRY ON BREXIT:\n\n8.CORRESPONDENCE OF IIPSGP TO THE QUEEN;\n\n9.IMPACT OF BREXIT ON ACADEMIA\n\n10.IIPSGP MOVE TO FRANCE:\n\n11.WEAPONS SALES AND EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\n\n12.SAUDI ARABIA AND MURDER OF JAMAL KASHOGGI:\n\n13.PHILIP MAY AND WEAPONS INDUSTRY AND BREXIT\n\n14.SAUDI ARABIA AND DUP MONEY:\n\n15.ECONOMIC IMPACT OF BREXIT ON THE UK:\n\n16.FINANCIAL THINKERS AND BREXIT:\n\n17.EUROPEAN UNION MEDIATION SERVICE:\n\n18.GOVERNMENT BY PRIVY COUNCIL ?\n\n19.ORDER OF PEACE POETS, BARDS AND DRUIDS ON BREXIT\n\n& COUNCIL OF BRITISH DRUID ORDERS:\n\n20.UK MAY HAVE KICK STARTED WORLD WAR ONE DELIBERATELY\n\n21.QUEEN VICTORIA AND CRIMEAN WAR AND RUSSOPHOBIA –\n\n22.TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION FOR BRITAIN AND IRELAND:\n\n23.KARL MARX AND RUSSOPHOBIA –\n\n24.WORLD INTELLECTUAL FORUM –\n\n25.THE SILENCE OF THE INTELLECTUALS –\n\nBOOK ON 9/11 AND THE ROLE OF SAUDI ARABIA, UK AND USA- 9/11 HISTORICAL INVESTIGATION COMMISSION –\n\nEUROPEAN UNION FOUNDERS\n\nPROPOSAL FOR A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT RAINBOW ALLIANCE\n\nEUROPEAN DRUID COUNCIL:\n\n30.EUROPEAN POLITICAL PARTIES:\n\n31.PRESIDENT OF FINLAND\n\nCAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA AND MISUSE OF DATA\n\nIMPACT OF BREXIT ON ARCHAEOLOGY\n\nOVERSPENDING OF CAMPAIGN GROUP for BREXIT –\n\nMATHEMATICS OF THE 2016 REFERENDUM:\n\nROLE OF ANGLICAN CHURCH IN BREXIT –\n\nIMPACT OF BREXIT ON CULTURE IN THE UK:\n\nLEONARDO DA VINCI PEACE PRIZE –\n\nIMPACT OF BREXIT ON THE ARTS IN THE UK:\n\nMYSTERIOUS DEATH OF MARK WILLIAMS, ANTI-BREXIT CAMPAIGNER:\n\nSPIRITUAL INTEGRATION AND THE HISTORY OF EUROPEAN PHILOSOPHY:\n\nWHO ACTUALLY ENGINEERED BREXIT AND FOR WHAT PURPOSES ?

This represents a turning point in public opinion in the UK which is now definitely moving in the direction of a second referendum.\n\n2.CALL FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM: Many voices have been raised to call for a second referendum following the fake referendum of 2016, which was allowed to take place without anyone realising the consequences, and which put no safety net in to insist that such a major constitutional change should be approved by at least 60% of the electorate. Instead only a wafer thin majority of actual voters called for Brexit, and the people of Scotland and Northern Ireland voted against it. So for these and many other reasons, political commentators and political scientists have realised that calling for a second referendum is the only fair way to resolve this deadlock in British and European affairs. Some voices, who are immune to reason however continue to protest against it, including Pal Desmond owner of the Daily Express, and other brexit hard core lobbyists. It is becoming apparent that there are few if any intellectual argument against a second referendum, and therefore mostly the hard core Brexit mob rely on anti-intellectual arguments. They realise Brexit is irrational and therefore support it all the more strongly. It has become a badge of pseudo-conspiracy theorists to wear with honour, and the more they are told by all reasonable punters and commentators that brexit will be bad for the UK, the more they say “we told you so, the establishment is against brexit”. So to be pro Brexit has become a badge of being anti-establishment. It is difficult to know how to debate with such a climate of fear, mistrust, paranoia and conspiracy theory going the rounds, a lot of it on the internet. It is the purpose of this Journal to be independent of any myopic political or economic interests, but to be purely rational, philosophical and academic in our analyses. The simple fact that the UK will break up following brexit is one of many reasons why IIPSGP opposes it. IIPSGP was founded in 1991 to establish an international centre for peace thinking in the UK, in London, and to provide scientific research and information to make peace policies viable for not just UK governments, but for and on behalf the British people as a whole. We have since then organized 100’s of educational events and conferences seminars, lectures, including 35 meetings in the House of Lords, all aimed at shifting the UK as a whole in the direction of peace policy, and a de-escalation of our arms and weapons expenditure and an increase of our educational and social, and cultural expenditure as a nation. To IIPSGP Brexit is the worst challenge since we were established in 1991, and the prospect of the fracturation of the UK which would cause years of chaos and legal wrangles between the members countries as they break up, and possibly even cause renewed fighting on the streets of Belfast, is such a horrific possibility, that IIPSGP opposes Brexit with all its resources and might. Therefore we 100% support the idea of a second referendum as the most fair and just and logical way of dealing with this situation.\n\n3.PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSING A SECOND REFERENDUM: Some Brexit die hards remain implacably opposed to a second referendum, including sadly prime Minister Theresa May, her husband Philip May, Paul Desmond owner of the Daily Express, and almost certainly Rupert Murdoch owner of the Sun and the Times newspapers. The BBC has consistently played a negative role in forcing Brexit down the throats of the British people, even though it is against the will of the vast majority of thinking people, against the will of the Scottish and Irish citizens of the Uk. It raises the complex question of who decided the direction of policy at the BBC ? Nicholas Humphries the BBC interviewer has been consistently in favour of brexit . The BBC also gives hardly any air time to genuine voices opposing Brexit. All this has created a mind set in the public that it is somehow “unpatriotic” to oppose Brexit, but in fact the exact opposite is the case. The majority of Theresa May’s Cabinet who now are pushing through Brexit actually initially opposed it. They have proved they have no real political principles, but just flip-flop every which way. The author’s Parliamentary Duty of Veracity Bill is designed to put an end to careerist politicians with no actually values or ethics.\n\n4.EFFECTS ON NORTHERN IRELAND OF BREXIT: The people of Northern Ireland in the referendum of 2016 voted in favour of remaining inside the European Union. Their wish has been totally ignored by the May government as it rams Brexit down the throats of the whole of the UK. The Democratic Unionist party of Ulster hard line protestants have propped up May’s government, on the basis of enabling brexit to go ahead. Sinn Fein by contrast have called for a referendum to be put to the people of Northern Ireland before Brexit is implemented giving them the choice of rejoining with the Republic of Ireland and leaving the UK, and thereby remaining inside the EU, as per the specifically agreed Good Friday agreement, which is an international treaty. If the UK government forces Brexit on Northern Ireland it will be unilaterally going against the spirit and the letter of the Good Friday agreement, and this may well kick start extreme violence back on the streets of Belfast. The nationalist community will feel their views have been utterly ignored. If hard borders are brought back between the North and South of Ireland, manned by troops, they will become again the locus of discontent and dissatisfaction on the part of ordinary people on the north and south of the border, who will once more have to present passports and all kinds of paperwork at the border, even if they are going on local shopping trips. Since it will be the border between a European Union member state and a non-Europe union member state, there is no way it can be other than a hard border, with all that implies. The only solution to this impasse, is either to let the entire UK have a second referendum on re-examining its decision to leave the EU altogether. Alternatively, the people of Northern Ireland must be given a referendum on whether they would prefer to accompany the UK out of the EU, or would rather join with the Republic of Ireland and remain together as one unified state in the European Union. For those who have forgotten the tragedies that the hard border caused in the time of troubles, from 1967-1990, the recent book by a survivor of the Miami Showband Massacre, by Stephen Travers, the bass player in the group, is a sombre reminder of how bad it was. This innocent pop group, which comprised both Catholic and Protestant members, and for a time was the most popular group in the whole of Ireland, North and South of the border, was on its way to Newry having been playing a concert that night, when it was stopped at a fake roadblock manned by extremist protestant loyalists, dressed up as British army soldiers. They proceeded to plant a bomb in the back of the pop groups Volkswagen van, but the two protestant extremists planting the bomb were blown up by accident through their own mistake, whereupon the rest of the army squadies opened fire on the band, and killed them at point blank range, firing at the lead singer 27 times. One of the survivors, Stephen Travers, lived to tell his tale and how now published a book about it. He had been shot by a dum-dum bullet and his would be murderers thought he was dead. He was lying face down in a ditch not daring to move, and succeeded in convincing them he was in fact dead. They arms squad withdrew and he and one other survivor managed to get help and their lives were saved in a local hospital. Why would extremist Protestants target a pop group like this ? Because they opposed the very possibility of harmony and peace between catholic and protestants – being an Ulster Protestant had become a kind of fanatical violent club which inflicted death and mayhem on its enemies and pretended to do this “in the name of the British state”. The reason the majority of the people of northern Ireland voted against Brexit is that they remember these horrific times clearly and did not wish to see them brought back. The clutch of Conservative politicians who have delivered brexit have no real knowledge of Irish history, except what they might have picked up from army operatives in the good old days of the British army presence in Ulster, and no real acquaintance with the whole history of the search for peace in Northern Ireland., The Labour leader who managed to organise the Good Friday agreement, Tony Blair, is one of the most articulate opponents of Brexit, partly because he knows how hard Ireland laboured to get peace. The Northern Ireland issue alone in IIPSGP’s honest opinion should be enough for the UK to hold a second referendum and cancel Brexit immediately as it is utterly contrary to the needs and wishes of the people of Northern Ireland except for a die hard minority of people the kind of people who carried out the Miami Showband Massacre back in 1975. At a recent rally (October 20, 2018) in Belfast opposing Brexit, cross-community Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said: “We have the EU to thank for the longest period of peace and stability on the continent of Europe in history. The EU forced nations to compromise, forced people to come together on the big issues like climate change. It underpinned the peace. The EU spent money underpinning the peace right across Europe, from the fall of the Berlin Wall, which could have been chaotic, right through to the former Yugoslavia. “Nowhere did it do that more so than right here.” She said the Brexit debate was not about protecting the UK’s union or creating a united Ireland, as it has been characterised by some on opposite sides of the issue. Instead, it was about celebrating the work of the wider Europe and the peace it had helped create out of the chaos of the former Time of troubles in Northern Ireland, which had claimed thousands of lives and wasted so many years on violence. Now Northern Ireland had moved on and did not want to be dragged back to the days of outdated polarisation precipitated by a Brexit that Northern Ireland didn’t vote for, imposed over their heads from Westminster.\n\n5.EFFECTS ON SCOTLAND OF BREXIT: The idea of having Brexit rammed down their throats has made the average Scot ever more determined to bring about Scottish independence as quickly as possible. During the Scottish independence referendum of 2014, the Scottish people were told by the Westminster Press and Westminster politicians, that if they voted to leave the UK, they would also leave the European Union, and that the continuing state of the UK would block their re-entry to the European Union for years to come. This was a sobering warning which persuaded many people,. Including the editor, to vote for the UK to remain as an integral state. The argument now is entirely reversed however. A Westminster Conservative government is now pulling the UK out of the EU against the express democratic wishes of the majority of the people of Scotland, against all their long term interests as a nation. Scotland benefits greatly from EU immigration, as it does by the ability to send its sons and daughter abroad to other European nations. Ever since the mediaeval period Scottish thinkers and academics have benefited from teaching and studying in Europe, and the founding of the Scots College in Paris and also in Rome became centres of intellectual activity by the Scottish people abroad. Following the capture of the UK crown by the Hanoverian dynasty, many Jacobite Scottish intellectuals went into voluntary exile in France and elsewhere in Europe and brought many features of advanced Scottish intellectual activity. One of the most famous was Chevalier Ramsay who introduced freemasonry into France, which in turn influenced whole generations of French and European intellectuals. Scotland’s wish to remain a democratic nation at the heart of European cultural and political identity should be respect by Westminster, and it if it is not, then the strong probability that the people of Scotland will vote to leave the UK should be accepted as a likely outcome of Westminster Brexit policies. This means the immediate end of any attempt at great power status by the rump UK state, and the nuclear weapons base at Faslane will have to be relocated on to English soil, as the Scottish nationalist government would insist they are removed from Scotland once independence is achieved. .\n\n6.FUTURE BREAK UP OF UNITED KINGDOM: the breakup of the UK as a political entity following brexit is in the editor’s opinion 100% guaranteed. Having lived in Scotland for 7 years, Wales for 10 years, and England for 30 years, and being one quarter Irish and having visited Ireland many times, and having set up the truth and Reconciliation Commission for Britain and Ireland, the editor is in a good position to judge the mood of the nations of the UK, and having done his homework can announce beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt, that the effects of brexit will be the certain breakup of the UK as a political entity. There are three types of Brexiteer responses when you explain this to them. The first type is simply too rude to listen, and interrupts and literally will not listen to the concerns. The second type listens but simply says “I do not believe it, the Scots and Northern Irish are not that stupid (implying it would be their mistake), and anyway it’s not going to happen”. This response shows simply that the listener has not thought this through. The third kind gets angry and says “we will not let it happen, we will fight to keep the UK together, and if necessary we will put troops back in Belfast and re-garrison Northern Ireland, and if we have to, we will put troops into Glasgow” – this kind of response is simply immoral, ill educated and betrays a supreme degree of ignorance. To put it mathematically, the risk of the breakup of the UK following brexit is somewhere between 100% and 90% according to my own mathematical calculations. If you were told by the pilot of your transatlantic plane that the risks of your falling from the sky as you are taxying on the runway on takeoff, were something from 90-100% certain, would you stay on the plane ? Would you not immediately demand to get out ? there is a fourth kind of person who supports Brexit, and who says “Yes I know the UK will break up as a result of brexit, and that my dear friend is exactly the outcome we want.. we want the UK to break up”. Who would come into this picture ? These would be extremists who have no love for the UK and indeed want to see it collapse. They include some extreme right wing American USA citizens, hard right wing republican types, who are anti Monarchy, who hate the liberal and democratic UK system, who are extreme conservatives and want to bring back the death penalty, etc. etc. Some of these types work for the CIA and have been involved in dodgy intelligence work for decades. For them breaking up the UK is only a sideshow which completes the work that the USA revolution failed to achieve in 1776. The fact that the monarchy would almost certainly also collapse following the breakup of the UK is another thing they will cheer about. Such propagandists are responsible for all the virulent anti-Windsor propaganda that we see on our internet screens. But these USA extremists ignore the fact that it is actually against the real geopolitical interests of the USA to see the UK break up. Another type of people who might actually enjoy the breakup of the UK are extremist Muslims who would hope to see the break up the UK and its being in a period of uncertainty and economic and spiritual collapse, and the possible end of the monarchy, as a period in which the Kingdom of Allah would be advanced. The rich oil states are in general in favour of Brexit and have helped bankroll the brexit campaigns. They think they will benefit from a UK outside the EU, and not knowing anything about the politics of Ireland or Scotland, do not realise that with the UK broken up, London will cease to be a valuable financial centre and that England, outside the EU, will simply collapse as a wealthy nation of any consequence. At this point the Arab Sheiks and their oil money will move elsewhere. Arguably, some extreme Russian patriots might also take delight at the breakup of the UK, since the UK has masterminded for decades virulent propaganda against them, has watched smirking on the sidelines as their agents helped arm Al Qaeda to fight them in Afghanistan, and then smirked again as Ukraine collapsed into civil war. So the UK has stood watching happily a the former USSR was reduced from superpower status to that of the Russian federation, and thought it had “won the cold war” though it alliance with Arab and Sunni petro-dollars. The Russians however have a very long memory, and it is possible that some extremist Russian patriots might be laughing as they think of the prospect of the breakup of the UK as a result of completely idiotic own goal of the UK at pursuing Brexit, against their self-interest as a nation. The only Russian who were cheer at this prospect however are anti-democratic and illiberal types who would see it as karmic pay back for all the years that the UK has interfered in Russian affairs, including in Afghanistan. A few other billionaires and very wealthy people around the world might think that if the UK is autonomous and outside the EU they can benefit personally from having a relaxed banking regime, and being able to carry on with dodgy financial operations in the city of London without too many questions being asked – the kind of people who base their offices in the Cayman islands, and who were exposed in the Panama Papers. But these people have simply not worked out the implications of Brexit on the breakup of the UK as a whole and the diminution of London’ status as the erstwhile financial capital of the world. Another extremist group who would no doubt laugh and cheer at the breakup of the UK into its constituent states, are some extremist Zionist elements, hard right Israeli’s who are completely and utterly opposed to any attempts to grant human rights or equal citizenship to Palestinians, and who instead think that Israel has the right to become a nuclear armed superpower and to bomb and destabilise neighbouring Arabic and Islamic nations at will, because it is the will of Yahweh. Such extremist political Zionists, not knowing anything much about Irish and Scottish history, will simply be ignorant of the impact of the breakup of the UK long term. When your explain it to them, however, as the editor has done, that it is the equivalent of Galilee region and the whole of Northern Israel and Haifa voting to leave Israel and become and independent state again, would you approve ? The penny begins to drop. But the descendents of the Stern gang and other anti-British die-hard Zionists who killed British troops in Palestine, and who furthermore offered to make a pact with Hitler and fight for a Hitlerite victory in world war two, mistakenly thinking it would give them a quicker chance of getting an independent Israel (as documented in the book by Ralph Schoenman, The Darker Side Of Zionism, and the works of Allan Hart, former BBC Panorama producer, who has written a three volume critical study of extremist Zionism (not the kind of loving fluffy Zionist envisioned by Moses Hess) – these kind of extremist Zionists would no doubt see the destruction of the UK as their final victory in history over the hated British Empire, which has been reduced to nothing, a patchwork of insignificant nations. They would see it as the final revenge of Yahweh over the British. Such extreme Zionists are usually also extremely anti-Christian and would also like to see the destruction of the UK and the destruction of the British monarchy, as a hated relic of mediaeval Christianity, which deserves to die a death. Just as extreme Zionists give little credence to Christ or to Christianity, and believe he was a false messiah, so they will be able them to say to themselves, watching the self-destruction of the British nation, that it proves Christ was indeed a false messiah. The average intelligent Israeli of course does not share these views, and would be shocked if Mossad had indeed helped engineer Brexit, but there are certainly some darker extreme Zionist people in influential offices in Israel who would actually love Brexit to go ahead – doing as much damage to the Uk and to Europe is part of their own agenda for promoting Israel. One of my learned Israeli friends has just emailed the following: “Originally, the Zionist movement was visionary and noble. Its Declaration of the State of Israel in 148 included these words: “The State of Israel will be open for Jewish immigration and for the Ingathering of the Exiles; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.” Unfortunately, this declaration is no longer legally valid in Israel and was replaced very recently by a ‘national law’ which says the opposite about the ‘others’, i.e., those who are not ‘legally Jews’, in the most dry and visionless manner. Fundamentalist Jews and so many of them in the settlements, mostly illegal, have betrayed the spirit of Zionism and plan on building their ‘third temple’ in Jerusalem. They imagine themselves to be the descendants of the Maccabeans of the Hasmonean dynasty that ruled Judea in the 1st and 2nd centuries and revolted against the Greeks, and of the Jewish population that rebelled against the Roman Empire in 66 CE, which led to the destruction of the second temple and their final exile. So now they are planning on reclaiming Judea and the third temple, not considering everybody and everything that happened in that region since then. They can’t care less about the Brexit nor do they care about Jews who don’t think like them, which have become a minority in Israel. These fundamentalist religious Jews calling themselves Zionists have taken over education and culture in Israel and now over the army, which as strange as it may sound, was once the source of positive developments. Very recently, a declaration led and signed by 70 previously highly regarded army commanders of the IDF demanded the Netanyahu government to reinforce a two-state solution, which it refuses to do. In other words, just as the Brexit will destroy the UK and damage Europe, the fundamentalist anti-democratic regime of Israel, calling itself Zionism, but which ought to be called pseudo-Zionism, will destroy Israel and its needless third temple, just as it did when it foolishly and unnecessarily revolted against Rome 2000 years ago. Some people never learn… history repeats itself… and progress in cultural consciousness is very slow despite technological developments..” To deconstruct the ideology of this extreme Zionism and why it’s theology (“the God of Israel is the only God of history and all other nations, all other Gods, all other peoples, can be destroyed for all we care”) is false and dangerous, is something I have addressed in other writings. It was precisely this kind of extremist position that Rabbi Yeshua of Galilee spoke out against in his own day. Of course we all want a beautiful, peaceful, happy and joyful Israel living in harmony with all their neighbours, with human rights for all citizens, but not if it means destroying the entire world and all other nations. Trampling on Palestinian rights, suppressing Islam and fomenting civil war throughout the middle East by covert means, and now creating brexit to bring down the EU and the UK, in order to achieve it. That is utterly shocking, but may be part of what has been going on behind the scenes. Brexit is not only a struggle going on inside British hearts, but it raises also the same kinds of issues (egotistic nationalism or altruistic internationalism) that are going on inside Israeli and Jewish hearts worldwide.\n\nMy learned late Rabbi friends Rabbi Al"
