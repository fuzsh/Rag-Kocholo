        "text": "Introducing Bang! Out Of Order… a quiz game where you don’t need to know the answers!\n\nOur first new game of 2024 has landed, whoop whoop!\n\nBang! Out Of Order is a quiz game with a twist - in the game you don’t need to know the answers… your team just needs to put them in the right order!\n\nIt’s easy to begin with but as the number chain starts to build so does the tension and the chances of something being in the wrong place.\n\nWe developed the game with the help of our son Charlie (8) who loves the drama as the number chain builds and builds. All the content in the game is family friendly and we’ve designed it to be a challenge for both kids and adults.\n\nAre there more taxis in New York City or poplar bears in the Arctic?\n\nIn Bang! Out of Order Teams take turns placing cards on a scale from zero to infinity.\n\nYou don’t need to know the answers - just figure out where each one should go.\n\nEach turn, your team can choose to either add a new card to the chain, or call it out if you think the number chain has all gone wrong!\n\nWhen you think the order doesn’t quite stack up, slam your fist down on the table and shout Bang! Out Of Order! Reveal the answers… but if you're wrong the other team win all the points!\n\nCrammed full of weird and wonderful facts!\n\nBang! Out of Order is full of fun & fascinating facts that you never knew you needed to know. It’s easy at the start, but as the facts stack up so does the tension!\n\nIt is the perfect family party game for anyone aged 8+ and it works both in large groups and also as a two player party game… a rare and beautiful thing!\n\nAvailable now!\n\nWe hope you enjoy Bang! Out of Order just as much as we do.\n\nYou can buy it on our website here or on Amazon UK right here!\n\nLockdown diaries: Our favourite party games to play on Zoom\n\nBy Chris Reynolds\n\nOne of the small joys to come out of the coronavirus pandemic has been using Zoom to connect with our friends and family dotted across the UK and wider world. Over the last few weeks we’ve tried out quite a few games to see if they work well on Zoom and thought we’d spend a moment to share the games we’ve been loving. In each instance, just one ‘zoomer’ has to own the game in question. I imagine the games would also work on any other video chat - including Skype, Facetime and Houseparty.\n\n1. Wavelength\n\nAge: 14+ | Players: 2-8 | Time: 30 mins\n\nWavelength is our favourite party game at the moment - we love it. It is played in two teams and has worked really well over Zoom (so far we’ve played it with groups of six and four). In the game two teams compete to read each other’s minds - but as you soon find out it’s not about telepathy at all - it’s about empathy, understanding and knowing your teammates. You don’t need to tweak the rules to play over Zoom but whoever has the game in their possession will have to lead the way.\n\n2. Soundiculous\n\nAge: 8+ | Players: 3-10 | Time: 15 mins\n\nDespite creating Soundiculous several years ago we still love playing it, and have found it works really well on video chat. The game is super simple - the aim is to get the most points by making and guessing ridiculous sounds. Sounds range from nice and easy (monkey, train, eating) through medium (didgeridoo, roller coaster, electric shock) to the truly challenging hard (wrestling, scuba diving, woodpecker!). When playing over video chat you don’t have to change the rules, but just need players to close their eyes for a moment whilst the noise card is revealed via the webcam to the noise maker. Whoever has the game has to take the lead and keep score but they can still play.\n\n3. Just One\n\nAge: 8+ | Players: 3-10 | Time: 20 mins\n\nJust One is a brilliant word game and works really well over Zoom. It is a collaborative word guessing game. In the game all players except the guesser know a word. Players have to communicate the mystery word to the guesser using a one word clue. The challenge is that the one word clues have to be unique - all duplicates are taken out of the game without the guesser seeing them. This one doesn’t require any rule changes - you all just need some pen and paper handy. Our highest score to date is eight - I dream of a perfect 13!\n\n4. Shot in the Dark\n\nAge: 12+ | Players: 2+ | Time: 20 mins\n\nShot in the Dark is a brilliant trivia game. The questions are what makes it so good - they are all questions where it is unlikely anyone will know the actual answer, but everyone can have an educated guess and the closest answer wins. There are a few hundred questions in the game so it will last a good while and it plays really well in groups from 2 to 8 players. The player with the game can still play along.\n\n5. Frozen Unicorns\n\nAge: 6+ | Players: 3+ | Time: 20 mins\n\nFrozen Unicorns is one of the games we launched last year and it plays really well over Zoom - especially with younger players. In the game players have to make human statues, with everyone except the guesser freezing to mimic things like frozen pirates, a frozen octopus or a frozen ballerina. The guesser then has to work out what everyone is. Like all of our games it is simple to pick up and will get you laughing every time.\n\nIf you try out any of these games over Zoom, we’d love to know how you get on! Let us know - or share your own top tips - in the comments below.\n\nMore Spreading Happiness News: Gamely Donates to Justlife\n\nFresh from our donation to The Carer’s Centre for Brighton and Hove, we’re delighted to tell you that last we donated £1000 to Justlife, a wonderful charity working with the ‘hidden homeless’ in Brighton and Manchester. We also sent the team a box of brownies as a little encouragement and small way of saying thank you for all the hard work they do.\n\nIf you’ve been following us for much time, you’ll already know that we give away 10% of our profits to charity, which this donation comes out of. But what you might not know is that as part of our desire to be the best employers out there, we give each member of the team the chance to pick where a portion of that money goes. Justlife was Dave’s pick, and here’s what he had to say:\n\n“Justlife are an amazing charity. They are helping really vulnerable people who are often ignored by the system. There are literally hundreds of thousands of people in the UK living in inadequate ‘temporary’ accommodation, who are desperately in need of support. Brighton is a great place to live, but this sort of homelessness is a real issue here, and as I’ve got to know the work of Justlife in the last few years I’ve seen that they are doing their work in an amazingly kind, loving and empowering way. Huge thanks to them, and huge thanks to Gamely for letting me choose where to donate this money!.”\n\nWe also asked Simon Gale, Operations Manager for Justlife in Brighton, to tell us a bit more about Justlife, where the donation will be used, and why their work is important:\n\n“We are so grateful for Gamely’s donation. We work with hidden homeless people in Brighton and Manchester - people who often have no support and are placed in temporary accommodation that is unsuitable and leads to poor physical and mental health. Our work provides people a voice and helps them move away from homelessness, into stable accommodation and all round good health. The donation will enable us to support people over this Christmas period, which can often be isolating and hard time for people experiencing homelessness.”\n\nWe’re so glad to have been able to donate to the amazing charities that we have, but the only reason we can do that is because of everyone who buys our games - that’s you! A small portion of every sale goes to these good causes, so as much as we hope you’ve had loads of fun playing the game, we hope that this little bit of extra good helps you feel even better about buying Gamely. Thank you to all of you, and happy Christmas!\n\nWhat happens when you turn down investment on Dragon's Den?\n\nI can’t quite believe that almost a whole year has passed since I appeared on Dragon’s Den! It feels like just yesterday that I was sat nervously on the sofa with Chris, laughing again at Deborah Meaden’s amazing Randomise acting skills and watching through my fingers as the version of me on screen tried to negotiate a business deal with Jenny...\n\nAs you may remember, I turned down Jenny’s offer in the end (it just didn’t suit the way we want to do business) and as I left the den, Peter Jones exclaimed ‘She’ll live to regret that!’. One year on, I’m delighted to say that this prediction has proved to be totally inaccurate! 2019 has proved to be a year of doing good, having fun and selling plenty of games! With our Christmas Special due for a re-run this Sunday (BBC2 8pm) I thought I’d give a little update on what happened next and share some lessons from my experience.\n\nNow, firstly I will say that expanding internationally has been a challenge, and we are now looking at collaborating with other games companies who may be able to help us reach worldwide audiences. But, our success in the UK has been even better than we hoped. At the time of writing, we have sold more than 100,000 games and we have just won the Amazon Small Business of the Year award. Every week, we hear new stories of how our games have helped people connect and laugh together and we couldn’t be happier about the way we are doing business.\n\nWe are a unique business, and as the year has passed we’ve realised more and more that not having any external investors really allows us to be ourselves. For us, business is not just about profit - it’s about doing good, making the world a better place and having fun while we’re doing it. As well as releasing two brand new games - Jibbergiggle and Frozen Unicorns - and adding Dave to our dream team, this year we’ve donated thousands of pounds to charity, given away hundreds of games to good causes and have sought to look after our team well in all sorts of ways. While we believe that these things are ultimately good for business, and very compatible with having a profitable business, we don’t have to prove the ‘cause and effect’ to anyone. And this freedom really allows us to take risks, give generously and act from the heart.\n\nSo, in summary, can investors be helpful to a small and growing company? Of course they can. But, there are plenty of other places to get input, advice and support. And for us, the freedom and flexibility that comes from being independent of investors brings huge benefits. While investment can be helpful, I’d encourage any young company to think twice, and consider where they can find other sources of finance, knowledge and support to make the business that they want - and not the business that an investor may be imagining.\n\nI feel confident that Gamely is a significantly better, healthier and happier business for following its own path over the last 12 months and I’m pleased to report that, despite Peter’s predictions, I’m yet to feel even a hint of regret.\n\nP.s. We wouldn’t be able to do any of this without the amazing support of our families, friends, mentors (including the brilliant people we met at Kings 20) and partners. And of course, every single one of you who has ever bought, played or talked about any of our games. We feel incredibly lucky to be able to be doing what we do and we are thinking up even more ways to share the love and do even more good things for our customers, our team and the wider world in 2020.\n\nPutting Smiles On Faces - Gamely Donate to Carer's Centre\n\nAt Gamely we like to do good things - good things for our customers, good things for our team and good things for the wider world. Today, we’re donating £1200 to the Carer’s Centre for Brighton and Hove.\n\nYou may or may not know that at Gamely we give 10% of our profits (or 1% of turnover - whichever is bigger) to good causes and the Carer’s Centre is a wonderful local charity doing amazing work, well deserving of this donation.\n\nHazel and Dave recently visited their Young Carer’s Drop-in service, where they met some of the incredible young carers the charity works with. As well as having lots of fun playing our games with them, they both went away really impacted by the challenges these young people face, and the incredible strength and resilience that they show through it all. They really are amazing!\n\nThe money that we are donating will go towards paying for a special Christmas activity for these young carers, with more left over for other work that will help support future work of the Carer’s Centre. Tom Lambert, CEO of the Carer’s Centre had this to say: ‘The generosity of Gamely is a recognition of the amazing work Young Carers do in supporting ill or disabled family members every day across Brighton & Hove. The Carers Centre will use this amazing donation to provide peer support activities for isolated Young Carers over the festive period and into 2020’.\n\nWe’re also donating 40 games to be used as Christmas gifts for each young person attending their drop-in, as part of our initiative to get free games to children most in need of a smile.\n\nWe also want to say a massive THANK YOU to all of you who have bought our games - this is your donation as much as ours and is only possible because of your support. This is just the first donation we are making this Christmas, so do stay tuned here for more good news coming soon.\n\nAmazing People, Inspiring Journeys: Lessons from giving away £1500 in a day\n\nBy Dave Perrins\n\nTwo weeks ago, on the 1st April, we ran our marathon giving day, sponsoring 150 people £10 each for their marathon efforts towards good causes they care about. We did the same last year, but I wasn’t at the company then, and I’ve got to say that I found it an unexpectedly inspiring, encouraging, sobering and moving experience. Now that the dust settled on all the giving and emotion (!) I wanted to share some of the incredible stories I heard, and how it impacted me.\n\nWe heard from a real variety of people. We had people running their 15th (ish) marathon (Gower Tan and Carol Littler) and a whole raft of people running their first ever - including plenty in their 40s and 50s, proving that it’s never too late to start. Like many of us, I live a busy life, and can fall prey to that incredible human skill of finding an excuse not to do something that feels too hard! It might sound cliche, but seeing these people, who are older than me, get going and do something towards ‘their cause’ really empowered me to get on with it for myself.\n\nAnd that wasn’t all. As if ‘just getting started’ weren’t a good enough excuse, any idea that the circumstances of my rather comfortable life could get in the way were quickly obliterated too. We had Melanie Barratt, who is blind and is actually a paralympic gold medallist in swimming, but who has now signed up to run a marathon with a sighted guide. Wiki Solly is partially sighted and running her first ever marathon, also alongside a guide. Nicole Glover has lost 7 stone to run, while another runner has lost half his body weight (!!!) to get in shape for the marathon. Susie Godley is running for MS, while living with MS herself. All truly incredible and awe-inspiring.\n\nThe final real encouragement to me came from people who have been through awful circumstances, where it must have been hard to see any sort of route forward, to come to this point of running a marathon. It was a reminder that however hard life can be (and let’s face it some of us have to face up to really hard stuff), that much of the time, the light of the tunnel will emerge, and the story will go on.\n\nClaire Flatt is raising money for McMillan (and is nearly at an astonishing £10,000 - nice one Claire!) and has gone from chemotherapy to running a marathon in 9 months. Claudia Burrough, another sponsoree, will be completing this year’s marathon in a wheelchair after losing her ability to walk in the training period for last year’s marathon. Nick Smith is running for Spinal Research after having his back replaced 12 years ago following an accident.\n\nWe really did read everyone’s posts and contributions and there were so many more we could have mentioned. Like Minal Patel’s inspiring response to incredible loss and adversity which had us in floods of tears or Debbie Ward closing in on raising an incredible £100,000 for cancer research. We don’t have the space to share all 150 stories here, but you can head to our Facebook post to browse them for yourself.\n\nThe big take away for me was that while there are so many amazing causes to support out there, a huge part of making a difference is simply taking the energy and effort to show up and do something. It can be easy to block these causes out, or simply get busy with everyday life (and there’s no shame in that) but actually by going out of their way, these amazing and inspiring yet just-like-me people are really contributing to causes that matter, and raising awareness at the same time. It was a privilege to be part of it, and as a company it felt like a real honour to play a very small part in these stories.\n\nGoing away at the end of the day I had a smile on my face at this beautiful but unorthodox way of giving (we even had to pause at one point for a bank fraud check!), at the incredible stories efforts of these wonderful people, but also with a real sense of challenge. What can I contribute? How can I open myself up to others stories and experiences enough to provoke me to action?\n\nIt looks different for all of us, and I don’t foresee myself running a marathon soon (although maybe you do!) but it has certainly given me a different insight and outlook, and empowered me to believe that I can, and must, do my own small bit towards making this world of ours a better and happier place. Good luck to all you amazing runners doing exactly that!\n\nDragon's Den: What Happened Next?\n\nHow great was Deborah Meaden playing Randomise on Dragon’s Den? She totally got into the spirit of our company and watching her act out a ‘Gentle Punk Selling Lemonade’ on the show was almost as hilarious as watching her do it live. The editors did well to cut out my distracting belly laughs while she was acting!\n\nSeeing myself on the TV screen was just as bizarre as I’d imagined - it felt a bit like an out of body experience… But wow, what an experience to have survived the Dragon’s Den.\n\nIf you watched the show you’ll know I got an offer of investment from Jenny Campbell and I am so grateful for this - it has given me a real sense of validation to know that she believes in what we are doing. So why did I turn her down?!\n\nOn the show it certainly seemed like I’d made a surprising decision - not least, after I’d left the studio, when Peter Jones declared ‘She’ll live to regret that!’. But honestly, it didn’t feel that surprising at the time - the final offer, with it’s two-year payback period, just didn’t suit our plans for growth that is sustainable in the long-term.\n\nIt might look like I made a quick decision - but in reality I spent more than an hour in the den, detailing all our financial history and conservative forecasts, exploring our company’s value with the Dragons.\n\nOf course, at the time, I would have taken an investment offer at the price we set - as a team we’d agreed this would be worth it for the expertise a Dragon would bring. However, we are now reconsidering whether we really want investment to ‘supercharge’ our company or whether growing more organically (investing our profits into creating and printing more games each year) is a more sustainable and enjoyable route.\n\nWill I live to regret my decision? Who knows! But right now, no regrets. I feel like we are in a great position, building a good company for the long term benefit of our customers, our team and our world. Watch this space!\n\nTotally surreal: My experience in the den\n\nI can finally talk about it – we’re going to be on Dragons’ Den!\n\nThe episode was filmed back in June, and it’s been a real challenge keeping it to myself. I’m still not allowed to tell you what happens – you’ll have to watch BBC TWO at 8pm on Sunday 23 December to find that out – but I can tell you about the exciting and totally surreal experience of filming it.\n\nMy youngest child, Cora, was only four-months-old at the time and I was still on maternity leave, so I took the day of recording as one of my ‘keeping in touch’ days. This meant a trip for the entire family to Manchester, and roping my dad in for a day out at the Science Museum with Chris (my husband and cofounder) and Charlie (our two-year-old). That meant Chris could pop in with Cora every three hours so I could feed her. It was quite an experience getting my hair and make-up done all glam and prepping for the TV cameras, then taking a quick break to breastfeed!\n\nFilming was so bizarre, and so much fun, standing in the places you know so well from TV and looking into the faces of people you normally only see in a box in your living room. I’ll be honest, it was nerve-wracking. Everyone on the set is lovely, but the dragons are intimidating and they certainly gave me a good grilling. It was a major adrenaline rush and I’ve not experienced anything like it before. What I enjoyed most of all, though, was getting to talk about the business I feel so passionately about, how much we’ve achieved and our aims for the future. It made me so proud.\n\nApparently I was in the den for more than an hour, but the time absolutely flew by. Emerging out into the real world again at the end of the day was a bit disorientating. Once the adrenaline wore off, I was shattered, so we travelled straight over to Bishop Monkton (where I grew up and my parents still live), swiftly putting the kids to bed before passing out ourselves.\n\nIt all feels like a crazy dream now – I’m looking forward to watching the episode on Sunday just to prove to myself that it actually happened!\n\nI’d love to know what you think about the episode – you can tell me in the comments, or we’re on Facebook and Instagram. I’ll post my reflections on the show once it’s aired (it will be the first time I’ve seen it) so look out for that. Fingers crossed I come across OK in the edit!\n\nChanging the face of entrepreneurship at Number 10\n\nI am a games maker. I am a founder. I am a mother. And I guess I am an ‘entrepreneur’. Why is it that this last one still feels funny to say?\n\nMaybe because I never expected to be here. I didn’t set out to become an entrepreneur. When I was at school, I never even considered the idea. And I’m sure the careers adviser never suggested it.\n\nWrongly or rightly, the stereotypical view of an entrepreneur I’d absorbed from society was of the ruthlessly ambitious workaholic, sacrificing their family and personal life to focus on selling and negotiating around the clock, in order to dominate in the harsh dog-eat-dog world of business. This persona didn’t feel relevant or appealing to me at all. So how did I end up here?\n\nEntrepreneurship happened to me\n\nThe idea of setting up a business to get my game, Randomise, out into the world came about more as a necessity than a lifelong dream. I was stuck in a job that was sucking the life out of me and I wanted to find a different way to put some good out into the world.\n\nWhen I quit my job and founded Gamely Games, I was fully expecting to be thrown into the stressful, lonely, all-consuming struggle I’d imagined awaited all ‘entrepreneurs’. But my experience of setting up a business couldn’t have been more different.\n\nWhat I discovered was a huge network of support and advice, and a community of new entrepreneurs creating businesses with purpose and balance. People doing business differently, starting with what is good and meaningful and growing their companies in a way that made their lives better every day.\n\nAmazing support\n\nInitiatives like the Happy Startup School, Entrepreneurial Spark and the Kings20 accelerator scheme at King’s College London (just named the UK’s most Outstanding Entrepreneurial University) have given me invaluable support and guidance, and these communities make starting and growing a business much less daunting and far more enjoyable.\n\nI found that platforms like Kickstarter go a long way towards levelling the playing field for aspiring creators. And, crucially, I discovered outsourcing services that make running a business a really viable option for people who can’t, or don’t want to, work 80 hours a week.\n\nFor example, thanks to the Fulfilment by Amazon service (who pick and pack all of our Amazon orders) I was able to work an average of just half an hour a day after the birth of my first child and turn over more than £100k in the first six months of his life. I discovered that it was possible to run a thriving business that fits flexibly around your other priorities.\n\nWho else is missing out?\n\nI’m not saying that starting a business is easy by any stretch. I know that each entrepreneur will face their own set of unique challenges and will make their own compromises. I am also very aware of my own privilege and the many advantages I have benefited from, simply by being born into a white, middle class family in the UK.\n\nBut why was my perception of entrepreneurs so different to the new reality? Why did I have no idea that entrepreneurship could be an option for me? And who else is missing out on these opportunities because they don’t see people they identify with running businesses?\n\nThese are questions I don’t have the answers to. I know I’d love to play a part in changing the face of entrepreneurship and raising the profile of successful startup leaders who don’t fit classic stereotypes. But what this looks like in practice/action I’m still working out.\n\nI have read that 70,000 people across Britain would like to start up their own businesses but haven’t done so. 28% feel that the process is too complex, and 36% don’t have enough confidence in themselves to go it alone. I want those people to know that it is possible, and that there are many different routes to success.\n\nAsking the big questions\n\nTomorrow I’m going to raise my questions at Number 10 Downing Street.\n\nThrough Kings20 I’ve been invited, along with 10 other entrepreneurs (including the incredible Tobi Oredein of Black Ballad and Ismail Jeilani of Scoodle), to a round table discussion with Jimmy McLoughlin, the Prime Minister’s Special Adviser on business. We’ll be asking what the government could do to promote entrepreneurship to a wider audience.\n\nThis isn’t just good for society, it’s good for business and the economy. My little company Gamely Games now employs several people and has turned over half a million pounds. If we can show more people the flexibility and empowerment that entrepreneurship can offer, imagine what value that could bring - to their lives and to the economy.\n\nI’ve no idea what will come from this meeting at No.10, but I want to be part of the conversation."
