        "text": "\"All the activities delivered were tailored to the age range within the different classes. Annie gripped the children with how she spoke to them, questioned them and how she really projected her voice to engage and create excitement. Annie was flexible towards the timetable she had to work with, the conditions she had (such as moving from the hall to two different classrooms during lunch times) and the weather! (She launched the rocket activity in the rain - going out herself and getting wet whilst the children could stay in and observe! The team were helpful in terms of booking quickly and with a date that suited. We booked last year and had good feedback from children. Just to say how good Annie was and if we book again, I would certainly want her to visit again!!\" - Charlotte Pinchin, Science Workshops for School in Wrenthorpe Academy, Wakefield\n\n\"On behalf of all here at The Priory Witham Academy, I’d like to say a huge thank you for all that you have done for us over the last two days.

All the parents have been really impressed too as the children have all been talking about how much they enjoyed the workshop and it has been great seeing all the children playing with their slime. Some parents have asked how to make the slime as they would like to do it at home. One teacher asked me if Caroline was a trained teacher because her behaviour management was amazing. Lots of the staff were also talking about the experiments in the staff room and were amazed by what they had seen.Caroline did such an amazing job, the main aim was to get everyone talking about science and excited about it and she certainly did that and more! I will recommend her to anyone as will the rest of the staff and the children! Thank you Caroline, you made our science week incredible!\n\nLucy Kane, Jubilee Primary School in North London\n\nWell, what a hit! 'Magnetic Michelle' spent the day with us yesterday at Our Lady Queen of Heaven School, and the children in all the classes had the most exciting, mesmerising scientific experience!

I’m not sure what that says about Bryn but I’m sure it’s all good!\n\nSchool Workshops in Lincoln with Katie and Bryn\n\nI just wanted to let you know that I thought the science day we had with you on Thursday 19th January was fantastic. I managed to be in most of the sessions and all the children were totally involved and engrossed.

The children said that the only thing that would have made it better would be if they could have done it all afternoon! The children held an Enterprise afternoon where in groups they started their own businesses. Over the Easter holidays they researched what they wanted to spend their money on and then voted for their favourite. This is what they chose.\n\nLiz Edge, School Fun Afternoon in Stoke with Crazy Craig\n\nThe whole school loved Tom's energy and enthusiasm (One week later and the children are still talking about him!). He made science 'real life' and fun by showing the children things that they could understand and relate to. Tom had excellent control of the children whilst being able to get them really excited about science. One boy turned to me in the lesson and described his science lesson as 'The best day he has ever had.' We wanted to get the children really excited about science in preparation for national science week. Just a big thank you. The whole day was a fantastic experience and Tom pitched it just right for our children aged between 4 and 7, Even the grown ups were impressed!!!\n\nClaire Williams, School Workshops in Telford, with Tom G\n\nThe pupils had a really good day and I have already had one report handed in this morning explaining what a good time was had by all.
