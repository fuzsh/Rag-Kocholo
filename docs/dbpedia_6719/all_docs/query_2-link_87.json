        "text": "Schizophrenia: The Positive Perspective This fully revised second edition of Schizophrenia: The Positive Perspective uses biographical sketches and essays to discuss schizophrenia and related conditions, providing advice on methods of coping, routes to growth, recovery and well-being, and how schizophrenia can be viewed in a positive light. It also explores the insights of R.D. Laing and discusses how they can be applied to contemporary ideas and research. In this expanded edition Peter Chadwick, a previous sufferer, builds on his earlier edition and introduces new topics including: • Cannabis smoking and schizophrenia. • Psychoanalytic approaches to psychosis an d their extension into the spiritual domain. • Using cognitive behaviour therapy in the treatment of profound existential distress. • How experiences on the edge of madness can be relevant to understanding reality. Schizophrenia: The Positive Perspective encourages hope, confidence and increased selfesteem in schizophrenia sufferers and raises new questions about how schizophrenia should be evaluated. It is important reading for anyone working with schizophrenic people including psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and other mental health professionals. Peter K. Chadwick has lectured in psychology for the universities of Liverpool, Strathclyde, Birkbeck and Goldsmiths Colleges, London, and also for the Open University. He was Professor of Community Psychology at Boston University from 1991 to 1994. He retired from teaching in 2006 and was awarded the DSc by the University of Bristol in 2007 for his research over the past four decades.\n\nSchizophrenia: The Positive Perspective Explorations at the outer reaches of human experience Second edition\n\nPeter K.

Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742–1799) Schizophrenia is a uniquely human disorder and therefore studying it does not so much tell us about a set of aberrant processes in a small, categorically different group of people, it tells us about our very humanity. To suffer from schizophrenia is to be human. This is partly because vulnerability to it is associated also with the workings of the creative process, with language, high sensitivity and imaginativeness generally and in many instances with enhanced spiritual sensitivity and empathy. We could not eliminate schizophrenia as we can eliminate smallpox without doing serious and irreversible damage to our species. Sadly it tends to be psychiatric and residential social workers, day centre staff, nurses and community workers who see this vital positive side to the schizophrenia sufferer rather than professionals and laboratory-based researchers in psychiatry and abnormal psychology. When the former speak, as they do, of sufferers’ ‘uncanny sensitivity’, ‘frightening empathy’ and of how sometimes it is possible to have relationships with schizophrenia sufferers that are far deeper than those they have with so-called ‘normal’ people, we are dealing with things that are usually outside of the beam cast by investigators in empirical science. In this short preface I wish briefly to outline the broad conceptual basis of my approach to this issue and show the theoretical foundations of this text. This preface also will give me a chance to reveal my attitude and stance, to show in which general direction my will is oriented and how I feel emotionally towards this domain of human life. The research I have pursued on this topic over the last three decades has been done largely within the tradition begun by Meehl (1962, 1973) which argues for a genetic predisposition in the sufferers (‘schizotaxia’) producing the so-called ‘schizotaxic brain’ and which in life and development eventuates in a certain personality organisation, the most common usually referred to as ‘schizotypal personality’. This tradition in Britain (Claridge, 1988, 1990, 1997) sees schizophrenia, like hypertension, as a systemic problem with a genetic basis that eventuates in illness under stress and the stresses induced by a certain lifestyle. The genetic basis for schizophrenia, although complex, is now a field of increasing optimism (Cardno and Gottesman, 2000; Arranz et al., 2000; Riley et al., 2003; Kalidindi and Murray, 2004) and there is no evidence that environmental factors alone can cause the illness in a person genetically unrelated to a schizophrenia sufferer. However, there also is no doubt that nurture contributes to the emergence of this illness (Tienari, 1991; Tienari et al., 1994; Cullberg, 2001) and that modifying the environment to which a sufferer returns is vitally important in preventing relapse (Goldstein et al., 1978; Hogarty and Anderson, 1986; Tarrier et al., 1994). Early intervention with people who are showing signs of the disorder is an integral area of research in which education of families and the public, in what to look for, is important (Birchwood et al., 1992; Birchwood, 2000). There is now no justification for a return to 1960s attitudes to the effect that ‘families cause schizophrenia’. I suffered a schizoaffective psychotic crisis myself in 1979 and the\n\nmost critical abusive stresses and experiences that brought this about occurred at the state secondary school I went to and in three of the neighbourhoods where I lived. Although my mother and brother were both highly disturbed, my mother was also a very warm person who, ‘when push came to shove’ as we say in England, was always on my side. Had it not been for abuse at school and in the community I definitely would never have suffered psychosis. Having said this, however, it does seem that adverse childhood and later experiences in a person genetically hard-wired to be highly sensitive to stresses such as criticism and scolding, disrespect, being unwanted, angry outbursts and so on can eventuate the schizotaxic vulnerability to this illness (Myhrman et al., 1994; Tienari et al., 1994). Life inevitably involves abuse from time to time, but only about 1 per cent of people become schizophrenic; clearly something more than the vicissitudes of living is required. In the light of the fact that the pendulum in research internationally has swung first from environmentalism (‘mind with no brain’) to biochemical reductionism (‘brain with no mind’), it now rests pretty well between these misguided earlier extremes and both genetic and constitutional vulnerability as well as environmental and cognitive, emotional and motivational factors are recognised as important in explanation and recovery (Corr, 2006). The particular approach I therefore am using in this book is the so-called vulnerabilitystress-coping model (see also Anthony and Liberman, 1986 and Levin, 2006 on this) within a bio-psycho-social-spiritual rationale. I am taking it that the genetic vulnerability involves many genes, usually of small to moderate effect (‘polygenic theory’) and that these genes are widely distributed in the population. Some ‘vulnerability’ genes may actually be involved in such things as pattern detection, remote associative thinking, perceptual sensitivity and creative and linguistic imaginativeness and meaning seeking generally. Hence we are all ‘a little schizophrenic’, it is part and parcel of the human condition and may indeed be why we are such an imaginative and creative, inventive species (and such a talkative species) as we are. Tim Crow has argued (Crow et al., 1989) that the asymmetry of the human brain, and hence the emergence of language skills, was a speciation event in human evolution and that psychosis is the uniquely human condition that it is because of this. Again, this approach argues that we have schizophrenia because we are human. The particular gene combinations and interactions that make a person seriously vulnerable to actual schizophrenic illness – where, as I found myself, the brain– mind system goes tonically out of control in a kind of positive feedback spiral and the agentic sense of Self as being in control of one’s own mind is completely lost – seem to be a threat only to about 10 per cent of the population. Nonetheless, the distribution is graded and to some degree psychosis-proneness is part of what we are as human beings and can be seen as an actual dimension of personality along which we all sit at various points (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1976) (although the Eysencks do not focus on schizotypy). A genetic model compatible with a dimensional view of psychosis has been proposed by Roberts and Claridge (1991). This so-called ‘normalisation’ perspective I am adopting here also is used by Kingdon and Turkington (1994). This conceptualisation of schizophrenia sees sufferers as kith and kin with the rest of humanity, sees madness as not essentially an alien state experientially but something that everybody, because of their humanity, has at least a slight inkling of at some time in their lives. Schizophrenia, in my view, and as a sufferer who has known it from the inside, is\n\nessentially an exaggeration of normal processes that interweave with toxic results for one’s well-being and, on many occasions, for one’s very willingness to stay alive at all. Despite the portentousness of this illness and the severe distress associated with it, the general climate in the research community is clearly optimistic (Harrison et al., 2001; Hirsch and Weinberger, 2003). The real pessimism is about the gap between the actual technology and procedures that truly are available to help schizophrenia sufferers (and to prevent the exacerbation of distress into illness) and the actual provision of services to patients (Craig et al., 2003). The plight of many schizophrenia sufferers and indeed the attitudes of the public towards them is a disgrace to the Western world. We see here how ignorance is the fuel of fear and prejudice. Also, because sufferers can so easily be assessed as less capable than they are, real physical illnesses can be very easily missed and misdiagnosed as ‘depression’ or ‘demoralisation’. Mistakes like these can be fatal. This book tries to reflect the optimism which we researchers do nonetheless feel about our attempts to understand and to help but, more than this, also talks in addition about the positive qualities of the schizophrenia-prone mind. It is now clear that personality dimensions other than the schizotypal, such as paranoid, schizoid and hypomanic personality styles (O’Flynn et al., 2003) lie on a dimension where schizophrenia and schizoaffective illness are the extremes. The picture, however, now is complicated by the fact of the normality of the personalities of many people who go on to suffer schizophrenia (Peralta et al., 1991). Clearly this condition can, and does, eventuate from our ‘humanness’, it is as heterogeneous as is the species and it can strike in very unpredictable ways. It is in no sense a sign of the character weakness of the victim. In this text I will present material on schizophrenia induced toxically by cannabis smoking (Chapter 4), an issue, of course, of great public concern these days; on the paths in and out of my own 1979 schizoaffective episode (Chapters 5 and 6); on schizotypy and paranoia (personality styles particularly at risk) (Chapters 8 and 10); and on the experience of ‘psychotic phenomena’, such as hallucinations, in a person who in no other way is above the threshold of psychiatric morbidity (Chapter 9). This latter instance is an issue first raised by Romme and Escher (1993). The book centrally is a study in experiential and phenomenological psychology and psychiatry and is critically concerned with ways of coping, ways of preventing illness and paths to recovery. In talking of recovery to a good and worthwhile quality of life with meaning and purpose (Anthony et al., 2003; Ramon et al., 2007), I am stressing here the value also of understanding the causes of the illness to the prevention of its reoccurrence and to inner nourishment, selfenlightenment and personal growth. In my own case my approach was that if I could understand and explain how my illness happened, I could make things so that it would never happen again – and it worked. I also tried to see meaning in the illness and related it to my spiritual life. Patients do involve themselves in causal thinking about their illness and the attributions they make have a major impact on stigma and recovery (Charles et al., 2007 and references therein). In the later parts of the text (Chapters 12 and 13) I talk more of issues such as peer support (see also Lawn et al., 2007 on this) and psychotherapeutic interventions in psychosis with a positive slant being put on the insights of R.D. Laing, whose contribution (e.g. Laing, 1990/1960) I feel was marred by, and underestimated in its value by, his adoption of too extreme a stance on therapy. This part of the book also calls for still more integration in therapy approaches and also outlines a basis for mutual\n\ndialogue between therapists concerned with spiritual, existential, psychoanalytic and cognitive issues. The issue of the ‘schizophrenia’ label itself, given how dreadfully stigmatising for sufferers it has become (May, 2000; Dickerson et al., 2002), is addressed in Chapter 2, where I argue that ‘neuro-integrative disorder’ or perhaps ‘neuro-integrative relatedness disorder’ probably would be better and far more accurate terms (see also Levin, 2006 on this). Although I do not believe that many things for which psychiatry has diagnostic categories are illnesses, I have no doubt that psychosis is an illness, though it can, of course, take many forms. There is a group of researchers, chiefly in psychology and psychotherapy, who challenge this view (see Boyle, 2002; Sanders, 2007) but my own experience and research does not lead me to ally myself with them (Chadwick, 2007a). I admit, however, that current forms of chemotherapy are not satisfactory, by any means, for all patients and that psychological, psychosocial and spiritual interventions, as I have found myself, are of enormous benefit to recovery (see P.D.J. Chadwick and Lowe, 1990; Garety et al., 1998; Martindale et al., 2003; Morrison et al., 2004; Mosher, 2004; P.D.J. Chadwick, 2006). I do, however, believe that in the future better, individually targeted medication, based on individual DNA analyses, will massively brighten the future for schizophrenia sufferers. In my case the drug haloperidol, actually quite an old, typical neuroleptic invented by Paul Janssen in 1958 and first marketed in 1961, accidentally was, for me, the nearest thing one could ever have to a perfectly individually targeted medication for schizophrenia. I was transferred to it from chlorpromazine in November 1981 and the moment the drug ‘hit’ in my brain I thought to myself (reflecting on the agonies of my past), ‘It’s all over’. I have never looked back since that moment in my life. I went on to obtain a second PhD, in psychology, stayed in work for 25 years and eventually was awarded the DSc for my research. I married in 1983 and my wife and I own a lovely bungalow in the countryside. We love each other unthinkingly and have been together for over 25 years. My life was completely revolutionised by that medication, which far from reducing me to a societally conforming zombie has enabled me to feel more true to myself than I was before – and has not damaged my creativity. The possibility, and indeed the actuality, that psychosis can lead on to one becoming better than one was before, of course very much a Laingian dream, has been addressed by a number of authors (Silverman, 1980; Chadwick, 2002a; Attwood, 2007). For this reason I believe that the research, in genetics and psychopharmacology, for better – and eventually individually – targeted medications is a research thrust of enormous promise. It has my full support. I have no enthusiasm whatsoever for movements, which do exist, towards ‘drug-free psychiatry’. Were they to become successful, people like me would very quickly be in the graveyard. Sadly, in the present state of our knowledge, medication, including haloperidol, is not helpful for everybody. In the end, medication or no medication, everyone has to find their own path to peace and to quality in their lives. Sometimes, as in my own case, this may require a total revision in almost every aspect of the way one lives, the work one does and the people with whom one mixes. Even with well-targeted medication, there are no easy ways of getting out of schizophrenic illness. This book tries to show the other side of the coin from a focus on deficit and dysfunction and I hope will be encouraging to all people in any way touched by schizophrenia and related conditions. After all, if there is no ‘other\n\nside to the coin’ all one can do is ‘make the best of a bad job’, as we say in England. But this is not how I see schizophrenia or indeed psychosis in general. Hence this text. In closing I would like to thank certain colleagues who have, in one way or another, supported and encouraged my research over the decades. I would particularly like to thank David Carless, Isabel Clarke, Gordon Claridge, Philip Corr, Tim Crow, Kevin Dutton, Steven Hirsch, Guy Holmes, Areti Karytopoulou, Craig Newnes, Emmanuelle Peters and John Wilding. My great thanks also go out to Sylvia Ross, who typed this work with incredible speed and efficiency, as well as excellent compassionate understanding of its contents, and of course to my wife Jill – who has always accepted me for what I am, not for what I ought to be or should be. The one-liners at the chapter heads, in the body of the text, are my own ideas and opinions and are really an outgrowth of my relationship with Jill. The book could not exist without the support of the people in its pages who volunteered to expose their ‘psychological innards’ and experiences to the world. I am especially grateful to Travis Parker and Terry Hammond for their excellent pemanship in Chapters 3 and 4 but also to the other members of The Borderliners Group, formed by Desmond Marshall and myself in March 1992: Simon Blair, Geoff Garfield, Jonathan Smith and Ivo Wiesner. Their support of myself and my research over the years has been invaluable. Finally I also would like to thank my many thousands of students in psychology that I have taught, at various institutes during my nomadic life, since October 1975. They have educated me as much as, if not more than, I have educated them. Joanne Forshaw, who suggested this project of a second edition to me in the spring of 2007, has been an excellently understanding and efficient editor, almost always accessible and speedy in reply. For a writer such things are so important. Though I speak well of medication in this preface, hope is as important as any pill. This book tries centrally to write about people’s humanity, about ‘the taste of the soup’, as Einstein would put it, rather than ‘the formula of the soup’. In doing so I am trying to bring the people in its pages alive to the reader as flesh and blood human beings, not as organic machines. This book then is essentially a person-oriented approach rather than a reductionistic one. Perhaps recognising how schizophrenia (or neuro-integrative relatedness disorder) is an emergent phenomenon from our very humanity will help people to see that only by working together, rather than by stigmatising sufferers as alien freaks, can we minimise the cost of this illness in human suffering and move on to a position where sufferers have meaningful, purposeful lives.\n\nPeter K.

People do not follow logic, they follow magic. In the early 1960s, when I first started reading psychology and thinking psychologically, I’d be about 16 at the time, it really did look as if psychology could change the world. In those days Skinner, Eysenck, Broadbent and Rogers were soaring to prominence. The ambience was upbeat and bullish. We genuinely felt that we could ‘crack the code’ of the human mind, shape human behaviour, understand people’s deepest fears and aspirations and bring harmony and peace to the planet. The future was not physics, it was psychology! I write now in 2007/8, in my seventh decade. I am a student-battered, script-battered, seminar-battered old-timer. I no longer believe it. At least I no longer believe it of psychology as it is. What psychology could be is another matter and there my hopes are greater. In this first chapter I am trying to say that psychology needs to embrace, not scorn, the insights of the spiritually minded, the mystical, the pre-psychotic and even be prepared to listen to ‘The Impossible’ from the psychotic (and indeed from the Surrealist artist) if it is fully to understand mind and person and our place in the general scheme of things. The problem of psychology’s relevance as an endeavour is that the positivistic attitude of the mainstream of the subject simply doesn’t have the breadth and scope to embrace the world’s problems. It has become yet another intellectual box fighting, in the epistemological evolutionary game of things, for supremacy in its physics-imitating perspective. ‘Give us power!’ the establishment seems implicitly to shout, ‘We’re like physics!’ This is in a world of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus in their hundreds of millions. What, one might ask, does a white middle class or upper middle class Western psychologist, steeped in (so-called) Enlightenment rationalism, evidencebased practice and a leafy suburb ideology of scientific humanism know of the mindsets and mind contents of the warring factions of the Middle East? What do they really know of any spiritually guided large communities such as those of India, Pakistan, Uganda, Nigeria or southern United States? Telling these peoples, whose cultures greatly value intuition and revelation, to ‘wise up to the truths of materialistic science’, forget their ‘silly, vacuous, mystical ideas’ and embrace the (supposed) certainties of reason, fact and evidence (itself a rather nineteenth-century view of science) is psychologically not a viable proposition. Assuming that secularism is ‘The Truth’ and that religion will ‘just have to move over’ is simply not how people and the world work. To think like that is intellectually childish – and the twentieth century has shown us anyway that laboratory focused, analytical reasoning based ideologies do not give us the certainty that positivists so prize as central. One has to ask, ‘What is a human mind that it can have spiritual – and indeed schizophrenic – experiences?’ One needs to know why such experiences of feeling open\n\nSchizophrenia: the positive perspective\n\n2\n\nas if to forces from beyond ourselves are so compelling, why they can be both dangerous and personally nourishing and what value they have for us as a group of communities here on this earth. Rather than spiritual experiences being merely a secondary functional product of our capacity to believe, might they – and some of the insights of the borderline psychotic and psychotic – not be a primary capacity that enables us to resonate to or ‘tune in’ to forces or dimensions at present beyond our understanding? As some would put it, do they enable us to see ‘the other side of the carpet’? A hostile critic might say, as indeed such people do, ‘This is not science!’ or ‘You are moving away from science!’ However, as my own ideas have settled over the decades, I cannot agree with such accusations. The word ‘science’ derives from the Latin word scientia which means ‘knowledge’. As a scientist I am a knowledge-seeker and any science must use methods appropriate to its subject matter, not merely copy physics. It is not the job of a psychologist merely to find facts – where a fact is what a true theory states – but to enhance our understanding of mind and person in the cosmic scheme of things. It must recognise our capacities as symbol and metaphor users, as seekers of that which is beyond rationality and logic and also facilitate the possibilities of person. Of course, as we move away from the materialistic to mentalism, to art, to the multicoloured world of madness, to spirituality, our language runs the risk of becoming less precise and exact. Perhaps Wittgenstein would warn us not to speak at all but remain silent? However, the root word of both ‘experiment’ and ‘experience’ is the Latin experiri which means ‘try’. I think we should at least try and that it would be intellectually unadventurous not to do so. The admittedly ambitious integrative discourse I am proposing for such an understanding, in trying to make psychology relevant and valuable to everybody, is that of a blend of the rational side of science with art and with spirituality. This ‘scientia’ (science–art–spirituality) discourse has, as its aim, the seeking of knowledge, using both experience and experiment, in the service of broadening the actual attitude of psychology out from its current fetish with positivism, materialism and atheism. Seeking generalised facts about human nature from very large samples, the ‘nomothetic’ way, ignores the nuance and subtlety of evidence at the level of the individual person. Therefore in this book findings will be referred to both from nomothetic and from idiographic sources. It may indeed be that it is only at the level of the single case, the idiographic level, that we can see how different levels of description interact and interweave to produce the thoughts, feelings and behaviours that they do. All of the great mathematicians and scientists have prized the value of intuition and revelation – as if it is possible for knowledge to come in ‘on another channel’ than that of narrowly focused analytical reasoning. These might be said to be insights had in ‘altered states’, however transient or long-lasting they might be. How, in the general business of life, do we assess such insights as laying claim to knowledge? Some truths, such as, ‘You reap what you sow’, ‘Time waiteth for no man’ and ‘A man on tiptoe is bound to fall over’ we seem to accept as self-evident. On other occasions insights that have the quality of being reversals have a knack of commanding people’s respect. ‘Love your enemies’ (Jesus); ‘She who hesitates is won’ (Wilde) … statements like that somehow don’t propel us to seek the evidence of science for their acceptance as valuable to the general conduct of human affairs. They are fresh, different, clever and in a sense shock us by their novelty in comparison to the tired old platitudes to which we are used.\n\nIntroduction: in defence of spirituality, mysticism and madness\n\n3\n\nAlso statements from highly esteemed authorities, such as Einstein’s ‘Imagination is more important than knowledge’ or Churchill’s ‘The optimist looks for opportunities in every difficulty, the pessimist looks for difficulties in every opportunity’, carry weight as people infer their value via the very success-in-life of the people who utter them. In this sense the statements have been ‘tested by life’ in a kind of ‘I got where I am today by thinking like this’ fashion. The very success also of a spiritual teacher may be taken as a sign of the truth of what they say, as of course some in the humanities and social sciences say in addition of Freud and Jung. Ideas tested by millions in life over decades can override those tested on thousands in snapshot laboratory studies. Obviously when faced with claims to knowledge and truth we must think but also feel carefully. Coherence; generalisibility; plausibility; explanatory power; testability; novelty; the insight it brings to matters previously puzzling; relevance to current concerns; ideational beauty and elegance; practical value; clarity; accessibility, all in different measure in different circumstances are important. Like psychoanalysis, the insights of the spiritual quester, the mystic and the psychotic access and inhabit such an intimate and precious realm of the human psyche that the usual, rather impatient methods of impersonal science are often crass in their evaluation. However, just as psychoanalysis has moved on and is not, as some would have us believe, still chained to 1890s thinking (see Stern, 1985; Tyson and Tyson, 1990; Milton et al., 2004) it is perfectly legitimate for insights that span, in their claims, the breadth of mind and life, to be assessed by the relevant ‘interest community’. Such insights cannot be shot down by a singular experiment but over the decades they are put to work and assessed in the complex engine room of life. Spiritual insights and those had on the edges of madness tend to have a status, growth and movement in life that is amoeba-like. They are not targets for ‘do or die’ critical experiments as utterances such as ‘The Universe is one Great Thought’ (Sir Arthur Eddington) or that from a psychotic patient I know: ‘Don’t try and climb rain or sweep sun off the pavement’, are often at a metalevel that does not give access to such things. In the end we move forward in the knowledge quest as best we can, always adjusting methods and approaches to the subject matter. It may be somewhat messy but it is all we can do. It is just life. In the chapters that follow, writ large will be experiences in altered states of consciousness from the drug-induced to the psychotic. We will explore to the limits of human phenomenology but in saying this I have to confess that qualitative investigations of this kind that I have conducted over the decades have provided me personally with at least as much nourishment for the conduct of life and for the apprehension of mind and reality as all the thousands of papers I have read in empirical science these last 47 years (since beginning science A level study) that were essentially predicated on (what is often taken to be) the Pythagorean belief that ‘all is number’. One must wonder at the outset that there is some important truth to be derived from this.\n\nChapter 2 Demystifying madness and mystifying sanity In dreaming, aspects of reality are incorporated into the dream; in delusion, aspects of one’s past, and of fantasy, are incorporated into the reality. Although it is a mistake to believe that R.D. Laing thought the sane to be mad and the mad sane, Laing did try to show that insanity was at least intelligible and hence that schizophrenia sufferers are kith and kin with the rest of humanity and not a categorically different group of people. In this book I am taking the Laingian argument (see Laing, 1990/1960, 1990/1967, 1970) a step further by arguing that the processes involved in schizophrenia are in themselves quite normal processes but that a concatenation of them, in a person in a certain catalytic situation, will produce what we see as psychosis. They are like chemicals, harmless in themselves, that are toxic or explosive when combined together. This, in itself, is, I think, one particular way in which one can put a positive and less stigmatising slant or perspective on schizophrenia. But there are others. ‘DEEP TRUTH’ Another aspect of the thinking of Laing and also of Carl Jung – although neither of them articulated it very fully or clearly – is that psychosis, or at least the very edges of psychosis, where one might be said to be ‘supersane’ rather than insane, can give one a profound insight into the nature of reality. This is a very fragile state on the penumbra of madness where the boundary between within and without is dissolved or partially dissolved and the state of consciousness changes such that the uncanny becomes the rule rather than the exception. I call this ‘The Borderline’ (one might also refer to it as ‘Tertiary Process’) and I had first-hand knowledge of it myself, independently of Laing and Jung, on my way to a schizoaffective psychotic episode in London in 1979. Although Jung has written on these matters (see Chapter 7), his colleague, quantum physicist Wolfgang Pauli (see Jung and Pauli, 1955), was concerned that Jung did not really understand his own discovery nor that he had got it particularly clear in his mind (Laurikainen, 1988). In Chapter 7 I try to unpack the experience at The Borderline as I remember it myself to present the case for this, admittedly very controversial, view as clearly as I can manage. This very precious state of consciousness is more akin to ‘superphrenia’ (Karlsson, 1972) than schizophrenia but is one also with its own dangers. Indeed most who venture there either do not return or return at a heavy price (Greenberg et al., 1992). ‘RECOVERABILITY’ A third perspective on schizophrenia of a generally more positive tone is one that focuses on the educability and ‘recoverability’ of the person. It is quite wrong, and indeed counter-therapeutic, to regard this disorder as inevitably a life-destroying phenomenon. Psychotic illness can at times be a creative illness, as it was for Freud and Jung\n\nDemystifying madness and mystifying sanity\n\n5\n\n(Ellenberger, 1994/1970) and there are occasions when patients not only get well, they go on to become better still with time such that they become better than they were before (Silverman, 1980; Chadwick 2002a and Chapter 6 this volume). Harding et al. (1987a, 1987b, 1988) have shown that schizophrenia does not have to have a deteriorating course and found that about 50 per cent of schizophrenic patients were classifiable as ‘cured’ or only slightly disabled. Patients treated in certain therapeutic communities where the philosophy has been that the illness offers possibilities for growth and integration tend to have markedly better capacities for independent living than those treated only by medication (see Mosher and Menn, 1978; Bola and Mosher, 2003; Mosher, 2004). The tractability of psychotic symptoms to psychological and psychosocial interventions is now becoming very apparent (see Chapter 13) and education of both families and patients about psychosis is extremely helpful (Atkinson et al., 1996; Freeman et al., 2006). It also is not therapeutically damaging for patients to increase, by private reading, their own knowledge about schizophrenic illness (MacPherson et al., 1996). It is quite wrong to assume that reading about psychosis will itself cause problems for those closely involved. THE BENEFITS OF PSYCHOSIS-PRONENESS A fourth positive perspective on schizophrenia relates more directly to the positive capacities there imbricated into the very proneness to the illness itself. A delusional episode may be a release of a fiction-making capacity and betray considerable imaginative inventiveness (Chadwick, 2005c) as well as giving an individual the feeling that they are at least a person of consequence (Storr, 1958). Patients often report that a delusion made life exciting and spectacular and took them away from a boring existence (Chadwick, 1992, 2006a) while others have ‘successful’ delusions which protect them chronically against unbearable intrapsychic anguish. Such chronically successful delusions also can protect against depression and give the person a feeling of considerable purpose and meaning in life (Roberts, 1991). At the physical level Brüne (2004) discusses work that shows also that schizophrenia sufferers have a greater activity of killer cells that could give them a greater resistance against infectious diseases. This advantage also seems to be possessed by their relatives. Individuals who score higher than normal people on psychometrically assessed paranoia also score higher than them on empathy (Chadwick, 1988, 1997a, p. 140) and diagnosed paranoid patients are better than normal controls at the detection of lying (La Russo, 1978). Schizotypal individuals have generally been found to be higher (than nonschizotypals) in creative fluency and flexibility of thought (Schuldberg et al., 1988; Poreh et al., 1993; Chadwick, 1997a) as have non-paranoid schizophrenic patients (Keefe and Magaro, 1980), and the number of outstanding creative individuals over the course of history who have been thought to possess a paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal or schizophrenic disposition is huge (see Post, 1994, 1996; Chadwick, 1997a, p. 16). John Nash, Ludwig Wittgenstein and James Joyce are those most frequently mentioned in the psychological and psychoanalytic literature although Einstein also had schizophrenia in his family. John Nash himself said (ABI, 2007):\n\nSchizophrenia: the positive perspective\n\n6\n\nI would not dare to say that there is a direct relation between mathematics and madness, but there is no doubt that great mathematicians suffer from maniacal characteristics, delirium and symptoms of schizophrenia. It is important to note that although Nash suffered schizophrenia from 1959, his ability to produce mathematics of the highest quality did not leave him (ABI, 2007). He made a recovery in the 1990s, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1994, with Harsanyi and Selten, for his work on game theory and did say of himself that he wouldn’t consider himself recovered if he could not still produce good things in his work (ABI, 2007, p. ccxci). James Joyce, whose daughter Lucia does seem to have suffered the illness, was a man of phenomenal linguistic ability generally but of singularly unstable temperament – though he was supported, emotionally, a great deal by his brother. Certainly as the publication of Ulysses approached, Joyce’s paranoid fears about people he had mentioned scornfully in the book, with only thinly veiled identities, were reaching near-psychotic intensity (Ellmann, 1982/1959, pp. 516–18; Chadwick, 2001a, p. 50). Interestingly Wittgenstein, a man of the most extreme intellectual intensity and rigour, was also a man who was said to have about him a somewhat distant, other-worldly, mystical ambience (Edmonds and Eidinow, 2002). When a person says, as Wittgenstein did, that it is very difficult, when confronted with great art, to say anything that is better than saying nothing at all, one knows that this is someone who is far more than a rationality machine. Jung, a man who seems to have had more acquaintance with psychotic experience than he was comfortable in admitting, also of course was prepared to confront the uncanny and the ineffable to a degree far beyond that dared by traditionally minded scientists. The enhanced spiritual sensitivity of schizophrenia-prone people has, since the work of Buckley (1981; Buckley and Galanter, 1979), been a topic of considerable recent research (Chadwick, 1992, 1997a, 1997b, 2001c, 2002b; Jackson, 1997, 2001; Clarke, 2001, 2002). It is in fact becoming apparent that having a personality organisation that has a high loading on a dimension conferring vulnerability to psychosis in no way means that the person has a dysfunctional existence. Their lives may indeed be enhanced in quality over those of their more sober peers (McCreery and Claridge, 1995; Jackson, 1997). Even people right ‘on the edge’ do not have to be seen as a mass of deficits, dysfunctions and disorders (see also Gergen, 1990 on this). The artist Andy Warhol once said: Sometimes people having nervous breakdown problems can look very beautiful because they have that fragile something to the way they walk or move. They put out a mood that makes them more beautiful. (Warhol, 2007/1975, p. 64) In this book we are exploring out to the very edges of the phenomenology of person, to the edges – as did the Surrealists (see Short, 1994) – of what it is possible for a person to think and experience at all. I feel, therefore, that it is valuable for us to see, in the sense of ‘grounding’ us in the here and now, how the processes involved in such a venture relate to those operative in everyday life. This takes us back to the first perspective mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.\n\nDemystifying madness and mystifying sanity\n\n7\n\nTHE NORMAL INGREDIENTS OF MADNESS One of the processes that goes awry in psychosis is so-called confirmation bias (Wason, 1960; Chadwick, 1992). This is the seeking of evidence and ideas that confirm a belief while relatively neglecting that which discredits it. It is doubtful that any scientific theory or indeed religion, political stance, business plan or rationale for anything in life could be created without confirmation bias. I even have suggested (Chadwick, 1992) that it could be itself an anti-entropic force in nature working against the relentless drift physically to disorder. In a way it is an aspect of pattern detection and feeds on confirming inferences and imaginings and on ‘going beyond the information given’. All of these things are part of the repertoire of cognitive skills needed for creativity – but in madness they seem to go into some kind of overdrive such that the person finds ‘fitting’ confirmations relentlessly. As Bertrand Russell once said, ‘When a scientist has his [sic] theory that’s alright, but when the theory has him the door is open to madness’. This feeling of being the vehicle, puppet or pawn of a belief correlates with the amplification of confirmation bias and can take a person careering to destruction or self-destruction (see Chapter 5). Under feelings of terrible threat, as sufferers of paranoid forms of delusion often are, the person may have the arousal level and hypervigilance of a threatened beast. Imagine being a pro-democracy suspect in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. How would you feel? Given the nature of their beliefs it is not surprising that deluded subjects often jump to conclusions (see Garety and Freeman, 1999) and are generally cognitively impulsive, prone to ‘fear the worst’ in the face of actual threat (Chadwick, 1992) and prone to overgeneralising from singular instances – confirmation bias again manifesting itself in a different guise. There is a kind of normality in the frenetic cognitive style of delusional psychosis understandable given what pressure they think they are under. These biases (rather than deficits (Bentall, 1994)) in style can be retained, if to a reduced degree, when they are empirically tested after their episode. This is the operation of a kind of ‘hangover effect’ (Chadwick, 2006a). People on the margins of, or in, psychotic states often hear things that have not been said or occasionally see things that are not there. In an intriguing experiment by Skinner (1957) a tape of random speech sounds (‘phonemes’) was played to normal people from behind a partition. Participants nonetheless ‘heard’ meaningful sentences and phrases in the essentially random input. If one takes out a speech sound (for example ‘to’) in a tape and replaces it with a cough, then on playing the tape including the phrase ‘go – the shop’, people will nonetheless ‘hear’ the excised sound (Warren, 1970). It is in our natures as human beings to try to make sense out of the stimulation we receive (Gregory, 1970). We do this by adding to and even rearranging that stimulation, particularly in unclear or noisy conditions. None of these so-called ‘top-down’ processes is abnormal. It even is possible, though the effect is slight and comes through, to the extent it does, under suboptimal conditions, for normal people to ‘see’ that which they imagine (Perky, 1910). Some degree of hallucinatory capacity is there in normal people and we would be perceptually incapacitated without it (Sekuler and Blake, 1985). We use it to fill gaps in the data we receive and make confusing data more understandable to us. Context and expectancy effects can enhance these tendencies in normal people and patients alike. The processes are particularly likely to be amplified and exaggerated, however, in those who,\n\nSchizophrenia: the positive perspective\n\n8\n\nfor one reason or another, are in a minority or stigmatised group. Such people feel under threat and hence have to anticipate danger and second-guess potential enemies. This can easily lead to overactive imaginations. Blaming other people also is, in itself, a very convenient way of protecting self-esteem and this perfectly understandable process has been found to be operative in paranoid patients (Kaney and Bentall, 1989; Kinderman, 1994). Readers who have never suffered psychosis would benefit in their understanding if they empathised with the kind of situation in which patients find themselves. For example: imagine that you are a spy and you have obtained information that MI6 are ‘onto you’ and intend to find, arrest and detain you that day. It is instructive to try to live the day with that belief in mind. Alternatively, if that is too stressful, try a ‘delusion’ that ‘people can hear my thoughts’ and see how much confirmation you can pick up for that idea in one, preferably busy, day. It is hardly surprising that patients, psychologically hurt by confirmations, often eventually decide not to seek out further evidence but to withdraw into the isolation of their room or flat – a so-called ‘safety behaviour’ (Freeman and Garety, 2004a, 2004b). One might say ‘anybody would’. There is no doubt that, often, knowing more and more about the context of a person’s psychosis tends to make it seem much less crazy. ‘Craziness’ is an inference we make when we don’t really understand. Others who have written positively of psychosis (e.g. Curtis et al., 2001) have celebrated the enhancement of creativity and imaginative and emotional vitality as insanity approached. Martyn (2002) also stresses in research on self-management of schizophrenia that patients greatly value having a positive perspective on their capacities and experiences rather than indwelling within a disease and degeneration discourse. Clearly the discourse that professionals encapsulate a patient or service user’s problems within can sometimes make that person’s difficulties worse. Though researchers may scorn psychotic people’s tendency to see meaning in coincidences, they should reflect on how discovering a coincidence in conversation with someone can emotionally ‘lift’ that conversation. We all naturally see meaning and magic in coincidences. It is one of the many things that make life worth living. It seems unlikely that the actual content of psychotic thoughts is relevant to their assessment as psychotic. Science fiction and fantasy writers, writers of espionage novels and Hollywood screen writers all have ideas as wild or indeed wilder than any psychotic patient. The writer, however, is the agent of his or her ideas and takes them as constructed fiction not detected fact. In psychosis, by way of contrast, you don’t ‘think a delusion’, the delusion ‘thinks you’ and hence it is not the belief but the manner in which the belief is held that is critical to the ‘psychosis’ assessment (Chadwick, 1992, p. 3, 2007a; see also Bennett, 1964; Toulmin, 1972 and Moor and Tucker, 1979 on this). It would be wrong, however, to assume that patients hold to their beliefs and ‘that’s that’. Firstly they do not necessarily hold them with complete and sustained conviction (Garety, 1985; Garety and Hemsley, 1994) and secondly it does seem, following early work by Beck (1952), Watts et al. (1973), Alford et al. (1982) and Rudden et al. (1982), that delusions are indeed amenable and open to challenge, discussion and even refutation – after careful examination of the evidence for them (see Chapter 13). In addition there are\n\nDemystifying madness and mystifying sanity\n\n9\n\nmany people who suffer hallucinations who show no other sign of psychiatric morbidity (Romme and Escher, 1993) and hallucinations, even in psychosis sufferers, need not always be pre-emptively negative (Morrison et al., 2004, p. 136). JETTISONING THE SCHIZOPHRENIA LABEL A final positive perspective on schizophrenia is one which sees the end of the ‘schizophrenia’ label itself as being in sight (Van Os, 2006). At Bath in 2007 the ISPS did indeed decide to drop the term ‘schizophrenia’ from its title. It is true that a general distinction is possible between those who suffer psychosis more as a mood disorder (manic depression, hypomania etc.) and those who suffer it more as a disorder of perception, cognition and organisation of the Self (schizophrenia). It also has been known for some time that subtypes of schizophrenia map onto equivalent subtypes in schizotypy (Liddle, 1987; Venables and Bailes, 1994) and research into fundamental processes such as latent inhibition (inhibition of attention to a stimulus that has no consequences) gives powerful support to a continuum from control subjects to schizotypy to schizophrenia (see Gray et al., 2002, especially p. 273 and references therein and studies in O’Flynn et al., 2003). However, the actual term has become so stigmatising for those involved that it has become a burden of crippling proportions (Dickerson et al., 2002). The diagnosis as a description of a disease entity is far less successful as a guide to therapy than a focus on symptoms (Persons, 1986; Bentall et al., 1988; Morrison, 2002; Morrison et al., 2004) and seems therefore to have more legal and political relevance and relevance to the insurance industry than appropriateness as a guide to prognosis, help, coordination of services and intervention (Sanders, 2007; ISPS Newsletter, June 2007). The separation of cognitive and mood elements also is in practice extremely difficult to make and, as in my own case, a catchall diagnosis of ‘schizoaffective psychosis’ often captures the clinical picture more accurately. This is particularly so in view of research that suggests emotional problems may underlie seemingly purely ‘cognitive’ disturbances (e.g. Zigler and Glick, 1988; Kinderman, 1994; Kinderman and Bentall, 1996). This is consistent with much research that shows the importance of socio-emotional factors on cognitive development and self-reflective capacities (e.g. Fonaghy and Target, 1997; Scheidt et al., 1999). The general concept of psychosis itself (as a failure to discriminate reality from fantasy), einpsychose (unitary psychosis) or perhaps ‘neuro-integrative’ or ‘neurointegrative relatedness disorder’ all seem to me to have more survival value as terms and would be less socially discriminating. There also is less chance of such categories being confused with dissociative identity disorder. Difficulties in integration and relatedness are central features of the processes underlying schizophrenic illness, which indeed is more ‘loose mindedness’ than ‘split mindedness’. It is particularly because of such problems that the mystic and creative are seen as ‘swimming’ while the psychotic is ‘drowning’. While it is likely true that lower inhibition in semantic networks can allow psychosisprone individuals to often emit compellingly original remote associative ideas (Duchene et al., 1998), for effective creative work these ideas need synthesising and organising into an integrative framework. Here is where arts therapies can be so useful, and as well, via the relationship with the therapist, useful in enhancing relatedness (see Thomson, 1989; Learmonth, 2003; Rooney, 2003).\n\nSchizophrenia: the positive perspective\n\n10\n\nThough I say that madness is the result of a concatenation of essentially normal processes, this does not at all mean that madness, any more than the phenomenon of chemical explosion, does not exist. However, the evidence for a continuum existing from normality to psychosis (Strauss, 1969; Van Os et al., 2000; Van Os, 2006), and the present-day focus on component processes, does indicate that a label originating as a categorisation of a disease entity which is supposedly trauma-independent and to be treated only by physical methods is one that is rapidly outliving its usefulness given the inappropriateness of the disease concept to schizophrenia (Morrison et al., 2004) and the highly negatively charged and misleading associations that have come to be attached to the diagnosis (see also discussion in Levin, 2006). The emphasis on neuro-integrative difficulties also presents a diagnosis less reducible to insulting terms such as ‘schizo’ and ‘psycho’. In practice this is far from a trivial consideration (Antoniou, 2007). In view of the way this book will often discuss the engagement (and disengagement) of mystical and psychotic thought, it is sobering, in light of the above, to find that mystico-religious beliefs, many of which psychiatrists might routinely classify as ‘psychotic’, are also widespread in non-clinical populations (Peters et al., 1999; Peters, 2001). It also is now well known (Cox and Cowling, 1989) that belief in the paranormal and supernatural is widespread in such populations. It is sad that the professions of psychiatry and psychology are not, as a rule, at all sympathetic to ‘atmospheric’ thinking of that kind and tend to pathologise it, much to the disgruntlement of patients and their families. In terms of the ancient Oriental distinction between Yin and Yang, the feminine and the masculine, the general ambience of these endeavours is one of Yangian ‘intellectual machismo’ (Chadwick 2007b and Appendix II in this volume) such that work that dares to stray away from the safe valley of human experience, where Freud’s ‘secondary process’ of clear, rational, analytical thought dominates, is often classified as ‘occult’. It is interesting, and again rather sad, that many important thinkers of basically mystical underlying orientation, such as Fechner, Kepler, Newton, Pauli and Schrödinger, have been engorged by our culture and only their ‘Yangian’ products digested. Eventually they are presented to students as far-seeing pioneers of the Yang way when in reality they were nothing of the kind. This is one of the many ‘delusions’ transmitted by routine science education. THE PATHOLOGY OF THE NORMAL We are living at a time when any form of off-centre behaviour, thought or feeling is in danger of having a label, implying a mental health problem, attached to it. This began of course in psychiatry but has now spread to the popular media with such terms as ‘shopaholism’, ‘kitchen performance anxiety’ and ‘crammed diary syndrome’ (doubtless joggers have ‘endorphin addiction’). This really is a trend to the total pathologisation of life – the cost of which is not only stigma but ‘self-stigma’ (Fung et al., 2007). It is frustrating the way psychiatry and psychology undervalue mental states away from the label-free centre – as this chapter has tried to demonstrate – and undervalue qualities necessary for artists and spiritual questers. In closing it is rather refreshing to consider what labels could be put on people who feel safely away from psychopathologists’ spotlight – which means basically that they are no trouble to themselves or anybody else. Are these people suffering from ‘pathologically middle-of-the-road personality disorder’?\n\nDemystifying madness and mystifying sanity\n\n11\n\nOr perhaps ‘reality obsession’, ‘rationality fixation’, ‘pathological blandness’, ‘nonexistent personality syndrome’, ‘insufficiently diverse sexual fantasy life’, ‘mania logica’, ‘mania psychoanalytica’ or ‘aspiritual personality’? Clearly two can play at the game of label sticking but this does show, when we end up, via taking a different perspective, with everybody labelled (and thereby everybody stigmatised and stigmatising themselves), that the way things are going is rendering the whole deviance categorising process utterly meaningless (see Chadwick, 2003a, for more on this). This book and this chapter have been written more in the spirit of acceptance and depathologisation, a reverse trend to that currently in operation. Perhaps one day we might even accept one another for who we are?\n\nChapter 3 Cannabis and altered states – a positive view Travis Parker Temptations that have to be half whispered always promise Dionysiac ecstasy. SHORT NOTE FROM PETER CHADWICK Should one smoke cannabis or not? Does one want to? The cannabis legalisation website: http://www.ukcia.org/ certainly is a forum for people to air their views. The viewpoints are many but in this book I am presenting those of two experts-by-experience: Travis Parker here in Chapter 3 who puts forward a positive case for cannabis smoking and Terry Hammond, in Chapter 4, whose son Steve developed schizophrenia after cannabis use. An informed debate is what is required and these two chapters set out the upsides and downsides of this enigmatic drug as well as anyone could ask in the space available. Personally I am neither pro nor anti though I do not smoke cannabis myself. These two chapters, however, certainly take the reader on a roller coaster ride through the territory created by this tortuously difficult issue of our day. With no further delay I now hand you over to Travis. The weed; marijuana; dope; ganja; kif; hashish; Mary Jane; bhang; this famous herb has been in use for centuries, for pleasure, for medicinal purposes, and as part of religious rituals. In some quarters it holds iconic quasi-mythical meaning as either ‘the devil’s weed’, tempting youngsters into a downward spiral of mental deterioration and selfdestruction, or alternatively as a ‘magic weed’ offering changes of consciousness which open dimensions of experience and cognition and forms of excitement, pleasure and insights unavailable elsewhere. Of course, once its distribution and use was criminalised, it also began to attract other associations: as an integral part of a vicious international network of criminal gangs, violent conflict and menacing underworld activity. Research into cannabis and its effects has grown substantially over the last 20 years. For a while during this period, some of the findings seemed relatively benign, in particular regarding its use in pain control for multiple sclerosis (e.g. Joy et al., 1999; Consroe, 1997), and for glaucoma (Voth and Schwartz, 1997), and also for managing nausea in cancer patients (Schwartz et al., 1997). Its improving reputation culminated in the decision of the British Home Secretary to downgrade the drug from Class B to Class C in 2002. However, since then the tide has been steadily turning and there has been a continuous sequence of negative outcomes reported in the research literature. Its involvement in impaired memory (Heishman et al., 1997; Ilan et al., 2004), road accidents (Laumon et al., 2005) and perhaps most widely reported, as a contributor to psychotic conditions (Johns, 2001; Moore et al., 2007), is undermining the hope of its supporters that it might one day be regarded as equivalent to alcohol in terms of its balance of benefits and costs. This contribution, however, is not intended as another review of the objective, quantitative evidence for or against cannabis, but rather as a reminder of why and how it was ever used and enjoyed over the many centuries since its effects were first discovered\n\nCannabis and altered states – a positive view\n\n13\n\n… what is, we might say, all the fuss about? To answer that question we shall be taking a more qualitative approach and looking at the history of its use both in a long-term sense, exploring its use in religious ritual over the centuries, and more recently since its rediscovery in the West in the 1960s when the ‘counter culture’ took root and the generation of baby boomers determined to explore the limits of both social and psychological structures: hippies, communes, free love, encounter groups, beat poetry, the Beatles … all invited us in one way or another to experiment with different ways of living and thinking. Many of these experiments proved short-lived, but the presence and use of cannabis as well as other substances, with their mind-altering powers, could be found almost as a kind of linking thread in all these movements and groups. Forty years on, following the Thatcher revolution in the 1980s and the resurgence of a rampant market mentality, we now regard with general disdain any activity or thinking which does not promote long, obedient hours in the workplace and a commitment to economic productivity and money-making above all else. The cultural tide has well and truly turned and the enjoyment of the weed has become regarded at least in some quarters with the same general contempt often directed at those 1960s phenomena in general. The growing medical evidence for its harmful effects combines therefore with its failure to match the new cultural/social ethic to render it highly suspect indeed. MARIJUANA USE THROUGH HISTORY Abel (1982) has reviewed the history of cannabis and helps us to remember how culturally relative our current thinking inevitably is. References to hemp can be found in China and Japan albeit as a source of rope and bow strings. Early Indian records show the first real signs of an appreciation of its psychoactive properties. The earliest reference to bhang’s psychoactive effects is in the fourth books of the Vedas, written before 2000 and 1400 BC. Here it is named as one of the herbs that can release us from anxiety. Another document from the fifteenth century refers to it in terms such as ‘light-hearted’, ‘joyful’, and ‘rejoices’, and claims that among its virtues are ‘astringency’, ‘heat’, ‘speechgiving’, ‘inspiration of mental powers’, ‘excitability’, and the capacity to ‘remove wind and phlegm’. However, apart from its use for relaxation and enjoyment, it was also used by fakirs and holy men as an enhancement of their communication with God. To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in the bhang leaf. To see in a dream the leaves, plant or water of bhang is lucky. No good thing can come to the man who treads underfoot the holy bhang leaf. Besides being a cure for fever, bhang was seen as having many medicinal virtues; it ‘cures dysentery and sunstroke, clears phlegm, quickens digestion, sharpens appetite, makes the tongue of the lisper plain, freshens the intellect, and gives alertness to the body and gaiety to the mind. Such are the useful and needful ends to which, in his goodness, the Almighty made bhang. In the ecstasy of bhang the spark of the Eternal in man turns into light the murkiness of matter. Bhang is the Joygiver, the Skyflier, the Heavenly-guide, the Poor Man’s Heaven, the Soother of Grief. No god or man is as good as the religious drinker of bhang.’ The supporting power of bhang has brought many a Hindu family safe through the miseries of famine. To forbid or even seriously to restrict the use of so holy and gracious a herb as the hemp would cause widespread suffering and annoyance and to large bands of worshipped ascetics, deep-seated anger (Abel, 1982).\n\nSchizophrenia: the positive perspective\n\n14\n\nIn Europe hemp has been used in rope making for centuries, but its uses for other purposes had been noted already by the fifteenth century. In 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued a papal fiat condemning witchcraft and the use of hemp in the Satanic mass. In 1615, an Italian physician and demonologist, Giovanni de Ninault, listed hemp as the main ingredient in the ointments and unguents used by the devil’s followers. Hemp, along with opium, belladonna, henbane and hemlock, the demonologists believed, was commonly resorted to during the Witches’ Sabbath to produce the hunger, ecstasy, intoxication and aphrodisia responsible for the gluttonous banquets, the frenzied dancing, and the orgies that characterized the celebration of the Black Mass (Abel, 1982). Ganja in India generated revenue for the British Crown during the days of the Empire but its intoxicating effects did bother the authorities. ‘The ganja menace’ caught the attention of the Temperance League, and a commission, on 16 March 1893, was ordered to determine whether cannabis should be prohibited in India. The commission met on 3 August 1893 and remained in session until 6 August 1894. After hearing statements from numerous witnesses it concluded: (1) Moderate use of cannabis had no appreciable physical effects on the body. (2) Moderate use of cannabis had no adverse effects on the brain, except possibly for individuals predisposed to act abnormally. Excessive use could lead to mental instability and ultimately to insanity ‘in individuals predisposed by heredity to mental disorders’. (3) Moderate use of cannabis had no adverse influence on morality. Excessive usage could result in moral degradation. Cannabis intoxication could result in violence, but ‘such cases were few and far between’. The Egyptians taught the French troops to use hashish and although Napoleon issued an ordinance banning it, the psychiatrist Dr Jacques-Joseph Moreau (1804–84) decided to study hashish. After trying it on himself, he enlisted volunteers. Thus it was that Moreau became drug dispenser to the Hashish Club (Club des Hachichins), a coterie of France’s leading writers, poets and artists. The club met on a monthly basis in the elegant Hotel Lauzun in Paris’s Latin Quarter. Visitors or members included Alexandre Dumas, Gerard de Nerval, Victor Hugo, Ferdinand Boissard, Eugene Delacroix and Gautier himself. Charles Baudelaire and Honoré de Balzac also attended but were said not to use it often, although R. Blondel, who was Baudelaire’s doctor, once said: ‘Each one who takes hashish has the dream that he deserves’. In England, Thomas De Quincey announced that he would try some ‘bang’ and report on it, but this never materialised. He did write that: one farmer in Midlothian was mentioned to me eight months ago as having taken it, and ever since annoyed his neighbours by immoderate fits of laughter; so that in January it was agreed to present him to the sheriff as a nuisance. But for some reason the plan was\n\nCannabis and altered states – a positive view\n\n15\n\nlaid aside and now, eight months later, I hear that the farmer is laughing more rapturously than ever, continues in the happiest frame of mind, the kindest creature and the general torment of his neighbourhood. (De Quincey, 1998/1822) During the twentieth century, the reputation of cannabis largely waned as governments in Europe and America started from the opening decades of the century to introduce legislation controlling and outlawing its use. During the 1930s and 1940s in the USA governmental warnings about the dangers of the weed grew in intensity, including the making and distribution of the notorious film Reefer Madness portraying the alleged homicidal effects of smoking dope. (This film was a favourite on college campuses during the 1960s and 1970s.) During this period it also began to be associated with blacks and jazz musicians, and negative propaganda about cannabis took on what would now be regarded as distinctly racist overtones. Harry Anslinger, 1930s Head of the US Federal Bureau of Narcotics, was said to have put more jazz bands in jail than he could count. Famous musicians were observed and some sentenced for possession of cannabis. In front of the 1937 US Congress, Anslinger talked about ‘satanic voodoo jazz’ and those ‘reefer smokers’ that would make white women want to have ‘sex with Negroes’ (Fachner, 2003). The beatniks in the 1950s paved the way for the explosion of interest and experimentation again amongst musicians but also poets and some academics in the 1960s, where the connections between the cannabis experience and certain Eastern religious teachings began to be commented on once again. By and large the ‘establishment’ took a pretty dim view although from the 1970s some more favourable voices began to be heard once again, albeit this time owing to the medicinal effects which were beginning to be noted. THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING STONED So what does it do to you? And why does it retain its appeal? Several papers have described the subjective effects of cannabis as reported by users (e.g. Green et al., 2003; Eisenman, 2003; Hammersley and Leon, 2006). Green et al. (2003), for example, discuss empirical research into the experiences of and motives for smoking marijuana and conclude that it shares with alcohol the capacity to reduce tension and induce relaxation; it enhances mood and social bonding, but includes some motives not found for alcohol such as enhancement of perceptual and cognitive experience and experienced creativity. An early collection of views and commentaries on the nature of the cannabis experience, The Book of Grass, edited by Andrews (1967) collated the writings of some of the earlier participant-observers such as Aldous Huxley and William Burroughs. We shall draw on these descriptions and combine them with the recollections of the author and his companions to highlight some of the pleasures available at least to some cannabis users, albeit not all. (Why some people seem immune to its influence remains unexplained. We recognise the individual variation in people’s reaction to alcohol so we should not perhaps be too surprised. Whether the variation is best seen as a function of personality or of neurological differences, or both, we cannot say at present.) Talking to users and consumers, there are a number of themes which recur when enthusiasts get started on the delights of ‘wacky baccy’.\n\nSchizophrenia: the positive perspective\n\n16\n\nCocking a snook Its illegal status undoubtedly adds to its appeal for adolescents and young adults. It offers a vehicle for that rebelliousness which for many adolescents is a necessary part of defining their independence from parents: ‘I know you’ve still got to be careful who you mention it to; not everyone will approve’. Smoking dope can appear to claim a bit of bold individuality for myself: ‘I’m not going to join in with the consensus view that it’s a dangerous and bad thing to do; I’m going to judge that myself, and not accept the handme-down views of politicians and policemen without question’. Social bonding Two kinds of bond are available to the stoner: firstly there’s the feeling of belonging to a semi-secret and moderately marginal club; coming across another enthusiast offers an instant buzz of recognition for the cannabis connoisseur. Yet this is a recognition we must be careful not to acknowledge too publicly; you and I know that we sharing something in common but, ‘wink wink’, we mustn’t let everyone see that we do. A more respectable version of this feeling may be familiar to Freemasons. And yet, someone could object, so what? You could get the same claims to boldness, risk taking, individuality and club membership from being house-breakers or boy racers … these people too sail close to the wind and probably feel at least as much exhilaration as the dope smoker, so what is it particularly about dope smoking which provides the pleasure and satisfaction? What is its intrinsic attraction? Can we present an account of the behaviour and experience of the drug itself which captures its appeal … what does it do to the mind? Intimate bonding There’s a second kind of bonding many smokers know, which comes more from the intrinsic qualities of the drug experience itself, which is the sense of deep sharing, a feeling of intimate mutuality that sometimes can happen when two or more are gathered together and sharing a joint, while listening to music or telling a story. You can really feel you know deeply what the other(s) are experiencing at the same time. You’re really in the middle of the stoned space together. Those moments of experienced bonding provide their own intrinsic and powerful reward. Meeting up with an old friend Its effects when smoked creep up quite quickly. Within ten/fifteen minutes alterations in consciousness can be detected, although it’s often helpful (and fun!) to have a smoking partner to check against: ‘are you stoned yet?’ ‘Can you notice anything yet?’ If this question is followed by a momentary pause and the beginnings of a smile of welcome recognition, you know your partner is beginning to get it, and that welcome, that recognition as the dope begins to infuse and embed itself in your being (mind and body … we’ll come on to that later), is also part of the deal. One user I know who was offered a smoke a few years after he’d last used it, took one puff, held it in, paused and then\n\nCannabis and altered states – a positive view\n\n17\n\nexclaimed, ‘Hello again!’, like he was meeting up again with an old friend, whose character and energy he had forgotten about, forgotten what it felt like to be with. And for those who know how to appreciate the encounter, ‘it’s a pleasure to meet you again indeed’. Not everyone who consumes necessarily likes (or knows how to?) introspect as the effects take hold. In many ways a meditative detached attitude is helpful to the appreciation of the weed and those who are more used to looking at their own experience and identifying the structures and contents of experience may more likely turn into connoisseurs than others, who just like to get on with living and are not in the habit of exploring their interior lives. Being in the moment Being stoned can be called ‘a lived philosophical state’. The structure of the stoned state seems to imply or highlight certain ways of being, ways of looking at the world that are related to the perspectives and attitudes one can find in Buddhist writings and teachings. For many, including the author, the central feature of being stoned is a deeper immersion in the present moment, but the caveat is: whatever that moment may contain. Thus, it affects every stoner uniquely, all depending on how she/he is at the time. Mellow becomes blissed out but uneasy becomes paranoid. (Remember Baudelaire’s ‘Each one who takes hashish has the dream that he deserves’.) Deep and meaningful Meaning is exaggerated, everything takes on enhanced significance; it all gets to be so much more important. Thus ideas, phrases, become inherently more profound, more pregnant with value, more potentially world-shattering; they will amaze and revolutionise everyone’s understanding of life. Tastes and flavours Tastes and flavours hit you with a new freshness, new depths and are absolutely a million times more delicious, and contrasts and variety of flavours can seem quite kaleidoscopic; savoury, sweet, followed by another savoury; then more sweeties, the appetite grows and can become gluttonous; one has to have more, often much much more. These are the famous ‘munchies’. The slowing of time The passage of time changes when one is immersed in the present. There is a feeling of time being stretched or expanded or perceived as slowed down or sped up. Ninety-five per cent of 151 participants of Charles Tart’s study On Being Stoned agreed with the following statement: Time passes very slowly; things go on for the longest time (e.g. One side of a record seems to play for hours). (Tart, 1971)\n\nSchizophrenia: the positive perspective\n\n18\n\nIn experiments on time perception, stoned subjects failed to estimate time intervals correctly, and tended to expand the estimated interval. Jones reported that a 15-second time interval was expanded to a mean of 16.7 seconds, estimated under the influence of oral THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), while being counted correctly in the normal state (Jones and Stone, 1970). Seconds and minutes pass by in slower motion, allowing you to dwell and linger in the passing moment as it passes, sometimes barely perceptibly, almost hanging in space/time like a still photo. One savours the moment luxuriously, as it enlarges and opens up the texture of sensuality; pleasure in all its forms takes on a new definition; sexual foreplay and intercourse benefit from the slowing of time, each small shift in body sensation available to be appreciated. Moving through an hour, especially if one goes out of the house for a walk or a takeaway, is like moving through a tunnel; when you’re in one section of it, the section you’ve left behind quickly becomes ancient history; standing on the pavement, in the cold afternoon air, becomes your whole world, and can be quite daunting: so much going on; so many people; so many sights and sounds, movement; bustle; traffic; you have to concentrate on where you are and which direction you want to head in. What did you come out for again? And then you remember back to the room where the decision was taken to head out for a take-away curry; that warm, quiet, smokefilled room; lying about and dreaming and imagining what foods you could possibly buy. That place suddenly seems a long while ago, a long way away. Spatial discontinuity Spatial continuity falls away. Physically moving one’s position in space can offer a quite new perspective on the world. Even getting up and moving to a different part of the room is like going on holiday; you’re suddenly in a different world which looks and feels different from where you were a minute ago. There are faint reminders of a childhood state of mind when the various rooms in the house each had their distinctive character, and it was something of an adventure to move from the kitchen to the living room. The world then was a much bigger and impressive place; cannabis can sometimes re-evoke that sense of wonder. Michael Pickering (in The Book of Grass by George Andrews, 1967) comments: The effects, usually coming on after two or three or four pipefuls, are different for each person, but several general characteristics are usually common to everybody. First of all, you suddenly notice as if for the first time in your life, how fantastically beautiful everything in the world is – even little things you hardly thought worth looking at before … all colours become incredibly bright and intense, and sounds and touches full of beauty. When I first got high on kif, I was in a filthy youth hostel in Casablanca – but lying on a table was a small alcohol heater someone was using for cooking; it was dark and the heater was shooting out a long bright blue flame. Suddenly this flame was to me the most beautiful object in the world – the only thing worth looking at – it was full of exquisite wisps of orange and red – it was swirling round and round in the air, always emitting a lovely hissing noise that filled the whole room. But there is much more than just the heightening of the senses. You begin to think think think. More profoundly and more interestingly than ever before. You have fantastic ideas thrown up by your\n\nCannabis and altered states – a positive view\n\n19\n\nimagination which knows no bounds or restraints. And you feel an intense physical exhilaration – that makes you want to leap around. Everything in the world suddenly becomes true and real – you can see deep into people’s minds by just looking at their eyes – you can tell everything about them, their thoughts, characters, dreams and secrets. You can see what people are really like – their ‘image’ is shattered – and so is yours – you start behaving as you really are. Politeness for the sake of politeness is impossible, or if tried, it is completely unconvincing. You become obsessed with the beauty of everything around you. To any observer you appear crazy – but this is nothing to you – you are in your own lovely world creating thoughts and visions and sounds and sights – creating whatever you like – doing whatever you like – you have woken up at last and start seeing the world as it really is for the first time – the kif has drawn the veil from your eyes and there is only life and growth and creation. (p. 164) Lawrence Lipton writes in the same volume: The euphoria that the beats who use marijuana are sensing is not the wholly passive, sedative, pacifying experience that the users of commercial tranquillizers want. On the contrary, they are looking for a greater sense of aliveness, a heightened sense of awareness. Of all the euphoric, hypnotic and hallucinogenic drugs, marijuana is the mildest and also the most conductive to social usage. The joint is passed around the pad and shared, not for reasons of economy but as a social ritual. Once the group is high, the magic circle is complete. Confidences are exchanged, personal problems are discussed – with a frankness that is difficult to achieve under normal circumstances – music is listened to with rapt concentration, poetry is read aloud and its images, visual and acoustical, communicated with maximum effect. The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force, as a unifying principle in human relationships, than at any other time except, perhaps, in the mutual metaphysical orgasm. The magic circle is, in fact, a symbol of and a preparation for the metaphysical orgasm. While marijuana does not give the user the sense of timelessness to the same degree that peyote does, or LSD or other drugs, it does so sufficiently to impart a sense of presence, a here-and-nowness that gives the user a heightened sense of awareness and immediacy. (p. 159) MUSIC AND CANNABIS Cannabis invites us into a new relationship with music both as listener and as a player (Fachner, 2003). Listening to music traditionally plays a big part in the stoned experience. There are two ways musical experience can shift: one is in the relationship one develops with the music itself. The band or the orchestra can become threedimensional; they are around you, spread out in your mental space as you listen; and you really listen; every note, chord, phrase and emotional nuance expressed by the musicians you immediately pick up and enjoy (just as you did the curry or the chocolate bar). You are with the musicians and love what they are doing with their sounds; they’re doing it for you after all.\n\nSchizophrenia: the positive perspective\n\n20\n\nThe music sounded incredibly good. In fact, it was so good and so clear that I thought that it could not be music on a stereo player. The band must be playing in my room! (Eisenman, 2003) But there’s a second way listening to music can be enhanced, and that stems from the social bonding effect mentioned earlier. If you listen with friends, you somehow know that you are all sharing the same intimacy with the music (and even if you’re not, you feel that you are with a great certainty). Especially with tracks that you all know, the feeling that you are all together with that soaring guitar solo, or the lithe sensuous Latin rhythm, only serves to intensify the experience still further. Playing music too takes on a new dimension when under the influence. Fachner (2003) suggests that certain drugs may lead musicians to certain musical styles and performance because some musicians are more attracted by a specific drug, for example Mezz Mezzrow, a jazz musician from the 1930s who became much more famous for supplying marijuana joints for his friends like Louis Armstrong, Hoagy Carmichael, Tommy Dorsey, than for his playing. Louis Armstrong himself became a life-long fan of the weed, or ‘gage’ as he preferred to call it (Bergreen, 1998). ‘It’s a thousand times better than whisky, an assistant, a friend … very good for asthma, relaxes your nerves’ was one of his pronouncements. Marijuana seems to help the player really ‘enter’ the space of the music; you seem to feel the music emerging through you, and it takes your full attention. So much so, however, that you can lose touch with the context of the music: one jazz musician reported to the author an experience of playing at a top London jazz venue some years ago. He was playing a slow ballad, having consumed a little something beforehand; halfway through the piece, he suddenly realised he didn’t have a clue which tune he was supposed to be playing; he knew which chord came next but not where the whole thing was heading or where it would end up! (It may or may not be significant that none of the audience had seemed to notice anything wrong when they did finally finish the piece.) Other jazz players have reported how marijuana can interfere a lot with the sense of time: We played the first tune for almost two hours – one tune! We got on the stand and played this one tune, we started at nine o’clock. When we got finished I looked at my watch, it’s a quarter to eleven. Almost two hours on one tune. And it didn’t seem like anything. I mean, you know, it does that to you. It’s like you have much more time or something. (Becker, 1966, p. 74)\n\nCannabis and altered states – a positive view\n\n21\n\nCONCLUSION Such are some of the effects cannabis can induce. But we should not forget that these effects are not experienced by all. We have already seen that some people remain largely untouched by the drug altogether. Others, while still seemingly having their present experience intensified, find themselves with high anxiety bordering on panic or paranoia. Eisenman (2003) recounts one example of a learned phobia which he attributes to ‘statedependent learning’ and he presents this as a reason he never touches the stuff nowadays. A very dear friend of mine hasn’t touched the stuff for years since the last time she tried it and had to hide behind the sofa for an hour out of some nameless but deeply unpleasant feeling of dread. Another good friend seems profoundly unaffected in all respects and simply cannot understand what all the fuss is about, positive or negative. But for those fortunate few who are graced with the right neurological constitution, marijuana offers a delightful garden of altered horizons, enriched tastes and pleasures and a renewed sense of the wonderfulness of the world and life, when the mood and the setting are right. I for one truly hope that however powerful the puritans and the nannies and the political bully boys become there will always be those who will cultivate and honour the experience of this entrancing weed.\n\nChapter 4 Cannabis and altered states – the dark side Terry Hammond Benign people do benign things, nasty people do nasty things, but to make benign people do nasty things you don’t need religion … you need drugs and alcohol. The anecdotal evidence that cannabis is linked to mental illness has been screaming at us for years. In fact the link between them goes back centuries; one of the first references to cannabis as a psychoactive drug was in China during the first century: ‘If taken in excess will produce visions of the devil … If taken over a long time, it makes one communicate with the spirits and lightens one’s body’. Napoleon noticed the adverse effects cannabis had on the Egyptian lower class and declared a total prohibition. During the 1920s the Egyptian government was so concerned about the detrimental effects cannabis was having on the working population that it requested that cannabis be added to the ‘Geneva International Convention on Narcotics Control’. In the UK on 28 September 1925 the Dangerous Drugs Act became law and cannabis was made illegal. There is now increasing epidemiological evidence showing that long-term use of cannabis, particularly if commencing in teenage years, can lead to the development of mental health problems. The Royal College of Psychiatry website shows very succinctly how complex the plant is. The writers point out that there ‘are about 60 compounds and 400 chemicals in an average cannabis plant. The four main compounds are called delta-9tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), cannabidiol, delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol. Apart from cannabidiol (CBD) these compounds are psychoactive, the strongest one being delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The stronger varieties of the plant contain little cannabidiol (CBD), whilst the delta-9-THC content is a lot higher in Skunk.’ When cannabis is smoked, its compounds rapidly enter the bloodstream and are transported directly to the brain and other parts of the body. The feeling of being ‘stoned’ or ‘high’ is caused mainly by the delta-9-THC binding to cannabinoid receptors in the brain. Curiously, there are also cannabis-like substances produced naturally by the brain itself – these are called endocannabinoids. Most of these receptors are found in the parts of the brain that influence pleasure, memory, thought, concentration, sensory and time perception. Cannabis compounds can also affect the eyes, the ears, the skin and the stomach. (Royal College of Psychiatry, August 2006) The government does seem to be taking the possibility of cannabis playing a causal role in psychosis more seriously. A spokesman from the Department of Health acknowledged in January 2005 that: There is medical clinical evidence now that there is an important causal factor between cannabis use and schizophrenia – not the only factor, but an important causal factor. That is the common consensus among the medical fraternity.\n\nCannabis and altered states – the dark side\n\n23\n\nThe question for the government is now not whether cannabis is a trigger for mental illness, but how does the government reduce its use? A CARER’S STORY Eight years ago my son was taken into hospital following a psychotic breakdown – triggered, we believe, by cannabis. This was somewhat ironic at the time as I had been working in mental illness for the National Schizophrenia Fellowship (now Rethink) as their Southern Regional Director. Part of my job was to support and develop carers’ selfhelp groups. Previous to that, in Southampton, I had helped to set up one of the largest supported housing schemes in the country, for people with mental illness, most of whom had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. One would expect that I would have been well equipped to cope. But in fact I was totally pole-axed by Steve’s illness. In this chapter I will be covering: 1 The impact that my son’s illness had on me and the rest of the family. 2 What it was like to live with illness. 3 What was involved in the recovery process. 4 The reality of recovery. I hope that the reader will gain a new insight into what it is like to care for someone with schizophrenia and will understand more why many carers find it hard to let go. BACKGROUND It was at six o’clock on a warm summer’s evening that my son uttered six words that were to change my life forever. I was watching the BBC News, a woman in black was bent over her dead son, she was wailing pitifully. It was all too depressing, so I reached for the remote. As I did so, my son Steve, who had been studying the floor, slowly raised his head and suddenly demanded to know why I had rung the BBC. ‘BBC Steve, what are you talking about?’ ‘You know’ he snapped back, ‘don’t deny it, you rang the BBC up to tell them that I was a lazy sod – they have been broadcasting it all day’. My heart missed a beat; I went cold and felt sick. I had become a carer. Several excruciating weeks later, Steve was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and hospitalised. We later discovered that for the previous six months he had been bingeing on cannabis. The psychosis took hold of Steve’s mind like some aggressive malignant cancer. We helplessly watched on as his beautiful mind was slowly being mutilated. It was more than I could bear – it was like watching your son being tortured before your eyes and there was nothing you could do to stop it, I felt totally subjugated. I desperately wanted to reach out and rip out what was destroying his mind, I hoped beyond hope that Steve would wake up and it would be all over, that his mind would be clear and that the cannabis haze would have drifted away. Sadly this was not to be. THE WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE It was four weeks later, during the night of Wednesday 11 August 1999, when I experienced the worst night of my life. The following day I had an early start, so I went to bed early; I read a few pages of my book, set the alarm and hit the pillow at just after\n\nSchizophrenia: the positive perspective\n\n24\n\n11 p.m. Two hours later I was awakened by a terrible crash followed by shouting – it was Steve. I rushed into his bedroom to find him standing in the corner of the room, fear was radiating from every pore of his face – his whole body was trembling. ‘Steve, are you alright? What’s the matter?’ I asked. Steve just stood transfixed, he seemed paralysed with fear. ‘Are you my dad?’ a quivering voice replied. ‘Of course I am Steve.’ ‘You’re not an alien – are you?’ ‘Of course not Steve, it’s me, your dad’. As I approached him to put my arm around him, he flinched and backed off. ‘It’s me Steve, it’s your dad’, trying to reassure him. He turned his face away from me and stared out of the window. He started rambling to himself, it was incoherent. I desperately tried to make out what he was saying but it was impossible. I asked him again if he was alright but he told me to go away. I asked him if he wanted a drink, but he told me to go back to bed. I asked him to get back into bed, which to my surprise he did. As I left the room I could see the door frame was badly split where it had been violently slammed. Chris, my wife, was standing in the hallway, her hands clasping her cheeks; I told her that it was perhaps best to leave him and let him go back to sleep. We both got back into bed and lay discussing the situation. Chris was urging me to get Steve into hospital. We had seen his GP four weeks earlier, who had referred Steve to the local Community Mental Health team. A psychiatrist had visited Steve and had confirmed that Steve was suffering from psychosis – possibly schizophrenia; we were both in a state of shock. The psychiatrist suggested that we wait to see how things developed and that they would try and treat his psychosis at home rather than in hospital. As we lay discussing what to do, there was a sudden almighty crash and the sound of glass breaking – Steve was screaming at the top of his voice – ‘Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off!’ I jumped out of bed and ran to his bedroom. I entered the darkened room to find Steve silhouetted against the window, he turned and lurched towards me, his six foot frame stood over me – a beam of light from the hallway draped his face revealing eyes that were full of fear and menace. I was frightened. ‘It’s me Steve, it’s your dad’. He studied my face. ‘It’s alright Steve, it’s me’, I once again reassured him. He continued to study my face for what seemed ages, he looked totally confused. He suddenly turned away and got back into bed and in a calm voice said, ‘Go back to bed dad, it’s nothing’. I went to pick up the pieces of the shattered ashtray but he angrily told me to get out. I dearly wanted to talk to him, I wanted to find out what I could do to help him, but the truth was, I was fearful and uncertain what to do. I returned to our bedroom; Chris was crying. ‘We have to do something’ she sobbed. ‘He needs to go to hospital now, I want my son back, I want my son back.’ Steve started shouting again. Chris went to go to him, I told her not to and that we should just wait a while to see if he quietened down. She looked at me and said, ‘You’re frightened, aren’t you?’ Her words were like a spear piercing through me – little Terry Hammond, the poor kid from the back streets of Tooting, the ducker and diver, the born survivor – never lost for a word – knocked for six. Yes, Chris was right – I was frightened. I sat on the edge of the bed feeling defeated. All that so-called experience working in mental health meant nothing. For the first time in my life I simply didn’t know what to do or say – should I cry? – is that what a real man should do? But I don’t cry, I have never cried, not once as an adult – not even when grandfather died, who I was very close to, not even when my beloved Sam, the Great Dane, had to be put down. Crying – it’s a sign of weakness – isn’t it?\n\nCannabis and altered states – the dark side\n\n25\n\nThe sound of Steve continued to dominate the house. I continued to sit on the edge of the bed, Chris’s words still echoing in my head. If I go into his bedroom, would Steve be able to hold himself back this time? Could I defend myself against an attack? He is bigger and far stronger than me; what if he tries to kill me? He is certainly physically capable – who knows what madness lurks inside his head? With a great deal of fear and foreboding I decided to go to Steve’s room, I stood outside for a while, listening. Thankfully his shouting had abated, he was mumbling away to himself. I opened the door and listened in – he was in bed. I decided that the worst was over and quietly closed the door, relieved that I had not been put t"
