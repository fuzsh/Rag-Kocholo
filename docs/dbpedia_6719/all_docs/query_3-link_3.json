        "text": "NEWS RELEASE: 4th July 2017\n\nTime to get ‘Swing Fit’ as first ever joyful cardio fitness club comes to Brighton\n\nBacked by BBC’s Dragons’ Den funding, and inspired by the joyful sounds of Swing music, SwingTrain offers Brighton’s entrepreneurial fitness and dance enthusiasts the opportunity to manage their own unique fitness classes\n\nSwingTrain, the latest high-intensity, dance cardio exercise programme, comes to Brighton as founder and celebrity dance instructor Scott Cupit searches for more local SwingTrain instructors in a bid to get people dancing their way to fitness.\n\nWith classes already taking place at almost 50 locations throughout the UK and abroad, SwingTrain is inviting enthusiastic, talented and outgoing individuals from all over Brighton to join its growing network of instructors in a mission to get people ‘Swing Fit’ to what is being described as some of the most joyful and happiest music in the world.\n\nHead SwingTrainer, Hannah Moore, will be running a training day for SwingTrainers on Saturday 29th July from 1pm – 5pm at Indigenous People at Hove Studios and is encouraging fitness and dance enthusiasts of all levels to attend the workshop and find out what it takes to become a fully-qualified SwingTrainer.\n\nDuring the four-hour workshop Hannah will demonstrate choreographed, follow-along dance routines, teaching techniques and class management skills. After a short assessment students can then become fully-qualified instructors, allowing them to advertise and manage their own SwingTrain fitness classes in their local area with the full support of SwingTrain HQ.\n\nEntrepreneur and founder of Swing Patrol Scott Cupit commented: “For those looking to avoid the mundane gym workouts, SwingTrain offers something very different. It’s suitable for people of all levels of fitness and the classes provide a total body workout, working legs, arms and core. It’s all done to music that is so infectious, that you won’t realise you’re burning up to 500 calories an hour.\n\n“We take some of the individual dance steps from vintage dances popular throughout the Swing era of the 1920s, 30s and 40s, and turn them into choreographed fitness routines. The result? A fun and effective dance cardio workout inspired by the joyful and energetic sounds of Charleston, Swing, Electro-Swing, Gospel and Hot Jazz.”\n\nCupit continued: “Now is a great time to join our network of qualified SwingTrain instructors. Our business model offers people, such as college and university students, busy parents and fitness enthusiasts of all levels, the opportunity to start their own business and channel their entrepreneurial skills.”\n\nHolly Nicholls, a recent graduate from King’s College London qualified as a SwingTrain teacher and said: “I was never really interested in going to a gym. Membership tends to be expensive and I find them boring. Being an accredited SwingTrain instructor is an enjoyable activity that I can schedule alongside my studies. After attending a similar ‘Train the Trainer’ day I now teach twice, sometimes three times a week, at my university and in my local area.”\n\nInvestor Deborah Meaden said: “When Scott first appeared on the BBC’s Dragons’ Den and presented his ideas I was immediately impressed by his enthusiasm and intelligent approach towards expanding his business venture called Swing Patrol. Since then his brand of swing dance classes, workshops and events has gone from strength to strength.”\n\nVINTAGE VIBE\n\nThere’s been a tremendous revival in all things vintage over the last few years, including learning to perform the original vintage dances such as Lindy Hop, Charleston, Balboa, solo jazz and Shag.\n\nCupit added: “It’s not hard to see why there’s currently so much interest in swing dancing. The vintage fashion appeals to many; the music appeals to all ages, from more upbeat electro-swing mixes, traditional big band tunes from the likes of Duke Ellington and the enchanting vocals of Nina Simone. We’ve taken this growing interest and developed a unique fitness class that will allow newly-qualified SwingTrain instructors to motivate others to reach their fitness goals.”\n\nSUPPORT NETWORK\n\nInstructors will receive on-going support from SwingTrain HQ, and will have access to a range of resources, such as new choreography, music playlists, branded materials and a marketing starter pack.\n\nTickets cost £39 and can be booked here. The first three registrations will be offered free of charge.\n\nTo register for the event, or for further information on how to become a SwingTrain instructor visit www.swingtrain.com\n\nUseful Links:\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nA selection of high-res SwingTrain images and a promotional video can be downloaded here.\n\nBrighton SwingTrain ‘Train the Trainer’ day – Saturday 29th July, 1pm – 5pm, Indigenous People, Hove Studios, Unit 3, Hove Business Centre, Fonthill Rd, Hove, BN3 6HA\n\nTickets £39 – Book here\n\nAbout Scott Cupit\n\nDance teacher, entrepreneur and now best-selling author of ‘Swing Dance: Fashion, music, culture and key moves’ Scott Cupit first discovered Swing dancing while travelling across America and was instantly drawn to the dance, music and the people.
