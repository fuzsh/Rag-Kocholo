Hello!

Â

A quick note to say that The Brighton Paradox will be back soon!

Â

Series 2 will be examining the landscape across the city in 2023 and 2024 - what is changing, and what is building in economics, culture, community and technology.

Â

Look out in this feed later this spring.

Â

We're also delightedÂ to announce that we are being supported again by Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club who return as brilliant headline sponsors and partners. And the University of Brighton's Help To Grow Management programme also returns as a valuable project partner. In addition - we have two new supporters; the exceptional folk at EQ Investors and the legends at Midnight Communications.Â

Â

ALSO

Â

Make sure you subscribe, for free, to The Brighton Connectiv - a monthly digest of positive, celebratory stories of collaboration, innovation, connection and opportunity across the city.

Â

Go to BrightonConnectiv.Substack.com to see the first few editions and to get new ones right in front of your lovely eyes around the middle of each month.

This is the final episode.

Where this part of the journey ends.

Â

These clips are all about what's next for Brighton & Hove.

The hopes, fears and dreams for the next decade.

Â

In four sections, we have ordered contributors' thoughts into:

Being brave to make long-term change to the cityâs infrastructure Community power? Harnessing the energy of everyone, everywhere to shape the future

In this penultimate episode, we look at how the city wanting to attract big business and London money - is also the city pioneering the weird, small, experimental ideas that are often best scaled-up elsewhere

Â

And we try to answer the following questions:

Â

Where does leadership come from in Brighton & Hove? What kind of leadership is needed to get things done? Do we need a mayor or stronger networks with teeth to make change? Should Brighton be more of a regional leader as a city? Â

We're taking a short break between episodes 8 and 9/10.

We will be organising some follow-up events later this Spring and Summer, to take forward themes and ideas in The Brighton Paradox. Not just more roundtable discussions, but action-led spaces for learning and commitment.

Â

But we don't want to own or dictate how these run.

We'd like to have a range of people facilitate, and to consider different and engaging formats to usual panel or workshop formats.

Â

Can you please head to alwayspossible.co.uk/paradox and answer a few questions? Scroll down below the published episodes and you'll find a button. This will load a quick GoogleForm where you can tell us about your reaction to the podcast, what you'd like to see taken further and how you'd like to see that happen.

Thank you!

In this episode, we look at how the city wanting to attract big business and London money - is also the city pioneering the weird, small, experimental ideas that are often best scaled-up elsewhere

Â

And we try to answer the following questions:

Â

Can Brighton & Hove be comfortable as the UK's ideas lab? What is a laboratory approach to business/tech, social justice, public services and culture/sport? Who is investing in ideas and risk? How important are collaborative spaces? Messy spaces? Interdisciplinary spaces? Â

In this episode, we look at how the city trying to compete for business and rapid economic growth - is also the city where a focus on health & wellbeing is helping it to stand out in the 21st century

Â

And we try to answer the following questions:

Â

Is Brighton & Hove's lens of health and wellbeing a privilege of the comfortable middle classess or a genuine philosophy that makes the city stand out? What makes a healthy city? What do innovation cultures in healthcare and education say about Brighton & Hove? Can Brighton & Hove contain a slice of London's hustle culture whilst also rejecting burnout? What is it about the sea? Â
