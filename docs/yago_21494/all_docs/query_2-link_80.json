        "text": "Professional colleagues from Warren Beatty's early films, such as Bonnie and Clyde, to his latest, Rules Don’t Apply, gathered to salute him recently at a dinner in New York sponsored by the Museum of the Moving Image.\n\nAmong the drollest was Robert Benton, writer of the screenplay of Bonnie and Clyde. Benton, who said he spent five years writing the screenplay, said Beatty called him one day, told him he wanted to read the screenplay, and that he would drop by Benton's house to pick it up.\n\n“I didn’t tell my wife Warren Beatty was coming. She was wearing jeans and my shirt, her hair was in rollers, she wasn’t wearing any make-up. The doorbell rang. She took one look at Warren, she looked at me. I tell you now it was a near-death experience,” Benton said.\n\nMaking Bonnie and Clyde, Benton added, \"was one of the best experiences of my entire life. It was like a master class in filmmaking. Warren was relentless in his pursuit to make it as good as it could possibly be.”\n\nAccording to Benton, film critics—particularly The New York Times’ Bosley Crowther—“loathed” Bonnie and Clyde. Beatty, Benton said, went into the office of Jack Warner and begged him to rerelease the movie. Warner’s reply: “OK, I’ll rerelease it if you get off your knees.”\n\nBoth Paul Sorvino and Mandy Patinkin credited Beatty with reviving their careers. Sorvino said “he makes you believe you’re the best there is.” He also said that when his daughter, actress Mira Sorvino, was five, she called the honoree “Warm Baby” whenever he phoned.\n\nPatinkin said Beatty had called him when he “hadn’t made any money in a year” and asked if he wanted to play the role of 88 Keys in Dick Tracy.\n\n“I said, ‘Yeah, that would be nice,’” Patinkin continued, adding that Beatty then said, “I just spoke to Stephen Sondheim. He’s going to write you a song that you might have to sing with Madonna. Is that OK?”\n\n“I’m a very nervous fellow and he knew that,” Patinkin said. “He said to me in my ear, ‘You can’t do anything wrong. You can’t make a mistake. Whatever you do is OK.’ Warren was my big brother always in my imagination.”\n\nAlden Ehrenreich--one of the stars of Beatty’s latest film, Rules Don’t Apply, Beatty’s first in 15 years—said he had met Beatty in 2009 and had lunches and dinners with him over the next five years that lasted six or seven hours. Ehrenreich learned from these, he said, “Do not wait for Warren to stop speaking to excuse yourself to go to the restroom, or you can wait for hours or days.”\n\nAnother of the new film’s stars, Lily Collins, called Beatty “some sort of magician. When you reach the 11th hour and you’re exhausted, magic happens. You knew we had the potential to do that. You empower men. You empower women, young women to realize that the sky’s the limit. You want us to reach our dreams.”\n\nMichael Barker, Sony Classic Pictures co-president and co-chairman of the board of the Museum of the Moving Image, noted that Beatty has a photographic memory, an unusual trait since “in the movie business noone remembers what happened this morning.” The honoree, he added, “is engaged in the world in every detail. He does this by asking questions. He asks you so many questions he drives you crazy. What he does with these answers is his gift, and why in American movies he’s the best actor, producer, director and screenwriter all rolled into one.”\n\nBeatty’s wife, Annette Bening—the two met making Bugsy—said she had urged him to make Rules Don’t Apply so their four children would be able to “see him work.”\n\nFor his part, Beatty said he had once felt that Bob Dylan would be most suited to play Clyde Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde, but that ultimately he changed his mind (he played Barrow). He asked in jest if now Dylan had won a Nobel Prize, it would be “inappropriate or maybe in poor taste” to inquire about the possibility of one for himself. “I’m happy to travel,” he added, “and, really, Stockholm is not that far away.” Beatty won an Oscar for best director of Reds in 1981 and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 2000 for his “consistently high quality of motion picture production.” He has been nominated for an additional 14 Oscars.\n\nIn a more serious vein, Beatty said the movie industry needs to “deal with the brevity of the attention span,” the diversion of attention “from serious matters to more entertaining matters.” He said the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia—which won seven Oscars and which he described as “one of the greatest movies ever made”—\"is four hours long, it can only play one time a night and it’s not a sequel.”\n\nSuggesting it could not be made today, he said, “I think we have some thinking to do about that.”"
