        "text": "Glen Powell is having quite the Hollywood moment. Fresh off the rom-com Anyone But You and awaiting the release of Hit Man and Twisters, Powell is lining up another project.\n\nTHR has confirmed that the actor will appear in a remake of Heaven Can Wait. Newsletter Puck was the first to report the news. The original Heaven Can Wait, which starred Warren Beatty, was released in 1978 and was later nominated for nine Oscars, including Best Picture.\n\nThe original film saw Beatty as an NFL quarterback who dies prematurely due to an antsy angel and returns to Earth in the body of a recently murdered millionaire.\n\nBeatty directed the film with Buck Henry and co-wrote the script with Elaine May. Per THR, “Powell and Gaghan’s project is said not to be a remake.” Stephen Gaghan is writing the project; the scribe is best known as an Oscar winner for his script for Steven Soderbergh’s 2000 crime film Traffic.\n\nPowell will star in the lead role but will not play football in this version. At the time of writing, there are still limited plot details and the remake remains in the early stages of development."
