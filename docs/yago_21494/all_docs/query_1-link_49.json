        "text": "Heaven Can Wait is a 1978 American comedy film starring Warren Beatty as an American football player who, after being killed in an collision accident, is sent back to earth in the body of a millionaire. The film is a remake of the 1941 film, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, and should not be confused with the 1943 film of the same name.\n\nDirected by Warren Beatty and Buck Henry. Written by Beatty, Elaine May, and an uncredited Robert Towne, from the original stage play Heaven Can Wait by Harry Segall\n\nMr. Jordan\n\n[edit]\n\nHe's been drugged by those two downstairs. This is a murder. See how he's slowly sliding into the water?\n\nThe likelihood of one individual being right increases in direct proportion to the intensity with which others are trying to prove him wrong.\n\nJoe\n\n[edit]\n\nI'm not supposed to be here.\n\nI'm not really Leo Farnsworth.\n\nWe don't care how much it costs, just how much it makes. If it costs too much, we charge a penny more. Would you pay more to save a fish who thinks?\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nJulia: You locked me in a closet!\n\nMax: [whilst training Pendleton in the spacious mansion grounds] This isn't going to work. You're playing football with a bunch of butlers!\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nFormer owner: He got my team. The son of a bitch got my team.\n\nAdvisor: What kind of pressure did he use, Milt?\n\nFormer owner: What I asked for was sixty-seven million, and he said \"okay.\"\n\nAdvisor: Ruthless bastard.\n\nTony: [after ushering the shrieking Mrs. Julia Farnsworth out of her husband's office and, from the doorway] Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Farnsworth. Mrs. Farnsworth saw a mouse.\n\nBetty: She just saw a mouse?\n\nTony: No, before. Outside, but she relives it.\n\nMax: You be the trainer and I'll start on Sunday.\n\nJoe: I'm starting against Dallas? What about Jarrett?\n\nMax: They don't want to go with Jarrett. They want to go with you. Happy Birthday, Joe!\n\nJoe: She love me, Mr. Jordan!\n\nMr. Jordan: Joe, you must abide by what is written.\n\nJoe: Do I... play Polo?\n\nSisk: Not really, sir.\n\nBentley: [on the landing of the elegant stairway, near the closet where Mr. Farnsworth and Joe Pendleton meet with Mr. Jordan, invisible to everyone but himself] I noticed there are two cups.\n\nEverett: Well, Sisk felt that since Mr. Farnsworth was pretending to talk to someone, he might want to pretend to give him cocoa, too.\n\nNewspaperman: Mr. Farnsworth, isn't it true an accident in your west coast nuclear plant could stimulate seismic activity in the San Andreas fault, which could destroy most of Southern California?\n\nTony: I think you'd have to define \"destroy\".\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nHeaven Can Wait quotes at the Internet Movie Database\n\nHeaven Can Wait at Allmovie\n\nHeaven Can Wait at Mojo\n\nHeaven Can Wait at Rotten Tomatoes"
