        "text": "Ernst Lubitchâ€™s first film in color is a gorgeous evocation of idealized Americana through three generations and a charming if meandering romantic comedy.\n\nMarch 8, 2024\n\n... This comedy is quite audacious in its liberal idea of what virtue looks like.\n\nOctober 24, 2022\n\nWhat begins as a sprightly comedy eventually turns into an affecting look at loneliness, ageism and mortality.\n\nJune 7, 2021\n\nThe genius of Ernst Lubitsch is appreciated, but it's not at the level of his best films. [Full Review in Spanish]\n\nNovember 14, 2022\n\nCount German expat Ernst Lubitsch among the directors whose films require a darkened theater and a willing audience to even work -- you just won't get him at home on your flatscreen.\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nHeaven Can Wait may be 73 years old, but it's vibrant and alive, and teaching us anew the central language of film.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\n... A smooth, appealing and highly commercial production. Lubitsch has endowed it with light, amusing sophistication and heart-warming nostalgia.\n\nNovember 14, 2022\n\nScripted by Raphaelson, Lubitsch's frequent collaborator, this light, suave comedy of manners (his first in color) displays what's known as the Lubitsch touch, and would have been more successful with a more charismatic actor than Don Ameche.\n\nJune 11, 2019"
