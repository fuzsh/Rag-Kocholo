        "text": "Warren Beatty and a ridiculously overqualified supporting cast team up for a movie that’s one part Arthur, one part It’s a Wonderful Life, but all in all pretty fun.\n\nThe movie was up for a bunch of Academy Awards, and I’m not really sure why. It’s a fun movie, but best director? Best actor? Best picture? I don’t know about that.\n\nBeatty plays Joe Pendleton, a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams, who’s killed when he’s hit by a car while riding his bike. Only he wasn’t supposed to have been killed, and an angel (Buck Henry) pulled him out too soon. To make things right, another angel, Mr. Jordan (James Mason) tries to get him back in his body, only it’s already been cremated. Instead, he’s placed in the body of Leo Farnsworth, business magnate with ethical issues who’s just been murdered by his wife (Dyan Cannon) and his personal secretary (Charles Grodin).\n\nThough he sees himself in the mirror and we of course see him on screen, the other characters see him as Mr. Farnsworth. This causes some problems with his wife and secretary, who thought they had gotten away with murder.\n\nThough Pendleton now occupies the body of a man who was killed, and they’ll almost certainly try again, he’s not at all concerned by that. He’s concerned with trying to make the world a better place, as reporter Betty Logan (Julie Christie) brings to his attention all the ways his company is harming the environment.\n\nAnd eventually he wants to play in the Super Bowl for the Rams, so he gets his old buddy, trainer Max Corkle (Jack Warden) to help him out.\n\nBeatty and Warden have really great chemistry together and perhaps the most enjoyable scene in the movie is the one where Pendleton in Farnsworth’s body has to convince Max that it’s really him.\n\nThis is some classic screwball comedy stuff. The movie feels like it comes from another era, and it is after all a remake of a ’40s movie. But that can be a good thing in a way. It’s all some harmless fun.\n\nRating: 6/10"
