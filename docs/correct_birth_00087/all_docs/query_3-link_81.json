        "text": "FONTANA >> Long before he changed the face of NASCAR and earned a future first-round Hall of Fame inclusion, Jeff Gordon was just a young kid who had already impressed Southern California race fans.\n\nAnd that was before he won the inaugural 500-mile race at the new state-of-the-art California Speedway in 1997.\n\nGordon, who will start seventh for today’s Sprint Cup Auto Club 400, has announced this will be his last full-time season in NASCAR’s premier series after 23 seasons, 92 wins and four championships.\n\nPHOTOS: See Saturday’s racing action\n\n“I always said I wanted to step away on my own terms if possible, and I want to be competitive out there, and I hoped that I could do that all the way through my final year,” Gordon said in late January before the start of the currently season. “This is the right time. (I’m) looking forward to spending more time with my family, but most of all looking forward to just that next chapter of my life working with Hendrick Motorsports and other partners.”\n\nBut before he reached stock car’s top level, Gordon and stepfather John Bickford were regulars at tracks throughout the state. They would journey from their Vallejo home, sometimes headed south to Pomona to compete at the quarter-midget track as a pre-teen.\n\n“There was a really great quarter midget track and I remember racing there,” Gordon said this week at Auto Club Speedway. “ We did okay. We were always fast. I mean I think I set a track record there one time, may have won a race or two there.\n\n“We didn’t race there a lot. It was a cool track. Really high banks, it was sort of like the Bristol of quarter midget races. It was the highest banked track that we had. Super-fast I think we were in the five second bracket at that track. That is getting it done around a 1/20th of a mile race track.”\n\nGordon also recalled competing in a go-kart in later years in Corona.\n\n“One of the fondest memories that I have from that go-kart event was (Olympic gold medalist) Bruce Jenner was racing in that race and I passed him,” Gordon said. “He had about 100 more horsepower than me and I passed him. I was like ‘that’s cool I just passed Bruce Jenner’.\n\n“But those were different times, different times. The Southern California racers, their cars were the shiniest, their cars were polished, their cars were beautifully painted. Some of them were capable of going fast too. We (the Northern California drivers) were just focused on making them go fast.”\n\nAnd Gordon went fast. He moved into sprint car at the young age, but was hampered by state age restrictions. Therefore the family moved to Indiana to further his career. Eight years later, Gordon was the NASCAR Winston Cup Series rookie of the year, the start of the sport’s transformation in two areas.\n\n“Truly, he’s been one of the greatest drivers that’s ever been in the sport. But a guy who’s done so much to help other people,” said team owner Rick Hendrick, who signed Gordon to a contract in 1992. “I mean, how many of the drivers that are here today would never have had the opportunity if Jeff Gordon didn’t blaze a trail at such a young age from a different series?’’\n\nMostly those from California. NASCAR, at the time, was mostly a Southeastern sport but when the green flag drops Sunday at ACS there will be 10 drivers from the state.\n\n“There is definitely a lot of racing (in the state) and I think when you look at way back in the day, it was mostly a southeastern sport,” said Kevin Harvick, the 2014 Cup champion from Bakersfield. “I think Jeff Gordon was obviously somewhat responsible for being able to allow guys like myself and pave the way for us to have a path to have an opportunity to come and race in NASCAR.”\n\nThat would include El Cajon’s Jimmie Johnson, a six-time champion, Casey Mears (also from Bakersfield), AJ Allmendinger (Los Gatos), Kyle Larson (Elk Grove) and David Gilliland (Chino Hills).\n\n“He opened the door for (Tony) Stewart, and Stewart opened the door further for myself and Kasey Kahne, Ricky Stenhouse,” said Johnson, whose Chevrolet is co-owned by Gordon. “Now we have more drivers from the state of California than any other state, so it’s wild to think in NASCAR that that’s the case, and I think Jeff is responsible for that trend happening..”\n\nGordon’s impact was also felt in how owners selected their drivers. Pre-Gordon, the Cup model was for drivers to spend time gaining experience with underfunded teams before being promoted to top-tier teams. However, Gordon’s success changed that way of thinking.\n\n“It changed the whole perception of how you looked at a driver,” Harvick said. “Everybody wanted older, experienced guys at that point who wouldn’t tear up the cars. Then the next thing you know, everyone was looking for the next wave of talent to be like Jeff. So it changed the way that the sport worked.\n\n“If you look at the end of those late ‘90s, early 2000 up until 2001, I mean if you look at the leap that (Dale) Earnhardt’s career took . . . his wealth and the sponsors and the things that he had, a lot of that, in my opinion, had to do with Jeff Gordon.”\n\nJohnson: “He really was instrumental, in my opinion, in helping car owners and sponsors realize that there are drivers far and wide that can come in and be competitive.”\n\nLike Gordon’s 2016 replacement, Chase Elliott. The 19-year-old, who won the Xfinity Series in 2014, is among the new crop of young drivers waiting to move up.\n\nHow young? Elliott, son of former Cup titlist Bill Elliott, was born the same year Gordon won his first championship (1999).\n\nSo what will Gordon’s future be like?\n\n“I have not even attempted to go down that path yet. I want to leave this season competitive and up front and winning races and in the Chase with a chance at the championship,” said Gordon. “So we have a little work to do here first before I can start thinking about anything else.”"
