        "text": "Jeffrey Michael \"Jeff\" Gordon is an American former professional stock car racing driver, currently an announcer for Fox NASCAR, and a top executive for Hendrick Motorsports. He formerly drove the No. 24 Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports in 23 full-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series seasons between 1993 and 2015, and served as a substitute driver for Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet in select races during the 2016 season.\n\nGordon started his professional racing career in the Busch Series with Hugh Connerty Racing, followed by Bill Davis Racing, winning three races, and began racing full-time in the Cup Series for Hendrick Motorsports in 1993, winning Rookie of the Year. He is a four-time Sprint Cup champion, having won the title in 1995, 1997, 1998, and 2001. He also won the Daytona 500 three times in 1997, 1999, and 2005. Gordon won the Winston Million in 1997 (winning three of the four major races in a NASCAR season) and is only one of two drivers to do so. He is third on the all-time Cup wins list with 93 career wins, the most in NASCAR's modern era (1972–present). Gordon's 81 pole positions led all active drivers and is third all-time; Gordon won at least one pole in 23 consecutive seasons, making this a NASCAR record. He was also the active \"iron man\" leader for consecutive races participated in with 797 through the 2015 season.[2]\n\nIn 1998, NASCAR named Gordon to its 50 Greatest Drivers list.[3] In 2008, ten years later, ESPN's Terry Blount ranked him 10th in the 25 Greatest Drivers of All-Time.[4] Foxsports.com named him as the fifth-best NASCAR driver of all time.[5]\n\nGordon, along with Rick Hendrick, co-owns the No. 48 Chevrolet driven by Jimmie Johnson, who won seven Cup championships from 2006 to 2010, 2013, and in 2016. Gordon also has an equity stake in the No. 24 team.[6] Gordon also owned a Busch Series team between 1999 and 2000, Gordon/Evernham Motorsports (co-owned with Ray Evernham; later solely owned as JG Motorsports), winning twice.\n\nGordon was born in Vallejo, California and raised in Pittsboro, Indiana. He currently resides in Charlotte, North Carolina with his wife, Ingrid Vandebosch and their two children Ella Sofia and Leo Benjamin."
