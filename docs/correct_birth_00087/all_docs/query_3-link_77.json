        "meta_description": "By Michael Vega - Boston Globe Growing up in Northern California, Jeff Gordon didn’t have a Jeff Gordon to look up to when he started racing open-wheeled sprint cars on the dirt track circuits near his home in Vallejo. Quite the contrary, Gordon’s racing heroes were named A.J. Foyt, Rick Mears, and Al Unser. They were",

Two days later, Hendrick signed Gordon.\n\n“Until he showed up and got in a Cup car at a young age, no one had ever done that,’’ Hendrick said. “Then to go out and win the championship in his third year was amazing. Then to be so competitive and dominate the sport there, and then in this past year what he was able to do leading the points and be such a factor in the Chase. Truly, he’s been one of the greatest drivers that’s ever been in the sport. But a guy who’s done so much to help other people. I mean, how many of the drivers that are here today would never have had the opportunity if Jeff Gordon didn’t blaze a trail at such a young age from a different series?’’\n\nCount Kyle Busch among current Sprint Cup stars who pointed to Gordon as an inspiration.\n\nBusch, 29, driver of the No. 18 Toyota, was Gordon’s teammate at Hendrick from 2003-07. Busch’s former crew chief, Alan Gustafson, now serves Gordon in that capacity.\n\n“I think Jeff was obviously a huge inspiration to me being a NASCAR Sprint Cup driver,’’ Busch said. “I mean, he was kind of the guy I looked at and wanted to model myself after in getting to the Sprint Cup Series.’’\n\nGordon was also responsible for bringing aboard Jimmie Johnson as the driver of the No. 48, a team formed through a partnership between Gordon and Hendrick. It was a fortuitous move, as Johnson went on to win six Sprint Cup titles."
