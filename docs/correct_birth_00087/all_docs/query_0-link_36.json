        "text": "Jeff Gordon is an American stock car driver and was only five years old when he first performed laps on a rudimentary racetrack. Inspired from a very young age to be the best in everything he endeavored, racing came to him naturally and he embraced this gift with great zeal. He is best known as the four-time NASCAR Cup Series winner and the four-time Brickyard 400 winner. Jeff Gordon is the perfect amalgam of resolve, hard work, and years of experience who has managed to achieve an unequaled roster of triumphs. The young man from California, who had dreams of ‘making it big’ in his life, jumped behind the wheel and his competitive spirit quickly kindled. While other kids from California dreamt of playing with toys and went to loud, vibrant theme parks, Jeff, at just six years of age, won 35 main events and set numerous track records, which now speaks volumes about his talent and passion. From winning the illustrious Winston Cup title to the Rookie of the Year award and the Daytona title, Gordon has come a long way in the world of speed. Today, his track wins have made him a multi-millionaire and he modestly attributes his success to the fact that his parents stood by him. Scroll further to learn more about this intriguing sports personality and his inspiring life story."
