        "text": "In the ensuing years, Kentucky Speedway became a regular fixture on the ARCA, IndyCar, Truck, and Xfinity schedules with drivers and fans from every league singing the speedway’s praises. The Xfinity races were a particularly impressive highlight, consistently featuring sell-out crowds who’d descend on the facility to show their support not just for racing, but to make a case for Jerry Carroll’s goal of luring the “big league” Cup Series.\n\nThe enthusiasm apparently wasn’t mutual, however. And why would it be? Kentucky Speedway was drawing crowds, and money, to NASCAR’s lower divisions in ways that other tracks could only dream of. Meanwhile, the (then R.J. Reynolds Tobacco sponsored) Winston Cup Series was continuing to print money hand over fist with established tracks, dates, and traditions elsewhere. To be frank: Kentucky Speedway desired the Cup Series more than the Cup Series desired Kentucky Speedway.\n\n• • •\n\nIn the history of American professional sports, anti-trust lawsuits were once almost as common as endorsement deals. The entrenched hierarchies of baseball, football, and hockey had all welcomed mergers and expansion over the decades in order to fend off such legal maneuvering. These changes weren’t necessarily welcomed by wealthy executives, but they beat the alternative of potentially losing their pseudo-protected monopolies in court. As NASCAR’s popularity kept growing in the early 2000’s, and the organization’s grip on the American racing industry tightened, those who felt they were being kept on the outside began to grow disgruntled. Jerry Carroll was one of them.\n\nHe had every reason to be frustrated. The man had seemingly done everything right. He’d not only gotten the track built, but also proved he could fill the stands that surrounded it. Just why didn’t the local racing fans of the region deserve to the see the top stars come to town? And at the same time: why didn’t he and his partners deserve to make large amounts of money off that? It all came to a head in 2005 when, while in pursuit of this goal, Carroll filed an anti-trust lawsuit against NASCAR and the International Speedway Corporation.\n\nISC was a business that specialized in the management of race tracks. It also had deep ties to NASCAR with both organizations having been founded by Bill France Sr., a former race car driver and one-time campaign manager for overtly racist Alabama Governor/failed presidential candidate, George Wallace. After France Sr. passed away in 1992, his sons succeeded him as the heads of both NASCAR and ISC. When Kentucky Speedway launched its anti-trust lawsuit in 2005, 18 of the 36 Cup races that season were scheduled to take place at ISC-owned tracks. Another 10 were held at tracks owned by a different group with a close, but not incestuous NASCAR relationship: Speedway Motorsports, Incorporated. This left only 8 races in the schedule hosted by facilities which featured independent ownership in a fashion similar to Kentucky.\n\nCarroll and his team were in a situation that appeared to paint them as a group of Davids taking on Goliath—a fight for the fans against the big guys. Things weren’t that altruistic, however. A review of court documents featured in a 2007 Cincinnati Enquirer exposé revealed: luring the Cup Series wasn’t just about bringing top tier racing to the cheering masses, but also, to make the speedway more valuable and turn a higher profit in a future, potential sale. From the exposé, which quoted court documents: “…if a track has a [sponsor] Cup event, it makes the track a completely different product to potential purchasers as well. … With a Cup race, the track becomes incredibly profitable. For this reason, Kentucky Speedway has tried since the inception of the racetrack to try to obtain a [sponsor] Cup race.”\n\nThat strategy had paid off for the similarly sized Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Opened in 1996, that facility had secured a Cup race for 1998 and then immediately found a buyer in Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Carroll and his investors, however, had come to the speedway building boom somewhat late. By Kentucky Speedway’s 2000 opening, the Cup Series was controlled by established power brokers who oversaw a jam-packed schedule that ran nearly every weekend between February and November.\n\nThe Enquirer exposé also alleged that ISC had once attempted to purchase Kentucky Speedway, but that Carroll and his team had rejected their “below-market value” offer (for their part, ISC officials denied ever having made an offer). The lawsuit was a gamble, but seemingly the best bet, and outside of the courtroom walls—things seemed fairly harmonious. Even as the legal proceedings wore on over the next few years, NASCAR continued to run both its Xfinity and Craftsman Truck series at the speedway each season.\n\nIn January 2008, however, Judge William Bertelsman ruled in favor or NASCAR and ISC by throwing out the lawsuit. As reported in The Cincinnati Enquirer, the U.S. District Court official stated:\n\n“After careful consideration and a thorough review of the record, and granting [Kentucky] Speedway the benefit of the doubt on all reasonable inferences therefrom, the court concludes that [Kentucky] Speedway has failed to make out its case.”\n\n- Judge William Bertelsman as quoted in The Cincinnati Enquirer on January 8, 2008.\n\nCarroll and his team vowed to appeal, while NASCAR and ISC believed that the ruling firmly established their right to work as they pleased. From the same Cincinnati Enquirer reporting, NASCAR officials stated: “[the judgement] puts an end to any question about which locations and dates NASCAR can operate its races.”\n\nKentucky Speedway had been dealt a huge blow, but they weren’t down for the count (or out of the race?) just yet. In the months following the court’s ruling, the aforementioned Speedway Motorsports Incorporated began approaching Kentucky Speedway officials about selling. SMI’s relationship with NASCAR was close, but not always rosy. Boasting several tracks in his portfolio and controlling the second-most amount of races on the Cup Series schedule, SMI owner Bruton Smith had clashed with both NASCAR and ISC officials about race dates before. If the sale went through, Kentucky Speedway would be his—and SMI’s—ninth track. He would have some serious clout, and money, but ultimately NASCAR would have to approve any Cup race occurring there.\n\nIn the end, Kyle Busch not only won the track’s inaugural Cup Series race, but he’d also led the most laps and held the pole. It was an historic victory for the 26-year old racing star, but as soon as the broadcast ended—the conversation switched almost exclusively to the automobile drama that had occurred outside of the racetrack.\n\n• • •\n\n“Traffic snarl has race fans fuming,”\n\n…proclaimed the headline in The Courier-Journal of Louisville the next morning.\n\nThe recounting of fan grievances wasn’t just limited to the local markets, rather, the whole debacle played out in media across the country. Reports abounded of fans simply parking their cars in interstate medians so that they could just get out and walk to the track. Several spectators, who were still sitting in traffic when the race began, were reportedly instructed by police to “turn around” in an effort to make the eventual post-race mass exodus easier. Kentucky Speedway’s new owner, Bruton Smith, had even quipped to the press before the Saturday evening race that: “we expect everybody to be home by Tuesday.” Traffic problems had been anticipated, but the debacle was far worse than anyone could’ve imagined—giving the facility a black eye that would be remembered for years to come.\n\nAmongst the fallout, SMI and the state of Kentucky quickly made plans to shore things up. By the next race in 2012, the track had purchased more land for parking and the state had invested “more than $11 Million” to upgrade local infrastructure. By most accounts, things really did improve and even more adjustments would continue to be made over the years as the speedway settled into its position on the Cup Series schedule.\n\n• • •\n\nThe inaugural Quaker State 400 of 2011 had technically been a sellout (even if all the fans hadn’t made it to their seats). The event had been a long time coming, and had finally brought the Cup Series to a geographic region it hadn’t yet served, but NASCAR had already been suffering from a steady decline in interest. Most sources seem to agree that the organization started to see its television ratings falter in 2005. Things weren’t dire, but over the next several years: the organization’s general prominence and position in mainstream culture certainly started to slip. There’s been numerous think pieces written on this over the years, but the general consensus seems to land on a combination of popular drivers retiring, an aging fanbase, failure to attract younger viewers, and a bevy of confusing rule changes all lending to the greater perception problem. The Cup Series had also adopted a new vehicle model (dubbed “The Car of Tomorrow”) that proved to not only be unpopular with its most dedicated fans, but also caused chaos for driver performance. During the Indianapolis Motor Speedway’s prominent Brickyard 400 race in 2008: spectators were treated to the cars mostly trudging along under caution flags (when it’s illegal for drivers to pass or change position) due to constant vehicle issues. When the slow, sordid affair was finally over: furious fans in attendance, and those somehow still managing to watch on television, had simply spent their day watching the top drivers of the era limp around in a boring parade of bad tires and pit stops.\n\nRight or wrong (depending on what kind of fans you talk to or come across on the internet), NASCAR did continually try to make improvements to its overall product in an effort to combat the decline. The car situation eventually got sorted, new driver names rose to prominence, and the organization continually tweaked the scoring format in an effort to make races more meaningful and competitive. All these adjustments over a quick time, however, seemed to divide fans. Generally, it seemed as if the old guard bemoaned the idea of the various “playoff” formats, and even if younger fans were excited about those changes—casual viewers found the ever-changing rules confusing. All of this was playing out as the races themselves began to appear less frequently on widely available, over-the-air network television in favor of various cable networks. By the time Kentucky Speedway joined the Cup Series schedule, NASCAR was in the midst of near-constant upheaval and decreasing viewership—a situation that compounded the track’s other lingering issues.\n\nWhile the traffic problems were resolved mostly within a year, there was still the subject that Kyle Petty and Larry McReynolds had joked about during that inaugural broadcast: Kentucky Speedway’s surface was rough. Although the track had adequately served the lower circuits for a decade, it was beginning to show its age when the Cup Series arrived with a new generation of cars and faster speeds. As the Quaker State 400 continued to be run every summer, both drivers and fans often credited Kentucky as NASCAR’s roughest track. While this was occasionally used for marketing and promotional efforts, it wasn’t always seen as a positive attribute for the drivers who had to run over that surface for several hours. Major renovations between 2015 and 2016 brought repaving and a reconfiguration of banking in the turns, but despite the improvements for the drivers themselves—Cup Series racing at the track featured yet another problem: it was boring.\n\nGranted, “boring” is a subjective term, but generally speaking—the internet and the folks I spoke with for this story seem to share the same opinion of racing at Kentucky Speedway. The tri-oval shape and 1.5 mile length wasn’t unique in the schedule and with its Cup Series race being run in the middle of a long season, there never really seemed to be much at stake for the drivers in terms of points standings. Combined with the track’s conditions that still proved to be a challenge for drivers despite the renovations, Kentucky was often stereotyped with featuring “follow the leader racing” with few contested, exciting lead changes.\n\nSure, the speedway’s races featured their share of drama, crashes, and even a couple close finishes over the years, but the overall impression seemed to be that a dominant driver would typically get out front and rarely be challenged. This was a common phenomenon at NASCAR’s tri-oval tracks, but Kentucky with its lower banked turns and rough surface made competition even more difficult with the mantra seeming to be: better to finish in whatever position of a meaningless mid-season race than to wreck yourself attempting to win. Even the track’s inaugural Cup Series winner, Kyle Busch, would bluntly imply to journalist Jason Hoffman of The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2020 that the track was lackluster.\n\nThose still tuning in to NASCAR television could also see that in-person interest was dropping as well. NASCAR eventually began keeping its attendance numbers confidential and prevented tracks from releasing their own estimates, but many journalists around the country were able to make their own educated guesses. Both The Courier-Journal out of Louisville and the Cincinnati Enquirer would note that there hadn’t been a sellout at Kentucky Speedway since the traffic-challenged first year in 2011. 2012 and 2013 saw issues with both rain and record heat, but after the 2014 race which ran in good conditions on its scheduled date—the paper’s estimated that only 60-80,000 of the speedway’s 107,000 seats had been filled. There’s no official statistics for the races that came after, but even just a casual viewing of the subsequent Cup Series events at Kentucky will show glaring patches of empty seats among the crowd. Kentucky Speedway wasn’t the only track facing attendance struggles, but it was one that also suffered from a negative reputation while trying to exist within a rapidly changing motorsports landscape.\n\nNASCAR certainly wasn’t the only racing organization struggling for viewership, interest, and fan support, though. After reuniting as a singular entity in 2008, IndyCar had a renewed focus and was shaking things up to try and reach fresh audiences. To execute this strategy, the American open-wheel racing circuit would abandon Kentucky after their 2011 running. Both IndyCar and NASCAR were contending with the rise of a new competitor, however.\n\nWhen it came to American audiences, European based Formula One had spent decades in relative obscurity. Multiple events were attempted with varying degrees of success over the decades, but nothing seemed to really stick until the Circuit of the Americas opened in Austin, Texas in 2012. Combined with the league’s other worldwide ambitions and use of both traditional, and digital, media to promote themselves—Formula One began to get a strong foothold in the States. Even in 2020, it was reporting ever-increasing tv viewership (despite the challenges of a season rattled by a global pandemic) and making plans for more events across the globe, especially in the US. As of this writing, Formula One now holds three American races which all feature their own Super Bowl-style cultural frenzy.\n\n• • •\n\nThe effects of the COVID-19 outbreak took a toll on all facets of life and sporting events, and NASCAR was certainly no different, but it did manage to run most of its 72nd season. By the time July 2020 rolled around, NASCAR made its annual pilgrimage to Sparta, Kentucky. Although no fans were allowed in attendance due to pandemic-related restrictions, the race proved to be one of Kentucky’s most competitive. Pundits noted that the track’s repairs over the years were finally starting to pay off. Along with the surface now being seasoned and the driver’s being familiar with the track’s quirks, NASCAR’s newest “Gen-6” stock car had seemed to perform well at the track in the last few years. At the end of the Quaker State 400’s 2020 running, rookie Cole Custer made a risky outside pass right as the white flag dropped to signal the final lap. The pack of leading cars went to an (unheard of for Kentucky) four-wide spread in the first turn as Custer gambled and gunned it—shooting out front with everything he and his car had.\n\n• • •\n\nIt’s important to note that Kentucky Speedway isn’t abandoned, rather, inactive is the more accurate term. Along with NASCAR, ARCA (who was purchased by NASCAR in 2018) also withdrew from the facility. Combined with IndyCar’s departure nearly a decade earlier, the track was no longer on the schedule of any large scale series.\n\nIn 2021, the grounds became a staging area for Ford trucks awaiting parts during supply chain shortages and a music festival was held in 2022, but the only current motorsports action seems to be the recent addition of The Richard Petty Driving Experience. Found at numerous tracks around the country, the attraction allows fans to ride along or even drive a stock car around the track if they have the cash (it should be noted that this appears to be a different operation than the Rusty Wallace Racing Experience that was at the center of a 2015 attendee death and subsequent lawsuit).\n\n• • •\n\nFor as long as I’ve known Matt Wilkes, he’s been a racing fan. The guy can tell you about almost any kind of autosport, but NASCAR was once his bread-and-butter (or “hush-pups-and-catfish” as he’d probably prefer me to say). We’d both grown up watching, but unlike me, he stuck with it. Over the years, Matt’s seen races across the country. He’s been to Taladega while visiting family in his home state of Alabama, once went round trip in a day from his Cincinnati home to Bristol, and he’d regularly catch the Brickyard 400 in nearby Indianapolis. Of course, he also visited Kentucky—making it a point to grab a seat at the inaugural 2011 Cup Series race. He’ll be the first to tell you, though, that his “home” track was far from his favorite. In fact, he didn’t even bother going to races there after awhile, despite still being an avid fan.\n\nA few months following the trip down to photograph the speedway, Matt and I met up at a suburban Cincinnati sports bar for wings and to watch the final race of the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series season. There were a few acknowledgements of NASCAR on the bar’s walls—the kinds of knickknacks that would’ve been all over gas stations and similar watering holes when we were kids—but unlike in our youth: NASCAR was hardly on anyone’s mind. We managed to find the race playing on one screen behind the bar, without sound, and barely competing with the football, soccer, and cable news attracting the other patrons’ attention.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to our meetup, as I started researching this story, I’d begun watching NASCAR again (that is, when I could actually locate it on tv or streaming). I found myself getting excited and remembering the way I felt as a kid. There were even a few races where I threw my notebook to the side and paced in front of the television to watch as a contest came to a dramatic conclusion. By the time Matt and I found ourselves at the bar, though, it was almost as if we’d talked ourselves out of being excited. That last race of 2023 dragged on in the background as we caught up and got distracted by talking—a lot of that conversation centering on Matt attempting to explain two decades worth of rule changes to me. Despite that race promising not just a winner, but also featuring four drivers competing in a playoff championship, we just weren’t invested. We didn’t even stay to till the end, both of us needing to get on with our days and tired of craning our necks towards a small television.\n\nIn the parking lot before heading home, I attempted to find some over-the-air or digital radio version of the race, but it was to no avail. I didn’t even find out who won the race or championship until later that night when I happened to remember to look it up. Still, this whole Kentucky Speedway subject had me intrigued and I made a promise: come February of 2024, I’d tune in for the season kickoff Daytona 500 and make an effort to follow the series again.\n\nAs of this writing in June 2024, however, I’ve still yet to watch a race this season.\n\nI’m not saying that my experience is indicative of every potential viewer out there, rather, just pointing out that NASCAR can be a difficult commitment for the general public. The organization is embracing digital media and getting content out there, but it’s still difficult to just tune in for a race. Consumers no longer want a package of sports networks and much like Major League Baseball, until NASCAR becomes easier to access—they’ll continue to struggle with reaching potential viewers. And even as NASCAR attempts to innovate, the costs of running the league are incredible. Tires, fuel, and parts cost money. Lots of money. Money that must be spent in an era of increasing environmental concern. No matter how you may feel about the topic of climate change, the economics don’t lie—it’s on the mind of consumers. In just over a decade, the NASCAR Cup Series went from being a mainstream cultural mainstay to the kind of subject that inspires even its own fans to ask whether or not it could once again “break the dam of legitimacy.” The challenges faced by the organization aren’t insurmountable, but they’re certainly tough challenges none-the-less.\n\nMy personal interest in this story wasn’t ever really about competitive racing, but rather, chasing a sense of nostalgia and “civic” pride. After all, Kentucky Speedway was the closest thing my hometown of Cincinnati had to a “major league” track and what made the whole thing compelling as a kid wasn’t just the race, but the idea of a big race coming here. And once it did, I never went. Something I’ll absolutely rectify If the Cup Series ever returns.\n\nSuch a thing seems unlikely at this moment, though. In an ongoing effort to reinvent itself, NASCAR has continued to embrace even more road courses while also promoting special events such as dirt track racing—an affair they run in both traditional venues like Bristol and eclectic venues such as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. IndyCar, NASCAR’s contemporary domestic competitor, also seems to continually be moving away from smaller oval tracks—further casting doubt upon a Kentucky Speedway revival. There is a situation out of North Carolina to consider, however. Once abandoned and left for dead, the NASCAR Cup Series has returned to a revitalized and historic North Wilkesboro Speedway.\n\nWhat, if anything, will ultimately become of Kentucky Speedway remains to be seen. The track is still under the ownership of Speedway Motorsports, but repeated e-mails and calls seeking a comment have gone unanswered (I was also unable to locate communications for Jerry Carroll and Darrell Waltrip—two folks whose thoughts I’d truly love to hear on the facility’s current situation). No matter what complications the track may have faced in its brief existence, there’s no doubt thousands of fans whose hearts have weighed heavy in the wake of NASCAR’s departure. So long as the speedway still stands, there’s still hope for racing’s return.\n\n• • •\n\nAs I finally got ready to publish this story in early June 2024, I made one more trip down to the speedway. To an outsider, things seemed to still be in good condition with little changed from our visit in 2023. It would be overly-dramatic to label the place as a modern day equivalent to Rome’s famous ruin—but racing has, for now at least, has become part of the past in Sparta, KY. Even if the coliseum still stands.\n\nWhat follows is a video from my visit to the area on June 13, 2024. An evening spent overlooking the speedway in the summer heat beneath the buzzing of power lines and the sounds of cicadas. The attached audio comes from the EPSN broadcast of Kentucky Speedway’s inaugural event: the Craftsman Truck Series’ 2000 running of the Kroger 225.\n\nA race which occurred 24 years to the date of this article being published."
