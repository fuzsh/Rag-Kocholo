        "text": "Jeff Gordon Biography\n\nJeff Gordon is a NASCAR legend who wracked up 93 Sprint Cup Series wins. Gordon focused specifically on stock car racing and has been racing since he was five years old with quarter midgets. Born in California in 1971, he had amazingly already won 35 main events and set five track records by the age of six. At the age of 12, Gordon had a slight change of heart as he took up waterskiing for a year before returning to racing. He currently drives the No. 24 Chevrolet SS for Hendrick Motorsports in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and has competed in 761 races over the past 23 years in the Sprint Cup Series, obtaining over 450 top finishes. As one of the most notable competitors of his time, he was named one of NASCAR’s 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998. Gordon has received a countless amount of titles and awards over the years and only continues to earn more. Off the track, he is a very respectable citizen, as well, as he uses his talent and earnings to better the community around him. Gordon has established the Jeff Gordon Children’s Foundation to help support children facing life-threatening and chronic illnesses, opened the Jeff Gordon Children’s Hospital at the NorthEast Medical Center, cofounded a charitable organization that helps professional athletes give back to the community and sponsored a Drive to End Hunger program. Jeff Gordon is highly admired by all those who know him and even many who don’t.\n\nBook Jeff Gordon for your Next Event"
