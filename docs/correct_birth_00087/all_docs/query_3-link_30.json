        "text": "Jeff Gordon's debut at NASCAR's highest level came at Atlanta Motor Speedway on the last weekend of the 1992 season. His first race was Richard Petty's final one, and that should've been a clue Gordon had a knack for special moments.\n\nIn 1994, Gordon won the inaugural Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It was, to say the least, a popular victory in Indiana, given how Gordon spent much of his youth in the Hoosier State as a budding race star.\n\nNASCAR ran its final race at tiny North Wilkesboro (N.C.) Speedway in 1996. Gordon led the final 79 laps and finished almost two seconds ahead of runner-up Dale Earnhardt.\n\nGordon's other “home state” is California — he was born in Vallejo — so his victory in Fontana in 1997 also was popular. It also was the first Cup event at the track now known as Auto Club Speedway.\n\nDaytona's midseason race became a late-season event in 1998 when wildfires forced a postponement. It was the first Daytona race under the lights. Gordon won, and it was his 11th win of that season."
