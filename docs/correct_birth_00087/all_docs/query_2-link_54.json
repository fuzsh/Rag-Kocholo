        "text": "Born on August 4, 1971, in Vallejo, California, Jeff Gordon began competitive auto racing at age five.\n\nHe notched four Series Cup championships after joining NASCAR’s top circuit in 1992, his popularity helping to expand the sport’s appeal to a mainstream audience.\n\nDale Earnhardt, Sr. respected the young Gordon when he entered the series and began to win a lot of races.\n\nJeff was ‘The Man’ during his career. Many companies wanted to work with him.\n\nHere’s Jeff at the Driver’s Meeting before the Brickyard 400. You’re not supposed to take photos in here, but my photographer didn’t know that, lol.\n\nAmong NASCAR’s all-time leaders in victories, Gordon announced he was stepping down as a full-time driver in early 2015.\n\nJeffrey Michael Gordon was born on August 4th, 1971, in Vallejo, CA.\n\nParents Will and Carol divorced shortly after he was born. Carol began dating a co-worker named John Bickford.\n\nBickford stoked Jeff’s interest in auto racing before becoming his stepfather.\n\nGordon began racing BMX bikes at age four, and the following year he slipped behind the wheel of a quarter midget for his first competitive driving experience.\n\nHe won the national quarter-midget championship at ages 8 and 10, and continued to dominate older children in go-kart events.\n\nWhen Gordon was 13, the family moved to Pittsboro, Indiana, so he could race powerful sprint cars without the obstacle of a minimum age requirement.\n\nAfter joining the United States Auto Club at 16, he won the organization’s National Midget championship at 19 and its’ Silver Crown championship the following year.\n\nHaving taken an interest in stock cars, Gordon earned a chance to race for owner Hugh Connerty in NASCAR’s Busch Grand National Series in 1990.\n\nHe joined Bill Davis’s team the following year, his first on the circuit full-time, and was named Rookie of the Year.\n\nGordon soon caught the eye of owner Rick Hendrick, who marveled at the young driver’s control of his vehicle.\n\nGordon signed with Hendrick in May 1992, and he made his Winston Cup Series debut that November in what turned out to be auto legend Richard Petty’s final NASCAR race.\n\nNamed the Winston Cup Rookie of the Year in 1993, Gordon broke through with victories in the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway and the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1994.\n\nWith crew chief Ray Evernham and his “Rainbow Warriors” helping to keep the No. 24 DuPont Chevrolet in top form, Gordon claimed his first series championship in 1995.\n\nGordon helped transform auto racing from a regional spectacle into a mainstream sport.\n\nHis corporate image rubbed some of racing’s old guard the wrong way, but even the critics had to acknowledge his immense skills.\n\nGordon became the youngest driver to triumph at the Daytona 500 in 1997 and tied a modern record with 13 victories in 1998, finishing both years as the series champion.\n\nHe notched a fourth championship in 2001 with new crew chief Robbie Loomis in tow, culminating an amazing stretch that produced 56 victories in seven years.\n\nHere’s an autograph card made by Quaker State.\n\nJeff made hundreds of driver appearances over the years for all of his sponsors. Here we are in Arkansas, at a Wal-Mart.\n\nJeff’s merchandise hauler always had an eye catching design.\n\nAnd there was always a crowd at his hauler, buying merchandise.\n\nJeff had fans of all ages and especially children.\n\nJeff was a lot like Dale Earnhardt, Sr., in that fans either loved him or loved to hate him.\n\nA fifth championship proved elusive, but Gordon continued to rank among NASCAR’s elite.\n\nHe won his third Daytona 500 in 2005, and in 2007 he accumulated a modern-record 30 Top-10 finishes en route to a second-place finish in the standings.\n\nBothered by back problems in 2008, Jeff proved more than capable of keeping up with the sport’s young guns in 2014, notching a record fifth Brickyard 400 trophy among his four victories.\n\nGordon announced in January 2015 that the upcoming season would be his last as a full-time NASCAR driver.\n\nAt the time, his 92 career victories were third most all-time, and his four championships ranked fourth.\n\nHe launched the Jeff Gordon Children’s Foundation in 1999 to help fund pediatric cancer research. In 2006, he opened the Jeff Gordon Children’s Hospital in Concord, North Carolina.\n\nPreviously married to Brooke Sealey, a former Miss Winston, Gordon married Belgian model Ingrid Vandebosch in 2006. They have two children, Ella and Leo.\n\nThese next 2 photos are from the Brickyard 400 in 2 different years.\n\nCan you notice any differences?\n\nThis design looks great, but I prefer the flames.\n\nJeff was a fan favorite and a Media Darling. He was interviewed everywhere he went.\n\nMy photographer friend took these next 3 shots. I think they’re pretty good.\n\nYou never see photos like this.\n\nJeff was always easy to work with.\n\nWhen I was working with Jeff, you always expected to stay late because of Winner’s Circle activities. We just thought Jeff would win at every race, and often he did.\n\nThe Daytona 500 and the Brickyard 400 were my favorite races to work. The photo below is from the Brickyard.\n\nAs well as this one also.\n\nA lot of drivers in the veteran ranks didn’t care too much for Jeff’s pretty boy good looks, but the media loved him and he helped bring the sport into mainstream entertainment.\n\nJeff’s car is on display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum.\n\nJeff holds the record for most NASCAR wins at the Brickyard 400, which is held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He has 5 victories.\n\nCan you tell which championship this was?, lol.\n\nHaving an autographed champions photo is pretty cool.\n\nI know a lot of people who would have loved to get into the garage area and get a photo next to their favorite drivers’ car.\n\nThis was the last time I was able to get a pic with Jeff’s car before he retired.\n\nDriving instructors gave me rides around tracks all over the country when I was there for the Driving School.\n\nI was able to drive the number 24 car around Charlotte Motor Speedway, in the heart of NASCAR country.\n\nI was involved in several Winner’s Circles over the years.\n\nIt was my job, on this day of the Daytona 500, to chaperone Bill Goldberg, the wrestler, around the track. He was happy Jeff won and thought going to Winner’s Circle was very cool.\n\nThis was Jeff’s 4th championship. I’m happy to have a photo of Jeff, Rick Hendrick and I.\n\nHendrick Motorsports gave out championship rings to a lot of people involved with the team. My sister received a championship pendant.\n\nSome of the corporate people got rings as well, sized to their fingers and with their names on them.\n\nIt burned my ass to see some guys selling their rings online. I’ll never get rid of mine. I worked too hard for it.\n\nI worked the Brickyard 400 every year, so it was nice to get a ring with my name on it.\n\nWorking with Sam Hornish, Jr. in the IndyCar series was fun and winning two championships was even better.\n\nThe side panel of my ring has both years on it… ’01 & ’02.\n\nThat completes this NASCAR 101 Course.
