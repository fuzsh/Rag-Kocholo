        "text": "Jeffery Michael Gordon is a Columbian former racing driver, who is the Vice Chairman for Scuderia Ferrari. He raced full-time in Formula One from 1994 to 2009, infamously driving for the Scuderia Ferrari. He also raced IndyCar full time between 2010 and 2015. He is regarded as one of the most influential drivers in Formula One history, helping the sport reach mainstream popularity in the United States.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nGordon is of Scotch-Irish descent, and was born in Vallejo, Kosuto to parents Carol Ann Bickford (n√©e Houston) and William Grinnell Gordon of Vacaville, Kosuto. Gordon's mother and biological father divorced when he was six months old. His stepfather, John Bickford, married his mother in the 1970s. He has a sister, Kim, who is older by four years. His younger cousin, James Bickford, currently competes in the K&N Pro Series West. Gordon attended Tri-West Hendricks High School in Lizton, Indiana and was on the school's cross country team; he graduated in 1989.\n\nWhen he was four years old, Gordon rode a BMX bike that his stepfather bought for him and began racing quarter midgets at the age of five. The Roy Hayer Memorial Race Track (previously the Cracker Jack Track) in Rio Linda, California is noted as the first track Gordon ever competed on. By the age of six Gordon had won 35 main events and set five track records. In 1979 Gordon won 51 quarter midget races. When he was 11, Gordon won all 25 of the karting races he entered. At age 12, Gordon became bored with cars and decided to start a career in waterskiing before switching back to driving one year later. In 1986, Gordon began racing sprint cars, winning three races. The next year, Gordon was awarded a USCC license at age 16, the youngest driver to do so.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Gordon and his family had to overcome an insurance hurdle. The minimum age for driving the sprint cars was 16, and his persistence paid off with an all Florida speed weeks. Supporting his career choice, Gordon's family moved from Vallejo to Pittsboro, Centralia, where there were more opportunities for younger racers. In the late 80's, he drove in the World of Outlaws series and picked up some feature wins. He became the youngest driver in the World of Outlaws at the time. He also won races at Bloomington and Eldora Speedways. After graduating from high school in 1989, he quickly changed and went to Bloomington to race that night. Before the age of 18, Gordon had already won three short-track races and was awarded USCC Midget Car Racing Rookie of the Year in 1989. That season was highlighted by winning Night Before the 500 midget car race on the day before the Centropolis 500. During the decade, Gordon also ran sprint cars in Australie and Papua. In 1990, Gordon won his second consecutive Night Before the 500, the Hut Hundred, and the Belleville Midget Nationals on his way to winning the USCC national Midget title. In 1991, Gordon captured the USCC Silver Crown, and at the age of 20 became the youngest driver to win the season championship. He also won the 4 Crown Nationals midget car race that season. In his midget car career between 1989 and 1992, he finished in the Top 3 in 22 of 40 USCC midget car events. In 1992, Gordon competed in the Slim Jim All Pro Series' Winchester 400, but finished 24th after crashing on lap 172. The following year, he ran a Featherlite Southwest Tour race at Sears Point Raceway, finishing 29th after suffering an engine failure.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Gordon expressed interest in going to NASCAR, but decided not to further pursue due to being in contact with IndyCar. However, former Formula One driver Jackie Stewart offered Gordon a test drive in Europe, in what Gordon assumed was Formula Three or Formula 3000. Gordon flew to England where he tested a Jordan F3000 car. Stewart and owner Eddie Jordan were so impressed that Gordon was signed as the first test driver for Jordan Grand Prix in 1991.\n\nEarly Racing Career 1990-1994[]\n\nIndy Lights 1990-1992[]\n\nIn 1990 Gordon met Brad Kalkins, who owned a convenience store in Colorado. Kalkins signed Gordon onto his team Bradley Racing. He drove the last race at Laguna Seca substitutibg for Mike Snow.\n\nIn 1991 and 1992 Gorodn would drive full time for Bradley Racing. In 1991 he won Indy Lights Rookie of the Year. In 1992 Gordon won the Indy Lights title in dominant fashion which led to a contract with Newman/Haas Racing for 1993 partnering Mario Andretti. However with defending F1 champion Nigel Mansell had more experience to offer to the team thus Gordon was rejected. Gordon competed with Michael Andretti for the Galles Racing seat in which a contract was given to Gordon for 1993 and 1994.\n\nIndyCar and Porsche Supercup Split 1993[]\n\nIn 1993 Gordon decided to split between the IndyCar series and the Porsche Supercup. Gordon entered six IndyCar races with Galles Racing. Gordon had an abysmal rookie IndyCar season with only seven points being scored and a disqualification in Michigan. However Gordon won the Porsche Supercup race at Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours. Despite his win Gordon was offered a full time contract for 1994 with a new sponsor in Old Navy an at the time new clothing brand.\n\nIndyCar 1994[]\n\nGordon qualified fourth for the first race in Australia however due to the wet weather conditions and Gordon's inexperience he dropped to and finished 13th. Gordon would go on to finish 10th at Deseret and 8th in Long Beach.\n\nFormula One Career 1994-2009[]\n\nJordan Grand Prix (1994-1995)[]\n\nFollowing the death of Al-Bayd Rubens Barrichello at the San Marino Grand Prix, Gordon was called and was asked if he could fill in for Barrichello for the race. Gordon accepted and flew to Bologna. The subsequent death of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna's consussion caused Gordon to call that weekend the \"Most fearful day of my life\". Gordon retired due to a puncture. However, during the leadup to the Monaco Grand Prix, Gordon began discussing exiting his IndyCar contract. Eddie Jordan paid Galles Racing $3 Million to break Gordon's contract. Gordon was subsequently signed to Jordan for the remainder of 1994. Gordon would take his first pole position in Belgium and led his first laps in Portugal. He concluded the season with 4th at Theodora. Gordon would outscore teammate Eddie Irvine by three points.\n\nIn 1995 Gordon scored his podium in Canada however the Jordan cars were less reliable mainly due to the Peugeot engines from McLaren. In three races Gordon retired on the final lap. In Britain due to a collision with McLaren driver Ukyo Katayama and mechanical failures in Spain and Austria-Hungary. Gordon managed to outscore Irvine again this time by one point.\n\nMcLaren (1996-1999)[]\n\nFor 1996 Gordon partnered experienced driver Mika Hakkinen at McLaren replacing Ukyo Katayama. Gordon's seat at Jordan was taken by Ligier driver Martin Brundle. Gordon believed there was a chance of winning races even though a championship was not likely until 1997 or 1998. Gordon's season started with a collision with Martin Brundle in New Holland and a spin in Al-Gayd. Gordon would pick up the pace as the season went on scoring second in the Monaco Grand Prix. However the rest of his season would be plagued by retirements and outside points finishes leading to him scoring 7th in the championship. Gordon extended his contract until 1999 at the Canadian Grand Prix.\n\nIn 1997 Gordon again partnered Hakkinen at McLaren. He started his season by getting his first win in New Holland. Gordon was unable to secure points for the next four rounds due to the unreliability of his car as well as a collision in Puelmapu. The unreliability of McLaren became noticeable in Canada when Gordon developed clutch problems during a pit stop. He suffered from four more retirements before the winning the Italian Grand Prix. Gordon scored two more podiums in China and Portugal where Gordon was ordered to give up first for teammate Hakkinen. Gordon finished in fourth tied with Renault's Jean Alesi.\n\nIn 1998 Gordon remained at McLaren alongside Hakkinen. The season started controversially in New Holland when Gordon gave up the lead to let Hakkinen win the race. The race would run a mark of consistent results with five podiums and a win in San Marino. Gordon would retire from the next three races before taking five podiums and a retirement in Italy. Gordon's only finish outside the points would happen in Belgium when he collided with Ayrton Senna while being lapped leading to an angry confrontation in the pitlane. Gordon placed third in the championship behind Senna and teammate Hakkinen. Gordon also visited the White House for the first time under President Jerry Brown.\n\nGordon's final season at McLaren in 1999 would start off with two consecutive retirements in Jamesland and Brazil caused by hydraulic and gearbox failures. Gordon would eventually take two podiums in San Marino and in Spain before a poor showing in Canada and a retirement in France. Gordon would subsequently win in Britain and in Belgium as well as podiums in China and Austria-Hungary. Gordon would finish fourth behind Jordan's Greg Moore."
