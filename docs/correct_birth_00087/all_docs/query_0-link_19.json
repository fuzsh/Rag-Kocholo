        "text": "Gordon’s racing career comes full circle\n\nVALLEJO – Jeff Gordon’s racing career came full circle last week as the NASCAR legend returned to his racing roots in Northern California for a memorable “homecoming tour” prior to this weekend’s Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway.\n\nGordon took advantage of a rare off weekend on the 36-stop NASCAR schedule to take a walk down memory lane with his wife, Ingrid, and children, Ella and Leo. The visit included a stop at the middle school he attended in Vallejo.\n\nThe Vallejo native and four-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will step away from full-time driving after the 2015 season, bringing a close to his remarkable 23-year NASCAR career. Gordon will take his final green flag Sunday at Sonoma Raceway as a full-time Sprint Cup Series driver.\n\nThe Gordon family paid a visit to the former Springstowne Middle School (now Vallejo Charter School) in Vallejo, which he attended. Gordon was born in Vallejo and lived in Northern California until he was 14 years old.\n\nGordon was welcomed by nearly 200 students and their families for a question-and-answer session in the quad of the middle school. Gordon talked with the students about growing up in Vallejo, as well as his racing career and family.\n\n“It was awesome to see Jeff Gordon. He’s won a lot of races and it’s so cool that he’s from Vallejo,” said Anthony Fernandez, 8, who attends Dan Mini Elementary School\n\n“Just walking through the halls and around this campus brings back a lot of memories and a lot of friends that I haven’t seen in a long time. In fact, I remember break dancing in one of these halls,” said Gordon about his visit to the middle school. “It’s been phenomenal.”\n\nGordon is looking to add a sixth win in Sonoma and 93rd win of his career. He is the undisputed king of the wine country road course with five victories (1998-2000, ‘04, ‘06), five pole positions (1998-99, ‘01, ‘04, ‘05) and 17 top-10 finishes — all the most of any NASCAR driver in Sonoma. He also holds the record for most laps completed (2,227 of 2,551 laps) and the most races led at 12.\n\nWatsonville Ocean Speedway points as of June 20:\n\nAmerican Stocks: Robert Gallaher of San Jose, 565.
