        "text": "Jeff Gordon celebrity doll depicts him as a professional NASCAR driver at 25 years old. The 12 inch figure was made by Hasbro in 1997 in their Starting LineUp Winner’s Circle collection.\n\nHis stock car racing career includes 93 Cup wins and he is considered one of the top 5 drivers. After retirement he moved on to a Fox Sports broadcasting career and sports executive for Hendricks Motorsports. Another 50th Anniversary Starting Lineup version of Jeff Gordon was made in 1998 with a different face sculpt, clothing, and box. It has a solid blue Dupont helmet with a clear shield.\n\nFrom the inside box flap:\n\nJEFF GORDON\n\nIn 1997, twenty-five year old Jeff Gordon became the youngest person ever to win the Daytona 500. That’s just one of the many great successes for the driver of the No. 24 Chevrolet owned by Hendrick Motorsports and sponsored by DuPont Automotive Finishes.\n\nGordon was born in Vallejo, California on August 4, 1971, and was in the driver’s seat by the age of five, when he began racing go-karts and quarter-midgets. In 1990, he was named U.S. Auto Club Midget division champion. The next year he racked up tow more titles–U.S. Auto Club SiIver Crown champion and NASCAR Grand National rookie of the year. In 1992, he won eleven poles in the NASCAR Grand National series and finished fourth in final point standings. He won the MAXX Rookie of the Year title in 1993, running thirty races and making the top-five spot seven times. Two years later, at the age of 24, Jeff Gordon became the second-youngest driver in history to win the NASCAR championship. In 1996, Gordon continues his meteoric rise to fame, winning more races and poles, leading more miles and laps, and winning more money in the regular season than any other driver on the circuit.\n\nCelebrate Jeff Gordon’s outstanding achievements with this fully poseable, 12″ figure complete with racing helmet. This exclusive figure is sure to become a classic collectible!\n\nThe Gordon NASCAR doll comes wearing a one piece, heavily branded, rainbow design, racing jumpsuit. The suit is completely removable with Velcro opening up the front and a one snap belt closure. The doll comes with Simpson branded, red ankle racing boots and a matching rainbow helmet with a smoke plastic shield that flips up and down.\n\nThe action figure is articulated at the wrist, elbow, shoulders, neck, waist, hips knees, and ankles. Head tilts and turns as does the waist. The doll can be fairly easily be balanced in poses to stand on it’s own."
