        "text": "When sprint car driver Jeff Gordon burst onto the scene in the early 1990s, many NASCAR fans and drivers had little patience for the California native with the skills and ambition to turn the “Good Old Boys” series on its ear.\n\nAfter all, NASCAR had deep Southern roots and drivers that starred on the circuit. Richard Petty was ending his legendary seven-series-championship career and the “Intimidator” Dale Earnhardt was in the midst of his seven-championship run, which ended with his 1994 crown.\n\nThen a 5-foot-8, 150-pound kid from the Midwest sprint-car circuit – Gordon was born in Vallejo but raised in Indiana – joined the fray and NASCAR was never the same.\n\nGordon’s emergence in the early 1990s moved the sport from a somewhat niche following among Southern race fans into one of the top five sports in America.\n\n“He wasn’t just a game-changer, he was a sport changer,” said longtime NASCAR writer Jerry Bonkowski of NBCSports.com. “Gordon, and the late Dale Earnhardt, virtually single-handedly transformed a very provincial, primarily Southeast-based sport and led NASCAR to unprecedented national growth and success through the 1990s and into the 2000s.”\n\nToday, NASCAR generates more than $3 billion in revenue with 36 races and has tens of millions of race fans.\n\nAlthough his immediate impact on the sport also made him hated by many in the series, race fans have Gordon to thank for much of that growth.\n\nEarnhardt, who began his NASCAR career in 1975, hit his stride with his first NASCAR Winston Cup Championship in 1980. Then in 1986, Earnhardt started his six-championship run, winning 48 races during the nine-year stretch that also saw championships in 1987, ’90, ’91, ’93 and ’94. Earnhardt raced another seven years before he was killed on the last lap of the 2001 Daytona 500. He won 76 races and seven championships over a 27-year career.\n\nGordon began his NASCAR Sprint Cup career in 1992.\n\nBy 1995, he won seven races and got his first NASCAR championship. During the next five seasons, Gordon won 49 races and three more titles. Gordon has won 92 races and four NASCAR Sprint Cup Championships in his 24-year career, which will end, at last a full-time competitor, at the end of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series this fall.\n\nAnd, both Earnhardt and Gordon were instrumental in the series’ growth and bigger prize purses.\n\nEarnhardt made slightly more than $42 million in his 27-year career. Gordon has won more than $147 million nearing the end of his 24-year run. And, Jimmie Johnson, who is arguably the most successful driver in the new millennium, has pocketed nearly $143 million in just 15 years.\n\nGordon has always had a warm fan welcome in Southern California. He was the winner of the first NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Auto Club Speedway (then called California Speedway) in 1997, and has won three times in Fontana.\n\nThis weekend, Southern California race fans will have one more chance to see Gordon turn laps and maybe race to his fourth victory at Auto Club Speedway.\n\nBonkowski talked of another budding NASCAR superstar from California – Kyle Larson – who put it best last year when he said he and so many other young drivers grew up wanting to be just like Gordon.\n\n“Sure, Gordon has had some dustups with other drivers like Brad Keselowski last year, and Matt Kenseth a few years back,” Bonkowski said, “but NASCAR couldn’t have had a more perfect ambassador for the sport and example for not only kids, but fellow drivers.”\n\nStill, no other driver has had fans that love to hate him more than Gordon.\n\n“Back in the 1990s, if you were a fan of the late Dale Earnhardt, you absolutely hated Gordon,” Bonkowski said. “There was no middle ground.\n\n“But as their rivalry grew, a great mutual respect developed between Gordon and ‘The Intimidator,’ and that eventually was passed down to the fans.”\n\nGordon has promoted NASCAR all over the Inland area and Southern California. He’s cooked and chatted with Wolfgang Puck, done burnouts at Staples Center in Los Angeles and read books to children at Inland area schools.\n\nAfter his first win in Fontana, which marked NASCAR’s return to the region after nine years – Riverside International Raceway had closed in 1988 – Gordon spoke about his love of the track and the fans.\n\n“Jeff is a driver that has always been up on the wheel and given us 100 percent,” said Dave Allen, Auto Club Speedway president. “He has been a joy to watch and a great friend to Auto Club Speedway and Southern California race fans.”\n\nToday, just the sight of Gordon in the garage area will get a large contingency of fans seeking selfies or autographs.\n\n“Gordon was the epitome of class,” Bonkowski said. “He’s an excellent role model, and showed fellow drivers and fans why it’s so important to give back with his heavy involvement in humanitarian and charitable endeavors.”\n\nSo, as Gordon makes his way toward the sunset of his career, he can rest comfortably knowing he did things his way and had a ton of success.\n\n“The best part … is that Gordon is going out on his terms,” Bonkowski said. “It’s a very enviable position, as so few people get a chance to do that.\n\n“He’ll be missed, but we’re all a little richer for having known or cheered for him – and yes, even the Gordon haters. Who will they hate now?”"
