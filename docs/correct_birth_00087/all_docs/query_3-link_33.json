        "text": "Each week, The Athletic asks the same 12 questions to a different race car driver. Up next: Jeff Gordon, the four-time NASCAR Cup Series champion and Hall of Famer who is now vice chairman at Hendrick Motorsports.\n\n1. What is currently the No. 1 thing on your bucket list?\n\nMaybe the Kentucky Derby. That one’s always been on my list. I would also say Monaco. Both of those races always seem to conflict with our racing schedule and NASCAR schedule. So I don’t know if I’ll get to it anytime soon.\n\nYeah, it’s hard to get to Monaco when you have both the Indy 500 and Coke 600 now.\n\nYeah, I checked with Zak Brown (of McLaren) and was like, “Can it happen? Can you do all three in one day?” And it’s impossible.\n\n2. How much media coverage of NASCAR do you consume?\n\nA lot more now than I probably did before. Just because with my role, I’m tapped into our content team and our marketing team and our sponsors and even our drivers and our branding at Hendrick Motorsports. My drive every morning is about 30 minutes from my house to the shop. And so it’s SiriusXM Radio pretty much on that drive in and drive home.\n\nAnd then I do what most of us do, where I can’t help myself just scrolling through Instagram and YouTube and all those. Not much TikTok, although my daughter (Ella, now 16) got me into TikTok. So a little bit of that, too.\n\n3. Beyond winning, what is the best way to measure success in racing?\n\nOne of the big things is progression. Show me you’re learning and applying it and getting better and improving and progressing through your career. That’s success, because if you do that, you’re probably going to end up somewhere where it’s going to be rewarded and where you can showcase your talent and your hard work you’ve put in. If somebody throughout their career never stops progressing, they’ve had a successful career.\n\n4. What is an opinion you have about NASCAR that you don’t think is shared by the fans?\n\nConspiracy theories. (Laughs.) Listen, fans are loyal. They’re loyal to their brand, they’re loyal to an OEM (manufacturer), they’re loyal to a driver or team. And so I think when things don’t go their way, then a lot of them start saying, “Oh, must be that NASCAR needed this for this reason.” And I’ve never seen that to be true. Not from where I sit.\n\nAnd then the more you try to explain it to people, the more they just don’t believe you.\n\nOh no, they won’t believe you. I didn’t say it’s a debate. (Laughs.)\n\n5. What is the biggest thing fans don’t realize about what you do for a living?\n\nComing into an office about every day of the week. I’ve gone from being behind the wheel for many years to being up in the broadcast booth to answering lots of emails and taking lots of calls and being in lots of meetings. I’m super invested in a company that luckily I’ve been part of for 30-plus years. I’ve seen how it’s grown. I’ve seen the investment Rick (Hendrick) has made and been a part of that. So I love this company, and I love seeing it be successful, and I love the fact I get to play some role in that.\n\n6. I’m doing a couple of wild-card-type questions here. I went back to our 2010 12 Questions interview and at the time, I’d asked you how long you wanted to continue driving. As it turns out, you said, “I feel like I have five more years.” (He retired after the 2015 season.) But here’s what I still don’t understand: Aside from maybe desire or motivation, what would physically prevent you from getting in the car at age 52 and being successful? Is your eyesight not as good? Your hand-eye coordination? Why couldn’t you if you wanted to?\n\nSo I did this Porsche Carrera Cup race a couple years ago (at Indianapolis Motor Speedway) and that was about as good of a measuring stick for exactly what you’re talking about as possible. I’d been out of the car for several years and you’re never as sharp as the guys who are doing it every week. I just heard Kevin Harvick talk about this (when he filled in for Kyle Larson during All-Star Race practice at North Wilkesboro). He’s only been out of the car for six months and he’s saying, “You can’t just jump in here and compete with these guys.”\n\nSo first, it’s out of respect for the people who do it well and work so hard at it and are tied into their team and tied into the vehicle on a weekly basis. It’s so hard to compete with that — I don’t care how talented you are.\n\nAnd then the other thing I experienced in that race was just the physicality of it. I was exhausted. I realized how good of shape I was in driving race cars. I mean, of course, I look at myself in the mirror and I see I’ve gained weight. I don’t look the same way. But I still felt like, “I’m still strong. My heart is good, and my lungs. I can exercise and all those things, and I can handle it.” But I got in that race car, and I was just wiped out.\n\nIt’s just forgetting how much that car puts your body through. Maybe I took that for granted a little bit just because I raced my whole life and raced every weekend, so I felt like I was in good shape. But I didn’t realize how good of shape.\n\nYes, the eyesight goes. Your depth perception goes a little bit. But your desire to put the car on the absolute edge changes as well. You know, a lot of people would say, “Oh, when you have kids, you have a family now, that must be in the back of your mind.” That was never in the back of my mind. When I was driving race cars, I got in there and I flipped the switch and the switch was on. There was nothing else other than driving this car to the best of my ability and putting it out there as far as I needed to.\n\nBut after you step out of it, honestly, I went up into the booth with Fox and I watched and I said, “Those guys are crazy! There’s no way I used to do that.” Now I could push myself to a pace that I’m comfortable with, and that pace would not be good enough to put the car at the speed it needs to be.\n\n7. I went back to our 2014 12 Questions interview. I’d asked you: “Fans often come up to you and want to discuss a moment or race from your career. Which one comes up the most?” Ten years later and now that you’re retired, what do they want to bring up from your career?\n\nI had someone say, “You were a huge part of my childhood. Watching you every week changed my life.” And it’s hard for me to grasp that. But to hear somebody say that certainly is humbling, and it makes you really proud you had an impact on somebody’s life like that. So that was really cool.\n\nI saw another guy had a 24 tattoo on his shoulder. You have to understand: I don’t like needles at all. So for somebody to actually go through that kind of pain to put that on their body, I have the utmost respect.\n\n8. What do you like about the place that you grew up? You grew up in a couple of different places, so I don’t know which one you want to go with.\n\nWell, if I go back to California (Vallejo), it taught me a lot of life lessons, like how to be tough. Growing up in a public school that was very diverse and very challenging. I wasn’t an athlete, and I wasn’t an academic. Luckily, I was a race car driver, because I would have been very lost in that system. But I was also scrappy. I had to hold my own because I was a little guy. So it taught me how to do that.\n\nIt also made me appreciate when I moved to Indiana — that school system and the friends I made and being able to do what I love, which was racing. California was holding me back from that because I was so young. All I kept hearing is, “You can’t,” and “You’re not allowed to,” and “The laws or the rules don’t allow you to.” So I was happy to get out of California for that reason and come to Indiana and it was like, “I can go race and drive anywhere basically I want to.”\n\nAnd I got to go through high school right down the road from Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the place I dreamed about racing my whole life, and then eventually got to race there with NASCAR. But those days in California, growing up in Vallejo, really taught me about what you have to do to apply yourself and break out to get somewhere in life and also how to be tough.\n\n9. What personality trait are you the most proud of?\n\nMy kindness? But my wife might not always agree with that after being married 18 years. (Laughs.) I always wanted to be balanced. I wanted to be happy, but not too happy; be angry, but not too angry if it required that. It was staying well-balanced just like I love race cars — I love a well-balanced race car, and that’s what makes it go faster. That’s what makes me who I am. I have good days and bad days, but I never have really, really bad days, and I don’t think I ever have really, really good days. I’m just solid, happy and very appreciative. Humble. Sometimes I’m arrogant, too. (Laughs.)\n\n10. Which driver would you least like to be stuck with on an elevator?\n\nProbably Robby Gordon. Robby and I get along fine now, but of any driver, he has probably gotten under my skin the most. Even more than (Brad) Keselowski. Just go back and watch New Hampshire whatever year that was (2001). We won the championship and 9/11 happened and then we went back late (in November). I’m pretty sure it was that race. I’ve never been that angry. (Laughs.)\n\n11. What is a run-in you’ve had with a driver that TV or the media missed?\n\nMike Bliss.\n\nOh! The one at the airport, if I heard right?\n\nYeah. We were both struggling at Chicago (in 2005), running 20-something. It was not a good day; at least it certainly wasn’t for me. I was pretty unhappy with what we had out there on the racetrack that day, just struggling and trying to get to the finish and go home.\n\nI remember with a few laps to go, we went into Turn 1 and I was side-by-side with somebody and (Bliss) took me three-wide going into (Turn 1) for 20-whatever (place) and crashed all of us. To me, that was just absolutely absurd. Why would you do something like that for that position? Was it really that important?\n\nSo we were going to the airport and I was with Brian Vickers and I said, “Man, if I see Mike Bliss, I swear I’m gonna punch him.” And we get to the airport and he’s like the first guy I see. Going back to the question (about personality traits), I am a man of my word — like to a fault. If I say I’m going to do something — to a fan, to a colleague, to a sponsor, whatever it is — if I say I’m gonna do it, I’m gonna do it. And I said I was gonna do it, and I ended up doing it.\n\nSo if Vickers wasn’t in the car and you’re just by yourself and you hadn’t said it out loud, you might not have?\n\nExactly. Maybe not. Not one of my proudest moments, but I was angry. And I did not cool down by the time I got to the airport. (Note: Bliss showed up at the racetrack the next week with a black eye, sparking unconfirmed rumors of an altercation with Gordon.)\n\n12. Each week, I ask a driver to give me a question for the next person. Mario Andretti was the last one. He says: “How are you coping with your career after coming out of the cockpit? Is it as satisfying as driving? I doubt it. So how do you view that satisfaction for your future?”\n\nI don’t know if anything will be as satisfying as the birth of your children and winning major events or a championship. So satisfying. But I will say: I’m far more satisfied in what I’m doing now at this point in my life than I thought I would be. I thought I would really miss racing and I wouldn’t find something I was passionate about or interested in.\n\nWhen I do something, I want to put a lot of effort into it, and I want to be good at it. So I was like, “What could that possibly be?” Now this job is a little more challenging than I even anticipated. To be good at it takes a lot of work and a lot of time because it’s so vast. So many areas of the business you’re touching.\n\nBut I’m enjoying it. It’s awesome. I get to work and be close to my mentor Rick Hendrick and learn from him. He’s not only a great person, but he’s just a brilliant businessperson, too. So to partner with him, I feel like I couldn’t be in a better post-driving position than I am now.\n\nDo you have a question I can ask the next person?\n\nI could just say, “Car or driver?” and just lay that one out there. What’s the percentage of which one is more important?\n\n(Top photo of Jeff Gordon at the Indianapolis 500: Darron Cummings / AP)"
