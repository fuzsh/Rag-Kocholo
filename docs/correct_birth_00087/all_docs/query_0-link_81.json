        "text": "PITTSBORO, Ind. — Twenty-one years ago, a large crowd lined the streets of this small Hendricks County town west of Brownsburg hoping for a glimpse of the hometown hero.\n\nJeff Gordon didn't come that night after winning NASCAR's inaugural Brickyard 400 — he was eating pizza at the old Speedway Motel — but he was paraded through the streets Thursday.\n\nHis parents had a different view of the two events. In 1994, John Bickford had to tell the festive Pittsboro gathering his stepson was too busy celebrating at Indianapolis Motor Speedway to come out. Thursday, Bickford and his wife, Carol, watched Gordon roll by in a convertible with Main Street lined with adoring fans.\n\n\"I got to wave at my son in a parade,\" Carol said. \"I love that.\"\n\nSeems everyone among the thousand or so lining the 10-block route enjoyed it. An appearance by Gordon in this community is rare; the family moved to North Carolina in the early 1990s. Gordon noted the Dollar General being new, but mostly it's the same place he remembered from his high school days at Tri-West.\n\n\"Not a lot has changed,\" he said. \"I like it that way.\"\n\nGordon and his family, including sister Kim, moved to area farmland from the San Francisco suburb of Vallejo, Calif., in the summer of 1986, living in a ranch home that had a backyard workshop for Gordon's sprint cars.\n\nThe change of scenery for the Gordon's opportunity to race at a younger age was dramatic.\n\n\"We slept on two cots next to the air conditioning vents because we weren't used to the heat or humidity,\" Bickford said. \"Carol got us a washer, dryer and a refrigerator and she showed up in December and made sure we had beds and she redid the kitchen.\n\n\"It's a funny story how we lived for a while.\"\n\nGordon quickly became the source of community pride by winning races important enough to be written about in the newspaper.\n\n\"In California no one knew what I did,\" he said. \"Here, most people did, including teachers.\"\n\nGordon, who is retiring from Sprint Cup Series racing at year's end, didn't say with 100 percent certainty that Sunday will be his last IMS race, but everything points to that being the case. So, he plans to enjoy it.\n\nThursday was a good start to the weekend. Gordon rode in the parade with a pair of longtime friends, and he seemed to recognize people standing on either side of the street.\n\nOn a stage in the park, Gordon received Indiana's highest honor, the Sagamore of the Wabash, from Gov. Mike Pence, and Tri-West presented him with a plaque replicating his high school diploma. A joke was made that his academic transcript and the number of school days missed for racing weren't included.\n\nAfter seeing two helicopters flying above, Gordon described the event as \"one of the best days of my life, and I say that sincerely.\"\n\nLater, a nostalgic Gordon talked about many of \"the silly things you do living in the country,\" including driving to school in the snow and playing basketball in a barn loft.\n\n\"Called it barn ball,\" he said. \"Be up in the top level of a barn with hay and stuff stacked. (There was) a little basket and you had to shoot over rafters. It was so much fun.\n\n\"It seems like it's been a blur (since then). You go to a race track trying to win that (first Brickyard 400 in 1994) and the next thing you know you've won four (Sprint Cup) championships and they're naming a day after you in a parade.\"\n\nAs for Sunday's final Brickyard race, Gordon said he will be extra motivated due to the sendoff Pittsboro gave him.\n\n\"When you hear that many people cheering for you, that's the thing that kind of gets you in here (pointing to his chest),\" he said. \"You go wow, and you start to feel the impact of what you've accomplished and this is the last time you get to experience it.\""
