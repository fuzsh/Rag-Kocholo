        "text": "With newly hired crew chief, Robbie Loomis, who came from the Petty organization, and a almost completely new pit crew, Jeff Gordon started the 2000 season with optimism and high hopes, but the team wouldn't start the 2000 season like it had hoped, they had poor finishes at Daytona, Las Vegas, and Texas. The team also struggled at tracks. were they had in the past dominated, Darlington, Pocono, and Martinsville.\n\nIn 2000 we saw Jeff Gordon add another highlight to his career, he won his fiftieth career race!!! The win came at Talladega, and with this win, we also saw the Dupont team slowly coming together.\n\nThe team picked up it's second victory on the road course, at Sears Point, and with this win, Jeff Gordon set a Winston Cup record for consecutive road course wins, with six!!! The win was also a big lift in moral and confidence for the team, but it was short lived, because the team followed the win with a four race stretch, in which Jeff Gordon failed to produce not one top 20 finish.\n\nThe month of September brought the team renewed enthusiasm, they got their third win at Richmond, and Jeff Gordon followed that win, with 10 top 10's in the last eleven races of the 2000 season.\n\nWith the strong finish the team showed in the last part of the 2000 season, could the rebuilding be over? Will we see Jeff Gordon in 2001 making a strong run for his fourth Winston Cup Championship title?"
