        "text": "Four-time NASCAR Cup Series champion. Three-time Daytona 500 winner. Five-time Brickyard 400 winner. And the list goes on. Jeff Gordon has combined determination, hard work and decades of experience to achieve an unparalleled roster of victories. His fans expect only the best from him, and they have been rewarded at every turn throughout the course of Gordon’s career.\n\nJeff was five years old when he began running laps at a makeshift racetrack in Vallejo, California, that he and his stepfather John Bickford converted from a fairground. Inspired at an early age by John to be the best he could be in everything he did, Jeff embraced racing with a natural talent and true humility.\n\nThe young man from California jumped behind the wheel of a quarter midget and his competitive spirit quickly ignited. “He slipped around the track for days getting used to the car and how to drive it,” John says. Jeff didn’t do so well in his first year of competition, but he knew he could do it. At just six years of age, Jeff won 35 main events and set five track records. And so it began…\n\nJeff later took interest in sprint cars because of their size and power. There was one roadblock though – Jeff was only 13 years old and the rules stated the minimum age to drive the 650 horsepower machines was 16. But, Jeff and his family appealed to the insurance companies and their persistence paid off when Jeff was allowed to run in the All Star Florida Speedweeks. He was successful driving sprint cars and the family moved to Pittsboro, Indiana so Jeff could settle in and learn in the heart of sprint car country. Racing sprint cars was the first time Jeff had received national attention, partly due to his young age and partly because of his amazing driving abilities. Success came easily as Jeff captured several track championships at Bloomington Speedway and a title at Eldora Speedway.\n\nWhen there were no opportunities available in open-wheel racing for Jeff to pursue, someone suggested that he try out the Buck Baker Driving School at Rockingham Speedway in North Carolina. When Jeff drove his first laps in a stock car, he declared to his parents that this was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. What exciting times those were. It was a transition from the traditional open-wheel racing that Jeff was used to, to something he had never done before – race a car that had fenders.\n\nJeff met a man named Hugh Connerty, who owned some Hooters restaurants and was a partner in Outback Steakhouse. Hugh secured some funding for a car through Outback, and it went to a test for the Busch Grand National race in Charlotte in 1990. A then unknown figure in the motorsports community from New Jersey by the name of Ray Evernham was asked to come work with Jeff. They ran a few races together to end the 1990 Busch Grand National season.\n\nIn 1991, Jeff Gordon and Hugh Connerty amicably parted ways when funding became difficult to secure. After tire testing the No. 1 car for Bill Davis, conversations started between Jeff and Bill and the two entered into a one page agreement for Jeff to drive for the 1991 season. Jeff won Rookie of the Year honors driving the Carolina Ford Dealers car that year. Nestle Chocolate, with their Baby Ruth brand, sponsored the car for the 1992 season, and Davis hired Ray Evernham at Daytona that year.\n\n1992 marked the first time the Busch cars ran at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Jeff sat on the pole and also won the race, turning many heads in the process. One person who took immediate notice was Rick Hendrick. The rest is history. Jeff became a part of the Hendrick Motorsports family where he continued the winning tradition.\n\nHis desire to drive was fueled by gritty determination to win races and championships, which remained throughout an unparalleled career in racing.\n\nAfter completing his final season as a NASCAR Cup Series driver in 2015 where he finished third in the standings, Gordon joined the FOX Sports team as a broadcast analyst for their NASCAR Cup Series coverage.\n\nGordon is President of Jeff Gordon, Inc. and its related business entities, and a partner at Hendrick Motorsports.\n\nIn 1999, Gordon founded the Jeff Gordon Children’s Foundation, dedicated to supporting pediatric cancer research aimed at finding more effective, less toxic cures for children.\n\nBIRTHDATE: Aug 4, 1971\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Vallejo, CA\n\nHOMETOWN: Pittsboro, IN\n\nHEIGHT: 5’7″\n\nSTATUS: Married to Ingrid Vandebosch\n\nCHILDREN: Ella Sofia, Leo Benjamin\n\nFour-time NASCAR Cup Series Champion (1995, 1997, 1998, 2001)\n\n93 Career NASCAR Cup Victories\n\nThird on All-Time NASCAR Cup Wins List\n\n81 Career Poles\n\nThird on All-Time NASCAR Cup Pole Award Wins List\n\nThree-Time Daytona 500 Winner (1997, 1999, 2005)\n\nFive-Time Brickyard 400 Winner (1994, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2014)\n\nThree-Time All-Star Race Winner (1995, 1997, 2001)\n\nNine-Time NASCAR Cup Road Course Winner – Record Holder\n\nTwelve-Time NASCAR Cup Restrictor Plate Winner – Record Holder"
