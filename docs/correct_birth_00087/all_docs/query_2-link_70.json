        "text": "Jeff Gordon won’t have to miss a race for the birth of his daughter.\n\nNASCAR’s four-time champion became a father Wednesday morning when his wife, model Ingrid Vandebosch, gave birth to a girl. Gordon announced on his website that Ella Sofia Gordon was born in New York.\n\nThat’s great news for the Gordon family and not-so-great news for his competitors, who will now have to deal with the man who has won a record five races at Infineon Raceway, including the one last summer.\n\n“It’s been an absolutely incredible experience,” Gordon said. “Ingrid came through amazingly and we’re both really happy and overjoyed. We can’t wait to get home and start our lives together as a family.”\n\nGordon had asked Mark Martin to be on standby this weekend in case he had to leave the race in Sonoma, Calif., to return for the birth.\n\nGordon said he’ll travel to California this week and participate in all on-track activities at Infineon Raceway.\n\nGordon’s baby was born two days after Tiger Woods’ daughter, Sam Alexis.\n\nGordon leads this season’s Nextel championship by 264 points and has won nearly $3.5 million."
