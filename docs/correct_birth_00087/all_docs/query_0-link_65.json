Gordon, who was born in Vallejo and lived in California until he was 13, is third on the all-time victory list at NASCAR's highest level with 93. The West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame will hold its inductions on Thursday, June 20, 2019 to kick of the NASCAR weekend at Sonoma Raceway. Gordon's stepfather, John Bickord, was inducted in 2016 and now serves on the board of directors for the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame. Gordon isn't the only marquee driver on a list that includes four-time Indianapolis 500 winner Rick Mears, Tom Sneva, Tommy Kendall, and George Follmer, among others.\n\n2019 Hall of Fame: Jeff Gordon became the youngest person ever elected to the NASCAR Hall of Fame as he'll be inducted during a ceremony in Charlotte, N.C. in January 2019. Gordon was named on 96% of the voting ballots for the Hall of Fame. The other members of the Class of 2019 are Jack Roush, Roger Penske, Davey Allison, and Alan Kulwicki. In sharing his thoughts and emotions after it was announced he was one of five selectees, Gordon agreed that once again, timing was everything. \"I've always said timing has been on my side throughout my career,\" Gordon said. \"The timing couldn't be better to be in the Hall.\"\n\nFollow @JGinfo on Twitter\n\nFight On Against Pediatric Cancer"
