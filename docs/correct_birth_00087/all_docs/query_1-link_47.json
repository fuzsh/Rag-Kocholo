        "text": "Next up in PTR’s Career Statistics article series for retired NASCAR drivers is Jeff Gordon. The four-time Winston Cup winner ended his long career at Martinsville in 2016 – with a position six finish in the #88 car (substituting for Dale Jr.). He started racing with Go-Carts and Sprints Cars and then worked his way up to NASCAR Busch Series (1990) and then to Winston Cup Series (1992). Jeff Gordon is the youngest driver in Winston Cup history to achieve 50 careers wins. Jeff Gordons first race at Atlanta 1992 also marked the end of NASCAR legend “the King” Richard Petty. In 1995, Jeff won his first championship in Winston Cup, beating Dale Earnhardt with 34 points. He also got 7 wins, 17 top-5, 23 top-10 and 8 poles that season. Gordon is ranked third among the all-time NASCAR Cup Series winners with 93 victories. He holds the record for most wins at the Southern 500 (Darlington) with 6 wins and the Brickyard 400 (Indianpolis) with 5 wins.
