        "text": "JEFF GORDON is a world series nascar racer. he was born in august/4/1971.\n\nBIO\n\nJeff has been Four-time NASCAR Cup Series champion, Three-time Daytona 500 winner, Four-time Brickyard 400 winner And the list goes on. Jeff Gordon has combined determination, hard work and decades of experience to achieve an unparalleled roster of victories. His fans expect only the best from him, and they are rewarded at every turn with Gordon’s racing agility that defines the skill of the sport.\n\nJeff was five when he began running laps at a makeshift racetrack that he and his stepfather, John Bickford, made from a fair ground hometown of Vallejo, California. Inspired at an early age by John to be the best he could be in everything he did, Jeff embraced racing with a natural talent and true humility.\n\nChampionships won\n\nLike i said before he won a 4 time Nascar Cup Series champion He also won multiple trophies at distinguished races such as the Daytona 500, Brickyard 400, Coca Cola 600 and the Southern 500.\n\nRight now he is racing in the sprint cup series."
