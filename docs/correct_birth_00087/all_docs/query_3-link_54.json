        "text": "When asked what he likes most about being a lawyer, Jeff Gordon answered, “Continuing to learn because industries evolve. There is always something to identify, learn, and master, and that preparation allows me to provide the best service I can.” Jeff has always wanted to be a trial lawyer and is driven to work with and fight tirelessly for his clients.\n\nJeff’s practice at RSHC focuses primarily on product liability and mass tort litigation as well as commercial litigation and insurance litigation. His legal experience is amplified by a rewarding clerkship and two judicial externships which enabled him to work alongside 12 superior court justices, an appellate court judge, and a circuit court judge assisting them in all phases of criminal and civil litigation. Jeff loves the law and litigation—brief writing, advocating in court, taking and defending depositions, and conducting research. His hard work, creative solutions, and thorough approaches are effective and straightforward: know your audience—not one size fits all, take more time to build a foundation, communicate and be persuasive to make a subject more relatable, don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, and when an argument is won, stop talking—less is more.\n\nHaving lived on both coasts and in the Midwest, Jeff has an appreciation for both big city and smaller historic community life. Jeff is a basketball enthusiast and loves the game. He enjoys hiking, cooking, and traveling the world."
