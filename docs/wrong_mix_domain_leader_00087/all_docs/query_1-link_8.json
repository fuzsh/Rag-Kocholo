        "text": "Europe is at a moment of political transition. This week, voters in France and the UK will head to the polls in elections set to fundamentally alter the direction of both countries. Meanwhile, Brussels is focused both on top jobs and political priorities for the new European Commission and European Parliament, following last month's EU elections. To discuss what all these elections mean for the future Europe, Rasmussen Global was delighted to welcome Sophie in 't Veld, Arnaud DANJEAN, and Kira Marie P. at our offices this morning. The three MEPs joined leading figures from business, civil society and the diplomatic community for the second Rasmussen Global Geopolitical Breakfast. The event brings together leading figures from Brussels and beyond to discuss the big issues in an informal setting. If you are interested in learning more about our Geopolitical Breakfasts and Rasmussen Global's work on EU policy issues, don't hesitate to contact Senior Director, European Affairs Arthur de Liedekerke.\n\nRasmussen Global snap reaction to EU elections: 𝗣𝗿𝗼-𝗘𝘂𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗱𝘀 – 𝗩𝗗𝗟 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘁𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁 The main takeaway from the 2024 European election is that the pro-European coalition that supported European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen still has a solid majority. The centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), centre-left Socialists & Democrats Party (S&D), and Liberal Renew Party retain a majority of 39 seats . 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗻𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗲-𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗘𝘂𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲'𝘀 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘆 (𝗘𝗣𝗣), 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁 𝗻𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗲𝗳𝘁. It was a good night for the centre-right EPP Group, who exceeded pre-election polls, finishing with 186 seats. This was driven by wins in large member states – Germany, Poland, and Spain. The centre-left S&D Group remained steady with 135 seats, a slight decrease from the last Parliament. The centrist Renew Group had a bad election going from 102 to 79 seats. This was driven by a huge drop in support for President Macron’s Liberal Party in France, as well as losing all seats in Spain. The Greens also fared poorly, dropping behind before the Conservative ECR and extreme-right ID Group, to be the sixth largest in the Parliament with just 52 seats. 𝗙𝗮𝗿-𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗻 𝗯𝗶𝗴 𝗶𝗻 𝗙𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗔𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗮 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲. The biggest story of the night was the crushing victory by the extreme-right RN Party in France, which received more than double the number of votes as President Macron’s centrist grouping. The extreme-right also won in Austria and finished second in Germany and the Netherlands. However, the continent-wide surge by far-right parties predicted by media ahead of the elections did not materialize. The bloc will be a vocal minority in the next parliament but do not have the numbers to significantly derail decision making. 𝗠𝗮𝗷𝗼𝗿 𝘀𝗽𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗽𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗰𝘆 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗲𝗱𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗯𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲-𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲-𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁. Increased cooperation between the extreme-right ID Group and the conservative-right ECR Group is unlikely due to strong disagreements on foreign policy. The ECR Group is predominantly pro-Atlanticist and supportive of Ukraine, while many in the ID Group remain close to Russia. Parties skeptical of support for Ukraine fared well in France, Austria, and Germany. However, in Italy, support for the traditionally pro-Russia Lega collapsed from 34.3% in 2019 to just 9% in 2024. This support moved to Georgia Meloni’s conservative but pro-NATO, pro-Ukraine Fratteli D’Italia, who won 28% of the vote, up from 6.4% in 2019. This counters argument that increased support for right-wing parties across Europe is fueled partially by frustration with strong support for Ukraine.\n\nRasmussen Global is expanding in Brussels.

The report sets out a series of practical steps to that can help to contain the war and lay the foundations for a sustainable peace. It concludes that embedding Ukraine into NATO and the EU is the only effective way to ensure Ukraine's long-term sovereignty and independence. The Rasmussen Global team has been working closely with the Ukrainian President's Office since January, and coordinating a high-level working group including former Presidents, Prime Ministers, and Secretaries of State from NATO countries who endorsed the final report. This work was led by CEO Fabrice Pothier and Geopolitics Director Harry Nedelcu, with huge support from Policy Advisor Betzy Hänninen.
