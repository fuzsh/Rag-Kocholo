This year he will host COP15, the United Nations Climate Change Conference that will try to find a new agreement to replace the Kyoto protocol, and Rasmussen believes his country can show the rest of the world a greener future. In a far-reaching interview he also talks about immigration, Afghanistan and what he thinks of Obama."
