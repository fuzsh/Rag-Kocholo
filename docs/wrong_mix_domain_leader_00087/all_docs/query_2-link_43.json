        "text": "Elections and political change have meant a period busier than most for anyone working in EU affairs. Summer holidays will be very welcome this year! While campaigning for the European Parliament elections happens in every corner of the European Union, this was my first time experiencing the elections from Brussels. Changes to the European Parliament and the Commission have been a feature of most conversations and many events since the beginning of 2024. This “front row seat” has deepened my appreciation for the processes that drive our democratic European Union. Those processes can be complex, negotiations are intense, and compromises need to be found. Yet they are testament to democracy at work. For our part it was a privilege to be able to contribute through a program of activities that included our work to preserve election integrity and encourage people to vote, advocating for gender equality in politics and convening open discussions about the EU’s next five years. We see it as our role to support democracy and we will continue to do so throughout the EU. With batteries recharged over the break, I will return very optimistic for the next months. The impact of our recently announced large scale investments throughout Europe - including supporting companies to innovate and grow and helping people to learn digital skills – will take shape. Hopefully we can contribute to Europes competitiveness. Here in Brussels we look forward to working with the new European Parliament and European Commission for the next five years - helping to empower people across the Union. I wish you all a relaxing summer break!\n\nDeep in Germany’s manufacturing strongholds, rotating machines - like turbines and electric motors - are often in service for 10 to 20 years. They're the backbone of Europe's industrial force, powering everything from car factories to wind farms. Good maintenance and repair are essential but getting the timing right is not always easy. Bosch has developed a digital twin technology so that machines’ upcoming needs can be alerted on time. This digital twin system, operating on Microsoft Azure, makes sure that machines operate at peak efficiency. It also prevents unexpected breakdowns which means less stress for those managing the systems. We’re all for efficiency and reducing stress!

Our partnership seeks to help women politicians manage the harms of online technology such as disinformation - particularly gendered disinformation - and online gender-based violence. We also aim to help them manage their digital presence to effectively tackle these threats. This is critical for safeguarding democracy; today over 1 in 6 women politicians leave office during their first term. We have just kicked off a series of online workshops for the global WPL community. The first two sessions took a closer look at AI: how it can used to advance equality, create safe online spaces and, importantly, how to combat its misuse against women in politics. It was really informative to hear from those on political front lines across the world - Fatimazhra Belhirch, Fatoumatta Njai, Frances Fitzgerald, Mariam Lashkhi, Marilou McPhedran, and @neemalugangira - who shared their experiences and wisdom. My colleagues Marja Laitinen, Dave Leichtman and Seth Reznik updated the group on AI & election integrity, deepfakes, and AI & campaigning. In Brad Smith's message to participants, he recognized the acute challenge faced by women in politics, including the high rates of online psychological violence. He said we need to double down on efforts to address the weaponization of AI against women and, take meaningful steps to implement commitments such as the Tech accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI. I am looking forward to the next workshops later this year as we continue this important work together.\n\nThis caught my eye: A new AI powered hub that will help to speed up sustainable growth. Developed by Lone Kørnøv and her team at Aalborg Universitet the EA Hub is a database of environmental assessments of building projects since 2020. New construction and infrastructure projects will have a much faster route to environmental compliance - using the EA Hub cuts down the time required for these processes by 50-75%. Until now, knowledge from past assessments was scattered in different digital resources, making environmental planning lengthy and costly. Helpfully, the hub even shows how previous conflicts were resolved. This project, supported by Danmarks Miljøportal COWI and Ramboll is a great example of AI being put to practical use for the benefit of the environment and the economy - let’s count on such hubs becoming more widespread across Europe before long! https://lnkd.in/d3MN_jUc\n\nIf you know somebody with diabetes, you’ll be aware of the stress and relentlessness of managing insulin. Having a reliable stock is crucial. Denmark’s Novo Nordisk, the world's largest manufacturer of insulin, knows that its production lines must be utterly reliable: Updates to production formats and processes cannot be disruptive. Novo Nordisk is now using technology, including AI, to help their teams implement production changes and to troubleshoot. They no longer have to rely on a technician being on site and being immediately available. Working with Microsoft’s mixed reality technology means that technicians can be on-site “virtually” and give precise, intuitive instructions to anyone at any time, no matter how far away they are. More teams are being helped faster and Novo Nordisk can scale its global operations – an essential development. Especially now that WHO reports a sharper rise in diabetes in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nYesterday, a group of female leaders from government, the EU Institutions, business and think-tanks came together for lunch at The Nine to talk about issues related to the future of the Transatlantic Alliance in a year of elections. With opening remarks by WPL Ambassador Frances Fitzgerald and European Commission Vice-President Vera Jourová, we discussed what is driving voter sentiment, the threat of disinformation, technology solutions for the future and how women political leadership and partnership can play a positive role. We agreed that democracy itself is at stake, which is why we need to re-double multistakeholder efforts to protect and preserve it. We also need to preserve our shared values through the Transatlantic Alliance, and we discussed ways that European women leaders can partner with counterparts in the US where we think these values are threatened. The outcomes of the European Parliament elections, and the upcoming US elections, will have a significant impact on citizens’ lives, and on shaping responses to some of today’s most pressing challenges. I am proud of our partnership with Women Political Leaders (WPL) and how we are working together on issues related to safeguarding democracy, and strengthening female leadership, in the age of AI.\n\nHow can we use technologies to power Europe's competitiveness? That was the question that fueled yesterday's lively discussion organized by European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE) hosted at our office. The panel speakers – European Commission’s Thibaut Kleiner and Eline Chivot ECIPE’s Fredrik Erixon Business Europe’s Svetlana Stoilova and my colleague Tjade Stroband drew out some excellent points: • Cloud computing is a driver of major paradigm shifts in Europe’s competitiveness. • Bridging the gap between companies that embrace technology and those that have yet to start is crucial for Europe’s competitiveness across all sectors. • Bringing AI on board can ramp up productivity and reduce the burden of administration. Everything from healthcare to manufacturing can become better, faster, and more efficient. Thanks to ECIPE for their work in keeping this crucial area top-of-mind for the new political cycle and to our speakers for their valuable input."
