Two more people and two entities have been blamed to give practical support to the Syrian regime. As a result of that, they have been subjected to travel ban and asset freeze. Consequently, the number of those under EU sanctioned has increased to 211 people and 63 entities.\n\n27 OCTOBER\n\nEUROPEAN MARITIME SURVEILLANCE NETWORK REACHES OPERATIONAL STATUS\n\nThe European project Maritime Surveillance (Marsur), developed by EDA since 2006, has reached its full operational status.
