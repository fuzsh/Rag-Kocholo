        "text": "Executive Summary\n\nRussia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine is of immense consequence. Estimates of the cost of reconstruction — ranging as high as $1 trillion — do not fully capture the significance of the situation. Failing to restore Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the security and prosperity of its citizens will cost trillions of dollars more in increased conflict, reduced development, and fractured leadership.\n\nPolitical commitment among Ukraine’s Western allies to reconstruction and recovery is robust. Material commitment, on the other hand, lags. To date, Western governments, intergovernmental organizations, and international financial institutions have allocated just under $80 bn to Ukraine’s postwar recovery, a fraction of a fraction of what will be needed. A holistic understanding of the urgency of the task is similarly lacking. Donors have rightly focused on the necessities of the war, but they have wrongly assumed that the job of recovery can only begin once the fighting has stopped. If recovery is to be real, the work must begin now.\n\nTo help galvanize this conversation, the Center for European Policy Analysis and the Kyiv School of Economics have drawn together four key pillars of recovery and reconstruction: economics and finance, Ukrainian reform, Western political will, and the postwar security architecture. Each of these pillars is vital to the stability of the edifice as a whole, and each must be addressed in parallel.\n\nSeen from this multi-domain perspective, there are four tasks of reconstruction and recovery:\n\nMaximizing wartime resilience in the face of continued Russian aggression\n\nInvesting in the economy and infrastructure of Ukraine’s future, rather than its past\n\nPreparing Ukraine for rapid and mutually beneficial integration into the European Union (EU)\n\nHardening Ukraine’s state, economy, and infrastructure, and deterring future Russian attacks\n\nThese tasks should be addressed in three phases, involving a sequential logic and beginning now. These are, with their attendant objectives:\n\nWartime Resilience\n\nMinimize destruction\n\nMaintain core state functions\n\nLimit refugee displacement\n\nPlan for postwar rebuilding\n\nRapid Rebuilding\n\nRestore full state functionality\n\nEncourage refugee return\n\nChannel investment to priority sectors\n\nStrengthen the foundation for European integration\n\nImplement flexible defense commitments\n\nDurable Development\n\nComplete integration into the EU and NATO\n\nShift economic production to high-value-added sectorsRightsize the Ukrainian state apparatus\n\nEmbed Ukraine in the European strategic defense architecture\n\nThe paper begins with a detailed examination of the economic scale of reconstruction and the financial resources available. This is followed by an analysis of two sets of political challenges: those for Ukraine and those for the West. The imperative of providing for Ukrainian security is examined separately. Finally, the paper proposes a sequenced approach to reconstruction and recovery, with specific tasks for Ukraine and its Western allies in each of the three phases.\n\nKey findings, conclusions, and recommendations include:\n\nWestern governments must continue providing direct financial support to Ukraine to maintain critical infrastructure, power supply, and public services during the conflict.\n\nWestern companies must be encouraged and incentivized to invest in Ukraine, even during the conflict. Private investment should precede and enable European integration, rather than be predicated on a successful accession bid.\n\nAll sides must begin detailed planning for postwar reconstruction now, focusing on building a digitized, greener, and more globally integrated economy; overcoming Soviet-era legacies; and promoting innovation.\n\nStakeholders should recognize that the war may reshape Ukraine’s population distribution and human and economic geography. This reshaping will be guided both by the preferences of Ukrainian citizens and enterprises, and by Ukraine’s future trading patterns.\n\nUkraine and its supporters should promote the use of systems like DREAM — the Digital Recovery Ecosystem for Accountable Management — to engage communities and civil society in the reconstruction agenda, fostering transparency and the democratic franchise.\n\nStrengthening Ukraine’s defense-industrial base; its economic, corporate and judicial governance; and its anti-corruption efforts will enhance the country’s ability to deter Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine’s medium-term tasks — absorbing hundreds of billions of dollars in aid, resettling hundreds of thousands of refugees, adopting EU legislation, and pursuing deep structural reforms — are within its grasp but will require a considerable increase in the state’s administrative capacity.\n\nConsolidating Ukraine’s democracy and promoting democratic engagement will be critical to ensuring inclusivity in postwar decision-making, popular buy-in to the country’s economic transformation, and a sense of transitional justice.\n\nThe EU must maintain a clear and unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s European perspective — and this commitment must involve deep reforms within the EU’s decision-making and funding mechanisms to accommodate enlargement to include Ukraine.\n\nIn the face of increasing political polarization, the US discussion on support for Ukraine must pivot to a clearer recognition of how US national interests hinge on Ukraine’s postwar success.\n\nUkraine’s Western allies must provide near-term military support to push Russian troops out of Ukrainian territory, medium-term security commitments to enable stable economic recovery, and long-term inclusion as a core constituent of the European security architecture.\n\n1. Understanding Ukrainian Reconstruction & Recovery\n\n1.1 A Call to Action\n\nIn a 1947 speech at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, the renowned diplomat and future secretary of state Dean Acheson made the case for the forthcoming Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Europe following the devastation of World War II. Acheson, a graduate of Yale and Harvard Law School, spoke at Delta State University, a public school in the Mississippi Delta with its roots as an agricultural school, because he understood that US reconstruction aid to Europe was neither an abstract idea or an academic exercise, nor solely the interest of political leaders and intellectual elites, but had practical and pressing implications for ordinary American farmers and workers. He told the audience:\n\n“Your Congress has authorized and your Government is carrying out a policy of relief and reconstruction today chiefly as a matter of national self-interest. For it is generally agreed that until the various countries of the world get on their feet and become self-supporting there can be no political or economic stability in the world and no lasting peace or prosperity for any of us. Without outside aid, the process of recovery in many countries would take so long as to give rise to hopelessness and despair. In these conditions freedom and democracy and the independence of nations could not long survive, for hopeless and hungry people often resort to desperate measures. The war will not be over until the people of the world can again feed and clothe themselves and face the future with some degree of confidence.”\n\nJust as Acheson recognized in 1947, today it is clear that there is not only a moral imperative to aid a democracy rebuilding from a war of aggression, but there is also a strategic imperative — and that living up to this imperative will require commitment and investment from quarters well beyond the halls of power in Washington, Brussels, Berlin, Paris, London, and elsewhere. It is not charity, but an investment in the security and prosperity of every US and European citizen and enterprise for Ukraine to succeed. That means not only support for Ukraine’s victory on the battlefield, but also for its reconstruction. This will require building a democratically and economically robust Ukraine.\n\nThere are countless rationales for the United States, Europe, and other global partners to support Ukraine’s reconstruction — not the least of which is the moral one. However, the following four reasons are clear for the international partners to invest in Ukraine’s reconstruction:\n\nWhether Ukraine emerges from the war successfully or not will set a precedent for future conflicts.\n\nUS and Western credibility on the world stage is on the line. If Ukraine is not helped to win both the war and the peace, US and NATO deterrence will be irreparably diminished.\n\nUkraine’s success is central to the future of the European project. If Ukraine’s territorial integrity and economic recovery are not ensured, the EU will face a fundamentally unstable country of more than 40 million people right on its doorstep.\n\nUkraine is a key player in global energy, agricultural, and other markets — all important for geopolitical priorities.\n\n1.1.1 Implications for global peace and security\n\nUkraine’s success is Russia’s failure. Conversely, Ukraine’s failure is the failure of the collective West. A Ukraine that emerges from the war as a strong democracy and vibrant economy that is firmly integrated into the Euro-Atlantic community is antithetical to Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s goals in his act of military aggression. Therefore, if the United States, Europe, and the broader international community wishes to deter authoritarian regimes — in Moscow or elsewhere — from similar acts of aggression, a successful Ukraine with strong international backing may be the single most powerful tool for achieving this goal.\n\nThe implications of the war in Ukraine reach far beyond the borders of Ukraine to the grand contest of great-power competition. It is clear that decision-makers in Beijing and Taipei are closely watching the war in Ukraine for what it means for Taiwan. Chinese leader Xi Jinping is drawing conclusions about the West’s fortitude, unity, and effectiveness. In a telling example early on in the war, Beijing conducted a comprehensive stress test to determine how well China could withstand sanctions similar to the kind imposed by the West on Russia in response to its illegal invasion of Ukraine. A vibrant and successful Ukraine emerging from war with international backing will be a strong deterrent for similar aggressions.\n\nThe world’s bullies, however, are not the only ones watching. Smaller powers around the world will also be drawing their own conclusions about the utility of Western security guarantees, and about the wisdom of forgoing nuclear weapons. Should Ukraine flounder, states around the world will be incentivized to build up their arsenals and forge local alliances, spurring regional arms races and security dilemmas, disrupting trade, and giving rise to a world of more war and less prosperity.\n\n1.1.2 Implications for US and Western credibility\n\nFor some readers, 1994 may feel like a different era. However, it was a moment of historical significance for both Ukraine and global security. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, several of the successor states, including Ukraine, held nuclear weapons that were once part of the USSR’s arsenal. Recognizing the importance of reducing the overall number of nuclear-armed states, international actors negotiated to ensure that Russia was the only country to inherit nuclear capabilities as the largest successor state. Ukraine acted as the United States, Europe, and other responsible international actors hoped, and transferred its nuclear arsenal to Moscow along the provisions established in the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances for Ukraine. It is rare for a country to willingly give up its nuclear weapons, in large part because it is the ultimate deterrent against a foreign invader. The reason Ukraine pursued this unlikely path is because the United States and the United Kingdom provided security assurances. While not a “security guarantee,” which would have implied the commitment of military forces, the security assurances clearly meant that there would be a response and support if Ukraine were to face a threat. Ukrainian politicians and the public believed that, alongside security assurances, the United States and the United Kingdom also committed to laying a foundation for a more stable future. In return for their sacrifice, Ukrainians anticipated — but, until 2022, never truly received — a warm embrace from the West.\n\nIn the years since, the United States and much of Europe have repeatedly pledged their support for Ukraine and its transition to democracy. Whether it was the George W. Bush administration pledging support for pro-democratic forces following the Orange Revolution or the Obama administration’s support in the wake of the Euromaidan protests (the Maidan uprising) and Russia’s initial invasion of Donbass and illegal annexation of Crimea, support for Ukraine has long been a bipartisan goal. Prior to 2022, support for Ukraine, including sanctions against Russia, fluctuated from year to year and differed between US and European leaders, but the overall commitment of 1994 has remained. Not to follow through on it, or even to adopt a narrow reading, would undermine the credibility of the United States’ word.\n\nUS power on the world stage has always been in part due to its strong network of allies — most notably in Europe. If its commitment and ability to follow through on promises comes under question, allies and potential allies will notice. The next time it asks for support, aid, or assistance on the world stage — or simply to do the right thing for global security, such as forgoing a nuclear arsenal — whether and the degree to which the United States stood by its commitments will be deeply considered.\n\n1.1.3 Implications for the future of Europe\n\nWhile relations between Russia and Ukraine have a long and complicated history, in many ways the present war in Ukraine, started in late 2013 when Russia began its military incursions, is a culmination of its subtle hybrid warfare preparations against Ukraine since the 1990s. Ukraine and the EU were set to sign an association agreement. However, under pressure from the Kremlin, the government of then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, a close Putin ally, decided to suspend the signing of the agreement, instead opting for closer cooperation and ties with Russia. But the people of Ukraine wanted a future associated with Europe and the liberal democratic values that accompany that opportunity.\n\nThe Euromaidan protest, which grew into the Revolution of Dignity that gripped Ukraine in the winter of 2013–14 and threw Yanukovych out of power, was about the country’s future as a part of Europe, and so too was Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and the initial invasion of Donbass in 2014, the resulting war in the east, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Putin’s strategic blunder in invading Ukraine had the unintended consequence of bringing about a revived, expanded, and newly unified NATO and breathing new life into the transatlantic alliance.\n\nAccording to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are over 6 million Ukrainian refugees recorded living beyond the borders of their home country, mostly in Europe, having left because of the war. This is in addition to the over 5 million internally displaced Ukrainians and 17.6 million in need of emergency humanitarian assistance. Many Ukrainians want to return home as soon as possible and help rebuild their country. But there needs to be opportunity and security. Lasting security and economic development in Ukraine will convince Ukrainian refugees to come back home and contribute to growing trade among European countries and overall prosperity of the EU.\n\nThe potential implications for European security and prosperity extend far beyond the issue of migration, however. A Ukraine that does not defeat Putin’s invasion will be a hotbed of instability on the EU’s doorstep, with an economy unable to recover from the destruction of the war, a government incapable of fulfilling its core functions, parts of the country occupied by a foreign power, a permanent lack of skilled labor as refugees build new lives abroad, and millions of people injured and psychologically traumatized after years of war.\n\n1.1.4 Implications for the global economy\n\nIn addition to the moral and strategic interests of a Ukrainian victory, there are wider economic and humanitarian interests in Ukraine’s successful reconstruction. Ukraine is among the world’s top agricultural exporters. Prior to Russia’s invasion, Ukraine was the third-largest exporter of barley making up 18% of global exports, the fourth-largest exporter of corn (maize) with 16% of global exports, and the fifth-largest exporter of wheat with 12% of global exports, according to the EU. The top recipients of Ukrainian cereals include many countries with fragile governance and of global strategic significance, including Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\n\nUkraine also accounts for more than half of the world’s exports of sunflower oil, a major food source and the preferred oil in most of Europe, Mexico, and several South American countries. In fact, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption it caused was a major contributor to the shortage of baby formula in the United States in 2022 because sunflower oil is an important ingredient for the formula.\n\nRussia’s invasion initially led to a drop in Ukraine’s exports and a global food security crisis. While much of the negative impact has been alleviated through EU measures and the on-and-off United Nations-negotiated deal for grain export, the initial disruption demonstrates just how important the “Ukrainian breadbasket” is to the world.\n\nUkraine also has abundant natural resources with the second-largest (after Norway) known gas reserves in Europe, which are mostly untapped. It also has an abundant supply of coal, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and more.\n\n1.2 The Scale of the Task\n\nThe economic analysis conducted by the Kyiv School of Economics and presented in this paper suggests that the direct damage to Ukraine’s economic, social, and human infrastructure caused by Russia’s war amounted to some $154.9 bn as of September 2023. The costs of recovery, however, are considerably higher, estimated to approaching $500 bn—more than double Ukraine’s gross domestic product (GDP) before the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. Even that figure, however, grossly underestimates the scale of the task at hand.\n\nGenuine Ukrainian recovery — recovery that would achieve the strategic objectives outlined above — is about much more than simply rebuilding what Russia has destroyed. To restore Ukraine to its place in the global economy, to produce lasting stability, and to ensure that Ukraine itself contributes and benefits from the European project, recovery efforts will need to focus on four interwoven tasks:\n\nMaximizing wartime resilience in the face of continued Russian aggression\n\nInvesting in the economy and infrastructure of Ukraine’s future, rather than its past\n\nPreparing Ukraine for rapid and mutually beneficial integration into the EU\n\nHardening Ukraine’s state, economy, and infrastructure, and deterring future Russian attack\n\n1.2.1 Maximizing wartime resilience\n\nDelaying Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction until after the fighting stops is a mistake. Indeed, Western governments have already invested tens of billions of dollars in repairing and replacing damaged infrastructure and equipment, allowing Ukraine to keep the lights and heat on, schools and hospitals operating, goods and people flowing, and the state itself functioning. Without these efforts to rebuild even in the midst of war, it is not at all clear that recovery would ever become an option.\n\nInvesting in Ukraine now, however, also helps reduce the eventual cost of reconstruction and recovery down the road. It does so in part by limiting the damage caused by the war to the country’s physical capital, thus reducing the scale of the reconstruction task when the war ends and increasing the resources that will be available in the country for the larger-scale postwar recovery agenda. Equally importantly, meanwhile, investing in Ukraine now makes it easier for Ukrainians to remain in Ukraine, reducing the outflow of refugees and ensuring that the country’s human capital also remains intact. When the war ends, access to that skilled and motivated workforce will be of critical importance.\n\nThus far, governments have led the way on wartime resilience along three key vectors. First, direct financial support — including some $500 m in donated equipment — has kept power plants and transmission networks online, and provided generating capacity to critical facilities across Ukraine. Similar efforts have helped keep goods moving in and out of the country, while direct budgetary support has allowed government at all levels to keep providing public services. Second, the EU, in particular, has provided tens of billions of euros worth of indirect support, including the connection of Ukraine to Europe’s electricity grid in the early days of the full-scale invasion, and the opening of access to the Common Market for Ukrainian agricultural and other exports. And third, a significant portion of the military support provided to Ukraine has gone to defending civilian populations, enterprises, and infrastructure, including air-defense systems and demining equipment.\n\nLooking ahead, even as these efforts continue, more emphasis will need to be placed on mobilizing private sector involvement. To date, only a small number of Western companies — most notably Bayer and ArcelorMittal — have been willing to invest in the midst of the fighting. Increased private investment will require more concerted support by Western governments on insurance, as well as increased awareness among potential investors of the limited risks involved in infrastructure, logistics, and equipment investments in areas farther from the front lines.\n\n1.2.2 Rebuilding for strength\n\nPostwar Ukraine will be different. The country’s citizens, entrepreneurs, and business leaders are aiming to build a more digitized, greener, and globally integrated economy, focused on producing higher-value-added goods and services, and generating greater social mobility. Postwar reconstruction provides an opportunity to channel investment into the facilities, industries, and reforms that will underpin Ukraine’s ambitions.\n\nThe war is also likely to have a lasting impact on Ukraine’s human and economic geography. Citizens and communities will face difficult and often emotionally laden decisions about what to rebuild and where, and not every town and village that was destroyed by Russia’s invasion may reemerge in the same size and shape. Some population movements — whether from east to west, or from rural to urban areas — may turn out to be lasting shifts. Making sure that every Ukrainian has a home, a school, a hospital, and a workplace will have to respond to the decisions Ukrainians make about where they want to live and do business.\n\nFinally, Ukraine’s shifting trading patterns are also likely to be a permanent feature of the country’s future. Export routes, which have historically moved goods from the north to the south, to be exported via the Black Sea, will need to be augmented (because Russia has systematically infringed upon maritime freedom of navigation) — if not outright replaced — by routes running from east to west, moving goods into the EU, for example. Import infrastructure will need to undergo a similar transition. While stopgap and makeshift solutions have already been found, they will need to be made more durable and efficient for the future.\n\nThrough systems like DREAM — the Digital Restoration Ecosystem for Accountable Management, which allows local communities and civil society groups to participate in and monitor agenda-setting for reconstruction — Ukraine is already designing this new future. Conversations on reconstruction in the West, however, remain dominated by an accounting of what has been destroyed. It is imperative that Western thinking about the scale and scope of reconstruction begin to be driven by an accounting of what Ukraine will need to thrive in the future.\n\n1.2.3 Preparing for European integration\n\nChief among Ukraine’s ambitions for its future is the country’s European perspective. As the European Commission opens formal accession negotiations with Kyiv, the course and content of negotiations — and the necessity of adopting European regulation — will provide a framework for governments, lenders, investors, and businesses as they determine priorities and weigh the costs and benefits of projects. Maintaining this focus will help lower the costs of adaptation and forestall the emergence of entrenched interests opposed to various European regulatory requirements. Obstacles will inevitably emerge as concrete negotiations take place and governments comprehend the fundamental changes that Ukraine’s accession will bring to the union. Hungarian and Slovak hostility to Ukraine may remain a serious problem. But the other 25 EU member states’ clear commitment to Ukraine’s European future is notable — and as dramatic a shift compared to the pre-February 2022 world as one could have imagined.\n\nUkraine’s European perspective, meanwhile, must not be allowed to delay investment in the country’s near-term recovery. All parties understand that the accession process will be slow — indeed, attempting to rush Ukraine’s European integration would likely be counterproductive — but the more Ukraine prospers, the faster the process will proceed. It is thus imperative that private-sector investment in Ukraine not be predicated on the pace of accession negotiations. This will require a clear political commitment from Kyiv, Brussels, and the EU member states to accession, such that even if negotiations get bogged down, businesses can remain confident in their ultimate outcome.\n\nIndeed, Ukraine’s European perspective is predicated on the country’s ability to maximize private investment and enterprise in the near term. This is for two reasons. First, the investment by Ukrainian, European, and US enterprises in Europe-oriented projects will help solidify cross-border political support for accession and impose political costs on those politicians who would stand in the way. Second, and perhaps more importantly, a rapid Ukrainian economic recovery will help allay fears in Europe about the drain that Ukrainian accession could impose on EU resources.\n\nNot all of the work on European integration, however, falls to Ukraine. Absorbing Ukraine will require deep reforms to the EU’s decision-making mechanisms, as well as to the Common Agricultural Policy and other funding mechanisms. A failure to address these issues to the satisfaction of member states will stymie Ukraine’s accession process even if Ukraine itself fulfills all of its requirements. Resolving the EU’s own enlargement bottlenecks, then, is an inextricable part of the Ukrainian recovery and reconstruction agenda.\n\n1.2.4 Deterring future Russian attack\n\nLong-term security is both the key condition of Ukrainian recovery, and the key outcome. As will be discussed further in this paper, durable progress toward all of the objectives outlined here will be possible only when the war is won and Ukraine can function as a fully sovereign state, society, and economy. That will require both near-term military support to push Russian troops out of Ukrainian territory, and genuinely reliable long-term security commitments — likely involving or equivalent to membership in NATO. But Ukraine will only be truly sovereign and secure if it has the wherewithal to deter and resist conventional and hybrid Russian aggression, and that requires hardening the country’s political, economic, and social institutions.\n\nAs the war has demonstrated, much has already been done. The resilience of the Ukrainian state, society, and economy has been both a remarkable success story and perhaps the central variable determining the country’s ability to repel Russia’s invasion. Nonetheless, poverty, economic fragility, gaps in corporate and judicial governance, and residual corruption contributed to Ukraine’s vulnerability prior to the full-scale invasion and will need to be overcome if Ukrainians are to enjoy a more secure and prosperous future.\n\nReconstruction and recovery, then, must also include efforts to redevelop and sustain a defense-industrial base adequate to the task of deterring Russia militarily, an economy sufficient to fund a robust state and military, and practices of political, judicial, and corporate governance that are impervious to attempts at malign influence, whether of domestic or foreign origin. Of equal importance will be a focus on the democratic franchise and transitional justice, ensuring that Ukrainians of all backgrounds and political orientations have a stake in the future of the country, and that their voices are heard in all of the difficult decisions that will need to be made in the coming months, years, and decades.\n\n2. Economic & Financial Challenges\n\nIn this chapter, we outline the magnitude of the economic recovery challenge by estimating damages, losses, and needs. Our findings are part of an ongoing effort —undertaken jointly by the World Bank, the Government of Ukraine, the European Commission, and the United Nations, and supported by other partners — to take stock of Ukraine’s damages and losses from Russia’s invasion and to assess the scale of economic and social needs for Ukraine’s survival during the war and its prosperity afterward. This work has resulted in the publication of three Rapid Damage and Needs Assessments (RDNA) by the World Bank in August 2022, March 2023, and February 2024, as well as several publications by KSE Institute’s Russia Will Pay / damaged.in.ua project.\n\nThe assessment of damages, losses, and needs follows a globally established and recognized methodology jointly developed by the project partners, which has been applied frequently in post-disaster and war contexts to inform recovery and reconstruction planning. We recognize the serious constraints surrounding these assessments due to the ongoing military conflict and occupation of parts of Ukrainian territory. As field verification was not possible in some cases, additional resources such as satellite imagery and drone footage were employed to gather information about areas currently inaccessible.\n\nDamages to Ukraine as a result of Russia’s war go far beyond the physical infrastructure assessed in this chapter. We recognize that the large number of international refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) represents a major challenge for the country’s economic recovery. In addition to massive labor market distortions, which impact Ukraine’s capacity to absorb investment, we must not underestimate the challenge of reintegrating hundreds of thousands of soldiers as well as the psychological toll that almost two years of war have taken on the entire population. While critical for Ukraine’s recovery, these issues are somewhat beyond the scope of this analysis. However, as more data emerges, we plan to address such aspects in our future work.\n\n2.1 Assessing Damages and Needs\n\nWe assess that, as of January 2024, total damages due to Russia’s war of aggression stood at $154.9 bn (see Figure 2.1). This figure includes the direct cost of destroyed or damaged physical assets and infrastructure. With Russia’s retreat from large swaths of Ukrainian territory — in the north of the country as well as the Kharkiv and Kherson regions — and geographical shifts of the front line becoming less dynamic despite heavy fighting, damages are leveling off somewhat, especially compared to the early months of the war. Losses — changes in economic flows due to the war — were estimated at $499.6 bn as of February 2024. Finally, the value associated with the restoration of the damaged infrastructure over the next ten years under building back better principles is $486.0 bn (as of February 2024).\n\nDamages differ considerably between sectors of the economy, with social sectors accounting for $71.4 bn, infrastructure sectors for $54.4 bn, and productive sectors for $28.9 bn (see Figure 2‑2 and Figure 2-3). Subsequently, we discuss in detail the damages to different sectors and subsectors and highlight key developments. The highest damages are identified for housing ($58.9 bn), followed by transportation infrastructure ($39.9 bn), commerce/industry ($15.7 bn), agriculture/forests ($13.2 bn), energy ($9.0 bn), and education ($6.8 bn).\n\nWe also observe significant regional differences (see Figure 2‑4). Damages are highest in (partially) occupied parts of the country where the front line has been for most of the full-scale invasion: Donetsk ($37.4 bn), Kharkiv ($30.2 bn), Luhansk ($17.1 bn), Zaporizhzhia ($14.8 bn), and Kherson ($12.3 bn) regions. However, we also find significant damages in areas that have been targeted repeatedly by missile and drone strikes, such as Kyiv and the wider Kyiv region ($13.3 bn together).\n\n2.2 The Social Sector\n\nThe social sector includes housing, education, health care, culture, sport, tourism, and social services. According to the latest assessment, total direct damages stood at $71.4 bn, indirect losses at $71.2 bn, and reconstruction needs at $161.8 bn.\n\n2.2.1 Housing\n\nAs of January 2024, we estimate total damages to residential buildings at $58.9 bn — more than one-third of the total damages to the economy. The number of destroyed or damaged buildings is ~250,000, according to preliminary data from regional administrations, which accounts for 88.9 million square meters or 8.6% of Ukraine’s entire housing stock. Sixty-five thousand eight hundred residential buildings with a total area of 25.2 million square meters are considered to be destroyed (degree of destruction of more than 40%), 84,500 buildings (48.1 million square meters) to be moderately damaged (degree of destruction between 10% and 40%), and 16,900 buildings (15.6 million square meters) to be partially damaged (degree of destruction below 10%). Altogether, we estimate that 1.4 million households and 3.4 million people are affected by damaged or destroyed residential buildings.\n\nThe extent of damages varies substantially across regions, with many cities and towns facing reconstruction challenges that go far beyond the renovation or reconstruction of individual buildings. Urban structures will require comprehensive restoration. For example, we estimate that more than 90% of buildings have been damaged or destroyed in Sievierodonetsk, while places such as Bakhmut and Maryinka have essentially no undamaged buildings. We also find the most heavily damaged housing stock in the cities of Chernihiv, Izyum, Kharkiv, Lysychansk, Mariupol, Popasna, Rubizhne, and Volnovakha, many of which have seen heavy fighting for extended periods of time. Due to ongoing hostilities, including persistent missile and drone attacks, damages continue to grow, especially in the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions. Russia’s destruction of the Kakhovka dam in June 2023 exposed an additional 36,000 residential buildings with a total area of 4.8 million square meters to significant flooding risk.\n\nIn addition to direct damages, indirect losses are estimated at $17.4 bn, which include additional rental costs and dismantling and waste-removal costs, and reconstruction needs at $80.3 bn.\n\n2.2.2 Education\n\nDirect damages in the education sector amount to $6.8 bn as of January 2024. We estimate that close to 380 educational facilities have been destroyed and around 3,429 damaged, including preschool (kindergartens), secondary (schools), out-of-school, pre-university (colleges, technical schools), higher (institutes, universities, academies), and specialized educational institutions. Among these facilities, schools (~1,888) and kindergartens (~1,285) are most prominent. Damages go beyond the areas of direct hostilities; educational facilities have been affected in 21 Ukrainian regions, with Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Dnipro, and Zaporizhzhia accounting for the largest damages.\n\nIn addition to damaged or destroyed structures, Russia’s full-scale invasion has led to the suspension of educational services in many places, the departure of many recipients of such services, as well as the redirection of budgetary resources to areas such as defense, disaster relief, and social protection. Thus, indirect losses stand at $6.9 bn. Reconstruction needs amount to $13.9 bn.\n\n2.2.3 Health care\n\nAs of January 2024, direct damages to the health care sector amount to $3.1 bn. This accounts for 1.9% of Ukraine’s total damages. At least 1,284 health care facilities have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the full-scale invasion, including 426 hospitals and 358 clinics/dispensaries. Damages in the health care sector are heavily concentrated in three regions — Mykolaiv, Donetsk and Chernihiv — which make up more than half of the total.\n\nThe suspension of activities, reduction of operational income, and departure of some recipients of health care services from Ukraine have caused indirect losses of $17.8 bn. Reconstruction needs are estimated at $14.2 bn.\n\n2.2.4 Other\n\nBeyond these key segments, we estimate additional damages of $2.6 bn to other social sectors. Additional indirect losses are $29.1 bn and reconstruction needs $53.4 bn.\n\nThe devastation caused to social services infrastructure accounts for $200 m and largely consists of damaged or destroyed social centers and similar facilities. These are largely located in Kyiv as well as the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine that are close to the front lines or are/were under occupation. In this sector, indirect losses are significantly larger than direct damages — $9.5 bn – and reconstruction needs amount to $44.5 bn. The driver is the number of additional people requiring some type of social assistance. For instance, in 2022, payments were made to 32,900 people disabled as a result of the war, 33,500 people discharged from the military due to injuries, and 21,900 families that lost a breadwinner in the war. In addition, one-third of the 3.3 million to 5 million IDPs required housing assistance, for which $1.7 bn was allocated in 2022. Due to the high intensity of hostilities and persistent missile/drone attacks, 12.5 million people in at least six regions are estimated to have lost access to social services, while 13 million people in seven regions have had their access seriously impaired.\n\nDirect damages to the culture, religion, and tourism sectors total $2.4 bn. As of September, we count 1,804 cultural facilities (including 83 museums), 348 religious buildings, 343 sporting facilities (including eight stadiums), and 164 touristic structures (including 157 hotels and restaurants) that have been damaged or destroyed. Damages are concentrated in 14 regions: Chernihiv, Dnipro, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv (city and region), Luhansk, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Odessa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr. In addition, indirect losses due to the war amount to $19.6 bn and reconstruction needs to $8.9 bn.\n\n2.3 Infrastructure\n\nThe infrastructure sector includes roads, railroads, airports, waterways, energy, utilities, and digital systems. According to the latest assessment, total direct damages stood at $54.4 bn, indirect losses at $115.7 bn, and reconstruction needs at $148.0 bn.\n\n2.3.1 Transportation\n\nAs a result of Russia’s war of aggression, direct damages in the transport infrastructure sector have reached $39.9 bn. In our assessment, this includes damages of $27 bn to roads, $4.3 bn to railroads, $2 bn to airports, and $0.85 bn to ports and waterways. More than 25,400 kilometers of roads and 344 bridges at the state, local, and municipal levels were damaged or destroyed. In the railroad sector, damages extend to more than 507 kilometers of tracks and 126 stations and yards, while more than 700 kilometers of railroad lines are located in currently occupied territories. We also estimate that a total 4,000 to 5,500 structures owned by state-owned railroad Ukrzaliznytsia have been damaged or destroyed. In addition, all movable property, including locomotives and railcars, in occupied territories should be considered as lost. Civil aviation in Ukraine ended with the start of the full-scale invasion. Since then, 19 out of 35 airfields have been damaged, including 12 civilian and 7 dual-purpose ones; damages also extend to air navigation facilities. We assess that at least four Ukrainian ports have been damaged or destroyed with recent Russian missile and drone attacks focusing increasingly on such facilities. Finally, the war has caused damages of $3.1 bn to vehicles, including $1.9 bn related to 212,000 private passenger vehicles, $300 m due to the destruction of the Mriya transport plane, and $90 m in more than 1,600 lost fire-fighting vehicles. The remainder is largely accounted for by public transportation vehicles: trams, buses, etc.\n\nIndirect losses are also significant and reached $40.7 bn, largely due to lost business opportunities and reduced operational incomes (of Ukrzaliznytsia as well as airlines). Indirect losses from damaged or destroyed vehicles are estimated at $300 m, and total transportation-related recovery needs amount to $73.7 bn.\n\n2.3.2 Energy\n\nDirect damages to Ukraine’s energy infrastructure are estimated at $9.0 bn. Russia’s continued attacks on electricity production, transmission, and distribution alone have caused damages of $7.4 bn. Direct damages to Ukraine’s energy infrastructure are estimated at $8.9 bn.\n\n2.3.3 Utilities\n\nDirect damages to utilities amount to $4.5 bn and include district heating infrastructure, water supply, sewage, and waste management. Since the outbreak of full-scale invasion, we counted 25 damaged or destroyed CHPPs, 183 district heating stations, and 355 kilometers of heating networks. In addition, more than 1,947 kilometers of water supply networks and 25 water treatment plants have been damaged or destroyed, as well as 182 water pumping stations and 159 wells. As a result, residents in some areas are lacking adequate access to drinking water. Damages also affect 31 kilometers of sewage systems, 183 sewage pumping stations, 51 sewage treatment plants, 33 landfills, and five waste-sorting facilities. Aside from direct damages, indirect losses in the utilities sector amount to $11.6 bn. Reconstruction needs are calculated at $11.1 bn.\n\n2.3.4 Digital\n\nDirect damages to utilities amount to $4.5 bn and include district heating infrastructure, water supply, sewage, and waste management. Since the outbreak of full-scale invasion, we counted 25 damaged or destroyed CHPPs, 183 district heating stations, and 355 kilometers of heating networks. In addition, more than 1,947 kilometers of water supply networks and 25 water treatment plants have been damaged or destroyed, as well as 182 water pumping stations and159 wells. As a result, residents in some areas are lacking adequate access to drinking water. Damages also affect 31 kilometers of sewage systems, 183 sewage pumping stations, 51 sewage treatment plants, 33 landfills, and five waste-sorting facilities. Aside from direct damages, indirect losses in the utilities sector amount to $11.6 bn. Reconstruction needs are calculated at $11.1 bn.\n\nWe assess that damages to digital infrastructure have reached $500 m. At least 726 operators of electronic communications with fixed access to the Internet have been affected by the war. In the aftermath of the de-occupation of territories, network destruction levels have often been found to be close to 100%. Indirect losses currently stand at $2.6 bn with reduced access to communications services as the driving force. As of May 2023, the average quality of data transmission via fixed-line Internet had declined by 13% and via mobile Internet by 26%. As more than 3,534 mobile operator base stations are out of service, 12.2% of settlements are estimated to have no access to mobile communications and 3.1% reduced access. According to the RDNA3, reconstruction will cost $4.7 bn.\n\n2.4 Municipal Services\n\nMunicipal services also belong to the infrastructure sector. Here, we estimate that direct damages, as of January 2024, amount to $500 m due to the destruction of administrative buildings. In addition, indirect losses are appraised at $6.8 bn and reconstruction needs at $11.4 bn.\n\n2.5 Productive Sector\n\nThe productive sector includes commerce and industry, agriculture, and finance. According to the latest assessment, total direct damages stood at $28.9 bn, indirect losses at $249.4 bn, and reconstruction needs at $136.6 bn.\n\n2.5.1 Commerce and industry\n\nDamages related to enterprises’ assets are estimated at $13.1 bn, which includes the loss of fixed assets, capital investments in progress, and inventories of finished goods as well as intermediate materials. This category is the third-largest and accounts for almost 8% of total damages to the Ukrainian economy. At least 426 large and medium-sized private enterprises, many state-owned companies, and tens of thousands of small private businesses have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the full-scale invasion. The metallurgy sector has been the most affected, with the two largest enterprises — Azovstal and MMK in Mariupol — fully destroyed. In addition to the Donetsk region, the heaviest damages are found in Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Luhansk. Retailers sustained additional damages of $2.6 bn. According to an online survey of top managers , at least 2,900 retail outlets of individual entrepreneurs are significantly affected, resulting in damages of $2.2 bn, while nine destroyed and 22 damaged shopping centers account for $378 m.\n\nNot surprisingly, commerce and industry experience a particularly high ratio of losses to damages due to business activities and revenues that could not be realized. Indirect losses to commerce and industry are estimated at $173.251.5 bn. Together, this is more than one-third of all indirect losses. Reconstruction needs are also significant—at $67.5 bn.\n\n2.5.2 Agriculture\n\nAs of January 2024, the amount of direct damages incurred by the Ukrainian agricultural sector (including forestry) amounted to $13.2 bn. This includes losses of agricultural machinery ($4.7 bn), elevators, and other facilities for grain storage ($1.3 bn), reclamation systems, as well as losses to livestock farming from animal deaths and slaughter due to the inability to keep animals. In addition, damages to forests amount to $4.5 bn. Direct damages are exceeded by far by indirect losses of $70.5 bn. Reduced crop production plays the biggest role, followed by losses incurred by producers due to the disruption of exports, lower livestock production, negative effects from higher production costs, and losses due to the need for reclamation. Reconstruction needs in agriculture/forestry amount to $66.8 bn.\n\n2.5.3 Finance\n\nDirect losses to the financial sector, including real estate, amounted to $44 m. Banks were the most affected — directly and through problems with the business of their clients. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, banks have closed about 1,500 branches, or 20% of the total number (acording to NBU, as of June 2023). In regions where active hostilities are taking place, the share is around two-thirds. The indirect costs/losses incurred are much higher, however, at $5.7 bn. The most important factor is credit risk. Reconstruction needs in the financial sector amount to $2.3 bn.\n\n2.5.4 Environment\n\nDamages to the environment are extremely difficult to assess and extend beyond the scope of this analysis. However, some general observations may illustrate the magnitude of the challenge. As of September 2023, hostilities have caused 2,049 cases of disruption and damage to at least 1,093 enterprises and critical infrastructure facilities that could have led to environmental pollution. At least 188,000 square kilometers of soil are at risk of contamination. The future use of the affected land will be further complicated by the need for reclamation, demining, and disposal of unexploded ordnance. In total, 46,000 square kilometers (or 43%) of the Nature Reserve Fund and Emerald Network — two networks of parks and protected areas — are at risk of damage and pollution. One-third (393) of Natural Reserve Fund and Emerald Network sites are located in the combat zone, 257 are located up to 5 kilometers from the front line, and 347 are under occupation. The war has also led to substantial forest and grass fires, which, together with the burning of oil and oil products, caused significant air pollution by releasing 1.24 million tons of pollutants.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for reconstruction is the extensive mining of Ukraine’s territory. We estimate that Russia’s invasion has left around 30% of the land contaminated with explosive ordnance, posing a significant threat to both lives and economic activity. Among the most affected are small-scale agricultural producers, constituting 65% of the sector and contributing 10% of cereal and leguminous crop production. With approximately 9% of their farmland contaminated, the estimated cost of demining for over 22,000 small producers could reach $250 m. Recovery needs regarding demining are assessed to be around $34.6 bn in total and have been identified by the Ukrainian government as a key priority.\n\n2.6 Assessing Available Resources\n\nWhile Russia’s war on Ukraine is still ongoing — and a true end of hostilities may not materialize for years to come — recovery planning must start now. This is critical in order to strengthen Ukraine’s resilience during the war, initiate robust and durable post-conflict reconstruction, and ensure successful integration into the EU. Furthermore, the country’s budget requires foreign assistance to the tune of $40 bn per year just to maintain core government functions. In the interest of political stability on the European continent, there is no time to waste.\n\nFormal international discussions of Ukrainian recovery and reconstruction have, to date, largely avoided making public pronouncements about the volume and sources of money available, focusing instead on efforts to assess the damage, prioritize projects, and address immediate needs. As a result, with the cost of reconstruction estimated to be at least $486 bn (according to the RDNA3). but potentially reaching up to $1 trillion, the volume of money currently committed to Ukraine’s recovery falls well short of the sum that will be needed.\n\nWhile there is as yet no compendium of global commitments to Ukraine’s long-term recovery, a rough estimate suggests that Western governments, intergovernmental organizations, and the international financial institutions have thus far committed some $76 bn. Adding the Russian Central Bank reserves currently frozen in Western accounts brings the total currently available funding to $376.1 bn — but questions remain about how much, if any, of that money will find its way to Ukraine. (See Figure 2.5).\n\nWhile the numbers seem large, some historical perspective can be useful. After the end of World War II, with the Cold War looming, the United States committed $13.3 bn to the Marshall Plan, which was disbursed over a period of roughly three years (April 1948 to June 1952) — this was equivalent to 1.6% of US GDP per year at the time. Assuming a maximalist price tag for Ukrainian reconstruction of $1 trillion, that would come to less than 2% of the combined GDP of the United States, the EU, and the other members of the Group of Seven (Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom) in a single year. The amount currently committed, by contrast, comes only to 0.15% of combined GDP. Since Ukraine’s reconstruction is a multiyear project and disbursement will occur over an extended period of time, the actual financial burden per year would be even smaller.\n\n2.6.1 Governments and intergovernmental organizations\n\nWhile Western governments have been politically committed to Ukraine’s reconstruction and recovery since well before the full-scale invasion — the first formal Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) was held in London in 2017 — material commitments to postwar reconstruction and recovery have lagged behind contributions to Ukraine’s wartime resilience. Nonmilitary assistance to Ukraine through July 2023 has totaled some $132.5 bn, supplemented by $17.4 bn in humanitarian assistance. Of this, the EU has led the way, with the European Commission and European Council allocating $82 bn, followed by the United States ($29.2 bn), the United Kingdom ($7.7 bn), and Japan ($6.9 bn). The Multi-Agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine (MDCP), co-chaired by the European Commission and the government of Ukraine, is committed to raising a further $14 bn for immediate needs in the “energy, humanitarian, demining, housing and critical and social infrastructure” sectors.\n\nWhile this support may help lower the cost of postwar reconstruction, it is not, in itself, a long-term commitment. While the MDCP acknowledges the task of beginning to coordinate government-level contributions to Ukraine’s longer-term recovery, it has yet to publish its own estimates of either the scale of the task or the level of resources it expects to muster. Among those long-term commitments that have begun to crystallize, the EU leads the way. Thus, following the 2023 London URC, the EU announced a $53.3 bn Ukraine Facility for 2024–27, of which $18.1 bn would come in the form of grants, and the remainder as low-interest loans. In addition, the EU unveiled cooperative agreements with the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to provide $852.2 m in instruments to incentivize and insure private-sector investment.\n\nThe United Kingdom, as host of the most recent URC in June 2023, has announced $293.7 m in direct financial commitments to Ukrainian reconstruction, and a further $3 bn in loan guarantees, designed to unlock private-sector investment. The United States, by contrast, has been reluctant to announce large-scale, longer-term funding commitments beyond a $1.3 bn project focusing on rebuilding and modernizing Ukraine’s electricity grid, logistics infrastructure, and border systems, and a $230 m US Agency for International Development (USAID) project to spur private-sector development. However, the appointment of former Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker as US President Joe Biden’s special representative for Ukraine’s economic recovery — and the United States’ high-level delegate to the MDCP — is widely seen as a signal of further commitments to come. Finally, the United Nations’ Ukraine Community Recovery Fund is committed to mobilizing $300 m to restore housing and critical infrastructure, and to support business recovery.\n\n2.6.2 International financial institutions\n\nIn addition to direct governmental support, the international financial institutions (IFIs) — chiefly the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the EIB, and the EBRD — have been empowered by their shareholders to develop their own facilities to invest in Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction.\n\nAmong the IFIs, the largest source of support for Ukraine by far comes from the IMF, which has committed $115 bn to the country’s financial and budgetary stabilization. Within this, a $15.5 bn Extended Fund Facility is specifically targeted to support for recovery through 2027. The World Bank’s primary platform for supporting Ukrainian recovery and reconstruction — the Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and Reform Trust Fund (URTF) — has launched projects focusing on logistics, energy, health, housing, and agriculture, with a total price tag of $2.9 billion; of that sum, $1.3 billion, or about 45%, has been secured and committed.\n\nThe EBRD has committed to investments of $3.2 billion in Ukraine through the end of 2023 — primarily focusing on short-term liquidity to the country’s energy and transportation sectors — but has yet to announce a concerted approach to longer-term reconstruction, beyond the cooperative agreements with the EU mentioned earlier. And the EIB — backed primarily by the European Commission — has announced some $894.8 million in investment programs, concentrating on housing and social infrastructure, water and sanitation, transportation, digital infrastructure, and energy efficiency.\n\n2.6.3 Private sector\n\nThe URC’s Ukraine Business Compact — involving a declared readiness to invest in Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction — has been signed by some 600 enterprises from 42 countries, with a combined market capitalization of more than $5.2 trillion. Nonetheless, relatively few companies have been willing to invest significant amounts of money in Ukraine while the fighting continues. Notable exceptions include\n\nArcelorMittal, which committed $400 million to its facilities in Kryvyi Rih through 2024\n\nOnur Group, which committed to a $50 million investment in graphite mining in Khmelnytskyi oblast and a further $150 million in renewable energy in Zakarpattia\n\nBayer, which has committed some $101 million to agricultural projects in Zhytomyr and elsewhere\n\nKingspan Group, which has launched a $280 million investment in a building materials plant in Lviv oblast\n\nLooking ahead to the immediate postwar period, German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall, which has already been servicing Ukrainian tanks at its German facilities, has announced plans to build a production facility in Ukraine worth approximately $215 million. Sweden’s BAE Systems Hägglunds has announced similar plans.\n\nFinally, the investment banks and fund managers BlackRock and JPMorgan are working with the government of Ukraine to launch the Ukraine Development Fund, which will seek to mobilize, pool, and manage global private sector direct and portfolio investment in Ukraine’s recovery. The expected size of the fund has not yet been announced, but the Ukrainian government estimates that the investment market in its core priority areas — energy, infrastructure, agriculture, manufacturing, and IT — will total at least $50 billion. Such a pooling of funds may help to overcome individual investors’ concerns with regard to the security situation and speed up activity while the armed conflict continues. While we expect the private sector to play a critical role in financing the reconstruction of Ukraine, governments will need to provide the necessary institutional support. Attracting investors while the war drags on will also require creative solutions such as cooperation with other countries.\n\n2.6.4 Russian assets and reparations\n\nInternational sanctions on foreign assets of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) were one of the most impactful early steps taken to restrict Russia’s ability to use its sizable macroeconomic buffers to manage its economy in a post-sanctions world. Shortly after the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s allies imposed sanctions on assets held in their jurisdictions. We estimate, based on information on their pre-February 24, 2022, geographical distribution, that this step has immobilized CBR reserves of ~$30 billion.\n\nWith its tenth sanctions package, the EU significantly expanded reporting requirements with regard to such funds and subsequently identified immobilized CBR reserves of $223.7 billion in EU member countries. According to a statement by the Belgian government, we know that more than 85% of this total — $191 billion — is held by Brussels-based Euroclear, one of the world’s largest central securities depositories. In addition to CBR reserves, an approximate $66 billion in private Russian assets are estimated to be frozen or immobilized.\n\nIf and how to use these $376 billion to finance Ukrainian reconstruction has become a topic of much interest — and contention — concerning the logistics, legality, and broader implications of accessing these funds. These will be discussed in detail later in this report.\n\nTo be clear, funding for Ukraine’s reconstruction could also come from Russian reparations. However, we believe that — barring any fundamental political changes in Russia — this is unlikely to happen in the near/medium term and cannot be the basis of any recovery planning. Should Russia’s position on such issues change substantially, we also believe that use of the country’s foreign assets, including those of the CBR, would be the most realistic approach. These assets have been largely written off by the current Russian government. In addition, the broader Russian population does not have a direct stake in — or understanding of — CBR reserves, especially in alternative strategies to generate additional revenues for reparations, e.g., higher taxes. Should a new political force that condemns the war come to power in Russia, it might find it more politically expedient to compromise on the use of immobilized assets.\n\n3. Ukrainian Resilience and Reform\n\nThe resilience of the Ukrainian state in the face of Russia’s invasion is remarkable — but it is neither a surprise nor an accident. In the years since the 2014 Revolution of Dignity, Ukraine has pursued a steady program of reform, including successful efforts to digitize and streamline public administration and service delivery, decentralize administrative and political authority, boost the independence and responsiveness of the judiciary, and reduce graft and corruption. The result is that the state continued to function on all levels, provide vital services and coordinate emergency response, and enjoy the trust of its citizens.\n\nThe transformative effects of reconstruction and recovery, however, will require still further reform. Much of this will be technocratic in nature, not least the demands of adopting and adapting to the EU’s full body of laws and regulations as the country pursues membership in the Common Market. Not all of Ukraine’s homework will be set by Brussels, however. Ukrainian citizens themselves will need to make decisions — and guide their elected officials accordingly — regarding the further path of public administration and decentralization, land reform, and judicial reform, all of which will shape the landscape into which Western governments and private enterprises will be investing. Ukraine will need to undertake further efforts, meanwhile, to continue changing the broader structure of its economy, including reducing the role of oligarchs and cementing gains on anti-corruption. None of this will be easy, and Ukraine has historically ranked low on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index. However, with this renewed push, described below, for reforms, all of this is achievable.\n\n3.1 Governance and Law\n\n3.1.1 Public administration and decentralization\n\nUkraine has initiated a broad spectrum of reforms since the Revolution of Dignity and the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU in 2014. These encompass police reform, anti-corruption measures, banking sector improvements, and land management modifications. Some of these reforms were successfully implemented before the commencement of Russia’s full-scale aggression in 2022. Furthermore, there has been significant progress in reforms pertaining to public administration and the decentralization of regional and local governance. Following Ukraine's attainment of EU candidate status in June 2022, the nation’s reform agenda has placed particular emphasis on achieving an independent judiciary, bolstering anti-corruption efforts, pursuing legal harmonization, and enhancing trade relations.\n\nAmidst the full-scale Russian invasion, there emerged an urgent need to modernize public administration, Ukrainian society, and the state as a whole. A weak and underdeveloped state is incapable of defending its sovereignty, population, and statehood in general. The modernization of public administration should be closely linked with the processes of restoration and modernization of industrial objects, ensuring energy security and the development of the military-industrial complex, the agricultural sector, and other sectors of the national economy.\n\nThe aim of modernizing public administration should be to achieve tangible shifts In the value orientations of Ukrainian society, significantly enhancing democratic and civic values for its citizens, ensuring the fair and efficient delivery of public services, and reinforcing the identity of the Ukrainian social fabric, especially during extraordinary circumstances related to war and the postwar reconstruction period. Currently, there is a profound demand from society and the business community for changes that will facilitate Ukraine’s prospect to full EU membership and the rapid and efficient implementation of European integration reforms. Ukraine has been presented with a unique opportunity to undergo a comprehensive transformation across all sectors, modernizing the country with the support of international partners.\n\nA positive case for the reform of state administration is decentralization, which needs to be continued in the context of postwar reconstruction of the country. The primary objective of the decentralization reform is to establish an efficient local self-government and territorial organization of power to create and maintain a holistic living environment for citizens, offer high-quality and accessible public services, foster institutions of direct democracy, and harmonize the interests of the state and territorial communities.\n\nIn line with the sustainable governance concept, the quality of governance hinges on executive capacity, including strategy, an evidence-based approach, and the quality of implementation, as well as executive accountability. For reforms to be truly transformative, they must substantially enhance the quality of governance.\n\nIn terms of augmenting executive capacity, the Ukrainian government, with EU support and the participation of other donors, has undertaken significant measures.\n\nThe Ukraine Reforms Architecture (URA) is a multiyear project backed by a multi-donor account and overseen by the EBRD since 2016. Its primary objective has been to enhance the capabilities of government institutions. This endeavor facilitated the establishment of the Reforms Delivery Office within the central government, which is responsible for orchestrating the development and execution of public administration reform. Moreover, it led to the formation of teams of change agents within ministries and central government agencies. New directorates with reform support personnel (RSP) were established within ministries, alongside reform support teams (RSTs) consisting of competitively selected consultants, integrated into ministries and some agencies. All professionals were recruited through transparent and competitive procedures, with salaries exceeding typical rates in the public sector.\n\nThe approach of embedding professionals within public administration rather than broadly improving its capacity had its limitations. Since the onset of full-scale Russian aggression in 2022, the Ukrainian government has shifted the focus of RSTs to ad hoc assignments, veering away from public administration reform. Some directorates that previously employed RSP have been closed or merged with departments dedicated to other responsibilities.\n\nThe Association4U project, initiated in 2019, aimed to strengthen the public administration’s capacity to formulate and implement essential reforms outlined in the Association Agreement and the Agreement on the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. Specific objectives included enhancing coordination and communication within public administration and improving knowledge and comprehension of EU standards. This project has been extended and remains ongoing, demonstrating improvements in coordination and capacity related to government functions closely linked to EU integration.\n\nIn terms of bolstering executive accountability, Ukraine has concentrated on introducing innovations and digital tools to enhance transparency within public administration and increase the accessibility of public services. Notable initiatives encompass the transparent public procurement tool, Prozorro; the e-governance tool and mobile app, Diia, which provides citizens with digital access to public services requiring electronic ID; and the recent DREAM project, jointly launched in 2023 by the Open Contracting Partnership and the Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine. DREAM envisions the integration of various registers and systems into a unified platform for Ukraine’s reconstruction, the development of analytical tools, and the infrastructure for utilizing open contracting data standards data. It also involves key stakeholders, including civil society and investigative journalists.\n\nAmbitious e-governance and digital services projects have become the hallmark of the Ukrainian government, often in partnership with civil society. According to some experts engaged in Ukraine’s reform efforts, the country’s civil society, and even parts of its public administration, are characterized by a “start-up mindset.” The private sector and select international donors have contributed to fostering innovation within the public sector.\n\nHowever, the quality of governance in Ukraine remains uneven and contingent on the institutions involved. Not all institutions have equally benefited from capacity-building projects. Local government entities in various regions may have limited policymaking capacity, which could impact their ability to implement recovery programs effectively.\n\nUkrainian civil society has played a pivotal role in driving reforms, advocating for a modern and dynamic public administration, transparency, and the fight against corruption.\n\n3.1.2 Land reform\n\nUkraine’s fertile soils, its agroecological conditions, and an extended vegetation cycle have traditionally positioned the agricultural sector as a pivotal component of the national economy. Ukraine holds a significant position in the context of global food security, given its contribution to international food markets upon which approximately 400 million individuals in various parts of the world depend. The country’s agro-industrial enterprises lead in the production and export of sunflower oil and cereals, including corn, wheat, and barley.\n\nEven amid the ongoing conflict, the agricultural sector continues to showcase substantial results, constituting 53% of export revenues and roughly 20% of the country’s GDP in 2022. Additionally, agribusiness provided employment for 17% of the national workforce in 2022.\n\nThe war has had a profound impact on the operations of the agricultural sector. According to the Center for Food and Land Use Research at KSE, indirect agricultural losses due to the conflict amount to $34.25 bn, with direct losses standing at $6.6 bn. Based on estimates from the All-Ukrainian Agricultural Council, it will take up to five years to restore certain subsectors of the agricultural sector. Simultaneously, the conflict underscores the urgency for continued reforms in the country, aiming to bolster its potential, including that of the agricultural domain.\n\nA key aspect of the further progression of the agricultural sector lies in the implementation of land reform. In the context of planning future policy in the realm of land relations, it is imperative to consider the repercussions of the military conflict on the agro-economic working conditions of farmers, agricultural holdings, family farms, and landowners. Hence, capital investments in land resources will become increasingly relevant for the sustainable recovery of the sector.\n\nAt present, the public discourse on land reform remains highly relevant. Proponents of the reform advocate for its implementation in accordance with Law 552-IX, adopted in 2020, which foresees the opening of the land market to legal entities starting from 2024. In contrast, opponents suggest postponing reform until Ukraine’s situation stabilizes. A matter of contention also lies in whether allowing foreigners access to the land market postwar, amidst post-conflict reconstruction, is prudent. The direction taken in resolving these land reform issues will determine the trajectory of Ukraine’s agricultural sector development and the postwar reconstruction strategy in the near term.\n\nIn Ukraine, over the two-year existence of the land market, from July 1, 2021, to July 1, 2023, only 1% of agricultural lands that were previously under a sales moratorium were sold. Contracts for the purchase or gift of 275,157 hectares of agricultural land were concluded. In total, 85,247 contracts for the purchase or gift of agricultural land plots have already been made in the market.\n\nIn 2022–23, with its limitation that agricultural land be purchased exclusively by Ukrainian citizens and prohibition on concentrating more than 100 hectares in one hand, the land market was, and remains, in a transitional phase before opening to legal entities from January 1, 2024. Therefore, the principal phase of land relations development in Ukraine can be anticipated only in the subsequent year.\n\nThe economic consequences of opening and operating the land market in the postwar period for Ukraine will depend, in particular, on land prices and transparent and equitable market conditions, as well as the ability to attract domestic and foreign investors. However, a key precondition for its effective functioning remains the conclusion of the war.\n\n3.1.3 Judicial reform\n\nThe summer of 2023 underscored that corruption within the judiciary is not a singular affliction confined to specific nations. In June, two countries occupying disparate positions on the anti-corruption spectrum — Ukraine and the United States — were shaken by controversies within the judiciary. While the recent US incidents with the Supreme Court and with US Senator Bob Mendez, were largely perceived as exceptional outliers, the Ukrainian episode spotlighted the pressing need for systemic reforms, despite decades of ongoing transformation efforts.\n\nNotwithstanding the scandal, Ukraine has made significant strides in its battle against corruption, merits that should not be overlooked. The Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) recently delisted Ukraine, acknowledging that it has “successfully implemented or is implementing to a satisfactory degree” 15 out of 31 recommendations, with an additional nine on track for compliance. This marks a notable contrast from 2019 when GRECO confirmed only five out of the 31 recommendations had been implemented. In its latest report, GRECO lauded Ukraine’s tenacious efforts, undertaken amidst a war for national survival, as “remarkable.”\n\nNevertheless, the enduring overhaul of Ukraine’s judiciary has not completely eradicated the root causes of corruption. These include, among others, (a) the presence of avenues for arbitrary judicial decisions, and (b) the transformation of the judiciary into a secluded corporate guild, instead of evolving into an open societal system dedicated to upholding the rule of law. The following sections will elaborate on these facets.\n\nAddressing the first issue necessitates a broader perspective on the national legal system’s fundamental role in ensuring legal and business environment stability and predictability. In this context, the judicial system is but one component of the larger equation. The need for a stable, lucid, and well-structured legislative framework remains paramount — a facet that transcends the judiciary’s domain. However, in addition to fulfilling its primary duty of guaranteeing predictability, a stable and lucid legislative framework minimizes the room for arbitrary judicial decisions — a critical factor facilitating corruption. With ongoing alignment of Ukrainian legislation with the EU’s acquis, improving and harmonizing Ukraine’s legislative landscape takes on heightened importance.\n\nAnother avenue to reduce the scope for arbitrary decisions by judges lies in the establishment of compulsory standardized law enforcement practices. While this mechanism exists within the judicial system, its efficacy depends on the stability of legislation. Dismissing claims that the Ukrainian legal system eschews court precedents, we can draw parallels with the trend of standardized legal interpretation seen in both the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. Without the development of standardized court interpretations — akin to (quasi-)precedent practices — various courts or even distinct chambers within the same court will continue to interpret identical laws disparately. This chaotic situation undoubtedly fosters opportunities for arbitrary decisions and, consequently, corruption.\n\nFrom an organizational perspective, the judiciary’s most pressing challenge lies in the influence wielded by oligarchs who, since the post-Soviet era, have instrumentalized it to safeguard their assets and sustain their business empires. The Ukrainian Supreme Court scandal, purportedly linked to bribery by Ukrainian oligarch Kostyantyn Zhevago, serves as a poignant example. Two central strategies for addressing this predicament involve bolstering self-governance among judges and subjecting the judiciary to greater scrutiny by civil society. Regrettably, the High Council of Justice, a pivotal self-governance institution, has faced operational difficulties since its formal establishment in January 2017. Its functions were only fully reactivated earlier this year. A similar situation befell the High Qualification Commission of Judges, another self-governance institution responsible for judicial body formation, judge transfers, and competence assurance.\n\nWhile judges unquestionably require independence, this should exclusively pertain to the administration of justice. All other decisions should undergo review and oversight by civil society. Otherwise, the judiciary risks transmuting into a closed, insular entity characterized by unwritten internal practices. Such a transformation could lead to the exploitation of self-governance institutions as instruments of nepotism and corporate or trade practices designed to protect narrow vested interests — instead of serving the rule of law for the greater societal good. Ukraine has already displayed signs of this transformation, contributing to the 2017 relaunch of the High Council of Justice. Consequently, a palpable demand exists in Ukraine for mechanisms enabling civil society to exert the greatest possible influence over the judiciary. This primarily involves reviewing all administrative, selection, appointment, and disciplinary decisions at all levels of the judiciary, particularly at its highest echelons.\n\n3.2 Broader Structural Reform\n\n3.2.1 De-oligarchization\n\nThe so-called oligarchs (business magnates who have created monopolies or oligopolies in many sectors of the economy, primarily in the metallurgical, chemical, and energy industries) have exerted significant influence on Ukrainian politics since the late 1990s.\n\nThe ambition to limit the oligarchs’ influence on political life in Ukraine, first articulated by then Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and his team in 2015, found expression in the law on preventing threats to national security involving the excessive influence of persons with significant economic and political weight in public life (the so-called Oligarch Act) from 2021. The law introduced the legal concept of an oligarch — a person who meets three out of four criteria: takes part in political life, has a significant influence on the media, owns companies that have a dominant position in the market, and has assets worth over $90 m. It is up to the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine to decide who meets these criteria. Persons marked as oligarchs are to be entered in a special register, forbidden from financing parties and candidates in elections, engaging in any demonstrations with political slogans, and participating in the privatization of state-owned assets. Registered oligarchs have to submit an annual asset declaration.\n\nThe law treated the issue with head-on measures limiting the access of specific individuals to party financing, media ownership, and other areas of potential influence. This approach has been criticized by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe for its focus on limiting the rights of individuals who have become too powerful as opposed to focusing on systemic safeguards that should prevent excessive and unfair influence of wealthy individuals on political and economic life. As the Venice Commission aptly put it, speaking also of similar laws adopted in Moldova, “This is the great paradox of de-oligarchization laws in the form they are currently proposed: If the administration and the judiciary are strong and independent enough to support the implementation of ‘personal measures’ of the kind described, then such measures are no longer needed because the preconditions are met to deploy a much more systemic and effective strategy. If conversely the administration and judiciary are ‘captured’ by the interests that the ‘personal measures’ intend to fight, then such measures are either ineffective or … profoundly dangerous for human rights, democracy and the rule of law.”\n\nThe informal intermediate assessment by the EU’s Enlargement Commissioner in summer 2023 and the opening of accession negotiations in December 2023, indicates that the European Commission expects Ukraine to address the shortcomings of its anti-oligarch legislation sooner rather than later.\n\nThe law on de-oligarchization adopted by the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, has had a direct impact on the media market. Some of the Ukrainian oligarchs either changed the status of the channels or got rid of some of their media businesses. While this has led to a reduction in direct oligarchic influence, it does not signify its complete eradication. The intertwining of business and power could still exist in Ukraine, manifesting through alternative channels. Political influence is orchestrated through media campaigns on social media and bloggers.\n\nAlso, it’s important to transform the national broadcast that merged all the Ukrainian channels (including commercial) into one broadcast at the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Some experts in Ukraine are convinced that it was not a fight against oligarchs, but the fight for control over mass media. And it ended with the victory of the government. While it may have seemed logical at the onset of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s primary objective now is to prevent the wartime and martial law restrictions from transforming into forms of political or media censorship. The EU opened accession negotiations with Ukraine in December 2023 and there are plans to launch a media market in Ukraine in the form of economically profitable projects.\n\n3.2.2 The future of anti-corruption efforts\n\nThe reinvigoration of Ukraine’s euro-integration efforts following the Revolution of Dignity has significantly bolstered anti-corruption reform. In 2014, the Verkhovna Rada passed the Law on the Fight Against Corruption, establishing the framework for a comprehensive anti-corruption mechanism. As of 2023, this mechanism encompasses:\n\nThe National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP): Founded in 2016 as a central executive body with special status, the NACP plays a pivotal role. Its functions include, among others, developing the Anti-Corruption Strategy and State Program (the current one spanning more than 1,700 measures across 15 policy areas), identifying corrupt provisions in legislation, managing the asset declaration system to monitor public servants' activities and lifestyles, overseeing political party financing compliance, and safeguarding whistleblowers.\n\nThe National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU): Established in 2014 at the behest of the IMF and the European Commission, NABU serves as a state law enforcement agency with special status. It is responsible for investigating high-level corruption cases and preparing them for prosecution by the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO). Under the leadership of the inaugural director, Artem Sytnyk (2014–22), NABU prosecuted 1,082 individuals, yielding an economic impact exceeding $190 m. Under its new director, Semen Kryvonos, NABU continued its efforts, initiating 48 investigations in 2022 alone.\n\nThe Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO): Operating as an independent unit within the General Prosecutor’s Office, SAPO oversees the compliance of laws during NABU’s pre-trial investigations and represents cases in court. As of early 2022, SAPO prosecutors had directed 368 indictments against 694 individuals for trial.\n\nThe High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC): Established in 2019, the HACC is a specialized judicial body with nationwide jurisdiction over high-level corruption cases. Comprising 38 judges, it began its operations on September 5, 2019. The HACC’s independence is ensured through an innovative candidate selection process, which includes the Public Council of International Experts. This council, consisting of six foreigners recommended by international organizations with agreements on anti-corruption initiatives, assesses HACC candidates based on their income and asset declarations, memos from NABU, and more. As of 2023, the HACC has issued rulings in 120 cases, including 14 acquittals, with 11 rulings overturned by the HACC Appeal Chamber and three by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn addition to these entities, the anti-corruption architecture features the Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA), established in 2015. ARMA’s focus is on locating, tracing, and managing assets derived from corruption and other crimes. It can either sell confiscated assets or transfer seized assets to a legal entity for a limited time, with income generated transferred to the state budget. In 2022, ARMA transferred assets amounting to $1.5 bn, with the state receiving approximately $800,000 from asset sales, some of which was invested in military bonds.\n\nThe roster of contributors to the anti-corruption endeavor extends further, encompassing the State Investigation Bureau, national police, General Prosecutor's Office, the National Anti-corruption Policy Council at the President of Ukraine (with limited impact), parliament’s Committee on Anti-Corruption Policy, the Temporary Special Commission of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on Investors’ Rights Protection, the Anti-Monopoly Committee, and others. Notably, the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) is no longer involved in investigating economic crimes and corruption following SSU reform.\n\nAnti-corruption agencies, public law organizations, state companies, private companies with more than 50% state ownership, and companies participating in state tenders exceeding approximately $550,000 must establish protected anonymous channels for whistleblowers’ reports. Protective measures for whistleblowers include anonymity, safety of the reporting person and their family, free legal aid, psychological support, and a reward in some cases up to 3,000 times the minimum wage.\n\nDigitalization plays a crucial role in anti-corruption efforts. The 2016 Law on Public Procurement ensured a large-scale shift to the new electronic procurement system, Prozorro. The 2020 amendments foresaw professionalization of procurement by switching from tender committees to authorized persons, the improvement of the appeal mechanism, the simplification of procurement procedures, and the expansion of liability for violations.\n\nProzorro serves as an online platform where public and utility entities announce tenders for goods, works, and services, fostering competition among businesses. Transparency is a hallmark, with nearly 2 million competitive bids and 150,000 competitors recorded in the Prozorro system over the past seven years. Electronic procurement ensures an automatic exchange of information with the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Individual Entrepreneurs and Public Organizations, the State Register of Medical Products, the State Tax Service of Ukraine, the State Treasury Service of Ukraine, and the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption. Amendments to Resolution No. 1275 have returned all non-weapon-related defense purchases to the Prozorro system, aligning it with World Bank recommendations to accommodate donor needs in Ukraine’s reconstruction.\n\nProzorro also empowers citizens to extract value from open data related to public funds usage, enhancing accountability of public authorities. Citizens can also report corruption through Diia, established as a Unified State Web Portal of Electronic Services and by the Unified State Portal of Administrative Services. Minimizing bureaucracy, Diia adheres to the “State in a Smartphone” principle.\n\nGovernment procurement-related cases may be reviewed not only in court but by the Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine. Complaints may also be filed to Ukraine’s Business Ombudsman Council, an entity supported by the EBRD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and multiple business associations, including the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine.\n\nAnother important aspect of anti-corruption efforts is oversight of political party finances and the expenditures of politically exposed persons. As nonprofit organizations, political parties are funded through contributions and may also receive state financing for campaigning. Parties’ finances are subject to investigation by the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption. In accordance with the Law on the Prevention of Threats to National Security Related to the Excessive Influence of Persons of Significant Economic and Political Weight in Public Life (the Law on Oligarchs), oligarchs are banned from financing political parties or individual candidates (except contributions to their own election funds).\n\nBefore Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine ranked among the top 30 countries in the Global Open Data Index. Apart from state agencies and e-instruments, civic activism and investigative journalism are playing an important role in counteracting corruption. Ukraine’s ranking on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index has improved from 142 in 2014 to 116 in 2022.\n\nDespite these achievements, visible results in the functioning of the anti-corruption mechanism do not overshadow existing challenges. Key considerations include:\n\nLeadership and member selection and appointment issues faced by newly established agencies, such as the delayed appointment of NABU’s head and the prolonged absence of a head for the Anti-corruption Prosecutor’s Office. Ensuring transparent and timely compliance with procedures is crucial and should be a condition for international support agreements.\n\nCapacity-building initiatives and development are needed across all anti-corruption agencies. For example, increasing the number of NABU employees and establishing regional branches could enhance capacity, communication with whistleblowers, and efficiency. Technical solutions for wiretapping without SSU assistance should be pursued.\n\nVigilance against attacks on anti-corruption agencies and attempts to limit their powers, including judicial reforms, is essential for success.\n\nIn the context of public procurement, ensuring mandatory use of Prozorro by fund-managing institutions, systemic monitoring of funds allocated for reconstruction, and transparent mechanisms for auditing international aid to recovery are vital.\n\nExpanding digital instruments, like the eCase Management System for NABU and SAPO, is essential.\n\nStrengthening the oversight of ARMA and improving the management of seized property are critical.\n\nLegislative adjustments are needed to enable the use of corporate rights tied to seized Russian assets to contribute to Ukraine’s state budget.\n\nContinuing legislative development related to money laundering, virtual assets, and financial institution client identification is essential.\n\nConsideration should be given to increased funding for civil society and journalistic initiatives focused on corruption disclosure and public funds monitoring.\n\n3.2.3 Preparing for EU accession\n\nIn 2023, a record 81% of Ukrainians were in favor of joining the EU. The ambition of Ukraine’s leadership and society to become part of the EU as quickly as possible is linked to a vision of the future to inspire the nation at a time of war, but also a serious commitment since the Revolution of Dignity in 2014.\n\nUkraine’s actual EU accession is conditional on clearing a number of hurdles, in the following order:\n\nCompliance with pre-accession recommendations formulated by the European Commission\n\nAchieving political consensus in the EU about opening accession negotiations\n\nSuccessfully completing every chapter of the accession process covering all accession criteria\n\nAchieving political consensus in the EU about the next enlargement and Ukraine’s place in it\n\nAs summarized by Laure Delcour and Kataryna Wolczuk, “[I]n the current context, one challenge stands out: how to balance the geopolitical imperative of Ukraine’s membership against its readiness for membership and the EU’s merit-driven demands of applicant states against the (lingering) reluctance of many member states to Ukraine’s accession.”\n\nIn terms of fulfilling accession criteria, some serious challenges remain to be addressed, especially regarding the rule of law principle, in both the judiciary and the executive. The decision to apply for EU membership after Russia launched its full-scale aggression on Ukraine has meant that rather than wait until the end of war, these challenges have to be addressed before December 2023. The EU noticed that Ukraine has taken considerable steps towards meeting the criteria and as of, December 14, 2023, the EU opened accession negotiations with Ukraine.\n\nCrucial areas for institutional and legal improvement were named in the list of seven steps stipulated in the European Commission’s opinion for Ukraine (summer 2022) before assessing whether it is ready to start accession talks. The seven steps include (1) reform of the Constitutional Court; (2) the integrity vetting of the candidates for the High Council of Justice and the selection of candidates to establish the High Qualification Commission of Judges of Ukraine; (3) strengthening the fight against corruption at high levels, with concrete results, and completing the appointment of a new head of the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office; (4) anti-money laundering and law enforcement sector reform; (5) limiting the excessive influence of oligarchs in economic, political, and public life; (6) aligning Ukraine's legislation with the EU audiovisual media services directive; and (7) finalizing reform of the legal framework for national minorities and adopting implementation mechanisms.\n\nSignificant progress has been made since these points were formulated. The EU noted that Ukraine has made substantial progress towards meeting these objectives, specifically on rule of law, judicial and administrative reform. However, more work needs to be done to “strengthen its anti-corruption institutions and improve its track record on investigations and convictions, including on high-level cases.”\n\nThis concerns especially the legal framework to address the influence of oligarchs and the legislation on national minorities. Another area where more progress is expected by the EU is on the anti-money laundering legislation and institutions.\n\nIn June, the Venice Commission published its assessment of the Ukrainian Law on National Minorities, finding that it still falls short of meeting 2017 recommendations on the reform of minority education. This point may be taken up by Ukraine’s next-door neighbors in the EU, Hungary and Romania, who take active interest in minorities speaking their language in Ukraine, so it is highly important to address this issue in time for accession talks decision. Similarly, the Venice Commission’s opinion, as noted above, seeks a more systemic and less personal approach to limiting the influence of oligarchs.\n\nOverall, however, the informal opinion of the European Commission in summer 2023 indicates that Ukraine is on track to open accession negotiations, provided that the abovementioned points have been addressed, and that the political will to support Ukraine’s European perspective is maintained by EU member states.\n\nFurther stages of the accession process will involve not only a massive effort on Ukraine’s part, meeting Copenhagen criteria, developed for previous EU enlargement, and working on legal approximation, but also the process of political consensus seeking in the EU. At the moment, at least two of the more influential large member states in the EU — Germany and France — indicate that there has to be a reform of EU institutions in the near future, ideally before enlargement can happen. A group of member states, including Poland, the Baltics, and the Nordics, is skeptical about any reform to the founding EU Treaty. This issue is unlikely to be resolved quickly. This is the reason some experts believe the EU needs a compromise on intermediate goals of the accession process for Ukraine and other candidates, such as staged accession (gradual access to the benefits of membership) or access to the four freedoms — the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people — if a sufficient number of accession criteria are met. This would allow Ukraine to enjoy some of the key benefits of membership, including access to the market for goods and services, before it is fully a member of the EU. Ukraine wants and needs access to the EU single market. Accession can come in due time — the single market will give Ukraine most of what it wants and be a huge boost to investment, trade, and private sector activity more generally.\n\n4. Political Challenges for the West\n\nFor Ukraine’s victory to be complete, Western support will need to extend beyond the eventual end of the fighting. Containing Russia, securing the future of the European project, and reestablishing global political and economic stability requires more than simply ejecting Russian troops from Ukrainian land and restoring Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity: it requires Ukraine being made politically and economically whole as well, its losses compensated, and justice done.\n\nThe political challenges to carrying through on the promise of Ukrainian recovery and reconstruction are daunting. For Europe, the political commitment to Ukrainian accession will be meaningless if EU member states and the European Commission cannot reform the way the EU makes decisions and distributes money. On the other side of the Atlantic, partisanship and increasing pessimism threaten to undermine mid- and long-term support for investing in Ukraine’s future — a major threat, given Washington’s minimal commitments to postwar recovery thus far. And policymakers throughout the community of nations supporting Ukraine will need to reach a political consensus on whether and how to access the $320 bn in frozen Russian sovereign assets, which could account for a third to half of Ukraine’s eventual recovery costs and may, in the absence of regime change in Moscow, be the surest route to reparations.\n\n4.1 Making EU Enlargement\n\n4.1.1 The task for"
