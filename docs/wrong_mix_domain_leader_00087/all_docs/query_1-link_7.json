        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nAs we reported earlier, critical aid to Ukraine is still being held up in ongoing negotiations over funding for border security.\n\nEarlier today, I spoke with former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen about what this means as Russia's war in Ukraine enters its third year.\n\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the \"NewsHour.\"\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nSo I want to ask you about U.S. lawmakers' inability so far to reach a deal on immigration that would allow Ukraine aid to move forward.\n\nYou have said previously you would advise Democrats to accommodate Republicans on the border, cut a deal, get the aid flowing. I know you're meeting with House Freedom Caucus members tomorrow. What's your advice to them?\n\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen:\n\nMy advice would be to do what it takes to ensure that Ukraine wins the war against Russia, because it is detrimental for the U.S. national security interests if Russia wins this war.\n\nWe cannot allow Putin any success in Ukraine.\n\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen:\n\nBecause I have seen that the fact that he is around, the fact that he probably will be nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, already, that has changed the way international actors, they take decisions.\n\nThey try to hedge their bets. And, in Europe, for instance, there is a great concern that a new administration might be more inward-looking, more isolationist, that they will leave Europe behind. I don't think that would be in the interest of the United States to weaken its alliance across the Atlantic.\n\nOn the contrary, we should strengthen the transatlantic alliance.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nCan I ask you about what we have seen in the U.S. public, though, which is some decline in support for continuing the same level of U.S. funding for Ukraine, and specifically this idea that European nations should be doing more?\n\nShould Europe be bearing more of the security burden, especially when it comes to Ukraine?\n\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen:\n\nWe are not — yes, we are not speaking about pledges. We are speaking about real money.\n\nWhen it comes to the military, according to those figures, Europe has contributed 54 billion euros, the U.S. 44 billion euros. I appreciate that the Europeans contribute more. They should — we should do so. But it cannot replace a continued U.S. assistance. We need both. We need sophisticated weapons delivered by the United States, and we need more weapons.\n\nWe need to lift all self-imposed restrictions on weapon deliveries to Ukraine. So the mantra that we will help Ukraine for as long as it takes, it should be replaced with, we will give to Ukraine all it takes to win the war.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nThere's been a lot of criticism that, had the U.S. and NATO allies done that sooner, the war might have been over by now, Ukraine would be in a different position. It took 300 days into the war for the U.S., for example, to provide long-range missiles President Zelenskyy had been asking for.\n\nWas that a mistake?\n\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen:\n\nYes, it's really — I mean, it's a sad story to see our hesitation. And the reason why the Ukrainian counteroffensive has been so difficult and so modest is that we took much too long time to take necessary decisions.\n\nYou cannot win a war by an incremental, step-by-step approach. You have to overwhelm and surprise your adversary. We failed to do that.\n\nAmna Nawaz:\n\nCan I ask what impact the Israel-Hamas war has had on all of this? I mean, there's been the argument that the U.S. and the world cannot equally provide support to two ongoing wars.\n\nAnd the idea that Putin banked on the West losing interest or being distracted seems to be now coming true. What's — what have you seen to be the impact of that war?\n\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen:\n\nWell, we have seen how Putin has exploited the situation.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Israeli-Hamas war, we have seen an intensified Russian offensive against Ukraine. A swarm of drones have hit civilian targets, civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. So, no doubt that the war between Israel and Hamas serves the interest of Putin.\n\nAnd, overall, what you are seeing is an emerging — what I would call an emerging axis of autocracies, led by China, but joined by Russia, Iran, North Korea. And this is exactly what is at stake. We have to counter this axis of autocracies. And we should never forget that the world's democracies represent more than 60 percent of the global economy, of the global GDP.\n\nSo, if we stand together, if we cooperate, then it will represent a formidable force that will create a lot of respect in Beijing."
