After briefly dabbling in radical politics he emigrated to the United States in 1919 and became a Science Fiction illustrator. After gaining fluency in English he became also an editor and author - eventually becoming known as a major writer of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. He wrote Lord of the Swastika, his final science fantasy novel, in six weeks in 1953, shortly before dying of cerebral hemorrhage[8] (possibly caused by tertiary syphilis). Lord of the Swastika subsequently won the Hugo Award and the \"colorful uniforms\" described therein become a regular feature of cosplayers at science fiction conventions. The novel was praised as a major work of Heroic fantasy and for its \"haunting evocation of a Germany that never was\".\n\nWorks invented by Neal Stephenson[]\n\nIn Cryptonomicon and Quicksilver:\n\nThe Cryptonomicon\n\nIn Anathem :\n"
