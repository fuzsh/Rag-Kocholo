        "text": "Edward Norton is one of the most celebrated actors of his generation and has starred in, produced, written or directed over 30 films. He has been nominated for three Academy Awards and has won the Golden Globe, an Emmy, an Obie and numerous other awards for his performances and productions.\n\nHis most recent film is, Motherless Brooklyn, which he wrote, directed, produced and starred in. A meditation on hidden power and the threat of autocracy in America, filmmaker and historian Ken Burns wrote that the film is “nothing less than a modern masterpiece.”\n\nNorton has a substantial parallel career as an entrepreneur, investor and activist in both environmental sustainability and technology ventures.\n\nHe currently serves as the United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for Biodiversity and for nearly 20 years he has served as the Board chair of the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust, a community-based organization working to preserve the endangered wildlife and threatened forest ecosystems in Kenya’s iconic southern rangelands. MWCT’s work to develop an innovative portfolio of sustainable, natural capital-based revenue streams for Maasai communities has been awarded both the UNDP Equator Prize and the UNEP Champions of the Earth Prize. Norton seeded MWCT’s effort to build the Chyulu Hills Carbon project and has led the effort by the project to build a consortium of corporate partners buying offset credits for a market redefining $15/ton.\n\nHe also served on the Boards of: Conservation International, Friends of the High Line, Signature Theatre Company, Enterprise Community Partners and Harlem Grown."
