Soon, Popper quit his job, moved to a smaller house*, and launched his own firm, SciFutures....\n\n'One of SciFutures’s more prominent contributors is Ken Liu, a Hugo Award-winning author and the translator of the popular Chinese science-fiction novel “The Three-Body Problem.” Liu told me that he relishes the level of influence that the firm offers. “As a freelancing gig, it’s not much money,” he said; typically, stories pay a few hundred dollars. “But you have the chance to shape and impact the development of a technology that matters to you.

Of people who read books, one in five read a romance.

Now some of its most successful writers just want their books back. Interesting how substantial a part of book sales romance sales are, and that there are enough \"spanking\" novels to be a sub-genre. Lots of lessons here about what to be wary about in this new world of hybrid publishing--about the many ways a dishonest hybrid publisher can be dishonest (both with authors and with who they sell and ship books to).\n\nFor example: \"To keep pumping out new releases, Ms. Wills padded inventory by taking older books and repacking them with new covers, sometimes under a different title and pen name, according to several former employees.\" She also never copyrighted the many books she issued, which had major legal repurcussions and allowed her to pirate her own authors' books. \"Writers who really want to get published are so easy to take advantage of, and there are more and more people out there to take advantage of,\" said Mary Rasenberger, chief executive of the Authors Guild. Margaret Huth (aka Anya Summers), who launched Blushing Books, has ripped off romance writers in a variety of ways.\n\n'The enormous appetite for romance and erotica, a nearly $1.5 billion industry, has stoked a feeding frenzy among publishers for new content. Romance sales exploded in the past 15 years, following the rise of e-books and self-publishing, and the commercial and cultural juggernaut “Fifty Shades of Grey,” which brought hard-core erotica from the fringes into the mainstream....Often romance novels attract writers, mostly women, who have little professional publishing experience and aren’t represented by lawyers or agents who can help them evaluate a contract.\n\n• Everything and Less’ Review: Fiction in Prime Time (Sam Sacks, Wall Street Journal, 9-5-21)\n\n‘Amazon has transformed the way we read books—and, according to Mark McGurl, how they’re written.\"Most literary studies focus their insights on the writers they consider the best, or the most significant artistically. But Amazon, being primarily a retail platform, doesn’t care about the content of books, only about how they sell and to whom. So under its hegemony the books suddenly elevated in stature belong to the traditionally “down-market sub-basement” commercial genres....\n\n‘ “In the Age of Amazon, all fiction is genre fiction. Dividing contemporary literature into a vast array of searchable genre categories, each with its own best-seller list, Amazon is the host of a genre system conceived as an engine of infinitely infoliating permutations of objects of narrative desire.” The most popular of those categories are post-apocalyptic fantasy sagas and romance novels, and Mr.McGurl devotes interpretive space to exemplars from each: Hugh Howey’s “Wool” series and E.L. James’s “Fifty Shades of Grey” trilogy. These books are also notable for having been originally self-published, and it is through Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing platform that the company has shown its true service-oriented ethos. Here writers can target increasingly niche customer wishes, and Mr.McGurl has a funny chapter on the explosion of fetish lit, like Adult Baby Diaper Lover erotica, “the quintessential Amazonian genre of literature.” ’\n\n• Stacey Abrams has written 8 romance novels. Now her fellow authors are raising money for Georgia Democrats. (Alexandra Alter, NY Times 12-2-2020) A group of romance novelists launched “Romancing the Runoff” to mobilize Democratic voters in Georgia. 'They were inspired by Ms. Abrams’s efforts to flip Georgia for Democrats even after she lost her own campaign for governor, a show of optimism that Ms. Milan said typified romance readers’ belief in “happily ever after” endings.'\n\n[Back to Top]\n\n• Nobody Knows Marketing Like Romance Authors: Q&A with Kitty Thomas (Kristen Tsetsi on Jane Friedman's blog, 11-29-22) Insights authors of all types can learn from.\n\n• Meet the Paranormal Romance Guild authors\n\n• Romantic fiction writers creating a more diverse happily ever after (Aamna Mohdin, The Guardian, 12-30-21) A lighthearted romantic comedy by Talia Hibbert follows the escapades of a young black British woman who crashes into the life of an uptight B&B owner. Hibbert did not expect readers outside her established fanbase to be interested in the book, but it reached a much bigger audience, thanks in part to large book-loving communities on Instagram, YouTube and, most importantly, TikTok. These communities, known as Booksgram, BookTube, and Booktok, are not just spaces for people to share their passion for whatever they're reading. They also have huge marketing power, driving books such as Hibbert’s up the bestseller charts and reshaping the publishing world. Book-loving communities on social media are helping authors break barriers to become bestsellers.\n\n• The Clinch (Katie Mingle, 99%Invisible) What makes a book about love a Romance? After Producer Katie Mingle’s mom wrote a romance novel, Katie set out to understand the romance genre and its classic covers. The happily ever after (or HEA if you wanna sound in-the-know) has always been a distinguishing feature of the genre. Sarah MacLean believes the modern era of romance can be traced back to the early 1970s and a self-described Midwestern housewife named Kathleen Woodiwiss. Woodiwiss looked at the adventure novels her husband was reading and asked herself: where are the ones with leading women, told from a female point of view? An interesting mini-history of changes in romance book covers.\n\n• World's oldest romantic novelist, who has worked under 10 different pseudonyms, is still writing racy bodice-rippers aged 105 (Deborah Arthurs, Daily Mail, 4-29-13) In 1956 alone Ida Pollock had eight romances published under five pen names - each around 70,000 words long and all finishing with a happy ending. It took her about six weeks to write a novel.\n\n• How much can you make writing romance? (Gina Nicoll, Book Riot, 10-8-21) In a survey, academic Christine Larson collected data from 4,270 romance writers, found through the Romance Writers of America. The median income reported was $5,828 in 2009, which increased to $10,100 in 2014. All income growth came from “‘hybrid’ authors,” or those who did both traditional and self-publishing. The percentage of romance writers who were able to make writing romance their full-time job also grew, rising from 39% in 2009 to 45% in 2014. With self-publishing, the royalties may be much, much higher—but so can potential expenses (including the cost of covers and editing). Another key difference between traditional and self-publishing is the level of gatekeeping. Not just anyone can land a publishing deal and there is both gender bias and color bias in romance publishing.\n\n[Back to Top]\n\n• Racism Dispute Roils Romance Writers Group (Concepción de León, NY Times, 12-30-19) Eight board members and the former president of the organization have resigned amid outcry over how it handled a member’s criticism of another member’s book. Some of the backlash was from writers and members who felt that the dispute wasn’t handled with enough transparency. See also Letter to board explaining why members are outraged at the board's handling of an issue: \"This board and the staff of RWA misused the policies and procedures of this organization to punish a woman of color who has done nothing but stand up for those that RWA has historically kept out and mistreated.

First came a push for diverse books, then one for “own voices” books. In other words, it wasn’t enough for white women to add African American characters, or for straight women to write m/m romance for an audience dominated by straight women. The genre needed to actively work to support queer authors and authors of color themselves.\"\n\n• Worse Than a Dumpster Fire (Sarah, Smart Bitches, Trashy Books, 8-4-21) \"RWA’s membership has demonstrated yet again that it can’t be trusted to administer an award that won’t cause harm. This isn’t surprising but holy damn is it demoralizing to see how little has changed..\" RWA plunges further into its nosedive. Many RWA members, fed up with RWA leadership, plan to start a romance novelist chapter in the Authors Guild.\n\n\"When the finalists for the newly-renamed award, the Vivian, were announced this year, one book in the Religious or Spiritual Elements category (which really means evangelical Christian, let’s be real) featured a hero who participated in the genocide against the Lakota at Wounded Knee. So all the changes and the renaming and the rewriting of the structure and the rubric and all the significant work that goes into hosting and managing an award yielded the same result as in prior years: racist, White supremacist narratives are lauded, whether the hero is a Nazi or a murderer of Indigenous Americans....Then the president of RWA released a statement that romance with religious or spiritual elements: requires a redemptive arc as a genre convention.

(Lynn Spencer, All About Romance, 12-27-19) A clear account of how Romance Writers of America imploded -- a story of racism, nondiversity, and strangely nontransparent handling of a complaint one writer made about another. To begin with, a writer named Courtney Milan tweeted about a 1999 novel by Kathryn Lynn Davis that contained what she and many others would describe as fairly egregious stereotyping...\"she called the book out as problematic and racist.\" From there on, a failure to transparently address the problem led to the resignation of several board members, and general disgrace for the organization -- for confining black romance writers to all-black lines, shelved apart from white romance novels, among other egregious practices.\n\n• Fifty shades of white: the long fight against racism in romance novels (Lois Beckett, The Guardian, 4-4-19) For decades, the world of romantic fiction has been divided by a heated debate about racism and diversity.

Adult Science Fiction & Fantasy titles are not too far behind. In general, the strongest indicator for how fast sales in a particular book genre will transition to online retailers and digital formats is typical reader “voracity” in that genre. A three-book-a-year reader is usually picking up their three books in hardcover in airports or brick-and-mortar bookstores (or receiving them as holiday gifts). But most fifty-book-a-year genre fiction readers are, by now, buying those books online, and most probably as ebooks—which usually means that half or more of them are self-published purchases.\"\n\n• Stability in the book marketplace does not mean commercial publishers continue to maintain their share (Mike Shatzkin, Shatzkin Files, 12-12-17) \"Kindle is taking market share from all the other ebook platforms (except possibly Apple iBooks, at the moment).

Giving advice to a new romance novelist whose heroine (in a passionless marriage of convenience, her husband away at war) is attracted to a neighbor, Barbara Longley wrote: \"You need to know a few things about romance as a genre. First and foremost, the focus of the story must be centered upon the couple and the obstacles and conflict they face before they reach their HEA, happily-ever-after. The most important aspect of romance is the HEA. The guaranteed HEA is what makes a story a \"romance\" novel. What you've described sounds more like women's fiction with romantic elements. It's also unclear what the actual conflict is in your brief description, and who the heroine's love interest ends up being. If she's married and remains faithful despite an attraction, where's the \"story?\" What is so urgent and captivating about a woman doing the right thing? If the primary conflict is resisting temptation, and she ends up with her her husband in a relationship devoid of passion, who isn't even in the picture during the actual story ... it's not a romance.~ Barbara Longley, who writes Celtic Fantasy and Contemporary Romance.\n\n• Is your novel romantic, steamy, or erotic?

They are not the same thing. Romance novels focus on the relationship between two (or more) people as they fall in love. Other things can frame the story, but the plot has to hinge on the romantic relationship. They also end either happily-ever-after or at least, happy-for-now. Love stories, though, can focus on the dark side of love, and can end unhappily ever after, if that's what the story calls for. Also, many of these books would still have a plot if the romance is taken out. That keeps it from being a romance. So if you're not into romance novels, but would like to read something about love, here's a list of love stories, where the romantic relationship was not the focus or ended unhappily ever after. Many of the books on this list are classics, and epic stories at that. Several are character studies, and several are ensemble casts.\"\n\n• Apple Now (Randomly?)

Sometimes, that takes the form of the author adding more than one book or story to the file, adding greater paragraph spaces to make the book seem longer, or listing one book for sale - complete with appropriate cover - then compiling them together as a ‘collection’. Amazon have been trying to rectify this problem for a while, including changing their terms of use for authors who are part of the Kindle Unlimited system, but little has changed, and the authors involved have only gotten more obvious in their desire to scam the system....Amazon are perfectly aware of their market domination, hence the way they pay authors via the Kindle Unlimited scheme. The program pays authors royalties for books borrowed not by the number of borrows but by the number of pages read....A book stuffer can dramatically change how much they earn a month by padding out their latest release with extra material, often going so far as adding 2500+ more pages than the advertising would suggest. According to Forbes, this has led to some authors earning around $100k a month....Another common tactic of book stuffing is miscategorising the novels [in less crowded fields] on Amazon....Essentially, book stuffing is its own large and highly profitable sub-industry in the world of publishing.\" Amazon doesn't police it because Amazon makes money from it.\n\n• Cassandra Dee and Mosaic Book Stuffing (David Gaughran, 6-10-18) A prime example of book stuffing. \"Cassandra Dee has taken a number of different approaches to book stuffing, from the regular approach of just shoving in as many books as it takes to hit that max 3000 page payout, to formatting hacks to artificially boost the page count, to a pretty popular approach today which I’ll call mosaic bookstuffing...The content ends at 24% of the book file.

(Savvy Book Writers, 7-21-12) Three authors filed a class action suit against Harlequin publishing, which belongs to TorStar Corp., a Canadian publishing company. Ann Voss Peterson wrote a book that Harlequin published, and she made 2.4% royalties per e-book copy sold. One of the reasons for this was: 'While most of my books are sold in the US, many are sold under lower royalty rates in other countries. In this particular contract, some foreign rights and – ALL e-book royalties – are figured in a way that artificially reduces net by licensing the book to a “related licensee,” in other words, a company owned by Harlequin itself. Here’s an example: Harlequin has an e-book it lists for $3.99. It sells that to Amazon at a wholesale price of $2.00. The author should make $1.00 for each $3.99 e-book that Amazon sells. But instead of selling directly to Amazon, Harlequin sells the e-book to Company X for 12 cents. So the author only gets 6 cents. Company X than sells the same e-book to Amazon for $2.00, but because they are a sub-licensing company, they don’t have to pay the author anything.\" (Quoting J.A.

You’re paying for your ego. That’s fine, dealer’s choice.

The purpose of consistency and correctness in any aspect of a book is to present a clean and professional product to the people destined to read it.\" Typos and irregularities distract readers from content, sometimes causing an editor to reject a book on the assumption that sloppy spelling means the author hasn't done a careful job in other ways also, or that getting the ms. into shape will cost too much in editing time.

They address feedback while holding to the vision (letting go of elements that don't work). They continually seek small refinements and improvements. In Playing Big: Practical Wisdom for Women Who Want to Speak Up, Create, and Lead, author Tara Mohr notes that it’s a stereotypically male thing to forge ahead with one’s big vision without seeking outside input on it, and a stereotypically female thing to seek feedback on one’s vision from any and everyone, whether or not their opinion actually matters.\n\n• Looking Homeward To Thomas Wolfe; An Uncut Version of His First Novel Is to Be Published on His Centenary (Dinitia Smith, NY Times, 10-2-2000) Wolfe's centenary, the University of South Carolina Press will publish ''O Lost: A Story of the Buried Life,'' a restored version of ''Look Homeward Angel,'' using Wolfe's original title.

Lippincott in 1957, her editor, Tay Hohoff, astutely saw the germ of a better book in the childhood passages and suggested Lee rewrite the novel from young Scout’s point of view, set 20 years earlier, during the Depression. Comparing “Mockingbird” — the result of two years of arduous revisions — with “Watchman” demonstrates clearly just how important a good editor can be. Put simply, where “Mockingbird” beguiles, dazzles and moves to tears as it conveys core values of empathy and human decency, “Watchman” horrifies with its ugly racism, even as it emotes and moralizes didactically, clunkily and shrilly.\" A review worth reading, which may make you curious about the early novel.\n\n• On Books: Visions and Revisions (Part II) (Alison Parker, An American Editor, 8-15-16).

Using exercises split between technical errors (spelling, grammar, punctuation, factual accuracy, and consistency) and debatable errors (aspects of usage, punctuation, and style for which preferences vary), Carolyn compared edits of fiction by several professional editors. The results \"showed a strong correlation between a high number of spelling, punctuation, and consistency errors and a low number of support tools used\": \"commercial software tools designed for editors (e.g., EditTools, Editor’s ToolKit, PerfectIt) or built into Word (e.g., find/replace, wildcard find/replace, macros).\"\n\n• The Subjectivity of Editing Fiction II (part 2) Carolyn shifts to areas where errors are harder to define and recognize, and individual backgrounds come more strongly into play (especially debatable errors, such as hyphenated or solid prefixes and suffixes; hyphenation of compound adjectives; one-word or two-word spellings that could vary according to dictionary; and use or not of the serial comma). In this comparison, she learns that editors who comment more often, tend to miss more mechanical errors.\n\n• The Subjectivity of Editing III (part 3) (Carolyn Haley, Thinking Fiction, An American Editor, 3-28-16). Carolyn gave brief editing samples from an early draft of an already published novel to seven different editors (\"a good way for authors to select the editor best suited to their work\"). Catches on technical errors (e.g., misspellings) and suggested edits to \"improve style\" varied greatly. Advice: \"Author, tell the editor what you’re looking for! Editor, tell the author what you intend to do! If your vocabularies and ideas differ, then dig a little deeper before working together.\" And give editors brief samples to edit before hiring.\n\n• The Subjectivity of Editing IV, Part I . In her second experiment, Carolyn Haley asked nine independent copyeditors of fiction for their definitions of copyediting. Their responses vary greatly.

For this story, Maria Hinojosa spoke to four people at the heart of the American Dirt controversy: Myriam Gurba —writer and author of Mean— who wrote an explosive critique of the novel; Cisneros, who speaks publicly about the book for the first time; Luis Alberto Urrea, a Mexican-American author who has written extensively about border life; and finally, Cummins, the author of American Dirt.\n\n• Why Everyone’s Talking About American Dirt (Rachelle Hampton, Slate, 1-21-2020) The American Dirt controversy, explained. The controversy about Jeanine Cummins’ novel encompasses appropriation, cries of silencing, and four separate New York Times stories. 'At first glance, the criticism of American Dirt reads as the increasingly pro forma conversation about who’s allowed to tell whose story. On one side are Mexican and Mexican American writers asking why Cummins felt the need to tell this story, other than to individuate a “faceless brown mass” that she’s not a part of—simultaneously raising the question of who exactly sees that mass as faceless and whether it’s worth writing for them. On the other side is Cummins raising a familiar alarm on how conversations around cultural appropriation will eventually morph into censorship. In a profile in the Times touching on the controversy, she said, “I do think that the conversation about cultural appropriation is incredibly important, but I also think that there is a danger sometimes of going too far toward silencing people.” ...The public debate began with a [scathing] review of American Dirt by Myriam Gurba published in Tropics of Meta, an academic blog that publishes essays on a broad range of topics. Gurba takes to task not only Cummins’ identity—she apparently identified as white as recently as four years ago, when she wrote in the New York Times that she wasn’t qualified to write about race—but also American Dirt’s similarity to other books about Mexico that Cummins used for research, as well as the novel’s ignorance of the very people the book purports to represent.'\n\n• ‘American Dirt’ is a novel about Mexicans by a writer who isn’t.

Hampton (above) observes that Gurba was 'originally assigned to review American Dirt by “an editor at a feminist magazine”—later revealed to be Ms. While her editor thought the review was “spectacular,” Gurba wrote, it was nonetheless killed because Gurba “lacked the fame to pen something so ‘negative.’ ”\n\n• What About Your Grandmother, Jeanine? (Aya de Leon, Guernica, 2-12-2020) With that large an advance, why didn't you hire a sensitivity reader, this Latinx writer asks Jeanine. Why didn't (don't) you go visit your grandmother?\n\n• Speak For Yourself!: Cultural (and Other) Appropriation in Writing and Publishing (Trenton Galozo, Pub800, TKBR Publishing, SFU, 10-2017) Literature, visual arts and music are chock full of cultural appropriation, from established literary classic novels like The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner, through fantasy and sci-fi, where the appropriation of culture is ubiquitous, from Picasso's motifs which originated in the work of African carvers through jazz and blues styles developed in the context of African-American culture and appropriated by non-members of the culture from Bix Beiderbecke to Eric Clapton.\n\n• Finding oneself at home (Caryl Phillips, The Guardian, 1-20-06) Both Angela Carter and Natsume Soseki found new insights into their respective homelands when living abroad.

Jawort, Los Angeles Review of Books, 10-5-19)\n\n• Woke Roald Dahl Will Put Kids to Sleep (Meghan Cox Gurdon, Wall Street Journal, 2-21-23) 'Sensitivity readers' are determined to make reading dull.\n\n'The Telegraph reports that Puffin functionaries and hired “sensitivity readers” have combed through Dahl’s works for children—including whizbang novels such as “Matilda,” “The Twits,” and “James and the Giant Peach”—and cut all references to fatness, craziness, ugliness, whiteness (even of bedsheets), blackness (even of tractors) and the great Rudyard Kipling, along with any allusion to acts lacking full and enthusiastic consent.'\n\n'The bowdlerizing of Dahl fits a broader trend in children's books. Everything is getting less specific, more didactic and more boring. Writers and illustrators, terrified of causing \"harm\" by failing to be \"inclusive\" and \"accessible,\" are sacrificing specificity, beauty and fun. Most new picture books deliver a lesson rather than risk telling a story, and they increasingly feature young protagonists of indeterminate sex rather than boys or girls.' <\n\n• Sterling HolyWhiteMountain on Blood Quantum, \"Native Art,\" and Cultural Appropriation (Sterling HolyWhiteMountain, interviewed by Matt Strohl for Aesthetics for Birds, 1-31-19) 'Blood quantum laws are based on beliefs developed in feudal Europe, when everything was about royal and peasant blood, and the idea of “blood” was used to consolidate power in the hands of the aristocracy. Those beliefs, which later became essential to eugenics and underpin the current iteration of white supremacy, were applied to indigenous people in the U.S. during the later treaty era, when the U.S. government was concerned about paying as little money to tribes as possible for these land transactions, if we can call them that. The simplest way to explain this is the government was only going to pay money according to the number of people who had enough “Indian blood” to qualify as being fully “Indian”. Later on, in the early- to mid- 1900s, many tribes adopted these laws as a method for identifying their tribal membership—a perfect example of how the colonized come to see themselves as the colonizer does....We get into trouble when we start using colonial systems of definition to solve our problems, because these systems were created in such a way as to be divisive, and this situation is no exception. To quote Richard White, “Americans invented Indians and forced Indians to live with the consequences of this invention.” ' A fascinating discussion and a long read, right down to Sterling HolyWhiteMountain's praise for the third season of David Lynch's Twin Peaks. \"...one of the primary purposes of art is to show us the things about ourselves we don’t want to see. Blood Meridian is one of the greatest examples of this kind; I’m not sure anyone has visited the shadowlands of humanity and come back with literature so aesthetically remarkable, beautiful and troubling. Art is really the only place we can go for that kind of complicated honesty. If there’s a social function for art, that’s it. So, from a certain point of view, no contemporary male artist in the U.S. is more against the horrors of misogyny than Lynch, exactly because he shows us how awful it is, and he’s unequivocal in that judgement.\n\n• Missteps lead publishing industry to review diversity effort (Hillel Italie, AP, 2-11-2020) As debate rages around “American Dirt,” the bestselling novel criticized for its portrait of Mexican life and culture, publishers are pledging to change a historically white industry as critics question whether it can truly transform.\n\n• Resources for Thinking About Diversity (Dilane Mitchell, ACES, 2-11-2020) Five books that can help the reader see the systemic inequalities that built our society and economy.\n\n• Diversity Activities Resource Guide and Other Resources (Dealing with Migration)\n\nCritiquing groups (and critiquing) for fiction\n\nSee also How, when, and why to use beta readers\n\nWriting groups\n\n• How to run a fiction critique group (Luanne Oleas on Writers and Editors, 12-28-22)\n\n• What’s a Writing Group Good for, Anyway?
