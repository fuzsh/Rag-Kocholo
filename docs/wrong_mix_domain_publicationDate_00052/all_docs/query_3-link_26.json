His fifth book, Motherless Brooklyn (Doubleday, 1999), a New York Times bestseller, won the National Book Critic’s Circle Award for Fiction and the Macallan Gold Dagger, among other accolades. Translated into over thirty languages, Lethem’s work has been collected in five volumes, including the World Fantasy Award-winning The Wall of the Sky, The Wall of the Eye (Harcourt, 1996). Several of his shorter works have been gathered in The Year’s Best Essays and The Best American Short Stories as well as other annual anthologies; his writing regularly appears in the New Yorker, Rolling Stone, Harper’s, Paris Review, and McSweeney’s. Lethem has received numerous distinctions, including the 2012 California Book Award, an honorary doctorate in Letters from the Pratt Institute (2011), and a 2005 MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. He has taught at Columbia University, New York University, and in 2011 was named to the Roy E. Disney Chair in Creative Writing at Pomona College."
