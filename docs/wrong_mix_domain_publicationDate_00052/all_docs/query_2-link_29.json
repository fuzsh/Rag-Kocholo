        "text": "T, he voice addressing you now, dear reader, is a fiction. Even speaking as \"Jonathan Lethem\", I'm nothing less chimerical than what English professors call an \"implied narrator\" – I can't help it. (You, for that matter, the implied recipient of my address, are a bit of a fiction too.) Sure, I hear you say, tell me something I don't know. Or, more likely: tell me something interesting. Fair enough. No one is obligated to care that writers sometimes, or often, think such self-conscious stuff. Indeed, there is a great deal of evidence that mention of these matters annoys the hell out of some readers, perhaps most.\n\nFor this reason – that of ducking the tomatoes audiences may want to hurl – many artists prefer to make statements along the lines of: \"I don't know what I'm doing, I just go into a small, badly furnished room and out come these stories/the songs write themselves/the paint tells me where it wants to go, and so on.\" Even readers with an appetite for the dynamic curlicues of intellection so typical of the prose of forthrightly self-conscious, ontology-obsessed writers (John Barth being a perfect example) can suddenly grow nauseated by a disproportion of the stuff over time (hence Barth's terrifying decline in popularity). David Foster Wallace deserves to be remembered as a great writer not because he was capable of doing PhD-level philosophical speculation as well as shunting fictional characters (slowly) through a well-described room, but because he mastered a certain area of human sensation: intricate self-conscious remorse at the fact of self-consciousness.\n\nWallace's way of loading up this indistinct area with scrupulous depiction made a lot of people feel less lonely; meanwhile, the possibility that being the depicter made Wallace feel more lonely has become a widely circulated armchair-shrink's allegory for the non-usefulness of self-consciousness. Because it doesn't help. Doesn't help the depressed person feel less depressed, doesn't help the storyteller tell the story. Just Do It! – the top-to-bottom scream of our culture. Never mind where that slippery slope might get you, or how the attitude shears toward the same anti-intellectual currents in contemporary life that would shovel reading novels per se into a trench, along with a lot of other things you hold dear, if you're still with me at this point. Confession: I think I'm an intellectual, and I think you are too, whether you like it or not. I can't help thinking so.\n\nAll of these thoughts fall into the category of things I can't help thinking, despite having sometimes tried not to, thinking it was my duty to do so. It turns out I can't help being the self-conscious kind of artist, one who pits himself compulsively against bogus valorising of notions of originality, authenticity, or naturalism in the arts. This is where a certain political implication comes out of hiding, and it's a political implication very dear to me. For, if we agree that what appears natural in art is actually constructed from a series of hidden postures, decisions and influences, etc, we must surely have to weigh the notion that what's taken as natural in our experience of everyday life could actually be a construction as well.\n\nThat's to say, if we pass time getting dreamy by reading stories about things that didn't really happen, set in worlds that aren't precisely our own, while acknowledging that such self-into-elsewhere dreams are enacted by conscious means, by acts of intention and craft (on the part of the readers as well as by the writers), it might suggest an analogous getting-from-here-to-there process: from this world, to a different one. Dreams of making real alterations in our relations to ourselves and others (as well as to the systems that everywhere instil us with a dreadful foreboding that such alterations are highly unlikely) are for many people embarrassing, even rude to mention. Others grow enraged. To comfort the disturbed, and disturb the comfortable: what presumption, on the part of the storyteller.\n\nYet I've got no choice, for I am the disturbed I seek to comfort, and also the comfortable I seek to disturb.\n\nWhat's a novelist? I remove myself from human traffic to sit in a room alone and make up stories about human traffic that doesn't exist. For my living I climb into and then punch my way out of the paper bag of my solipsism on a daily basis – and on the days I don't manage to punch my way out, there is no coach who blows a whistle and tells me to remove myself from the field in favour of a better-rested substitute (\"Where's your Negative Capability today, son?\"). This may, in fact, be an act on a par with painting an abstract composition in oils, titling it Giant Octopus, then hanging it on the walls of a public aquarium. All writing, no matter how avowedly naturalistic, consists of artifice, of conjuration, of the manipulation of symbols rather than the \"opening of a window on to life\". We writers aren't sculpting in DNA, or even clay or mud, but words, sentences, paragraphs, syntax, voice; materials issued by tongue or fingertips but which dissolve upon release into the atmosphere into cloud, confection, spectre.\n\nLanguage, as a vehicle, is a lemon, a hot-rod painted with thrilling flames but crazily erratic to drive, riddled with bugs like innate self-consciousness, embedded metaphors and symbols, helpless intertextuality and so forth. Despite being regularly driven on prosaic errands (inter-office memos, supermarket receipts and so on), it tends to veer on its misaligned chassis into the ditch of abstraction, of dream. That's to say, abstract paintings of a giant octopus are all we have to put on view in my city's aquarium.\n\nNone of this disqualifies my sense of urgency at the task of making the giant octopus in my mind's eye visible to yours. It doesn't make the attempt any less fundamentally human, delicate, or crucial. It makes it more so. That's because another name for the giant octopus I have in mind is negotiating selfhood in a world of other selves – the permanent trouble of being alive. Our language has no choice but to be self-conscious if it is to be conscious in the first place."
