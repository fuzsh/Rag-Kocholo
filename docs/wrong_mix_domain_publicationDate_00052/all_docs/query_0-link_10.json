        "text": "From time to time, I've kept lists of the books I've been reading, simply as a way of seeing where my interests shift from time to time. I occasionally even go to the effort of writing up a short summary.\n\nThis list grew out of a part of the Interests page called What's on my nightstand? where I listed the books I was currently working on. As I finished the better ones, I'd add a few sentences explaining what the book was about and why it was worth reading. It got long enough that I've decided it merits its own page.\n\nAs unintuitive as it may seem, the list is organized in backward chronological order -- the most recent books are at the top. Since you can easily search for author or title, I thought it would be more interesting to show you the path I followed that lead me to each book.\n\nAlthough this list dates back to 1997, it's erratic -- I only update it every few months, and I tend to forget just what I've read, so it only contains books that stick out in my mind. (I rarely list science fiction, for example.) Book titles in bold are those I particularly recommend.\n\nThe Wild Numbers\n\nPhilibert Schogt (7/7/2001)\n\nA distressingly accurate peek into the life of a tame academic. Isaac Swift is an unexceptional but obsessive mathematician who, in a flash of brilliant insight, discovers a proof for the famous Wild Number Problem. The book is his reflections on his hopes and fears for his career, his moody acknowledgement of his intellectual limitations, and his attempts to cope with the avalanche of shocks that his proof produces. A short read and an apt one.\n\nStraight Man\n\nRichard Russo (7/4/2001)\n\nI happened to read this book and The Wild Numbers back to back and they complement one another beautifully. Straight Man is also told from the point of view of an unexceptional professor dealing with the tribulations of his academic world, but unlike Isaac Swift, William Henry Devereaux is cheerfully unconcerned about his future, the approval of his collegues, or the deep and petty divisions in the English department he chairs. His own avalanche of troubles is more serious but he copes, if not always with aplomb then at least with the refusal to take much of what's happening seriously. Reminded me of Garrison Keillor's Wobegon Boy. Deeply funny without being comedic.\n\nEnder's Shadow\n\nOrson Scott Card\n\nIf you haven't read Ender's Game, do so first. It's a science fiction classic. The story concerns a brilliant young boy taken from his family to an orbiting military academy where Earth is training its children to be the next generation of officers for a hopeless war against a superior foe. Ender's Shadow isn't a sequel; it covers roughly the same events, but this time follows Bean, an even smarter, smaller child who goes through the academy with Ender. Surprisingly, this works, and Bean's experiences at Battle School are nearly as compelling as Ender's.\n\nCascading Style Sheets: Designing for the Web\n\nHÃ¥kon Lie and Bert Bos\n\nCascading style sheets (CSS) allow you to specify the look and feel of a Web page by explaining what the HTML tags in it should do. So, for example, if you want the <LI> tag to indent 6 pixels and make a bright blue blinking dot, you can do it. This is clearly the direction in which the Web will run, as it makes it far easier for a site designer to offer many views of identical content, making a site more configurable and accessible to users with different needs. This book, co-authored by Lie (in charge of the W3C spec for style sheets), is both clear and comprehensive. A must-read for Web designers looking forward to the next wave of Web design.\n\nMy American Century\n\nStuds Terkel\n\nTerkel has been interviewing Americans for decades, on topics ranging from the Great Depression to World War II, the prosperity of the 1950's, and the civil rights movement. His books are extracts from these interviews, a matrix of oral histories that attempt to capture the essence of the 20th century in this country. My American Century is a collection of extracts from many of his other books (such as The Good War and Division Street). I strongly recommend Terkel; I thought I knew something about American history, but the details in his interviews provide an entirely new perspective -- not the sweep of history, but the daily lives of its participants.\n\nOtherland (City of Golden Shadow, River of Blue Fire, Mountain of Black Glass)\n\nTad Williams\n\nI'm not a particular fan of cyberpunk: near-future dystopias in which the potency of cyberspace or virtual reality environments is starkly contrasted with a grim and grimy reality. I was pleasantly surprised by Otherland. While it shares many of these qualities -- the United States Congress now has representatives from corporations as well as states; heavy 'Net use is driving people into catatonia; artists involve involuntary participants in deadly artworks, to name a few -- its underlying tone is optimistic.\n\nThe series (these are the first three of four books) revolves around a handful of individuals who learn about a top-secret project of a massive, international conspiracy called the Grail Brotherhood, to build a virtual reality as real as life itself -- the Grail Project, or Otherland. They have spent billions of dollars and decades of work to bring this project to fruition, and they're very willing to kill to keep it hidden. But the project is beginning to have effects in the real world, with dangerous, even lethal, consequences, and it's up to a ragtag band of scientists, hackers, role-players and even an African bushman, to break into Otherland and learn what's really going on. Highly recommended.\n\nThe fourth and final book, Sea of Silver Light, is due out in 2000.\n\nHonor's Voice: The Transformation of Abraham Lincoln\n\nDouglas Wilson\n\nWe tend to think of Lincoln (when we think of him at all) as springing into the Presidency fully-grown, like Minerva from Jove's forehead. Wilson's book examines Lincoln's early life, his childhood, his years as a shopkeeper in New Salem, and his move to Springfield. Lincoln's religion, his morals, and his political philosophy underwent subtle but profound changes during his 20's and 30's. Here with new research more light is shed on a man who was arguably our most perfect President.\n\nThe Castle of Crossed Destinies\n\nItalo Calvino\n\nCalvino, like Borges, delights in playing with the conventions of narrative. The Castle of Crossed Destinies (and the companion section, The Tavern of Crossed Destinies) is a series of stories told by wanderers in a dark forest, struck strangely mute, who have only a tarot deck to communicate. As each one pulls cards from the deck, he adds it to the pattern already laid out on the table, offering new interpretations to the existing structure and expanding it for the next wanderer's tale.\n\nTitan: The Life of John D. Rockafeller, Jr.\n\nRon Chernow\n\nTo describe someone as \"a Rockafeller\" connotes vast wealth, power, and perhaps a predilection for underhanded business practices. Chernow's biography presents a more complete human being, a man whose life is fraught with contradictions. As the head of Standard Oil, Rockafeller virtually invented the concept of monopoly, and ruthlessly crushed his competitors in legal and illegal ways. But he was also a deeply religious man, and like many of the fantastically rich robber barons of the late 19th century, gave much of his wealth away. He founded the University of Chicago, Rockafeller University, gave enormous support to Spelman College, almost single-handedly eliminated hookworm in the South. In many ways, this paradoxical man embodied the best and the worst the Gilded Age brought out in Americans.\n\nInto Thin Air\n\nJon Krakauer\n\nThe tragic tale of a disastrous expedition to the top of Mount Everest in 1996, as told by a journalist who was one of the participants. It was fascinating to see what a business this climb has become -- and how perilous it still can be.\n\nThe Best of H. P. Lovecraft\n\nH. P. Lovecraft\n\nI dislike horror movies and stories in general, so I was shocked and delighted to discover how much I enjoy Lovecraft. His work is far more reminiscent of The X-Files than Fright Night, so much so that I'm not certain I'd call it horror as much as dark science fiction. The writing is rather dense by modern standards, and is suggestive rather than explicit, both things I personally enjoy.\n\nCuriously, the first Lovecraft book I read was The Lurker at the Threshold, which I loved, though it turns out it was actually written by his \"coauthor,\" August Derleth, based on an idea of Lovecraft's. Nevertheless, I thought it captured the style well (though the purists seem to disagree heartily); I recommend that short novel, or possibly The Strange Case of Charles Dexter Ward, as good introductions to Lovecraft's world.\n\nThe Complete Father Brown\n\nG. K. Chesterton\n\nA turn of the century Catholic priest with an uncanny ability to understand criminals, Father Brown is at once guileless and profound. These witty and rather philosophical tales are a must-read for any serious aficionado of classic mysteries.\n\nLies My Teacher Told Me\n\nJohn Loewen\n\nAn examination of high school American history textbooks, and the ways in which they both oversimplify historical issues and render them uninteresting to students, together with suggestions for improvement. Quite enlightening and very engaging book on a subject I didn't think I'd care much about.\n\nThe Great Good Place\n\nRay Oldenburg\n\nOldenburg argues that we need three distinct \"places\" in our life: the home, the workplace, and a \"third place\" where we can relax with friends. This book is a survey of the coffeehouses, bistros, cafes, and pubs that have comprised third places throughout history -- and are rapidly vanishing in American culture. I read it because of my interest in building virtual communities, as it's got a lot to say about what creates and maintains social spaces."
