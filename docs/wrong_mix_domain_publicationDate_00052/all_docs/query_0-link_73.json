        "text": "Introduction\n\nIt is best to begin planning your thesis project early in your graduate career because you have several important decisions to make before you can successfully write a thesis. You have to identify faculty members who would be appropriate thesis advisers and you have to think about potential thesis topics. These tasks are clearly related to one another and require careful thought.\n\nBefore we begin, there are some differences among the disciplines that must be understood. In the arts, humanities, and social sciences, a thesis topic can sometimes be developed as a result of your interest in specific courses you have taken. You might begin by talking with some of your professors about potential topics and present to them your ideas for a thesis topic. Then you should develop a full proposal for a thesis topic when you take English 7800, before you register for English 7810: Thesis. In this way, your research assignments in that course can contribute to your thesis.\n\nFor the purposes of the handbook we will present the process of writing and researching a thesis in four parts:\n\nThesis Proposal\n\nResearch\n\nFirst Draft\n\nFinal Product\n\nThesis Proposal\n\nIn a proposal you tell two people, your adviser and yourself, what you have in mind. Your research adviser can help you write a good proposal, but the first step is yours. Before you approach an adviser for help, write a thesis proposal. This process is central to English 7800: Introduction to Literary Research, a pre-requisite for English 7810: Thesis.\n\nWriting a proposal is not preliminary to research. It is a part of research. To write a good proposal, you should investigate your potential topic before you approach your adviser. One way to do that is to conduct a search for books and articles on the subject using standard bibliographies in your field and reading one or two key books or articles.\n\nConsider your resources and time constraints while developing your initial proposal ideas. The topic you choose depends on a number of things: your own interests; whether your adviser will be on campus while you are working on the project; his or her expertise in your area of study; and the time you have available to complete the research and writing. To narrow or limit a topic usually means giving up some aspect of a topic and concentrating instead on part of it.\n\nThe proposal sketch that you write before you meet with your project adviser should explain:\n\nthe topic you expect to investigate,\n\nthe general line of inquiry you intend to pursue or the tentative argument you intend to pose, and\n\nthe plan for doing research.\n\nA proposal is a starting point, not the finished thesis. Include ideas that you feel sure you would like to investigate as well as other related ideas that you think might be worth exploring. But get your ideas down before you approach your adviser. This will give your adviser a sense of your seriousness about doing the project and will give you both a starting point for discussing the project.\n\nWhen you talk with your research adviser about your tentative proposal, work toward revising it in several specific ways. Consider the following questions:\n\nHow is the project related to what I have learned in previous courses and from my own personal reading and research?\n\nWhat question am I trying to answer by doing the project, or what problem am I trying to solve?\n\nIs the question answerable or the problem soluble? If so, can it be answered or solved in the time I have to work on it?\n\nIs there a piece of the question or the problem that I could work on that would let me go into greater depth than if I tried to take on the whole thing?\n\nWhat should the final project look like (length, format, illustrations, bibliography)?\n\nAs you try to answer these questions and develop your proposal, keep in mind that at this stage nothing is engraved in stone. You cannot possibly know in advance everything that will actually happen as you do the project. In fact, the unexpected things that happen as you work are a part of what makes writing theses exciting and rewarding.\n\nThe completed final draft of your proposal should include the following:\n\nA succinct, tentative title. This is a working title. It says what you think the project is about as you begin it. By the time you finish the project your title may change as your understanding of the project changes.\n\nA statement of the project’s central issue stated either as a noun phrase (“Women in Selected Shakespearean Plays” ) or as a question (“What Does Shakespeare Think of Women?”).\n\nA list of central research questions. What do you want to learn? What problem do you want to solve?\n\nA description of your hypothesis. What do you guess the answer or solution will turn out to be?\n\nA description of the kinds of things you imagine you will have to do in order to complete the project. What kind of work activities will be involved?\n\nA description of the resources you think you will draw upon. Explain which of these you will bring to the project yourself (what do you already know that will help?), which resources you will depend on your adviser to contribute, and which resources you will have to go out and find.\n\nA calendar. This is your work plan. It describes what you imagine you will do at each stage of the work. Set a tentative due date for each stage. Set realistic goals. Make your research project one of your highest priorities, but don’t over-commit yourself. Lay your schedule out so that you can successfully complete each stage of the research project on time without neglecting other important parts of your life, like work and family. Research requires commitment, discipline, and organization—so plan wisely.\n\nBy the time you complete your proposal (if not before), you should consult with one or more potential thesis advisers. These will be members of the Brooklyn College graduate faculty. Although your instructor in English 7800 will evaluate your thesis proposal for the immediate purposes of that course, the document will also facilitate your discussion with potential thesis advisers as you plan for the following semester.\n\nBe sure to file the “Thesis Title” form on BC WebCentral before the end of January if you plan to graduate in the spring semester, or before the end of May if you plan to graduate in the fall semester. The “Thesis Title” form includes your provisional thesis title and the name and email address of your thesis adviser.\n\nSample Prospectus A (PDF)\n\nSample Prospectus B (PDF)\n\nResearch\n\nResearch projects differ in many ways, but most of them have at least two important things in common. One of them is the pressure of time. The other is the tendency to forget, in your natural concern to produce a final product, what you have done day to day on the project.\n\nCalendar: Keeping Track of Your Time\n\nWhat you can’t be sure of before you start your project, of course, is exactly how you are going to spend your research time. You can only guess and make some plans. The calendar you draft in your proposal is a record of your guess. Set up some tentative intermediate deadlines that will remind you day to day and week to week how much you have left to do. You will probably have to adjust these intermediate deadlines as you go along, but even the process of adjusting them will help you know where you are and how far you have to go.\n\nOne way to help keep track of time is to use a monthly box-calendar. It should include major research work points during the term, major deadlines in your other courses, and any important events in your personal, family, and work life.\n\nThe way to stay on schedule is to watch your calendar and keep looking ahead as you work. If you see the project getting too large or too complex for the time you have left, ask your research advisor to help you subdivide it and subordinate pieces that you cannot treat in depth during the time you have left.\n\nResearch Log: Keeping Track of Your Work\n\nOften what keeps you going when you are doing independent study research is the pressure of time: making it to a deadline in one piece. Because of the pressure of time, you are likely to forget what you did, how you did it, and what you thought and felt about it. The urge to move on to the next thing is all but irrepressible. That is the reason many researchers and scholars keep research logs. A research log is a long-term memory bank and a creativity tool. With a complete record of what you did and thought, you can go back over your work from time to time to see how your ideas have developed and discover new ideas or new directions for research. You may want to make use of a double-entry process log. Use the left-hand pages for work notes. Use the right-hand pages for personal responses to your work.\n\nThe work notes that you write on left-hand pages are dated descriptions of what you did, when and where you did it, and why. You can quote passages from your reading that seem interesting, useful, or suggestive. You can draft some sentences or paragraphs that may find a place in your proposal or final thesis. You can list books and articles you have consulted or plan to consult.\n\nThe reflection notes that you write on the right-hand pages are an on-the-spot informal record of your personal experience doing the project. This is the place to carry on a running conversation with yourself about what you are doing. Part of your personal experience is your thinking: your hunches and guesses, however wild; your off-the-wall ideas; questions that arise in your mind, however relevant or irrelevant; your plans; your doubts; your hopes; and your reflections on passages you have read or on passages you have quoted on the left-hand page.\n\nA double-entry process log of this sort takes only a few minutes a day. But its value, as the material accumulates, soars far beyond that small investment of time.\n\nFirst Draft\n\nDo some writing about the project as you go along. Even a paragraph or a page once a week written in your research log will help, restating the position you are taking as your understanding of it changes. Plan to write your first draft early enough to submit it, chapter by chapter, to your adviser and to revise on the basis of his or her comments. Set a deadline to complete a second draft for yourself well before the final due date so that your advisor has time to read it, and you have time to make any further changes that may be needed.\n\nTalking with your adviser after you complete each chapter can help you use the time you have left more effectively. You may discover what it is that you really need to do in order to complete the project in a satisfactory way. You may decide to finish looking into the sources that you have already planned to read. You may decide not to read some of the things you planned to read, but to read something else instead. Or you may decide that you have already read enough, so that what you really need to do with the time you have left is to revise your paper carefully so that it says just exactly what you want to say.\n\nIn any case, keep in mind that revising the final product of a research project will probably involve more than just fixing up the style of an essay. You may have to do some more research, write some new sections, or even rethink the whole thing. In the end, the quality of your essay may depend on how much time you have set aside to rework your thoughts for the final draft.\n\nFinal Product\n\nDo some writing about the project as you go along.
