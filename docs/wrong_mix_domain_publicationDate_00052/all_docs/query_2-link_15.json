        "text": "NOVELS\n\nThe Arrest\n\nEcco Press, 2020\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP\n\n“An exuberantly clever and knowing post-apocalyptic dystopia. . [Lethem is] a writer of abundant literary gifts who applies them with unapologetic enthusiasm. Extremely strange, twistily plotted, fizzingly written and lingeringly mysterious.”\n\n— Telegraph (UK)\n\n“The Arrest is a speculative wonder, a joyfully shaggy and unapologetic page-turner of a tale. It is that rare work that manages to be both optimistic and pessimistic at the same time, somehow evoking all sides of what happens after the end. Simultaneously a celebration and condemnation of human nature, it’s a compelling read from one of his generation’s finest writers.”\n\n— The Maine Edge\n\n“Lethem cleverly builds on and subverts the tropes of postapocalyptic dystopias, mixes in a metafictional element, and expertly mines the nature of storytelling and its power to enchant. An inventive and intelligent speculative tale.”\n\n— Booklist\n\n“As a writer gifted at playing with genre forms and riffing on popular culture, (Lethem) enjoys tweaking dystopian-novel conventions.”\n\n— USA Today\n\n“Rarely has a novel approached the sheer pleasure of The Arrest. This is a dystopian novel in thrall to its own genre, full of knockabout comic book bravado, with regular knowing nods to literary and cinematic history. It is, in short, a blast.”\n\n— The Observer (London)\n\nThe Feral Detective\n\nEcco, 2018\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP\n\n“The Feral Detective investigates our haunted America in all its contemporary guises — at the edge of the city, beyond the blank desert, in the apartment next door. It’s a nimble and uncanny performance, brimming with Lethem’s trademark verve and wit.”\n\n—Colson Whitehead\n\n“Like The Crying of Lot 49 as written and directed by Elaine May, The Feral Detective is hilarious and terrifying and wrenching. Phoebe is one of the grandest, funniest heroes I’ve come upon in a long time.”\n\n—Megan Abbott\n\n“Wild, urgent, and very funny. As always, Lethem writes knowingly and brilliantly about weird, off-the-grid, wayward America. In his ever-more-electric prose, he illuminates both the barbarity and the beauty.”\n\n—Dana Spiotta\n\n“A funny but rage-fueled stunner. . . . Both [characters] are compelling, as are the desert setting and the vividly realized descriptions of its dwellers. An unrelentingly paced tale. Utterly unique and absolutely worthwhile.”\n\n—Booklist (starred review))\n\n“Surrealistic, genre-bending. . . . The personal nature of Phoebe’s tectonic shift in the desert is palpable, made flesh by Lethem’s linguistic alchemy. . . . A haunting tour of the gulf between the privileged and the dispossessed.”\n\n—Kirkus Reviews (starred review\n\nA Gambler’s Anatomy\n\nDoubleday, 2016\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP\n\nDissident Gardens\n\nDoubleday, 2013\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“Lethem is as ambitious as Mailer, as funny as Philip Roth and as stinging as Bob Dylan…Dissident Gardens shows Lethem in full possession of his powers as a novelist, as he smoothly segues between historical periods and internal worlds…Erudite, beautifully written, wise, compassionate, heartbreaking and pretty much devoid of nostalgia.”\n\n—Los Angeles Times\n\n“A righteous, stupendously involving novel about the personal toll of failed political movements and the perplexing obstacles to doing good.”\n\n—Booklist, starred review\n\n“A novel jampacked with the human energy of a crowded subway car…It’s a big book set in small spaces – kitchen, classroom, folky nightclub – that keep its battles personal at all times…[A] wild, logorrheic, hilarious and diabolical novel. Those who reflexively compare Mr. Lethem to other Jonathans, like Jonathan Franzen, would be better off invoking Philip Roth.”\n\n—The New York Times\n\n“A stunning new novel…Spanning several major events — from 1930s McCarthyism through the recent Occupy Wall Street movement — and featuring an imaginative nonlinear time sequence so that the novel’s particulars arrive at unexpected moments, this work is a moving, hilarious satire of American ideology and utopian dreams…Lethem enthusiasts may find this to be his best yet. Very highly recommended.”\n\n—Library Journal, starred review\n\n“Jonathan Lethem’s latest novel, Dissident Gardens, is a tour de force, a brilliant, satiric journey through America’s dissident history from 1930s-era communism to today’s Occupy movement.”\n\n— The Star Tribune\n\nChronic City\n\nDoubleday,2009\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“Astonishing….Knowing and exuberant, with beautiful drunken sentences that somehow manage to walk a straight line…..Turbocharged….Intricate and seamless….A dancing showgirl of a novel, yet beneath the gaudy makeup it’s also the girl next door: a traditional bildungsroman with a strong moral compass.”\n\n—New York Times Book Review\n\n“Chronic City is a feverish portrait of the anxiety and isolation of modern Manhattan, full of dark humor and dazzling writing….proves both funny and frightening.”\n\n—Entertainment Weekly\n\n“Exuberant literary revving…..Lethem’s vision of New York can approach the Swiftian. It is impressively observant in its detail and scourging in its mocking satire. There are any number of wicked portraits….His comments on New York life are often achingly exact….So pungent and imaginative”\n\n—The Boston Globe\n\n“Ingenious and unsettling…Lethem pulls everything together in a stunning critique of our perceptions of reality and our preconceptions of the function of literature.”\n\n—San Francisco Chronicle\n\n“Exquisitely written…Funny and mystifying, eminently quotable, resolutely difficult, even heartbreaking, “Chronic City” demonstrates an imaginative breadth not quite of this world.”\n\n—Cleveland Plain Dealer\n\n“A fluid sense of reality pervades these pages, which explore high society, urban politics, avant-garde art, celebrity mania and the dangers of information overload in an age where context is devalued or ignored….the quality of Lethem’s prose and the exuberance of his imagination are reasons enough to read it…..When it comes to style, Lethem has few equals.”\n\n—Miami Herald\n\nYou Don’t Love Me Yet\n\nDoubleday, 2007\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“Smart and funny . . . a biting satirical take on the intersection of art and commerce, integrity and façade. . . . A send up of all things cool.”\n\n—Los Angeles Times\n\n“Fit to be devoured over a weekend.”\n\n—Rolling Stone\n\n“A gentle and hip romantic comedy [that] breezes through LA’s iconoclastic anonymity with a refreshing sincerity.”\n\n—The Independent\n\n“His best since Gun, With Occasional Music . . . what makes the book sing are Lethem’s accounts of what happens when a crowd on the street hears a band inside a building . . . or when for a moment four musicians understand each other better than anyone of them understands him or herself.”\n\n—Greil Marcus, Interview\n\nThe Fortress of Solitude\n\nDoubleday, 2003\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“Magnificent. . . . [A] massively ambitious, profoundly accomplished novel.”\n\n– San Francisco Chronicle\n\n“Glorious, chaotic, raw. . . . One of the richest, messiest, most ambitious, most interesting novels of the year. . . . Lethem grabs and captures 1970s New York City, and he brings to it a story worth telling.”\n\n—Time\n\n“A tour de force . . . Belongs to a venerable New York literary tradition that stretches back through Go Tell it On the Mountain, A Walker in the City, and Call it Sleep.”\n\n—The New York Times\n\n“The finest novel of the year, by far, and likely of the past five. . . . Better than a movie, better than a symphony, better than a play, and better than a painting, because it is all of them.”\n\n–Austin Chronicle\n\nMotherless Brooklyn\n\nDoubleday, 1999\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“The best novel of the year. . . . Utterly original and deeply moving.”\n\n—Esquire\n\n“Philip Marlowe would blush. And tip his fedora.”\n\n—Newsweek\n\n“Finding out whodunit is interesting enough, but it’s more fun watching Lethem unravel the mysteries of his Tourettic creation. In this case, it takes one trenchant wordsmith to know another.”\n\n—Time\n\n“Immerses us in the mind’s dense thicket, a place where words split and twine in an ever-deepening tangle.” —The New York Times Book Review\n\n“Who but Jonathan Lethem would attempt a half-satirical cross between a literary novel and a hard-boiled crime story narrated by an amateur detective with Tourette’s syndrome?…The dialogue crackles with caustic hilarity…Jonathan Lethem is a verbal performance artisit…Unexpectedly moving.”\n\n—The Boston Globe\n\n“With one unique and well-imagined character, Jonathan Lethem has turned a genre on its ear. He doesn’t just push the envelope, he gives it a swift kick… A tour de force.”\n\n—The Denver Post\n\n“Wonderfully inventive, slightly absurdist… [Motherless Brooklyn] is funny and sly, clever, compelling, and endearing.”\n\n—USA Today\n\nGirl in Landscape\n\nDoubleday, 1998\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“One of the most original voices among younger American novelists….Jonathan Lethem’s imagination [is]…marvelously fertile.”\n\n—Newsday\n\n“Lethem is opening up blue sky for American fiction.”-\n\n–Village Voice\n\n“Complex, scary and finally moving.”\n\n—Atlanta Journal & Constitution\n\nAs She Climbed Across the Table\n\nDoubleday, 1997\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“In this witty but telling new work from the author of The Wall of Sky, the Wall of Eye , our hapless narrator has completed his dissertation on “Theory as Neurosis in the Professional Scientist” and landed a job at the University of North California at Beauchamp (pronouced beach ’em), where he studies academic envirorments, producing “strong but irrelevant work” and falling for physics professor Alice. But Alice is too caught up in Professor Soft’s notorious experiment with a vacuum intelligence called Lack to pay her lover much heed, and soon Lack is the real love of her life. This is not your typically insular campus comedy; Lethem has something bigger in mind, and he succeeds admirably in skewering our pretensions, technological or not, in language that gently mocks the way we hide behind jargon. An ironical book that is, ironically, quite poignant.”\n\n—Library Journal\n\nAmnesia Moon\n\nHarcourt Brace, 1995\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“A hip, updated conflation of Harlan Ellison’s A Boy and His Dog and Jim Thompson’s The Alcoholics. Jonathan Lethem escorts us down an impossibly post-terminal Route 66, kicking and screaming and loving every minute of it.”\n\n– Barry Gifford, author of Wild At Heart\n\n“An author to be reckoned with . . . A social critic, a sardonic satirist like the Walker Percy of Love in the Ruins. But with Amnesia Moon, Lethem slips out of the shadow of his predecessors to deliver a droll, downbeat vision that is both original and persuasive.”\n\n–Newsweek\n\nGun,With Occasional Music\n\nHarcourt Brace, 1994\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“Marries Chandler’s style and Philip K. Dick’s vision . . . An audaciously assured first novel.”\n\n-Newsweek\n\n“Marvelous . . . Stylish, intelligent, darkly humorous and highly readable entertainment.”\n\n-San Francisco Examiner\n\nCOLLECTIONS\n\nLucky Alan and Other Stories\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“Lethem is, of course, a king of sentences…. Lethem works in an interesting literary space between realism and absurdism, modernism and postmodernism, satire and a particular brand of DeLillo-inspired darkness…. His talent is large and, as these stories demonstrate, his eye is as sharp as ever.”\n\n– New York Times Book Review\n\n“Jonathan Lethem’s imagination seemingly knows no bounds…. Comparisons might be drawn to writers ranging from Jorge Luis Borges and Haruki Murakami to Margaret Atwood and J.D. Salinger.”\n\n— Chicago Tribune\n\n“Rewards await the reader who commits to this slim volume…. Lucky Alan is a beguiling addition to a shelf full of uniquely inventive books by a master of genres with a legitimate claim to the much-contested throne.”\n\n— The Miami Herald\n\n“Typically odd, funny and easy to love…. [A] pleasing schizophrenia and a remarkable variety in affect and ambition within one collection.”\n\n— LA Times\n\n“[A] great introduction to the sometimes heartbreaking, often surreal world of Jonathan Lethem…”\n\n— NPR\n\nMen and Cartoons\n\nDoubleday, 2004\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“A strikingly original collection . . . imaginative, insightful, witty and sad.”\n\n—Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\n“An already dazzling writer shows us a new card. . . . Men and Cartoons ends on a note that portends Lethem’s most experimental turn yet: toward human love as [a transporting] alternate universe. . . . Lethem in a new, more nakedly personal key.”\n\n—San Francisco Chronicle\n\n“Lethem is the man to beat in fiction these days. . . . Every tale of ennui, cosmic regret and petty yearning is perfectly realized. The brevity of the book and perfection of the stories puts every other member of his generation to shame.”\n\n—Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\n“Compelling. . . . Effective. . . . Intelligent and poignant. . . . Strange, amusing, haunting. . . . Lethem has what musicians call ‘chops,’ or technical mastery. He can mix and match prose styles and literary genres to create glittering fictional artifacts. . . . Each of these nine tales rewards the reader in some way–through an insight, a scene or simply the force of the author’s imagination.”\n\n—St. Petersburg Times\n\n“Bristling with familiarity. . . . Theme[s] that resonate. . . . [Lethem is] adept at letting palpable human experiences emerge from absurd, fantastical situations.”\n\n—The San Diego Union-Tribune\n\n“Nuanced. . . . Resonates with intense force.”\n\n—Newsday\n\nKafka Americana with Carter Scholz\n\nSubterranean Press, 1999\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\nInspired by affection…. Extremely witty and intelligent.\n\n— Publishers Weekly\n\nThe Wall of the Sky, The Wall of the Eye\n\nHarcourt Brace, 1996\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\nESSAYS\n\nMore Alive And Less Lonely\n\nOn Books and Writers\n\nMelville House, 2017\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP\n\n“Lethem is literature’s ultimate fanboy…[His] earnestness is satisfying, but it’s his vulnerability, his willingness to expose his own flaws, that endears…Lethem’s words remind of us of our own rabid fandoms.”\n\n—The New York Times Book Review\n\n“Incisive, colorful, and insightful…beguiling.”\n\n—Publishers Weekly\n\n“Thoughtful and often sly…[A] standout collection.”\n\n—Kirkus\n\n“Lethem is one of our most perceptive cultural critics, conversant in both the high and low realms, his insights buffeted by his descriptive imagination.”\n\n—The Los Angeles Times Book Review\n\n“Lethem is, of course, a king of sentences . . . His talent is large.”\n\n—The New York Times Book Review\n\nThe Ecstasy of Influence\n\nDoubleday, 2011\n\nAMAZON | BOOKSHOP\n\n“Hefty and remarkable .These byways, all of which make room for eccentric flights as well as proper essays, augment the charm and impact of what Lethem prefers to call an ‘autobiographical collage,’ a phrase he lifts from Vonnegut. This influence seems only natural, for dominating all is Lethem’s prime concern always: the novel, generous, exciting, openhearted, unconventional.”\n\n—The New York Times Book Review\n\n“He’s a novelist who has spent a lifetime creating his own subversive pantheon, a jumpy CBGB’s of the literary soul….Several of the essays here marinate in the fish sauce that is literary gossip…..feisty, freewheeling….funny”\n\n—The New York Times\n\n“Emotionally engaging and intellectually nimble….curated selection of essays which thematically add up to more than the sum of its parts. Progressive, eyebrow-raising, Impassioned.Disarming,”\n\n—The Guardian\n\n“The writer I most wish was my best friend….impressively omnivorous new collection of mostly non-fiction….reveal a lively, even manic mind at play across a wide and wonderful series of subjects that are threaded together, mostly, as a kind of autobiography of a would-be writer becoming a struggling writer and then a successful writer while all the while remaining a voracious reader.”\n\n—The National Post\n\n“Conceptual ambition, sense of purpose and a fan’s evangelical devotion distinguish this collection from the typical novelist’s gathering of nonfiction miscellany…..impressively rich….In addition to being a writer who blurs the distinction between genre fiction (sci-fi, detective, western) and postmodern literature (a term he questions), Lethem writes with a commitment to sharing his enthusiasm for whatever obsesses him..”\n\n—Kirkus Reviews, starred review\n\n“Peppery nonfiction….provocative tour de force….thoughtful and rambunctious….dynamically juxtaposed and connected….to create a jazzy, patchwork memoir….hilarious….fresh, erudite, zestful, funny frolic in the great fields of creativity.”\n\n–Booklist\n\nThe Disappointment Artist\n\nEssays, Doubleday, 2005\n\nAMAZON | BARNES & NOBLE | iBOOKS\n\n“Lethem is one of our most perceptive cultural critics, conversant in both the high and low realms, his insights buffeted by his descriptive imagination.”\n\n—Los Angeles Times Book Review\n\n“He fearlessly analyzes his influences–movies, books, artists, friends, parents–and his insights are highly personal, but also often universal, and thus these essays reach the highest goal of the memoir form.”\n\n—The Seattle Times\n\n“This is a gem of a book. . . . Heartbreaking. . . . Mesmerizing. . . . A form of smuggled autobiography. . . . With a few deft strokes, the reader is left with a vivid image of Lethem’s childhood.” —The New York Observer\n\n“Moving. . . . Absolutely fascinating. . . . Dense with allusion and insight.”\n\n—St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\n“These marvelous explorations take us into the hiding places of the psyche, where second thoughts are assessed, secret-sharer sins confessed, and grief and loss redressed. In a collection as warmly engaging as it is ruminative, Jonathan Lethem shows himself to be as much a master of the personal essay as he is of contemporary fiction.”\n\n—Phillip Lopate\n\nOTHER BOOKS\n\nThe Blot\n\n(With Laurence A.
