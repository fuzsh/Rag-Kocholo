Eagles of Death Metal is an American rock band from Palm Desert, California, formed in 1998 by best friends¬†Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme. Despite their band name, Eagles of Death Metal is not a death metal band. The story goes that a friend was introducing Josh Homme to the death metal genre. When he played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as “The Eagles of Death Metal“. After hearing this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. With that, the band was born.

Just when you thought it was safe to take your ladyfriends out again, Eagles of Death Metal are perched and ready to swoop in. The band has already toured their mustaches off, but the road once more beckons and the people have spoken… there will be more Eagles for the masses soon!
