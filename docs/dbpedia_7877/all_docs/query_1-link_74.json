        "text": "The clip above, which premiered at Rolling Stone, finds Homme discussing the burden frontman Jesse Hughes was feeling in the three months leading up to their return in February 2016. \"There's almost no way to do it right,\" he says. \"He also represents something now -- we also represent something now -- and there's an added importance that always was looming and showed its face. Music is important. It's important, it's important. It's a talisman for helping those people heal.\"\n\nHomme recognized what Hughes called his \"sacred responsibility\" to return to Paris to perform, but he also realized that it might be too emotional for some of those who were in attendance that night at the Bataclan. \"Some of the people won't be able to make it,\" he continued. \"They'll want to but they just can't, and we understand that. And then there's people that will need to be there, and they'll need [Hughes], Davey [Catching, guitarist] and all those guys, and God willing if I can be there, too, to walk across that line from the side of the stage on the stage to tell them who we are. There's a very idealistic moment there that can galvanize everyone together, that's wonderful and hopeful and possible; that has that faith still. That faith that was always there could actually be the saving grace of that moment, or the first step out of a f---ing terrible situation.\""
