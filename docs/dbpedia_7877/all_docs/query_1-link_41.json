        "text": "A new Queens Of The Stone Age album has seemingly been confirmed by Eagles Of Death Metal’s Jesse Hughes.\n\nEagles Of Death Metal were founded by Hughes and Queens Of The Stone Age mastermind Josh Homme, with the pair writing and recording all four of EoDM’s studio albums together.\n\nIn a recent Instagram livestream, Hughes is asked “what have you guys been up to?” before the vocalist replies: “Recording”.\n\nHughes goes on to say Eagles are “recording a new record. Queens just did one, now we’re doing ours now.” The footage can be seen on Reddit. The last Queens Of The Stone Age record was 2017’s ‘Villains’.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news comes as Queen Of The Stone Age have started revealing tour plans for 2023. The band were due to headline Reading & Leeds Festivals in 2021 and Mad Cool earlier this year, but cancelled both appearances due to “restrictions and logistics“. The last proper headline show from the band was 2018, as the band toured Australia.\n\nAs it stands though, Queens Of The Stone Age are set to appear at both Southside Festival and Hurricane Festival next year, which both take place in Germany in June.\n\nRecommended\n\nMore recently, Josh Homme appeared onstage at Wembley Stadium as part of the Foo Fighters-curated Taylor Hawkins tribute concert. First he covered David Bowie’s ‘Let’s Dance’ with a Nile Rodgers-led band before reforming Them Crooked Vultures for a three-song set.\n\nThe supergroup – featuring Homme, Dave Grohl and Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones, covered Elton John’s ‘Goodbye Yello Brick Road’ and Queens Of The Stone Age’s ‘Long Slow Goodbye’ as well as playing their own track ‘Gunman’.\n\nThey also appeared at the Californian leg of the tribute concert, switching out ‘Gunman’ and ‘Dead End Friends’. Prior to that, Them Crooked Vultures hadn’t performed together since 2010.\n\nEarlier this year though, Grohl said a possible return was on the cards, saying “I hope that someday we do it again.”\n\nAdvertisement"
