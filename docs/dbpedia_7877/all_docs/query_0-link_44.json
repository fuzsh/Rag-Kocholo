For instance, along with Jesse Hughes, he’s half of the duo Eagles Of Death Metal, who haven’t made a new album since 2008’s Heart On. But now there’s a new one called Zipper Down on the way, and the band is teasing it with a fired-up new song called “Complexity.” Title notwithstanding, there’s nothing complex about this one; it’s a big and fun and dumb rocker that begs for an open car window. It was previously recorded by Hughes under his Boots Electric moniker. Listen to it below.\n\nNo details on Zipper Down yet, but it’s on the way."
