        "text": "Friday marks three weeks since the Paris attacks that claimed the lives of 130 people, 89 of them at an Eagles of Death Metal concert. Eagles of Death Metal gave its first interview since the tragedy last week, and on Wednesday night, band co-founder Josh Homme invited fellow charter member Jesse Hughes on his Beats 1 radio show for a second public talk.\n\nOn the 21st episode of Homme’s Alligator Hour, the pair shared several covers of Eagles of Death Metal’s “Love You All the Time” — renditions from the Dean Ween Band, Matt Cameron and Alain Johannes. All publishing income from the covers have been donated to Homme’s Sweet Stuff Foundation, as a benefit for those affected by the attacks.\n\n“We challenged every artist to cover ‘I Love You All the Time’ so we could donate the proceeds to our friends in Paris,” Homme explained. On Cameron’s cover he said, “He sent that version in right away and it’s a great example of taking a song and twisting it into a new position.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nMy Morning Jacket Covers Eagles of Death Metal’s ‘I Love You All the Time’\n\nNot one to let the mood go un-lightened, Hughes went ahead and said: “Or taking its nipples like a t***y-twister that almost feels like it’s going to twist it right off, but twists it on.”\n\n“The entire participation is beautiful,” Hughes added.\n\nThey also played Eagles of Death Metal’s cover of Duran Duran’s “Save a Prayer,” the publishing proceeds of which Duran Duran has also pledged to charity.\n\nAll in all, it was a touching hour. The pair exchanged best-bro pleasantries (Homme is “Baby Duck” and Hughes is “Boots Electric”), Hughes dedicated the Beach Boys’ “God Only Knows” to his girlfriend and “soulmate” Tuesday Cross (who escaped Le Bataclan at his side), and the show ended with a moment of silence, followed by Jeff Buckley’s cover of “Hallelujah.”"
