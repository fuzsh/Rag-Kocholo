        "text": "More Eagles Of Death Metal\n\nEagles Of Death Metalâs first Australian tour since 2016 is rapidly approaching, with the Palm Desert-based band touching down on our shores on 25 July.\n\nThe American rockers made up of Jesse Hughes (lead vocals), Queens Of The Stone Age's Josh Homme (drums) and touring members will bring their desert rock swagger and infectious energy to stages in Melbourne, Sydney, Newcastle, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, and two dates in New Zealand. Find more information about the dates and venues below.\n\nEagles Of Death Metalâs 2023 tour also celebrates their 24th anniversary as a band.\n\nJoining Eagles Of Death Metal in Melbourne only is special guests The Delta Riggs. In early May, the Aussie indie rockers dropped their new feel-good track, Solutions. The latest number from The Delta Riggs is three minutes of glorious rock and roll bliss, inspiring sun-soaked imagery of afternoons with family and friends.\n\nThe band commented about the single, \"Taking from our experiences in life, as well as that of friends and strangers alike, instead of just seeing the negatives, we wanted to write about finding the positives in situations. Finding a solution through banding together with friends, lovers, family or strangers you're yet to meet, lifting each other up and sharing the weight together.\"\n\nThe Delta Riggs are the perfect fit for this tour, having sold out their own headline runs, as well as scored opening slots for Kasabian, Foo Fighters and Billy Idol.\n\nDon't miss a beat with our FREE daily newsletter\n\nJoining Eagles Of Death Metal on all Australian dates is WA outfit The Southern River Band. They can easily be described as a fresh cut of '80s classic rock, and even when theyâre opening for a band as beloved as Psychedelic Porn Crumpets, they own the stage and draw âscarily wildâ crowd engagement, per The Music.\n\nWith a tireless work ethic and passion for riffs, The Southern River Band are a pure rock and roll party band. Coming off the back of a huge 2022, the band recently supported UK rock heavyweights The Darkness for the second time. You can check out the music video for their latest single, Streets Donât Lie, below.\n\nTickets to Eagles Of Death Metalâs 2023 Australian tour are on sale now via Frontier Touring.\n\nEAGLES OF DEATH METAL\n\nAUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND JULY & AUGUST 2023\n\nWith special guests: The Delta Riggs (Melb only) + The Southern River Band (AU shows) + Grown Downz (NZ)\n\nTuesday 25 July - Forum Melbourne | Melbourne, VIC\n\nThursday 27 July - Enmore Theatre | Sydney, NSW\n\nFriday 28 July - Cambridge Hotel | Newcastle, NSW\n\nSaturday 29 July - The Tivoli | Brisbane, QLD\n\nMonday 31 July - The Gov | Adelaide, SA\n\nWednesday 2 August - Astor Theatre | Perth, WA"
