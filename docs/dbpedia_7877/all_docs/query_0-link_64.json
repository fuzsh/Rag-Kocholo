        "text": "Post by Smitty. on\n\nJoshua Michael Homme (17 May 1973)\n\nAssociated Acts: Kyuss (1987 - 1996), Queens of the Stone Age (1996 - Present), The Desert Sessions (1997 - 2003; 2019 - Present), Mondo Generator (1997 - 2002), Eagles of Death Metal (1998 - Present), Fififf Teeners (2000 - ?), Arctic Monkeys (2008 - ?), Them Crooked Vultures (2009 - ?), Iggy Pop (2016 - ?)\n\nVocal Range: B1 - F♯5\n\n{Vocal Summary By Susilupus}Josh Homme is most well known as the frontman for Queens of the Stone Age. His musical career started at the age of 14 with the formation of Kyuss, who would go on to become one of the leading names in the stoner rock scene over the course of less than a decade. After the band's dissolution Homme briefly abandoned his music career, but through chance met some old friends which led to him joining Screaming Trees as a touring guitarist for a while. After he grew tired of the band's constant conflict he formed Queens of the Stone Age in 1996, with whom he has since released multiple albums. He has started and joined many different projects since then, such as The Desert Sessions, Eagles of Death Metal and Them Crooked Vultures, as well as collaborating with multiple artists over the years.\n\nHomme's vocals have changed somewhat since the start of his career. Perhaps the most noticeable differences are his increase in vocal confidence since the inception of Queens of the Stone Age and his upper register getting steadily stronger as time has gone on. He sings most often in his mid and upper range, with more usage of the latter over time. His high range is dominated by his falsetto, which he has used up to the lower fifth octave at highest, though he tends to stick to the fourth octave most of the time. Any singing using a more weighty or full sound is more rare, and usually caps around G4, with any \"full\" notes above that being extremely few and far between. His lower range is somewhat more rare, though he has proven that it is plenty strong enough when he does use it, as evidenced by his surprisingly strong E2s in a live cover of \"Dark as a Dungeon\". Homme has been a part of and has worked with multiple influential acts over the course of his career so far, not least Queens of the Stone Age. Even if you ignored everything else he has done, fronting arguably one of the biggest rock bands of the last couple of decades is more than enough to ensure his position as a part of music history.\n\n{Album Ranges}With Queens Of The Stone Age:\n\nQueens Of The Stone Age (1998): D2 - G4 - C5\n\nRated R (2000): G♯2 - A4 - B4\n\nSong For The Deaf (2002): A2 - B♭2 - B♭4 - C♯5\n\nLullabies To Paralyze (2005): G2 - A2 - E♭5\n\nEra Vulgaris (2007): G2 - B4 - D5\n\n...Like Clockwork (2013): D2 - C5 - F♯5\n\nVillains (2017): B1 - B4 - E5\n\nIn Times New Roman...
