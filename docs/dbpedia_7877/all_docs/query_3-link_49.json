        "text": "The list of musicians that Alain Johannes has worked with reads like an encyclopedia of California rock history. In high school he was in bands with Flea, Hillel Slovak, Jack Irons and Anthony Kiedis, all of whom would form the Red Hot Chili Peppers.Later Alain formed Elevenwith Natasha Shneider and Jack Irons. They toured with Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, and for several years recorded and toured with Queens of the Stone Age. As a writer, producer and engineer, Alain has worked with Chris Cornell, No Doubt, Mark Lanegan, Jimmy Eat World, Queens of the Stone Age, Brody Dalle and Arctic Monkeys. Alain has been a touring member of PJ Harvey’s band, as well as Them Crooked Vultures which featured Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters, Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age, and John Paul Jones from Led Zeppelin. As a composer, Alain has written music for films such as “Eagles of Death Metal: Nos Amis” and for video games such as Tom Clancy’s “Ghost Recon Wildlands.” Alain was part of the Sound City Players which performed in connection with the documentary, “Sound City.” Alain co-wrote and performed “A Trick With No Sleeve” with Dave Grohl and Josh Homme for the movie and the soundtrack. Alain recently finished his third solo album, ‘Hum,’ while also teaming up for the Alain Johannes Trio with brothers Felo and Cote Foncea, accomplished musicians in their home country of Chile. The first release is “Luna A Sol” featuring guest vocalist Mike Patton.\n\nDetroit is home to guitarist and Candyrat recording artist, Sammy Boller. Hailed by Guitar World as “one of electric guitars most promising names,” Sammy’s debut instrumental album, Kingdom Of The Sun, was released in March, 2020 to international acclaim.\n\nA former music student at the University of Michigan, Sammy catapulted onto the national radar in 2012, when Joe Satriani selected him as a winner in Guitar Center’s “Master Satriani” competition. Now, an internationally-acclaimed player, Boller has amassed a large and loyal online following, and he earns his living as a full-time musician. Prior to embarking on his solo career, Sammy played guitar for the band, Citizen Zero (Wind-Up Records/Concord Music Group). Their State Of Mind LP notched multiple radio singles, including the debut release “Go (Let Me Save You)”, which cracked the Top 15 on Billboard’s Mainstream Rock Chart.\n\nOutside of his own live touring schedule, Sammy also spends time on the road with world-renowned amplifier wizard Dave Friedman (Friedman Amplification). The two regularly embark on runs through the States and Europe to sponsor clinics and gear demonstrations. In addition to his support role with Friedman, Boller is also a contributing columnist for Guitar World Magazine. His online column (“Secrets of Shred With Sammy Boller”) has a loyal monthly following, regularly racking up view counts in the tens of thousands.\n\nWhen asked to describe his influences and approach, Sammy says, “My guitar playing has always been about plugging into an amp and blowing the walls down. I grew up wanting to be Eddie Van Halen and Randy Rhoads, but over time I’ve found my own dark and aggressive style. These days, my dream as a musician is to make people feel as connected to the cosmos as I feel when I play the guitar. I’d love nothing more than that.”"
