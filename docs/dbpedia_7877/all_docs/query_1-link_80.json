I said, \"Are you kidding?\" I texted Josh Homme and I said, \"Are you alright?\" He said, \"Yeah, I'm in L.A. Why?\" I didn't put two and two together that he didn't tour with them. So I said, \"Oh thank God, I just heard a horrible story.\" Then it turned out to be true. It's just awful.”\n\nWatch Below: Boyfriend of Woman Dangling from Paris Window Didn't Know She Was Pregnant\n\nRelated Articles:"
