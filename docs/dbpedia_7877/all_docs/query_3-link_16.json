But either way I cut & pasted it from the web site.... sorry if its been posted before.\n\nOn Saturday August 16th at the Henry Fonda Theater in Los Angeles, Queens of the Stone Age will perform a concert in celebration of the life of Natasha Shneider.\n\nQOTSA will be accompanied by friends PJ Harvey, Jack Black + Kyle Gass, MATT CAMERON, Brody Dalle, Jesse Hughes, Billy F. Gibbons, Chris Goss, and Alain Johannes, who will help them perform songs from the limits of the QOTSA catalog and beyond.\n\nOn July 2nd, at 11:11 AM, Natasha Shneider passed away. She ended her time in this Life with the style & poetry that she lived all the days previous, crossing over while held in the arms of her closest & dearest. No words can encapsulate the unwaivering strength she provided, adversities she overcome, the talents she possessed & nutured, the sharpness of her wit nor the beautiful complexity of her intellect. We are so thankful for her influence & the gift of her friendship.\n\nA celebration of Natasha Shneider will be held in Hollywood at the Henry Fonda Theatre on Saturday, Aug 16th. Further details will be released shortly. All proceeds of the benefit & donations made will go to the relieve the burden of Natasha's fight against cancer.
