        "text": "One of the only permanent members of the Eagles of Death Metal is not at their show in Paris where 60 people have been taken hostage. The AFP reports that 100 people are dead in the Bataclan theater. The same agency says that three attackers have been killed at the concert venue.\n\nCNN reports that 149 people are dead in total in Paris. Meanwhile the AFP reports that 1,500 extra French soldiers have been deployed on the streets of their nation’s capital.\n\nThere are no reports that Josh Homme was performing at the show or that any of his bandmates were taken hostage. French group Red Lemons, who were performing at the show said that all of the members of the Eagles of Death Metal were safe in a Facebook post. In that message, the Red Lemons refer to “Tuesday,” likely to be sometime Eagles of Death Metal base player and porn star Tuesday Cross.\n\nIn a Facebook posting, the band said “We are still currently trying to determine the safety and whereabouts of all our band and crew. Our thoughts are with all of the people involved in this tragic situation.”\n\nIn the United Kingdom, ITV News quotes the number of hostages as being “more than 100.” This is a screenshot from a Facebook posting from a man, Benjamin Cazenoves, who says that he’s inside the concert hall:\n\nAside from Homme, the other permanent member of the group is Jesse Hughes. You can get a full list of musicians who perform with the group here.\n\nThe last tweet from the official Queens of the Stone Age (Homme’s other band) account encouraged people to follow the Eagles of Death Metal. His last Instagram message, showed a mocked up version of him with fellow band leader Jesse Hughes:\n\nHomme has previously stated that the band is not a heavy metal band but rather a “bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals.”\n\nIt follows a shooting at a restaurant and a bomb close to a soccer game in the Parisian suburb of Saint Denis.\n\n“More than 60 people” are dead in total, was earlier reported by The Daily Telegraph’s Henry Samuel.\n\nIn response to the attack, France has closed its borders.\n\nRead more about where the other attacks occurred at the link below:"
