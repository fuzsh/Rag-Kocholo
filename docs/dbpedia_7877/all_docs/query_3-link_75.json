        "text": "Of the six locations of violence from Friday night’s attacks in Paris, the most deadly was at the Bataclan Concert Hall, where attackers armed with automatic weapons fired upon concertgoers while American rock band Eagles of Death Metal were on stage. All reports today from family of the band members say that the band was able to escape Bataclan unharmed. Emily Dorio—wife of drummer Julian Dorio, who was touring with the band in place of founding member Josh Homme — [told the Washington Post] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/13/the-bataclan-theater-the-epicenter-of-the-terror-attack-in-paris/) that Julian “called to say that he loved me and he was safe. Everyone on stage was able to get off.” Emily also [told NBC News] (http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/paris-terror-attacks/california-band-was-due-play-club-time-paris-attack-n463251) that “everyone on stage managed to get out and that he and other band members made it to a police station.”Julian’s brother Michael told CNN that the band “heard the gunshots before they saw anything” and “the whole band exited as fast as they could.”\n\nBand frontman and co-founder Jesse Hughes spoke to his brother after the band was able to make it out of Bataclan and to a nearby police station. Jesse’s brother David posted on Facebook news of Jesse and the band’s safety.\n\nThe attackers reportedly killed dozens of concertgoers before a police raid on the venue. Some police officers were also killed in the operation.\n\nOne person working with the band was killed, according to “people with knowledge of the situation” as reported by the Los Angeles Times, while another person working with the band was shot. After the attacks and a subsequent siege by police, at least 100 people died at the concert hall, including the two gunmen.\n\nThe Eagles of Death Metal were formed in 1998 by Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme, the latter a member of the band Queens of the Stone Age. The name is intentionally ironic—what would a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band sound like?—as the band has more of a bluesy-garage-rock sound. The band was touring Europe in support of their first album in seven years."
