        "text": "Eagles Of Death Metal vocalist/guitarist Jesse Hughes recently made some privileged information public via his Instagram. In that video, Hughes, who is a longtime friend of Queens Of The Stone Age mastermind Josh Homme, was asked by a fan what his band have been up to. Hughes can be seen responding in the below clip, “[We’re] recording a new record. Queens just did one, now we’re doing ours now.”\n\nHomme is of course also a primarily studio member of the Eagles Of Death Metal. The desert rock kings in Queens Of The Stone Age‘s latest release is 2017’s “Villains“. The last full-fledged Eagles Of Death Metal” album, “Zipper Down“, arrived back in 2015."
