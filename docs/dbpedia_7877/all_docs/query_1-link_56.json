        "text": "Last November, the Californian band Eagles of Death Metal made headlines across the world after their concert at Paris’s Bataclan venue was targeted in terrorist attacks. Although the band were unharmed, at least 87 people were killed at the Bataclan, including one of the group’s merchandise-sellers, 36-year-old Nick Alexander from Colchester.\n\nThe cult blues-rock group, who are due to perform in Paris's Olympia Theatre tonight, were formed by singer Jesse Hughes and drummer/guitarist Josh Homme in 1998. Best known as the frontman of Queens of the Stone Age, Homme also plays in rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures with Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl and Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones. Homme has also collaborated with Arctic Monkeys, providing backing vocals for their latest album, AM, and co-producing 2013’s Humbug.\n\nHowever, Homme was not present at the concert; although Homme and Hughes are the only permanent members of the band, their live shows feature a frequently changing line-up of musicians.\n\nThe group, who do not play death metal, chose their name as an in-joke, after a conversation in which Homme described the Polish band Vader’s style as like death metal, if it were played by Seventies rockers The Eagles.\n\nThe American band’s music combines elements of glam-rock and bluegrass with the “desert rock” sound of Homme’s main group, Queens of the Stone Age. Homme has compared Eagles of Death Metal to his fellow Californians, Canned Heat. The band often show a sense of humour in their work; on their 2004 debut album, Peace, Love, Death Metal, Hughes and Homme were billed under several fake names, including “Carlo von Sexron”, “Baby Duck” and “Mr Boogie Man”.\n\nFrontman Hughes recently hit the headlines, after revealing his thoughts on gun control ahead of tonight's gig.\n\n\"Did your French gun control stop a single f---king person from dying at the Bataclan?\" he asked, during an interview on the French radio station iTélé. \"And if anyone can answer yes, I’d like to hear it, because I don’t think so. I think the only thing that stopped it was some of the bravest men that I’ve ever seen in my life charging head-first into the face of death with their firearms.\"\n\n\"I know people will disagree with me, but it just seems like God made men and women, and that night guns made them equal. And I hate it that it’s that way. I think the only way that my mind has been changed is that maybe that until nobody has guns everybody has to have them.\"\n\n\"Because I’ve never seen anyone that’s ever had one dead, and I want everyone to have access to them, and I saw people die that maybe could have lived, I don’t know... I wish I knew for sure if they could have had a better chance because there were some real angels, real wonderful people in that show that aren't alive today and I really wish they were.\"\n\nThe frontman also revealed his thoughts on returning to Paris and performing there for the first time since the traumatic events of last year.\n\n\"There's been just such an outpouring of support for us and love for us. It's overwhelming. I just don't want to let anyone down,\" he said."
