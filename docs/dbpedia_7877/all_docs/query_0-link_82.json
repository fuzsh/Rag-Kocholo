        "text": "Eagles Of Death Metal\n\nDeath By Sexy\n\n3.5\n\ngreat\n\nReview\n\nby any14doomsday USER (16 Reviews)\n\nApril 12th, 2006 | 39 replies\n\nRelease Date: 2006 | Tracklist\n\nEagles of Death Metal - Death by Sexy...\n\nFollowing up an album as sexy as Peace, Love, Death Metal is a tuff thing to do. But in my opinion if anyone could do it, I guess it would be Eagles of Death Metal, they are the sexiest band... EVER!!!!!\n\nThe album starts out strong enough with the quick Boys Bad News its a solid track, but things seem a little over-produced. It doesn�t have that whole \"Recorded in a few days\" kind of vibe that there previous album did. In most cases solid production really doesn�t take anything away from a band, but the Eagles kind of lose a little charm with their new found studio wizardry.\n\nThe next couple tracks Just Nineteen and Cherry Cola are a couple of nice rockers. They return to that classic Eagles vibe, but on Just Nineteen Josh Homme seems to be edging up into the limelight, His Backing vocals really are a little high in the mix. Cherry Cola is one of my personal favorite cuts; it�s a fun rocker, with ridiculous lyrics.\n\nUp next is I like to move in the night it�s another really good track, it�s about dancin'. Something the Eagles feel very strongly about, and that was lacking in the first few songs. The bass on this one is at the center, it has a good distorted bass line, and some cool melodies. Next is Solid Gold this one is a bit of a clunker, the guitar is too clean, and I just don�t dig the overall feel of the song. But the lyrics are sexy as hell and that�s always a plus.\n\nAfter a rather disappointing track comes, Don�t Speak this ones cool and it has sexy as hell lyrics that you just want to sing along to;\n\nDon�t move! I came to make a bang ya\n\nBang ya !\n\nDon�t move I came to bang ya !\n\nThe guitar is nice and fuzzy, and things don�t drag on to long, it�s just a good song. Next is Keep your Head Up , maybe there is some kind of sex joke that I don�t get in this song, but the chorus sucks, the rest of the song is pretty damn good and saves it from being a complete disaster. Also maybe it�s just me but it sounds like he screams \"Ronald Reagan\" at the end of the song.\n\nNext up is The Ballad of Queen Bee and Baby Duck , I think this song about Josh Homme, and Brody Dale, but the hell if I know, it�s a cool song, Jesse croons the lyrics like a champ, and the female vocals really add to the song. This one has a cool sound. After that comes Poor Doggie these drums sound really familiar� in fact it�s almost the exact drums from �Flames go higher� off there previous album Peace, love, Death Metal. But overall this is another good song,with a cool old timey bluesy sound..\n\nNow comes, Chase the Devil this is the fastest song on the album, also its one of the best, it starts with a nice folk guitar bit, then goes into strait up rock and roll boogie, a personal favorite of mine. Following that up is Eagles Goth I still don�t know why the hell it has that title. If anything I guess its cause of the moody �Ooohh�s and Ahhh's\" found on the song. Its a quick one, but its cool, I think of it as this albums \"Midnight Creeper\" This is another good cut, and its sexy as hell to boot.\n\nNext up are the last two tracks Shasta Beast and Bag O' Miracles .The former is another good track, talking about how parents hate Jesse because he�s so damn sexy. Bag O' Miracles is a nice calming hyme type of song. It�s a great track, and a really good way to close the album.\n\nSo what it comes down to is; should you buy �Death by Sexy...? Yeah, you should. It�s a good album, it�s got a filler track or two, like any album, and sure it�s a little short. But it�s good none the less. Some of the new Ideas don�t really work as well as they could have but the music is solid and, like there debut album it�s damn fun to listen to.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\n3.5 / 5\n\nTweet\n\nRecent reviews by this authorBoredoms Super Roots 5Boris AbsolutegoBoris PinkBoris Akuma no UtaBoris Soundtrack from the Film Mabuta no UraQueens of the Stone Age Stone Age Complication"
