        "text": "Jesse Hughes, co-founder of Eagles of Death Metal with his Palm Desert High School classmate, Josh Homme, has become as famous in some circles for being shot at by mad gunmen as for producing good-time rock and roll.\n\nHis band was playing at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris when terrorists killed 89 people and wounded hundreds more in November 2015. Hughes and Homme expressed their reaction to that tragedy in a documentary titled “Nos Amis (Our Friends),” and then tried to stop talking about it after its release at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. But when another 58 people were shot to death Oct. 1 at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, he posted advice on Facebook to Jason Aldean, who was dodging bullets in Vegas like he was ducking for cover at the Bataclan.\n\nCOMMON BOND: What Hughes said to Aldean\n\nBut Phil Pirrone, producer of this weekend’s Desert Daze Music & Art Festival in Joshua Tree, was more interested in Eagles of Death Metal for their desert rock cred than their headlines. He booked them to play his three-day festival at 6:45 p.m. Sunday, before Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions, Spiritualized and Unknown Mortal Orchestra. EODM guitarist Dave Catching will lead his own band, Earthlings?, at 3:50 p.m. that day.\n\nIggy Pop and John Cale of the Velvet Underground headline on Saturday, and BadBadNotGood and Courtney Barnett & Kurt Vile and the Seal Lice will top the Friday bill. Desert multi-media artist Cristopher Cichocki will do his “Circular Dimensions” shows all three nights.\n\nBut Pirrone knows this is a big gig for EODM.\n\n“It’s just really special we can host them on their home turf after everything that’s gone on in their career,” he said. “We’ve known those guys for a few years and obviously we’re big fans of their music. We wanted them to play the festival for a while and their schedule just never allowed it. This year it worked out and we couldn’t be more excited.”\n\nHughes talked about the festival, his music, life on the road and his recovery from Bataclan in a wide-ranging telephone interview last week while walking outdoors in Los Angeles.\n\nTHE DESERT SUN: Where are you? You sound like you’re in a wind storm.\n\nJESSE HUGHES: I’m walking around a Costco. I am in a wind storm. It seems like every direction I go, the wind takes me.\n\nAm I interrupting your shopping?\n\nNo, no, no! I live right across the street from Costco and Toys\"R\"Us and normally it’s quiet as hell, and I can pace around. But, ever since that damn eclipse everything’s gone screwy.\n\nRight. It’s metaphysical. But, let’s talk about Desert Daze.\n\nI’m really excited about that, man. It was one thing to play Coachella. That was kind of awesome. But this is more like a McCallum-level show. You know what I mean?\n\nI know you felt a lot of pleasure when you went back to the McCallum Theatre in 2007.\n\nThat was something that was unbelievable. That wasn’t so much a sensation of \"Ha-ha, look at me now,\" because, to be fair, there were a lot of people who believed in me –several high school counselors and teachers, role models in my life. I felt like, \"Gee, I didn’t totally waste everything you told me.\" Being able to do that was having, sort of, success, and my mother was taking everything seriously.\n\nDesert Daze caught fire last year in Joshua Tree. I saw it at Dillon’s Roadhouse (in Desert Hot Springs) the first year (in 2012) and it was kind of lackluster. Now it’s very cool.\n\nThe festival as a thing was not the sort of conventional wisdom you would want to bet on (in 2012). But that’s changing. Something is allowing the concept of a mass interaction with the arts possible again. Being able to reach an audience that hasn’t heard you, and herd them to your side, is very exciting, and that’s what you can do at a festival.\n\nYou’ve played a lot of festivals. Any particular ones stand out for you?\n\nAbsolutely. We’re a festival band. There’s a festival in (Belgium) called Pukkelpop. It has a game room, gourmet-catered food. They go all out. Australia has the only tours that are just festivals because it’s so spread out. A festival tour will have six dates and the bands all tour together. It’s really amazing because you get to have this little community and interaction with artists that you would never otherwise have. There will be like three shuttles from the airline to the hotel and you’re in rooms according to your stage. That’s where I met Duff McKagan (from Guns N’ Roses). His band was in our group, so we’d always be hanging out waiting for the bus. It was where I got to know Pepper (Keenan) from Corrosion of Conformity. We were on this beautiful beach hotel and we went swimming and, here’s this tough Pepper from Corrosion of Conformity not able to see me in the water, thinking I’ve drowned because he thinks I’m a weak swimmer, going, \"Jessie, where are you? Oh my God, you worry me!\" These are moments you wouldn’t otherwise be able to have.\n\nDid you get to know Iggy Pop while Josh was producing him?\n\nAbsolutely. I actually got to know Iggy before Joshua. I got to be friends with the (Stooges) drummer, (Scott) Asheton of the Asheton brothers, who both died. We opened for the Stooges and the Damned about 10 years ago in Italy. That’s where I met Iggy. I actually got to audition for the Stooges when the original guitarist (Ron Asheton) died. I was so stoked to be there, (bassist) Mike Watt actually had to take me outside and, “Dude, I know it’s rad, but, come on!” I got through a pretty decent version of “Shake Appeal,” and then I was like, “Thank you for this. That’s enough for me. Someone better and more capable should do this.”\n\nDid you see Iggy and the Stooges when they played Coachella in 2003?\n\nThat was the first time Joshua revealed me to the rock and roll world. He took me to that show.\n\nThat was an amazing set. The band hadn’t played together for 29 years and had been through heroin addiction and it came back better than ever.\n\nDude, Iggy is the real deal. And to be able to watch the process of what Josh did with Iggy was magic. Iggy had never had success in real time. It's always about 10 years after whatever he’s released. And there was a moment when he was near tears in the control room. He was like, “I’ve never felt like this before.” Josh was like, “What?” He says, “To have people appreciate something I’m doing as I’m doing it.” Joshua really wanted to deliver to Iggy exactly the right thing he was supposed to deliver and I feel like he did it.\n\nI wanted to talk to you about the concept of Desert Daze being in a cool environment. It seems like those are the ones that become distinctive and, if they’re run well, successful. What does being in the high desert bring out in you?\n\nYou kind of hit the nail on the head. It’s the whole atmosphere. It’s like a giant terrarium. In the high desert, what comes with it immediately is isolation. You already know you’re kind of out there and there’s a history there. It’s where a certain very important figure (Gram Parsons) died and his body was stolen by his roadie. These things are of legend. But, we’re also in a lineup with some other great artists, so it’s cool. It’s an opportunity to really rock. We love every second of what we do, especially since Paris. We were so bound and determined to get better the right way that we have returned ourselves to being the horniest rock and roll band the world has ever known.\n\nMORE: Hughes and Homme discuss Paris\n\nSo, you think you've become a tighter band since Paris?\n\nWe really have rallied around one another. We look out for each other. No one person can say, “This is the right way to do something.” Our attitude was not, “Why me?” It was, “Why not me?” and, “Never let the bad guys win.” We felt like that’s what we’re supposed to do and we are doing it.\n\nHave you written any new material since then?\n\nI just completed this “Super Troopers 2” score. It was an amazing experience because it’s not really making music like I’ve ever done before. I ended up doing like 60 individual pieces of music for it. I really wanted to make it unique and they (the Broken Lizards production company) really wanted to make it an Eagles of Death Metal thing. The entire soundtrack is us. I did it in two-and-a-half weeks, total time. I thought it was a long time, but they were like, \"Whoa! No one ever does it that fast.\"\n\nThe movie is hilarious and I was supposed to be a part of it, but, a month before that, we as a band, minus Josh, went in with Kesha and were her backup band on two songs that just came out. One’s like a girl’s sing-along anthem and one is an entirely new genre of music, called Boogie Pop, which could very well go down as my proudest moment. I love Kesha. I’m really proud of her actually. She went through hell and being a part of her album was a great honor because when you go through hell and you feel you’ve been up against the bullies, you’re probably going to put people you look to as big brothers to help you on the album, and I think that’s really awesome.\n\nMORE: Kesha in the desert\n\nHow did you get to know Kesha?\n\nI’ve known her since she was 15. She used to come to our shows, trying to get in, if it was over 21. She had this enthusiasm. You could just see that there was something special about her. She was also precocious and able to handle herself and have a conversation.\n\nShe’s the classic case of going up against a bully (having sued her music producer, Dr. Luke, for infliction of emotional distress, gender-based hate crimes and employment discrimination and then being counter-sued by him for breach of contract and defamation). You’ve talked about how you met Josh when he saved you from a bully. Did you feel like you had something in common with Kesha?\n\nAbsolutely. Also because she’s one of us. She likes to make pop music, but she’s a rock and roller at heart. So, when I got wind of the terms of some of that deal, I felt like someone was taking a swing at one of us – because they were. That’s how a lot of us took it. We were in a situation where if we ever saw that (bleep) in the seats, it was on like Donkey Kong.\n\nHow did you grow from your experience with bullies?\n\nI hate bullies and thank God for me, when I got to a place where I could maybe fight a little bit, I didn’t get a taste for it. Bullies are the worst, especially bullies that prey on people and lure them into a position of their weakness. That’s actually extra-cruel and a little more diabolical because it’s not just a cold, random circumstance of turning the corner onto where a bully hangs out. It’s a bully deliberately enticing you and playing to your best qualities and taking advantage of your worst things.\n\nHow did that affect you? I know you became political and got interested in journalism. But your music is more like good-time music. It doesn’t sound like fighting-back music.\n\nMy concept of vengeance modified. Because I love you I’m going to tell you the absolute truth. My nickname, The Devil, actually was given to me in high school because sometimes I felt incredibly bullied – in a way that there was no way I could let this go and ever feel good about my life. So the means by which I achieved vengeance inspired Joshua to look at me with sort of abject perplexion: “You’re the damn devil, dude.” After high school, especially about the time we were starting to make the first album, I began to realize the best vengeance is simply success. In fact, if you’re putting any of your time, any of your plan into something that considers (involving) the worst person in your life, then that’s sort of a waste. My mom used to tell me, “Don’t care what a jerk thinks. Be happy if they don’t like you and move on.”\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Desert Daze Music & Art Festival, produced by Moonblock\n\nWhen: Doors open 2 p.m. Thursday, music runs continuously 12 hours a day from noon Friday daily through late Sunday\n\nWhere: Institute of Mentalphysics (also known as the Joshua Tree Retreat Center), 59700 Highway 62, Joshua Tree.\n\nAdmission: $229-$450 for the weekend, $89-$149 for single day passes."
