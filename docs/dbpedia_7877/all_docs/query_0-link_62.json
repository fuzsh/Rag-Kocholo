        "text": "The November 13, 2015 terrorist attack in Paris claimed 130 lives around the city — 89 of them at the Eagles of Death Metal’s concert at The Bataclan Theatre. Eagles of Death Metal: Nos Amis (Our Friends) spotlights the American rock band as they recount their experiences before and after the tragic events. The film provides harrowing first-person details from members Dave Catching, Matt McJunkins, Julian Dorio, and Jesse Hughes about that day in Paris, when they desperately tried to save their lives, while Josh Homme (who had stayed behind in the States) received shocking reports back home. The documentary also takes a close look at the intense connection the band has always had with their devoted fans, which moved them to return to Paris to perform once again in February 2016, not just for their own state of mind, but for Nos Amis — their fans and fellow Bataclan survivors. Eagles of Death Metal: Nos Amis (Our Friends) includes accounts of fans who survived the Bataclan attack, extensive behind-the-scenes footage of the band and interviews with Bono and The Edge of U2. Directed by Colin Hanks, produced by Sean Stuart of Company Name and Heather Parry of Live Nation Productions, and executive produced by Michael Rapino through Live Nation Productions, the documentary is a portrait of resilience in the face of unspeakable horror and a life-affirming coda to the events of November 13. The GRAMMY Museum is pleased to present an intimate screening of Eagles of Death Metal: Nos Amis (Our Friends), followed by a conversation with Colin Hanks and Sean Stuart moderated by Scott Goldman, Vice President of the GRAMMY Foundation."
