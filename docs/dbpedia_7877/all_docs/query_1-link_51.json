        "text": "California's iconic rock phenomenon who sound neither like '70s AOR nor relentlessly grim heaviness, Eagles of Death Metal have announced their long-awaited return to Aotearoa. Heading our way as part on an eight date Australasian tour, EODM will headline Auckland's The Powerstation on 5th August and Wellington's San Fran on 6th August, the globally beloved group's first local shows since 2016. Co-founded by frontman Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme (Queens Of The Stone Age), and first arising from the sun-baked realm of Homme's The Desert Sessions Volumes 3 & 4, EODM's two decade plus oeuvre includes such monster rock long players as 2004's Peace, Love, Death Metal, 2006's Death by Sexy, and their 2019 covers collection EODM Presents Boots Electric Performing the Best Songs We Never Wrote.\n\nHaving featured a legion of mega-talents among their ranks at one point or another — including Dave Grohl, Jack Black, Nick Oliveri, Taylor Hawkins and Liam Lynch — EODM's live lineup for their NZ dates will be the foursome of Hughes with Jennie Vee on bass, Jorma Vik on drums, and Joshua Jove on guitar. Committed to bringing the good times via the in-the-red, raw untamed power of rock 'n' roll, don't you dare miss Eagles Of Death Metal's mighty return this winter — details below...\n\n“Man, I have been itching to get back out there and play some live rock ‘n’ roll again to the best fans in the world. John Steinbeck once said, ‘People don’t take trips, trips take people’… This is an open invite to come take a trip with me and the band.” — Jesse Hughes\n\nEagles Of Death Metal\n\nSaturday 5th August - The Powerstation, Auckland\n\nSunday 6th August - San Fran, Wellington\n\nTickets on sale via frontiertouring.com/EODM\n\nHere's Eagles Of Death Metal's cover of Mary J.
