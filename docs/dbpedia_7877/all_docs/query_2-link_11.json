        "text": "Eagles of Death Metal, the duo of Jesse Hughes and Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme, haven't released an album since 2008's Heart On. But now they're back with a new single called \"Complexity\". That's the quite excellent artwork above; you can hear the song below. It comes in advance of Zipper Down, the band's new LP. Stay tuned for more info about the album.\n\nThe band also offered a pair of statements. \"'Complexity' is the musical equivalent of holding a lucky rabbit's foot with the unlucky rabbit still attached,\" said Homme. \"'Complexity' is sort of our way of saying, 'Keep it simple, stupid,'\" said Hughes.\n\nEagles of Death Metal are also on tour right now. Find the dates below.\n\nEagles of Death Metal:"
