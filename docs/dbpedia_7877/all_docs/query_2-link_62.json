        "text": "While it's hardly shocking that sleaze-rockers Eagles of Death Metal would play a show at a strip club, it's a little surprising to learn that they apparently played one in Portland on a random Thursday night.\n\nBut it happened. Last night, the band stopped in at Devils Point—the home of Stripperaoke—on Southeast Powell Boulevard for a show that was announced on social media only a few hours prior.\n\nAn employee at the club reached by phone on Friday was unsure of how it came together, but it appears to have been the handiwork of Portland native and Jackass alum \"Danger\" Ehren McGhehey, who's touring with the band.\n\nThe band played about an hour while flanked by the club's dancers. Based on videos that have popped up on YouTube, which you can watch below, they covered Motorhead's \"Ace of Spades\" and performed \"I Love You All the Time,\" a song that was covered en masse to raise money for the victims of the terrorist shooting at the Bataclan in Paris back in 2015. If you recall, EODM was playing the venue the night gunmen opened fire and killed 89 people, including their merchandise manager."
