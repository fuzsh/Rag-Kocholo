        "text": "Eagles of Death Metal: Nos Amis (Our Friends), a documentary about Eagles of Death Metal and the terrorist attack at Paris’ Bataclan venue, premieres on HBO on February 13th. Ahead of the Colin Hanks-directed film’s debut, Rolling Stone has an exclusive clip from the doc, with an emotional Josh Homme discussing the band’s Parisian concert just three months after the attack.\n\nAs Homme explains, the show was significant for both Bataclan survivors and Eagles of Death Metal frontman Jesse Hughes. “[Hughes] also represents something now, we also represent something now, and there’s an added importance that always was looming and showed it face: Music is important. It’s important, it’s important. It’s a talisman for helping those people heal,” Homme says in the clip.\n\n“Once I heard that the band was going back to finish their show in Paris and continue the European tour, it occurred to me that it could be a moment for people to collectively come together to move on with their lives,” Hanks tells Rolling Stone. “That said, there were a lot emotions and concerns about going back. There were a ton of questions about the show and its symbolism and I felt it was as important to try and capture those moments as well. To show that everyone involved was conflicted about moving forward, but felt it was important to so. It’s important to not let the bad guys win.”\n\nThree weeks after the massacre at the Bataclan that claimed the lives of 90 people, Eagles of Death Metal briefly returned to the French capital to perform at U2’s Paris concert. (The group played “I Love You All the Time” alongside Patti Smith’s “People Have the Power.”) Bono and the Edge also sat down for interviews for Nos Amis.\n\nTrending\n\nIn February 2016, however, Eagles of Death Metal came back to Paris to play a full concert at the city’s Olympia venue, a cathartic experience for both the band and those in attendance for the Bataclan show.\n\n“Some of the people won’t be able to make it, they’ll want to but they just can’t, and we understand that. And then there’s people that need to be,” Homme said in the clip of EODM’s Paris concert. “There’s a very idealistic moment there that can galvanize everyone together, that’s wonderful and hopeful and possible. That has that faith still, that faith that was always there could actually be the saving grace of that moment, or the first step out of a terrible situation.”"
