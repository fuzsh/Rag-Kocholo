        "text": "The Gutter Twins and Pals Play for a Cause\n\nBy DONNA BALANCIA\n\nEagles of Death Metal, The Gutter Twins, Josh Homme and more top musicians donated their time for Afghan Whigs guitarist Dave Rosser. Rosser has stage 4 colon cancer.\n\nThe Gutter Twins opened with Greg Dulli and Mark Lanegan and were joined by musicians including Duff McKagan and Petra Haden.\n\nGreg expressed his concern over Rosser’s condition and thanked the audience for participating in the evening. Many of the audience members paid for VIP tickets and the money goes to the care Rosser and expenses he’s incurring from what doctors say is inoperable cancer.\n\nThe Gutter Twins\n\nTo call The Gutter Twins alternative is like calling Beethoven a piano player. The band had its faithful in the audience who sang along to most of the tunes in the set, including “Belles,” “God’s Children,” “You Can’t Put Your Arms Around a Memory,” and Twilight Singers cover “Number Nine.”\n\nThe voices and guitar work by the remarkable musicians were intertwined to present a collaborative effort that appeared long-rehearsed. The end result was obviously made with love and respect for Rosser.\n\nEagles of Death Metal – “Save A Prayer” LIVE from Teragram Ballroom LA here:\n\nHeadliner Eagles of Death Metal put on an excellent and appropriately raucous show that covered the bases. The set didn’t kick off until 11 p.m. and two set lists later. Jesse wore a white suit with trademark suspenders and was his usual friendly self, greeting audience members with handshakes and blowing kisses.\n\nJosh Homme\n\nThe star of the night was Josh Homme who did a acoustic set and was later joined by Matt Sweeney. He was relentless with the kid in the pit right in front of him, named Diego. And try as he may have he could not censor his language and that was a source of many jokes. He played “Villains of Circumstance,” and with Matt performed Cab Calloway’s “Minnie The Moocher,” and Johnny Cash mining song “Dark as a Dungeon.” One of the highlights of the set was “Spinning in the Daffodils.”\n\nAnd Josh swigged from a bottle and joked during the night but said Rosser’s affliction was a sad matter and he appreciated the audience coming to celebrate his friend.\n\nTo contribute to the Dave Rosser GoFundMe page go here.\n\nThe GoFundMe page reads:\n\n“Every once in a while a human being comes along that transcends everything: life, art, friendship, wit, music and love. They are among the true ‘one of a kinds.’ Dave Rosser belongs to that category. A New Orleanian for nearly 25 years, he is widely considered to be a true virtuoso guitar player by some of the most influential artists in the industry.\n\n“He has toured the globe extensively with The Afghan Whigs, Twilight Singers, Mark Lanegan and Marc Broussard. He’s worked on projects with Ani Difranco, Joseph Arthur and a list of who’s who in music. He’s played with local bands too numerous to mention. A working man’s musician. If that wasn’t impressive on its own, he is also one of sweetest human beings on the planet. His sense of humor and generosity rival his musical prowess.”\n\n“Save A Prayer” VIDEO\n\n[Best_Wordpress_Gallery id=”62″ gal_title=”Eagles of Death Metal at Teragram Ballroom”]"
