        "text": "I'm sure everybody is familiar with Josh Homme, ex-Kyuss, produced the Desert Sessions, currently front man of Queens of the Stone Age (though I've been hearing rumors that they split, or atleast that Nick Olivieri and the drummer left, but that's beside the point of this thread).\n\nWell now, Josh has a side project called Eagles of Death Metal. No, they do not play Death Metal, they play Classic/Garage Rock type dealy (a lot better than the \"Garage Rock\" MTV picked up...)\n\nIf you're interested, go to eaglesofdeathmetal.net and check out the concert they put up for download. It's pretty good.\n\nEagles of Death Metal is:\n\nJesse Hughes : Vocals / Guitar\n\nTim Vanhamel : Guitar (Vocals)\n\nCarlo Von Sexron (Josh Homme) : Drums (Vocals)\n\n[image=http://www.eaglesofdeathmetal.net/pics/pld.jpg]\n\nNew album out now (I think...)\n\n[image=http://www.eaglesofdeathmetal.net/pics/eodmplrs.jpg]\n\nP.S. Incase you've never heard of Tim Vanhamel, he's the frontman for Millionaire, which is a Belgian Rock band, Josh Homme is a pretty big fan of that band too. Check them out! You can watch a video of theirs on their site, here.\n\nAnyway, \\m/ Peace, Love and Death Metal! \\m/\n\nSo much interest...ahh, and it is such good music. I don't know why everybody always complains about the state of music when nobody even checks anything out when I do post some good music. (same thing as when I posted the B.O.T.A.R. site, blgh.)"
