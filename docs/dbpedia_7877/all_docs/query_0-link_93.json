        "text": "It makes total sense that Flea and Woody Harrelson are good friends. They’re both unique cats who have thrived in the entertainment world for decades. So, when they shared a story about snowboarding naked together, the first thought that arises is naturally, “Of course they have! Would be shocked if they didn’t!”\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist and acclaimed actor touched on this story on Where Everybody Knows Your Name, the podcast hosted by Harrelson and Cheers co-star Ted Danson. Flea brought it up first and noted, “I have footage of Woody Harrelson and I snowboarding stark naked down a big, snowy mountain.” He added, “I wanted to post it on Instagram, but [Harrelson’s wife] Laura cautioned me against it. That it might now be wise to have, uh, peckers floating around.”\n\nBoth Flea and Harrelson were chuckling while talking about their nude moment, which then led to another wild story snowboarding story. The two of them were racing down a mountain, and Flea says he nearly collided with a woman who was skiing down the mountain. Once Flea and Harrelson made it down, the woman confronted Flea.\n\n“She’s infuriated,” said Flea. “She’s like, ‘You nearly hit me! You coulda got me and you’re out of control!’ And I was like, ‘Ma’am, you’re absolutely right. I was out of control and I’m so glad that I didn’t hit you, but I’ll be much more careful next time. Please forgive me, I’m very sorry.’”\n\nRELATED: Flea Proclaims His Love for Denny's, Iconic Diner Chain Responds\n\nHowever, the woman was still heated and started pointing one of her ski poles in Flea’s face. Harrelson then approaches the situation to try and calm things down, but the woman threatens them both by saying her husband will come and find them.\n\nThis leads Harrelson to get heated, and Flea said, “And that’s when [Harrelson’s] like ‘Bring the f—ing husband. I want to see [him]. Bring the husband.’”\n\nThe husband did show up, but Flea and Harrelson opted to leave to avoid a fight. Flea then said, “You and I get on the lift and you’re just like itching for a brawl, and you start yelling, ‘I’m waiting at the top of the lift! I’ll be waiting up top!’ And then you tell [me], you’re like, ‘Nothing could make me happier, nothing can make me happier than that f—ing guy come up there.’ And I realized there’s like, a joy that you take in impending chaos.”\n\nHarrelson then admitted, “Yeah, that used to be true. That’s not like me anymore. I think I’ve outgrown it. I don’t want to be that guy anymore, but honestly, I’m leaning toward the spiritual part of my nature.”\n\nWell, they may not take joy in “impending chaos,” but at least Flea and Harrelson will always have naked snowboarding. What fun friends they are!\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
