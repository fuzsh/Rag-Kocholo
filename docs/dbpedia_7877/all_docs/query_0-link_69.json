        "text": "Rock duo, featuring Josh Homme of Queens Of The Stone Age, Eagles of Death Metal are streaming their new album in full. ‘Zipper Down’ is scheduled for release proper on the 2nd October 2015 via T-Boy/Universal Music.\n\n“The new album really represents to me an attitude and philosophy of life,” says Jesse Hughes. “One should not zipper up, they should zipper down and let it all hang out.”\n\n“In an independent study, four out of three doctors say ‘Zipper Down’ is an eargasm trapped inside a crazerbeam. And I believe them,” Homme adds.\n\nHaving unveiled a series of mini-documentaries related to the album, Eagles of Death Metal are gearing up to return to the UK and Ireland in late October.\n\nOCTOBER\n\n31 LEEDS Beckett University"
