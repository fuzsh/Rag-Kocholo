        "text": "Eagles of Death Metal is an American rock band from Palm Desert, California, formed in 1998 by best friends Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme, which was the singer and guitar player of Queens Of The Stone Age.\n\nDespite their band name, Eagles of Death Metal is not a death metal band. The story goes that a friend was introducing Josh Homme to the death metal genre. When he played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as “The Eagles of Death Metal”. After hearing this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. With that, the band was born.\n\nThe debut album Peace, Love & Death Metal was released 2004 on Homme’s label Rekords Rekords. In 2005 they released their second album Eagles of Death Metal, on which collaborated Jack Black, Brody Dalle, Mark Lanegan and the drummer of QOTSA Joey Castillo. In 2006 they went on tour with The Strokes, in 2008 they released their third album Heart On.\n\nThere is a new album on his way and with that they will go on world tour. The Eagles of Death Metal will come to Prague on the 30th of June. As support is coming the British band Dolomite Minor."
