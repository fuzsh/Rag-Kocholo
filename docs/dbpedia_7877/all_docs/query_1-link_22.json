        "text": "Queens Of The Stone Age frontman Josh Homme has once again gotten behind the drum kit for the second album from the Eagles Of Death Metal. Homme (photo) plays drums under the name Carlo Von Sexron in the band.\n\nclick all images (1)\n\nTitled \\\"Death By Sexy\\\", the new album will be released in January 2006. It was recorded in just eight days. According to Homme the Eagles take little time in the studio because they\\'re not looking for a perfect recording:\n\n\\\"I think that if you play music like the Eagles Of Death Metal perfectly, then you\\'ve made a grievous error\\\". It just needs to sort of rock along and have all the mistakes and all the character things exposed.\\\"\n\nEagles Of Death Metal were formed by Josh Homme and former journalist Jesse Hughes a few years ago. The band\\'s debut album, \\\"Peace Love Death Metal\\\", came out in 2004 and was recorded in a mere two days.\n\nEagles Of Death Metal have toured intermittently, with Homme sometimes performing with them between Queens Of The Stone Age commitments."
