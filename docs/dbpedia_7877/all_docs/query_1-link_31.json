        "text": "Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme, founders of the rock band, Eagles of Death Metal, graduated from Palm Desert High School around the time Sonny Bono launched the Palm Springs International Film Festival.\n\nThe festival, which honored Lucille Ball, Frank Capra and Kirk Douglas that first year, initially seemed out of their league. But Homme reached rock stardom with the desert rock bands, Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age, and he brought Hughes into his orbit in 1998. Both bands played Coachella, then the McCallum Theatre. Now they’ve hit the trifecta with a documentary world premiering Saturday at the Annenberg Theater in their valley’s other major arts event, the Palm Springs International Film Festival.\n\nINTRO: Eagles of Death Metal founders give final accounting of Paris attacks\n\nThis isn’t the way they wanted it to go down. The documentary, “Eagles of Death Metal: Nos Amis (Our Friends),” is about how Eagles of Death Metal were playing at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris when terrorists killed 89 of their fans. The film explains that the bands were able to escape when their Nashville drummer, substituting for Homme on their European tour, recognized when the gunmen were reloading and implored everyone on stage to run.\n\nTheir friend, actor-director Colin Hanks, Tom Hanks' son, convinced the buddies to make a documentary showing their side of the story. He turned it into a tale of deep friendship, which morphed into kinship with everyone who survived the Paris attack, and even the family members of those that didn’t survive.\n\nHughes and Homme talked about the film, which will air on HBO in February, and the experience in a joint interview revealing both their vulnerability and humor.\n\nTHE DESERT SUN: Are you guys coming down for the screening?\n\nHOMME: Absolutely. I wouldn’t miss it for the world.\n\nHUGHES: Any opportunity to go to guys I went to high school with, “Hey, guys, check this out.”\n\nHOMME: It’s really very poetic that this is premiering at the Palm Springs film festival. It’s kind of a testament to Colin Hanks’ loving hands. It’s really intuitive and I’m thankful for his understanding of our relationship. For it to end up starting here, where our families are, is like…\n\nHUGHES: I hate to say something corny, but, it really hits close to home.\n\nTDS: It’s complex, though. It’s not something where you’re going to be celebrating your arrival. It’s a chance to share something deeply personal with friends and family, and the 135,000 people the festival attracts.\n\nHOMME: Honestly, it’s less about who it attracts. The fact that it is being shown where our families are is what is so good about it. But, the film is depicting the worst thing that has ever happened in our lives. So, it’s hard to have a huge upshot for us.\n\nHUGHES: To have this launch where my mom is going to be next to me is very important. I know it sounds weird, but I personally am afraid of this film. It’s hard for me to watch. I think it’s wonderful, but (fighting back tears), I would rather have any other reason in the world to be talking on the phone, you know?\n\nHOMME: I agree with that 100 percent. It’s the most complex thing I’ve ever had to deal with and love.\n\nTDS: Let’s talk about the genesis of the film. How did Colin Hanks get involved?\n\nHOMME: When all this went down, Colin came to us saying, “This can’t be left to the mob, to the peanut gallery. It needs to be an expression from our side.” I said, “Do not pick this up. I recommend you don’t get anywhere near this because I can tell you, I’m here and it’s awful.” What’s so righteous about him is, he said, “No way.” He felt he could share what he knew about us and protect us.\n\nTDS: I see the film as being about one’s sense of responsibility to your friends and your culture. Rock ’n’ roll is a culture and this is about all the people who stayed to help their friends, even though people were shooting at them, and it’s about Josh coming to France to help you, Jesse, saying, “I’ve got your back.” That’s what gives this film heart.\n\nHUGHES: I feel like this terrible thing really happened to rock ’n’ roll. It’s sort of like a serious call went out and rock ’n’ roll came forward to protect it.\n\nHOMME: There is so much visual and sensory overload about the terrible side of something like this, you can get hung up on the terror. But to me, that would be a shame because that’s just the thing that started the situation. The thing that’s most interesting is the response. What people did on that night. What people did for each other. What’s worth more to me is showing how somebody’s cowardice and misplaced sensibility actually is the catalyst to galvanize people that care about each other, won’t let each other go and are part of the arts.\n\nTDS: I’d like to explore the idea that people who are leaders in pop culture have a responsibility for sustaining the culture. Bono and The Edge (of U2) talk in this film about coming forward for you guys because their culture has been attacked. The film also talks about your sense of responsibility for Jesse, starting with when some bullies threw him into a pool when you first met him. Where do you get your sense of responsibility?\n\nHOMME: Well, I have (the names of) my grandfather and my grandmother tattooed on my knuckles. I worship them. I’ve always idolized my dad, too. He is a stand-up guy. I’m OK that I don’t understand the meaning of life, but, until then, I’ll just stand by my friends and my family and this tower we’re trying to build that’s even above people. This ideal. That’s what matters.\n\nTDS: Jesse, you say in the film that you and Josh are products of this valley where there were leaders plotting to rid the world of communism and all these stars and a music that came out from under that. How has what you learned from growing up in the desert impacted how you’re dealing with this?\n\nHUGHES: For me, I can’t help but see the almost divine intervention. Of all the people that would have been at the center of something like this, the luck of it being some kids from the desert. When I was growing up and we went to parties (with) generators, if there was trouble, there was no one there to get you out of it. Our individual way of growing up in the desert gives you a sense of independence that I think is a little uncommon elsewhere.\n\nTDS: Jesse, I don't know if you saw the column I wrote after the attacks, but I said I felt like the Eagles of Death Metal's music was really American music and you were playing for our American ideals.\n\nHOMME: I think that's 100 percent accurate.\n\nHUGHES: I read that and, I just want you to know how important that was (breaking up) for me to read at that stage for my confidence level, to feel like I had home boys on my team. Our community circled around us. Everything went the way it should have gone. That’s not the way it normally goes.\n\nHOMME: Part of me thought, “The worst person possible for this is Jesse” because Jesse is so beautifully sensitive and attuned to what other people are thinking and what they care about. The part of Jesse that’s such a beautiful puppy, that I love so much. Then I realized, in a weird way, Jesse is the ultimate person because Jesse has faith and he believes in what he is doing. Jesse has got this spirit that's contagious. So, sadly, he’s the perfect person to represent American music, American ideals and family, and also a profound, complex way of letting go and being wild and free at the same time. So I felt like, “I’m sorry, but, this had to be you. You’re the perfect person for this.”\n\nHUGHES: That’s not lost on me, which I learned. There was no shirking from this duty, so to speak. Something we love and something that was a part of us was attacked and who else was going to do it?\n\nTDS: Bono said in the film that basically he was too cool to ask the crowd if everybody was going to be alright. But he said you could go out and ask the audience what everybody wanted to hear.\n\nHOMME: Yeah, “Is everyone still alright?” That moment was astounding. Sorry to jump in there, Jess, but I’m so proud of you because that shows exactly who you are, the guy I know.\n\nTDS: It's sort of like, by being an ingénue, you can get away with not being cool. You can say what people are feeling. Where did you get that courage to be yourself -- and to not worry about what the bullies were going to think?\n\nHOMME: He was always that way.\n\nHUGHES: When my parents divorced, my mother drove me and my brother across the country (from South Carolina) and we didn’t have anything. When we got to California, my mother went on welfare to support us and it was humiliating for her, but she never got down. Every hit the world would throw at us, my mother took it for us and never complained. To her, it was a wonderful thing to be able to suffer on behalf of her children. That was my example. Doing the right thing is its own reward. “Deserve” has nothing to do with it. I felt very grateful in the most terrible way when this thing started to unfold that I had a mother that raised me like that.\n\nTDS: Jesse, what's it like now when you play “Kiss the Devil” (the song he was playing when the attacks started). Is there a flashback to that night?\n\nHUGHES: This is a really good question, Bruce. We haven’t played it yet.\n\nTDS: Really.\n\nHOMME: It’s hard to know what to do. This has been a discussion we’ve had. Some things become talismans for something and it’s hard to know what to do with that.\n\nHUGHES: I haven’t wanted to put much thought into that because it would be really easy for me to start resenting it too much. Now, because so much time has elapsed, I don’t know what to do.\n\nHOMME: You don't want to be insensitive, right? I don't want to be insensitive, but I (bleeping) love that song and (bleep) you people that want to stop us.\n\nSUNDAY MARY PICKFORD SCREENING: More on Cathedral City expansion\n\nTDS: I’m sure the Rolling Stones had the same question after Altamont (the 1969 California festival in which a fan was stabbed while they were playing “Sympathy for the Devil”) about “Sympathy for the Devil.”\n\nHOMME: They’re not comparable, I’m sorry to say. We need to be sensitive to people’s mothers, people’s brothers, their sisters, their fathers, their children and it’s scary to know what to do for them. If it was, “Should we play it because of terrorist activity?” “(Bleeping) play it. Let’s go!” But this is about families and wanting to make sure they feel how much we care and are trying to do the right thing.\n\nHUGHES: When we were going back, I needed to know what they wanted. So, when some of our friends were like, “I don’t know if I can hear that song,” it went out the window for me.\n\nHOMME: Many people will never want to hear that song ever again. So, maybe they should be in charge of when we do that. We’re going to make other songs that are going to reach heights.\n\nTDS: It sounds like you consider your fans at the Bataclan like family and this is a family decision.\n\nHOMME: And if even one of them can never hear that song, that’s like 10 people more than I would need to respect that.\n\nHUGHES: For me, rock ’n’ roll is a second life and the only reason I got to do it is because of these fans that believed in me and bought our tickets. So, that makes them some of the best friends I’ve ever had. They made it possible for me to have this life. So, when this life was attacked, I really felt like they were attacking my boys and girls for real. It changes the way you proceed when you feel it’s not just you, when you can actually feel the community.\n\nHUGHES: You know, Jess, as someone who knew you in high school and felt you weren’t understood, I feel like our fans are the friends you never had loving you for who you are and you’re like, “I get friends!” I have gone to our fans’ houses with Jesse.\n\nTDS: Tragedy brings people together. They call soldiers in combat bands of brothers. There’s a level of empathy that doesn’t exist among people who haven’t been through that type of tragedy. Do you feel you’ve gained an empathy you can use, whether by helping others or in your songwriting?\n\nHUGHES: Absolutely. It really hasn’t been a situation of me feeling like I’ve had to carry the weight of the world on my shoulders. The level of circling around us that has taken place on the part of our fans. Watching the movie, I was so touched when (a French fan) was speaking about how mad she was that they did this to us. When you hear someone who had a bullet taken out of their leg at a rock show, being angry that somebody had the audacity to hurt one of their friends, can you imagine anything more selfless? Could you possibly imagine a situation where you would really want to deserve that? I’ve been guided by the way my mom raised me, which is, if you have blessings you can’t feel entitled to them. They should inspire you to work harder to deserve them. It made it easy, in a bizarre way, to want to do right by the fans because they are such beautiful people.\n\nHOMME: The one thing that really hit me, watching the film, was listening to the survivors talk. I felt so proud that they were fans of ours. There are things coming out of this that I think will help us have a future that is better.\n\nHUGHES: I went back the night of the anniversary (Nov. 12, when Sting re-opened the Bataclan) and one day I spent 16 hours talking to every family member of every victim. There were about 12 kids who lost their lives. And, when you’re sitting at a table with a mom who lost her only child and all she’s trying to do is smile and tell you how appreciative she is that you’ve even arrived, I would have no expectation that she should have anything to say other than a vague resentment of the fact that (her child) came to my show. That is impressive when there’s nothing but beautiful, beautiful love there. I went back to show my support, but, in reality, there were hundreds of people showing up to support me.\n\nTDS: How did Jules Frutose (manager of the Bataclan) react to your being there (after reportedly banning him from the show for making statements Hughes quickly retracted)? Did you guys clear that up?\n\nBAN IN EFFECT? EODM manager says there wasn't one\n\nHUGHES: I never saw the man. Before that even happened, we were on our way to a dinner at some of the fans’ houses and I wanted to see the Bataclan live. It was just a personal need for me to see it reopened. I was very happy and proud, but I had made a mandate before we even drove out there that nobody was going to try to go in. There was a sensitive situation and the most important thing was the anniversary of the event not be tarnished. We got out of the van and I just looked at it. The fans came up and took pictures. A couple of print journalists were there and I explained to them why I didn’t want to go in. An hour later is when I found out the bizarreness had erupted. I can’t speak to what his motives are. I just know that I never even spoke to the dude.\n\nHOMME: With something like this, there are people that end up being at odds because of the bridge that’s burned, and some people respond however they respond. That’s what they have the right to do. We’re not in the business of correcting people.\n\nHUGHES: I didn’t want to get involved with it because I didn’t want to get down in the gutter and arm wrestle with anybody.\n\nHOMME: Jesse’s had to walk a gauntlet where, when you say something, people have their own agendas and they don’t care about you at all. You’re able to take whatever excerpts from this you want, put them together and make new sentences. In this world where people need click bait and have that agenda, walking that gauntlet is very difficult. I was really proud of Jesse.\n\nHUGHES: That was a hard learning curve because I’ve been so outspoken on certain issues (such as support for the Second Amendment), and suddenly this thing happened. At first I had a difficult time learning like, “Ok, this may be my political belief and this may be important to me, but…” I learned really quick that that (bleep) doesn’t matter. Some things are simply appropriate and inappropriate.\n\nHOMME: Intent is everything. In the film, you see Jesse’s statement to the French journalist, where she asks about gun control, and if you read the Guardian, it read very differently than this. You see how quickly things hit the grapevine, and they don’t turn into fruit, man.\n\nTDS: I know it’s difficult to discuss a complex issue in a short interview, so, I appreciate you giving me this time to really talk about this.\n\nHOMME: Stories of occurrences need to be told and they need to be told to people that can get them out to the world and get them out accurately, eloquently and with understanding. You’ve watched this whole music world open up and flower open. You were there. So this kind of understanding, it’s not enough to just do something like what we’re doing. We need people that can tell that story empathetically, honestly, objectively or it never gets known.\n\nTDS: Jesse, you said you just wanted rock ’n’ roll to go back to the way it was for you. You’ve been on the road for a while. Has it gotten to that point?\n\nHUGHES: That was a very scary point for me because I had no delusions… there’s a certain cost to anything and it was very easy for me to see that a cost to this could be (choking up) some of the joy that I feel in this and I was very worried. This is where the beauty of our fans has really protected me because when we started back to touring, I immediately could see in everyone that showed up that they weren’t going to let it slide. They wanted me to be OK. I’m very thankful that I get to have rock ’n’ roll back and I get to have this confidence of knowing that I’m in this gang of people that simply will not suffer the bad guys to (bleep) with us.\n\nHOMME: I also think, too, Bruce, that the importance of going right back out cannot be overstated. That was extremely brave and it’s the right thing to do. You have to take the first step because there’s nothing but question marks. You have to go on tour immediately to survive.\n\nHUGHES: Your chance of success is better when everybody is focused on the same goal, and (voice cracking) it didn’t have to be that way. I didn’t have to have a friend who is the quality that Joshua is. There’s nothing that guarantees that (bleep) in this situation. I’ve felt nothing but the greatest sensation of support and friendship, and there’s a bittersweet element to it. I’m able to see the beauty of all of these things, but, I would really (breaking down) just rather… I just wish I had never had to see them in the first place because it’s never ever going to go away.\n\nHOMME: The fact of the matter is, that event happened. But we are not just that event. So we move forward with respect, acknowledging this and never forgetting and moving on in a way so we’re not defined by that, but it is part of our definition. It’s like, I can’t wait for a new Eagles record. We have to play and create.\n\nTDS: You talk in the movie how you express yourself better through music than words. Do you think your feelings about this will come out in a Queens of the Stone Age or Eagles of Death Metal record?\n\nHOMME: Speaking for myself, I always – and more and more – have been able to say them in a more vulnerable tone, which feels scarier but better. Every record is a marker of where I’m at in my life. More and more I feel I’m just the butler of the music I write. I do whatever it tells me. I don’t question it. I play music and save thousands on therapy.\n\nHUGHES: When you are blessed with the luxury of having friends like I have, and I didn’t have a lot of friends growing up, so (breaking up), I’m so proud of my friends. And the fact that God allows me to take something like that from this awful thing is to me what the lesson is. The way you’re going to get out is going to be defined by how quality your friends are and what standards are important to your game.\n\nHOMME: You know, Boots, I’ve got great friends, too. You really should meet them some day.\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nMovie: \"Eagles of Death Metal Nos Amis (Our Friends)\"\n\nCountry: U.S.\n\nDirector: Colin Hanks\n\nCast: Documentary of the band and fans who survived the 2015 terrorist attacks at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris.\n\nScreenings: 7 p.m. Saturday, Annenberg Theater; 1 p.m. Sunday, Mary Pickford. Hanks is expected to participate in a Q&A Saturday night. Debuting on HBO in February."
