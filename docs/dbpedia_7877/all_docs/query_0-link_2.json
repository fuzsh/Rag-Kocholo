        "text": "Queens Of The Stone Age frontman Josh Homme appeared live with Eagles Of Death Metal.\n\nHomme originally formed the band with Jesse Hughes in 1998, releasing their debut album ‘Peace, Love, Death Metal’ in 2004, followed by ‘Death By Sexy’ in 2006 and ‘Heart On’ in 2008. Due to his commitments to his other bands, however, Homme rarely plays live with the group.\n\nSEE MORE: Josh Homme’s 10 Finest Moments\n\nAt the band’s show at Paris’ Trianon venue on Tuesday night (June 9) though, Hughes was joined onstage by Homme, who played drums for the evening. Watch fan-shot footage from the show below.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEagles Of Death Metal play Download Festival on Sunday (June 14), Glasgow Garage on June 16 and London’s KOKO on June 17. It’s not yet known whether Homme will perform with the group for these shows.\n\nRecommended"
