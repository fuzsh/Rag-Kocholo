        "text": "To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the film Lan Yu (dir. Stanley Kwan 2001), this queer East Asian film classic has been completely restored in 4K version. This autumn, Queer East brings the brand-new version of the film to the UK audience and in cinemas. The Nottingham stop will take place on 3 November; it consists of a public event on the University of Nottingham University Park campus (15:00-16:00, Lecture Theatre A30, Lakeside Arts), followed by a screening and Q&A of the film at the Broadway Cinema Nottingham (17:45). Please join us in the rare opportunity to see this brand-new edition of the film on big screen, to share your love of the film with the film producer, curator and researchers, and to learn about the fascinating stories behind the film, as well as the unusual production and circulation process of one of the best-known queer films in East Asia. The audience will meet Mr Yongning Zhang, producer of the film; Mr Yi Wang, director of the Queer East; and Dr Hongwei Bao, a queer film researcher and author of Queer China.\n\nThis event is organised by Queer East Film Festival and the Centre for Contemporary East Asian Cultural Studies, University of Nottingham. This is an in-person event. Please wear a mask to the event."
