However, due to the film's success, she changed her mind and went on to work on other projects.\n\nLau and Ip had not worked together since 1999's Prince Charming. Production of the film officially began during Chinese New Year. It was filmed in Mei Foo Sun Chuen.[8] Production was wrapped on 6 April 2011 after two months of filming.[9] The film competed in the 68th Venice International Film Festival.[10] It was also selected as the Hong Kong entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards,[11][12] but it did not make the final shortlist.[13] A Simple Life was an official selection for competition at the 68th Venice International Film Festival, where it won 4 awards. Deanie Ip won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress for her role in this film. She is the first Hong Konger to win this prize. In March, she also became the first Hong Konger to win the Asian Film Award for Best Actress. At the same event, director Ann Hui became the first woman to win the Lifetime Achievement Award. At the 31st Hong Kong Film Awards Ceremony, A Simple Life won 5 major prizes (film, director, screenplay, actor, actress), repeating what happened with Hui's Summer Snow in 1996. Ann Hui has won Best Director (4 times) more than anyone else at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Ip is the oldest Best Actress recipient (64 years old at the time of her win).\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nRoger Leung (Andy Lau), an unmarried middle aged Hong Kong film producer, lives with Chung Chun-to (Deanie Ip), a maidservant who has worked for his family for decades. Returning home after a business trip, Roger discovers Chung on the floor and calls for an ambulance. At the hospital, Roger discovers that Chung has had a stroke but rather than ask for rehabilitation, Chung decides she wants to retire and asks to be put in a nursing home. While looking for a nursing home, Roger discovers one nearby that is owned by his friend. He installs Chung there and visits her in between his production jobs. While visiting To, he tells her friends and neighbours that he is her god son in order to explain their connection.\n\nVisiting Chung in the nursing home allows Roger to become closer to her. Eventually, other members of his family, who mostly live abroad, come to visit her. Roger's mother proposes that they renovate an old apartment that the family owns and allow To to spend the remainder of her days there. However, Chung grows more sickly and suffers a second stroke causing her condition to deteriorate and nullifying the family's plans for her.\n\nEventually, Chung is hospitalized a final time and Roger makes the decision to allow her to die. At her funeral, the members of Roger's family pay their respects to her and while Roger delivers the eulogy, a man from the nursing home comes to give her flowers.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nProducer Roger Lee began writing loose fragments together and showed them to director Ann Hui. She persuaded him it was enough for a screenplay and encouraged him through his writing process.\n\nAndy Lau and Deanie Ip were chosen in part because of their close relationship to one another as Ip is Lau's godmother and had already played his mother in several films.[14]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAndy Lau as Roger Leung (梁羅傑), a film producer\n\nDeanie Ip as Sister Peach / Chung Chun-to (桃姐/鍾春桃), a servant\n\nWang Fuli as Roger's mother\n\nQin Hailu as Ms Choi (蔡姑娘), nursing home manager\n\nPaul Chun as Uncle Kin (堅叔) a resident at the nursing home\n\nLeung Tin as Headmaster (校長, a resident at the nursing home\n\nYu Man-si as Sharon, Roger's older sister\n\nEman Lam as Carmen.

He wrote, \"It expresses hope in human nature. It is one of the year's best films.\"[16] Hollywood Reporter's Neil Young wrote that \"Film festivals looking for undemanding crowd-pleasers will want to check it out, even at its currently excessive 118-minute running time – much too long for what is indeed a pretty \"simple\" affair.\"[17] Variety's Justin Chang commented: \"Fittingly for a film about the challenges and rewards of looking after the sick and aging, this well-observed, pleasantly meandering dramedy requires a measure of patience, and some judicious trimming would improve its chances for export. But the moving, never tearjerking lead performances by Andy Lau and Deanie Ip are strong selling points for Hui's following at home and abroad.\"[18]\n\nTop ten lists\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film has appeared on the following critics' top ten lists for the best films of 2012:\n\nCritic Publication Rank Roger Ebert Chicago Sun-Times 10th[19]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Accolades Award / Film Festival Category Recipient(s) Result 68th Venice International Film Festival Golden Lion Ann Hui Nominated Volpi Cup for Best Actress Deanie Ip Won Equal Opportunities Award Ann Hui Won Signis Award – Honorable Mention Ann Hui Won La Navicella Award Ann Hui Won 48th Golden Horse Awards Best Film Focus Films Limited, Sil-Metropole Organisation, Bona Film Group Nominated Best Director Ann Hui Won Best Leading Actor Andy Lau Won Best Leading Actress Deanie Ip Won Best Original Screenplay Susan Chan Nominated Best Film Editing Kwong Chi-leung, Manda Wai Nominated 15th Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival – Official Competition EurAsia Jury Awards Grand Prix for Best Eurasian Film Ann Hui Won Jury Prize for the Best Actress Deanie Ip Won FICC Awards Ann Hui Won 18th Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards Best Film Roger Lee Won Best Director Ann Hui Nominated Best Screenplay Susan Chan Nominated Best Actress Deanie Ip Won 2011 Hong Kong Film Directors' Guild Awards Most Recommended Film of the Year A Simple Life (with Let the Bullets Fly, Overheard 2) Won Most Outstanding Director of the Year Ann Hui (with Jiang Wen, Tsui Hark) Won Special Honour Award Ann Hui Won 6th Asian Film Awards Best Actor Andy Lau Nominated Best Actress Deanie Ip Won People's Choice for Favorite Actor Andy Lau Won People's Choice for Favorite Actress Deanie Ip Nominated Lifetime Achievement Award Ann Hui Won 4th Okinawa International Movie Festival Peace Category: Uminchu Prize Grand Prix Ann Hui Won Jury Special Prize Golden SHISA Award Ann Hui Won 31st Hong Kong Film Awards Best Film Roger Lee, Ann Hui, Chan Pui-wah Won Best Director Ann Hui Won Best Screenplay Susan Chan Won Best Actor Andy Lau Won Best Actress Deanie Ip Won Best Supporting Actor Paul Chun Nominated Best Supporting Actress Qin Hailu Nominated Best Cinematography Yu Lik-wai Nominated 1st Hong Kong Salento International Film Festival Salento Award Deanie Ip Won 12th Chinese Film Media Awards Best Film A Simple Life Nominated Best Director Ann Hui Nominated Best Screenplay Susan Chan Nominated Best Actor Andy Lau Nominated Best Actress Deanie Ip Won Film Honoured by 100 Medias in a Year A Simple Life Won Filmmaker Honoured by 100 Medias in a Year Ann Hui Nominated Filmmaker Honoured by 100 Medias in a Year Andy Lau Nominated 21st Shanghai Film Critics Award Best 10 Chinese Films A Simple Life (with other 9 films) Won Best Director Ann Hui Won 10th Paris International Film Festival Audience's Most Favorite Film Ann Hui Won Best Film Selected by Students Ann Hui Won 9th International Women's Film Festival in Rehovot Best Feature Film Ann Hui Won 33rd Durban International Film Festival Best Actress Award Deanie Ip Won\n\nMy 30 Work Days\n\n[edit]\n\nThe book, My 30 Work Days, was written by Andy Lau extracted from diaries and notes that he wrote while shooting the A Simple Life.
