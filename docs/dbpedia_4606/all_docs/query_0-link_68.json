        "text": "The 45th Hong Kong International Film Festival will honour Stanley Kwan with extensive retrospective\n\nHKIFF45 will celebrate Kwan’s remarkable career by screening 13 of his seminal works. The filmmaker will also attend a Face-to-Face session on 5 April to share his insights on films, art, and life with the public. The retrospective will be accompanied by the publication of a book looking back at Kwan’s career spanning more than 40 years.\n\n“Stanley is an auteur, and we are proud to acknowledge his unique and indelible contributions towards Hong Kong cinema,” enthused Hong Kong International Film Festival Society Executive Director Albert Lee. “He has developed a highly personal aesthetic style in his portrayal of the female psyche while capturing the nuanced transformation of the city and the era. Stanley has set benchmarks for LGBTQ films in Chinese-language cinema with his exploration of gender and sexuality issues.”\n\nStanley Kwan’s films are best known for subtle and nuanced portrayals of female characters. In his works he often revisited the past, 1940s Shanghai or 1960s Hong Kong, but he also explored romance in contemporary times.\n\nKwan began his career in 1979 as assistant director for some of Hong Kong’s emerging New Wave directors, including Peter Yung, Patrick Tam, and Ann Hui. Stanley Kwan shares with Hui the fascination with Eileen Chang’s writing reflected in his adaptation of Red Rose White Rose (1994). Kwan made his directorial debut in 1985 with Women (1985), followed by Love Unto Waste (1986), both focusing on the intricacies of modern love. He quickly anchored his status as a prominent filmmaker, showing a strong auteur style.\n\nKwan scaled the height of his creativeness in the late 1980s with some of his most renowned works. He completed a haunting gothic romance Rouge (1987), featuring the legendary collaboration of Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung. In the stunning Golden Horse Awards winner Full Moon in New York (1989) he focused on different migrant experiences of three women. In Center Stage (1992), through the tragic story of one of the biggest 1930s Chinese stars Ruan Lingyu, he reflected on the complexities of Chinese film stardom. The film is a stunning portrait of 1930s Shanghai film industry, featuring interviews with iconic film stars of classic Chinese cinema. The role in Center Stage brought Maggie Cheung Best Actress Award at Berlinale, making history as the first Chinese actress to receive the Golden Bear.\n\nStanley Kwan further ventured into documentary format in Yang ± Yin: Gender in Chinese Cinema (1996), a film commissioned by the BFI to commemorate the centenary of cinema. In Still Love You After All These (1997) and Lan Yu (2001) Kwan challenged gender norms and explored sexuality, creating nuanced portrayals of He began his long-time partnership with celebrated screenwriter Jimmy Ngai with Hold You Tight (1998), followed by The Island Tales (2000). These two atypical dramas capture the people’s emotional turbulence in tumultuous eras.\n\nIn the new Millennium, Kwan continues to observe and comment on Hong Kong’s dismal state through a subtle resonance in the Shanghai-set Everlasting Regret (2005) based on the book by Wang Anyi. In the late 2000s throughout 2010s he also focused on film production, working on Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China projects among which So Young (2013) directed by Zhao Wei reached status of a box office hit. In 2018, Stanley Kwan returned to directing and completed a nostalgic cinematic tribute to his home city with First Night Nerves.\n\nBeyond directing and producing, Kwan’s oeuvre extends to theatres, TV dramas and short films while also serving as an adjunct professor at the City University of Hong Kong.\n\nHKIFF45 will take a new hybrid format for the first time, featuring screenings and audience-engagement events simultaneously in-theatre and online. The festival will reveal this year’s programme, including admission details for Stanley Kwan’s Face-to-Face session, on 9 March. The tickets can be purchased online on the festival website and through all URBTIX outlets from 18 March.\n\nHKIFF45 is also delighted to announce the collaboration with Moleskine, the festival’s long-term partner, in creating a special edition notebook celebrating the director’s remarkable achievements in filmmaking.\n\nStanley Kwan’s Retrospective to feature:\n\n1985 Women\n\n1986 Love Unto Waste\n\n1987 Rouge\n\n1989 Full Moon in New York\n\n1992 Center Stage (Director’s Cut)\n\n1994 Red Rose White Rose\n\n1996 Yang ± Yin: Gender in Chinese Cinema\n\n1997 Still Love You After All These\n\n1998 Hold You Tight\n\n2000 The Island Tales\n\n2001 Lan Yu\n\n2005 Everlasting Regret\n\n2018 First Night Nerves"
