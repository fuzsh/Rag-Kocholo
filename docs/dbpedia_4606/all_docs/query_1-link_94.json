        "text": "There are some things I’m just too old to understand and I guess the love of K-Pop is one of them. But I did get a chuckle at how invested so many young people were in waiting and hoping for a K-Pop star to emerge at Seoul Gimpo Airport.\n\nK-Pop Paparazzi Eagerly Waits At Seoul Gimpo Airport\n\nAs we were walking out of the baggage claim at Seoul Gimpo, I was surprised to see hundreds of people–mostly young women–waiting outside the sliding doors in the arrivals lobby. All had cameras or camera phones and some even had ladders.\n\nMy colleague explained they were waiting for K-Pop (Korean pop music) stars…and that this has become so bad that Kroean Air and Asiana, the two South Korean carriers, have specifically restricted refunds on tickets once passengers make their way to the secure area of the airport (past security and immigration).\n\nIt seems that many young people were booking refundable premium cabin tickets in order to go on the hunt for K-Pop stars in the airport lounges, gate area and even onboard. Yes, in many cases the fans would book first class tickets, board the flight, ask for pictures with the K-Pop star, then cancel their tickets before boarding was complete and request a refund.\n\nThe problem became so bad that Korean Air greatly increased the cost of a last-minute cancellation fee in 2018. These days, most fans are not engaging in those sorts of tricks, but many are still hoping to catch a glimpse of their favorite star after arrival.\n\nI stopped to take a picture of the photographers to which I received a fairly laughable response: many shielded their faces or turned away after they saw I was taking pictures.\n\nWhat’s good for the goose is good for the gander…?\n\nLiving in LA, I’m a bit surprised I do not see more of the same thing at Los Angeles International Airport. But with PS (Private Suite) at LAX, any major celebrity is going to bypass the public (heck, even some of my Award Expert clients, who are much lower on the celebrity food chain, use it too).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf you’re traveling into Seoul Gimpo or Incheon airports, keep an eye out for the paparazzi hoping for a glimpse of their favorite K-Pop star. It’s another interesting cultural quirk of traveling in South Korea."
