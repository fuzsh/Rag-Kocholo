        "text": "Kwan's style is cool and complex, and he tells his story urgently. History intrudes; in a central sequence set in 1989, Handong bumbles into the retreat from the army raid on the protest at Tiananmen Square. The raid is depicted as a midnight rally of desperately speeding bicycles, illuminated in car headlights and police floodlights. After Tiananmen, Handong becomes a rich member of the post-Mao business hierarchy. Even so, we can't hate him. Though facing the world with the closed-off, grave face of a man in authority, the actor Hu Jun eloquently suggests the fear and personal repression that underlies arrogance.\n\nJimmy Ngai's script is tightly written; the terseness, however, comes at the expense of time sequences. Sometimes the viewer (and maybe it's just the Western viewer) gets stuck trying to figure out how much time has passed since the last scene. (Jean Renoir's films have this same trouble.) Still, in this ambitious film, the scope of changing life and lifestyles is compelling right up to the last memorable shot: a view of Beijing seen from a speeding car window, a zoetrope of concrete freeway pillars, strobing the street scenes viewed through it. The film is named after a goodhearted courtesan who becomes so much more than just that. But the novel's title is borne out here, too. Though glimpsed in the backgrounds, the city of Beijing has a life of its own in this movie. Lan Yu (Unrated; 86 min.), directed by Stanley Kwan, written by Jimmy Ngai, based on the Internet novel, photographed by Tao Yang and starring Liu Ye and Hu Jun, opens Friday at the Towne Theater in San Jose.
