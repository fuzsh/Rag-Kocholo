        "text": "Film censorship in China involves the banning of films which are deemed unsuitable for release and it also involves the editing of such films and the removal of content which is objected to by the governments of China. In April 2018, films were reviewed by the China Film Administration (CFA) under the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) which dictates whether, when, and how a movie gets released.[1][2] The CFA is separate from the National Radio and Television Administration under the State Council.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n1923 to 1949\n\n[edit]\n\nThe beginning of film censorship in China came in July 1923, when the \"Film Censorship Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association\" [note 1] was established in Jiangsu. The committee set out specific requirements for film censorship, such as that films must be submitted for review, and that films that failed to pass must be deleted and corrected, or else they would not be allowed to be screened. However, since the committee was a non-government organization and was mostly composed of educators, film makers did not comply with the requirements, which made film censorship ineffective.[3]: p.7–8\n\nIn 1926, after the Hangzhou Film Censorship Board, this was the most specific censorship procedure in recorded history and the first film censorship organization to cooperate fully with the police. The Beijing government also established the Film Censorship Committee in the same year. The censorship included issues of morality and crime, as well as indecency, obstruction of diplomatic relations, and \"insult to China\". However, the Chinese government is not able to extend its jurisdiction over localities, and the effect of film censorship is limited.[3]: p.7–8\n\nIn July 1930, the Nationalist Government established the Film and Drama Censorship Committee [note 2] in Nanjing. In 1931, the Executive Yuan passed the Film Censorship Law, and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior of the Nanjing Government jointly established the Film Censorship Committee. In May 1934, the Film Censorship Council was reorganized into the Central Film Censorship Committee,[note 3] which became the official film censorship Institution.[3]: p.9–10\n\nThe 1930s were a period of nationalism in China. Patriotic sentiment was strong in China, and the Kuomintang government often accused foreign films of insulting China. For example, the 1934 release of the American film \"Welcome Danger\" was accused by Hong Shen of degrading the Chinese and he had a dispute with the cinema manager. The film was eventually banned by the Kuomintang government.[3]: p.9–10\n\nIn addition to crimes and insults to China, pornography was also one of banned contents. In 1932, the \"Outline of the Enforcement of the Film Censorship Law\"[note 4] had vague and ambiguous provisions: depicting obscene and unchaste acts; depicting those who use tricks or violence against the opposite sex to satisfy their lust; depicting incest directly or indirectly; depicting women undressed and naked in an abnormal manner; depicting women giving birth or abortion. All were prohibited.[3]: p.9–10\n\nIn the 1940s, the ROC government sought to prevent the release of Hollywood films which it viewed as insulting to China or Chinese people.[4]\n\nFor the film censorship after December 7, 1949, please see the film censorship of the Republic of China after 1949 section.\n\n1949 to 1988\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1949, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was established. The department in charge of films was changed from the \"Central Propaganda Bureau of the Communist Party of China\"[note 5] to the \"Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government\"[note 6]. In 1954, it was renamed as the \"Ministry of Culture Film Bureau\". During the Cultural Revolution, film work came to a halt.[5]: p.23–24\n\nIn the 1980s, video tapes and television were gradually introduced into China. The Ministry of Radio and Television of the State Council led the censorship process. In 1986, the ministry in charge of films was changed from the Ministry of Culture to the Ministry of Radio and Television, resulting in a confusing pattern of multiple management.[5]: p.23–24\n\nIn 1987, the State Council intended to centralize the management of the broadcasting, film, and television industries, but the intended legislation was temporarily suspended in the face of political turmoil.[5]: p.29\n\n1993 to 2017\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: § Film public screening permit\n\nIn 1993, a preliminary draft of the Film Regulations was sent to film studios throughout China for comments, and the Bureau of Legislative Affairs of the State Council coordinated with the Ministry of Propaganda, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Finance, and the Press and Publication Administration to revise the submitted draft repeatedly. In May 1996, after several discussions, the State Administration of Radio and Television (SARFT) confirmed that the film regulations would be promulgated by the State Council, and on May 29, the Standing Committee of the State Council approved the Film Regulation, which came into effect on July 1, 1996. However, the 1996 film regulations soon failed to keep up with the development of the film industry, and China was actively seeking to join the WTO to comply with the open-door policy. The Ministry of Radio, Film and Television prepared a new version of the draft, and on December 25, 2001, the Standing Committee of the State Council approved the amendments and issued a new version of the Film Administration Regulations, which came into effect on February 1, 2002, and repealed the 1996 version.[5]: p.29–30\n\nThe 2001 regulations already require studios to conduct self-censorship when preparing their productions, and after self-censorship, scripts must be submitted to the SARFT for the record. The film must be submitted for review and approval before it is issued with a Film Public Screening Permit.[5]: p.58–59\n\nAfter 2015, China strengthened the standards of control over film legislation. On October 12, 2015, the NPC's Committee on Science, Education, Culture and Health deliberated on the draft proposed by the State Council at the NPC Standing Committee. After three deliberations, in October 2016, the 12th NPC Standing Committee confirmed that it could be adopted with one amendment, and on November 3, 2016, a meeting was held to conclude the matter. The passage of the Film Industry Promotion Law is getting closer and closer.[5]: p.76–82\n\nIn January 2017, the SARFT issued a notice to its affiliated units throughout China to promote the Law, and on March 1, the Film Industry Promotion Law came into effect.[5]: p.84\n\n2018 to present\n\n[edit]\n\nIn March 2018, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided its publicity department would centralize the film management, taking that responsibility away from SAPPRFT,[6] the latter of which was renamed National Radio and Television Administration.[7][8] In April 2018, the department formally put up a China Film Administration sign.[9] The consequences of this institutional change soon became apparent for industry insiders. Instead of resisting the Chinese state, they were induced to collaborate and practice \"complicit creativity,\" which entails concession, reconfiguration, and collusion.[2]\n\nIndian films were de facto banned from theatrical release in China in 2020 and 2021 due to border skirmishes in addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\nOn June 11, 2021, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region announced that effective that day that it would begin censoring films according to the requirements from Hong Kong national security law, bringing itself more in line with the rest of the country.[11][12]\n\nIn July 2024, the China Film Administration announced that all short films may only appear at foreign film festivals or exhibitions if they obtain permits for public screenings.[13]\n\nFilm public screening permit\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Film Public Screening Permit (Chinese: 电影公映许可证) is issued by the Chinese film censorship department. Since July 1, 1996, films shot locally in China and films imported from abroad must be reviewed and filed in China before they can be released.[5]: 29\n\nAccording to the Motion Picture Association of America's handbook, Hollywood producers who want to co-produce with Chinese must also apply for a permit before they can be released in China.[14]\n\nQuota for foreign films\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Chinese censorship department's restrictions on the importation of foreign films were also under pressure from the United States,: p.67–68 and China's position in the post-Cold War world had to be recognized by the United States. In 1999, China and the United States reached a bilateral agreement on WTO accession, and all countries except the United States opposed the inclusion of film and television products in the WTO's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, with Hollywood's lobbying group pushing China to neither obey nor ignore this rule, China increased the quota for foreign films in accordance with the U.S.-China agreement. Just before the agreement was reached, the U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia resulted in a five-month ban on U.S. films in China.[5]: p.53–55\n\nIn February 2012, China and the U.S. signed the Memorandum of Understanding between China and the U.S. on the Resolution of WTO Film-Related Issues (the U.S.-China Film Agreement), based on the 1999 agreement. The main content of the agreement is that the import quota for 20 Hollywood films can be unchanged, and 14 commercial films (3D or IMAX) can be added.[5]: p.67–68\n\nThe passage of the Film Industry Promotion Act was the cause of China's anti-WTO lawsuit. Back in April 2007, the U.S. requested China to lift restrictions on the import of movies, music and books. After unsuccessful negotiations, the U.S. requested the WTO to establish a trade dispute resolution panel. In December 2009, the Appellate Body upheld the decision, finding that China's restrictions violated WTO member states' obligations and could not be justified on the grounds of protecting public morals. That is, China did violate the restrictions on U.S. entertainment products. China's appeal on the grounds of protecting its citizens, especially minors, from harmful information such as pornography was not accepted. The BBC also reported that if China does not change its current practices within two years, the U.S. has the right to request WTO authorization to impose trade sanctions on China.[5]: p.67–68\n\nList of suspected banned or unreleased films\n\n[edit]\n\nBelow are films that may be banned or self-censored and not released. For official bans and specific reasons at the government level, see List of films banned in China.\n\nTitle Original release year Country of origin Notes The Ten Commandments 1923 United States Banned in the 1930s under a category of \"superstitious films\" due to its religious subject matter involving gods and deities.[15] Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ 1925 United States Banned in the 1930s under a category of \"superstitious films\" due to its religious subject matter involving gods and deities.[15] Frankenstein 1931 United States Banned under a category of \"superstitious films\" due to its \"strangeness\" and unscientific elements.[15] Alice in Wonderland 1933 United States Banned under a category of \"superstitious films\" due to its \"strangeness\" and unscientific elements.[15] The Unfinished Comedy 1957 China Banned for undermining socialist morality and attacking the Party.[16][17] Ben-Hur 1959 United States Banned under the regime of Mao Zedong for containing \"propaganda of superstitious beliefs, namely Christianity.\"[18][19] Chung Kuo, Cina 1972 Italy Banned for 32 years for \"anti-Chinese.\"[20] Yellow Earth 1984 China Banned then released.[21] Back to the Future 1985 United States The film was banned because of time travel.[22] The Horse Thief 1986 China The film waited eight months for approval for public release. Ultimately, director Tian Zhuangzhuang told officials that he would re-edit the film to their specifications, and he worked under the close supervision of two censors to cut footage, including portions of a sky burial.[23][24] Tian felt the process was an \"insult\" and turned temporarily to commercial filmmaking out of frustration with the censors.[23][25] The released film was later withdrawn.[21] Ju Dou 1990 China Banned upon initial release, but lifted in 1992.[21][26] The Chinese government gave permission for its viewing in July 1992.[27] Mama 1990 China Released in China after a two-year ban.[28] Life on a String 1991 China Banned altogether.[21] Raise the Red Lantern 1991 China Banned upon initial release, released three years later.[21] I Have Graduated 1992 China A documentary about some university students who experienced the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.[29] Beijing Bastards 1993 China Banned due to subjects involving homosexuality and alienated young people.[30] Farewell My Concubine 1993 China The film was objected to for its portrayal of homosexuality, suicide, and violence perpetrated under Mao Zedong's Communist government during the Cultural Revolution. It premiered in Shanghai in July 1993 but was removed from theatres after two weeks for further censorial review and subsequently banned in August. Because the film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the ban was met with international outcry.[31] Feeling there was \"no choice\" and fearing it hurt China's bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, officials allowed the film to resume public showings in September. This release featured a censored version; scenes dealing with the Cultural Revolution and homosexuality were cut, and the final scene was revised to \"soften the blow of the suicide\".[32] To Live 1994 China Banned due to its critical portrayal of various policies and campaigns of the Communist government. In addition, its director Zhang Yimou was banned from filmmaking for two years.[21][33][34] The ban on the film was lifted only in September 2008 after Zhang directed the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.[35] The Square 1994 China The director was banned on all film-making earlier in the year.[36] Weekend Lover 1995 China Banned for two years and then released.[37] Father 1996 China Also known as Baba/Babu,[21] it was banned, but took home the top prize Golden Leopard at the Locarno Festival in 2000.[38] East Palace, West Palace 1997 China Banned due to subjects involving homosexuality and alienated young people.[30] Babe: Pig in the City 1998 United States Censor had a policy that live-action animals shown being able to speak were not allowed to be depicted.[39] Lan Yu 2001 China The film was banned for homosexuality, references to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, and depiction of corruption in Beijing entrepreneurs.[40][41] Conjugation 2001 China Directed by Emily Tang, it is a fictional film about the challenges faced by a young couple in the post-1989 Tiananmen Square protests era.[29] Brokeback Mountain 2005 United States The film was banned for homosexuality, a \"sensitive topic\". China even censored Ang Lee's Academy Award for Best Director acceptance speech for references to homosexuality.[42] King and the Clown 2005 South Korea The film was not shown in theaters due to \"subtle gay themes\" and sexually explicit language. It was given permission for distribution on DVD.[43] V for Vendetta 2005 United States Starting in Aug 2020, the movie has been removed from China's major online video platforms, such as iQiyi, Tencent Video, Sohu, Douban, and Maoyan, because of anti-government themes. The Guy Fawkes mask worn by the film character V has been used as a symbol in anti-extradition bill protests in Hong Kong.[44] The movie was never shown in Chinese theaters, but it was unclear whether it had ever been banned prior to 2020. State-owned China Movie Channel surprised viewers back in 2012 by airing it, leading to false hopes about censorship reform.[45] An article on the Communist party's China Youth Daily website said it was previously prohibited from broadcast,[46] but the Associated Press quoted the then censors's spokesman Wu Baoan (吴保安) who said he was not aware of any ban. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest 2006 United States Banned in China because it had spirits swarming around as well as depictions of cannibalism.[47] The Dark Knight 2008 United States Warner Bros. did not submit the film to censors for approval, citing \"pre-release conditions\" and \"cultural sensitivities\".[48] Petition 2009 China The documentary depicts brutalization, harassment, and arrest of people who travel to Beijing to ask that wrongdoing by local officials be amended. The film was banned in China immediately following its premiere at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.[49][50] Spring Fever 2009 Hong Kong\n\nFrance\n\nThe film was created during a five-year ban instituted on director Lou Ye and producer Nai An, and it showed at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival and in international theaters without permission. It portrays a gay romance, explicit sexual scenes and full-frontal nudity.[51] Red Dawn 2012 United States The film was not released in China, despite changing the invading antagonist from China to North Korea.[52] A Touch of Sin 2013 China The film depicts \"shocking\" violence in China caused by economic inequality and political corruption, including the shooting of local officials. During development of the film, censors asked director Jia Zhangke to revise dialogue and seemed generally unconcerned by violence. Censors did recommend Jia decrease the number of killings but allowed it when Jia refused. The film was cleared for foreign distribution and showed at international festivals. Although the film was initially cleared for local distribution, the film did not open in China on its release date and a directive was given telling journalists not to write about the film. The distributor Xstream Pictures released a statement saying it did not receive a notice the film was banned and that it was continuing to work on local distribution.[53] World War Z 2013 United Kingdom, United States The movie contains zombies and has a lead role featuring Brad Pitt, whose films and entry to the country were disallowed after he starred in Seven Years in Tibet.[54] Top Gun 3D 2013 United States The re-release got the silent treatment by the censor.[55] The congressional United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission concluded it portrayed U.S. military dominance.[52] Captain Phillips 2013 United States In hacked emails, Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution at Sony Pictures, suggested that the plot of American military saving Chinese citizen would make Chinese censor uncomfortable.[56] The direct-to-video was approved.[57] Noah 2014 United States Banned for the depiction of prophets.[58] Crimson Peak 2015 United States It was reported that the film may be banned because it contained ghosts and supernatural elements.[59][60] However, Chinese artist and social commentator Aowen Jin believed it more likely that the film was banned due to sexual content and incest.[61] Mad Max: Fury Road 2015 Australia,\n\nUnited States\n\nSubmitted and rejected by censors, possibly due to its dystopian themes.[62] The direct-to-video somehow got approval.[63] Call Me by Your Name 2017 United States Due to homosexuality,[64][65] the film was pulled from the Beijing International Film Festival.[66] Christopher Robin 2018 United States While no official reason was given for denying the film's release, images of Winnie-the-Pooh were previously censored and banned since 2017 after social media users compared Pooh to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, causing the character to become associated with political resistance. However, an alternative theory suggested the film was denied because a number of Hollywood tentpole films were competing for space in the limited foreign film quota.[67] Berlin, I Love You 2019 Germany Ai Weiwei claimed that the producers were politically pressured to cut the segment he directed because distributors fears his involvement would hurt the film in China. He directed the segment remotely while under house arrest in China for his political activism.[68][69] Joker 2019 United States Not cleared for release.[70][11] Monster Hunter 2020 United States Soon after the release in China on Dec 3, the film was pulled from theaters because a scene featuring a banter between MC Jin's character and his military comrade was considered racially offensive by local audience, despite the Chinese subtitles interpreted it differently. Jin jokingly said: \"Look at my knees!\" which is followed by the question \"What kind of knees are these?\" He then answered, \"Chi-knees!\" Some Chinese viewers interpreted this as a reference to the racist playground chant \"Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees\", and therefore as an insult to China. The subtitles, however, interpreted as there is gold under a man's knees, so man should not easily kneel. The film was removed from circulation, and Chinese authorities censored references to it online. Tencent Pictures, which is handling local distribution and is an equity partner in the film, is reported to be remedying the situation, but it remains unclear if the movie would then be re-released.[71] Inside the Red Brick Wall 2021 Hong Kong A sold-out theatrical premiere of the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests documentary featuring the siege of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University was canceled.[72] Where the Wind Blows 2021 Hong Kong Its world premiere at the 45th Hong Kong International Film Festival was pulled for \"technical reasons\".[72][73][74] The film ultimately received approval and premiered at the 46th Hong Kong International Film Festival.[75] It was released in cinemas on February 5, 2023, in China and February 17 in Hong Kong.[76] Tony Leung Chiu-wai won Best Actor for his role in the film at the Asian Film Awards on March 12, 2023.[77]\n\nList of edited films\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Release year in mainland China Country of origin Notes Titanic 1998 United States The scene in which Rose (Kate Winslet) poses nude for a painting is altered to show her from the neck up, removing her breasts from the shot.[78] Infernal Affairs 2002 Hong Kong The ending sees a triad member who has infiltrated the police shoot a member of his gang to prevent becoming exposed. It was unacceptable in China for a criminal to avoid justice, and three endings were shot for censors to approve. In the chosen ending, the mole is confronted by police and he voluntarily gives up his police badge.[79][80] Running on Karma 2003 Hong Kong It ran afoul of Beijing censors for depicting a Chinese protagonist (Cecilia Cheung) reincarnated from a Japanese soldier. Such a premise, though overtly comedic, offends a Chinese government to whom Sino-Japanese relations remain fractious. According to the film's co-writer Au Kin-yee, SAPPRFT – ever vigilant against superstition – also objected to the male hero's preternatural ability to perceive the past lives of others. Consequently, the Milkyway Image creative team excised the male hero's extrasensory 'visions' from the mainland release, resulting in nonsensical stretches of action.[81] Mission: Impossible III 2006 United States Censors felt that the film's establishing shot of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) walking past underwear hung from a clothesline was a negative portrayal of Shanghai.[82] Babel 2006 Multinational coproduction Censors cut five minutes of nudity scenes.[83] Casino Royale 2006 Multinational coproduction Judi Dench as M said she had to substitute the line \"'God, I miss the old times\" for \"Christ, I miss the Cold War\" for release to be allowed in China.[84] The Departed 2006 United States Banned from movie theaters for suggesting that the Chinese government might use nuclear weapons against Taiwan,[22] but the direct-to-video got approval (after cutting a few minutes).[85] Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End 2007 United States Captain Sao Feng, played by Chow Yun-fat, demonizes the Chinese and Singapore.[86][87] Lust, Caution 2007 Multinational coproduction Censors objected to the film's \"political and sexually provocative content\" and criticized the film as a \"glorification of traitors and insulting to patriots\". Seven minutes of sexually graphic scenes were cut by director Ang Lee. Actress Tang Wei was subsequently banned from Chinese media, and award shows were advised to remove her and the film's producers from guest lists. Online mentions of the film and Tang were removed.[88] Iron Man 2 2010 United States Words for \"Russia\" and \"Russian\" were left untranslated in the subtitles, and the spoken words were muffled.[89] Titanic 3D 2012 United States The film is again altered to remove Rose's breasts from the scene in which she poses nude for a painting.[78] Satirical jokes attributed the following explanation for the cuts to an SAPPRFT official: 3D effects would cause audiences to \"reach out their hands for a touch and thus interrupt other people's viewing\".[90] Mystery 2012 China The film was edited for release in China. In response, director Lou Ye removed his name from the film and published his negotiations with the censorship bureau onto Weibo.[91] Men in Black 3 2012 United States An alien disguised as a Chinese restaurant worker was offensive for the screen. 13 minutes were claimed to be cut.[citation needed] Looper 2012 United States Despite the added Chinese element, the deputy head from SAPPRFT criticized a string of films for not obeying the co-production rules.[92] Skyfall 2013 United Kingdom A scene in which James Bond (Daniel Craig) kills a security guard in Shanghai was cut for referencing prostitution in Macau, which was felt to be \"morally or politically damaging\" and because it was felt to suggest China cannot defend itself.[82][93] Cloud Atlas 2013 Germany, United States Scenes with sexual content involving straight and gay couples were cut. Thirty-eight minutes, roughly twenty percent of the film's original runtime, was removed.[94][95] Iron Man 3 2013 United States Four minutes of Chinese scenes were added to the local version for \"an easier ride with Chinese film censors\". They include a product placement from Mengniu Dairy, claiming the milk is good for Iron Man, and additions of Chinese doctors into a surgery scene to \"court Chinese censors\".[82][96] Django Unchained 2013 United States Violent scenes were altered.[97][98] No Man's Land 2013 China The film, completed in 2010, underwent a three-and-a-half-year approval process.[99] It experienced two major revisions to reduce violent content and clarify thematic intention, and it was reported that the film was removed from release schedules six times.[100] Parasyte: Part 1 and Parasyte: Part 2 2014 & 2015 Japan The 2-part film from 2014 and 2015 was merged into one single release in China in 2016, cutting more than 100 minutes of bloody and violent scenes.[citation needed] Kingsman: The Secret Service 2015 United Kingdom Scenes were cut due to violent and sexual content.[101] The Revenant 2016 United States Thirty seconds are rumored to have been cut.[102] Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children 2016 United States A scene in which the characters enjoy an \"eyeball feast\" was cut.[103] Hacksaw Ridge 2016 Australia, United States Fewer than thirty seconds of graphic violence were cut.[104] Resident Evil: The Final Chapter 2017 Multinational coproduction Seven or eight minutes[54] were cut due to graphic violence and blood.[105] Logan 2017 United States Scenes were removed for violence and \"brief nudity\". The film was also the first affected by the PRC Film Industry Promotion Law effective on March 1, 2017, which requires the film to include a warning for minors in marketing materials.[106] Love Off the Cuff 2017 Hong Kong Crude jokes were removed from the film.[107] Alien: Covenant 2017 United States Six minutes is scenes which titular aliens covered in blood were cut, leaving \"one to two minutes\" of the creatures in the film. Other scenes involving violence were also altered.[108] The gay kiss scene between two androids David and Walter was also cut.[105] Bohemian Rhapsody 2019 United Kingdom, United States The film was approved for a limited release after one minute of content was cut. This content involved drug use and the male lead character Freddie Mercury kissing other men.
