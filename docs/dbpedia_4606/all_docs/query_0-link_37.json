        "text": "Cinema censorship is a relatively unexplored topic in the discipline of surveillance studies. While movies are frequent references throughout the scholarship, such citations tend to be limited to plot and imagery and overlook the ways in which the medium can be subject to state intervention or other forms of censorship and self-censorship. This essay uses the case of the 2015 Hong Kong independent film Ten Years to explore how cinema deserves to be considered alongside other media and communications whose vulnerability to institutional control and monitoring are already widely documented by surveillance studies. The film, which reflects Hong Kong residents' critique of mounting Chinese power, was the object of an aggressive vilification and repression campaign by the mainland Chinese government. It also spawned a grassroots defense in which audiences and filmmakers mobilized around the film as a symbol and site of civic discourse and political critique. Using the concepts of participatory media and online activism and connecting Ten Years with Hong Kong's 2014 \" Umbrella \" protests against Chinese rule, this essay shows how cinema invites the same interventions and interactivity as social media and other digital or communications technologies. Indeed, because Ten Years' history of populist activism resembles well-known instances of media mobilization such as the Arab Spring and Black Lives Matter, this essay demonstrates not only cinema's multiple dimensions of relevance for surveillance studies but also uncovers new global spaces whose film history will diversify surveillance studies.\n\nThis study considers Chinese youth cinema as a historical object that represents the gamut of social practices and styles of production. The youth films produced in the major Chinese regions—Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong—illustrate how much social practices dominated the film content and style. For instance, youth genre in Hong Kong, once prevalent in the Cantonese cinema of the mid and late 1960s, blended musical and melodrama by dormant with the rise of martial art films. The authors examine the historical development of young people for tracing how different social and historical contexts interpret Chinese young people's world. This study attempts to elaborate some films featuring young people in Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and to review the histories of youth cinema in these Chinese regions. Chinese youth film outlines how, in Chinese communities, the category of youth historically functions as a significant site of ideological inscription that displays its struggles towards an idealized future.\n\nHomosexuality has been a controversial topic globally for the last decade. Many countries have slowly accepted the emergence of homosexual relationships, some more than others, but in some countries it remains a sensitive subject. For mainland China, it is generally believed that the Chinese government adopts a ‘3-no’ policy – no approval, no disapproval, and no promotion. Homosexuality has mainly been developing as an underground phenomena. Homosexuality in Hong Kong on the other hand is much more visible and relatively more accepted than in mainland China. Taiwan has been the most progressive region, developing a visible homosexual subculture and literary movement. In this thesis I look at the historical development and the cinematic development of homosexuality in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan and specifically at the portrayal of homosexuality in two Chinese-language films, Stanley Kwan's Lan Yu and Zero Chou's Ci Qing.\n\nThis book focuses on the youth film is an invention of the 1950s in Chinese communities. Also, this book discusses in the second half of the decade starting in the year 2000 appeared certain youth styles/images and promoted certain perspectives on young people’s psychological well-being. By giving Chinese youth more ‘power’ of selfidentification, youth films in recent decades have begun to place more responsibility on young characters to deal with their journey through adolescence. This journey offers any number of directions and route, but their destination is always to approach maturity. Timothy Shary initiated his earlier academic study on ‘teen film’. His work on gender continued in studies of youth cinema. His works inspired the author of this book to look at the development of youth genre in Chinese context, as well as to give a more precise definition of Chinese youth genre and sub-genres."
