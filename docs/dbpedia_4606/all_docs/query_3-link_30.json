        "text": "STAFF WRITER\n\nRated R, directed by Stanley Kwan, with Hu Jun (Handong), Su Jin (Lan Yu), Li Huatong, Lu Fang, Zhang Yongning, running time: 86 minutes.\n\nHong Kong director Stanley Kwan's (關錦鵬) Lan Yu (藍宇) was nominated in nine categories at this year's Golden Horse. It is Kwan's first film dealing with the sentiments of a gay romance since making his own sexual orientation public three years ago. Lan Yu is about a 30-something business man, Handong, who meets a university student named Lan Yu in Beijing. Handong discovers Lan Yu's sexual orientation and is offered his first romantic encounter with a man. But with the class separation dividing them, Lan Yu knows the relationship is doomed. They endlessly argue and make up, but Handong ultimately marries a woman. Their several encounters after Handong's divorce prove that he cannot forget about Lan Yu and so tries going back to him."
