        "text": "Overview\n\nAppearance[]\n\nShe had delicate facial features and her light blue eyes resembled the sea. There was an aura of heroism around her as her curvaceous body was covered in silver armor engraved with gorgeous decorative designs beyond comparison.\n\nAfter changing clothes[]\n\nThe traditional Chinese skirt alternating between blue and white accentuated Lan Yu's seductive curves. On the other hand, her long silver hair was simply bunched up on the back of her head.\n\nHer skin was smooth and fair whereas her eyebrows resembled jade feathers. Above all, her light blue eyes were bewitching; they were clear and bright and seemed as though they were hiding shining stars in them.[1]\n\nBackground[]\n\nWinged Humans were one of the races on Firmament Star. Every single Winged Human was valiant and excellent at fighting, and they even possessed an outstanding gift in cultivation.\n\nSkills[]\n\nStatic Light Fist[2]\n\nJudgement of Light[3]\n\nEndless Shining Light - Daoist Physique transformation.[4]\n\nDivine Cosmos Illumination[5]\n\nHoly Divine Fire Art - The version of the Holy Divine Fire Art cultivated by Lan Yu was… Incomplete![6]\n\nHoly Light Barricade[7]\n\nHeavenly God Ray - Human combat technique.[1]\n\nRadiant River[8]\n\nWeapons[]\n\nScepter of Light[9] - Sage Ruler weapon.\n\n\"This staff is known as the Scepter of Light. It belonged to a Sage Ruler and hero named the Holy King 50 thousand years ago.\"\n\nHeavenly Skylight Scepter[10] - was an Immortal Weapon with growing potential.\n\nIts initial level was an Earthern Immortal Weapon, but it could continue to improve with its master's cultivation. Eventually, it could be comparable to the Source Supreme Treasure.\n\nTrivia[]\n\n“Radiant is my Dao, and War is my duty. Radiant War Source is the most fitting source energy for me,” she said with a smile.[11]\n\nPlot (Contains Spoilers)[]\n\n\"Winged Human Race. The age has been set to 12 years old and the cultivation level is at Nascent Soul. Oh, it’s even equipped with the Supreme Daoist Physique, Holy Radiant Physique… It’s no surprise then that this character has been determined to be Legendary grade when they’re only at the Nascent Soul stage…”\n\nFrom now on, let’s call you… Lan Yu.[12]\n\nDuring the opening of Emperor Road, she ended up getting separated from Chu Kuangren and the other disciples of Black Heaven Sect, however when she reappeared once more she had become the newly-appointed Maiden Sage of the Holy Light Religion.[13]\n\nDuring her ascension to the Emperor Realm she having obtained a High-grade Emperor's Core while her Dao has reached a Flawless quality.[14]\n\nAfter the Fragmented Immortal World appeared she, Chu Hong and Shang Honghua left Firmament Star for an adventure.\n\nHowever, they found the Beasthunter Planet men who had been keeping an eye on in her and Chu Hong, thinking of capturing the two girls. Fortunately, all three managed to escape with the help of various life-saving items, but unfortunately, they got separated in the process.\n\nSoon after she arrived at Planquilon Immortal World, she heard news about Chu Kuangren, however, before she could meet Chu Kuangren, she once again encountered the people of Beasthunter Planet in Heavenly Web City, knowing that she was no match for them, she then made a risky gamble and ignited her life essence by releasing her aura to the maximum, hoping that Chu Kuangren could sense it and save her.[15]\n\nShe obtained the inheritance of the Immortal World Winged Human.[16]\n\nShe revealed that the girl inside the cocoon of light earlier was the strongest among the Winged Human Tribe of the Immortal World. She fell during the previous era, but somehow managed to keep her Immortal Physique and Immortal Consciousness intact through some methods. She stayed behind and patiently waited to pass on the inheritance, which was from the Winged Human Tribe.\n\nAs a consequence Lan Yu’s Holy Radiant Physique has now transformed into something called the Radiant War Immortal Physique. It was created by the powerful Winged Human using the Immortal Physique and Immortal Consciousness for Lan Yu. It was the strongest Immortal Physique of the Winged Human Tribe.[17]"
