This paper aimed to examine the issue of male gay representation in modern mainland Chinese cinema. In the context of an emergent gay identity in China, it is interesting to analyse how directors have both reflected the status of homosexuality in China and attempted to change that status. For this purpose, an introduction to the history of homosexuality in China was provided, as well as a discussion of the most predominant theories regarding the construction of modern Chinese gay identities. Subsequently, a qualitative analysis of three films was carried out: Farewell My Concubine (1993), Lan Yu (2001) and The Old Testament (2002). This study found that the repetition of gloomy themes in these films, such as prostitution and gay death, greatly diminish their potential to effect a positive impact in the status of homosexuality in China, and stressed the need for a new kind of gay representation which provides a more optimistic attitude towards the issue.",
