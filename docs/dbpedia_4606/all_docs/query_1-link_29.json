        "text": "Chinese actor\n\nLiu Ye (Chinese: 刘烨; pinyin: Líu Yè, born 23 March 1978) is a Chinese actor. He made his feature film debut in Postmen in the Mountains (1999),[1] and later on won recognition through critically acclaimed film Lan Yu (2001), which earned him the Best Actor award at the Golden Horse Awards.[2][3] His other notable works include the film Cock and Bull (2016), as well as the television series Blood Color Romance (2005) and All Quiet in Peking (2014).\n\nHe was ranked 78th on Forbes China Celebrity 100 list in 2013,[4] 48th in 2014,[5] and 89th in 2015.[6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nLiu began his acting career as a student majoring in performing arts at the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing. He made his debut in Postmen in the Mountains (1999) by Huo Jianqi, which won the Best Feature Film Award at China's Golden Rooster Awards and earned Liu a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[1] Liu then played a young homosexual man in the film Lan Yu (2000) by Stanley Kwan, which earned him the Best Actor award at the Golden Horse Awards.[2] Thereafter, Liu starred in many acclaimed films such as Sky Lovers (2002), which won him the Artistic Contribution Award at the Tokyo International Film Festival;[7] Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress (2002),[8] as well as the avant-garde drama film Purple Butterfly (2003), which competed in the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.[9][3]\n\nLiu's first Hollywood film Dark Matter, based on the 1991 University of Iowa shooting, was filmed in 2006.[10] Starring opposite Meryl Streep, Liu played the role of a Chinese physics postgraduate named Liu Xing.[11][12] Dark Matter won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and was released in the United States in April 2008.[13][14]\n\nRegarded by many as one of mainland's top actors, Liu has appeared on screen in versatile roles, such as a cocky young man in Stanley Kwan's The Foliage (2003),[15] which won him the Best Actor award at the Golden Rooster Awards;[16] a menacing snow wolf in Chen Kaige's The Promise (2005) and a scheming prince in Zhang Yimou's Curse of the Golden Flower (2006);[17][18] his performance nabbed him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Hong Kong Film Awards.[19] He shed off his melancholic and weak on-screen image[11] to play tougher and more complex roles such as a gangster in John Woo's Blood Brothers (2007)[20] and Ding Sheng's The Underdog Knight (2008),[21] where he played a retired and mentally ill soldier.[22] Liu also took on his first villainous role in Connected (2008), a remake of the American film Cellular.[23]\n\nBut Liu’s brooding onscreen presence truly came into full view with the nearly simultaneous release of Lu Chuan’s tribute to the Nanjing massacre, City of Life and Death,[24] and Yin Li’s Iron Man (both in 2009).[25] The leading man in both films, Liu plays a brave soldier in Lu’s war epic and a bronzed oil worker in Yin’s film about those who struggled to develop China’s oil industry in the Taklamakan desert in West China; successfully shedding off his previous screen image.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2011 patriotic tribute, The Founding of a Party, it was reported that Liu was required to gain 10 kg in order to play a 30-year-old Mao Zedong, a feat he achieved by eating 20 eggs a day.[26][27] After filming Andrew Lau's romantic film A Beautiful Life the same year, Liu reunited with Lu Chuan in The Last Supper (2012), a US$15-million historical epic where he plays Liu Bang.[17][28]\n\nLiu received the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government in 2013.[29]\n\nIn 2014, Liu starred in war drama All Quiet in Peking by novelist Liu Heping. The series, based on the events of the War for Liberation in the late 1940s, earned widespread acclaim for its interesting story and historical accuracy; and was a massive success in China.[30]\n\nLiu won the Golden Goblet Award for Best Actor for his performance as a car mechanic who is unexpectedly involved in a murder case in the film Cock and Bull (2016), his first award in ten years.[31]\n\nOther activities\n\n[edit]\n\nLiu was named ambassador of the French Riviera in 2016.[32] He has been previously appointed tourism goodwill ambassador for Israel in 2014.[33] On April 6, 2018, Liu received an Honorary Citizen Medal from Nice, where his wife is from, for his contribution to the promotion of the French Riviera region.[34]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLiu married French (of Jewish descent) photographer Anais Martane in Beijing on July 5, 2009.[35] Their first child, a son named Noé (Nuoyi in Chinese), was born on October 10, 2010, in France.[36] Two years later, their daughter named Nina was born on January 22, 2012, in Beijing.[37]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear English title Chinese title Role 1998 A Century's Dream 世纪之梦 Zhao Xiling 1999 Postmen in the Mountains 那山、那人、那狗 Son 2000 Team Spirit 女帅男兵 Yan Kai 2001 Lan Yu 蓝宇 Lan Yu 2002 Flowers Bloom 花儿怒放 Ding Tian [38] Sky Lovers 天上的恋人 Wang Jiakuan Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress 巴尔扎克与小裁缝 Ma Jianling 2003 The Floating Landscape 恋之风景 Lit Purple Butterfly 紫蝴蝶 Szeto Sudden Lover 青春爱人事件 Xiaoxie [39] The Foliage 美人草 Liu Simeng 2004 Jasmine Women 茉莉花开 Xiaodu [40] 2005 The Ghost Inside 疑神疑鬼 Fang Cheng [41] The Promise 无极 Snow Wolf Mini 米尼 Kang Mob Sister 阿嫂传奇 Heung-tung [42] 2006 Curse of the Golden Flower 满城尽带黄金甲 Crown Prince Wan 2007 Blood Brothers 天堂口 Kang Dark Matter 暗物质 Liu Xing 2008 The Underdog Knight 硬汉 Laosan Connected 保持通话 Fok Tak-nang 2009 City of Life and Death 南京！南京！ Lu Jianxiong Iron Men 铁人 Liu Sicheng The Founding of a Republic 建国大业 Red Army old soldier 2010 Lan 我们天上见 Xiaoqiang [43] Driverless 无人驾驶 Zhixiong [44] Color Me Love 爱出色 Luan Yihong [45] 2011 He-Man 硬汉2奉陪到底 Laosan [46] A Beautiful Life 不再让你孤单 Fang Zhendong [47] The Founding of a Party 建党伟业 Mao Zedong 2012 The Last Supper 王的盛宴 Liu Bang 2013 The Chef, the Actor, the Scoundrel 厨子戏子痞子 Chef [48] Redemption 杀戒 Xiao Ligun [49] Police Story 2013 警察故事2013 Wu Jiang [50] 2014 The Boundary 全城通缉 Tang Yue [51] 2015 Beijing, New York 北京，纽约 Lan Yi [52] Saving Mr. Wu 解救吾先生 Xing Feng [53] 2016 Night Peacock 夜孔雀 Jian Min [54] Cock and Bull 追凶者也 Song Lao'er My War 我的战争 Sun Beichuan [55] 2017 The Founding of an Army 建军大业 Mao Zedong [56] 2018 Air Strike 大轰炸 Xue Gangtou [57] 2021 Island Keeper 守岛人 Wang Jicai\n\nTelevision series\n\n[edit]\n\nYear English title Chinese title Role 1998 十个女囚的自白 Sun Xi'an 2000 Happy Street 幸福街 Xu Xiaoyang 2002 Don't Rent a Room 有房别出租 Ding Yufei [58] Love & Sword 有情鸳鸯无情剑 Shao Da [59] 2003 How Can I Rescue My Love 拿什么拯救你，我的爱人 Long Xiaoyu [60] Painted Soul 画魂 Tian Shouxin 2004 Summer's Taste 阳光下的阴影 Zhang Yi [61] Assassinator Jing Ke 荆轲传奇 Jing Ke [62] 2005 Blood Color Romance 血色浪漫 Zhong Yuemin [63][64] 2006 一针见血 Su Yan [65] Harmony 天和局 Min Huatang [66] Surrender to the Innocent Girl 向天真女生投降 Wang Qian / Wang Zhiyuan [67] 2008 Our Life Time 我们生活的年代 Yuan Haodong [68] 2009 The Epic of a Woman 一个女人的史诗 Ouyang Yu [69] 2010 Invisible Target 男儿本色 Zhou Chuanxiong [70] The Sniper 神枪手 Peng Kehu [71] 2013 Fire Line, Three Brothers 火線三兄弟 Tian Erlin [72] 2014 Red Path 红色通道 Wu Quan [73] All Quiet in Peking 北平无战事 Fang Meng'ao 2018 Old Boy\n\n老男孩 Wu Zheng [74] 2019 National Treasure Legendary Journey 国宝奇旅 Ren Hongyi [75] On the Road 在远方 Yao Yuan [76]\n\nVariety show\n\n[edit]\n\nYear English title Chinese title Role Notes 2013 China's Got Talent 中国达人秀 Judge 2014 Grandpa Over Flowers 花样爷爷 Cast member [77] 2015 Where Are We Going, Dad?
