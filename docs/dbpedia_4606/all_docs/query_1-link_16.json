        "text": "Stanley Kwan, the openly gay Hong Kong filmmaker, has come up with his smoothest and least cluttered film in a while with “Lan Yu,” which is based on a gay porno book that was posted, anonymously, on the Internet. This drama of the on again-off again-on relationship between a businessman and a youth from the country might spark controversy in mainland China, not only because it deals with a homosexual relationship between a member of the Chinese establishment and a peasant, but also because it touches on events such as the 1989 massacre in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. However, pic is unlikely to raise eyebrows anywhere else, despite some brief (unaroused) male nudity. Pic has a chance for limited release, especially in gay neighborhoods, with gay fest bookings a given. Crossover potential looms as limited.\n\nPic opens in Beijing in 1988, where Hangdong (Hu Jan), the son of a Communist Party official and head of a thriving trading company, is on the prowl for young men in a gay bar. A colleague introduces him to Lan Yu (Liu Ye), newly arrived from the countryside. The man and the youth become lovers, and for Lan it’s a life-changing initiation, whereas for the older man it’s just a diversion — at first.\n\nOne night Lan Yu shows up unexpectedly at Hangdong’s apartment and finds him with a college athlete. It’s the end of the affair — at least for a while. Some months later, Beijing students, among them Lan Yu, take part in demonstrations that culminate in the Tiananmen Square massacre.\n\nWorried about his protege, Hangdong goes looking for him and finds him safe; the affair resumes. But again they part when Hangdong decides to go “respectable” and marry. Not surprisingly, the marriage is short-lived. The men meet again, though Hangdong now is under a cloud because his company is being investigated for illegal activities.\n\nKwan skims over many of the peripheral events in this love story (Hangdong’s marriage is given particularly short shrift) to concentrate on the main business at hand — the relationship between the lovers. This is not as compelling as it might have been, thanks to a lackluster perf from Liu Ye in the title role; the actor never really convinces as the ardent young lover and, furthermore, is clearly too old for the role in the early scenes. On the other hand, Hu Jan is consistently excellent, even touching, as the more mature Hangdong.\n\nPic is very competently made in every department, and the sober treatment marks a more traditional approach to his material for Kwan after his last few pics."
