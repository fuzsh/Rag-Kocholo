        "text": "Hong Kong project Fly Me To The Moon won five awards at the closing of this year’s Hong Kong-Asia Film Financing Forum (HAF, March 13-15).\n\nThe film will mark the feature directorial debut of Sasha Chuk and is produced by Hong Kong filmmaker Stanley Kwan, whose films as a director include Venice 2005 title Everlasting Regret, Cannes 2001 film Lan Yu and Berlin competition titles Center Stage, The Island Tales, Hold You Tight and Red Rose White Rose.\n\nScroll down for full list of winners\n\nFly Me To The Moon was among 15 titles selected for the work-in-progress strand of this year’s HAF and won the WIP Award for a Hong Kong project, CCG Grand Award, Heaven Pictures Young Director Award, mm2 Award and was selected for the HAF Goes to Cannes programme. The associated prize money totals HK$550,000 ($70,000).\n\nThe project had previously received HK$5m ($637,000) from the Hong Kong Film Development Council’s First Feature Film Initiative and the winnings mean it has reached its proposed budget of $705,000.\n\nThis drama follows two immigrant sisters in the 1990s who move from China to join their drug-addict father in Hong Kong. The cast is led by Wu Kang Ren of Netflix’s Copycat Killer, Wu Chien Ho from Chung Mong-Hong’s award-winner A Sun and Angela Yuen of The Narrow Road. Chuk’s Taiwan-set short film Plain Sailing won the gold award of the open category at Hong Kong’s ifva Awards in 2022.\n\nOther multiple HAF award-winners included Salli from Taiwanese debut director Lien Chien-Hung, which won a hat-trick of prizes. The film, which has a budget of $1.28m, centres on a chicken farmer in Taiwan who develops an online romance with a man in France, and travels to Paris despite her fellow villagers believing it is a scam.\n\nThe 21st edition of HAF also showcased 28 in-development projects, of which Lawrence Kan’s Hong Kong title The Marriage Drive and Zhao Jin’s Chinese title Non-Fiction Stories won the top IDP Awards, each worth HK$100,000 ($12,700).\n\nThe IDP strand also saw Chinese project The Poison Cat by first-time director Guan Tian win three prizes. The fantasy thriller centres on a pregnant woman who tries to protect her child after an evil spirit appears in her village.\n\nHAF is celebrating several projects that have found success on the international stage in recent months. Lu Jian’s Art College 1994, Wu Lang’s Absence and Burak Cevik’s Forms Of Forgetting all played at last month’s Berlinale, having previously come through HAF, while Lav Diaz’s When The Waves Are Gone and Stonewalling from Ji Huang and Ryuji Otsuka were selected for Venice.\n\nHAF21 Award Winners\n\nIDP Award for a Hong Kong project: The Marriage Drive (HK), dir.
