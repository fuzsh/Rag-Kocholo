        "text": "\"Lan Yu\" exhibits the usual issues of Kwan's cinema, but the portrayal of the relationship, the acting, and the cinematography are so great, that the faults are barely noticeable in the end, in a rather excellent movie.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 6.5/10 | Sep 12, 2021\n\nIt's a wise, moving love story--marred only by a rather arbitrary twist of fate at the end--played out with an emotional honesty that would be unusual and adventurous in any language.\n\nFull Review | Mar 31, 2008\n\nThe characters seem one-dimensional, and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Mar 7, 2003\n\nSeems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Mar 7, 2003\n\nThis delicately observed story, deeply felt and masterfully stylized, is a triumph for its maverick director.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Dec 8, 2002\n\nLan Yu is a genuine love story, full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Nov 1, 2002\n\nThe movie is gorgeously made, but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Oct 17, 2002\n\nIt's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits. If only it had the story to match.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Oct 4, 2002"
