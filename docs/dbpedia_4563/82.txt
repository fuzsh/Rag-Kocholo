Marine Corps officials have identified a staff sergeant who died Thursday in a hospital in Lisbon, Portugal.

Staff Sgt. Denver Sugano, a 32-year-old aviation quality assurance representative assigned to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 162 (Reinforced), 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, died of a noncombat-related illness while deployed as the flight equipment staff noncommissioned officer in charge for the air combat element.

Sugano died of natural causes, but further details are not yet available pending investigation, II Marine Expeditionary Force engagement officer 1st Lt. Danielle Phillips told Marine Corps Times.

"Staff Sgt. Denver Sugano was a vibrant leader with an infectious personality who was beloved by his Marines and universally respected by those who knew him," VMM-162 (REIN) commanding officer Lt. Col. Brian Koch said in a news release.

Sugano, of Beaufort, South Carolina, entered active duty in July 2002. He was promoted to staff sergeant in March 2010 and assigned to Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 167 in December 2011.

His previous awards include a Navy Unit Commendation, Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation, Good Conduct Medal and Humanitarian Service Medal.

"VMM-162 (REIN) lost a brother today," Koch said. "We will miss him, and he will forever be in our thoughts and serve as an inspiration to each one of us."
