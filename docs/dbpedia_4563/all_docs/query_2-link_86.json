        "text": "------------------\n\nHELHEIM SCANS\n\n[Translator - Prøks]\n\n[Proofreader - Prøks]\n\n------------------\n\nChapter 214: The Third Trial (2)\n\nThe first thing he encountered was a massive volcano. Bright red flames erupted like fireworks.\n\n‘It's a bit too hot.’\n\nEven though he was some distance from the volcano, the suffocating heat washed over him. It was an environment where even most Awakened would find it difficult to operate.\n\nIf he were a Non-Awakened, he would have been roasted instantly.\n\nOf course, this didn't apply to Kim Minwoo. It was partly due to his high stats, but more importantly...\n\n\"Hayang.\"\n\n―Coo.\n\n[Hayang shares the ‘White Flame’ attribute!]\n\n[Fire resistance increased by 130%!]\n\nThe White Flame attribute evolved from the Fire attribute after defeating the Spirit King.\n\nIt was thanks to this that he could wrap himself in tremendous elemental resistance.\n\nNot only that...\n\nTo Kim Minwoo, million-won potions were like cheap coffee from a vending machine.\n\n[Consuming Flame Resistance Potion (Highest Rank)!]\n\nGulp.\n\n\"Phew, I feel much better now.\"\n\nAttribute sharing and potions were godsends, making him invincible. Perhaps now, with a bit of exaggeration, he could even bathe in lava.\n\nHe breathed deeply.\n\nHe looked around.\n\n‘The sky is red. The ground is parched.’\n\nIt was truly a place befitting the Demon Realm.\n\nThe only unusual thing was the dozens of giant statues erected near the volcano.\n\nThey seemed to be at least 10 meters tall, all depicting Balrogs.\n\n‘Now I understand why it's called Balrog's Hill.’\n\nHe approached the intricately carved Balrog statues for a closer look.\n\nFlap!\n\nA powerful flapping sound echoed.\n\nFrom holes scattered around the volcano like ant nests, a group of Balrogs emerged. The largest one among them began to fly towards him.\n\n―Who are you? A wanderer?\n\n\"I'm human.\"\n\n―……Human? The creature that lives in the Middle World, infinitely weak, and relies on God?\n\n\"I guess that's how you see them here?\"\n\nAfter staring at him blankly for a moment, the leading Balrog chuckled and said,\n\n―Long Long. That's my name. Yours?\n\n\"Kim Minwoo. Your name is quite cute.\"\n\n―……Never heard that before. So, Kim Minwoo. Did you come from the Middle World?\n\n\"Something like that.\"\n\n―How did you get here? Did you find a passage?\n\nLong Long's eyes blazed.\n\nThe flames around his eyes and tail fluttered like a gentle breeze, his gaze filled with anticipation...\n\n\"What are you going to do if I did?\"\n\n―If there's a passage, we should be the first to use it. I heard humans are quite tasty...\n\n\"Ah, so you see me as food?\"\n\n―No. You're a bit different.\n\n\"How am I different?\"\n\n―Because you can withstand the heat.\n\nLong Long looked at him with admiration.\n\n―Even mid-rank demons aren't this relaxed on our land. But you are. We Balrogs acknowledge the strong.\n\n\"Are mid-rank demons considered strong?\"\n\n―At least they're not insignificant. Well... compared to us Balrogs, they're just lowly creatures. So, what's your answer?\n\n\"I'm not telling you.\"\n\n―What?\n\n\"Do I have to answer every question you ask? No, I don't.\"\n\n―Huh, hahaha!\n\nThe Balrog laughed, clutching his belly.\n\nHis laughter alone shook the surrounding 10 meters.\n\n\"And if you're going to lie, wipe your mouth first.\"\n\n―Lie? What lie?\n\n\"You're drooling. Whether I answer or not, you're planning to eat me, aren't you?\"\n\n―That's right. You're smart. But there's one difference. Can you guess?\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n―If you answer, I'll eat you nicely. If you don't, I'll rip out your guts one by one.\n\nHmm.\n\nIs this the Demon Realm stance?\n\nWell, it's true.\n\nIt's hard to imagine humans and demons playing patty-cake.\n\n‘This is going to be quite tiring.’\n\nIf other demons are like this, it's going to be very annoying.\n\n\"Do you know a Balrog named Vulcan?\"\n\n―How do you know his name?\n\n\"Oh, you know him?\"\n\n―You heard rumors? Well, Vulcan is quite famous...\n\n\"So you know him well? Are you friends with Vulcan?\"\n\n―How dare you compare me to Vulcan!\n\n\"Then, are you his underling?\"\n\n―You bastard, you've crossed the line...\n\nLong Long's body turned crimson.\n\nBurning his own body.\n\nIf you didn't know better, you'd think he was about to self-destruct.\n\n\"You're lucky.\"\n\nOriginally, he was going to kill him.\n\nBut if he knows Vulcan, it's a different story.\n\nIt would be troublesome to start a hostile relationship with Vulcan by killing him unnecessarily.\n\n‘All the demons would probably be drooling.’\n\nHe couldn't kill them all, could he?\n\n\"Cedric.\"\n\n―You called?\n\n\"Beat him, but don't kill him.\"\n\n―Alright.\n\nFlap!\n\nWings sprouted from Cedric's back.\n\n―……A dragon?\n\nCedric lunged at the startled Balrog.\n\nSqueal!\n\nHe learned something new.\n\nA Balrog's scream sounded similar to a pig being slaughtered.\n\n* * *\n\n\"Aha. So, you're a kind of mercenary group?\"\n\n―Th-that's right. Currently, we are residing in the territory of the 7th Demon Lord of the Demon Realm, Paimon.\n\nLong Long's explanation of the Balrog's way of life was quite interesting.\n\nBalrogs are extremely strong.\n\nThey have a warrior-centered hierarchical society where the strongest becomes the leader.\n\nVulcan was the current ruler of the Balrogs.\n\nThese Balrogs worked as a sort of mercenary group under the Demon Lords. They would stay in the territory of the Demon Lord who assigned them a task and carry out the work.\n\n\"The Demon Lord provides land, autonomy, and resources. And you provide military power?\"\n\n―That's roughly the structure.\n\n\"But do you normally live in such a gloomy place? This is the first time I've seen creatures living in caves inside a volcano.\"\n\n―Hehe... other creatures might not, but for us Balrogs, this is a fantastic place.\n\n------------------\n\nHELHEIM SCANS\n\n[Translator - Prøks]\n\n[Proofreader - Prøks]\n\nJoin our Discord for release updates!\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/dbdMDhzWa2\n\n------------------\n\nPerhaps it was because he had been beaten like a dog by Cedric, who had his second seal released.\n\nLong Long's attitude was very polite.\n\nThe Demon Realm's value of acknowledging the strong was also one of the reasons for his changed attitude.\n\n\"So, where's Vulcan?\"\n\n―He must be carrying out Lord Paimon's mission.\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n―No way. He's doing it with the village's elite Balrogs.\n\n\"Then, when will he be back?\"\n\n―I don't know when he'll be back...\n\n\"Hmm... Alright, you can go now.\"\n\n―Yes. I'll come whenever you call!\n\nLong Long carefully prostrated himself, then quickly got up and left the cave.\n\n‘What a monstrous guy!’\n\nEven if he was infinitely weaker than Vulcan, he was still a Balrog.\n\nThis meant that he was a strong being that couldn't be easily dismissed, even if he was the highest-ranking demon right below the Demon Lord.\n\nAnd that guy, who wasn't even human...\n\nJust one of that human's summons easily subdued him.\n\nWhen his bones were chilled by a single punch from a skeletal fist, he almost forgot his pride and burst into tears.\n\n‘What should I do?’\n\nHe didn't know.\n\nNo immediate solution came to mind.\n\nThe other Balrogs were equally terrified. Long Long was the strongest among the Balrogs remaining in the village, but he had been subdued in an instant.\n\nEven if all the Balrogs here rushed at him, he didn't think they could easily defeat him.\n\nJust as Long Long's mind was in turmoil, Kim Minwoo was also deep in thought.\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nHe had experienced two arrangements so far.\n\nThe common point was resolving the ‘regrets’ of each Legion Commander.\n\n‘It's highly likely that this arrangement will be the same, right?’\n\nIt could be a structure where he solves something other than regrets...\n\nBut the most likely scenario was that.\n\nSo Vulcan also experienced something regrettable here...\n\n‘What could it be?’\n\nHe summoned Cedric and Merhen.\n\n\"Do you two have any ideas?\"\n\n―I know nothing about Vulcan. We weren't close at all.\n\nThis was Merhen's answer.\n\nIt was understandable.\n\nAfter all, it was Vulcan who accompanied the Death Lord who turned her into an undead.\n\nIt was fortunate that they were merely not close.\n\nCedric, on the other hand...\n\nHe seemed to have something in mind.\n\n―Vulcan was arrogant. And he was very proud of his race.\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n―Yes. A chosen few. That was Vulcan's image of Balrogs. But thinking about it now, it's a bit strange.\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n―Despite cherishing his kind so much, I've never seen any other Balrogs besides Vulcan.\n\n\"Didn't you ask back then?\"\n\n―No need. There was no reason to pry into something he didn't want to talk about. But I understand one thing. The Vulcan I knew wouldn't have left the Balrogs I see now behind.\n\n\"The Lord could have taken only Vulcan.\"\n\n―That's unlikely. The Lord at that time was in a position where he needed all the help he could get. Even if the Balrogs weren't exceptional, wouldn't it be normal to bring them along?\n\n\"Okay, I get it.\"\n\nHe understood what Cedric was trying to say.\n\nIn other words, if there were other Balrogs when the Death Lord took Vulcan, they would have most likely come along.\n\nBut they didn't.\n\nWhy?\n\n‘Because there was no one else but him?’\n\nWhat if all the Balrogs he saw here, including the elite group that carried out mercenary work, were wiped out?\n\nThen it would make sense that Vulcan was the only one who submitted to the Lord. How could he bring others along if there were no others?\n\n‘Did they die without even leaving a corpse?’\n\nIf there were corpses, the Death Lord could have tried to resurrect them as undead.\n\n\"So, we have to prevent the annihilation of the Balrogs.\"\n\n―I'm not sure. It's just a guess.\n\n\"A guess is better than nothing. It's better than having no clue at all. Hey, Long Long!\"\n\n―You called!\n\nLong Long came running back and prostrated himself.\n\n\"I have a question.\"\n\n―Go ahead.\n\n\"About Vulcan and his elite troops. How strong are they?\"\n\n―...Pardon?\n\n\"Tell me in a way that's easy to understand. In a direct way. Ah! This would be good. If you combine them all, what rank would they be among the Demon Lords?\"\n\n―I-I don't know...\n\n\"No one's asking you to be perfectly accurate. Just give me an estimate. Even a rough one will do. How do they compare to that Paimon guy?\"\n\n―Hmm... Vulcan and his elite troops... they wouldn't be easily defeated.\n\n\"Can they even rival Paimon?\"\n\n―Probably? At least Lord Paimon wouldn't be able to easily dispose of us. Vulcan's power is truly remarkable.\n\nRivaling the 7th ranked Demon Lord?\n\n‘He's quite strong.’\n\nWell, it's true.\n\nIn the future, after this point in time...\n\nWhen Merhen was turned into an undead.\n\nThe power Vulcan displayed then was terrifying.\n\nIt took a lot of effort to gouge out even one of his eyeballs.\n\n\"Oh right. Vulcan doesn't have a missing eye, does he?\"\n\n―A missing eye? Not at all.\n\nThe past is certain.\n\nIf we arrange the arrangements in chronological order...\n\nVulcan → Merhen → Cedric.\n\nThis would be the order.\n\nSo, gouging out his eyeball during Merhen's time wouldn't apply to Vulcan's current arrangement.\n\nOr it could be a separate parallel world, since it was a fragment of the past.\n\nAnyway, the conclusion.\n\nFor now, it seems like he should aim to prevent the annihilation of the Balrogs.\n\n\"I need to meet Vulcan. Do you have something like a crystal ball? A crystal ball that can summon Vulcan.\"\n\n―I don't have one...\n\n\"You really don't know when he'll be back?\"\n\n―Yes... I really don't know. If I did, I would have told you right away, Kim Minwoo.\n\n\"No, what if your base gets raided while you're out and about? Isn't this your base?\"\n\n―Th-that... who would raid us... except for you, Kim Minwoo...\n\nHa.\n\nHe couldn't argue with that.\n\nHe licked his lips and looked at Long Long.\n\n\"Then I'll have to go meet him myself.\"\n\n―How?\n\nLong Long asked, tilting his head.\n\nEven he, Vulcan's loyal follower, didn't know where he was.\n\nThat was natural, as he was carrying out the Demon Lord Paimon's mission.\n\n\"Even if you don't know, that Paimon guy would know, right? Since he gave the mission.\"\n\n―Th-that's right.\n\n\"Then the answer is clear. We can just ask the guy who knows, right?\"\n\n―Ask Lord Paimon?\n\n\"Where does he live? Lead the way.\"\n\nLong Long stared blankly at Kim Minwoo at those words.\n\n------------------\n\nHELHEIM SCANS\n\n[Translator - Prøks]\n\n[Proofreader - Prøks]\n\nJoin our Discord for release updates!\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/dbdMDhzWa2\n\n------------------"
