        "text": "Hmm... very interesting. Not sure what \"compatibility mode\" does but if a normal 3D view is having problems without it, then it still sounds like something that is system/hardware related.\n\nHow many plot lines get generated for the view that you are trying to update? Maybe you are running out of memory or maybe you have some bad memory? I remember having problems a long time ago with an elevation that had way too many pattern lines from a custom pattern.\n\nCan you create a very simple plan and update plot lines on that machine? Might be something that is plan specific or something related to the plan size? Could still just be a Chief bug related to making the plot lines and you are getting lucky on one machine and not the other for some reason.\n\nNot really my area of expertise so just throwing some things out that might help. I would keep working with tech support until you get this resolved though.\n\nThere apparently is an issue with the 14900K and even in some cases the 13900K with the default settings on most motherboards. When I started having issues, the first thing I did was reset all of the settings on my motherboard to the defaults hoping that would cure the issue. I even replaced the ASUS motherboard with an MSI motherboard, but the issue persisted. I spent many, many hours on the phone with various tech support centers to try to find a solution, as well as just trying everything I could to ensure there was not a faulty piece of hardware on the computer. It was extremely frustrating.\n\nYesterday, I was reading some gamer forums since gamers tend to spend a lot of time tweaking their systems. I found a thread that dealt with crashes with the 14900K i9 CPU. They were having crashes in several games when the GPU (graphics card) kicked in with a high load on the power, especially when an RTX 4090 card was in use. They had found that the default settings for the Performance Active-Core Ratio (P-Core) on most motherboards was set to around 57x. They suggested backing that down to 54x to resolve the issue using the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility App.\n\nI downloaded the software and changed each P-Core from 57x to 54x and rebooted. After about 6 hours of continuous use and many refreshes of the plot line elevations, I have not had any crashes. I hope this helps someone who might be having similar issues, so they don't spend an exhaustive number of hours trying to pinpoint a solution like I did."
