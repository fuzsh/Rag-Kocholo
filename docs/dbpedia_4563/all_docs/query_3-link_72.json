        "text": "In Country\n\nTales of the Vietnam War from the Veterans who lived it.\n\nBelow, you will find an illustration of the Vietnam War told by the sons and daughters of South Dakota as they lived it through personal experience, heroic actions and tragic loss.\n\nShortly after high school graduation, at age 18, I was drafted. I was living on my parents' farm near the little town of Seneca, South Dakota located in western Faulk County.\n\nTime goes by so quickly. There was a time when 24 hours seemed like forever and a week could be eternity.\n\n1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment\n\n4th Infantry Division\n\nII Corps\n\nPleiku, Ban Me Thout, Kontum\n\nRepublic of South Vietnam\n\nMarch, 1968 through March 1969\n\n• Nick Roseland, Pierre, South Dakota\n\nI joined the Army because it would pay for two years of college and then I would serve three years of active duty. For a farm girl with three sisters it was a great way to get a college education. I have never regretted it.\n\nI have wonderful memories of working long 12-hour days, six days a week, with one weekend off every 8 to 10 weeks. Everyone worked together, the chief nurse would come and help pass out meal trays. Since it was a draft army it was made up of everyone from every walk of life. We worked hard and played hard.\n\nI initially joined to help take care of the soldiers who were hurt since they did not ask to be there in the first place. My hope was an assignment in Vietnam but we started pulling out forces so I was sent to Germany where we received some of the wounded. Of course, the Cold war was going on, too.\n\nI still work as a Department of the Army Civilian as a nurse in Germany and have now been involved in assisting the soldiers in three wars and several conflicts—as an Army Nurse during the Vietnam era, an elementary school counselor for the 1st Gulf war and as a community health nurse for the 2nd Gulf war. I hope this is the last.\n\nI met my husband in Spain during a four day pass I got after being promoted to Captain. After 28 years of marriage it was one of the best things that I “got out of the army”. The other great things I received were my education bachelor and masters degree.\n\nToday’s army is different but so many things stay the same, I love working for the military and supporting our brave soldiers and their families.\n\n• Kathleen S Ackermann, APO, AE\n\nAgainst that backdrop, American soldiers of all races fought together. However, when not on a mission, some soldiers tended to associate with those of their own race. My experience was that soldiers of all races generally got along with each other, and that personal issues between soldiers did not necessarily follow racial lines. Nonetheless, I recall instances of racial tension between white and black soldiers in the 2/60th. This is where Adams comes in. He was barely five feet tall. He was black and hung around with other black soldiers in the battalion. Any time trouble seemed to be brewing, he had a smile and wit and wisdom that would defuse most any situation. When I heard Adams got killed I thought what a waste—more so than usual. I think Adams had a lot to offer had he lived.\n\n• Dale Bertsch, Pierre, SD.\n\nI joined the US Marine Corps in 1969; I just graduated from Freeman high school. There were two from our 1969 graduation class who joined the Marines. Like all new recruits in boot camp, you ask yourself, Why did I do this? and How do I get out of this mess I got myself into? My parents were against me joining the Armed Forces and especially the Marines. For a while I thought they were correct. I learned to accept my situation and to make the best of it. The training was hard, but worth it. Because of this training, I was looking forward to going to South Vietnam. The Vietnam War for me was difficult but rewarding. My experience there has stayed with me for the rest of my life. I believe I have come to terms with the war and have used this in a positive manner. I am proud to have served in Vietnam. There are very few Americans and very few servicemen who have served in a combat zone and realized this experience. Thank you.\n\n• Allen J. Adrian, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nI attended Army basic training, AIT, then Officer Candidate School after graduation from SDSU. I was accepted into flight school after OCS and trained in the OV-1 Mohawk surveillance airplane, a twin-engine turbo prop built by Grumman. The Mohawk conducted day and night low-level surveillance missions with installed cameras and infrared equipment. I flew missions in the I CORP region including the DMZ, Ashau Valley, Ho Chi Minh trail, and also in Cambodia. One well-remembered mission included photo recon of the Angkor Wat temples in Cambodia which had fallen into Viet Cong hands. Due to distance from our airfield, we had to fly to the Air Force base in Ubon Thailand to refuel before returning to Vietnam. Although my aircraft was hit several times, I was never shot down during my two tours in Vietnam.\n\nThe Mohawk was retired from active Army duty in 1996, but is still flying in several foreign countries and with some American historic aircraft museums. While stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington in 1969, I flew a Mohawk cross-country and landed in Pierre and visited my folks in Highmore. Watch for a Mohawk in the memorial dedication flyover in 2006. That will be the second time a Mohawk has been in Pierre. Thank you South Dakota for remembering the Vietnam veterans.\n\n• Rod D. Anderson, Pierre, SD\n\nIn Tay Ninh Province, III Corps, RVN, we were doing an ARVN Infantry search operation on Nui Ba Dinh (black mountain), and I (MACV advisor) was riding in a UH-1D helicopter to bring in some supplies to our MACV infantry advisors; we were preparing to leave off the mountain and were just hovering when an enemy sniper opened up on us; the trajectory of the bullet missed our M-60 door gunner and went through our fuel tank and came out the other side, just missing our other door gunner. We did an emergency landing in the rice fields and then, after assessing our damage, flew to the Tay Ninh base and switched helicopters. One of the pilots was Dennis Vehee, a fellow SDSU ROTC graduate of mine.\n\n• Larry D Birger, Sr., Jamestown, ND\n\nServing in Vietnam was the greatest experience of my life. I enlisted in the Air Force at the age of 17 years, 11 months. I established many life-long relationships with other airmen as well as some short-term relationships with the Vietnamese children. Four of my friends and I spent most every weekend at the beach, weather and other circumstances permitting, taking food and beverages for these children, some of which were orphans. When one or two of the children would not show up at the beach, the other children would tell us that they had died. When I left Vietnam, I gave all of my clothing and boots to our house boy.\n\n• David S. Brandriet, Watertown, SD\n\nIt somehow seems very strange to me that I am writing this for my husband David. He should be the one writing about his experiences in Vietnam, not me.\n\nYou see, my husband died thirteen years ago. On April 19, 1993, he and seven others died in the state aircraft while on a trip to save one of South Dakota’s largest employers. Dave, Governor Mickelson, and fellow pilot Ron Becker, along with five others died on that day in Iowa.\n\nDave would be so excited about the upcoming celebration. He would want to share this time with fellow Vietnam Veterans, in particular his friend Jim Elkins from Watertown, SD, and his friends from the VEVA (Vietnam Era Veterans Association) group here in Pierre.\n\nIt always amazed me what Dave went through in Vietnam. He never talked a lot about it to me, but I did learn a lot from his friends after he died. Dave was a Huey helicopter pilot and was shot down and wounded on May 31, 1969. Thanks to the blessings of God and some fellow pilots who picked him and the others up that day, he survived his tour in the war. At his own request, he stayed in-country to recover from his wounds and finished his tour of duty, though he could have come home.\n\nAfter the war, Dave came home to SD. We met in April 1971 and married in December of 1971. Shortly after the birth of our first daughter Kristi in 1973, he joined the SD Highway Patrol, moving us to Pierre. After being in Pierre for a short time, the patrol chose Dave to become the Highway Patrol pilot. He took flying lessons to pilot the patrol plane, a Cessna 182. He loved his job; flying around our beautiful state, all by himself in the plane. After flying for some time, he was chosen to become Governor Janklow’s bodyguard. That turned into a full-time job, so he pretty much had to give up flying for the patrol. They hired another pilot, with Dave being his supervisor and also keeping his bodyguard position.\n\nThen the state decided that it would nice if he could fly the plane the governor flew on, since he always went along anyway. So he learned to first fly the King Air, the plane Dave really loved to fly. Then Governor Janklow traded the King Air for the MU-2, the plane in which Dave died.\n\nDave traveled all over the US, coming home and always having a story to tell us, whether it was just a day trip or several days. The girls and I always looked forward to his stories.\n\nThen came that day I’ll never forget. Dave had gone on a trip, flying Governor Mickelson and others to Ohio. The day started out like any other, but ended in a grief I’ll never forget. We have survived his death, but we will never, ever forget him. We miss him every day; I especially feel bad about all that he has missed in these thirteen years he’s been gone—church confirmation and high school graduation for Cathy, Kris and Cathy’s college graduations, both of their weddings (and not meeting both sons-in-law, who are great) and the births of our two wonderful grandchildren, Ty David and Alyssa Kaye. What a joy they would be to him.\n\nI don’t understand why he could survive Vietnam only to die in the fields of Iowa. But I guess that’s not for me to know. I just know we are very proud of his service to our country and we’re glad that he and his fellow veterans are finally getting the recognition they deserved years ago.\n\nMrs. David (Diane) Hansen\n\nKristi Hansen Turman\n\nCathy Hansen Stahl\n\n• David H. Hansen, Pierre, SD\n\nLet us never forget our mistakes of the past and let us never blame our servicemen and women for the mistakes of a nation.\n\n• David L. Braun, Pierre, SD\n\nI Served with Commander Coastal Surveillance Forces (CTF 115) River Flotilla One. Served in Operation SEA FLOAT III. I was in-country October 1969 until September 1970. While in Vietnam, my youngest daughter was born just three weeks after my arrival. I saw her for the first time when she was nine months old.\n\n• Roger Brooks, Brandon, SD\n\nI will have to come back to this with some stories and pics!\n\n• Michael G. Castle, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nI went into the service with Ron Jirsa from Mitchell, SD. We went to basic training together. He went to Fort Sill, OK and I went to Fort Lewis, WA and we met up again in Fort Lewis. He went to FDC and I ended up being a Medic assigned to his Battery. We left for Vietnam together on the USNS General John Pope. We landed in Vietnam together and served our tour together and came home together. He went home to Mitchell and I went home to Chamberlain. Its unusual for two men to serve their whole Vietnam experience together from the same area.\n\n• Lawrence E. Clark, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nIn the 1960s, many young people were called to serve their country. Many of our parents had been veterans of WWII and their patriotism was reflected in the family values and carried over in our thinking.\n\nThe idea that if our country called us to serve, it was prevalent and unquestioned—and we answered the call. I remember being a college student 18 years old, and reading in the newspaper that my high school neighbor and friend, Roger Jensen, had been killed in Vietnam. That is when I felt the call to duty, and volunteered for the draft, late in 1968.\n\nAs the Vietnam War lingered on, and the media exposure, political skepticism, and rallies for peace impacted the soldiers and their thinking, it became difficult to remain focused on duty and mission. Yet, we were soldiers, young, and dedicated to serve. We saw a lot and learned a lot, and I for one feel good that I served my country, and sad that the outcome was what it was. I am proud to have served, and remain a patriotic and proud American.\n\nWe don’t always agree with decisions our leaders make, but we do have an obligation, again today, to defend our country when called upon, without question. Everyone, who has served, in Vietnam, or any other war, deserves the respect of all citizens, for putting their life on the line for freedom. Let no person ever take for granted what we have here in America, and don’t forget that many have paid the ultimate price in the past and many more continue to do so today. Celebrate and appreciate your veterans, who gave what they had to give for your freedom and the United States of America.\n\nLastly, don’t ever let anyone, like Jane Fonda, influence your thinking with her distorted and wicked views and unpatriotic thinking. People like her are as responsible for lost lives as the enemy themselves. As Americans, when called to serve, we do so, and are proud of it. We all would prefer peace to war, but there is a price for peace, and it needs to be protected.\n\n• Jerome K Cleveland, Pierre, SD\n\nGreat interest and dedication should be made to the wives of all of the veterans as they were the ones who held the family together, paid the bills, raised the children and provided more support than can ever be expressed in 300 words or less. They really do need the recognition for their individual efforts and sacrifices. THANKS MOM!! YOU'RE THE BACKBONE OF THIS FAMILY!!\n\n• Robert A. Coates, Piedmont, SD\n\nNo story, just thought I was doing the right thing and it was a way out of South Dakota. Now years later I see it wasn’t the right thing and I’m glad I had South Dakota to come back to.\n\n• Kennedy E. David, Hot Springs, SD\n\nI was a Fuel Specialist while serving in Taiwan. Tainan AB was a repair station for planes that were shot up over Vietnam. I refueled countless planes that were very badly bullet-riddled and needed to be repaired before they could be airworthy again and be returned to action.\n\n• Kenneth L Erlenbusch, Pierre, SD\n\nA little bit of humor goes a long way, but when it comes to cooking, my wife still will not let me use C4 when I cook out! My platoon acted as engineers. We were told to construct a base for artillery support. We did not have axes or saws. We wrapped C4 around the trees and detonated them and scrounged for any material we could get our hands on but about an hour after we were finished we were eating C Rations and the Army artillery people were eating steaks. Go figure!!!\n\nHorseshoe ambushes don’t look too good, especially from the inside. Once, we had one company of NVA firing on us and two more coming up the hill from each side while we were sitting on or near buried land mines. It was the Lord Jesus who spared my life that day.\n\n• John A Fette, Pierre, SD\n\nThis is a poem I wrote yesterday, about the Vietnam War Soldiers – I was only a baby in the middle of the war, but it still made an impact on my life. After viewing the Vietnam War Memorial website yesterday, I went home and felt inspired to write something, to let all of the veterans know how much I care. I hope you enjoy reading this.\n\nDEDICATION TO THE SOLDIERS\n\nWhere do I begin to say\n\nHow very grateful I am\n\nTo all the sons and daughters\n\nWho served in Vietnam\n\nI wasn’t even born\n\nWhen it started in 1961\n\nA war that never seemed to end\n\nFourteen years from the time it had begun\n\nAs a child of the seventies\n\nI didn’t know what the fighting was for\n\nI’d hear my parents talk about it\n\nBut didn’t know it was a war\n\nThe innocence of childhood\n\nKept me protected from the news\n\nAnd the protesters who voiced too loudly\n\nThat war wasn’t the thing to choose\n\nI didn’t know that in another country\n\nMy cousins and uncles were in harm's way\n\nNor did I know that many sons and daughters\n\nWouldn’t make it back home to the USA\n\nIt wasn’t until I was older\n\nAnd listening to a teacher tell the story\n\nOf the soldiers who fought so hard\n\nAnd served with all their might and glory\n\nNo one could really explain\n\nWhy this war had to be\n\nOr why so many lost their lives\n\nIt doesn’t make sense to me\n\nAll I know is that I am honored\n\nTo say these servicemen gave their all\n\nWhen our country said “We need you”\n\nAnd duty came to call\n\nThe draft was put in place\n\nAnd the young men stood in line\n\nNot knowing where they were headed\n\nOr when it would be their time\n\nThe war itself has been over for years\n\nBut you can still see the pain in their eyes\n\nWhen they think about their friends who are gone\n\nAnd they look toward the heavenly skies\n\nI’m a mother of five sons\n\nAnd I can’t imagine the pain\n\nOf losing one of them to war\n\nAnd never seeing them again\n\nThose of you who made it back\n\nYou deserved so much more\n\nAnd I want to tell you from the bottom of my heart\n\nJust what I think you stand for\n\nBecause of you, I am still free\n\nAnd other people in the world are too\n\nYou did what your President asked\n\nAnd did what you were told to do\n\nIn a way, I owe you so much more\n\nThan I can ever give\n\nBecause of you, my sons learn about honor\n\nBecause of you, so many innocent people still live\n\nI honor you, I respect you\n\nI believe in you and I care\n\nI wish I could heal the wounds\n\nThat you endured over there.\n\nI can’t change the past\n\nOr bring back your dear friends\n\nBut I can try to make America understand\n\nThat the war in your hearts didn’t end\n\nYou still feel the sadness\n\nAnd I’m sure you feel the pain\n\nKnowing that you can’t turn back time\n\nAnd bring your friends back again\n\nAll we can do is move forward\n\nAnd remember those with pride\n\nWho fought with you all those years ago\n\nAnd served with dignity by your side\n\nIf ever there was a greater honor\n\nTo be seated on the thrones of Heaven\n\nIt is for our sons and daughters,\n\nThe proud, the brave and the never forgotten\n\nTwo Hundred and Seven….\n\n• Dena Marie Boyd-McCaskell, Pierre, SD.\n\nIn my 13 month tour, I don’t ever remember sleeping. I never intentionally sat or laid down with the intent to sleep. If I did I might not hear “incoming” or a “(deleted)” coming through the wire. But of course I would nod off, one of my worst non-combat feelings during my tour was when I woke up from a dream that I was back home in my own bedroom in the comfort of my parents' house. It was so incredibly real. Then I woke up staring at the beams in the roof of the bunker we were set up in. God, that was such a low desperate feeling that morning!\n\n• Brian R. Gage, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nI spent approximately two years with the Strategic Air Command at Fairchild AFB, Spokane, WA in non-tact scheduling. I was then transferred to Clark AFB PI where we formed the South East Asia Military Altitude Reservation Facility in 1965. We coordinated the airspace for nine countries for the mass movement of military aircraft as well as the Arc Light Missions and the Blackbird missions in SE Asia. Sixteen years after leaving the USAF, I joined the South Dakota Air National Guard where I worked as a controller in the command post and as the training NCO prior to my retirement in 1998.\n\n• Greg C. Hall, Pierre, SD\n\nIf you can imagine the whole 7th fleet in the South China Sea at one time it was quite impressive. There were over 50-60 ships of all sizes in a very small area waiting to see what was going to happen. On the Dubuque, the ship I was on, the people coming out to the ship in their little sanpans thought we were sinking because we had the capabilities of blow ballast and lower the ship to take other boats into our backside. I had pictures but they were taken away for confidential purposes. (At least, that’s what they told me.)\n\n• Thomas A. Henle, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nI was drafted from Gregory, SD after five years of college and two years of teaching high school in 1968. My training was taken at Fort Lewis, Washington and Fort Benning, GA. I was sent to Vietnam in May 1969 and was assigned to the Big Red One (mechanized) (A-2-2). Almost two months to day after arriving in Vietnam I was injured in the battle at Nui Ba Den (Black Virgin Mountain) on July 12, 1969. After spending two weeks in Japan, I was sent home to Fitzsimmons General Hospital in Denver. After spending nine months for a fractured left femur at Fitzsimmons, I was discharged from the Army on April 17, 1970. I am a very proud 50% DAV and am a life member of the DAV, VFW, and a member the American Legion. I retired from the teaching profession in 2003 and we have made our home in Broken Bow, NE, since 1978.\n\n• Dennis E Jones, Broken Bow, NE\n\nI have NO STORIES But I have something to say. When I got home in a medevac bus in California, we were egged at the base front gate. To you, John Q. America and Jane Fonda—thank you for caring about my pain. 37 years ago and the pain never goes away. I see you folks are doing well. Jane was put up for 'Woman of the Year'. I guess there must be payback in the next life. I know I sound angry but I did find happiness before my death though God and my children. SEMPER FI\n\n• Tommy W. Little Sr., Winner, S.D.\n\nVeterans should recognize these terms: Dung Lai (halt), Dua Tay Len Dau (put your hands on your head), Xay Ben Phai (turn right), Xay Ben Trai (turn left), The ACE OF SPADES (eternal damnation), and MPC (Military Payment Certificates). P.S.. I have a copy of the Pacific Stars and Stripes Volume 24, Number 31 with the headlines “VC HIT SAIGON”. The ‘Tet Offensive’ began the day before, and all hell broke loose. Cartoons in that edition included Blondie, whose 75th anniversary was 2005. My memories include Bob Hope and Raquel Welsh (both during Christmas 1967); juicy bugs in my salad at Cam Ranh Bay; Spooky (cool gunship); lots of youngsters using drugs—they just could not handle it; one of the first bevy of Huey Cobra Gunships (totally awesome); Agent Orange; the horrible smells in-country; eating a rat-meat sandwich in downtown Bien Hoa (it tasted like a dried beef sandwich); our buds from down under (Australians were our best friends); our company barber (who tortured and killed our trusted Vietnamese helpers); and, most of all, all those who looked to us to give South Vietnam their own freedom and identity.\n\nIn retrospect, I do forgive all those who spat upon me, and betrayed their country during a time of war. I do not feel I was blind to the issues, accepting my duties to my country, to my family, and to freedom. Those who repudiated their duties to their county will have to live with this, as will their progeny. As will I have to live with those things I was asked to do for the United States. Thank you for the gifts of AMERICA. Thank you for the gift of being born here. Thank you for reading this far.\n\n• Francis T. Logan, Rapid City, SD\n\nI was on duty in Korea when I was sent TDY into Thailand to serve at Camp Friendship to help maintain a Ghost Division. When regular troop replacements reported, I was told that I could leave. Without a passport, I was told that I could not go out through normal challenges. One night about 9pm I was called to company headquarters. I was told that there would be a plane at the dark end of the runway warming its engines at 11pm, and its door would be open. A friend took me to the area, I jumped the fence, boarded a C47 and we went out over Laos to Saigon where I caught an official military flight back to Korea to finish my tour there.\n\n• Lawrence R. Madsen, Gettysburg, SD\n\nI remember arriving in-country late at night. When we stopped in front of the terminal, all lights on the plane and the airport were turned off. We were in total blackout so we weren’t an easy target for mortars and rockets. We stepped from the plane and I will never forget the experience. It was unbelievably hot and humid. I was never so scared in my entire life. Twenty-two months later, I was on the ‘freedom bird’ and on my way home. I lost way too many friends and comrades.\n\n• Clarence S. Mardian, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nMany young men grew up fast in Vietnam. I was only one of them, and I made it back home. Many didn’t. Friends were made very fast in Vietnam, and some of those friends are now gone. To find friends from Vietnam is often difficult, but recently I had the opportunity to meet the man who save my life and never knew it. I was honored and humbled to stand, again, in front of this man and say “Thank you, Captain Hurley.” This was the first time I had seen this man in over 35 years! The event was even more saddened by the fact that it was at his father’s funeral. His father, too, was a personal hero of mine.\n\nWhen I arrived in Vietnam, I was laughed at for being from Canton, SD. I knew that very few people had even heard of South Dakota, let alone Canton. I didn’t know that Jim Hurley (from Canton) had been their Commanding Officer for the past six months, and he had often talked about Canton and South Dakota. He took care of his men and it really showed in their attitude. He had been transferred to our forward fire base recently, but he was all everyone talked about. They missed him. When I was sent to our forward fire base, he met me at the chopper pad. The events that occurred after we met are not important. What was important, was the fact that I finally got to thank Captain James Hurley. It completed and laid to rest many emotions that I still carried inside. This might sound dumb, but I would like to publicly thank Captain James Hurley for being in Vietnam and saving the lives of many young men.\n\n• Patrick J. Martin, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nI have a lot of stories and memories of being on the USS Constellation and the short time I was in DaNang, Vietnam.\n\n• Larry V. Ollerich, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nTwo memories:\n\n#1......Bob Hope’s Christmas in Cu Chi. A special thank you to Mr. Hope for bringing Christmas to young servicemen away from home.\n\n#2.....Seeing my Freedom Bird on the tarmac waiting for me to board.\n\n• Michael V. Olson, Martin, SD\n\nWhat I remember most about my experiences in Vietnam was the 27-hour flight from Travis Air Force Base and the blast of heat when the doors opened on the plane. From then on it was one day at a time. Trust was the most important. If someone directed you to go around another vehicle without seeing any oncoming traffic, you went. Trust was everywhere. The person who trusted you one day might have saved your life the next.\n\nAnother thing I remember was constantly being armed outside of the unit area. The shortage of truck and M151 Jeep parts also sticks out in my mind. The most sad part of my experience was losing two of my men to enemy related events. I might add that upon arrival in Vietnam, it was in November and very cold at night in the Central Highlands. I remember several times waking up to find that a rat had crawled up on top of my blanket and had nestled itself on my stomach for warmth. Upon my waking, the rat would scurry away and I would be wide awake all day long. I wish to thank the state of South Dakota for offering this event.\n\n• Wenton W. Peters, Mitchell, SD\n\nI was proud to have served my country in Vietnam and elsewhere for more than 30 years. I was honored to display the small South Dakota state flag that was sent to me from the state Capitol while I was serving in Vietnam. And I was pleased that the state legislature approved a bonus for veterans of the Vietnam era.\n\n• Calvin L. Peterson, North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina\n\nIn July of 1969 I was sent to Vietnam with a few days of special training to an area where people died on a daily basis. I was promoted fast. I risked my life on a daily basis and was told when I came home by my favorite girl friend attending USD that she couldn’t be seen with me by any of her university friends because what I did by serving was wrong.\n\nI tried to join the VFW and the guy behind the bar said he couldn’t stop me but it really wasn’t a war. That must be why I only know of one person I killed. I didn’t sign up until years later. I was asked to join the American Legion in a small town, Wakonda, 20 miles, from my home American Legion.\n\nI was asked in the 1980s to join the VFW by a friend and I did. When I was elected Commander I was under pressure from a couple of World War II vets to the point I resigned six months later. I stayed out of the VFW and was then asked to come back because they needed Vietnam veterans' support. They just couldn’t understand why they still to this day have only two active Vietnam vets. I have since served as Commander four straight terms and have been Senior Vice Commander ever since.\n\nI was appointed to State Special Olympics Chairman and served for four years. A new state commander came in and assigned a Korean Vet to help me. I watched the income grow for four years. Suddenly I couldn’t be trusted by myself. I became the only chairman with an assistant. I resigned.\n\nTo this day I regret that I didn’t go to Canada. They seem to have been better accepted.\n\nI was put in for a second Bronze Star that I never received after successfully being in charge of a four month long secret classified mission just before I came home. I was offered the chance to move to from E-5 to E-6. I didn’t and still don’t want anything from anybody relating to my Vietnam High School Class Trip. The only reason I am going to the dedication is because I have been the Chairman of the Clay County Veterans' Memorial in Vermillion for five years and probably will until I can’t go on.\n\n• Leo F. Powell, Vermillion, SD\n\nStill a member of the South Dakota Air National Guard and will have completed 34 years in December 2005. Currently hold the rank of Chief Master Sgt (E-9).\n\n• Bruce A. Swan, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nMany people do not know that the United States Coast Guard had a part in the Vietnam War. The Coast Guard had both sea-going and shore-based units. I served on a LORAN (LOng Range Aids to Navigation) monitor station near Udorn, Thailand from August 1970 to August 1971. This station was on the Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base. We were one of five stations in the SE Asia chain. LORAN was the system of navigation used by all the other services. Ours was the monitor station that kept the other ones “on time and in tolerance”. My job on the station was a LORAN and COMS watch stander. The station had a crew of about 25-30 men. We worked hard and also played hard. The friendships I made in Thailand during the War were special; we were more than friends, we were family.\n\n• Edward D. Timm, Elkton, SD\n\nI was a combat engineer which dealt with explosives such as booby traps, mine clearing and blowing things up as ordered. I was involved in seven counter-insurgent operations and countless search and destroy missions. Many stories but will keep them to myself—some things you don’t want to recall.\n\n• Kenneth D. Trigg, Pierre, SD\n\nI served as the Senior Radio Operator (O5B10) for the advisory team from October 11, 1971 until August 24, 1972. Chau Doc is on the Mekong River next to the Cambodian border about 50 miles from Phnom Penh. We had six advisory teams in the field assisting the Vietnamese Army when I arrived in 1971, but only one team remained when I left in 1972. I was given an honorable discharge on February 22,1973. I reenlisted the Army in 1979 and retired as a MSG in 2000.\n\n• Randal L. VonEhwegen, Vermillion, SD\n\nThough I served in the Navy during the Vietnam era, I returned to South Dakota and joined the National Guard serving in the 147th FA in Aberdeen, Webster, then in the Medical Clearing company in Winner, SD. In 1980, I went back on active duty in the Army Reserve, and have retired in Georgia. I sometimes miss South Dakota, and travel there often. But my children, and grand children are in Georgia, thus I am a misplaced “Dakotan”.\n\n• Daniel L. Walker, Homer, GA\n\nEntered Vietnam with MCB 5 as a steelworker. Spent three months in Tan An on a team as a welder. Then was attached to Detail Mustang in the Delta at Cau Mau building a base for the ARVN.\n\n• Jim Pelle, Ft. Pierre, SD\n\nI was drafted in 1967 after one year of college at Northern State University. Did training in Seattle, WA, then Ft. Sill, OK. Served in Vietnam in Army artillery, 175mm and 8 in. guns, at FSB Santa Barbara, also known as French Fort, located about 10 km north of Tay Ninh City. Extended my tour in-country so I could get out of service early. Achieved Sgt. E5, MOS 13B40 artillery gunner. Arrived back in \"the world\" in Oakland, CA, in June 1969. Please see my photos and poems submitted to this website.\n\n• Larry Kleinschmidt, Sunderland, Massachusetts\n\nI was present when Richard Rennolet was killed by the accidental explosion of a white phosphorous grenade. His name is on the Vietnam Memorial Wall located at the lake by the Capital. I think it is important to note that some good young men and women died as the result of accidents and friendly fire which are also part of the danger of being in a war zone.\n\n• Edward Dvorak, Lakebay, Washington\n\nAfter graduation from high school in 1948, Deane was accepted into the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Shortly after his commission as an Ensign in 1952, Aldern completed flight training and took on the role of Naval Aviator in March of 1954. He first served with Utility Squadron \"Seven\" and was later transferred to Fighter Squadron \"Ninety-Four\" where he served aboard the attack carriers USS Yorktown and USS Hornet in the Pacific. Captain Aldern then returned to the Naval Academy as an instructor in air navigation and military studies.\n\nIn 1961, Captain Aldern served as a flight deck officer on board the USS Enterprise on an extended deployment during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1964, he reported to Fighter Squadron \"One Hundred Seventy-Four\" and then Fighter Squadron \"Eleven\" before being assigned as operations officer of Air Wing \"One\" aboard the USS Roosevelt in the Mediterranean. In 1966, Captain Aldern became executive officer and commanding officer of Fighter Squadron \"One Hundred Ninety-One\" aboard the USS Ticonderoga, where he completed two combat tours in Southeast Asia. After further training at the Air War College in Alabama, Captain Aldern became the commander of Air Wing \"Nineteen\" aboard the USS Oriskany.\n\n• Donald Aldern, San Diego, CA (Deceased)\n\nI served in Thailand at the end of the Vietnam War as a 2nd LT assigned to the 432 Tactical Recon Wing at Udorn, Thailand (15 Jul 1973-30 Dec 1974). My duties were to provide intelligence support and hostile threat briefings to RF-4E Phantom reconnaissance aircrews flying photo recon missions over Cambodia and Laos. In the fall of 1974, I provided the initial intelligence briefings on the resupply and buildup of North Vietnamese Army forces for the final invasion of the Republic of South Vietnam in April 1975.\n\nWhile at Udorn, I also served as the Chief of the Intelligence Training Branch, providing aircrew instruction on Evasion and Escape techniques, air defense threats, and aircraft recognition. In October 1973, I attended the USAF Jungle Survival School at Clark AB in the Philippines. My final career USAF assignment was as Director of Intelligence for the 28 Bomb Wing and 44 Strategic Missile Wing at Ellsworth AFB, SD. I retired in 1992 as a Lt. Colonel.\n\n• Kenneth S. Moon, Rapid City, SD\n\nI was a PC3 (postal clerk) and it was a huge job always getting the mail to the shipmates, especially when we functioned in and around Vietnam. The first time I went on shore to get the mail was in Chu Lai and it was only a large area of sand. In one year's time, I had the opportunity to go back to the same base to get the mail and when I stepped on shore it was hard to believe that this huge base had actually been built in so little amount of time. Getting the mail in DaNang was a lot more dangerous as we passed through danger zones to get to the base to retrieve the mail then back to our ship. When we hauled and delivered some gun boats to the mouth of the Saigon river, I then realized the dire need for the people there to have these gun boats to fight their cause.\n\n• Jon Dahlke, Rapid City, SD\n\nNot all days were bad in Lai Kai, Vietnam. There were some good times had by some of the men. Like the time a few of us decided we needed a little more beer, but how were we to get to Saigon to get some. The answer came when the pilot of a Huey said it was simple, we'll take the Huey. Sounds as simple as taking you dad's car, right? So several of us boarded the Huey and we flew to Saigon. We bought several cases of beer and loaded them on the Huey, then we decided to see some of the town. We found a hotel, the Mai Lin, I think, where we enjoyed a hot shower, electricity, and a hot meal. We then flew back to our camp. Did we get into a little trouble??? Yes. Would we have done it anyway?? Yes. If I could find the guys who were with me, I would tell them: Thank you for helping make the war a lot more bearable.\n\n• Darold K. Richards, Sisseton, SD\n\nIn November 1999, I returned to Vietnam on a mission trip. There I met a young woman Vietnamese interpreter who I struck up a friendship with and we continued correspondence after returning home. The following year I returned with my wife again on the wheelchair mission. We reunited with the young woman and she gave us what was supposed to be the remains of an American soldier including one dog tag. After returning home with these items we verified the dog tag as that of an MIA. With the assistance of Argus Leader reporter David Kranz and Sen. Tom Daschle the remains were identified through DNA tests as being Luther Ritchey, Jr., a Marine from Ohio, who was reported missing in October of 1963. In 2004 his remains were returned to his family in Ohio and buried with full military honors. This was a very emotional and gratifying experience after serving in Vietnam 33+ years ago.\n\n• Douglas Haugstad, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nMember Legion Post 22, Gillette Wyoming, Member of Honor Guard. Would be honored to play Taps at this event.\n\n• Gary Rye, Gillette, WY\n\nBeing in the Air Force was dramatically different, safer, and far less stressful than for many other GI's. Since I worked in administrative support functions, work weeks were 60 hours. I flew an \"IBM Selectric\" typewriter. Working in Personnel did, however, have some interesting and satisfying moments. The best was being able to schedule Air Force personnel on their \"freedom birds\". The absolute worst part of the job was being so far away from family and home. Recalling other fun parts involves remembering the Saturday night parties at the Tan San Nhut clinic. It was similar to a modern MASH. The medical staff were outrageous and outstanding and the \"network\" and cooperation of numerous base-wide individuals combined with their influence and access to resources allowed extensive partying. Those brief escapes seemed to provide enough diversion to make it through the next week. I obviously scheduled myself on the very first \"bird\" available in my set departure month.\n\n• John Simpson, Pierre, SD\n\nI was drafted, receiving my notice to report for a physical on July 13, 1969 at the Sioux Falls post office. The very next morning, I was standing at attention in Ft. Lewis, Washington. Eight weeks later, I was flown to San Antonio, Texas, Fort Sam Huston, where I spent ten weeks being trained as a medic. I arrived in Vietnam on Dec. 13, 1969. I was sent to the 4th infantry 3/12th to serve as a platoon medic on Dec. 20, 1969. I spent all but three days in the jungle around Plecu in the central highlands of Vietnam until after five months I was hit with shrapnel from a R.P.G. I spent the next 5 months in military hospitals. I was discharged on April 13,1971. Fast trip! If you have to go to war, going as a medic is clearly a great way to go.\n\n• Roger Andal, Brandon, SD\n\nThe majority of my time in DaNang, Vietnam, I was assigned to the Navy's Security, Intelligence, Investigation Unit involved with the investigation and interdiction of activities as directed by the Admiral. Those activities involved a wide variety of opportunities ranging from drug use and trafficking, to black market activities, self inflicted wounds, unexplained shootings, AWOL and unusual disappearances, and anything else that might have come up. It was a rather interesting opportunity at the time.\n\n• Edward A. Parkhurst, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nI was in Vietnam 1967 to 1969. I was there during the 1968 Tet Offensive. For me, it is still hard to talk about it. My best friend was killed at that time. His name was Michael Kolarov. He was from Akron, Ohio. He was killed in Hua Nghia with the 101st Airborne. He is on Panel 45W—Line 53 on the Wall in Washington DC. He was killed Sept. 6, 1968. I guess I will have that with me until the day I die. To me, it's important to tell his story rather than mine. I'm still here, but he's not. Rest in peace, my friend.\n\n• Samuel Jack, Hurley, SD\n\nIn December 1953, tired of school, I dropped out of the School of Mines in Rapid City and enlisted in the U. S. Marine Corps for a 3 year “get away from school” tour. That didn’t work out as the Marines sent me to a year of electronics maintenance school. After school, I married my high school sweetheart and headed for a 3 ½ year tour at Cherry Point, NC. Liking it in the Corps, I extended my enlistment 1 year then re-enlisted for six more years. The Corps sent me back to school after which I served my first overseas tour with MASS-2 in Japan. Upon return, I was one of twelve enlisted Marines selected to attend yet another school, this a factory school on an experimental computerized air defense system. During the field testing phase of this Marine Tactical Data System (MTDS) I was selected to attend the Warrant Officer screening course which gave me an advancement from SSGT to Warrant Officer in 1963. In 1965, I was promoted to 2nLt.and two years later through 1st Lt. to Captain. In 1968-69, I was assigned Maintenance Officer duties on the MTDS on Monkey Mountain, Vietnam. After returning to CONUS, a 2 year tour in NC was served before being assigned to the USMC CommElectSchool in 29 Palms, CA.\n\nDuring that tour while serving as School Director for ElecMaintSchool, I was promoted to Major. Retirement followed a year later in August 1975. My attempt to avoid school failed me but I had a very rewarding Marine Corps career because of my military schooling. My marriage has thus far survived over 50 years and we have raised two wonderful children. Semper Fi to all my Marine friends!\n\n• Gerald D. Fabricius, Twentynine Palms, CA\n\nCome With Me, My Brother\n\nCome with me, my Brother; to the past which seems so near;\n\nThe past of fallen soldiers and young men overwhelmed with fear;\n\nFear of loss and fear of death in a place so far from home;\n\nCompelled us all to anger; at times you feel alone;\n\nCome with me, my Brother; tell me of your pain;\n\nThe jungle heat, the stench of blood and endless monsoon rain;\n\nI want to know about your friends; the guy who died that day;\n\nTalk about your demons in that place so far away;\n\nCome with me, my Brother; abandon the lonely road;\n\nFor 30 years, you’ve held it in, that very heavy load;\n\nOur time is short; life is dear; Brother, why can’t you see;\n\nThat through your tears, I’m here to help and try to set you free;\n\nCome with me, my Brother; let’s go and see our parade;\n\nOf flags, of guns, of bands and such; of heroes we are made;\n\nWhat’s done is done; our time has come; the War has finally passed;\n\nWe’ll cry and hug and celebrate, our welcome home at last;\n\nCome with me, my Brother; passing to the light;\n\nOne thing to do before we go, knowing that it’s right;\n\nHe fought and died just as we; I only wish we knew;\n\nHow to heal our wounds with Charlie; for he’s our Brother too.\n\nCome with me, my Brother.\n\nJohn G. Moisan, Fort Pierre, SD\n\n(US Army – 1LT Signal Corps - 1969-1971)\n\n(For my friends Joe and John)\n\nAfter graduating from Washington high school in 1963, I attended Augustana and Sioux Falls College working at John Morrell and Company. I enlisted in May of 1965 in the Marines hoping my best friend Paul Evans would join me. Unfortunately he did and was killed in December of 1966. Camp Evans just outside Quang Tri was named after him, this was an unheard of honor in the Marines as he was an enlisted man.\n\nI was sent to San Diego, CA for boot camp and qualified for the Air Wing. Then I was sent to Memphis, TN for aircraft maintenance training and stationed at LTA in Santa Anna, CA for further training as a helicopter crewman. HMM 165 was forming up with the new CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters and I was a charter member. We got orders to Vietnam in August 1966 and landed in DaNang September. I flew as a gunner and crewmember while working in maintenance control. We flew primarily around Chu Lai and DaNang with frequent trips to Khesan and some special operations into Laos and the Ho Chi Minh trail.\n\nLuckily, I was not wounded but our squadron took many casualties. I would meet Larry Winterton who was later killed in a rocket attack. He was from Sioux Falls also. After thirteen and a half months, I received orders to Olathe, KS, where I worked as maintenance supervisor on F-8 Crusaders. My commander was Col. Darrell Bjorkland from Volga, SD. I returned to Sioux Falls College getting a BA degree in 1972. In 1973, I joined the SD Army National Guard and served in various positions in an ordnance company, and combat engineer. I eventually was promoted to Command Sergeant Major of the153rd Combat Engineer Battalion in Huron, SD, and the 109th Engineer Group in Rapid City. I retired in 1995 and at that time was working as the Superintendent at the State Veterans Home in Hot Springs. I retired from the State in 2001 and live in Rapid City where I stay involved in the veterans' community spending winters in Mesa, AZ at our winter residence.\n\n• Loren L. Murren, Rapid City, SD\n\nThe Distinguished Flying Cross Award.\n\nCaptain Thomas George distinguished himself by extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight as a C-130 pilot for the 21st Tactical Squadron at Kontum, Republic of Vietnam, on 17 May 1972. On that date, Captain George flew an emergency night resupply mission of critically-needed ammunition and supplies to the besieged defenders of Kontum. In spite of heavy antiaircraft fire and intense small arms activity, Captain George was able to offload his cargo and safely evacuate two dozen allied soldiers. The aircraft took ground fire on takeoff and battle damage inspection after successful mission termination showed ten hits. The professional competence, aerial skill, and devotion to duty displayed by Captain George reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.\n\n• Thomas A. George, Federal Way, WA\n\nI was assigned to Sioux Falls, SD in April of 1972 as Liaison for the South Dakota Civil Air Patrol.\n\nAfter I retired from the United States Air Force, I lived in Sioux Falls, Montrose, Beresford and Mitchell and I worked in Sioux Falls, Yankton, and Mitchell. I have lived in South Dakota longer than I have lived anywhere and four of our six children were born in Sioux Falls. I am now retired and loving Mitchell, South Dakota.\n\n• James M. Hayes, Mitchell, South Dakota\n\nI served two voluntary tours with the 173rd Abn Bde (Sept) during the “Battle for the Highlands” and the 1968 Tet Offensive. The 173rd Airborne Brigade was the most highly decorated combat unit in the Vietnam War. The 173rd was General Westmoreland’s “Fire Brigade” which was sent to all the “Hot Spots”.\n\n• Jerald K. Lytle, Fort Thompson, SD\n\nIn 1987, our family had a coming home party for my brother. I ordered all his medals and our whole family was there. He was very happy. As he looked at all the medals he asked how I did this. So I told him it was a lot of hard work but worth every moment. He cried and he and I became closer than ever.\n\nMy brother-in-law, another Vietnam vet, attended and he made the comment that he wished someone would do this for him too. I know that he plans to attend this event, so please welcome him home too. My brother died at age 50. I miss him everyday, 24/7.\n\n• Terry Wayne Heminger\n\nNo stories. Very proud to have served my state and country.\n\n- Orvin L. Hughart, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nI joined the Marines in 1950 to serve in Korea and remained in the military until 1959. In 1965 I joined the Navy SeaBee Reserves in Sioux Falls, SD. In 1968 I went on active duty in Naval Construction Battalion MCB3. They were already in Vietnam. Since I had been in the Marines, my duty was to walk night combat patrols searching for Viet Cong. I was also a Construction Mechanic. I retired from the Navy SeaBees in April 1979.\n\nI went on active duty because of the \"war protesters\" at that time. I believe in this great country and am a flag-carrying American! I'm 74 years old and would still go to war to serve the country if they would let me.\n\n- William P. Huntimer, Dell Rapids, SD\n\nMost of my duty was providing medical treatment for Marines coming back from Vietnam (Naval Hospital Camp Pen). The most disturbing thing that happened during my enlistment was hearing a Navy Corpsman belittling one of these brave men. Needless to say, this only happened ONCE! But, seeing the hurt in the eyes of that Marine has stayed with me for all these years. Our service men and women did a hell of job, we just didn't have a country (then) that recognized it. I'm glad to see that we do now.\n\n- Greg S. Ingemunson, Black Hawk, SD\n\nOur Unit in the Fifth Marines was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for being the first full-size battalion in Vietnam. Our unit was the basis for the movie named \"Rumors of War.\"\n\n- Paul B. Karst, Peever, SD\n\nAfter the many years, recollections of the sights, sounds and smells of certain \"events\" in the Saigon District and IV Corps are as vivid and clear as if it was this morning. I trust that the sacrifice of everyone that the Vietnam Memorial dedication honors, including the veterans' families at home and the countless unnamed civilian casualties, will be remembered long after the event.\n\n- Robert J. Kean, Pierre, SD\n\nThe mail going home was real slow and my mom was praying for me and all the other men and women over there. She asked the Lord to send her a robin to let her know I would make it home. When my mom was finished praying, she went to the window of our home. There in the yard were 30 robins. So now as I pray for the men and women at war. I ask the Lord to touch each and every mother and father with kids there.\n\n- Dennis L. Kearns, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nWhen I entered the Marine Corps, I already had two sisters that were Marines. Karen and I were stationed together at El Toro and Jan was already out and married to a Marine. The three of us are all Paid Up For Life members of Wm H Crippen Post #62 in Humboldt, South Dakota, even though none of us live in Humboldt. We are all proud Marines.\n\n- Judy Ann Klima, Saint Charles, Illinois\n\nMy Army story is not one of heroics or valor but one that may ring true for many veterans, especially women. When I joined, women were trained separately from men and were not sent to combat areas, except for nurses and a few other exceptions. Like many young people, I could not wait to leave home and prove myself. After basic training and AIT, I was assigned as a medic to Valley Forge Army Hospital in Pennsylvania. I worked in an orthopedic ward and almost all of our patients had been wounded in Vietnam. I changed thousands of dressings, hung traction, rolled skin grafts, did pre-op and post-op care. I also folded probably tons of laundry, emptied urinals, took TPR's, made beds and listened...listened to the moans and sometimes screams of men in pain, listened to them talk about family back home, listened to their fears of what would be their future and listened to the joy of hearing they were going home. It was hard work, it was sometimes heartbreaking work, but most of all, it was rewarding work.\n\nI still think of that time in my life and wonder what happened to my patients. I hope that I eased their pain a little because it was the most responsible and rewarding job I have ever had, and I tried my best to be good at it.\n\n- Patricia A. Kroupa, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nAs I remember back, I had no fear or idea of the real world. All I knew was trust in everyone I was around. We lived together 24 hours a day and lived as one. Oh, what a black-out in my life. I was discharged at Travis AFB and told to put my civilian cloths on (for fear of trouble) and go home. I went to Aberdeen and applied for a job with AT&T because they were hiring. They asked me a few questions and then asked if I had just returned home from Vietnam. I said yes, and the man quickly told me, \"We are not hiring Vietnam vets.\" So my new life began...\n\n- Dennis L. Lau, Weston, MO\n\nI was on duty in Korea when I was sent TDY into Thailand to serve at Camp Friendship to help maintain a Ghost Division. When regular troop replacements reported, I was told that I could leave. Without a passport, I was told that I could not go out through normal challenges. One night about 9pm I was called to company headquarters, I was told that there would be a plane at the dark end of the runway warming its engines at 11pm, the door would be open. A friend took me to the area, I jumped the fence, boarded a C47 and we went out over Laos to Saigon where I caught an official military flight back to Korea to finish my tour there.\n\n- Lawrence R. Madsen, Gettysburg, SD\n\nI am a retired career USAF officer, having served for over 30 years. I was in Vietnam from November 1969 through October 1970. I was assigned to the 8th Aerial Port Squadron at Tan Son Nhut AB, near Saigon. My duties involved supervision of the load crews for all tactical airlift originating and terminating at TSN during my 12 hour shift for around 600 flights daily. This was a dangerous and demanding duty, operating in often very difficult weather conditions, heat, and rain, where oppressive humidity was the norm, and often in blackout conditions on what was, at the time, the world's busiest airfield. We were occasionally fired on by 122mm rockets and large mortars. One of my duties was to insure all human remains returned from the fields of battle via airlift to TSN for processing at the US Army Mortuary at TSN were expeditiously handled. These remains were usually in a body bag or wrapped in a rubber \"poncho\", neither of which were barriers to the blood, gore and smell of recently killed humans. I helped handle over 2,000 such remains during my tour. I also flew five combat missions in 0-1E Bird Dog reconnaissance aircraft over the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the spring of 1970, flying with Walt and Pterodactyl Forward Air Controllers (FACS) out of Ghia Nhia in the Central Highlands. Two South Dakotans killed in the Vietnam War were my close personal friends; Captain Chuck Lane from Tabor was my classmate at Yankton College and 1st Lieutenant Bob \"Chomp\" Lewis from Pierre was my childhood friend and classmate at Northern State College.\n\n- Lawrence R. Mayes, Rapid City, SD\n\nI spent my entire time in Southeast Asia as a field artillery fire support officer/coordinator in a daily combat environment with infantry units at platoon, company, battalion & brigade levels. In that capacity, I had the fortune of working very closely with many wonderful people who still influence my life even today. I owe my very life to many who were not as fortunate as me. Six of the commanders I worked directly with became four-star generals.\n\n- David R. Morgan, Huron, SD\n\nIt was Christmas Eve, 1969, Camp Love, Vietnam just south and west of DaNang. The War Gods had essentially called a \"time out.\" The officers of my battalion were gathered in a rather safe structure made from granite stone and mortar which was appropriately called the \"Officers Club.\" On this night, we were kicking back, drinking beer and being entertained by a USO sponsored band from the Philippines. The three gals and two guys slaughtered the Christmas carols we knew and remembered but we all joined in, never-the-less, in a surrealistic celebration of Christmas Eve. Weapons, helmets and flak jackets were hung on the pegs in the wall by the door and the evening was transitioning to a pleasant state of melancholy.\n\nAll of a sudden the familiar sounds of M-16 and M-60 machine gun fire broke out in the northern sector (my sector) of our compound. The officers scrambled for their weapons and gear and returned to their respective sectors of the defensive perimeter. I'm sure the Filipino band hit the deck, but I didn't turn back to check. By the time I reached my company's position, the sky was lit up like the 4th of July. Flares hung in the sky everywhere. Tracer rounds streaked out over our wire into the valley between our compound and the FLC compound a half-mile away. My Battalion S-3 was shouting over the radio asking where the fire was coming from. Nobody knew. All of the fire seemed to originate from our side of the barbed wire and no fire was being returned. \"Cease Fire, Cease Fire!\" was relayed to every fox hole and every bunker until only the hiss of the remaining flares in the sky could be heard. A call out for a report of casualties was made. No casualties.\n\n\"Who started firing, first?\"\n\nNo response.\n\n\"What the hell were we firing at?\"\n\nNo response.\n\n\"Why in hell were we firing our weapons?\"\n\nA humble voice from a yet-to-be determined foxhole finally replied: \"'Cause it's Christmas, sir.\"\n\n- Monty K. Nereim, San Diego, CA\n\nThe Vietnam experience was both good and bad! I've seen many people suffer the horrors of war, yet at the same time, I made life-long friends. We as SeaBees were largely made up of skilled building tradesmen that did a lot of construction work that still is in use today, such as bridges, airports, roads, powerlines, railways and water systems. We were lucky in that much of our service in Vietnam was a contribution both to the U.S. Military and to the people of Vietnam.\n\n- John North, Huron, S D\n\nH.C. Nupen was awarded his first Distinguished Flying Cross for extraordinary achievement during the Tet Offensive of 1968. On Feb. 1st, Nupen was in Ban Me Thuot during the enemy invasion. He was able, along with another gunship, to lift-off and see that an entire city block, containing 125 Marines, was completely surrounded and was sure to be overrun. With extremely accurate rocket launches and repeated mini-gun passes, through heavy automatic weapons fire, Nupen and the second gunship were able to drive the enemy from the area and were given full credit for saving the lives of the U.S. Marines.\n\nNupen's second Distinguished Flying Cross was awarded while flying in support of a long range reconnaissance patrol. The patrol came under heavy attack by hostile forces. Nupen didn't realize that the mini-guns were malfunctioning until in full attack position. Despite the malfunction, he flew in over the enemy making it look like he was going to fire and drew the attack towards him. These dry firing passes diverted the attention of the enemy away from the patrol. Learning that the hostile force was within 100 meters of the troops, Nupen made a highly accurate rocket pass that disorganized the hostiles and allowed another helicopter to rescue the patrol.\n\nNupen completed over 1500 sorties, including assisting in a rescue of a downed F-100 pilot in Cambodia. In 1971, the Nupen brothers initiated a memorial scholarship fund at SDSU honoring the school's graduates killed in Vietnam. This scholarship is still in existence today.\n\n- Harlan C. Nupen\n\nMy South Vietnamese friends had next to nothing in material goods, but enjoyed life and loved their families and friends. I'm happy that we were able to help them, but they already had the most important things in life.\n\n- Steven J. Ogden, Louisville, TN\n\nI have a lot of stories and memories of being on the USS Constellation and the short time I was in DaNang, Vietnam.\n\n- Larry V. Ollerich, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nI learned about the June 9, 1972 Rapid City flood when my unit (the 560th MP company) received the June 12th edition of the Stars and Stripes. One of the guys who knew I was from Rapid City brought me a copy right away. Since my family lived next to Rapid Creek, I immediately sought help from my Commanding Officer to find out if my family was okay. The Red Cross in DaNang was notified by my unit, and two days later they relayed the message that my family had lost their home, but survived the flood by clinging to the roof of our house. I wanted to go home to help, but we were in the middle of the Eastertide offensive and no one was going anywhere. Later in August 1972, when I returned home, I was dismayed to see all the damage in Rapid City. Looking back on this, I sometimes wonder if I cheated death by being in Vietnam.\n\n- Gary N. Overby, Tracy, CA\n\nThese memories are still hard today: Mud, mosquitoes, red ants, hot temps, humidity, rain, mud, sweat and more mud.\n\n- Thomas L. Reecy, Dell Rapids, SD\n\nI will never forget that day in February 1968 that the Army car pulled up in our driveway. Three weeks prior, we had been notified that Dave was missing in action. The Army was there to tell my parents the news they had dreaded: Dave had been killed. As long as I live, I will never forget the grief my parents suffered over the loss of their son. They taught my brothers, sisters and I to honor and respect the sacrifice of the American soldiers and their families. My family and I are very proud of Dave and all veterans that answered their call to duty and served this great country of ours. You will never be forgotten.\n\n- David L. Rickels, Graham, TX\n\nI worked the entire four years after tech school at Scott Air Force Base-Military Airlift Command hospital. Scott also happened to be the TB control center of the AF. I trained as a 902, to work beside the RNs. I worked in the labor and delivery, ob/gyn , and for a short time in the family practice clinic.\n\nAs a 902, we could apply for flight status and go on the flights supplied by our base. Our unit was part of the Operation Baby lift at the end of the war. At MAC headquarters, we had a very large runway to accommodate some of the larger planes. Some tincluded the C5 Starlifters, C130s, and, towards the end of my stay, Harriers, which while living on base, we definitely knew when they landed and taken off. Scott has a large hospital, and it wasn't unusual at that time to deliver up to 12 babies in 24 hours. Midway through my years, we were assigned one of the AF's neonatologists in our nursery. Needless to say, we got a lot of problem pregnancies and dealt with a lot of very small, critical newborns. The smallest newborn I assisted with was 1 lb. 2 oz at birth. I thank God everyday for my own healthy children. The oldest, Jamie, was born at Scott.(After getting out of the service, I had Buck, Sammie, and later Zane. I still think about these years and the experiences (yes, we saw the Thunderbirds every year). I still use the \"chain of command\", can still tell military time, have a memorized social security number, and still use my medical training (even on the ranch animals). After having a TB test every six months for four years, still to this day, I react to the standard TB test.\n\n- Dawn A Rinehart, Highmore, SD\n\nSSG Schaffer died in 2003 from illnesses related to Agent Orange.\n\n- Dennis D. Schaffer\n\nWe arrived in Vietnam in the middle of the night and the aircraft shut off all its lights. Upon disembarking from the plane, we were instantly under a mortar attack. We were instructed to get low and run for the bunkers besides the runway. That night, I heard rockets, mortars, gunship fire, and jet aircraft taking off and landing. Flares lit up the night sky. I was scared to death. I was sure I would die my first night there.\n\nAfter my one year in Vietnam, the flight out was such a relief. There was total silence on that plane until the pilot announced we were out of Vietnam air space. Then there was a roar and applause. Yes, that night and others I will never forget.\n\n- Harlan (Harley) J. Schmidt , Tehachapi, California\n\nI had the honor of being a pilot of a Huey helicopter, the old B and C model gunships, and the H-model. We flew the two corps area in the Central Highlands. I spent one tour from Apr 1970 to Apr 1971. It was the period of \"Vietnamization\" where we got to train Vietnamese pilots. Very interesting. I saw much in that short year, but only a few occasions seem to have remained with me over the years. We were covering a convoy one day, the trucks were going one way and Vietnamese refugees were headed the other way. Everything they owned was on their backs or on their bicycles. I suppose either the Viet Cong or the Americans had torched their village. The image of all those poor souls going down the road has stuck in my memory. Another occasion was when the Koreans were involved in combat. A sister helicopter was hauling back dead bodies from the combat area and unloading them at the little landing zone where we were. Rigor mortis had already taken place and the bodies were in different positions. They simply pulled them off the helicopter onto the ground. It was a stark reminder that there were actually people losing life.\n\nOne of my crew chiefs was wounded on a mission that I was also involved in. He managed to live for several weeks. I visited him several times in the hospital at Quin Honh. I took him some letters one day, but he was unable to read them. He asked me to read them. I remember that large quonset building filled with guys that were not expected to make it. Paul Nolen died the day I left Vietnam.\n\nVietnam was a very beautiful country. We actually had good times too. We saved lives as well as took lives. It was much better when we could save them. The task, it seems, is to remember the good times and not dwell on the bad times. Sometimes we manage to do that. Other times we are not that successful at not remembering the bad.\n\n- Darwin L. Schmiedt, Woonsocket, SD\n\nIn 1968, after being discharged, I entered and stayed at the VA Hospital in Sioux Falls, SD for about three months as a patient. I was told at that time that I was their first Vietnam veteran.\n\n- Earl R. Schultz, Aberdeen, SD\n\nI attended three years of college after high school and maintained 2-S status. I took a job in Spearfish, SD and received my notice to take a physical within 30 days. 30 days later, I received my DRAFT NOTICE. All my friends were enlisting in the Navy or Air Force. I said two years would not be too long, and let myself get drafted. I was sent to Fort Lewis, WA for basic training and then to Fort McClellan, Alabama for Infantry Training, My buddies talked me into requesting Jump School in Ft. Benning, GA. I then got orders for Vietnam (it then seemed like a bad dream) until I returned to Ft. Lewis and received an early out because my time remaining in active service was less than five months. I did not get called up for reserves and did not have any contact with the Army until I received my discharge.\n\nI did not look back on my experience or talk about it until I attended a Vietnam veterans' reunion in Ft. Collins, Colorado. I have since attended The Society of the 173d Airborne reunions in Tucson, AZ and Rochester, MN. The City of Rochester gave us a real \"Welcome Home\" celebration that really made me feel like that year in Vietnam was something I should be proud of. I went back to college when I got out in 1969 and did not feel comfortable with the protests and demonstrations, but accepted the freedom that those people had to express their views. When I was drafted, I believed we should be patriotic and do our duty.\n\nToday, I have two sons that are of draft age and I hope to Hell they do not get drafted! I think it is time for this nation to take care of business at home and get rid of the war mongers that want to fight for oil. The National Guard should be at home to deal with the hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes and the flu crisis that faces this nation.\n\n- Rickford A. Schumann, Pierre, SD\n\nOur duty on both ships was to deliver Marines and their supplies to the shores of Vietnam. Then, most of the time, we would sit off the shore for days and then go pick up what was left. The Marines were always glad to see us and were glad to get hot food and a warm shower.\n\n- Keith M. Senska, Woonsocket, SD\n\nI was Life Support Supervisor at NKP Thailand. Our mission was rescuing downed pilots. We had A-1 Sky Raider Aircraft and Jolly Green Giant Helicopters.\n\n- Tom M. Sherman, Sisseton, SD\n\nI entered the Navy in Omaha, NE then went to San Diego, CA for boot camp. After that, I went to Memphis, TN for electronics schooling. Then I was sent to the USS Ranger and worked on the A-6 Intruder as a module repair technician. I was part of four cruises on the ship. We usually stayed on station for four weeks, then went to port for about six days. We flew combat missions about 12 hours a day and our shop worked 12 hour shifts, night and day.\n\n- Lee B. Squires, Clear Lake, SD\n\nMy Military Story\n\nJohn M. Sweet\n\nUS56566417\n\n24 July 1968 - 10 July 1970\n\nService in Vietnam 12 July 1969 - 10 July 1970\n\nMy first encounter with the US Army was after I graduated from high school in 1964 and was called for my first physical. This routine continued for the next four years. During the first two years at Dakota Wesleyan University, the secretary for the local draft board, Sylvia Krick, told me that as long as I had a 2.0 GPA that my deferment would stay in place. Then in 1967, the routine changed and I was told they were giving four years of deferment for college and that would be it.\n\nIt seems there were a whole lot of guys with 2.00000001 GPA's who were in their 5th, 6th,.... years of college. I graduated from DWU on Sunday, June 2, 1968. I went home on Monday, and on Tuesday my dad and I drove over to De Smet to see what Sylvia had to say. She told me that if I didn't have my draft notice by a week from Thursday I wouldn't go in until August. I received the notice a week from Thursday and was told to report on 23 July 1968.\n\nI had made up my mind long ago that I was going to take the draft, get in my two years, then get out and on with life. No regular Army for me. This proved to be a dangerous decision. I learned later that I was lacking in wisdom.\n\nGrowing up in rural South Dakota with a strong deference for authority and a patriotic spirit that was instilled by participating in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance each day in school, and by attending the American Legion Memorial Day Programs, the thought of going to Canada or even voicing objection to the war was not even considered. If the Commander-in-Chief, Richard Nixon, said that \"if Vietnam falls, there will be a domino effect all across Asia\" who was I to question such wisdom? So off I went, naive about the possibilities that existed.\n\nEven at Dakota Wesleyan University, home of the liberal Democratic nominee for President, George McGovern, there was not any dissent. McGovern brought his views to campus, but they were not accepted there or anyplace else, except Massachusetts—the only state he carried in the election. So, on 24 July 1968, I went to Sioux Falls and joined a bunch of other guys for the plane trip to Fort Lewis, Washington for Basic Combat Infantry Training. Morale among this group wasn't particularly high, to say the least. The one person I knew when I got there was Richard Rasmussen, another hometown boy. His stint didn't last long. I met one guy, Chuck Gorman, who had just graduated from college that spring and knew some of my friends at South Dakota State University. Our friendship lasted until tragedy struck later.\n\nAt the beginning of basic training, we went through a place called Classification and Assignment. Here they reviewed all your test scores, education, experience, etc. in order to determine your Military Occupation Specialty (MOS) and how your skills and abilities could best serve Uncle Sam. When I reached the final station, the guy told me, \"With your test scores and education I don't know where you will be placed but it won't be infantry.\" That was good enough for me because by then we had learned that infantry was not the place to be.\n\nAfter several weeks, my friend Richard Rasmussen was having big-time difficulty with the physical training aspects of Basic. He was born with a foot problem which hampered his athletic career all through school. Why the induction center in Sioux Falls didn't catch it during his normal physical can be attributed to two things: One, Uncle needed anyone he could get, no matter their physical condition. Two, Richard really wanted to join the Army and gain from the experience, so he didn't call attention to the problem. Richard was sent home, much to his chagrin. The rest of us were jealous.\n\nAt about week seven of basic training, our orders came down. My primary MOS was 11C40 - infantry mortars and my secondary MOS was 11B40 - rifleman. Every time we marched by the Classification and Assignment Building I wanted to go in and strangle that guy who had told me otherwise. What was really depressing was that there would be 12 more weeks of combat training in an Advanced Infantry Training Company right there at Fort Lewis. I didn't see how I could take 12 more weeks of this stuff.\n\nAt the beginning of AIT, another friend from home had been drafted. Bob Whites was a high school friend that I kept in contact with during college. He was in a basic training company at Fort Lewis and I was able to visit him in his barracks on several occasions. I felt bad for anyone who was going through this with a wife at home, as Bob was.\n\nDuring AIT, I signed up for a Non-Commissioned Officer Candidate Course at Ft. Benning, GA. Anything to delay the inevitable assignment to Vietnam. This was a new fast track program to get people trained to lead 81\" and 4.1\" mortar squads. Upon graduation, you earned the rank of E-5 (buck sergeant).\n\nOn December 13, 1968, I picked up Chuck Gorman (in a blizzard) in Tyndall, SD and we drove to Columbus, GA. We were placed in a casual company because our cycle wasn't starting until January. In the casual company we pulled KP and guard duty. We could either have off Christmas or the week after. Since I had just been home, I recruited two Basic and AIT buddies, Andy Cappelli and Chris Nelson from the San Francisco area, and we took off for Miami Beach on December 26. We had a great week in Florida during the Orange Bowl festivities. I visited my cousin, Dave Knight, who was going to graduate school at the University of Miami, along with his parents and sister who were also visiting. Chuck Gorman's brother was killed in a car-train accident near Tyndall. Chuck went home for the funeral and that was the last I saw of him.\n\nUpon return to Fort Benning, we got back into the military groove. The time at Fort Benning was pretty much uneventful. The highlight was meeting a couple of guys that I have stayed in contact with over the past 30 years. Bill Trow from Schaumburg, IL and Dave Whelan, from Great Falls, VA. After graduation, Bill and I were assigned to Fort Polk, LA as on-the-job training drill sergeants. Bill, Mark Taylor, and myself drove my car from Fort Benning to Fort Polk. Outside of Jackson, MS, we met a hometown guy, Jim Boetel, driving down the road. I recognized him and his car immediately. We spent the day touring Vicksburg, a civil war battle ground. That turned out to be quite a reunion for Jim and I while Bill and Mark sat by in disbelief that I was able to recognize Jim and flag him down.\n\nAt Fort Polk, Bill and I were co-platoon leaders for an AIT Platoon. We actually had a pretty good time leading the platoon. We took on the leadership style that we wouldn't ask the troops to do anything we wouldn't do ourselves. We led by example and the troops respected us for that. We led the forced marches carrying the same load as the trainees while the officer types' load was a canteen on a pistol belt. One of my favorite duties was leading the physical training exercises. I picked up a lot of hardcore activities from one of the Basic Training drill sergeants I had at Fort Lewis. At Fort Polk, we visited a college friend of mine, Jim Jensen, who was stationed there. He had a place off post that was what appeared to be at one time a slaves' cabin on a large plantation. This was a great retreat for Bill and I as we would bring food and beverage on occasion and relax from the rigors of infantry training.\n\nOn Memorial weekend 1969, Bill and I went to Galveston to hit the beach. We had a great time. Bill sunburned the tops of his feet and couldn't wear his boots, therefoe spending the first three days back at Fort Polk in bed with his feet propped up. He may have had a cold pack on his head also, but that wasn't from too much sun.\n\nOur tour of Fort Polk ended in June, and we had a couple weeks of leave before heading off to Vietnam. I gave Bill a ride to the Kansas City Airport on the way home and also brought Jim Jensen and his bride back to South Dakota.\n\nIn July, I departed from the Sioux Falls airport for San Francisco and the Vietnam departure point. Bill was already there when I arrived and he shipped (flew) out a day or so ahead of me. I caught up with him at Ben Hoa Airbase in Vietnam. One of the first guys I saw at Ben Hoa was Boyd Hopkins, a recent graduate from DWU. Bill thinks to this day that I know everybody in South Dakota.\n\nWe were standing beside each other when he got assigned to the 101st Airborne and I was sent to the 4th Infantry Division. We were both sent to units in the Central Highlands, as was Dave Whelan. Dave was also assigned to the 4th Division also. While the three of us were all in separate units, our trails did cross while in Vietnam.\n\nThe 4th Division was headquartered in Pleiku. The first night at base camp, I was put on perimeter guard duty. Three of us were assigned to a bunker. Two had to be up at all times during the night while the third one could sleep. The other two volunteered to take the whole night and told me I could stay in back and sleep. Sleep doesn't come easy your first night on duty. It soon became apparent that these two guys were dopers and spent the whole night shooting up on meth. I was glad to see the sun rise. The next morning, I was helicoptered to LZ Warrior, where Co. E, 1st Battalion of the 4th Infantry Division's 12 Infantry's heavy mortar platoon was operating. I was assigned as squad leader to a 4.2\" mortar gun squad. The happiest guy that day was the guy I replaced, John Sinkular from Dallas, SD. I never saw John again, but I did see his dad years later when he was commander of the South Dakota American Legion.\n\nOne of the first things I did when I knew my assigned unit was to write a letter to my high school friend Bob Whites, who had been in Vietnam a while by now. He got bored with his assignment as a clerk typist and volunteered as a door gunner on a Huey. My letter came back a few weeks later informing me that Bob had been killed in action.\n\nAs I said, my first assignment was as a squad leader of a 4.2\" mortar gun squad. We had a team of five or six guys. Our first priority was to keep the gun in firing condition and take care of the ammunition. We usually dug some kind of bunker for the ammo to keep it dry and safe. Most of our firing missions were at night against suspected enemy locations (SELS). During the day the Battalion Commander would fly around the area in a Light Observation Helicopter (LOCH) and look at what he thought were suspected enemy locations. He would plot these locations on a map. Often, these locations were fields or gardens that were thought to provide the Viet Cong with food. Other times, there may have been evidence of enemy movement in these locations or enemy ammo caches. Then we would shoot at these map locations at night. The next day, the Battalion Commander would usually report that we hit the spots, but never really knew if we had hit anything significant. Lt. Cottum, our platoon leader, complained to the Battalion Commander that these fire missions were like pissing in the ocean. There was a time when we would get dozens of map locations to drop a single round on. You would have to get almost a direct hit on whatever it was that was there to do anything. It was a whole lot of work to compute the data and aim and fire the guns at these locations and we never really knew for sure if we hit anything.\n\nOnce in awhile we would have a live fire mission, which meant we were supporting troops who were in direct contact with the enemy. The 4.2\" mortar was a very effective weapon in the Central Highlands as it was a high angle fire weapon that could fire over mountains. Whereas artillery had a lower projectory, and if the target was on the other side of the mountain, artillery couldn't hit it. We were usually located on a firebase with an artillery battery. It got pretty noisy at times when we were all blasting away. The 4.2\" mortar also had a very effective illumination round. We could really light things up at night, and often did, so that troops farther out from our location could see the enemy at night.\n\nSome of the guys I remember serving with in Vietnam include the following:\n\nRobert (Inky) Inkenbrandt, Ft. Myers, FL\n\nJerry Wells, Zanesville, OH\n\nButch Lowry, Memphis, TN\n\nGeorge Otto, Columbia, SC\n\nFidel Rodriguez, Puerto Rico\n\nDave Thornley, Ogden, UT\n\nPhil Blackwell, South Carolina\n\nTom Wood\n\nDave Bode\n\nRobert Brown, Vermillion, SD\n\nRobert Scheitrumpf, Warren, OH\n\nEd (Big Man) Newcomb\n\nLt. Cottum, Oklahoma\n\nAfter a few months on the gun squad, I was transferred to the Fire Direction Center (FDC). The FDC received the map locations of the suspected enemy locations or direct observations from forward observers. We plotted these locations on a chart and then determined what direction and angle the mortars needed to be set at. We also calculated how much charge had to be put on each round in order to propel it to the target. We then communicated the data to each gun squad. This was usually done by a phone system that we had rigged up between the FDC and the gun squads. For entertainment, the FDC jam sessions were led by Robert (Inky) Inkenbrandt of Ft. Meyers, FL.\n\nSomehow, he had brought along an always-out-of-tune guitar to Vietnam. Many nights were spent listening to him sing Glen Campbell songs: \"Wichita Lineman\" and his all-time-favorite, \"Ann.\" Audio tapes were made of these sessions and sent home. I still have the one I sent home and recently sent Inky a copy. I always thought he would be playing alongside Glen Campbell when he returned to the world, but I didn't see him when Glen was on Letterman one night. Inky went on to become a professional musician and has his own recording company, Ink-Write Productions. You can order his original music from http://www.inkwrite.com/. Be sure and check out his original recording, \"Island Dreams.\" FDC duty was better than being on a gun squad. We were usually in a protected bunker that we constructed with sandbags. We were better protected from the weather, especially during the rainy season, as well as from any stray bullets that might have been flying around. Sometimes we made the FDC bunker big enough for several to sleep in because we were always on duty ready to receive a call for fire.\n\nIt was about this time that I suffered my greatest wound of the war—an impacted wisdom tooth. I was sent to the rear in the first available helicopter and had the tooth extracted. I was suppose to stay in the rear for a week or so, but after about a day, I couldn't stand the sitting around and requested to return to the field and the FDC. I was gung-ho.\n\nThe highlight of most days for the infantryman was mail call and chow. We were suppose to get one hot meal a day. On some firebases, a field kitchen was set up and food was prepared right there. In other cases, we had meals shipped out to us in insulated containers. (I later used the same concept in shipping food from a central kitchen to other school buildings.) When we didn't have hot food we ate C-rations. Sometimes they were a welcome reprieve from the hot food that wasn't that great.\n\nWhether we got hot food or mail depended on what fighting was going on. We were always supplied by helicopter as we were, with one exception, in the field where there was no access to roads. The first priority for the helicopters was to take care of the fighting. The next priority was hot food, mail, and clothes. We were suppose to get several changes of clothes each week, but again, that depended on the priority of things. You always tried to hold on to an extra shirt, pants, underwear and socks.\n\nThe one time we did have supply access by road, we were securing an engineering unit that was building a road. We got all kinds of things when we had this duty. They would ship out huge pieces of ice that were about 8' x 2' x 2'. We would chip off enough to fill an ammo can or sand bag and cool pop and beer with it. This was the only time we ever had anything cold. One night things were getting a little dull so Sgt. Tom Wood decided he would start up one of the caterpillars and reminisce about his days back in the world working road construction after having some of that ice cold beer. There was no law against drinking and driving in Vietnam.\n\nAfter about six months in-country, it was time for R & R. I went to Sidney, Australia for a week of rest, relaxation and high living. I spent time at the beach, the zoo, and the pubs. Spending time in the pubs was really interesting. This was where the men went to do their drinking—no women allowed. Sidney is a great melting-pot of people. In the pubs, I met men from many different European countries who had immigrated to Australia. They were very interested in asking about America and the war in Vietnam. It was interesting to hear about their reasons for leaving England, France, Yugoslavia, etc. One of the best things about R & R was eating some good food and being able to keep clean for a week. After Sidney, it was back to the platoon and the downside of my year in Vietnam. Most guys counted the days they had left. I didn't do that. Today students (and some teachers) count the days left till school is out. I don't do that either.\n\nIt was now 1970 and the negative public attitude about the war at home began to drift to the troops in Vietnam. Morale was never great, but it was now declining fast. The 4th Infantry Division was gradually pulling back to the coast of Vietnam and was supposedly scheduled to leave the country at some point in the near future. Troop morale in my unit was declining as many of us were on the downside of our tour.\n\nMost of us didn't see much point in what we were trying to accomplish. Objectives were unclear and we just wanted to get by with doing as little as possible and then \"see-ya!\" Higher ranking NCO's and officers were constantly on us about not digging in properly and taking care of our own security. This would have been a good time for the Viet Cong to hit us because our state of readiness was suspect.\n\nWhen March came around, I had some leave time left and there was a vacant R & R slot to Bangkok so I took it. The week in Bangkok was interesting. This was a whole different culture and probably similar to Vietnam. Even though I spent a year in Vietnam, I can't say that I really experienced the culture because I was out in the boonies all the time. I saw Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in Bangkok, where they served beer by the quart in the theatres. I had an interesting river cruise and spent time in the shops, which loved to see American GI's with money. I had some sport jackets custom-tailored for me and sent home from Bangkok.\n\nThe day I left for Bangkok, my unit got orders to go to Cambodia. We were really sweating going to Cambodia as this was the action that Tricky Dick said would hasten the end of the war and we were expecting a lot of action. When I got back from Bangkok, my unit had already returned from Cambodia. The whole campaign was really a farce.\n\nThe Cambodian campaign brought out the troop protestors. I witnessed one guy sitting in the road facing off with an armored personnel carrier. He was physically removed and probably dealt with under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. I don't know what the penalty would be for a soldier to protest a war. From here on out, morale was in further decline. On 27 June 1970, I received orders to return to the \"world\" and prepare for ETS (estimated time of separation). On about 8 July 1970, I left Vietnam and returned to Fort Lewis, Washington and was relieved from active duty \"not by reason of physical disability.\" (This phrase on my discharge papers guaranteed Uncle Sam would have no service connected disability to pay. Sam wasn't going to recognize my impacted wisdom tooth either.) On 10 July 1970—one year, eleven months and seventeen days later from the time I stepped on that very ground for Basic Training within sight of that Classification and Assignment Building.\n\nUpon separation, I was awarded the following: the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service in connection with military operations against an armed hostile force; The Air Medal for meritorious achievement while participating in sustained aerial flight in support of combat ground forces in the Republic of Vietnam from 2 August 1969 to 25 May 1970; The Combat Infantryman Badge for participation in armed ground conflict while a member of \"The Famous Fighting Fourth Infantry Division\" in the Central Highlands of the Republic of Vietnam; a Certificate of Appreciation from General W.C. Westmoreland and another from the Commander in Chief, Richard Nixon; a plaque from the \"Officers and Men\" of the 4th Division (this always made me wonder if officers were not men); and in 1999, I received a Certificate of Recognition (which I applied for over the Internet) \"for service during the period of the Cold War (2 September 1945 - 26 December 1991) in promoting peace and stability for this Nation, the people of this Nation are forever grateful\" from William S. Cohen, Secretary of Defense. So as far as wars go, I am one for one—won one and lost one.\n\nI left the SEA-TAC Airport on 10 July 1970 on the first flight for Denver. There, I spent a day or so visiting friends, Meredith and Jan Wilson. I returned to South Dakota on a Saturday afternoon and my parents met me at Joe Foss field in Sioux Falls.\n\nDuring my time in Vietnam, our unit suffered no serious injuries or casualties. To say we were fortunate would be the understatement of the 20th Century. That wisdom tooth I suffered from turned out to be no good at all. It provided no wisdom whatsoever when I chose the draft over whatever the other alternatives were. Be that as it may, and the way everything turned, out I am proud to have served and say I am a Vietnam veteran. The military experience made me a stronger and better person. I feel a special relationship with others who have served. Everything is small stuff compared to war.\n\nThe friends I lost in Vietnam were not friends I served with in the Army, but friends I had grown up with: Bob Whites and two other members of my American Legion baseball team, Bill Biever and Ted Voight.\n\nTed Voight was the catcher in a game at Lake Preston in 1962 when I was brought in to pitch in the bottom of the 7th inning. The score was tied with no outs with the basis loaded. Ted had never caught me before and I wasn't sure if he could handle my curve ball. I struck out the first two batters with fast balls. I shook off several calls for curve balls but when I was up 0-2 on the third batter and Ted called for a curve, I threw it for a called third strike. Ted couldn't handle it and the winning run scored from third on the passed ball. I was a little upset in 1962. By 1970 I learned not to sweat the small stuff. Bill Biever played second base that game. These three and the others from the Iroquois area that served during the Vietnam era deserve a monument for answering the call of their country. They didn't protest and they didn't take other measures to avoid serving. I have a quote from a company that makes monuments and I am going to start talking it up with others. If I don't it, it doesn't look like an ungrateful society will.\n\nIn 1972, I was recalled to active duty and assigned to an infantry national guard unit out of Seattle, WA and told to report to Fort Lewis, WA for two weeks of summer training. I couldn't believe this was happening. It was deja vu all over again—my worst nightmare was going back into the Army. I went through the same procurement building to secure the same equipment I had been issued in basic training. And that Classification and Assignment Building was in sight again. We were bussed to Yakama Firing Range where the National Guard held their summer training. We were recalled because National Guard Infantry units didn't seem to attract much attention from people wanting to join the Guard to avoid Vietnam, so they called us up to get up to strength for summer training. After the first formation, one guy from South Dakota went in to Yakama and checked in to a hotel. He never showed his face again until the final formation two weeks later and was never missed. When we went to the field, another Vietnam veteran and myself fought over who would get to sleep in the cab of the truck all day. The loser would lay in the shade underneath.\n\nMy re-adjustment to civilian life occurred at South Dakota State University where I earned a Master's Degree in Education and Sam helped pay for it through the GI Bill. It was here that I met my bride of 33 years, Barb.\n\nAnd from then on I lived happily ever after.......\n\n- John M. Sweet, Delano, MN\n\nOn arriving on the Quad, my senior PO asked if I enjoyed hunting because I was from South Dakota. \"Yes, I do enjoy hunting.\" I said. After that statement, I spent quite a few hours on the gun mount. I held the position of 1st loader and eventually gun captain on the same gun mount. Should I have kept quiet and not opened my mouth?\n\n- Thomas F. Thompson, Sioux Falls, SD\n\nMy first contact with the Vietnam War was my freshman year at SDSU. As a cadet in ROTC, we were called upon to serve on a guard detail for a Brookings native and SDSU graduate that had been killed in Vietnam. I volunteered and was chosen to stand guard at the church where the service was to be held for the deceased. Our ROTC unit also assisted with the service at the gravesite. The somber memory you can never forget...\n\n- Wallace C. Thomsen, Pierre, SD\n\nMike survived with a few an ambush. He was watching an orphan and a stray dog, both were killed.\n\n- Michael P. Vinson\n\nNo story, but I am still in the military. Just returned from mobilization at Fort Hood, Texas for one year. Will retire 4 January 06 with rank of master sergeant with 31 years of service.\n\n- Scott Winegar, Huron, SD\n\nDrafted, \"Vietnam Era\" vet. I had a choice of advance training or continuing to teach at Fort Sill. I chose to go to Germany on tour. The entire duration was spent in southern Germany, thus out of harm's way in Vietnam. I had college friends who entered the service to be home in less than year, either shot up or K.I.A.\n\n- Darrel F. Woods, Onalaska, Wisconsin\n\nI'm not going to get into telling war stories, as I served with the 9th Infantry Div./Mobile Riverine Force in the Delta in 1968 through 1969. I have plenty. What I would like to comment on is the young men and women that served our country during the Vietnam conflict. We were told it wasn't a war yet. We put forth our best effort with what we were given to us by our government and carried out our mission with the orders given to us by our leaders. Sometimes with regret and loss of life, but we stuck it out, served our tour of duty and came home to \"what\". Our country lost a lot of good soldiers over there and I hope that this memorial gives us all a little closure so we can finally put this behind us. It's not going to heal everyone's wounds, but it's a step in the right direction. It's time for the Vietnam vets to finally stand beside our fellow comrades from other wars and be proud of our service to our country. Thank you, South Dakota, Governor Daugaard, and all the people who took the time and effort to put this dedication together. God Bless the USA!\n\n- Don Fechner, Wagner, SD\n\nMy military experience began in front of the Custer County Courthouse in October, 1968. Three of us constituted the draft group for Custer county that month. As I recall, two of us showed up to catch the bus to Sioux Falls. Whoever the third man was, we never saw him. My parents Bill and Lorene were there to see me off, along with some of the Knights of Columbus, who looked seriously concerned—there wasn’t any smiles to send off draftees, the Vietnam War was less and less popular all the time. The war was the major campaign issue that fall, and it had been the flash point for highly-televised unrest at the Democratic convention in Chicago that summer. With riots going on in some of the inner cities, and lots of radical rhetoric, it seemed that the country was in serious internal trouble and that trouble was now affecting me on a very personal level.\n\nNot reporting for the draft had never been a real consideration in my thinking. I knew one college classmate who had declared conscientious objector status, and he was currently being prosecuted in federal court. I couldn’t imagine taking off for Canada—I’d had five uncles in the service in World War II, and my grandfather and great-grandfather had been in the German Army prior to World War I (and before Grandpa Young emigrated). While I had no desire to continue a tradition of military service, I also had no desire to avoid what I thought of as a citizen’s duty.\n\nI remember that long day/night bus ride across South Dakota. It seemed we stopped in one town after another, picking up a few people with each stop. Hot Springs, Pine Ridge, Winner, and some eastern South Dakota communities. By the time we arrived in Sioux Falls, the bus was full. Those who passed the physical the next day were sworn in, and I recall making that one step forward to take the oath (Oct. 23, 1968), and noting that everyone else in the room did the same. But I didn’t feel a lot of patriotism at the moment, just a lot of uncertainty. We flew out of Sioux Falls to Seattle-Tacoma before the day was out.\n\nOur basic training was done at Fort Lewis, Washington. Stepping off the buses from the airport was a culturally disorienting experience—there were about 25 of us from South Dakota—and it looked like a thousand people came shoving off the buses from the Oakland-San Francisco area. I remember the distinct thought that they must have emptied the tenements and found the street people to fill out their draft quota from California, because those people did not look healthy or law-abiding! Later in Basic, it became obvious that California draft boards did not collect anybody who had family, means, or excuses to avoid the draft. So they took the poor, the minorities, and the uneducated to fill their numbers.\n\nWe went through Basic on an “accelerated” training cycle according to our company officers. As I recall, it was seven weeks from start to finish. Initially, the training was intimidating and depersonalizing—intentionally so. Later it became a matter of teaching combat and survival skills. Despite the fact that I was a college graduate and had an idea of the conditioning process, I gained esprit de corps just like everyone else, maybe with a little more self-pres"
