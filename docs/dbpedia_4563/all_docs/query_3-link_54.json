Secades USN (Ret), Published by Naval Helicopter Association, Coronado, California, 2nd Edition June 2012 and by the Naval Helicopter Historical Society research staff using official naval records.\n\n|1940 | 1950 | 1960 | 1970 | 1980 | 1990 | 2000 | 2010 | 2020\n\nNAVAL HELICOPTER HISTORY TIMELINE 400BC till 1940\n\n\n\nChinese Top-400 BC\n\nChinese develop a vertical flying top that was used as a child’s toy.\n\n\n\n1483 Leonardo Da Vinci – Sketched the “Helical Air Screw”\n\n1483 Leonardo Da Vinci – Sketched the “Helical Air Screw” the most advanced plans of the period for a helicopter.\n\n\n\n1800-1900 OTHERS in the pursuit vertical flight\n\n1800-1900 OTHERS in the pursuit vertical flight: Sir George Cayley, Thomas Edison, Wilbur & Orville Wright, Paul Cornu, Juan de la Cierva, Corradino D’ Ascanio, Heinrich Focke, and more.\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 1907, French engineer and bicycle maker Paul Cornu\n\nNovember 13, 1907, French engineer and bicycle maker Paul Cornu made history by becoming the first man to fly in a rotary wing aircraft. The primitive helicopter – a twin rotorcraft powered by a 24-horsepower engine – only lifted Cornu about five feet off the ground, holding him there for 20 seconds at Coquainvilliers, near Lisieux in France.\n\n\n\n1912 Early Navy Interest\n\n1912-An early, if limited, interest in the helicopter was shown as the Secretary of the Navy authorized expenditure of not more than $50 for developing models of a helicopter design proposed by Chief Machinist’s Mate F. E. Nelson of West Virginia (Armored Cruiser No. 5). The Secretary’s accompanying policy implication was followed with a few exceptions for the next 30 years: “The Department recognizes the value of the helicopter principle in the design of naval aircraft and is following closely the efforts of others in this direction.”\n\n\n\n1917 Policy Regarding Helicopter Development\n\n1917 The policy regarding helicopter development was established by the Secretaries of the War and Navy Departments on the basis of recommendations made by the Joint Technical Board on Aircraft. Basically, need for improvements in power plants and propellers was recognized as necessary if a successful helicopter was to be obtained, but actual support of development efforts was to be limited to moral encouragement until a vendor had demonstrated a helicopter of military value.\n\n\n\nFirst U.S. Navy Contract for Rotary Wing Aircraft\n\nJanuary 22, 1931. – The U.S. Navy ordered three XOP-1 autogiro prototypes from Pitcairn Aircraft Co., to be evaluated for naval service. This was the in history.\n\n\n\nFirst U.S. Navy Rotary Wing Aircraft Landing and Take Off from a Ship at Sea\n\nSeptember 23, 1931. – LT Alfred M. Pride, USN, piloted an XOP-1 in the first rotary wing aircraft landing and take off from a ship at sea, USS Langley (CV-1).\n\n\n\nFirst U.S. Navy Contract to Produce an Autogiro without Fixed Wings and Ailerons\n\nMarch 12, 1935. – The Navy awarded Pitcairn another contract to produce an autogiro without fixed wings and ailerons. The XOP-2 was the first Navy rotary wing aircraft without fixed wings. This modification, made possible by the implementation of cyclic control of the rotor blades pitch angle, greatly improved controllability at slow airspeeds.\n\n\n\nThe XOZ-1, BuNo A8602, an Autogiro built for the Navy by Pennsylvania Aircraft Syndicate\n\n.August 9, 1937. – The XOZ-1, BuNo A8602, an autogiro built for the Navy by Pennsylvania Aircraft Syndicate, performed demonstration flights, including water landings and take-offs. This autogiro was a modified N2Y-1 tandem-seat biplane trainer.\n\nThe overall results of evaluations during the 1930s convinced the Navy hierarchy that the autogiro could not satisfactorily meet naval requirements. The Navy needed a hovering vehicle. It would have to wait a few more years before that need could be fulfilled.\n\n\n\nInter-Agency was creaCed to Administer the Rotary Wing Development Program\n\nJune 30, 1938. – An Inter-Agency was created to administer the rotary wing development program funded by the Dorsey Act. CDR William J. Kossler, USCG, represented the Coast Guard. He would become one of the “Founding Fathers” of helicopter naval aviation.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Army Awarded a Contract to Build an Experimental Helicopter, the XR-1\n\nJuly 19, 1940. – The U.S. Army Material Division awarded Platt-LePage Aircraft Co. a contract to build an experimental helicopter, the XR-1, a twin-side-by-side-rotors design based on the technology of the German Focke-Wulf Fw-61. This was the second helicopter contract awarded by the U.S. military; the first, awarded by the Army to the Russian émigré George de Bothezat in 1921, had failed to produce a practical helicopter.\n\nNAVAL HELICOPTER HISTORY TIMELINE 1940 till 1950\n\n\n\nCommander D. Royce was Designated to Represent the Navy\n\nApril 23, 1940-Commander D. Royce was designated to represent the Navy on an Army Air Corps Evaluation Board for rotary-wing aircraft. This board was established incidental to legislation directing the War Department to undertake governmental development of rotary-wing aircraft.\n\n\n\nXSOC-1 Conducted Successful Operations\n\nMay 20,1940-The Commanding Officer of the destroyer Noa (DD 343) reported on successful operations conducted off the Delaware Capes in which an XSOC-1, piloted by Lieutenant G. L. Heap, was hoisted over the side for takeoff and was recovered by the ship while underway. As an epilogue to preliminary operations conducted at anchor on 15 May, Lieutenant Heap made an emergency flight transferring a stricken seaman from the Noa in Harbor of Refuge, Del., to the Naval Hospital, Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nIgor Ivanovich Sikorsky - Designed and Flew the FIRST successful United States Helicopter\n\nMay 24 1940- Igor Ivanovich Sikorsky – (05/25/1889 – 10/26/1972) – Designed and flew the FIRST successful United States helicopter, the Vought-Sikorsky 300 (VS-300).\n\n\n\nU.S. Army Awarded Sikorsky Aircraft a Contract to Build the XR-4 Single-Main-Rotor and Tail Rotor Helicopter\n\nDecember 17, 1940. – The U.S. Army awarded Sikorsky Aircraft a contract to build the XR-4 single-main-rotor and tail rotor helicopter prototype. Sikorsky would use this configuration in all his future helicopter designs. The XR-4 first flew on 13 January 1942.\n\n\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Tranferred to the Navy Department\n\nNovember 1, 1941. – In view of the deteriorating diplomatic situation and anticipating the break of hostilities in both, the Atlantic and the Pacific theaters, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order transferring operational control of the U.S. Coast Guard to the Navy Department.\n\n\n\nSikorsky Offered a XR-4 Flight Demonstration for the Army and Representatives of the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, and the Royal Navy. USCG\n\nApril 20, 1942. – Sikorsky offered a XR-4 flight demonstration for the Army and representatives of the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, and the Royal Navy. USCG CDR Watson A. Burton, Commanding Officer of the New York Coast Guard Air Station, Floyd Bennett Field, Brooklyn, NY, and CDR William J. Kossler, who was serving as Chief of the Aviation Engineering Division at Coast Guard Headquarters, witnessed the demonstration. They agreed that the helicopter could meet the requirements of a rescue vehicle and proposed that three helicopters be procured for test and evaluation. Their proposal was immediately rejected.\n\n\n\nCDR Kossler, in his Quest to Bring to Fruition the Naval Helicopter\n\nMay 1942. – CDR Kossler, in his quest to bring to fruition the naval helicopter, arranged for his protégée, LCDR Frank A. Erickson, an experienced seaplane pilot and a fervent helicopter advocate, to be assigned as Executive Officer of the New York Coast Guard Air Station. With their shared enthusiasm for the helicopter as a rescue vehicle, Kossler wanted to bring Erickson close to the Sikorsky factory.\n\n\n\nPresident Ordered that an Air Medal be Established\n\nMay 11, 1942-The President ordered that an Air Medal be established for award to any person who, while serving in any capacity in or with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard after 8 September 1939, distinguishes or has distinguished himself by meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight.\n\n\n\nLCDR Erickson Visited the Sikorsky Plant in Connecticut\n\nJune 26, 1942. – LCDR Erickson visited the Sikorsky plant in Connecticut and inspected the XR-4 development program. Three days later he submitted a report to Headquarters recommending the procurement of helicopters for convoy antisubmarine patrol and search and rescue duty. Knowing that the Navy was very concerned with the convoy losses in the Atlantic caused by German submarines, Erickson placed emphasis on the helicopter antisubmarine role.\n\n\n\nThe Bureau of Aeronautics issued a Planning Directive for the Procurement of four Sikorsky helicopters\n\nJuly 24, 1942. – The Bureau of Aeronautics issued a Planning Directive for the procurement of four Sikorsky helicopters, one YR-4 and three XR-6s, for evaluation by the Navy and Coast Guard. CDR Kossler convinced the Commandant of the Coast Guard, ADM Russell R. Waesche, to obtain authorization from ADM Ernest J. King, Chief of Naval Operations, to establish a Coast Guard helicopter test and evaluation program.\n\n\n\nCommander in Chief U.S. Fleet Directed that an Aircraft Experimental and Developmental Squadron be Established\n\nAugust 13, 1942-The Commander in Chief U.S. Fleet directed that an Aircraft Experimental and Developmental Squadron be established about 30 September 1942 at NAS Anacostia. This squadron, which replaced the Fleet Air Tactical Unit, was to conduct experiments with new aircraft and equipment in order to determine their practical application and tactical employment.\n\n\n\nThe V-173, a full-scale model of a Fighter Aircraft with an almost Circular Wing, Made its First Flight\n\nNovember 23, 1942-The V-173, a full-scale model of a fighter aircraft with an almost circular wing, made its first flight at the Vought-Sikorsky plant, Stratford, Conn. A military version of this aircraft, the XF5U-1, was constructed later but never flown.\n\n\n\nBell Aircraft Corporation Developed the First Helicopter to Fly with a Teetering Semi-Rigid Rotor System\n\nDecember 18, 1942- Lawrence “Larry” Bell – (04/05/1894 – 10/20/1956) – Bell Aircraft Corporation developed the first helicopter to fly with a teetering semi-rigid rotor system with stabilizer bar and ushered in an age of economical, easily produced helicopter models.\n\n\n\nADM King Issued a Letter to the Bureau of Aeronautics Directing the Development and Evaluation of Helicopters\n\nFebruary 15, 1943. – ADM King issued a letter to the Bureau of Aeronautics directing the development and evaluation of helicopters deployed aboard merchant ships for antisubmarine patrol duty. It assigned responsibility to the Coast Guard for the testing and evaluation of helicopters. On 4 May a Combined Board for the Evaluation of the Ship-Based Helicopter in Antisubmarine Warfare was formed.\n\n\n\nThe Naval Photographic Science Laboratory was Established at NAS Anacostia\n\nFebruary 24, 1943-The Naval Photographic Science Laboratory was established at NAS Anacostia under the direction of the Bureau of Aeronautics to provide photographic services to the Navy and to develop equipment and techniques suitable for fleet use.\n\n\n\nEvaluation of the Helicopter in Anti-Submarine Operations\n\nMay 4, 1943-To expedite the evaluation of the helicopter in antisubmarine operations, the Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet directed that a “joint board” be formed with representatives of the Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet; the Bureau of Aeronautics; the Coast Guard; the British Admiralty and the Royal Air Forces. The resulting Combined Board for the Evaluation of the Ship-Based Helicopter in Anti-Submarine Warfare was later expanded to include representatives of the Army Air Forces, the War Shipping Administration and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.\n\n\n\nThe Army Conducted the First Sea Trials of the XR-4 aboard the Merchant Tanker Bunker Hill\n\nMay 7, 1943. – The Army conducted the first sea trials of the XR-4 aboard the merchant tanker Bunker Hill, with Captain Frank Gregory at the controls. The Maritime Commission sponsored this demonstration, conducted in the Long Island Sound. Captain Gregory circled and landed aboard the ship about fifteen times.\n\n\n\nLCDR Erickson began Helicopter Flight Training in the XR-4 at the Sikorsky Plant in Connecticut\n\nJune 1943. – LCDR Erickson began helicopter flight training in the XR-4 at the Sikorsky plant in Connecticut. He soloed after three hours of dual flight training with Sikorsky’s chief test pilot Les Morris, thus becoming Coast Guard helicopter pilot number one.\n\n\n\nLCDR Erickson Submitted Proposal on the Helicopter’s Antisubmarine Potential.\n\nJune 10, 1943. – LCDR Erickson submitted another proposal, this time placing all the emphasis on the helicopter’s antisubmarine potential. He recommended that helicopters be equipped with radar and dunking sonar to become “the eyes and ears of the convoy escorts.”\n\n\n\nThe Bureau of Aeronautics Placed an Order for 44 R-5s (Navy designation HO2S-1)\n\nJune 22, 1943. – The Bureau of Aeronautics placed an order for 44 R-5s (Navy designation HO2S-1), a new Sikorsky design twice as big as the R-4. By the time the first HO2S-1, was accepted in December 1945, the war had ended. These helicopters were assigned to NAS New York and USCG Air Station, Elizabeth City, SC.\n\n\n\nThe Navy Accepted its First Helicopter, a Sikorsky YR-4B, Navy designation XHNS-1, BuNo 46445\n\nOctober 16, 1943. – The Navy accepted its first helicopter, a Sikorsky YR-4B, Navy designation XHNS-1, BuNo 46445, at Bridgeport, Connecticut. LCDR Erickson flew the one-hour acceptance flight. CDR Charles T. Booth, USN, went to Bridgeport to qualify as a helicopter pilot and to fly the XHNS-1 to the Naval Air Test Center (NATC), NAS Patuxent River, MD. CDR Booth was the first U.S. Navy Officer to become qualified to fly helicopters.\n\n\n\nBirthday of Navy Helicopter Aviation\n\nOctober 16, 1943. – BIRTHDAY OF NAVY HELICOPTER AVIATION\n\nnavyhelicopteraviationbirthdayinstruction24march2011\n\n\n\nLTJG Steward R. Graham, USCG, Completed Helicopter Flight Training at the Sikorsky Plant\n\nOctober 20, 1943. – LTJG Steward R. Graham, USCG, completed helicopter flight training at the Sikorsky plant, soloing after three and a half hours of dual instruction. LTJG Graham became USCG helicopter pilot number two. LCDR Erickson was his flight instructor. Graham would become the lead test pilot in the development of the helicopter as an ASW platform.\n\n\n\nCDR Charles T. Booth Delivered the First XHNS-1 to NAS Patuxent River\n\nOctober 22, 1943. – CDR Charles T. Booth delivered the first XHNS-1 to NAS Patuxent River. He established and led a helicopter flight test facility at NATC. The Army transferred two additional YR-4Bs to the Navy. In time, a total of 20 YR-4Bs from the Army contract of 100 were transferred to the Navy. According to its records, between October 1943 and December 1944 the U.S. Navy accepted 68 YR-4Bs (HNS-1s). They were powered with the R-550 radial engine, its various versions developing between 180 and 200 hp.\n\n\n\nThe New York Coast Guard Air Station was Designated the First U.S. Naval Helicopter Training Base\n\nNovember 19, 1943. – The New York Coast Guard Air Station was designated the first U.S. naval helicopter training base, newly promoted CDR Erickson commanding. Erickson began to train Coast Guard, Navy, Army Air Corps, and British helicopter pilots.\n\n\n\nLCDR John M. Miller, USNR, Soloed the HNS-1, Becoming U.S. Navy Helicopter Pilot Number Two\n\nDecember 5, 1943. – LCDR John M. Miller, USNR, soloed the HNS-1, becoming U.S. Navy helicopter pilot number two. CDR Erickson was his flight instructor. A few days later the Navy conducted its first HNS-1 shipboard operational test. LCDR Miller landed aboard the British freighter M. V. Daghestan in the Long Island Sound.\n\n\n\nChief of Naval Operations Directed the Separation of the Helicopter Test and Development Functions from the Pilot Training Function.\n\nDecember 18, 1943. – Based on the results of this test, the Chief of Naval Operations directed the separation of the helicopter test and development functions from the pilot training function. He further directed that, effective 1 January 1944, the Coast Guard establish a helicopter pilot training program at Floyd Bennett Field, under the direction of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air). The directive established the criteria that after 25 hours of dual and solo flight time, a fixed wing pilot was qualified as a helicopter pilot. It further stated than, as of the date of the directive, three Coast Guard and two Navy officers had qualified as helicopter pilots. These pilots were: LCDR Frank A. Erickson, LTJG Steward R. Graham, and LT A. N. Fisher from the Coast Guard, and CDR Charles T. Booth and LCDR John M. Miller from the Navy. These early helicopter pilots did not have a formal Navy training program to follow, or an established procedure to record and preserve their helicopter pilot qualifications. In fact, their training consisted on a few hours of dual flight instruction, enough to make them safe-for-solo. From then on they gained their flying proficiency while performing their assigned flying duties. They were never placed in the list of designated helicopter pilots. From its beginning, the Navy considered helicopter rating as a postgraduate qualification, and only Naval Aviators were sent to helicopter training. This policy continued until 1954.\n\n\n\nThe Navy Signed a Contract For Frank Piasecki’s Single XHRP-1 Prototype\n\nJanuary 1, 1944. – The Navy signed a contract with P-V Engineering Forum, Frank Piasecki’s emerging enterprise, for the building of a single XHRP-1 prototype. This was the first twin-rotor helicopter in the tandem configuration built in the U.S. The XHRP-X, a technology demonstrator, first flew on 7 March 1945. The XHRP-1 evaluation was very successful, and the Navy quickly ordered production of twenty HRP-1s, nicknamed the “Flying Banana.”\n\n\n\nCDR Erickson performed the First Recorded Helicopter Mission of Mercy\n\nJanuary 3, 1944. – CDR Erickson performed the first recorded helicopter mission of mercy when he flew an HNS-1 through a winter blizzard to deliver a cargo of blood plasma from Manhattan, NY, to the Hospital at Sandy Hook, NJ, to treat over 100 sailors injured in explosions aboard the destroyer USS Turner. This event helped to reverse the perception of helicopters as impractical machines.\n\n\n\nThe First Atlantic Convoy that Used the New Antisubmarine Helicopter Patrol Capability\n\nJanuary 6, 1944. – The first Atlantic convoy that used the new antisubmarine helicopter patrol capability sailed from New York to Liverpool, UK, with two HNS-1 helicopters and three pilots, U.S. Navy LCDRs James Klopp and John Miller and USCG LTJG StewartGraham embarked. The first sortie at sea was flown from Daghestan by LTJG Graham on 16 January, a 30 minutes flight. With the support of CAPT Kossler and ADM Waesche, CDR Erickson had been able to sell the Navy on the concept of using the helicopter in the convoy antisubmarine patrol role.\n\n\n\nFirst Detection of a Submerged Enemy Submarine by the Use of MAD Gear\n\nFebruary 24, 1944-The first detection of a submerged enemy submarine by the use of MAD gear was made by Catalinas of VP-63, on a MAD barrier patrol of the approaches to the Strait of Gibraltar. They attacked the U-761 with retrorockets, and with the assistance of two ships and aircraft from two other squadrons, sank it.\n\n\n\nLTCOL Desmond E. Canavan, USMC, Flew his First Helicopter Dual Flight\n\nMarch 30, 1944. – LTCOL Desmond E. Canavan, USMC, serving as test pilot at NATC, Patuxent River, flew his first helicopter dual flight in the XHNS-1 BuNo 39034. After twelve dual flights with LCDR John Miller, LTCOL Canavan soloed the XHNS-1 on 3 November 1944, thus becoming the first Marine pilot to obtain a helicopter qualification.\n\n\n\nAir-Sea Rescue Squadrons (VH) were Formed in the Pacific Fleet\n\nApril 15, 1944-Air-Sea Rescue Squadrons (VH) were formed in the Pacific Fleet to provide rescue and emergency services as necessary in the forward areas. Prior to this time the rescue function was performed as an additional duty by regularly operating patrol squadrons\n\n\n\nHelicopter Designation Letters Changed\n\nMay 13, 1944-To distinguish between fixed and rotary wing heavier-than-aircraft, the helicopter class designation VH plus a mission letter (i.e. VHO for observation and VHN for training) was abolished and helicopters were established as a separate type designated H. The previous mission letters thus became classes designated O, N, and R for observation, training and transport respectively.\n\n\n\nDevelopment of a Automatic Pilot Installation in a HNS-1 Helicopter\n\nMay 17, 1944-The Bureau of Aeronautics authorized CGAS Floyd Bennett Field to collaborate with the Sperry Gyroscope Company in making an automatic pilot installation in a HNS-1 helicopter.\n\n\n\nUSCGC Cobb (WPG-181), the First U.S. Helicopter Carrier, Began Underway Operations in the Long Island Sound\n\nJune 1944. – USCGC Cobb (WPG-181), the first U.S. helicopter carrier, began underway operations in the Long Island Sound. USCGC Cobb was a modified old passenger ship. Excessive maintenance costs drove the Coast Guard to decommission her on 31 January 1946.\n\n\n\nParachute Experimental Division was Established at Lakehurst\n\nJune 29, 1944-The Parachute Experimental Division was established at Lakehurst, N.,J., for research, development, and testing of parachutes and survival gear.\n\n\n\nCDR Erickson Began Testing a Bomb-Loading Electric Hoist Installed in an HNS-1\n\nAugust 11, 1944. – CDR Erickson began testing a bomb-loading electric hoist installed in an HNS-1, the first rescue hoist installed in a helicopter. After four days of testing over Jamaica Bay, its feasibility was clearly demonstrated, but the electric motor proved to be too weak and slow. Erickson switched to a hydraulic motor that could lift 400 pounds at two and a half feet per second.

Pless USMC Was Awarded The Medal of Honor\n\nAugust 19, 1967. – Captain Stephen W. Pless, USMC, serving with VMO-6, was flying an UH-1E patrol when he heard a radio emergency call. A damaged helicopter, under Viet Cong (VC) fire, had lifted off the beach south of Chu Lai, leaving four Americans stranded and in imminent danger of being overwhelmed by the VC forces. Captain Pless and his crew, Captain Rupert Fairfield, USMC, copilot; Gunnery Sergeant Leroy Poulson, USMC, gunner; and Lance Corporal John Phelps, USMC, crewchief, decided a rescue attempt. As Captain Pless approached the area, he saw the VC forces swarming the beach and the four Americans being overrun and attacked at close quarters. Pless ordered Poulson to open fire on the VC and maneuvered into position to fire all his fourteen rockets in the middle of the VC mob, now retreating toward the tree line. He spotted one American waving his arm and immediately flared to a landing, placing the helicopter between the wounded man and the VC. With the helicopter now on the ground, the VC force reversed its retreat and began to advance toward it. Poulson immediately jumped off the aircraft and helped the wounded man, Staff Sergeant Lawrence H. Allen, USA, aboard. The other Americans were severely wounded and would have to be carried. Both, Captain Fairfield, the copilot, and Corporal Phelps got off the aircraft to help Poulson. Captain Fairfield spotted three VCs approaching from the rear of the helicopter firing at Poulson and Phelps. He opened fire with his M-60 and killed the VCs. Sergeant Allen, in spite of his wounds, grabbed an M-60 and opened fire on the VCs approaching from the left side of the helicopter. While dragging a wounded American, Fairfield and Phelps fired their pistols to the VC, now within several feet of the aircraft. At this moment, an Army UH-1Es joined the battle and began to strafe the VC. A Vietnam Air Force UH-34 landed next to Pless’ helicopter. With three wounded Americans onboard, and the fourth clearly dead, Pless decided it was time to depart and take the wounded men to a medical facility. With the VC still firing at him with automatic weapons, he had to depart over water. Grossly overloaded, he bounced off the waves four times before gaining enough speed and building his rotor rpm up. For his actions that day, Captain Stephen W. Pless was awarded the Medal of Honor. He was the only Marine helicopter pilot to receive the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, and the first of two naval helicopter pilots to do so. Captain Rupert E. Fairfield, Gunnery Sergeant Leroy N. Poulson, and Lance Corporal John G. Phelps were awarded the Navy Cross. Captain Pless and his crew represent the highest decorated helicopter crew in the Vietnam War. Staff Sergeant Lawrence H. Allen was awarded the Silver Star.\n\nHC-1 Splits into Four Different Squadrons\n\nSeptember 1, 1967. – HC-1 was split into four different squadrons: HC-1, HC-3, HC-5, and HC-7. HC-1 retained the plane guard mission. HC-3 assumed the vertical replenishment mission. HC-5 became the Fleet Replacement Aircrew Training squadron. HC-7 took on the CSAR and minesweeping missions. In fulfilling the CSAR mission off the coast of North Vietnam, Navy helicopter crews wrote many pages of heroic history. The story of a rescue by HC-7 Detachment 104 in a dark summer night in 1968 is a stellar example.\n\nHS-5 Recovers Apollo Astronauts\n\nOctober 22, 1967 – Helicopters of HS-5 from Essex located and recovered astronauts Walter M.

The Sea Cobra featured the 1,290 shp Pratt & Whitney T400 twin-pack engine. The new attack helicopter was armed with guided anti armor missiles, unguided rockets, 20-millimeter cannons or 7.62-millimeter machine guns. HMA-269 was the first to receive the Sea Cobra in April 1971. As an interim measure, the U.S. Army had transfered 38 AH-1Gs to the Marines in 1969. Through the 1970s, various models of the AH-1 were produced, featuring improved armament and more powerful engines. AH-1 development and deployment continues to the present, the most recently acquired model being the AH-1Z Viper, which is expected to continue in service until 2018.\n\nLTJG Clyde E. Lassen Was Awarded the Medal of Honor\n\nJune 19, 1968. – Shortly after midnight on 19 June 1968, LTJG Clyde E. Lassen, with copilot LTJG Leroy Cook, and gunners/rescue aircrewmen ADJ3 Donald West and AE2 Bruce Dallas, launched from USS Preble (DLG-15), on station off the coast of North Vietnam. Two aviators had ejected twenty miles inside enemy territory after their F-4J aircraft was hit by a surface-to-air missile. After locating the survivors in a heavily wooded area, Lassen set his UH-2A down on a rice paddy while urging the two survivors to come out of the thick vegetation. The UH-2A began to take small arms fire. With “Come get us” calls coming through his earphones, Lassen decided to try to get above the survivors and hoist them aboard. Using the illumination from RESCAP parachute flares, Lassen positioned the helicopter above the survivors, between two towering trees. Before the air crewmen could begin the hoisting operation the flares went out and the world went pitch black. The helicopter hit a tree and started to spin right. Lassen regained control and waved off. The UH-2A had lost a door but was still flyable. A new RESCAP arrived with more flares. Lassen determined that the survivors would have to make their way to the clearing if they had any hope of being rescued. As Lassen approached the clearing for a second landing, small arms fire erupted along the perimeter. The survivors were too far away and Lassen aborted the approach. During the third approach the last of the illumination flares went out. Lassen decided to turn the landing light on and expose the aircraft to enemy gunners rather than to abandon the survivors. For two minutes he hovered, with the landing gear just touching the mud, while Dallas and West blasted away at the tree line nearby. Finally the survivors, LCDR John Holtzclaw and LCDR John A. Burns emerged from the dark and were yanked inside the helicopter. With the aircraft vibrating abnormally, a malfunctioning compass, and a low fuel state, Lassen headed for the coast while dodging antiaircraft fire. He landed the crippled helicopter aboard the closest ship available, USS Jouett (DLG-29), with 135 pounds of fuel, five minutes of flight time, left in the tanks. For his heroic actions LTJG Clyde E. Lassen was awarded the Medal of Honor. He was the second helicopter pilot to receive the MoH in U.S. Navy history, and the only one during the Vietnam War.\n\nMarine Observation Squadron 2 (VMO-2) Stationed at Da Nang, South Vietnam, Received the First OV-1OA, Broncos\n\nJuly 6, 1968–Marine Observation Squadron 2 (VMO-2) stationed at Da Nang, South Vietnam, received the first OV-1OA, Broncos, to arrive in South Vietnam.

The country had no sooner ended its long military involvement in Vietnam than it faced a growing crisis in the Middle East, a crisis that reached hostile proportions late in 1979 when Iranian hoodlums captured the United States embassy in their capital city.\n\nThroughout the seventies, the American public became increasingly aware of the country’s critical dependence upon oil from foreign sources. During this time, an acute consciousness of the United States’ position as a two-ocean nation re-emphasized the reliance upon the U.S. Navy to keep sea lanes open and commerce moving unhampered.\n\nFor nearly ten years, the burden of the Navy’s air action fell upon the carriers and aircraft of the Seventh Fleet. To meet this responsibility, Naval air relied on established weapons and material and introduced new ones. The Walleye, a television-guided glide bomb designed to home automatically on target, was tested successfully in combat. Helicopters flexed their muscle in a combat role and served also as aerial tanks and flying freight trains. Land-based patrol aircraft, in Operation Market Time, scoured the coastline of South Vietnam to search out enemy infiltrating vessels and locate surface forces for interception. In 1972, Operations Linebacker I and II waged heavy interdiction and bombing campaigns against North Vietnam. Aircraft of the Seventh Fleet performed the most extensive aerial mining operation in history, blockading the enemy’s main avenues of supply. An uneasy truce finally resulted in the United States disengaging itself from Vietnam in 1973. Two years later, Naval aviation was called upon to assist in the evacuation of refugees fleeing the North Vietnamese takeover of South Vietnam. In 1979, Naval air power helped rescue thousands of Indochinese who took to the high seas in poor vessels to escape mounting tyranny in their homelands.\n\nAgainst the unrelenting need for vigilance was pitted a declining material inventory and difficulty in retaining experienced personnel. Much of the 1970’s can hardly be called bountiful for Naval aviation. As the surplus of equipment left over from Vietnam eroded through constant use, money for replenishment was not abundant. The high inflation rate that beset the world’s industrial nations plagued defense budgets and drove downward the purchasing power of military salaries. Nevertheless, Naval aviation continued to make headway in the areas of research and development.\n\nEarly in the 1970’s, the Navy introduced the F-14 Tomcat, and the Marine Corps accepted the AV-8 V/STOL Harrier. At the end of the decade, a new fighter/attack aircraft, the F/A-18 Hornet, was undergoing flight trials. The submarine threat was confronted by the addition to the fleet of the light airborne multipurpose system (LAMPS) which combined shipboard electronics with the SH-2D helicopter. As 1980 drew to a close, the latest LAMPS version was under test in a new Navy airframe, the SH-60B Seahawk. Also at decade’s end, the Navy’s latest heavy-lift helicopter, the CH-53E, was ready for acceptance by a Marine Corps squadron. Airframes were not the only items which saw advance. The fields of electronics, missiles, and crew systems also benefitted from improvements. Finally it should be mentioned that during the seventies two nuclear supercarriers, Nimitz and Eisenhower were commissioned; a third, Carl Vinson was launched.\n\nAs Naval aviation began its eighth decade, there was no serious reason to doubt that its good record of achievement would endure. Aircraft, integrated with the fleet, would continue to provide the United States with the strongest naval power on earth.\n\nVC-8 Seaking Rescues 26 People from Airliner Crash in Caribbean\n\nMay 2, 1970–Twenty-six persons were rescued by a VC-8 helicopter from a Dutch Antillean Airlines DC-9 ditched in the Caribbean. The helicopter was piloted by Lieutenant Commander James E. Rylee and Lieutenant (jg) Donald Hartman; crewmen were ADC William Brazzell and AD Calvin Lindley.\n\nU.S. Navy Riverine Air and Water Resources Combined Attack\n\nMay 9, 1970–Approximately 30 U.S. Navy craft, helicopters and OV-10 Bronco aircraft participated with the combined South Vietnamese/U.S. Riverine Force in operations into the “Mekong River Corridor” to neutralize sanctuary bases in that area. This followed the initial series of strikes by combined U.S.-RVN ground forces against enemy sanctuaries in Cambodia during the first week of May.\n\nMarine Corps CH-53D Establishes New Speed Record\n\nJune 9, 1970–Sikorsky pilot James R.
