NOAA-L is part of the Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) program that provides atmospheric measurements of temperature, humidity, ozone and cloud images, tracking weather patterns that affect the global weather and climate. The launch of the NOAA-L satellite is scheduled no earlier than Sept. 12 aboard a Lockheed Martin Titan II rocket. Boron epoxy rocket motor case program\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nStang, D. A.\n\n1971-01-01\n\nThree 28-inch-diameter solid rocket motor cases were fabricated using 1/8 inch wide boron/epoxy tape. The cases had unequal end closures (4-1/8-inch-diameter forward flanges and 13-inch-diameter aft flanges) and metal attachment skirts. The flanges and skirts were titanium 6Al-4V alloy. The original design for the first case was patterned after the requirements of the Applications Technology Satellite apogee kick motor. The second and third cases were designed and fabricated to approximate the requirements of a small Applications Technology Satellite apogee kick motor. The program demonstrated the feasibility of designing and fabricating large-scale filament-wound solid propellant rocket motor cases with boron/epoxy tape.\n\nDesign assurance test of the Thiokol Te-M-521-5 apogee kick motor tested in the spin mode at simulated altitude conditions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCimino, A. A.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nOne Thiokol Chemical Corporation TE-M-521-5 solid-propellant apogee rocket motor was successfully fired at an average simulated altitude of about 108,000 ft while spinning at 46 rpm. The general program objectives were to verify compliance of motor performance with the manufacturer's specifications. Specific primary objectives were to determine vacuum ballistic performance of the motor after prefire vibration conditioning and temperature conditioning at 40F, altitude ignition characteristics, motor structural integrity, and motor temperature-time history during and after motor operation. Additional objectives were to measure the lateral (nonaxial) thrust component during motor operation and to measure radiation heat flux in the vicinity of the nozzle exit plane.\n\nAyame/PAM-D apogee kick motor nozzle failure analysis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe failure of two communication satellites during firing sequence were examined. The correlation/comparison of the circumstances of the Ayame incidents and the failure of the STAR 48 (DM-2) motor are reviewed. The massive nozzle failure of the AKM to determine the impact on spacecraft performance is examined. It is recommended that a closer watch is kept on systems techniques,\n\nEstimation of outgassing from an expended apogee motor and its effects on spacecraft surfaces\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nScialdone, J. J.; Rogers, J. F.; Kruger, R.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nAn experimental and theoretical investigation was carried out to evaluate the degradation of the solar cells and other sensitive surfaces of a spacecraft, resulting from the molecular outgassing of an expended solid propellant apogee motor. The motor, following its burnout, is retained by the spacecraft and is a source of gases and particulates which will be released mainly by the unburned propellant-to-casing insulation. The deployment of the solar array within a few minutes after the motor burn results in the interception and reflection to the surfaces of the spacecraft of the molecular outgassing and particulates. Various methods, based on some experimental data, were used to analytically assess the magnitude of the outgassing from the engine.\n\nThe Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and its successor, APOGEE-2\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMajewski, S. R.; APOGEE Team; APOGEE-2 Team\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) of Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) has produced a large catalog of high resolution ({R = 22 500}), high quality (S/N > 100), infrared (H-band) spectra for stars throughout all stellar populations of the Milky Way, including in regions veiled by significant dust opacity. APOGEE's half million spectra collected on > 163 000 unique stars, with time series information via repeat visits to each star, are being applied to numerous problems in stellar populations, Galactic astronomy, and stellar astrophysics. From among the early results of the APOGEE project - which span from measurements of Galactic dynamics, to multi-element chemical maps of the disk and bulge, new views of the interstellar medium, explorations of stellar companions, the chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species - I highlight a few results that demonstrate APOGEE's unique ability to sample and characterize the Galactic disk and bulge. Plans are now under way for an even more ambitious successor to APOGEE: the six-year, dual-hemisphere APOGEE-2 project. Both phases of APOGEE feature a strong focus on targets having asteroseismological measurements from either Kepler or {CoRoT}, from which it is possible to derive relatively precise stellar ages. The combined APOGEE and APOGEE-2 databases of stellar chemistry, dynamics and ages constitute an unusually comprehensive, systematic and homogeneous resource for constraining models of Galactic evolution.\n\nUtility of Space Transportation System to Space Communication Community\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBronstein, L. M.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nA potentially cost effective technique was investigated of launching operational satellites into synchronous orbit using the space transportation system (STS). This technique uses an unguided spinning solid rocket motor as the means for boosting a satellite from a low altitude shuttle parking orbit into a synchronous transfer orbit. The spacecraft is then injected into a geosynchronous orbit by an apogee kick motor fired at transfer orbit apogee. The approach is essentially that used on all Delta and Atlas-Centaur launches of synchronous satellites with the shuttle orbiter performing the function of the first two stages of the Delta three stage launch vehicle and the perigee kick motor performing the function of the Delta third state. It is concluded that the STS can be useful to the space communication community as well as to other geostationary satellite system users if the recommended actions are implemented.\n\nCommercial US transfer vehicle overview\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWinchell, J. W.; Huss, R. L.\n\n1986-10-01\n\nA survey is presented of the design and operational status and intended or existing missions for apogee kick motors for launch from the Orbiter bay. Attention is also given to the associated hardware for interfacing and propelling the payloads from the bay. The PAM-D, -DII, and -A upper stage motors are described, with their payload boost capabilities of 1500-4300 lb to GEO. Features of the solid-fueled Transfer Orbit Stage, based on the IUS, and the liquid bipropellant-fueled Apogee and Maneuvering Stage, which can lift from 3000-5600 lb to GEO, respectively, are also delineated. The discussion also covers the liquid-fueled Leasat apogee motor, the solid-fueled GEO injection motor of the Shuttle Compatible Orbit Transfer Subsystem (4100-5900 lb), and the IUS (5000 lb) and Centaur (10,000 lb) systems. Government-industry cooperation to encourage the continued development of the industrial base to continue and expand production and use of upper stage vehicles is noted.\n\nEffects on motor development of kicking and stepping exercise in preterm infants with periventricular brain injury: a pilot study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCampbell, Suzann K; Gaebler-Spira, Deborah; Zawacki, Laura; Clark, April; Boynewicz, Kara; deRegnier, Raye-Ann; Kuroda, Maxine M; Bhat, Rama; Yu, Jinsheng; Campise-Luther, Rose; Kale, Dipti; Bulanda, Michelle; Zhou, Xiaohong Joe\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPreterm infants with periventricular brain injury (PBI) have a high incidence of atypical development and leg movements. Determine whether kicking and treadmill stepping intervention beginning at 2 months corrected age (CA) in children with PBI improves motor function at 12 months CA when compared with control subjects. In a multi-center pilot study for a controlled clinical trial, sixteen infants with PBI were randomly assigned to home exercise consisting of kicking and treadmill stepping or a no-training control condition. Development was assessed at 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12 months CA with the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS). At 12 months children were classified as normal, delayed, or with cerebral palsy (CP). At 12 months CA 3 of 7 (43%) of the exercise group children walked alone or with one hand held versus 1 of 9 (11%) in the control group (p=0.262), but no significant differences in AIMS scores were found at any age. Half of the subjects had CP or delay; the outcomes of these infants were not improved by exercise. Compliance with the home program was lower than requested and may have affected results. Although not statistically significant with a small sample size, self-produced kicking and treadmill exercise may lower age at walking in infants with normal development following PBI, but improvements of the protocol to increase and document compliance are needed before a larger study is implemented.\n\nEffects on Motor Development of Kicking and Stepping Exercise in Preterm Infants with Periventricular Brain Injury: A Pilot Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCampbell, Suzann K.; Gaebler-Spira, Deborah; Zawacki, Laura; Clark, April; Boynewicz, Kara; deRegnier, Raye-Ann; Kuroda, Maxine M.; Bhat, Rama; Yu, Jinsheng; Campise-Luther, Rose; Kale, Dipti; Bulanda, Michelle; Zhou, Xiaohong Joe\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Preterm infants with periventricular brain injury (PBI) have a high incidence of atypical development and leg movements.

A new inter-joint coordination index that encompasses three- dimensional hip and knee motions, was defined and applied to the joint kinematic results. Twelve elite Taekwondo athletes participated in this study and performed the back kick, thrashing kick, turning-back kick and roundhouse kick. Our results indicate that the back kick utilized a combination of hip and knee extension to produce the kicking velocity, and was characterized by a pushlike movement. The thrashing kick and turning-back kick utilized a greater degree of hip abduction than the roundhouse kick and back kick, and included complicated knee motions. The new index successfully categorized the thrashing kick and turning-back kick into a push-throw continuum, indicating a change from negative index (opposite direction) to positive index (same direction) of hip and knee motions at the end of the movement. This strategy of push-throw continuum increases the kicking velocity at the moment of impact by applying a throwlike movement pattern. Key pointsA variety of Taekwondo kicks have unique inter-joint coordination of the kicking leg.The back kick used a combination of hip and knee extension to produce the kicking velocity, and was characterized by a pushlike movement.The new index explained well the inter-joint coordination of three DOF joint motions of two joints in producing kicking velocity (positive values for throwlike movements and negative values for pushlike movements).The index successfully categorized the thrashing kick and turning-back kick into a push-throw continuum.\n\nInter-Joint Coordination in Producing Kicking Velocity of Taekwondo Kicks\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Young Kwan; Kim, Yoon Hyuk; Im, Shin Ja\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate joint kinematics of the kicking leg in Taekwondo and to examine the role of inter-joint coordination of the leg in producing the kicking velocity.

J.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nThe analysis followed five selected motors through initial design, development, test, qualification, manufacture, and final flight reports. An audit was conducted at the manufacturing plants to complement the literature search with firsthand observations of the current philosophies and practices that affect reliability of the motors. A second literature search emphasized acquisition of spacecraft and satellite data bearing on solid motor reliability. It was concluded that present practices at the plants yield highly reliable flight hardware. Reliability can be further improved by new developments of aft-end bonding and initiator/igniter nondestructive test methods, a safe/arm device, and an insulation formulation. Minimum diagnostic instrumentation is recommended for all motor flights. Surplus motors should be used in margin testing. Criteria should be established for pressure and zone curing. The motor contractor should be represented at launch. New design analyses should be made of stretched motors and spacecraft/motor pairs.\n\nACCRETION DISKS AROUND KICKED BLACK HOLES: POST-KICK DYNAMICS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPonce, Marcelo; Faber, Joshua A.; Lombardi, James C., E-mail: mponce@astro.rit.edu, E-mail: jafsma@rit.edu, E-mail: jalombar@allegheny.edu\n\n2012-01-20\n\nNumerical calculations of merging black hole binaries indicate that asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation can kick the merged black hole at up to thousands of km s{sup -1}, and a number of systems have been observed recently whose properties are consistent with an active galactic nucleus containing a supermassive black hole moving with substantial velocity with respect to its broader accretion disk. We study here the effect of an impulsive kick delivered to a black hole on the dynamical evolution of its accretion disk using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, focusing attention on the role played by the kick anglemoreÂ Â» with respect to the orbital angular momentum vector of the pre-kicked disk. We find that for more vertical kicks, for which the angle between the kick and the normal vector to the disk {theta} {approx}< 30 Degree-Sign , a gap remains present in the inner disk, in accordance with the prediction from an analytic collisionless Keplerian disk model, while for more oblique kicks with {theta} {approx}> 45 Degree-Sign , matter rapidly accretes toward the black hole. There is a systematic trend for higher potential luminosities for more oblique kick angles for a given black hole mass, disk mass, and kick velocity, and we find large amplitude oscillations in time in the case of a kick oriented 60 Degree-Sign from the vertical.Â«Â less\n\nTarget Selection for the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 Survey\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZasowski, G.; Cohen, R.

It is the successor to APOGEE and is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). APOGEE-2 is expanding on APOGEEâs goals of addressing critical questions of stellar astrophysics, stellar populations, and Galactic chemodynamical evolution using (1) an enhanced set of target types and (2) a second spectrograph at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.

These lines were detected in a metal-poor ([Fe/H]Â â¼Â â1.5), neutron-capture element-enhanced star recently discovered in the APOGEE sample. Using an optical high-resolution spectrum, we derive a Nd abundance for this star using NdÂ ii lines with precise, laboratory-derived gf values. This optical abundance is used to derive log( gf ) values for the H -band lines. We use these lines to rederive NdÂ ii abundances for two more metal-rich, s -process enhancedmoreÂ Â» stars observed by APOGEE and find that these lines yield consistent NdÂ ii abundances, confirming the Nd enhancement of these stars. We explore the region of parameter space in the APOGEE sample over which these lines can be used to measure NdÂ ii abundances. We find that Nd abundances can be reliably derived for â¼18% of the red giants observed by APOGEE. This will result in â¼50,000 Milky Way stars with NdÂ ii abundances following the conclusion of APOGEE-2, allowing for studies of neutron-capture element abundance distributions across the entire Milky Way.Â«Â less\n\nTarget effect on the kinematics of Taekwondo Roundhouse Kick - is the presence of a physical target a stimulus, influencing muscle-power generation?\n\nPubMed\n\nWÄ sik, Jacek; Shan, Gongbing\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTaekwondo is famous for its powerful kicking techniques and the roundhouse kick is the most frequently used one. In earlier literature, the influence of a physical target (exiting or not) on kicking power generation has not been given much attention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the kinematics of roundhouse kick execution and its factors related to power generation. 6 ITF taekwondo practitioners voluntarily participated in this study. They were asked to perform kicks with and without a physical target. The first kick aimed at breaking a board while the second one was a kick into the air. A Smart-D motion capture system (BTS S.p.A., Italy) was used to quantitatively determine their kinematic characteristics during each kick. The main findings showed that kicks aiming at a breaking board were significantly slower than kicks without a physical target (maximal kick-foot velocities were 10.61 Â± 0.86 m/s and 14.61 Â± 0.67 m/s, respectively, p < 0.01), but the kicking time of the former was shorter (0.58 Â± 0.01 s and 0.67 Â± 0.01, respectively, p < 0.01). The results suggest that a physical target will negatively influence the kick-foot velocity, which is not necessarily a disadvantage for creating a high quality kick. Possible motor control mechanisms are discussed for the phenomenon. The study made it clear: trainings with and without physical targets would develop different motor control patterns. More studies are needed for identifying the effectiveness of different controls and efficiencies of their training.\n\nAPOGEE cryostat design\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBlank, Basil; Henderson, Chuck; Wilson, John C.; Hearty, Fred R.; Skrutskie, Michael F.; O'Brien, Thomas P.; Majewski, Steven R.; Schiavon, Ricardo; Maseman, Paul; Brunner, Sophia; Burton, Adam; Walker, Eric\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThe Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is a survey of all Galactic stellar populations that will employ an R=30,000 spectrograph operating in the near-infrared (1.5-1.7Î¼m) wavelength range. The fiber-fed spectrograph is housed in a large (1.4m x 2.3m x 1.3m) stainless steel cryostat or Dewar that is LN2-cooled and will be located in a building near the 2.5m Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) telescope to which it will be coupled. The choice of shell material and configuration was an optimization among optics packaging, weight, strength, external dimensions, rigging and transportation, the available integration and testing room, and the ultimate instrument room at APO. Internals are fabricated of more traditional 6061-T6 aluminum which is well proven in cryogenic applications. An active thermal shield with MLI blanketing yields an extremely low thermal load of 45-50 watts for this ~3000 liter instrument. Cryostat design details are discussed with applicable constraints and trade decisions. APOGEE is one of four experiments that are part of Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III).\n\nASPCAP: THE APOGEE STELLAR PARAMETER AND CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES PIPELINE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGarcÃ­a PÃ©rez, Ana E.; Majewski, Steven R.; Shane, Neville\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThe Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) has built the largest moderately high-resolution ( R Â âÂ 22,500) spectroscopic map of the stars across the Milky Way, and including dust-obscured areas. The APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP) is the software developed for the automated analysis of these spectra. ASPCAP determines atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances from observed spectra by comparing observed spectra to libraries of theoretical spectra, using Ï {sup 2} minimization in a multidimensional parameter space. The package consists of a fortran90 code that does the actual minimization and a wrapper IDL code for book-keeping and datamoreÂ Â» handling. This paper explains in detail the ASPCAP components and functionality, and presents results from a number of tests designed to check its performance. ASPCAP provides stellar effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities precise to 2%, 0.1 dex, and 0.05 dex, respectively, for most APOGEE stars, which are predominantly giants. It also provides abundances for up to 15 chemical elements with various levels of precision, typically under 0.1 dex. The final data release (DR12) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III contains an APOGEE database of more than 150,000 stars. ASPCAP development continues in the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey.Â«Â less\n\nTHE SDSS-III APOGEE SPECTRAL LINE LIST FOR H-BAND SPECTROSCOPY\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nShetrone, M.; Bizyaev, D.; Chojnowski, D.\n\nWe present the H-band spectral line lists adopted by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). The APOGEE line lists comprise astrophysical, theoretical, and laboratory sources from the literature, as well as newly evaluated astrophysical oscillator strengths and damping parameters. We discuss the construction of the APOGEE line list, which is one of the critical inputs for the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundances Pipeline, and present three different versions that have been used at various stages of the project. The methodology for the newly calculated astrophysical line lists is reviewed. The largest of these three line lists containsmoreÂ Â» 134,457 molecular and atomic transitions. In addition to the format adopted to store the data, the line lists are available in MOOG, Synspec, and Turbospectrum formats. The limitations of the line lists along with guidance for its use on different spectral types are discussed. We also present a list of H-band spectral features that are either poorly represented or completely missing in our line list. This list is based on the average of a large number of spectral fit residuals for APOGEE observations spanning a wide range of stellar parameters.Â«Â less\n\nINSAT-1A launch on Delta\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe INSAT-1A, the first in a series of 12 transponder communications satellites developed for India, is described as well as the launch plans.

From these, stellar parameters are derived together with abundances for various elements using the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundance Pipeline (ASPCAP). In this poster we report preliminary results from application of an alternative stellar parameters and abundances pipeline, based on measurements of equivalent widths of absorption lines in APOGEE spectra. The method is based on a sequential grid inversion algorithm, originally designed for the derivation of ages and elemental abundances of stellar populations from line indices in their integrated spectra. It allows for the rapid processing of large spectroscopic data sets from both current and future surveys, such as APOGEE and APOGEE 2, and it is easily adaptable for application to other very large data sets that are being/will be generated by other massive surveys of the stellar populations of the Galaxy. It will also allow the cross checking of ASPCAP results using an independent method. In this poster we present preliminary results showing estimates of effective temperature and iron abundance [Fe/H] for a subset of the APOGEE sample, comparing with DR12 numbers produced by the ASPCAP pipeline.\n\nAPOGEE fiber development and FRD testing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrunner, Sophia; Burton, Adam; Crane, Jeff; Zhao, Bo; Hearty, Fred R.; Wilson, John C.; Carey, Larry; Leger, French; Skrutskie, Mike; Schiavon, Ricardo; Majewski, Steven R.\n\n2010-07-01\n\nDevelopment of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) near-infrared spectrograph has motivated thorough investigation into the properties and performance of optical fibers. The fiber selected for APOGEE is a step index, multi-mode fiber, developed by PolyMicro, with a 120Î¼m low OH, fused silica core, 25Î¼m cladding, and 10Î¼m buffer. The instrument design includes a 40 meter fiber run, connecting the spectrograph to the 2.5m Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) telescope, and an additional 2.5 meter fiber segment located within the instrument dewar, a vacuum-sealed, cryogenic environment. This light path is convoluted and includes many transitions and connections where the beam is susceptible irrevocable loss. To optimize the spectrograph performance it is necessary to minimize the losses incurred in the fiber system, especially those resulting in focal ratio degradation (FRD). The focus of this research has been to identify potential sources of loss and where applicable, select material components to minimize this effect. There is little previous documented work concerning the performance of optical fibers within this wavelength band (1.5-1.7Î¼m). Consequently, the following includes comprehensive explanations of the APOGEE fiber system components, our experimental design and optical test bed set-up, beam alignment procedures, fiber terminating and polishing techniques, and results from our examination of FRD as correlated with source wavelength, fiber length and termination, and environmental conditions.\n\nThe Association between Motor Skill Competence and Physical Fitness in Young Adults\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nStodden, David; Langendorfer, Stephen; Roberton, Mary Ann\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe examined the relationship between competence in three fundamental motor skills (throwing, kicking, and jumping) and six measures of health-related physical fitness in young adults (ages 18-25).

R.; Frinchaboy, Peter M.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 12 (DR12) is a unique resource to search for stars beyond the tidal radii of star clusters. We have examined the APOGEE DR12 data base for new candidates of the young star cluster Palomar 1 (Pal 1), a system with previously reported tidal tails (Niederste-Ostholt et al. 2010). The APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundances Pipeline data base includes spectra and stellar parameters for two known members of Pal 1 (Stars I and II), however these do not agree with the stellar parameters determined from optical spectra by Sakari et al. (2011). We find that the APOGEE analysis of these two stars is strongly affected by the known persistence problem (Majewski et al. 2015; Nidever et al. 2015). By re-examining the individual visits, and removing the blue (and sometimes green) APOGEE detector spectra affected by persistence, then we find excellent agreement in a re-analysis of the combined spectra. These methods are applied to another five stars in the APOGEE field with similar radial velocities and metallicities as those of Pal 1. Only one of these new candidates, Star F, may be a member located in the tidal tail based on its heliocentric radial velocity, metallicity and chemistry. The other four candidates are not well aligned with the tidal tails, and comparison to the BesanÃ§on model (Robin et al. 2003) suggests that they are more likely to be non-members, I.e. part of the Galactic halo. This APOGEE field could be re-examined for other new candidates if the persistence problem can be removed from the APOGEE spectral data base.\n\nThe Role of Postural Support in Young Adults' Control of Stationary Kicking\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSidaway, Ben; Bouchard, Matthew; Chasse, Julie; Dunn, Jonathan; Govoni, Andrea; McPherson, Breanne; Roy, Katherine; Anderson, David I.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose: The requirement for postural stability during the performance of motor skills has been clearly demonstrated in infants, but the necessity for such a postural substrate is not well documented in adults.

These maneuvers included an initial formation resize set to spread the spacecraft apart for safety, 32 apogee-raise delta-v maneuvers, their associated slews, four perigee-raise maneuvers and the associated slews, and finally a set of maneuvers to get back into formation. These activities were all accomplished successfully and on schedule with no anomalies, and at a fuel consumption somewhat less than predicted. As a result, MMS was set up ready to carry out in situ studies of magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail, with sufficient fuel remaining for a significant extended mission.\n\nVizieR Online Data Catalog: SDSS-III/APOGEE.

The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) instrument is a 300 fiber, R~22500 spectrograph attached to the SDSS 2.5m telescope at Apache Point Observatory. APOGEE records a vacuum wavelength range of 15145-16955Ã via an arrangement of three Teledyne H2RG 2048*2048 detectors. The detector layout consists of \"blue,\" \"green,\" and \"red\" detectors which cover 15145-15808Ã , 15858-16433Ã , and 16474-16955Ã respectively, resulting in coverage gaps between 15808-15858Ã and 16433-16474Ã . The APOGEE survey uses the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; cat. II/246) as a source catalog. Both proprietary and publicly available spectra are used and displayed in this paper. The publicly available spectra were included in SDSS data release 10 (DR10: pertains to APOGEE data taken prior to MJD=56112), and the full data set will be made publicly available in SDSS data release 12 (DR12: scheduled for 2014 December). Shortly after DR12, we intend to convert the ABE star spectra to the format accepted by the Be Star Spectra Database (BeSS; Neiner et al., 2011AJ....142..149N) and deposit them there, ensuring convenient public access.

The outcome of these kicks is typically attributed to factors such as psychology (e.g. coping with stress), skill (e.g. kicking technique), physiology (e.g. overcoming the fatigue of 120 min play), and chance (e.g. in what direction the goalkeeper moves). The purpose of this study was to use internet game record data to estimate the relative importance of these performance components for the outcome of penalty kicks in international matches. Data were collected from soccer statistics internet sites on all 41 penalty shootouts and 409 kicks taken in the World Cup, European Championships, and Copa America between 1976 and 2004. The results showed that the importance of the kicks (indicative of stress) was negatively related to the outcomes of the kicks, whereas skill and fatigue were less, or not, related to outcome. It was concluded that psychological components are most influential for the outcome of penalty kicks. We recommend that practitioners work with players to reduce the perceived importance of each kick.\n\nThe association between motor skill competence and physical fitness in young adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nStodden, David; Langendorfer, Stephen; Roberton, Mary Ann\n\n2009-06-01\n\nWe examined the relationship between competence in three fundamental motor skills (throwing kicking, and jumping) and six measures of health-related physical fitness in young adults (ages 18-25). We assessed motor skill competence using product scores of maximum kicking and throwing speed and maximum jumping distance. A factor analysis indicated the 12-min run/walk, percent body fat, curl-ups, grip strength, and maximum leg press strength all loaded on one factor defining the construct of \"overall fitness. \"Multiple regression analyses indicated that the product scores for jumping (74%), kicking (58%), and throwing (59%) predicted 79% of the variance in overall fitness. Gender was not a significant predictor of fitness. Results suggest that developing motor skill competence may be fundamental in developing and maintaining adequate physical fitness into adulthood. These data represent the strongest to date on the relationship between motor skill competence and physical fitness.\n\nKSC00vafbdig006\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2000-06-30\n\nInside the B16-10 spacecraft processing hangar at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., workers oversee the mating of the Apogee Kick Motor (below) to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-L) satellite above.

One of the problems encountered during the development of the engine was the occurrence of pops (popping) at the higher operating chamber pressures. Pops are irregular high amplitude pressure pulses. It is generally agreed that pops is a liquid spray/gas two-phase explosion triggered by a local explosion near the jet impingement region. The effects of operating parameters on pops observed in the development tests of the apogee engine for the ETS-6 were inconsistent with those reported earlier for single impingement injectors; pops with the apogee engine injectors was more likely to occur at higher chamber pressures, higher injection velocities, and higher propellant temperatures. Pops data were correlated fairly well in chamber pressures (bar-P(sub c)) vs. fuel Reynolds number (R(sub ef)) plane. However, the range of operating parameters for the above correlation were very narrow since they were obtained during injector screening tests for a particular application to the apogee engine. It was also felt that the above correlation was too simplistic to capture any effect of design parameters of multi-element injectors. In the present study, the demarcation between pops and the pops-free region was determined in broader operating ranges and design parameters. The range of bar-P(sub c) and R(sub ef) was extended by exchanging graphite nozzle throat inserts with different throat diameters. The injectors were carefully selected to obtain effects, if any, of (1) film cooling fraction, (2) secondary mixing, and (3) number of elements and/or fuel orifice diameters. It was found that there was a threshold fuel Reynolds number below which no pops were observed at any chamber pressures and that the pops region curve in the bar-P(sub c)-R(sub ef) plane had two branches: upper branches and lower branches.\n\nKick-Sledding: An Outdoor Activity for Everyone.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWilson, Susan\n\n1994-01-01\n\nKick-sledding is an outdoor activity that originated in Scandinavia.

This preliminary study presents an adjustable mechanical kicking simulator used to investigate different foot positions and orientations during the foot-ball interaction on resultant ball motion. It was found that changes in foot position and orientation during ball contact can have a large influence on ball motion. It is believed that with further research an optimal place-kicking technique can be found to maximize energy transfer to the ball while still maintaining accuracy.\n\nTensegrity and motor-driven effective interactions in a model cytoskeleton\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Shenshen; Wolynes, Peter G.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nActomyosin networks are major structural components of the cell. They provide mechanical integrity and allow dynamic remodeling of eukaryotic cells, self-organizing into the diverse patterns essential for development. We provide a theoretical framework to investigate the intricate interplay between local force generation, network connectivity, and collective action of molecular motors. This framework is capable of accommodating both regular and heterogeneous pattern formation, arrested coarsening and macroscopic contraction in a unified manner. We model the actomyosin system as a motorized cat's cradle consisting of a crosslinked network of nonlinear elastic filaments subjected to spatially anti-correlated motor kicks acting on motorized (fibril) crosslinks. The phase diagram suggests there can be arrested phase separation which provides a natural explanation for the aggregation and coalescence of actomyosin condensates. Simulation studies confirm the theoretical picture that a nonequilibrium many-body system driven by correlated motor kicks can behave as if it were at an effective equilibrium, but with modified interactions that account for the correlation of the motor driven motions of the actively bonded nodes. Regular aster patterns are observed both in Brownian dynamics simulations at effective equilibrium and in the complete stochastic simulations. The results show that large-scale contraction requires correlated kicking.\n\nThe Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMajewski, Steven R.; Schiavon, Ricardo P.; Frinchaboy, Peter M.; Allende Prieto, Carlos; Barkhouser, Robert; Bizyaev, Dmitry; Blank, Basil; Brunner, Sophia; Burton, Adam; Carrera, Ricardo; Chojnowski, S.

This study investigated the effect of a specific fatigue protocol on reaction time, response time, performance time, and kick impact. Seven male athletes reported to the laboratory on two different days. During day one, athletes performed a specific progressive taekwondo test, and on day two, a protocol for determining reaction time, response time, performance time, and kick impact before and after a time to exhaustion test at an intensity level corresponding to the maximal kick frequency obtained during the specific progressive taekwondo test. Muscle activation from rectus femoris and kick impact of the preferred limb were assessed. No differences were observed for response time and performance time. However, kick impact decreased (43Â Â±Â 27 to 13Â Â±Â 10Â g, pÂ <Â 0.01) while reaction time increased (145Â Â±Â 51 to 223Â Â±Â 133Â ms, pÂ <Â 0.05). Moderate correlation was observed between kick impact and response time (rÂ =Â 0.565; pÂ <Â 0.01), and kick impact and performance time (rÂ =Â 0.494; pÂ <Â 0.05). Results indicate that coaches and athletes may use taekwondo training programmes on coordination-based exercises leading to improve response time and to reduce fatigue effects in order to improve technique effectiveness and enhance the possibilities of scoring in a competitive situation.\n\nBiomechanical Characteristics and Determinants of Instep Soccer Kick\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKellis, Eleftherios; Katis, Athanasios\n\n2007-01-01\n\nGood kicking technique is an important aspect of a soccer player. Therefore, understanding the biomechanics of soccer kicking is particularly important for guiding and monitoring the training process. The purpose of this review was to examine latest research findings on biomechanics of soccer kick performance and identify weaknesses of present research which deserve further attention in the future. Being a multiarticular movement, soccer kick is characterised by a proximal-to-distal motion of the lower limb segments of the kicking leg. Angular velocity is maximized first by the thigh, then by the shank and finally by the foot. This is accomplished by segmental and joint movements in multiple planes. During backswing, the thigh decelerates mainly due to a motion-dependent moment from the shank and, to a lesser extent, by activation of hip muscles. In turn, forward acceleration of the shank is accomplished through knee extensor moment as well as a motion-dependent moment from the thigh. The final speed, path and spin of the ball largely depend on the quality of foot-ball contact. Powerful kicks are achieved through a high foot velocity and coefficient of restitution. Preliminary data indicate that accurate kicks are achieved through slower kicking motion and ball speed values. Key pointsSoccer kick is achieved through segmental and joint rotations in multiple planes and via the proximal-to-distal sequence of segmental angular velocities until ball impact. The quality of ball - foot impact and the mechanical behavior of the foot are also important determinants of the final speed, path and spin of the ball.Ball speed values during the maximum instep kick range from 18 to 35 msec-1 depending on various factors, such as skill level, age, approach angle and limb dominance.The main bulk of biomechanics research examined the biomechanics of powerful kicks, mostly under laboratory conditions. A powerful kick is characterized by the achievement of maximal ball speed.

Recent efforts to eliminate HIV have tested the ability of a number of agents to reactivate ('Kick') the well-known latent reservoir. This approach is rooted in the assumption that once these cells are reactivated the host's immune system itself will eliminate ('Kill') the virus. While many agents have been shown to reactivate large quantities of the latent reservoir, the impact on the size of the latent reservoir has been negligible. This suggests that the immune system is not sufficient to eliminate reactivated reservoirs. Thus, there is a need for more emphasis on 'kill' strategies in HIV cure research, and how these might work in combination with current or future kick strategies. We conducted a landscape review of HIV 'cure' clinical trials using 'kick and kill' approaches. We identified and reviewed current available clinical trial results in human participants as well as ongoing and planned clinical trials. We dichotomized trials by whether they did not include or include a 'kill' agent. We extracted potential reasons why the 'kill' is missing from current 'kick and kill' strategies. We subsequently summarized and reviewed current 'kill' strategies have entered the phase of clinical trial testing in human participants and highlighted those with the greatest promise. The identified 'kick' trials only showed promise on surrogate measures activating latent T-cells, but did not show any positive effects on clinical 'cure' measures. Of the 'kill' agents currently being tested in clinical trials, early results have shown small but meaningful proportions of participants remaining off ART for several months with broadly neutralizing antibodies, as well as agents for regulating immune cell responses. A similar result was also recently observed in a trial combining a conventional 'kick' with a vaccine immune booster\n\nThe Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMajewski, Steven R.; Brunner, Sophia; Burton, Adam\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), one of the programs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), has now completed its systematic, homogeneous spectroscopic survey sampling all major populations of the Milky Way.

If a component of the kick along the line of sight is present, gravitational waves emitted during the final orbits and merger will be gradually Doppler shifted as the kick builds up. We develop a simple prescription to capture this effect in existing waveform models, showing that future gravitational wave experiments will be able to perform direct measurements, not only of the black hole kick velocity, but also of its accumulation profile. In particular, the eLISA space mission will measure supermassive black hole kick velocities as low as â¼500ââkmâs^{-1}, which are expected to be a common outcome of black hole binary coalescence following galaxy mergers. Black hole kicks thus constitute a promising new observable in the growing field of gravitational wave astronomy.\n\nKinematic and EMG data during underwater dolphin kick change while synchronizing with or without synchronization of kick frequency with the beat of a metronome.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamakawa, Keisuke Kobayashi; Shimojo, Hirofumi; Takagi, Hideki; Tsubakimoto, Shozo; Sengoku, Yasuo\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe investigated the effects of synchronizing kick frequency with the beat of a metronome on kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) parameters during the underwater dolphin kick as a pilot study related to the research that entitled \" Effect of increased kick frequency on propelling efficiency and muscular co-activation during underwater dolphin kick\" (Yamakawa et al., 2017) [1]. Seven collegiate female swimmers participated in this experiment. The participants conducted two underwater dolphin kick trials: swimming freely at maximum effort, and swimming while synchronizing the kick frequency of maximum effort with the beat of a metronome. The kinematic parameters during the underwater dolphin kick were calculated by 2-D motion analysis, and surface electromyographic measurements were taken from six muscles (rectus abdominis, erector spinae, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius). The results revealed no significant differences in the kinematic and EMG parameters between trials of the two swimming techniques. Therefore, the action of synchronizing the kick frequency with the beat of a metronome did not affect movement or muscle activity during the underwater dolphin kick in this experiment.\n\nMachine learning in APOGEE. Unsupervised spectral classification with K-means\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarcia-Dias, Rafael; Allende Prieto, Carlos; SÃ¡nchez Almeida, Jorge; OrdovÃ¡s-Pascual, Ignacio\n\n2018-05-01\n\nContext. The volume of data generated by astronomical surveys is growing rapidly. Traditional analysis techniques in spectroscopy either demand intensive human interaction or are computationally expensive. In this scenario, machine learning, and unsupervised clustering algorithms in particular, offer interesting alternatives. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) offers a vast data set of near-infrared stellar spectra, which is perfect for testing such alternatives. Aims: Our research applies an unsupervised classification scheme based on K-means to the massive APOGEE data set. We explore whether the data are amenable to classification into discrete classes. Methods: We apply the K-means algorithm to 153 847 high resolution spectra (R â 22 500). We discuss the main virtues and weaknesses of the algorithm, as well as our choice of parameters. Results: We show that a classification based on normalised spectra captures the variations in stellar atmospheric parameters, chemical abundances, and rotational velocity, among other factors. The algorithm is able to separate the bulge and halo populations, and distinguish dwarfs, sub-giants, RC, and RGB stars. However, a discrete classification in flux space does not result in a neat organisation in the parameters' space. Furthermore, the lack of obvious groups in flux space causes the results to be fairly sensitive to the initialisation, and disrupts the efficiency of commonly-used methods to select the optimal number of clusters. Our classification is publicly available, including extensive online material associated with the APOGEE Data Release 12 (DR12). Conclusions: Our description of the APOGEE database can help greatly with the identification of specific types of targets for various applications. We find a lack of obvious groups in flux space, and identify limitations of the K-means algorithm in dealing with this kind of data.

However, while the instep-kick has been broadly studied, only few researchers investigated the inside-of-the-foot kick, which is one of the most frequently performed techniques during games. In particular, little knowledge is available about differences in kinematics when kicking with the preferred and non-preferred leg. A motion analysis system recorded the three-dimensional coordinates of reflective markers placed upon the body of nine amateur soccer players (23.0 Â± 2.1 years, BMI 22.2 Â± 2.6 kg/m2), who performed 30 pass-kicks each, 15 with the preferred and 15 with the non-preferred leg. We investigated skill kinematics while maintaining a perspective on the complete picture of movement, looking for laterality related differences. The main focus was laid on: anatomical angles, contribution of upper limbs in kick biomechanics, kinematics of the body Center of Mass (CoM), which describes the whole body movement and is related to balance and stability. When kicking with the preferred leg, CoM displacement during the ground-support phase was 13% higher (p<0.001), normalized CoM height was 1.3% lower (p<0.001) and CoM velocity 10% higher (p<0.01); foot and shank velocities were about 5% higher (p<0.01); arms were more abducted (p<0.01); shoulders were rotated more towards the target (p<0.01, 6Â° mean orientation difference). We concluded that differences in motor control between preferred and non-preferred leg kicks exist, particularly in the movement velocity and upper body kinematics. Coaches can use these results to provide effective instructions to players in the learning process, moving their focus on kicking speed and upper body behavior.\n\nSwimming Speed of The Breaststroke Kick\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStrzaÅa, Marek; KrÄÅ¼aÅek, Piotr; Kaca, Marcin; GÅÄ b, Grzegorz; Ostrowski, Andrzej; Stanula, Arkadiusz; Tyka, Aleksander\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe breaststroke kick is responsible for a considerable portion of the forward propulsion in breaststroke swimming. The aim of this study was to measure selected anthropometric variables and functional properties of a swimmerâs body: length of body parts; functional range of motion in the leg joints and anaerobic power of the lower limbs. Chosen kinematic variables useful in the evaluation of swimming performance in the breaststroke kick were evaluated. In the present research, swimming speed using breaststroke kicks depended to the largest extent on anaerobic endurance (0.46, p < 0.05 partial correlations with age control). In addition, knee external rotation and swimming technique index had an impact on swimming speed and kick length (both partial correlations with age control 0.35, p < 0.08). A kinematic analysis of the breaststroke kick hip displacement compatible with horizontal body displacement was significantly negatively correlated with foot slip in the water opposite to body displacement (partial correlations: with leg length control â0.43, p < 0.05; with shank length control â0.45, p < 0.05, respectively). Present research and measurements of selected body properties, physical endurance and kinematic movement analysis may help in making a precise determination of an athleteâs talent for breaststroke swimming.

As in projectile motion, the free-kick is ideal since we assume that a point-like ball moves in the absence of air resistance. We have experienced the fortunate conjuncture of a classical mechanics lecture taught right before an important football game. These types of sports events might trigger a great deal of attention from the classroom. The idealized problem is devised in such a way that students are eager to come to the end of the whole story.\n\nMassive Stars in the SDSS-IV/APOGEE SURVEY. I. OB Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoman-Lopes, A.; RomÃ¡n-ZÃºÃ±iga, C.; Tapia, Mauricio; Chojnowski, Drew; GÃ³mez Maqueo Chew, Y.; GarcÃ­a-HernÃ¡ndez, D.

G.; Zamora, Olga; Nitschelm, Christian\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this work, we make use of DR14 APOGEE spectroscopic data to study a sample of 92 known OB stars. We developed a near-infrared semi-empirical spectral classification method that was successfully used in case of four new exemplars, previously classified as later B-type stars. Our results agree well with those determined independently from ECHELLE optical spectra, being in line with the spectral types derived from the âcanonicalâ MK blue optical system. This confirms that the APOGEE spectrograph can also be used as a powerful tool in surveys aiming to unveil and study a large number of moderately and highly obscured OB stars still hidden in the Galaxy.\n\nSpectral relationships between kicked Harper and on-resonance double kicked rotor operators\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLawton, Wayne; Mouritzen, Anders S.; Wang Jiao\n\n2009-03-15\n\nKicked Harper operators and on-resonance double kicked rotor operators model quantum systems whose semiclassical limits exhibit chaotic dynamics. Recent computational studies indicate a striking resemblance between the spectra of these operators. In this paper we apply C*-algebra methods to explain this resemblance. We show that each pair of corresponding operators belongs to a common rotation C*-algebra B{sub {alpha}}, prove that their spectra are equal if {alpha} is irrational, and prove that the Hausdorff distance between their spectra converges to zero as q increases if {alpha}=p/q with p and q coprime integers. Moreover, we show that corresponding operators in B{sub {alpha}}moreÂ Â» are homomorphic images of mother operators in the universal rotation C*-algebra A{sub {alpha}} that are unitarily equivalent and hence have identical spectra. These results extend analogous results for almost Mathieu operators. We also utilize the C*-algebraic framework to develop efficient algorithms to compute the spectra of these mother operators for rational {alpha} and present preliminary numerical results that support the conjecture that their spectra are Cantor sets if {alpha} is irrational. This conjecture for almost Mathieu operators, called the ten Martini problem, was recently proven after intensive efforts over several decades. This proof for the almost Mathieu operators utilized transfer matrix methods, which do not exist for the kicked operators. We outline a strategy, based on a special property of loop groups of semisimple Lie groups, to prove this conjecture for the kicked operators.Â«Â less\n\nChemodynamical Clustering Applied to APOGEE Data: Rediscovering Globular Clusters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Boquan; DâOnghia, Elena; Pardy, Stephen A.; Pasquali, Anna; Bertelli Motta, Clio; Hanlon, Bret; Grebel, Eva K.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe have developed a novel technique based on a clustering algorithm that searches for kinematically and chemically clustered stars in the APOGEE DR12 Cannon data. As compared to classical chemical tagging, the kinematic information included in our methodology allows us to identify stars that are members of known globular clusters with greater confidence. We apply our algorithm to the entire APOGEE catalog of 150,615 stars whose chemical abundances are derived by the Cannon. Our methodology found anticorrelations between the elements Al and Mg, Na and O, and C and N previously identified in the optical spectra in globular clusters, even though we omit these elements in our algorithm. Our algorithm identifies globular clusters without a priori knowledge of their locations in the sky. Thus, not only does this technique promise to discover new globular clusters, but it also allows us to identify candidate streams of kinematically and chemically clustered stars in the Milky Way.\n\nLabel Transfer from APOGEE to LAMOST: Precise Stellar Parameters for 450,000 LAMOST Giants\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHo, Anna Y. Q.; Ness, Melissa K.; Hogg, David W.; Rix, Hans-Walter; Liu, Chao; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Yong; Hou, Yonghui; Wang, Yuefei\n\n2017-02-01\n\nIn this era of large-scale spectroscopic stellar surveys, measurements of stellar attributes (âlabels,â I.e., parameters and abundances) must be made precise and consistent across surveys. Here, we demonstrate that this can be achieved by a data-driven approach to spectral modeling. With The Cannon, we transfer information from the APOGEE survey to determine precise {T}{eff}, {log} {\\\\text{}}g, [{Fe}/{{H}}], and [Î± /{{M}}] from the spectra of 450,000 LAMOST giants. The Cannon fits a predictive model for LAMOST spectra using 9952 stars observed in common between the two surveys, taking five labels from APOGEE DR12 as ground truth {T}{eff}, {log} {\\\\text{}}g, [{Fe}/{{H}}], [Î± /{{M}}], and K-band extinction {A}{{k}}. The model is then used to infer {T}{eff}, {log} {\\\\text{}}g, [{Fe}/{{H}}], and [Î± /{{M}}] for 454,180 giants, 20% of the LAMOST DR2 stellar sample. These are the first [Î± /{{M}}] values for the full set of LAMOST giants, and the largest catalog of [Î± /{{M}}] for giant stars to date. Furthermore, these labels are by construction on the APOGEE label scale; for spectra with S/N > 50, cross-validation of the model yields typical uncertainties of 70 K in {T}{eff}, 0.1 in {log} {\\\\text{}}g, 0.1 in [{Fe}/{{H}}], and 0.04 in [Î± /{{M}}], values comparable to the broadly stated, conservative APOGEE DR12 uncertainties. Thus, by using âlabel transferâ to tie low-resolution (LAMOST R â 1800) spectra to the label scale of a much higher-resolution (APOGEE R â 22,500) survey, we substantially reduce the inconsistencies between labels measured by the individual survey pipelines. This demonstrates that label transfer with The Cannon can successfully bring different surveys onto the same physical scale.\n\nThe Physics of Kicking a Football.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBrancazio, Peter J.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nA physicist's view of the problems involved in kicking a football is described through the principles of projectile motion and aerodynamics. Sample equations, statistical summaries of kickoffs and punts, and calculation of launch parameters are presented along with discussion to clarify concepts of physics illustrated by kicking a football.

Recently the numerical relativity community has begun to measure the significant kicks found when both unequal masses and spins are considered. Because understanding the cause and magnitude of each component of this kick may be complicated in inspiral simulations, we consider these effects in the context of a simple test problem. We study recoils from collisions of binaries with initially head-on trajectories, starting with the simplest case of equal masses with no spin; adding spin and varying the mass ratio, both separately and jointly. We find spin-induced recoils to be significant even in head-on configurations. Additionally, it appears that the scaling of transverse kicks with spins is consistent with post-Newtonian (PN) theory, even though the kick is generated in the nonlinear merger interaction, where PN theory should not apply. This suggests that a simple heuristic description might be effective in the estimation of spin-kicks.\n\nLoading and performance of the support leg in kicking.\n\nPubMed\n\nBall, Kevin\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThe punt kick is important in many football codes and support leg kinematics and ground reaction forces have been implicated in injury and performance in kicking. To evaluate ground reaction forces and support leg kinematics in the punt kick. Cross sectional study. Seven elite Australian football players performed maximal kicks into a net using both the preferred and non-preferred legs. A force plate measured ground reaction forces and an optical motion capture system (200Hz) collected kinematic data during the stance phase of the kick. Preferred and non-preferred legs were compared and performance was evaluated by correlating parameters with foot speed at ball contact. Vertical forces were larger than running at a similar speed but did not reach levels that might be considered an injury risk. Braking forces were directed solely posteriorly, as for soccer kicks, but lateral force patterns varied with some players experiencing greater forces medially and others laterally. A more extended support leg, larger peak vertical and braking force during the stance phase and a shorter stance contact time was associated with larger kick leg foot speed at ball contact. No difference existed between the preferred and non-preferred legs for ground reaction forces or support leg mechanics. To punt kick longer, a straighter support leg, less time on the ground and stronger braking should be encouraged. Conditioning the support leg to provide stronger braking potential is recommended.

H.; Lawton, Wayne; Wang, Jiao; Gong, Jiangbin\n\n2013-11-01\n\nRecent studies have established that, in addition to the well-known kicked-Harper model (KHM), an on-resonance double-kicked rotor (ORDKR) model also has Hofstadter's butterfly Floquet spectrum, with strong resemblance to the standard Hofstadter spectrum that is a paradigm in studies of the integer quantum Hall effect. Earlier it was shown that the quasienergy spectra of these two dynamical models (i) can exactly overlap with each other if an effective Planck constant takes irrational multiples of 2Ï and (ii) will be different if the same parameter takes rational multiples of 2Ï. This work makes detailed comparisons between these two models, with an effective Planck constant given by 2ÏM/N, where M and N are coprime and odd integers. It is found that the ORDKR spectrum (with two periodic kicking sequences having the same kick strength) has one flat band and N-1 nonflat bands with the largest bandwidth decaying in a power law as ËKN+2, where K is a kick strength parameter. The existence of a flat band is strictly proven and the power-law scaling, numerically checked for a number of cases, is also analytically proven for a three-band case. By contrast, the KHM does not have any flat band and its bandwidths scale linearly with K. This is shown to result in dramatic differences in dynamical behavior, such as transient (but extremely long) dynamical localization in ORDKR, which is absent in the KHM. Finally, we show that despite these differences, there exist simple extensions of the KHM and ORDKR model (upon introducing an additional periodic phase parameter) such that the resulting extended KHM and ORDKR model are actually topologically equivalent, i.e., they yield exactly the same Floquet-band Chern numbers and display topological phase transitions at the same kick strengths. A theoretical derivation of this topological equivalence is provided. These results are also of interest to our current understanding of quantum-classical correspondence considering that the\n\nEXPLORING DATA-DRIVEN SPECTRAL MODELS FOR APOGEE M DWARFS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLua Birky, Jessica; Hogg, David; Burgasser, Adam J.; Jessica Birky\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Cannon (Ness et al. 2015; Casey et al. 2016) is a flexible, data-driven spectral modeling and parameter inference framework, demonstrated on high-resolution Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE; Î»/ÎÎ»~22,500, 1.5-1.7Âµm) spectra of giant stars to estimate stellar labels (Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and chemical abundances) to precisions higher than the model-grid pipeline. The lack of reliable stellar parameters reported by the APOGEE pipeline for temperatures less than ~3550K, motivates extension of this approach to M dwarf stars. Using a training set of 51 M dwarfs with spectral types ranging M0-M9 obtained from SDSS optical spectra, we demonstrate that the Cannon can infer spectral types to a precision of +/-0.6 types, making it an effective tool for classifying high-resolution near-infrared spectra. We discuss the potential for extending this work to determine the physical stellar labels Teff, logg, and [Fe/H].This work is supported by the SDSS Faculty and Student (FAST) initiative.\n\nEvaluation of goal kicking performance in international rugby union matches.\n\nPubMed\n\nQuarrie, Kenneth L; Hopkins, Will G\n\n2015-03-01\n\nGoal kicking is an important element in rugby but has been the subject of minimal research. To develop and apply a method to describe the on-field pattern of goal-kicking and rank the goal kicking performance of players in international rugby union matches. Longitudinal observational study. A generalized linear mixed model was used to analyze goal-kicking performance in a sample of 582 international rugby matches played from 2002 to 2011. The model adjusted for kick distance, kick angle, a rating of the importance of each kick, and venue-related conditions. Overall, 72% of the 6769 kick attempts were successful. Forty-five percent of points scored during the matches resulted from goal kicks, and in 5.7% of the matches the result of the match hinged on the outcome of a kick attempt. There was an extremely large decrease in success with increasing distance (odds ratio for two SD distance 0.06, 90% confidence interval 0.05-0.07) and a small decrease with increasingly acute angle away from the mid-line of the goal posts (odds ratio for 2 SD angle, 0.44, 0.39-0.49). Differences between players were typically small (odds ratio for 2 between-player SD 0.53, 0.45-0.65). The generalized linear mixed model with its random-effect solutions provides a tool for ranking the performance of goal kickers in rugby. This modelling approach could be applied to other performance indicators in rugby and in other sports in which discrete outcomes are measured repeatedly on players or teams. Copyright Â© 2015.

The 12 SNRs are those for which we could both identify morphological features that we can attribute to jets and for which the direction of the NS natal kick is given in the literature. Unlike some claims for spin-kick alignment, here we rule out jet-kick alignment. We discuss the cumulative distribution function of the jet-kick angles under the assumption that dense clumps that are ejected by the explosion accelerate the NS by the gravitational attraction, and suggest that the jet feedback explosion mechanism might in principle account for the distribution of jet-kick angles.\n\nEffectiveness of roundhouse kick in elite Taekwondo athletes.\n\nPubMed\n\nThibordee, Sutima; Prasartwuth, Orawan\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe roundhouse kick is a powerful attack in Taekwondo. Most athletes intently perform this kick for scoring in competition. Therefore, kinematic and kinetic analyzes of this kick were the topics of interest; however, they were separately investigated and rarely recorded for impact force. Our objectives were to investigate knee and ankle joint kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity of leg muscle and compare them between high-impact (HI) and low-impact (LO) kicks. Sixteen male black-belt Taekwondo athletes performed five roundhouse kicks at their maximal effort. Electrogoniometer sensors measured angular motions of ankle and knee joints. Surface EMG activities were recorded for tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius medialis, rectus femoris, and biceps femoris muscles. Based on maximal impact forces, the athletes were classified into HI and LO groups. All athletes in both groups showed greater activation of rectus femoris than other muscles. The HI group only showed significantly less plantarflexion angles than the LO group during preimpact and impact phases (P<0.05). During the impact phase, the HI group demonstrated significantly greater biceps femoris activation than the LO group (P<0.05). In conclusion, rectus femoris activation could predominantly contribute to the powerful roundhouse kicks. Moreover, high biceps femoris co-activation and optimal angle of ankle plantarflexion of about 35Â° could help achieve the high impact force. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This issue is especially important in the traditional version of taekwon-do, in which a single strike may reveal the winner. Six taekwon-do (International Taekwon-do Federation) athletes were asked to participate in this case study. Generally accepted criteria of sports technique biomechanical analysis were adhered to. The athletes executed a side kick three times (in Taekwon-do terminology referred to as yop chagi) in a way which they use the kick in board breaking. The obtained data were used to determine the mean velocity changes in the function of relative extension length of the kicking leg. The maximum knee and foot velocities in the Cartesian coordinate system were determined. The leg lifting time and the duration of kick execution as well as the maximum force which the standing foot exerted on the ground were also determined. On the basis of the obtained values, mean values and standard deviations were calculated. The correlation dependence (r=0.72) shows that greater knee velocity affects the velocity which the foot develops as well as the fact that the total time of kick execution depends on the velocity which the knee (r = â0.59) and the foot (r = â 0.86) develop in the leg lifting phase. The average maximum speed was obtained at the length of the leg equal to 82% of the maximum length of the fully extended leg. This length can be considered the optimum value for achieving the maximum dynamics of the kick.

The aim of this study was to examine differences between preferred and non-preferred leg kicking in the drop punt kick. Seventeen elite Australian Football players performed kicks with the preferred and non-preferred leg. Optotrak Certus collected kinematic data of the kick leg and pelvis (200 Hz) from kick leg toe-off until ball contact. Foot speed, knee and shank angular velocity at ball contact, and pelvis range of motion were significantly larger for the preferred leg (P < 0.05). In contrast, hip and thigh angular velocity at ball contact and hip range of motion were significantly larger for the non-preferred leg. This indicates different movement patterns, with preferred-leg kicks making greater use of the pelvis, knee, and shank while non-preferred leg kicks rely relatively more on the hip and thigh (P < 0.05). Reasons for this difference might be due to locking degrees of freedom or sub-optimal sequencing in the non-preferred leg. The thigh-knee continuum identified by Ball ( 2008 ) was also evident in this study. Findings have implications for training non-preferred leg kicking for performance and injury prevention.\n\nBinary Black Hole Mergers and Recoil Kicks\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCentrella, Joan; Baker, J.; Choi, D.; Koppitz, M.; vanMeter, J.; Miller, C.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nRecent developments in numerical relativity have made it possible to follow reliably the coalescence of two black holes from near the innermost stable circular orbit to final ringdown. This opens up a wide variety of exciting astrophysical applications of these simulations. Chief among these is the net kick received when two unequal mass or spinning black holes merge. The magnitude of this kick has bearing on the production and growth of supermassive black holes during the epoch of structure formation, and on the retention of black holes in stellar clusters. Here we report the first accurate numerical calculation of this kick, for two nonspinning black holes in a 1.5:1 mass ratio, which is expected based on analytic considerations to give a significant fraction of the maximum possible recoil. We have performed multiple runs with different initial separations, orbital angular momenta, resolutions, extraction radii, and gauges. The full range of our kick speeds is 86-116 kilometers per second, and the most reliable runs give kicks between 86 and 97 kilometers per second. This is intermediate between the estimates from two recent post-Newtonian analyses and suggests that at redshifts z greater than 10, halos with masses less than 10(exp 9) M(sub SUN) will have difficulty retaining coalesced black holes after major mergers.\n\nCriticality in the quantum kicked rotor with a smooth potential.\n\nPubMed\n\nDutta, Rina; Shukla, Pragya\n\n2008-09-01\n\nWe investigate the possibility of an Anderson-type transition in the quantum kicked rotor with a smooth potential due to dynamical localization of the wave functions. Our results show the typical characteristics of a critical behavior, i.e., multifractal eigenfunctions and a scale-invariant level statistics at a critical kicking strength which classically corresponds to a mixed regime. This indicates the existence of a localization to delocalization transition in the quantum kicked rotor. Our study also reveals the possibility of other types of transition in the quantum kicked rotor, with a kicking strength well within the strongly chaotic regime. These transitions, driven by the breaking of exact symmetries, e.g., time reversal and parity, are similar to weak-localization transitions in disordered metals.\n\nTowards Hybrid Urban Mobility: Kick Scooter as a Means of Individual Transport in the City\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKostrzewska, MaÅgorzata; Macikowski, Bartosz\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe characteristic feature of a contemporary city is its inconvenience and oppressiveness caused by the hitherto dominant paradigm of urban planning based on car mobility. As a result, the inhabitants have to cope with air pollution, noise, spatial barriers, sedentary lifestyle and other factors which worsen their health and quality of life. Ecological and physically activating urban mobility thus plays an increasingly important role in the process of creating a friendly and healthy city. For many years, a steadily increasing share of bicycles in urban traffic has been observed. There are also other trending forms of non-motorized transport, such as in-line skates, skateboards, kick scooters, etc. Riding each of them can be regarded as a form of recreation or sport, but also as an ecological, physically activating means of urban mobility. The paper discusses the different forms of recreational mobility in the context of the possibility of combining it with city public transport, with particular emphasis on kick scooters. Kick scooters are becoming more and more popular, not only among children and youth, but also among adults, who use it mainly as a means of the non-motorised urban transport. Numerous publications from different parts of the world show a dynamic growth of this phenomenon. The aim of the article is also to answer the question in what extent the design of public space takes into consideration the use of these new forms of transport and recreation and, consequently, what aspects and requirements should be taken into account in the planning and design process. The paper presents the conclusions of a field study carried out with a group of students in Szczecin and Berlin. The aim of the research was to evaluate the possibilities of using kick scooters in big cities as a means of hybrid mobility combined with public transport by exploring the spectrum of public spaces (streets, squares, traffic nodes and hubs, public buildings, etc.) and testing the\n\nComparing Neutron Star Kicks to Supernova Remnant Asymmetries\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHolland-Ashford, Tyler; Lopez, Laura A.; Auchettl, Katie\n\n2017-07-20\n\nSupernova explosions are inherently asymmetric and can accelerate new-born neutron stars (NSs) to hundreds of km s{sup â1}. Two prevailing theories to explain NS kicks are ejecta asymmetries (e.g., conservation of momentum between NS and ejecta) and anisotropic neutrino emission. Observations of supernova remnants (SNRs) can give us insights into the mechanism that generates these NS kicks. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between NS kick velocities and the X-ray morphologies of 18 SNRs observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the RÃ¶ntgen Satellite ( ROSAT ). We measure SNR asymmetries using the power-ratio method (a multipole expansion technique),moreÂ Â» focusing on the dipole, quadrupole, and octupole power ratios. Our results show no correlation between the magnitude of the power ratios and NS kick velocities, but we find that for Cas A and G292.0+1.8, whose emission traces the ejecta distribution, their NSs are preferentially moving opposite to the bulk of the X-ray emission. In addition, we find a similar result for PKS 1209â51, CTB 109, and Puppis A; however, their emission is dominated by circumstellar/interstellar material, so their asymmetries may not reflect their ejecta distributions. Our results are consistent with the theory that NS kicks are a consequence of ejecta asymmetries as opposed to anisotropic neutrino emission. In the future, additional observations to measure NS proper motions within ejecta-dominated SNRs are necessary to robustly constrain the NS kick mechanism.Â«Â less\n\nGross motor skill performance in children with and without visual impairments--research to practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nWagner, Matthias O; Haibach, Pamela S; Lieberman, Lauren J\n\n2013-10-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to provide an empirical basis for teaching gross motor skills in children with visual impairments. For this purpose, gross motor skill performance of 23, 6-12 year old, boys and girls who are blind (ICD-10 H54.0) and 28 sighted controls with comparable age and gender characteristics was compared on six locomotor and six object control tasks using the Test of Gross Motor Development-Second Edition. Results indicate that children who are blind perform significantly (p<.05) worse in all assessed locomotor and object control skills, whereby running, leaping, kicking and catching are the most affected skills, and corresponding differences are related to most running, leaping, kicking and catching component.

The aim of this study was to analyse mechanical variables in the roundhouse kick in taekwondo according to three stance positions (0Â°, 45Â°, 90Â°). Nine experienced taekwondo athletes performed consecutive kicking trials in a random order according to these three relative positions of the feet on the ground. Measurements for the mechanical analysis were performed using two 3D force plates and an eight-camera motion capture system. The taekwondo athletes' reaction and execution times were shorter when starting from the 0Â° and 45Â° stance positions than from the 90Â° position (P < 0.05). Moreover, the ground reaction force was negatively correlated with execution time and positively with velocity of thigh and shank. Our results suggest that the stance position affects the execution technique of taekwondo athletes' kicks.

Existing membership catalogs span limited portions of the OSFC, reflecting the difficulty of selecting targets homogeneously across this extended, highly structured region. We have used data from wide-field photometric surveys to produce a less biased parent sample of young stellar objects (YSOs) with infrared (IR) excesses indicative of warm circumstellar materia"
