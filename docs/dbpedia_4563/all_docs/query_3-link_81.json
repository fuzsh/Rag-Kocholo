The CV-22 System Training Plan is the Air Force Special Operations Command planning document that serves as a companion to this JTSP, providing Air Force-specific information regarding the management of the CV-22 training system. This document is based upon POM 00 (post QDR 97) program profile - procuring 360 MV-22 aircraft and 50 CV-22 aircraft at a peak production rate of 30 MV and nine CV aircraft per year.\n\nThis JTSP contains all of the components included in a Navy Training Systems Plan (NTSP). As such, this JTSP can be considered a complete NTSP for the Marine Corps MV-22 and future Navy HV-22 aircraft. The Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the JTSP is Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV), Code N889. Follow-on minor administrative changes to this document will be approved by a V-22 Training Working Group, Executive Committee [PMA2052V, HQMC (APP, ASM, APW), N889H3, AETC, MCCDC (C-462A), AF/XO, and SOOP-CJ].\n\nThe V-22 \"Osprey\" Program is a Department of the Navy program responsible for developing, testing, evaluating, procuring, and fielding a tilt-rotor, vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for Joint Service application. The V-22 will provide the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps with a multi-engine, dual piloted, self-deployable, medium lift, Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft to be used to conduct combat, combat support, combat service support, and special operations missions worldwide. The V-22 is in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase of the weapon system acquisition process.\n\nThe V-22 Program is tasked to provide an aircraft to accomplish the Marine Corps' amphibious and vertical assault missions; the Navy's fleet combat support and strike rescue missions; and the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) long-range Special Operations Force (SOF) support missions. The V-22 will replace the CH-46E and CH-53D helicopters in the Marine Corps; augment and replace yet to be determined aircraft in the Navy; replace USSOCOM's MH-53J and MH-60G Helicopters; and reduce dependence on USSOCOM's MC-130E/H fleet. The V-22 will be capable of flying over 2100 nautical miles with one aerial refueling, giving the Services the advantage of a Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing aircraft that can rapidly self-deploy to any location in the world.\n\nMaintenance concepts for the V-22 Program will be based on the Navy and Marine Corp Service's maintenance policies, which will be modified for each service application. The Navy and Marine Corps will use the Naval Aviation Maintenance Program, OPNAV Instruction 4790.2 Series, which details a three-level maintenance concept; organizational, intermediate, and depot. Interim contractor maintenance support is planned until military organic support capability is reached by the various services.\n\nInitial training for Developmental and Operational Test personnel from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, Maryland, and Multi-service Operational Test Team will be conducted at the contractor's facilities, and at NAWCAD, Patuxent River. Initial training for fleet cadre personnel will be conducted at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River, North Carolina. Service and mission-unique training will be developed to support each service's unique mission requirements. Marine Medium Tilt-Rotor Training Squadron 204, MCAS New River, will be designated the Fleet Readiness Squadron for V-22 aircrew and the Fleet Replacement Enlisted Skills Training, for maintenance training. Air Force V-22 maintenance training will be provided at MCAS, New River. A CV-22 school within the 58 Special Operations Wing at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico will provide SOF peculiar aircrew training. A Memorandum of Agreement between the Services on training details exact relationships, responsibilities, training, and concepts of support.\n\nDetails on the Navy's V-22 program are not available and are not mentioned in this JTSP. As the information becomes available it will be included in this JTSP.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nPage\n\nExecutive Summary i\n\nList of Acronyms v\n\nPreface x\n\nPART I - TECHNICAL PROGRAM DATA\n\nA.

It has been updated to comply with guidelines set forth in the Navy Training Requirements Documentation Manual and was developed per the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations Instruction (OPNAVINST) 1500.76 to identify Manpower, Personnel, and Training requirements.\n\nThe JTSP provides a summary of resources and processes planned to successfully train personnel to operate and support the V-22 Osprey weapon system. It is a living document, subject to multiple revisions as the V-22 program evolves. Separate requirements documents such as the Joint Operational Requirements Document (JORD), Training Devices Requirements Document (TDRD), Weapon System Planning Document (WSPD), and other force planning documents provide the controlling authority for the information summarized here. Changes to these documents will necessitate changes to this JTSP. Successive updates and revisions to this JTSP represent a meaningful planning exercise for the successful fielding of the V-22 Osprey. Details on the Navy's V-22 program are not available and are not addressed in this JTSP. Navy information will be included in this JTSP as it becomes available.\n\nCore components of this JTSP, when combined with the United States Air Force (USAF) CV-22 System Training Plan (STP), provide necessary training planning for the Air Force CV-22 Aircraft. The Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the CV-22 STP is Air Force Special Operations Command / Director of Training (AFSOC/DOT). Specific changes to this JTSP are as follows:\n\nThe Fleet Replacement Enlisted Skills Training (FREST), a companion to the Fleet Readiness Squadron (FRS) Marine Medium Tilt-rotor Training Squadron (VMMT)-204 will be the model manager and training site for inter-service training at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), New River, North Carolina. \"A\" School core and strand training requirements for the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and skills training requirements for the USAF have been identified. Follow-on maintenance training is being developed.\n\nAn updated description of Full Flight Simulator (FFS) and Flight Training Device (FTD) simulator acquisitions is included in this JTSP.\n\nParts II and III of this JTSP have been updated to reflect the most current manpower and training requirements indicated in the latest V-22 USMC Tables of Organization (T/Os), USAF student throughput requirements, and newly established maintenance training courses. Part VII has been updated to reflect the current V-22 Osprey Program points of contact.\n\nN88-NTSP-A-50-8412D/D\n\nMarch 1999\n\nPART I - TECHNICAL PROGRAM DATA\n\nA.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\n\n1. Operational Uses. The V-22 Osprey Program consists of a Joint Multi-Mission Vertical Lift Aircraft that provides the USMC, Headquarters USSOCOM, USAF, and the United States Navy (USN) with a multi-engine, dual piloted, self-deployable, medium lift, vertical take-off and landing aircraft to be used to conduct combat, combat support, combat service support, and special operations missions worldwide. Missions include, but are not limited to, amphibious assault, land assault, raid operations, medium cargo lift, Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), and Special Operations Force (SOF) support. The aircraft (MV-22 for the USMC, CV-22 for USSOCOM, and HV-22 for the USN) are capable of conducting operations in adverse weather, during daylight hours or at night, in climates from arctic to tropical from aviation and air capable ships (primary operating and support sea bases are Amphibious Assault (General Purpose) (LHA) and Amphibious Assault (Multi Purpose) (LHD) class ships, or from improved and unimproved landing sites ashore; and in a variety of conventional, unconventional, and contingency combat situations including Chemical, Biological, and Radiological warfare conditions. An air refueling capability will extend the aircraft's combat mission range when required, and it will be self-supporting to the maximum extent possible.\n\n2. Foreign Military Sales. Currently, there are no cooperative development or Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs established. FMS will be addressed as required and incorporated into future updates to this JTSP.\n\nE. DEVELOPMENTAL TEST AND OPERATIONAL TEST. Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) is being conducted and managed by the Rotary Wing Test Directorate, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, Maryland, using an Integrated Test Team comprised of Bell-Boeing and Government personnel. Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) is being conducted by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) Multi-Service Operational Test Team (MOTT) and monitored by the Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR), Norfolk, Virginia. The MOTT consists of selected aircrew and engineering personnel from the Marine Corps and Air Force who have received V-22 factory training. Current planning is for the V-22 Operational Evaluation (OPEVAL) to be performed at Marine Corps Air Facility (MCAF) Quantico, Virginia, and multiple sites throughout the United States, and the CV-22 Unique Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) to be performed at Kirtland Air Force Base (AFB), Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nF. AIRCRAFT AND/OR EQUIPMENT/SYSTEM/SUBSYSTEM REPLACED. The V-22 will replace the CH-46E and CH-53A/D helicopters in the Marine Corps; replace USSOCOM's MH-53J and MH-60G helicopters; and supplement USSOCOM's MC-130E/H fleet. CSAR requirements of the USN by the HV-22 variant will augment and replace an as yet to be determined (TBD) aircraft.\n\nG. DESCRIPTION OF NEW DEVELOPMENT\n\n1. Functional Description. The V-22 is a dual-piloted, twin engine, medium-lift, tilt-rotor aircraft that combines the speed, range, and fuel efficiency of a turboprop aircraft with the slow flight and hover capabilities of a helicopter. Its design incorporates advanced, but mature technologies in composite materials, fly-by-wire flight controls, digital cockpits, survivability, airfoil design, and manufacturing.\n\nThe V-22 fuselage has a number of advanced composite structures. A rear loading ramp has been incorporated, which when closed, comprises the lower portion of the aft fuselage section. There is one side-entry personnel door.\n\nThe V-22 power plant (designated T406-AE-1107), auxiliary internal fuel capacity, and an aerial refueling capability give the V-22 the ability to self-deploy worldwide. Changes necessary to convert the basic assault troop transport configuration for other missions will be simple and easily accomplished by organizational level maintenance personnel in field and shipboard environments.\n\n2. Physical Description. The MV-22B configuration aircraft serves as the baseline design. The CV-22 configuration will include additional wing fuel tanks, a Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance radar, and enhanced avionics packages to satisfy SOF specific mission requirements. A complete description of V-22 systems and subsystems is provided in the V-22 Detail Specification (SD-572-1, Rev. C) and Appendices.\n\nV-22 AIRCRAFT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\nWeight (in pounds) 33,140 (Empty)\n\n60,500 (Maximum Take-Off)\n\nLength 57 feet 4 inches\n\nHeight 22 feet 1 inch\n\nFuselage Width 15 feet 3 inches\n\nTotal Tilt-rotor Span 84 feet 7 inches\n\nIndividual Tilt-rotor Diameter 38 feet 1 inch\n\n3. New Development Introduction. The V-22 Osprey will be introduced as new production aircraft to replace designated aircraft at existing operating activities.\n\nThe Marine Corps will employ a phased strategy for the transition of the Marine Corps Medium Lift fleet to the MV-22 aircraft. Twenty-two CH-46E/CH-53D squadrons will transition to the MV-22 aircraft (18 active and four reserve). Upon transition, each squadron will maintain an aircraft inventory (Primary Aircraft Authorized (PAA)) of 12 aircraft. The estimated time-to-train for a squadron transitioning to the MV-22 aircraft is approximately 24-30 months (Stand-down, Transition, Post-Transition, Pre-Deployment Training).\n\n4. Significant Interfaces. Not Applicable (NA)\n\n5. New Features, Configurations, or Material. The V-22 is the first tilt-rotor aircraft to be fielded in the military. It is a hybrid aircraft, combining selected capabilities of an airplane and a helicopter. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has classified tilt rotors as powered lift aircraft, neither airplane nor rotorcraft. The V-22 uses many unique items to achieve its configuration and capability. The airframe incorporates new materials and structural designs. Advanced avionics provide mission enhancement while new wiring technologies increase reliability and reduce weight. New hydraulic technology is also applied. Redundant digital systems such as fly-by-wire flight controls are used in lieu of traditional hybrid redundancies. New processes are applied in the operation and maintenance of the V-22. Examples include the mission planning station used by aircrew before flight, and the maintenance station used between flights to automatically identify defects and conduct trend analysis to predict future maintenance actions.\n\nH. CONCEPTS\n\n1. Operational Concept. The aircraft is manned by a pilot, copilot, and enlisted aircrew appropriate for the specific service and type of mission being flown. The V-22 is optimized to transport troops (i.e., 24 combat-equipped Marines, or 10,000 pounds of external cargo) to austere landing sites from aviation capable amphibious ships and expeditionary forward operating bases ashore.\n\n2. Maintenance Concept. The maintenance concept for the V-22 is based on a Logistics Support Analysis (LSA) of the aircraft's maintainability, life-cycle cost, maintenance engineering, and logistics support requirements. The Naval Aviation Maintenance Program (NAMP), OPNAVINST 4790.2G, and Air Force Special Operations Command Instruction (AFSOCI) 21-106 provide general guidance regarding the various services' maintenance concepts. For the Navy and Marine Corps, the NAMP details three levels of maintenance (organizational, intermediate, and depot) and provides an organizational structure to collect supporting data.\n\nThe Air Force will use a two-level (organizational and depot) maintenance concept for avionics and engines. The remainder will be maintained through three levels of maintenance. During DT&E, maintenance and logistics support is the responsibility of the contractor, Bell-Boeing. During OT&E, organizational maintenance will be performed by factory trained personnel from the MOTT. The contractor will provide intermediate maintenance support.\n\na. Organizational. Operating units normally perform organizational level maintenance actions on a day-to-day basis in support of its own mission. These actions are generally classified as Preventive Maintenance (PM) and Corrective Maintenance (CM). The T406-AD-400 engine will be maintained under a commercial two-level maintenance concept where the contractor (Allison Engine) provides for all aircraft maintenance beyond the organizational level at Allison repair centers. The Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force will only be responsible for performing T406-AD-400 engine organizational level maintenance.\n\n(1) Preventive Maintenance. PM consists of periodic prescribed inspections and servicing of the aircraft, systems, and subsystems as detailed in the aircraft's Maintenance Requirement Cards and Maintenance Plan.\n\n(2) Corrective Maintenance. CM is performed by organizational level maintenance personnel using Built-In-Test (BIT), Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE), and Common Support Equipment (CSE) to fault isolate defective Weapon Replaceable Assemblies (WRA) and Line Replaceable Units. CM includes repairs to powerplants, airframes, aircraft wiring, and connectors. Defective WRAs are forwarded to the Intermediate Maintenance Activity for repair.\n\nb. Intermediate. Intermediate level maintenance actions are those performed in support of user activities that are beyond the capabilities of organizational level maintenance. These actions include test, repair, calibration, and modification of aeronautical equipment; repair and calibration of support equipment; and disposition of assets from stricken aircraft. Intermediate level maintenance will be performed to verify faulty WRAs and isolate to a faulty Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA), or component, using the appropriate test equipment. The faulty SRA will be removed, repaired, and replaced, and WRA performance verified by the appropriate test equipment. Depending on the system involved, the Air Force will perform some of these maintenance tasks at the organizational, or depot level, to support the two-level maintenance concept.\n\nc. Depot. Depot level maintenance actions normally require repair, major overhaul, or a complete rebuilding, manufacture, or modification of parts, assemblies, sub-assemblies, and end items beyond the capabilities of intermediate level maintenance. Naval Aviation Depot (NAVAVNDEPOT) MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina, is planned be the depot repair site for all Marine Corps and Air Force V-22 aircraft (less engines). The depot for Navy has not yet been determined.\n\nd. Interim Maintenance\n\n(1) Phased Support Concept. Maintenance responsibility under the phased support concept is a joint services-contractor effort until the V-22 systems demonstrate the level of reliability required for complete organic support. Early organic capability will be established for systems demonstrating acceptable reliability, maintainability, and supportability. This concept will be in effect until the full Material Support Date (MSD) of June 2004 is achieved. The Organic Support Dates for the Marine Corps and Air Force are TBD.\n\n(2) Sources of Technical Support. The Marine Corps will have crash damage depot repair capabilities at NAVAVNDEPOT, MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina. The planned Government Support Date for the V-22 is 2005. Engineering and Technical Services (ETS) will provide all required technical assistance until the Government Support Date. ETS will also provide required technical assistance for the Air Force.\n\ne. Life-Cycle Maintenance Plan. The V-22 has a minimum service life of 20 years and contains diagnostics using automatic, semi-automatic, and manual means. It is the first military aircraft to use the Aircraft Maintenance Event Ground Station (AMEGS). AMEGS is a maintenance data system that uses downloaded data from a data storage system in the aircraft as input to the Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS) and the Core Automated Maintenance System for the purpose of immediate identification and assessment of aircraft discrepancies. AMEGS is government furnished and will be assessed for workability and reliability from the standpoint of the V-22 Weapon System. AMEGS capabilities and requirements along with its planned integration with NALCOMIS Phase III will be evaluated.\n\n3. Manning Concept. Navy and Marine Corps qualitative and quantitative manpower requirements for the operation and support of the V-22 weapon system were developed using LSA under an Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract per Chapter 4 of ILS-DS-30A-202, Revision C. Maintenance manpower requirements were generated by the contractor using LSA data and Maintenance and Material Management data from comparable aircraft systems (CH-46E Aircraft). Particular JORD requirements for the V-22 include specific manpower structure to operate and maintain the aircraft over a period of time in a developed workload mode. T/Os have been developed for the MV-22 based on a 12 aircraft operating squadron and one 40 aircraft training squadron (VMMT-204). For detailed information on Marine Corps manpower, refer to Element II.A.1.b of this JTSP.\n\nThe Air Force manpower requirements will also be derived using the LSA during EMD. Air Force requirements will be based on target labor analysis and target labor hours per flying hour. Standard Air Force skills (levels 9, 7, 5 and 3) will be used. The aircraft will be operationally maintained by level three and five personnel. For information concerning Air Force manpower requirements, refer to the V-22 Manpower Estimate Report (MER) dated 17 June 1996.\n\nNote: Manpower requirements for the Navy are still in the planning stages. Information concerning the requirements for the development of squadron manpower documents and newly established Navy Enlisted Classifications (NECs) will be included in this JTSP when it becomes available.\n\na. Aircrew Planning Factors. Marine Corps aircrew manpower requirements were developed per OPNAVINST 5310.21 and are based on the number of aircraft, flight hours per aircraft per month, seat factors, and crew ratios. USAF manpower requirements were provided by the Air Force Personnel Center. Table I-1 provides a summary of aircrew configurations, manning factors, and their applicable Military Occupational Specialties (MOS). Table I-2 provides projected aircraft utilization rates.\n\nTABLE I-1.

Enlisted Maintenance Instructor Manpower Requirements. Enlisted maintenance instructor requirements for VMMT-204 FREST at the organizational level are based on the methodology contained in the Inter-service Training Review Organization (ITRO). Initial enlisted instructor requirements are shown in Element II.A.3 of this JTSP.\n\nAir Force instructor requirements. [Have not yet been fully determined (Inter-service training guidance indicates USAF will provide a fair share instructor presence). When information becomes available, it will be included in future updates to this document.] Table I-5 depicts a list of Air Force instructor AFSCs. These AFSCs are pending approval and will be included in the Air Force CV-22 STP.\n\nTABLE I-5. USAF INSTRUCTOR REQUIREMENTS\n\nd. Fleet Project Team. A Fleet Project Team (FPT) has been established to assist and advise in the development of the operator and maintainer training systems. The FPT is composed of knowledgeable representatives from user and non-user activities consisting of DoN, USAF, and USMC qualified military and civilian personnel per OPNAVINST 5000.50A and the CV-22 STP.\n\n4. Training Concept. The contractor, Bell-Boeing, has developed a training program using the MV-22B as the baseline. Training courses have been designed in modules to provide the opportunity to select which courses, or portions of courses, best meet training requirements (based upon service unique missions, student entry levels, prior experience, etc.). Service-specific training not included in the modular \"core\" training will be developed at a later date to fulfill those requirements. V-22 training for the Selected Reserve (SELRES) is undetermined. As SELRES training requirements are identified, they will be included in updates to this JTSP.\n\nThe Marine Corps plans to implement a Mission Training Support System (MTSS) to provide follow-on support for the V-22 operator and maintenance training program. All functions of simulator support (simulator and academic instruction; maintenance and operation; curriculum and supply support; and auxiliary management) will be integrated into one contract. Under this concept, the contractor will be responsible for:\n\nContractor Operation and Maintenance of Simulators.\n\nContractor Operation and Maintenance of Simulators will ensure all V-22 primary training devices are maintained and operationally available 16 hours a day, five days a week, 50 weeks a year. These training devices include the Operational Flight Trainer (OFT), Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT), Naval Aviation Maintenance Trainer Suite (NAMTS), Full Flight Simulator (FFS), and the Flight Training Device (FTD).\n\nContractor Simulator Instruction.\n\nContractor Simulator Instruction will be required at VMMT-204 FRS, MCAS New River. This requirement for instruction will begin with the training of the VMMT-204 Instructor Pilot Cadre. Contractor Simulator Instructors (CSI) will provide simulator instruction in the OFT, CPT, FFS and FTD. This training is expected to begin in June 1999, upon acceptance of the V-22 OFT/CPT update program (converting devices from MV-22A to MV-22B configuration) at MCAS, New River. The CSIs will conduct briefings, debriefings, and syllabus flights, and evaluate pilot performance. Once the instructor cadre is trained, CSIs will instruct all simulator training and replacement events in support of VMMT-204. This training will include initial aircrew training, transition/conversion training, refresher training, as well as follow-on instructor training. After completing an established CSI training and mobilization period, CSIs will be certified by the model manager. CSIs will be required to attend VMMT-204 Instructor Standardization meetings, Air Force requirements lectures, complete semi-annual standardization evaluations, and complete annual Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) and Instrument checks in the simulator to remain certified.\n\nContractor Curriculum Support.\n\nContractor Curriculum Support (CCS) will be required to maintain, update, and revise curriculum and instructional standards. CCS will:\n\nManage changes and revisions to existing curriculum\n\nAssist in the development of new curriculum\n\nMaintain quality assurance\n\nEstablish, monitor, and regulate evaluation programs\n\nEnsure instructor currency\n\nContractor Supply Support.\n\nContractor supply support will provide for the repair, replacement, and upkeep of the training system Material Support Package (MSP). The MSP will be used to support trainer operation and maintenance as specified under MTSS. The contractor will provide for the repair and replenishment of all simulator and trainer peculiar items, as well as bit piece parts. The government will provide any aircraft common equipment and parts through the government military supply system.\n\nManagement and Auxiliary Support.\n\nManagement and auxiliary support will provide a contractor site representative, clerical assistance, janitorial services, and facility access control at each simulator and trainer site. The contractor, under the supervision of Naval Air Warfare Center, Training Support Division (In-Service Engineering Office - ISEO), will provide trainer software support at MCAS New River.\n\nTraining in Support of Engineering and Manufacturing Development.\n\nDuring EMD, the contractor provides factory training at contractor and government facilities to coincide with the needs of the V-22 Flight Test schedule. Organizational level training is being developed and will be taught by Bell-Boeing. Training for Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Test (OT) pilots will be facilitated by using the Manned Flight Simulator (MFS) located at NAWCAD, Patuxent River. DT&E is expected to be completed in fourth quarter Fiscal Year (FY)99. MV-22B OPEVAL is scheduled for completion in 2000. CV-22 IOT&E is scheduled for 2001-2002.\n\na. Initial Training. The first squadron to receive MV-22B Aircraft will be VMMT-204. Aircrew and maintenance cadre training is currently scheduled to begin in FY00. After the cadre has received training and sufficient aircraft arrive, training of the remainder of VMMT-204 will begin. Navy initial training has not yet been determined.\n\nb. Follow-on Training. Initially, USMC follow-on training will be conducted by VMMT-204 FRS, MCAS New River. All follow-on training for pilots and enlisted aircrew will be conducted per appropriate service directives. Pilot and Enlisted aircrew training has not been fully determined. For planning purposes the USMC will use a six-month training duration for pilots and enlisted aircrew; and it will be reevaluated once USMC students begin going through training. As information becomes available it will be included in this JTSP. Follow-on flight training will be based on a core MV-22B curriculum that will be followed by service-unique training (i.e., CSAR, Medical Evacuation, troop lift, and assault support). CV-22 SOF-unique aircrew training will be conducted at the 58 Special Operations Wing (SOW), Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, as set forth in the AFSOC CV-22 STP. V-22 Follow-on training will begin in third quarter FY01.\n\n(1) Pilot Training. This training will be designed to provide aviators with the ability, skills, and knowledge to safely and effectively operate the V-22 aircraft as Pilot-In-Command and Functional Check Pilot during day/night Visual Meteorological Conditions. Training will consist of ground school instrument procedures training and flight training.\n\n(2) USMC Enlisted Aircrew Training. Training will be conducted at VMMT-204 per the Training and Readiness Manual MCO 3500M.\n\n(3) USAF Flight Engineer Training. Air Force flight engineer training at the inter-service school will follow the USMC Enlisted Aircrew Training. Follow-on CV-22 lead-in course will be conducted at Kirtland AFB. Further information is contained in the CV-22 STP.\n\n(4) Maintenance Training. Maintenance training is currently being developed to provide personnel with the skills and knowledge required to safely and effectively detect, diagnose, and perform appropriate organizational corrective maintenance for problems that could be encountered during operational flight tests. The following is a list of proposed organizational level maintenance courses. (Note: Course lengths are notional, as curriculum development continues).\n\nc. Student Profiles.

Training Pipelines. The proposed Marine Corps training tracks to support V-22 referenced in Part III of this JTSP are not currently in the Catalog of Navy Training Courses (CANTRAC) or the OPNAV Aviation Training Management System (OATMS). The Air Force enlisted maintenance training pipelines were taken from the CV-22 STP and the Air Force Catalog AFCAT 36-2223. Air Force attended courses will be enumerated in CANTRAC, OATMS, and the Air Force Training Management Systems (AFTMS). The following is a list of proposed training tracks and the courses incorporated in them for the V-22 aircraft:\n\nTRAINING TRACK NUMBER\n\nCOURSE NUMBER AND TITLE\n\nM-601-XXXX\n\nC-601-3626, V-22 Power Plants / Rotors and Related Organizational Maintenance\n\nC-600-3180, Basic Mechanic\n\nM-603-XXXX\n\nC-603-3626, V-22 Hydraulic Systems Organizational Maintenance\n\nM-603-3627, V-22 Airframes Systems Organizational Maintenance\n\nM-602-XXX1\n\nC-198-3626, V-22 Cockpit Management Display Systems\n\nC-102-3627, V-22 Avionics Systems Organizational Maintenance\n\nC-102-3626, V-22 Electrical Systems Organizational Maintenance\n\nC-602-3626, V-22 Connector and Wiring Harness Repair / Manufacturing\n\nM-602-XXX2\n\nC-602-3627, V-22 Environmental Control / Miscellaneous Utilities / Egress Systems Organizational Maintenance\n\nC-102-3626, V-22 Electrical Systems Organizational Maintenance\n\nC-602-3626, V-22 Connector and Wiring Harness Repair / Manufacturing\n\nM-602-XXX3\n\nC-198-3626, V-22 Cockpit Management Display Systems\n\nC-102-3626, V-22 Electrical Systems Organizational Maintenance\n\nC-602-3626, V-22 Connector and Wiring Harness Repair / Manufacturing\n\nI. ON-BOARD (IN-SERVICE) TRAINING\n\n1. Proficiency or Other Training Organic to the New Development. On-board proficiency training will be conducted to improve and enhance the capabilities of all V-22 Program individuals. For USMC personnel, the Individual Training Standards System, Marine Aviation Training Management and Evaluation Program (MATMEP), will be used to establish an effective and efficient training system that is responsive to USMC fleet training requirements. USAF On-board (continuation) training will be addressed in the USAF CV-22 STP. Navy on-board training requirements have not been determined.\n\na. Aviation Maintenance In-Service Training. Aviation Maintenance In-Service Training (AMIST) is intended to support the Fleet training requirements now satisfied by Maintenance Training Improvement Program (MTIP), and in that sense is the planned replacement. However, it is structured very differently, and will function as an integral part of the new Aviation Maintenance Training Continuum System (AMTCS) that will replace the existing aviation maintenance training structure. AMIST will provide standardized instruction to bridge the training gaps between initial and career training. With implementation of AMIST, technicians will be provided the training required to maintain a level of proficiency necessary to effectively perform the required tasks to reflect career progression. AMIST will begin when funding becomes available. The Air Force will accomplish in-service training per the Air Force STP.\n\nb. Aviation Maintenance Training Continuum System. AMTCS will redesign the aviation training process (training continuum), and introduce Computer-Based Training (CBT) throughout the Navy technical training process. The application and adoption of recent advances in computer hardware and software technology will enable CBT, with its basic elements of Computer Managed Instruction, Computer Aided Instruction, and Interactive Courseware, to be integrated into the training continuum and provide essential support for standardizing technical training.\n\n2. Personnel Qualification Standards. NA.\n\n3. Other On-Board or In-Service Training Packages. Marine Corps on-board training is based on the current series of MCO P4790.12, Individual Training Standards System and MATMEP. This program is designed to meet Marine Corps, as well as Navy OPNAVINST 4790.2 series maintenance training requirements. It is a performance-based, standardized, level-progressive, documentable, training management and evaluation program. It identifies and prioritizes task inventories by MOS through a front-end analysis process that identifies task, skill, and knowledge requirements of each MOS. (MATMEP will be replaced by AMTCS in approximately FY02.)\n\nJ. LOGISTICS SUPPORT\n\n1.

Program Documentation. The current Joint Integrated Logistics Support Plan (JILSP) is dated 26 Mar 1997.\n\n3. Technical Data Plan. The following V-22 series technical manuals are required to support the V-22 acquisition effort:\n\nService Unique Flight Manuals (NATOPS USN and USMC, Flight Manual USAF)\n\nInteractive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM)\n\nMaintenance Instruction Manuals (MIM)\n\nStructural Repair Publications\n\nIllustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB)\n\nMaintenance Requirement Cards (MRC)\n\nThese publications will be developed in progressive stages that reflect aircraft configuration changes. All three services will be included in the progressive stages of publication development.\n\n4. Test Sets, Tools, and Test Equipment. Training Device (TD) and Technical Training Equipment (TTE) requirements and the logistics support required are being developed per MIL-STD-490. Operator and maintenance TDs and TTE developed to Type \"A\" detailed performance specifications will be required. TDs are being designed specifically to support the \"core\" training concept and will support any cadre training provided to the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy service members. Service-peculiar TD requirements will also be procured based upon the basic core trainers. Marine Corps TD usage is planned for 16 hours per day, five days per week, 50 weeks per year. The TDs are capable of being used on an as-available basis for instructing maintenance personnel on the techniques and safety aspects of engine and aircraft system operation. Table I-6 lists the projected location and number of TDs for the V-22 Program. An analysis is being conducted on each system to establish scheduled and unscheduled maintenance requirements for all levels of maintenance. From the identification of these maintenance requirements, the support equipment, special tools, and test equipment are being identified and included as a requirement on the Support Equipment Recommendation Data List for procurement. The AN/USM-636(V) Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) will be used to support the V-22 systems. The specific systems to be supported on CASS have not been determined. When this information becomes available it will be included in updates to this JTSP.\n\nTABLE I-6. V-22 TRAINING DEVICES\n\n* An FFS will replace the OFT.\n\na. Operational Flight Trainer (2F151). This device is an operational flight system trainer capable of providing training in the development of pilot skills and techniques in the MV-22B aircraft. The OFT is able to simulate MV-22B aircraft performance during cockpit preflight, aircraft start up, all flight operations in both conversion and fixed wing modes, navigational flight, instrument flight, aircraft shutdown, and cockpit postflight procedures. The OFT cockpit mirrors the actual aircraft and has a six degree of freedom, dome based motion platform. The OFT is capable of simulating MV-22B flight in all conditions including day, dusk, night, and instrument meteorological conditions. It is fully Night Vision Goggles (NVG) compatible with FLIR simulation capabilities. Training environments include operations at airfields, confined area landing sites, mountain areas, urban areas, low altitude flight areas, and aboard aircraft capable ships such as LHAs and LHDs. All aircraft maneuvers can be simulated to include normal flight procedures, auto-rotations, aerial refueling, formation flying, high altitude operations, nuclear, biological, and chemical operations, and low altitude terrain following operations, and may include physiological conditioning. The OFT is capable of simulating all emergencies and system malfunctions both visually and through cockpit instrumentation. The OFT and CPT are undergoing update to MV-22B configuration from MV-22A (they were originally procured under the Full-Scale Development program).\n\nb. Cockpit Procedures Trainer (2C71). The CPT will mirror the actual aircraft but will be mounted on a fixed base with no visual system. This device will effectively train and develop pilot skills in cockpit management system proficiency, instrument flight, and emergency system malfunction procedures. The CPT simulates MV-22B aircraft performance during cockpit preflight, aircraft start up, navigational and instrument flight, aircraft shut down, and cockpit postflight procedures.\n\nc. Full Flight Simulator / Flight Training Device. The FFS is a flight simulator with a full six degree-of-freedom motion base and an attached full color day, dusk, night visual system. The FFS is designed to support the MV-22B Training and Replacement syllabus, and includes a tactical environment simulation and supports simulator-to-simulator networking. The FFS is designed to meet the initial training needs of MV-22B aircrews in the proper operation of the MV-22B in all weather conditions, normal and emergency procedures, and NVG operations. The FFS will be the mainstay of operator training for the FRS. The FTD is similar to the FFS, but without the motion system, and is designed to meet proficiency training needs of MV-22B aircrews in instrument flight, emergency procedures, tactics, and to provide recurrent training for Fleet squadrons. FFSs and FTDs will be procured in both MV-22 and CV-22 configurations. The MV-22B training program will procure a total of seven FFSs and 23 FTDs for use by Marine Corps and Air Force operational and training squadrons. Of these devices, three FFSs and three FTDs are planned for MCAS New River.\n\nd. Composite Maintenance Trainers. Composite Maintenance Trainers (CMT) will be developed based on LSA data and the Instructional Systems Development process to support multiple system training on each TD. The following CMTs provide organizational maintenance personnel the training necessary to service, troubleshoot, repair, or remove and replace, as appropriate, the aircraft's major systems and subsystems. Together they comprise the NAMTS.\n\n11H134 Landing Gear/Fuel/Environmental Control Composite Maintenance Trainer *\n\n11H135 Hydraulic/Flight Control/Wing Stow Composite Maintenance Trainer\n\n11H136 Power Plant/Power Train Composite Maintenance Trainer\n\n11H137 Avionics/Cockpit Management Display System Composite Maintenance Trainer\n\n11H138 Cockpit Maintenance Procedures Trainer\n\n11H160 Instructor Operator Station\n\n* This trainer already includes CV-22 fuel features (kits for MV-22B).\n\ne. Computer-Based Training. It is the intent of the V-22 Training System Program to incorporate CBT into the V-22 Training System. The depth and range of the CBT used will be determined during the development of production training. Programmatic requirements, such as Continuous Acquisition and Life-Cycle Support and IETMs, will be considered during the development of the training program.\n\n5. Repair Parts. A technical data bank has been established in the V-22 Program for the USMC, USN, and USAF. The range and depth of data will be expanded as the pre-operational support program progresses and transitions to the operational program. The data will be used to develop detailed spares and repair parts requirements. The contractor will initially maintain this data. As the V-22 Program matures, this data bank will transition to the appropriate Inventory Control Point. The Government Support Date is FY04.\n\n6. Human Systems Integration. No Human Systems Integration Plan exists for the V-22 Program, however, the Human Factors Engineering Program will ensure the requirements for operator and maintenance personnel will be integrated into the system design, and that the V-22 will permit maximum effectiveness for the man-machine system. The Human System Integration Plan is designed to ensure human considerations are fully accounted for in the weapon system development. Percentiles are no longer used as a determinant for aircrew personnel. Case 1 through 5 studies are used as the profiles for design. These cases are contained in the aircraft EMD specifications. Maintenance personnel (both male and female) for the V-22 Weapon System must be capable of working between the five to 95 percentile per Military Standard 1472 database.\n\n7. Engineering and Technical Services and/or Advisory Services. The type and number of ETS required will be keyed to aircraft deliveries for each service, maintenance concepts, system complexity, maintenance task times, and frequency and difficulty of repair. ETS personnel will receive formal training and On-the-Job Training (OJT) in theories of operation, troubleshooting, maintenance, and repair of their respective systems. Training and update seminars will be conducted for ETS personnel throughout the program's life-cycle. Using V-22 aircraft maintenance concepts developed that are consistent with OPNAVINST 4790.2 (Series) and AFSOCI 21-106, ETS personnel will be used to provide assistance to receiving activities, depots, and training sites from introduction of the aircraft in calendar year 2000. ETS personnel will provide informal training to maintenance personnel, and support operator training and briefings as required. They can provide instruction, OJT, and support aircraft repair at all levels of maintenance, as required.\n\nK. SCHEDULES. The Marine Corps Initial Operational Capability (IOC) (12 MV-22 fielded) is scheduled for FY01. The Air Force IOC (12 combat coded CV-22s fielded) is scheduled for FY05. The Navy IOC is yet to be determined. More information will be included in updates to this JTSP. An estimated final procurement of 360 aircraft for the Marine Corp is proposed, allowing for a 1.0 percent attrition rate. Tables I-7 and I-8 show aircraft delivery schedules, fulfilling the total operating aircraft requirements of 336.6 aircraft in FY14.\n\nTABLE I-7.
