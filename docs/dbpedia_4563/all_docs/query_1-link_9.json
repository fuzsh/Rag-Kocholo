        "text": "A Marine deployed with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit died of a non-combat related illness in a Portugal hospital, according to WITN.\n\nThe Marine died on October 15th in Lisbon and has been identified as Staff Sgt. Denver Sugano, 32, an aviation quality assurance representative from Beaufort, South Carolina.\n\nSugano recently deployed with the MEU as the flight equipment staff non-commissioned officer-in-charge for the air combat element, who enlisted in July, 2002.\n\n“Staff Sgt. Denver Sugano was a vibrant leader with an infectious personality who was beloved by his Marines and universally respected by those who knew him. VMM-162 (REIN) lost a brother today,” said Lt. Col. Brian T. Koch, commanding officer of VMM-162 (REIN). “We will miss him and he will forever be in our thoughts and serve as an inspiration to each one of us.”"
