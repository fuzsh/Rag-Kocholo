        "text": "Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 161 (VMM-161) is a United States Marine Corps helicopter squadron consisting of MV-22 Osprey transport tiltrotors. The squadron, known as the \"Greyhawks\", is based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 16 (MAG-16) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). The squadron has the distinction of being the first helicopter transport squadron in the World (Ref. Kristy, \"Museum Preserves 60 Years of Marine Corps Rotary Wing Aviation\", Fortitudine, 2007). As of the end of the deployment, the squadron is at a record of over 58,000 class A mishap free flight hours total. This achievement is unable to be surpassed by any other CH-46E squadron due to the fact the new MV-22 Osprey will be replacing the CH-46E, and no other squadron has a record close enough to the Greyhawks' that they would be able to beat it. In December 2009, HMM-161 became the first of ten west coast squadrons to transition to the MV-22 Osprey and changed their name to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 161 during the change of command (Ref. Fuentes, Gidget (Thursday December 17, 2009 16:49:50 EST) & \"First West Coast-based Osprey arrives\". Marine Corps Times.

HMH-363 was deactivated on 10 May 2012 at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay. The squadron was then re-designated MV-22 Osprey and activated as an MV-22B Squadron aboard Marine Corps Air Station Miramar as part of Marine Aircraft Group 16, 3d Marine Air Wing. HMH-363 flew the CH-53D Sea Stallion transport helicopters. The squadron, known as the \"Lucky Red Lions\", is based at Marine Corps Air Facility Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 24 (MAG-24) and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (1st MAW). The squadron provides assault support transport of combat troops, supplies and heavy equipment during expeditionary, joint or combined operations. Be prepared for short-notice, worldwide employment in support of Marine Air-Ground Task Force operations on land and aboard navy ship. Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 363 the \"Lucky Red Lions\", was activated on June 2, 1952, at Marine Corps Air Station Santa Ana, California and was designated the Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron 363 (HMR-363), Marine Aircraft Group 36, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific. It was activated as a result of the demands of the Korean War. Reassigned during January 1953 to Marine Aircraft Group 16, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific. In the 1950s HMH-363 participated in Operation \"Redwing\" (Pacific Ocean Atomic tests), and was one of three squadrons to briefly be designated as \"Reconaissance\" squadrons. The \"Red Lions\" fly the CH-53D at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. Reassigned during July 1953 to Marine Aircraft Group 36, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific. In 1953, the unit flew the Sikorsky HRS-1 and during this period took part in Operation Desert Rock, the first atomic test to use ground troops. Soon thereafter, the squadron became the first West Coast helicopter unit to receive the Sikorsky H-34 helicopter. Reassigned during September 1955 to the 3d Marine Aircarft Wing, Air, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific. Redesignated 31 December 1956 as Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron (Light) 363.

In December 1964, a disastrous flood struck Northern California, and on Christmas Eve, HMM-363 deployed aboard the USS Bennington and rushed northward to the disaster area. The squadron was deployed to Vietnam in August 1965. On September 1, 1965, HMM-363 and engaged in their first combat missions ever. The squadrons initial troop insert was a combined operation with HMM-161 in moving the 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines into a landing zone south of Da Nang. Close ties between HMM-363 and Republic of Korea (ROK) forces were developed in Operation FLYING TIGER. The Tiger Division was airlifted to Hill 78 in conjunction with the operation, which was viewed as the most successful Korean offensive of the war to date.The squadron was also involved with numerous operations, which increased in intensity following the Tet Offensive in early 1968. March 26, 1968 was perhaps the most disastrous day in the history of HMM-363. During a rocket attack, five squadron members were wounded and required medical evacuation. During the flight up the coast of Vietnam, the medevac aircraft lost its engine and crashed killing seven people including the commanding officer. The only survivors were the pilot and co-pilot who managed to escape before the aircraft sank in the coastal waters. On January 23, 1969, the squadron was redeployed back to California and was designated \"Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 363\" (HMH-363) after having received the Sikorsky CH-53A transport helicopter. It served two combat tours in Vietnam, with the UH-34D (1965-66) and the CH-53A (1967-69). In October 1972, the squadron was the first unit to receive the powerful CH-53D. In March 1977, the squadron was selected to participate in the operational evaluation of the USS Tarawa (LHA-1), the first of the new large and modern amphibious ships. In early 1983, the squadron was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation. The Squadron provided relief efforts and humanitarian support in the Philippines following a devastating earthquake and flood in 1990. HMH-363 flew countless missions and over 500 flight hours in 3½ weeks, delivering food, clothing, and shelter to inhabitants living in remote areas of the Philippines. The squadron received the Humanitarian Service Medal for its relief effort. During Desert Shield/Desert Storm, HMH-363 supported the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in Okinawa and returned to California in May 1991, terminating its unit rotations to Okinawa after this eleven month deployment. In December 1992, the squadron participated in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia[1] and was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Commendation and Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. The squadron has also supported Joint Task Force Six at Fort Bliss, Texas. During August 1996, the Red Lions relocated to Marine Corps Air Facility Kaneohe Bay and were reassigned to 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. From late 2006 to early 2007, HMH-363 deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Based at Al Asad, this was the unit's first deployment in support of the Global War on Terror[2][3] During Operation Iraqi Freedom HMH-363 flew 848.8 hours in one month. The squadron deployed again to Al Asad in Summer 2008 to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. They returned to MCB Hawaii in February 2009.
