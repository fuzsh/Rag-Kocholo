EDT October 1, 1980 Statement of the Honorable G. William Miller Secretary of the Treasury before the Joint Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development October 1, 1980 Mr. Chairman, Mr. De Larosiere, Mr. McNamara, Fellow Governors, Distinguished Guests: The Bretton Woods institutions continue to grow in stature and in membership. The People’s Republic of China, representing nearly one-fourth of the world’s population, now participates with us as a fully active partner. Our newest member, which joined yesterday, is Zimbabwe, a nation whose struggle to gain independence and freedom has engaged our high admiration and support. To all those who sit in this assembly for the first time, I offer a special welcome. At the same time that we are welcoming new associates, we will soon be losing the services of Robert McNamara, whose vision, energy and strength of purpose have fashioned the World Bank into a powerful and effective instrument for economic and human development. His performance, through more than a decade of wrenching change and multiplying difficulties for the develop­ ing world, has been magnificent. He deserves, and he has, the enduring gratitude of all mankind for his accomplishments. And he has our heartfelt best wishes for his future endeavors. Bob McNamara has led the World Bank to giant accomplishments, but he is the first to point out the towering challenges ahead. He and Jacques de Larosiere have detailed for us a sobering outlook for the world’s economy and people. Their perspective is not seriously contested by any of us. Together our nations face a formidable collection of problems. — First and foremost, persistent inflationary pressures. — Weak economic growth. — Low productivity improvement, and capital stocks threatened with obsolescence by world energy developments. M-584 https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -2- — High, in many cases rising, unemployment. — Sharply higher oil import bills, which siphon funds from investment, development and growth to pay for essential energy imports. — Massive payments imbalances and financing needs. The difficult global energy situation is a factor in all these problems. And it will not cure itself. After the oil price increases in 1973/74, the world failed to adjust sufficiently to the new situation. Instead, oil demand was temporarily reduced by a global recession. Thereafter, the oil-importing world to a large extent succeeded in financing a continuing high level of consumption, but it did not put in place the new investment needed to reduce dependence on imported oil. In many cases, the hope seemed to be that the oil and financing problems were temporary and could be resolved without fundamental changes. Indeed, there appeared to be some success, as for a brief time world inflation receded, economic activity recovered, and payments imbalances narrowed. But a second round of massive oil price increases beginning early last year brought a renewal of the earlier difficulties. The new shock compounds the problems for a world economy already beset by strong underlying inflationary pressures and laboring under heavy external debt burdens accumulated during the 1970’s. There is no prospect of avoiding repeated oil shocks unless the oil-importing world recognized and adjusts deliberately to a radically altered global economic and energy balance. The required adjustments involve both energy conservation and development of new energy sources. But they must also encompass measures to stimulate investment and productivity in circum­ stances of greatly increased energy costs. And they must be carried out in an environment of financial stability within individual national economies, to facilitate movement of resources to more productive sectors and to ensure continued flows of external financing. We look to the oil-exporting nations to follow responsible price and production policies. And each nation represented here must face and act upon the need for internal adjustment. Many have done so. Most have at least started the process. None, including the United States, has yet done enough to assure its satisfactory completion. The United States is taking strong steps to reduce oil imports, to control inflation and to improve productivity. A broad array of policies — most importantly, decontrol of domestic oil and natural gas prices — has been marshalled to encourage energy conservation and stimulate domestic energy production. Principally as a result of these efforts, U. S. oil https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -3- imports are about 25 percent below the average of 1977, the peak year. This reduction is primarily the result of improved efficiency in energy use, not reduced economic activity. The amount of energy needed to produce a unit of national output has been lowered by about 10 percent since 1973. The United States continues to pursue fiscal and monetary policies designed to limit and then reduce inflation. In addition, the President has recently proposed measures to increase the share of national output devoted to investment. Our efforts to reduce oil imports and strengthen the U. S. economy have supported a welcome improvement in our external accounts. They have also provided a firm basis for stability and strength of the dollar on the exchange markets. We must all recognize that our individual efforts form part of a collective international response that ultimately can succeed only if it is coordinated and cooperative. The Bretton Woods institutions originated as just such a cooperative effort. Their task was to guide the world economy from the devastation of World War II, and their success was remarkable. In subsequent decades they have adapted flexibly and imaginatively to changing needs and circumstances. But a major test lies ahead. As we enter a new decade, we must again call upon these institutions for guidance through a difficult and dangerous period. A world accustomed to strong growth and rising living standards now faces the prospect of a decade in which performance may fall short of expectations and aspirations. Large persistent imbalances in international payments are likely. And the associated financing requirements are huge. In 1980 alone, the aggregate of current account deficits that need to be financed could reach $150 billion. In light of these prospects the Fund and Bank face a complementary task: the Fund to assure a judicious blend of financing and adjustment? and the Bank to assist in restructuring economies to permit development to continue as rapidly as possible. Let me outline the United States' view of the roles of each of these institutions. The International Monetary Fund Looking ahead, the Fund faces truly awesome tasks. It must oversee the operation of the international monetary system at a time when pressures on that system are severe. It must encourage each member toward policies for orderly growth and price stability, in a period when the attainment of those goals is more difficult than ever before. It must see that nations follow exchange rate policies compatible with their international obligations, under conditions of enormous global payments imbalances and great uncertainty. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -4- No one expects the Fund to fulfill these responsibilities to perfection. Our knowledge and foresight are imperfect. The Fund's authority over sovereign members is circumscribed. Its tools are limited. But we must make sure that the Fund — the international community operating collectively — is in a position to make a maximum effort. Its approach must be right, its advice sound, its resources adequate. And we must keep in mind the longer-term objective of international cooperation: in designing our approach to immediate and pressing problems, we must not lose sight of the broad goals we have set for the evolution of the international monetary system. Let me state my message plainly: the Fund's main job will be to encourage the appropriate blend of adjustment and financing by member nations; to facilitate forms of adjustment and financing that are most supportive of a strong world economy; and to continue progress toward the kind of international monetary system we need for a secure and prosperous future. That means improving the Fund's ability to provide financing to those countries undertaking difficult adjustment efforts. It means a greater role for the SDR and progress toward an SDRcentered international monetary system. And it means improving IMF surveillance over members' policies. In the past several months, discussion has focused on the role of the Fund in meeting prospective financing needs and in supporting the efforts of individual nations to come to grips with adjustment problems. In Hamburg last spring, the Interim Committee endorsed in broad terms the view that the Fund should be prepared to play a much larger role in adjustment and financing. The Executive Board has worked hard to define that role in the design of adjustment programs and the expansion of members' access to Fund resources. Clearly, present circum­ stances call for adjustment programs with a longer-term orientation than in the past. Larger amounts of Fund resources will need to be committed to countries adopting such programs over a longer period of time. The United States strongly endorses the results of the Board's work and urges its early implementation. The Fund is presently in a satisfactory position to meet expanded calls on its resources. I am particularly pleased that the Congress has just completed final action on authorizing U. S. participation in the seventh quota increase. We will work with the Congress to complete the appropriation process, so that the general quota increase — which totals about $25 billion — can take effect at a very early date. This will be a welcome and needed addition to the Fund's resources. We are all agreed that quotas must remain the basic source of IMF financing. But potential demands on the IMF are substantial. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -5As a precaution, the Managing Director has already begun to explore the possibility of IMF borrowing from surplus countries to supplement the Fund's resources in case of need. We should also consider other prospects. The time has come for a careful examination by the Fund of the possibility of borrowing from private sources. A number of technical and legal questions must be reviewed, and there are factors that may limit the IMF's recourse to the private markets, at least over the short run. But Fund borrowing from the capital markets on a moderate scale may prove to be desirable, and I urge that the necessary preparatory work to be initiated promptly. IMF borrowing from the private markets would be fully in line with the effort to enhance the role of the SDR in the interna­ tional monetary system. We welcome the recent decision by the Executive Board to adopt a five-currency basket as the uniform basis for both valuation of the SDR and calculation of the SDR interest rate. This will provide an SDR that is more compact and understandable, easier to trade and work with in foreign exchange and capital markets, but still a reserve asset that is interna­ tionally backed and representative of a large segment of the world economy. We should go farther, and consider other steps to promote the role of the SDR in the system. The Executive Board has been examining the question of SDR allocations for next year and the fourth basic period, beginning in 1982. Clearly, there have been major developments in the world economy since the decision was taken in 1978 on allocations for the three years ending in 1981. But in my view, the most effective approach to expanding the SDR's role is a relatively steady expansion of allocations, from basic period to basic period as the world economy grows. We are not persuaded that an effort to \"fine tune\" a single year's allocation would be appropriate or consistent with our view of the longer-term evolution of the SDR’s role. It is of paramount importance that we develop the credibility and reliability of the SDR as a reserve asset. We should not give the impression of tinkering with it. We will look toward a careful analysis by the Managing Director and the Executive Board of the question of allocations in the next basic period, and will consider positively a proposal by the Managing Director next spring. The yield on the SDR has an important bearing on attitudes toward acceptance of the asset and decisions on allocations. The rate of interest on the SDR has been increased by a substantial amount over the years. I believe that it would be useful to raise further the rate of interest on the SDR, to the full market level, in order to enhance the attractiveness and therefore the usability of the asset. At the same time, we should raise the rate of remuneration to 80 percent of the full market SDR rate and eliminate the remaining residual SDR \"reconstitution\" https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -6- obligation. Market-oriented characteristics and elimination of encumbrances can only enhance the usability and attractiveness of the SDR. The prospect of IMF borrowing from the private markets raises in concrete terms the possibility of greater private use of SDR-denorainated assets. From a longer-term perspective, we urge the Executive Board to initiate a study of other measures that might be taken to expand the use of SDR-denominated instruments by the private sector. As the private market in SDR's develops and takes hold, we propose that the World Bank give consideration to borrowing in the form of SDR-denominated securities and lending correspondingly in SDR terms, both as a means of giving further impetus to the instrument and as a technique of moderating exchange risk for the Bank's borrowers. As another step toward expanding the role of the SDR, we urge the Executive Board to continue its work on the concept of a substitution account, which I believe would be better named a \"Monetary Reserve Account.\" We should not be surprised that the development of this idea takes considerable time. The SDR itself took years to define and introduce. The steps I have mentioned today can, together make a useful contribution to strengthening the SDR and promoting its use as a respected and effective international monetary instrument. The United States has also given attention to the renewed suggestions that a link be established between the creation of Special Drawing Rights and the provision of development assistance — a so-called SDR-aid link. Our view remains that the establishment of the proposed link would be harmful to what we regard as the fundamental objective — to develop the SDR's role as an important monetary instrument and promote orderly evolution of the international monetary system. As the Fund carries out its expanded responsibilities in the current situation, we believe it important that it give renewed attention to strengthening its role in surveillance over the international monetary system and the policies of member countries. The United States has suggested a number of steps that could be taken toward this end. For example: — It seems to us natural that, in seeking to promote greater symmetry of adjustment responsibilities, the Fund should seek adjustment policy statements and analyses from any country experiencing large imbalance, whether surplus or deficit. — We have suggested that the policies and performance of individual countries be assessed against a broadly agreed global economic framework. — We believe the Managing Director should be invited to take the initiative in consulting members where he has concerns about the appropriateness of their policies. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -7The Executive Board has made some progress in developing its surveillance procedures over the past year. But that progress has been disappointingly modest. We all seem to agree that effective surveillance is the essence of a smoothly functioning international monetary system. Yet, I have noticed that many who are critical of the system are the most resistant to the develop­ ment of surveillance which is at the heart of its effectiveness. The world faces extraordinary economic and financial problems and challenges. The Fund is at the center of our response. Its ability is proven. Its resources are expanding. Its policies are being adapted to changing needs. Its objectives and purposes have been endorsed by every country represented here. We have endorsed a global strategy based on the IMF's financing and adjustment policies. Now we must make it work. I urge all member nations to help the Fund give substance to its agreed role in overseeing the operations of a sound international monetary system. The World Bank The Welfare of the developing countries and the immense problems which they confront are of paramount concern to the United States. We recognize fully the urgency of today's development needs. The Commission chaired by Chancellor Brandt has properly stressed the common interest of both industrialized and developing nations in meeting global economic problems, including the need for equitable growth in developing countries. Progress in the developing nations is essential to the health of the.global economy as a whole. It is for these reasons that the United States is so strongly committed to the work of the World Bank. Over the past 35 years, the Bank has made great strides as a project financer, financial catalyst, and institution builder. The Bank has pioneered efforts to speed human capital formation and has been in the forefront of efforts directly to reduce poverty. Bank operations have contributed enormously to development, and the Bank is now clearly established as the leader of the international community's efforts to address development concerns. The record for developing countries since the Eank was established shows clear progress. Quality of life standards have shown significant improvement. Average per capita income has approximately doubled in real terms since 1960. Yet formidable development challenges remain. Absolute poverty is pervasive. Serious, widespread deficiencies remain in health and nutrition, literacy and education, life expectancy, and in the overall physical and social environment. Population growth continues to add to the already immense problems of unemployment and underemployment. Rural to urban migration has fueled a rapid increase in the numbers of urban poor. In addition, there is the continuing https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -8- critical need of low income countries — with large numbers of rural poor and heavy reliance on agriculture — to improve the productivity of the small farmer. These serious development problems have been compounded by world economic conditions. Surging oil prices, worldwide inflation, slower growth in the industrial countries, and constraints on access to external capital have combined to cast a long shadow over development prospects for the 1980’s. In the difficult decade ahead, it is of vital importance that the Bank remain at the forefront of global efforts to deal imaginatively with the changed economic situation. For its part, the United States will continue to support and encourage those adaptations in the Bank lending which effectively meet the evolving needs of the developing countries and strengthen their capacity for further growth and development. We attach great importance to the Bank's existing plans to lend approximately $14 billion for energy development projects in oil-importing developing countries through 1985. We strongly support the Bank's search for additional ways to further expand energy development in its borrowing countries, including the possibility of an energy facility or affiliate which would consolidate and enhance the Bank's activities in this field. The United States strongly applauds the Bank's new program to support \"structural adjustment.\" It is a necessary response to altered global economic conditions and a radically changed world energy balance. The bank's structural adjustment loans, coordinated closely with the IMF, will serve as a catalyst for growth and help strengthen the recycling process. It is particularly appropriate for the World Bank to undertake this critical program because of its sound reputation, expertise, and long experience with the sectoral issues that are fundamental to any restructuring. We appreciate the 1980 World Development Report's analysis of the relationship between population and other aspects of human resource development and economic growth. We look forward to increased Bank lending in the population area in coming years. The Bank's record of solid achievement in maximizing project benefits for the poor should be maintained and the share of its lending allocated to the poorer borrowing countries should be increased. This is vitally important given the unacceptably high level of absolute poverty and the value — so impressively highlighted in the 1980 World Development Report — of human development as a tool of growth. Bank Financing The United States and other Bank members have a vital interest in encouraging effective responses by the Bank to critical world needs. It is thus of great common concern to note that the needs of the developing countries are — for the reasons highlighted in Bob McNamara's address — growing more rapidly https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -9- than anticipated. Fortunately, we have already negotiated both a General Capital Increase for the World Bank and a Sixth Replen­ ishment of IDA'S resources. The United States fully supports both the GCI and IDA VI. We hope to have legislative approval for U. S. participation in IDA VI before the end of this session of Congress. U. S. partici­ pation in the GCI will be the principal element of next year's funding request to Congress. The agreed General Capital Increase of $40 billion — increasing World Bank capital from $45 billion — and the $12 billion IDV VI Replenishment should meet developing countrv needs for Bank financing over the next few years. We therefore will have time to assess carefully how best to finance the needs of the developing countries beyond these replenishments. The United States is prepared to join other members to look at alternative ways to help support bank operations. Any reassessment of Bank financing must, of course, be done thoughtfully and deliberately, with due regard for the needs of developing countries, the need to maintain the high quality of lending standards, and the impact of future financing on the capital structure of the Bank. We are also willing to join with others in a serious effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of both bilateral and multilateral concessional assistance, including channelling an increasing share to the poorest developing countries. We will also work to find practical ways ourselves to increase both the quality and quantity of such assistance. Bank/Fund Collaboration There is one additional area where I think there is a need for innovation: that is in the collaboration between the Fund and the World Bank. When we established these twin institutions in 1946, the world was different, and the functions of the Fund and Bank were clearly separated and defined. Now the problems of short-term adjustment and the problems of development have become more intertwined, and the activities of the Fund and the Bank'are focusing more on common problems. Both developing and industrial countries have learned that an effective program of adjustment to achieve the multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives of economic policy requires attention to both demand management and the supply side of the equation. Over the years since Bretton Woods, the Fund has worked with its members in the design of demand management policies to achieve economic stabilization. The Bank has focused on the supply side in its effort to promote growth through development of sound investment strategies. In the years ahead, https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -10it is essential that the unique capabilities of these two institutions be brought to bear in a complementary and positive manner to assist countries in their adjustment efforts. The Bank and Fund should be prepared to collaborate with one another to assist member countries in assessing their economic prospects, developing effective economic programs and providing appropriate financing. At the same time, it is also essential that the Fund and the Bank remain as autonomous institutions with distinct functions and purposes. I know that the staffs of these two institutions have made significant strides in collaborating on adjustment programs in specific countries. At this stage, I think it would be useful to review what has been accomplished, with a view to improving the form and substance of this collaboration in the future. This review might best be undertaken under the auspices of a joint committee of the Executive Boards, supported by the staffs of both institutions. Effective collaboration between these two institutions will help ensure their continued responsiveness to the changing needs of the world economy. We also urge consideration of steps to assure proper coordination of the borrowing policies of the two institutions. The prospect that both could be borrowing in world capital markets in the same time frame suggests the need for specific steps to assure a smooth coordination of those activities. Conclusion The record clearly shows that the Fund and the Bank have demonstrated repeatedly their capacity to evolve, adapt and respond flexibly during periods of major economic and financial strian. The institutions work efficiently and well. They deal in realities, and give practical content to the high objectives set forth in their Articles. But their ability to continue to perform their indispensable tasks depends on the commitment of their members to maintaining their integrity and competence and to avoiding injection of political issues into their work. Difficult problems and challenges confront us. The Bretton Woods institutions are the central focus of our collective effort to meet those challenges successfully and cooperatively. The United States pledges its vigorous support to the Fund and Bank as they address the tasks before them. With the support of other nations represented here today, I am confident that lasting success will be achieved. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 0OO0 , DeparlmentoftheTREASURY ■ WASHINGTON, D.C. 20220 TELEPHONE 566-2041 FOR RELEASE AT 11:00 A.M.

A number of technical and legal questions must be reviewed, and there are factors that may limit the IMF's recourse to the private markets, at least over the short run. But Fund borrowing from the capital markets on a moderate scale may prove to be desirable, and I urge that the necessary preparatory work to be initiated promptly. IMF borrowing from the private markets would be fully in line with the effort to enhance the role of the SDR in the interna­ tional monetary system. We welcome the recent decision by the Executive Board to adopt a five-currency basket as the uniform basis for both valuation of the SDR and calculation of the SDR interest rate. This will provide an SDR that is more compact and understandable, easier to trade and work with in foreign exchange and capital markets, but still a reserve asset that is interna­ tionally backed and representative of a large segment of the world economy. We should go farther, and consider other steps to promote the role of the SDR in the system. The Executive Board has been examining the question of SDR allocations for next year and the fourth basic period, beginning in 1982. Clearly, there have been major developments in the world economy since the decision was taken in 1978 on allocations for the three years ending in 1981. But in my view, the most effective approach to expanding the SDR's role is a relatively steady expansion of allocations, from basic period to basic period as the world economy grows. We are not persuaded that an effort to \"fine tune\" a single year’s allocation would be appropriate or consistent with our view of the longer-term evolution of the SDR’s role. It is of paramount importance that we develop the credibility and reliability of the SDR as a reserve asset. We should not give the impression of tinkering with it. We will look toward a careful analysis by the Managing Director and the Executive Board of the question of allocations in the next basic period, and will consider positively a proposal by the Managing Director next spring. The yield on the SDR has an important bearing on attitudes toward acceptance of the asset and decisions on allocations. The rate of interest on the SDR has been increased by a substantial amount over the years. I believe that it would be useful to raise further the rate of interest on the SDR, to the full market level, in order to enhance the attractiveness and therefore the usability of the asset. At the same time, we should raise the rate of remuneration to 80 percent of the full market SDR rate and eliminate the remaining residual SDR \"reconstitution\" https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -6obligation. Market-oriented characteristics and elimination of encumbrances can only enhance the usability and attractiveness of the SDR. The prospect of IMF borrowing from the private markets raises in concrete terms the possibility of greater private use of SDR-denominated assets. From a longer-term perspective, we urge the Executive Board to initiate a study of other measures that might be taken to expand the use of SDR-denominated instruments by the private sector. As the private market in SDR's develops and takes hold, we propose that the World Bank give consideration to borrowing in the form of SDR-denominated securities and lending correspondingly in SDR terms, both as a means of giving further impetus to the instrument and as a technique of moderating exchange risk for the Bank's borrowers. As another step toward expanding the role of the SDR, we urge the Executive Board to continue its work on the concept of a substitution account, which I believe would be better named a \"Monetary Reserve Account.\" We should not be surprised that the development of this idea takes considerable time. The SDR itself took years to define and introduce. The steps I have mentioned today can, together make a useful contribution to strengthening the SDR and promoting its use as a respected and effective international monetary instrument. The United States has also given attention to the renewed suggestions that a link be established between the creation of Special Drawing Rights and the provision of development assistance — a so-called SDR-aid link. Our view remains that the establishment of the proposed link would be harmful to what we regard as the fundamental objective — to develop the SDR's role as an important monetary instrument and promote orderly evolution of the international monetary system. As the Fund carries out its expanded responsibilities in the current situation, we believe it important that it give renewed attention to strengthening its role in surveillance over the international monetary system and the policies of member countries. The United States has suggested a number of steps that could be taken toward this end. For example: — It seems to us natural that, in seeking to promote greater symmetry of adjustment responsibilities, the Fund should seek adjustment policy statements and analyses from any country experiencing large imbalance, whether surplus or deficit. — We have suggested that the policies and performance of individual countries be assessed against a broadly agreed global economic framework. — We believe the Managing Director should be invited to take the initiative in consulting members where he has concerns about the appropriateness of their policies. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -7- » The Executive Board has made some progress in developing its surveillance procedures over the past year. But that progress has been disappointingly modest. We all seem to agree that effective surveillance is the essence of a smoothly functioning international monetary system. Yet, I have noticed that many who are critical of the system are the most resistant to the develop­ ment of surveillance which is at the heart of its effectiveness. The world faces extraordinary economic and financial problems and challenges. The Fund is at the center of our response. Its ability is proven. Its resources are expanding. Its policies are being adapted to changing needs. Its objectives and purposes have been endorsed by every country represented here. We have endorsed a global strategy based on the IMF's financing and adjustment policies. Now we must make it work. I urge all member nations to help the Fund give substance to its agreed role in overseeing the operations of a sound international monetary system. The World Bank The Welfare of the developing countries and the immense problems which they confront are of paramount concern to the United States. We recognize fully the urgency of today's development needs. The Commission chaired by Chancellor Brandt has properly stressed the common interest of both industrialized and developing nations in meeting global economic problems, including the need for equitable growth in developing countries. Progress in the developing nations is essential to the health of the.global economy as a whole. It is for these reasons that the United States is so strongly committed to the work of the World Bank. Over the past 35 years, the Bank has made great strides as a project financer, financial catalyst, and institution builder. The Bank has pioneered efforts to speed human capital formation and has been in the forefront of efforts directly to reduce poverty. Bank operations have contributed enormously to development, and the Bank is now clearly established as the leader of the international community's efforts to address development concerns. The record for developing countries since the Bank was established shows clear progress. Quality of life standards have shown significant improvement. Average per capita income has approximately doubled in real terms since 1960. Yet formidable development challenges remain. Absolute poverty is pervasive. Serious, widespread deficiencies remain in health and nutrition, literacy and education, life expectancy, and in the overall physical and social environment. Population growth continues to add to the already immense problems of unemployment and underemployment. Rural to urban migration has fueled a rapid increase in the numbers of urban poor. In addition, there is the continuing https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -8- critical need of low income countries — with large numbers of rural poor and heavy reliance on agriculture — to improve the productivity of the small farmer. These serious development problems have been compounded by world economic conditions. Surging oil prices, worldwide inflation, slower growth in the industrial countries, and constraints on access to external capital have combined to cast a long shadow over development prospects for the 1980's. In the difficult decade ahead, it is of vital importance that the Bank remain at the forefront of global efforts to deal imaginatively with the changed economic situation. For its part, the United States will continue to support and encourage those adaptations in the Bank lending which effectively meet the evolving needs of the developing countries and strengthen their capacity for further growth and development. We attach great importance to the Bank’s existing plans to lend approximately $14 billion for energy development projects in oil-importing developing countries through 1985. We strongly support the Bank’s search for additional ways to further expand energy development in its borrowing countries, including the possibility of an energy facility or affiliate which would consolidate and enhance the Bank's activities in this field. The United States strongly applauds the Bank's new program to support \"structural adjustment.\" It is a necessary response to altered global economic conditions and a radically changed world energy balance. The bank's structural adjustment loans, coordinated closely with the IMF, will serve as a catalyst for growth and help strengthen the recycling process. It is particularly appropriate for the World Bank to undertake this critical program because of its sound reputation, expertise, and long experience with the sectoral issues that are fundamental to any restructuring. We appreciate the 1980 World Development Report's analysis of the relationship between population and other aspects of human resource development and economic growth. We look forward to increased Bank lending in the population area in coming years. The Bank's record of solid achievement in maximizing project benefits for the poor should be maintained and the share of its lending allocated to the poorer borrowing countries should be increased. This is vitally important given the unacceptably high level of absolute poverty and the value — so impressively highlighted in the 1980 World Development Report — of human development as a tool of growth. Bank Financing The United States and other Bank members have a vital interest in encouraging effective responses by the Bank to critical world needs. It is thus of great common concern to note that the needs of the developing countries are — for the reasons highlighted in Bob McNamara's address — growing more rapidly https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -9- than anticipated. Fortunately, we have already negotiated both a General Capital Increase for the World Bank and a Sixth Replen­ ishment of IDA'S resources. The United States fully supports both the GCI and IDA VI. We hope to have legislative approval for U. S. participation in IDA VI before the end of this session of Congress. U. S. partici­ pation in the GCI will be the principal element of next year's funding request to Congress. The agreed General Capital Increase of $40 billion — increasing World Bank capital from $45 billion — and the $12 billion IDV VI Replenishment should meet developing country needs for Bank financing over the next few years. We therefore will have time to assess carefully how best to finance the needs of the developing countries beyond these replenishments. The United States is prepared to join other members to look at alternative ways to help support bank operations. Any reassessment of Bank financing must, of course, be done thoughtfully and deliberately, with due regard for the needs of developing countries, the need to maintain the high quality of lending standards, and the impact of future financing on the capital structure of the Bank. We are also willing to join with others in a serious effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of both bilateral and multilateral concessional assistance, including channelling an increasing share to the poorest developing countries. We will also work to find practical ways ourselves to increase both the quality and quantity of such assistance. Bank/Fund Collaboration There is one additional area where I think there is a need for innovation: that is in the collaboration between the Fund and the World Bank. When we established these twin institutions in 1946, the world was different, and the functions of the Fund and Bank were clearly separated and defined. Now the problems of short-term adjustment and the problems of development have become more intertwined, and the activities of the Fund and the Bank‘are focusing more on common problems. Both developing and industrial countries have learned that an effective program of adjustment to achieve the multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives of economic policy requires attention to both demand management and the supply side of the equation. Over the years since Bretton Woods, the Fund has worked with its members in the design of demand management policies to achieve economic stabilization. The Bank has focused on the supply side in its effort to promote growth through development of sound investment strategies. In the years ahead, https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis -10it is essential that the unique capabilities of these two institutions be brought to bear in a complementary and positive manner to assist countries in their adjustment efforts. The Bank and Fund should be prepared to collaborate with one another to assist member countries in assessing their economic prospects, developing effective economic programs and providing appropriate financing. At the same time, it is also essential that the Fund and the Bank remain as autonomous institutions with distinct functions and purposes. I know that the staffs of these two institutions have made significant strides in collaborating on adjustment programs in specific countries. At this stage, I think it would be useful to review what has been accomplished, with a view to improving the form and substance of this collaboration in the future. This review might best be undertaken under the auspices of a joint committee of the Executive Boards, supported by the staffs of both institutions. Effective collaboration between these two institutions will help ensure their continued responsiveness to the changing needs of the world economy. We also urge consideration of steDS to assure proper coordination of the borrowing policies of the two institutions. The prospect that both could be borrowing in world capital markets in the same time frame suggests the need for specific steps to assure a smooth coordination of those activities. Conclusion The record clearly shows that the Fund and the Bank have demonstrated repeatedly their capacity to evolve, adapt and respond flexibly during periods of major economic and financial strian. The institutions work efficiently and well. They deal in realities, and give practical content to the high objectives set forth in their Articles. But their ability to continue to perform their indispensable tasks depends on the commitment of their members to maintaining their integrity and competence and to avoiding injection of political issues into their work. Difficult problems and challenges confront us. The Bretton Woods institutions are the central focus of our collective effort to meet those challenges successfully and cooperatively. The United States pledges its vigorous support to the Fund and Bank as they address the tasks before them. With the support of other nations represented here today, I am confident that lasting success will be achieved. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 0OO0 I?

The asterisk to the left of an individual’s name indicates that he or she will attend. The individuals attending represent the major/clearing house institutions in the US, UK, Germany, Japan, France, Switzerland, and Canada. In addition, we have included two Italian financiers whose participation was requested by Governor Garrahy and Mr. Allan Alperen. The participants have been divided up so that we have a complete representation of all countries at each of the two sessions. When I canvassed earlier this week for additional names recommended by Treasury staff, Roger Altman suggested several additional smaller German banks who had been helpful with our Carter bond sales. After totalling up the attendance for each day, counting only major insitutions, these additional German banks resulted in a heavy German attendance and pushed overall invited guests over 16 per day. Instead of including them in the private sessions, I have extended on your behalf invitations to your reception. If you w\"buld prefer to invite them to the private meetings as well, however, please let me know and I will extend an invitation. Overall the response to the invitations has been enthusiastic, particularly among the foreign bankers. (Tom Clausen had instructed his staff to clear his calendar to accommodate this meeting. He will be attending on Wednesday afternoon.)

Welcome. Always enjoy my discussions with banking community. Believe exchange of views helpful. Your actions/decisions over next few years will be major determinate of economic outlook. 2. would like to take a few minutes to provide the U.S. perspective on the economic situation and then open the meeting for discussion. Will of course be happy to respond to any questions. U.S. Economy 3. Let me bring you up to date on the U.S. economy. Latest indicators provide mounting evidence that our economy is turning around. May turn out that July was low point for economy. Unemployment rate fell in August, payroll employment rose, and range of other labor market indicators strengthened. Housing and autos suffered the sharpest declines earlier in year and both have rebounded. Housing starts in August were 33 percent above the second quarter average. Domestic auto sales have been running about 25 percent above the second quarter. Inventories have been closely aligned with sales and threat of cumulative downturn new lies behind us. 4. Number of problem areas persist and we are likely to see a more moderate recovery than has historically been our experience. — Foremost among these problems is the continuing high underlying rate of inflation. Recent price signals have been mixed. Consumer prices have risen at only a 4 percent annual rate in the last two months because of the heavy influence of mortgage interest rates in the index. Food prices recently have been a dominating adverse factor in the wholesale price area, but those pressures are new receding. Abstracting from these temporary influences, the underlying rate of inflation probably remains near 10 percent. Growth in wage rates has not shown much effect from the slowdown, although there are lags in the process. Productivity gains should pick up somewhat as growth resumes, but a serious inflation problem remains. 5. We recognize that we must maintain moderate fiscal and monetary policies in face of the continuing high underlying inflation rate. And more generally, we must shift resources toward business capital formation. The major thrust of the Administration's revitalization program is to increase capital invest­ ment and to raise productivity. 6. Our outlook is that the U.S. current account will record balance or a small surplus this year, and a modest surplus next year. 7. A U.S. current account surplus should be viewed against the deficits and downward pressures on dollar of only a fav years ago. Think most would https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis - 2 agree that, given the dollar's continuing large role in international financ­ ing, a relatively strong U.S. current account position is a broadly stabilizing factor in the system and will contribute to continued smooth operation of inter­ national markets. World Econcmy 8. Turning to world econcmy, picture is not very encouraging. problems. We face serious — World econcmy is recovering very tentatively from the oil price shocks of 1979-80. But the recovery is tenuous. . only modest real growth prospects for industrial countries and a slowing of growth in larger LDCs . high rates of inflation only slower modestly . disturbingly large imbalances in global current accounts, with less developed countries facing substantial financ­ ing needs. Growth 9. Outlook for this year and next is for weak world economic growth. — During second and third quarters of this year, no growth took place in industrial world. U.S. in particular experienced very sharp downturn. — We expect only one percent growth in the OECD area for year as whole. The major countries are projected to experience negative growth over course of year (4th/4th). — Next year real GNP should expand 1-1/2 to 2 percent. 10. have Have have Recent growth experience for non-oil LDC has been relatively good. LDCs maintained real growth rates only 1 percent below historic average. maintained solid growth throughout 1970s while the industrial countries suffered periods of deep recession. Inflation 11. The recorded experience on inflation rates suggests we may have passed the peak last spring when OECD wide inflation averaged almost 14 percent. — It appears that the earlier oil price increases were embodied in domestic price increases fairly rapidly. — In addition, the exceptionally non-acccnmodative monetary and fiscal policies followed in OECD countries are apparently holding down price increases in non-oil sectors. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis - 3 - 12. With half the year behind us, we new must assume that double digit inflation will be recorded for 1980 as a whole. — Major industrial countries are projected to experience nearly 12 percent inflation this year and the total OECD area will see rates almost as high. — Next year we expect sane easing in average inflation, but rates will still remain unacceptably high. 13. Widespread agreement that focus of policy must remain on anti-inflation. Interim Committee ccmmunique already acknowledged need to continue firm policy stance. Energy Consumption 14. Since petroleum price developments have played a role in grewth of infla­ tion performance, would like to focus for a moment on industrial country oil imports. We always hear that oil importers aren't doing enough to reduce energy consumption. But facts are different. — The volume of industrial country oil imports was lower in the first half of 1980 than at any other time since 1973. In fact, imports were 2.9 mb/d less than in 1973 — a reduction of 11 percent. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 4 15. Am particularly proud of U.S. performance. Our cost has jumped from $8 billion to $84 billion. But the value of oil imports has been falling for the past two years. Through August, oil imports were 18 percent below last year’s pace. Latest three months (June-August) imports were about 30 percent below the average for 1977, the peak year. U.S. domestic consumption so far this year is eight percent below a year earlier. These numbers represent a continuation of strong conservation trends since 1978. Last year oil consumption was down two percent from peak 1977 levels. Balance of Payments 16. Dramatic changes in world economy best illustrated by global current account developments. In 1978, the world had returned to historically normal pattern of current account balances. Surplus in industrial world, deficits in LDC area. Last year oil price increases altered picture abruptly as OPEC surplus returned; OECD area swung into deficit; and LDC deficits grew larger. Extent of imbalances is worsening this years as OPEC surplus likely to hit something like $110 billion 17. OPEC surplus will recede only modestly next year. Industrial country aggregate position should improve as OPEC’s surplus moderates. But unlike experience of 1974/75 when OECD swung into surplus, the deficit seems unlikely to be eliminated for several years. Non-oil LDCs’ deficits may widen further. 18. Distribution of net financing requirements will be stabilizing influence on capital and exchange markets this year and next. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 5 Major industrial countries will likely account for about 60 percent of total OECD deficits in 1980. Acceptance of large -- $50 billion -- deficit by stronger countries provides time for other oil importers to begin adjusting to new energy environment. In 1981 more than half of projected industrial country deficits will be borne by these stronger countries. Also expect stabilizing effect from the distribution of imbalance among major countries. U.S. will likely see small surplus next year, while others remain in deficit. Should result in strong dollar, quiet exchange market conditions. 19. Distribution of deficits among non-oil LDCs is less encouraging. Major share (more than 62 percent) of total deficits in 1971 was carried by larger, privately financed LDCs Their re course to private financial markets enabled continued strong real growth to be recorded. Projections indicate that the share carried by these major LDCs will fall modestly in 198TT 20. Result is larger burden -- both percentage and absolute dollars -- will be carried by weaker LDCs -- those which historically have relied on official sources of finance to cover deficits, Points to need for increase in official financing. Need to increase direct bilateral assistance IBRD/IMF lending aid. 21. We continue to believe that the global financing situation is manageable in the near-term though there will be specific problem cases. But current evidence on private market borrowings suggests that a shift toward shorter-term credits is taking place, which will adversely affect debt maturity profiles. The IMF and the World Bank are moving to expand their roles in the recycling process, and this can be a critical supportive step. But the overall effort will still depend very much on the private sector, and a reading of private sector attitudes will be extremely useful in shaping our approach in the institutions. Role of the IFIs 22. The international financial institutions -- the IMF and the World Bank -- are in the forefront of efforts to deal with current economic problems. The tasks of the institutions are complementary. The Fund to provide a blend of balance of payments financing and adjustment. The World Bank to assist developing countries to restructure their economies to permit development to proceed as rapidly as possible. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 6 23. The IMF is positioning itself to play a potentially major role in the financing and adjustment of payments imbalances. At its recent meeting, the Interim Committee endorsed a broad range of proposals by the Executive Board including: Increased access to IMF resources, which will enable members to obtain up to 600 percent of quota in Fund financing over a three year period; six times the amount available only a few years ago. Lengthening adjustment periods to three years or more in some cases, which would contribute to a more gradual, less disruptive and more politically acceptable pace of adjustment. Increased emphasis on supply side considerations in order to promote the savings, i nvestment, import replacement and exports needed for adjustment to the new energy realities. 24. These measures represent an impressive response to a difficult situation and is the most important contribution which the Fund can make to maintaining a sound world economy 25. The IMF is presently in a strong position to meet expanded calls on its resources and will receive a further injection of funds from the quota increase. The Congress is in its final stages of consideration of legislation increasing the U.S. quota in the Fund and we are hopeful that final action can be completed shortly. 26. There is general agreement that quotas must remain the basic source of IMF financing. But potential demands on IMF resources are substantial. As a precaution, the Managing Director has been exploring the possibility of IMF borrowing from major surplus countries to supplement the Fund’s resources in case of need. The Interim Committee has also suggested that consideration be given to the possibility of the IMF’s borrowing from private markets. 27. The possibility of IMF borrowing from private markets raises the prospect of greater private use of SDR-denominated assets. In this context, the decision to adopt a five currency basket for SDR valuation should greatly simplify the SDR and facilitate its use. The IMF Executive Board will be studying further steps to promote the role of the SDR including raising the SDR interest rate to the full market value, eliminating the residual reconstitution https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis - 7 - requirement, and resuming discussions on the international monetary reserve account (i.e., the so-called substitution account.) 28. Finally, consideration is being given to further allocations of SDR's. A decision of the amount of SDR to be allocated in the next basic period (beginning in 1982) will be required by next summer. The IMF Executive Board will be preparing an analysis of the economic considerations relevant to a decision on allocations. We would expect that the analysis will indicate the need for an expansion of allocations and we look forward to a proposal by the Managing Director. World Bank 29. The World Bank is moving on a number of fronts to ease the economic plight of the third world and effect the necessary adjustments in their economies in light of increased energy costs. The Bank currently plans to ccrrmit about $14 billion for energy development between FY 81-85, which represents an increase of about 13 percent over its previously planned program. In addition, the Bank is studying means of increasing further its support for this most critical sector possibly through creation of seme form of energy affiliate. 30. The Bank has also undertaken a program of lending for structural adjust­ ment which entails a series of sequential non-project loans to assist countries in making necessary structural reforms to alter trade patterns and output. This program which will reach about $600-800 million this fiscal year will involve close collaboration between the Bank and Fund. 31. Additional funding exercises are currently under way for both the IBRD and IDA. These increases are necessary to continue lending programs. The General Capital Increase of the Bank will add about $40 billion to the capital and the 6th replenishment of IDA will provide an additional $12 billion for concessionary loans to the poorest countries. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis — T Detailed scenario coming from Bob Callis Rm. 1045 W.H.

Welcome members of the U.S. delegation, especially Congressional representatives and former Secretaries of the Treasury. Take special note of a few items on the schedule September 30: President will give welcoming statement at about 11:00 a.m. October 1: U.S. Governor's statement also at about 11:00a.m. hostcLng a reception in honor of the IMF and World Bank Governors’ this evening at 6:00 p.m. at the East, Wing of the National Gallery^to which members of the delegationfhave been invited. 2. Before responding to questions, would like to take a few minutes to report on the Interim and Development Committee meetings and review some of the principal issues likely to come up this week. Setting 3. This year's annual meetings will be critical in determining the fufcjjrejof the Fund and_ Bank during the 1980's. The meetings take place against a complex background: — Maj°rexpansion^of_ demands on tl\\e—ins^tttu'tfidns to play an increasingly important role in recycling and adjustment? — Effort by^PLO-and supporters to introduce heavily political element ihto ^institution^' affairs. — Renewed LDC effort to change the basic nature of the IMF to an \"aid\" institution. 4. The ability of the institutions to promote a sound world economy and stable international financial system will depend importantly on how they respond to these challenges. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 2 PLO \"\" 5. As you know, the Boards of Governors approvedResolutions providing for a standstill on observers pending completion of a study of the rules and procedures regarding the participation of observers. 6. In view of this action, the Chairman of the Annual meeting has decided not to invite any observers. to- the 198 0 Annual Meeting. Nonetheless, the supporters of the PLO have placed the issue on the agenda for the meetings, although we still do not know their intentions. 7. The U.S. has sought to avoid a confrontation over this matter and has made every effort to find a mutually acceptable solution. We believe the decision by the Board of Governors was a correct one and that the important work of the annual meetings should now proceed without disruption. The U.S. is not prepared, however, to agree to PLO observer status this year and cannot make any commitments regarding next year. believe that most LDCs and DCs wish to avoid a conltation on this issue at the annual meetings. The PLO issue_Xs_ *likely to be discussed in the Joint Procedures Committee later this week :ary Issues te main focus of discussions at Sunday’s meeting of the Interim Committee was the role ofthA tmf in the financing and adjustment of payments imbalances.

In considering the IMF's role in dealing with immediate financing problems, the Committee was also mindful of the Fund's responsibilities in the area of international liquidity, particularly the objective of making the SDR a major monetary instrument. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 3 11. The Committee therefore discussed several steps, including a number of U.S. suggestions, to promote the role of the SDR: < w 7 2^-A SDR allocations\": The developed countries were unwilling to agree to LDC proposals for an increase in the allocation scheduled in January 1981 because of concerns about contributing to inflationary expectations and undermining confidence in the SDR by attempting to \"fine tune\" the amount of SDRs to reflect changing economic conditions. There was more receptiveness however toward further SDR allocations in the next basic period beginning in 1982 and the Managing Director will provide an analysis and recommendations to the May,-meet-in ci of the Committee. — SDR characteristic The decision to adopt a five-currency basket for SDR valuation was welcomed as a means of simplifying the SDR and facilitating its use.

We will miss his strong and creative leadership as we enter a most difficult period in which we will rely increasingly upon the Bank to ease the economic plight of the developing world. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis With regard to a successor, we think that the next President of the Bank, as in the past, should be a qualified American of recognized stature. This would be consistent selection of presidents in other major financial institutions. (The IMF Managing Director is traditionally European; the Inter-American Bank President, Latin American; and the Asian Development Bank, Japanese. From our per­ spective, we also consider an American President an important element in maintaining Congressional support for the Bank Group where the United States remains by far the largest participant. with similar traditions for The United States will, therefore, nominate an American candidate, probably after the November elections. It is important that the candidate enjoy a wide degree of bipartisan support domestically, be of the highest professional and personal caliber, have proven ability to run a large organization, and be of sufficient inter­ national stature to maintain the confidence of the capital markets.

AMIR H. JAMAL, Minister for Finance and Governor of the Fund and Bank for TANZANIA, at the 1980 Annual Meetings I am deeply privileged to be Chairman of these Thirty-Fifth Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group and to welcome you all to Washington. I would like to extend a hearty welcome to the distinguished representatives of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, who have joined the Fund, and of St. Lucia and of Zimbabwe, who have joined both the Fund and the Bank, in the course of the year. Their presence in our midst is a demonstration of the continuing process of decolonization and a continuing reminder that international institutions need to change in response to the evolving political realities. If I extend a special welcome today to the Governors for the Fund and the World Bank of the People’s Republic of China, it is because it gives me particular pleasure to recall what I said at the 1971 Annual Meeting of Governors. I then said, \"All the progressive forces in the world are looking forward to the entry of the People's Republic of China as the only authentic voice representing the Chinese people. I would like to express a sincere hope that, in such an event and in those circum­ stances, it will be possible to see the People’s Republic of China becoming a full member of the IMF and the IBRD.\" At the outset, I would like to express my sincere appreciation that the question of observer status for the PLO and the legal issues sur­ rounding it are being dealt with in the Joint Procedures Committee. I very much"
