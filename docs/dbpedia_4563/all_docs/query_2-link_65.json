The air assets are pulled from various stateside Marine squadrons and take on the squadron name and tail code of the medium lift squadron (formerly the CH-46 helicopter squadron, now the V-22 tiltrotor squadron), and the medium lift squadron is designated as &quot;Reinforced&quot; (e.g. &quot;VMM-263 (Rein)&quot;).  Among the helicopter assets in the MEU are the UH-1N Huey (now the UH-1Y Venom) and the AH-1W Super Cobra or AH-1Z Viper, themselves taken from composite Marine Light Attack Helicopter (HMLA) squadrons.",
