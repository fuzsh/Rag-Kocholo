        "text": "US Navy & Marine Corps Tail Codes\n\nYour site talks about the tail codes used by the Air Force, but doesn't the Navy have tail codes too? Can you explain them?\n\n- Jay Washington\n\nI'm a big fan of the site...long time reader, first time question asker person. What's the deal with the tail code letters on Navy planes? They seem totally random.\n\n- Danny\n\nWe welcome all \"first time question asker persons.\" Yes, the US Navy and Marine Corps also have a tail code system similar to that used by the US Air Force. The Navy and Marine Corps refer to this convention as the Visual Identification System. Like the Air Force approach, the Visual Identification System consists of a two-letter code indicating the base or ship the aircraft is stationed at and a five-digit serial number called the Bureau Number. However, the Navy system is not as intuitively simple as that used by the Air Force since the two-letter codes are not derived from the name of the location where the plane is stationed. This decision was probably made because many Navy squadrons are affiliated with both an aircraft carrier and a land base, or homeport, where the planes are moved to while the ship is undergoing maintenance. In addition, aircraft carriers are eventually retired and the squadron is transferred to a different ship.\n\nContrary to the suggestion that Navy tail codes are totally random, there is some logic to their structure. All Navy squadrons stationed on aircraft carriers in the Atlantic Fleet have a tail code starting with the letter \"A.\" Pacific Fleet squadrons start with the letter \"N.\" The pattern for Marine Corps squadrons is not quite as clear but units on the east coast often start with a letter in the first half of the alphabet while those on the west coast often start with a letter in the second half. In general, all Air Force planes stationed at a given base have the same tail code and all Navy squadrons stationed aboard the same ship have the same tail code. The Marine Corps differs in this regard since all Marine aircraft within a given squadron have the same tail code regardless of where the unit is stationed or moves over time. Marine tail codes do sometimes change temporarily while the unit is embarked on an aircraft carrier or amphibious assault ship.\n\nF-18E of VFA-22 in CVW-14 aboard the USS Ronald Reagan showing its tail code\n\nGiven that background information, below is a list of current tail codes used by the Navy and Marine Corps. This information is complete to the best of our knowledge as of April 2007. Unlike the previous explanation of Air Force tail codes taken from one official source, this list has been compiled from a variety of official Navy documents and more recent unofficial sources that sometimes conflict. The list includes the ship and/or command to which each squadron belongs as well as the base or homeport where the unit is stationed. An explanation of these designations and abbreviations is provided below.\n\nSequential tail codes of the Blue Angels flight demo squadron\n\nE-2C Hawkeye of VAW-123 stationed aboard USS Enterprise\n\nAV-8B with the tail code CG of VMA-231 based at MCAS Cherry Point\n\nT-39 trainer of VT-86 stationed at NAS Pensacola\n\nMV-22 of the Marine Tiltrotor Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron\n\nSH-60F Seahawk of HS-6 stationed aboard USS Nimitz showing its NH tail code\n\nX-31 VECTOR research plane being tested at Pax River by the Salty Dogs of VX-23\n\nCH-46 of the Blue Knights (HMM-365) based at MCAS New River As described at the start of this article, the above list has been combined from multiple sources and may contain some inaccuracies or omissions. Please contact us with any corrections. Also bear in mind that Navy tail codes can change frequently as squadrons are exchanged between air wings and air wings move between different ships. Both the Navy and Marine Corps are also in the process of phasing out many older aircraft like the F-18A/C Hornet and CH-46 Sea Knight. Squadrons operating these vehicles will be transitioning to the F-18E/F Super Hornet or V-22 Osprey causing some squadrons to be disestablished or change designations.\n\nF-14 of the Tomcatters while it was known as VF-31 (now VFA-31)\n\nThe Fighter Squadron (VF), for example, has transitioned to the Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) with the retirement of the F-14 Tomcat. Sea Control Squadrons (VS) are also being disestablished as the S-3 Viking is phased out.\n\n- answer by Jeff Scott, 8 April 2007\n\nRelated Topics:\n\nWhy did the US military restart the aircraft designation numbers in the 1960s?\n\nCan you please explain the naming system for American missiles?\n\nI've seen terms like CBU and GBU used in the names of weapons.

For example, how did the F-14 become the Tomcat or the F-22 become the Raptor?\n\nWhat does the series of letters and numbers on the back of a plane stand for? Why do the numbers on US aircraft always start with the letter N? Where can I find a country's registration prefix?\n\nRead More Articles:\n\nCurrent Question of the Week\n\nPast Question Archive\n\nMost Popular Questions\n\nSearch the Archive\n\nSubmit a Question\n\nAircraft | Design | Ask Us | Shop | Search About Us | Contact Us | Copyright Â© 1997-2023"
