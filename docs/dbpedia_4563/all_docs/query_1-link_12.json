Members with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and U.S. Marines listen to U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Col. Brian T. Koch, center, commanding officer of Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 162 (VMM-162) (REIN), describe the MV-22 Osprey aboard the USS Kearsarge anchored off the shore of Onslow Beach, Camp Lejeune, N.C., July 17, 2015. Personnel with DARPA rode the Landing Craft Air Cushion and an MV-22 Osprey, as well as toured the Kearsarge to collect information for potential technological innovations that could benefit the Navy and Marine Corps in future operations.
