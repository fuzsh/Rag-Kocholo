RFERL Poland, Belarus, Ukraine Report, 6 August 2002 MELNYCHENKO TAPES REPORTEDLY THROW LIGHT ON BEATING OF LAWMAKER... The "Ukrayinska pravda" website (http://www.pravda.com.ua/) on 30 July published a transcript of what it claims to be a secret audio recording made by former presidential bodyguard Mykola Melnychenko of President Leonid Kuchma's conversation on 7 February 2000 with then-Security Service Chairman Leonid Derkach. The recording, the website asserts, sheds light on the beating of lawmaker Oleksandr Yelyashkevych on 8 February 2000. Below is a translation of the "Ukrayinska pravda" transcript of the conversation, with "stage directions" supplied by the website. The language of the conversation is very strong in its obscenity and spontaneous anti-Semitism, but "RFE/RL Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine Report" decided to reproduce it as closely as possible to the original (with some original terms supplied in brackets) in order to let readers experience the flavor of the vernacular -- essentially Russian, but with Ukrainian intrusions -- that apparently is used in Ukraine's corridors of power. The "Ukrayinska pravda" transcript: The office of Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma. A conversation in the office between Leonid Kuchma and then-Ukrainian Security Service Chairman Leonid Derkach. A television set is on with a live broadcast of a session of Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada. People's Deputy of Ukraine Oleksandr Yelyashkevych is addressing the session of Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada. Leonid Kuchma, instantly agitated by Yelyashkevych's proposals, breaks off his conversation with Derkach. KUCHMA: [Very loudly, in a state of extreme agitation]: Here is a f**king [blyad] Yiddish sprout [zhydenysh]! Yelyashkevych continues to address the session, while Kuchma and Derkach suddenly begin to speak in low voice. KUCHMA: He will get [what's coming to him]. DERKACH: F**k him up! KUCHMA: F**k him up! Let's [do it]! Let the little Jew [evreichik] be handled by yids [zhydy]! DERKACH: Be handled and done for. What does he f**king think [he is], in the end? [Let them] beat him a little and say: Prick [mudak]! KUCHMA: Let the yids [handle] the yid! Well, I agree. [The name of the man charged with the direct task of organizing an assault is voiced -- "Ukrayinska pravda" website's note.] DERKACH: Let's hurry! At this moment, parliamentary speaker Ivan Plyushch begins to comment on one of Yelyashkevych's proposals that was voiced shortly before [regarding the announcement of a recess in the session to hold consultations among the leaders of all parliamentary caucuses]. Kuchma, agitated by this, says loudly in his characteristic style that the speaker has to continue the session without announcing a recess before the time stipulated by parliamentary regulations. KUCHMA: Drag it out until 12:00, you motherf**ker! The conversation between Kuchma and Derkach, interrupted for a moment, resumes. DERKACH: He'll meet his end! KUCHMA: You arrange everything. DERKACH: By what date? KUCHMA: Tomorrow. DERKACH: Good. He'll be at home! KUCHMA: Finish [him] off! He, the little yid [zhydok], will f**king get [what he's got coming]! Kuchma tries to reach first deputy speaker [Viktor] Medvedchuk by phone, but it is impossible to connect with him for the moment. Medvedchuk is in the presidium in the session hall, and it is impossible to find an assistant who has the right to enter the session hall to summon [Medvedchuk to the phone]. Kuchma becomes extremely nervous. He switches to exquisitely vile swearwords. He demands that he be immediately connected with Medvedchuk, [and] he demands that Medvedchuk's secretary be sacked. Eight minutes after his previous address, Yelyashkevych is once again allowed to take the floor. His speech is heard in the presidential office. Comments in low voices are heard. DERKACH: He will get [what he's got coming]! At this moment, Kuchma begins to talk with Medvedchuk on the phone. KUCHMA: [loudly and very swiftly, mumbling]: Hello! [unintelligible] Listen! There is no need to take an early break. It is necessary to continue until 12. Otherwise, they will celebrate a victory. They will mess up everything. Under no circumstances. Drag it out. Any issues [you like]. Good. Kuchma and Derkach again listen to deputy Yelyashkevych's speech. Kuchma says in low voice: KUCHMA: Let them beat him! He's become impudent, that son of a bitch [suka]! ...AND SUGGEST THAT KUCHMA WAS NOT ONLY TAPED, BUT ALSO TAPED OTHERS. The "Ukrayinska pravda" website on 5 August published a transcript of what it claims to be a secret audio recording made by former presidential bodyguard Melnychenko of President Kuchma's conversation on 9 September 2000 with then-Security Service Chairman Derkach. The recording, the website says, testifies to the fact that Ukraine's Security Service successfully bugged embassies of several NATO countries (including Turkey and Spain) and -- "if Derkach did not lie" -- broke the codes of secret messages sent by those embassies to their governments. As in the above transcript, the website supplied "stage directions." The "Ukrayinska pravda" transcript: 9 September 2000 Kuchma's office Ukrainian Security Service Chairman Leonid Derkach reports [to the president]. Kuchma rustles papers that Derkach brought him. DERKACH: All these are a decoding of the... The embassy sends classified information to Spain -- we read it. And we read Turkey as well. We have taken programs from Switzerland, [as well as] algorithms and some equipment. Most likely, five [or] six pieces more, and [we] should [one word is unintelligible -- website's note] 26 other states. Kuchma continues to rustle papers. DERKACH: These are all three, almost one by one [literal translation -- compiler's note]. And here is one more. KUCHMA: What's this? DERKACH: A scheme how to ship out [vyvezti] millions of hryvnas.
