CONCLUSION\n\nAPPENDIX: CANDIDATE REPRESENTATIVES ON DISTRICT ELECTION COMMISSIONS\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nWhen the citizens of Ukraine cast their votes in the country's third presidential election, they will choose the direction of the country's political future. Ukraine already boasts some of the structures of democracy, including a constitution adopted in 1996. More recently, new electoral and local government laws were enacted that should contribute to a genuine decentralization of authority. Ukrainians have also demonstrated on several occasions that power can be transferred peacefully through elections.\n\nSince his election in 1994, the incumbent president Leonid Kuchma has negotiated a series of political land mines - relations with Russia, constitutional crises, a post-Soviet constitution, and modest economic reform regulations. Though political parties have been slow to develop, eight parties garnered enough votes in the 1998 parliamentary elections to achieve the 4 percent threshold required for proportional representation in the new legislative assembly. Parliamentary factions have formed and have begun participating in decisions affecting domestic policy.\n\nNotwithstanding these accomplishments, the foundations of reform in Ukraine are fragile.\n\nThe country remains beset with severe economic problems. Privatization has been sporadic. Declining living standards, coupled with the exposure of corruption by public officials, have led many Ukrainians to lose faith in government. Though a number of presidential candidates are appealing to the public's nostalgia for the \"simpler\" times before independence, there is no leading candidate advocating far reaching economic and political reforms.\n\nII. THE PRESIDENCY\n\nThe winner of the 1999 presidential election will occupy an office with broad powers, the legacy of the Soviet nomenklatura system in which distinctions among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government were blurred. While Ukraine's 1996 constitution grants certain enhanced powers to the parliament relative to the presidency, the executive branch still commands strong authority.\n\nUnder the 1996 constitution, Ukraine's president serves not more than two consecutive terms of five years each and directly appoints the entire presidential administrative apparatus without the approval of parliament. The president appoints a full cabinet of ministers, with only the prime minister requiring confirmation by the legislature. Other ministerial appointments require the co-signature of the prime minister. For each of the country's 27 regions, the president also appoints a presidential representative and head of regional administration, as well as the heads of city administrations. In all, the president has direct power of appointment for more than 2,000 positions in the government.\n\nIn recent years, the image of the presidency has been tarnished by allegations of corrupt practices by government officials. By virtue of the strong constitutional powers of the office, the victor in the 1999 presidential election will, in large measure, bear the responsibility for either perpetuating or reversing this image.\n\nThe election also holds great significance for the future of Ukraine's economy and its position in the world, as the policies implemented by the president - who will have a relatively free hand in both domestic and foreign affairs - will largely determine the pace and shape of economic reforms, as well as Ukraine's strength and self-reliance within its region. Calls for a closer relationship to Russia, a severing of ties with the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, and breaking relations with NATO, would likely weaken Ukraine's international standing and further weaken the country's ailing economy. As the most decisive voice in Ukraine, the president will play a critical role in determining what happens in and to Ukraine over the next five years.\n\nIII. ELECTORAL FRAMEWORK\n\nThe Presidential Election Law\n\nPresident Kuchma signed a new law on presidential elections in March 1999. This law replaces the country's previous presidential\n\nelection law of 1994 and conforms to the 1996 constitution by establishing a hierarchy of election commissions identical to that provided by the parliamentary election law for single-mandate races.\n\nThe new election law seeks to prevent election abuses by a sitting president or other government officials and also provides for greater oversight by the legislature and election observers. The law prohibits government officials or state-owned organizations (including state media organizations) from endorsing a specific candidate. It prohibits candidates from using the personnel or resources of their current political or government offices in the furtherance of their campaigns. It also prohibits the use of inducements in the form of goods or services in connection with campaign publicity.\n\nThe new law requires that prospective candidates collect at least one million voter signatures on a nomination petition (rather than 100,000 as under the old law) in order to register for the election. Notably, the law also abolishes the voter turnout threshold, which previously required that at least 50 percent of registered voters cast a ballot in order for the election to be valid.\n\nTo win the 1999 contest, a candidate must poll more than 50 percent of ballots cast. In the event that no candidate achieves a majority vote, the race will be decided in a runoff election on November 14. Candidates may withdraw from the race at any time until October 28.\n\nThe law divides the country into 225 election districts, rather than relying on the 27 regional administrative divisions. This provision is designed to prevent an incumbent president from using executive branch representatives in the regions to interfere with the election process. According to the law, each candidate has the right to nominate representatives to the various commissions. The distribution of candidates' representatives was announced at the end of August (see Appendix B).\n\nThe new law attempts to minimize the risk of election fraud by allowing representatives of presidential candidates to attend sessions of the Central Election Commission (CEC) and to be present during voting and tabulation of results.\n\nThe Pre-Election Environment\n\nDespite progress toward fair elections, the pre-election period has not been without its problems. Several international organizations\n\nhave raised serious concerns about the tactics employed by candidates. The European Parliamentary Assembly, for instance, noted\n\nthreats to journalists and the intermingling of the president's administration with his re-election campaign. The OSCE and the Council of Europe, as well as opposition candidates themselves, have expressed the concern that the state-controlled media have been manipulated to limit the access of presidential challengers.\n\nIn media coverage of the election, President Kuchma has received disproportionate attention in comparison with other candidates, both in state-controlled and privately owned media. The constitution prohibits state-owned organizations from endorsing a particular candidate for election. Nevertheless, a recent survey conducted by Ukraine's National Council for TV and Broadcasting shows that the incumbent has received more exposure on state-controlled television than all challengers combined. A number of newspaper publishers and television stations have complained of government pressure to force them to limit their coverage of President\n\nKuchma's challengers. In one widely publicized case, bank accounts of television station STB were frozen for alleged violations of tax\n\nregulations. Television stations 1+1 and ICTV have been threatened with closure on the grounds of unpaid debts to the National\n\nBroadcasting Board.\n\nWhile President Kuchma has faced allegations of misuse of his power as incumbent to secure his re-election, the legislature has demonstrated its independence. During the summer, the parliament rejected the president's proposal to establish additional layers of election commissions at the local and regional levels on the grounds that the amendments would have allowed an incumbent\n\npresident to influence the voting process through his local appointees.\n\nIn October, the parliament overrode President Kuchma's veto of a further amendment to the election law requiring that each member of the local and territorial election commissions receive an official copy of the vote tallies from polling places. The change was made in part to reduce the likelihood that the vote count could be manipulated by local election commissions.\n\nAccusations that President Kuchma has used his office to influence media coverage and the election process have raised concerns that Ukraine may be returning to election tactics that marred the integrity of the last presidential elections. Violations cited during that election in 1994 included theft of ballot boxes, intimidation of voters, and widespread instances of multiple voting by individuals. However, displays of independence by the legislature and Supreme Court during the 1999 campaign give cause to hope that a sitting president's power to influence the election process has diminished in the past five years.\n\nIV. CANDIDATES AND PARTIES\n\nAt the time of this writing, 15 candidates are registered for the initial round of balloting for the presidency on October 31. The candidates may be roughly divided into three groups:\n\nThe four leaders who have attracted strong nationwide support are current president Leonid Kuchma, Progressive Socialist Party candidate Natalia Vitrenko, Communist Party candidate Petro Symonenko, and Socialist Party candidate Oleksandr Moroz.\n\nSignificant political figures who stand less chance of contesting a likely second round are parliamentary speaker and Peasant Party candidate Oleksandr Tkachenko; Rukh party candidates Hennadyi Udovenko and Yuri Kostenko, and former prime minister Yevhen Marchuk of the Social Democratic Union.\n\nMarginal candidates who command little support among the electorate are Vasyl Onopenko, Vitaliy Kononov, Volodymyr Oliynyk, Yuri Karmazin, Mykola Haber, Oleksandr Rzhavsky, and Oleksandr Basylyuk.\n\nBy way of contrast with presidential elections in the United States, Russia, and other countries, it is notable that the leading candidates for the Ukrainian presidency are virtually all influential members of parliament, rather than regional leaders or private citizens. The only exceptions to this rule are President Kuchma, Oleksandr Bazylyuk, and Cherkassy Mayor Volodymyr Oliynyk.\n\nThe following profiles examine the individual candidates in greater detail.\n\nLeonid Kuchma: no party affiliation\n\nThe current president of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma won his seat in a runoff election against incumbent Leonid Kravchuk in July 1994 in the country's first peaceful electoral change of power. He is officially not aligned with any political party, but is most closely associated with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the Social Democratic Party (United). He is also endorsed by at least 18 other small political parties and groups.\n\nKuchma's base of support is the industrial center of Dnipropetrovsk in the predominantly Russian-speaking eastern half of Ukraine. He\n\nattended university there and rose to become the director of one of the Soviet Union's largest weapons manufacturers. Kuchma was elected to the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet in 1990 and served as prime minister under President Leonid Kravchuk in 1992-93. Upon his election to the presidency in 1994, Kuchma brought hundreds of Dnipropetrovsk officials to Kyiv to fill out his executive apparatus.\n\nIn the 1994 presidential race, Kuchma was the chief opponent of Leonid Kravchuk. Throughout his first national campaign, Kuchma advanced a pro-Russian agenda. Kuchma came in second in the first round of elections with 31.3 percent of the vote and won the presidency in the second round with 52.2 percent, in part with the second round support of the Communist Party. Within a year of his election, however, Kuchma lost the support of left-wing forces and gained the backing of the more centrist parties for his talk of\n\neconomic reform.\n\nKuchma's presidency has been unremarkable on the domestic front. His policies have not resulted in economic growth, and months of federal wages and pensions remain unpaid. Corruption has increased at all levels of Ukrainian society, despite Kuchma's earlier vows to eliminate it. Kuchma distinguished himself in foreign affairs, however, by resolving a heated dispute with Russia over the status of the Crimean peninsula, bringing Ukraine into the Council of Europe, and achieving working relations with NATO.\n\nIn the 1999 election, Kuchma has cast himself as a strong opponent of Communist and leftist forces, but his platform statements have been vague. In a press conference announcing his campaign platform, he stated: \"I am in the center, but in every special situation I move either left or right.\" He has vowed, however, to continue what he has called his \"current reforms\" into his second term. His stated goals include boosting the efficiency and reducing the size of the government apparatus, introducing a bicameral legislature, continuing to fight systemic corruption, and increasing the independence of local government. On the economic front he has vowed to balance the federal budget, improve the country's rate of development, and protect national savings from inflation. He has also promised to reduce poverty, reform the pension system, and increase the amount of affordable housing.\n\nA number of political groups have endorsed Kuchma's campaign. His current prime minister, Valery Pustovoitenko, assembled 20 political parties and around 80 civic organizations into a union of political forces known as \"Zlagoda\" for the express purpose of supporting Kuchma's campaign. The People's Democratic Party, known as the \"party of power\" due to the number of highly placed government officials among its members, has long been one of Kuchma's most powerful backers among established political parties.\n\nA new and important supporter of Kuchma's campaign is the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (United), or SDPU(U). This party, formed in 1996 following a split in the Social Democratic Party, joined three left-centrist parties in common cause. Among the leaders of this party are Viktor Medvechuk and Grigory Surkis, whose connection to the business community has helped the party to raise funds. Medvechuk and Surkis shifted the party's support to Kuchma, which led to Medvechuk's election as deputy speaker of the parliament.\n\nNatalia Vitrenko: Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine\n\nNatalia Vitrenko, a trained economist and the only woman in the presidential race, began her political career as a member of Oleksandr Moroz's Socialist Party when it was founded in 1991. She won election to parliament in 1994. After splitting with Moroz in early 1996 with accusations that he was betraying Leninist ideals with his support for reform, she applied for membership in the Communist Party faction. Communist leaders rejected her membership, however, and in response Vitrenko founded the Progressive Socialist Party, which she continues to dominate.\n\nVitrenko has made a name for herself as an orthodox Leninist. Her party grew quickly in 1997, capitalizing on general discontent among older voters and the dissatisfaction of some Socialists with their party's perceived shift to the right. While the Progressive Socialist faction has the fewest members of any faction in parliament, it is highly visible, and Vitrenko's presidential candidacy has enjoyed consistent popularity when judged by opinion polls. It was speculated that sympathy for her might grow in the wake of a recent assassination attempt, in which Vitrenko suffered superficial injuries when grenades were thrown at her at a campaign event on October 2. However, opinion polls conducted since the event have not shown a significant change in her support.\n\nVitrenko is perhaps Ukraine's most charismatic politician. Her strident rhetoric portrays Ukraine as a country on the edge of a catastrophe from which only Vitrenko and her party's program can rescue it. Her platform calls for an immediate reversal of reforms and the imposition of total state regulation of the economy, including a state monopoly on foreign trade and the renewal of entitlements such as free education and health care. She has demanded a complete freeze on external debt payments, the severing of relations with the International Monetary Fund, and the re-acquisition of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal as a defense against a possible NATO invasion.\n\nPetro Symonenko: Communist Party of Ukraine\n\nUkraine's largest and best disciplined political force, the Communist Party remains the only party with a truly national following. While the Communists supported Kuchma for president in the runoff of 1994, that support waned as Ukraine's economic situation worsened in subsequent years. The party gained significantly in the latest parliamentary elections, winning 27 percent of seats in the assembly.\n\nPetro Symonenko joined the Soviet Communist party apparatus in 1982. After independence he was drafted by the renascent Ukrainian Communist Party to serve as the party's head. He was elected to parliament in 1994 and again in 1998. Symonenko's public image reflects the collective policies and decisions of his party rather than his personal leadership style; critics speculate that Symonenko would have difficulty in defeating Kuchma in a runoff ballot.\n\nThe Communist campaign appeals to retirees and state-salaried workers who are collectively owed months of back wages and pensions. Pensioners, in particular, make up more than a quarter of the country's population. The party platform includes policies that advocate a return to central economic planning, elimination of monetarist economic policies, an end to the privatization process, and closer national ties with Russia and Belarus. On foreign policy, Symonenko has declared that Ukraine must remain non-aligned and must not pursue membership in NATO.\n\nOleksandr Moroz: Socialist Party of Ukraine\n\nOleksandr Moroz, the founder and chairman of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, is one of the country's better-known politicians. In 1976 he began his long career in the Communist Party as a regional official in Ukraine. He won his first parliamentary seat in 1990. He was the driving force behind the establishment of the Socialist Party, which in 1991 was formed by members of the Soviet Communist Party in Ukraine after it was banned in the wake of the failed coup against Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nIn 1994, following his re-election to the parliament, Moroz was selected as speaker and used that position to become a leading force of the left alliance in parliament and to strengthen his party's infrastructure in the regions. Although he failed to unite the Socialist Party with the renascent Communist Party of Ukraine and Peasant Party into a left-wing coalition, he did manage to bring the Peasant Party into a single parliamentary faction with the Socialists and other leftist groups.\n\nMoroz was re-elected to his parliamentary seat in 1998 as head of the Socialist-Peasant faction but failed in his re-election bid for speaker. The subsequent split between the Socialist and Peasant parties further weakened Moroz's political position. The Socialist Party continues to struggle in search of an identity distinct from the Communist Party, and much of its strength is derived from Moroz's continuing leadership.\n\nMoroz has made efforts to portray himself as an honest and politically moderate candidate, despite his party's decided left-wing orientation. In broad terms, he seems to have resigned himself to a market economy for Ukraine so long as it has strong social welfare components. Moroz has spoken in favor of government controls in the agricultural sector and against land privatization. He advocates a leading role for the state in organizing land use and supporting farmers through cheap loans, tax breaks, and minimum price levels for basic agricultural goods. Moroz has voiced his support for attracting increased foreign investment to Ukraine and has vowed to focus much of his energy on alleviating the country's persistent unemployment.\n\nHis message resonates most strongly with voters across the political spectrum who are displeased with Ukraine's current social and economic plight and who see Moroz as a \"clean\" candidate without a history of corruption.\n\nOleksandr Tkachenko: Peasants' Party\n\nOleksandr Tkachenko was elected speaker of the parliament in July, 1998. He served as Deputy Speaker under Oleksandr Moroz in the previous legislature. Tkachenko's Peasants' Party is an agrarian organization formed in 1992 and dominated by collective farm directors and regional officials. The party has been closely associated with the Communist Party and generally opposes any privatization of land or other \"capitalist\" measures.\n\nBorn in 1939, Tkachenko graduated from the Agrarian Institute and worked as an agricultural specialist before proceeding to the High Party School in his native Cherkassy and entering the ranks of the Communist apparat. He rose to become first secretary of the Party organization of the Tarashchanskyi district in the Kyiv region. In 1981 he joined the Communist Party Central Committee and became head of the Ternopil regional administration in western Ukraine. From 1985 until Ukraine's independence he served as Minister of Agriculture, as a deputy in Soviet Ukraine's last parliament, and as Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nIn 1995, Tkachenko was under investigation by the prosecutor general for misusing state funds borrowed by an agricultural association that he controlled. Though the money was never returned, charges were dropped the day after he was elected speaker, fueling speculation that Kuchma had backed his speakership in order to lower the profile of Moroz and to control the parliament.\n\nAs speaker, Tkachenko is one of the country's most powerful politicians, second in stature only to the president, and his candidacy serves as a strong counterpoint to Kuchma's administrative power. As an advocate of enhanced independence for local legislative councils, Tkachenko is possibly the only Ukrainian politician to rival Kuchma's control at the local and regional level. Thus, many believe, his opposition to Kuchma could help prevent possible manipulation of the voting process by the incumbent.\n\nHennadyi Udovenko: Rukh-U\n\nHennadyi Udovenko is the current head of the Rukh party, which was founded in 1989 as the country's first democratic political opposition movement. Organized to support Gorbachev's perestroika policies, Rukh came to serve as a rallying point for anti-Communists, former dissidents, and intellectuals who shared the common goal of Ukrainian independence. Rukh members initiated both the referendum on sovereignty and Ukraine's declaration of independence in 1991. Since those days, however, Rukh's fortunes have declined. In the beginning of 1999, conflicts within the party resulted in its split into two factions.\n\nA career diplomat, Udovenko served as Ukraine's representative to the United Nations (1977-1980) and as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1992-1994). Udovenko entered the political arena in 1997 when the late Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil offered him the third position on the party list. Udovenko accepted this position and in 1998 was elected to parliament. Less than a year later, disagreements within the party became public, and Chornovil's support for Udovenko as Rukh's presidential candidate led to the party's split. Udovenko\n\nleads the faction of the party which gained the approval of the Ministry of Justice to retain the Rukh name.\n\nBesides the backing of his own party, Udovenko has the endorsement of Reforms and Order, a liberal party founded in 1997 by a reformist bloc of parliamentary deputies led by former Vice Prime Minister Viktor Pynzenyk. Although Reforms and Order failed to gain the 4 percent of votes needed in the 1998 elections for proportional representation in parliament, the party joined with several independent deputies to form a faction which has grown substantially over the last year and is now the ideological home to 25 members of parliament. Reforms and Order was associated with Rukh before that party split and has chosen to remain loyal to Udovenko's faction. The two parties have committed to working together following the presidential election to develop a common legislative agenda.\n\nIn the first public statement of his platform on September 6, Udovenko declared that, if elected, he would address the country's continuing economic crisis and would work to expand the influence of the Ukrainian language and culture in the country, while protecting the rights of Russian speakers. Udovenko has asserted that he is not seeking political partners or coalitions.\n\nYuri Kostenko: Rukh-K\n\nEducated as an engineer, Yuri Kostenko pursued a 27-year career at the Paton Institute of Electric Welding. He won election to the Ukrainian parliament in 1990 and was appointed Minister of Environmental Protection and Nuclear Security in 1992, a post he held concurrently with his legislative position. He subsequently won re-election to the parliament in a single-mandate race in 1994, a high-profile campaign that gained Kostenko national notoriety.\n\nKostenko left his ministerial post in 1998 when new legislation made it illegal for him to hold simultaneous positions in the administration and parliament. Although he won re-election to the parliament as part of Rukh's party list in 1998, he lost his bid to become speaker of the assembly. In the winter of 1998-99, when internal conflict split Rukh, Kostenko assumed leadership of the new\n\nparty and launched his own presidential campaign.\n\nThe \"new\" Rukh, under Kostenko's direction, has tended to attract younger reformists who seek to participate actively in government. The party's program calls for cooperation between the legislative and executive branches and proposes the formation of a coalition government to institute radical reforms of the tax, economic, and pension systems.\n\nKostenko's reformist platform calls for specific numeric targets for Ukrainian economic performance. It advocates private land ownership and the removal of government limitations on business. Citing Ukraine's high per-capita energy consumption, Kostenko favors the development of more energy-efficient industry and new domestic energy sources. Kostenko also seeks to integrate Ukraine into European political, economic, and military institutions.\n\nYevhen Marchuk: Social Democratic Union\n\nYevhen Marchuk - a member of parliament, former Prime Minister, and career KGB official - is a well known politician in Ukraine. After 28 years in the Soviet KGB, he served as the first chief of Ukraine's State Security Service in 1991-94. Also in 1991, he became Ukraine's Minister of Defense, National Security & Emergencies. He parlayed this experience into a successful government career,\n\nrising to become a Deputy Prime Minister in 1994, then First Deputy Prime Minister three months later, and finally Prime Minister, a post he held until 1996.\n\nIn 1995, the same year that President Kuchma appointed him prime minister, Marchuk was also elected to parliament. At that time, Ukrainian law permitted individuals simultaneously to occupy posts in the legislature and the government, and Marchuk served as an MP concurrently with his position as premier. After his election to parliament, Marchuk grew apart from the president, and eventually Kuchma dismissed him because of his increasing criticisms of the administration. Marchuk won re-election to the parliament in 1998 as a member of the Social Democratic Party (United) and led the party's faction in parliament. When he failed to gain the party's support for his presidential bid, however, he left the faction in late 1998 and formed the Social Democratic Union.\n\nThrough his new party, Marchuk gained the support of a number of right and far-right parties with his campaign platform, which has focused on calls for strong measures to combat corruption and organized crime. He has presented himself as a personal guarantor of law and order in Ukraine and has promised to resign his presidency in one year if his proposed reforms are unsuccessful.\n\nVasyl Onopenko: Ukrainian Social Democratic Party\n\nVasyl Onopenko, formerly Ukraine's Minister of Justice and chairman of the Social Democratic Party (United), was elected to the parliament as an SDPU(U) candidate in the parliamentary elections of 1998. There is growing speculation that he will withdraw his candidacy and support Kostenko before the first round of elections.\n\nSDPU(U) (see discussion of Leonid Kuchma) was a political amalgam that resulted from a split in the former Social Democratic Party of Ukraine. Following the 1998 legislative elections, when party leaders Viktor Medvechuk and Grigoriy Sirkis threw their support to President Kuchma, Onopenko split from SDPU(U) to form a new party called the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party. He heads a parliamentary faction, known as the Independent faction, which is composed largely of politically non-aligned deputies.\n\nVitaliy Kononov: Party of Greens\n\nThe Party of Greens was founded at a congress in Kyiv in September 1990 with the participation of 106 delegates from most of Ukraine's regions. In the 1998 parliamentary elections the Party of Greens surprised political analysts by taking 6 percent of the vote. Vitaliy Kononov has been the party's chairman since 1992. In 1999, however, the party split again; Kononov remains at the head of the Party of Greens, while the new breakaway group, known as the Greens Party, supports President Kuchma's campaign. While Kononov remains committed to his own candidacy in the first round, he is politically close to Kuchma and has stated that he will support the incumbent in the runoff.\n\nVolodymyr Oliynyk: no party affiliation\n\nVolodymyr Oliynyk's nomination for the presidency was originally supported by a coalition of right-wing organizations. He currently serves as Mayor of the city of Cherkassy and as head of the Association of Ukrainian Mayors.\n\nAlthough not formally affiliated with any political party, Oliynyk is endorsed by a number of political groups, most notably the Ukrainian\n\nNational Assembly. Although only registered in 1994, this party traces its roots to several groups active in Ukrainian politics in the beginning of the 1990s. Its central priority is the formation of and control over a new state apparatus that will enforce public order. The party is highly resistant to the outflow of capital from the country and advocates a mixed private-state sector economic system.\n\nYuri Karmazin: Defenders of the Motherland\n\nThe Kharkiv-based Defenders of the Motherland party is anti-western and leftist in orientation. Its membership consists mainly of retired Soviet Army servicemen, as well as a small number of businessmen. The primary focus of the party's platform is the fight against organized crime and corruption; it also advocates state-supervised reforms and Ukraine's integration into all CIS structures, as well as raising Ukraine's defenses against a possible incursion of NATO troops.\n\nKarmazin is a member of parliament and head of the Parliamentary Committee on Organized Crime. He came to the parliament in 1994 from the Odessa City Council. He is also a former member of Hromada, an opposition political party founded in 1993 by a group of former Communists.\n\nMykola Haber: Patriotic Party of Ukraine\n\nAt age 38, Haber is the youngest of the presidential contenders. A member of parliament, he was elected on the party list of Natalia\n\nVitrenko's far-left Progressive Socialist Party and is now a member of the \"Fatherland\" faction, which is associated with the center bloc of factions. Haber has also been a member of the Hromada party, a leader in the Constitutional Democratic Party, and chairman of the Express Courier publishing corporation.\n\nOleksandr Rzhavsky: United Family Union\n\nOleksandr Rzhavsky, a parliament member from the city of Donetsk, ran unsuccessfully for the post of parliamentary speaker in May 1998. His background is primarily in the area of commercial banking, and he is a former president of Ukraine's Coral Bank. Rzhavsky is notable in that he has the highest declared income for 1998 of anyone on the presidential ballot. He entered the race in large part to develop a constituency for his newly-formed party, the United Family Union, in anticipation of the 2002 parliamentary elections.\n\nOleksandr Bazylyuk: Slavic Party of Ukraine\n\nOleksandr Bazylyuk, a member of parliament, has been associated with a number of political parties and other organizations that favor closer Ukrainian ties with Russia and a close-knit commonwealth of Slavic nations. He was a co-founder of the Party of Democratic Rebirth, a leader of the left-wing Civic Congress of Ukraine, and chairman of the Movement for Rebirth of the Donetsk Region.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nThe re-election campaign of any president is a referendum on the progress the country has made during the incumbent's tenure. Unlike a true referendum, however, a vote against President Kuchma requires the voters to select his replacement. Though polls consistently demonstrate that over 95 percent of Ukrainians are dissatisfied with the country's conditions, they also show that the electorate remains deeply divided and that no candidate can command a healthy plurality among likely voters.\n\nOver the last five years the lives of average Ukrainians have not improved, and the wave of discontent that swept Kuchma into office has yet to recede. President Kuchma attributes Ukraine's domestic problems to the country's inability to attract foreign capital, confront corruption, and enact real economic reform. The candidates most likely to oppose the president in the November runoff charge that these problems stem from an incompetent administration and the abandonment of centralized economic planning. Only a return to a more regulated economy, Kuchma's opponents argue, will improve conditions within the country.\n\nSeasoned observers have long marveled at the capacity of Ukraine's citizenry to weather increasing levels of dissatisfaction and economic hardship. It remains to be seen whether the 1999 elections will produce a grudging embrace of the status quo, or the status quo ante. Whatever the outcome, it seems clear that the prospects for fundamental change in Ukraine remain part of a future too uncertain for most Ukrainians to envision, let alone embrace. Moreover, Ukraine's advocates of far-reaching reforms still face a\n\ndaunting task in promoting a vision that is understandable and acceptable.\n\nAPPENDIX: CANDIDATE REPRESENTATIVES ON DISTRICT ELECTION COMMISSIONS\n\nDistribution of candidate representatives across the 225 district-level election commissions as announced on August 31 by the Ad-Hoc\n\nCommission on Presidential Election Law Compliance.\n\nCandidate Number of representatives heading district commissions Leonid Kuchma 80 Petro Symonenko 22 Hennadyi Udovenko 18 Vitaliy Kononov 16 Oleksandr Tkachenko 16 Oleksandr Moroz 14 Volodymyr Oliynyk 12 Vasyl Onopenko 11 Yuri Kostenko 10 Yevhen Marchuk 10 Natalia Vitrenko 7 Oleksandr Bazylyuk 3 Oleksandr Rzhavsky 3 Yuri Karmazin 2 Mykola Haber 1\n\nFunds for the publication of this report were provided by the United States Agency for International Development."
