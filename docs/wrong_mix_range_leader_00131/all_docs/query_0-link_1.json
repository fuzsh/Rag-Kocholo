        "text": "The rivalry between the two orange leaders, Yulia Tymoshenko and Viktor Yushchenko, has gripped the country ever since they descended the stage in downtown Kiev from which they launched their challenge to Kuchma. Since they took up the reins of government in early 2005, with Yushchenko as president and Tymoshenko as on-and-off prime minister, they have been jockeying for supremacy. But neither a reform of the constitution nor two parliamentary elections have decisively empowered either of the two offices. Now the next presidential poll, due in January 2010, is already casting its spell and reinforcing the split between the erstwhile allies. The Russian invasion of Georgia has sharpened the divide, with the president’s associates accusing the prime minister of doing Russia’s bidding in Ukraine.\n\nSo what is a soft-spoken former academic doing in this world? And what has prompted Hryhoriy Nemyria, a former think-tanker who is now described by many as the most powerful man in Ukraine’s government after the prime minister, to throw in his lot with Tymoshenko, by far the more colourful and controversial of Ukraine’s leaders? For one thing, Nemyria suggested on the BBC’s Hard Talk programme in February that Tymoshenko is “the most investigated politician in Ukraine” and no proof has ever been found that her considerable wealth was acquired by illegal means. Not only is she clean, in his view, but clean government is her top priority. (Ukraine ranked 118th out of 179 countries on Transparency International’s corruption perception index for 2007, squeezed between Mali and Mauritania.)\n\nNemyria, who is a deputy prime minister, runs Tymoshenko’s Europe policy out of a corner suite on an upper floor of the Council of Ministers’ imposing building in downtown Kiev. It overlooks the leafy area enclosing Dynamo Kiev’s home turf, with the mighty Dnieper flowing by just behind it. The Verkhovna Rada, the country’s parliament, is just round the corner. But the impressive location is incidental. Nemyria, though a first-rate diplomat and effective advocate for his boss, is not primarily about representation. He is all about getting things done – and the list is long.\n\nThe most immediate concern for Ukraine’s policymakers is the negotiation of a new association agreement with the EU, which will include sweeping free-trade provisions that could open the EU’s vast market to Ukrainian goods, while exposing uncompetitive Ukrainian firms to new challenges. Nemyria understands this, an observer of Ukraine’s economy says. “He knows what foreign investors want and he is quite explicit about what is needed in terms of economic reforms,” he says, adding that Nemyria “speaks the language that we want to hear.”\n\nThis is also true in a literal sense. His English is excellent and he lists travel as a hobby. Stints at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, Harvard University, the NATO Defence College in Rome and the University of Bordeaux have exposed him to different mentalities and ways of doing business – not a trivial matter for someone who spent the first 31 years of his life in the Soviet Union.\n\nThere are some who question Nemyria’s influence on events and on his boss, Tymoshenko. His amiable but reserved manner and the academic precision of his speech suggest a thinker, rather than a decider. But the people he talks to in the EU appreciate the solidity and focus of the trained historian, qualities that will be in demand when the two sides meet for a key summit in Evian, France, on 9 September. Tymoshenko told European Voice earlier this year that she expected “some sort of political association which would help us in our bid for EU membership” – the one thing the EU is reluctant to offer. “The EU hasn’t changed its approach to Ukraine substantially since the revolution,” says an observer of Ukrainian affairs, likening the EU to “a super-tanker that takes a long time to turn around”.\n\nNemyria concedes that not all difficulties in the relationship originate in Brussels. He concedes that EU counterparts do not always find it easy to perceive who is in charge in Ukraine. “There’s a significant dose of dualism, of duplication,” he acknowledges, alluding to the “appetite” of the presidential administration for involvement in European affairs.\n\nYushchenko repeatedly offers ambitious timelines and promises for closer ties with the EU, raising expectations that are inevitably disappointed. Nemyria insists that European integration properly falls under the authority of the Council of Ministers, since it is above all a domestic issue. It is an important issue on which independent observers are more trenchant than Nemyria. One says that it does not matter whether the prime minister or the president is empowered as long as the current dualism ends. “Someone”, he says, “needs to take charge”.\n\nAnother dualism frequently mentioned by Western diplomats is firmly rejected by Nemyria: the idea that Ukraine really is two countries, one in the west that looks to Europe and is ethnic Ukrainian, and one to the east that looks to Moscow and is ethnic Russian. Nemyria, himself brought up as a Russian-speaker in the industrial eastern heartland of Donetsk, is a living rebuttal of this simplistic view of his country. He warns that Russian-speaking does not equal pro-Russian.\n\nIt is a point he underlines as highly topical. There are unspoken assumptions that secessionist tendencies, especially strong on the Crimean peninsula, are being manipulated by Moscow and its allies in Ukraine. Diplomats fear that Crimea, where most of the population hold Russian passports, might be the next flashpoint after Russia’s show of force in Georgia, a point Nemyria reiterated earlier this month. He says that the European Neighbourhood Policy, the main lens through which the EU looks at Ukraine, has failed. “The EU,” he said, “has in its Black Sea policy looked at environmental protection, local border traffic and cultural exchanges. It should perhaps also ask itself what would happen if the oil stopped flowing.”"
