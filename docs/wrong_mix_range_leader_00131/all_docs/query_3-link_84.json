        "text": "Any debate that attempts to determine whose grief in the world\n\nis the most painful would be senseless: every country has its share\n\nof skeletons in the closet. How can the bleeding wound of Chechnya\n\nbe compared with the Tibetans’ tragedy, or the simmering tensions\n\nin the Chu valley with the Kosovo impasse?\n\nIn his book, Ukraine: Different from Russia, Ukrainian\n\nPresident Leonid Kuchma has attempted to identify his country’s\n\nmost acute problems with sincerity unusual for a politician. Among\n\nother things, the author discusses the persisting problems of a\n\nformer province which has yet failed to develop a new national\n\nconsciousness and recognize its national language. He looks at the\n\naftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the continued attempts\n\nto discern the country’s own past, the standoff between the\n\nfollowers of the Greek Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy,\n\ncombined with the split within Ukrainian Orthodoxy itself. Finally,\n\nKuchma analyzes more particular problems affecting his country such\n\nas the sharp contrast between the eastern and western regions of\n\nUkraine, the veterans of the so-called Ukrainian Insurgent Army,\n\nand its dependence on imports of energy resources.\n\nKuchma’s bulky work is entirely focused on the search for\n\nsolutions to these problems. As the author is trying to answer\n\nthese numerous questions, he analyzes Ukraine’s experience as an\n\nindependent country. Unlike many politicians and researchers, he\n\nbelieves that the Ukraine of the past was not a colony but, rather,\n\nan integral part of metropolitan Russia with all of the advantages\n\nand disadvantages inherent in such a position.\n\nThe author lives up to his promise: the book does not contain\n\nany anti-Russian motives, but it prompts the reader to consider the\n\npotential for protest that the Ukrainian people have accumulated\n\nover their centuries-long affiliation with the Russian Empire, as\n\nwell as their decades-long experience as a Soviet Republic. On the\n\none hand, this is also indicative of a subconscious national\n\nsentiment that can be easily dismissed as a parochial complex; on\n\nthe other hand, it cannot be ignored in specific interstate\n\nrelations.\n\nIn the preface to the book, Kuchma stresses that the most\n\ndifficult problem is shaping a Ukrainian identification and\n\npsychology, as well as developing a realization that “the nation’s\n\nvalues stand above material and social interests.” (p. 21)\n\nThe president expounds on the idea that because of Ukraine’s\n\nterritory, the size and density of its population, and, most\n\nimportantly, its national mentality, it is a more European\n\ncountry than Russia. According to the author, this is manifest, in\n\nparticular, in the absence of “a type of relations based on land\n\nregulation” within the Ukrainian communities. This factor gave rise\n\nto an individualistic sort of character trait. “Ukrainians are\n\npredisposed toward saving,” he indicates (p. 95).\n\nKuchma believes that the Ukrainian people, as well as the people\n\nin other countries of Eastern and Central Europe, have experienced\n\ndifferent types of psychological problems in the transition period\n\nthan the Russians, who, he believes, were free from the so-called\n\n“existential fear” for their future (p. 210). On the whole, the\n\nauthor makes many shrewd observations while discussing the Russian\n\nand Ukrainian national characters, but his main conclusion – that\n\nthe Russian and Ukrainian mentalities differ dramatically – seems\n\ndisputable and requiring more argumentation.\n\nKuchma surmises that all of the contradictions between Russia\n\nand Ukraine will disappear when the latter fully recognizes itself\n\nas a nation. “I don’t rule out a situation in the future… where a\n\nbridge will stretch across the Kerch Strait, and all material\n\nbarriers between our two countries will disappear,” he maintains\n\n(p. 34). However, this line was written before the Tuzla spit in\n\nthe fall of 2003.\n\nAs for now, many impediments to progress in these matters are\n\nfirmly in place, and many of them are rooted in political history.\n\nThis is partly due to the national-territorial delineation of the\n\ntwo former Soviet Republics which was imposed by the Communist\n\nParty in the 1920s. Kuchma believes the assessment of that event\n\nshould be left to historians and geographers. At the same time, a\n\nsignificant number of Ukrainians now live in the southern Russian\n\nregions of Kursk and Voronezh, as well as the former territory of\n\nthe Cossack Troop near the Don – a fact that permits Kuchma to\n\nspeak of lost opportunities. At this point, he makes reference to\n\nthe authorities of the former Byelorussian Soviet Republic who\n\nsucceeded in fully integrating all of the Byelorussian lands within\n\nthe borders of the Soviet Union (p. 450).\n\nKuchma draws the conclusion that the handover of the Crimean\n\nPeninsula was not an adequate compensation for the Kursk, Voronezh,\n\nand Don lands. He claims that the initiative for repatriating\n\nCrimea back to Ukraine in 1954 originated from the party bosses of\n\nthe region, who were guided by purely practical considerations. At\n\nthe time of the hand-over of the peninsula it was impossible (just\n\nas it is now) for the Crimean population to live without water from\n\nthe Dnieper and coal from the Donetsk coalfields. Furthermore, the\n\nregional Communist Party and administrative officials found it much\n\nmore convenient to find solutions to the Crimean economic issues in\n\nKiev rather than in Moscow.\n\nHe praises former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who thwarted\n\nthe attempts of the Communist nationalists in the Russian State\n\nDuma and beyond to turn the controversy surrounding the Crimean\n\nissue into an all-out political confrontation. On the whole, Kuchma\n\ndisplays warmth and sincerity toward Yeltsin that are rather\n\nuntypical of a president of a foreign nation. He acknowledges\n\nYeltsin’s historic role as a personality who, guided by an inherent\n\nfeeling of justice, made it possible for the former Soviet\n\nrepublics to dissolve peacefully (pp. 437-445). On the other hand,\n\nhe often argues with Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who, as Kuchma\n\nbelieves, called for the use of force in solving the Crimea\n\ndispute.\n\nIn terms of the controversies between Ukraine and Russia in the\n\ncultural sphere, Kuchma notes there is a significant imbalance of\n\ninformation between the two countries. He indicates, for example,\n\nthat the appearance of anti-Russian printed material in the\n\nUkrainian mass media produced a rather weak response in Russia,\n\nwhile anti-Ukrainian publications in the Russian mass media annoyed\n\nmany Ukrainians (p. 205). The celebration of the tenth anniversary\n\nof Ukraine’s independence went virtually unnoticed by the Russian\n\nmedia. Kuchma turns sarcastic when he writes about the Russian\n\nnationalists and chauvinists who disguise themselves under liberal\n\nbanners; he refers to such individuals as ‘obrazovantsy’ (Russian\n\nterm denoting people who have a higher education, but are void of\n\nthe traditions of genuine intellectualism).\n\nKuchma puts forth ideas about “compiling an inventory list” of\n\nUkraine’s cultural heritage; this is a rather interesting idea,\n\nhowever questionable. He believes that drafting some sort of an\n\nagreement between Ukraine, Russia and Belarus (p. 323) concerning\n\nthe joint ownership of cultural assets, accumulated over the\n\ncenturies of their co-existence as a single state could serve as a\n\npsychological landmark or a pivotal point in relations among the\n\nthree nations. This suggestion could spark questions involving the\n\nintellectual property rights of ethnic Germans, Poles and other\n\nnationalities who at one time lived in the Russian Empire and took\n\nan active part in creating its cultural and intellectual\n\nvalues.\n\nKuchma was born in a region of Ukraine where the local\n\npopulation speaks a dialect that he describes as a\n\n“Russo-Ukrainian-Belarusian blend.” This fact, no doubt, explains\n\nthe broadness of his approaches toward the Slav brothers, on the\n\none hand, and a somewhat narrow vision of the role of ethnic\n\nminorities in the country’s history, on the other (the reader may\n\narrive at such a conclusion due to the absence of relevant\n\nreferences in his book). Meanwhile, those minorities greatly\n\ncontributed to both the economic and spiritual life of Ukraine.\n\nChapter VIII of the book, titled “On National Heroes,” recounts\n\nthe life stories of the Grand Dukes of Kiev Vladimir I and Yaroslav\n\nthe Wise (the author is prepared to regard the latter as a Russian\n\nprince), as well as some other historical figures. Kuchma gives\n\nspecial attention to hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky as the creator of\n\nthe Ukrainian statehood. He calls the decision of the 1654\n\nPereyaslav Rada (Assembly of the People of Ukraine) on the\n\nreunification of the Ukrainian territory on the left bank of the\n\nDnieper with Russia, a forced and necessary compromise. Speaking of\n\nhetman Mazepa, Kuchma describes him as a Ukrainian patriot and an\n\nadvocate of national independence – an assessment that proves the\n\nvalidity of the author’s own remark that both Russian and Ukrainian\n\nexperts should establish politically correct approaches to\n\ndisputable issues. On the whole, the style of this particular\n\nchapter is reminiscent of particular reader books for children, and\n\nfalls short of expert political and economic analysis that the\n\nauthor offers in other parts of the book.\n\nAs he continues with the analysis of his nation’s history,\n\nKuchma dwells on the policy of ‘Ukrainization.’ He discusses three\n\nforms of statehood – the Central Rada (March-December 1917 and\n\nJanuary-April 1918), Skoropadsky’s Hetmanate (1917 to 1918), and\n\nthe Ukrainian Directorate (November 1918 — November 1920). He\n\ncompares these forms with later practices of the victorious\n\nBolsheviks, of whom he singles out Lazar Kaganovich,\n\nSecretary-General of the Ukrainian Communist Party after spring\n\n1925. Kuchma says Kaganovich’s ‘Ukrainization,” carried out in a\n\nStalinist fashion, “strangely enough” played a positive role in the\n\ncountry.\n\nThe author also speaks about “the agents of Russian influence” –\n\nGeorgy Pyatakov, Dmitry Manuilsky, Vlas Chubar and Emmanuil Kviring\n\n– whom he calls “internationalists in inverted commas.” At the same\n\ntime, those in the second echelon of power – Nikolai Skrypnik and\n\nGrigory Grinko – were, in Kuchma’s opinion, the pillars of solid\n\nnational consciousness and responsibility before the nation.\n\nKuchma persistently denies the conviction that is popular among\n\nUkrainians that their country was subject to colonial exploitation\n\nand national oppression. At the same time, he claims that from the\n\nvery beginning Moscow maintained a policy of suppressing any\n\nmanifestation of Ukrainian self-consciousness. As an example, he\n\nrecalls the 1757 work by Grigory Poletika titled “On the Origins,\n\nRestoration and Proliferation of Schools and Education in Russia.”\n\nKuchma says the work was never published because of Mikhail\n\nLomonosov who thwarted the attempts, “since it only mentioned\n\nKievan schools and not Moscow schools before the 17th century.”\n\nKuchma dwells in detail on the issue that is apparently both\n\nclose and painful to him – the development of the missile and\n\nnuclear industry. He discusses the correlation between its “Soviet\n\nelements” on the one side, and the “Russian and Ukrainian elements”\n\non the other; the latter include an impressive list of cosmonauts\n\nand rocket/missile technology designers of Ukrainian origin. The\n\nauthor’s position on this issue is indicative of the many lingering\n\ninferiority complexes – side-effects of the turbulent period in the\n\nformation of the Ukrainian nation-state.\n\nMuch space in Kuchma’s book is devoted to the defense industry,\n\nand Chapter XI, where he declares his views on Ukraine’s chances\n\nfor joining the ranks of the rich nations, provides a clue to the\n\nauthor’s conceptions in this field. With all of the pride of a\n\nformer industrial CEO, he recalls his former activities at the\n\nYuzhnoye design bureau and the Yuzhmash machine-building plant. He\n\ndescribes the two hi-tech companies as examples of the huge\n\npotential of the defense industry, while lamenting over the\n\ndestructive impact of the hasty and ill-conceived policy for\n\nconverting the defense industry enterprises to civilian production.\n\nAs a national leader and a professional in the defense industry,\n\nKuchma insists that the fields of “space technology,\n\naircraft-building and weapon design are areas where Ukraine and\n\nRussia could do much better by working together” (p. 357).\n\nChapter VI, titled “A Painful Road from the Ukrainian Soviet\n\nSocialist Republic to Ukraine,” reveals Kuchma’s vision of the\n\ntransition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy,\n\nwhich has thus far impoverished his country. (It is noteworthy that\n\nthe problems borne out of that transformation remain dominant\n\nwithin the entire post-socialist space.)\n\nKuchma assumes that one of the factors behind Ukraine’s current\n\nstatus as one of the poor countries was due to the financial crisis\n\nof 1997-1998. However, several pages prior to this assumption, he\n\nblames the erroneous strategy of economic and social reforms which\n\nthe leadership of sovereign Ukraine adopted by its own free will,\n\nwithout any pressure from abroad. The author believes that that\n\nchoice was quite in line with the Ukrainian “romantic” nature,\n\nwhich differs from the Russian national character.\n\nKuchma admits to the low competitiveness of the Ukrainian\n\neconomy, and blames the decline of the machine-building sector from\n\n30.7 percent in 1990 to 13.8 percent in 1999 on “the pessimists”\n\nand “the defeatists.” The former term refers to the Western\n\nexperts, while the latter to their Ukrainian adherents (p.\n\n178).\n\nKuchma sounds an air of resentment when he mentions the lifting\n\nof liquefied gas prices by Russian companies in 1998 following the\n\njumps in world crude oil prices. As a way out of the situation,\n\nKuchma names “the scaling down at least by half of the trade\n\nbarriers in the developed countries” (p. 179). Kuchma’s hurt pride\n\nis hardly understandable, especially since he concedes in another\n\npassage that the free market never makes concessions to anyone. It\n\nseems that in this situation, as on many other occasions, Kuchma is\n\ncaught in his own trap: he appears to be treating Russia not as an\n\nequal partner, but as a former metropolitan country that owes a\n\ndebt to Kiev.\n\nHow does the president view the federal structure of the\n\nUkrainian state? Today, this issue is being broadly discussed in\n\nUkrainian society, yet few dare write about it. The author insists\n\nthat turning Ukraine into a federation is impossible, since it\n\nmight trigger territorial disputes with neighboring countries.\n\nRomania, Turkey, Poland, Hungary and the Slovak Republic are making\n\nclaims for Ukrainian territories already, although so far these\n\nideas have only been voiced by radical newspapers and political\n\norganizations. Kuchma also mentions in this connection the May 21,\n\n1992 resolution by the Supreme Soviet of Russia which acknowledged\n\nthe 1954 decision to hand over the Crimea to Ukraine to be\n\nunconstitutional, and the July 9, 1993 resolution on the Russian\n\nstatus of Sevastopol.\n\nThe author offers a detailed analysis of Ukraine’s bilingualism,\n\nand forwards numerous arguments to support his thesis that giving\n\nan official status to the Russian language would be an untimely\n\ndecision.\n\nNaturally, the author is forced to consider the complicated\n\nrelations between the various religious denominations in Ukraine.\n\nHe avoids an assessment of the activities of the Uniat Church\n\n[which combines Eastern Orthodox rites with subordination to the\n\nVatican – Ed.] during World War II, but mentions the Council of\n\nBishops, convened in 1946, to revoke the Brest unification\n\nagreement of 1596 and the events that occurred after the Council\n\nmeeting. Kuchma’s presidential status implies that he should meet\n\nwith the head of the Russian Orthodox Church more often than with\n\nthe heads of the other confessions – which he actually does since\n\nthis is the most populous of all Ukrainian religious denominations.\n\nYet he cherishes the hope to see the rise of a national Ukrainian\n\nOrthodox Church at some early date (p. 491).\n\nThe reader may be surprised to learn that the Vatican maintains\n\nrelations with the Orthodox Church which reports to the Moscow\n\nPatriarchate, and does not recognize the breakaway Orthodox Church\n\nof Metropolitan Philaretos or the Church of Halichina. One can only\n\nagree with Kuchma’s declaration that “whatever the reasons for the\n\namicability and tactfulness in these relations, be it in the\n\nclerical, secular or government spheres, it is much more desirable\n\nthan pressure and offensiveness” (p. 492).\n\nKuchma insists on proceeding from the reality of the present, as\n\nopposed to the practices from the past, as “the latter approach may\n\nlead us into a deadlock” (p. 464). Although the author prefers “to\n\nclose up the issue of the historical debt,” he says that Russia has\n\ndebts to Ukraine.\n\nSpecifically, he raises the issue of overseas property of the\n\nformer Soviet Union, “the return of cultural values” (it remains\n\nunclear how this claim corresponds with his own idea of Russia’s\n\nand Ukraine’s “joint cultural ownership”), and, most importantly,\n\nthe repayment of the deposits which the Ukrainian people held in\n\nthe Soviet Union Savings Bank; this figure totaled 83.4 billion\n\nSoviet rubles as of December 31, 1991.\n\nIn conclusion, Kuchma repeats that the Ukrainian people and the\n\nRussian people have followed different historic paths, and have\n\ndifferent ethnic experiences and self-identifications. There is\n\nalso a great difference in their culture and language, their\n\nrelationships with the geographic and geopolitical environment,\n\nresource reserves, overall weight in international politics, and\n\nopportunities for mutual influences (p. 507).\n\nThis book could be the basis for a profound discussion on the\n\nhighly sensitive issue of the ethnic component in international\n\nrelations."
