        "text": "U.S. political scientist Alfred Stepan published an article soon\n\nafter Ukraine’s 2004 Orange Revolution in which he analyzed the\n\nopportunities for a policy of national construction in Ukraine\n\n(Stepan, Alfred. “Ukraine: Improbable Democratic ‘Nation-State’ But\n\nPossible Democratic ‘State-Nation’?” Post Soviet Affairs, No.\n\n4/2005, pp. 279-308). Although Stepan had never studied Ukraine\n\nbefore the article, he is an acclaimed expert on authoritarian\n\nregimes and models of their democratization.\n\nStepan’s analysis of the political situation in Ukraine rests on\n\nthe opposition between two models. One of them is the very familiar\n\n‘nation-state.’ An alternative model – the ‘state-nation’ – has\n\nbeen developed by Stepan in cooperation with his long-time\n\nco-author Juan Linz and Indian political scientist Yogendra Yadav,\n\nusing materials on Belgium, India and Spain.\n\nThe policy goal of the nation-state is to impose a powerful\n\nunited identity of society as a community of members in a nation\n\nand citizens in a state. To this end, the government conducts a\n\nhomogenizing assimilation policy in education, culture and\n\nlanguage. In electoral policies, autonomy-minded parties are not\n\nconsidered to be coalition partners, while separatist parties are\n\noutlawed or marginalized. Portugal, France, Sweden and Japan\n\nprovide bold examples of this model. This policy proceeds smoothly\n\nif the state mobilizes only one group as a carrier of cultural\n\nidentity that has political representation. This group sees itself\n\nas the only nation in the state.\n\nIf a country has two or more mobilized groups of this kind – as\n\nwas the case in Spain after General Franco’s death, in Canada\n\nduring the creation of its federation in 1867, in Belgium in the\n\nmiddle of the 20th century, or in India when it gained independence\n\n– democratic leaders have to choose between the exclusion of\n\nnationalistic groups and their integration in society. All these\n\nfour countries eventually chose a model that can be accurately\n\ndescribed as a ‘state-nation’ rather than the ‘nation-state.’ They\n\nchose to recognize more than one cultural – and even ethnic –\n\nidentity and give it institutional support. Multiple and\n\ncomplementary identities would rise up in each country. For this,\n\nthey would set up asymmetric federations, introduce the practice of\n\n‘consociative’ democracy, and have more than one official language.\n\nAutonomy-minded parties were allowed to form governments in some of\n\nthe provinces and sometimes join coalitions to form central\n\ngovernments. This model pursues the goal of breeding institutional\n\nand political loyalty to the state among different “nations” living\n\nin the state, although polity does not match the differing cultural\n\ndemoses.\n\nCountries that have recently gained independence can choose a\n\npersistent and energetic but simultaneously peaceful and democratic\n\nstrategy of building a nation-state if the policies and cultural\n\ndemos match, the political elite is united in accepting these\n\npolicies, and the international situation is not hostile to the\n\nimplementation of this strategy. However, Ukraine’s situation did\n\nnot meet a single of these criteria when it became independent.\n\nStepan underlines a basic geopolitical difference between\n\nUkraine and the countries that he and his colleagues analyzed in\n\nthe format of the state-nation model; i.e., India, Belgium, Canada\n\nand Spain. None of them had a neighbor posing a real irredentist\n\nthreat, while Ukraine faces a potential threat from Russia. This\n\nassessment should be specified: Stepan spoke of a potential\n\nirredentist threat in 2005 and admitted that neither Russia nor\n\nUkrainian citizens of Russian origin would take it seriously at the\n\ntime.\n\nStepan drew up a number of oppositions as he compared the\n\nnation-state model to the state-nation one:\n\n— Commitment to a single “cultural civilizational\n\ntradition” versus commitment to more than one such tradition; the\n\nlatter case should not block the opportunities for\n\nself-identification with a common state;\n\n— An assimilatory cultural policy versus the recognition and\n\nsupport of more than one cultural identity;\n\n— A unitary state or monoethnic federation versus a federative\n\nand often asymmetric system reflecting cultural heterogeneity.\n\nStepan said in his other works that a presidential republic is\n\nmore characteristic of nation-states, while a parliamentary\n\nrepublic is more typical of state-nations.\n\nThe general theoretic maxima Stepan formulated suggests that the\n\naggressive policies of a nation-state, are dangerous for social\n\nstability and the prospects of democratic development if the nation\n\nconcerned has more than one mobilized ethnic group. He admits that\n\nthe state-nation principle, if applied in Ukraine, would involve\n\nmaking Russian a second official language. Countries like Belgium,\n\nIndia and Switzerland have more than one official language. Stepan\n\nsaid that Ukraine would have more chances to create a democratic\n\npolitical society if it did not pursue the aggressive strategy of\n\nimposing the nation-state model.\n\nHe made a stipulation, however, when he said that a soft course\n\ntoward building a nation-state can ease the emergence of multiple\n\nand complementary identities that are vital for state-nations and\n\nfor democracy in multi-ethnic societies. According to Stepan,\n\nUkraine could be an example of such a situation.\n\nStepan offered a number of arguments to back up this\n\npostulation. He said that the preferred language of communication\n\nis not necessarily a mark of ethnic identity in Ukraine, since\n\npeople who identify themselves as Ukrainians outnumber those who\n\nonly speak Ukrainian by a factor of two. According to research, 98\n\npercent of people identifying themselves as Ukrainians – regardless\n\nof the language they speak – would like their children to speak\n\nfluent Ukrainian. The percentage of people calling themselves\n\nRussians and who would like their children to be fluent Ukrainian\n\nspeakers is also very high – 91 percent in Kyiv and 96 percent in\n\nLviv.\n\nSince the vast majority of Russophone citizens want their\n\nchildren to have a good command of Ukrainian, the state can conduct\n\na policy of imposing the language on non-speakers – in the\n\nnation-state spirit – without causing tensions between Russian and\n\nUkrainian speakers. Stepan also indicated that only five percent of\n\nrespondents in Donetsk (in Eastern Ukraine) and one percent\n\nrespondents in Lviv (in Western Ukraine) said in 2005 that it would\n\nmake sense to split Ukraine into two or more countries. At the same\n\ntime, Russia, a potential irredentist attraction, was waging a\n\nbloody war in the Caucasus and this considerably reduced its\n\nattractiveness.\n\nUKRAINIAN POLICIES: CHANGING THE MODEL\n\nA total of three years have passed since the publication of\n\nStepan’s article. Let us take a look at how the situation in\n\nUkraine has been developing since then and to what degree his\n\nforecasts have materialized.\n\nThe period from 2005-2007 was quite turbulent in the political\n\nsense. It saw a scheduled parliamentary election in 2006 and an\n\nearly election in 2007. Both elections showed that the electoral\n\nbase of all the political parties without exception remains\n\nstrictly bound to one or another macro-region.\n\nThe government of Yulia Tymoshenko, which was formed in the\n\nfollow-up to the 2004 presidential election, was dismissed some six\n\nmonths later. It did not include politicians whom the East and\n\nSouth of the country could perceive as their representatives, and\n\nthe Yuri Yekhanurov cabinet that came to replace it did not include\n\nthem either. In turn, the government formed by Victor Yanukovich\n\nafter the 2006 parliamentary election did not have any\n\nrepresentatives from Western Ukraine. The talk about a possible\n\ncoalition between the Regions Party and a part of the\n\npro-presidential Our Ukraine was short-lived.\n\nLike the Tymoshenko cabinet, the Yanukovich government gradually\n\nfound itself drawn into a bitter conflict with Ukrainian President\n\nVi?tor Yushchenko, which paved the way for the unconstitutional\n\ndissolution of parliament and early elections in 2007. This\n\nconflict was accompanied by a de facto crushing of the Constitution\n\nCourt that lost the ability to claim an independent role for\n\nitself. All the parties to the conflict made a ploy of their\n\n“petted” courts of various jurisdictions, thus further undermining\n\nthe reputation of the judiciary.\n\nUkraine started 2008 with a new cabinet with Tymoshenko at the\n\nhelm. The new government soon jumped into a conflict with the\n\nweakening president. All leading political forces were unanimous in\n\ntheir sentiment that the ?onstitution needed to be revised, but all\n\nof them had their own vision of both the mechanism of revision and\n\nthe new model of constitutional power.\n\nBefore the Verkhovna Rada, or the Ukrainian parliament, was\n\ndissolved in the summer and fall of 2007, the authorities mostly\n\nconducted a moderate policy along the nation-state model, the\n\nchances of which Stepan had assessed as fairly high. Cautious steps\n\nwere taken in the East and South to make decisions in the\n\nstate-nation vein, as a number of regions and municipalities made\n\nRussian an official language. However, on the presidential\n\nadministration’s initiative, these decisions were challenged in\n\ncourt and not endorsed by state agencies.\n\nUkrainization efforts in the areas of culture and language\n\nintensified sharply during the 2007 political crisis. The\n\ngovernment plans to change the entire higher education system over\n\nto Ukrainian in three years, and the authorities have enacted a law\n\nmandating that all distribution copies of foreign movies must be\n\ndubbed into Ukrainian. Along the same lines is a Yushchenko\n\nstatement on the dangers emanated by the Russian-speaking mass\n\nmedia – this foreshadows further cuts in Russian-language programs\n\non Ukrainian television.\n\nThe topic of the Holodomor – the famine of 1932 and 1933 – as a\n\ngenocide spearheaded at the Ukrainian people has been fanned\n\nsharply. At the very least, this makes Russians living in Ukraine\n\nuncomfortable, since talk about genocidal motives goes hand in hand\n\nwith assertions that migrants from Russia took the place of\n\nindigenous Ukrainians who were exterminated. Add to this the\n\npeople’s bitter reaction – everywhere except for Halychyna (Western\n\nUkraine) – to efforts to idolize the Ukrainian Insurgent Army\n\n(UPA), along with its notorious commander Roman Shukhevich, and\n\nStepan Bandera, the chieftain of the Organization of Ukrainian\n\nNationalists (OUN).\n\nAn unexpected surge in efforts in late 2007 to bring Ukraine\n\ninto NATO played a highly provocative role in both domestic policy\n\nand in Ukrainian-Russian relations. Moscow responded to this in the\n\nspring of 2008 with statements that stirred up irredentist elements\n\nin its policy toward Ukraine in general and the Crimea in\n\nparticular. The claims have so far come from nonofficial\n\n“spokespeople” for the Russian political establishment – Moscow\n\nMayor Yuri Luzhkov and State Duma Deputy Konstantin Zatulin.\n\nHowever, statements of concern over the position of ethnic Russians\n\nin Ukraine have come from the Russian Foreign Ministry, too.\n\nThe threat of irredentism, which Stepan described as\n\nhypothetical in 2005, is now taking increasingly clearer contours.\n\nMoscow’s activity has so far been reticent in this area, but now it\n\nseems to be willing to generate controllable tensions in the Crimea\n\nso as to amplify doubts among the leaders of many NATO countries\n\nabout the feasibility of granting NATO membership to Ukraine.\n\nUnfortunately, the Russian-Georgian conflict and the reaction it\n\nproduced in some sections of the Ukrainian leadership may lead to\n\nan escalation of all the above-mentioned conflicts and Moscow may\n\nfind itself bogged down even deeper in Ukraine’s domestic policy\n\nproblems.\n\nTHE PROSPECTS FOR A RUSSIAN PARTY\n\nOne of the most crucial issues of modern Ukrainian policy is the\n\nnature of identity, or rather the identities of people living in\n\nthe eastern and southern regions. The crux of the matter is that\n\nany discussion of the Eastern Ukrainian identity includes both\n\npeople who consider themselves to be Ukrainians by birth, but who\n\nuse the Russian language to communicate, and those who associate\n\nthemselves with the Russian nation (the 2001 census showed that 17\n\npercent of the country’s population, or 8.3 million people, belong\n\nto this category).\n\nNobody knows what might happen if Ukrainian policy continues to\n\ndevelop along the nation-state course. It is quite possible that a\n\nsizable part of Russophone Ukrainians will accept it with a larger\n\nor smaller degree of enthusiasm.\n\nBut has state policy in the area of language not stepped over\n\nthe boundary beyond, which Ukrainization begins to play a\n\nmobilizing role for the more than eight million people who consider\n\nthemselves to be Russians? The important thing for them is not the\n\nchange to Ukrainian identity, but the loss of living comfortably in\n\ncase they maintain their Russian identity.\n\nOpinion polls taken at the beginning of 2005 showed that only 17\n\npercent of ethnic Russians living in Ukraine believed that the\n\nOrange Revolution would bring anything good for them, as against 58\n\npercent of ethnic Ukrainians. Without the risk of making too big of\n\na mistake, one can state that ethnic Russians proceeded from the\n\nassumption that relations with Russia would deteriorate further and\n\nUkrainization would intensify.\n\nIt is difficult to forecast how the mood among Ukrainian\n\ncitizens who are ethnic Russians will change now that many of their\n\npast apprehensions have been proven true and Russia has begun to\n\nplay the irredentist card.\n\nGrave problems in the Ukrainian economy will most likely\n\ncontinue to spread in the mid-term, as the country will have to\n\nlive through a sharp rise in energy prices, the financial loan\n\ncrises, a steep rise in inflation, endless postponing of structural\n\nreforms and their further deferment amid conditions of political\n\ninstability and preparations for yet another election. The economic\n\nsituation in Ukraine in 2008 resembles the spring and summer in\n\nRussia in 1998.\n\nThe permanently growing gap between Ukraine and Russia in terms\n\nof people’s incomes will soon have a dangerous impact on the\n\npolitical situation in Ukraine. Add to this the removal of the\n\nfactor that repelled the Ukrainians with Russian identity – the war\n\nin Chechnya – and the reduction of military service in Russia to\n\ntwelve months.\n\nIn spring 2007, on the eve of another deterioration of the\n\npolitical crisis which occurred in the wake of the dissolution of\n\nparliament and the ensuing upswing in nationalistic policies, the\n\nRazumkov Opinion Research Center in Kyiv did some important\n\nresearch that unveils the moods that existed at the time among\n\nRussian-speaking Ukrainians and other specific population\n\ngroups.\n\nThe researchers singled out four groups:\n\n‘The Russians’ – i.e., Ukrainian citizens who are ethnic\n\nRussians and who speak Russian as their native language, associate\n\nthemselves with the Russian cultural tradition and use Russian in\n\neveryday communication;\n\n‘The Ukrainians’ – i.e., Ukrainian citizens who are ethnic\n\nUkrainians and who speak Ukrainian as their native language,\n\nassociate themselves with the Ukrainian cultural tradition and use\n\ntheir native language in everyday communication;\n\n‘Russian-speaking Ukrainians’ – i.e., people ascribing\n\nthemselves to the Ukrainian ethnos; and bilingual Ukrainians – i.e.\n\nethnic Ukrainians who speak Ukrainian as their native\n\nlanguage;\n\n‘Bilingual Ukrainians of the Ukrainian cultural tradition’ –\n\ni.e., people who say that they are ethnic Ukrainians, speak\n\nUkrainian as their native language and belong to the Ukrainian\n\ncultural tradition.\n\nThe authors of the research say quite correctly that this\n\napproach reveals clearly that the so-called ‘Russian-speaking\n\ncitizens’ are not an “imagined community“ – in the sense implied by\n\nBenedict Anderson – they are a real group sharing a common\n\nidentity. As an ‘imagined community,’ they exist only in the minds\n\nof researchers.\n\nThe last three categories of respondents – i.e., ethnic\n\nUkrainians who use Russian in everyday communication – gave\n\npractically identical answers to the question on whether they\n\nregard themselves to be Ukrainian patriots. Among those polled, 37\n\nto 42 percent gave an assured “yes” answer, 41 to 45 percent said\n\n“probably yes,” 6 to 11 percent offered a “probably no” answer, 3\n\npercent or less gave a definitive “no,” and 6 to 7 percent were\n\nundecided. In all, 80 percent of the respondents in this group\n\noffered positive answers, which almost equals the number of\n\npositive answers among ‘the Ukrainians.’\n\nThe responses of ‘the Russians’ produced a different picture, as\n\nonly 20.4 percent of them gave an assured “yes” and 29 percent\n\nanswered “probably yes.” This means that less than half of the\n\nrespondents viewed themselves as patriots. A total of 14 percent of\n\nthe Russians said overtly they did not consider themselves to be\n\npatriots of Ukraine, 27 percent said “probably no,” and 9 percent\n\ndeclined to give any answer.\n\nThe difference is still greater in terms of expectations for the\n\ndevelopment of the language and cultural situation. A mere four\n\npercent of ‘Russians’ think that Ukrainian should be the only\n\nofficial language in the country. Another 13 percent would be\n\nsatisfied if Russian were made an official language in some\n\nregions, and 70 percent said it must be the second official\n\nlanguage. Furthermore, 10 percent of the respondents believe that\n\nRussian should be the only official language in Ukraine. ‘The\n\nUkrainians’ produced a practically mirror-like picture. ‘The\n\nRussian-speaking Ukrainians’ were very close to ‘the Russians’ in\n\nthat aspect, as 49 percent of the respondents in those groups said\n\nthey were in favor of two official languages. A difference could be\n\nseen in the group of Russian-speakers who have a command of\n\nUkrainian, as only 20 percent of them showed a readiness to give\n\nRussian the status of the second official language.\n\nWhen asked the question “Which cultural tradition should prevail\n\nin Ukraine?” a mere six percent of ‘Russians’ were prepared to\n\nreconcile themselves to the absolute dominance of Ukrainian\n\nculture. Another 50 percent agreed that different cultural\n\ntraditions would prevail in different regions, and 24 percent said\n\nthe Russian tradition would prevail. In the groups who speak\n\nUkrainian, a majority of respondents invariably agree to the\n\ndominance of Ukrainian culture, although they make up the absolute\n\nmajority (59 percent) only among ‘Ukrainians.’\n\nRemarkably, in answering a question about the most preferable\n\ndefinition of the Ukrainian nation, most people in all groups\n\npreferred “a civil nation embracing all Ukrainian citizens” (‘the\n\nRussians’ and ‘Russian-speaking Ukrainians’ showed 43 percent and\n\n42 percent respectively, and other groups, 35 percent each).\n\nHowever, the aggregate number of all other answers accentuating –\n\nin some way or another – the ethnic character of the nation was\n\nbigger in the ‘Ukrainian’ groups than the percentage of answers\n\naccentuating the civil principle.\n\nOn the whole, this data confirms that ‘Russian-speaking\n\nUkrainians’ would like to see the Russian language and culture have\n\nan equal status with Ukrainian, but they are ready to tolerate\n\nnation-state policies, while the ‘Russians’ resolutely reject such\n\npolicies. It would be quite logical to suppose that a feeling of\n\ndiscomfort and the potential for irredentist mobilization has grown\n\nin the latter group over the past twelve months.\n\nLet us also pinpoint an evident disillusionment with the\n\npolicies of the Regions Party among those voters who attach\n\nsignificance to the status of the Russian language and culture. The\n\nparty has not been persistent enough in implementing its own\n\npromises in this area and it is now losing electoral support. Thus,\n\na niche emerges for a new political force that may position itself\n\nas a Russian party. As ‘the Russians’ make up 17 percent of\n\nUkraine’s population, a party like that can hope that they could\n\nform a faction in the Verkhovna Rada even if the parliamentary\n\nqualification barrier is higher than the current three percent.\n\nTHE POTENTIAL FOR INSTABILITY\n\nThe intensification of nation-state policy in Ukraine and\n\nRussia’s moves to exploit the irredentist theme have heightened the\n\nrisks in relations between the two countries over the three years\n\nthat have passed since the publication of Stepan’s article.\n\nChronologically, the whipping-up of nation-state policies by Kyiv\n\npreceded the intensification of the irredentist factor in Russia’s\n\npolicy, greased the conditions for it and partially served as its\n\ntrigger (which, however, does not pardon Russia).\n\nPresident Victor Yushchenko emanates the strongest destabilizing\n\nimpulses, as all the steps described above were initiated either by\n\nhim personally or by the small parties he still relies on.\n\nYushchenko is the main promulgator of the ‘memory revitalization\n\npolicy.’ He goes as far as to press the Rada to adopt a version of\n\nthe law on the Holodomor that would include criminal responsibility\n\nfor denying that the Holodomor was genocide. He tries to launch the\n\ndiscussion of the topic at international organizations – the UN,\n\nthe Council of Europe, and the Organization for Security and\n\nCooperation in Europe. Yushchenko personally initiated an\n\napplication to NATO for getting the Membership Action Plan (MAP),\n\nand he ardently tried to push it through at home and abroad on the\n\neve of the NATO summit in Bucharest. In the wake of the August war\n\nin Georgia, the topic of the external (Russian) threat may move\n\ncenter stage in Ukrainian policy.\n\nYushchenko does not have a majority in parliament and he rules\n\nwith the aid of decrees, many of which run counter to the\n\nConstitution. As a person who has squandered his popularity and who\n\nis struggling to stay in power, he was behind all of the\n\ndestabilizing moves in the institutional sector. The list includes\n\n– over the past twelve months alone – the unconstitutional\n\ndissolution of parliament, an attempt to steamroll his own version\n\nof the new Constitution (one that vastly broadens the presidential\n\npowers) by way of a referendum and bypassing parliament, a\n\ndiscrediting of the Constitution Court that still does not have a\n\nfull panel of judges, and permanent incursions into areas of\n\ngovernmental prerogatives.\n\nIt may look that the two largest political forces – the Yulia\n\nTymoshenko Bloc (BYT) and the Regions Party (RP) – show an\n\nunderstanding of the mechanisms that Stepan and his co-authors\n\nhighlighted in the state-nation model. Both advocate the\n\nparliamentary (or parliamentary/presidential) republic. However,\n\nwhereas the RP speaks against the buildup of a rapport with NATO,\n\nthe BYT does not show any special activity in the field and does\n\nnot emphasize the problems of the Holodomor or the Insurgent Army.\n\nThe RP objects to the Insurgent Army’s rehabilitation and to the\n\npoliticizing of the 1930s famine. Neither force has engaged in\n\nnation-state rhetoric so far. The RP supports the idea of a sizable\n\nexpansion of the powers of regions, and it has even called for\n\nfederalization during past crises, which the Orange forces regard\n\nas a manifestation of separatism. Still, there is every reason to\n\nbelieve that the idea of a federation has situational rather than\n\nfundamental importance for the Regions Party.\n\nAll of this testifies to a realistic possibility for\n\nreformatting the entire Ukrainian political scene that would help\n\nput a brake on the dangerous tendencies of 2007, yet the tough\n\npolitical standoff and the deep political mistrust existing between\n\nvarious political forces increase the chances for the further\n\ndeepening of the political crisis, and the international situation\n\nis conducive to this.\n\nAnother important destabilizing factor is the specific career of\n\nYushchenko’s main opponent, Yulia Tymoshenko. It is impossible for\n\nanyone to guarantee that she will observe democratic methods of\n\npolicymaking if she gets full power. Such apprehensions were\n\nvalidated once again in March 2008 when the BYT succeeded in\n\nremoving Kyiv Mayor Leonid Chernovetsky from office with glaring\n\nencroachments on democratic procedures. The BYT has a general\n\ntactic of undermining the positions of mayors of the largest cities\n\nif they are not its allies.\n\nMeanwhile, Stepan says that when chances are weak for\n\nfederalization due to the irredentist factor, Ukraine could use the\n\nexperience of Scandinavian countries where the absence of\n\nfederation is made up for by very broad rights for municipalities.\n\nHowever, the new mayoral election in Kyiv that reinstalled\n\nChernovetsky in office dealt a painful blow to the BYT.\n\nThe RP’s democratic conduct is also a cause for doubt. Strictly\n\nspeaking, Ukraine does not have any major political force that\n\ncould guarantee its commitment to democracy today.\n\nAll political forces struggling around mechanisms for adopting a\n\nnew Constitution and establishing its principles are mostly driven\n\nby political considerations at the moment. Remarkably, debates on\n\nthe preferable form of state structure ignore the question of a\n\npossible type of federation, and neither BYT nor RP talk about\n\nstate-nation motives when discussing the advantages of a\n\nparliamentary republic.\n\nThus we can see that many of Stepan’s forecasts and warnings\n\nhave come true over the three years that have elapsed since the\n\npublication of his article. However, two important notes should be\n\nadded to his analysis.\n\nFirst, Stepan did not take enough account of the heterogeneity\n\nof the population in Ukraine’s eastern and southern regions as\n\nregards their self-identity (although compared to other\n\nresearchers, he paid more attention to the differences in positions\n\nof the ‘Russian-speaking Ukrainians’ and ‘Russians’).\n\nSecond, it has proven difficult to remain moderate in the\n\nUkrainization policy. Stepan recommended a moderate policy in the\n\nnation-state spirit as he described a possible successful strategy\n\nfor Ukraine. He believed that the construction of a nation-state is\n\nimpossible, while the choice of a state-nation model is compounded\n\nby foreign policy factors. This political construct worked fairly\n\nwell in conditions of a relatively centralized system during the\n\npresidencies of Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma, but it turned\n\nout to be rather fragile. Amid an escalating struggle for power,\n\nYushchenko’s weakening presidential power sacrificed this moderate\n\ncourse.\n\nIf the political mobilization of Ukraine’s ethnic Russians\n\nevolves into the emergence of a Russian party, Kyiv will face a\n\ndifficult problem: meeting demands to increase the status of the\n\nRussian language and other measures in the state-nation vein will\n\nhighly impede the process of the soft Ukrainization of\n\nRussian-speaking Ukrainians that has been going on quite\n\nsuccessfully until now. On the other hand, continued Ukrainization\n\nin the nation-state mode will increase the feeling of discomfort\n\namong more than eight million Russians, thus facilitating the\n\ngrowth of irredentism.\n\nThe situation brings two problems to the foreground.\n\nFirst, how and when will the crisis of power be eliminated and\n\nwhich configuration of political forces will arise in its wake?\n\nThere is no doubt that the nation-state policy will be maintained,\n\nbut it is not clear whether the new ruling coalition will continue\n\nto intensify it or if they will try to revert to the previous\n\nmoderate course. For the time being, there seems to be little\n\nchance that Ukraine will see an early end to the political\n\ncrisis."
