The pomp and circumstance marked a real improvement in formal relations. The countries signed a treaty last May recognizing existing borders, and in February they signed a ten-year cooperation agreement that lowers barriers to trade and investment.

A spokesman for President Yeltsin quickly repudiated Luzhkov’s views, saying Sevastopol is a \"non-issue\" that was settled in the treaty.\n\nThe economic questions are largely energy-related.
