UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT YUSHCHENKO OUTLINES ECONOMIC,\n\nPOLITICAL PRIORITIES IN SPEECH AT WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM\n\nTV 5 Kanal, Kiev, Ukraine, in Ukrainian 1830 gmt 28 Jan 05\n\nBBC Monitoring Service, UK, in English, January 28, 2005 (18:30)\n\nUkrainian President Viktor Yushchenko has called EU accession a strategic\n\ngoal of his government. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos,\n\nYushchenko said Ukraine intends to apply for EU membership soon. He urged\n\nthe EU to admit Ukraine as a member. The nation has proved that its place is\n\nin Europe, he said. He went on to list his economic priorities, including\n\nliberal market reforms, the fight against corruption and making Ukraine a\n\nWTO member by the end of 2005.\n\nThe following is the text of Yushchenko's speech relayed live by Ukrainian\n\n5 Kanal TV on 28 January, subheadings have been inserted editorially:\n\nDear presidium, dear friends, guests and colleagues in this hall.\n\nOne-hundred-and-fifty years ago the Ukrainian prophet, Taras Shevchenko,\n\nsaid these words: \"Fight and win, the God will help you, the truth, strength\n\nand the holy will is with you\". We fought and won. This is perhaps the most\n\nimportant event in Ukraine in recent months.\n\nYou have just seen unique, probably unexpected for many of you, video\n\n[shown before the speech]. Millions of Ukrainians at the square in Kiev\n\ndefended their rights, their dignity and justice. They demonstrated courage,\n\ntolerance and mercy. An interesting fact is that people came to the streets\n\nnot to demand bread.\n\nThey were united by their desire to have freedom. For the sake of it they\n\novercame hunger, cold and fear. They shared bread and warmth with everybody\n\nwho came to the square and stood next to them. Armed only with belief in\n\ntheir righteousness, they defeated tyranny and lawlessness peacefully and\n\nelegantly. The whole world applauded them. A modern Ukrainian nation has\n\nrevealed itself to the world. But this victory does not belong to my people\n\nonly.\n\nA EUROPEAN NATION\n\nUkrainians have shown that European values unite people on the orange square\n\nin Kiev just as they did during the velvet revolution on Vaclav Square in\n\nPrague. If we believe that the history of mankind is the history of freedom\n\nthen Ukraine is beginning the third millennium.\n\nUkraine has shown that it belongs to the civilization of European nations.\n\nWe are not on the way to it and not on the sidelines. We are in the centre\n\nof Europe. We are on a straight path now. Ukraine's European choice was\n\nmade in the hearts and minds of Ukrainians.\n\nI have the honour to speak to you today on behalf of a free Ukraine. I\n\nbecame president by the will of its people, who chose democracy and\n\nwellbeing. I have only one goal - to implement their will.\n\nI represent one of the biggest countries in Europe. Europe's geographic\n\ncentre is located in Ukraine. Ukrainians are one of the world's\n\nbest-educated nations. We have everything it takes to be on a par with the\n\nleaders of the modern globalized world. My country has long been a wise\n\nand powerful, but sleeping elephant.\n\nToday it is awakening. Democracy paves the way to realizing its potential. I\n\nam convinced that one of the most modern European markets is being currently\n\nformed in Ukraine.\n\nBack in 2000, my government led Ukraine along the path of economic growth.\n\nThe foundation of stable GDP growth were laid at that time. Last year GDP\n\ngrew by 12.4 per cent. There are all grounds for an optimistic forecast for\n\nthe future. However, many opportunities for economic growth were lost in the\n\npast years. As a result, the economy remained disproportional and social\n\nstandards were very low. An oligarchic economic model was being formed in\n\nUkraine, its black market growing and corruption spreading.\n\nInvestors had a natural reaction to these things. The amount of direct\n\nforeign investment in Ukraine is much lower than in our neighbours. It is\n\n165 dollars per capita in Ukraine. In Russia this figure is 280 dollars, in\n\nPoland 2,100 dollars and in the Czech Republic 2,200 dollars.\n\nNEW GOVERNMENT'S PRIORITIES\n\nDear friends, the time of missed chances is over. We, together with you,\n\nare starting the time of realized opportunities. Our goal is to turn the\n\nUkrainian economy into a social and market-oriented system that will ensure\n\nits stable growth. This is our first strategic goal. To achieve this goal we\n\nare going to take a number of steps soon.\n\nFIRST, eliminating the black economy. About 55 per cent of the national\n\neconomy is in the black sector now. Taxes will be cut, but everybody will\n\npay them. Privileges for the selected few will be cancelled soon. Taxation\n\nwill be transparent and stable.\n\nThe SECOND step is renewing the foundation of macroeconomic stability.\n\nThe budget will be balanced and its stabilizing role will be increased by\n\nusing tough budget restrictions and stricter principles for state loans.\n\nThe THIRD step is the fight against corruption. My government will not\n\nsteal. Local governments will not steal. Business will be separated from\n\npolitics. We will remove excessive obstacles and excessive regulation, which\n\nis the origin of corruption. Administrative reform will make the authorities\n\nat all levels transparent.\n\nThe FOURTH step is the establishment of honest justice. We will establish\n\nan independent judiciary and complete judicial reform. Courts will become\n\neffective legal means to resolve conflicts.\n\nThe FIFTH step is attracting investment. We are interested in modern\n\ntechnology and business culture coming to our country. We will promote\n\ninvestment using legislation and economic incentives. Privatization will be\n\ntransparent. Competition of investors for lucrative companies will be\n\nhonest. A few days ago a court froze the accounts of the Kryvorizhstal\n\nplant, the privatization of which was quite dubious.\n\nTo achieve our goal we are ready to cooperate with partners from various\n\nparts of the globe.\n\nOur next strategy is to integrate more into the world economy. We will\n\nwork to receive the market economy status as soon as possible and\n\nspeed up our entry into the Word Trade Organization. This is the task\n\nfor 2005.\n\nUkraine wants to strengthen mutually beneficial partnership with all its\n\nneighbours, both in the east and in the west. We are ready to widely develop\n\nUkrainian-Russian partnership, with a view to realizing our economic\n\ninterests and maintaining peace and security in Europe. I am convinced that\n\nthis approach of ours was received with understanding during my visit to\n\nMoscow.\n\nEUROPEAN INTEGRATION\n\nThe orange revolution paved the way to a new quality of our partnership with\n\nthe united Europe. Our third strategic goal is Ukraine in the European\n\nUnion. History, economic prospects and people's interests show that the\n\nUkrainian way to the future is the way of the united Europe. A renovated\n\nUkraine hopes for support by European institutions and highly praises the\n\nsignal given by the European parliament on 13 January. I believe that\n\neveryone will support its call for giving Ukraine a clear European\n\nperspective. We welcome EU plans to develop a new strategy of relations with\n\nUkraine. We want this strategy to aim at opening the European Union's doors\n\nfor Ukraine. Ukraine is going to officially apply for EU membership soon.\n\nI would like to emphasize that Ukraine can significantly contribute to the\n\ndevelopment of a new united Europe. I will name some of these opportunities\n\nas examples.\n\nFIRST, we are proposing our help to maintain peace and security, especially\n\nin the regions that are our common neighbours. SECOND, Ukraine is ready to\n\ntake part in the implementation of European security and defence goals even\n\nmore actively. Our contribution to peacekeeping efforts in the Balkans has\n\nalready been highly praised. Ukraine is ready to maintain stable energy\n\nsupplies to Europe, offering its great transit potential. We can now start a\n\nhigh-level dialogue with everyone on all energy issues. We consider it\n\npromising to involve partners from EU countries to form a gas transport\n\nconsortium.\n\nWithout a doubt, our country will remain a reliable partner of the EU in the\n\njoint fight against international terrorism and organized crime. I am\n\nconvinced that we have great potential to implement the formula \"flourishing\n\nUkraine in successful united Europe\". We are ready to confirm the announced\n\nintentions with day-to-day work. I want to make every decision of the new\n\nauthorities a step towards the implementation of our goal.\n\nThe introduction of European social, economic and political standards will\n\nbe alpha and omega in the work of the new Ukrainian authorities. I have a\n\nteam capable of implementing my plan.\n\nWe have worked out a national strategy of European integration, which is\n\naimed at quickly achieving the requirement for EU membership. The strategy\n\ntakes into account the experience of our neighbours. It envisages specific\n\nways to achieve political and economic requirements set out in Copenhagen -\n\nharmonizing the judicial system, reforming justice and law-enforcement\n\nagencies, pursuing a balanced foreign policy and implementing necessary\n\nchanges in the work of the Ukrainian government bodies.\n\nThe new government will be working in line with this strategy. Its\n\nimplementation will be the criterion for assessing the work of all the\n\nministries. I have introduced the post of deputy prime minister for European\n\nintegration to coordinate their actions. I expect convincing results of this\n\nwork very soon.\n\nDear friends, Ukraine is beginning its movement towards extremely ambitious\n\ngoals. But I'm convinced that they are real for my government and for my\n\nnation. The will of Ukrainians who threw down the burden of the past makes\n\nthem real. The will of Ukrainians, a free European nation, makes them real.\n\nYou have seen reports from [Independence] Square. Ukrainian flags were\n\nbeside the flags of all the European countries, from Portugal to Poland.\n\nThis is a glance into the future. Ukraine opened the third millennium of\n\nEuropean history. On behalf of Ukraine, I salute you. I invite you to\n\nUkraine.\n\nDear friends, it is very important to us that you stand beside us at this\n\nmoment - which I am sure is historic not only for my country and my nation\n\nbut also for Europe. I am addressing you as president - help Ukraine and\n\nyou will soon see a beautiful European nation. Thank you. -30-\n\n==========================================================\n\n2. POLISH PRESIDENT KWASNIEWSKI BACKS UKRAINE'S MOVE\n\nTO APPLY FOR EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP\n\nAgence France Presse (AFP), Davos, Switzerland, Fri, Jan 28, 2005\n\nDAVOS - Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski on Friday backed the\n\nprospect of Ukraine's application to join the European Union just moments\n\nafter his Ukrainian counterpart announced a forthcoming bid. \"It is\n\nnecessary to start to discuss with Ukraine for the membership of Ukraine in\n\nthe European Union,\" Kwasniewski told the annual meeting of the World\n\nEconomic Forum in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos.\n\n\"We will not only support Ukraine but share our experiences, how to reach\n\nthis goal,\" he announced, following newly-elected Ukrainian President Viktor\n\nYushchenko onto the podium. Yushchenko had announced just minutes\n\nbeforehand that he would lodge an application to join the European Union\n\n\"in the near future.\"\n\nKwasniewski said: \"In my opinion, if we started to discuss with Turkey about\n\nTurkish membership of the EU, we have no argument against Ukrainian entry\n\nand membership.\" \"The question is of time, of procedures, standards, but not\n\nwhy or if,\" he added.\n\nPoland, which borders Ukraine, only joined the EU last May as part of the\n\nnow 25-nation bloc's expansion eastwards. Kwasniewski played an active\n\nrole in brokering a way out of the political crisis that arose in Ukraine\n\nafter its controversial election in November, which eventually led to\n\nYushchenko, the reformist challenger, acceding to the presidency. Last\n\nmonth, the Polish leader said in a magazine interview that the EU should\n\nadopt a \"more daring plan of action\" towards his eastern European neighbour,\n\nand set a date to begin negotiations about \"possible accession\". -30-\n\n==========================================================\n\n3.

EU TO APPROVE FRESH HELP FOR UKRAINE\n\nAgence France Presse (AFP), Brussels, Belgium, Thu, Jan 27, 2005\n\nBRUSSELS - European Union (EU) foreign ministers are expected to\n\napprove a package of new initiatives next week to help Ukraine following\n\nthe inauguration of President Viktor Yushchenko, a senior diplomat said\n\nThursday. But no EU movement is expected on Yushchenko's stated aim of\n\none day winning membership of the European club for his ex-Soviet country,\n\na call which EU leaders have dismissed as premature.\n\nThe 10-point plan to be discussed Monday includes measures to help Ukraine\n\nsecure market economy status and boost its chances of joining the World\n\nTrade Organization (WTO), said the diplomat from the EU's Luxembourg\n\npresidency.\n\nEasing visa restrictions for Ukrainians is also among the proposals, to be\n\npresented by EU foreign policy chief Javier and Solana and external\n\nrelations commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner to regular ministerial talks\n\nin Brussels. \"There is no doubt that they will be warmly welcomed,\" said the\n\ndiplomat, adding: \"We will discuss how we can move forward and contribute\n\nmore to help the new Ukrainian government.\"\n\nThe ex-Soviet republic resolved two months of political crisis last weekend\n\nwhen Yushchenko was sworn in as head of state, after winning December\n\n26 ballots organized following initial rigged polls in November.\n\nIn response the European Commission and Solana drew up the new proposals,\n\nto reinforce an action plan for Ukraine approved last month in the framework\n\nof the EU's so-called \"neighbourhood policy\" for states just outside its\n\nborders. But the EU commission has insisted that it is far too early to\n\ndiscuss the possibility of EU candidacy for Ukraine. \"Monday's meeting has\n\nto be seen a step along the road\" for Ukraine's EU hopes, said the diplomat,\n\nnoting the issue will be discussed again at the next regular ministers'\n\ntalks February 21, to which Ukraine is to send a delegation. -30-\n\n==========================================================\n\n6. \"AFTER THE VICTORY PARTIES IN UKRAINE\"\n\nEDITORIAL: The New York Times\n\nNew York, New York, Friday, January 28, 2005\n\nIt took impressive personal courage for Viktor Yushchenko to overcome a\n\nnearly fatal poisoning and brazen electoral fraud to become Ukraine's new\n\npresident. It will now take extraordinary political agility for him to begin\n\ndelivering on the huge expectations that accompany him into office. He\n\nneeds to strike out boldly in several very different directions: healing the\n\ngeographic and political divisions accentuated by the campaign, rooting out\n\nentrenched government and business corruption, and charting a course\n\ntoward eventual European Union membership without alienating Russia.\n\nMr. Yushchenko is off to a fairly encouraging start. His inaugural speech\n\nlast Sunday was broadly conciliatory and emphasized clean government\n\nand rule of law. The next day, he took a symbolically significant trip to\n\nMoscow, where he spoke of Russia as Ukraine's \"eternal strategic partner.\"\n\nRussia's president, Vladimir Putin, wisely extricated himself from his\n\nearlier ham-handed support for Mr. Yushchenko's opponent and the\n\nelectoral manipulations staged in his behalf.\n\nOn a more troubling note, Mr. Yushchenko nominated Yulia Tymoshenko,\n\nan outspoken and ambitious ally, as prime minister. That choice is\n\nespecially significant because some presidential powers were transferred to\n\nParliament last month, enhancing the prime minister's stature. Ms.\n\nTymoshenko could become still more powerful if the dioxin poisoning Mr.\n\nYushchenko suffered last year should leave him with serious, lasting health\n\nproblems.\n\nMs. Tymoshenko is a divisive figure who rose to prominence in the 1990's as\n\na rich and powerful energy executive. She has gone from being an ally of a\n\ncorrupt prime minister to a fighter of corruption, then was briefly jailed\n\non fraud and money-laundering charges that she insists were political, and\n\nwere dismissed. But the problem with her nomination lies less in these\n\ndistant events than in Ms. Tymoshenko's demagogic and uncompromising\n\nspeeches over the past few weeks. She had publicly boasted that Mr.\n\nYushchenko had pledged to make her prime minister in a deal he could not\n\nwithdraw. He must now make sure she understands that he, not she, will be\n\nsetting the ultimate direction of Ukrainian policy.\n\nNational reconciliation must be more than a slogan in a country where most\n\nof the industry and wealth are located in regions that voted overwhelmingly\n\nagainst Mr. Yushchenko. It is there, especially, that Ms. Tymoshenko is seen\n\nas needlessly divisive. She now needs to erase that impression by loyally\n\ncarrying out Mr. Yushchenko's policies. -30-\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/28/opinion/28fri3.html?oref=login\n\n==========================================================\n\n7. \"YUSHCHENKO'S AUSCHWITZ CONNECTION\"\n\nBy Malcolm Haslett, BBC Eurasia analyst\n\nBBC NEWS, EUROPE, UK, Friday, January 28, 2005\n\nOne of the world leaders attending the Holocaust memorial ceremonies at\n\nAuschwitz on Thursday had a particular personal link with the camp. The\n\nfather of new Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko was a prisoner there.\n\nMr Yushchenko has put a heavy emphasis on his father's internment in\n\nAuschwitz, and for obvious reasons. In the past, his opponents have depicted\n\nhim not just as a right-wing nationalist working for the US, but as a Nazi,\n\nplain and simple.\n\nDuring the recent election campaign billboards in the eastern city of\n\nDonetsk portrayed Mr Yushchenko in Nazi uniform giving a Nazi salute.\n\nOpponents in Ukraine and Russia have also played on his wife's US\n\ncitizenship and her alleged connections with American right-wing circles.\n\nNAZI VICTIM\n\nIn 2001, the Russian television presenter Mikhail Leontiev, known for his\n\ncontroversial pro-Kremlin sympathies, accused Mrs Kateryna Yushchenko\n\nof being a \"CIA agent\" sent to Ukraine to bring her husband to power. Mrs\n\nYushchenko won a libel case in a Ukrainian court against Mr Leontiev and his\n\nOdnako\" [However] programme.\n\nBut that did not end the accusations, which reached a new high point in the\n\nrun-up to the election. To bolster their accusations, Mr Yushchenko's\n\ndetractors pointed to the undeniable fact that right-wing nationalist groups\n\nin the Ukraine, such as UNA-UNSO (Ukrainian National Association), clearly\n\nsupported Mr Yushchenko rather than the Russian-backed candidate Viktor\n\nYanukovych.\n\nMr Yushchenko has tried all along to distance himself from the extreme\n\nright, and at one point told UNA-UNSO to go and campaign for his opponent\n\ninstead. The chance to advertise his father's imprisonment and suffering in\n\nNazi concentration camps has now given his case a strong fillip.\n\nBut his opponents have also been trying to imply that his wife's family has\n\nshady secrets. There have been suggestions that hers parents, who emigrated\n\nto the US from Germany in the 1950s, had either collaborated with the Nazis\n\nor at the very least shown disloyalty to their homeland by not returning\n\nhome after the war.\n\nCREDIBILITY\n\nMrs Yushchenko, however, has pointed out that many thousands of Ukrainians\n\nwere taken to Germany during the war as slave labour, and those who returned\n\nto Stalin's USSR after the war often ended up being sent back to work\n\ncamps - these ones run by the Soviets.\n\nIn his speech at Auschwitz, Mr Yushchenko pledged to work for the\n\nelimination in Ukraine of \"anti-Semitism, xenophobia and hatred among\n\npeople\". That will not stop the new president's opponents from continuing\n\ntheir attacks on his integrity. Yet in the eyes of international opinion,\n\nthe episode of Mr Yushchenko's poisoning last October, and the admitted\n\nfraud in the first count, give the new Ukrainian president a huge advantage\n\nover his critics in terms of credibility. -30-\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLINK: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4215101.stm\n\nNOTE: There are two photographs with this article.\n\n==========================================================\n\n8. \"THE WORLD REMEMBERS\"\n\nBy Ian Traynor in Auschwitz\n\nThe Guardian, London, UK, Friday, Jan 28, 2005\n\nWhite snow and black iron, white birches and black stone, white hair and\n\nblack hats of the last witnesses: Auschwitz yesterday was a monochrome\n\ntableau drained of colour except for the brown brick of the barracks where\n\nhundreds of thousands waited to be murdered.\n\nSeveral hundred survivors and the few living liberators of the death camp\n\nconverged on the geometric expanse of barracks, furnaces, watchtowers and\n\nbarbed wire that started to give up its awful secrets to an exhausted Europe\n\n60 years ago.\n\nPolitical leaders, royals and clergymen converged on the sprawling complex\n\non the flat land between the rivers Vistula and Sola in southern Poland for\n\nthe largest and last such commemoration of the wickedness that humans can\n\ninflict on one another.\n\nFor many of those bearing witness in the heart of Europe's darkness, this\n\nwas a final farewell and an attempt at a last act of catharsis through\n\nprivate ritual, a dread-filled pilgrimage back to the nightmare years of\n\ntheir youth. Survivors in their 70s and 80s came from nearby Ukraine and\n\nfaraway Venezuela, from Poland itself and Canada, from Israel, of course,\n\nand from Britain.\n\nSome came eagerly, determined to confront past horrors. Some were intensely\n\nreluctant and frightened, but showed up out of a sense of duty and also the\n\nfeeling that this was some kind of last chance.\n\nOlly Ritterband made it from Copenhagen to the black iron gates of the death\n\ncamp. Then she could go no further. \"I don't want to go into the camp. I\n\njust can't do it. Enough is enough,\" said the 81-year-old Transylvanian Jew\n\nwho survived internment at Auschwitz but who lost 70 family members here\n\nand in other Nazi concentration camps.\n\nAlso 81, Zygmunt Soboleski, a Polish Catholic interned at Auschwitz for\n\nalmost five years, paid for her trip from Calgary in Canada, driven by the\n\nurge to remember and to warn a world he thinks is sinking into amnesia.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" he said. \"So many young people have never heard of the word\n\nAuschwitz. We're so obsessed with the tsunami. But more people were being\n\nkilled here every month and nobody cared a damn about it.\"\n\nThe first blizzards of 2005 blanketed the camp in a deep covering of snow,\n\nadding to the hush. The ageing survivors hobbled down the paths, some\n\nwearing the grey-and-white striped caps of the concentration camp inmate,\n\nto stand in temperatures touching minus 10C (14F).\n\nRussian, American, Jewish and Polish leaders paid tribute to the survivors.\n\nA German Romany leader made a poignant speech about the relatively\n\nignored mass murder of Gypsies.\n\nThree of the seven surviving Red Army soldiers who were the first allied\n\nsoldiers to fight their way to the gates of the camp on January 27 1945 were\n\nalso in attendance, their chests proud with medals. The Polish president,\n\nAlexander Kwas niewski, added to their collection.\n\nIf the dominant note was one of remembrance and bearing witness, the\n\npolitical leaders were also not slow to draw pointed parallels with\n\ncontemporary troubles.\n\n\"The story of the camps reminds us that evil is real and must be called by\n\nits name and must be confronted,\" the US vice-president, Dick Cheney,\n\ndeclared. President Vladimir Putin of Russia was even more explicit,\n\ndeclaring that terrorism is the new fascism. \"The terrorists have picked up\n\nthe baton of the executioners in black uniforms,\" he stated.\n\n\"We can only preserve our civilisation by dismissing all secondary\n\ndisagreements and rallying against the common enemy, like we did in the\n\nsecond world war.\"\n\nFor Viktor Yushchenko, the new president of neighbouring Ukraine,\n\nyesterday's ceremonies were of a personal nature. His father was Auschwitz\n\nprisoner number 11367. \"This is a sacred place for me and my family. I came\n\nhere with my children and I hope to come here with my grandchildren.\" Under\n\nhis presidency, he vowed: \"There will never again be a Jewish question in my\n\ncountry.\"\n\nThe problem of contemporary anti-Jewish prejudice, especially in Europe, was\n\na thread that ran through the speeches of the Israeli and Jewish leaders, as\n\nwell as being voiced by ageing camp survivors.\n\nMoshe Katsav, the president of Israel, said: \"We fear anti-semitism. We fear\n\nHolocaust denial. We fear a distorted approach by the youth of Europe. We\n\ncall upon the European Union: do not let Nazism dwell in the imaginations of\n\nthe young generations as a horror show.\"\n\nSurvivors said they had come to Auschwitz partly to sound the alarm for\n\nyounger people lacking awareness of the war years. \"The world never learns.\n\nThere's nothing new under the sun,\" said Trudy Spira, a camp survivor living\n\nin Venezuela. \"I just don't like it when they compare the Holocaust with any\n\nother event since, before, or after.\"\n\nThe reasons for such sentiment are not hard to find in a place where the\n\ngold teeth fillings of Jewish victims were smelted down, and women and\n\nchildren became the human guinea pigs for the deranged medical experiments\n\nof SS doctors. Of the estimated 1.5 million murdered over five years at\n\nAuschwitz, 93% were Jews. And yet, until democracy came to Poland 15\n\nyears ago, the information listed at the camp museum described the victims\n\nonly by nationality.\n\nLast night, as three hours of speeches and ceremonies came to a close, the\n\ndark skies over Auschwitz were lit up by a corridor of fire along a mile of\n\nrailway track that brought the trains to the gas chambers. The ceremonies\n\nhad opened with the sound of a train arriving at the point where the\n\nprisoners were \"selected\".\n\nMrs Ritterband, although she could not step inside Auschwitz, was none the\n\nless satisfied that she had come, a final gesture of closure. She bears no\n\nill will towards the Germans, she said. Indeed, the main lesson she has\n\nlearned from the evil she survived 60 years ago is that hatred is the\n\nbiggest enemy of life.\n\n\"I wanted to live. I wanted to continue living. And to do that it is\n\nimportant not to hate.\" -30- [Action Ukraine Report Monitoring Service]\n\n==========================================================\n\n9. 'I CAN'T GET USED TO MY FACE': YUSHCHENKO\n\nPOISONED UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT\n\nAgence France Presse (AFP), Strasbourg, France, Tue, January 25, 2005\n\nSTRASBOURG - Viktor Yushchenko, the newly elected president of\n\nUkraine, said Tuesday he still has not come to terms with his disfigured\n\nface resulting from a poison he was administered during his campaigning\n\non a pro-West ticket. \"Frankly, I can't get used to this face, and I don't\n\nthink I ever will get used to it,\" he told a media conference in Strasbourg\n\nafter addressing the parliament of the 46-member state Council of Europe.\n\nBut,\" he added, \"we are men and we don't make a big deal over our scars.\"\n\nYushchenko, 50, underwent a dramatic transformation within days in early\n\nSeptember, his once telegenic good looks bloating up and his skin becoming\n\nockmarked so that he looked much older. After months of tests, doctors in\n\nan Austrian clinic concluded that he had been deliberately poisoned with a\n\ndioxin.\n\nSpeculation focused on Ukraine's SBU intelligence service, an heir to the\n\nnational branch of the Soviet Union's KGB, with many of Yushchenko's\n\nsupporters believing it was a failed assassination bid by those who did not\n\nwant Ukraine to fall out of Russia's influence. After a rigged presidential\n\nelection in November that led to a re-run in December, Yushchenko was\n\nultimately voted president of Ukraine, taking over from retiring autocrat\n\nLeonid Kuchma and defeating the pro-Moscow candidate, former prime\n\nminister Viktor Yanukovich.\n\nBut he continues to have deformed features, drawing sympathy and curious\n\ngazes wherever he goes. In the media conference, Yushchenko read out a\n\ncertificate from his doctor stating that his condition was not contagious\n\nand he was able to fulfil his presidential duties. As for the SBU,\n\nYushchenko warned \"we are going to reform\" it. -30-\n\n==========================================================\n\n10. \"THE MAN WHO SURVIVED RUSSIA'S POISON CHALICE\"\n\nOn the day of Viktor Yushchenko's inauguration, Tom Mangold\n\nreveals the extraordinary story of his rivals' plot to deny him power.\n\nArticle by Tom Mangold, The Age\n\nMelbourne, Victoria, Australia, Sunday, January 23, 2005\n\nThe big khaki tents are coming down in Independence Square and the braziers\n\nare being doused. The Orange Revolutionaries, shrunk from half a million to\n\na few hundred, are going home.\n\nIt's inauguration day for new President Viktor Yushchenko, Ukraine's\n\nmodernist President, a reformer who beat a brutal and medieval assassination\n\nattempt by poisoning and an outrageous example of poll rigging last November\n\nto become Ukraine's new leader.\n\nAnd only now are the astonishing truths of Mr Yushchenko's fight for the\n\nleadership he had earned being revealed.\n\nAn investigation has discovered:\n\n· Britain's germ warfare laboratory in Porton Down has received a biopsy of\n\nhis skin which shows several poisoning attempts over a four-week period.\n\n· Not one but two deadly poisons have been found in his body.\n\n· Evidence has emerged that seems to link one of Russian President Vladimir\n\nPutin's closest staff members to the murder plot.\n\nAs Mr Yushchenko's face erupted in a mask of cysts and pustules and even\n\nas he fought for his life, his nation came dangerously close to a civil war\n\ndeliberately engineered by his political enemies.\n\nWhat stopped a war that could have torn this crucial state bordering western\n\nand eastern Europe apart was a series of extraordinary co-ordinated\n\nintelligence operations. Those operations involved a breakaway faction of\n\nUkraine's Secret Service, the SBU, Ukraine's military intelligence, with CIA\n\nand MI6 officers. They helped by running their own special operations to\n\nfrustrate corrupt politicians and gangsters who tried to seize power from\n\nthe newly elected leader.\n\nAmerican and British agents used spy satellites, intercept technology and\n\nold-fashioned dirty tricks against President Leonid Kuchma, the departing\n\nleader, and his allies and cronies. In the end, Mr Kuchma's power and\n\nauthority simply hemorrhaged away and he was left unable to exercise his\n\nauthority.\n\nMr Yushchenko was given a large final dose of a deadly toxin at a dinner on\n\nSeptember 5 organised by the leader of the SBU, General Ihor Smeshko, and\n\nhis deputy, General Volodymyr Satsyuk, at the latter's Kiev dacha. General\n\nSmeshko is believed to have been unaware of the poison plot. Both the cook\n\nand the waiter that night have been spirited out of the country by Mr\n\nYushchenko's team and have written admissions of involvement. The amount\n\nof poison needed to kill him was the size of a poppy seed.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Professor Mykola Policshuk, the leading authority\n\non the Parliamentary Special Investigation Commission into Mr Yushchenko's\n\npoisoning, said: \"Two, not one, poisons have been found in his tissue\n\nsamples. I have not the slightest doubt this was an attempt to murder him.\n\nThe plan was to give a huge dose at that dinner party so he would die the\n\nnext day and be buried without the kind of post-mortem examination that\n\nwould have revealed the dioxin and the other poison - an endo-toxin.\n\n\"What may have saved his life was that he vomited on the way home. Either\n\nway, it's a miracle he lived.\"\n\nIn another interview, Mr Yushchenko's head of security, Yevhen Chervonenko,\n\nrevealed how he had been tricked out of attending that dinner.\n\n\"I was in the car behind Yushchenko and his state bodyguard when I got a\n\ncall from the bodyguard telling me I was not required on that night because\n\nYushchenko was going to a secret meeting. Normally, I go everywhere with\n\nhim and taste his food.\n\n\"That night, I was deliberately cut out. When my boss got to the dacha, his\n\nbodyguard was ordered to stay in the car. Yushchenko was on his own, he had\n\nhis own plate of food. If I had been there, this could never have happened.\"\n\nThe man in charge of the commission of investigation, a supporter of rival\n\ncandidate Victor Yanukovich said: \"I don't think Yushchenko was poisoned.\n\nI've had no official papers to prove it. Look here, I've got his medical\n\nrecords, he was a sick man. Look at this, he had a lot of herpes zoster -\n\nthat could have been behind the so-called poisoning.\"\n\nThe plans to prevent the great presidential robbery of Ukraine and protect\n\nthe people's rightfully elected leader were hatched mid-year. Washington and\n\nLondon, mindful of Mr Kuchma's unappetising record as a corrupt arms dealer\n\nand implicated in several murders, gently warned him that if any attempt\n\nwere made to rig the election, he would find himself disgraced and isolated.\n\nTo press the point, one of Mr Kuchma's closest business associates suddenly\n\nfound he could not get a visa to visit the US. The message was deliberate\n\nand clear.\n\nNevertheless, Mr Kuchma and Viktor Medvedchuk, his gatekeeper and chief\n\nof staff, became involved in a colossal election fraud, so blatant it was\n\neasily spotted by the hundreds of independent election monitors last year.\n\nMr Putin also took a deep interest in the election in a border nation whose\n\nallegiance between the East and the West is almost split. The miners of the\n\nEast look to Russia. Mr Putin noisily supported their candidate, Mr\n\nYanukovich.\n\nShortly before Christmas, a courier arrived at the security gate of\n\nUkraine's Channel 5 carrying an anonymous letter written in Russian and a\n\nCD. The CD had extracts of intercepted phone conversations between two men,\n\none in Moscow and one in Kiev, talking about the poisoning of Mr Yushchenko.\n\nOne name mentioned on the CD is that of Gleb Pavlovskiy, a close adviser to\n\nPresident Putin.\n\nI have listened to the CD and I have the transcript. Although its bona fides\n\nhave yet to be forensically tested, diplomats in Kiev who have heard it and\n\nread the transcripts take it seriously.\n\nVolodymyr Ariev, the Channel 5 journalist who has investigated the\n\nbackground, said: \"I now know the identity of both men on the intercept. The\n\nman in Kiev has admitted to me that the conversation is real and that Moscow\n\nwas indeed involved in the poisoning, but it doesn't follow that Putin knew\n\nor ordered it.\n\n\"The recording was done by a rogue faction of the FSB (the replacement to\n\nthe KGB) who are opposed to Putin and Pavlovskiy.\"\n\nIf the Kremlin did have a hand in the events in Ukraine, as most observers\n\nnow believe, they unwittingly came across a series of Western intelligence\n\noperations that simply outsmarted them.\n\nBy November, an important section of the SBU had veered away from Mr\n\nKuchma's tyrannies and believed the future lay with modernist reformers like\n\nMr Yushchenko. Some of this may have been self-serving, but it was realistic\n\nand was encouraged by small teams of CIA and MI6 officers sent to back up\n\ntheir respective stations in Kiev for the most important elections in 20\n\nyears.\n\nAn intelligence net involving Mr Yushchenko's youthful and energetic chief\n\nof staff, Oleg Rybachuk, an important faction of the SBU, Ukrainian military\n\nintelligence and British and US ambassadors was established. When Mr\n\nRybachuk received SBU warnings of attempts to disrupt the elections or\n\nthreats to Mr Yushchenko, he reported these to both ambassadors.\n\nSpy satellites maintained round-the-clock vigilance and Western teams inside\n\nUkraine established an enormous communications intercept. Slowly it became\n\nclear that a substantial number of Mr Kuchma's players were deserting his\n\nteam.\n\nWashington and London told Mr Kuchma: \"We have no horses in the election\n\nrace, and we will work with whoever wins - legitimately. But one hint of\n\nelection fraud or hanky-panky and the West will be tough on you. Your\n\ncountry deserves a fully transparent and democratic poll - at last.\"\n\nThe British warned the much disliked Minister of the Interior, General\n\nMykola Bilokon, that if he misbehaved he would find unusual difficulties in\n\never getting a visa to visit any West European country or the US.\n\nSo monitors were astonished when, despite the gentle warnings, the first\n\nelection round showed blatant evidence of crude election rigging and fraud.\n\nWhy did Mr Kuchma still allow it? One observer told me: \"Because he had to,\n\nhe could not have won any other way.\"\n\nAfter the fraudulent \"win\" by Mr Yanukovich, Ukraine began to spiral into\n\nconflict. Half a million supporters of Mr Yushchenko and democracy - the\n\nOrange Revolutionaries - gathered in Independence Square, thousands\n\ncamped there. Tents, stoves, food, medical supplies, polystyrene boards\n\nfor sleeping on in the bitter cold arrived as if my magic. In fact, much had\n\nbeen planned.\n\nWestern intelligence officers had one overriding aim - to ensure that the\n\nthousands of protesters would not be provoked into violence. They believed\n\nthat if the young people held, the country would hold.\n\nAnd indeed, an extraordinary discipline was maintained among the thousands\n\nof revolutionaries - much of it exercised by an intriguing activist\n\norganisation called PORA. This largely unknown student organisation (there\n\nare no members) organised revolutionaries along para-military lines. Sex,\n\ndrugs and alcohol, but not rock'n'roll were forbidden. Skinhead and secret\n\npolice provocations were ignored.\n\nWestern intelligence officers had recommended constant music and rock\n\nconcerts to distract the huge crowd, which virtually owned the heart of\n\nKiev. My conversations with PORA leaders reveal that some of them attended\n\na seminar in the Crimea funded by the American Freedom House Foundation -\n\nwhose chairman is former CIA chief James Woolsey, and USAID, where these\n\ntechniques were taught.\n\nAs support for Mr Yushchenko grew daily, the Yanukovich-Kuchma faction\n\nbecame more desperate. They decided to transport miners from Donetsk on the\n\nRussian border and diehard Yanukovich supporters to Kiev to\n\ncounter-demonstrate the students. The intention was clear - they would spark\n\na conflict and violence and crack down on the peaceful Orange\n\nRevolutionaries. The fighting would not just crack skulls, it would lead to\n\na suspension of Parliament, of the elections, a one-year state of emergency\n\nand the continued rule of President Kuchma.\n\nThen a curious thing happened. As the miners gathered in Donetsk, free vodka\n\nwas handed out. They got vodka on their coaches and trains, and they were\n\nmet in Kiev by trucks loaded with crates of vodka. By the time they had been\n\nin Kiev for an hour or so, most were paralytically drunk.\n\n\"No, the vodka was not a coincidence,\" said Alex Kiselev, a close adviser to\n\nYushchenko rival Yanukovich, glumly. \"We realised what was going on too\n\nlate. It wasn't illegal but it was damned clever. It was a trick and we were\n\ndumb enough to fall for it, we shot ourselves in the foot with that one. It\n\nwas all very scripted. There were hundreds of Western agents in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe miners' fiasco increased Mr Kuchma's desperation. The fraudulent\n\nelection had been exposed, Mr Yushchenko was still alive, although very ill\n\nand in considerable pain; the poisoning had become public knowledge,\n\nsympathy for the victim had grown, and the fingers pointed openly at Kuchma\n\ncronies. Moscow was being dragged in too.\n\nThen on November 28, the Empire struck back.\n\nAround 10pm, the commander of the Minister of the Interior's ample forces,\n\nLieutenant-General Serhiy Popkov, ordered that live ammunition be handed\n\nout to 13,000 of his men waiting at bases outside Kiev.\n\nBut so penetrated was the ministry that within 45 minutes the phones were\n\nringing in the homes of leading Western diplomats in Kiev. They learned that\n\nGeneral Popkov's men were marching towards Independence Square. The\n\ncrackdown had begun.\n\nWashington alerted its ambassador to satellite imagery, which confirmed his\n\nworst fears. Infra-red cameras had picked up the telltale signs of trucks on\n\nthe move despite the clouds and despite the night.\n\nThe ambassador reportedly alerted Secretary of State Colin Powell, who put\n\na call into Mr Kuchma, who refused to take it.\n\nThe ambassador called Viktor Pinchuk, the President's powerful son-in-law,\n\nand warned him that Mr Kuchma would not be let off the hook by ignoring the\n\ncall from the Secretary of State.\n\nIn urgent meetings and telephone calls, Mr Kuchma, his hard-line Minister of\n\nthe Interior, General Popkov and Mr Medvedchuk were made painfully aware\n\nthat a substantial part of the SBU and military intelligence were now out of\n\nGovernment control.\n\nThe crunch came when Mr Kuchma learned from his top generals that they could\n\nnot support an attack on the Orange Revolutionaries and they would protect\n\n\"the innocent public\".\n\nHis authority had leaked away. The SBU, the army, the outside world and the\n\npeople who voted for change had finally defeated one of the most corrupt\n\ngangster-states in the world.\n\nFirst thing tomorrow, Mr Yushchenko's bodyguard will be changed.\n\nSomeone from his entourage has had access to his food and this will stop.\n\nHis final victory has already brought about a significant reaction. After\n\nthe Yushchenko victory, Minister of Transport Heorhiy Kirpa blew his brains\n\nout in his sauna. He had been associated with allegations of extensive\n\ncorruption.\n\nAlthough Mr Yushchenko is anxious to keep Moscow on side, his inauguration\n\nhas been a triumph for the man, the new machine, for those in the West who\n\nbelieve it helps to give democracy a gentle shove now and then and for 48\n\nmillion Ukrainians who will begin to taste freedom for the first time. -30-\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLINK: www.theage.com.au\n\n==========================================================\n\n11. \"YUSHCHENKO'S POISONING: THE BACKGROUND\"\n\nJane's Intelligence Digest, UK, Friday, January 21, 2005\n\nWestern governments and international organisations were shocked to hear\n\nconfirmation in December from an internationally respected Viennese medical\n\nclinic that Ukrainian opposition winner Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned four\n\nmonths earlier. JID's regional correspondent reports on allegations that\n\nwill have serious repercussions in post-election Ukraine.\n\n\"This was a project of political murder prepared by the authorities,\"\n\nYushchenko claimed. Meanwhile, Western governments have called for those\n\nbehind the poisoning to be brought to justice. This is now more likely after\n\nYushchenko's victory in the re-run Ukrainian elections, which took place on\n\n26 December.\n\nYushchenko himself has warned: \"I have no doubt that, within several days\n\nor weeks, this path will lead the authorities to specific people\n\nrepresenting the government - who administered the poison, who was\n\ninvolved and from whom the poison was procured.\"\n\nThe Soviet record of assassinating opponents abroad is long and very well\n\ndocumented. Four Ukrainian nationalist leaders were assassinated by the\n\nSoviet security services between 1926 and 1959 in Paris, Rotterdam and\n\nMunich. Two of these assassinations were carried out in Munich with a gun\n\nthat sprayed heart attack-inducing poison into the face of the victim. The\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA) became aware of the poison only after a\n\nKGB assassin who had previously used it defected to the US in 1961.\n\nUnder President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer, this practice has\n\nreturned. Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) agents were arrested in\n\nQatar in February, after being accused of assassinating a Chechen exile.\n\nIn Ukraine, opponents of the outgoing administration have either died at the\n\nhands of a Ministry of Interior Spetsnaz special forces unit, or as a result\n\nof attacks carried out by so-called 'skinheads' linked to organised criminal\n\ngangs. In March 1999, opposition Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil died in\n\na car 'accident', after the vehicle in which he was travelling was hit by a\n\nKamaz truck, a heavy-duty vehicle that has figured in many 'accidents' in\n\nUkraine. An attempt to kill Yushchenko in early August using a Kamaz truck\n\nfailed.\n\nA videotape interview of Ministry of Interior Spetsnaz officers admitting to\n\norganising Chornovil's murder was passed in 1999 to then opposition\n\npresidential candidate and former Security Service (SBU) chairman Yevhen\n\nMarchuk. This potentially explosive tape is expected to be released to the\n\nincoming Yushchenko administration once it re-opens investigations into a\n\nseries of alleged political murders.\n\nTHE ATTEMPT ON YUSHCHENKO\n\nIt now seems likely that Yushchenko was either poisoned during a trip to\n\nCrimea in late August 2004 or at a dinner. Ministry of Interior officers\n\nwere caught carrying out a surveillance operation against Yushchenko in\n\nCrimea.\n\nThe poison involved - TCDD, the most toxic form of dioxin - can take up to\n\ntwo weeks to take effect. TCDD was also a key ingredient of Agent Orange,\n\nwhich was used by US forces during the Vietnam War. The level of this dioxin\n\nfound in samples taken from Yushchenko was 6,000 times higher than normal\n\nand the second highest ever recorded.\n\nOn audio tapes illicitly made in pro-Moscow Prime Minister Viktor\n\nYanukovych's secret campaign headquarters by elements of the SBU loyal to\n\nYushchenko, there is evidence that may provide clues. There was a\n\nconversation concerning surveillance of Yushchenko's election headquarters\n\nin Kiev and ways to carry out a secret operation against him. Those recorded\n\nspeaking on the tapes complain about the presence of a bank's video security\n\ncameras close to Yushchenko's headquarters.\n\nYushchenko's wife said that she tasted \"a metallic-smelling medicine\" on her\n\nhusband's lips after he returned home from a dinner. Yushchenko himself has\n\nexpressed the view that this occasion was the most likely opportunity for\n\nthe poison to be administered as it was the only time he did not take\n\nsecurity measures to test his food.\n\nThe political background is significant. Until round two of the elections on\n\n21 November, the Kuchma-Yanukovych camp was prepared to 'win' the\n\nelections using fraud. Given what was then seen as the inevitability of a\n\nYanukovych presidency, they did not fear legal action following victory\n\nin the poll.\n\nUS National Intelligence Council sources believe that the timing of the\n\npoisoning was highly suspicious. By early September 2004, the authorities\n\nhad planned that after two months of a very dirty campaign their candidate,\n\nYanukovych, would be ahead. However, at that stage Yushchenko's lead\n\nwas actually growing.\n\nIt is highly likely that the audacious poisoning was a desperate act of\n\npanic by his political opponents. Yushchenko twice visited the Vienna clinic\n\nfor treatment and this removed him from the election campaign for four\n\nweeks. By the end of the campaign in October 2004 his [Yanukovych]\n\nratings caught up to Yushchenko's. Dubious results released in round\n\none showed Yanukovych and Yushchenko level at 40 per cent.\n\nThe 'Orange Revolution' undermined Yanukovych's attempted fraudulent\n\nelection victory when mass protests after the second round forced a re-run\n\non 26 December, handing victory to Yushchenko. Interestingly, suspicion has\n\nnot fallen on SBU chairman Ihor Smeshko who, according to JID sources,\n\nhas personal sympathies with the Yushchenko camp.\n\nRUSSIAN CONNECTION?\n\nYushchenko has publicly alleged a Russian connection to his poisoning, a\n\nclaim that has been denied by politicians allied to Putin. Russian\n\nopposition leader Boris Nemtsov, head of the Union of Right Forces, has\n\nstated that he cannot rule out the involvement of the Federal Security\n\nService (FSB), Russia's domestic secret service, which is charged with\n\ncarrying out espionage activities in the Commonwealth of Independent States\n\n(CIS).\n\nTCDD dioxin is not produced commercially and cannot be digested naturally.\n\nIt is a chemical mixture, rather than a specific poison. The preparation of\n\nthe dioxin could have been undertaken in a former KGB secret\n\nchemical/biological laboratory that is now under the control of the FSB.\n\nRenegade intelligence officer Alexander V. Litvinenko, who served in the KGB\n\nand the FSB before defecting to Britain, has revealed that the FSB controls\n\na secret laboratory in Moscow that specialises in the study of poisons.\n\nMeanwhile, a former dissident scientist now living in the US, Vil\n\nMirzayanov, has confirmed that dioxins were studied in this laboratory\n\nduring the development of defoliants for the military. Moreover, Valeriy\n\nKrawchenko, an SBU defector, has also pointed to this FSB laboratory as\n\nthe likely source of the dioxin that was used to poison Yushchenko.\n\nSuch poisoning incidents are not unknown in Russia. A leading Russian\n\nbanker, Ivan Kivelidi, died in 1995 after using a telephone contaminated\n\nwith a poisonous substance. In 2002, a Saudi militant named Khattab, who was\n\nworking for the Chechens, died after opening a poisoned letter. In September\n\n2004 - the same month that Yushchenko was poisoned - the prominent Russian\n\njournalist Anna Politkovskaya was poisoned on a flight to Beslan, where\n\nChechen rebels had taken over a school. She survived.\n\nREPERCUSSIONS\n\nUnder Yushchenko's presidency, the poisoning incident is set to have\n\nwide-ranging domestic and foreign policy ramifications. Domestically, it\n\nwill further erode Kuchma's tarnished reputation and further undermine the\n\npolitical party he relies on for support, Medvedchuk's SDPUo. Medvedchuk\n\nis already being accused of involvement in election fraud.\n\nInternationally, the attempt on Yushchenko's life will undermine Putin's\n\nreputation in Ukraine and abroad. The Russian president's open interference\n\nin Ukraine's elections has been widely condemned by Western governments.\n\nThis is likely to lead to a reassessment of Western foreign policy towards\n\nPutin's increasingly authoritarian Russia. -30-\n\n==========================================================\n\n12. UKRAINIAN SPEAKER'S PARTY SAID TO\n\nWALK POLITICAL TIGHTROPE\n\n\"A Boost For The Speaker\"\n\nANALYSIS: By Yevhen Mahda\n\nGlavred, Kiev, in Russian 0000 gmt 20 Jan 05\n\nBBC Monitoring Service - United Kingdom; Jan 25, 2005\n\nThe People's Agrarian Party of Ukraine is growing in strength as various MPs\n\nquit parliamentary factions associated with the previous government to join\n\nspeaker Volodymyr Lytvyn's group, a Ukrainian analytical web site says.\n\nHowever, Lytvyn needs to be wary of who he brings into his team if he is to\n\nmaintain good relations with the new government and not antagonize President\n\nYushchenko. He also needs to expand his party's electoral base and move away\n\nfrom its focus on agriculture ahead of the 2006 elections, the site\n\nconcludes.\n\nThe following is the text of the article by Yevhen Mahda entitled \"A boost\n\nfor the speaker\", carried on the Glavred web site on 20 January; subheadings\n\nhave been inserted editorially:\n\nTwo main trends in parliamentary life may be noted in 2005 - the Regions of\n\nUkraine party is losing a deputy every day and the ranks of the PAPU\n\n[People's Agrarian Party of Ukraine] faction are increasing almost as fast.\n\n[Party leader and parliamentary speaker] Volodymyr Lytvyn is outwardly cool\n\nabout the latest \"convert to the agrarian faith\", but he knows perfectly\n\nwell that each deputy who comes in gives it more strength and confidence in\n\nthis uneasy situation.\n\nWhile Ukraine's elite was celebrating the Christmas-New Year holidays, away\n\nfrom the protracted presidential campaign, Lytvyn, with Christian humility,\n\nwent to Moscow for Christmas. To be seen with all the top Russian political\n\nleaders, without exception, and even given an audience with [Patriarch]\n\nAleksiy II was quite a considerable achievement, which Lytvyn proved equal\n\nto. He remains someone whom the Kremlin understands, and who is today an\n\nobjectively more legitimate leader of Ukraine, and so it fell to Mr Lytvyn's\n\nlot to open the year of Russian-Ukrainian relations.\n\nIt is not important whose name he gave in Moscow as the future [Ukrainian]\n\nprime minister; here the speaker can only be an advisor, but as to the\n\npossible advantages of co-operation with the next head of the cabinet, more\n\nlater. Lytvyn is skilfully integrating himself into the new system of\n\nauthority, suggesting that it will prove clear to him, and disclaiming the\n\npreconditions for a sharp departure to the opposition USDPU [United Social\n\nDemocratic Party] and Regions of Ukraine.\n\nHis systematically correct remarks are cooling many of the hotheads among\n\nUkrainian politicians, but at the same time they are arousing the poorly\n\nconcealed anger of yesterday's opposition. By no means all of [President\n\nViktor] Yushchenko's supporters have forgotten the methods Mr Lytvyn\n\nused to \"steer the situation\" from the office of the head of the president's\n\nadministration or even simply as the president's first aide. There are\n\ngrounds to believe that [former President] Leonid Kuchma's long held\n\n\"anti-party attitude\" was carefully nurtured by the specialist on\n\ncontemporary political history Lytvyn, whom the \"villain of fate\" in the end\n\nthrew the first number on the \"For a United Ukraine\" party list [reference\n\nto Lytvyn's election to parliament on a pro-Kuchma list in 2001].\n\nLYTVYN AS SPEAKER\n\nI have no wish to repeat the oft-mentioned notions about Lytvyn's maturity\n\nand the evidence of his effectiveness as a parliamentary politician. All I\n\nwill say is that Mr Lytvyn is honing his skills at under-the-carpet intrigue\n\nin his office of speaker too, as witness the serious political problems of\n\nthe coordinators of the parliamentary majority who encroached on the levers\n\nof control of the legal process. We have seen that Lytvyn was closely and\n\nactively involved in both political reform and the settlement of the\n\nsituation in the period between 21 November and 26 December.\n\nHe dug in and strengthened his position when he persistently refused to play\n\nthird violin in a provincial political orchestra. Parliament, which with\n\nLytvyn's immediate participation has been forced to play a leading role in\n\nbig politics, will scarcely lose any of its significance before 2006, rather\n\nthe contrary. So this is the time for the speaker to ponder his own\n\npolitical future.\n\nAlthough Mr Lytvyn opposed the proportional election system, he will have to\n\nbow to parliament's decision and prepare the party for the 2006 marathon.\n\nIncidentally, after the \"orange revolution\", it was precisely the People's\n\nAgrarians who became record breakers in increasing the strength of their\n\nparliamentary ranks. One can speak as much as one likes about the fact that\n\nMr Lytvyn is forming a party of \"revenge of the elite\" and is gathering up\n\nthose who are dissatisfied with the new regime, but it is still a fact that\n\nthere are already 32 deputies in his faction. A place has been found, too,\n\nfor former Social Democrats and Regions of Ukraine members, and virtually\n\nthe whole of the People's platform in the People's Democratic Party.\n\nTo improve the operational administration of the faction Ihor Yeremeyev has\n\nbeen elected its leader. This young and previously inexperienced politician,\n\ntogether with another MP, Serhiy Slabenko, was in charge of the Kontinium\n\nTrust firm, which sits alongside the Halychyna oil refinery. When the Lviv\n\ntax people \"got on\" to Halychyna, it was precisely the PAPU faction which\n\nwas behind the special investigation committee into this question. But I am\n\njust saying this so it may be understood that Mr Lytvyn also values the\n\nyoung members and sponsors of the party, especially if all these qualities\n\nare embodied in one colleague in the corps of deputies.\n\nAnd here is another curious thing - only the \"Donetsk\" Agricultural Policy\n\nMinister Viktor Slauta has in this time quit the ranks of the People's\n\nAgrarians. Incidentally, his boss in the government, former leader of the\n\nPAPU Ivan Kyrylenko, is being written about much less in the media than\n\nother deputy prime ministers. Supporting the agrarian sector is the destiny\n\nof Lytvyn's party, which he needs to reformat, otherwise he will come up\n\nagainst serious problems. The time of operational administration by the\n\nagrarian elite is passing and it is necessary to broaden its electoral\n\nfield. Restricting itself to narrow and fairly specific problems may cost\n\nthe party dearly in the future. If there is a poor harvest the party is\n\nvirtually guaranteed to be seen in a poor light because of the number of its\n\npeople promoted to the government.\n\nRE-NAMING THE PARTY\n\nEvidently, it was not by chance that Lytvyn was very unwilling to comment on\n\nthe rumours going around the parliamentary corridors since last December\n\nabout re-naming the PAPU the People's Party. Of course, he is afraid of\n\ncasting an evil eye on things, after all he had problems with Tatyana\n\nZasukha when he started running the PAPU. One can only imagine, how many\n\n\"friends of the people\" will side with Mr Lytvyn once the party is re-named.\n\nFor example, Ihor Sharov, who announced the arrival of the Democratic\n\nUkraine group, promised that it would be orientated towards Lytvyn. It has\n\nnot been ruled out that Sharov and other members of Working Ukraine see the\n\nspeaker as Kuchma's heir in terms of predictability and pragmatism. One has\n\nto ask - how many more deputies does the speaker have up his sleeve, and\n\nwhy is he doing this?\n\nLet us suppose that Volodymyr Lytvyn, as a politician who has an excellent\n\nknowledge of how power works from within, harbours no illusions as to the\n\nuse or non-use of administrative resources at future parliamentary\n\nelections. Therefore the People's Party of Ukraine already today needs to\n\ndelegate its representatives to power, and it was not for nothing that one\n\nof the first statements of the new leader of the party parliamentary faction\n\nIhor Yeremeyev was a request for three portfolios in the new government.\n\nWho will give it to them, you may ask? And what, pray, will become of\n\nYushchenko, if several dozen deputies can gather around Lytvyn - not\n\nopposition members doing so out of spite, but constructive people who\n\nwould quite rightly demand their own little bit of power?\n\nIncidentally, Mr Yushchenko, at the beginning of 2003, promised to do almost\n\nanything for the speaker. But, of course, these are emotions of the past.\n\nToday, Lytvyn has started to play a fairly dangerous game of \"bringing in\n\nthe old and the dissatisfied\". He is criticizing [outgoing Prime Minister\n\nViktor] Yanukovych and [former head of presidential administration Viktor]\n\nMedvedchuk, but he is confident of establishing good relations with the new\n\nprime minister, apparently guessing who it will be. Incidentally, can you\n\nimagine the intrigue if the prime minister and the speaker start to \"gang\n\nup\" against the \"people's president\"?\n\nBut Mr Lytvyn has had little short-term success, and he is already thinking\n\nabout the parliamentary elections. When he said that the president-elect\n\nshould not feel obliged to anyone, he was giving his personal opinion -\n\nsince his elevation to the presidium by 226 votes Lytvyn has evidently been\n\nin no hurry to think about settling things with the politicians who helped\n\nhim to be elected. Nor should those MPs who have of late been \"supping\" on\n\nthe speaker's ambitions, either, harbour any illusions - by no means all of\n\nthem will get prominent places in the PAPU list.\n\nFIRST, push-button voting is one thing, but electioneering opportunities are\n\nquite another; SECOND, there will evidently be more than one in Lytvyn's\n\nbloc, so it will be necessary to seek mutually acceptable formulae, and\n\nTHIRD, places in the first five are hardly guaranteed just for Mr Lytvyn and\n\nKateryna Vashchuk (after all, she is a woman), but now [former Working\n\nUkraine MP] Mykhaylo Poplavskyy may even make the twenty, if he is not\n\ndisillusioned by that time in his new party's ideas. The remaining\n\ncontenders for political partnership will have to fight for \"a place in Mr\n\nLytvyn's sun\" not just formally, but by doing something positive.\n\nVirtually since the start of the \"Orange Revolution\" we have seen how\n\nUkraine has been turning into a parliamentary-presidential republic almost\n\nunnoticed. Even before the ballot for political reform Mr Lytvyn took up the\n\nreins of government himself and took advantage of his undoubted legitimacy\n\nas speaker. He skilfully converted his job into building up the ranks of the\n\nfaction, which he then wants to exchange for places in the executive power.\n\nAnd everything could go according to Lytvyn's plan but for one thing - the\n\nsuccesses of Lytvyn's party are an insult to Yushchenko's supporters.\n\nBut there are enough experienced players in the attractive game of \"winding\n\nup the president\" in Mr Lytvyn's circle. So Mr Lytvyn is resigned to taking\n\nhis time in setting the bar which he is not going to hurl himself at, at\n\nleast for the time being. Otherwise they will remind him of his cooperation\n\nwith Leonid Kuchma and try to force him out to the political margins. -30-\n\n==========================================================\n\n\"THE ACTION UKRAINE REPORT\"\n\nARTICLES ARE FOR PERSONAL AND ACADEMIC USE ONLY\n\nArticles are Distributed For Information, Research, Education\n\nDiscussion and Personal Purposes Only\n\n==========================================================\n\nUkraine Information Website: http://www.ArtUkraine.com\n\n==========================================================\n\n\"THE ACTION UKRAINE REPORT\" - SPONSORS\n\n\"Working to Secure Ukraine's Future\"\n\n1.
