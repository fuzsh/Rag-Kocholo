So, we do not start life from scratch. We start with certain pros. But there were also cons,” Kravchuk said.\n\nHe also informed that a meeting with the Ukrainian delegation would take place on 3 August to discuss further actions. However, the decision on staff changes should depend not only on the opinion of the delegation’s Head.\n\nBohdan Marusyak"
