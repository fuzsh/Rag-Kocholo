Leonid Kuchma\n\nPresident of Ukraine\n\nKiev, Ukraine\n\nDear Mr. President:\n\nBohdan Koziy is a Nazi war criminal who has enjoyed undeserved sanctuary in\n\nCosta Rica for the past 15 years, and now that government has ordered him to\n\nleave the country.\n\nSince Mr. Koziy is a native of Ukraine, it is our hope that your government\n\nwill cooperate with the government of Costa Rica and take in Mr. Koziy.\n\nHe was stripped of his American citizenship in 1982 after his identity was\n\nestablished in U.S. courts and confirmed by the German government. He was\n\nfound by a U.S. Federal Court to have single-handedly murdered a\n\n4 year-old Jewish girl by shooting her at point-blank range as she\n\npleaded with him for her life outside a police station in Lysiec, Ukraine,\n\nin the autumn of 1943. German courts have also found that he personally\n\ncarried out this and other crimes.\n\nHe also took part in numerous other anti-Jewish actions during the war as a\n\nmember of the notorious Nazi-run Ukrainian police. The Office of Special\n\nInvestigations of the U.S. Justice Department attempted to expel him from\n\nthe country but Koziy fled to Costa Rica in 1984 before his court-ordered\n\ndeportation to the Soviet Union could be carried out.\n\nIn the interest of justice, we urge you not to prevent Mr. Koziy from returning to Ukraine and consider the opportunity presented by the Government of Costa Rica to hold him accountable for his crimes.
