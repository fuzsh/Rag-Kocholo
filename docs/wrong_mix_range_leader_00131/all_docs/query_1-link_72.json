        "text": "The Ukrainian government is shuddering under the weight of a mounting corruption scandal, involving the president Leonid Kuchma, a series of secretly taped foul-mouthed conversations and a headless corpse, believed to be that of a missing journalist.\n\nA parliamentary committee spent yesterday attempting to wade through a mire of allegations to establish the truth at the heart of the case.\n\nThey were examining the testimony of a former presidential bodyguard who claimed to have placed a digital tape recorder under the president's sofa, recording conversations in which Mr Kuchma allegedly ordered senior officials to dispose of the journalist.\n\nThese tapes were made public by the head of the opposition Socialist party, Oleksandr Moroz, who described them as irrefutable evidence linking Mr Kuchma to the disappearance of Georgy Gongadze, the editor of a Ukrainian internet newspaper which focused on corruption.\n\nThe president has denied that it is his voice on the tape and has initiated a slander action. \"A large-scale provocation is taking place,\" a spokesman quoted Mr Kuchma as saying.\n\nDutch experts say the tapes do not appear to have been edited or tampered with, although no one has been able to prove that the voice belongs to the president.\n\nMr Gongadze disappeared on September 16. Amid growing pressure for a thorough investigation, Mr Kuchma said he would oversee the case himself but no breakthroughs have been made.\n\nThe former security service officer, Major Mykola Melnichenko, said he began bugging the president after becoming dismayed by the abuses of power he witnessed in the top levels of government. He said he hoped to \"stop this regime's criminal activity\". He is in hiding abroad.\n\nOn the tapes, a voice similar to the president's can be heard discussing in crude language the best way to get rid of \"the bastard\" Mr Gongadze. There is no discussion in the tapes of murder and eventually they opt for a kidnap operation.\n\n\"I'm telling you, dispose of him; throw him out. Give him to the Chechens... [indecipherable] and then ransom him,\" the voice orders. \"Strip him, shit, leave him without his pants. Let him sit. Get it done simply, shit.\"\n\nA headless, disfigured corpse was found near Kiev on November 3. Investigators said it was impossible to identify the body because the head could not be found and its hands had been treated in acid to remove the fingerprints.\n\nBut Mr Gongadze's family are convinced the body is his; jewellery belonging to him is said to have been found with the corpse and an x-ray to his left hand revealed traces of shrapnel - he injured the hand when he worked as a war correspondent.\n\nMr Kuchma has accused his opponents of trying to trigger a national crisis, just as international attention focuses on Ukraine for today's closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. He has also claimed that the whole affair has been orchestrated by western secret services, alarmed by the new bonds Ukraine is forging with Russia.\n\nOther commentators have suggested that Gongadze's death may have been ordered by powerful business figures, damaged by reports in his Ukrainska Pravda.\n\nAlexander Lavrinovich, the head of the parliamentary commission investigating the disappearance, said: \"The remains of the body were brought to Kiev in the middle of November and we still don't have a positive identification - an unusually long time.\n\n\"No one has revealed what kind of analyses are being carried out and how much longer the process will continue for, which undermines one's confidence in the whole process.\n\n\"We are also concerned that no official examination of the tapes has been conducted; this is the responsibility of the prosecutors' office, which has been sent the tapes; we don't even know whether they intend to do this.\""
