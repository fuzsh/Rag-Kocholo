        "text": "MOSCOW, Russia -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has accused \"big money and professionals\" of masterminding a scandal linking him to a leading journalist's disappearance.\n\nGeorgiy Gongadze, who had been harshly critical of Kuchma and his entourage, vanished in mid-September and friends believe he has been murdered.\n\nLast month Socialist Party leader Olexander Moroz released an audio cassette, which he said, proved that Kuchma and several senior officials had played key roles in the disappearance.\n\nKuchma has vigorously denied the claims and says the allegations are an attempt to blackmail him.\n\n\"Big money and professionals stand behind this,\" Kuchma told a news conference shortly after he arrived in Moscow for a working visit on Thursday.\n\n\"I tend to believe that they are ours, Ukrainians. I tried to find a logic in all these actions but could not see any,\" he added.\n\nPreviously, Kuchma has said the furore over Gongadze was a large-scale provocation staged by forces outside Ukraine seeking to create chaos.\n\nLast week Gongadze's wife Myroslava was allowed to view a decapitated corpse found outside Kiev which she said appeared to be the body of her husband.\n\nThe journalist had turned to the Internet after the radio station he worked for was closed down with a Web site called \"Ukrainian Truth.\"\n\nOn Thursday Ukraine's parliament urged the government to speed up its investigation into his disappearance and also called for an authenticity check of the tape by independent experts.\n\nMoroz says the tape, which has been played in parliament, was provided by a retired security officer who had planted a bug under a sofa in Kuchma's office.\n\nIt depicts Kuchma allegedly telling two top aides it would be a good thing if the journalist was kidnapped although it is not clear whether the speaker is ordering action or simply venting anger.\n\nKuchma lambasted unnamed officials for breaking state secrets and said Moroz's cassette \"contained no hint that the president wants to eliminate a reporter.\"\n\nHe has said the cassette is being examined by independent experts, Ukraine's Prosecutor General and the Council of Europe, a democracy and human rights body.\n\nParliament has demanded the resignation of Interior Minister Yuri Kravchenko and the head of the SBU secret police chief, Leonid Derkach over the affair.\n\nUkrainian security police have offered a 100,000 hryvnia ($18,400) reward for information on the case.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nReward offered for missing Ukrainian\n\nDecember 18, 2000\n\nRELATED SITES:"
