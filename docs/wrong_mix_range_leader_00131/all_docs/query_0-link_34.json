The economic, technical and cultural infrastructures serve as a solid foundation for bilateral cooperation. Public and business partnership, which is gaining momentum, is becoming more significant.\n\nThe Year of Ukraine in Russia is a significant event for the 200 million people living on the territory from the Carpathians to the Pacific Ocean, Mr Putin said.\n\nMr Kuchma suggested holding the Year of Russia in Ukraine in 2003."
