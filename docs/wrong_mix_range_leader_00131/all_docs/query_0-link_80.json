        "text": "From the first moment of his premiership in March 2010, Mykola Azarov made clear how bleakly he saw Ukraine’s predicament. “Even the prime minister’s official automobile doesn’t work,” Azarov said, seated in front of ministers and a group of reporters at his cabinet’s first meeting. “A small example, but how can there be any order in Ukraine if the prime minister’s automobile doesn’t work?”\n\nThe rhetoric may have been awkward – ordinary Ukrainians may not much care for the ruling elite’s limousines – and his language, Ukrainian, may have been faulty, but the message was clear: even a banana republic can take better care of its leader’s Mercedes than Ukraine.\n\nFactoring in Ukraine’s size, the ethnic-Russian Nikolai Azarov – or Mykola in the Ukrainian version of his name – probably has a tougher task than any European prime minister. Ukraine is arguably the worst country in Europe for businessmen, its population has fallen by 15% in two decades, and it suffers from a schism between its Ukrainian-speaking west and Russian-speaking east so calcified that some believe it is doomed to remain in a split-state purgatory à la Belge.\n\nPerhaps an olive branch to the opposition would ease those problems, but Azarov is no conciliator. Three years after taking up his post, he continues to rail against his predecessors, particularly Yulia Tymoshenko’s crimes and incompetence, as if to say: “See what a mess she left me? She even sabotaged the office car!”\n\nThree years on, the party he leads – the Party of Regions – returned to power in October. But his government’s challenges remain daunting, most notably corruption, bureaucracy, and the judiciary – all are so rotten that Ukraine ranked 137th last year in a World Bank ranking of countries for ease of doing business.\n\nAzarov’s path to power, and Ukraine, was circuitous. Born out of wedlock just after the war in Kaluga, a town 150 kilometres south-west of Moscow, Azarov took his mother’s maiden surname rather than that of his half-Estonian, half-Russian father. It was with his wife, Lyudmila, who is of Ukrainian descent, that he first travelled to Ukraine in the early 1970s. It was only in 1984, at the age of 36, that Azarov moved to Ukraine, taking up a post at a geological research centre in Donetsk, one of the Soviet Union’s coal-rich regions.\n\nThe Gorbachev era began soon after and, seeing Moscow as incapable of managing the economy and wanting desperately to sustain the industry to which he had dedicated two decades, Azarov entered public life. When Ukraine gained independence, a period marked by catastrophic economic decline (output contracted some 70%), Azarov, by now a professor of geology specialising in gold-bearing veins, plunged into politics. In the years after 1994, when he became a member of parliament, Azarov acquired a range of experience – of taxes, budget policy, national security – that moulded him into the statistics-loving technocrat he is today. Along the way, he entered the inner circle of the then president Leonid Kuchma and another Donetsk native, Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nWhen Yanukovych became prime minister in 2002, he brought Azarov along as finance minister. Two years later the Orange Revolution – which Azarov damns as a huge step backwards in economic development – pulled the rug of power from beneath their feet, but the pendulum of Ukrainian politics returned both men back to power in 2006, then once again to the opposition, and then – in early 2010 – to the country’s two highest posts after Yanukovych won the presidency in a campaign managed by Azarov.\n\nAzarov, in short, is beholden to Yanukovych, and has limited room to shape government policy. But Yanukovych also relies on Azarov for the nitty-gritty of statecraft. Nor should Azarov’s role in shaping Yanukovych’s thinking be underestimated as the president considers the major crossroads at which Ukraine stands – a choice between a Russia-led customs club or a trade agreement with the EU.\n\nJudged by his statements, Azarov dreams of seeing Ukraine join the European family, but understands that this will not happen soon. “The technical backwardness can be overcome rather quickly,” Azarov, who often points to the South Korean and Singaporean economic miracles, said last year, “but the transformation of mentality, traditions, customs….it’s a very lengthy process. Society resists. Society wants to remain the way it is. Changing anything is very difficult.” He then defined his government’s mission unambiguously: “Ukraine’s task is to modernise its society, economy, and step-by-step approach those standards that we see in Europe.”\n\nIt is all very noble-sounding from a man who professes a fondness for books and paintings, but Azarov cannot escape blame for the slowness of the transformation of Ukraine’s mentality or politics. He has been one of Ukraine’s leading politicians for nearly two decades and, for example, was from 1996 to 2002 head of the tax inspectorate, a body criticised for arbitrary and politicised harassment. Nor is Azarov helping himself now. His son, for instance, won a parliamentary seat in October for the Party of Regions. Perhaps 41-year-old Aleksei was the best qualified individual in that district, and perhaps he won fairly, but the perception of nepotism lingers damagingly.\n\nAzarov’s difficulty in managing perceptions applies, more importantly, to the case of Tymoshenko. She may very well be guilty of having abused her power as prime minister in 2007-10, but the methods used against her, and several of her ministers, created the perception of a witch-hunt mandated by Yanukovych and Azarov. If the country’s two most powerful men cannot guarantee “European standards” in this high-profile case, as well as Tymoshenko’s subsequent imprisonment, what hope can there be for all cases not under the international spotlight?\n\nPerhaps Ukraine’s leaders fail to understand or choose to ignore the extremely important subtleties of good governance raised by these cases, and by the European Commission. That failure of understanding or will is why the weathervane of Ukraine’s destiny currently appears to point eastward, for, if Brussels cares about human rights, fair elections, and the rule of law, Moscow has no such concerns. Azarov may complain now about how much Ukraine pays for Russia’s gas, but he may conclude that it is easier to pay Moscow a premium rather than to swallow the EU’s medicine.\n\nBoth Ukraine and the European Union say they want to sign an association agreement by this November. That gives Azarov, who is in the twilight of his career, just months to decide whether he wants history to portray him as a true reformer, or as the vassal of a president who turned his back on Europe and embraced the opaque world of ‘Eastern standards’.\n\nGary Peach\n\nCorrection: This article originally indicated that Azarov took his surname from his wife, rather than from his mother."
