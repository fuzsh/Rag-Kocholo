        "text": "Overview of the modern Ukrainian presidency\n\nMain article: President of Ukraine\n\nThe modern Ukrainian presidency was formed when the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic passed a law on 5 July 1991 establishing the office of the \"President of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.\"[1] Upon the proclamation of Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union on 24 August 1991, the title was changed to the \"President of Ukraine.\" The first election of the President of Ukraine, which was held on 1 December 1991, was won by Leonid Kravchuk.\n\nEvery president of Ukraine except for Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been a People's Deputy of the Verkhovna Rada prior to their election. Kravchuk was the first president to resign from the office, following a power struggle with Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma. After the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, Viktor Yanukovych abandoned his office and fled the country. He was subsequently impeached, and replaced by Oleksandr Turchynov as the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, who serves as acting president when the office is vacant. Early presidential elections were held on 25 May 2014 and won by Petro Poroshenko; Poroshenko was inaugurated as the fifth president on 7 June 2014. On 18 June 2015, Yanukovych was officially deprived of the title of President of Ukraine.[2] After defeating Poroshenko, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was inaugurated as the sixth president of Ukraine on 20 May 2019.\n\nParty legend\n\nIndependent Our Ukraine Party of Regions Fatherland Petro Poroshenko Bloc Servant of the People\n\n# Portrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death) Term of office Cabinets Elections Prior office Political alliance — Leonid Kravchuk[3]\n\nЛеонід Кравчук\n\n(1934–2022)\n\n24 August\n\n1991[a] 5 December\n\n1991 Fokin (1990–92) — Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Independent 1 5 December\n\n1991 19 July\n\n1994 1991 02 3292 years, 329 days Kuchma (1992–93) Declared independence of Ukraine in 1991.
