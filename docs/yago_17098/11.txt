confession, in literature, an autobiography, either real or fictitious, in which intimate and hidden details of the subject’s life are revealed. The first outstanding example of the genre was the Confessions of St. Augustine (c. ad 400), a painstaking examination of Augustine’s progress from juvenile sinfulness and youthful debauchery to conversion to Christianity and the triumph of the spirit over the flesh. Others include the Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (1822), by Thomas De Quincey, focusing on the writer’s early life and his gradual addiction to drug taking, and Confessions (1782–89), the intimate autobiography of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. André Gide used the form to great effect in such works as Si le grain ne meurt (1920 and 1924; If It Die...), an account of his life from birth to marriage.

Such 20th-century poets as John Berryman, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, and Anne Sexton wrote poetry in the confessional vein, revealing intensely personal, often painful perceptions and feelings.

Also in the tradition are the “confession magazines,” collections of sensational and usually purely fictional autobiographical tales popular in the mid-20th century.
