        "text": "Matthias Church\n\nThe Matthias Church with its colorful roof of glazed tiles, is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful buildings in Budapest. The construction of this Gothic-style church went on for two centuries. It is so great, that even when the Turks captured the city in the 16th century they did not destroy it, but only painted over the frescoes. According to the legend, one of the walls of the church collapsed during an artillery bombardment in an attempt to recapture Buda from the Turks. Consequently, praying Turks were confronted with a statue of the Holy Mary, whose appearance undermined their spirit so badly, that the city surrendered on that very day.\n\nPlease note that the entrance to the church is paid. Get directions.\n\nVajdahunyad Castle\n\nVajdahunyad Castle is one of the pearls of the capital. The first version of the castle, made of wood and cardboard, was built in 1896, as one of the pavilions for the exhibition in honor of the Millennial anniversary of Hungary. The building became so popular that the townspeople asked to build it from stone and brick.\n\nRight in front of the castle stands the mysterious monument to Anonymous. The legend says that touching his pen can give wisdom to anyone, whilst students will receive a good mark on the exam.\n\nThe agricultural museum inside the castle is closed on Mondays – learn more on the official website of the castle. Get directions.\n\nSt Stephen's Basilica\n\nThe colossal St Stephen’s Basilica is the third largest church in Hungary. Its dome reaches 96 meters, and can be climbed via 364 stairs (or the elevator…) for a beautiful panoramic view over Budapest. The impressive church was dedicated to Saint Stephen, the first King of Hungary, who played a large role in the Christianization of Hungarians and the unification of the Magyar tribes.\n\nBeloved by visitors are also the concerts here, which require a valid ticket. Other than that, the church can be visited for free. Check out the official website for more visitor info. Get directions.\n\nGellért Hill\n\nRising up 140 meters above the Danube, Gellért Hill is where to find the best views over Budapest. Once a notorious hill, connected with the death of Saint Gellért, witches and strongholds of invaders, the peace has returned with calm pathways leading to nice observation terraces equipped with benches.\n\nAll along the hill you can find monuments, like in the Garden of Philosophy, with statues of the world's greatest like Buddha, Jesus Christ and Laozi. The real treat is for children though, with a truly amazing playground with long slides and trampolines. Get directions.\n\nSzéchenyi Thermal Baths\n\nThe Széchenyi Baths make up the largest bathing complex of Europe. A staggering number of 21 baths are located in and around a monumental Neo-Baroque building that was erected early 20th century. Although most of the pools can be found outside, they offer even in the depths of winter a comfortable bathing experience due to the relatively hot thermal water here.\n\nThe baths are open every day. Get directions.\n\nGreat Synagogue / Dohány Street Synagogue\n\nThe Great Synagogue is the second largest synagogue in the world and the largest in Europe. The famous Viennese architect Ludwig Förster built it in 1859 in the Moorish style.\n\nThe synagogue is located in the famous Jewish quarter of Pest, where a large number of Orthodox Jews reside, carefully preserving their traditions for many centuries. The 'Tree of Life' in the courtyard of the synagogue was designed by Imre Varga – it commemorates the 600,000 Hungarian Jews killed in WWII. Get directions.\n\nShopping around Váci Street\n\nThe main pedestrian street of Budapest is filled with restaurants, and shops! Around Vörösmarty Square there's a number of popular mainstream clothes stores, like Bershka and H&M. Towards the main square of the city – Deák Ferenc Square – you will find 'Fashion Street', which is basically just a pedestrian street where all the shopping continues – though with better high-end shopping options. The other streets branching off from Váci Street, are good to search for specialty shops selling Hungarian wine, marzipan, antique or Hungarian porcelain. Get directions.\n\nFisherman's Bastion\n\nDespite its name, the Fisherman's Bastion you see here never carried the function of a defensive structure. The place used to be a square inside the walls of the fortress, where local fishermen were allowed to sell their catch. In exchange, the fisherman's guild pledged to protect these city walls in case of a military threat.\n\nThe main catch nowadays, is the magnificent view from the Fisherman's Bastion. The entire territory is free of charge, but in order to ascend to the upper balconies you need to buy a ticket of around € 4. Get directions.\n\nMargaret Island\n\nMargaret Island is the green pearl of Budapest, with centenary trees, thermal waters, medieval ruins and a Japanese garden as well as a rose garden. Historians suggest that the Romans were the first to master this territory in the middle of the Danube. They even managed to build a bridge connecting the island with the Buda side, marking the borders of the Roman Empire. Nowadays it can be entered from the North and South, and from both riversides. Get directions.\n\nSzimpla Farmers' Market\n\nThe cosy Szimpla ruin bar turns into an even cosier farmers market on Sundays. Amidst a hip and relaxed atmosphere you are invited to try local delicacies like fresh pastries, honey, homemade cheese, Goulash, all kinds of Hungarian sausages from the hairy Mangalica, or special local pesto - Budapesto.\n\nLearn more about drinks, food and bicycles on their official website. Find the market on Sundays between 9h and 14h. Get directions.\n\nCitadella / Liberty Statue\n\nAfter the Habsburgs managed to suppress the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, they decided to build this Citadel on top of Gellért Hill. With 60 cannons pointed at the city, the main purpose of this stronghold was to scare the citizens of Budapest to prevent new uprisings.\n\nThe Liberty Statue was placed later on top of the Citadel. The woman with the palm leaf above her head commemorates the liberation of Budapest by Soviet troops in WWII.\n\nBut most importantly, climb this hill for the best views over Budapest! Get directions.\n\nErzsébet Square\n\nErzsébet Square (Hu) is a green square in the centre of Budapest, named after Erzsébet, the wife of Emperor Franz Joseph. On hot summer days, the small artificial lake is a popular spot for refreshment. The square is culturally enriched with the Danube Fountain, designed in 1883 by Miklós Ybl. The figures around the fountain represent the Tisza, Drava and Sava rivers of Hungary, with on top the one representing the Danube. Thanks to the Budapest Eye, the square is recognizable from afar. Get directions.\n\nFeneketlen Lake\n\nThe artificial Feneketlen Lake was created in the clay quarry that was left by a brick factory by the end of the 19th century. The name of the lake – which translates as 'bottomless' – was allegedly acquired in the 1910s, when workers flattened a nearby hill. They threw the earth directly into the water, and noticed that it did not go to the bottom, but instead floated on the surface. Then rumors came up that this lake has no bottomâ¦\n\nAround the lake you'll find a nicely designed park and a soft 530m running track. The beautiful baroque church of Saint Emeric of Hungary looks out over the water. Get directions.\n\nHungarian Parliament Building\n\nSeven years after the unification of Buda, Pest and Óbuda, the National Assembly decided to build the magnificent Parliament building, to emphasize the sovereign right of the Hungarian nation.\n\nThe building is not only valuable in architectural sense, but also of great historical importance. Head for the Domed Hall and find the more than a thousand-years-old Holy Crown of Hungary.\n\nDespite its governmental function, the building is open to the public every day (for a fee of about 8 euros). On the official website, you can find detailed information about tours and tickets. Get directions.\n\nKopaszi Dam\n\nKopaszi Dam (Hu) is a comfortable modern recreation area around the Danube Spit in the Buda part of the city – it is located right behind the Rákóczi Bridge. Here you can take a walk, bring your kids to the playground, or relax in the large lounge area and dip your feet in the Danube in warm weather.\n\nUnlike many other urban parks, there's a large number of restaurants and terraces here, which make this an excellent place to relax. Get directions.\n\nMuseum of Fine Arts\n\nThe main art museum of the Hungarian capital, the SzépmÅ±vészeti Múzeum, was founded in 1896, when it primarily represented the collection of the Esterházy family. The Neoclassical building houses Egyptian, Greek and Roman collections, as well as European fine art with in particular the Italian school of painting, as represented by Raphael, Giotto, Tintoretto, Titian, Giorgione and others.\n\nLearn more about current exhibitions and events on the official website. Please note that the museum is closed on Mondays. Get directions.\n\nShoes by the Danube\n\nTravelers visiting Budapest for the first time can be surprised to see a few dozen pairs of shoes on the Danube embankment. Men's and women's shoes and even children's shoes made from cast iron, are a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. The shoes recall the event of Jews being shot here on the riverbank. Before the execution they were asked to take off their shoes. With their bodies falling into the Danube, the shoes represent all that's left... Get directions.\n\nCastle Garden\n\nThe Castle Garden is a peaceful green area with benches, in between the Buda Castle and the Danube. It's a place decorated with fountains and flowers, from where you have nice views over Budapest. Walking up North, you will find more calm pathways along the hill. Those are more shaded and less refined, but still great for a little exercise in the centre of the city. Get directions.\n\nHungarian State Opera House\n\nThe Hungarian State Opera House is considered one of the most beautiful buildings of Budapest, as designed by the talented architect Miklós Ybl. The building is richly decorated with sculptures, bas-reliefs, stucco and paintings. The staircase inside is decorated with works of painters like Mór Than, Károly Lotz and Bertalan Székely.\n\nThe Opera Hall has the shape of a horseshoe, and is considered among the finest in the world in terms of acoustics. Check out the official website for the program and ticket info. Get directions.\n\nCorvin Plaza (Mall)\n\nCorvin Plaza is a large and modern mall, a bit hidden from the main streets. It represents one of the ongoing efforts to renovate the district of Józsefváros. Thanks to a bright design and plenty of light, it's a comfortable place for shopping. Here you will find many popular mainstream brands. On the topfloor there's a food court.\n\nThe mall is open every day. See the official website (Hu) for more info about the stores. Get directions.\n\nDanube Promenade\n\nOn the side of the old town of Pest there's a pleasant shaded promenade known as Dunakorzó. One of the main attractions here is László Marton's small statue called the Little Princess. Find her sitting on the railings of the promenade near Vigadó Square.\n\nThe Danube Promenade contains many benches as well as plenty of nice restaurants and cafés. Get directions.\n\nMain Square / FÅ Tér\n\nFÅ Tér is the central square of Óbuda, one of the three towns that made up Budapest. A bit hidden behind flat buildings and flyovers, FÅ Tér is typically not included in tourists' tours.\n\nThe calm and picturesque square is surrounded by 18th century baroque architecture. It is a place to find the atmosphere of a village, with some nice restaurants and terraces, and also a surprisingly rich history. Get directions.\n\nGellért Hill Cave Church / Saint Ivan's Cave\n\nAccording to the legend the monk Ivan settled in this cave, where he practiced healing with the help of local mud and thermal water – nowadays these waters are filling the Gellért Baths. Later, the monk was canonized and the cave was named in his honor. The extraordinary cave church that you can see here now officially opened in 1926, as a monastery of the Pauline Order.\n\nPlease note that the entrance is to be found on the slope of Gellért Hill. The entrance fee includes an audio guide. Get directions.\n\nGellért Baths\n\nBuilt early 20th century, the Gellért Thermal Baths looks more like a palace than a hydrotherapy center. The sources of Gellért Hill generously supply the baths with thermal water of temperatures up to 40 °C.
