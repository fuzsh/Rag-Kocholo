        "text": "The main activity of consciousness is not to allow us to perceive the world, but to allow us to orient ourselves in it. Its work, in other words, allows each one to create a relationship with himself or herself only by directing it towards others and towards things: it ensures the presence of the self to itself only by relating it to what is different from it. The fact that the conscious being overlaps and intersects the being in relation means that the body, far from being a tyrant that imposes his laws, grows and develops itself only by means of a symbiosis with social life: it manages to give an accomplished form to consciousness only by means of symbolic interactions. This relationship between the human body and society manifests itself in the form of an ongoing struggle in which the stakes are the internal intersection points – in the heart itself of the cognitive problem – and the external ones – in the languages, in the objects, in all the social forms. It is around these eve...\n\nThis anthology assembles some of the earliest Czech texts on film published in the period between 1908 and 1939, i.e., between the rise of art cinema and the outbreak of World War II, writings that were instrumental in shaping the various ways film was seen and understood in this formative period. The authors include scientist Jan Evangelista Purkinje, whose studies of the perception of movement from 1819 and 1820 laid the foundation for the rise of the cinematic apparatus, and writers and critics Václav Tille and Karel Čapek, who, years before their counterparts abroad, analyzed cinematic language as it was emerging, reflecting on its genealogy, genres, and future development. How was it possible that, in a country without a well-developed film industry, these cultural and literary critics, linguists, theater directors, architects, and filmmakers articulated ideas and concepts that predated later theoretical developments? This collection suggests that Czech writers benefited from their location at the crossroads of Eastern and Western Europe, where Austrian, Slavic, German, French, and American cultures intermingled. The anthology is organized both thematically and chronologically to reflect the rise of film as a new medium, a cultural institution, and an art form—in other words, to document the discursive construction of film in its variety and multiplicity. The writings express a number of concerns that relate to major trends and forces of modernity in the twentieth century: film is seen as a means to educate and enlighten, as an example of the dynamic relation between time and space, as a new formal model for other arts, as a tool for ideological struggle, and as a unique signifying system. While some of the authors are known to scholars in various fields—Purkinje to historians of science, Karel Teige to students of the European avant-garde, Jan Mukařovský and Roman Jakobson to literary scholars and linguists, and Alexander Hackenschmied (a.k.a. Hammid) to film historians—only a few of their texts on film have been translated into English, and this anthology marks the first time they have been systematically and critically assembled. In this sense, the anthology continues the efforts of recent publications and exhibitions to showcase Central Europe as the site of key moments in art and cultural history. At the same time, it also situates art movements and theories within the complex framework of modernity, whose major forces ranged from technology and mass media to national politics. Instead of focusing on the history of film theory in a narrow academic sense, the anthology presents the reader with a great diversity of genres and styles of writing that address the formation and development of this emblematic component of modernity. In the first half of the twentieth century, film was seen as a medium that overturned the existing hierarchy of cultural values and radically transformed individual subjective experience. The texts herein do not document these transformations from an external, impartial point of view; on the contrary, they are an integral part of these changes—their manifestation and their agents.\n\nIn the following I shall attempt to outline the line of thinking held by a group of students and researchers working at the Faculty of Social Sciences in Salamanca (“Group on Media, Education and Learning”, or GOMEL). Our work has led us both to revise current models used to represent everyday culture, and to seek methodological alternatives for researching and designing cultural productions (for instance, trying to change practices or working models of communicators, or developing prototypical products for the mass media). I cannot explain our whole line of work here, but I shall try to share with you a few of our reflections and some of the hypotheses that the group has been developing — hypotheses that have emerged in the attempt to connect everyday mental contents with the contents of everyday culture. I shall present some of the projects and explain one of them in more detail.\n\nCultural Studies Approaches in the Study of Eastern European Cinema represents the materialization of a moment that started in 2014 with the 12th conference of the European Society for the Study of English/ESSE, which took place in Slovakia. As the editor, Andrea Virginás, participated in a panel named “The use of Cultural Studies Approaches in the Study of Eastern European Cinema”, she was suggested the idea of a possible volume on that topic. Hence, the book under review is a collection of 12 case studies of post-1989 national cinemas such as Croatian, Hungarian, Polish, Serbian, Slovakian, Slovenian and Romanian. The Eastern European film and cinema are generally subsumed within a postcolonial reading of the New Wave Cinema. Using this postcolonial framework the authors rethink national cinematic canon and present the various aspects of the ”spatial”, the ”bodily” and the ”memory turn” as represented on screen. The articles work on a double concern; on the one hand, they follow t..."
