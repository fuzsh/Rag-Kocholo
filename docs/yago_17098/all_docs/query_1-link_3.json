        "text": "S. 5-26 Stefan Heid (Rom): Gab es in Rom eine Gemeinde der Quartodezimaner? Abstract: \"Was there a community of Quartodecimans in Rome?\"-The followers of the popular house church theory refer to an alleged quartodeciman (house-)community in Rome in the 2nd century, which existed beside numerous other house churches led by a presbyter until its excommunication under bishop Victor. The essay examines the arguments and comes to the conclusion that such an assertion cannot be substantiated by any text, but is based on a number of hypotheses that are neither individually nor collectively valid. S. 27-42 Ingo Schaaf (Rom): Opfertod und Todessuche als Exemple in Antike und Christentum Abstract: \"Self-sacrifice and the search for death as an example in antiquity and Christianity\"-Since Jesusʼ questioning by Pilate the reactions of the pagans in view of the non-violent steadfastness of persecuted Christians were marked by incomprehension. While such behaviour seemed to the Roman authorities to be nothing more than obstinate, it is well known that Tertullian can speak of the seed of the martyrs' blood burgeoning in the expanding church. But how, intellectually, was the ground prepared for this process, or which views stood in the way of its unfolding? Starting from remarks on the profane concept of μάρτυς/μαρτύριον, the contribution traces the question under which premises the Christian willingness to suffer could be interpreted on the pagan side with particular emphasis on the accusation of suicide. Reciprocally to this it is discussed whether and, if so, in which way pagan ideas and figures offered points of contact for a specific Christian theology of martyrdom or could serve as a contrasting foil against the background of which corresponding ideas could be profiled in late antiquity. In this double perspective, so the basic assumption, one challenges not only the application of conventional derivation models to Christian martyrdom, thus keeping its proprium recognizable, but also better measures its radius of action in the midst of a non-Christian environment. S. 43-55 Domenico Benoci (Rom): Defensores fidei. Die Rolle der scholae peregrinorum in den epigraphischen und urkundlichen Quellen Abstract: \"Defensores fidei: the role of scholae peregrinorum in epigraphic and documentary sources\"-The article proposes hypotheses on the reasons and methods that led, towards the end of the seventh century, to the establishment of the scholae peregrinorum starting from the epigraphic documentation and written sources received. S. 56-79 Arnold Esch (Rom): Von Venedig ins Heilige Land und nach Ägypten. Pilgerberichte als historische Quelle Abstract: \"From Venice to the Holy Land and Egypt: Pilgrim reports as a historical source\"-The article examines what other important information the widely read travelogues of late medieval Jerusalem pilgrims have to offer the historian, in addition to the the actual, religious concerns of their authors: especially for the"
