The present volume, which contains works by authors who now reside in Hungary, seeks to deepen the nonspecialist's knowledge of the literature appearing after World War II, not by offering an overview through the contributions of numerous authors, but by giving most attention to the works of ten major figures chosen from among the many who established their place d u r i n g the first two decades after 1945 and by presenting a few works of fourteen writers selected from those who first published in book form between 1965 and 1975. More space is devoted to prose works than to poems, so that readers can note some of the recent experiments in prose fiction and the sharp growth in treatises on literature, developments that deserve much more attention in English translation than they have received to the present. Almost all the selections are complete; the only excerpts are taken from two long poems by Ferenc Juhasz and a long poem by Laszlo Nagy, from three literary treatises, and from the interviews. It was difficult to choose authors from a period so torn by historical events and tested by radical social changes, and so rich in literary activity—and particularly difficult to select the ten major figures whose work would appear in Part One. To give unity to this section and, at the same time, to draw attention to some significant trends, I used specific guidelines in making my decisions. For example, I did not consider authors whose lifework could not be represented\n\nxvi\n\nPreface\n\nadequately by their short writings. More important, those chosen had to be among the writers who are widely read by intellectuals in Hungary, who exert considerable influence on current literary developments, and who measure up to the critical standards of world literature. Finally, their lifework had to treat themes that I thought would be of interest to general readers and not narrowly developed in detail. Although in Part Two I could not proceed as methodically, I tried to give a taste of the most recent work that I thought would appeal to the general reader and that promises to influence writing after 1975. The selections are usually presented chronologically, as determined by the earliest date of publication that I was able to validate. The writings of the poets are grouped under poetry and prose, respectively, in both categories either by date of publication or, when necessary, by their place in the most recent collections supervised by the author. An exception is the work of Agnes Nemes Nagy, which follows the reverse chronology that she adopts in the second and enlarged edition of her poems, The Horses and the Angels (A lovak es az angyalok, 1969). Her more recent poetry, however, follows chronologically after the selections from this collected edition. The selections by prosewriters also follow these principles of organization, except for the work of Istvan Orkeny and Istvan Csurka, whose stories are arranged by themes. Also, wherever literary treatises and interviews are included, they close the selections from the author's works. In all instances, the Hungarian title of a selection appears in the Table of Contents, along with its date of publication, which is in italics if I traced it to a periodical, in regular type if to an edition of the author's works.\n\nAs editor, I express my deepest gratitude to all who have contributed their creative energies so generously to the venture since its formal inception in 1974: to those translators whose new translations in the text open fresh paths to the literature; to Kathy Tezla and llona Kovacs for the practical bibliography designed for readers who want to extend their knowledge of twentieth-century Hungarian literature beyond the boundary of the present book; to Laszlo Orszagh, a close associate and friend of three decades, for the guide helping nonspecialists with the pronunciation of Hungarian words; and to Kent Bales, Joseph Duncan, and Joseph Maiolo, colleagues at the University of Minnesota, to the first two for their valuable comments on the editorial matter and to the last for his helpful counsel in choosing the fiction. I also owe a great debt to the staffs of the National Sze\"che\"nyi Library and the Library of the Institute of Literary Studies, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, for making available to me so promptly and efficiently the large amount of materials my reading and research required during three short stays in Budapest and also to the funding agencies that made these indispensable visits possible: the International Research and Exchanges Board,\n\nPreface\n\nxvii\n\nthe Hungarian Institute for Cultural Relations, and the University of Minnesota's Office of International Programs. The preparation of this anthology was an exciting adventure, often a very moving experience for me. I hope that readers will enjoy what they find here and that their knowledge of life and understanding of themselves will be enriched by the individual insights of these authors from a little-known literary heritage. Albert Tezla\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nMajor Developments in the Imaginative Literature of Hungary since 1945 Albert Tezla More formidable impediments to the development of the literature of a small European nation can hardly be found than those present in Hungary during the postwar period. During these thirty years many historical events rent the intellectual and social fabric of the country. Hungarians had to bear the moral onus of the long alliance with Germany and of the savage acts of the native fascists, the Szalasi Arrow-Cross Party, in the closing months of the war. They had to restore the economic life of a land devastated by war and burdened by Soviet occupation. Their early attempts to revive national life occurred amid crucial struggles among political parties vying for popular support. When this discord ended with the sudden assumption of power by the Communist Party in 1948, Hungarians experienced radical upheavals in all parts of their lives. After eight years of the new social order, smoldering discontent with Party measures erupted in the Revolution of 1956, leaving Hungarians to face the consequences of the horrible blood-letting and the failure to reestablish a democratic government. The twenty years since that spontaneous uprising have witnessed the consolidation of a single-party socialist state, producing a profound impact not only on the economic and social life of the nation but also on the cultural policies that govern all the arts. Even this brief summary of the chaotic and complex realities of postwar Hungary suggests that the circumstances in which creative writers had to work would pose grave barriers to the revival of literature and its evolution into a valuable interpreter of the human scene, as it had clearly shown signs of doing between the\n\nxix\n\nxx\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\ntwo world wars. In spite of the turmoil and uncertainty often attending these years, however, Hungarian authors developed a rich and varied imaginative literature, which, to a remarkable degree, eventually measured up to the enthusiasms and expectations that so many of them had expressed at the beginning of the post-war period.\n\nThe Early Post-War Period, 1945-48 At the end of the war, the atmosphere of freedom, unknown to Hungarian authors since the nation had been linked to Hitler's Germany in the mid-1930s, produced an outburst of literary activity. With censorship lifted and intellectual horizons unobstructed, all kinds of writing, including socialist, were published. There was much experimentation, and before long, many views of life and forms of expression existed side by side, particularly in poetry and fiction. This great surge of creativity was energized by many new journals that zealously advocated certain literary approaches, as well as partisan political viewpoints, and, for a time, found common ground in supporting humanistic principles. Although the struggle for power among the several political parties often interfered with literary activities, writers were vigorous enough to withstand the paralyzing effects of the worsening political atmosphere and to set in motion various trends so firmly that many outlasted the cultural policies put into effect in 1948, when the Communist Party took control of the nation. Understandably, much of the imaginative literature appearing from 1945 to 1948 critically examined the events and social order of the previous twenty-five years that had culminated in the disaster of war. But, more significantly for the restoration of literature, authors probed issues ranging from current conditions in Hungary to the purpose of human existence and the nature of the universe. Certain poets among those who had established their reputations before the war stood out in this regard. There was Lorinc Szabo, long an experimenter in verse forms, with his pessimistic view of humankind's struggle in an indifferent cosmos, and Milan Fust, a pioneer of free verse in Hungary, who rebelled against fate and felt deep compassion for humanity. Lajos Kassak, an early advocate of the avantgarde in both poetry and the visual arts, abandoned social themes to express his most intimate thoughts and feelings. Above the scene towered Gyula Illyes, the populist and poet of lyrical realism, who explored the issue of responsibility in the relationship between the individual and society, weighed thoughtfully the question of human efficacy, and viewed the problems of humankind from a historical perspective. Istvan Vas, like lllye\"s a major inspiration for many young poets, was distressed by the anxieties pervading the times and offered the inherent strength of human reason and individual freedom as the best defense against calamity. Among the Communists, Zoltan Zelk pressed forward the need for revolutionary changes in the social and economic fabric, and Laszlo Benjamin,\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nxxi\n\nwho published a volume of poems in 1939, urged radical reforms, based on his personal ideas, that would prepare the way for a socialist state. At the opposite pole, Sandor Weores, divorcing himself from reality, searched for a private vision of a universal force that only a turning inward to the self could attain. These experienced poets were soon joined by those who would establish their place under conditions already looming on the political horizon. They fell into two groups. There were those who, as avowed Communists, dedicated themselves to the revolutionary transformation of their society: Ferenc Juhasz, Laszlo Nagy, and Istvan Simon, all of them from the poor social classes living in the villages. And there were those who, shocked by the moral implications of the war and Hungarian fascism, searched for new ethical and spiritual foundations on which to rebuild a relationship with life: Magda Szabo, who later wrote successful novels, Janos Pilinszky, Agnes Nemes Nagy, Laszlo Kalnoky, and Gyorgy Raba. The responses of these two groups and of prose writers who emerged at the same time to the stress and strain of impending historical events largely determined future trends in the post-war literature. Prose fiction also manifested vitality at this time, although its themes and styles were not as various as those of poetry. For the most part, novelists and short-story writers preferred the values and attitudes of realism, and to arrive at a moral reckoning with their past, mainly re-examined Hungarian society since the end of World War I, analyzing sociologically and psychologically the semi-feudal social structure that lasted until 1945. This tradition, so firmly entrenched by the prolific and long career of Zsigmond Moricz, was best represented by several pre-war writers who were still active. Pal Szabo, another populist from the 1930s, portrayed peasant life and the conflicts between peasants and the intelligentsia. Pe\"ter Veres, then fifty years old, looked at peasant life in a satirical and humorous, though realistic manner. Laszlo Nemeth, more inventive than both, wrote his best novel, Revulsion (Iszony], in 1947. It depicts the problems of a family and life in a village through the confessions of wife whose marriage is falling apart. Also appearing at this time was fiction with a strong socialist theme, some of it written before the end of the war but not publishable until now. Probably the best example is Tibor Dery's The Unfinished Sentence (A befejezet/en mondat, 1947), which traces the gradual involvement of a middleclass intellectual in the cause of the working class between the two world wars, a narrative based on the author's past relationship with the proletariat. Another new current, one that soon caused serious problems for originality, was socialist realism. Bela Illes, an experienced writer just returned from Moscow with the Russian army, published a representative example, Carpathian Rhapsody (Karpati rapszodia], an affectionate portrait of Ukrainian life in the Carpathian Mountains, which appeared in thirteen editions between 1945 and 1960. During these three years, other kinds of narrative representation did not develop significantly. They were present and had the potential to modify the realism\n\nxxii\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nthat became such a fixture of the literary tradition. Unfortunately, the pressures of the times and social forces meant there was little opportunity to reconsider the purposes of prose fiction. To be sure, in the war years novelists were already experimenting with some elements of surrealism. Among the most accomplished were Emil Kolozsvari Grandpierre, Gyorgy Ronay, Istvan Soter, and Geza Ottlik, who were familiar with pre-war developments in the European novel and were associated with the progressive but short-lived literary periodical Silver Age (Ezustkor}. Some of the more promising authors among those making their debut immediately after the war vacillated between alternative styles and literary purposes. Imre Sarkadi turned to socialist realism for a time, believing that it served the needs of his country more productively than the realism of Zsigmond Moricz, which he had previously adopted; Istvan Orkeny, Ferenc Karinthy, and Lajos Mesterhazi—who later became influential figures under changed historical conditions—first experimented with surrealism and then, for the same reason as Sarkadi, held up the mirror of socialist realism to their society—a mirror soon to be obligatory. lva\"n Mandy and Miklos Meszoly were also on the scene. Mandy was presenting an everyday world with an almost surrealistic mingling of the actual and the dream; Me\"sz6ly, who had quickly mastered the use of atmosphere in the short story to convey meaning, was experimenting with narrative techniques and style in search of new paths for Hungarian fiction. In 1948, amid these mixed trends and searchings, Laszlo Ne\"meth pointed the way that not only novelists but all writers must henceforth travel to foster a viable imaginative literature. In his view, the end of the war had brought a wider horizon to a literature that had just begun to mature between two world wars. \"Now there is,\" he proclaimed, \"no longer a national destiny; all humanity is now one nation, and the fate of everyone will be settled together: it is my right, indeed my duty to think about the whole human race.\" In the summer of that very year, the establishment of Communist control over national life abruptly arrested stylistic experimentation and the pursuit of Ne\"meth's concept of the writer's universal role.\n\nThe Effect of Schematism, 1949-52 The Communist Party's coming to power began the gravest period of literary creativity that Hungary had ever known. The Party's cultural policy seriously hobbled developments in imaginative literature for many years. Besides instituting radical economic and social changes and nationalizing all theaters and publishing houses, the government declared socialist realism, as promulgated in 1946 by Andrey Zhdanov in Russia, to be the sole course for the arts. In order to publish, writers were expected to adopt a schematic approach that interpreted reality in accord with socialist principles as the Party hierarchy defined them. Essentially, schematism, or socialist realism carried to an extreme, demanded that the writer abandon the right to select themes, surrender a personal interpre-\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nxxiii\n\ntation of issues, and forsake a distinctive style. Writers had to subordinate individual views and conform strictly to prevailing Party ideology. Accordingly, imaginative literature was to achieve victory in the class struggle against bourgeois elements, to glorify heroes of the socialist revolution and vilify its enemies at home and abroad, and to sing about five-year plans, agricultural cooperatives, common people enjoying the fruits of socialist policies, the imminence of the earthly paradise that socialism would inevitably create, and the battle against capitalists for world peace. Moreover, to attain its strictly didactic aim, the style of a work had to be democratized, made simple and clear, so that uneducated workers and peasants could grasp and pursue the objectives of socialism. Failure to comply with these dictates did not necessarily shut every door to publication, especially in periodicals. The slightest departure from them, however, brought published accusations that the author had abandoned the nation, betrayed the proletariat, become apolitical, or turned to romantic self-indulgence. The rigid enforcement of this cultural policy by severely party-minded critics in an atmosphere charged with political threat and insecurity left open only two paths to writers who did not espouse the values of socialist realism out of personal conviction but who chose to remain in Hungary. Neither boded well for the acceleration of the vital trends that had emerged between 1945 and 1948. Writers could carry out the official policy if they were willing to act against the grain of their individuality and work below the level of their true gifts—the path chosen by such important authors as Gyorgy Somlyo, Gabor Devecseri, Imre Sarkadi, Ferenc Karinthy, and Istvan Ork6ny. Or like Sandor Weores, Istvan Vas, Janos Pilinszky, Agnes Nemes Nagy, Ivan Mandy, Geza Ottlik, Miklos M6sz6ly, and others, they could leave the literary scene if they were not willing to compromise the integrity of their convictions and style. This is not to say that all literature of high quality vanished from public view. However, the aggressive enforcement of schematism nearly brought the evolution of a diverse literature to a standstill, particularly during the early 1950s, an effect openly acknowledged today by Hungarian critics and literary historians. The drama, its revival hardly begun, was made ridiculous by the dogmatic presentation of social issues from everyday life. Lyric poetry, the most highly developed genre in Hungarian literature, became platitudinous, its imagery commonplace, its forms repetitious, and its thought impoverished. Given the circumstances, it is not surprising that even among those supporting socialism only the more accomplished poets were able to write lyrics worth reading. Illy6s, his prestige as a revolutionary populist ensuring his authority, continued to treat a wide range of themes; and Benjamin, his convictions deeply rooted in revolutionary traditions, infused his endorsements of the social changes taking place with enthusiasm and intense feeling. Among the new poets, Ferenc Juhasz, Laszlo Nagy, and Istvan Simon also managed to convey genuine emotions because they envisioned a better future for the social classes who had only recently begun to enjoy\n\nxxiv\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\neconomic and social benefits. Prose fiction, with Moricz and the recent socialist realists in the Soviet Union serving as its exemplars, suffered even more severely than poetry. Even such eminent older writers of realism as Dery, Pal Szabo, and Veres, who successfully adapted their works to socialist realism, could not always erase every trace of disharmony between the official style and their convictions. Many established novelists chose to write autobiographies, autobiographical novels, and novel cycles presenting broad pictures of recent times. And often the heaviest burden of schematism fell on such authors as Karinthy, Sarkadi, and 6rke~ny, who were striving to discover their individuality under the self-censorship that their attempt to weld literary purpose with political ends inflicted on them. But in the long run the regime was not able to force writers into a single mold. Resistance to schematism as administered chiefly by the doctrinaire Jozsef Revai surfaced early, often publicly. Gyorgy Lukacs, the renowned Marxist philosopher, aesthetician, and literary historian, took issue with R£vai and gave legitimacy to the reality created by the imagination. In the spring of 1951 authors strongly protested its injurious effect on originality at the First Congress of Hungarian Writers, which was summoned to evaluate the literary developments of the previous three decades and to fix the role of literature in a socialist society. Its proceedings were reported in the periodical The Star (Csillag] and then were expanded into a book published in the same year. During the sessions Benjamin and Juhasz objected to policies affecting literary creativity and pointed to their inevitable consequences. Benjamin criticized the poetry being published for flatness and lack of inspiration. The youthful Juhasz complained about editors who accepted only works that slavishly adhered to the standards of schematism and attacked certain colleagues, including Benjamin, for their dull depictions of reality. And addressing the heart of the problem, he insisted that poets had the right to express their beliefs in a style natural to them. The next year Re\"vai challenged the prestigious De\"ry for \"misusing\" socialist realism in Answer (Felelet, 1952), an attack that underlined the widening gap between official critics and the most important members of the writing community. Revai charged De>y with falling short of Party expectations because his youthful hero did not join the Communist Party. In reply Dery protested that he could not realistically make his bourgeois protagonist a member of a political group that in the 1920s, the time of the story, was merely an obscure \"sect\" in Hungary. During these years such clashes between official critics and writers were regularly reported in Budapest by two periodicals, The Star and Literary News (Irodalmi Ujsdg) and in the provinces by literary and cultural journals like Transdanubia (DunantCil}.\n\nThe Thaw, 1953-56 The year 1953 saw a crucial stage in this conflict. The period known as the Thaw began when, as a result of massive economic disarray and Stalin's death, the liberal-\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nxxv\n\nminded Imre Nagy replaced Matyas Rakosi. In this less oppressive atmosphere, writers increasingly ignored the demands of schematism. For example, Benjamin took a firm stand against Stalinism, and Illy6s responded not only to domestic matters but to large philosophical questions and, at a more personal level, to the sad fact of aging and the inevitability of death. In the pages of New Voice (Oj Hang), the vehicle of young writers, Juhasz and Nagy freely divulged their gloom at what they found in the world around them. Juhasz, whose \"The Boy Changed into a Stag\" W. H. Auden called one of the greatest poems of this century, shared with readers his agony at the sight of human suffering; Nagy, dismayed by the limited satisfactions that human toil brings, yearned for simple pleasures to enrich life, in \"The Bliss of Sunday,\" one of his more compassionate poems. In a series of poems published in The Star and Literary News in August 1953, a new poet, soon widely read, Sandor Csoori, cried out at the disastrous disruption of peasant life that collectivization had wrought. It was also significant that the poems of Weores and Vas appeared again, first in journals and then as editions, and more slowly, also those of Janos Pilinszky and Agnes Nemes Nagy; and the fiction of Imre Sarkadi and Ferenc Karinthy, now critical of their society, was also published again. In an article appearing in Literary News in November 1953, Istvan Ork6ny, who had suffered some of the severest treatment at the hands of official arbiters, captured the essence of the change that seemed to be taking place. He asserted that in the new climate a socialist writer no longer needed to embellish reality, that the truth as the writer saw it could be told without the guidance of official directives, and that, as always, the writer alone was responsible for what he or she wrote. This statement did not necessarily sound the death knell of schematism, but its wide acceptance by other Communist writers, even one as orthodox as the poet Lajos Konya, augered well for fresh directions in literature. At this time two developments in policy governing translations indicated that the literature of the West might again become more abundantly available than in recent years. Several publishing houses had, since 1950, been issuing translations of writings from all ages and literatures only as a secondary responsibility. Moreover, they published a narrow selection of twentieth-century works, preferring those of Russian writers and of western authors critical of their political and economic systems, such as John Steinbeck and Howard Fast. The unhappy consequence of this policy was that Hungarian writers, though not completely cut off from foreign literatures, were isolated from most of the more recent imaginative works in the West. This unfortunate situation was alleviated by the founding of two agencies that, unlike existing presses, were to publish translations only. The earliest of these is significant because of a change in its original scope. Created in 1954 to publish only translations of Russian literature, Oj Magyar Kiado (Europa since 1957) broadened its mission to include more recent examples of world literature. The importance of the second lies in its emphasis on immediacy.\n\nxxvi\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nIn 1956 a journal called The World (Nagyvilag] was founded to keep Hungarians informed of trends through translations of more recent works from all parts of the world. These two vehicles, still functioning, opened ways to current writings that had a substantial impact on literary developments after the uprising in October of 1956.\n\nThe Time of Consolidation, 1957-62 The month of internecine bloodshed during the revolution and the Russian army's eventual crushing of all resistance left the Hungarian people with the tremendous task of restoring normalcy to their daily lives. During the period of consolidating the nation in compliance with socialist principles, writers, quickly recovering the momentum built up under the relaxed policies of the Thaw, advanced markedly toward a variety in imaginative literature not seen since the years immediately after the war. From 1957 to 1962 writers who supported the ideals of socialism abandoned schematism, and those who did not espouse socialism or strict didacticism in imaginative literature were again published in growing numbers. Not unexpectedly, poetry resurged first. The many poets with various views and styles who were frequently published in the early 1950s soon appeared in anthologies. Those who were already familiar to readers before the revolution were included in a 1957 anthology entitled 105 Poems of 15 Young Poets (15 fiatal kdlt'6 105 verse], which contained several selections by the promising Margit Sz6csi and the brash Sandor Csoori. This anthology is considered a milestone in the history of literary developments because not one poem evinced a trace of schematism. Quite different but equally important historically is another anthology, Fire Dance (TUztanc], which was published the following year. The poets in this volume rose to the defense of the embattled socialist cause in distinctive ways. Among them were Mihaly Vaci and Mihaly Ladanyi, thirtyfour and twenty-four respectively, the first furthering the interests of the proletariat and the liberation of all colonial peoples from imperialism, and the second lashing out against any middle-class weaknesses still present in Hungarian society. Also included was Gabor Garai, whose ethical view of revolutionary communism and its extension to all humanity placed him in the forefront of post-1956 socialist poetry. To these two groups must be added two poets who, like Sandor Weores, returned after a long absence: Agnes Nemes Nagy and Janos Pilinszky. Nemes Nagy returned with Heat Lightning (Szarazvillam] in 1957, her first book since 1946, and Pilinszky with On the Third Day (Harmadnapon] in 1959, his first book of poems in thirteen years. Unlike the preceding poets, they were not concerned with political or purely domestic issues; their vision embraced all humankind as they explored the ethical implications of their inner conflicts. Both bore the wounds of their times. To offer consolation, Nemes Nagy, tormented by the susceptibility of human emotions to the deceptions practiced by\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nxxvii\n\nthe world, searched for those invisible points where the transient and permanent meet. Pilinszky was seared by the moral debacle of contemporary civilization, especially as symbolized by the inhumanity of the concentration camp, and he suffered the Stations of the Cross that marked humanity's way. The many strands of thought and expression represented by all these poets tied into a warp that ensured their personal growth and led to major developments in Hungarian poetry in the altered circumstances of the 1960s. In this six-year period, prose fiction showed signs of developing beyond its traditional commitment to a realism characterized by sociological and psychological analysis, careful articulation of plot, strict adherence to time sequence, and detailed description. As in poetry, schematism vanished, and the way opened to fresh viewpoints and techniques. The elevation of fiction to new artistic levels required contributions from authors determined to express their interpretations of life in their own way. Casting off schematism entirely, both Imre Sarkadi and Ferenc Karinthy now assumed their true character. Sarkadi, unfortunately a suicide in 1961, freely criticized socialism for its deception of the people. Perceiving that even successful social reform would leave untouched many grave problems, he offered in his narratives the ethical insights of humanism rather than those of socialism. Like Sarkadi, Karinthy registered his criticism of the course that socialism had pursued in Hungary, and turning his fertile imagination to themes found in the life of a big city, he revealed a playfulness and narrative skill that later matured in a novel, EPEPE (EPEPE, 1970), a remarkable allegory of alienation and limitations in communication between human beings set in an imaginary metropolis. Developments in fiction were also greatly influenced by a group of writers who emerged from 1953 on, many of them becoming major figures in the 1960s. In 1957 the short stories of the more important of these authors were collected in an anthology called Initiation (Emberavatas], its title taken from a story by Ferenc Santa about a youth encountering the double-edged experience of becoming an adult. Unaffected by schematism and not strictly bound to traditional modes of realistic fiction, yet committed to socialism, these authors made clear early that they were seeking new paths in realism. Many succeeded, adding to those followed in the writing of Sarkadi and Karinthy. Among them, Santa, Erzs6bet Galgoczi, Istvan Szabo, Gyorgy Moldova, and Istvan Csurka particularly introduced new themes and fresh techniques that helped to enliven fiction. Ready to take issue with their society, they all focused on urgent matters. Santa posed ethical issues, pondered the efficacy of revolution in producing constructive change, and extolled the role of the individual conscience, exalting the authority of the writer's conscience above everyone else's. Both Galgoczi and Szabo depicted the disruptions in peasant life resulting from collectivization, the former using nearly sociographical details lyrically and the latter applying psychological analysis. Moldova and Csurka, more oriented toward urban life, portrayed\n\nxxviii\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nthrough penetrating satire and caricature the bizarre contradictions between socialist reality and its ethical ideal. Of course, many novelists and short-story writers then coming into their own, like the young poets included in the anthology Fire Dance, staunchly supported socialism. Noteworthy among them were Lajos Galambos, Karoly Szakonyi, and Istvan Gall, who endorsed and defended the version of socialism that evolved after the Revolution of 1956. These fundamental developments were importantly enhanced by the novels and short stories of two other groups of writers. Impetus was given to new trends by the long-delayed return of authors who had preferred silence to being stifled by schematism: Magda Szabo, Ivan Mandy, Miklos Meszoly, and Ge\"za Ottlik, who, like the poets Janos Pilinszky and Agnes Nemes Nagy, were historically associated with the progressivism of the defunct periodical New Moon (Ojhold}. Magda Szabo published two novels, Fresco (Fresko, 1958) and The Fawn (Az dz, 1959), launching a new career; in her works, often concerned with the clash between old and new values, she used the stream-of-consciousness technique with special skill. Mandy, whose last book, excluding his stories for children, had been published in 1949, returned in 1957 to chronicle with almost poetic means the lives of unsuccessful characters living on the fringes of society in Budapest, such as those in \"The Watermelon Eaters\" or the mother in \"A Summer Holiday,\" who is out of place in the new socialist order. Me~szoly, who had not been heard from since 1948, published in 1957 a collection of stories, written during his silence, that reached sensitively for the innermost human emotions, often disclosing them, as in \"Shade,'; in an atmosphere of elemental eeriness. Of this group, Ottlik achieved the most immediate and dramatic impact on readers. After publishing a book of short stories in 1957, he caused a sensation in 1959 with a novel, School on the Border (Iskola a hataron], in which he symbolized the innateness of human savagery with a shocking picture of young military cadets discovering within themselves many subtle ways to torture one another, somewhat as William Golding does in Lord of the Flies. The second group consisted of three similarly minded writers who launched their careers in the middle of the decade. Like the authors who returned after several years' absence, Laszlo Kamondy, Endre Fejes, and Gyula Hernadi disclosed an independence in their choice of themes and styles. Kamondy, never touched by schematism and not attracted by socialist realism, published an edition of short stories in 1957 and in 1960 a sparsely phrased novel, Descendant of the Apostles (Apostolok utoda], that demonstrated his penchant for careful psychological analysis and thoughtful exploration of intellectual and moral problems. After Fejes put out a collection of short stories called The Liar (A hazudos, 1958), which often portrayed characters living on the boundary between dream and reality, he next produced Generation of Rust (Rozsdatemeto, 1962), a widely acclaimed novel that used cinematic techniques to draw a painfully detailed portrait of the life of a postwar middle-class family functioning\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nxxix\n\nwith mistaken values. Of the three members, Hernadi, whose first stories appeared in 1954 when he was twenty-eight, revealed the most dynamic tendencies for experimentation, a feature of his creativity that links his spirit with that of the older M6szoly. In 1959 a collection of his short stories and his novel On the Steps of Friday (A pentek lepcsoi) appeared. Both works were rooted in the suffering experienced by his generation as they searched for the meaning of life in the difficult times in which they grew up, and they already displayed the surrealistic touches that later became typical of his style as he continued to confront the agonizing moral choices contemporary humans must make. The large variety of themes and the many techniques present in the contributions of these two groups and of the authors previously discussed indicate that fiction was mustering new strength and many adherents during these six years, in spite of the near paralysis of originality and inspiration it had endured from schematism and the shambles in which the 1956 Revolution had left the nation.\n\nThe 1960s and 70s The more temperate climate of the early 1960s brought the richest growth of Hungarian literature since the years immediately following World War II. By this time the consolidation of the nation's political and economic life in accord with Marxist-Leninist socialism, a process proclaimed complete at the Eighth Party Congress in 1962, had undoubtedly produced greater stability in the daily lives of the people. The reduction of tensions between the government and members of the writing community cultivated an atmosphere in which literary creativity could prosper more easily. Several changes in cultural policy made it possible for the activity stirring since 1956 to increase. Opportunities for publication were expanded, although state control of publishing houses and the burden of self-censorship remained in force. Authors were less and less isolated from the world community, especially the West, and the quickening flow of translations of the latest literature helped them to evaluate their writings in the context of world literature and to react to the newest currents of thought and style. Ampler opportunities to travel abroad also enlarged their perspectives, although such travel was subject to strictest government control. Hungarian authors actively participated in writers' conferences in the West, and many of them visited the United States through a long-term program instituted in 1964 by the Ford Foundation, which included the translation workshop and writers' conferences at the University of Iowa. Still another change was the publication of literary criticism that once again applied sophisticated individualistic methods of analysis. Authors of imaginative literature published treatises that freely explored the nature and function of literature, and their distinct speculations sparked readers' expectations of new literary experiences. But the most liberating factor was the official acceptance of a role for the\n\nxxx\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nwriter different from the prevailing one, a role that had already evolved to a significant degree but was only then being acknowledged, often tacitly. Writers felt freer to exercise the right that Juhasz had so passionately claimed at the First Hungarian Writers' Conference in 1951: f use the creative imagination, even confessionally, to explore universal questions of human existence as the writer responded to their unfolding within the recesses of his or her inner world, stirring reflections in readers that led them to deeper perceptions of life. This new latitude and other signs of growing liberalization represented significant gains for writers determined to speak in their own voices, to discover wha,t they are through self-realization. Of course, if they were to publish, they had to show moral purpose, and could not attack the regime, and always ran the risk that their works would be interpreted by established arbiters. But within these severe limits they secured the measure of freedom necessary to raise to new levels the literature that had been developing since the end of the war. From this time on, literary activities became more vigorous and diverse. A new age seemed to dawn. Writers whose works were published before the war added to their achievements in climactic, often different ways. Among novelists De>y was, perhaps, the outstanding example of what the changed atmosphere made possible. Released in 1961 from prison and absolved in 1962 of all charges relating to his participation in the 1956 uprising, he disclosed new artistic tendencies. Exploring universal problems of life and the historical choices forced upon the human race, he wrote short stories and several novels that expressed a passionate concern about the destiny of twentieth-century civilization. Among them were The Excommunicator (A kikozosito, 1966), a historical parable of the personality cult, and Imaginary Report on an American Rock Festival (Kepzelt riport egy amerikai popfesztivalrol, 1971), a terrifying account of human cruelty and barbarity drawing on the events of the 1969 Rolling Stones festival in California that culminated in a riot and the murder of a black youth by the Hell's Angels. Before his death at eighty-three in 1977, De>y added several other works to the body of his work: Cher Beau-Pere (Kedves bopeer, 1973), an ironic and illusionless novel about an old man's infatuation with a young woman; The One-Eared Man (A felfulU, 1975), another ironic novel satirizing the absurdities of western life present in the kidnapping of Paul Getty, Jr.; No Verdict (helet nines, 1969), memoirs reflecting the adversities through which his generation had lived; and, in 1972 and 1975, editions of his meditations, which he called \"flotsam,\" about daily life and the unique problems of the present century. Poets well known before the war continued to contribute to developments, sometimes changing their views and feelings. Gyula Illy6s, returning after a long absence, published seven books of poetry between 1961 and 1973, not to mention some plays, a philosophical novel on old age called On Charon's Ferry (Kharon ladikaja, 1969), and several collections of essays. The lyrical realism of his poems remained, but their humanistic themes increased and focused on\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nxxxi\n\nthe transitoriness of life and the inevitability of death, becoming more philosophical and less engaged with domestic matters. Istvan Vas, who still applied the rational faculty to human experience in precise verses that seldom used metaphorical language, now became a father figure to many of the younger poets. He faced life without illusion, and he viewed humanity somewhat skeptically. Laszlo Benjamin composed leaner lines, less adorned poetry than before, and although he remained a committed Socialist, he expressed some resignation and pessimism not present in his writings of the 1950s, and felt some doubt about the power of poetry to improve humans and society. And finally, Sandor Weores particularly benefited from the more temperate climate, which gave a greater opportunity to share with readers the individuality of thought and style that he had always fostered. That course of development is made clear in a collection of his works published in 1970, augmented by a third volume in 1975. Magically versatile in devising form and selecting images, he widened and deepened his use of oriental and primitive myths, often in ways as arcane as those of William Blake, putting many of his best poems beyond the reach of translators. In such books of verse as Fire Fountain (TCizkut, 1964), Sinking Saturn (Merulo Saturnus, 1968), and Psyche (Psyche, 1972), Weores searched for humankind's place in the universe. These works created a cosmic and mythic world in which a passive inward-turning, made possible by oriental thought, mystically merged the self with a universal will of which all things in time are a manifestation, so that every aspect of conscious reality is transformed into ephemeral expressions of that universal will within the evermoving processes of time and nature. Although these authors and others with long careers remained vital and influential, the literature of the 1960s and 1970s was chiefly in the hands of those new writers who had established their standing during the post-war years. Among the poets who had appeared in the historic anthology Fire Dance, Mihaly Ladanyi, Mihaly Vaci, and Gabor Garai were now well out in front. Convinced that poetry is an instrument of reform, Ladanyi passionately opposed anything impeding socialism in Hungary. Vaci defined the worth of his poetry solely by the extent to which it reached those who, in his view, had been trod upon by capitalism, seeking to embrace them with a love born of his sharing their suffering. Of the three, Garai grounded his revolutionary ideals most deeply on general philosophical and ethical principles. In time both Vaci and Garai altered their attitudes to a degree. Before his death in 1970 at forty-six, Vaci was troubled about the prospects of improving the human condition and unsure if the power of poetry could produce change; Garai did not modify his ideas, but his poems eventually evinced some dejection and feelings of isolation. With these poets must be included Istvan Simon, whose career began at the same time as that of Juhasz and Laszlo Nagy, and also Imre Csanadi, whose first book was published in 1953. The tone of these two poets' commitment to the post-1956 socialist\n\nxxxii\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\norder is more subdued than that of any of the preceding. Simon, who died in 1975, offered to readers as much joy and escape from human cares as he possibly could, trusting ultimately in the strength to be discovered in the world of nature. Csanadi, whose meditative bent became more philosophical in the 1960s, expanded his themes beyond the peasantry, and humor gradually permeated his work. Attracted by the language of folk poetry and blending it with twentieth century speech, he speculated about human fate, attempting to reconcile individual destiny and the events of history, an effort effectively represented by a cycle of poems capturing in words the ancient Hungarian world of visual art. But during these two decades, it was the poetry of Juhasz and Laszlo Nagy that gained the largest following. Still avowed Communists, they suffered greatly from the painful paradoxes of events occurring since the revolution, and they experienced deep internal crises as they strove to bring their vision to their people. They wrestled with some of the most perplexing themes, Juhasz reaching into the sciences for imagery and Nagy, though also using scientific images, always preferring natural and mythical imagery. The theme of death's inevitability is central to their thought, but each searched for consolation in different directions. Determinedly, sometimes desperately optimistic, Juhasz sought the union of the self with the eternal universe. At first Nagy was confident that poetry had the power to create a valid relationship with reality for humankind, but he turned brooding and contemplative, seeking escape in poetry and finding solace in the supportive strength of love and, at times, relief in playful poetic moods. Experimenting freely with verse forms, as had the older lllye\"s and Vas, both poets contributed importantly to the variety of forms that became a prominent characteristic of the poetry of the 1960s and 70s, especially to the open and intricate long poem and the prose poem, which enabled the poets of the time to convey the layers of complexities they found in the turmoil of the present century. Equally essential as Juhasz and Nagy to poetic developments were Janos Pilinszky and Agnes Nemes Nagy, who became increasingly influential. Neither of them as prolific as Juhasz and Nagy and many other contemporaries, and, like Emily Dickinson, favoring the short stanza and poem and the scrupulous crafting of images into almost aphoristic lines, they both sought an intellectually and emotionally acceptable reconciliation with the terrible moral violations of the self that pervade twentieth-century reality. Pilinszky, to whom the tragic collapse of morality during the war remained a permanent part of reality, struggled with his conviction that human beings can only passively register what is taking place in the world, that they do not shape it, that every experience simply happens to them. His sense of human tragedy is poignantly imparted throughout his career, in a poem as early as \"Fish in the Net\" (\"Halak a haloban,\" 1942) and as recently as \"Self-Portrait 1974\" (\"Onarckep 1974\"). Nemes Nagy, sharing this personally desolating view of the moral malaise of the world, nevertheless trusted that manifestations of a better existence for humanity could be experienced in the emo-\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nxxxiii\n\ntions stemming from the intellect under the disciplined expression of lyric poetry, a belief strikingly developed in the magnificent \"Akhenaton\" (\"Ekhnaton\"). Prose fiction prospered even more dramatically than poetry in the relaxed atmosphere. Freer to select and examine issues critically and to cultivate an individual style, novelists and short-story writers laid the foundations of a modern fiction that may achieve the stature of Hungarian poetry. In the fifteen or twenty years since the revolution, the post-war authors of fiction, like the poets who came to the forefront in the same period, searched persistently for life's meaning amid the turbulence of the contemporary world. Provokingly analyzing situations, they explored such overriding problems of twentieth-century civilization as the autonomy of the individual, the ethical nature of the human personality, and the clashes between the individual conscience and the demands of society. These key dilemmas were treated chiefly and most effectively by some of the authors who had appeared in Initiation back in 1957 and those present earlier who had refused to adopt the,modes of schematism. On the whole these authors yielded less to the authority of the social system, and their narratives used their own motifs and problems to stimulate the readers' thought rather than to impose solutions on them. Istvan Szabo, who died in 1976 at age forty-five, improved his narrative skills in short stories about peasant life, drawn, as before, from his personal experiences, and Erzs6bet Galgoczi enlarged her perspective by creating peasant protagonists endowed with attributes that transcended the simple particularity of village life. It is Ferenc Santa, however, who, not limiting his narrative sources to his early years in a village, cultivated a wide spectrum of human experience. The life of a village youth depicted in his early stories like \"Little Bird\" (\"Kicsi madar\") and \"Fairyland\" (\"Tunderkert\") was followed by portrayals of humans making ethical decisions in situations that historical circumstances visited upon them, as in \"No More Dying Then\" (\"Halalnak halala\"). Moral dilemmas dominated his explorations of the authority of the individual conscience, his seeking to account for the way Hungarians cruelly turned on one another during the revolution, and his raising the issue of the worth of revolutionary activity itself. It was also during this time that Gyorgy Moldova and Istvan Csurka, casting a critical eye at their society even more than before, satirized the contradictions they observed between principles and realities. Moldova, who also made major contributions to sociographic literature, wittily portrayed the foibles of Hungarians and the shortcomings of their society. After several novels about Hungarian life in the troubled 1950s, he published in 1972 a historical novel, narrated in the manner of old chronicles, about forty Hungarian Protestant preachers sentenced to the galleys in the seventeenth century for refusing to renounce their faith. In 1975 he completed the first part of a trilogy describing, through the life of a twelve-year-old Jewish boy, the tragic history of his people in Hungary from 1944 to 1945, when they fell victim to the vicious fascism of Szalasi and the notorious Arrow-Cross Party. Csurka also directed his\n\nxxxiv\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nbiting satire at Hungarian society, at its political absurdities and the shortcomings of life under the new social order, as in works like in \"The Two Rheumatics\" (\"Ket reumas\") and \"The Passengers\" (\"Utasok\"). His short stories, novels, and plays presented a bleak view of the human condition, an existence controlled by chance, despite humankind's confidence in the efficacy of planning and action. He often found in the life of gamblers and the race track the symbols for his interpretation of existence. Perhaps the novelists who published again after a long silence evinced an even more distinctive choice of themes and techniques than did the preceding authors. Magda Szabo's frequent novels were soon translated into many languages. Using the unsettled history of twentieth-century Hungary and the responding flow of thoughts and emotions within her characters, she depicted the conflict between old and new concepts with warmth and psychological insight. From the mid1960s on, Gyula Hernadi extended the scope of his themes to the problems of the Hungarian professional classes and, chiefly in the 1970s, to the intellectual and moral choices that history has imposed on contemporary humans. In 1971 his The Fortress (Az erdod] appeared, a horrifying novel about successful businessmen paying for the opportunity to play at real war within a fortress in Greece staffed by mercenaries. He experimented with a mixture of real and surreal images, sometimes to intentional excess, as the title of the novel The Dry Baroque (Szaraz barokk, 1967) implies. He often used nearly every style found in twentieth-century literature, including science fiction, the absurd, and the grotesque, as shown in a selection of short stories, Gates of Logic (Logikai kapuk], published in 1975. Three other writers had a most significant bearing on improvements in prose fiction: Ivan Mandy, Miklos Meszoly, and Istvan O'rkeny, who died in 1979. Mandy and Meszoly were building on careers that they had resumed shortly after the revolution, and Orkeny, long silent after that upheaval, began publishing again in the mid-1960s. Mandy, whose novel On the Touch-Lines (A palya szelen, 1963) was praised by Heinrich Boll, wrote with poetical concreteness about the world of the coffeehouse, the shabby side of the big city, and, later, the life of journalists, old-time movie stars like Greta Garbo, Harold Lloyd, the Danish comedians Zoro and Huru, and King Kong, and various activities connected with the cinema. His short stories and novels were influenced by surrealist modes and existential viewpoints, and they were unrelievedly pessimistic about the prospects of the human race. Meszoly, always in the vanguard of writers experimenting with narrative techniques and still arousing controversy, sought factual objectivity. Particularly effective was his portrayal of the inner states of characters, even their most irrational moments, through concrete details and facts, a mode typified by a novel, Accurate Stories on a Journey (Pontos tortenetek, utkozben, 1970), in which he used the techniques of the cinema direct to recount a woman's visit to the place of her youth. Earlier novels explored contemporary issues.\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nxxxv\n\nDeath of an Athlete (Az at/eta halala, 1966), his first novel and first published book since 1957, related the tragic story of a man who, unable to find inner peace, drove himself to death seeking even greater achievements as a middle-distance runner; Saul (Saulus, 1968) chose the story of Saul from Acts 8-9 to delve into the moral implications of power. Meszoly, who is inclined, as in \"A Map with Lacerations\" (\"Terkep, repedesekkel\"), to present characters in transit without much regard for time sequence, was constantly concerned with the psychological conflicts of individuals who are incapable of making anything of themselves in the place they occupy, of establishing a constructive balance between themselves and that world. Orkeny, the third of these major novelists, after a long and painful re-examination of his style and attitude toward civilization, decided that the grotesque was most compatible with his temperment. Returning with two books in 1967, he quickly took a commanding place in Hungarian literature with bold and absurd short novels—some adapted as plays —and many \"one-minute stories\" (egypercesek], a new grotesque-absurd genre pinpointing with amazing brevity, yet with deep meaning and often with affection, the problems plaguing human beings caught in the paradoxes of today's technological world. The efforts of such writers as these produced radical changes in Hungarian fiction that continue today. Fiction, particularly the novel, has discarded, in the main, the episodic and descriptive techniques of realism and the panoramic mode in vogue for the more condensed and dramatic forms of the short novel. Rejecting the older modes that had developed as means of \"reflecting\" social reality, they chose the more startling and demanding forms of narration to impel the imagination to grasp the complexities of twentieth-century civilization: many-layered symbolic suggestion or exaggeration, the distortions of the grotesque and the absurd, the shaft of satire, and the shadings of irony. These experiments and the domestication of foreign literary influences promised the development of a prose fiction increasingly deserving of attention outside Hungary. The appearance of many new authors primarily after the mid-1960s confirmed the creative vitality of poetry and fiction. The new poets generally fell into two categories: those who linked themselves with the works of Illyes, Juhasz, and Laszlo Nagy, the last being especially influential, and those who were inspired by the poems of Weores, Pilinszky, and Nemes Nagy. Among those in the first group were Istvan Agh, Istvan Bella, Ferenc Buda, Laszlo Kalasz, Sarolta Raffai, Jozsef Ratko, and Simon Serfozo, who were called the Seven (Hetek) because they appeared together in an anthology. Often associated with them were Marton Kalasz and Anna Kiss, who wrote differently and began their careers independently of them. These poets tended toward the autobiographical, often describing their struggles with poverty and declaring their devotion to those who had suffered economic hardship, and their support of the social order. Of the original Seven, three matured the most. Agh began writing more intellectual and abstract\n\nxxxvi\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nverse than he had earlier, even though he was still commenting on the changes in his society, especially in the life of the peasant. Bella, influenced by Laszlo Nagy and Sandor Csoori and partial to fixed poetic forms, called loneliness the major human experience, but frequently accepted the authority of ethical behavior in the relations between human beings. Ratko, whose extensive use of detail gave his poems a sociographic character, made death the major theme of his poetry, devoting a large share of his more recent verse to struggles against senseless and premature death. Belonging to the same poetic tradition were the Nine (Kilencek], who also appeared together in an anthology, Unattainable Earth (Elerhetetlen fold, 1969), a publication made possible by Laszlo Nagy, who also wrote the introduction and was their chief poetic inspiration. These young poets were Laszlo Gyori, Benedek Kiss, Jozsef Konc, Istvan Kovacs, Katalin Mezey, Imre Molnar (later Pentek), Janos Olah, Endre Rozsa, and Jozsef Utassy. In the beginning they wrote about their personal difficulties in life and voiced their protests. Their views reflected the sufferings endured by their parents' generation: the daily difficulty of making a living and the horrors of the war. Endre Rozsa and Jozsef Utassy became the most outspoken pleaders for justice, the former contemplative and philosophical, the latter energetic and dynamic. With the outstanding representatives of the Seven and the Nine must be mentioned Miklos Veress, who shared their desire to face life instead of retreating into a private world. By the mid-1970s Veress loomed large among the young poets holding this attitude. His successful blending of old and new themes, belief and skepticism, and seriousness and playfulness, combined with a mastery of a wide range of verse forms, revealed a poetic rigor that the bad health from which he had always suffered could not diminish. Essential to the varied development of poetry were those young poets who chose Weores, Pilinszky, and Nemes Nagy as their models. Like the older poets, they avoided the problems of national welfare in their works, preferring to unfold the innermost life of the human personality from highly distinctive viewpoints. They were greatly drawn to pessimistic philosophies, and their outlook on life was disillusioned and ironic. The earliest of these young poets were Istvan Csukas, Tibor Gyurkovics, and Otto Orban. Csukas, whose first works drew on his boyhood years on the Great Plain, developed a style fusing folk and avantgarde poetry; Gyurkovics, whose style is highly condensed, composed love and confessional poetry and was deeply absorbed in his personal feelings and anxieties. Of the three, Orban achieved the most dramatic evolution in theme and style, his technique and imagery substantially influenced by Weores and by knowledge gained as a prolific translator of world poetry. Orban mixed the ironic and the grotesque, and occasionally introduced obscenities. To this group of young poets must be added Imre Oravecz, Gybrgy Petri, and Dezso Tandori. Both Oravecz and Petri cultivated the short lyric poem as their major art form, and Petri,\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nxxxvii\n\nwhose disenchantment with existence often plunged him into deep pessimism, imbued his poems with the tones of self-mockery. Tandori, who also translated widely from world poetry, was the most versatile member of this group. Boldly, playfully experimental and inventive, he created unusual, even odd verse forms and altered the structure of long-established ones like the sonnet to express dramatically his pessimism about humanity's being able to escape finitude, to break out of the eternal limitation of time and space. In his view, human existence is completely determined; it is beyond the reach of assessment and improvement. The future of prose fiction also remained auspicious. As is customary in Hungary, short stories and novels by new writers were published more slowly than works by new poets. But with the publication of their writings in growing numbers after 1965, the prosewriters gave clear evidence of following and modifying paths created by authors during the climactic stage of development in the first half of the 1960s. Three of the novelists who began publishing after 1965 were, like Laszlo Marsall among the new poets, in their later years. Two of them had been known as essayists, G. Gybrgy Kardos and Gyorgy Konrad. In 1968 Kardos published The Seven Days of Avraham Bogatir (Avraham Bogatir net nap/a), a story about terroristic activities in Palestine experienced by the author himself after World War II, which was followed in 1972 by Where Have All the Soldiers Gone? (Hovd tuntek a katonak?}, another story about Palestine, this time about Polish soldiers who are aliens in their present world and the one they left behind. Both novels demonstrate the author's sensitivity to dramatic situations and his power to create atmosphere and develop characters. In 1969 Konrad, whose works immediately influenced young writers, brought out The Caseworker (A latogato], a novel about the inefficacy of bureaucratic attempts to deal with social problems, which he followed with another novel, The City Founder (A varosalapfto], in 1977. Both works were translated into English. The third author was Anna Jokai, whose first book, 4447, a novel, appeared in 1968, when she was thirty-six years old. Since then she has regularly published short stories and novels looking mainly at the difficulties of children and families and the life of women from a psychological viewpoint, though, as in \"The Angel at Reims\" (\"A reimsi angyal\"), she has treated other motifs effectively. Unlike these three novelists, all the young prosewriters making their first appearance were born into the new socialistic society. This historical fact had a strong effect on their views of the times, perhaps even a surprising one. Unlike most of their predecessors and many young poets of their own generation, they did not, on the whole, look upon themselves as representing a particular social class or sociological background; thus they did not engage in the class struggle or use sociographic materials to the degree so common in earlier Hungarian fiction. Not burdened by programmatic commitments or by a sense of responsibility for the social system, they examined their world as independent minds relying on personal experiences, and they approached problems from a fundamentally\n\nxxxviii\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative \"Literature\n\nhumanistic stance. In general, they presented a picture of young people striving to gain control over their lives but, failing to achieve that autonomy, turning to a life of dislocation, of aimlessness. Among their most frequently used motifs were those of the generation gap—often symbolizing the protagonist's clash with society—of the search ,for employment, of trying to participate in a social order that seemed to push the young to its periphery. Amid dissatisfaction, disillusionment, and alienation, these new writers fixed their sights on the integrity of the individual personality and the means of achieving it. As they looked at the world and the internal distress of characters, they used mainly the representational modes of realism. Both Gyula Marosi and Istvan Csaszar were concerned with the role of the individual in society. Marosi concluded that life does not provide opportunities for humans to accomplish great deeds, or nurture convictions able to move humanity to noble achievements. Csaszar often portrayed characters hopelessly trapped in tensions between themselves and the role society forced upon them, wearing masks to survive. Other writers using similar themes were Szilveszter Ordogh, Peter Modos, and Istvan Csorsz. Ordogh delineated peasant life and the strain existing between peasants and their intellectually advanced children; Modos, whose first book, The Run (A futas], came out in 1967, depicted the crises of adolescents and university students; and Csorsz successfully analyzed the mental states of members of the hippy generation. Also among these young writers were those who, influenced by such authors as Mandy, Meszoly, and Orkeny, took even greater care in choosing themes and stylistic techniques. Vilmos Csaplar, tending toward the grotesque, portrayed anxiety-ridden protagonists who were prevented by society from acting genuinely. Peter Lengyel turned to a different source of tension, the divided personality which is seeking to uncover some continuity between adulthood and childhood. Miklos Vamos was unhesitatingly critical of contemporary Hungarian life in his depictions of loneliness and isolation. Geza Beremenyi also emphasized the tension between the individual and society, the frustration of personal dreams and desires, creating grotesque effects with blendings of reality and fantasy and frequently using historical materials. Gabor Czako stood alone in his uncompromising ethical attitude toward human conduct. Exploring the inner stresses of characters whose personalities are being stifled by circumstances over which they have no control, Czako nevertheless held them fully responsible for what happened, no matter how tragic the consequences to them. Most recently, Peter Esterhazy, a descendant of the famous family, sparked a controversy among Hungarian critics and readers. Having published his first collection of short stories in 1976 and another in 1977, he revealed structural inventiveness in his latest and most successful major work, Productional Novel (Ssshort [sic] Novel) (Temelesiregeny [kisssregeny] 1979). It mercilessly satirizes the learned institutes and work-places in Hungary dealing with problems of industrial and agricultural production and, in a set of notes longer than the novel to which it is appended, pre-\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nxxxix\n\nsented a picture of Esterhazy's life and an exposition of the novel's genesis. During the 1960s the Hungarian drama, still the least developed of the major literary genres, also responded to the relaxed atmosphere in ways that held promise for its future. After 1957, established authors like Tibor Dery, Gyula Illyes, and Laszlo Nemeth continued to write for the stage, often presenting domestic issues through past historical situations, with Dery occasionally examining contemporary problems satirically. And new post-war writers like Imre Sarkadi and Ferenc Karinthy pressed upon audiences, not so much political as moral issues, often in experimental theaters. The influence of Brecht was, of course, very strong, but as the cultural policy governing translations grew more liberal, other dramatists pointed to innovations for Hungarian playwrights to adapt. Their increasing familiarity with the works of O'Neill, Miller, Durrenmatt, Tennessee Williams, Albee, who visited Budapest in fall 1963, and Pinter spurred them to consider new techniques and to widen the scope of ideas for dramatic representation. To these influences were added those of the Theater of the Absurd through the writings of Beckett, lonesco, and Genet, not only their technique of imagistic patterns but also their concept of a bewildered humanity abiding in a universe without purpose and past comprehension. Under the impact of these influences and the greater opportunity to stage plays, drama began in the mid1960s to lose the provincialism from which it had long suffered. At this time the work of Istvan Orkeny was especially important. His plays, particularly The Toth Family (Totek, 1967) and Catsplay (Macskajatek, 1970), which was adapted from his novel of the same name, were influenced by the absurdists and brought to the stage characters desperately trying to realize themselves in a world that always eluded their grasp. Janos Pilinszky's recent experiments with poetic drama also have injected new possibilities for the theater. Even more affected by the directorial techniques of Robert Wilson than by the dramatic modes of Beckett, he seemed to be abandoning the linear development of plot and character for unrelated scenes of states of mind in which past, present, and future frequently coalesce, as most recently in Children and the Soldiers (A gyerekek es a katonak, 1978), a three-part play that presents images of the horrors of war as if in a dream. The plays of Istvan Csurka added liveliness to the drama. They are concerned with the absurdities of the Hungarian scene and the unhappy spectacle of humans completely controlled by chance, the latter concept being effectively portrayed in Who Will Pay the Piper?(Ki lesz a balanya? 1970), which consists entirely of a dialogue at a poker session between players completely out of step with life and unwittingly revealing themselves to one another. The achievements of these writers, added to by the distinctive contributions of Ferenc Karinthy, Gyula Hernadi, Geza Paskandi, and the younger Geza Beremenyi, indicate that the Hungarian drama may be moving toward a fertile age. Since the early 1960s Hungarian poetry and fiction have developed ever\n\nxl\n\nMajor Developments in Imaginative Literature\n\nbroader scope and refinement in the forms of expression. In the atmosphere of greater social stability and the acceptance of a more personal function for literature, growing numbers of Hungarian authors now offer their distinctive voices to world literature in its continuous effort at helping humankind deal with the conditions of life. Further enrichment of this literary experience is, as everywhere, largely dependent on leaving the creative spirit free to steer its own course and to share its vision with readers, a view openly endorsed by many critics in Hungary today. Clearly, the early challenges to schematism by many writers and their perseverance through the most trying historical circumstances have produced a diverse literature of high artistic quality, serving a centuries-old culture that has always given the literary imagination a paramount role in forming an understanding of the human condition.\n\nHow to Pronounce Hungarian Words Laszlo Orszagh What follows is not a learned discussion for linguistic experts but a highly simplified guide for general readers who wonder how the Hungarian words in the text are pronounced. To indicate the pronunciation of a language with the letters of another tongue is by no means an easy undertaking, because a considerable number of the letters of any alphabet represent different sounds in different languages. Therefore, this method can never yield more than a somewhat primitive imitation of the foreign pronunciation. That is why professional linguists have devised a very precise but highly complicated system of phonetic transcription that for obvious reasons cannot be used here. Fortunately, the relationship between Hungarian spelling and Hungarian pronunciation is relatively consistent and, on the whole, free from such absurdities as the five different English pronunciations of the -ough cluster (though, cough, tough, plough, through) that are likely to frustrate most beginning students of the language in almost any country. There are, of course, a sufficient number of difficulties in Hungarian pronunciation. For example, there are the vowels written with various accent marks over them and some invariable consonant clusters; but the \"marked\" vowels and the consonant clusters are always pronounced in exactly the same way and do not play tricks on the unwary non-Hungarian. Another, but one may say natural, difficulty is that in any language in the\n\nxli\n\nxlii\n\nHow to Pronounce Hungarian Words\n\nworld a few sounds exist that are completely missing from a great number of other languages. In such instances, an approximation is of very little help. Thus the English vowel of but, cut, shut, or the English th sound (this, both] and w (we, where] simply do not exist in Hungarian and can be only very inadequately approximated. Similarly the Hungarian letters o and Ci have no equivalent in English and can be approximated only with German or French sounds. In the pronunciation key appearing below, each of the Hungarian letters is followed by an English word in which the Hungarian sound of the Hungarian letter, or often only the nearest approximation of the sound, occurs. Those letters of the English sample-word that are the nearest equivalents of the sound of the Hungarian letter are printed in italics. At the end of the alphabetical list is a very short list of exceptions and curiosities.\n\na a\n\n= hdl = far\n\nb c\n\n= book = Its\n\ncs = chmch d =^og dz = heac/5 e = hat e = may f =m g =0et gy = Juke (British pronunciation) h =/)it i = b/t\n\nf \\\n\n= meet =yet\n\nk\n\n=/?ill\n\nI ly m\n\n= look =yet = man\n\nn ny o 6 6 o\n\n= no = new (British pronunciation) = dog = store = thirst, or in the French word \\e = the long vowel in the French word deux\n\np\n\n=pot\n\nr\n\n= red (Scottish pronunciation)\n\nHow to Pronounce Hungarian Words S\n\n=S/7Jp\n\nsz t ty u u u u v w x y\n\n=sit =fip = rube (British pronunciation) = put = fool = the short vowel in the French word due = the long vowel in the French word rue = vote = vote (the same as v) = fix = sit (but if preceded by g, I, n or t see under gy, ly, ny, ty) =zip = measure\n\nz zs\n\nxliii\n\nIn archaic spelling (especially in a few surnames) one occasionally finds clusters that have long since been simplified in current Hungarian.

His father was the proprietor of a noted pharmacy in the capital; his grandfather operated a small vinegar factory in Verbely (now Vrable, Czechoslovakia), a little village where Orkeny regularly spent his summer vacations until he turned twenty. Belonging to such a well-to-do family, he traveled abroad frequently before World War II, and lived in France for two years, in England for one. To please his father, he first obtained a pharmaceutical certificate and then earned a university degree in chemical engineering. Eventually, however, against strong opposition from the members of his family, he chose to follow a writing career. His short stories soon appeared in Belles-lettres (Szep Szo), a progressive literary journal edited by Attila Jozsef, the ill-fated poetic genius of the 1930s. His first book, Dance of the Ocean (Tengertdnc), showing initial traces of the grotesque outlook to which he returned nearly twenty-five years later, appeared in 1941. Unfortunately, his budding career was cut short by a call into army service. Reporting for duty in an officer's uniform to which he was entitled by earlier service, he was upbraided and ordered to return in civilian clothes; then, as a Jew, he was assigned to a labor battalion and sent to the Russian front. Captured after six months, he spent four and one half years in a Russian prisoner-of-war camp. His experiences during these years had, he says, a powerful impact on his outlook on life and his literary creations. The insight he derived from close observations of human capacity for good and evil,\n\n3\n\n4\n\nIstvan Orkeny\n\nwhich was so theatrically compressed and polarized by war, made him very cautious about passing moral judgment on individuals: he came to understand, he says, that circumstances determine the morality that human behavior reflects. More important, his living with captives from many nations and all social levels helped him to perceive for the first time that all human beings are members of a single community because each of them has \"individual memories, passions, longings, and sufferings.\" This understanding gave him, he reports, that sense of solidarity with humanity from which all his writings stem. Shortly after his return to Budapest at Christmas 1946, he published the two accounts of his imprisonment that he had written on wrapping paper between 1942 and 1946 in the camp. He entered into the literary life fully and energetically, sharing the enthusiasms and hopes that pervaded the efforts of authors to revive and advance the country's literature and to lift the defeated nation out of its most recent historical tragedy. In 1949 he was dramaturge for the Young People's Theater, and from 1951 to 1953 co-dramaturge for the Hungarian People's Army Theater. His writings showed tendencies toward realism long before he had, he notes, even heard of Zhdanov, Stalin's arbiter of cultural policy; and he accepted the official doctrine of schematism in the belief that the schizophrenia it imposed on his literary perceptions was the necessary price to be paid for hastening national recovery. Nevertheless, he was, in 1952, publicly attacked, particularly by Jozsef Revai, the party-line doctrinaire literary critic, for bourgeois sympathy and for misrepresenting a party official in \"Purple Ink\" (\"Lila tinta\"). He acknowledged his error as a flaw in artistic technique. His literary career continued to flourish, and by 1956, in addition to reports and sketches, he had published several collections of short stories, a novel, and some plays. These successes, however, concealed Orkeny's growing dissatisfaction with all forms of realism as adequate means of portraying his specific relationship with present reality. Accordingly, he viewed the post-1956 setting as one in which, slowly at first but ever more quickly, certain possibilities for literary expression were once again developing as they had after the end of the war. \"Self-abandon, literary experimentation, and artistic playfulness,\" he remarks, \"were again enfranchised after a time during which terribly and increasingly severe deliberateness had already grown so conscious that in the end it completely erased the author's soul from his written work.\" In spite of this welcome release from the schizophrenic state in which he had felt compelled to write, Orkeny entered upon a period of public silence that, except for a story published in 1963, remained unbroken until 1966. Working long hours as a chemist in a factory, he used this ten-year period to \"look myself in the eye, to evaluate what was inside me: my strengths, talents, propensities, and delights.\" He ultimately discovered that he had to cultivate anew that playfulness, that grotesque outlook which had been present in his earliest short stories and had occasionally resurfaced in his\n\nIstvan Orkeny\n\n5\n\nwritings even while he was centering his imagination on realism. This insight initiated a new phase in his development, one that eventually gave him a unique and influential place in the literature of his nation. In 1966 he gathered the choice fruits of his ten years of labor and published under the title The Princess of Jerusalem (Jeruzsdlem hercegnoje) some short stories and a short novel called Catsplay (Macskajatek], the last adapted as a play in 1969. In his succeeding publications, he viewed the contemporary scene ever more strictly through the grotesque, leaning toward the absurd, among them: Honeymooners on Flypaper (Ndszutasok legypapiron), grotesque stories, which also contained The Toth Family (Totek), a short novel, an experimental attempt to express the grotesque view in longer form, 1967; The Toth Family, adapted as a tragi-comedy from the short novel, 1967; One-Minute Stories (Egyperces novellak], 1968, followed by enlarged editions in 1969 and 1974; and Blood Relations (Verrokonok), a play, 1975. A four-volume edition of selected writings appeared in 1971-73. Since 1966, his writings have solidly established his reputation at home, and he has gained a wide audience abroad through his plays, which have been staged in many countries, including the United States, where Catsplay was the hit of the 1977-78 season of the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He has also received several literary awards: The Attila Jozsef Prize in 1953 and again in 1963, the Grand Prize for Black Humor in France in 1970 for The Toth Family, which had been performed in Paris in the fall of 1968, and the Kossuth Prize in 1972. Although Orkeny continues to experiment, the grotesque outlook and its wide-ranging forms of expression are undoubtedly compatible with his individuality, serving, as he claims, quite possibly as an autobiography of his humor. Time being the home of all human beings, the twentieth century banished him, he says, from \"the solitude\" of his cell \"apparently to follow more faithfully the inconstant and unassuagable feverishness\" of the present age. To him, the grotesque cries out against the horrors of the twentieth century resulting directly from the unvigilant confidence and easy optimism that western civilization has inherited from the nineteenth century. In his view, the grotesque is a flowering of a prophetically dreamed, imaginary world reacting against the monster abiding in humanism, the monster tragically symbolized by the carnage of two World Wars, the holocaust of Auschwitz and Treblinka, and the moral horror of Hiroshima. Through the grotesque he is able, he asserts, to grasp the essence and terifying contradictions of contemporary times. By looking at life through its lightshattering prism he can use absurd suppositions to create new coordinates for a sovereign world in which, for example, obedience to \"the law of gravity\" means that a dropped object necessarily falls up, not down. This imaginary sovereign world—its creation, he suggests, demanding from the author the \"gesture\" of a kamikaze pilot—offends the readers' sense of symmetry, turns their world upside down. Nevertheless, this cosmic disruption is believable because the new proper-\n\n6\n\nIstvan Orkeny\n\ntions of the imagined world are both complete and logical. In the end they make readers laugh or laugh and cry at the same time, but they always compel them to shudder, like a spectator at a tragic play. Among his works, the one-minute stories provide an extraordinary experience of the world whose dimness he seeks to penetrate. These stories are, he states, the first of his writings in which he probably has not compromised himself or his art, though only time can really tell. The antecedents of these sometimes absurdly humorous, sometimes grim, sometimes shocking stories lie in a few works by two early twentieth-century Hungarian authors, Frigyes Karinthy and Dezso Kosztolanyi, and particularly in the six-word and one-line stories of Jules Renard, some of which were translated into Hungarian in the first part of this century. At some time during the period of his silence from 1957 to 1966, Orkeny became convinced that the classical modes of description and plot were worthless; thus he deliberately kept \"whittling away\" at any narrative elements that seemed to serve primarily as ends in themselves. In every way he tried to record only those \"notes,\" those resonances to which readers respond jointly, instead of details of description or action. The impact of these efforts on his style is dramatic. In addition, though he draws his materials from the Hungarian scene and aims his stories solely at Hungarians, Orkeny's vision of the absurdities in contemporary life very often rises above domestic particulars to strike responsive chords in non-Hungarian readers as well. In keeping with his intent, these vibrations are produced not by abstract analysis of the tragic human condition but by the presentation of an imaginary world that forces readers to shudder at the senselessness and horror of life—at utter absence of hope for the existence or eventual creation of a moral world by humankind. This bleak outlook, Orkeny insists, does not lead him to Samuel Beckett's conclusion about the human prospect. He cannot, in the end, accept the notion that life is hopeless and unendurable. Since his concept of existence arises, he notes, not from theoretical speculations but from personal experiences with absurd, hopeless, and unendurable situations, he always finds, in his desperation, a glimmer of light that makes life worth continuing. Surrender to overwhelming grotesqueries and absurdities must be avoided, even in face of the certain knowledge that all will necessarily end in the tragedy of death. Orkeny offers action as the only hope, \"the only egress\" for humans; he has an almost existential faith in \"the saving character of action,\" even in \"the futile action because it still gives us something subjectively.\" Ultimately human beings must, Orkeny claims, agree with Camus's conviction that the moment must come when, despite the futility so painfully portrayed, they \"imagine that Sisyphus is happy.\" In the light of this endorsement of human action, as well as his personal triumph over adversities, it is hardly possible to accept totally the severe limitation that Orkeny imposes on the ability of an author to contribute anything\n\nIstvan Orkeny\n\n7\n\nof value to "
