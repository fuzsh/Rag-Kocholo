Some preliminary thoughts I have about this new website: more photos, a calendar, a place to access forms, and overall a more visually appealing and user friendly website.\n\nA functioning, useful, user friendly, and visually appealing website would greatly improve communication between our program and the students and their families. This could streamline a lot of our communications and save a lot of time. In addition, it could help to create a stronger sense of community/identity within the Hudson Scholars as a central hub (and maybe a point of pride :)"
