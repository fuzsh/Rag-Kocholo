        "text": "I played hockey since I was 3 years old, and traveled all over the country and Canada as I got older. I loved playing , the competitiveness, my teammates and the physicality. I thought I would always play hockey - until I picked up a lacrosse stick and I never looked back. I think my time spent playing hockey helped me in my lacrosse career as I see the field very clearly, am a great passer, and love to score. It also helped my physical game in lacrosse because I realize the importance of contact and defense.\n\nI currently attend the Hackley School, a college prep school. Last spring, I started on the varsity lacrosse team in 9th grade and had 12 goals and 22 assists and we won the NYSAIS championship. In addition, I am currently on the varsity basketball team at Hackley. I play the violin in the chamber orchestra at school, and volunteer at Abbot House where I work with children dealing with immigration, foster care or adoption issues. I have maintained a stead A/B+ average in all my classes including taking advanced Spanish and Calculus, 2 higher level classes. I am scheduled to take the ACT in July.\n\nI play for the Westchester Predators club lacrosse team . This last season we played in the Adrenaline Platinum Cup, NAL, FLG Big X, and NXT Philly invitational tournaments. In addition, I scored in the all star game I was chosen for in the Maryland Lacrosse Showcase, and was MVP in the APex Showcase in October. I am very optimistic about both of my teams upcoming seasons, and look forward to showcasing my talents."
