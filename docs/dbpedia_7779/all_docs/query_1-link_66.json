        "text": "<p>Does anyone know anything about Hackley? It’s in Westchester. I’m thinking about applying there and, as I don’t know anyone who goes there, I want to learn more about it before I do. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t show up, I don’t think. It’s pretty much completely a day school. They have 30 boarders. That’s like 6%. And I googled the school already. </p>\n\n<p>I want to know what the school is like. I want to know what google and hackley’s website can’t tell me.</p>\n\n<p>It is an excellent school. The boarding situation is very few boarders many they are from NYC because it is five day boarding. The academics are rigorous. What else do you want to know?</p>\n\n<p>What are the kids like? Is it a very preppy school? Is it really waspy/jappy? Are the kids down to earth? Or are they very focused on what you wear and stuff? How diverse is it? Is it cliquish? Are the teachers good? How does it compare to other private schools in New York City? Is it good at sports? Is it more of an artsy school? What is it known for? etc.</p>\n\n<p>In short, what I think you want to know is if there was a lightbulb joke for The Hackley School, what would it be? Right? ;>)</p>\n\n<p>It seems like a great school. I wanted to apply because it was so close to New York, but then I found out it was only 5-day boarding.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, that’s mainly why I’m applying there.</p>\n\n<p>Boarding schools are all a little too… remote for me, and I realized a little while later that I didn’t want to be restricted by lights out and mandatory breakfasts. I think what I really want at this point is college. A day school outside of the city is the next best thing. If I go there, I intend on commuting.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in New York City, it may be difficult to do commuting every day. Hackley is in Tarrytown. You would need to takes metro-north to Tarrytown train station. Since the school is not close to the train station, you would need to have to take a bus to Hackley school. It is a long ride from the city. :-)</p>\n\n<p>It’s like a little over half an hour. It’s not that bad. I’d have to leave by 7:15, probably. It can’t be that bad, though, because a bunch of kids at my school come from westchester, so…</p>\n\n<p>I think you can also take the train to Rye Country Day. I think it is the Rye station, and you can walk to the school from there. You should verify this.</p>\n\n<p>The train station in NY is kind of far from where I live, and Hackley either has or is starting a bus from my area so that’s probably how I’d get to school.</p>\n\n<p>I was under the impression that Hackley was a better school than Rye Country Day. Am I correct?</p>\n\n<p>Do you know anything about Hackley, Burb Parent?</p>"
