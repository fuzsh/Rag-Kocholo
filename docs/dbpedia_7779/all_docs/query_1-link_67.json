        "text": "Since 2009 I’ve been on the music faculty at the Hackley School in Tarrytown, NY. There I teach flute, clarinet and saxophone students of all levels. My goal is to provide strong fundamentals in tone production, pitch, rhythm, reading and ear training, with the emphasis on exploring the student’s own creativity and joy in making music. Joy is the key. I ask two things—that my students practice, and that they care about what they're practicing.\n\n​\n\nI also teach from my home in Tarrytown, NY, where I can help more advanced students refine their craft. Here the emphasis is on fine-tuning the student's voice on their instrument, as well as reed and mouthpiece customizing to help make that happen."
