        "text": "STIMSON developed a site plan for a new Wellness Center at the Hackley School, a private college preparatory school, on a forested ridge between the main campus and sports fields to the north. The building is broken into smaller masses configured to form two semi-enclosed courtyard spaces, each anchored by existing gneiss outcrops. The compound is designed to allow these central forested courts to form a spine linking all the buildings together, and connecting them to the surrounding woodlands. They are also envisioned as all-season gardens to serve as outdoor classrooms, promote informal student gatherings in a woodland setting, and encourage contemplation. Due to the steep topography and the substantial roof areas and parking surfaces of the new complex, many stepped treatment gardens were designed as prominent site features to cleanse and infiltrate storm water. Other aspects of the landscape include an informal south-facing amphitheater, forest trails and bridges, and a bus pull-in area and parking lot. The project is aiming for LEED Gold certification.\n\nRecognition\n\nBoston Society of Landscape Architects | Merit Award 2023"
