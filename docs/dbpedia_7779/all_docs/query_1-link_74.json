        "text": "Applications for admission to private schools in the counties surrounding New York City are on the rise, largely as a result of dissatisfaction with the public school systems whose advantages had originally lured families to the suburbs.\n\nThomas Wilcox, a spokesman for the National Association of Independent Schools, said: “Applications are up on nationwide level, from 10 percent to 60 percent, and in the Northeast it is all but a deluge.” He said the movement is “a lot more than schools can handle” and added: “They'd be taking more if they had more room.”\n\nUp to $4,000 in Tuition\n\nThe vast majority of applications are to private day schools rather than boarding schools.\n\nThe estimated 800 private secular schools in the United States have .a student population of 300,000, up from 250,000 a decade ago. “This is quite significant,” Mr. Wilcox said, “in view of the fact that the school‐age population has been falling during the same period.”\n\nParents who choose to take their children out of public schools are paying $2,500 to $4,000 for tuition at day schools — tuition at religious schools is about $1,500 — and possibly $1,000 for private bus service. This is in addition to homeowners local school taxes, which are often $1,000 to $2,000.\n\nDonald Barr, headmaster of the Hackley School in Tarrytown, said that during his 10 years as head of the Dalton School in Manhattan, “most of our students were there because their parents felt they had no other place to go.” Mr. Barr, who left Dalton for Hackley in 1975, cited crime, population shifts and a decline in the level of public education for having convinced many parents to send their children to private schools. Now, he said, “the parents are not running from integration and there's little crime” in the 50‐mile radius of his mid‐Westchester school. “The parents are just unhappy with the public schools,” he said.\n\nThese parents cite lower standards in once‐excellent schools or a perceived failure of the schools to deal with children unable to maintain the academic pace. They also speak of school districts that have been forced, by the voters or high costs or both, to eliminate the special programs and activities that once made them distinctive.\n\nPublic‐school administrators tend to discount any major impact on their school systems. Dr. Robert Campbell, Superintendent of the Harrison School District, which includes both middle‐income, and wealthy families, said: “We do not notice any significant change in either direction.”\n\n“We know that students leave for variety of reasons,” Dr. Campbell said. He said these ranged “from an inability to adjust to the public‐school setting to personal reasons, including religious preference.”\n\n“Some families move into the suburbs with the clear intention of sending their children to private schools in the vicinity,” he added.\n\nThe sense of dissatisfaction emerged last year from a poll of 3,500 suburban residents that was conducted by The New York Times. Eleven percent of those questioned said they had “no confidence” that their children would get “a good education in the public schools,” 40 percent said they had “some” confidence and 35 percent said they had “a lot” of confidence. Schools also ranked eighth in a list of what respondents said they liked most about their communities.\n\nMr. Barr said some families who were attracted to the suburbs by a more relaxed and open way of life “decide after while that they just don't want that same casual approach to their children's education.”\n\nSome religious schools also have gained from the apparent move away from public schools, but to a much lesser extent. Officials of Jewish day schools report increased enrollment, as do some Christian‐oriented private schools, but the Roman Catholic school system has shown a decline. It is estimated that of the nearly 5 million students in all private schools, nearly 3.5 million are in parochial schools.\n\nThe Rockville Centre Archdiocese, responsible for 90 elementary and 19 high schools in the suburban villages and towns of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, reported that the 1971‐72 enrollment of 74,000 had dropped to 52,000 for the current 1978‐79 school year. Last year's drop was only 500, indicating that the decline might be leveling off.\n\nParochial Schools Affected\n\nPeter Caruso of the New York State Education Department's Bureau of Statistics said that nonpublic‐school enrollment had declined at a rate of 3 percent a year in recent years, compared with 3.6 percent a year in public schools, but he added that parochial schools represented 88 percent of nonpublic enrollments.\n\nBrother Kenneth Tracy, a spokesman for the Rockville Centre Archdiocese, said: “We are affected by some of the same factors causing a drop in publicschool enrollments: declining birth rate and shifting population. We have very few students transferring from public to Catholic schools for academic reasons.”\n\nAt Fairfield Prep, a Jesuit secondary school, Robert Sylvester, director of admissions, said applications had expanded from 400 to 600 in recent years and that enrollment was up 10 percent, the most we can accomodate.” The increase, he said, came despite rising tuition and a decline in population.\n\nPreparation for College\n\nSome educators said that in many cases, parents who can afford to do so are moving their children to private schools to prepare them for better colleges. Headmasters confirm that most of their transfers come in the upper grades, with some objecting to it as an ineffectual educational measure.\n\n“It's like coming into the middle of movie,” Mr. Barr said. “Kids ought to be transferred between the 8th and 9th grades, and preferably between the 6th and 7th. Give the private school a chance to turn out new work habits and get record ready for college. College admissions officers are not motivated by snobbery, they look at the transcript, all of it.”\n\nThe ability of parents to send good students to private schools also is also said to have had a damaging effect on public schools, since it deprives them of highly motivated students and parents\n\nCutbacks in Activities\n\nRichard Odell, director of administrative services at the Gill St. Bernard School in Bernardsville, N. J., located in a relatively well‐to‐do part of southern New Jersey, said: “We see an influx from the surrounding communities where people are dissatisfied with the public schools because of many activities they do not offer.” He cited in particular cutbacks in extracurricular activities.\n\nRoy Bunce, director of development at Newark Academy in Livingston, N said of enrollments: “We're running 30 percent over List year. We've had more applications by mid‐March than we did in all of March 1978.” The school's 470 students come from 68 communities, the ma. jority within a 30‐mile radius of the school.\n\nWhat accounted for the sharp rise in applications? “I think it pretty much cen tern around the real or imagined concerns that parents have about what the public schools are doing, or not doing,” Mr. Bunce said. Independent schools, he added, “provide a higher quality education, but we also have the option not to take kids who can't achieve.”"
