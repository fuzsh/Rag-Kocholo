        "text": "Five Hackley students and three chaperones are attending the 2023 Round Square International Conference in Kenya this October. Here is what they are looking forward to. #HackleyAtRSIC2023\n\n“Are you excited to be finally going on your Southern Odyssey trip?” The question from colleagues and students echoes repeatedly in the days leading up to spring break. I manage to rouse up a nominal “yes” without elaboration.\n\nSo, what does the future hold for Hackley and outdoor education? My hope is that we can continue to build on our current momentum and offer fun and exciting outdoor opportunities for our K-12 students.\n\nAs an extension of their history curriculum, and as part of their Big Experience, fourth graders took a trip to Philadelphia on Friday, Oct. 21. It was a springboard to highlight the grade’s focus on leadership and citizenship.\n\nOn October 20, 2022, we welcomed to the Hilltop Jason Reynolds (New York Times #1 Best Selling Author) and Jason Griffin (renowned illustrator) of “Ain’t Burned All the Bright” for a book signing, a morning visit to the Lower School, and two book discussions — first with students in the Johnson Center then with families in Allen Memorial Hall.\n\nSenior Massimo Soto’s short film, Below the Rise: The Untold Story of Costa Rica, was selected at eight film festivals (so far) in three countries — the United States, Spain, and Czechia — and he won an award for Outstanding Excellence at the Nature Without Borders Film Festival.\n\nOn Sunday, Sept. 11, former and current members of Mrs. Washington’s Service Leadership for Social Impact course volunteered at the Hearts and Homes for Refugees Welcome Picnic for recently resettled refugee families.\n\nSeven Hackley students and three chaperones are attending the 2022 Round Square International Conference in England this September. Here is what they are looking forward to. #HackleyatRSIC2022\n\nOn May 21, 2022, three Hackley Juniors—Advith Sharma, Graham Adams, and Noah Nager—organized and led the Finals of the 1st Annual 2022 Westchester Geo Competition on the Hilltop under the guidance of Upper School teacher Mr. Tuo Liu.\n\nBack in the cold winter of 2020, Performing and Visual Arts students joined together for a first ever Hackley Creative Arts field trip to Yale University. That trip two years ago was such a success, it instantly became a fixed event on the Hackley Upper School calendar…\n\nOn Wednesday, April 13, Hackley welcomed artist Thomas Doyle for a day of creative expression with Middle and Upper School students in our art studios and Maker Space. Doyle is the first visual artist-in-residence to visit the school as part of the Creative Residency Program since the onset of the pandemic two years ago.\n\nThis June, Hackley School will welcome an apiary to campus! The apiary will become home to our very own honeybee hive, creating exciting and innovative learning opportunities in science and environmental studies for our K-12 students.\n\nHackley School students in the Middle and Upper School divisions are learning to explore the philosophical dimensions of complex ethical dilemmas, participating in regional and national ethics competitions, and demonstrating what it means to ‘Redefine a Liberal Arts Education,’ a key effort in Hackley’s strategic plan Redefining Excellence: Learning Beyond Boundaries.\n\n‘Promote the Hilltop as a Learning Hub’ is a pillar of our strategic plan Redefining Excellence: Learning Beyond Boundaries. Since the plan launched in 2018, faculty and administrators have asked “how can we accomplish this goal across divisions?” In the computer science department, we have redesigned our curriculum using programs such as Code.org to shift from light skills-based training to intensive code programming. In a safe and supportive environment, students are learning to apply computer science concepts like problem-solving, logical thinking, cause and effect, and computational thinking to other aspects of their lives.\n\nThis year Hackley’s Service team is concentrating their service efforts on addressing food insecurity on a hyperlocal level given the extraordinary challenges 2020 has presented to so many of our neighbors.\n\nUpper School History teacher Christopher Loomis writes about the great opportunities for discovery that were born out of this year's Independent Research in History and English project. From War of the Roses to Harry Potter, 17 juniors and seniors participated in this new academic opportunity."
