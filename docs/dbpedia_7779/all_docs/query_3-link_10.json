        "text": "Prospective and Incoming Parents\n\nHackley parents across generations talk about building close friendships and relationships among the fellow parents they meet as volunteers and as fans on the sidelines, the parents of the friends with whom their children grow and learn. Perhaps because Hackley draws students from so many towns, the school community itself becomes the world we share and make together, supporting each other, sharing wisdom and carpools, looking out for each other’s children and sustaining the commitment to the school’s motto, “United, we help one another.”\n\nThe Hackley Parents’ Association (HPA) creates a wide array of programs and events for parents, and is a valuable resource.\n\nWe encourage you to explore all the material offered on this website to get know Hackley and hear from many members of the community. Current families are also ready and willing to talk to you about their family’s experience, or to help you find your way. To connect with a Hackley family, click here.\n\nIn the spring after the Admissions cycle is complete, incoming families will be introduced to the password-protected Hackley Online community.\n\nCurrent Parents\n\nThe password-protected Hackley Online Community (HOL) offers extensive resources for parents -- from student, family and employee directories to your child’s homework, schedule and report cards. Click the “Hackley Online” button at the top of this page and bookmark the sign-in page. If you need help obtaining your user name and password, the dynamically generated help link is on that sign-in box. Watch this helpful video to see the process."
