        "text": "June 5, 2018\n\nby Pascaline Comas –\n\nJasmine Bayrooti\n\nJasmine Bayrooti is an outstanding young woman distinguished by her spirit and her life goals. At only 18 years old, the senior high school student, at Hackley School in Tarrytown, passionate about computer science, has been involved in many projects and will soon become a freshman at Stanford University. Although she wants to keep her career opportunities open, she is aiming to work in the cyber security field.\n\nLast October, she had the opportunity to participate at the Round Square International Conference in Geneva with four other students from Hackley and two faculty members. Round Square is a global network of innovative schools in 50 countries on six continents that shares a passion for experiential learning and character education. It teaches students about current and future issues.\n\nSupport our Sponsors\n\n“We had speakers about the refugee crisis, we learned about environmental issues and I met so many people from all over the world. It was really amazing, and I broadened my world view,” said Bayrooti. “It was really an eye-opening experience in that way to be exposed to all these global perspectives.”\n\nBayrooti has participated, as well, in the peer tutoring program as a tutor in calculus and physics. She explained, “It was a nice way to integrate the grades and form relationships with younger students. It solidified my own knowledge of the material because when you are teaching something you really have to pass it on and you have to teach students in a way that is comprehensible so they can pick it up.”\n\nAbove all, Bayrooti is passionate about computer science. Not only was she involved in a Robotic Club but in an innovative and very technical project. “I worked with Gunnar Carlsson, a professor who is actually at Stanford. The project is on the applications of algebraic topology which is a very theoretical branch of mathematics that studies shapes and high dimensions and characterizes them. I applied that to video compression and classifying different types of pseudo-random number generators. I also worked with a teacher, Keshena Richardson, who is my math teacher, “explained Bayrooti.\n\nThis project could actually solve data record and compression issues in a very avant-garde way. This talented young scientist will no doubt be a favorite in the cyber security and data field. “Cybersecurity is a very important field as technology is advancing, and security techniques have to keep up with that,” Bayrooti said.\n\nBayrooti feels fully prepared for college. After many years as a home-schooled student, she said Hackley gave her the opportunity to explore an interactive environment with students and teachers as well. The school’s educational atmosphere stimulates interactions and project work between students and teachers. For Bayrooti, that is the most important thing she learned for the future; stay accessible for everybody and do not be afraid to ask anybody.\n\n“I am very excited to work at Stanford with a world-renowned professor,” she said.\n\nWhen asked what advice she would give to high school students preparing for college, she replied, “Follow your dream, work hard and pursue what interests you.”\n\nRead or leave a comment on this story..."
