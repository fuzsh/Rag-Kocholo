She began using the scoop technique that she said she learned at camp. I can’t wait to send her back next year. Thank you Revolution Field Hockey!\n\nMaddie L. - Camper\n\nCoach Leffler was awesome. She was very involved and helped me develop my fielding skills. I'm looking forward to bringing my new skills into the fall season.\n\nHeather S.\n\nMy son had a blast! The staff did a fantastic job of creating a positive and inclusive environment where kids of all skill levels felt comfortable. The drills and activities were not only educational but also a lot of fun. The camp struck a perfect balance between skill development and enjoyment, ensuring that every child had a rewarding experience. We'll definitely be signing up again next year!\n\nMolly R.\n\nI attended GameBreaker Lacrosse Camp to refine my skills during the offseason. The camp exceeded my expectations in every way. The coaching staff provided personalized feedback and tailored drills to address specific areas of improvement. The competitive yet supportive atmosphere pushed me to challenge myself and strive for excellence. I left the camp feeling more confident in my abilities and ready to tackle the upcoming season.\n\nShauna J.\n\nMy son informed me that the coaching at this camp was the best coaching he has ever received. The coaches were particularly good at adapting the program to players of all skill levels. This year was only his second year playing lacrosse and GameBreaker did a wonderful job making him feel comfortable.\n\nSee More Reviews"
