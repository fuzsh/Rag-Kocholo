        "text": "Congratulations, and welcome to Hackley's Middle School!\n\nThe Hackley Middle School is a warm and welcoming community where teachers care about supporting their students academically, socially, and emotionally. It's a place where students build friendships, explore interests, and take safe risks. During their time in Middle School, students become invested in making strong connections and creating a vibrant and inclusive school community rooted in the value of varying perspectives and deep traditions.\n\nBeing a part of Hackley's Middle School means having endless opportunities to learn and grow, surrounded by supportive peers, teachers, and administrators. In Middle School, students learn that their actions matter and they learn to use their voice and resources to truly make a difference in the world around them. They also learn about the importance of what it means to collaborate with and support one another, whether they are working together on a project, on an athletic field, or in a school play.\n\nI speak for my colleagues and our current Middle School students when I say that we look forward to getting to know you and welcoming you to the Hackley hilltop.\n\nWe hope you will join us on campus for one of our Visiting Days and our Middle School New Hornets' Night. Please visit our Middle School Curriculum page for more information about our academic program. Please fill out this form if you would like a phone call or email from anyone in the Hackley community.\n\nIf I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to email me at sdurrani@hackleyschool.org or call me at 914-366-2616."
