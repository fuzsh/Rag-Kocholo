        "text": "At Hackley our Latin motto iuncti iuvamus – “United we help one another” – drives our approach to Classics within and beyond the classroom. We purposefully teach ancient languages in a way that emphasizes collaboration and intellectual community. Technological tools are often used to support learning collaboratively, from Quizlet and Gimkit to tools for advanced lexical analysis and research. The department also provides opportunities for students to connect with the broader Classics community beyond the Hilltop, e.g. by engaging in nationally recognized academic contests, by inviting visiting speakers to campus and more.\n\nCore Skills"
