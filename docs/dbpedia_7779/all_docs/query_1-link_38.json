        "text": "Create a series of culminating “Big Experiences” for Hackley students at important transition points.\n\nStudents and teachers across the K-12 spectrum will collaborate in developmentally appropriate ways to define and develop a series of culminating experiences at key transition points. These “Big Experiences” may range from year-long Service Learning projects in 4th grade to environmental stewardship work in 8th grade to travel and internships in the Upper School. “Big Experiences” will differ in length, depth, and complexity as would be appropriate across the divisions, yet will align with and reinforce the curricular competencies, serving as signature learning experiences at Hackley.\n\nSelected Action Steps:\n\nIdentify and develop the vision for the “Big Experiences” program and its requirements, aligning them with the competency-based approach.\n\nAnalyze academic calendar and student schedules to allow for more flexibility to accommodate the “Big Experiences” program.\n\nCreate a collaborative process for students and teachers to design these experiences.\n\nExplore varying methods of assessment and reporting for these experiences.\n\nCreate new opportunities for culturally immersive experiences both domestic and abroad.\n\nEach Hackley student will have the opportunity to participate in an immersive travel experience to a unique cultural environment, domestic or abroad, at least once between grades 9 and 12. Students will have the opportunity to share their learning with peers and promote the sense of empathy and wonder cultivated by travel.\n\nSelected Action Steps:\n\nInvestigate existing programs abroad and leverage Round Square membership to create student and/or faculty exchanges\n\nfor extended periods.\n\nIdentify and secure resources to ensure that each Hackley student can participate in an immersive travel experience to a unique cultural environment, domestic or abroad, at least once between grades 9 and 12.\n\nDevelop a school-wide Service-Learning program and create a sustainable model for Hudson Scholars.\n\nService-Learning—the blending of classroom-based learning and community service—will be expanded in developmentally appropriate ways. Additionally, we will develop the necessary structures to sustain Hudson Scholars, strengthening Hackley’s connection with the local community and reinforcing the centrality of service to others in a life of accomplishment.\n\nSelected Action Steps:\n\nIdentify the structures and support required to build Hudson Scholars into a four-year program.\n\nCultivate an authentic and nuanced understanding of the concept of Service Learning as a teaching and learning strategy across all three divisions.\n\nEngage current community partners to discuss the Service Learning framework, understand present and future needs of organizations, and identify the possible curricular connections for new opportunities.\n\nUtilize the Hackley Forest and surrounding natural ecosystems to their fullest educational capacities and foster environmental stewardship.\n\nThe community will steward and better integrate the Hackley Forest and surrounding natural environment into the program, including establishing professional development resources for other educators and developing relationships with partner schools.\n\nSelected Action Steps:"
