        "text": "In January of 2005, after a year of planning by committed representatives from independent day and boarding schools across the country, the framework to incorporate this new organization was issued. The Steering Committee announced the birth of the Association of Independent School Admissions Professionals. The mission then and now is to support and advance independent school professionals involved in all aspects of admission and enrollment management while promoting the value of independent school education and the highest standards of good practice.\n\nSixty-five schools, lead by 65 committed professionals, elected to become Founding Schools. Those who have benefited from their vision and commitment thank them, and the development and sustainability of AISAP honors and celebrates their work.\n\nOur Founding Sixty-Five"
