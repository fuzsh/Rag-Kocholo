We have honor students at many Rockland, Westchester and Bergen County public schools including Nyack High School, Clarkstown North and Clarkstown South High Schools, as well as at Hastings High School. Dwight Englewood preparatory school in New Jersey is pleased to receive our alumni. There, the staff notices that our graduates have dimensions of character and engagement that are rare in children nowadays, and the students perform well academically. The Director of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in Riverdale recommends our school, based on our alumni there. We have had graduates attend Green Meadow Waldorf School where the staff reports they “stand out” academically, creatively, and as leaders. Other graduates have attended The Masters School, Hackley School, The Harvey School, Saddle River Day School and Rockland Country Day School. Some students are attending specialty high schools in New York City such as Professional Performing Arts School, Kaufman Center Special Music High School, Bronx High School of Science as well as Rudolph Steiner School and The Dalton School. Some have traveled further to The Darrow School in New Lebanon, New York and The Putney School in Vermont. Other high schools attended include:\n\nOur Graduates | Where They Go from Here | Colleges our students have attended\n\nMaking a Difference | Alumni News | Send Us Your News\n\nBeyond college, we have had alumnae and alumni engaging in a myriad of service learning programs: the Peace Corps in Africa, bringing theater to communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kigali, Rwanda, designing water purification systems for developing nations, working as an Outward Bound-trained teacher in the Bronx. In their professional lives they have taken on careers as potters, scientists, doulas, filmmakers, journalists, musicians, doctors, dancers, entrepreneurs, actors, teachers, photographers and visual artists, among other interesting vocations.\n\nBlue Rock graduates' spirited pursuit of their dreams brightens the world and ripples outward to touch many lives. By pursuing their interests and living life fully, our alums are making a conscious and lasting impact on their communities."
