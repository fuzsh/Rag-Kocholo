        "text": "WAYS TO GIVE\n\nThrough our community-developed strategic plan, Redefining Excellence: Learning Beyond Boundaries, we are expanding opportunities for students both in and out of the classroom. Beyond Boundaries: The Campaign for Hackley’s Future is a call to action. Your commitment to this campaign will build the future for today’s—and tomorrow’s—students. From the Hackley Fund to endowment to the new Center for the Creative Arts and Technology, gifts to Beyond Boundaries provide the resources to prepare our students to be global citizens, well-prepared for a future we can only imagine.\n\nBeyond Boundaries is a comprehensive campaign, and we encourage donors to consider maintaining their Hackley Fund support while making an additional, or stretch, gift to one of the other campaign priorities outlined under “Elevate” and “Create”: endowment and the Center. In addition to the specific priorities outlined, donors may choose to make an unrestricted campaign gift. All unrestricted campaign gifts will be designated by the Board of Trustees to the campaign priority with the greatest need at the end of the campaign. Unrestricted gifts provide Hackley with the greatest flexibility to best support our students and faculty.\n\nThere are a number of ways for you to support Hackley in our efforts, including secure online giving through the form available here (or click on the Donate button), wire transfers, as well as checks made payable to Hackley School. You may also contribute by making gifts of appreciated securities, recommending grants through your Donor Advised Fund, or including Hackley in your estate planning. To read more about making Gifts of Stock, please visit Hackley’s website here."
