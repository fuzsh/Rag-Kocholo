        "text": "By Peter Latson, Hackley School Director of College Counseling\n\nWhen I arrived on campus in July 1997, things were a little bit different than they are today. Bill Clinton was in the first year of his second term in office, and our Headmaster of 21 years, Walter Johnson, was starting his third year at Hackley. Legendary teachers whose collective tenure exceeded 160 years, Misters McNaughton, Pickert, Schneller and McAuliffe, were still teachers, not “gargoyles.” Our current Head of School, Mr. Wirtz, had just graduated from Ohio University, and Upper School Director, Mr. King, was going into his senior year at Colgate. The campus was only one-third of its current acreage, the current Lower School, Middle School, science buildings, and, of course, the new Johnson Center hadn’t been built yet; and Goodhue Hall, entirely renovated after the 2008 fire, would have been recognizable to today’s students only from the outside. Cell phones — much less smart phones — were still relatively rare back then (I took the mobile satellite phone-in-a-box on the freshman trip that year), and only a few administrators had computers at school.\n\nThe college admissions process was also different in some respects. The Common Application was a mere form that students filled out by hand or on the typewriter and mailed into colleges. College websites were still in their infancy. While college application numbers were already on the rise, they were paltry compared to today. Applicant pools were still changing from regional to national in scope and had relatively few international applicants. (And virtually no one from China could afford American colleges back then.) Wake Forest University, now among our most popular colleges, had yet to be “discovered” by the Northeast (Hackley only sent two applications to the university from 1998 to 2002). In fact, even Northeastern University had yet to be “discovered” by most of the Northeast back then! Engineering, perhaps our most popular intended major now, was a relative rarity.\n\nIn our office, a lot has changed as well. Our counseling staff has doubled, and the frequency of our student meetings and parent programs has increased significantly. We now teach our Introduction to College class to all juniors, and they all complete a mock admissions interview with their counselor before the end of junior year. We have developed a method to display detailed college admissions data in an easily digestible format, and we have made a version of that data available to grades 10–12 online. We have made a range of college counseling information available to students and parents on HOL, and we even have a Facebook presence.\n\nNevertheless, one thing would seem very much the same if one were to time-travel back to 1997: the values we espouse in the college counseling process. While the vast majority of Hackley students attend colleges considered among the most selective in the nation, neither admissions selectivity (for its own sake) nor the college brand name are among our primary goals in the college process. Instead, Hackley’s college counselors focus on what most in the business call the college “fit” — finding college matches for Hackley students’ goals, preferences, and aspirations. We dedicate our efforts to helping students find colleges where they will flourish, academically and personally, and which represent a range of admissions selectivity among hundreds of excellent colleges nationwide.\n\nDuring my first year, it became apparent to me that many Hackley students (and their parents) considered a wonderful opportunity — picking colleges — to be a source of stress. It seemed to me like a glass-97%-full or glass-3%-empty sort of thing; Hackley students had all these amazing collegiate opportunities, as well as the preparation to take advantage of them, yet some chose to focus instead on the fact that a very small percentage of those colleges might not accept them. Why would someone choose to see the glass as 3% empty? I came up with the idea for a cartoon that would represent the fact that students (and parents) had the power to choose the attitude they brought to the college search and application process. Fortunately, my talented wife could draw it up for me in nothing flat:\n\nOf course, once I posted this cartoon here and there, around the school and in our handouts, student and parent stress completely dried up and blew away. Every student was happy with every college decision, and I retired and moved to Aruba. Well… not quite. We do hope the illustration helped drive home the point for at least one or two students and parents, and I still keep a copy posted on my office door. But while our values in the admissions process have not changed since then, we are always looking for new and useful ways to frame them for students, parents, and colleagues.\n\nThis past February, the morning after Super Bowl LII, while our students were “nestled all snug in their beds” (presumably with visions of Buffalo wings dancing in their heads), I had the pleasure of attending one of our regular Professional Development Day programs. While I confess that I may have sauntered into the PAC more envious of our students than eager about getting developed, I did in fact leave the meeting quite positive. So what was it that buoyed my spirits during a three-hour lecture in our former, former gymnasium? You guessed it. I was presented with yet another way to frame a healthy perspective on the process that I’ve been trying to help students and parents navigate for more than three decades. This time, in lieu of “attitude,” our focus was “mindset.”\n\nOur presenter, Andrew Watson, President of Translate the Brain (www.TranslateTheBrain.com), outlined decades of research for us in an amazingly clear and digestible presentation. For me, the most important part of his talk focused on what are called “mindsets.” In particular, he spoke about the difference between a “fixed mindset” and a “growth mindset.”\n\nThe fixed mindset individual sees intelligence as something one is born with — something that can’t change. He sees his performance in school as a reflection of this intelligence and an opportunity to demonstrate this intelligence. When faced with difficulty, his habit is to retreat, so as not to demonstrate any lack of ability. He considers failure to be a result of factors beyond his control: his lack of a certain innate ability or outside factors conspiring against him. Success, on the other hand, is a validation of his intelligence and ability.\n\nConversely, the growth mindset individual sees intelligence as malleable, believing that effective work changes one’s intelligence. She sees her performance in school as a reflection of her effort and an opportunity for growth. When faced with difficulty, her habit is to increase her effort to overcome the challenge and continue to grow. She considers failure a temporary condition and expects that persistence will enable her to succeed. Success is the result of perseverance and a validation of effort.\n\nI imagine it is clear to the reader that a growth mindset seems preferable as a character trait for both practical and personal reasons. The advantages of a growth mindset are obvious to educators, who have done a good deal of related research. One finding has to do with praising children; it turns out that praising students for effort (the growth mindset), rather than praising them for ability (the fixed mindset), has tangible benefits for subsequent performance by increasing perseverance.\n\nFor me, from a college counseling perspective, the advantages of the growth mindset are also very clear. In our office, we talk about finding colleges that “fit” our students — colleges that offer wonderful opportunities for students to grow, to learn, to broaden their horizons, to reach out and explore new disciplines, to boldly go… oops, sorry. (I got carried away there.) But hyperbole aside, we have always focused on “college fit” — college as opportunity. Contrary to our outlook, the fixed mindset focuses on college as affirmation of one’s intelligence, and thus focuses on college brand. The fixed mindset sees college brand as the primary goal.\n\nFrom our growth mindset perspective, the college one chooses is about creating one’s future opportunities, not demonstrating one’s eighteen-year old ability. It’s about one’s future, not one’s past. This is not an original thought in education. The title “commencement” — in essence, beginning one’s future — is applied to all graduation ceremonies I’ve ever heard of. In fact, our most important rites all signal beginnings: baptisms, Bar/Bat Mitzvahs, confirmations, commencements, weddings, and even funerals (for those who believe in an afterlife). It would be ridiculous–if it wasn’t so terribly sad–to imagine an eighteen-year-old more obsessed by his or her past than excited by his or her future.\n\nHackley students are very lucky. Their very presence at Hackley indicates that their families strongly support their education, and they have more numerous and better college options than any previous generation. They have an enormous amount of support in the process, not only from us in the College Counseling Office, but also from their teachers, parents, deans, coaches, and everyone they know on the Hilltop. Support and guidance are never more than a short walk, phone call, or e-mail away.\n\nNineteen out of twenty Hackley graduates head off to college truly happy with their college choice. They often come back to the Hilltop eager to share their college stories, and they report how well Hackley prepared them for the challenges they encountered.\n\nAs college counselors, we could not ask for a better school environment in which to counsel students. The faculty and administration overtly support our message and philosophy, and with a little bit of guidance, the students almost invariably support one another to an extent that reflects our school values of being a good friend and helping one another. In this way, we are again fortunate: Hackley exerts a very positive extrinsic force on an intrinsically challenging process. Tales from colleagues at other schools constantly reinforce our sense of privilege in this regard; Hackley is indeed a special place.\n\nNotwithstanding all of this good news, Hackley students are not immune to some of the extrinsic pressures surrounding the college process. The most obvious of these is the set of brand name labels they feel the broader community is using to judge them, especially in a place like Westchester County. One could discount this as a “first-world” problem (which it is), but calling it such doesn’t make it less real to an adolescent. If one focuses on brand names, which are generally related to college selectivity, one creates a win-lose scenario for the student: if he gets into the more selective colleges on his list, he wins; if he only gets into the less selective colleges on his list, he loses. If you take it to the extreme, students should never be happy attending a college that would actually admit them — the Groucho Marx theory of college admission. In that scenario, only those who get into Stanford should ever be happy with the outcome.\n\nIf such a state of mind seems sad and absurd to you, good! You have reason to take heart! Once realizing this absurdity, you can choose to opt out of it, and if you’re a parent, you have the power to save your children from such a fate, since whether or not you realize it, your kids will take your emotional lead in this process 95% of the time.\n\nFor our part, we will continue to encourage both students and parents to adopt a positive, healthy approach to the college process. Whether we call this choosing “fit over brand name,” “a blessed, not stressed attitude,” or the adoption of a “growth mindset,” the choice is still the same. The list of hyper-selective schools has grown over the generations, but the options one faces about how to approach the process are still the same."
