        "text": "Hackley offers students an expansive program full of challenge and opportunity. Our programs support a wide range of pursuits, from organic gardening and robotics in the Lower and Middle Schools to independent science research and advanced studio art in Upper School.\n\nAt Hackley, your child will learn from passionate educators, all deeply invested in the Hackley community and in the success of every student within it. Our teachers get to know students outside of class, appreciating them as athletes, artists, and committed service volunteers. Hackley’s 285-acre campus overlooking the magnificent Hudson Valley sets the scene for our students’ experiential learning, intellectual and emotional development, and lifelong friendships. Our unrivaled facilities marry modern spaces such as the Johnson Center for Health and Wellness to the Tudor-style buildings that frame our quad, all set against the natural beauty of our orchard, apiary, and hiking trails through the Hackley Forest."
