        "text": "This program was established in the schools in 2005 when HCC was awarded a state grant to operate in three middle schools. The purpose of the School-Based Health Programs was to create a model of care for underserved children and youth through health education. Services have continuously expanded to include medical care, dental care, and mental health services.\n\nThe school-based health program has developed successful partnerships with many Muskegon County School districts. The Muskegon Teen Health Center and Oakridge Teen Health Center serve as an anchor for kids, residents, neighborhoods, and schools. Additionally, virtual mental health services are offered to those districts without a program located there; as well as during the summer when school is out.\n\nHackley Community Care’s Teen Health Centers at Muskegon High School (MTHC) and Oakridge Middle School (OTHC) provide medical, mental health, and dental services to children ages 5 to 21. Services are available to students from all school districts.\n\nBoth locations can serve as a patient’s primary care provider (PCP) or we can coordinate services with outside PCP’s.\n\n**We encourage parents to complete and sign a consent form for students to be seen at the Teen Health Centers. **\n\n(Hours at both Teen Health Centers are subject to change during the summer.)\n\nSigned parental consent is required for your child to receive most services.\n\nWe coordinate all of our services with your child’s primary care provider to manage your child’s health while they are at school. We follow all applicable federal and state laws for minor consent for treatment.\n\nFor a detailed list of school sites, please contact us.\n\nIf you are interested in receiving services for your child offered through our school-based health programs, or need assistance with Medicaid enrollment, please contact one of the Teen Health Centers for additional information.\n\nAll insurances, Medicaid plans, and Delta Dental Healthy Kids are accepted and we will serve the patient if they are uninsured. We will work with each individual to secure insurance, apply for Medicaid, or our Sliding Fee Scale Program. Some sites are grant-funded and will not apply co-pays.\n\nIf you are experiencing a mental health crisis and would like to speak to a person on the state mental health hotline, please call or text 988.\n\nYou can also chat with someone at 988LIFELINE.ORG.\n\nThis service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week."
