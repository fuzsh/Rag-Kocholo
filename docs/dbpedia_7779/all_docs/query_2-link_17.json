        "text": "Hackley School is an independent, college-preparatory, non-sectarian K-12 day school in Tarrytown, New York. It also offers 5-day boarding for students grades 9-12. Founded in 1899, it became co-educational in 1970.\n\nHackley believes that students will grow in character and responsibility by participating in structured activity that serves the needs of people outside the spheres of home and school. By committing their energy, time, and imagination to serving those needs, students can experience the satisfaction of helping others and can gain some appreciation of the complexity and concerns of the larger community.\n\nHackley students are expected to be good citizens. The School shares with its parent community an active commitment to character development as well as academic excellence. Students are encouraged to have respect for and to act responsibly toward themselves and others. The School strives to provide an overall environment that supports the development of virtuous qualities and good personal habits.\n\nHackley students are expected to go beyond mere observance of the rules and to strive to make Hackley a civilized community where courtesy, kindness, and forbearance reign, and incivility and intolerance are shunned."
