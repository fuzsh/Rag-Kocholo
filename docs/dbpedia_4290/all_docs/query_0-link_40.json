        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis paper presents the allometric relation of the body weight to the body size of the workers of Formica japonica MOTSCHULSKY in various seasons, and an allometric analysis of their fluctuation of corpulency. Even though there was weak correlation between body weight and head width in summer, two rows of the mode on the correlation diagram were found, being expressed by the formula Y=aX^3 where Y is the live or dry weight, X is the head width and a is the index of corpulency. The row shown by the corpulent type individuals of the workers was seen in all seasons, but that shown by the lean type was not seen in the hibernating colonies. The worker working on the ground in winter showed the row of the lean type. As'a'in the formula is independent of the body size, the body weight can be divided into two component items, the one representing the weight depending on the body size and the other representing the factor depending on the corpulency. The ratio of dry weight to live weight of the ant body is also independent of the body size. This ratio in the summer workers is smaller than that in the hibernating ones ; the difference being about 10%."
