Introduction\n\nLachninae Herrich-Schaeffer, 1854 are among the most interesting aphids due to their diverse abilities to feed on woody and green parts of deciduous and conifer trees and shrubs [1]. They are also one of the most numerous subfamilies within Aphididae, with about 420 valid species [2]. Representatives of this subfamily are characterised by body and appendages densely covered with setae, a short terminal process of the last antennal segment, very low siphunculi on setose sclerites, three rudimentary gonapophyses, and alatae often with pigmented wings [3,4,5,6,7].\n\nTuberolachnini Oestlund, 1942 are one of the five recognised tribes within the Lachninae [1,8], and five rather poorly known genera have been listed within this group: Neonippolachnus Shinji, 1924; Nippolachnus Matsumura, 1917, Pyrolachnus Basu and Hille Ris Lambers, 1968, Sinolachnus Hille Ris Lambers, 1956; and Tuberolachnus Mordvilko, 1909, representatives of which are associated with Betula, woody Rosaceae, Elaeagnus, and Salix [9,10]. In the first molecular phylogeny study of Lachninae, Normark [8] pointed out that specimens of Tuberolachnus salignus and Nippolachnus piri formed an independent, sister clade to Tramini and indicated the presence of more than three tribes within the subfamily. Later, Chen et al. [1] confirmed Normark’s results and added representatives of Pyrolachnus, which were resolved as a sister group to Nippolachnus. Neonippolachnus and Sinolachnus (placed previously in Lachnini)—the least known genera—have so far not been included in a molecular phylogenetic study and were arbitrarily transferred by Chen et al. [1] to Tuberolachnini. Although Normark’s [8] and Chen’s et al. [1] results give a good overview on the relationships of tribes within the subfamily, there are still some uncertainties, taxonomical problems, and confusions within some genera and species, in particular for the poorly known taxa [10,11,12,13]. Recently, Kanturski et al. [14] listed several critical differences between Sinolachnus and other Tuberolachnini genera and transferred the genus to the tribe Tramini.\n\nMembers of the genus Nippolachnus are easy to recognise due to the very pale, delicate, and unsclerotised apterous viviparous females and characteristic large rhinaria, abdominal sclerotisation, and hyaline wings in alate viviparous females. They can also be distinguished from other deciduous-feeding Lachninae by their feeding on leaves, never on woody parts. They occur in East and Southeast Asia, mainly in China, India, Japan, Korea, the Russian Far East, and Taiwan [7,10].\n\nNippolachnus was established as a new genus by Matsumura [15] for the type species N. piri, collected on Pyrus lindleyi (=Pyrus sinensis) in Japan. At the same time, van der Goot [16] described Lachnus himalayensis from material received from the Indian Museum, collected in Darjeeling. The third species, N. micromeli Shinji, 1924, was quite briefly described again from Japan by Shinji [17]. Due to the insufficient description and the lack of type material, that species was synonymised with the type species [4,18,19]. Basu and Hille Ris Lambers [20] described two more species associated with Eriobotrya in West Bengal, N. bengalensis and N. eriobotryae, and the latter was briefly treated as a synonym of N. himalayensis [18]. The last species, N. xitianmushanus, was described from China [21] and is treated as a synonym of N. piri [10,11,19].\n\nShinji [17], besides the description of N. micromeli, also gave a description of a new genus—Neonippolachnus—with the type species N. betulae collected from Betula sp. From the extremely brief description, no information can be extracted beyond the pigmentation of the aphids and similarities to other taxa. After the description, the genus and species were never collected again, despite many years of aphidological tradition and the work of excellent aphidologists in Japan. Furthermore, as no material of Shinji exists, Neonippolachnus remains a “ghost taxon”.\n\nRecently, Kanturski et al. [13] restored the species status of N. micromeli during the morphological and molecular investigations of N. piri complex on different host plants in Japan and Korea. The authors also provided the first SEM morphological study of representatives of viviparous generations of Nippolachnus and pointed out that despite the lack of ocular tubercle, a reduced or residual triommatidium can be found in both morphs under the compound eyes. Until then, Nippolachnus was treated as a unique genus within Lachninae due to the lack of ocular tubercles and triommatidia [4,7].\n\nAs some of the species were described briefly without figures, or the ones presented do not show sufficient differences, we decided to revise the genus to present detailed descriptions and figures of all available morphs of the Nippolachnus species. Additionally, we present the first phylogenetic analysis to clarify the relationships within the genus, especially to determine the position of N. himalayensis as standing apart from the rest of the species in some important features. We describe the hitherto unknown fundatrix of N. piri and N. micromeli, apterous viviparous female N. xitianmushanus, and representatives of the sexual generation (oviparous females and alate males) of N. micromeli and N. piri. As a result of detailed morphological comparison, three new species from China, India, and Indonesia are described and illustrated. We discuss the similarities and differences between species as well as the taxonomic status of Neonippolachnus.\n\nThis paper is part of ongoing research on the revision and phylogeny of the tribe Tuberolachnini.\n\n2.

Scanning Electron Microscopy\n\nSpecimens for SEM analyses were preserved in 70% ethanol for several days. From ethanol, the specimens were transferred to 6% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) solution in 70% ethanol and left for 24 h. Dehydration was accomplished through an ethanol series of 80%, 90%, 96% and two changes of absolute ethanol for 10 min each. Absolute ethanol dehydrated specimens were treated with chloroform for 24 h. Dehydrated and cleaned samples were dried using the Leica EM CPD 300 auto-critical point dryer (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria). Dry samples were mounted on aluminium stubs with double-sided adhesive carbon tape and sputter-coated with a 30 nm gold layer in a Quorum 150 T ES Plus sputter coater (Quorum Technologies Ltd., Laughton, East Sussex, UK). The specimens were imaged by the Hitachi SU8010 field emission scanning electron microscope FESEM (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at 7 and 10 kV accelerating voltage with a secondary electron detector (ESD). Final figure processing was done using Photoscape 3.7 (photoscape.org) and IrfanView 64 (irfanview.com).\n\n2.3. Phylogenetic Analysis\n\n2.3.1. Taxon Sampling and Outgroup for Phylogenetic Analyses\n\nWe used all currently recognised tribes from the subfamily Lachninae in phylogenetic analyses. Since our target group was the genus Nippolachnus, we included all described species, three putative new species, and closely related representatives of the genera Pyrolachnus and Tuberolachnus belonging to the same tribe—Tuberolachnini. Species from the subfamilies Aphidinae, Calaphidinae, and Thelaxinae were used as outgroups.\n\n2.3.2. Morphological Characters\n\nWe analysed all eight species belonging to Nippolachnus as well as 33 additional species, of which 30 are Lachninae representatives of all known tribes and genera and three species are outgroups. The morphological matrix was constructed in Mesquite v3.5 [22] based on 122 characters (114 morphological and 8 biological) of apterous and alate viviparous females. Unknown character states were coded using ‘?’, and inapplicable states as ‘–’. The list of characters is provided in Supplementary Materials File S1. The nexus file containing the complete character matrix is available as Supplementary Materials File S2.\n\n2.3.3. Phylogenetic Analyses\n\nThe morphological matrix for the total number of taxa under study (41) was analysed using Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML). The data were analysed as a single partition and in the case of BI, the Mkv model [23] and default settings were chosen a priori. Bayesian analysis was performed using MrBayes ver. 3.2.6 [24] running on CIPRES Science Gateway ver. 3.3 [25]. The analysis used four chains (one cold and three heated) and two runs of 10 million generations with default prior settings, except for the temperature, which was set to ‘temp = 0.08’ for better mixing. A script for the combined analysis in MrBayes is given in Supplementary Materials File S3. The convergence of both runs was assessed in Tracer ver. 1.7.1 [26], as well as by the examination of potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) values and average standard deviation of split frequencies in the MrBayes output. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was performed using IQ-TREE ver. 2.1.4 [27]. Node support was evaluated by 10 000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates (UFB) [28] (command line: iqtree2 -s matrix.nex -st MORPH -B 10,000 -nt AUTO -bnni). Trees were examined in FigTree ver. 1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) and later edited and annotated in Adobe Illustrator 2023. Clade support was estimated by BI posterior probability (PP) and ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFB) in ML. Nodes with PP > 0.80 and UFB > 90 were considered well supported, nodes with PP = 0.70–0.80 and UFB = 85–90 were considered to be weakly supported, and nodes with PP < 0.70 and UFB < 85 were considered unsupported.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Phylogenetic Analyses\n\nFor BI analysis, all independent Markov chains converged on the same stationary distribution as visualised in Tracer, and both combined and individual traces were inspected. The effective sample size (ESS) values were greater than 200 for all parameters, indicating good mixing of the chains. The tree topology presented in Figure 1 is a result of maximum likelihood analysis with support values of both BI and ML.\n\nThe topologies of trees obtained from BI and ML analyses are similar for most shallower level clades. However, in the case of the BI tree (Supplementary Materials File S4), many clades were not resolved at a deeper level. Only two (Eulachnini and Stomaphidini) out of five analysed tribes were recovered as monophyletic. However, given the support value for both analyses, their phylogenetic position was not determined. Our targeted tribe Tuberolachnini was resolved in the ML tree in three places. The first clade contains all species of the genus Tuberolachnus, sister to three species of the genus Pyrolachnus, but this result was unsupported in both analyses. In the ML result, all these taxa were recovered as sister to Lachnus tatakaensis Takahashi, 1937 with no support. The second part of Tuberolachnini contains only Pyrolachnus imbricatus nipponicus, which in both analyses were resolved as sister to Sinolachnus yushanensis from the tribe Tramini with good support (UFB = 94, BI = 1). These two taxa are resolved as sister to the third part of the tribe Tuberolachnini, which contains all representatives of the genus Nippolachnus, including three new species. In both analyses, Nippolachnus himalayensis was resolved as sister to all other species of this genus with weak and good support (UFB = 89, BI = 0.99). Based on the results of phylogenetic analyses and morphological comparison, we describe three new species in the genus Nippolachnus—N. chakrabartii sp. nov., N. malayaensis sp. nov., and N. sinensis sp. nov.—and decide to move Nippolachnus himalayensis to the separate, newly established genus Indolachnus gen. nov.\n\nFigure 2.

Notes of the SEM Morphology of Sexual Generation (Oviparous Female and Alate Male) of Nippolachnus Based on the Type Species N. piri\n\nAs Kanturski et al. [13] performed detailed SEM studies on the viviparous generations (apterous and alate viviparous females) of N. piri and N. micromeli, here, we focused on the so far unknown sexual generations in this genus—oviparous females and males. In general, sexual generation morphs are similar to the viviparous generations—oviparous females to apterous viviparous females and alate males to alate viviparous females. Oviparae have almost the same shape as the viviparous females, with a slightly enlarged perianal area (Figure 5a,b). The alate male is characterised by a strongly sclerotised thorax and clearly visible genitalia (Figure 5c). In both sexes, the compound eyes are well developed, surrounded by crescent-shaped collars (Figure 5d–f). Triommatidia are present and are lying on the back, outside the compound eyes (Figure 5h,i,k). They are not placed on an ocular tubercle and are much more difficult to find in the oviparous female than in the male (Figure 5g,k). Moreover, the head of the male is characterised by three quite well-developed and large ocelli (Figure 5f,j). Siphunculi are low but well developed and sclerotised, and densely covered with long, fine, pointed setae (Figure 5l,m). The perianal area of the oviparous females is densely covered with long, fine, pointed setae. The anal plate is large, crescent-shaped from the dorsal view, and very flat from the back (Figure 5n,o). In the male, the perianal area is limited to dorsal abdominal segments and visible cauda (Figure 5p), whereas in the oviparous female, the perianal structures are well visible (Figure 5o). The dorsal side of the body of both sexes is densely covered with numerous long, very fine, pointed setae with very well-developed and protuberant sockets (Figure 5q,r). Both sexes have a very similar morphology of mouthparts and sensilla. The labrum is densely covered with long, fine, pointed trichoid sensilla (Figure 6a). The ultimate rostral segments (RIV + RV) are slender and the fifth segment is well separated (Figure 6b). The ultimate rostral segments bear three kinds of sensilla: one pair of type II basiconic sensilla on the ventral proximal part of RIV, trichoid sensilla along the segment, and type III basiconic sensilla on the distal part of the last segment (Figure 6c). The trichoid sensilla are very similar to those on the antennae and other appendages—long, tubular, very fine, especially in the apical part, and pointed (Figure 6d). They have oval, well-developed, and flexible sockets (Figure 6e). Type II basiconic sensilla extend over the border between the segments (Figure 6f), are about 15–20 μm long, have hemispherical and flexible sockets, and their apices are rounded (Figure 6g,h). The distal end of RIV bears three pairs of trichoid sensilla (primary setae) (Figure 6i). The last rostral segment bears seven pairs of long, rigid type III basiconic sensilla, of which the fifth are much shorter than the others (Figure 6j,k). The long type III basiconic sensilla are about 17–18 μm in length, arise from inflexible sockets, and have well-developed moulting pores (Figure 6l,m). The short type III basiconic sensilla are about 3–4 μm long and lie much deeper in the cuticular cavities (Figure 6n,o).\n\n3.2.1. Morphology of Oviparous Female N. piri\n\nAs mentioned above, the morphology of the oviparous female resembles that of the apterous viviparous female and will be treated separately for some morphological characters together with the alate male (resembling the alate viviparous female’s features). The oviparous female’s antennae are shorter and bear fewer sensilla, of which the majority are characteristically very long trichoid sensilla on all antennal segments (Figure 7a). On the dorsal side of pedicel one, slightly protuberant campaniform sensillum can be found near the segment edge (Figure 7b). The campaniform sensillum is rounded, with both the collar and cap being rounded. The diameter of the sensillum is about 10 μm, and that of the cap about 4 μm; the cap has a small pore, which is not located centrally (Figure 7d). On the ventral side of the pedicel, three rhinariola were found (Figure 7c). Their morphological features differ, and we propose to divide them into two descriptive types: rhinariolum type I and rhinariolum type II. Rhinariolum type I is exposed, lying in a rounded shallow cuticle cavity, about 2.5 μm in diameter (Figure 7f). The type I rhinariolum sense peg is 3–4 μm long, and is divided into 2–3 smooth and longer projections (Figure 7g). The type II rhinariolum, in contrast, lies deep in the cuticle, and is characterised by more (4–5) and shorter projections, which in addition bear spherical protrusions (Figure 7e,f). Additionally, this type of rhinariolum has been observed as a single peg (Figure 7e) and as double sensilla separated by a transverse cuticular diaphragm (Figure 7h). The opening of the single type II rhinariolum is about 2.3 μm in diameter and in the case of the double type, the opening is oval, 4.10–4.20 μm long, and 2.20–2.60 μm wide. As mentioned above, all segments are covered with numerous very long, tubular, fine, pointed type I trichoid sensilla (Figure 7i) with well-developed sockets, which are rounded from the dorsal view and trapezoid from the lateral view (Figure 7j). On ANT V, besides type I trichoid sensilla, one large multiporous placoid sensillum (primary rhinarium) can be noted on the distal part of the segment (Figure 7k). The sensillum is rather flat, slightly oval or rounded, 51–52 μm long, and 27–28 μm wide. The sensillum surface is densely covered with numerous slightly rounded or oval pores, 65–75 per 1 μm2 (Figure 7l). The last antennal segment is characterised by the most diverse sensilla (Figure 7m). On the border of the basal part and the terminal process, a large, protuberant multiporous placoid sensillum is present and its apical end designates the beginning of the terminal process. The large, multiporous placoid sensillum (major rhinarium) is about 42–43 μm long and 20–23 μm wide. On the lateral side of the segment (in relation to the side marked by the placoid sensillum), six accessory rhinaria can be found, representing two general types of sensilla. Small placoid sensilla lie in polar positions and one of them lies on the distal part of the base (the rest are moved to the terminal process). Between small multiporous placoid sensilla, four sunken coeloconic sensilla can be found, of which two are of type I and two of type II. The very apical part of the terminal process bears type II trichoid sensilla (Figure 7n). Small multiporous placoid sensilla on ANT VI, which are treated as accessory rhinaria, are mushroom-shaped with an always narrow stem and slightly flat, wide upper part, which is 5–6 μm long and 4.50–5.50 μm wide. They lie in a broad and shallow cuticular cavity and are surrounded by a well-developed cuticular collar (Figure 7o). Type I sunken coeloconic sensilla are exposed and surrounded by a cuticular collar similar to placoid sensilla. They are characterised by numerous (16–18) long projections, some of which have capitate apices (Figure 7p). Type II trichoid sensilla are divided into two groups of three and two (Figure 7q), are rather rigid, 11–12 μm long, and are characterised by scattered apices (Figure 7r).\n\nOn the inner side of the hind femora, six campaniform sensilla of two sizes can be found (Figure 8a). The campaniform sensilla on the femora are similar to that on the pedicel but more often their collar is not uniform and a small groove on its lateral side can be noted (Figure 8b). Hind femora and hind tibiae are densely covered with trichoid sensilla, which are also similar to those on the antennal segments (Figure 8c,d,f), but much finer in the distal parts, which makes them curved (Figure 8e). The sensilla are tubular, arise from well-developed and movable sockets with, in some cases, visible moulting pores (Figure 8g,h). The hind tibia of the oviparous females bear clearly visible, rounded or slightly oval scent plaques (Figure 8i,j). The scent plaques are, moreover, slightly protuberant, about 14–15 μm in diameter, and are characterised by clearly visible, rounded to spindle-shaped pores (Figure 8k,l), 5–6 per 1 μm2. Hind tarsi are of typical shape with fine, curved, pointed setae (Figure 8m). On the first segment of the hind tarsus, one peg-like sensillum can be found besides much longer and flexible trichoid sensilla (Figure 8n,o). Parempodia are barely visible and residual, in the form of very low cones of rounded apices (Figure 8p,q).\n\n3.2.2. Morphology of Alate male N. piri\n\nThe antennae of the male are characterised by numerous long, fine, pointed type I trichoid sensilla on all segments. The pedicel, like that of the oviparous female, bears a campaniform sensillum and (type I and type II) rhinariola (Figure 9a and Figure 10a). Flagellar segments (ANT III, IV, V and VI) bear numerous small, rounded secondary rhinaria (small multiporous placoid sensilla) uniformly distributed over the entire length and surface of each segment (Figure 9b). Antennal segment V besides small multiporous placoid sensilla bears quite a large multiporous placoid sensillum on the distal part (Figure 9c). The last antennal segment bears small multiporous placoid sensilla (secondary rhinaria), primary rhinaria in the form of one large multiporous placoid sensillum (major rhinarium), two small mushroom-shaped placoid multiporous sensilla (accessory rhinaria), and four sunken coeloconic sensilla, two of type I and two of type II (accessory rhinaria). On the apical part of terminal process type II, trichoid sensilla can be found (Figure 9d).\n\nType I trichoid sensilla are long and tubular, arising from rounded and flexible sockets (Figure 10b,c). Small multiporous placoid sensilla (secondary rhinaria) are protuberant, mostly rounded or oval, 11–12 μm long, and 9–10 μm wide (Figure 10d). Each sensillum is surrounded by a well-developed sclerotic collar and clearly visible porous membrane (Figure 10e,f). Pores of the small multiporous placoid sensilla are numerous, rounded or elongated, and about 15–20 per μm2 (Figure 10g). The big multiporous placoid sensillum is enlarged, oval, 43–45 μm long, and 38–42 μm wide. In its porous membrane, many pores are elongated, 25–30 per μm2 (Figure 10h,i). Accessory rhinaria (small multiporous placoid sensilla and coeloconic sensilla) on ANT VI are surrounded by clearly visible sclerotic collars (Figure 10j). Small multiporous placoid sensilla on ANT VI are mushroom-shaped, oval, about 5 μm long, and about 3 μm wide (Figure 10k). Type I sunken coeloconic sensilla are exposed, lying in a flat cavity, and are characterised by 12–14 long projections (Figure 10l). Type II trichoid sensilla are stiff, tubular, tapering in the apical part with semi-spherical sockets (Figure 10m,n) and scattered apices (Figure 10o).\n\nFigure 10.

The wing membrane is covered with more or less concentrated scale-like elements, which are most numerous on the pterostigma (Figure 11c) and rarer in the other parts of the wing (Figure 11d). The basal part of the wing near the articulation bears evidently protuberant campaniform sensilla, which are more similar to those on the trochanter and femur than the one on the antennal pedicel (Figure 11e). The sensillum is slightly asymmetric and the collar groove is clearly visible (Figure 11f). The wing membrane near the wing articulation is, moreover, densely covered with numerous minute spherical structures (Figure 11g,h). Besides campaniform sensilla on the wing basal part, a few trichoid sensilla have been found along the pterostigma proximal line (Figure 11i). The sensilla are tubular, fine, and with pointed apices and are characterised by hemispherical, rounded, and flexible sockets (Figure 11j). The claval area of the hind wings is characterised by more robust scale-like elements and seven long rolled up hamuli (Figure 11k,l). Campaniform sensilla can also be found on the legs, trochanter, and femora. The hind trochanter besides trichoid sensilla bears, moreover, two campaniform sensilla and one shorter and stiffer sensillum on the ventral side, which may be a chaetic sensillum. Near the trochantro-femoral suture, seven campaniform sensilla may be found—six on the inner side and one on the much outer and dorsal side (Figure 11m). The chaetic-like sensillum is about 20 μm long and arises from a flexible socket (Figure 11n). Larger campaniform sensilla (8–9 μm) are characterised by a more robust collar, while in the smaller ones (4–5 μm), the collar is slimmer. In sensilla of both sizes, the pore lies in the centre of the cap (Figure 11o,p). The legs are densely covered with trichoid sensilla, which are very long, fine, and pointed, and arise from their flexible sockets at an acute angle (Figure 11q,r). In high magnification (about 50K), their apices turn out to be rounded (Figure 11s). Hind tarsi are covered with similar trichoid sensilla; on the first tarsal segment, one peg-like sensillum can be found (Figure 11t,u), and on the dorsal proximal part of the HT II flat, campaniform sensilla are visible (Figure 11v). Parempodia like in the oviparous female are barely visible and residual (Figure 11w,x).\n\nThe perianal area structures of the male, especially the cauda, anal plate, and genitalia, are extremely setose (Figure 12a). The parameres are robust and sclerotised, lie laterally to the basal part of the phallus and anal plate, and the lower area is more densely covered, with probably trichoid sensilla, than the upper area (Figure 12b,c). The trichoid sensilla on the parameres have similar properties to those on the rest of the body—they are long, tubular, arise from flexible sockets, and have pointed apices (Figure 12d,e). In contrast, the area of the basal part of the phallus and the proximal part of the aedeagus is covered with many short sensilla which may be chaetic sensilla (Figure 12f). They are irregularly distributed on the lateral sides, are shorter, and their apices are more rounded (Figure 12g–i), while from the rear side, they are longer, seem to be stiffer, and are also evidently more pointed (Figure 12j–l). Almost all of them arise from flexible sockets.\n\nFigure 11.

Representatives of the genus Nippolachnus are easily recognisable from other Tuberolachnini and Lachninae genera. In life, apterous viviparous females are oval, pale green or completely pale without visible sclerotisation, and very densely covered with long, hair-like, fine, pointed, unpigmented setae. Alate viviparous females are characterised by characteristic patterns of sclerotisation on the abdomen and membranous parts covered in wax. All morphs feed on the leaves of their host plants, never on woody parts. In mounted specimens, besides the mentioned characters, representatives of this genus are characterised by the absence of an ocular tubercle, but the residual triommatidium is located under the compound eyes. Ultimate rostral segments are wider at the proximal part. The distal part of URS is blunt with blunt, button-shaped RV. Siphuncular sclerites are unpigmented. The first segments of the tarsi have 1-1-1 sense pegs.\n\nDescription.\n\nApterous viviparous females. Body slender, very delicate, and pale with only yellow or dusky pigmented hind legs. Body densely covered with long, very fine, pointed, unpigmented setae. Head with visible epicranial suture. Antennae six-segmented, sometimes with one small secondary rhinarium on ANT III and IV. Antennal setae always much longer than the width of segments. Primary rhinaria without sclerotised rims. Accessory rhinaria on ANT VI located on the PT (except N. bengalensis, where the rhinaria are on the BASE) and also often moved to the lateral side of the segment in relation to the major rhinarium. Terminal process imbricated, poorly separated from BASE without short, rigid subapical setae, and, except N. bengalensis, with long fine setae like those on BASE. Head and thorax pale, membranous, without distinct border between the tagmas. Sclerotised part of rostrum groove poorly developed, pale, not more than 0.60 mm. Mesosternal furca delicate, pale, almost separated, fused only by a very thin base without a stem. In some species legs yellow with dusky hind tibiae. Setae on legs long, fine and pointed, longer than the width of tibiae. First segments of tarsi with dorsal length much shorter than the basal length. Abdomen membranous, pale. Siphunculi on low, delicate, and unpigmented and hardly visible sclerites with rather large rounded pores. Genital and anal plates very poorly sclerotised, unpigmented, hardly visible. Cauda rounded.\n\nAlate viviparous females. In life, brownish green to dark brown (especially head and thorax) with dusky to brownish legs. In mounted specimens, head and thorax strongly sclerotised, light brown to brown. Body densely covered with long, fine, pointed, unpigmented setae. Head with epicranial suture and large, distinct compound eyes without ocular tubercles, and residual triommatidia located under the compound eyes. Antennae short, with large primary and secondary rhinaria. Secondary rhinaria on ANT III, IV, and V rather rounded, protuberant, almost as wide as the width of segments, in one row on the entire length of the segment. Primary rhinaria oval, larger than the width of segments. Fore wings hyaline. Pterostigma yellow or light brown, short and slightly blunt. Rs bent in the middle of its length, running to the wing apex. Media once-branched except N. bengalensis, in which media may be simple or once-branched. Cubital veins straight, arising separately. Legs usually pigmented. Abdomen with characteristic patterns of sclerotisation, in form of differently developed spino-pleural patch on ABD IV–V, pleural patches on ABD II–III, and marginal plates on ABD I–V. Additionally, cross-bars on ABD VI–VII may be present. Siphunculi on clearly visible, pigmented sclerites.\n\n3.3.1.

This species is similar in the pigmentation of the legs of apterous viviparous females to N. piri and N. chakrabartii sp. nov., but may be easily distinguished from all other species in the genus Nippolachnus by the lack of long, fine setae on the PT. Alate viviparous females may be distinguished from other morphs by antennae with smaller secondary rhinaria and hardly developed sclerotisation on abdomen.\n\nHost plants. Eriobotrya dubia, Photinia arguta. Mandal et al. [30] also reported this species from Quercus sp. It is most likely that the records on Pyrus communis, P. pashia should refer to N. chakrabartii sp. nov.\n\nDistribution. India: Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, West Bengal.

In the pigmentation of hind tibiae, the new species is similar to N. bengalensis and N. piri. Apterous viviparous females of the new species can be easily distinguished from both species first of all by the pigmentation of the legs: (1) fore and middle tibiae with darker apical parts (fore and middle tibiae uniformly pigmented in N. bengalensis and N. piri), (2) hind femora with brown distal part (hind femora uniformly pigmented). From N. bengalensis, apterae may be additionally distinguished by (1) 1–2 long setae on the PT (PT of N. bengalensis without long setae), (2) URS with 18 accessory setae (8–10 accessory setae in N. bengalensis), (3) PT base 0.45–0.54 (0.27–0.32 in N. bengalensis), (4) URS/ANT III 0.61–0.68 (0.37–0.40 in N. bengalensis). Additionally, apterae of N. chakrabartii sp. nov. differ from those of N. piri in having the following: (1) a smaller number of PT long setae—1–2 (3–4 in N. piri); (2) ANT V/ANT III 0.57–0.60 (0.47–0.56 in N. piri); (3) LS/BD III 3.00–3.66 (4.07–7.50 in N. piri); (4) HT I basal length/H I dorsal length 4.00–4.50 (1.60–2.00 in N. piri). Alate viviparous females of the new species together with the alatae of N. bengalensis differ from those of the other species in having the following: unbranched media of fore wings (once-branched in other Nippolachnus and twice-branched in Indolachnus); secondary rhinaria as wide as or narrower than half the segment width (secondary rhinaria much wider than half the width of the segment); and poorly developed spinal abdominal sclerotisation. The alate viviparous females of the new species differ from those of N. bengalensis in having the following: (1) much darker and pigmentation broader pigmentation of III FEMORAE (only slightly darker very distal ends in N. bengalensis), (2) dark brown 1/3 distal end of III TIBIAE (slightly darker very distal ends in N. bengalensis), (3) spinal abdominal sclerotisation on ABD III-V (spinal abdominal sclerotisation only on ABD III-IV in N. bengalensis), (4) HW/ANT 0.68–0.69 (0.54–0.55 in N. bengalensis), (5) ANT VI/ANT III 0.59–0.69 (0.40–0.46 in N. bengalensis).\n\nEtymology. We have the pleasure of naming the new species to honour the outstanding Indian aphidologist Professor Samiran Chakrabarti, our colleague and friend, and for many years the Head of the Department of Zoology, University of Kalyani, India.\n\nHost plants. The species has been collected from an unidentified species of Pyrus tree.\n\nDistribution.

Apterous viviparous females of Nippolachnus malayaensis sp. nov. are most similar to N. sinensis sp. nov. in having a very pale body and appendages in which both species differ from N. bengalensis and N. chakrabartii sp. nov. Both species differ, moreover, in the chaetotaxy of ANT BASE (16–17), URS (15–16), and ABD VIII (36–42) from N. micromeli, N. piri, and N. xitianmushanus, in which the values of those characters are 20–27, 18–25, and 45–52, respectively. Nippolachnus malayaensis sp. nov. can be easily distinguished from N. sinensis sp. nov. by the following differences: (1) HW/ANT 0.44–0.48 (0.62–0.63 in N. sinensis sp. nov.), (2) ANT VI/ANT III 0.66–0.81 (0.57–0.63 in N. sinensis sp. nov.), (3) URS/ANT III 0.39–0.46 (0.51–0.57), (4) URS/ANT VI 0.59–0.66 (0.81–1.00 in N. sinensis sp. nov.), (5) HT II/ANT III 0.65–0.66 (0.72–0.75 in N. sinensis), (6) HT II/ANT VI 0.80–1.00 (1.13–1.31 in N. sinensis sp. nov.), (7) HT I basal length/HT I dorsal length 1.20–1.50 (2.05–2.33 in N. sinensis sp. nov.).\n\nEtymology.

In pigmentation of mounted specimens, very pale apterous viviparous females of N. micromeli are similar to N. malayaensis sp. nov. and N. sinensis sp. nov. Both new species are characterised by almost pigmentless appendages (especially legs), in which they differ from N. micromeli (and other species in which the legs are yellow or with brown distal ends). Additionally, N. micromeli differs from the new species in the chaetotaxy of ANT VI BASE (20–22 setae), URS (20–25), and ABD VIII (45–50), which in N. malayaensis sp. nov. and N. sinensis sp. nov. have 16–21, 14–16, and 36–42 setae, respectively. The large number of setae of remaining body parts makes N. micromeli similar to N. piri and N. xitianmushanus together with darker pigmented distal ends of tibiae. N. micromeli differs from both species in the following: (1) unpigmented ANT VI (pigmented in N. piri and N. xitianmushanus); (2) 20–22 basal setae (25–27 in N. piri and N. xitianmushanus); (3) 4–6 long setae on PT (3–4 in N. piri and N. xitianmushanus). Apterous viviparous females of N. micromeli differ from those of N. piri additionally by having a higher ratio of HT I basal to HT I dorsal length, 2.00–3.50 (1.60–2.00 in N. piri), and from those of N. xitianmushanus by ANT IV/ANT V 0.50–0.66 (0.73–0.91 in the latter). Alate viviparous females can be easily distinguished by abdominal sclerotisation with spinal and spino-pleural cross-bars on ABD VI and VII, which are absent in the known alatae of the other species.\n\nHost plants. Rhaphiolepis indica, R. umbellata, Sorbus alnifolia, Sorbus sp. Ulmus davidiana var. japonica.\n\nBiology. In the Korean Peninsula, the first representatives of this species—fundatrices and first instar fundatrigeniae—were observed in mid-May on R. indica var. umbellata (Figure 4a) and with some time, each observed colony exhibited the presence of the fundatrix and alatoid nymphs without apterous female larvae. From the beginning of the colonies’ activity, the aphids were attended by Crematogaster matsumurai ants (Figure 4e). In the autumn, the colonies consisted of alate viviparous females, oviparous females, and male nymphs. In late October, alate viviparous females gave birth to the sexual generation, and after mating, the oviparous females laid eggs in a circular and disordered pattern around the main vein on the undersides of the host plant where they overwinter.\n\nDistribution. This species is known from Japan and the Korean Peninsula.\n\nRemarks. For a long time, Nippolachnus micromeli has been treated as a synonym of N. piri. Kanturski et al. [13] performed detailed morphological analyses supported by molecular studies and restored N. micromeli as a separate species. All previous records of N. piri from the above-mentioned host plants should be referred to N. micromeli.\n\nNippolachnus piri Matsumura, 1917\n\nMatsumura, 1917 [15], p. 382\n\nFundatrix—description\n\nColour: in life, head light brown.

Apterous viviparous females of N. piri are similar to N. bengalensis, N. chakrabartii sp. nov. and N. xitianmushanus in the pigmentation of the legs, in which they differ from the other apterae, which have colourless or only slightly pigmented very distal ends of antennae, tibiae, and tarsi. Apterae of N. piri can be easily distinguished from N. bengalensis by the much darker distal area of hind tibiae and dark hind tarsi (only slightly darker very distal apices of hind tibiae and yellow tarsi in N. bengalensis). From N. chakrabartii sp. nov., N. piri apterae differ in the lack of dark pigment in the distal part of the hind femora (femora with dark distal patches in N. chakrabartii sp. nov.), and ANT V and VI with darker apical halves (ANT IV-VI uniformly brown in N. chakrabartii sp. nov.). Nippolachnus piri apterae differ from those in N. xitianmushanus as follows: (1) only ANT VI distal part pigmented (brown pigmented distal part of ANT IV and V and brown ANT VI in N. xitianmushanus); (2) 8–9 HT I setae (11–12 in N. xitianmushanus); (3) ANT VI/ANT III 0.52–0.60 (0.61–0.66 in N. xitianmushanus). Alate viviparous females of N. piri are most similar to N. sinensis sp. nov. and N. xitianmushanus. The three species differ from the other species in abdominal sclerotisation (poorly developed in N. bengalensis and N. chakrabartii sp. nov. and with sclerotised cross-bars on ABD VI and VII in N. micromeli). Alatae of N. piri differ from those of N. sinensis sp. nov. in having much more developed spino-pleural sclerotisation on ABD III–V, and ABD IV with marginal plates which are fused with SIPH sclerites (ABD III–V mostly with spinal sclerotisation and ABD IV without marginal sclerites in N. sinensis sp. nov.). Alatae of N. piri differ from those of N. xitianmushanus in having the following: (1) poorly developed marginal sclerites on ABD VI (well-developed in N. xitianmushanus); (2) more than 30 setae on ABD VIII (21–25 in N. xitianmushanus); (3) URS/ANT III 0.48–0.57 (0.58–0.63 in N. xitianmushanus).\n\nHost plants. Representatives of N. piri feed on Eriobotrya japonica, Eriobotrya sp., Pyrus communis, P. pyrifolia, Pyrus sp.\n\nBiology. In mid-May, three colonies of this species were discovered on the undersides of leaves of Eriobotrya japonica (Figure 4c). Each colony exhibited one fundatrix, alate viviparous female adults, and nymphs; however, apterous viviparous females were not observed. Two colonies were observed to be approached by Camponotus japonicus (Figure 4f), and in one colony, Pristmyrmex punctatus (Figure 4h) was observed. Considering the presence of alate viviparous female nymphs in all colonies and the absence of apterous viviparous females, it can be inferred that the second generations likely consist of alate viviparous females for host plant migration. From mid-May, alate viviparous females moved to another host plant species and began forming colonies on Pyrus pyrifolia (Figure 4b) in early to mid-June, with apterous viviparous females outnumbering them at a ratio of 9 to 1. On Pyrus, the colonies have been attended by Formica japonica (Figure 4d,g). At the turn of summer and autumn in September, Pyrus colonies of alatoid nymphs and alate viviparous females were observed. Meanwhile, in mid-October, just before returning to Eriobotrya for wintering, the number of late-born females was higher at 9 to 1 compared to June. In November, alate viviparous females that returned to the primary host produced oviparae and males through reproduction. After mating, they laid eggs in a row with consistent spacing on the undersides of leaves near the main vein of the host plant where they overwintered.\n\nDistribution. Despite a lot of historic publications in which N. piri is described as a part of the fauna (e.g., India), our studies indicate that this species is restricted to Japan, the Korean Peninsula, China (north-eastern part), Taiwan [34], and Laos [35]. This species could be present in the Russian Far East.\n\nRemarks. Otake [36] described the oviposition behaviour as well as the survival and hatching of the eggs and fate of young colonies [37,38] of N. piri on Rhaphiolepis umbellta (=R. indica). However, according to Kanturski et al. [13], this plant genus is the host plant of N. micromeli, and therefore the results of those publications should refer to this species and not N. piri.\n\nNippolachnus sinensis sp. nov.\n\nApterous viviparous female—description\n\nColour: in life, unknown.

Nippolachnus sinensis sp. nov. can be easily distinguished from N. malayaensis sp. nov. by the following differences: (1) HW/ANT 0.62–0.63 (0.44–0.48 in N. malayaensis sp. nov.), (2) ANT VI/ANT III 0.57–0.63 (0.66–0.81 in N. malayaensis sp. nov.), (3) URS/ANT III 0.51–0.57 (0.39–0.46 in N. malayaensis sp. nov.), (4) URS/ANT VI 0.81–1.00 (0.59–0.66 in N. malayaensis sp. nov.), (5) HT II/ANT III 0.72–0.75 (0.65–0.66 in N. malayaensis sp. nov.), (6) HT II/ANT VI 1.13–1.31 (0.80–1.00 in N. malayaensis sp. nov.), (7) HT I basal length/HT I dorsal length 2.05–2.33 (1.20–1.50 in N. malayaensis sp. nov.).
