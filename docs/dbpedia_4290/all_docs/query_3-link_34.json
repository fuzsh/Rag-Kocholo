        "meta_description": "There is insufficient information to identify most species of the myrmecophilous rove beetle genus Homoeusa. In this paper, after examining the type material, Homoeusa rufescens (Sharp, 1874) is redescribed in detail and its new allied species Homoeusa ovata sp. nov. is described. We also observed the behavior of these two species in the field; the behavior was similar to that reported for H. acuminata (MaÌˆrkel, 1842). A checklist of Homoeusa from the Palearctic and Nearctic is also provided.",
