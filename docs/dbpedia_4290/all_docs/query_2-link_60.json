        "text": "Overview\n\nMesic prairie is a native grassland community dominated by big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans). It occurs on loam, sandy loam or silt loam soils on level or slightly undulating glacial outwash. Historically, mesic prairie dominated large portions of the Midwest ranging from Iowa and southern Minnesota east into southwestern Michigan and northern Ohio. In Michigan, mesic prairie occurred historically in Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Cass, Branch, Calhoun, Berrien, and Van Buren Counties.\n\nRank\n\nGlobal Rank: G2 - Imperiled\n\nState Rank: S1 - Critically imperiled\n\nCounty Distribution Map\n\nLandscape Context\n\nIn Michigan, mesic prairie occurs almost exclusively on glacial outwash on nearly level to slightly undulating sites. Historically, the majority of mesic prairies occurred on the Battlecreek Outwash Plain Sub-subsection within the Kalamazoo Interlobate Subsection. This level outwash plain is the northernmost portion of the “Prairie Peninsula.” In the 1800s, mesic prairie in Michigan frequently bordered beech-maple forest (mesic southern forest) or graded into bur oak plains, which both occupied level outwash plains and grew on similarly rich soils. Where level outwash plains met end moraines and ground moraines with sandy, drier soils, mesic prairie gave way to dry-mesic prairie and oak openings, or oak woodlands (dry-mesic southern forest). Presently, the community is restricted to railroad right-of-ways, cemeteries, and other small remnants that typically border agricultural fields.\n\nSoils\n\nSoils supporting mesic prairie are very strongly acid to mildly alkaline loam or sandy loam and occasionally silt loam with moderate water-retaining capacity. The soil profile often contains a B horizon dominated by clay. Mesic prairies in Michigan occur on both mollisols, which are considered true prairie soils, and udic alfisols, which cover much of southern Lower Michigan and are considered gray to brown forest soils.\n\nNatural Processes\n\nHistorically, fire played a critical role in maintaining the open conditions of Michigan prairie and oak savanna ecosystems. In addition to suppressing the growth of woody vegetation, fire maintains species diversity by facilitating seed germination, creating microsites for seedling establishment, and releasing and recycling important plant nutrients.\n\nWhile occasional lightning strikes resulted in landscape-scale fires, Native Americans were the main source of ignition prior to European settlement. Native Americans intentionally set fires to clear brush, make land more passable, increase productivity of berry crops and agricultural fields, and improve hunting. The frequency and intensity of historical fires varied depending on the type and volume of fuel, topography, presence of natural firebreaks, and density of Native Americans. The rich soils of mesic prairie promoted very high volumes of fine fuels (e.g., grasses), which enabled fire to rapidly spread throughout the community. On the level outwash plains of southwestern Lower Michigan, annual, wind-swept fires once spread easily through the mesic prairies and bur oak plains. Carried by wind, these fires moved across the outwash plains and up slopes of end moraines and ground moraines, converting oak forests into prairies and oak openings.\n\nVegetation\n\nUnfortunately, no detailed ecological study of mesic prairie was completed in Michigan before the nearly total demise of the community. What information is available comes from written descriptions by early European settlers and studies of small prairie remnants in Michigan and Wisconsin. Mesic prairies are graminoid-dominated, forb-rich herbaceous communities. The rich loamy soils support a dense to moderately dense growth of medium to tall vegetation. The community is dominated by big bluestem, little bluestem, and Indian grass, which vary in relative dominance. Cordgrass (Spartina pectinata) is occasionally subdominant. Several other grasses, including porcupine grass (Hesperostipa spartea), prairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis, state special concern), Leiberg’s panic grass (Panicum leibergii, state threatened), and switch grass (Panicum virgatum), are important components of mesic prairie elsewhere in the Midwest and are likely to have been important components of mesic prairie in Michigan historically. Characteristic plants of Michigan’s mesic prairies include New Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus), tall coreopsis (Coreopsis tripteris), American hazelnut (Corylus americana), northern bedstraw (Galium boreale), pasture rose (Rosa carolina), prairie willow (Salix humilis), stiff goldenrod (Solidago rigida), purple meadow rue (Thalictrum dasycarpum), Culver’s root (Veronicastrum virginicum), and bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa).\n\nFor information about plant species, visit the Michigan Flora website.\n\nPlant Lists\n\nGraminoids\n\nbig bluestem (Andropogon gerardii)\n\nBicknell’s sedge (Carex bicknellii)\n\nLeiberg’s panic grass (Dichanthelium leibergii)\n\npanic grass (Dichanthelium oligosanthes)\n\nporcupine grass (Hesperostipa spartea)\n\nswitch grass (Panicum virgatum)\n\nlittle bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium)\n\nIndian grass (Sorghastrum nutans)\n\ncordgrass (Spartina pectinata)\n\nprairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis)\n\nForbs\n\nthimbleweed (Anemone cylindrica)\n\npale Indian plantain (Arnoglossum atriplicifolium)\n\nbutterfly-weed (Asclepias tuberosa)\n\nwhite false indigo (Baptisia lactea)\n\nfalse boneset (Brickellia eupatorioides)\n\nbastard-toadflax (Comandra umbellata)\n\nprairie coreopsis (Coreopsis palmata)\n\ntall coreopsis (Coreopsis tripteris)\n\nprairie tick-trefoil (Desmodium illinoense)\n\nwild yam (Dioscorea villosa)\n\nrattlesnake-master (Eryngium yuccifolium)\n\nflowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata)\n\nAmerican columbo (Frasera caroliniensis)\n\nbedstraws (Galium boreale and G. pilosum)\n\nwild geranium (Geranium maculatum)\n\nwestern sunflower (Helianthus occidentalis)\n\npale-leaved sunflower (Helianthus strumosus)\n\nalum root (Heuchera americana)\n\ntall lettuce (Lactuca canadensis)\n\nround-headed bush-clover (Lespedeza capitata)\n\nhairy bush-clover (Lespedeza hirta)\n\nhoary puccoon (Lithospermum canescens)\n\nfalse spikenard (Maianthemum racemosum)\n\nwild bergamot (Monarda fistulosa)\n\nprairie phlox (Phlox pilosa)\n\nearly buttercup (Ranunculus fascicularis)\n\nyellow coneflower (Ratibida pinnata)\n\nblack-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta)\n\nrosin weed (Silphium integrifolium)\n\nprairie dock (Silphium terebinthinaceum)\n\nstiff goldenrod (Solidago rigida)\n\nsmooth aster (Symphyotrichum laeve)\n\nprairie heart-leaved aster (Symphyotrichum oolentangiense)\n\nyellow pimpernel (Taenidia integerrima)\n\npurple meadow-rue (Thalictrum dasycarpum)\n\ncommon spiderwort (Tradescantia ohiensis)\n\nCulver’s root (Veronicastrum virginicum)\n\nprairie violet (Viola pedatifida)\n\ngolden alexanders (Zizia aurea )\n\nShrubs\n\nleadplant (Amorpha canescens)\n\nNew Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus)\n\nAmerican hazelnut (Corylus americana)\n\npasture rose (Rosa carolina)\n\nprairie willow (Salix humilis)\n\nTrees\n\nbur oak (Quercus macrocarpa)\n\nNoteworthy Animals\n\nAnts, particularly the genus Formica, play an important role in mixing and aerating prairie soils as they continually build and abandon mounds, overturning large portions of prairie soil in the process. Other important species contributing to soil mixing and aeration include moles, mice, skunks, and badgers. Historically, large herbivores such as bison likely also significantly influenced plant species diversity in prairie and oak savanna ecosystems. Bison selectively forage on grasses and sedges, thereby reducing the dominance of graminoids and providing a competitive advantage to forb species. Additionally, wallowing and trampling by bison helps promote plant species diversity by creating microsites for seed germination and seedling establishment and reducing the dominance of robust perennials.\n\nRare Plants\n\nAmorpha canescens (leadplant, state special concern)\n\nBaptisia lactea (white false indigo, state special concern)\n\nBaptisia leucophaea (cream wild indigo, state endangered)\n\nCoreopsis palmata (prairie coreopsis, state threatened)\n\nDodecatheon meadia (shooting-star, state endangered)\n\nEchinacea purpurea (purple coneflower, presumed extirpated from Michigan)\n\nEryngium yuccifolium (rattlesnake-master, state threatened)\n\nGentiana flavida (white gentian, state endangered)\n\nHoustonia caerulea (bluets, state special concern)\n\nOxalis violacea (violet wood-sorrel, state threatened)\n\nPanicum leibergii (Leiberg’s panic grass, state threatened)\n\nPolygala incarnata (pink milkwort, presumed extirpated from Michigan)\n\nRudbeckia subtomentosa (sweet coneflower, presumed extirpated from Michigan)\n\nSilphium integrifolium (rosinweed, state threatened)\n\nSilphium laciniatum (compass-plant, state threatened)\n\nSisyrinchium strictum (blue-eyed-grass, state special concern)\n\nSpiranthes ovalis (lesser ladies’-tresses, state threatened)\n\nSporobolus heterolepis (prairie dropseed, state threatened)\n\nViola pedatifida (prairie birdfoot violet, state threatened)\n\nRare Animals\n\nAmmodramus henslowii (Henslow’s sparrow, state special concern)\n\nAmmodramus savannarum (grasshopper sparrow, state special concern)\n\nAsio flammeus (short-eared owl, state special concern)\n\nAsio otus (long-eared owl, state threatened)\n\nCircus cyaneus (northern harrier, state special concern)\n\nClemmys guttata (spotted turtle, state threatened)\n\nClonophis kirtlandii (Kirtland’s snake, state threatened)\n\nElaphe o. obsoleta (black rat snake, state special concern)\n\nEmydoidea blandingii (Blanding’s turtle, state special concern)\n\nFlexamia delongi (leafhopper, state special concern)\n\nFlexamia reflexus (leafhopper, state special concern)\n\nLanius ludovicianus migrans (migrant loggerhead shrike, state endangered)\n\nMicrotus ochrogaster (prairie vole, state endangered)\n\nPapaipema beeriana (blazing star borer, state special concern)\n\nPapaipema sciata (Culver’s root borer, state special concern)\n\nPapaipema silphii (silphium borer, state threatened)\n\nProsapia ignipectus (red-legged spittlebug, state special concern)\n\nPygarctia spraguei (Sprague’s pygarctia, state special concern)\n\nSchinia lucens (leadplant flower moth, state endangered)\n\nSistrurus c. catenatus (eastern massasauga, federal candidate species and state special concern )\n\nSpartiniphaga inops (spartina moth, state special concern)\n\nSpiza americana (dickcissel, state special concern)\n\nSturnella neglecta (western meadowlark, state special concern)\n\nTerrapene c. carolina (eastern box turtle, state special concern)\n\nTyto alba (barn owl, state endangered)\n\nBiodiversity Management Considerations\n\nConservation priorities for mesic prairies include identifying, protecting, and managing existing remnants where they occur. Managing mesic prairie requires frequent prescribed burning to protect and enhance plant species diversity, prevent encroachment of trees and tall shrubs, and control non-native invasive species. In addition to prescribed fire, brush cutting accompanied by stump application of herbicide, can be an important component of prairie restoration. To reduce the impacts of management on fire-sensitive species it is important to consider a rotating schedule of prescribed burning in which adjacent management units are burned in alternate years. Alternating burn units provides refugia for fire-intolerant insect species that are then able to recolonize burned areas. Avian species diversity is also thought to be enhanced by managing large areas as a mosaic of burned and unburned patches.\n\nIn addition to reestablishing ecological processes such as fire, most restoration sites will require the reintroduction of appropriate native species and genotypes through seeding or seedling transplants. Small, isolated prairie remnants may harbor plant populations that have suffered from reduced gene flow. Restoration efforts at isolated prairie remnants should consider introducing seeds collected from nearby stocks to augment and maintain genetic diversity of remnant plant populations.\n\nMonitoring and control efforts to detect and remove invasive species are critical to the long-term viability of mesic prairie. Invasive species that threaten the diversity and community structure include common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata), Eurasian honeysuckles (especially Lonicera morrowii, L. tatarica, and L. xbella), multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora), common St. John’s-wort (Hypericum perforatum), ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), hawkweeds (Hieracium spp.), white sweet-clover (Melilotus alba), yellow sweet clover (M. officinalis), Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica), leafy spurge (Euphorbia virgata), wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), bouncing bet (Saponaria officinalis), Canada bluegrass (Poa compressa), Kentucky bluegrass (P. pratensis), smooth brome (Bromus inermis), quack grass (Elymus repens), and timothy (Phleum pratense).\n\nVariation\n\nPrairie plant species diversity is generally higher in occurrences located in far southwestern Michigan than in those located further east or north, likely due to their closer proximity to the central range of prairie in North America.\n\nSimilar Natural Communities\n\nDry-mesic prairie, bur oak plains, oak openings, and mesic sand prairie.\n\nPlaces to Visit\n\nNo remaining sites occur on lands accessible to the public. However, readers may be able to find remnants of mesic prairie along railroad tracks and adjacent to cemeteries in southwestern Michigan.\n\nRelevant Literature\n\nAlbert, D.A. 1995.
