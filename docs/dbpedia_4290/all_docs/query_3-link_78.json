        "text": "Colon cancer proliferating desulfosinigrin in wasabi (Wasabia japonica).\n\nPubMed\n\nWeil, Marvin J; Zhang, Yanjun; Nair, Muraleedharan G\n\n2004-01-01\n\nA reduced incidence of different types of cancer has been linked to consumption of Brassica vegetables, and there is evidence that glucosinolates (GSLs) and their hydrolysis products play a role in reducing cancer risk. Wasabi (Wasabia japonica) and horseradish (Armoracia rusticana), both Brassica vegetables, are widely used condiments both in Japanese cuisine and in the United States. Desulfosinigrin (DSS) (1) was isolated from a commercially available wasabi powder and from fresh wasabi roots. Sinigrin (2) was isolated from horseradish roots. DSS and sinigrin were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes, on lipid peroxidation, and on the proliferation of human colon (HCT-116), breast (MCF-7), lung (NCIH460), and central nervous system (CNS, SF-268) cancer cell lines. DSS did not inhibit COX enzymes or lipid peroxidation at 250 microg/ml. Sinigrin inhibited lipid peroxidation by 71% at 250 microg/ml. However, DSS promoted the growth of HCT-116 (colon) and NCI H460 (lung) human cancer cells as determined by the MTT assay in a concentration-dependent manner. At 3.72 microg/ml, a 27% increase in the number of viable human HCT-116 colon cancer cells was observed; the corresponding increases at 7.50 and 15 microg/ml were 42 and 69%, respectively. At 60 microg/ml, DSS doubled the number of HCT-16 colon cancer cells. For NCI H460 human lung cancer cells, DSS at 60 microg/ml increased the cell number by 20%. Sinigrin showed no proliferating effect on the tumor cells tested. This is the first report of the tumor cell-proliferating activity by a desulfoglucosinolate, the biosynthetic precursor of GSLs found in Brassica spp.\n\nCloning of a FLOWERING LOCUS T ortholog in Wasabia japonica (Matsum).\n\nPubMed\n\nKubo, Hiroyoshi; Yoshida, Kiyoshi; Nozue, Masayuki\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA FLOWERING LOCUS T ortholog (WjFT) was identified in Wasabia japonica. Heterologous expression of WjFT remarkably promoted the flowering of Arabidopsis. The expression of WjFT was examined in field-grown wasabi in October and November of 2009, and February of 2010 because the differentiation of flower buds occurs in autumn in field-grown wasabi. No expression of WjFT was detected in October, it was slightly increased in November, and highly increased in February. WjFT might be useful for examining the flowering response of wasabi.\n\nTumor cell proliferation and cyclooxygenase inhibitory constituents in horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) and Wasabi (Wasabia japonica).\n\nPubMed\n\nWeil, Marvin J; Zhang, Yanjun; Nair, Muraleedharan G\n\n2005-03-09\n\nCyclooxygenase and human tumor cell growth inhibitory extracts of horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) and wasabi (Wasabia japonica) rhizomes upon purification yielded active compounds 1-3 from horseradish and 4 and 5 from wasabi rhizomes. Spectroscopic analyses confirmed the identities of these active compounds as plastoquinone-9 (1), 6-O-acyl-beta-d-glucosyl-beta-sitosterol (2), 1,2-dilinolenoyl-3-galactosylglycerol (3), linolenoyloleoyl-3-beta-galactosylglycerol (4), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-beta-galactosylglycerol (5). 3-Acyl-sitosterols, sinigrin, gluconasturtiin, and phosphatidylcholines isolated from horseradish and alpha-tocopherol and ubiquinone-10 from wasabi rhizomes isolated were inactive in our assays. At a concentration of 60 microg/mL, compounds 1 and 2 selectively inhibited COX-1 enzyme by 28 and 32%, respectively. Compounds 3, 4, and 5 gave 75, 42, and 47% inhibition of COX-1 enzyme, respectively, at a concentration of 250 microg/mL. In a dose response study, compound 3 inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells (HCT-116) by 21.9, 42.9, 51.2, and 68.4% and lung cancer cells (NCI-H460) by 30, 39, 44, and 71% at concentrations of 7.5, 15, 30, and 60 microg/mL, respectively. At a concentration of 60 microg/mL, compound 4 inhibited the growth of colon, lung, and stomach cancer cells by 28, 17, and 44%, respectively. This is the first report of the COX-1 enzyme and cancer cell growth inhibitory monogalactosyl diacylglycerides from wasabi and horseradish rhizomes.\n\nCryopreservation of in vitro-grown apical meristems of wasabi (Wasabia japonica) by vitrification and subsequent high plant regeneration.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsumoto, T; Sakai, A; Yamada, K\n\n1994-05-01\n\nIn vitro-grown apical meristems of wasabi (Wasabia japonica Matsumura) were successfully cryopreserved by vitrification. Excised apical meristems precultured on solidified M S medium containing 0.3M sucrose at 20Â°C for 1 day were loaded with a mixture of 2M glycerol and 0.4M sucrose for 20 min at 25Â°C. Cryoprotected meristems were then sufficiently dehydrated with a highly concentrated vitrification solution (designated PVS2) for 10 min at 25Â°C prior to a plunge into liquid nitrogen. After rapid warming, the meristems were expelled into 2 ml of 1.2M sucrose for 20 min and then plated on solidified culture medium. Successfully vitrified and warmed meristems remained green after plating, resumed growth within 3 days, and directly developed shoots within two weeks. The average rate of normal shoot formation amounted to about 80 to 90% in the cryopreserved meristems. This method was successfully applied to three other cultivars of wasabi. This vitrification procedure promises to become a routine method for cryopreserving meristems of wasabi.\n\nMolecular Mechanisms Underlying Anti-Inflammatory Actions of 6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl Isothiocyanate Derived from Wasabi (Wasabia japonica)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nUto, Takuhiro; Hou, De-Xing; Morinaga, Osamu; Shoyama, Yukihiro\n\n2012-01-01\n\n6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) is a major bioactive compound in wasabi (Wasabia japonica), which is a typical Japanese pungent spice. Recently, in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that 6-MSITC has several biological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiplatelet, and anticancer effects. We previously reported that 6-MSITC strongly suppresses cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cytokines, which are important factors that mediate inflammatory processes. Moreover, molecular analysis demonstrated that 6-MSITC blocks the expressions of these factors by suppressing multiple signal transduction pathways to attenuate the activation of transcriptional factors. Structure-activity relationships of 6-MSITC and its analogues containing an isothiocyanate group revealed that methylsulfinyl group and the length of alkyl chain of 6-MSITC might be related to high inhibitory potency. In this paper, we review the anti-inflammatory properties of 6-MSITC and discuss potential molecular mechanisms focusing on inflammatory responses by macrophages.

Two administration routes, subcutaneous or intravenous, and two administration times, prior to or concomitant with tumor inoculation, of 6-MITC or T-wasabi against the metastatic foci formation in C57BL/6J mouse lungs were compared. The number of metastasized foci per lung in either subcutaneous or intravenous injection was significantly reduced by intake of 6-MITC or a T-wasabi fraction. The maximum reduction by a T-wasabi fraction reached to 82%. Fifty-six percent of foci formation was inhibited by a 2 week-prior administration of 6-MITC (200 microM), whereas only 27% inhibition was obtained by a concomitant administration with tumor inoculation. Neither 6-MITC nor T-wasabi at tested concentrations showed any toxic effects. Together with our previous results, a component of the Japanese pungent spice, wasabi appears to inhibit not only tumor cell growth but also tumor metastasis. Therefore, 6-MITC from wasabi is apparently a useful dietary candidate for controlling tumor progression.\n\nWasalexins A and B, new phytoalexins from wasabi: isolation, synthesis, and antifungal activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nPedras, M S; Sorensen, J L; Okanga, F I; Zaharia, I L\n\n1999-10-18\n\nThe chemical structure determination of two phytoalexins from wasabi (Wasabia japonica, syn. Eutrema wasabi), a plant resistant to virulent isolates of the blackleg fungus [Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.) Ces. et de Not., asexual stage Phoma lingam (Tode ex Fr.) Desm.], as well as their synthesis and antifungal activity towards isolates of P. lingam and P. wasabiae is reported.\n\nThe effect of 6-methylthiohexyl isothiocyanate isolated from Wasabia japonica (wasabi) on 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-buatnone-induced lung tumorigenesis in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nYano, T; Yajima, S; Virgona, N; Yano, Y; Otani, S; Kumagai, H; Sakurai, H; Kishimoto, M; Ichikawa, T\n\n2000-07-31\n\nThe present study was undertaken to estimate the effect of 6-methylthiohexyl isothiocyanate (6MHITC) isolated from Wasabia japonica (wasabi) pretreatment on 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone(NNK)-induced lung tumorigenesis in mice. Pretreatment with 6MHITC for 4 consecutive days at a daily dose of 5 micromol significantly inhibited NNK-induced O(6)-methylguanine formation in lungs at 4 h after the injection. In conjugation with this inhibitory effect, 6MHITC suppressed the increase in proliferating nuclear cell antigen level as well as ornithine decarboxylase activity at a promotion stage of NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis. Finally, this treatment of 6MHITC suppressed the NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis in mice. These results suggest that 6MHITC inhibits the development of lung tumors in mice treated with NNK, due to the suppression of initiation stage.\n\nBactericidal activity of wasabi (Wasabia japonica) against Helicobacter pylori.\n\nPubMed\n\nShin, Il Shik; Masuda, Hideki; Naohide, Kinae\n\n2004-08-01\n\nIn this study, the bactericidal activity of Korean and Japanese wasabi roots, stems and leaves against Helicobacter pylori were examined. Allyl isothiocyanate (AIT) in roots, stems and leaves of Korean wasabi were 0.75, 0.18 and 0.32 mg/g, respectively. AIT in roots, stems and leaves of Japanese wasabi were 1.18, 0.41 and 0.38 mg/g, respectively. All parts of wasabi showed bactericidal activities against H. pylori strain NCTC 11637, YS 27 and YS 50. The leaves of both wasabi showed the highest bactericidal activities with the minimum bactericidal concentration of 1.05-1.31 mg of dry weight/ml against three strains of H. pylori. The roots showed a little lower bactericidal activity with 2.09-4.17 mg of dry weight/ml against them. The main component related to antimicrobial activity in wasabi is well known to be AIT. In this study, the bactericidal activity of leaves was higher than that of roots, although AIT amount of leaves was lower than that of roots. These results suggest that certain components besides AIT in wasabi are effective in killing H. pylori.\n\nAnti-obesity effects of hot water extract from Wasabi (Wasabia japonica Matsum.) leaves in mice fed high-fat diets\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOgawa, Tetsuro; Wang, Li; Katsube, Takuya; Yamasaki, Yukikazu; Sun, Xufeng; Shiwaku, Kuninori\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe anti-obesity effects of a hot water extract from wasabi (Wasabia japonica Matsum.) leaves (WLE), without its specific pungent constituents, such as allyl-isothiocyanate, were investigated in high fat-diet induced mice. C57J/BL mice were fed a high-fat diet (control group) or a high-fat diet supplemented with 5% WLE (WLE group). Physical parameters and blood profiles were determined. Gene expression associated with lipid metabolism in liver and white adipose tissue were analyzed. After 120 days of feeding, significantly lower body weight gain, liver weight and epididymal white adipose tissue weight was observed in the WLE group compared to the control group. In liver gene expression within the WLE group, PPARÎ± was significantly enhanced and SREBP-1c was significantly suppressed. Subsequent downstream genes controlled by these regulators were significantly suppressed. In epididymal white adipose tissue of the WLE group, expression of leptin, PPARÎ³, and C/EBPÎ± were significantly suppressed and adiponectin was significantly enhanced. Acox, related to fatty acid oxidization in adipocytes, was also enhanced. Our results demonstrate that the WLE dietary supplement induces mild suppression of obesity in a high-fat diet induced mice, possibly due to suppression of lipid accumulation in liver and white adipose tissue.

AA is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) to glycidamide (GA), which forms DNA adducts. This study examined the inhibitory effects of wasabi (Japanese horseradish, Wasabia japonica) roots and leaves as well as their active component, allyl isothiocyanate (AIT), on the formation and genotoxicity of AA. AA formation (51.8âÂ±â4.2 Âµg kg -1 ) was inhibited with â¥2 mg mL -1 of AIT. Wasabi roots also inhibited AA formation (â¼90% reduction), but wasabi leaves were not effective at 2 mg mL -1 . Wasabi roots and leaves decreased the number of cells with micronuclei by approximately 33 and 24% respectively compared with the AA treatment group. Moreover, wasabi roots and leaves (100 mg kg -1 body weight (BW) day -1 for each) decreased AA (100 mg kg -1 BW day -1 )-induced DNA damage. The AA-induced CYP2E1 activity was decreased by 39 and 26% with wasabi roots and leaves respectively. Further, the activity of glutathione S-transferase, which catalyzes the detoxification of AA via glutathione conjugation, increased by 54 and 33% with wasabi roots and leaves respectively. These results indicate that wasabi roots and leaves are effective ingredients for inhibiting the formation and genotoxicity of AA. Â© 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

By in vitro bioassay, 53 NEB strains showing nematicidal efficacies of >50% against J2 of M. incognita were isolated from wasabi. Basing on 16S rRNA gene sequences, these NEB were identified into 18 species of 11 genera. In greenhouse, incorporation of selected NEB culture or FWR into potted soil significantly reduced infection of M. incognita on tomato. Treating tomatoes with either FWR or NEB of Raoultella terrigena RN16 and Pseudomonas reinekei SN21 in the field yielded excellent control efficacies against M. incognita, especially the combinations of FWR with either R. terrigena RN16 or Ps. reinekei SN21 at doses of 50 g plus 100 ml per plant or more. The results established that R. terrigena RN16 and Ps. reinekei SN21 applied separately or combined with FWR have the potential to provide bioprotection agents against M. incognita. This study provides novel way for disease management using combination of endophyte and host residue. Â© 2014 The Society for Applied Microbiology.\n\nWasabia japonica is a potential functional food to prevent colitis via inhibiting the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nKang, Ju-Hee; Choi, Seungho; Jang, Jeong-Eun; Ramalingam, Prakash; Ko, Young Tag; Kim, Sun Yeou; Oh, Seung Hyun\n\n2017-08-01\n\nInflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are prevalent and debilitating health problems worldwide. Many types of drugs are used to treat IBDs, but they exhibit adverse effects such as vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, etc. In order to overcome the limitations of current therapeutic drugs, scientists have searched for functional foods from natural resources. In this study, we investigated the anti-colitic effects of Wasabia japonica extract in a DSS-induced colitis model. Wasabi japonica is a plant of the Brassicaceae family that has recently been reported to exhibit properties of detoxification, anti-inflammation, and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. In this study, we generated wasabi ethanol extract (WK) and assessed its anti-colitic effect. In addition, in order to improve delivery of the extract to the colon, WK was coated with 5% Eudragit S100 (WKE), after which the anti-colitic effects of WKE were assessed. In conclusion, WK prevented development of colitis through inhibition of the NF-kB signaling pathway and recovery of epithelial tight junctions. In addition, the anti-colitic effect of WK was enhanced by improving its delivery to the colon by coating the WK with Eudragit S100. Therefore, we suggest that wasabi can be used as a new functional food to prevent IBDs due to its anti-colitic effect.\n\nThe induction of apoptosis and autophagy by Wasabia japonica extract in colon cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nHsuan, Shu-Wen; Chyau, Charng-Cherng; Hung, Hsiao-Yu; Chen, Jing-Hsien; Chou, Fen-Pi\n\n2016-03-01\n\nWasabia japonica (wasabi) has been shown to exhibit properties of detoxification, anti-inflammation and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of the cytotoxicity of wasabi extract (WE) in colon cancer cells to evaluate the potential of wasabi as a functional food for chemoprevention. Colo 205 cells were treated with different doses of WE, and the cytotoxicity was analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. Apoptosis and autophagy were detected by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl-imidacarbo-yanine iodide and staining for acidic vascular organelles (AVOs), along with Western blotting. The results demonstrated that WE induced the extrinsic pathway and mitochondrial death machinery through the activation of TNF-Î±, Fas-L, caspases, truncated Bid and cytochrome C. WE also induced autophagy by decreasing the phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR and promoting the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II and AVO formation. An in vivo xenograft model verified that tumor growth was delayed by WE treatment. Our studies revealed that WE exhibits anti-colon cancer properties through the induction of apoptosis and autophagy. These results provide support for the application of WE as a chemopreventive functional food and as a prospective treatment of colon cancer.\n\nGlycogen synthase kinase-3Î² inhibition of 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate derived from wasabi (Wasabia japonica Matsum).\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshida, Jun; Nomura, Satomi; Nishizawa, Naoyuki; Ito, Yoshiaki; Kimura, Ken-ichi\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA new biological activity of 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate derived from Wasabia japonica was discovered as an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3Î². The most potent isothiocyanate, 9-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate, inhibited glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² at a K(i) value of 10.5 ÂµM and showed ATP competitive inhibition. The structure-activity relationship revealed an inhibitory potency of methylsulfinyl isothiocyanate dependent on the alkyl chain length and the sulfoxide, sulfone, and/or the isothiocyanate moiety.\n\nAntiplatelet and anticancer isothiocyanates in Japanese domestic horseradish, wasabi.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorimitsu, Y; Hayashi, K; Nakagawa, Y; Horio, F; Uchida, K; Osawa, T\n\n2000-01-01\n\n6-Methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (MS-ITC) was isolated from wasabi (Wasabia japonica, Japanese domestic horseradish) as a potential inhibitor of human platelet aggregation in vitro through our extensive screening of vegetables and fruits. In the course of another screening for the induction of glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in RL34 cells. MS-ITC was inadvertently isolated from wasabi as a potential inducer of GST. MS-ITC administered to rats or mice also showed both activities in vivo. As a result from elucidation of the platelet aggregation inhibition and the GST induction mechanisms of MS-ITC, the isothiocyanate moiety of MS-ITC plays an important role for antiplatelet and anticancer activities because of its highly reactivity with sulfhydryl (-SH) groups in biomolecules (GSH, cysteine residue in a certain protein, etc.).\n\nAntiplatelet and anticancer isothiocyanates in Japanese domestic horseradish, Wasabi.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorimitsu, Y; Hayashi, K; Nakagawa, Y; Fujii, H; Horio, F; Uchida, K; Osawa, T\n\n2000-07-31\n\n6-Methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (MS-ITC) was isolated from wasabi (Wasabia japonica, Japanese domestic horseradish) as a potential inhibitor of human platelet aggregation in vitro through our extensive screening of vegetables and fruits.

During the incubation, viable Vibrio counts were determined on TCBS agar plates. Both LEAN and FATTY suspensions were inoculated with V. parahaemolyticus AOTO-81, (1.28+/-0.20) x 10(2) CFU/ml, followed by addition of 20 mg wasabi/ml, and incubation for 8 h. The viable Vibrio counts were (7.76+/-5.93) x 10(5) CFU/ml in LEAN and (3.50+/-2.65) x 10(1) CFU/ml in FATTY. When the same strain, at (1.18+/-0.22) x 10(2) CFU/ml, was incubated for 8 h with 50.9 microg AIT/ml, viable Vibrio counts were (4.79+/-1.78) x 10(4) CFU/ml in LEAN and (1.80+/-1.30) x 10(1) CFU/ml in FATTY. Growth of the other three strains with wasabi or AIT was shown to be less in FATTY than in LEAN. These results indicate that growth of V. parahaemolyticus is inhibited more in FATTY than in LEAN by wasabi and allyl isothiocyanate.\n\nWasabi leaf extracts attenuate adipocyte hypertrophy through PPARÎ³ and AMPK.\n\nPubMed\n\nOowatari, Yasuo; Ogawa, Tetsuro; Katsube, Takuya; Iinuma, Kiyohisa; Yoshitomi, Hisae; Gao, Ming\n\n2016-08-01\n\nHypertrophy of adipocytes in obese adipose tissues causes metabolic abnormality by adipocytokine dysregulation, which promotes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. We investigated the effects of wasabi (Wasabia japonica Matsum) leaf extracts on metabolic abnormalities in SHRSP.Z-Leprfa/IzmDmcr rats (SHRSP/ZF), which are a model of metabolic syndrome. Male SHRSP/ZF rats aged 7Â weeks were divided into two groups: control and wasabi leaf extract (WLE) groups, which received water or oral treatment with 4Â g/kg/day WLE for 6Â weeks. WLE improved the body weight gain and high blood pressure in SHRSP/ZF rats, and the plasma triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the WLE group. Adipocyte hypertrophy was markedly prevented in adipose tissue. The expression of PPARÎ³ and subsequent downstream genes was suppressed in the WLE group adipose tissues. Our data suggest that WLE inhibits adipose hypertrophy by suppressing PPARÎ³ expression in adipose tissue and stimulating the AMPK activity by increased adiponectin.\n\nLeaf extract of Wasabia japonica relieved oxidative stress induced by Helicobacter pylori infection and stress loading in Mongolian gerbils.\n\nPubMed\n\nSekiguchi, Hirotaka; Takabayashi, Fumiyo; Deguchi, Yuya; Masuda, Hideki; Toyoizumi, Tomoyasu; Masuda, Shuichi; Kinae, Naohide\n\n2010-01-01\n\nInfection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) can induce gastric disorders, and though its presence cannot explain disease pathogenesis and does not have associations with other factors, it is well known that H. pylori infection causes stomach inflammation following oxidative stress. We examined the suppressive effects of a leaf extract of Wasabia japonica on H. pylori infection and on stress loading in Mongolian gerbils. Following oral administration of wasabi extract of 50 and 200 mg/kg B.W./d for 10 d, the animals were exposed to restraint stress for 90 and 270 min. As for the results, the level of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in the stomach and oxidative DNA damage in peripheral erythrocytes at 270 min significantly increased. That elevation was significantly suppressed by the addition of the leaf extract. We concluded that the simultaneous loading of H. pylori infection and physical stress loading might induce oxidative DNA damage additively, while a leaf extract attenuated this DNA damage in the stomach as well as the peripheral erythrocytes.\n\nIsothiocyanates from Wasabia japonica activate transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 channel.\n\nPubMed\n\nUchida, Kunitoshi; Miura, Yosuke; Nagai, Masashi; Tominaga, Makoto\n\n2012-11-01\n\n6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) and 6-(methylthio)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MTITC) have low pungency and are responsible for the fresh flavor of wasabi (Wasabia japonica [Miq] Matsumura). In this study, we found that these two isothiocyanates activate transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), and 6-MSITC activates transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), but not other transient receptor potential channels expressed in sensory neurons. Both 6-MSITC and 6-MTITCinduced intracellular Ca(2+) increases in human embryonic kidney-derived 293 cells expressing mouse TRPA1 (mTRPA1) as measured by Ca(2+) imaging. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, 6-MSITC and 6-MTITC dose-dependently activated both mTRPA1 (EC(50) = 147Â±26 ÂµM for 6-MSITC and 30Â±3 ÂµM for 6-MTITC) and human TRPA1 (hTRPA1; EC(50) = 39Â±4 ÂµM for 6-MSITC and 34Â±3 ÂµM for 6-MTITC). In addition, TRPA1 N-terminal cysteines, which are reported to be important for channel activation by electrophilic ligands, were involved in 6-MSITC- and 6-MTITC-evoked TRPA1 activation. These isothiocyanates also activated endogenous TRPA1 expressed in mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons and intraplantar injection of 10-30 mM 6-MSITC-evoked pain-related behaviors in mice. These results indicate the following: 1) 6-MSITC and 6-MTITC activate both mTRPA1 and hTRPA1; 2) 6-MSITC activates mTRPV1; and 3) the pharmacological functions of these isothiocyanates could be derived from TRPA1 activation.\n\nIn situ observation of the generation of isothiocyanates from sinigrin in horseradish and wasabi.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, E Y; Pickering, I J; George, G N; Prince, R C\n\n2001-08-15\n\nSulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been used to determine the chemical identity of the sulfur-containing species in horseradish (Armoracia lapthifolia) and wasabi (Wasabia japonica) in situ, before and after cell disruption. The major sulfur-containing species in the intact root is sinigrin (1-thio-beta-D-glucopyranose 1-N-(sulfoxy)-3-buteneimidate) and related congeners. Disrupting the cells by applying local pressure allowed the conversion of the sulfur moieties in sinigrin to isothiocyanates and sulfate in approximately equimolar amounts. In contrast to previous suggestions, no detectable thiocyanates were formed, but an unusual thio intermediate may have been identified for the first time.\n\n5-Hydroxyferulic acid methyl ester isolated from wasabi leaves inhibits 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMisawa, Naoki; Hosoya, Takahiro; Yoshida, Shuhei; Sugimoto, Osamu; Yamada-Kato, Tomoe; Kumazawa, Shigenori\n\n2018-02-26\n\nTo investigate the compounds present in wasabi leaves (Wasabia japonica Matsumura) that inhibit the adipocyte differentiation, activity-guided fractionation was performed on these leaves. 5-Hydroxyferulic acid methyl ester (1: 5-HFA ester), one of the phenylpropanoids, was isolated from wasabi leaves as a compound that inhibits the adipocyte differentiation. Compound 1 suppressed the intracellular lipid accumulation of 3T3-L1 cells without significant cytotoxicity. Gene expression analysis revealed that 1 suppressed the mRNA expression of 2 master regulators of adipocyte differentiation, PPARÎ³ and C/EBPÎ±. Furthermore, 1 downregulated the expression of adipogenesis-related genes, GLUT4, LPL, SREBP-1c, ACC, and FAS. Protein expression analysis revealed that 1 suppressed PPARÎ³ protein expression. Moreover, to investigate the relationship between the structure and activity of inhibiting the adipocyte differentiation, we synthesized 12 kinds of phenylpropanoid analog. Comparison of the activity among 1 and its analogs suggested that the compound containing the substructure that possess a common functional group at the ortho position such as a catechol group exhibits the activity of inhibiting the adipocyte differentiation. Taken together, our findings suggest that 1 from wasabi leaves inhibits adipocyte differentiation via the downregulation of PPARÎ³.

In this study, the genetic stability of cryopreserved wasabi shoot tips stored for 10 years at -150 degree C was visualized using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and Methylation Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP). The study included plants derived from cryopreserved shoot tips after 10.5 years storage at -150 degree C (LN10yr), after 2 h storage at -196 degree C (LN2hr), cryopreservation controls (No LN cooling (TC)) and non-treated controls without LN cooling (LC). The donor plants for LN2hr, TC and LC were also maintained in vitro at 20 degree C for the same period. Neither technique detected genetic variations in either control or cryopreserved plants. Some mutations were noted in plants maintained in tissue culture for 10 years. Comparison of genome stability for TC and LN2hr plants showed only a minor change in DNA. However, when comparing the LC and Ln10yr, many differences were found. We conclude that cryopreservation is a superior conservation method compared to tissue culture in maintaining genetic stability for a long-term storage of wasabi germplasm.\n\nTransfer of the potato plant isolates of Pectobacterium wasabiae to Pectobacterium parmentieri sp. nov.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhayi, Slimane; Cigna, JÃ©rÃ©my; Chong, Teik Min; QuÃªtu-Laurent, AngÃ©lique; Chan, Kok-Gan; HÃ©lias, ValÃ©rie; Faure, Denis\n\n2016-12-01\n\nPectobacterium wasabiae was originally isolated from Japanese horseradish (Eutrema wasabi), but recently some Pectobacterium isolates collected from potato plants and tubers displaying blackleg and soft rot symptoms were also assigned to P. wasabiae. Here, combining genomic and phenotypical data, we re-evaluated their taxonomic position. PacBio and Illumina technologies were used to complete the genome sequences of P. wasabiae CFBP 3304T and RNS 08-42-1A. Multi-locus sequence analysis showed that the P. wasabiae strains RNS 08-42-1A, SCC3193, CFIA1002 and WPP163, which were collected from potato plant environment, constituted a separate clade from the original Japanese horseradish P. wasabiae. The taxonomic position of these strains was also supported by calculation of the in-silico DNA-DNA hybridization, genome average nucleotide indentity, alignment fraction and average nucleotide indentity values. In addition, they were phenotypically distinguished from P. wasabiae strains by producing acids from (+)-raffinose, Î±-d(+)-Î±-lactose, d(+)-galactose and (+)-melibiose but not from methyl Î±-d-glycopyranoside, (+)-maltose or malonic acid. The name Pectobacterium parmentieri sp. nov. is proposed for this taxon; the type strain is RNS 08-42-1AT (=CFBP 8475T=LMG 29774T).\n\nIntegrated Process for Production of Galangal Acetate, the \"Wasabi-Like\" Spicy Compound, and Analysis of Essential Oils of Rhizoma Alpinia officinarum (Hance) Farw.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Li-Yun; Shen, Kun-Hung; Yeh, Xiang-YÃ¼; Huang, Bou-YÃ¼; Wang, Hui-Er; Chen, Kuan-Chou; Peng, Robert Y\n\n2016-06-01\n\nRhizoma Alpinia officinarum (Hance) Farw, Zingiberaceae (AO), a ginger family herb exhibiting stimulant and a carminative bioactivity, is widely used in European and Asian countries as spicy condiment and medicinal uses. Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is the main pungent taste of native Wasabi (Wasabia japonica). The cytotoxicity of AITC has been implicated in thymus, adrenals, and white blood cells. Considering food safety, apparently a safer substitute for wasabi is worthy commercialized. Previously, we found AO crude paste to be rather feasible for use as a \"Wasabi-substitute\" in fresh meat and cold salads. A process linking cold ethyl acetate (EtAc) extraction with silica gel adsorption and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (mobile phase, 75% methanol) was used to isolate galangal acetate, the Wasabi-like taste constituent. AO contained abundant galangal acetate (3.84 Â± 0.07%) compared to A. galangal (0.57 Â± 0.16%), and as already confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS)/MS and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR), galangal acetate was particularly thermally labile. The steam distilled essential oil (SDEO) of AO (0.14% on wet basis) contained 80 compounds (number of component, %): monoterpene hydrocarbon (21, 13.83%); oxygenated monoterpene (17, 27.08%); sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (20, 31.03%), and oxygenated sesquiterpene (20, 21.85%), respectively. However, no spicy wasabi-like constituent remained in SDEO. Alternatively, n-hexane, EtAc, and methanol extracts of AO all showed potent DPPH- and superoxide anion-scavenging activity. Conclusively, SDEO although contains 80 volatiles, galangal acetate is absent due to thermal instability. Galangal acetate exhibits pleasant \"Wasabi-like taste\" for which we have successively developed an integrated process for mass production.

Allylisothiocyanate (AIT) is a potent component in both plants and occurs by grating them. It is well known that AIT shows inhibitory effect on the growth of food poisoning bacteria and fungi. In this work, several functional properties of roots and leaves from wasabi and horseradish were examined in vitro. Each sample showed peroxidase activity. They also exhibited antioxidative and superoxide scavenging potency. Antimutagenic activity was observed toward 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline [MeIQx], a well-known mutagen/carcinogen in broiled fish and meat. They also decreased His+ revertant colonies of 3-chloro-4-dichloromethyl-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX) in the Ames test, a strong mutagen and carcinogen in chlorine disinfected tap water. Isolation of antimutagenic components in wasabi root was done. Three components including (-)-(R)-7-methylsulfinylheptyl isothiocyanate were identified. These data show that wasabi and horseradish might be potent functional foods for keeping human health.\n\nEffect of Wasabi Component 6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl Isothiocyanate and Derivatives on Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Yu-Jen; Huang, Yu-Chuen; Tsai, Tung-Hu\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe naturally occurring compound 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MITC) was isolated from Wasabia japonica (Wasabi), a pungent spice used in Japanese food worldwide. The synthetic derivatives 6-(methylsulfenyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (I7447) and 6-(methylsulfonyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (I7557) are small molecule compounds derived from 6-MITC. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of these compounds on human pancreatic cancer cells. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and BxPC-3 were used to perform an MTT assay for cell viability and Liu's stain for morphological observation. The cell cycle was analyzed by DNA histogram. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity was used as a marker for cancer stem cells (CSC). Western blotting was performed for the expression of proteins related to CSC signaling. The results showed that compounds 6-MITC and I7557, but not I7447, inhibited viability of both PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. Morphological observation showed mitotic arrest and apoptosis in 6-MITC- and I7557-treated cells. These two compounds induced G2/M phase arrest and hypoploid population. Percentages of ALDH-positive PANC-1 cells were markedly reduced by 6-MITC and I7557 treatment. The expression of CSC signaling molecule SOX2, but not NOTCH1, ABCG2, Sonic hedgehog, or OCT4, was inhibited by 6-MITC and I7557. In conclusion, wasabi compounds 6-MITC and I7557 may possess activity against the growth and CSC phenotypes of human pancreatic cancer cells.

Invitro study of methanol and boiled water extracts of wasabi were conducted by analyzing the 1-1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrozyl (DPPH) radial scavenging activity, metal chelating activity and total antioxidant capacity in a comparative manner. The result revealed that methanol extract showed higher TP in flower (3644 mg TAE/100 g dw), leaf (3201 mg TAE/100 g dw) and fruit (3025 mg TAE/100 g dw) as compared to the boiled water extract. Similarly, TF content was also higher in methanol extracts of flower (1152 mg QE/100 g dw) and leaf (325 mg QE/100 g dw), however, the other parts showed ignorable value. Results of antioxidant activity were found at different magnitude of potency. The methanol extract of different parts of wasabi exhibited higher activity in total antioxidant capacity and DPPH radical scavenging assay as compared to water extract. In metal chelating assay, the boiled water extracts of leaf showed higher (76.9%) activity, followed by fruit (68.8%) and flower (62.8%). Ally ITC detected by gas chromatography was present in all of the tissues of wasabi plant but the content was found to be varied in different tissues. Overall, this study will allow consumers and processors to understand the possibility for medical application of wasabi plant by knowing the level of total polyphenol distribution, Ally ITC content and antioxidant property distributed in different parts and tissues.Key words: Allyl ITC, antioxidant, flavonoid, polyphenol, Wasabi japonica.\n\nWasabi 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate induces apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells through p53-independent mitochondrial dysfunction pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nYano, Satoshi; Wu, Shusong; Sakao, Kozue; Hou, De-Xing\n\n2018-05-14\n\n6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC), a major bioactive compound in Wasabi [Wasabia japonica (Miq.) Matsum.], has revealed the inhibitory effect on colon carcinogenesis in rat cancer model although the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study, we used two types of human colorectal cancer cells (HCT116 p53 +/+ and HCT116 p53 -/- ) to investigate the anticancer activity and molecular mechanisms of 6-MSITC. Interestingly, 6-MSITC inhibited the cell proliferation in both types of cells with similar IC 50 value although a light increase in the phosphorylation and accumulation of P53 protein was observed in HCT116 p53 +/+ cells at 24 h after treatment. In addition, 6-MSITC increased the ratio of proapoptotic cells in both types of cells with the same fashion in a p53-independent manner. The data from mitochondrial analysis revealed that 6-MSITC enhanced the ratio of proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein/antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1, and sequentially caused mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÎ¨ m ) loss, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation in both types of cells. Taken together, Wasabi 6-MSITC induced apoptosis of human colorectal cancer cells in p53-independent mitochondrial dysfunction pathway. These findings suggest that 6-MSITC might be a potential agent for colon cancer chemoprevention although with p53 mutation. Â© 2018 BioFactors, 2018.

In order to engineer \"Egusi\" resistant to these diseases, cotyledonary explants of two \"Egusi\" genotypes, 'Ejagham' and NHC1-130, were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA101 harbouring wasabi defensin gene (isolated from Wasabia japonica L.) in a binary vector pEKH1. After co-cultivation for 3 days, infected explants were transferred to MS medium containing 100 mg l(-l) kanamycin to select transformed tissues. After 3 weeks of culture, adventitious shoots appeared directly along the edges of the explants. As much as 19 out of 52 (36.5%) and 25 out of 71 (35.2%) of the explants in genotype NHC1-130 and 'Ejagham', respectively, formed shoots after 6 weeks of culture. As much as 74% (14 out of 19) of the shoots regenerated in genotype NHC1-130 and 72% (18 out of 25) of those produced in genotype 'Ejagham' were transgenic. A DNA fragment corresponding to the wasabi defensin gene or the selection marker nptII was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of all regenerated plant clones rooted on hormone-free MS medium under the same selection pressure, suggesting their transgenic nature. Southern blot analysis confirmed successful integration of 1-5 copies of the transgene. RT-PCR, northern and western blot analyses revealed that wasabi defensin gene was expressed in transgenic lines. Transgenic lines showed increased levels of resistance to Alternaria solani, which causes Alternaria leaf spot and Fusarium oxysporum, which causes Fusarium wilt, as compared to that of untransformed plants.\n\nRetransformation of marker-free potato for enhanced resistance against fungal pathogens by pyramiding chitinase and wasabi defensin genes.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhan, Raham Sher; Darwish, Nader Ahmed; Khattak, Bushra; Ntui, Valentine Otang; Kong, Kynet; Shimomae, Kazuki; Nakamura, Ikuo; Mii, Masahiro\n\n2014-09-01\n\nMulti-auto-transformation vector system has been one of the strategies to produce marker-free transgenic plants without using selective chemicals and plant growth regulators and thus facilitating transgene stacking. In the study reported here, retransformation was carried out in marker-free transgenic potato CV. May Queen containing ChiC gene (isolated from Streptomyces griseus strain HUT 6037) with wasabi defensin (WD) gene (isolated from Wasabia japonica) to pyramid the two disease resistant genes. Molecular analyses of the developed shoots confirmed the existence of both the genes of interest (ChiC and WD) in transgenic plants. Co-expression of the genes was confirmed by RT-PCR, northern blot, and western blot analyses. Disease resistance assay of in vitro plants showed that the transgenic lines co-expressing both the ChiC and WD genes had higher resistance against the fungal pathogens, Fusarium oxysporum (Fusarium wilt) and Alternaria solani (early blight) compared to the non-transformed control and the transgenic lines expressing either of the ChiC or WD genes. The disease resistance potential of the transgenic plants could be increased by transgene stacking or multiple transformations.\n\nImmunochemical detection of food-derived isothiocyanate as a lysine conjugate.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakamura, Toshiyuki; Kitamoto, Noritoshi; Osawa, Toshihiko; Kato, Yoji\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn a previous study we prepared monoclonal antibody against allyl isothiocyanate (AITC)-modified lysine (Lys), and found that AITC reacted with Lys under physiological conditions in vitro (T. Nakamura et al., Chem. Res. Toxicol., 22, 536-542 (2009)). In the present study, antibodies against benzyl isothiocyanate (ITC), 6-methylsulfinylhexyl ITC and phenethyl ITC modified protein were prepared, and the respective monoclonal antibodies, B6C9, 6MS3D10, and PE3A10 were obtained. These antibodies were applied to ITC detection in food using shredded Wasabia japonica (wasabi) and ground Carica papaya (papaya) seed by trapping ITC with biotin-labeled bovine serum albumin. ITC formation from the wasabi and papaya seed samples was confirmed using the antibodies in a dose-dependent manner. These antibodies might be applicable in identifying food-derived ITC.\n\nWasabi-derived 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate induces apoptosis in human breast cancer by possible involvement of the NF-ÎºB pathways.\n\nPubMed\n\nFuke, Yoko; Hishinuma, Madoka; Namikawa, Mayumi; Oishi, Yoshie; Matsuzaki, Takeshi\n\n2014-01-01\n\n6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) is a bioactive ingredient of wasabi (Wasabia japonica), which is a popular spice in Japan. 6-MSITC has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer and melanoma cell lines. We inoculated 30 female Balb-nu/nu mice with MDA-MB-231 or -453 cells, and orally administered varying concentrations of 6-MSITC for 12 days following tumor growth. The tumor volumes and tumor weights from mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells, and the tumor volumes of MDA-MB-453 cells were significantly inhibited by 6-MSITC on Days 9 and 11 after drug administration. DNA fragmentation, DNA ladder, and caspase 3/7 activity performed in vitro revealed that 6-MSITC induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) expression in the nuclei and phosphorylation of inhibitor ÎºBÎ± (IÎºBÎ±) was downregulated by 6-MSITC in a concentration-dependent manner; however, this activity was not observed in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, this downregulation of phosphorylated IÎºBÎ± by 6-MSITC in MDA-MB-231 and -453 cells supports its inhibitory effects on NF-ÎºB activity. The expression of phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) reduced by 6-MSITC was confirmed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, we conclude that 6-MITC promotes apoptosis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting NF-kB and therefore releasing its control of the PI3K/AKT pathway.\n\nComparison of isothiocyanate yield from wasabi rhizome tissues grown in soil or water.\n\nPubMed\n\nSultana, Tamanna; Porter, N G; Savage, G P; McNeil, D L\n\n2003-06-04\n\nThe isothiocyanate (ITC) yield of wasabi, the Japanese horseradish (Wasabi japonica), was measured on its release from glucosinolates in the rhizomes of plants grown in two traditional ways. Mature plants of 18 months old were harvested from two different commercial farms located in the South Island of New Zealand. At one farm, the plants were grown in raised soil beds, while the plants at the other farm were grown in gravel irrigated by river water. Following harvest, the rhizomes from each growth medium were divided into five size groups based on the weight and length of the rhizomes. The different sized rhizomes were also subdivided into proximal, medial, and distal portions of the rhizomes and each portion was further subdivided into epidermis plus cortex, and vascular plus pith. The individual and total ITC contents of each portion (proximal, medial, and distal) of the rhizomes were measured using dichloromethane extraction followed by the GC-FPD. The total ITC content of the rhizomes grown in soil increased (13 times) linearly from 6 to 114 g of rhizome weight, while the mean ITC content of the water-grown wasabi increased (10 times) nonlinearly for similar sized rhizomes. Water-grown rhizomes in the weight range from 18 to 45 g gave significantly (P = 0.030) higher total ITC (1-2 times) than similarly sized soil-grown rhizomes. Analysis of the tissues showed that the total and the individual ITCs were found in significantly higher levels (73 and 64%, respectively) in the skin and cortex tissue compared to the vascular and pith tissues. Analysis of the ITC content of the different locations of the wasabi rhizome showed that the distal portion of the rhizome contained significantly higher levels of both total and individual ITCs compared to the medial and proximal portions of the rhizome.\n\nMicroarray-based determination of anti-inflammatory genes targeted by 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate in macrophages.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Jihua; Uto, Takuhiro; Tanigawa, Shunsuke; Yamada-Kato, Tomeo; Fujii, Makoto; Hou, DE-Xing\n\n2010-01-01\n\n6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) is a bioactive ingredient of wasabi [Wasabia japonica (Miq.)

The genes were further categorized as 'defense, inflammatory response, cytokine activities and receptor activities' and some were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Ingenuity pathway analysis further revealed that wasabi 6-MSITC regulated the relevant networks of chemokines, interleukins and interferons to exert its anti-inflammatory function.\n\nMicroarray-based determination of anti-inflammatory genes targeted by 6-(methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate in macrophages\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCHEN, JIHUA; UTO, TAKUHIRO; TANIGAWA, SHUNSUKE; YAMADA-KATO, TOMEO; FUJII, MAKOTO; HOU, DE-XING\n\n2010-01-01\n\n6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) is a bioactive ingredient of wasabi [Wasabia japonica (Miq.)

Utilizing group analysis, 206 genes affected by 6-MSITC with a â¥2-fold change were classified into 35 categories relating to biological processes (81), molecular functions (108) and signaling pathways (17). The genes were further categorized as âdefense, inflammatory response, cytokine activities and receptor activitiesâ and some were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Ingenuity pathway analysis further revealed that wasabi 6-MSITC regulated the relevant networks of chemokines, interleukins and interferons to exert its anti-inflammatory function.

Use of the selection marker genes conferring antibiotic or herbicide resistance in transgenic plants has been considered a serious problem for environment and the public. Multi-auto-transformation (MAT) vector system has been one of the tools to excise the selection marker gene and produce marker-free transgenic plants. Ipt gene was used as a selection marker gene. Wasabi defensin gene, isolated from Wasabia japonica (a Japanese horseradish which has been a potential source of antimicrobial proteins), was used as a gene of interest. Wasabi defensin gene was cloned from the binary vector, pEKH-WD, to an ipt-type MAT vector, pMAT21, by gateway cloning technology and transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105. Infected cotyledon explants of eggplant were cultured on PGRs- and antibiotic-free MS medium. Extreme shooty phenotype/ipt shoots were produced by the explants infected with the pMAT21-wasabi defensin (WD). The same PGRs- and antibiotic-free MS medium was used in subcultures of the ipt shoots. Subsequently, morphologically normal shoots emerged from the Ipt shoots. Molecular analyses of genomic DNA from transgenic plants confirmed the integration of the WD gene and excision of the selection marker (ipt gene). Expression of the WD gene was confirmed by RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses. In vitro whole plant and detached leaf assay of the marker-free transgenic plants exhibited enhanced resistance against Alternaria solani.\n\nWasabi: An Integrated Platform for Evolutionary Sequence Analysis and Data Visualization.\n\nPubMed\n\nVeidenberg, Andres; Medlar, Alan; LÃ¶ytynoja, Ari\n\n2016-04-01\n\nWasabi is an open source, web-based environment for evolutionary sequence analysis. Wasabi visualizes sequence data together with a phylogenetic tree within a modern, user-friendly interface: The interface hides extraneous options, supports context sensitive menus, drag-and-drop editing, and displays additional information, such as ancestral sequences, associated with specific tree nodes. The Wasabi environment supports reproducibility by automatically storing intermediate analysis steps and includes built-in functions to share data between users and publish analysis results. For computational analysis, Wasabi supports PRANK and PAGAN for phylogeny-aware alignment and alignment extension, and it can be easily extended with other tools. Along with drag-and-drop import of local files, Wasabi can access remote data through URL and import sequence data, GeneTrees and EPO alignments directly from Ensembl. To demonstrate a typical workflow using Wasabi, we reproduce key findings from recent comparative genomics studies, including a reanalysis of the EGLN1 gene from the tiger genome study: These case studies can be browsed within Wasabi at http://wasabiapp.org:8000?id=usecases.

The diversity of signaling networks in a single species has been postulated to allow custom responses to different stimuli; however, little is known about how multiple signals are integrated and the implications of this integration in different ecological contexts. In the plant pathogen Pectobacterium wasabiae (formerly Erwinia carotovora ), two signaling networks-the N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing system and the Gac/Rsm signal transduction pathway-control the expression of secreted plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, its major virulence determinants. We show that the AHL system controls the Gac/Rsm system by affecting the expression of the regulatory RNA RsmB. This regulation is mediated by ExpR2, the quorum-sensing receptor that responds to the P.Â wasabiae cognate AHL but also to AHLs produced by other bacterial species. As a consequence, this level of regulation allows P.Â wasabiae to bypass the Gac-dependent regulation of RsmB in the presence of exogenous AHLs or AHL-producing bacteria. We provide in vivo evidence that this pivotal role of RsmB in signal transduction is important for the ability of P.Â wasabiae to induce virulence in response to other AHL-producing bacteria in multispecies plant lesions. Our results suggest that the signaling architecture in P.Â wasabiae was coopted to prime the bacteria to eavesdrop on other bacteria and quickly join the efforts of other species, which are already exploiting host resources. IMPORTANCE Quorum-sensing mechanisms enable bacteria to communicate through small signal molecules and coordinate group behaviors. Often, bacteria have various quorum-sensing receptors and integrate information with other signal transduction pathways, presumably allowing them to respond to different ecological contexts. The plant pathogen Pectobacterium wasabiae has two N-acyl homoserine lactone\n\nSuppressive effect of wasabi (pungent Japanese spice) on gastric carcinogenesis induced by MNNG in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanida, N; Kawaura, A; Takahashi, A; Sawada, K; Shimoyama, T\n\n1991-01-01\n\nDietary habits have been causally implicated in gastric carcinogenesis, whereas minor dietary items may also play a part. Wasabi is a popular pungent spice in Japanese meals. In this study the effect of wasabi on N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced gastric carcinogenesis was studied in rats. Wistar WKY male rats received drinking water containing 50 micrograms/ml of MNNG or tap water alone and a basal diet (PCE-2) or PCE-2 containing 10% (wt/wt) of wasabi powder for 40 weeks. Thus, three groups were completed as MNNG + PCE-2 (n = 30), MNNG + wasabi (n = 30), and tap water + wasabi (n = 30). At autopsy, nine rats (30%) had seven glandular stomach tumors (2 adenocarcinomas, 2 adenomatous polyps, and 3 adenomatous glandular hyperplasias) and three duodenal adenocarcinomas in the MNNG + PCE-2 group, whereas in the MNNG + wasabi group, two rats (7%) had one forestomach epidermoid cyst and one duodenal carcinosarcoma (corrected chi 2 = 4.63, p less than 0.05 for incidences of glandular stomach tumors between 2 groups). In addition, two rats had microscopic atypical glands in the MNNG + PCE-2 group. There was no tumor in the tap water + wasabi group. These results indicated that glandular stomach carcinogenesis induced by MNNG was suppressed by the administration of wasabi.\n\nAntibacterial Activities of Wasabi against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLu, Zhongjing; Dockery, Christopher R.; Crosby, Michael; Chavarria, Katherine; Patterson, Brett; Giedd, Matthew\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEscherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus are two of the major pathogens frequently involved in foodborne outbreaks. Control of these pathogens in foods is essential to food safety. It is of great interest in the use of natural antimicrobial compounds present in edible plants to control foodborne pathogens as consumers prefer more natural âgreenâ foods. Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is an antimicrobial compound naturally present in wasabi (Japanese horseradish) and several other edible plants. Although the antibacterial effects of pure AITC and wasabi extract (essential oil) against several bacteria have been reported, the antibacterial property of natural wasabi has not been well studied. This study investigated the antibacterial activities of wasabi as well as AITC against E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus. Chemical analysis showed that AITC is the major isothiocyanate in wasabi. The AITC concentration in the wasabi powder used in this study was 5.91 Â± 0.59 mg/g. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of wasabi against E. coli O157:H7 or S. aureus was 1% (or 10 mg/ml). Wasabi at 4% displayed higher bactericidal activity against S. aureus than against E. coli O157:H7. The MIC of AITC against either pathogen was between 10 and 100 Î¼g/ml. AITC at 500 Î¼g/ml was bactericidal against both pathogens while AITC at 1000 Î¼g/ml eliminated E. coli O157:H7 much faster than S. aureus. The results from this study showed that wasabi has strong antibacterial property and has high potential to effectively control E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus in foods. The antibacterial property along with its natural green color, unique flavor, and advantage to safeguard foods at the point of ingestion makes wasabi a promising natural edible antibacterial plant. The results from this study may be of significant interest to the food industry as they develop new and safe foods. These results may also stimulate more research to evaluate the antibacterial effect of wasabi against other\n\nAntibacterial Activities of Wasabi against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Zhongjing; Dockery, Christopher R; Crosby, Michael; Chavarria, Katherine; Patterson, Brett; Giedd, Matthew\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEscherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus are two of the major pathogens frequently involved in foodborne outbreaks.

The wasabi extract was fed to the HR-1 hairless mice, which develop AD-like symptoms with a special diet (HR-AD diet). The extract was expected to reduce the symptoms induced. Wasabi rhizome-containing HR-AD diet (5% and 10%) reduced the scratching behavior, and the 10% wasabi rhizome HR-AD diet significantly reduced scratching behavior on days 28, 35 and 42. Plasma components (histamine, eotaxin, IgE and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)) were decreased in the 10% wasabi rhizome HR-AD diet. In histopathological examinations (toluidine blue (T.B.), major basic protein (MBP), CD4, IL-4, IL-5, eotaxin, TARC and IgE), the wasabi rhizome-containing HR-AD diet (5% and 10%) significantly reduced the number of positive stained cells. These results suggested that the wasabi rhizome extract improved the AD-like symptoms of HR-1 hairless mice.\n\nA food-derived synergist of NGF signaling: identification of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B as a key regulator of NGF receptor-initiated signal transduction.\n\nPubMed\n\nShibata, Takahiro; Nakahara, Hiroko; Kita, Narumi; Matsubara, Yui; Han, Chunguang; Morimitsu, Yasujiro; Iwamoto, Noriko; Kumagai, Yoshito; Nishida, Motohiro; Kurose, Hitoshi; Aoki, Naohito; Ojika, Makoto; Uchida, Koji\n\n2008-12-01\n\nNeurotrophins, such as the nerve growth factor (NGF), play an essential role in the growth, development, survival and functional maintenance of neurons in the central and peripheral systems. They also prevent neuronal cell death under various stressful conditions, such as ischemia and neurodegenerative disorders. NGF induces cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth by binding with and activating the NGF receptor tyrosine kinase followed by activation of a variety of signaling cascades. We have investigated the NGF-dependent neuritogenesis enhancer potential of a food-derived small molecule contained in Brassica vegetables and identified the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B as a key regulator of the NGF receptor-initiated signal transduction. Based on an extensive screening of Brassica vegetable extracts for the neuritogenic-promoting activity in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, we found the Japanese horseradish, wasabi (Wasabia japonica, syn. Eutrema wasabi), as the richest source and identified 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC), an analogue of sulforaphane isolated from broccoli, as one of the major neuritogenic enhancers in the wasabi. 6-HITC strongly enhanced the neurite outgrowth and neurofilament expression elicited by a low-concentration of NGF that alone was insufficient to induce neuronal differentiation. 6-HITC also facilitated the sustained-phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the autophosphorylation of the NGF receptor TrkA. It was found that PTP1B act as a phosphatase capable of dephosphorylating Tyr-490 of TrkA and was inactivated by 6-HITC in a redox-dependent manner. The identification of PTP1B as a regulator of NGF signaling may provide new clues about the chemoprotective potential of food components, such as isothiocyanates.\n\nSignal Integration in Quorum Sensing Enables Cross-Species Induction of Virulence in Pectobacterium wasabiae\n\nPubMed Central\n\nValente, Rita S.; Nadal-Jimenez, Pol; Carvalho, AndrÃ© F.

Multi-auto-transformation (MAT) vector system has been one of the strategies to produce marker-free transgenic plants without using selective chemicals and plant growth regulators (PGRs). In the study reported here, isopentenyltransferase (ipt) gene was used as a selection marker and wasabi defensin (WD) gene, isolated from Wasabia japonica as a target gene. WD was cloned from the binary vector, pEKH-WD to an ipt-type MAT vector, pMAT21 by gateway cloning and transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105. Infected cotyledons of tomato cv. Reiyo were cultured on PGR- and antibiotic-free MS medium. Adventitious shoots were developed by the explants infected with the pMAT21/wasabi defensin. The same PGR- and antibiotic-free MS medium was used in subcultures of the adventitious shoot lines (ASLs) to produce ipt and normal shoots. Approximately, 6Â months after infection morphologically normal shoots were produced. Molecular analyses of the developed shoots confirmed the integration of gene of interest (WD) and excision of the selection marker (ipt). Expression of WD was confirmed by Northern blot and Western blot analyses. The marker-free transgenic plants exhibited enhanced resistance against Botrytis cinerea (gray mold), Alternaria solani (early blight), Fusarium oxysporum (Fusarium wilt) and Erysiphe lycopersici (powdery mildew).\n\nSulforaphane homologues: Enantiodivergent synthesis of both enantiomers, activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor and selective cytotoxic activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nElhalem, Eleonora; Recio, RocÃ­o; Werner, Sabine; Lieder, Franziska; CalderÃ³n-MontaÃ±o, JosÃ© Manuel; LÃ³pez-LÃ¡zaro, Miguel; FernÃ¡ndez, Inmaculada; Khiar, Noureddine\n\n2014-11-24\n\nReported is an enantiodivergent approach for the synthesis of both enantiomers of sulforaphane (SFN) homologues with different chain lengths between the sulfinyl sulfur and the isothiocyanate groups and different substituents on the sulfinyl sulfur. The homologues were designed in order to unravel the effect of all the diversity elements included in sulforaphane's structure. The key step of the approach is the diastereoselective synthesis of both sulfinate ester epimers at sulfur, using as single chiral auxiliary the sugar derived diacetone-d-glucose. The approach allows the first synthesis of both enantiomers of 5-methylsulfinylpentyl isothiocyanate, and the biologically important 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC) found in Japanese horseradish, wasabi (Wasabia japonica). The ability of the synthesized compounds as inductors of phase II detoxifying enzymes has been studied by determining their ability to activate the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2. The cytotoxic activity of all the synthesized compounds against human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and foetal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) is also reported. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

For a subset of the chemoprotective compounds, protection is generated by an increase in the abundance of the protective phase II detoxification enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST). We have recently developed a cell culture system, using rat liver epithelial RL 34 cells, that potently responds to the phenolic antioxidants resulting in the induction of GST activity (Kawamoto, Y., Nakamura, Y., Naito, Y., Torii, Y., Kumagai, T., Osawa, T., Ohigashi, H., Satoh, K., Imagawa, M., and Uchida, K. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 11291-11299.) In the present study, we investigated the phase II-inducing potency of an isothiocyanate compound in vitro and in vivo and examined a possible induction mechanism. Based on an extensive screening of vegetable extracts for GST inducer activity in RL34 cells, we found Japanese horseradish, wasabi (Wasabia japonica, syn. Eutrema wasabi), as the richest source and identified 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC), an analogue of sulforaphane (4-methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate) isolated from broccoli, as the major GST inducer in wasabi. 6-HITC potently induced both class alpha GSTA1 and class pi GSTP1 isozymes in RL34 cells. In animal experiments, we found that 6-MSHI was rapidly absorbed into the body and induced hepatic phase II detoxification enzymes more potently than sulforaphane. The observations that (i) 6-HITC activated the antioxidant response element (ARE), (ii) 6-HITC induced nuclear localization of the transcription factor Nrf2 that binds to ARE, and (iii) the induction of phase II enzyme genes by 6-HITC was completely abrogated in the nrf2-deficient mice, suggest that 6-HITC is a potential activator of the Nrf2/ARE-dependent detoxification pathway.\n\nTranscriptional regulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate: quinone oxidoreductase in murine hepatoma cells by 6-(methylsufinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate, an active principle of wasabi (Eutrema wasabi Maxim).\n\nPubMed\n\nHou, D X; Fukuda, M; Fujii, M; Fuke, Y\n\n2000-12-20\n\nWasabi is a very popular pungent spice in Japan. This study examined the ability of 6-(methylsufinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-MITC), an active principle of wasabi, to induce the cellular expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate: quinone oxidoreductase (QR) in Hepa 1c1c7 cells. The cells were treated with various concentrations of 6-MITC, and were then assessed for cell growth, QR activity and QR mRNA expression. The induction of QR activity and QR mRNA expression was time- and dose-responsive over a narrow range of 0.1-5 microM, with declining induction at higher concentrations due to cell toxicity. Furthermore, transfection studies demonstrated that the induction of transcription of the QR gene by 6-MITC involved an antioxidant/electrophile-responsive element (ARE/EpRE) activation. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which dietary wasabi 6-MITC may be implicated in cancer chemoprevention.\n\nThe effect of isosaponarin isolated from wasabi leaf on collagen synthesis in human fibroblasts and its underlying mechanism.\n\nPubMed\n\nNagai, Masashi; Akita, Keiko; Yamada, Kazuno; Okunishi, Isao\n\n2010-07-01\n\nWasabi has been used as an important spice in Japanese foods. The wasabi leaves were used as a cosmetic material, but its biological activities have not yet been examined. We investigated the effect of isosaponarin derived from wasabi leaf on collagen synthesis in human fibroblasts. The production of type I collagen in human fibroblasts was increased with treatment of wasabi leaf extract. Isosaponarin isolated from wasabi leaves belonged to the group of flavone glycoside, and was the key compound in collagen synthesis from the wasabi leaf ingredients. Isosaponarin increased the type I collagen production at the mRNA gene level. The treatment of isosaponarin did not influence the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) protein, but increased the production of TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaR-II) protein and TbetaR-II mRNA. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H) protein and P4H mRNA were increased by treatment with isosaponarin. Heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) was not increased by treatment with isosaponarin. These results suggested that isosaponarin increased collagen synthesis in human fibroblasts, caused by up-regulated TbetaR-II and P4H production.\n\nRevised Phylogeny and Novel Horizontally Acquired Virulence Determinants of the Model Soft Rot Phytopathogen Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKoskinen, Patrik; Nokso-Koivisto, Jussi; Pasanen, Miia; Broberg, Martin; Plyusnin, Ilja; TÃ¶rÃ¶nen, Petri; Holm, Liisa; Pirhonen, Minna; Palva, E. Tapio\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSoft rot disease is economically one of the most devastating bacterial diseases affecting plants worldwide. In this study, we present novel insights into the phylogeny and virulence of the soft rot model Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193, which was isolated from a diseased potato stem in Finland in the early 1980s. Genomic approaches, including proteome and genome comparisons of all sequenced soft rot bacteria, revealed that SCC3193, previously included in the species Pectobacterium carotovorum, can now be more accurately classified as Pectobacterium wasabiae. Together with the recently revised phylogeny of a few P. carotovorum strains and an increasing number of studies on P. wasabiae, our work indicates that P. wasabiae has been unnoticed but present in potato fields worldwide. A combination of genomic approaches and in planta experiments identified features that separate SCC3193 and other P. wasabiae strains from the rest of soft rot bacteria, such as the absence of a type III secretion system that contributes to virulence of other soft rot species. Experimentally established virulence determinants include the putative transcriptional regulator SirB, two partially redundant type VI secretion systems and two horizontally acquired clusters (Vic1 and Vic2), which contain predicted virulence genes. Genome comparison also revealed other interesting traits that may be related to life in planta or other specific environmental conditions. These traits include a predicted benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase of eukaryotic origin. The novelties found in this work indicate that soft rot bacteria have a reservoir of unknown traits that may be utilized in the poorly understood latent stage in planta. The genomic approaches and the comparison of the model strain SCC3193 to other sequenced Pectobacterium strains, including the type strain of P. wasabiae, provides a solid basis for further investigation of the virulence, distribution and phylogeny of soft rot\n\nOverexpression of the wasabi defensin gene confers enhanced resistance to blast fungus ( Magnaporthe grisea) in transgenic rice.\n\nPubMed\n\nKanzaki, H.; Nirasawa, S.; Saitoh, H.; Ito, M.; Nishihara, M.; Terauchi, R.; Nakamura, I.\n\n2002-11-01\n\nTransgenic rice ( Oryza sativa cv. Sasanishiki) overexpressing the wasabi defensin gene, a plant defensin effective against the rice blast fungus, was generated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Twenty-two T2 homozygous lines harboring the wasabi defensin gene were challenged by the blast fungus. Transformants exhibited resistance to rice blast at various levels. The inheritance of the resistance over generations was investigated. T3 plants derived from two highly blast-resistant T2 lines (WT14-5 and WT43-5) were challenged with the blast fungus using the press-injured spots method. The average size of disease lesions of the transgenic line WT43-5 was reduced to about half of that of non-transgenic plants. The 5-kDa peptide, corresponding to the processed form of the wasabi defensin, was detected in the total protein fraction extracted from the T3 progeny. Transgenic rice plants overproducing wasabi defensin are expected to possess a durable and wide-spectrum resistance (i.e. field resistance) against various rice blast races.\n\nInhibitory effects of wasabi isothiocyanates on chemical mediator release in RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamada-Kato, Tomoe; Nagai, Masashi; Ohnishi, Motoko; Yoshida, Kazutoshi\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWasabi is a plant of Japanese origin. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and produces various isothiocyanates (ITCs). To clarify the type I allergies inhibited by wasabi ITCs, we investigated the inhibitory effect on chemical mediator release from dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA)-stimulated RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells. Allyl ITC (AITC), sec-butyl ITC (s-BuITC), and 3-butenyl ITC (3-BuITC), which have 3 or 4 carbon chains, inhibited histamine release but did not inhibit the release of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) or cysteinyl LTs (CysLTs). 4-Pentenyl ITC (4-PeITC) and 5-hexenyl ITC (5-HeITC), which have 5 or 6 carbon chains and an unsaturated bond at the end, inhibited LTB4 release but did not inhibit the release of histamine or CysLTs. 6-Methylthiohexyl ITC (6-MTITC), 6-methylsulfinylhexyl ITC (6-MSITC), and 6-methylsulfonylhexyl ITC (6-MSFITC), which have a sulfur atom inserted at the end of a 6-carbon chain, inhibited the release of histamine, LTB4, and CysLTs and the elevation in intracellular Ca(2+). These results suggest that wasabi ITCs inhibited type I allergies by inhibiting chemical mediator release and that the inhibitory effects on each chemical mediator were due to differences in the side chain structure of the wasabi ITCs.\n\nWasabi nose: an underreported complication of cyclophosphamide infusions.\n\nPubMed\n\nJanow, Ginger L; Ilowite, Norman T; Wahezi, Dawn M\n\n2011-07-01\n\nWasabi nose, a term used to describe the nasopharyngeal discomfort experienced during cyclophosphamide infusions, is a rare phenomenon, previously described in case reports of adult oncology patients typically receiving high-dose chemotherapy regimens.

Traditionally, it has been used to treat rheumatic arthralgia, blood circulation, and pain. This study focuses on its anti-apoptotic activity through the regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we assessed its neuroprotective efficacy, which it achieves through the upregulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) production. Pretreatment with AITC significantly inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, decreased tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and nitric oxide (NO) production in activated microglia, and increased the nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells. AITC inhibited the nuclear factor (NF-ÎºB-mediated transcription by modulating mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, particularly downregulating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, which was followed by a reduction in the TNF-Î± expression in activated microglia. This promising effect of AITC in controlling JNK/NF-ÎºB/TNF-Î± cross-linking maintains the Bcl-2 gene family and protects neuroblastoma cells from activated microglia-induced toxicity. These findings provide novel insights into the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of AITC on microglial cells, which may have clinical significance in neurodegeneration.\n\nNeuroprotective and Anti-Inflammatory Activities of Allyl Isothiocyanate through Attenuation of JNK/NF-ÎºB/TNF-Î± Signaling\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSubedi, Lalita\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAllyl isothiocyanate (AITC), present in Wasabia japonica (wasabi), is an aliphatic isothiocyanate derived from the precursor sinigrin, which is a glucosinolate present in vegetables of the Brassica family.

Hence, mapping of the static magnetic field (B 0 ) and the excitation field (B 1 ) is not only important to feedback shim algorithms, but also for postprocess contrast-correction procedures. A novel field-inhomogeneity mapping method is presented that allows simultaneous mapping of the water shift and B 1 (WASABI) using an off-resonant rectangular preparation pulse. The induced Rabi oscillations lead to a sinc-like spectrum in the frequency-offset dimension and allow for determination of B 0 by its symmetry axis and of B 1 by its oscillation frequency. Stability of the WASABI method with regard to the influences of T 1 , T 2 , magnetization transfer, and repetition time was investigated and its convergence interval was verified. B 0 and B 1 maps obtained simultaneously by means of WASABI in the human brain at 3âT and 7âT can compete well with maps obtained by standard methods. Finally, the method was applied successfully for B 0 and B 1 correction of chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI (CEST-MRI) data of the human brain. The proposed WASABI method yields a novel simultaneous B 0 and B 1 mapping within 1âmin that is robust and easy to implement. Magn Reson Med 77:571-580, 2017.

As we reported previously, Wasabi isothiocyanates (ITCs) are activators of Nrf2-antioxidant response element pathway, and also inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cyclooxygenase-2. This study is the first to assess the global changes in transcript levels by Wasabi ITCs, comparing with SFN, in HepG2 cells. We performed comparative gene expression profiling by treating HepG2 cells with ITCs, followed by DNA microarray analyses using HG-U133 plus 2.0 oligonucleotide array. Partial array data on selected gene products were confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify functional subsets of genes and biologically significant network pathways. 6-MTITC showed the highest number of differentially altered (â¥2 folds) gene expression, of which 114 genes were upregulated and 75 were downregulated. IPA revealed that Nrf2-mediated pathway, together with glutamate metabolism, is the common significantly modulated pathway across treatments. Interestingly, 6-MSITC exhibited the most potent effect toward Nrf2-mediated pathway. Our data suggest that 6-MSITC could exert chemopreventive role against cancer through its underlying antioxidant activity via the activation of Nrf2-mediated subsequent induction of cytoprotective genes.\n\n6-Methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate modulates endothelial cell function and suppresses leukocyte adhesion.\n\nPubMed\n\nOkamoto, Takayuki; Akita, Nobuyuki; Nagai, Masashi; Hayashi, Tatsuya; Suzuki, Koji\n\n2014-01-01\n\n6-Methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) is an active compound in wasabi (Wasabia japonica Matsum.), which is one of the most popular spices in Japan. 6-MSITC suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage activation, arachidonic- or adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet activation, and tumor cell proliferation. These data indicate that 6-MSITC has several biological activities involving anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant, and anti-apoptosis properties. Endothelial cells (ECs) maintain vascular homeostasis and play crucial roles in crosstalk between blood coagulation and vascular inflammation. In this study, we determined the anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory effects of 6-MSITC on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). 6-MSITC slightly reduced tissue factor expression, but did not alter von Willebrand factor release in activated HUVECs. 6-MSITC modulated the generation of activated protein C, which is essential for negative regulation of blood coagulation, on normal ECs. In addition, 6-MSITC reduced tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±)-induced interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression. 6-MSITC markedly attenuated TNF-Î±-induced adhesion of human monoblast U937 cells to HUVECs and reduced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin mRNA expression in activated ECs. These results showed that 6-MSITC modulates EC function and suppresses cell adhesion. This study provides new insight into the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of 6-MSITC, suggesting that 6-MSITC has therapeutic potential as a treatment for vasculitis and vascular inflammation.\n\nPath integral pricing of Wasabi option in the Black-Scholes model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCassagnes, Aurelien; Chen, Yu; Ohashi, Hirotada\n\n2014-11-01\n\nIn this paper, using path integral techniques, we derive a formula for a propagator arising in the study of occupation time derivatives. Using this result we derive a fair price for the case of the cumulative Parisian option. After confirming the validity of the derived result using Monte Carlo simulation, a new type of heavily path dependent derivative product is investigated. We derive an approximation for our so-called Wasabi option fair price and check the accuracy of our result with a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nIdentification of 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate as an apoptosis-inducing component in wasabi.\n\nPubMed\n\nWatanabe, Makoto; Ohata, Masahiko; Hayakawa, Sumio; Isemura, Mamoru; Kumazawa, Shigenori; Nakayama, Tsutomu; Furugori, Michiyo; Kinae, Naohide\n\n2003-03-01\n\nThe ethanol extract from Japanese horseradish wasabi was found to inhibit cell proliferation in human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells by inducing apoptotic cell death. Separation by methods including silica gel chromatography and preparative HPLC gave an active compound, which was identified as 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC). Several lines of evidence indicated that 6-HITC induced apoptosis in U937 cells and human stomach cancer MKN45 cells. Thus, 6-HITC is potentially useful as a natural anti-cancer agent.\n\nThe Trk Potassium Transporter Is Required for RsmB-Mediated Activation of Virulence in the Phytopathogen Pectobacterium wasabiae\n\nPubMed Central\n\nValente, Rita S.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Pectobacterium wasabiae (previously known as Erwinia carotovora) is an important plant pathogen that regulates the production of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes through an N-acyl homoserine lactone-based quorum sensing system and through the GacS/GacA two-component system (also known as ExpS/ExpA). At high cell density, activation of GacS/GacA induces the expression of RsmB, a noncoding RNA that is essential for the activation of virulence in this bacterium. A genetic screen to identify regulators of RsmB revealed that mutants defective in components of a putative Trk potassium transporter (trkH and trkA) had decreased rsmB expression. Further analysis of these mutants sho"
