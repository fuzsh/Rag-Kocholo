Total length of workers 4.5 - 6 mm. Body color greyish black or brownish black. The most dully colored of Japanese Serviformica species. Very similar to Formica hayashi (Japanese name: Hayashi-kuroyama-ari), but distinguished by the usual presence of 10 or more erect setae on the second gastral tergite (the average 13), and by the dorsum of the first gastral tergite usually bearing a few erect setae (averaging 4, but lacking in some cases).

Common in lowlands and open mountainous regions all over Japan. This species nests in the soil. Its nests open directly at the ground surface and are nearly vertical, with a depth of 1 - 2 m. The number of workers in a colony may reach 16,000 (Kondoh, 1968a; Yamauchi & Suzuki, 1987). Sexual alates fly during early June to mid July in Tokyo (Kawai, 1942) and from August to September in Kochi (Okamoto, 1957). Pseudogynes are found in some colonies (Sonobe, 1974). Known inquilines are a histerid beetle, Hetaerius gratus Lewis (Kubota, 1965) and a short-winged mold beetle, Kigatrodes gracilis (Sharp) (Sawada, 1974). Chromosome number 2n=54 (Imai & Yosida, 1964). There are three larval instars in the males (Imai, 1965).
