Abstract

To make a series of bioeconomic studies of the ant species, Formica japonica MOTSCHULSKY, many nests were excavated from 1961 to 1965 in Tokyo, Odawara and Yokohama, Japan. This is the first report of the series describing the nest structure and seasonal change of the colony members. The gallery of the nest extends to the depth of 3m, where the soil is very hard and has fine clefts containing much capillary water. In winter the net-work of the galleries and chambers near the soil surface are plugged by the deposition of soil. Ants creep down to the deeper portions, and make themselves to still masses. Hibernating ant workers are corpulent by developed fat body, but have little crop sap. No brood is seen in winter. In summer workers at upper portions forage out to the ground surface and those in lower portions stay in the nest. The first batch of brood become reproductive castes and the later batch grows into workers. These phenomena are described in detail.
