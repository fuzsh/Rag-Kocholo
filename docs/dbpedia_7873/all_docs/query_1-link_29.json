        "text": "He was an odd western star.\n\nWhen you see the image associated with this story, I know what you are thinking. “There’s a cowboy.’ Well, maybe not. While Yul Brenner may not look like the typical western star, that’s what I remember him as. While others may think of him as the king, in “The King and I” that’s not how I remember him. Possibly because I never saw the play or movie.\n\nI had read a little bit about Yul before writing the piece but didn’t know a whole lot about him. I did know he was enormously talented and had an ego to match. So, with that foundation, here are some things you didn’t know about Yul Brenner.\n\n1: Yul reportedly spoke 11 languages.\n\nIncluded were Gibberish, Bull, Jive, and Pig Latin. Wait, being told that’s not true. Well, I've been accused of being fluent in Bull myself.\n\n2: He was the visual inspiration for Prof. Charles Xavier of X-Men fame.\n\nPatrick Stewart now carries the “Bald is beautiful \"mantle."
