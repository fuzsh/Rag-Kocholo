        "text": "The history: Starting with his most famous role—King Mongkut of Siam in The King and I, on Broadway and in the film—Yul Brynner cut a majestic figure: handsome and irresistible, with a fascinating (if occasionally apocryphal) backstory. (Born in Russia and raised in China and Paris, Brynner liked to claim he was the son of a Mongolian prince and a gypsy.) The sophistication and commitment to craft that earned him two Tony awards and an Oscar also defined his behind-the-scenes life. “He was a man of great style, and he liked beautifully made things,” says his daughter Victoria Brynner. He treasured comfort backstage, which isn’t surprising given how much time he spent there; Brynner played King Mongkut 4,625 times. And the actor never settled into a dressing room without his custom-made leather director’s chair.\n\nThe news: For the launch of her lifestyle brand, Stage Eleven Seven, Victoria has created a version of her father’s chair, handmade in quilted Italian leather, maple, and brass, and available exclusively at Moda Operandi in two versions, tall ($6,400) and low ($4,800). Dad would approve.\n\nSTAGE ELEVEN SEVEN THE YUL DIRECTOR’S CHAIR (TALL $6,400, LOW $4,800), MODAOPERANDI.COM\n\nThis story appears in the September 2021 issue of Town & Country."
