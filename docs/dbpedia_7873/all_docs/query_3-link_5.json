Brynner moved to America in 1940 and gave the first of 4,625 performances (over the course of many revivals) as the King of Siam in the hit Broadway musical \"The King & I\" in 1951. Brynner recreated the role for the 1956 screen version, winning an Oscar as Best Actor, and subsequently began a successful starring career in films. Trading on his handsome looks and somewhat imperial manner, Brynner played a succession of royals, secret agents and gunslingers, notably in \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960) and \"Westworld\" (1973).\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n93% Anastasia\n\n93% The King and I\n\n89% The Magnificent Seven\n\n89% Testament of Orpheus\n\n84% Westworld\n\n84% The Ten Commandments\n\n75% Morituri\n\n60% The Sound and the Fury\n\nPhotos\n\nVILLA RIDES, Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa, 1968 VILLA RIDES, from left: diana Lorys, Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa, 1968 CAST A GIANT SHADOW, Yul Brynner, 1966 CAST A GIANT SHADOW, Yul Brynner, Kirk Douglas, Stathis Giallelis, 1966 KINGS OF THE SUN, from left: Yul Brynner, George Chakiris, 1963 THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, Steve McQueen, Yul Brynner, 1960 THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, Yul Brynner, 1960 SOLOMON AND SHEBA, Yul Brynner, 1959 SOLOMON AND SHEBA, Marisa Pavan, Yul Brynner, 1959 ADIOS SABATA, Yul Brynner, 1971 ANASTASIA, Ingrid Bergman, Yul Brynner, 1956.
