        "text": "Yul Brynner was an actor most famous for playing King Mongkut of Siam in “The King and I”. However, he was quite versatile and played figures from history (pirate Jean Lafitte), literature (Dostoevsky, Gogol, Tennessee Williams) as well as the Bible (Solomon, pharaoh).\n\nWhen westerns became the rage in the 1960s, he played gunslingers, usually Creole because of his exotic looks and accent. His bald head and an intense piercing gaze were his trademarks.\n\nDespite various tall tales told about his nationality and birthplace, Brynner was actually born on July 11, 1920 in Vladivostok, Russia. His mother migrated to Paris France in 1934. Yul learned gypsy guitar and worked in a well-known circus as a trapeze artist until he was hurt in a serious accident.\n\nAt age 21, Brynner migrated to the United States to study acting. He found work on the Broadway stage, on TV and in film in the 1940s. Actress Mary Martin recommended him for the role of the King in Richard Rodgers’ and Oscar Hammerstein II’s musical “The King and I”. Brynner became an immediate sensation in the role, repeating it for film (The King and I (1956)) and winning the Oscar for Best Actor.\n\nYul Brynner turns up on Jeopardy! fairly frequently. the last time was in 2021 in the BALD IS BEAUTIFUL category and his clues usually have something to do with “The King and I” or his bald head.
