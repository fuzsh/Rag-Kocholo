        "text": "Two Leica MPs owned and used by Hollywood actor Yul Brynner sold for more than twice their estimate at the 43rd Leitz Photographica Auction in Vienna, Austria on Saturday (25 November).\n\nThe two cameras – original MPs from the 1950s with consecutive serial numbers – were often used by Brynner to take pictures on the set of films such as ‘The King and I’.\n\nThe Leicas were expected to sell for between €600,000 and €700,000 but both ended up selling well over the €1m mark.\n\nLeica MP No 59 sold for €1.44m while No 60 sold for €1.32m.\n\nThe two Leicas were hailed as the highlight of the sale, but the lots included several more lots which sold well above estimates.\n\nA Leica M3 prototype – serial number 0025 – sold for €288,000. It was expected to fetch between €200,000 and €240,000. The camera was built in 1953 but still used the M39 lens mount, perhaps because the M-bayonet mount was still being developed.\n\nA black-painted Leica M3 “first batch” from 1957 sold for €120,000, twice the expected estimate of €60,000.\n\nThe sale also included a raft of notable Soviet cameras and lenses.\n\nA rare Soviet FAS-1 “Space Leningrad” rangefinder camera built for the Soyuz space programme in the 1960s ended up selling for €96,000 much higher than the estimate of €60,000 to €70,000.\n\nA set of three prototype M39-mount lenses from GOI (Gosudarstvennyi opticheskii institute or State Optical Institute) constructed in the 1940s sold for €84,000. The lenses set featured prototypes of the Orion 28/5.6 wide-angle lens, the famed Jupiter-3 50/1.5 standard lens and Teleobjetiv 135/5.5 telephoto lens, all in original wooden boxes.\n\nA black-painted example of the first series of FED-1 Leica copies from 1934 sold for €66,000 – more than three times the expected amount.\n\nA rare grey-painted Sport SLR built by GOI in the 1930s with a prototype 52/2.5 lens sold for €26,400, well above the estimate.\n\nAn FS-2 Fotosniper outfit built during WWII for the Soviet military complete with a modified FED rangefinder sold for €18,000 – three times the estimate.\n\nA rare Kiev IIIA outfit, complete with a full set of lenses, finders, cassettes and filters in a leather carrying case sold for €10,800, more than three times the estimate. The set, from 1957, was only offered to high-ranking Soviet officials and never offered for general sale.\n\n(For a full run-down of the lots, see the auction’s catalogue.)\n\nUkrainian photo historian Ivan Zotikov visited the public viewing of the lots ahead of the auction and sent these images of the sale to Kosmo Foto:"
