        "text": "Early Life\n\nYul Brynner was born as Yuliy Borisovich Briner in 1920 in Russian most eastern port town Vladivostok. He grew up amidst the turbulent period in post-revolutionary Russia. At that time Vladivostok was part of the so-called Far Eastern Republic, an independent state that existed from 1920 until 1922t was overthrown by the Soviet Red Army making it part of the Soviet-Union.\n\nHis father, Boris Yuliyevich Briner, was a wealthy mining engineer while his mother, Marousia Dimitrievna, worked as an actress and singer. They lived a good life at the time when Yul was born, but that came to a tragic end when the Soviets confiscated all their belongings.\n\nHis multicultural background, with Swiss-German and Russian Buryat ancestry, would later help sculpt his exotic, enigmatic screen persona.\n\nWhen Brynner was 4 years old young, his father and mother separated. His father fell for Russian actress Katerina Kornakova. She was a well-known actress and worked together with Michael Chekhov at the Moscow Art Theatre. Although Yul’s father kept supporting his family financially, his mother Marousia Blagovidova decided to move to the Chinese city of Harbin in 1927 where Yul attended school. After school young Yul learned to play guitar and took singing lessons. That was his first contact with the performing arts.\n\nIn 1933 mother and sister Vera, together with 13 year old Yul moved to Paris, fearing a war between China and Japan. As his mother was from Roma background, Yul began a performing career in Paris, singing in Russian and Roma and playing his guitar. He performed in the Hermitage and several Parisian night clubs. In 1936 Yul moved to the French harbor town of Le Havre where he joined a trapeze troupe, working in circuses. A back injury caused by a fall while making an acrobatic jump made Yul taking narcotics to kill the unsustainable pains. In 1937 Yul took opium on a regular basis making him a 17-year old drug addict. To cure him off his drug addiction his family sent him to Lausanne, Switzerland where his aunt Vera Dmitrievna Blagovidova worked as a physician.\n\nIn 1938 the family moved again, back to China once more. Mother Marousia was diagnosed with leukemia and she sought the help of her ex-husband to sustain them financially, which he did. The new wife of his father, actress Katerina Kornakova, gave Yul his first acting lessons. His mentor became Michael Chekhov who practiced the acting theories taught to him by Konstantin Stanislavski, he leading theatre director of his generation.\n\nAs his mother needed more treatment for her leukemia the family decided that it was time to move again, this time to the United States where the best possible treatment for the disease was available. That decision was the ultimate step to Yul Brynner’s acting career.\n\nStart in the Entertainment Industry\n\nThe Brynner family moved to the United States in 1940, where Yul's career in entertainment began to take shape. He worked as a model and a radio announcer, and during World War II, he found work as a French-speaking radio announcer and commentator for the US Office of War Information. In those years his mentor Michael Chekhov also moved to the United States. Yul helped Chekhov out as a truck driver for his theatre company which he had set up in the States. In the meantime Chekhov kept training Yul for an acting career.\n\nYul Brynner and Marlene Dietrich\n\nIn 1941 Yul met Marlene Dietrich in the Blue Angel Club in New York where Yul had a singing act. Although Dietrich was 19 years older they became a couple. The relationship went on and off but lasted a couple of years.\n\nBrynner's first major acting role came in 1949 when he played the titular character in \"Lute Song\" opposite Mary Martin on Broadway. It was the beginning of his notable career in acting, which later transformed him into a Hollywood icon.\n\nBreakthrough and Stardom\n\nYul Brynner's groundbreaking role came when he portrayed King Mongkut of Siam in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical \"The King and I\" on Broadway in 1951. His compelling and charismatic performance was an instant hit, catapulting him to stardom. His shaved head, which became his trademark look, and his commanding voice created a magnetic screen presence.\n\nIn 1956, Brynner reprised his role as King Mongkut in the film adaptation of \"The King and I,\" which garnered him an Academy Award for Best Actor. His performance in the film cemented his position as a top star in Hollywood.\n\nEclectic Film Career\n\nBrynner’s movie career took off with an eclectic mix of roles that showcased his diverse talent. From portraying Pharaoh Rameses II in \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956) to Chris Adams in \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960), his performances always carried a distinct blend of strength and vulnerability.\n\nHe continued to delve into various genres, from drama to westerns to romantic films, always bringing a unique and powerful presence to the screen. \"Anastasia\" (1956), \"Solomon and Sheba\" (1959), and \"Westworld\" (1973) are amongst his notable films, proving his flexibility and robust persona that could traverse different characters and epochs."
