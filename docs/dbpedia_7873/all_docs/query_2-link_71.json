        "text": "Pablo Picasso is known to have famously said, “good artists copy, great artists steal” an oddly fitting quote for our remake/reboot culture. Filmmakers wear their influences on their sleeves. Edgar Wright proudly uses Sam Raimi-esque camera movements. Quentin Tarantino freely mixes and remixes genre and art house cinema. Kurosawa tried to emulate John Ford, and Sergio Leone remade Kurosawa. Sometimes, however, the result of these “artistic heists” impacts culture in wholly unexpected ways, sometimes leaving the original to be forgotten in the process. One of these cases is James Cameron and his 1984 action classic The Terminator (1984). However, eleven years before Arnold Schwarzenegger became a star playing the unstoppable killing machine, another actor put on the mantle of murderous machinery. The year was 1973, the movie was Westworld (1973) and the actor was Yul Brynner, who died 30 years today, 10 October, 2015.\n\nBorn on July 11, 1920 in what was then the Far Eastern Republic, present day Russia. As the son of an engineer and an actress/singer, Yul Brynner grew up wealthy. But when the geo-political situation and threat of war was becoming worse, his mother, his sister and he emigrated, first to Paris, then to America. Early on in his career, he would make his background more colourful, saying he was part Mongol and born as a Kahn. Other times he would claim to have fought in the Spanish Civil War. While false, these tales helped to establish Brynner’s ‘oriental’ flair as an actor, colouring in the edges of his public persona.\n\nEven though he had success as a television director in the United States, he continued acting, and eventually landed the role as the king of Siam in the stage show The King and I in 1951. Only five years later, the same role would become his breakthrough. Playing the same character in the 1956 movie version, he won an Academy Award for best actor, and The King and I (1956) followed Brynner through his entire professional life. It’s been estimated that he played the role of the King over 4000 times during his 30 year run in the show, on stage, movie screen and television.\n\nHis looks allowed Brynner to play a variety of nationalities over the course of his career. He played a Russian, Cajun, Siamese, Egyptian, American, Native American and Mexican, without ever seeming out of place. Although we would now consider this to be racially insensitive casting decisions, it was quite common in the past (see Alec Guinness in Lawrence of Arabia). His trademark looks, his shaved head and his powerful, commanding presence gave him a long career outside his breakthrough role. He played Ramses II opposite Charlton Heston’s as Moses in The Ten Commandments (1956), Ingrid Bergman’s love interest in Anastasia (1956), and the lead in the William Faulkner adaptation The Sound and Fury (1959). One of his arguably most remembered films, however, is his role in The Magnificent Seven (1960), leading an ensemble cast that includes Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and James Coburn. Playing the role originally portrayed by the legendary Japanese actor, Takashi Shimura in Seven Samurai (1954), Brynner left his mark on the Western.\n\nThis brings us back to Westworld. The movie, a story about a futuristic theme park filled with malfunctioning robots, was Brynner’s penultimate film before retiring from acting and dying of cancer in 1985. Although slowly forgotten, Westworld (written and directed by Michael Crichton) gets overshadowed by Jurassic Park (1994), now a classic in its own right. Its 1970s science fiction elements do not play well anymore with modern audiences, but despite that, it is the first movie ever to star what we would consider now a ‘Terminator’. Yul Brynner, playing a robotic gunslinger, who, after malfunctioning, goes around killing people with superhuman abilities. And similar to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s killer robot, he comes back relentlessly several times after seemingly having been stopped.\n\nThese forgotten moments of cinema have influenced modern science fiction in many ways, just as Brynner has. Next year, HBO will release a TV-show based on Westworld. Dealing with the dawn of Artificial Intelligence, Ed Harris is in the shoes of the robotic cowboy. Hopefully this renewed version of the film will bring a new generation of audiences to look back and discover the importance of Yul Brynner’s career."
