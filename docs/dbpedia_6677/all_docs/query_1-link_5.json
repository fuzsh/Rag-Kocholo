A year later, three significant events occur almost simultaneously: Ralph Le Saint, a young sculptor, still in love with Peggy, plans his suicide in a mood of bitterness; Paul Lockridge, a pianist, also in love with her, returns from Paris and offers her his companionship as a diversion from her stuffy life; and Gibson's daughter, Marjorie, returns from schooling abroad. Marjorie is paired with Ralph, and their escapades result in considerable trouble for the old gentleman, while Paul implores Peggy to go to Paris with him, declaring \"You are rich--dirty rich. You are dying. You need laughter to make you clean,\" but she refuses. When Marjorie plans to elope with Ralph, Peggy exposes the sculptor as a fortune hunter, and dejected, he commits suicide. As a result, Peggy confesses her unhappiness to Gibson, then joins Paul and laughter in Paris.",
