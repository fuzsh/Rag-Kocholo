        "text": "The latest reels of Dartmouth movies were first shown before the alumni group at the annual Christmas vacation luncheon of the Cleveland Club, December 30. Following this premiere the films were shown successively at Rockford, Portland, Me., Worcester, New York, and Waterbury. A public showing of the movies, which were produced by the Dartmouth Secretaries Association with the cooperation of The Players, and directed by Prof. Warner Bentley and S. C. Hayward '26, was given in Hanover, January 12.\n\nThe day following this show Dean Laycock left on his trip to Mid-Western and Southern alumni clubs, carrying the films with him. The schedule of shows for the month follows: Jan. 30, Albany; Jan. 31, Syracuse; Feb. 2, Buffalo; Feb. 7, Detroit; Feb. 9, Chicago; Feb. 12, Milwaukee; Feb. 16, Tulsa; Feb. 19, Pittsburgh; Feb. 21, Harrisburg; Feb. 23, Philadelphia; Feb. 26, Atlanta; Feb. 28, Washington, D. C.\n\nA duplicate set of the latest news reels was sent to the West Coast last month where they were shown at Los Angeles, Jan. 19; at San Francisco, Jan. 22; and at Seattle, Jan. 26. The balance of this Western movie schedule is: Feb. 2, Omaha, and Feb. 5, Grand Rapids."
