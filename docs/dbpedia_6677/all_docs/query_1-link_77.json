        "text": "Are you looking for different types of humor to add a little wow! to your writing?\n\nDo you need some pizazz for your prose?\n\nHumor can be a great strategy to grab and hook your reader’s attention while adding a little flair to your writing project.\n\nIt also builds camaraderie between groups of people, bridges cultural differences, and adds laughter to difficult circumstances.\n\nPlus, it’s just fun when you can laugh at the comedy of everyday life.\n\nSo, we’re going to show you different humor styles and examples you can add to your work to spice up your writing.\n\nHere’s what you need to know…\n\nWhat is Humor?\n\nHumor, or humour if you’re across the pond, is any form of communication intended to evoke laughter and provide amusement. The message may be delivered through various literary devices like irony, tragicomedy, or through other kinds of verbal or nonverbal actions.\n\nHumor is one of the most important tools writers have in their arsenal, as it adds flavor and zest to any writing project. The humor styles that are used depend on the writer’s voice, target audience, and genre.\n\n26 Types of Humor (+28 Hilarious Examples)\n\nHumor comes in many varieties and is very subjective. What one person finds wildly funny, another finds offensive or inappropriate.\n\nHere are 26 types of humor you can use in any writing situation.\n\n1. Physical (or Slapstick Humor)\n\nPhysical humor relates to scenarios or characters who use exaggerated effects for maximum impact. Think absurd body movements, exaggerated crying or laughter, and mock bodily harm.\n\nAnd let’s not forget all the boinks, bonks, boops, and other onomatopoeia examples that characterize slapstick comedy.\n\nWant an example?\n\nThen look no further than the Three Stooges, the undisputed sultans of slapstick humor:\n\n2. Deadpan (or Dry Humor)\n\nDeadpan or dry humor is delivered with a straight face and a neutral tone.\n\nSome people find dry humor more enjoyable than the usual jokes and comedy routines because dry humor often requires more thought and perception.\n\nThe Office’s Michael Scott, portrayed by Steve Carell, is a master of deadpan humor. One of my favorites is his thoughts about Wikipedia:\n\n3. Wordplay Humor (or Puns)\n\nWordplay humor relies on the dual meanings of words and phrases to create a humorous effect.\n\nSome examples of wordplay are double entendres, puns, cheeky metaphors, and pickup lines.\n\nAre you ready for an example? Try not to roll your eyes too hard.\n\n“Are you a parking ticket? ‘Cause you’ve got fine written all over you.”\n\n4. Toilet Humor\n\nAlso called body bathroom, toilet humor provides an easy subject for jokes. Fart jokes in particular are a favorite of young boys.\n\nThe children’s book series Captain Underpants uses a lot of toilet humor to entertain its target audience.\n\nCheck out the “Fart Song” here:\n\n5. Witty Humor\n\nWitty humor is often dry and clever and relies on the intellectual engagement of the listener or reader.\n\nA famous example of wit involves Winston Churchill. As the story goes, Churchill crossed paths with a woman one night at a dinner party.\n\nBeing of different political affiliations, and no love lost between them, the woman haughtily tells Churchill he is “disgustingly drunk.” Without missing a beat, Churchill responds:\n\n“My dear, you are ugly, and what’s more, you are disgustingly ugly. But tomorrow I shall be sober and you will still be disgustingly ugly.”\n\n6. Satirical Humor\n\nSatire is a type of humor that pokes fun at human vices and flaws. It typically isn’t laugh-out-loud funny but reflects more of a dry wit. Users often use satirical humor to draw attention to current events or political issues.\n\nDuring an interview with The Paris Review, writer Dorothy Parker once said, “I hate almost all rich people, but I think I’d be darling at it.”\n\n7. Dark Humor\n\nDark humor can be defined as any joke that makes light of a tragic event or subject matter.\n\nIt’s often used as a coping mechanism.\n\nSome people believe the idea of finding comedy in pain and sadness to be cathartic, while others are put off by what they see as a cheap way of getting laughs.\n\nWhen former President Ronald Reagan was shot on March 30, 1981, he said to the surgeons in the operating room, “Please tell me you’re Republicans.”\n\nHe also told his daughter Maureen, the attempted assassination “ruined one of my best suits.”\n\n8. Cringe Humor\n\nWe have all experienced cringe moments in our lives, which is why this type of humor works so well in storytelling.\n\nCringe humor always occurs in social situations and involves moments like tripping in front of an audience or sending your boss a racy text meant for your spouse.\n\nBen Stiller had many cringe humor moments in the hit movie, Meet The Fockers. This dinner scene is an excellent example of the writers using cringe humor during a meal with the future in-laws:\n\n9. Ironic Humor\n\nIronic humor relies on a sharp contrast between the actual meaning and what is being said.\n\nA real-life example of ironic humor is Emerson Moser. The former senior crayon maker for Crayola who made over 1.4 billion crayons, was color blind.\n\n10. Observational Humor\n\nObservational humor is comedy based on the commentary of everyday life. It can be found in both stand-up and sketch comedy and is often used to subtly criticize the world around us.\n\nTo see observational comedy in action, watch Jerry Seinfeld’s bit about the donut hole:\n\n11. Topical Humor\n\nTopical humor is related to current events or trends that are happening in the world. You often see it on late-night talk shows that use political satire to entertain their audience.\n\nShaun Eli is a stand-up comedian living in New York City who has written many monologues for late-night television shows. You can see some of his unused work, all based on topical humor, at brainchampagne.com\n\nHere’s one example of a joke he wrote in March 2020:\n\n“I used to meet women in the summer by saying ‘Hi, I have central air conditioning.’”\n\nNow it’s ‘I have two liters of Purell.’”\n\n12. Self Enhancing Humor\n\nSome people use the power of laughter to improve their happiness and well-being during difficult times.\n\nThat’s self enhancing humor. It can help you maintain perspective, reduce stress, or be a coping strategy to maintain mental health during hard times.\n\nAs Kurt Vonnegut said:\n\n“Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning up to do afterward.”\n\nAn example of self enhancing humor would be, “I may have failed the driving test, but I didn’t run anyone over.”\n\n13. Self Defeating Humor\n\nThe term self defeating literally means “to degrade oneself.” It’s often used as an icebreaker because it shows you don’t take yourself too seriously.\n\nIn response to rumors that his father was buying votes, John F. Kennedy used self defeating humor to deflect. In a speech at the 1958 Gridiron dinner, he said:\n\n“I just received the following wire from my generous daddy: ‘Dear Jack, don’t buy a single vote more than is necessary. I’ll be damned if I’m going to pay for a landslide.’”\n\n14. Highbrow Humor\n\nHighbrow humor is a humor style revolving around jokes about topics like classical literature, history, and politics. It usually requires a certain level of education or knowledge to understand.\n\nJoshua Hehe wrote an article sharing some of his favorite highbrow humor. One example is:\n\n“Do you know the name Pavlov?\n\nIt rings a bell.”\n\n15. Lowbrow Humor\n\nLowbrow humor is often crude, profane, and offensive.\n\nIt’s tempting to think that lowbrow humor is just for people with no talent or intelligence.\n\nHowever, it actually requires a lot of creativity and wit to write jokes that are offensive or tasteless but still funny. That’s why even some of the best comedians will use lowbrow humor in their acts from time to time.\n\nMovies like American Pie or Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back are full of lowbrow humor.\n\nYou can also find examples in sitcoms like It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia.\n\n16. Surreal (or Absurd Humor)\n\nSurreal humor contains elements of surrealism, absurdity, or non sequitur. The humor comes from replacing logic with illogical thoughts, leading to jokes which are humorous because they are either ridiculous or unexpected.\n\nAn example of surreal humor is this old joke:\n\n“Why did the elephant sit on the marshmallow?\n\nHe didn’t want to fall into the cup of hot chocolate.”\n\n17. One-Liner Humor\n\nOne-liner humor is wit that is short, concise, and just one sentence or phrase.\n\nIt’s all about having the perfect setup so you can deliver the powerful words in the punchline with maximum impact.\n\nWant an example of a one-liner?\n\n“Evening news is where they begin with ‘Good evening’, and then proceed to tell you why it isn’t.”\n\n18. Anecdotal Humor\n\nAnecdotal humor recalls an event from the past. This event is usually light-hearted and humorous. Anecdotal humor can communicate a message, emphasize a point, or entertain people with an interesting story.\n\nIn My Best Friend’s Wedding, Julianne (Julia Roberts) tells an anecdote during a wedding toast about having a dream where “a psycho” was trying to break up the bride and groom.\n\nTo the wedding guests, the story sounded like a harmless and amusing anecdote, but it really conveyed an apology from Julianne to the groom for her role in trying to split up the happy couple.\n\n19. Hyperbolic Humor\n\nHyperbolic humor is a technique that exaggerates a person’s emotional state in a humorous way.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was a master of hyperbolic humor.\n\nFor example, in Much Ado About Nothing, Beatrice tells Benedick, ”…I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.”\n\nThis is her way of showing how little she thinks of love.\n\n20. Burlesque Humor\n\nThe word burlesque comes from the Italian word burlesco, meaning to ridicule.\n\nBurlesque humor is satirical and relies on exaggeration for its comic effect. It’s usually characterized by a parody of serious subjects and often borders on being offensive.\n\nThe 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a burlesque adaptation of Homer’s Odysseus. The hero on a quest meets exaggerated characters and over-the-top obstacles.\n\nCheck out a clip here:\n\n21. Farcical Humor\n\nA farce is a type of comedy where the plot includes improbable coincidences and heavy exaggeration. And the dialogue is often ridiculous.\n\nThe entire story is so outlandishly absurd, audiences can’t help but laugh at it.\n\nNational Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation is a movie filled with farcical humor and the squirrel scene might be the best.\n\n22. Epigrammatic Humor\n\nEpigrammatic humor uses paradox and irony to make satirical or thought-provoking statements. An example of epigrammatic humor would be:\n\nThe quickest way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it back in your pocket.\n\nPoor Richard’s Almanac is an excellent source of epigrammatic humor. How about this gem:\n\n“Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.”\n\n23. Parodic Humor\n\nParodic humor mocks and imitates an original work or person, typically for comic effect.\n\nCheck out Libido Killer by Penn and Kim Holderness. It’s a parody of Michael Jackson’s Thriller:\n\n24. Aggressive Humor\n\nAggressive humor is often used to bully or intimidate others by making them the butt of jokes. Perpetrators often attempt to pass off the jokes as teasing.\n\nThe Comedy Central celebrity roasts use a lot of aggressive humor.\n\n25. Affiliative Humor\n\nOn the other hand, affiliative humor is positive, light-hearted, inclusive, and helps create a sense of cohesion with others.\n\nFor example, a harmless, inside joke amongst friends, or a witty comment at a office party that breaks any tension and promotes laughter.\n\n26. Surprise & Incongruity\n\nSurprise and incongruity are two of the most important devices for achieving laughter.\n\nA surprise is an event we do not expect to happen. Its purpose is to make us react suddenly and unpredictably. Surprising things can be both good and bad, but they should always be unexpected.\n\nIncongruity is when something doesn’t belong with its surroundings or when it’s inconsistent with what we know about reality. The key word here is inconsistency. If something surprises us, it’s different from what we expect, but if something surprises us and also seems wrong, then it’s also incongruous.\n\nFor our last examples, let us turn to the hit tv sitcom, Friends. The writers always knew how to keep viewers coming back for more.\n\nThe biggest surprise might have been the season 4 finale when the writers revealed a secret hookup between Monica and Chandler:\n\nFor incongruity, Phoebe’s hit song, Smelly Cat, comes to mind. After all, as offbeat as Phoebe was, who writes a song about a smelly cat?\n\nAre You Ready to Experiment With Different Types of Humor?\n\nHumor will lead to a whole new dimension in your writing.\n\nEven if you’ve never used humor before, with our list of the different types of humor and the examples we included, you’re ready to add some comedy to your writing repertoire.\n\nNow it’s time to put your newfound knowledge into action.\n\nFor the next piece of prose you write, or blog post you publish, try adding a bit of satire or situational comedy to it and see where it takes you.\n\nWhich style of humor will you try first?"
