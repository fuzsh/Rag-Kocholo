        "text": "Written by Writer’s Corps member Carrie Manner\n\nPeople joke about “google stalking” their potential partners all the time but stalking is no laughing matter. Stalking is a pattern of behavior that makes you feel nervous and susceptible to attack. Each scenario with a stalker may differ (from repeated contact to unwanted gifts), but the goal remains the same, to make you feel vulnerable.\n\nStalking affects 6.6 million people in the U.S. each year and 3 out of 10 of those people report experiencing emotional and psychological harm as a result. In 1999, the Stalking Resource Center published a handbook about stalking with fascinating facts that uncover what motivates someone to harass another person. The following information was gathered from that handbook to provide a captivating glance into the mind of a stalker.\n\nWhat Motivates a Stalker\n\nStalkers may begin their harassment by repeatedly calling or contacting their target via email and social media but it doesn’t always end there. If these methods of contact are ineffective “the individual may escalate to more intrusive behaviors such as spying on, and unexpectedly confronting their victims,” said Robert T. Muller in his article, Mind of a Stalker. In many cases, stalking begins at the end of a relationship, however, there is no perfect science to determine who will or won’t become a stalker. But, thanks to researchers we now know motivating factors that drive some people to stalk. These factors include:\n\nRejection\n\nWhether the rejection is real or merely perceived by the stalker it comes as a critical blow. Stalkers see themselves as the victims of being led on or toyed with. Their fear of abandonment doesn’t allow them to reason, so it’s impossible to let them down easy.\n\nObsession\n\nStalkers are often obsessive in multiple areas of their life including their romantic inclinations. They usually have repetitive thought patterns that play like a broken record, so they gradually become so preoccupied with their target, they’re unable to sleep, forget to eat, and let their jobs go to the wayside.\n\nFantasy\n\nStalkers blur the lines between fact and fiction. They harbor a sense of entitlement that their targets belong to them which feeds the fantasy that they’re destined to be together. Some become so convinced, they’ll invent details in their head about a romantic relationship that doesn’t exist, and they’ll be so sure of it, they’re able to convince others.\n\nNarcissism\n\nStalkers are unable to recognize or respect the feelings or boundaries of others. They also lack healthy coping skills to deal with rejection, embarrassment, shame, or loss. This becomes especially problematic if you previously had a romantic relationship as they may justify their actions with “If I’m suffering, so should you” logic or the “If I can’t have you, no one can.”\n\nHow Stalkers Use Manipulation to Feed Their Obsession\n\nManipulation is one of a stalker’s greatest tool, particularity with an ex. Below are some common ways a stalker will try to lure you back in.\n\nThey’ll guilt you or invent emergencies to elicit sympathy. Example: “Why are you doing this to me? Don’t you care about me?”\n\nThey make empty promises to prolong contact. Example: “This is the last time, I swear. I just need closure.”\n\nThey’ll resort to blackmail, no matter how far of a stretch. Example: “I’ll tell your boss about the time you called in sick.”\n\nThey play on your insecurities and make unfounded accusations. Example: “You don’t care about anyone but yourself.”\n\nThey’ll twist your words to suit their agenda. Example: “I know that you really do love me and that your friends are just trying to brainwash you against me.”\n\nThey’ll give expensive or elaborate gifts with strings attached. Example: “After all I’ve done for you…”\n\nCommon Characteristics of a\n\nStalker\n\nIt’s important to note that stalkers aren’t monsters that hide under your bed. In fact, there are no rules on how to spot a one. Common misconceptions about stalkers include ideas about stalkers being lonely, socially awkward and generally undesirable people. But experts say that many stalkers are charming and seemingly “average” people that you would never guess have an unhealthy obsession with their ex, their neighbor or a complete stranger. That said, there are certain characteristics that many stalkers share and are important to know. Taken directly from the stalking handbook, below is an interesting list of personality traits that most stalkers possess. If you noticed these traits in someone pursuing a relationship with you, you might want to think twice.\n\nJealousy\n\nNarcissistic\n\nObsessive and compulsive\n\nFalls “instantly” in love (Intensity)\n\nManipulative\n\nDoes not take responsibility for their own feelings or actions\n\nNeeds to have control over others\n\nSocially awkward or uncomfortable\n\nViews self as victim of society, family, and others\n\nUnable to take “no” for an answer\n\nDeceptive\n\nOften switches between rage and “love”\n\nDifficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality\n\nSense of entitlement (“You owe me…”)\n\nUnable to cope with rejection\n\nDependent on others for sense of “self”\n\nViews his or her problems as someone else’s fault\n\nSo What Can You Do?\n\nIf someone makes you feel uncomfortable or afraid, that’s your gut sending up the bat signal that something is wrong. Trust it. Sometimes we sense something’s wrong before we can see proof. Dealing with a stalker can be uncomfortable, but there are ways to protect yourself early on:\n\nBe firm and let the person making you uncomfortable know you’re unwilling to continue contact. Do this at the first sign of intrusive behavior and stick to it. Once you say no to contact, you must quit responding to avoid encouraging them.\n\nDon’t worry if you’re hurting their feelings when you end contact since it was their unwelcome behavior that created this situation. You’re simply setting boundaries to keep yourself safe.\n\nBe mindful of what kind of personal information you’re posting online and what you let your friends tag you in.\n\nDon’t allow apps to show your location.\n\nKeep your car and home locked.\n\nAlternate the driving routes you use. Don’t maintain a predictable pattern.\n\nDon’t say you’re going to contact the police unless you plan to do it. Not following through with what you say you will do signals to your stalker that you do not mean what you say.\n\nKeep cool, stay firm, and remain calm so you avoid feeding into your stalkers need to create an emotional response from you.\n\nAs scary as it may seem, we can put stalking to an end. The key is to be alert, educate yourself, and to find help. The earlier you do this, the more successful you’ll be. Never forget: no one can take your power away from you. So hold onto to it, and remember you’re in control.
