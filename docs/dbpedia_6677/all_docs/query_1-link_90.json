        "text": "Visitors to the Greenwich Village gay bar Pieces can look forward to strong drinks and loud drag shows, but what they might not expect — what there simply isn’t a section for on Yelp — is the sight of Jennifer Lawrence, the most famous actress of her generation, tackling a friend to the ground after losing a very important game of musical shots. Oh, and the friend happens to be Adele.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Lawrence didn’t expect any of that to happen at Pieces, either. It all went down in March 2019, not long after she had begun dating her now-husband, the art dealer Cooke Maroney, and just a few months into Lawrence’s still-ongoing project of trying to move through the world like a normal human being again. At the white-hot height of her fame fronting the “Hunger Games” franchise, any night out in public would have required security guards, but Maroney often asked to meet Lawrence at dive bars, and she wasn’t about to spoil those places by showing up with two hulking bodyguards.\n\nWhat she found, to her pleasant surprise, is that the world allowed her to re-enter it without being too weird. That was the lesson she tried to impart to Adele when the British singer texted Lawrence suggesting they go to a concert, the sort of place where they’d be ensconced in a VIP section away from the rowdy masses. Lawrence countered that she was already drinking at Pieces, where Adele should come meet her.\n\nAdele texted back with one question: Are there people there?\n\nYes, Lawrence replied. There’s people everywhere. And that was kind of the point: To be in New York without ever finding yourself in a crowd wasn’t really like being in New York at all. And to make spontaneous plans to go drink somewhere unexpected — well, that was even better.\n\nSo Adele came. And sure, the two of them were recognized, and yes, people pulled out their phones to take pictures, but nobody was a jerk about it, the mood remained lively, and Adele even competed in an onstage drinking game (though her defeat caused the competitive Lawrence to bellow, “How could you lose?” and prompted that tackle). Then they sang karaoke, and Lawrence learned that casual pastime is a little more loaded when you’re doing it opposite one of the greatest singers on the planet.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
