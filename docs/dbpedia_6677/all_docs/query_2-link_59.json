        "text": "Censorship document enforced a moral code on American films through the 1960s.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn July, 1934, Hollywood bowed to public pressure and announced it would self-censor itself with the Hays Code.\n\nReligious and conservative groups had long protested that Hollywood films had been playing up sex and violence to gain a bigger audience. The Hays Code had been devised in 1930 to tone things down, but wasn’t enforced for four years, until the clamour for some form of censorship got too loud for Hollywood to ignore.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nThe code was named after Will H. Hays, who was the president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America. But the actual censor was Joseph Breen, who viewed films and then made suggestions to cut or rewrite offensive bits.\n\nThe preamble for the code stated, “No picture shall be produced which will lower the moral standards of those who see it. Hence the sympathy of the audience shall never be thrown to the side of crime, wrong-doing, evil or sin.”\n\nSyndicated columnist Dan Thomas agreed with the censors. On July 28, 1934, The Vancouver Sun ran the first instalment of a six-part series by Thomas titled, “What’s Wrong with the Movies?”\n\n“The movie industry, like a little boy caught using a dirty word, is getting its mouth scrubbed with soap and water,” Thomas began. “It doesn’t like the taste of soap, but it is submitting to the scrubbing, because it knows that old Ma Public is the boss, after all.\n\n“The flood of salacious, flippant, sexy, dirt-for-dirt’s-sake pictures that has poured out of Hollywood during the past few years shows signs of drying up.”\n\nThe crusade to clean up Hollywood had been led by a group called The League of Decency. It approved of “clean pictures,” but tut-tutted the storylines of others.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Love affairs outside matrimony and triangles, divorces and callous cheating within (marriage) — that has been the regular movie fare, along with sexy films in which sex is simply thrown in for no reason at all, and ‘musical’ films which have vied with one another to see which could present beautiful young girls with the scantiest clothes,” wrote Thomas.\n\n“Then, too, there have been films about doctors which give the impression that medical practice is a mere accident in hospitals. Capable actresses cast and recast in successive roles as wanton women, flippant divorcees or plain street-walkers, until the public has associated their very names with abandonment.\n\n“Dialogue from the gutter. Utter disregard for the possible social effects of their products, all under the principle, ‘We’re giving the public what they want.’”\n\nThomas goes on to name names. James Cagney and Joan Blondell were signalled out for the movie He Was Her Man, “in which Joan portrays a streetwalker who spends the night with Cagney before leaving for another town to marry Victor Jory, a poor fisherman who has promised to forgive her past.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMargaret Sullavan’s launched her career with the hit 1933 film Only Yesterday. But Thomas disapproved of the plot, where Sullavan falls in love with a soldier. “They love too passionately,” he’s sent off to the First World War, and she bears his child out of wedlock.\n\nThe second instalment of Thomas’s personal moral crusade dealt with actresses “consistently cast in degrading roles.”\n\n“Mae West, Norma Shearer, Jean Harlow, Constance Bennett and Carole Lombard are finding the cards pretty well stacked against them as a result of the characters they have portrayed during the last couple of years,” Thomas wrote.\n\nWest’s stardom was impacted by the Hays code — her biggest movies preceded it. A 1934 West movie filmed as It Ain’t No Sin was changed to St. Louis Woman and then retitled Belle of the Nineties. But it a wasn’t a hit like her risqué 1933 movies I’m No Angel and She Done Him Wrong.\n\nThe Hays Code remained in force for decades, even after the U.S. Supreme Court found it violated the right to free speech in 1952. But the times changed, and it was finally dropped in 1968.\n\nStill, there were many movies that got around the censorship with imaginative scripts or cinematography.\n\n“(The Code) had a very good effect because it made us think,” said director Edward Dmytryk.\n\n“If we wanted to get something across that was censorable … we had to do it deviously. We had to be clever. And it usually turned out to be much better than if we had done it straight.”\n\njmackie@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
