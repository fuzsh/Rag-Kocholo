        "text": "We love short films for their unique ability to provide a glimpse into a much larger world, story or concept. With nothing to lose, short filmmakers are willing to take chances in voice and style. Their films are usually more experimental, more creative, with messages that are more liberated. In keeping with our past shorts programs, we continue to defy genre and categorization, rather finding the threads that weave common stories of the human experience together to create spellbinding experiences for you the viewer to behold.\n\nEID MUBARAK\n\nUnited States, Live Action\n\nDir. Mahnoor Euceph, 2022, 15 min\n\nIn Urdu with English subtitles\n\nIt’s a beautiful candy-colored world, but nothing could be further from this Pakistani girl’s mind as she embarks on a crafty mission to save her beloved pet goat from being eaten on the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Ahza.\n\nTHE DANCE\n\nColombia, Live Action\n\nDir. Pedro Pablo Vega Reyes, 2021, 15 min\n\nIn Spanish with English subtitles\n\nAndrés has a big, big toe problem: his right shoe has a huge hole in it. Normally, that wouldn’t be an issue, but the school dance is tomorrow and he’s got his crush Mariana to impress!\n\nGUGU NAGOGO\n\nAustralia, Live Action\n\nDir. Taku Mbduzi, 2022, 20 min\n\nIn English and Shona with English subtitles\n\nWhen a lunar eclipse stops her late-night letter exchanges, 12-year-old astronomer Gugu must find a way to reconnect with her beloved Gogo (grandmother) who lives far away in Zimbabwe.\n\nFamily dynamics are full of twists and turns, just like our lineup of films that blend heartwarming moments with stories of great resilience. From a trio of balding brothers on a quest for hair to a young Ojibwe photographer keeping a sacred fire alive for his father in the afterlife, these stories offer a glimpse into the complexities of our most intimate relationships where love and loss inevitably intersect.
