        "text": "This week on \"Film Friday\" I am celebrating William Powell's 124th birthday by telling you a little bit about what is arguably his most iconic picture. Incidentally, this was the first William Powell film I ever saw and it remains my personal favorite.\n\nTheatrical release poster\n\nDirected by W. S. Dyke, The Thin Man (1934) begins when Dorothy Wynant (Maureen O'Sullivan) announces to her inventor father, Clyde (Edward Ellis), her plans to marry Tommy (Henry Wadsworth). Shortly afterwards, Wynant goes on a secret business trip, but promises to be back in time for Dorothy's wedding. As the day approaches and Wynant fails to return, Dorothy worries, while her mother Mimi (Minna Gombell) is frantic that her ex-husband is unavailable to give her and her new spouse, Chris Jorgenson (Cesar Romero), more money. When Mimi visits Wynant's mistress, Julia Wolf (Natalie Moorehard), to ask for money, she finds only her dead body. Evidence points to Wynant as the prime suspect in the crime, but Dorothy refuses to believe that her father is guilty.\n\nMeanwhile, sophisticated,retired detective Nick Charles (William Powell) and his wealthy, understanding wife Nora (Myrna Loy) have come to New York for the Christmas holidays. In the hotel bar, Nick becomes reacquainted with Dorothy, whose father is an old friend of his. Despite Nick's protests that he is no longer a detective, Dorothy persuades him into investigating Wynant's mysterious disappearance, much to Nora's amusement. One evening, Nick and Asta (Skippy), the Charles's terrier, discover the skeletonized body of a \"fat man\" in Wynant's laboratory. Police Lieutenant John Guild (Nat Pendleton) suspects that Wynant has committed another murder, but Nick soon realizes that the body actually belongs to a \"thin man\" — Wynant — because of a trace of shrapnel found in the leg. Nick and Nora then decide host a dinner party so they can invite all of the suspects as guests and finally uncover the real killer. There, Nick exposes Jorgenson as a bigamist, thus making Mimi realize that she will now be free to inherit Wynant's money. At that point, Mimi incriminates Herbert MacCaulay (Porter Hall), Wynant's lawyer, who had been embezzling from his client with Julia's compliance. Mimi had been aiding MacCaulay in exchange for money. With the real murderer apprehended, Nick and Nora, along with newlyweds Dorothy and Tommy, happily take a train bound to California.\n\nNora Charles: Oh, Nicky, I love you because you know such lovely people.\n\nThe son of a Superior Court judge and a stage actress, W. S. Van Dyke started out as a child actor in a variety of roles in vaudeville and travelling stock companies. In 1909, at the age of 20, he married actress Zelda Ashford and the two then joined various theatre companies, before arriving in Hollywood in 1915. Through a chance meeting, he was offered a job as an assistant director to D. W. Griffith on the epics The Birth of a Nation (1915) and Intolerance (1916), although he remained uncredited. At Essanay Studios, Van Dyke got the chance to helm his first feature, The Land of Long Shadows (1917), which led to work directing serials for Pathé. In 1926, Van Dyke was signed by Irving Thalberg of MGM, where he established his reputation for ruthlessness and efficiency by rescuing the faltering production of White Shadows in the South Seas (1928) from director Robert Flaherty. When the film became a critical and commercial success, Van Dyke was assigned to several high-quality pictures, including The Pagan (1929), Trader Horn (1931), Tarzan the Ape Man (1932) and Manhattan Melodrama (1934).\n\nVan Dyke had always been a fan of detective novels and was convinced that \"a murder mystery could be turned into laughable entertainment.\" As such, he brought Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man to the attention of Sam Marx, head of MGM's story department, who purchased the rights for $22,000. Originally published in the December 1933 issue of Redbook magazine, The Thin Man related the story of a murder investigation by the famous detective Nick Charles, who was accompanied by his loving wife Nora and their dog Asta. When it was issued in book form by Alfred Knopf in January 1934, The Thin Man became an instant success, selling 20,000 copies in the first three weeks and another 10,000 during the remainder of that year. Van Dyke was very enthusiastic about making a screen adaptation of what would become Hammett's last novel (although he lived until 1961). \"While it was a good enough mystery story,\" the director later said, \"there was something else about the book that struck me. Here was something new and fresh and charming, a romance between a man and his wife. It's a story of a couple of kids who understand each other, and have a blessed confidence in each other. Beneath all the casualness and all the wise cracking, there's a lovely wholesome relationship, something really deep and spiritual and inspiring.\"\n\nMyrna Loy and William Powell\n\nHaving noticed the chemistry and light-hearted rapport between them on the set of Manhattan Melodrama, Van Dyke recommended William Powell and Myrna Loy for the leading roles of Nick and Nora Charles. Producer Hunt Stromberg agreed completely, but Mayer challenged both choices. In his view, Powell — at 41 and with his popularity waning — was too old to play Nick (who was supposed to be 31 in the original novel), while Loy lacked the sophistication and comic timing for Nora.\n\nFrom her debut in What Price Beauty (1925), Loy had played a succession of exotic vamps, most recently at MGM in The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932) — roles that made it difficult for Mayer to imagine the 29-year-old actress as Nora Charles. Van Dyke, who also directed Loy in Penthouse (1933) and The Prizefighter and the Lady (1933), told Mayer that he had auditioned her for the part of Nora by pushing her into his smimming pool and she had \"aced the test,\" displaying the game spirit he wanted for the character. Whether this story was true or not, it finally convinced Mayer to let Van Dyke use Loy in The Thin Man — so long as she would be free to start her next film, the World War I drama Stamboul Quest (1934), three weeks later.\n\nPowell's story was much longer than Loy's; by the time of The Thin Man, he had been a major star for several years. After graduating from high school in 1910, he moved on his own to New York City to study acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He then had several successful experiences on Broadway, before director Albert Parker offered him a small role as a henchman of Professor Moriarty in Sherlock Holmes (1922). There followed steady work in silent pictures, in which he mostly played villains, until Paramount cast him as amateur detective Philo Vance in The Canary Murder Case (1929). The film's success led to two sequels — The Benson Murder Case (1930) and The Kennel Murder Case (1933) — the latter produced by Warner Bros. instead of Paramount. In early 1934, Powell was brought to MGM for Manhattan Melodrama by producer David O. Selznick, at a time when the studio badly needed to enlarge its supply of leading men. It was the public's identification of him with Vance that ultimately convinced Mayer that Powell was a plausible choice for the role of Nick Charles.\n\nMyrna Loy, William Powell and Skippy\n\nin a publicity still for The Thin Man\n\nTo compose the screenplay for The Thin Man, Van Dyke relied on the husband-and-wife writing team of Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich, who also recently contracted with MGM. The two former actors had turned to writing for the stage several years earlier and came to Hollywood to pen the adaptation of their 1930 Broadway play Up Pops the Devil for Paramount. They signed with MGM in 1933 and wrote the aforementioned Penthouse, as well as The Secret Madame Blanche (1933)and Fugitive Lovers (1934), before Van Dyke approached them about The Thin Man.\n\nHackett and Goodrich were initially hesitant to take on the assignment, as they felt that the material was wrong for them. \"Neither of us had even read a mystery story, so we didn't know that to do,\" Hackett later recalled. \"And Van Dyke said, 'I don't care anything about the mystery stuff — just give me five scenes between Nick and Nora. [...] Forget about the mystery, let that come in when you want.\" Goodrich was far negative than her husband about the project, writing to her agent that she hoped Stromberg would decide to scrap the idea of turning The Thin Man into a film because the book \"stinks.\" Nonetheless, the duo completed the script in only three weeks. While some have suggested that Nick and Nora were modeled on Hammett and his longtime lover Lillian Hellman, friends and relatives of Goodrich and Hackett have claimed that the characters' relationship more closely resembled that of the screenwriters.\n\nVan Dyke was a no-nonsense director, who was know as One-Take Woody\" because of the speed and economy with which he made a picture. The Thin Man was no exception; he shot the film in a brisk eighteen days in April 1934, at a bargain cost of $231,000. Van Dyke often did not bother with cover shots if he felt the scene was right on the first take, reasoning that actors \"lose their fire\" is thet had to do something over and over. He also valued spontaneity and encouraged improvisation from his actors. For instance, Van Dyke decided to shoot Powell's first scene, which is set at a bar, without the actor knowing it so that he would be as relaxed as natural as possible. He instructed Powell to take the cocktail shaker, go behind the counter and walk through the scene while the crew checked lights and sound. Powell did just that, throwing in some lines and business of his own, and suddenly heard Van Dyke say, \"That's it! Print it!\" Similarly, the director did not tell Loy about her now classic entrance — falling on the floor of the same bar with an armload of Christmas presents — until right before they shot it, in order to keep it fresh and spontaneous.\n\nW. S. Van Dyke directing Myrna Loy and\n\nWilliam Powell in the dinner party scene\n\nLoy has said that the biggest issue during shooting was the climatic dinner party scene wherein Nick reveals Wynant's killer. Powell complained that he had too many lines to learn and could barely decipher the complicated plot he was unraveling. It was the one sequence in the film that required several retakes, which created an entirely new problem. The script called for oysters to be served to the dinner guests and, in take after take, the same plate of oysters was brought out under the hot lights. \"They began to putrify,\" Loy recalled. \"By the time wee finished that scene, nobody ever wanted to see another oyster.\"\n\nYears later, Powell spoke of how much he loved working with Loy because of her naturalness, her professionalism and her complete lack of \"diva\" temperament: \"When we did a scene together, we forgot about technique, camera angles, and microphones. We weren't acting. We were just two people in perfect harmony. Myrna, unlike some actresses who think only of themselves, has the happy faculty of being able to listen while the other fellow says his lines. She has the give and take of acting that brings out the best.\" For her part, Loy noted, \"Bill was so naturally witty and outrageousthat I stayed somewhat detached, always a little incredulous.\" Between them, she added, was a sense of complete understanding, \"an instinct for how one could bring out the best in the other.\"\n\nThe Thin Man premiered on May 25, 1934 and put in general release the following month at the Capitol and Loew's Metropolitan theatres in New York. The film was a huge success among audiences and critics alike. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times described it as \"an excellent combination of comedy and excitement,\" while the World Telegram called it \"a picture you simply cannot afford to miss unless you want to cheat yourself.\" Louella Parsons, who was then a reviewer and not a gossip columnist, wrote, \"Dashiell Hammett's original story is by no means as clever as the film version. That's because of the amusing subtlety of the film delineations, the delightfully amusing portrayals and the smart dialogue. Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich, adapters, come in here for our congratulations.\" At the 7th Academy Awards held in February 1935, The Thin Man earned nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor (Powell), Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, but did not win in any category: all four awards went to Frank Capra's It Happened One Night (1934), with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, written by Robert Riskin.\n\nMyrna Loy and William Powell\n\nBecause The Thin Man was such a massive hit for MGM, it served as the basis for a lucrative series of five sequels, all of them starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles. Hammett wrote a detailed outline for the first two sequels, After the Thin Man (1936) and Another Thin Man (1939), which were both scripted by the Hacketts and directed by Van Dyke, who also helmed Shadow of the Thin Man (1941). The other two were produced after Van Dyke's untimely death in 1943 and included The Thin Man Goes Home (1945), directed by Richard Thorpe, and Song of the Thin Man (1947), helmed by Edward Buzzell.\n\nAfter Another Thin Man, Hammett declared that he was \"bored\" with the franchise and decided to sell to MGM the screen rights of the Thin Man title as well as the characters of Nick and Nora for $40,000. He commented that no one had \"ever invented a more insufferably smug pair of characters. They can't take that away from me, not even for $40,000.\" Hammett ultimately earned $1 million dollars in royalties from the novel and its spin-offs, which — besides the original film and its five sequels — included a radio show called The Adventures of the Thin Man (1941-1950) and a television series broadcast by NBC between 1957 and 1959, starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk as Nick and Nora. In addition, Hammett's story inspired a television film entitled Nick and Nora (1977), with Craig Stevens and JoAnn Pflug, and a musical play of the same name, which ran on Broadway for just one week in December 1991, starring Barry Bostwick and Joanna Gleason.\n\n____________________________\n\nSOURCES:\n\nDashiell Hammett and the Movies by William H.

A drama graduate from Northwestern University, she had just arrived in Hollywood following a Tony Award-winning performance in Lillian Hellman's Another Part of the Forest . Impressed by Patricia's looks, Vidor approached the young actress and asked if she would be interested in doing a screen test for the female lead in his newest film, The Fountainhead (1949). Gary Cooper had already signed as the male protagonist, and the studio was then considering Lauren Bacall and Barbara Stanwyck to play his love interest. Neal liked the script and about two months later, she met with the director for sound and photographic tests. Vidor was enthusiastic about Patricia, but her first audition was a complete disaster. Cooper was apparently watching her from off the set and he was so unimpressed by her performance that he commented, « What's that!? » He tried to con\n\nIn the mid- and late 1930s, screwball comedy was in vogue and practically every actress in Hollywood tried her hand at it. Barbara Stanwyck never considered herself a naturally funny person or a comedienne per se , but after delivering a heart-wrenching performance in King Vidor's Stella Dallas (1937), she decided she needed a « vacation » from emotional dramas. In her search for a role, she stumbled upon a « champagne comedy » called The Mad Miss Manton (1938), originally intended as a Katharine Hepburn vehicle. Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda as Melsa and Peter in The Mad Miss Manton . Directed by Leigh Jason from a script by Philip G. Epstein, The Mad Miss Manton begins when vivacious Park Avenue socialite Melsa Manton finds a corpse while walking her dogs in the early hours of the morning. She calls the police, but they dismiss the incident — not only because Melsa is a notorious prankster, but also because the body disappears in the meantime.

Hoping that she would be inspired to repeat that accomplishment, Irving Thalberg, head of production at Metro, sent Marion to Chicago, Illinois to research story ideas. While flicking through the pages of The Saturday Evening Post , she found an article revealing that, in a city where people distrusted the police, a small group of leading citizens met in secret to arrange their own justice for criminals. Marion took inspiration from that story and wrote The Secret Six (1931), in which Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone, stars of The Big House , play two mobsters prosecuted by a half a dozen vigilantes. Thalberg was pleased with the leading roles Marion wrote for Beery and Stone, but asked if she could also fill out one of the minor leads for Clark Gable , a tall, dark and handsome 30-year-old actor whom Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had recen\n\nTheatrical release poster Directed by George Sidney , Who Was That Lady?

This list includes both classic and «modern» films, which make up a total of 161 titles. About three or four of these were re-watches, but I decided to include them anyway. Let me know how many from these you have seen. As always, films marked with a heart ( ❤ ) are my favorites.

Since then, it has become one of the most influential war dramas, noted for its technical realism and spectacular air-combat sequences. This is the story of how it came to be made. A man and his story The concept for Wings originated from a writer trying to sell one of his stories. In September 1924, Byron Morgan approached Jesse L. Lasky, vice-president of Famous Players-Lasky, a component of Paramount Pictures, proposing that the studio do an aviation film. Morgan suggested an «incident and plot» focused on the failure of the American aerial effort in World War I and the effect that the country's «aviation unpreparedness» would have in upcoming conflicts. Lasky liked the idea, and approved the project under the working title «The Menace.» LEFT: Byron Morgan (1889-1963). RIGHT: Jesse L. Lasky (1880-1958).

I used to watch dozens of classic films every month, and every time I discovered a new star I liked I would go and watch their entire filmography. But somewhere along the way, that passion dimmed down. For instance, I watched 73 classic films in 2016, and only 10 in 2020. The other day, I found this film with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. that I had never heard of — the film is Mimi (1935), by the way — and for some reason it made me really excited about Old Hollywood again. It made me really miss the magic of that era and all the wonderful actors and actresses. And it also made me think of all the reasons why I fell in love with classic films in the first place. I came up with 80 reasons, which I thought would be fun to share with you. Most of them are just random little scenes or quirky little quotes, but put them together and they spell Old Hollywood to me. Yesterday I posted part one ; her\n\nChristmas has always been a source of inspiration to many artists and writers. Over the years, filmmakers have adapted various Christmas stories into both movies and TV specials, which have become staples during the holiday season all around the world. Even though Christmas is my favourite holiday, I haven't watched a lot of Christmas films. Still, I thought it would be fun to rank my top 10 favourites, based on the ones that I have indeed seen. Here they are. 10. Holiday Affair (1949) Directed by Don Hartman, Holiday Affair tells the story of a young widow (Janet Leigh) torn between a boring attorney (Wendell Corey) and a romantic drifter (Robert Mitchum). She's engaged to marry the boring attorney, but her son (Gordon Gebert) likes the romantic drifter better. Who will she choose? Well, we all know who she will choose. Holiday Affair is not by any means the greatest Christmas film of all time, but it's still a very enjoyable Yule-tide comedy to watch over the holi\n\nIn January 1944, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer happened to see a young crooner by the name of Frank Sinatra perform at a benefit concert for The Jewish Home for the Aged in Los Angeles. According to Nancy Sinatra, Frank's eldest daughter, Mayer was so moved by her father's soulful rendition of « Ol' Man River » that he made the decision right then and there to sign Frank to his studio. Sinatra had been on the MGM payroll once before, singing with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra in the Eleanor Powell vehicle Ship Ahoy (1942), although it is very likely that Mayer never bothered to see that film. Now that Frank was «hot,» however, Metro made arrangements to buy half of his contract from RKO, with the final deal being signed in February of that year.
