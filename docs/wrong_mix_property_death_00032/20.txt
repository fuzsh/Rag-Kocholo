The first thing you notice, on entering Robert F. Kennedy junior’s office at his home in Los Angeles, is a stuffed tiger. It was shot by Sukarno, the first president of Indonesia, whom the CIA reputedly tried to assassinate. As Kennedy tells it, his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, on learning that Sukarno was anti-American, said, “I’d be anti-American too, if the CIA tried to kill me.” Hearing of this, Sukarno “fell in love” with JFK and invited him to visit Indonesia. Kennedy’s father, Robert F. Kennedy senior, who in the early 1960s was the attorney-general in his brother’s administration, went instead and brought back the gift of the tiger. Soon afterwards Sukarno sent two live Komodo dragons that Bobby junior had requested (they wound up in a zoo).

Today Kennedy keeps the animal in his outside office because his wife, Cheryl Hines, an actor best known for her turn in “Curb Your Enthusiasm”, “won’t allow it in the house”. The trophy keeps company with a stuffed bat given to Kennedy by Glenn Close, who is godmother to one of his two daughters, and a red-tailed hawk which, as a novice falconer, he trapped in Virginia when he was 15. He took up falconry after reading about its role in King Arthur’s Camelot (which is also the nickname applied to JFK’s glamorous, ostensibly idealistic court).
