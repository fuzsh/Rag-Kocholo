        "text": "Ms Shanahan, 38, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has never before run for political office.\n\nMr Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and scion of America's most famous political dynasty, is running as an independent.\n\nNaming a VP pick is a prerequisite to be on the ballot in a number of states.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign has ruffled Democrats, who are concerned about its spoiler potential on President Joe Biden's re-election chances.\n\nOn Tuesday Mr Kennedy embraced that label, calling his campaign \"a spoiler for President Biden and for President Trump\" that will \"forge an unstoppable coalition of homeless Democrats and homeless Republicans\".\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has recently stepped up attacks on Mr Kennedy, arguing that his longshot third-party bid will only end up helping to elect the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.\n\nMs Shanahan was unveiled on Tuesday by Mr Kennedy at a rally in Oakland, California, where he described her as a \"fellow lawyer, a brilliant scientist, technologist, a fierce warrior mom\".\n\nShe has previously been a longtime Democratic donor and has already donated to Mr Kennedy's campaign. She said in her remarks that she was leaving the Democratic Party, because it had \"lost its way\" by focusing on \"elitism\" and \"winning at all costs\".\n\n\"I believe I am taking the best ideals and impulses with me,\" she said.\n\nMr Kennedy, 70, described his new running mate as someone with a deep inside knowledge of Big Tech, which he depicted as a threat to democracy.\n\nHe told the crowd he picked a younger running mate partly because he wants her to be a champion for millennial and Gen-Z Americans. He said those generations had lost hope for their future and no longer believe the political establishment has their best interests at heart.\n\nMr Kennedy was introduced at the event by his wife, Cheryl Hines, the star of HBO comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nMr Kennedy previously challenged Mr Biden for the Democratic party's nomination, before launching an independent bid last October.\n\nNaming Ms Shanahan as his vice-presidential nominee will help his campaign clear the way for ballot access in many US states and Washington DC.\n\nHis campaign has to navigate a wide variety of state rules to get his name on the ballot.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Kennedy threatened legal action against Nevada after state officials suggested signatures his campaign has gathered to qualify for the ballot there could be invalid, as he had not confirmed a running mate at the time they were filed.\n\nSo far, Mr Kennedy is only confirmed to be on the ballot in Utah.\n\nMs Shanahan's humble origins will serve as a contrast to Mr Kennedy and his famous political family.\n\nThe daughter of a Chinese immigrant mother and a white father, she grew up in Oakland and was raised on food stamps, a federal subsidy that helps low-income families buy groceries.\n\nShe's previously recalled her childhood as being filled with fear and instability because of her dad's schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nMs Shanahan has supported criminal justice reform, affordable housing and efforts to fight climate change and to increase access to mental health treatment.\n\nShe is the founder and president of Bia-Echo Foundation, a charitable organisation focused on fertility and human health.\n\nIn February, Ms Shanahan acknowledged partially funding a Super Bowl ad released by Mr Kennedy's campaign.\n\nThe ad was a remake of a 1960 one that was part of the White House campaign run by his uncle, President John F Kennedy.\n\nThe Super Bowl ad drew disapproval, including from members of RFK Jr's family, who criticised his vaccine scepticism.\n\nThe BBC spoke with half a dozen of Ms Shanahan's former and current colleagues before Tuesday's announcement.\n\nThey described her as a compassionate leader and a champion of social causes.\n\nWhile most did not realise she was considering a political career, they were surprised but not shocked to see her name floated as Mr Kennedy's vice-presidential nominee.\n\n\"She's motivated by trying to change things for the better and having an impact on social benefits,\" said Roland Vogl, executive director of Stanford University's Center for Legal Informatics, where Ms Shanahan has been a fellow.\n\nThey say her political inexperience and age should not count against her and that voters should be open to new leaders.\n\nThe last president to win without the backing of a major party was the first ever US president, George Washington.\n\nAccording to a January YouGov poll, just 1% of US voters would cast a ballot for Mr Kennedy in an election that featured Mr Biden and Mr Trump."
