        "text": "His views have caused a rift with family members. In 2023, his sister Kerry Kennedy, president of the Robert F. Kennedy Centre for Justice and Human Rights, responded to one of her brother’s suggestions that there was an argument COVID-19 was an ethnically targeted bioweapon. “I strongly condemn my brother’s deplorable and untruthful remarks,” she said. His nephew, Joe Kennedy III, a former congressman and now special economic envoy to Northern Ireland, called the comments “hurtful and wrong”.\n\nWhy is he running for president now?\n\nAsk Kennedy why he wants to be in the mix come the presidential election in November, and he responds with “typical ‘third party’ stuff”, says Associate Professor Zim Nwokora at Deakin University. That is, the major parties are failing America, and his sense of duty to the nation is forcing him to offer an alternative.\n\nAs Kennedy told CNN in April, “My supporters are people who aren’t going to vote at all. My donors are people who had given up on the American political process and are re-engaging because they don’t want to choose between the lesser of two evils.” Whoever gets elected will be able to make changes only around the margins, he said, “taxes or abortion or whatever”. He had a much bigger mission: “The chance for me to actually change the nature of governance in our country.”\n\nRFK Jr seems to believe that it is his destiny, as a Kennedy, to sit in the White House. “From my youngest days, I always had the feeling that we were all involved in some great crusade,” he once wrote, “that the world was a battleground for good and evil … It would be my good fortune if I could play an important or heroic role.”\n\n‘He’s continuing the work of his father, Robert F. Kennedy, a man that we think of as one of the great moralists. And it’s that moralism, on a different set of issues, of course, that is propelling him into this race.’\n\nSpeaking to us from Los Angeles, Dick Russell calls it “a divine force, you know, that’s helping guide him”. Russell was close to finishing the biography when Kennedy suddenly decided he would take a tilt at the presidency. “He was really doing a lot of soul-searching about it. And he felt like the country was so divided, like they’ve never been since the Civil War, and that he didn’t see anybody out there who could heal the divide. He was not in this to be a spoiler, as he’s been called. He really feels like he’s the guy who can, you know, appeal to enough people to try to bring the country together.”\n\nTim Lynch, professor of American politics at the University of Melbourne, calls it a sense of “noblesse oblige”, the French-derived philosophy that with privilege comes responsibility. “He’s continuing the work of his father, Robert F. Kennedy, a man that we think of as one of the great moralists. And it’s that moralism, on a different set of issues, of course, that is propelling him into this race.” RFK Sr was particularly admired for campaigning to end child poverty in the US, for championing civil rights and, as attorney general, relentlessly pursuing organised crime.\n\nRFK Jr initially intended to challenge President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination on Kennedy home turf. “The Kennedys are remarkable for their sense that the whole American experiment hinges on their success,” says Lynch. “That sounds more disparaging than it is, but their sense of self-confidence, that the whole system is engineered around the Kennedy family, that they are required for the republic to prosper, in part explains their success and their durability.”\n\nYet RFK Jr did not poll particularly well as a potential Democratic candidate and, to be fair, parties have very rarely countenanced opposing a sitting president. So in October 2023, he bailed from the party’s primaries process to run as an independent. “I never intended to run for president,” he said. He “saw things happening to my party and my country that made me frightened about the world that my children are going to grow up in”.\n\nWhat are his chances?\n\nThanks to the peculiarities of the US electoral system, RFK Jr’s chances of winning as an independent are slim. Only one candidate has ever managed it, and that was George Washington in the late 1700s. In 1992, independent Ross Perot received nearly 19 per cent of the popular vote nationwide but did not win a single state. So, it’s hard.\n\nThe major hurdle is that candidates have to be on the state ballots, a bureaucratic process that’s difficult and expensive without the backing of a major party (long story short: many signatures must be harvested). Kennedy will struggle here but has some wealthy donors to make the process a little easier, including his running mate, 38-year-old Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley businesswoman who has reportedly already spent millions on the campaign.\n\n‘He receives an inordinate amount of coverage and curiosity because, among the Democrats, there’s still the hope the Kennedy dream might live again.’\n\n“The people who kind of run these kinds of campaigns, often they do think they have a chance to win,” Sydney University and the University of South Alabama’s Thomas Adams tells us from New Orleans. “They do think there’s going to be a ‘come to Jesus’ moment, where people realise how correct they are about vaccines and global warming.”\n\nThe Kennedy brand remains a strong factor, says Bruce Wolpe, a Colorado native and a senior fellow at the United States Study Centre at the University of Sydney. “If he was Robert ‘Smith’, people would not be paying attention to him. He receives an inordinate amount of coverage and curiosity because, among the Democrats, there’s still the hope the Kennedy dream might live again.”\n\nKennedy has also successfully canvassed a hotchpotch of other sympathetic audiences, including vaccine fellow travellers, right-wing podcasters and Bitcoin conventioneers. (He calls the blockchain a “bulwark against totalitarianism” and wants the digital currency to be used for the entire US budget, a move he claims would improve transparency.) A poll in November found RFK Jr was more popular among voters under 45 than Trump and Biden in six key states.\n\n“It’s quite possible he’s just driven by his anti-vaccine pitch, that really what’s behind it is he’s trying to generate a lot more support for the anti-vaccine movement,” says John Hart, a former head of department at the Australian National University and author of The Presidential Branch: From Washington to Clinton.\n\n‘Some of the old rules go out of the window. Things are up for grabs in a way that they haven’t been in the past.’\n\nA decade ago, perhaps, RFK Jr’s fringe views might have seen him immediately dismissed as a serious candidate. Post-Trump, Nwokora is not so sure. “Some of the old rules go out of the window,” he says. “Things are up for grabs in a way that they haven’t been in the past.”\n\nEither way, his potential impact can’t be ignored: “Some 75,000 votes spread across three states decided the election outcome in 2016,” says Jared Mondschein at the United States Study Centre. “And 40,000 votes across three states decided the election in 2020. So, the frustrating aspect of this campaign is we have the same election as we had in 2020; the margins are so slim that everything matters. The third-party candidates, and who is actually going to be on the ballot, are going to have a significant impact on this election.”\n\nAs well as RFK Jr, third-party candidates – neither Democrat nor Republican – in 2024 are physician Jill Stein and philosophy professor Cornel West. If RFK Jr were to carry even a single state it could make the difference in what is expected to be a very tight race.\n\nCould RFK Jr cause more damage to Biden or to Trump?\n\n“When he decided to run as an independent, I think the Trump team was glad to see him in the race,” says Mondschein, who researches US election polls. “[But] when RFK Jr is on the ballot, it looks like Biden actually does better.” There’s no doubt RFK Jr will take votes from them both, he says, but when forced to choose between Biden and Trump, “significantly more of those RFK Jr voters go for Trump”.\n\nThe anti-vax movement, in particular, may sway towards RFK Jr and away from Trump. According to The Washington Post, more than six in 10 Republicans “aren’t confident in the safety of the coronavirus vaccines, and large numbers are sceptical of other vaccines as well”. And at 70, RFK Jr will be younger in the November election than Trump (78) and Biden (82), who are the two oldest candidates in US history.\n\nIf it’s a contest over “strongman”-style physical ability, Kennedy – who recently posted a video of himself working out with his shirt off – should win hands down. That said, he has not reached his eighth decade entirely unscathed. In 2012, he revealed he had been diagnosed with mercury poisoning from eating too much fish, and that a dead parasitic worm had been found in his brain after scans for a possible brain tumour. “I have cognitive problems, clearly,” he said in a deposition made during divorce proceedings. “I have short-term memory loss, and I have longer-term memory loss that affects me.” The New York Times reports that he says he has since recovered and has suffered no ongoing effects.\n\nAfter the Times article was published, Kennedy posted a message on X (formerly Twitter): “I offer to eat 5 more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate” and added, “I feel confident of the result even with a six-worm handicap.”\n\n‘It’s likely that he’s going to pick up even more Trump voters as Trump gets more and more mired in his court cases.’\n\nPractically, RFK Jr’s path might be smoothed by forming an alliance with another organisation, such as the Libertarian Party, which would have the mechanisms in place to get him spots on more ballots. But that would come with its own complications, says Nwokora. “It means that he becomes bound up with the ideology of that particular party. So that’s a dilemma for him.”\n\nIn April, 15 Kennedy family members appeared at a Biden campaign event in Philadelphia to show unequivocal support for the party and the president, even if they did not explicitly name RFK Jr in their remarks. (“I don’t know anybody in America who has got a family who agrees with them on everything,” RFK Jr told CNN.)\n\nThe Biden campaign even has a team dedicated to tracking third-party candidates, of which Lis Smith is a senior member. She told The New York Times: “Generally, RFK Jr finds support among voters who are dissatisfied with the two-party system, who aren’t enthused by either of the major-party candidates, and who actually gravitate toward him because of his last name. It’s pretty stunning when you look at the polling. A significant percentage of voters who say they support him don’t know anything about him. Which signals to us that the Kennedy name is extremely powerful in attracting support for him.”\n\nIt has been reported that Trump once considered Kennedy as a running mate on the Republican ticket, presumably because he might draw votes away from Democrats. “It’s not quite clear to me that he wants to spoil it for Biden rather than Trump,” says John Hart. “The polls are suggesting he’s attracting conspiracy theory supporters of Trump, and it’s likely that he’s going to pick up even more Trump voters as Trump gets more and more mired in his court cases.”\n\n‘The debate is no longer controlled by old-school Democrats and old-school Republicans.’\n\nCertainly, his more eclectic views might be attractive to erstwhile Republican voters, says Bruce Wolpe: “People who like Trump policies but don’t like Trump.” Consequently, Trump has recently pivoted from a neutral stand on RFK Jr to attacking him as a Democrat “plant” and a “wasted protest vote”. Ironically, Trump has only himself to blame for clearing the path for an idiosyncratic candidate like RFK Jr. “Trump has opened up the debate,” says Lynch. “The debate is no longer controlled by old-school Democrats and old-school Republicans.” Twenty years ago, he says, Kennedy would have been seen as “nuts”. “But he wouldn’t have been taking these positions because the environment wouldn’t have enabled them.”\n\nMondschein says RFK Jr can’t be pinned down on a political spectrum. “The far left and the far right now are meeting; that’s why I can’t commit to him being far left or far right.” There’s a mix of views on his chances: “He doesn’t have a chance; his role is a spoiler,” says Mondschein.\n\nSays Nwokora: “It’s a theoretical possibility. I wouldn’t consider it anything more than that.”\n\nDick Russell believes RFK Jr’s “got a decent chance” of taking the top job, but concedes it’s an uphill battle: “There’s no doubt about it. But I do think that more than any time since I’ve been alive, that this is a possibility.”\n\nThis article was first published on May 5 and was since updated May 9."
