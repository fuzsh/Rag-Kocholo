I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done that I feel I am obliged to do all I can.”\n\n—Robert F. Kennedy\n\nA world-renowned photojournalist and chronicler of the twentieth century’s most historic events, Harry Benson provides an eyewitness account of Robert F. Kennedy’s campaign for the presidential nomination in R.F.K.: A Photographer’s Journal.\n\nAs a friend, advisor, and attorney general to his brother, John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy stood at the heart of Washington politics. He is remembered today as a compassionate, articulate, and optimistic man—a friend to the poor, an avid civil rights advocate, a champion for peace. Harry Benson’s images capture unprecedented intimate family outings and outdoor adventures with friends alongside every moment of Kennedy’s brief but unforgettable presidential run, from his announcement of his candidacy on St. Patrick’s Day, 1968, and the fervor and excitement of his days on the campaign trail, all the way through his shocking assassination in Los Angeles and the long, sweltering funeral procession to Arlington Cemetery.\n\nHere in elegant photographs are glimpses of the exhilarating successes and challenging setbacks of R.F.K.’s campaign, the chaos of that fateful night in L.A., and the mourning of hundreds of thousands after their hero was struck down. Released in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Kennedy’s death, and supplemented with excerpts from his speeches and from Benson’s own journals, R.F.K.: A Photographer’s Journal is a fitting tribute to an extraordinary man and the legacy he left behind."
