        "text": "If the 2024 presidential race boiled entirely down to historical name recognition, then Robert F. Kennedy Jr. might be a top candidate.\n\nThe 69-year-old comes from arguably the most famous political family in American history, as he is the nephew of President John. F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated 55 years ago while running for president in 1968.\n\nIn terms of political experience though, Kennedy doesn’t have anywhere near the credentials other family members have.\n\nAn environmental lawyer, he has never held a political office.\n\nOf late, Kennedy has made headlines for a boisterous anti-vaccine stance, claiming vaccines for COVID haven’t proven to be safe and writing a book in 2021 ripping Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nHis own family members have come against his anti-vaccine stance.\n\nRegardless of the controversy, Kennedy announced a longshot presidential bid against incumbent President Joe Biden in April.\n\nOn Oct. 9, he announced he was running as an Independent and not in the Democratic primary.\n\nHe is the fifth member of the Kennedy family to run for president."
