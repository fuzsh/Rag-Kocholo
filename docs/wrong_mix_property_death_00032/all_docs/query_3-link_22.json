        "text": "May 1968 was Robert F. Kennedy’s last full month of campaigning for president before he was killed in June.\n\nWhile he is remembered more broadly for his vision of a more just and peaceful world, it is, perhaps, the anecdotes that best illustrate his character and a place to draw inspiration.\n\nKevin Khadavi and Zoel Boublil, both members of the Speak Truth to Power Youth Advisory Board, look at some of these moments and examine how they can shape our views on advancing and expanding human rights and social justice.\n\nKevin Khadavi:\n\nThere is an RFK anecdote I think of often from the late Frank Mankiewicz, Kennedy’s press secretary during the 1968 campaign. In his memoir So I Was Saying … and also in an interview years later, Mankiewicz recalls a day on the campaign trail: A reporter approached Kennedy on a plane and asked him about his position on capital punishment.\n\n“I’m against it,” Kennedy told the reporter.\n\nThe reporter pressed further. “When you were at the Justice Department, that wasn’t your position.”\n\n“That was before I read Camus,” Kennedy replied.\n\nFrench philosopher Albert Camus explored death and the human experience, and his writings so touched Kennedy that he was willing to publicly change his position on capital punishment.\n\nI am inspired by this nearly 55 years after his death – and it isn’t about Camus. Change – what author Jack Newfield called “the motif of (Robert Kennedy’s) whole life and career” – is a place where we all can draw inspiration. RFK’s change was unorthodox but intentional, it was sought after, and, ultimately, it was done with pride.\n\nLate civil rights leader Charles Evers commented on Bobby’s capacity for change: “The reason Bobby changed, I think, is because he wanted to change. He was young, and he was ambitious, and he wanted to do something that was different. He wanted to prove to people that there were people with all the affluence in this country that he possessed (who) could also be as little and as humble as anyone else. He changed because he listened. Most politicians don’t listen…Bobby was the kind of guy who said what he believed, and said what he thought was right.”\n\nIt is Robert Kennedy’s confidence, paired with his desire to be the best person he could – and expect the same from those around him – that continues to capture the public imagination more than a half-century later.\n\nWhile the desire for growth is embedded deep within humanity, I’m still struck by how RFK continuously challenged his beliefs as he gained insight, and how he used that insight to improve the lives of others. It encourages me to do the same.\n\nZoel Boublil:\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis, Attorney General Robert Kennedy also wore two more hats – mediator and trusted adviser – and he brought his personal style of politics to each.\n\nAs the most-trusted top adviser to his brother, President John F. Kennedy, during the crisis, he met with the intelligence community and developed possible arguments from all involved in order to keep the U.S. well-prepared.\n\nHe also served as his brother’s de facto chief of staff, “the No. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6” man in Washington, as per President Kennedy. He shined as a key mediator in the situation room and primary negotiator with the Soviet ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin.\n\nRFK’s steadfastness and kindness stood out, as he often privately met with the President to talk freely about the situation and provide him an unofficial way to understand the positions of top U.S. and Soviet officials.\n\nHis roles as a mediator and trusted advisor didn’t stop in the U.S. government; they are apparent in RFK’s civil rights work as well. Often, figures with such a broad legacy are put into boxes, labeled as a force in one specific area, ignoring the holistic view."
