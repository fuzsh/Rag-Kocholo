        "text": "Netflix.\n\nCrimetown.\n\nNational Public Radio.\n\nThe Daily Mail (UK).\n\nThese are just a few of the media outlets — not to mention the authors and poets — who’ve reach out to UMass Dartmouth in the past few months.\n\nWhat do they all have in common?\n\nThey are researching the death of Robert F. Kennedy. And they’re coming to UMass Dartmouth because the university houses the Robert F. Kennedy Assassination Archive Collection, which was dedicated April 20, 1988.\n\nKennedy was shot shortly after midnight June 5, 1968, after winning the California Democratic presidential primary, and he died the next day.\n\nIn marking the 50th anniversary of his assassination, the RFK archives housed at the Claire T. Carney Library have become a busy place to be.\n\nHOW DID THEY GET TO UMASS DARTMOUTH?\n\nIn the early 1980s, as the result of Professor Philip Melanson burgeoning reputation as a political assassinations expert, a California group approached him with more than 30 boxes of RFK assassination papers, “to find a home for.”\n\nIt was the genesis of what is now the school’s RFK Archive, the “largest, most complete collection of RFK assassination-related materials in the world,” Melanson told The Standard-Times in 1997.\n\n“I think that unlike President (John F.) Kennedy’s assassination where lots of people are aware there are mysteries surrounding it, in Robert Kennedy’s, there’s much less public awareness of the controversies and unresolved questions that surround his death,” said Melanson in 2000.\n\nMelanson wrote several books, including “Shadow Play: The Murder of Robert F. Kennedy, The Trial of Sirhan Sirhan, and the Failure of American Justice” with co-author William Klaber. A second edition, by Klaber, was published in April. Melanson died of cancer in 2006.\n\nIn the book “Shadow Play,” Melanson asserted that (convicted assassin) “Sirhan Sirhan’s bullets did not kill RFK (in the pantry of LA’s Ambassador Hotel).”\n\n“There was some stepping on toes,” Melanson said in 1997.\n\nMelanson also taught a senior seminar on the assassination at UMass.\n\nAs Judith Farrar, archives and special collections librarian, recalled, “It was very popular.” And thanks to the archives, the students were able to use primary sources.\n\nWHAT’S IN THE ARCHIVES?\n\nThe assassination was investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department Detective Squad and the FBI Los Angeles Field Office. Among the resources the library has are copies of the LAPD files on the case.\n\n“In 1984 when we started, all files were sealed,” Melanson told the S-T in 1997. “FBI, LAPD, and DA’s office. I started to spend so much time in Los Angeles that people thought I lived there.”\n\nMelanson made copies of the material, but, unfortunately, some evidence wasn’t retained.\n\nThe UMass collection also includes audiotape interviews, videotapes and news clippings. The library has 720 audio cassette tapes, which include interviews by the LAPD and others looking into the case, such as private investigators. An LAPD summary of the trial runs to more than 1,200 pages.\n\nThe UMass archives also include the entire transcript of the court trial, which is more than 9,000 pages. The FBI records were released between 1984 and 1986 under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAmong the more recent acquisitions are the works by court artist Leone McNeil. McNeil made several large drawings of Sirhan during the trial.\n\nSirhan was arrested on the scene after being wrestled to the ground. Kennedy was treated at Good Samaritan hospital but died at 1:44 a.m. June 6. He did not have Secret Service protection, just private security. Since then, presidential candidates have had Secret Service protection.\n\nThe trial of Sirhan, who was in his early 20s, began in January 1969 and he was found guilty that same year. When the California Supreme Court abolished the death penalty in 1972, his sentence was commuted to life in prison where he remains today.\n\nAmong the many documents the library has are copies of Sirhan’s notebooks. At a glance, they seem rambling and include repeated words, but also some thoughts about Kennedy.\n\nWORKING OVERTIME\n\nOver the years, many academics and writers have used the RFK archives as a resource, but this past year, Farrar has been even busier than usual because of the 50th anniversary of RFK’s death.\n\nFarrar said filmmakers from Netflix came to the library when working on a four-part series called “Robert F. Kennedy for President.” It’s available now on the online subscriber.\n\nAlso among those using the library’s resources is Tim Tate, an author, investigative journalist and filmmaker based in the United Kingdom.\n\n“The archives contain a treasure trove of information assembled by Phil Melanson and the remarkable group of investigators, which coalesced around him,” Tate said via email. “The collection is extensive, and though I spent five full days going through box after box of documents, I could have stayed much longer. Many of the documents are unique and provide a revealing insight into the assassination.”\n\nThe book he’s working on is being serialized by The Daily Mail, which is publishing it online now. The series focuses on the theory that Sirhan was not the shooter.\n\n“The archives did play a significant role in several of those revelations,” Tate said.\n\nPoet Ed Sanders used the archives for a creative work — “Broken Glory” that is now available on Amazon, Farrar said.\n\nAmong the more interesting people who’s availed himself of the archives is someone from Norway who’s been contacting Farrar for 15 years. She said he’s not on the internet and sends cash for copies.\n\nFarrar, who’s been at the library since 1995, said Melanson not only had a depth of knowledge on the assassination, “He was very approachable and a very popular teacher. I really feel his absence. He was the one academic expert you could go to.”\n\nShe said if Melanson had lived, “We could have done so much more.”"
