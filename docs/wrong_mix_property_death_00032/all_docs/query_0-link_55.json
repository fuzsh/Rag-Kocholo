        "text": "​\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr. joins the Institute to discuss the issues facing America today, and the importance of the New Hampshire Primary in ensuring a competitive primary campaign that produces the Democratic party’s most competitive candidate. He recently sent an open letter to the Democratic National Committee urging them not to interfere in New Hampshire’s plan to hold the nation's first primary.\n\nKennedy feels our biggest political challenge today is bridging the partisan divide between Republicans and Democrats and ending the paralyzing polarization plaguing our country. He contends the perfect battleground for determining candidates who are able to do that is New Hampshire.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr. is an environmental lawyer, best-selling author and activist. He has founded Children's Health Defense and the Waterkeeper Alliance — the world’s largest clean water advocacy group — and served as its longtime chairman and attorney.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr. graduated from Harvard University, studied at the London School of Economics and received his law degree from the University of Virginia. Following graduation, he attended Pace University School of Law, which awarded him a Master’s Degree in Environmental Law. He served on the Pace Law School faculty from 1986 to 2018 and cofounded and supervised Pace's Environmental Litigation Clinic.\n\nKennedy’s articles have appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, Atlantic Monthly, Esquire, The Nation, Outside Magazine, the Village Voice and many others."
