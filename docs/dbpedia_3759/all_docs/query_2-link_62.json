        "text": "National governing body of cricket in India\n\n\"BCCI\" redirects here. For other uses, see BCCI (disambiguation).\n\nFor the bank, see Bank of Credit and Commerce International.\n\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the principal national governing body of cricket in India.[13] Its headquarters is situated at the Cricket Centre in Churchgate, Mumbai.[14] The BCCI is the wealthiest governing body of cricket in the world.[15][16][17] The BCCI is involved in talent development through grassroots programs and cricket academies. Its initiatives include infrastructure development, coaching, and player welfare programs designed to maintain and enhance India's competitive performance internationally.\n\nThe BCCI was established in 1 December 1928 at Madras (currently Chennai) under Act XXI of 1860 of Madras and was subsequently reregistered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975.[18] It is a consortium of state cricket associations that select their own representatives who elect the BCCI president. It joined the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1926 which later became the International Cricket Council.[2] The BCCI is an autonomous, private organization that does not fall under the purview of the National Sports Federation of India of Government of India and does not receive any grants from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The BCCI is influential in international cricket.[19][20][21] The International Cricket Council shares the largest part of its revenue with the BCCI. IPL run by BCCI is one of the wealthiest sports leagues in the world.[22]\n\nIn financial year 2023-2024, BCCI earned ₹18,700 crore (US$2.2 billion).[22] BCCI paid ₹4,298 crore (US$510 million) in taxes for the financial year 2022-23.[23][24][details 1]\n\nR. E. Grant Govan was the first BCCI president and Anthony De Mello was its first secretary.[25] As of February 2023 , Roger Binny is the incumbent BCCI president and Jay Shah is the secretary.[26][27]\n\nBCCI has hosted multiple Cricket World Cups,[a] and will host the 2026 T20 World Cup, the 2029 Champions Trophy, the 2031 Cricket World Cup,[b] and the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup.[29][c]\n\nThe BCCI manages four squads that represent India in international cricket; the men's national cricket team, the women's national cricket team, the men's national under-19 cricket team and women's national under-19 cricket team. It also governs developmental India A, India B and India A women's teams.[30] Its national selection committee, which is led by chief national selector, selects players for these teams.[d] As part of its duties, the BCCI organises and schedules matches to be played by each of these teams, and schedules, sanctions and organises domestic cricket in India.[31][32][33]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first game of cricket was played in India by European sailors, who played the sport as a recreational activity in the first half of the 18th century. These sailors played cricket near their coastal settlements. The first recorded match in India was played between the British army and British settlers in 1751. The world's second-oldest cricket club, Calcutta Cricket Club, was founded in 1792 in present-day Kolkata. The Parsis were the first civilian community to accept cricket as a sport and play it in India.[34] In 1848, they set up the Oriental Cricket Club in present-day Mumbai. In 1850, they founded the Young Zoroastrian Cricket Club. In 1886, Hindus founded the Hindu Gymkhana sports club.[35]\n\nIn 1912, an all-India cricket team visited England for the first time, and were sponsored and captained by the Maharaja of Patiala. In 1926, two representatives of Calcutta Cricket Club travelled to London to attend meetings of the Imperial Cricket Conference, the predecessor of the current International Cricket Council. Although technically not an official representative of Indian cricket, they were allowed to attend by Lord Harris, chairman of the conference. The outcome of the meeting was the MCC's decision to send a team that was led by Arthur Gilligan, who had captained England in The Ashes, to India.[citation needed]\n\nFounding and early years\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a meeting with the Maharaja of Patiala and others, Gilligan promised to press for its inclusion in the ICC if all of the game's promoters in the country united to establish a single controlling body. An assurance was given[by whom?] and on 21 November 1927 a meeting was held in Delhi, which was attended by delegates from Patiala, Delhi, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, Rajputana, Alwar, Bhopal, Gwalior, Baroda, Kathiawar, Central Provinces and Berar, Sindh and Punjab. The delegates agreed to create a board for control of cricket in India. On 10 December 1927, a unanimous decision to form a provisional board of control was taken, and the BCCI was formed in December 1928. R. E. Grant Govan was elected as its first president and Anthony de Mello was secretary.[36]\n\nIn 1926, the BCCI joined the Imperial Cricket Council, then the governing body for international cricket. In 1936, the BCCI started India's premier first-class cricket championship the Ranji Trophy, which was named after the first Indian person who played international cricket, the King of Nawanagar state K.S. Ranjitsinhji,[37] who played for England in international cricket. The Mumbai cricket team is the most-successful team, winning 42 titles.\n\nIn 1932, India played its maiden Test match under the captaincy of C. K. Nayudu against England at Lord's cricket ground in London. During England's 1933-34 tour of India, on 17 December 1933, Lala Amarnath became the first Indian batsman to score a test century, scoring 118 on his debut, at Bombay Gymkhana.[38] In 1967–68, India won its first-ever Test cricket series outside Asia. Previously it had defeated Pakistan, New Zealand and England, and won series in India.[39]\n\n1945–1987\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1952, the England team toured India; it was their first tour of India after its Independence. Nigel Howard was the captain of touring team.[40] The former India captain Vijaya Ananda Gajapathi Raju, also known as Vizzy, was the BCCI president in the 1960s.[41]\n\nIn 1975, the BCCI paid ₹2,500 per match to the test cricketers. Banks, Indian railways and private enterprises would recruit players.[42]\n\nThe board appointed Ajit Wadekar captain in 1971, the Indian team won their first test series against England on English soil, and against the West Indies, Sunil Gavaskar made his test debut in latter series.\n\nIndia won the 1983 Cricket World Cup, defeating the defending champions the West Indies by 43 runs in the final at Lord's. India also won the World Championship of Cricket in 1985, defeating Pakistan by eight wickets in the final at Melbourne Cricket Ground. The BCCI hosted the 1987 World Cup; it was the first time the event was organised outside England.[43]\n\n1987–2000\n\n[edit]\n\nThrough the 1980s and early 1990s, BCCI paid ₹5 lakh per match to terrestrial television network Doordarshan to broadcast the Indian cricket team's matches.[44]\n\nIt hosted the ICC Cricket World Cup competitions in 1987 and 1996.[28][e]\n\nIn 1991, BCCI proposed South Africa's readmission to international cricket at the International Cricket Council (ICC).[45] After the proposal succeeded, the BCCI sold television broadcast rights for the first time; South African Broadcasting Corporation purchased the rights to broadcast the South African cricket tour of India, South Africa's first official international tour after the 21-year boycott from international cricket.[46] During this time, South Africa joined the \"Asian bloc\" of the BCCI and its South-Asian neighbours.\n\nIn 1993, the BCCI signed a deal with TransWorld International (TWI), which would pay the BCCI to televise England's tour of India on satellite television and Doordarshan would pay TWI for the rights to televise the matches in India.[47][48] The 1993 Hero Cup was broadcast on Star TV, which made it the first cricket series to be broadcast on satellite television in India and broke the monopoly of Doordarshan.[49][47] A lengthy legal battle between Doordarshan and the BCCI—which was led by Jagmohan Dalmiya and president I. S. Bindra—ensued. In February 1995, the Supreme Court of India ruled the television rights of India's matches were a commodity belonging to the BCCI, for which the broadcaster must pay BCCI and not the other way around.[50]\n\nBCCI, in a joint bid with Pakistan and Sri Lanka, won the rights to host the 1996 Cricket World Cup, defeating the England-and-Australia bloc. The tournament was a commercial success,[51] yielding the ICC a profit of $50 million.[50]\n\nIn 1997, Dalmiya became the president of the ICC.[51] With Dalmiya at the head of the ICC, the BCCI led a successful proposal to grant Test status to Bangladesh in 1999–2000.[52]\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 2000, the BCCI has hosted and organised multiple ICC cricket World Cups competitions that is men's 2011 ODI world cup,[f] the 2023 ODI world cup, the 2016 T20 world cup, the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy and 2021 T20 world cups;[g] 2013, 2016 Women's Cricket world cups.\n\nIn 2007, the BCCI established the Indian Premier League (IPL), an annual, franchise-based, Twenty20 cricket league. In 2008, the BCCI sold the ownership rights of eight city-based franchises to corporate groups and Bollywood celebrities in a closed auction for a total of US$723.49 million;[53] it also sold the tournament's global media rights for 10 years to World Sport Group for US$1.03 billion. The media deal was re-negotiated the following year to $1.6 billion.[54] In 2010, the BCCI expanded the league to 10 teams, selling two new franchises for a total of US$703 million.[55] Due to the IPL's commercial success, similarly styled Twenty20 leagues appeared around the world, as did franchise-based leagues in other sports in India.[56][57]\n\nIn 2014, the BCCI, Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board seized control of several of the ICC's key committees to form the \"Big Three\".

However the Department of Revenue issued a notice for tax evasion to the BCCI, they also demanded the BCCI for another outstanding income-tax payment of ₹1,303 crore; according to details submitted by the Ministry of finance in the Parliament in February 2019.[137]\n\nSince IPL began Income Tax Department (IT department) refused to give income tax exemption for IPL, said it is an annual commercial activity. Since financial year 2007-2008 to 2017-2018, BCCI paid ₹3,500 Cr to IT department, out of around ₹12000 Cr it earned from the IPL.[138]\n\nIn 2007–08, although the IT department withdrew this exemption[which?], BCCI only paid tax amounting to ₹41.9 crore (US$5.0 million) against its tax liability of ₹413 crore (US$49 million) in the 2009–2010 financial year[139]\n\nIn 2012, BCCI paid no income tax, claimed they are a charitable organisation.[140]\n\nIn 2015, then Finance minister Jayant Sinha said, ministry collected ₹2140.58 Cr from BCCI, 2004–05 onwards, but tax payment still pending, 53 Cr is from assessment year 2008–09, ₹100 Cr from 2010 to 11, ₹100 Cr from 2011 to 12, ₹116.89 Cr of year 2012–13 from BCCI.[141] In 2014–15, the BCCI paid ₹864.78 Cr income tax by leaving outstanding tax of ₹462.52 Cr, which income tax department want from it, also demanded ₹400 Cr from FY 2015–16.[142]\n\nThe following table contains the information of BCCI's tax payment : [24]\n\nFY Amount 2013–14 ₹50[143] or ₹100 Cr[138] 2014–15 ₹864.78 Cr[142] 2017–18 ₹596.21 Cr 2018–19 ₹815.08 Cr 2019–20 ₹882.29 Cr 2020–21 ₹844.92 Cr 2021–22 ₹1159 Cr 2022–23 ₹4000 Cr\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nConflicts of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Indian Premier League § Controversies\n\nIndia Cements-Chennai Super Kings owner and former president N. Srinivasan was criticised for his alleged biased behaviour towards some state boards by awarding them ODI, Test and T20I matches while in office, possibly in violation of the board's rotation policy on venues.[144][145][26]\n\nDuring Srinivasan's tenure as treasurer in BCCI before he became the president, the board constitution was amended to facilitate him to buy an IPL franchise, through his company India Cements during the 2008 IPL team auction (An event held where 8 teams was sold through an open auction).[146] Srinivasan courted further controversy for appointing India national side's and Chennai Super Kings' (CSK) captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni as a vice-president of India Cements.[147] He also interfered in national team's selection, in 2012 ex BCCI selector Mohinder Amarnath revealed that selectors wanted to sack Dhoni from skipper post, after India lost 8 test in a row, including \"disastrous series in Australia\", they wanted to replace him, it was a unanimous decision by selectors, but Srinivasan didn't allow it to happen.[148] Srinivasan's son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, who was team principal of CSK, was arrested for involvement in Spot-fixing and betting. Then unrecognised state association by BCCI, the Bihar Cricket Association, filed a petition against it for mismanagement and conflict of interest in its investigation of 2013 IPL corruption scandal. In 2013, Mumbai police arrested the Indian cricket team's regular player S. Sreesanth, other players and IPL team owners of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals for their dealings with the illegal betting industry.[149] In 2015, the Supreme Court appointed the Lodha Committee suspended Chennai Super Kings from the IPL for two years, and suspended Meiyappan from cricket activities for life.[150] In 2013, Rupa Gurunath—N Shrinivasan's daughter and Gurunath Meiyappan's wife—who was then president of Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, was found guilty of conflict of interest by the BCCI's ethics officer Justice D.K. Jain. In 2015, the Supreme Court of India barred Srinivasan from the BCCI for contesting elections due to his conflict of interests; the court also struck down the amendments of BCCI constitution that had allowed him to own and operate an IPL team.[citation needed] However he still owns the CSK franchise. In January 2015, Supreme court quashed BCCI's rule, which allowed its administrators to have financial interests in cash rich leagues such as Championship league, IPL etc. The court barred individuals including N Shrinivasan from BCCI election, who have financial interests in events organised by BCCI.[151]\n\nThe BCCI does not allow its contracted, non-contracted, national and domestic players to participate in any cricket leagues abroad. Only players who have retired from all formats of Indian cricket can take part in foreign leagues. Players such as Adam Gilchrist have questioned this policy. Indian players such as Suresh Raina and Robin Uthappa have urged the board to allow non-contracted players like them to participate in foreign leagues.[152][153]\n\nTax evasions\n\n[edit]\n\nBCCI has avoided paying taxes to the government on numerous occasions. One such instance was when it claimed itself to be a \"charitable organisation\", to avoid paying taxes and often disguises itself as a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO).[154] In 2014, Ministry of finance revealed that, there were as many as 213 cases of tax evasions of BCCI/IPL from 2009–10 to 2014, involving 261.64 Cr rupees.[155] In the 2010s, almost every year the Income Tax Department demanded the 'outstanding income tax' from the BCCI (see details - Tax payment ). Frequently till 2012, the board got exemptions for tax under the IT Act 1961 (section 11) but later Income tax department declared BCCI's earnings as commercial and listed them as business incomes.[156] During 2016 T20 world cup, Modi government gave them 10% exemption.[157] According to Deccan Herald's article on 19 December 2021, even though BCCI is one of the world's richest sports bodies and earns thousands of millions of rupees per year, it shows unwillingness to pay income taxes and finds loopholes in laws to avoid paying taxes.[158]\n\nPoliticians in the board\n\n[edit]\n\nPoliticians from multiple political parties have held positions within BCCI; Sharad Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party, Madhavrao Scindia of the Indian National Congress and Anurag Thakur of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were BCCI presidents, As of 2023 , latter's brother Arun Singh Dhumal is the IPL chairman. Jay Shah, the son of the Home Minister of India Amit Shah, is BCCI's secretary. Rajiv Shukla of the Congress party is its vice-president, he is in BCCI continuously since 2000s and held various top positions, he was IPL president from 2011 to 2017.[159] Ashish Shelar of BJP is the treasurer.[160]\n\nLodha committee reform\n\n[edit]\n\nThe BCCI has been criticised for its monopolistic practices, and has suffered from allegations of corruption and cronyism. [specify][which?][161] Supreme Court of India appointed a committee to make reforms in BCCI, headed by justice R. M. Lodha, the Lodha committee suggested many reforms to the BCCI, but BCCI did not implemented them as a result Supreme court removed officials of the BCCI.[162] On 30 January 2017, The Supreme Court of India nominated a four-member 'Committee of Administrators' (COA) composed of Vinod Rai, Ramachandra Guha, Vikram Limaye and Diana Edulji to administer the BCCI to implement Lodha Committee's reforms.[163] Vinod Rai, a retired civil servant and the former Comptroller and Auditor General of India, led the committee, which administered the board until elections could be conducted.[164][165][166]\n\nMany years BCCI consistently opposed to adhere regulations of the National Anti-Doping Agency, India (NADA). On 9 August 2019, it agreed to adhere the anti-doping mechanisms governed by the NADA.[167][168]\n\nRebel league\n\n[edit]\n\nThe rebel league the Indian Cricket League (ICL) was owned and operated by Essel Group. BCCI banned Indian players who played in the ICL, including Hemang Badani, Dinesh Mongia, Rohan Gavaskar and Ambati Rayudu, but later gave amnesty to these players and lifted theirs bans after they ended their ties with the ICL.[169][170][171] The BCCI blacklisted Essel Group company Zee Entertainment Enterprises due to this league, and expelled it from the BCCI in 2021. Zee was prohibited from buying BCCI's media rights.[172] In 2006, the BCCI sold the Indian cricket team's media rights to Zee for the 2006-11 period but after Essel Group initiated the ICL, the BCCI terminated this deal. Zee fought a long legal battle with the BCCI; on 12 March 2018, a tribunal headed by three judges found BCCI guilty and asked them to pay Zee ₹140 crores for losses. The tribunal found blacklisting of Zee by BCCI was illegal and said in judgement; \"To us it seems that BCCI was exploiting its dominating position in respect of game of cricket in India\" and also added Zee and its affiliated companies to the blacklist and banning them from participating in the BCCI bidding process was illegal.[173]\n\nVirat Kohli sacking\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2021 BCCI sacked Virat Kohli from ODI captaincy, then President Ganguly told media that the BCCI asked him to remain captain but Kohli was not interested. After which Kohli took a press conference and contradicted him (Ganguly), revealing that BCCI did not ask him to remain captain. In February 2023, in a sting operation of Zee News, then chief national selector Chetan Sharma, made shocking revelations, accusing Kohli of lying and in fact president Ganguly had told him to remain as captain, in a meeting in front of all the selectors. According to Sharma, Virat Kohli was considering himself bigger than BCCI and wanted to teach a lesson to the president of the BCCI. He also revealed that after Kohli resigned from T20 captaincy, BCCI decided to sack him from ODI captaincy as well because they did not want two separate captains for limited overs format.[174]\n\nSharma also alleged that lots of Indian players take injections to expedite their return in national team despite being 80 to 85% fit.[175] After few days he resigned from his post.[101]\n\nCriticism of BCCI and National selection committee\n\n[edit]\n\nBCCI and its selection committee are routinely slammed for irregularities in their selection process. Ideally, the national team's selectors should select players based upon their performance in all forms of domestic cricket but often a higher precedence is alleged to be given to the performance in the IPL, even in the selection of Test squads. This results in the de facto exclusion of players who regularly do well in domestic tournaments like the Ranji Trophy. In 2023 Sunil Gavaskar, Wasim Jaffer, Abhinav Mukund, media and many fans slammed BCCI for doing this, Gavaskar fumed said if you (BCCI-selectors) do not consider and choose best performers from Ranji trophy for India's Test team then stop organising it (Ranji trophy), then just organise IPL and select players from it.[176][177][178][179] Former India skipper Sourav Ganguly also has raised questions on selection process, while talking about appointment of Ajinkya Rahane as Test team's vice-captain for the 2023 West Indies tour. Rahane was dropped from the Test team for 18 months, then BCCI selected him in the squad for the 2023 World test championship final, and after playing just one game they (BCCI) made him vice-captain of the Test team; Ganguly said there should be \"consistency and continuity\" in selection process, this is \"difficult to understand\". Some also claim that BCCI's selectors use different yard stick for different players, they usually select players by looking their stardom, big name, past performance rather than current.[180][181] It is said that the selectors often choose players for national side by considering their one or two best innings in IPL, it seems awarding Indian cap (place in national team) has became[sic] an everydays affair. The position of the captain is also not fixed in the team, random players getting selected as captain, almost each bilateral series had new captain, it is evident by the fact that as of July 2022, the Indian team had 8 different people as captain in last 1 year, almost everyone who played in last 5 year for the team got opportunity to become national team's captain.[182] Venkatesh Prasad said \"There is no consistency in selection random stuff happening too much.\"[183] Since last 2 to 3 years, BCCI consistently doing experiments with the national team (senior men's team), numerous players got selected, but majority of them never got chance to play consistently, as a result of this, there is uncertainty in the one day team, apart from 3-4 players, its not certain who will get selected and who will not (Specially for world cup 2023). It is said that due to BCCI's experiments since 2019 world cup, the team yet not settled, even though 2023 world cup is 2.5 months away. The players are also inconsistent in their performance.[184]\n\nIn July 2023, BCCI has faced heavy criticism on social media for not broadcasting domestic tournaments such Deodhar trophy, Duleep trophy etc. on TV.[92]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe BCCI was featured in the Jersey, a 2019 Telugu language film in which the main protagonist Arjun (Nani) aspires to play for the India national cricket team and in the Ranji Trophy.[185]\n\nThis organisation was mentioned in M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016) Bollywood film.\n\nThe BCCI was a major talking point in comedian Hasan Minhaj's \"Cricket Corruption\" episode on the Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj. In \"Cricket Corruption\", Minhaj claims that the growth of Indian cricket is suppressing cricket's inclusivity and accessibility to fledgling nations (these are referred to as \"Associate Members\" by the ICC). He even opines that the financial successes of the IPL have launched the BCCI to a position where they now transcend the ICC in global cricketing power and influence.[186]\n\nThe BCCI was featured in Kabir Khan's 83 (2021), which is a Hindi-language sports drama film that chronicles India's against-all-odds victory in the 1983 Cricket World Cup. Albeit not by any means the central focus of the film, the BCCI are presented as an important organization in Indian cricket in supporting and promoting the game across the nation.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCricket in India\n\nBCCI Awards\n\nSport in India – Overview of sport in India\n\nList of national level sport governing bodies in India\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
