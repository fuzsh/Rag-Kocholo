She breathed her last today in Kolkata. I visited her at the hospital yesterday,” the chief minister wrote in a post on her X handle on Friday.\n\n“I came to know Nirmaladi well and have many sweet memories now. Her demise is a great loss in our public life. My deep condolences to Abhijit, Aniruddha, other family members including Esther Duflo (Abhijit’s wife), as well as Nirmaladi’s friends and students,” the chief minister wrote in her condolence message.\n\nBorn Nirmala Patankar in Maharashtra, the economist studied at the London School of Economics and worked as a professor at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences in Kolkata.\n\nHer husband, economist Dipak Banerjee, too studied at the London School of Economics, and was a professor at Presidency College in Kolkata.
