LA-2028ü•∞. Tom Cruise rappelled down from the top of the Stade de France, greeting Olympians after landing safely. Simone Biles then made a surprise appearance at the closing ceremony, playing a part in the passing of the Olympic flag from Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. The two gave the Olympic flag to Cruise who rode a motorcycle in a pre-filmed sequence that ended with the actor soaring above Los Angeles in a skydiving stunt. Aptly said by Sharad Sanghi - ‚ÄúThe Olympics are a powerful reminder of the spirit of competition and the dedication required to reach the highest levels. While not every competition ends in victory, each experience provides valuable lessons and opportunities for growth. In both sports and business, setbacks are inevitable. What truly matters is our ability to learn from them, adapt, and move forward with renewed determination. Let‚Äôs support our athletes and reflect on how their journey can inspire our own path to success.‚Äù\n\nThere is a perception that Elon Musk is not so good at public speaking. I tend to differ and find him very engaging and thoughtful. I find his \"style\" authentic. It is like a \"Miracle story\" of modern times. A shy boy, who lacked social skills and became one of earth's most powerful people. Have often seen highly successful and busy people are too preoccupied with what they will say to think about how they will present it. Many a times, I am baffled. Regardless of whether it is a post, tweet, interview, or speech, Elon Musk's content keeps us hooked. It‚Äôs often said he uses a lot of filler words and his voice lacks intonation. In an effort to understand how the world's richest and one of the most powerful people could be so poor at public speaking, he explained that he had Asperger's syndrome in childhood. His presentation may lack the sparkle of a virtuous speaker but offers important insights. Information that is not well articulated but is well researched by hard work and dedication. What are your thoughts?\n\nIf Inspiring Stories from Paris Olympics ! Arshad Nadeem wins Javelin Gold: How a whole Pakistan village collected money to send him to the Olympics The story of Arshad Nadeem, who gave Pakistan its first Olympics medal after 32 years, is as spectacular as his 92.7 meter throw in the Javelin final. Nadeem's journey is celebrated not because of institutional support but despite the lack thereof. When he took up javelin, Nadeem reportedly did not have much money. According to his father, Muhammad Ashraf, people pooled money so that he can train. Despite using outdated equipment and lacking access to proper gyms and training facilities, Nadeem secured Pakistan's first Olympic gold medal in 32 years. The 27-year-old Nadeem, the son of a retired construction worker and the third of eight siblings, was initially drawn to cricket like many Pakistanis. With no dedicated track and field facilities in Pakistan, athletes often train on cricket fields. In March, Nadeem disclosed that he had been using a single, damaged javelin for the past seven years. Earlier this year, when Nadeem appealed for a new javelin for training, Neeraj Chopra supported his cause on social media, highlighting the sportsmanship between the two athletes. After Neeraj Chopra's Mother Called Arshad Nadeem 'Her Son', Pakistan Star's Mom Wins Hearts. Arshad Nadeem's mother showered love on India's Neeraj Chopra after the duo secured top two spots in men's javelin throw final at Paris Olympics. The two javelin throwers share much in common, beyond the territorial divide of their countries and frosty ties. Both have a rural background and their careers have followed a near parallel path. Both have very different throwing techniques. ‚ÄúNeeraj is a springy thrower, Arshad is more of a strength thrower. He‚Äôs bigger, so, he has to use that,‚Äù said Bukhari. Arshad is 6'4 and weighs 100kg, while Neeraj is nearly 6ft tall and weighs 86kg.

Is a bronze medal valued more than a silver medal, by the winner? One of my HR friends aptly said often it‚Äôs about something Vs nothing and hence a source of real joy ! Have you noticed that a bronze medallist is generally more happy than a silver medalist at the end of the game? Its not incidental finding but proven fact in many research studies after studying reactions of silver medalists vs bronze medalists! Ideally, a silver medalist should be more happy than the bronze. But, human mind doesn't work like mathematics. This happens because of phenomenon of counterfactual thinking. A concept in psychology in which there is human tendency to create possible alternatives to life events that have already happened, that would be contrary to what happened. Sliver medalist thinks, \"Oh I couldn't win the gold medal.\" Bronze medalist thinks, \"At least I got a medal.\" Silver medal is won after losing, but Bronze medal is won after Winning. This happens in our life also, we don't appreciate what we have but feel sad with what we don't have. Let's be grateful for our blessings, they far outweigh our problems.\n\nA musical tribute to the golden voice of Kishore Da. A humble attempt to sing for him - In Yours Truly‚Äôs Voice. When I woke up on the morning of August 4, and was enjoying my cup of tea, glancing through the messages on my mobile, I refreshed my memory of his life and legacy. Then it occurred to me - it was the 95th birth anniversary of a legend, Kishore Kumar! Kishore Kumar's versatility, soulful voice, and emotive singing style touched the hearts of millions of listeners across the country and beyond. His contribution to Bollywood music is unparalleled, and he remains one of the most beloved and influential playback singers in Indian cinema till date. Abhas Kumar Ganguly, whom we know as Kishore Kumar in the world of films, is celebrating his 95th birthday today. An artist who was an actor, director, producer, musician, lyricist and singer. Such a great artist is born only once in a century. He had no training in classical music, so in the 50s and 60s, most musicians refused to recognize him as a singer. However, he sang many great songs under the music direction of Sachin Dev Burman (Haal Kaisa Hai Janaab Ka, Paanch Rupaiya Bara Aana Marega Bhaiya Nana, etc.). He also sang great songs under his own music direction in the 60s (Koi Humdum Na Raha, Main Hoon Jhoomjhoom Jhoomaru Bankar). The screeching crow also played the Dholak, came and hit the heart as if it were a knife, these nights, these weather, the river bank, this playful wind, the tantrums, ho ho woh to koi aur thi jo aankho mein, jeevan ke safar mein rahi milte hain bichhad jaane ko etc. Although he sang some popular songs like these, he could not gain much popularity. Songs like Mere Sapno Ki Rani Kab Aayengi Tu, Kora Kagaz Tha Ye Man Mera, Roop Tera Mastana from the 1969 film Aradhana made him a star singer overnight. He ruled the Hindi film music in the 70s and 80s and remained at the top till the end. Laxmikant Pyarelal got all the songs of the film Dharam Veer (1977) sung by Rafi Saab. Then director producer Manmohan Desai told Laxmikant Pyarelal that the era of Kishore Kumar is going on and it is not right if the film does not have Kishore Da's song. Then he got Kishore Kumar to sing the song \"Hum Banjaro Ki Baat Mat Poochho Ji\" which proved to be a super hit. Similarly, in the 1976 film Nagin, Laxmikant Pyarelal got all the songs sung by Rafi Saab. But one song sung by Kishore Kumar \"Tera Mera Mera Tera Mil Gaya Dil Dil Se\" proved to be a super hit. He received Filmfare Awards for the best singer eight times which no other singer could get. There is so much to learn from Kishore Da's singing that one should listen to the songs again and again and practice. Thanks Kishore Da: Thanks for inspiring. Music is truly a universal language that has the power to uplift and inspire. Singing has been shown to not only enhance lung function, but also to help beat stress, improve memory, build a sense of community, and boost confidence.\n\nThe research gathered responses from 24,000 women from over 560 participating small, medium and large companies. Nearly half the women in India Inc are either unsure about how long they will stay with their current employers, or plan to quit in two years, citing reasons such as bias and pay disparity, a study by consulting firm Aon said. Aon surveyed 24,000 women working in various companies, and the 47% who said they were unsure or would leave their employers in two years blamed the absence of an inclusive work culture, and limited career progression as some of the key reasons for their decision. \"Of the 47% who are unsure, 27% said they will not stay beyond 2 years and 20% said they are unsure about how long they will stay,\" Shilpa Khanna, associate partner and DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) practice leader of talent solutions in India for Aon, told Mint.

This might be the best Paris 2024 story: Zeng Zhiying made her Olympics debut at 58-years age! Born in China, she is now representing Chile in table tennis because of an incredible journey. At age 18, she expected to go to the Olympics for her birth country, China, as one of the best players in the world. But then table tennis changed out the two-sided paddles, and her game was thrown off. She never made the team and became incredibly frustrated with the sport. She retired from the game as a player at age 20. Shortly after, she moved to Chile and coached various table tennis teams. Then, in 2000, she decided to get a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù and step away from the game. For 20 years, she didn‚Äôt play. Then, in COVID, she bought a table and started playing again. She made it a goal to make the 2024 Olympics representing Chile. And, at age 58, she did it!\n\nWoke is being weaponised. A wake up call. Olympics allowed a biological man, Imane Khelif, to fight as a woman in Paris. Imane Khelif, boxer in middle of Olympics gender storm, forces tearful first opponent to quit 46 seconds into fight. Imane Khelif‚Äòs first fight will do nothing to calm the controversy around the boxer‚Äôs entrance into the 2024 Paris Olympics. Khelif, an Algerian who failed gender eligibility tests at the 2023 World Championships, forced her Italian opponent, Angela Carini, to withdraw from their opening-round bout in 46 seconds. Imane allegedly broke the nose of Female Italian Boxer Angela Carini. Entire World in SH0CK. Italian Boxer abandoned the battle, which is uncommon in Olympic boxing. She threw her helmet onto the floor, abandoned the clash, and yelled, ‚ÄòThis is unjust.‚Äô HUMBLE ANGELA CARINI : \"I am nobody to say its illegal\" She emotionally discusses winning for her late father after securing a spot at the Paris Olympics. This is the purest form of evil unfolding right before our eyes. A man was allowed to beat up a woman on a global stage, crushing her life‚Äôs dream while fighting for her deceased father This delusion must end. Man is legally allowed to bash a woman sport. Where are the Feminists and #MeToo gang? Tongue in cheek? More Woke, more #DEI - It‚Äôs purely a case of thinking good, doing bad. Common sense is not common these days."
