        "text": "Pranav Pandya have a certain amount of philosophy in Pranav Pandya's character but it lies dormant a good deal of the time. Pranav Pandya are large-hearted and sincere, though a trifle blunt. Pranav Pandya are somewhat proud and people who ponder to Pranav Pandya's vanity become Pranav Pandya's best friends.Pranav Pandya have high ideals which cannot be realised. When they fail, Pranav Pandya allow Pranav Pandya'sself to be considerably dejected. There is a streak of restlessness in Pranav Pandya, which causes Pranav Pandya to cast aside an ideal before it has had sufficient time to mature. Consequently, Pranav Pandya do not attain the success in life, nor the happiness and comfort, that Pranav Pandya's qualities merit.Pranav Pandya know how to express Pranav Pandya's opinions in public and Pranav Pandya have a neat gift for being humorous. It follows that Pranav Pandya are credited by Pranav Pandya's friends as being jolly good company. Certainly Pranav Pandya are entertaining. Pranav Pandya's friends by the way, have considerable influence on Pranav Pandya and it is highly necessary that Pranav Pandya should chose them wisely and deliberately.Pranav Pandya's greatest failing is that Pranav Pandya are versatile and that Pranav Pandya's energies are directed into too many channels. Concentrate on fewer branches of work and pleasure, and Pranav Pandya will greatly benefit by the change.\n\nPranav Pandya have the ability to seeing through anything or anyone, so it is very difficult to hide anything from Pranav Pandya. This clarity of insight assists in the overcoming of opposition and the achievement of satisfaction. Pranav Pandya have a quick grasp of any situation and the ability to solve any problem, for Pranav Pandya go directly to the point.Pranav Pandya stick to Pranav Pandya's aim and do not feel pressured easily. Pranav Pandya will be renowned as a great intellectual in the society because of the knowledge and education Pranav Pandya have pursued. Even if Pranav Pandya renounce the other aspects of life, Pranav Pandya should not abandon Pranav Pandya's knowledge. This priority will keep Pranav Pandya ahead of others in life. Pranav Pandya will receive the guidance of many learned people which will benefit Pranav Pandya's studies. The knowledge Pranav Pandya have acquired is an innate talent, which is why Pranav Pandya should try to imbibe some of it in Pranav Pandya's personal life in the process of becoming a better human being. The urge to acquire knowledge will keep Pranav Pandya at the top and Pranav Pandya will be listed among great intellectuals. Sometimes, Pranav Pandya's education can remain at stake because of Pranav Pandya's independent attitude, which is why Pranav Pandya should try to reform this aspect of Pranav Pandya's personality."
