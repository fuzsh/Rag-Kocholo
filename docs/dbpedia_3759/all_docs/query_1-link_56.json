        "text": "Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay, a sitting judge of the Calcutta High Court, drew the attention of the entire legal fraternity as he announced his intent to resign from his position as a judge. The dramatic revelation wasn't due to any sense of dissatisfaction with the judicial system or the pressures of the position. Rather, the judge cited his eagerness to engage in politics as the driving force behind his resignation.\n\nSpeaking to the media, days before tendering his resignation, Justice Gangopadhyay said, \"For the past couple of years, I was dealing with some matters in which huge corruption had been unearthed. I feel like my duty as a judge is now over. This is a call of my conscience that now I should go to the people. In our country and in West Bengal, there are a large number of people who cannot come to court. Only politicians can do something to help them. I want to work for those people now.\"\n\nJustice Gangopadhyay's decision came amidst a turbulent political situation in West Bengal, under the current Trinamool Congress (TMC) government led by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.\n\nJUSTICE GANGOPADHYAY's APPOINTMENT\n\nJustice Abhijit Gangopadhyay was born in Kolkata on August 20, 1962 into a family of lawyers. He pursued his early education at Mitra Institution, a Bengali-medium school in Kolkata, completing his schooling in 1979.\n\nHe then went on to study law at Hazra Law College, Kolkata, where he also developed a passion for Bengali theatre, actively participating in productions with the theatre group \"Amitra Chanda\" until 1986.\n\nHe began his professional journey as a West Bengal Civil Service officer in Uttar Dinajpur district of West Bengal, but soon moved back to Kolkata and transitioned to practising law in the Calcutta High Court.\n\nHe was appointed as an additional judge by the High Court on May 2, 2018 and was subsequently confirmed as a permanent judge on July 30, 2020.\n\nORDERED MULTIPLE CBI INVESTIGATIONS\n\nThe 61-year-old judge at the Calcutta High Court is most popularly known for ordering multiple investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into numerous cases related to the West Bengal teachers' recruitment scam.\n\nHe issued directives for filing of FIRs and midnight interrogations of the accused, including ministers and education board chairpersons.\n\nNot content with mere inquiries, Justice Gangopadhyay criticised the sluggish pace of the probe and urged authorities to catch the \"real culprits\".\n\nHis bold actions led to the arrest of high-profile political figures, including three Trinamool Congress MLAs and over a dozen government officials implicated in the scam. He annulled over 4,000 illegally made appointments, compelling the state government to disclose manipulated candidate marks from 2014 to 2020.\n\nThrough his courtroom declarations and his media interviews, Justice Gangopadhyay expressed his unwavering commitment to combat corruption, asserting his fearlessness in the face of potential criticism or expulsion from the judiciary.\n\nIn early 2022, following CBI investigations initiated by Justice Gangopadhyay into the school recruitment scam, the division bench of Justices Harish Tandon and Rabindranath Samanta halted the proceedings. Later, Gangopadhyay, in an order, criticised the division bench's action as displaying a \"highest degree of double standard\".\n\nHe also questioned the benefit of restraining a single judge despite clear findings of serious illegalities and corruption.\n\nGangopadhyay expressed frustration, stating his \"hands are tied from taking further steps\".\n\nAdditionally, he lodged a complaint to the Chief Justice of India against the division bench's interference. In his order, Gangopadhyay wrote, \"I also do not understand who would be benefited by tying up the hands of the single judge when it has been made clear that this court has found that there are serious illegalities in giving recommendations to ineligible candidates and the tip of the corruption-iceberg in issuing illegal recommendations is seen which is getting gradually bigger.\"\n\nWhile on one hand, he imposed immense faith in the CBI to probe cases, on the other hand, he did not hold back when it came to criticising the CBI either.\n\nOne of the major talking points of Justice Gangopadhyay's tenure has been his controversial statements against the probe agency, not very long after he handed over cases related to the school recruitment scam to the CBI.\n\nHe criticised the time taken and the quality of the investigation, questioning the \"inordinate delay\" and the laxity in the gathering of evidence about the scam.\n\n\"Just because you are the premier investigating agency, does it mean you will take 20 years for an investigation?\" asked Gangopadhyay. He also sternly warned the agency of intervention, saying, if they do not speed up their pace in two weeks, he might have to intervene and \"assume a role which I otherwise should not.\"\n\nAt one point, Justice Gangopadhyay had also openly questioned the integrity and impartiality of the CBI, while dealing with a case related to the Saradha scam involving several high-profile politicians from Bengal.\n\nTHE TEACHERS' RECRUITMENT SCAM\n\nIn April 2022, members of the TMC workers' legal wing in West Bengal obstructed the entrance to the Calcutta High Court, preventing lawyers from accessing Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay's courtroom. They accused the judge of wrongdoing in his rulings on the School Service Commission (SSC) corruption case.\n\nA division bench of the High Court later intervened and stayed Justice Gangopadhyay's order directing the (then) West Bengal minister Partha Chatterjee to appear before the CBI, in connection with irregularities in the appointment of assistant teachers.\n\nLater, Justice Gangopadhyay authorised the CBI to arrest the minister and, in his order, stated that Chatterjee could not evade investigation in the wake of hospitalisation. In response, the Calcutta High Court Bar Association passed a resolution to boycott Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay.\n\nHeated exchanges with the lawyers in his courtroom were common occurrences for Justice Gangopadhyay. However, in August 2022, during a particularly tense altercation with the Calcutta Bar Association President, Arunava Ghosh, Justice Gangopadhyay defied all traditional courtroom protocol, when he turned to the reporters in the room and instructed them to start recording the exchange on their mobile phones.\n\nGhosh, objecting to the breach of protocol, reminded the judge that videography was not permitted inside the courtroom. Undeterred, Gangopadhyay insisted on allowing it in his courtroom, asserting his authority. But the lawyer, too, did not hold back, saying, \"Your lordship is a very honest man, but my lord, don't turn the court into a bazaar. This is earning a very bad name for you in the Bar.\"\n\nHe went a step further and voiced apprehensions regarding journalists visiting the judge's chambers, emphasising the importance of upholding decorum within the judiciary.\n\nIn 2023, Justice Gangopadhyay ordered the arrest of lawyer Prasenjit Mukherjee, for alleged criminal contempt, after he referenced a division-bench judgment that modified a single bench's ruling.\n\nFollowing the incident, the Bar Association expressed concern over what they termed as the \"extreme insult\" suffered by Mukherjee.\n\nThey highlighted that Justice Gangopadhyay had found Mukherjee guilty of contempt, publicly disrobed him, and sent him to civil prison under the custody of the sheriff directly from the courtroom. The Bar Association subsequently urged Chief Justice TS Sivagnanam to withdraw all judicial work from Justice Gangopadhyay's court, fearing similar treatment for other members.\n\nIn response, the Calcutta High Court held a special late evening hearing, during which the division bench stayed the directive for Mukherjee's arrest.\n\nJUSTICE GANGOPADHYAY’s CRITICISM OF TMC\n\nIn November 2022, during proceedings on the recruitment scam case, Justice Gangopadhyay, who was an open critic of the West Bengal government, expressed serious concerns over the alleged interference with the Constitution, stating, \"No one has the right to (mess) with the Constitution.\"\n\nWhat shocked the lawyers and journalists was when Justice Gangopadhyay hinted at the possibility of seeking the Election Commission's intervention to revoke the Trinamool Congress's recognition as a political party and withdraw its logo.\n\nOutraged, TMC MP and advocate Kalyan Bandopadhyay strongly criticised the judge's remarks, asserting that they lacked moral authority and were unrelated to the case at hand. He emphasised the need for judicial discipline and adherence to the law, suggesting that any significant decisions should be delivered through written orders.\n\nSimilarly, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh accused Justice Gangopadhyay of overstepping his judicial role and engaging in political activism, labelling him as \"Aranyadeb Gangopadhyay\" or \"Phantom Gangopadhyay\".\n\nGhosh argued that while judicial oversight of governmental actions was necessary, commenting on the recognition of political parties exceeded the judge's mandate.\n\nLater, in September 2023, during a hearing on Covid compensation, Justice Gangopadhyay raised concerns about the source of wealth of an unnamed individual, mentioning a \"Bhaipo\" (nephew) with a valuable four-storeyed house. He queried, \"One gets a compensation of Rs 2 lakh after dying from consuming illicit liquor. How much does one get after dying of Covid? Is anyone given the money (compensation) at all?\"\n\nSoon after, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh called for the resignation of Justice Gangopadhyay, suggesting he should join politics instead.\n\nBut, the judge had a 'love-hate relationship' with the TMC, just as in the case of the CBI.\n\nIn December 2022, Justice Gangopadhyay praised Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her commendable efforts and declared his intention to abstain from further commentary on the government's functioning.\n\nDuring a courtroom session, he expressed his reluctance to make any adverse remarks against the Chief Minister, stating, \"The Chief Minister is doing good work. Why would I make adverse comments against her?\"\n\nHe further conveyed his decision to a lawyer representing the state government, instructing them to inform Chandrimadi Bhattacharya, a member of Mamata's cabinet, that he would refrain from any further commentary criticising the state government.\n\nThis extended beyond the judge's courtroom.\n\nOne month after promising in open court that he would refrain from any further criticism of Mamata and her government, in January 2023, while participating in a public event, Justice Gangopadhyay criticised the publicity for Mamata Banerjee's poems, suggesting that libraries should refrain from promoting such content.\n\nJUSTICE GANGOPADHYAY’s TRYST WITH MEDIA\n\nIn September 2022, a Bangla news channel's interview with Justice Gangopadhyay sparked a controversy. While opinion amongst legal experts was divided on whether a sitting High Court judge should engage in such interviews, the judge's remarks further intensified the debate within political circles.\n\nDuring the interview, Justice Gangopadhyay suggested that Trinamool Congress General Secretary Abhishek Banerjee should face a three-month jail term for alleging collusion between a section of the judiciary and the BJP.\n\nThis was particularly startling for two reasons – one, Justice Gangopadhyay, at the time, was dealing with politically sensitive cases involving the TMC and two, because it was unheard of for a sitting High Court judge to speak about ongoing cases.\n\nLater, defending his actions, Gangopadhyay cited 'The Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct', asserting that judges have freedom of expression, but must operate within the bounds of the law.\n\nHe declared his fearlessness, expressing readiness to face criticism or even removal from the judiciary, emphasising his commitment to combat corruption, which he believes has plagued India.\n\nIn the interview, Justice Gangopadhyay also expressed his desire to leave a lasting legacy through his judgments, stating, \"I want to pass a few judgments which, long after I am gone, will come up before a researcher who will realise that there was a judge who did these.\"\n\nLater, he faced immense criticism from the Supreme Court, when Chief Justice of India, DY Chandrachud, said, \"A judge has no business to give an interview about pending cases.\"\n\nAs the Supreme Court further reviewed his interview, it asked the Calcutta High Court to reassign all cases related to the West Bengal school jobs scam to another judge.\n\nWHEN JUSTICE GANGOPADHYAY QUESTIONED ANOTHER JUDGE\n\nIn September 2023, Justice Gangopadhyay raised questions in an open courtroom about the potential involvement of a former Supreme Court judge in connection with the Bengal primary teachers' recruitment scam.\n\nGangopadhyay queried whether the CBI could investigate the retired Supreme Court judge, suggesting a possible understanding between him and the arrested accused, Manik Bhattacharya, in the ongoing probe. Bhattacharya, the former chief of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education, had previously stayed Gangopadhyay's order directing the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to investigate him. Gangopadhyay expressed concern that delays in addressing these matters in the Supreme Court were allowing the culprits to exploit the situation.\n\nEarlier this year, in January 2024, the tensions within the Calcutta High Court reached a breaking point when Justice Gangopadhyay accused a division bench judge of displaying partisan behavior in a politically sensitive case.\n\nJustice Gangopadhyay publicly criticised the division bench's order as \"wholly illegal\" and personally targeted one of the judges, Justice Soumen Sen. In an order dated January 25, in connection with a CBI inquiry into an alleged caste certificate scam in the state's medical recruitment process, Justice Gangopadhyay took an unprecedented step, citing his duty to uphold the judiciary's sanctity.\n\nHe alleged that Justice Sen had interfered politically by instructing another judge \"not to disturb\" Trinamool leader Abhishek Banerjee.\n\nHe accused Sen of advancing the interests of a political party and called for a re-evaluation of orders involving the state. The judge also urged the registrar general to forward copies of his order to the Chief Justice of India and the Calcutta High Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court was compelled to step in in less than 24 hours. A five-judge bench led by the Chief Justice of India stayed all the proceedings before both the judges and transferred the case to itself.\n\nAt the time, Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud had appealed to the lawyers to refrain from making comments casting aspersions on either of the two judges.\n\n\"Let's not, after all we are dealing with a High Court judge, casting aspersions on either judge would be improper. Anything we say here shall not impinge on the dignity of the High Court, the CJI said."
