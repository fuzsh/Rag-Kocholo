        "text": "After eight years, the absurdity of the deportation process of Abu Hamza still grinds on.\n\nHamza has been kept under police supervision, and detention, without trial for eight years. This is a shocking indictment of the extent to which we have forgotten our long held traditions and values of civil liberties. Further we have allowed them to be undermined through allowing mass immigration without a framework of assimilation.\n\nIt is an embarrassment, but also at a deeper level significantly worrying. It is precisely because of the lack of assimilation of foreign cultures that we have had to put away one of the most important developments in English law: the right not to be detained without trial.\n\nWithout this right, we live in the state of tyrants, where any man can be detained against his will without due process at the whim of the state.\n\nThese values are not deeply rooted in some of the countries that migrants come from, as institutions in the developing world are weakly financed and corruption is sometimes standard practice. The result is that migrants who are not used to modern institutions can have either no value or knowledge of them, or as in Hamza's case, absolute contempt.\n\nIt is odd seeing someone like Hamza using the European Court of Human Rights, when he does not either believe in rights (a concept created in the Western Enlightenment) or the rule of law that governs the basis of that court’s philosophy.\n\nThis exception to the normal laws of natural justice has occurred precisely because of unassimilated immigration. Islamic radicalisation of young people is the result of not being assertive enough about all the great things in British culture. Hamza should be looked at as a lunatic by young people, not as a leadership figure. No doubt if a strong program of assimilation was put together as part of our immigration policy, then we could have avoided the most extraordinary mass atrocity in recent times in the British Isles: namely the 7/7 bombing.\n\nSadly our lack of affirming our history, for example, by not having compulsory history and cultural lessons in schools - and instead having lessons about other cultures causes a lack of knowledge among migrants about their new country.\n\nThis is why they grow-up practising and championing practices such as Sharia that are at odds with the Western liberal tradition.\n\nYet sharia tribunals are still being used in Britain today to deal with divorces, where women are marginalised during proceedings.\n\nFew of our politicians understand or appreciate what the Enlightenment was, and how important it was to the civilisation of our Islands. Perhaps under some form of racism they do not want migrants or their descendants to have them.\n\nIt is the lack of fervent assertion of British values that isolates some children of migrants from mainstream society. It has also undermined the existence of traditional British civil liberties in the British Isles.\n\nWe need a strong assimilation policy framework in schools, particularly in the inner-cities, but also the important firm statement of policy: 'change, assimilate or get lost'. Much more of this is needed if we are to stop the existence and proliferation of another generation of Hamzas. If we can’t say this, we will deserve to lose our history, and our liberties, for having shown no value for them.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hugh Milroy, a hugely influential expert on displaced veterans, there is a complete lack of fairness in the process of determining the immigration status of Commonwealth ex-service personnel.\n\nSome of these men and women have spent over 5 years serving in the British Army and many have done operational tours.\n\nDeeply concerning is the fact that while waiting to have their immigration status determined they do not qualify for benefits, despite dodging bullets for the flag and, shockingly, despite having paid national insurance and tax.\n\nMany of these ex-service personnel, and their families, are actually being housed and fed by Veteran’s Aid, a charity run by Dr. Milroy.\n\nDr. Milroy sums this up as ‘one of the colossal national scandals of our times, when you think of the amount of foreigners who have access to benefits with relative ease within days of arriving at the country’.\n\nRecently a family of nine Bulgarian gypsies who targeted the UK for benefits were housed in social housing within three weeks.\n\nDespite this, the Army still actively recruits from the Commonwealth. For example, until very recently the Fijian Times online carried adverts for the British Army and Royal Marines. The British Army website has a section encouraging foreign nationals to serve. Alas this, post-service, treatment does great disservice to the fantastic institution that is the British Army, and undermines the Army’s attempts to reach out globally for talent.\n\nThe lack of a welfare support structure to help guide Foreign and Commonwealth servicemen through the settlement application process leaves many in a legal and financial limbo and causes acute distress. Milroy likens it to making them ‘disposable people’.\n\nSome face criminal charges for serving Britain because by serving in a ‘foreign military’ – such as ours – for example, Botswana citizens who join the British Army are in breach of a Foreign Enlistment Act that leaves them open to arrest and imprisonment if deported back.\n\nThus they are often forced to stay without any social services in Britain because they have served for Britain. This cannot be allowed to continue. As to the related issue of forced deportations, one soldier, Fijian engineer Bale Baleiwai, whose wife is British, is being denied residence because he had a brawl with another soldier. Not an unknown event in the Army.\n\nThe UK Border Agency equated his single internal Army disciplinary matter to a criminal conviction - ignoring his skills as an engineer and the fact that he served honourably for 13 years in the British Army.\n\nSapper Poloko Hiri was refused citizenship because of a speeding offence that rendered him a ‘foreign criminal’ and faces imprisonment if he is deported to Botswana. (His case, like Baleiwai’s, is being appealed, but he had to apply for asylum to remain in the UK long enough to do this legally and the only organisation that helped him was Veterans Aid).\n\nOn the face of it, these cases illustrate a gross injustice. But the lack of fairness is in the process, not the\n\nUKBA’s right to determine who should stay in Britain.\n\nMilroy describes it as lack of proportionality – with no single organisation to blame.\n\nIf the UK Border Agency does have flexibility, it is not being exercised or supervised in any way that makes sense.\n\nIt is clearly unable, through legislative and administrative failings, to appropriately weigh good conduct against bad. The Government is responsible for this.\n\nIt is odd that there is not a Home Office delegated internal specific immigration guideline document for foreign nationals who have served for a long period of time in the British Armed forces. It would be basic common decency to apply different, lenient guidelines, for non-serious offences when determining immigration issues.\n\nDr. Milroy is adamant that the Government’s covenant to treat soldiers with appropriate respect commensurate to their extraordinary service to this country is turning into all but hot air. This is particularly in relation to the Commonwealth soldiers, many of whom are being supported by VeteransAid. They have been helping with such cases for nearly 5 years.\n\nThis must come to an end with appropriate amendments, and creation of exceptions, to social security access during the process of determining their grant of residence and citizenship rights.\n\nWhen the 82 year old Hollywood legend, Clint Eastwood, spoke at the Republican Convention last week the liberal (left-wing) media of the States attacked him as being mad, old and deluded.\n\nThis was a result of Clint Eastwood, once the man with no name, talking to an invisible man. Eastwood’s performance with the invisible man was an accurate representation of Democratic politics and its complete failures to make any difference on domestic problems.\n\nIn making this assertion Eastwood was spot on. With unemployment so high for one of the world's largest economies, metamophing a caricature of the President as an absent leader was more than apt.\n\nAs Eastwood pointed out Obama had dithered over Guantanamo, he had botched over Afghanistan (despite assurances to the contrary) and most shockingly of all, has left the most powerful economy in the world with 23 Million unemployed.\n\nColossal unemployment will be the President’s downfall.\n\nAfter all, which American cares about free health care, when they can not even get a job, pay for adequate supplies for the larder and are constantly receiving no luck in job applications? Eastwood’s subtly was pointing at just that- a President that it is completely out of touch with the needs of his people.\n\nIf Americans have really understood Obama’s failures, the Republicans are very likely to gain office in November. Not just because of the economic crisis, but the emerging megastar that is Paul Ryan.\n\nRyan hails from a background of real endeavour. Ryan was forced to work in McDonalds as a teenager to help his mother maintain the household. It is Ryan is making the credible and difficult policy arguments that politicians in the United Kingdom have so far evaded.\n\nRyan is an example of a human being with real grit, determination and one with an experience of what it is like to live in hard times. He has experienced hardship in the way millions of Americans that have been stranded by Obama now do.\n\nThat gives the Republicans an edge of having a voice that is real, tangible and palpable- over Obama’s media spin.\n\nThis will result in Eastwood’s caricature having one other element of truth in it by the end of the year: Obama invisible from the White House."
