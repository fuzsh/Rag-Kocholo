Paired transient elastography (TE) and Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) measurements were performed at baseline and 3-year. Fibrosis progression and regression were defined as increase and decrease in ≥ 1 fibrosis stage, respectively.\n\nResults: In this interim analysis, 40 cases and 142 controls were recruited [median age 55.6 (interquartile range IQR 49.8–60.9), 53.8% male]. The median liver stiffness (LS) values were similar between the two groups at baseline (5.4 vs. 5.2 kPa, p = 0.765) and at 3-years (5.9 vs. 5.5 kPa, p = 0.455) respectively. The baseline controlled attenuation parameter values were significantly higher in cases vs controls (288 vs 251 dB/m, respectively, p = 0.001). The median ELF at 3-year was significantly higher than baseline in the controls (8.6 vs. 8.4, p = 0.033). All patients with severe steatosis had significantly higher baseline LS (5.9 vs. 4.8 kPa; p < 0.001), 3-year LS (6.4 vs 5.2 kPa; p < 0.001), and baseline ELF (8.8 vs. 8.3, p = 0.028). The proportion of patients with fibrosis progression (25.6% vs. 15.5%, respectively, p = 0.111) and regression (10.3% vs. 14.8%, p = 0.604) was similar in cases vs controls.\n\nConclusion: Over a period of 3 years, fibrosis regression and progression were observed at a similar rate in patients with HBsAg seroclearance compared to patients with inactive CHB. Severe hepatic steatosis was associated with higher LS and ELF.\n\nHepatitis C\n\n2 Genotype and Serotype Analysis on Potential Hepatitis B Virus as a Candidate Sequence for Hepatitis B Vaccine in Web-Based Bioinformatics\n\nMr Rifaldy Fajar1, Ms. Prihantini Jupri1, Ms Nana Indri Kurniastuti1\n\n1Yogyakarta State University, Sleman, Indonesia\n\nObjectives: This study aims to determine the genotype and serotype of the hepatitis B virus that has potential as a hepatitis B vaccine candidate. One effective method at present is bioinformatics, a multidisciplinary web-based biological science that can explore various sequences and see phylogeny.\n\nMethods: The first stage is the collection and selection of nucleotide DNA sequences or hepatitis B virus amino acids. All data on nucleotide DNA sequences and hepatitis B virus amino acids with the target genotype and serotype are accessed and collected from GenBank. Next, a kinship tree is made. This kinship tree is designed with multiple alignments, phylogeny, and tree viewers using phylogeny.fr.\n\nResults: The data obtained shows that there are 43 sequences with the same subtype, Adw, but the genotype and distribution of the spread of the hepatitis B virus are different. Genotype A originates from Somalia (Africa), and the Philippines (Asia), genotype B originates from Indonesia and China. Genotype C explains that genotype C is found around South Asia and East Asia, genotype H obtained information from America and Mexico, and genotype I originates from China.\n\nConclusions: Sequence data that can be candidates for hepatitis B vaccine design are hepatitis B virus genotype B with subgenotype B3, genotype C with subgenotype C6 for the scope of Indonesia, while for the scope of the world obtained the potential of the Adw serotype.\n\nHepatobiliary Neoplasia\n\n3 Novel miRNA-based drug CD5-2 reduces liver tumour growth in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-treated mice by normalising tumour vasculature and altering immune infiltrate\n\nDr Ken Liu1, Dr Yang Zhao2, Dr Jinbiao Chen1, Ms Jade Boland1, Dr Ka Ka Ting2, Prof Jennifer Gamble2, Prof Geoffrey McCaughan1\n\n1Liver Injury and Cancer Program, Centenary Institute, Sydney, Australia, 2Centre for the Endothelium, Vascular Biology Program, Centenary Institute, Sydney, Australia\n\nObjectives: Normalisation of leaky tumour vasculature is an emerging approach to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Blockmir CD5-2 is an oligonucleotide-based inhibitor of the miR-27a interaction with VE-Cadherin, the endothelial specific cadherin. We studied the effect of CD5-2 combined with checkpoint inhibition in the DEN-induced liver tumour mouse model.\n\nMaterials and methods: DEN was given (25 mg/kg intraperitoneally) to male C57BL/6 mice at postnatal day 14. CD5-2 (30 mg/kg intravenously fortnightly) and/or anti-PD1 antibody (250 µg intraperitoneally every 4 days) with their respective controls (4 groups) were given to the mice from age 7-months until harvest at age 9-months.\n\nResults: Human HCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas showed high miR-27a and low VE-Cadherin were both associated with poorer survival (Log-Rank p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively). In untreated mice, miR-27a expression was significantly increased in tumours compared to adjacent normal tissue. Mice treated with CD5-2 + anti-PD1 antibody had significantly smaller tumours (50% reduction) compared to mice treated with either agent alone, controls, or untreated mice. Histologically, tumours in the CD5-2 + anti-PD1 antibody group exhibited a more favourable immune infiltrate (significantly higher CD3 + and CD8 + T cells and lower Ly6G + neutrophils) compared to tumours from other groups. Tumours in CD5-2-treated mice had less leaky vasculature (extravasation of Dextran beads) and tumour hypoxia (carbonic anhydrase IX staining) compared to non-CD5-2-treated mice.\n\nConclusion: In the DEN mouse model, CD5-2 normalised liver tumour vasculature and reduced tumour hypoxia. CD5-2 plus anti-PD1 antibody reduced tumour size possibly by altering the immune infiltrate to being immunosupportive.\n\nNAFLD and NASH\n\n4 Novel non-invasive risk prediction model for significant Coronary artery disease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\n\nDr Devika Madhu1, Dr Krishnadas Devadas1, Dr Narendranathan Maniyalath1\n\n1Trivandrum Medical College, Kerala, India, Trivandrum, India\n\nObjective: To devise a highly sensitive and specific non-invasive model comprising CIMT to predict risk for significant coronary artery disease in patients with NAFLD\n\nMaterials and methods: A nested case–control study was done on 140 NAFLD subjects identified from 250 patients who underwent coronary angiography. Logistic regression analysis was performed to find variables in risk prediction model. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve plotted to derive best model.\n\nResults: Of 140 NAFLD patients, 82 had significant CAD and 58 normal coronaries. Male gender (p < 0.001), systemic hypertension (p = 0.045), waist to hip ratio (p = 0.045) and mean carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) (p = 0.042) were independent predictors of CAD in NAFLD on multivariate analysis. A novel risk model, CIMT plus score, was developed comprising these variables with Area under ROC (AUROC) of 0.909 (95% CI 0.849 to 0.951). Optimized cut off > 11 had a sensitivity and specificity of 90.2% (95% CI 81.7–95.7) and 84.5% (95% CI 72.6–92.7) respectively and likelihood ratio of 5.82 (3.2–10.6) in predicting risk for significant CAD in NAFLD. CIMT plus score performed better than CIMT (∆AUROC = 0.234 (95% CI 0.142–0.326) (p < 0.0001)).\n\nConclusions: “CIMT plus score” is a novel non-invasive model to predict the risk for significant CAD in NAFLD. Those identified to be at high risk should be managed with aggressive preventive strategies to reduce future cardiovascular events. Prospective randomised studies are required for external validation.\n\nPortal Hypertension and Other Complications of Cirrhosis\n\n5 Psoas muscle index: a simple and reliable method of sarcopenia assessment and mortality predictor on CT scan in patients with chronic liver disease\n\nDr Gajanan Rodge1, Dr Usha Goenka1, Dr Rachit Agarwal1, Dr Shivaraj Afzalpurkar1, Dr Bhavik Bharat Shah1, Dr Surabhi Jajodia1, Dr Mahesh Kumar Goenka1\n\n1Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Kolkata, India\n\nObjective: L3 SMI is the conventional method for sarcopenia assessment. Recently, psoas muscle parameters have been proposed as a simple and quick method. Aim of this study was to assess sarcopenia & predict mortality in cirrhotics by psoas muscle quantification.\n\nMaterial and Methods: One hundred and fifty patients underwent CT scan and psoas muscle index (PMI) was calculated: [PMI = Total psoas muscle area (mm)/(Height)2 (m)]. Cut off values for diagnosis of sarcopenia were derived from control group (n = 75). Cases included consecutive CLD patients (n = 75) who underwent CT scan. Hand Grip (HG) dynamometer was used to assess HG strength.\n\nResults: Sarcopenia assessed by PMI was seen in 36% (n = 27) of CLD patients. Ascites, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and gastro-intestinal bleed was seen in 48%, 18.7% and 24% respectively. Association of sarcopenia was statistically significant with ascites and HE (p < 0.05). Sarcopenia was significantly higher in patients with CHILD C. HG weakness was seen in 41.3% and mid-arm muscle circumference was low in 25.3% of CLD patients. 53 out of 75 patients completed the follow up period of 1 year. Out of the sarcopenia patients, 77.8% (n = 7) succumbed to liver related illness, while 22.2% (n = 2) without sarcopenia expired during follow-up. Association of 1 year mortality and sarcopenia was statistically significant (p value = 0.01). Kappa measure of agreement between HG and sarcopenia assessment was 0.608 (good strength).\n\nConclusions: PMI sarcopenia proved to be a reliable predictor of mortality. HG dynamometer seems to be a good alternative for sarcopenia assessment.\n\nPortal Hypertension and Other Complications of Cirrhosis\n\n6 The effects of 12-week home-based exercise training on aerobic capacity, muscle mass and quality of life in patients with liver cirrhosis: a randomized clinical trial\n\nMr Pavapol Sirisunhirun1, Ms Wimolrak Bandidniyamanon1, Mr Yonworanut Jeerachatakorn2, Ms Kobkun Muangsomboon3, Mr Supot Nimanong1, Mr Taweesak Tanwandee1, Mr Phunchai Charatcharoenwitthaya1, Ms Siwaporn Chainuvati1, Mr Watcharasak Chotiyaputta1\n\n1Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, 2Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, 3Department of Radiology, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University\n\nBackground: Physical inactivity and sarcopenia are predictors of mortality in cirrhotic patients. The aim of this study is to prove the benefit of home-based exercise in cirrhotic patients\n\nMaterials and methods: This is a randomized controlled study including cirrhotic pts with Child–Pugh A. Patients were randomized to home-based exercise training (HPET) (N = 20) or control (N = 20) for 12 weeks. HPET includes high intensity interval trainings (keep 60–80% of maximum HR). The primary aim was the changes in 6 min-walk test (6MWT). Secondary aims were the changes in thigh muscle thickness (TMT), liver stiffness (LS) and splenic stiffness (SS), and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ).\n\nResults: Total 40 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 56.3 (± 7.8) years. Chronic hepatitis B and C were the major cause of cirrhosis. Mean baseline 6MWT was 475.2 (± 70.4) m. Mean LS and SS was 15.3 (± 9.3), 29.8 (± 21.7) kPa respectively. Mean TMT was 1.76 (± 0.4) cm. At the end of the study, the changes in 6MWT were not different between both groups. The LS showed significant improved in both groups; however, it did not demonstrate the difference when compared between groups. TMT was significantly increased in HPET compared with control. The CLDQ were not significantly changed between groups, but activity and emotional subscore improved in both groups. No adverse events occurred during HPET.\n\nConclusion: 12-week HPET is safe and effective. Although it did not show any differences in the changes in 6MWT, LS, SS of both groups, it demonstrated the increased TMT in exercise patients. The quality of life score were not significantly changed between groups\n\nOral\n\nHepatitis B and Hepatitis D\n\n1 Establishment of an outreach, grouping health care system to achieve micro-elimination of HCV for uremic patients in hemodialysis centers (ERASE-C)\n\nProf Chung-Feng Huang1\n\n1Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan\n\nObjectives: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevails in uremic hemodialysis patients. The current study aimed to achieve HCV micro-elimination in hemodialysis centers using a comprehensive outreach program.\n\nMethods: The ERASE-C Campaign is an outreach program for the screening, diagnosis and group treatment of HCV encompassing 2323 uremic patients and 353 medical staff members from 18 hemodialysis centers. HCV-viremic subjects were linked to care for directly acting antivirals therapy or received on-site sofosbuvir/velpatasvir therapy. The objectives were HCV microelimination (> 80% reduction of the HCV-viremic rate 24 weeks after the end of the campaign in centers with ≥ 90% of the HCV-viremic patients treated) and “No-C HD” (no HCV-viremic subjects at the end-of-follow-up).\n\nResults: At the preinterventional screening, 178 (7.7%) uremic patients and 2 (0.6%) staff members were HCV-viremic. Among them, 146 (83.9%) uremic patients received anti-HCV therapy (41 link-to-care; 105 on-site sofosbuvir/velpatasvir). The rates of sustained virological response (SVR12, undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after the-end-of-treatment) in the full analysis set and per-protocol population were 89.5% (94/105) and 100% (86/86), respectively, in the on-site treatment group, which were comparable with the rates of 92.7% (38/41) and 100% (38/38), respectively, in the link-to-care group. Eventually, the HCV-viremic rate decreased to 0.9% (18/1953), yielding an 88.3% reduction from baseline (range 54.3–100% in each site). HCV microelimination and “No-C HD” was achieved in 92.3% (12/13) and 38.9% (7/18) of the hemodialysis centers, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Outreach strategies with mass screenings and on-site group treatment greatly facilitated HCV microelimination in the hemodialysis population.\n\n2 Preliminary results of a Phase 2 study of VIR-2218, an X-targeting RNAi therapeutic, in patients with chronic hepatitis B: sub-analyses of HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive patients\n\nProfessor Man-Fung Yuen1, Professor Young-Suk Lim2, Dr. Daniel Cloutier3, Dr. Ling Shen3, Dr. Andrea Cathcart3, Dr. Xiao Ding3, Dr. Andre Arizpe3, Dr. Phillip Pang3, Dr. Stephen Huang4, Dr. Edward Gane5\n\n1The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, 2University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asian Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, 3VIR Biotechnology, Inc., San Francisco, USA, 4Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, USA, 5University of Auckland, New Zealand\n\nObjectives: VIR-2218 is a GalNAc-conjugated short interfering ribonucleic acid in development for chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB). VIR-2218 is designed to silence HBV transcripts from cccDNA and integrated DNA across all 10 HBV genotypes. We present safety and antiviral data from a Phase 2 study in CHB patients, focusing on baseline virologic characteristics and post-treatment HBsAg reductions in HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive subgroups.\n\nMaterials and methods: Noncirrhotic, virologically suppressed CHB patients received 2 subcutaneous doses of VIR-2218 or placebo (Day 1 and day 29). HBeAg-negative patients received 20, 50, 100 or 200 mg and HBeAg-positive patients received 50 or 200 mg. Cohorts included 4 or 8 subjects randomized 3:1 (VIR-2218:placebo). Assessments included safety for 12 weeks post-treatment and HBsAg follow-up for 48 weeks. Preliminary 24-week data are presented.\n\nResults: 24 CHB patients received VIR-2218 (n = 18 HBeAg-negative; n = 6 HBeAg-positive). Most adverse events were mild in severity with no events leading to treatment discontinuation. No clinically significant changes in safety laboratory parameters were observed. At baseline, HBeAg-positive patients had higher burdens of HBsAg, HBV RNA and HBcrAg. Similar maximum post-treatment HBsAg declines were observed for both subgroups, with magnitude of reduction related to dose. For the 200 mg dose, the mean HBsAg reduction was ≥ 1 log by week 12 and sustained through week 24 in both subgroups.\n\nConclusion: VIR-2218 was tolerated across all dose levels with no safety signals observed. Similar magnitude of HBsAg reduction in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB patients suggests that it could silence transcripts from both cccDNA and integrated DNA.\n\nHepatitis C\n\n3 Safety and efficacty of oral TLR8 agonist, selgantolimod (SLGN), in virally-suppressed adult patients with chronic hepatitis B: a phase 2 study\n\nDr Gane Edward, Dr. Edward Gane1, Dr. P. Rod Dunbar2,3, Dr. Anna E. Brooks2,3, Dr. Yang Zhao4, Dr. Diana Chen4, Dr. Jeffrey Wallin4, Dr. Susanna K. Tan4, Dr. Jenny C. Yang4, Dr. Anuj Gaggar4, Dr. Shyam Kottilil5, Dr. Lydia Tang5\n\n1Auckland City Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand, 2School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, 3Maurice Wilkins Centre, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, 4Gilead Sciences Inc., Foster City, USA, 5Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA\n\nObjectives: To assess SLGN, an oral TLR8 agonist, as treatment for CHB in virally suppressed adults\n\nMaterials and methods: Patients were randomized to SLGN 3 mg, 1.5 mg, and PBO (2:2:1) once weekly for 24 weeks (W) and followed for 24 W post-treatment with option to enter 48 W of treatment free follow-up (TFFU). Safety assessed adverse events (AE) and laboratory abnormalities. Primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of patients with ≥ 1 log10 IU/mL decline from baseline in HBsAg levels at W24. Secondary endpoints include HBsAg and HBeAg loss rates and changes in pharmacodynamic markers (e.g. cytokines and immune cell subsets).\n\nResults: 48 patients (24 HBeAg-positive and 24-negative) randomized. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups. One patient achieved the primary endpoint of ≥ 1 log10 IU/mL decline at W24. By W48, 2 (5%) patients achieved HBsAg loss, 3 (16%) HBeAg loss, and 10 (34%) ≥ 0.1 log10 HBsAg decline in SLGN-treated groups vs 0 (0%) placebo group. One HBsAg loss patient entered TFFU and remains HBV DNA-negative, HBsAg-negative, and HBsAb-positive. Frequent AEs were nausea, URTI, headache, vomiting, and fatigue. Dose-proportional increases in cytokines were observed 4 h post-dose without tachyphylaxis. Dose-proportional decreases in CD3 + T cells were also observed potentially reflecting distribution from peripheral circulation into liver.\n\nConclusion: SLGN up to 3 mg once weekly for 24 weeks is generally safe and elicited TH1 cytokine responses as well as shifts in peripheral immune cell subsets consistent with target engagement. Two patients achieved HBsAg loss and 3 patients achieved HBeAg loss with SLGN treatment. Further evaluation of SLGN in combination studies is planned.\n\n4 A randomized, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority, 48 weeks trial: tenofovir amibufenamide versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection.\n\nDr Zhihong Liu1, Prof Yuexin Zhang2, Prof Guozhong Gong3, Prof Guicheng Wu4, Prof Lvfeng Yao5, Prof Xiaofeng Wen6, Prof Zhiliang Gao7, Prof Yan Huang8, Prof Daokun Yang9, Prof Enqiang Chen10, Prof Qing Mao11, Prof the HS-10234 investigators, Prof Jinlin Hou1, Prof Junqi Niu12\n\n1Southern Medical University, Nanfang Hospital, Guangzhou, China, 2The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Xinjiang, Urumchi, China, 3Xiangya Second Hospital of Zhongnan University, Hunan., Changsha, China, 4Chongqing Sanxia Central Hospital, Chongqing, Sanxia, Chongqing, China, 5Mengchao Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fujian., Fuzhou, China, 6Liuzhou People's Hospital, Guangxi Province, Liuzhou, Liuzhou, China, 7The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan University, Guangdong, Guangzhou, China, 8Xiangya Hospital of Zhongnan University, Hunan, Changsha, China, 9The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical College, Henan, Xinxiang, China, 10West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, China, 11The First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University, Chongqing, Chongqing, China, 12The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China\n\nObjectives: Tenofovir amibufenamide is another novel prodrug of tenofovir, which was safe and well tolerated in previous trials. In this phase III study, we compared the efficacy and safety of tenofovir amibufenamide versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in adults with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.\n\nMaterials and methods: Patients with chronic HBV infection were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either 25 mg tenofovir amibufenamide or 300 mg TDF with matching placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HBV DNA less than 20 IU/mL at week 48. The key safety endpoints were bone and renal parameters.\n\nResults: This is an ongoing 144 weeks study. Totally 1002 eligible patients from 51 centers were randomized to receive either tenofovir amibufenamide or TDF therapy (n = 666, n = 336, respectively). The baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups. 52.8% (242/458) patients receiving tenofovir amibufenamide and 55.9% (128/229) TDF had HBV DNA less than 20 IU/mL at week 48 in HBeAg-positive patients; while 90.2% (157/174) patients receiving tenofovir amibufenamide and 92.9% (78/84) TDF had HBV DNA less than 20 IU/mL at week 48 in HBeAg-negative patients. The non-inferiority criterion was met in both populations. Patients receiving tenofovir amibufenamide had a significantly smaller decrease in bone mineral density at hip (p < 0.001) and spine (p < 0.001), while less increase in serum creatinine at week 48 (p < 0.05). Other safety results were similar between treatment groups.\n\nConclusion: In patients with chronic HBV infection, tenofovir amibufenamide was non-inferior to TDF, and had improved bone and renal effects.\n\n5 Exosomes with miR-574 transfer anti-HBV activity mediated by the interferon from macrophage to HBV-infected hepatocyte\n\nDr. Wenyu Wu1, Dr. Di Wu1, Dr. Weiming Yan1, Dr. Yongli Wang1, Dr. Jie You1, Dr. Xiaoyang Wan1, Dr. Dong Xi1, Dr. Xiaoping Luo1, Dr Wenyu Wu1\n\n1Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China\n\nObjectives: Interferon alpha (IFN-α) has proven to be clinically effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) due to its capability to reduce hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). However, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. The purpose of this study is to explore the role of exosomes in the antiviral process of IFN\n\nMaterials and methods: We investigated the anti-HBV activities of exosomes both from pegylated IFN-α (PegIFN-α) treated patients and the supernatants of IFN-α-treated THP-1 (the human leukemia monocyte cell line) derived macrophages. Then, we identified three upregulated miRNAs in exosomes through miRNA sequencing. By luciferase reporter assay, we found hsa-miR-574-5p reduced pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and polymerase mRNA levels by binding to the nucleotides 2750–2757 position of HBV genomic sequence.\n\nResults: Exosomes from patients and the supernatants exhibited anti-HBV activities including the suppression of supernatant HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA levels as well as intracellular HBV cccDNA in HBV related cell lines. MicroRNA sequencing revealed that PegIFN-α treatment upregulated exosomal hsa-miR-193a-5p, hsa-miR-25-5p, and hsa-miR-574-5p that could partially inhibit HBV replication and transcription. The luciferase reporter assay confirmed that hsa-miR-574-5p reduced pgRNA and polymerase mRNA levels by binding to the 2750–2757 position of HBV genomic sequence.\n\nConclusions: Exosomes can transfer IFN-α-related miRNAs from macrophages to HBV-infected hepatocytes, thereby suppressing HBV replication and expression.\n\nHepatobiliary Neoplasia\n\n6 The novel regimen of a single, priming dose of tremelimumab (T) + durvalumab (D) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) by viral etiology\n\nDr Masatoshi Kudo1, Ms Lavanya Vedanarayanan2, Dr William Harris3, Dr Masafumi Ikeda4, Dr Takuji Okusaka5, Dr Yoon-Koo Kang6, Dr Shukui Qin7, Dr David Wai Meng Tai8, Dr Ho Yeong Lim9, Dr Thomas Yau10, Dr Wei Peng Yong11, Dr Ann-Lii Cheng12, Dr Antonio Gasbarrini13, Dr Silvia Damian14, Dr Jordi Bruix15, Dr Mitesh Borad16, Dr Philip He17, Dr Alejandra Negro17, Dr Bruno Sangro18, Dr Ghassan K.

Viral etiology may affect uHCC prognosis, thus we evaluated whether hepatitis B and C viral infection (HBV, HCV) impacted response and survival.\n\nMaterials and methods: Immunotherapy-naïve patients with uHCC progressing on, intolerant to, or refusing sorafenib were randomized to T300 + D (T, 300 mg [1X] + D 1500 mg, then D 1500 mg Q4W), T75 + D (T, 75 mg Q4W [4X] + D, 1500 mg Q4W), D (1500 mg Q4W), or T (750 mg Q4W [7X] then Q12W). Active HBV required antiviral therapy. The primary endpoint was safety. Efficacy is presented by viral etiology.\n\nResults: As of Feb 28, 2020, 332 patients were randomized (T300 + D, n = 75; T75 + D, 84; D, 104; T, 69). 218 were infected with hepatitis (HBV n = 123, HCV n = 95); 114 were uninfected. Grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 29.4% (T300 + D, 35.1%; T75 + D, 24.4%; D, 19.8%; T, 43.5%). T300 + D produced the highest ORR for all subgroups (overall, n = 18 [24.0%]; HBV, 5 [18.5%]; HCV, 6 [28.6%]; nonviral, 7 [25.9%]) and the longest median [95% CI] OS overall (18.7 [10.8–27.3] months) and for the HCV subgroup (22.3 [10.8-not reached] months).\n\nConclusion: Response and survival varied with infection status; however, the T300 + D regimen consistently demonstrated the highest ORR independent of viral status and the longest median OS in the overall group.

Here, we report an updated OS analysis for IMbrave150.\n\nMaterials and methods: The global, multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase III study IMbrave150 enrolled 501 systemic treatment–naive pts with unresectable HCC, ≥ 1 measurable untreated lesion (RECIST 1.1), Child–Pugh class A liver function and ECOG PS 0/1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to atezolizumab 1200 mg IV q3w + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV q3w or sorafenib 400 mg bid until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit per investigator. This post hoc descriptive OS analysis included 12 mo of additional follow-up from the primary analysis.\n\nResults: 501 patients were enrolled (336 to atezolizumab + bevacizumab; 165 to sorafenib). At the clinical cut-off date of August 31, 2020, median follow-up was 15.6 mo and 280 OS events were observed. Median OS was 19.2 mo with atezolizumab + bevacizumab vs 13.4 mo with sorafenib (HR, 0.66 [95% CI 0.52, 0.85]; p = 0.0009). Updated objective response rates (RECIST 1.1) were 29.8% and 11.3% with atezolizumab + bevacizumab and sorafenib, respectively; complete response rates were 7.7% and 0.6%. Similar results were obtained per HCC mRECIST. Safety was consistent with the primary analysis, with no new signals identified.\n\nConclusion: IMbrave150 showed consistent clinically meaningful treatment benefit and safety with an additional 12 mo of follow-up. The combination provides the longest survival seen in a front-line Phase III study in advanced HCC, confirming atezolizumab + bevacizumab as a standard of care for previously untreated, unresectable HCC.\n\n© 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology, Inc.

MiR-24 is reported to be involved in the process of cardiac and muscle fibrosis, the role of miR-24 in liver fibrosis remains to be known.\n\nMaterials and methods: EdU incorporation and flow cytometry, transwell assay were used to determine hepatic stellate cells (HSC) cell proliferation, and cell cycle, migration ability, respectively. The levels of α-SMA and collagen type I were measured using qRT-PCR. Western blot was performed to determine the level of target gene in HSCs. Fluorescence reporter assay was conducted to prove the interaction of miR-24 and target gene. MiR-24 level was measured in the plasma of liver fibrosis patients using qRT-PCR.\n\nResults: Downregulation of miR-24 was detected in the CCl4-induced fibrotic liver and activated HSC. Overexpression of miR-24 led to decreased proliferation and activation of rat HSC, simultaneously suppressed the migration of HSC. MiR-24 inhibition had the opposite function. We further found that miR-24 acts on the 3'UTR region of ALK4 and thereby affecting the phosphorylation of Smad3. In addition, we showed that Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) was firstly induced and then subsequently caused transcription and expression of miR-24 in HSC. Moreover, miR-24 was lower in the serum of liver cirrhosis patient in contrast to healthy people and correlated to the Child–Pugh stage. In conclusion, our study suggested that miR-24 may play an important role in HSC biological function including activation and migration.\n\nConclusion: MiR-24 can provide new treatment strategy and screening biomarkers for liver fibrosis.\n\nNAFLD and NASH\n\n9 Safety and efficacy of combination therapies including cilofexor/firsocostat in patients with bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis due to NASH: results of the phase 2b ATLAS trial\n\nDr Gregor Weber1, Dr Mazen Noureddin2, Dr Kris Kowdley3, Dr Anita Kohli4, Dr. Aasim Sheikh5, Dr. Guy Neff6, Dr. Bal Bhandari7, Dr. Nadege Gunn8, Dr Stephen Caldwell9, Dr. Zachary Goodman10, Dr. Ilan Wapinski11, Dr. Murray Resnick11, Dr. Andrew Beck11, Dr. Dora Ding12, Dr. Catherine Jia12, Dr Ryan Huss12, Dr Chuhan Chung12, Dr G.

Baseline (BL) and W48 biopsies were evaluated by a central reader. The primary endpoint was ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH. Secondary endpoints included changes in NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), liver biochemistry, and noninvasive fibrosis markers.\n\nResults: The majority of patients had cirrhosis (56%), diabetes (72%), and NAS ≥ 5 (83%). For the primary endpoint, combinations led to higher response rates vs placebo, the greatest with CILO/FIR (11% vs 21%, p = 0.17). Compared to placebo, CILO/FIR led to significantly increased proportions of patients with ≥ 2-pt reduction in NAS and ≥ 1-grade improvements in steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning (all p < 0.05). CILO/FIR led to significant improvements in ALT, AST, bilirubin, bile acids, CK18, insulin, eGFR, liver stiffness, and ELF (all p ≤ 0.05). All regimens were well tolerated. Pruritus occurred in 28% of CILO/FIR patients (no discontinuations) vs 15% on placebo. At W48, CILO/FIR led to an increase vs placebo in triglycerides (+ 45 mg/dL, p < 0.001); changes in LDL (+ 9 mg/dL, p = 0.080) were not significant.\n\nConclusion: In patients with F3-F4 fibrosis, CILO/FIR was well tolerated and led to improvements in fibrosis and NASH activity.\n\nHepatitis B and Hepatitis D\n\n10 Disappeared steatosis relates to fibrosis regression in on-treatment patients with chronic hepatitis Bo\n\nMs Mengyang Zhang1\n\n1Liver Research Center, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China\n\nObjectives: Despite the increasing prevalence of steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), the interaction between steatosis and fibrosis in the course of anti-HBV therapy remains unclear. We aimed to identify the correlation between dynamic changes of steatosis and fibrosis based on histology in on-treatment patients with CHB.\n\nMaterials and methods: CHB patients with paired liver biopsies before and after 78 weeks of anti-HBV therapy were enrolled in this study. Liver fibrosis regression/progression was defined by both changes of Ishak score and post-treatment P-I-R system of Beijing Classification. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by the NAFLD activity score. Collagen percentage area (CPA) in different sites was identified by SHG/TPEF-based technology.\n\nResults: A total of 239 CHB patients with paired liver biopsies were included in the final analysis. They were divided into four groups according to the changes of steatosis during therapy: 162 (67.8%) persistent without steatosis, 24 (10.0%) developed new-onset steatosis, 21 (8.8%) with disappeared steatosis, and 32 (13.4%) persistent with steatosis. Fibrosis regression rate was the highest in group of disappeared steatosis, and the lowest in persistent steatosis group (76.1% vs. 43.8%, OR 4.114, 95% CI 1.211–13.980, p = 0.026). The most significant decline of CPA was also shown in the group of disappeared steatosis (decrease 50.8% from baseline, p = 0.216), which was mainly observed in septal and sinusoidal area.\n\nConclusions: Disappeared steatosis is correlated to fibrosis regression. Changes in steatosis influence the collagen content in septal and sinusoidal areas.\n\nWorkshop\n\nBreakout 1–1\n\nLiver Function Test Abnormalities in COVID-19 and Associations with Outcomes: ICU Experience from India\n\nDr Saptarshi Bishnu1, Dr Pavan Kumar Vecham2, Dr Ebenezer Rabindarrajan3, Dr Nagarajan Ramakrishnan3, Dr Bharath Kumar Tirupakuzhi Vijayaraghavan2, Dr Balasubramaniam Ramakrishnan M S4, Dr Murugan N1\n\n1Department of Hepatology, Apollo Hospitals, Greams Road, Chennai, India, 2Critical Care Unit, Apollo Hospitals, Greams Road, India, 3Critical Care Unit, Apollo Speciality Hospitals Vanagaram, India, 4Department of Biostatistics, Apollo Hospitals, Greams Road, India\n\nObjectives: Abnormalities in liver function tests have been reported with COVID-19. This study examines spectrum of LFT abnormalities and association with outcomes in COVID-19.\n\nMaterials and methods: Analysis of LFT parameters (bilirubin, ALT, AST) of 191 COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU was done. LFT status at baseline and subsequent testing were classified as “Normal”-all 3 parameters < ULN, “Liver injury (LI)”-any parameter between 1-3X ULN, “Severe liver injury (SLI)”-any parameter > 3 × ULN. LFT trend was defined as “Improvement”, “Stable” and “Worsening” after comparing LFT status at baseline and subsequent testing. Association of clinical outcomes and complications with LFT status at baseline, at subsequent testing and LFT trend was calculated.\n\nRESULTS: LI and SLI were present respectively in 54.4% and 7.8% patients at baseline and 56.3% and 22.8% patients subsequently. LFT trends showed “Improvement”, “Stable” and “Worsening” in 20.3%, 57.0% and 22.8% patients respectively. SLI at baseline was significantly associated with more requirement of invasive ventilation, development of pneumothorax and longer ICU stay. SLI at subsequent testing was significantly associated with higher incidence of shock, longer duration of inotropes, cardiac arrest, bleeding, need for dialysis and death. “Worsening” LFT trend was significantly associated with higher incidence of shock, cardiac arrest, pneumonia, need for invasive ventilation and death.\n\nConclusion: Severe liver injury either at admission or subsequently, as well as worsening LFT trend during hospitalization are associated with increased incidence of life-threatening complications and death, and can be used as vital clinical clues for physicians treating COVID-19 patients.\n\nBreakout 1–2\n\nComparison between using Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk scores and current criteria to identify high-risk patient for HCC surveillance in chronic hepatitis B patients in Thailand\n\nDr Chitchai Rattananukrom, Dr. Taya Kitiyakara\n\n1Gastrointestinal and hepatology unit, department of medicine, faculty of medicine Ramathibodi hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, 2Gastrointestinal and hepatology unit, department of medicine, faculty of medicine Ramathibodi hospital, Bangkok, Thailand\n\nBackground: The current guideline for HCC surveillance is based on age/sex using ultrasound abdomen ± AFP 6–12 monthly, and is a resource burden. From previous study, HCC surveillance program is cost-effective if HCC incidence ≥ 0.2% per year or ~ 1% in 5 years. Validated Asian HCC risk scores have been developed to classify HCC risk and may improve cost-effectiveness of surveillance.\n\nObjectives: We studied the difference in the number of HBV patients needing surveillance if HCC risk scores were used, compared to using the current national guideline for HCC surveillance.\n\nMethods: HBV patients age > 18 years seen in the liver clinic (1st October 2019 to 30th September 2020) were included. Exclusion criteria were diagnosed HCC, post-liver transplantation, cirrhosis Child–Pugh C not on transplant list, co-existing liver disease, chronic alcoholic use. Patients were classed into two groups: Non-cirrhotic and Cirrhotic groups. Each group was then separated into subgroups; Untreated subgroup (or treated < 2 years) was analyzed by CU-HCC, GAG-HCC, REACH-B and LSM-HCC scores. Treated subgroup (treated ≥ 2 years) was analyzed by CU-HCC, GAG-HCC, REACH-B and mPAGE-B score.\n\nResults: Of 713 HBV patients: 50.6% were male, with mean age 55.43 years, 10.7% cirrhosis and 10.7% HBeAg + . The 627 non-cirrhotic patients were separated into 2 subgroups: 318 patients were in untreated group and 319 patients were in treated group. The results showed that, compared to the national guideline, the number patients needing HCC surveillance decreased if HCC risk scores were used. In untreated non-cirrhotic subgroup, the reduction of patients needing HCC surveillance was − 69.5%, − 58.9%, − 58.8% and − 54.1% for GAG-HCC, LSM-HCC, CU-HCC and REACH-B, respectively. In treated non-cirrhotic subgroup, it was − 80%, − 75.2%, − 75.2% and − 2.8% for GAG-HCC, CU-HCC, REACH-B and mPAGE-B, respectively. For cirrhotic patients, HCC risk scores didn’t significantly change the percentage of patients needing HCC surveillance when compared with current guideline.\n\nConclusion: 1. In non-cirrhotic HBV patients, HCC risk scores reduced the number of patients needing HCC surveillance significantly (most risk scores reduced by 54–80%). This would impact on the resources needed for HCC surveillance nationally. 2. For cirrhotic patients, HCC risk scores were unnecessary.\n\nKeywords: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HCC risk scores, HCC surveillance, Chronic hepatitis B (HBV)\n\nBreakout 1–3\n\nRisk of metabolic acidosis with metformin use amongst diabetic patients with chronic hepatitis-B-related cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease\n\nMr raymond Ngai Chiu Chan1,2,3, Dr Terry Cheuk-Fung Yip1,2,3, Professor Vincent Wai-Sun Wong1,2,3, Professor Grace Lai-Hung Wong1,2,3\n\n1Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong KONG SAR, China, 2Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China, 3State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China\n\nObjectives: We examined the impact of metformin dosage on risk of metabolic acidosis in diabetic patients across different degree of chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nMaterials and methods: We identified a territory-wide cohort of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients with CHB-related cirrhosis from 2000 to 2017 in Hong Kong. Metabolic acidosis was defined by blood pH ≤ 7.35 with lactate > 5 mmol/L or arterial bicarbonate ≤ 18 mmol/L or venous bicarbonate ≤ 21 mmol/L And/or diagnosis codes. Child–pugh class and CKD stage were modelled as time-dependent covariate. Age gender comorbidities and use of other medications were adjusted as covariates. The maximum daily dose of metformin was modelled in categories of ≤ 1000 mg and > 1000 mg. patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or renal replacement therapy at baseline were excluded.\n\nResults: Of 4431 subjects with DM and CHB-related cirrhosis 2670 were metformin users. The risk of metabolic acidosis increased with more advanced cirrhosis and CKD. Metformin use was associated with even higher risk in patients with stage 4/5 CKD regardless of severity of cirrhosis (aHR ranged from 1.97 to 2.41) in stage 4/5 CKD a daily dose of metformin ≤ 1000 mg was still associated with higher risk of metabolic acidosis regardless of severity of cirrhosis (aHR ranged from 2.45 to 3.92).\n\nConclusion: Patients with child–pugh class B cirrhosis or above were at a higher risk of metabolic acidosis. Metformin further increased the risk in patients with stage 4/5 CKD. Dose adjustment in stage 4/5 CKD may not reduce risk of metabolic acidosis regardless of child pugh classes.\n\nBreakout 1–4\n\nOligonol and its beneficial effects in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial\n\nDr Maneerat Chayanupatkul1, Ms. Waleerat Sawatdee2, Dr. Pisit Tangkijvanich2\n\n1Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn university, Bangkok, Thailand, 2Center of Excellence in Hepatitis and Liver Cancer, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand\n\nObjectives: Oligonol a low molecular weight oligomer of long-chain polyphenols from lychee extracts has been shown to have insulin sensitizing Lipid lowering And weight loss effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of oligonol in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\nMaterials and methods: Adult patients with NAFLD defined by MRI proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) ≥ 11% were enrolled in the study and then randomly assigned to receive either oligonol or placebo. Basic demographic data Body weight, Waist circumference, Biochemical blood tests, And MRI-PDFF were obtained at baseline and at the end of treatment (week 24). Primary endpoint was ≥ 30% reduction in MRI-PDFF at 24 weeks.\n\nResults: Forty patients were enrolled (n = 20 in each group). demographic data Body weight, Waist circumference, Body mass index, MRI-PDFF, ALT, Fasting blood sugar, Lipid profile. HOMA-IR were similar between the two groups at baseline. Primary endpoint was achieved in 20% in oligonol group and 15% in placebo group (p = 0.68). We found a significant reduction in MRI-PDFF between week 0 and week 24 in oligonol group (mean reduction 3.74% p = 0.002) and a non-significant reduction in placebo group (mean reduction 2.61% p = 0.06). Significant reductions in body weight Waist circumference ALT and fasting blood sugar were observed in oligonol group in contrast. Only body weight significantly declined at week 24 in placebo group. No serious adverse events were observed in both groups.\n\nConclusion: Oligonol treatment could significantly reduce hepatic fat content Body weight, Waist circumference ALT and fasting blood sugar.\n\nBreakout 1–5\n\nAcute kidney injury defined by cystatin C may be superior for predicting the outcomes of liver cirrhosis with acute gastrointestinal bleeding\n\nDr. Cen Hong1, Dr Xingshun Qi1\n\n1General Hospital of Northern Theater Command, Shenyang, China\n\nBackground and aims: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is conventionally evaluated by a dynamic change of serum creatinine (scr). Cystatin C (CysC) seems to be a more accurate biomarker for assessing the kidney function. This retrospective multicenter study aims to investigate the role of CysC for evaluating the in-hospital outcomes of patients with liver cirrhosis and acute gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nMethods: Overall 677 cirrhotic patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding who had both scr and CysC levels detected at their admissions Were screened. eGFR-scr eGFR-CysC And CKD-EPI scr-CysC were calculated. MELD score and AKI were re-evaluated by CysC instead of scr. odds ratios (ORs) were calculated in the logistic regression analyses. Areas under curves (AUCs) were also calculated in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.\n\nResults: Univariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that baseline scr (OR 1.015 p < 0.001) and CysC (OR 3.366 p < 0.001) levels eGFR-scr (OR 0.970 p < 0.001) eGFR-CysC (OR 0.978 p = 0.005). CKD-EPI scr-CysC (OR 0.973 p = 0.001). Conventional MELD score defined by scr (OR 1.156 p < 0.001). MELD score re-defined by CysC (OR 1.153 p < 0.001). And AKI re-defined by CysC (OR 3.484 p = 0.022) were significantly associated with in-hospital death. But not conventional AKI defined by scr (OR 2.735 p = 0.085). ROC analyses showed that baseline CysC level (AUC = 0.673) eGFR-scr (AUC = 0.658). eGFR-CysC (AUC = 0.674). CKD-EPI scr-CysC (AUC = 0.677). Conventional MELD score defined by scr (AUC = 0.767). And MELD score re-defined by CysC (AUC = 0.751) could significantly predict the risk of in-hospital death. But not baseline scr level (AUC = 0.637).\n\nConclusions: AKI re-defined by CysC may be superior for predicting the in-hospital mortality of patients with cirrhosis and acute gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nBreakout 1–6\n\nOutcomes of patients with advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving different treatment modalities: real-world data\n\nMs Sangdao Boonkaya1, Dr. Roongruedee Chaiteerakij1, Mr Nopavut Geratikornsupak2, Ms Nutcha Pinjaroen1\n\n1Chulalongkorn Hospital, Bangkok Thailand, 2Queen Savang Vadhana Memorial Hospital, Chonburi, Thailand\n\nIntroduction: Although sorafenib is recommended for patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C HCC, many of these patients do not receive sorafenib given its high cost. We therefore aimed to determine outcomes of advanced HCC treated with different therapies.\n\nMethods: Data of 255 patients with BCLC C HCC between 2013 and 2020 were retrospectively abstracted. Overall survival and factors affecting survival were determined using Kaplan–Meier method and Cox proportional hazard analysis.\n\nResults: The mean age was 59 years, 85.5% were male, 85.1% had portal vein invasion. Most patients (73.3%) received locoregional therapy (TACE, Y-90 SIRT, external radiation) as the first-line treatment. Other first-line treatments included surgical resection (10%), systemic therapy (targeted therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy) (6.3%) and palliation (16.5%). Overall survival of the entire cohort was 4.62 months. Patients receiving resection as the first-line treatment had the longest survival of 13.1 months, followed by locoregional therapy (6.1 months), systemic therapy (2.1 months) and palliation (1.5 months). By univariate analysis, ECOG, tumor number and size, bilobar involvement, tumor burden > 50%, distance metastasis, Child–Pugh class, OKUDA score, treatment with resection and locoregional therapy were associated with survival. By multivariate analysis, tumor size, bilobar involvement, OKUDA score, resection and locoregional therapy remained significantly associated with survival, with adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) of 1.04 (1.01–1.07), 1.53 (1.11–2.11), 1.26 (1.03–1.56), 0.42 (0.19–0.93) and 0.58 (0.4–0.86), respectively, p < 0.05all.\n\nConclusions: In real-world setting, surgical resection and locoregional therapy significantly improved outcomes of advanced HCC patients, while systemic treatment including targeted therapy did not prolong survival.\n\nBreakout 2–1\n\nA study on the role of Lille’s score in predicting response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis\n\nDr Sagar Dembla1, Dr MG Srinivas1\n\n1Narayana Medical College Hospital, Nellore, India\n\nObjective: The primary-aim: to assess the role of Lille score on day 6 in predicting response to G-CSF therapy in severe alcoholic hepatitis. Secondary-Aims were to assess parameters like mDF, MELD, and CTPS after G-CSF. To assess survival in patients at 30 and 90 days.\n\nMaterial: Prospective, open-label, single center study between December 2018 to April 2020.\n\nResult: We enrolled total 67 patients, all were male. 26 were excluded as per exclusion criteria. Thus, 41 enrolled for therapy. Out of which 37 received first 5 doses and 25 patients completed 12doses. Over all mortality at 90 days was 31.7% (13/41). Lille’s score on day 6 had significant correlation (p value < 0.005) with survival at 90 days. AUC was 0.925 (CI 95%, 0.838–1.000). The cut-off value of 0.195 (sensitivity-81.8% and Specificity-86.7%). Kaplan Miere plot showed that the two groups as ≤ 0.195 and > 0.195, showed at survival at 90 days was 90% and 26.7%respectively. Lille’s score also independently predicted mortality with cut-off 0.195 (p value 0.009) and Odds Ratio is 16.3. In survival group there was a significant improvement in CTPS, DF, Bilirubin and transaminases on day 6 and day 30. MELD score improved on day 6 and day 30, but was significant on day 30. Creatinine and serum albumin showed no significant change at day 6 and day 30. In non-survival group, no significant improvement in liver disease clinical score and biochemical parameters. G-CSF therapy was well tolerated in patients.\n\nConclusion: G-CSF is appearing as a promising agent. Lille’s score may be used as prognostic marker for survival. However, larger data is needed to validate it.\n\nBreakout 2–2\n\nImpact of overweight and obesity on live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine response in children and young adult\n\nMr Termpong Dumrisilp1, Miss Voranuch Chongsrisawat2\n\n1Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, 2Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand\n\nObjective: Our aim was to evaluate the effect of overweight and obesity on the response to live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine in children and young adult.\n\nMaterials and methods: This was a prospective cohort study conducted at 3 schools, 1 university and 1 obesity clinic at hospital. The subjects aged 7 to 25 years were tested for baseline anti-HAV antibodies and administered 0.5 mL of live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine (MEVAC-A™). Participants with seronegative defined by anti-HAV antibodies (< 20 mIU/mL) were divided into three groups according to obesity defined as follows WHO classification. We evaluated immunogenicity and adverse events (AE) after 8–9 weeks from vaccination.\n\nResults: A total of 212 subjects completing the study (female: 131, median age (IQR): 13 years (11–16). Of these, 95 subjects (46%) were in overweight/obesity group. All the AE (n = 106) were non-serious and most event was myalgia (34%). The seroprotection (≥ 20 mIU/mL antibody titer after vaccination) rates were 100%. Post vaccination geometric mean titers of anti-HAV (IU/L) were 451.1 [95% CI 374.76–543.0] in underweight group, 428.38 [95% CI 399.61–459.22] in normal weight group and 467.46 [95% CI 425.01–514.16] in overweight/obesity group. No significant differences in immunogenicity were found between 3 groups (p = 0.33).\n\nConclusion: Live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine is safe and highly immunogenic because all of participants were seroprotection.\n\nBreakout 2–3\n\nElevated serum ferritin and CRP levels as prognostic markers in decompensated cirrhosis: a prospective cohort study\n\nDr Mithun Thomas1, Dr Sunilkumar kandiyil1, Dr T M Ramachandran1\n\n1Government Medical College, Kozhikode, Calicut, India\n\nObjective: The aim of the study was to analyse serum ferritin and CRP levels as prognostic markers in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and compare it with MELD and CTP scores.\n\nMaterials and methods: 220 consecutive patients with decompensated cirrhosis were included. Serum Ferritin and CRP levels at presentation and factors predicting mortality at 3 months were assessed.\n\nResults: Patients with decompensated cirrhosis (n = 220) (M:F 168:52, mean age 55.7 years ± 11) were followed up for a period of 3 months. At presentation, median serum ferritin level was 321.45 (7.4–750) ng/mL in survivors and 725 (275–3000) ng/mL in non-survivors, and median serum CRP level was 9 (2–60) mg/L in survivors and 18.5 (6–64) mg/L in non-survivors. Serum ferritin levels were significantly different between survivors and non-survivors [p < 0.05] and showed significant correlation with CRP levels (p < 0.01). Serum ferritin, CRP, total leucocyte count, MELD score, CTP score, presence of hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy and ACLF were significant predictors of mortality on univariate analysis. Ferritin, MELD and presence of hepatorenal syndrome were significant predictors of mortality on multivariate analysis. Serum ferritin [AUROC 0.91, 95% CI 0.87–0.95] was comparable to MELD score [AUROC 0.92, 95% CI 0.891–0.961] and better than CRP [AUROC 0.74, 95% CI 0.67–0.80] and CTP score [AUROC 0.847, 95% CI 0.79–0.89], in predicting death at 3 months.\n\nConclusion: Elevated serum ferritin level is an independent prognostic marker in decompensated cirrhosis. Elevated serum CRP levels did not show association with mortality at 3 months in decompensated cirrhosis.\n\nBreakout 2–4\n\nAetiology and staging of chronic liver disease in a cohort of patients in a tertiary care hospital in Sri Lanka\n\nDr Malinda Deraniyagala1, Dr Udaya Kalubowila1, Deraniyagala MP2; Kalubowila U3\n\n1National Hospital Kandy, Sri Lanka Aetiology and Staging of Chronic Liver Disease in a Cohort of Patients in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Sri Lanka, 2Senior Registrar in Gastroenterology, National Hospital Kandy, Sri Lanka, 3Constultant Gastroenterologist, National Hospital Kandy, Sri Lanka\n\nObjectives: The aim of this study was to share our experience with Chronic Liver-cell Disease (CLD) patients with regard to the aetiology, severity and complications.\n\nMaterial and methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at National Hospital Kandy (NHK), Sri Lanka from June 2019 to December 2019. Data of patients diagnosed with CLD were obtained from patient records after obtaining ethical clearance. These included the patient demographics, details on aetiology, severity and associated complications through clinical records and questionnaires.\n\nResults: The study included 106 patients with a mean age of 57.4 (± 10.6), 69 (65%) were males. Most (70.8%) were from Central Province of Sri-Lanka. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Cryptogenic cirrhosis combined was the most common cause of CLD (39.6%) followed by Alcohol related (AR) CLD (25.5%), Autoimmune hepatitis (14.2%) and Drug induced CLD (7.5%). In 6.6% the aetiology was inconclusive. Chronic viral hepatitis, metabolic disease (Wilson’s and Haemochromatosis) were seen in 0.9% each respectively. More than two thirds had decompensated cirrhosis with Child–Pugh scores of 28%, 42% and 30% for Child–Pugh grade A, B, C respectively. Average MELD score was 14.82 (± 5). Diabetes and hyperlipidaemia were seen in 44.3% and 13.2% respectively.\n\nConclusion: NASH combined with Cryptogenic CLD was the most common aetiology. Most were diagnosed of CLD at an advanced stage.\n\nBreakout 2–5\n\nImmunoprophylactic failure against hepatitis B virus mother-to-infant transmission\n\nDr Busara Charoenwat1\n\n1Khonkaen University, Khonkaen, Thailand\n\nObjective: Since 1992, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Thailand has been declining due to the expanded program of immunization (EPI) for the hepatitis B vaccine. Vertical transmission is the major route of HBV infection and contributes to chronic liver disease. Although adequate hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) coverage has been shown, immunoprophylactic failure also occurs. This study evaluated the prevalence and factors associated with the failure of immunoprophylactic vaccines.\n\nMaterials and methods: A prospective study was conducted from March 2018 to March 2020. A total of 67 children of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-seropositive mothers with known HBeAg status were enrolled. Twenty-three (34.3%) and 44 (65.7%) children were born to HBeAg-seropositive and HBeAg-seronegative mothers, respectively. Neonates received both the HB vaccine and HBIG within 2 h post-birth followed by four subsequent HB vaccinations at ages 1, 2, 4, and 6 months according to Thailand’s policy. HBsAg and Anti-HBs were evaluated at ages 9–12 months.\n\nResults: Four children (6%) with HBeAg-seropositive mothers and HBV DNA levels > 108 IU/mL (17.4%) were defined as immunoprophylactic failures based on HBsAg-seropositivity. One developed acute liver failure. Two HBeAg-seropositive mothers with high viral load had histories of irregular medical (Tenofovir) intake.\n\nConclusion: Immunoprophylactic failure in children also occurred even with effective immunoprophylactic protocols, especially those with HBeAg-seropositive mothers and high HBV DNA levels. Inadequate treatment may be one of the reasons for this failure. Novel strategies and large number of cases for further vertical transmission prevention should be considered.\n\nBreakout 3–1\n\nReal-world efficacy of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir treatment for patients with hepatitis C virus-related decompensated cirrhosis\n\nDr Yuki Tahata1, Dr Hayato Hikita1, Prof Satoshi Mochida2, Prof Nobuyuki Enomoto3, Prof Yoichi Hiasa4, Dr Ryotaro Sakamori1, Dr Ryoko Yamada1, Dr Takahiro Kodama1, Dr Tomohide Tatsumi1, Prof Tetsuo Takehara1\n\n1Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan, 2Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saitama Medical University, Japan, 3First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Japan, 4Department of Gastroenterology and Metabology, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan\n\nObjective: Real-world reports of efficacy of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) treatment for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related decompensated cirrhosis are limited from Asia.\n\nMaterials and methods: A total of 94 patients with decompensated cirrhosis who started SOF/VEL treatment between February 2019 and October 2019 at 26 Japanese institutions were included. We defined sustained virologic response (SVR) as undetectable serum HCV-RNA at 12 weeks after the end of treatment (EOT). This research has been approved by an ethical committee.\n\nResults: The mean age was 67 years. For the Child–Pugh class, 7% were class A, 74% were class B and 18% were class C. The SVR12 rate was 88.3% (83/94) and 6 patients were relapsed after the EOT, 3 patients died before judging SVR12 and 2 patients were missing data. The treatment completion rate was 95.7% (90/94) and 3 of 4 patients discontinued treatment because of liver-related events. Among patients with SVR12, improvement rates of Child–Pugh class B to A were 35% at the EOT and 48% at SVR12, and improvement rates of Child–Pugh class C to B or A were 36% at the EOT and 43% at SVR12. On the other hand, the deterioration rates of Child–Pugh class B to C were 5% at SVR12. Among 6 patients with relapsed, Child–Pugh class were not improved between baseline and 12 weeks after the EOT.\n\nConclusion: Real-world efficacy of SOF/VEL treatment for patients with decompensated cirrhosis was preferable. Achieving SVR is expected to improve liver function even in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.\n\nBreakout 3–2\n\nTenofovir alafenamide attenuates effects of diabetes and body mass on serum alanine aminotransferase activities in patients with chronic hepatitis B\n\nDr Pimsiri Sripongpun1,2, Prof. W Ray Kim2, Dr. Ajitha Mannalithara2, Dr. Allison Kwong2, Dr. Tami Daugherty2, Dr. Aparna Goel2, Prof. Paul Y Kwo2\n\n1Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Thailand, 2Stanford University School of Medicine, Redwood City, USA\n\nObjectives: Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) associates with a higher proportion for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The underlying mechanism is to yet be defined. We investigated ALT determinants in CHB patients who were switched to TAF.\n\nMethods: From an institutional electronic registry, we identified 97 CHB patients who received a prior antiviral for ≥ 48 weeks before transitioning to TAF for ≥ 48 weeks. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to model ALT based on demographic and clinical variables, separately before and after switching to TAF.\n\nResults: At switch, 83.5% of patients were receiving TDF monotherapy, the median ALT was 33 U/L with 42% being within normal limits (WNL). At 48 weeks post-switch, the median ALT decreased to 28 U/L (p < 0.01) with the proportion WNL increasing to 63% (p < 0.01). Changes in ALT occurred despite median BMI increasing by + 0.44 kg/m2 (p < 0.01). In multivariable regression analyses, higher BMI and diabetes significantly increased ALT (p = 0.03, p < 0.01, respectively) while patients were receiving non-TAF regimen. In contrast, after 48 weeks of TAF, neither BMI nor diabetes had a significant association with ALT, with regression coefficients diminishing by > 50% compared to the model before switch.\n\nConclusions: In CHB patients receiving non-TAF antiviral, persistently abnormal ALT may be attributed to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Under TAF, the relation between ALT and obesity or diabetes is disrupted. Focused studies for the mechanism by which TAF may decouple metabolic risk factors from ALT, and NAFLD, in CHB are warranted.\n\nBreakout 3–3\n\nHepatic sarcoidosis in Malaysia: a monocentric 10-year old retrospective review\n\nDr Thevaraajan Jayaraman1, Dr Ruveena Bhavani Rajaram2, Professor Sanjiv Mahadeva2\n\n1Gastroenterology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Malaysia, 2Department of Medicine, University Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia\n\nObjectives: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that commonly affects the lungs and rarely involves the liver. We aimed to describe the cases of hepatic sarcoidosis which were treated in University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) over the past 10 years.\n\nMaterials and methods: The electronic database of patients attending the Gastroentrology clinic in UMMC from 2010 till 2020 was reviewed. Patients with biopsy proven hepatic sarcoidosis were identified; their medical records were examined, and the relevant information was extracted for statistical analysis.\n\nResults: There were seven patients with hepatic sarcoidosis identified. All patients were females and of Indian ethnicity. The median (IQR) age was 50 (41–58) years and the median (IQR) duration of follow up was 6 (3–8) years. All patients presented with weight loss and had cholestatic liver injury on the serum biochemistry; liver biopsy showed presence of granulomatous inflammation in all. All but one patient was found to have lung involvement. All patients were given high dose steroids post-diagnosis; four patients were treated with azathioprine; two patients with methotrexate; and two more with infliximab. All patients did not have liver cirrhosis during diagnosis; however, 57% went on to develop liver cirrhosis despite treatment. One patient died from non-liver related cause 3 years after diagnosis, while the rest are still alive.\n\nConclusions: Hepatic sarcoidosis has a predilection for female gender and Indian ethnicity in Malaysia with a high rate of progression to cirrhosis despite treatment.\n\nBreakout 3–4\n\nDownstaging hepatocellular carcinoma to Milan criteria yields similar post-liver transplant outcomes to tumors within milan criteria: a systematic review and meta-analysis\n\nMr Alan Chuncharunee1, Prof. Ammarin Thakkinstian2, Lancharat Chuncharunee1, Assoc.Prof. Abhasnee Sobhonslidsuk1\n\n1Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand, 2Department of Clinical epidermiology and biostatistics, Mahidol University, Thailand\n\nObjectives: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond the Milan criteria (MC) are recommended for liver transplantation (LT) if they have successfully undergone downstaging (DS) to meet the criteria, despite a lack of high-level evidence supporting this approach. This systematic review and meta-analysis study was performed to compare the survival and recurrence outcomes between the DS and those within the MC to provide further evidence in support of this aspect of the current guideline.\n\nMaterials and methods: Studies were identified from MEDLINE and SCOPUS since inception to August, 2019. Two independent screened titles and full articles to ensure eligibility. Relevant data was extracted and converted to individual patient data and a Kaplan–Meier (KM) curve was constructed. A log-rank test and cox regression were applied to compare between both groups.\n\nResults: From 1201 studies, nine cohorts were eligible (DS vs. within the MC = 449 vs. 2039). Among these, eight and six studies reported post-transplant OS and DFS, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 86.3%, 73.9%, and 62.7% for those in the DS group, and 81.6%, 72.5%, and 66.4% for those within the MC. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 85.4%, 73.0%, and 64.0% for those in the DS group and 87.8%, 77.9%, and 69.6% for those within the MC group. The OS (HR 1.08; 0.89–1.33; p = 0.40) and DFS (HR 1.21; 0.79–1.85; p = 0.37) were not significantly different between both groups.\n\nConclusion: Applying the DS protocol into the LT program in intermediate-stage HCC is proven to be of benefit, without compromising post-transplant survival outcomes.\n\nBreakout 3–5\n\nGranulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for pediatric decompensated liver cirrhosis: a preliminary study\n\nDr Tri Hening Rahayatri1, Dr. dr. Aria Kekalih2, Prof. Dr. dr. Hanifah Oswari3\n\n1Department of Pediatric Surgery, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia, 2Department of Community Medicine, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia, 3Department of Pediatrics, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia\n\nObjective: Decompensated cirrhosis (DC) in children is a leading indication of liver transplantation (LT). Optimizing therapy is needed to reduce mortality of children on the LT waiting list. Organ allocation is based on pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD) score. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy has shown promising results in adult DC, known for its role in the mobilization of hematopoetic stem cells. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of G-CSF on nutritional status, PELD score, liver function and short-term side effects of G-CSF in children indicated for LT.\n\nMaterials and methods: Children aged between 3 months and 12 years old with DC were randomly divided into control and intervention group. Intervention received subcutaneous injection of G-CSF (5 μg/kg/day) for twelve courses. Both groups received standard medical treatment for DC. Primary outcomes were nutritional status and PELD score at 90 days, while secondary outcomes was liver function within 90 days. Short-term effects were also observed.\n\nResults: Twenty-six children (mean age ± 23 months) were eligible in the open-label study. Weight, height, mid-arm circumference and PELD score did not show significant change at 90 days. AST and ALT levels decreased on day-60 and remained stable on day-90. Albumin rose on day-30 and showed further increase on day-90. Low grade fever was the most common side effect reported in 54% of intervention.\n\nConclusion: Multiple doses of G-CSF did not improve nutritional status and PELD score after 3 months, however, the treatment showed clinical improvement of liver enzymes and albumin.\n\nBreakout 4–1\n\nImprovement of liver stiffness assessed by imaging-based techniques and non-invasive fibrosis scores in chronic hepatitis C patients with sustained virological response after direct-acting antiviral therapy\n\nDr Kessarin Thanapirom1, Miss Sirinporn Suksawatamnuay1, Assist Prof Dr. Bundit Chaopathomkul2, Assist Prof Dr. Natthaporn Tanpowpong2, Prof. Sombat Treeprasertsuk1, Mrs. Panarat Thaimai1, Dr. Supachaya Sriphoosanaphan1, Mrs. Sukanya Sittisomwong1, Miss Nunthiya Srisoonthorn1, Miss Pimchana Sawaengkarn1, Miss Nawakodchamon Mungnamtrakul1, Assoc Prof Dr Piyawat Komolmit1\n\n1Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society and Liver Fibrosis and Cirrhosis Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, 2Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society, Bangkok, Thailand\n\nObjectives: To demonstrate sequential changes in liver stiffness using imaging-based techniques and simple biomarkers in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) who received direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and achieved sustained virological response at 12 weeks (SVR12).\n\nMethods: A total of 81 HCV patients with SVR12 after DAA treatment were prospectively analyzed. Liver stiffness evaluated by transient elastography (TE), ultrasound elastography (USE), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and fibrosis scores using APRI and FIB-4 were assessed before treatment and 1-year after starting DAA.\n\nResults: The values of TE (17.7 ± 14.2 vs 12.9 ± 11.1 kPa, p < 0.001), USE (10.5 ± 3.5 vs 8.9 ± 3.5 kPa, p < 0.001), MRE (4.3 ± 1.9 vs 3.7 ± 2.0 kPa, p < 0.001), APRI (1.6 ± 1.7 vs 0.7 ± 0.6, p < 0.001) and FIB-4 (3.8 ± 3.2 vs 3.0 ± 3.2, p < 0.001) significantly decreased from the baseline to follow-up measurements. Advanced fibrosis (F3) by elastography tests was found in 50–65.4% of patients but reduced to 37.1–43.1% after SVR12. While liver steatosis assessed by TE-based controlled attenuation parameter and MRI-determined proton density fat fraction values were not different. Aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferase, total bilirubin and albumin were significantly improved whereas platelet count and body mass index did not change over time. A significant positive correlation could be found between all studied tests before and after therapy. Strong correlation was found among three imaging-based techniques before (r = 0.65–0.77, p < 0.001) and after (r = 0.69–0.79, p < 0.001) therapy. The strength of correlation between elastography and biomarker was moderate before therapy (r = 0.38–0.50, p < 0.001) but increased at post SVR12 (r = 0.42–0.69, p = 0.001).\n\nConclusions: Viral eradication after DAA therapy in HCV patients resulted in the improvement of APRI and FIB-4, and liver stiffness as assessed by TE, USE and MRE.\n\nBreakout 4–2\n\nRecurrence predictive models for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after radiofrequency ablation based on machine learning algorithms\n\nDr Ja-Der Liang1, Mr Ta-wei Yang2, Mr Po-When Chen3, Prof Cheng-Fu Chou3,5, Dr Yao-Ming Wu4\n\n1Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC, 2Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC, 3Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC, 4Department of Surgery, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC, 5Information Technology Office, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC\n\nObjective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been one of the leading causes of cancer death. Despite accurate diagnosis and effective treatments, the recurrence rate of HCC is still high. To build a recursive model by analyzing preoperative reports is helpful for follow-up and observing recurrence of tumor.\n\nMaterials and methods: Newly diagnosed HCC patients in National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) who received radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as the first treatment, were enrolled. Among 334 enrolled patients, 256 patients did not have recurrent HCC 1 year after RFA treatment and the other 78 patients had HCC recurrences. Data was processed with workflow of feature extraction and data imputation to acquire 16 features. We use different machine-learning methods to build the recurrence prediction model of HCC. The model performance among linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN) under a variety of experimental environment, including different parameters of models, data normalizations, and methods of data up-sampling were compared.\n\nResults: DNN model has the relatively best result that is the highest accuracy (82.65%) and second balanced accuracy (BAC = 66.03%) among all models. SVM with feature selection according to importance in RF has the best BAC result (66.48%) with 10% lower accuracy (72.51%). RF has the worst accuracy (56.32%). SVM has the worst BAC (61.66%).\n\nConclusion: Among the different prediction models, DNN achieved the best results by considering both accuracy and balanced accuracy. Establishment of prediction model could identify the risk patients with close monitoring of tumor recurrence.\n\nBreakout 4–3\n\nPerformance of non-invasive liver fibrosis tests in predicting variceal bleeding among patients with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage\n\nMs Nattida Sribuathong1, Associate Professor Chalermrat Bunchorntavakul1\n\n1Rajavithi Hospital, Thailand\n\nBackground and aims: Various non-invasive liver fibrosis tests (NIFTs) have been studied aiming to predict the degree of liver fibrosis and the presence of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. However, the use of NIFTs to predict variceal bleeding (VB) in the setting of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) remains unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of NIFTs in predicting VB as a cause of bleeding in patients with UGIB.\n\nMethods: Consecutive patients presented with UGIB who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), between June 2018 and August 2019 at Rajavithi Hospital, Bangkok, were prospectively enrolled. Baseline clinical/lab characteristics and NIFTs-scoring systems, including APRI, ARR, FIB-4, Fibrosis Index, Lok Index, GUCI, and King’s score, were evaluated.\n\nResults: A total of 215 patients with UGIB were included: mean age was 56.4 years, mean Glasgow-Blatchford score was 9.8 and 39.5% were VB. In the overall analysis, the AUCs of NIFTs for predicting VB ranged between 0.686 and 0.867. GUCI and APRI (both at the cut-off of 0.5) showed best performance in predicting VB with sensitivity of 95.3% and 90.6%, and specificity of 73.1% and 75.4%, respectively. In patients without known cirrhosis status (n = 132), the AUCs of GUCI and APRI in predicting VB were 0.860 and 0.895, respectively.\n\nConclusions: GUCI and APRI scores have good performance in predicting VB in patients presenting with UGIB regardless of known cirrhosis status. They may be helpful to select patients for prompt administration of vasoactive agents, antibiotics and urgent EGD.\n\nBreakout 4–4\n\nAcute liver failure: outcome and prognostic predictors\n\nDr Jalpa Devi1, Dr Mohsin Ali2, Dr Amerta Bai1, Dr Adil Hassan2, Dr Saadat Ali2, Professor Sadik Memon2\n\n1Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences, Hyderabad, Pakistan, 2Asian Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Pakistan\n\nObjectives: Acute liver failure (ALF) is defined as a rapid hepatic dysfunction and encephalopathy in the absence of pre-existing liver disease. It is relatively uncommon, however, it progresses rapidly with high mortality. Globally, viral hepatitis is responsible for the majority of cases of ALF. This study aimed to determine the etiology, outcome and predictive factors for in-hospital mortality in Acute Live Failure (ALF) patients.\n\nMaterials and methods: A descriptive study was conducted with ALF patients hospitalized at the Gastro-hepatology Department of Asian Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad from May 2018 to September 2019. A total of 31 patients having clinical and biochemical markers suggestive of ALF were included in the study and evaluated for etiology and outcome during the hospital stay and prognostic scores {King College Criteria (KCC) and Model End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)} were compared.\n\nResults: Thirty-one patients with a mean age of 22 years, 21 (67.7%) were males. Most common etiology was indeterminate 21 (67.7%) while 5 (16.15%) were Hepatitis B and 5 (16.15%) were Hepatitis E. The in-hospital mortality was 19 (61.3%), out of which 14 (73.3%) were males, and 12 (38.7%) were spontaneously recovered. High International Normalized Ratio (INR) > 5.00 (p = 0.02), MELD score > 32 (p = 0.049), KCC 2 or more out of 5 and sepsis (p = 0.008) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.\n\nConclusion: The in-hospital mortality of ALF was significantly high with raised INR, MELD (> 32), KCC (2/5) and sepsis being the poor prognostic factors.\n\nBreakout 4–5\n\nSignificant liver fibrosis is associated with increased risk of advanced adenoma in average-risk population with metabolic associated fatty liver disease\n\nMs Kotchakon Maipang1, Mrs. Nonthalee Pausawasidi1, Mr. Phunchai Charatcharoenwitthaya1\n\n1Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University Thailand, Thailand\n\nBackground: Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) shares several risk factors for colorectal neoplasia. This prospective study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between MAFLD and colorectal neoplasia.\n\nMethods: We invited patients aged ≥ 50 years who underwent colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening during 2018–2020 to determine the presence of steatosis and fibrosis with transient elastography. Logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratio (OD) for the effect of steatosis and fibrosis on colorectal neoplasia after adjusting for confounders, including age, gender, smoking, and metabolic parameters.\n\nResults: 956 participants (mean age 62.0 ± 7.1 years, 33.3% male) were enrolled. Adenomatous polyps were observed in 412 (43%), 66 of them had advanced adenoma, and 3 were diagnosed with colorectal cancers. 480 (50.2%) participants had steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter ≥ 248 dB/m), with 279 (29.5%) presenting with severe steatosis (≥ 280 dB/m) and 45 (4.7%) having significant fibrosis (liver stiffness ≥ 7.9 kPa). The presence of steatosis was not associated with the detection of adenomatous polyps (OD = 1.26, 95% CI 0.94–1.70) and advanced adenoma (OD = 1.26, 95% CI 0.72–2.20). MAFLD patients with significant fibrosis did not have a higher detection rate of adenomatous polyps (OD = 1.61, 95% CI 0.85–3.04) but had an increased incidence of advanced adenoma (OD = 2.61, 95% CI 1.11–6.12) after adjusting for all confounders.\n\nConclusions: Among the average-risk population, steatosis was not associated with the risk of adenomatous neoplasia. However, the risk of advanced adenoma appears to be higher in MAFLD patients with significant fibrosis. Liver steatosis and fibrosis assessment could help stratify individuals for colorectal cancer screening.\n\nBreakout 5–1\n\nImprovement of gut diversity and composition after direct-acting antivirals in HCV-infected patients with or without HIV coinfection\n\nDr Natthaya Chuaypen1, Thananya Jinato1, Dr. Anchalee Avihingsanon2, Dr. Sakkarin Chirapongsathorn3, Assoc.

Fecal specimens collected at pre-treatment and 12 weeks post-treatment were analyzed using amplicon-based 16S rRNA sequencing.\n\nResults: Sustained virological response (SVR12) rates in the mono- and co-infection groups were similar (98.4% vs. 95.8%). Pre-treatment bacterial communities in the patient groups were less diverse and distinct from those of healthy controls. Compared with HCV-monoinfected patients, HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals showed comparable microbial alpha-diversity but displayed declined Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. The improvement of microbial dysbiosis was observed in responders achieving SVR12 across fibrosis stages but was not found in non-responders. Responders with low degree of fibrosis exhibited a recovery in alpha-diversity to level comparable with healthy controls. Reciprocal alterations of increased beneficial bacteria and reduced pathogenic bacteria were also observed in responders.\n\nConclusions: This study indicates short-term effect of DAAs in restoration of microbial dysbiosis. The favorable changes in gut microbiota profiles after viral eradication might potentially contribute towards the reduction of HCV-related complications among infected individuals.\n\nBreakout 5–2\n\nA survey on approaches towards patients with elevated liver enzymes before surgery in Vietnamese Hospitals\n\nDr Hang Dao1,2, Dr Minh Pham1, MSc Trang Tran2, Duy Nguyen2\n\n1Hanoi Medical University, Hanoi, Vietnam, 2Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Hanoi, Vietnam\n\nBackground: Approaching to patients with liver enzymes elevation before surgery is a debating topic globally and in Vietnam.\n\nObjectives: To explore the clinical practice situation of Vietnamese physicians on elevated-liver-enzymes patients before elective surgery.\n\nMaterials and methods: An online survey was implemented between 01–31/07/2020, to obtain doctors’ characteristics and their approaches to patients with elevated liver enzymes before elective surgery in different levels of Vietnamese hospitals.\n\nResults: 114 doctors (53.5% males) with the mean age of 32.8 ± 6.9 years completed our survey. Their employment mainly are provincial-level or university hospitals (35.1% and 30.7% respectively). Most of the participants had 1–5 years (40.4%) or 5–10 years (36.0%) in experience. 42.1%, 22.8%, and 13.2% of participants were anesthesiologists, internal gastroenterologists, hepatologists, and surgeons, respectively. The clinician’s decisions were categorized into 3 main groups, including assessing severity and etiologies (hepatitis virus tests, liver functions tests and imaging tests were prevalent at 71.9%, 70.2% and 58.8%, respectively), using liver-enzymes-reducing medicines (44.7%), and consulting with hepatologists (73.7%). In terms of comparing opinions between groups of doctors by experience, only the differences in the proportions of”imaging indications” are statistically significant. In terms of surgery decision, 56.1% decided to delay when liver enzymes level is above 5ULN while others 13.1% would not delay if the liver functions remain stable.\n\nConclusions: There is a lack of conformity in Vietnamese doctors’ approaches towards patients with elevated liver enzymes before elective surgery, which raise the requirement of a standardized protocol in clinical practice.\n\nBreakout 5–3\n\nThe effects on HBsAg clearance, relapse and safety after tenofovir and entecavir cessation in non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg negative patients\n\nMs Onuma Sattayalertyanyong1, Mr. Supot Nimanong1, Mr. Tawesak Tanwandee1\n\n1Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand\n\nObjectives: To evaluate the incidence and predictors of HBsAg loss, virological relapse (VR), clinical relapse (CR) and safety after cessation of tenofovir (TDF) or entecavir (ETV).\n\nMethods: A total of 98 non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg negative patients (CHB), treated with either TDF or ETV for at least 3 years with suppressed HBV DNA for at least 2 years, were enrolled into either TDF discontinued (TDF-D, n = 39) or ETV discontinued (ETV-D, n = 27) groups compared to nucleoside analogue (NA) continued group (NA-C, n = 32). All patients were followed for at least 48 weeks.\n\nResults: Seven patients (10.6%) achieved HBsAg clearance 48 weeks in NA discontinued groups which was not significant compared to NA-C group (p = 0.092). HBsAg level was the only significant predictor for HBsAg clearance (Hazard ratio (HR), 0.21 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.007–0.61, p = 0.004). Cumulative incidences of VR were 66.7% and 40.7% (p = 0.037), cumulative incidences of CR were 43.6% and 22.2% (p = 0.073) in TDF-D and ETV-D at week 48, respectively. Six patients (15.4%) in TDF-D group had severe ALT flares, 2 required admission and one death. TDF treatment before cessation and HBsAg level less than 100 IU/mL were predictive factors of VR.\n\nConclusions: NA cessation can induce HBsAg clearance more than NA continuation. However, NA cessation increased the risk of VR and CR, especially TDF discontinuation which occurred earlier that ETV discontinuation. Some may result in severe CR leads to hepatic decompensation and death even in the patients without cirrhosis. NA cessation could be done carefully with under NA-specific monitoring.\n\nBreakout 5–4\n\nPrevalence of cholelithiasis and fatty liver disease with ultrasonographic confirmation among patients with diabetes mellitus in a tertiary hospital: a cross sectional study\n\nDr Paul Justin Belvis1\n\n1Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, Baguio City, Philippines\n\nObjectives: To determine the association of Duration of DM, BMI, and HbA1c levels with the prevalence of GD and NAFLD among patients with DM.\n\nMaterials and methods: Design: observational, prospective cross-sectional study. Study population: Inclusion criteria: (a) T2DM, (b) recent HbA1c result, (c) aged 20–79. Every 3rd patient by systematic random sampling. Exclusion criteria were: (a) T1DM, (b) s/p cholecystectomy, (c) liver pathologies, (d) significant alcohol intake. Intervention: hepatobiliary tract ultrasound (HBT) evaluated the presence of cholelithiasis and/or NAFLD. Statistical analysis: DM prevalence of 6.2% was used in OpenEpi revealing a sample size of 90. Descriptive statistics, Z-test, Cramer’s V and Chi-square test\n\nResults: 90 patients included with no drop-outs, 11 had Cholelithiasis alone (12.2%), 26 had NAFLD alone (28.9%), 15 had both (16.7%). Among 26 patients with Cholelithiasis, 9 male, 17 female (p = 0.23), most being 40–49 (p = 0.35) with majority married (p = 0.15). Highest prevalence of GD seen in: (a) duration of DM: 6–10 years (p = 0.006), (b) BMI: 23–24.9 (p = 0.636), (c) HbA1c:8.1–9% (p = 0.007). Among 41 patients with NAFLD, 16 male, 25 female (p = 0.26), with most aged 70–79 (p = 0.01), majority married (p = < 0.001); highest prevalence of NAFLD: (a) duration of DM: 6–10 years (p = 0.014), (b) BMI: 25–29.9 (p = 0.113), (c) HbA1c: < 7 (p = 0.038).\n\nConclusions: Duration of DM and HbA1c levels have a significant association with Cholelithiasis. Age, Gender, Marital Status, and BMI showed no significant association with the development of Cholelithiasis. Age, Marital Status, Duration of DM, and HbA1c levels showed a significant association with the prevalence of NAFLD; BMI and Gender showed no significant difference. This study highlights the need to formulate preventive strategies and to possibly include HBT ultrasound as a screening tool among diabetic patients.\n\nBreakout 5–5\n\nValidation of the “six-and-twelve” prognostic score in transarterial chemoembolization-treated hepatocellular carcinoma patients.\n\nDr Apichat Kaewdech1, Dr Pimsiri Sripongpun1, Dr Natcha Cheewasereechon1, Dr Sawangpong Jandee1, Dr Naichaya Chamroonkul1, Dr Teerha Piratvisuth2\n\n1Gastroenterology and Hepatology Unit, Division of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hatyai, Thailand, 2NKC Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Songklanagarind Hospital, Prince of Songkla University, Hatyai, Thailand\n\nObjectives: The “six-and-twelve” prognostic score was proposed recently to predict survival rate in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, it has not been validated externally. We validated this score and prior prognostic scores in Thai HCC patients treated with TACE.\n\nMaterial and methods: We identified all HCC patients who underwent TACE between January 2007 and December 2018 at our hospital. The inclusion criteria were treatment-naive, unresectable HCC BCLC-A and BCLC-B; if cirrhosis was present, Child–Pugh score < 7; and baseline performance status 0–1.\n\nResults: Of 716 HCC patients undergoing TACE, 281 (mean age, 61.1 years; 73.0% males, 92.2% with cirrhosis) were eligible. Approximately half of the patients had hepatitis B virus. Median overall survival (OS) was 20.3 (95% confidence limits [CI] 16.4–26.3) months. By stratifying with the \"six-and-twelve\" score (< 6, > 6–2, > 12), median (95% CI) OS was 35.1 (26.4–53.0), 16.0 (11.6–22.6), and 7.6 (5.4–14.9) months, respectively. AUROCs predicting death at 1, 2, and 3 years for the \"six-and-twelve\" score were 0.714, 0.700, and 0.688, respectively. Compared with the other currently available scores, the AUROC predicting death at 1 year for the \"six-and-twelve\" score was the most predictive and better than other models except the up-to-seven model.\n\nConclusion: Our study confirms the value of the \"six-and-twelve\" score to predict survival rate of unresectable HCC treated with TACE. However, in our validation cohort, AUROC of the \"six-and-twelve\" score was slightly lower than that of the original Chinese cohort (0.73).\n\nBreakout 6–1\n\nClinician experience and attitudes to palliative care in patients with HCC: an Australia-wide survey\n\nDr Abdul-Hamid Sabih1, Dr Lynn Lim1, Dr Maria Cigolini1, A/Prof Simone I Strasser1, Dr Ken Liu1\n\n1Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia\n\nObjectives: Palliative care (PC) service involvement in HCC patients is suboptimal. Little is known about clinician experience and attitudes towards PC in HCC.\n\nMaterials and methods: A nationwide survey of consultants/trainees was conducted. Clinician demographics, experience and attitudes towards PC use in HCC patients were collected.\n\nResults: 161 respondents participated (61% male, 94% gastroenterologist/hepatologist). 59% attended weekly multidisciplinary tumour board meetings (MDTBM) and 71% had no formal PC training. MDTBM with PC attendance was reported by 11%. Rates of PC referral and perceived usefulness of PC increased incrementally from BCLC-0/A to BCLC-D patients but were not universal even in advanced (46%)/terminal (87%) stages. Those with prior PC training were more likely to refer BCLC-0/A patients for early PC (p = 0.01). Referral rates for outpatient PC were higher in respondents who attended MDTBM with PC present (p < 0.05 for all stages). Common reasons for referral: end-of-life care (93%), pain (63%) and psychological symptoms (21%). 61% acknowledged PC patient discussions occurred too late and the best time was thought to be at diagnosis of incurable disease. PC service was rated good/very good by 70%/81% for outpatients/inpatients. Barriers identified to PC referral: negative associations with PC (83%), patient/family lack of acceptance (82%/77%), and insufficient time (70%). 78% thought patients would be more accepting of PC if the name was changed to “supportive care”.\n\nConclusions: PC referral for HCC patients occurs late and is not universal even in late-stage disease. Barriers to PC referral were not related to quality of PC services but rather to clinician perception of lack of acceptance by patients/families.\n\nBreakout 6–2\n\nRole of liver stiffness value in predicting of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver related complications among advanced fibrosis NAFLD patients\n\nProoksa Ananchuensook1, Panyavee Pitisuttithum2, Kessarin Thanapirom1, Roongruedee Chaiteerakij1, Piyawat Komolmit1, Sombat Treeprasertsuk1\n\n1Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society, Bangkok, Thailand, 2Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society, Thailand\n\nObjectives: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) becomes the prevalent chronic liver diseases worldwide.
