        "text": "In 2013, venture capitalist Aileen Lee floated the term ‘unicorn’ for private companies or startups to indicate the rarity of startups with a valuation of over $1 Bn. A decade later, unicorns in India are no longer rare! In May 2022, India became home to 100 unicorns, when neobanking startup Open raised $50 Mn to claim the position of India’s 100th unicorn.\n\nIndia achieved the milestone shortly after a wild funding year which saw Indian startups raising $42 Bn across 1,583 deals in 2021 and minting 45 unicorns in the process. India ended 2021 with 87 unicorn startups, and at a striking distance from scoring a century of unicorns, according to Inc42’s unicorn tracker.\n\nThe march continued in 2022, as India added 20 more unicorns to the club.\n\nFrom producing its first unicorn in the form of InMobi in 2011 to hitting the century of unicorns in India by 2022, it has been a long and eventful journey for the Indian startup ecosystem. The country is witnessing an unprecedented surge in VC investment and tech entrepreneurship, and the Startup India initiative has played an important role in it.\n\nSince its inception in 2015, a slew of policies, FoF and thematic funds, incubation programs, tax holidays and tax benefit schemes have been announced and launched under the Startup India initiative. With a massive tech transition to digital services and products in place and an active internet subscriber base of over 783 Mn (as of February 2022), India is now ready for the next stage of tech evolution.\n\nWhile 2021 was the year of record-breaking funding, 2022 has seen India achieve a historic landmark in the first few months with 22 Indian startups entering the unicorn club. The focus should now be on the sustainability of these 100+ unicorns and helping a new set of Indian startups turn unicorns.\n\nHowever, for that, the government will need to work on removing some of the obstacles like solving structural issues in the economy, preventing migration of Indian startups to cities like Dubai, and improving the ease of doing business, among others, to achieve the plausible target of having 280 unicorns by 2030.\n\nList Of Unicorns In India\n\nCollectively, the 114 Indian unicorns have raised more than $100 Bn in funding to date and are valued at more than $350 Bn combined. We at Inc42 have been tracking Indian unicorns since 2016. Here is a list of all the startups in India’s unicorn club:\n\nUnicorns In India: Indian Startups That Entered The Unicorn Club\n\nPerfios\n\nFounded in 2008 by VR Govindarajan and Debasish Chakraborty, Perfios operates in the fintech SaaS space. Currently operating in 18 countries, the company claims to be working with over 1,000 financial institutions.\n\nThe fintech SaaS unicorn turned profitable in FY23, posting a consolidated net profit of INR 7.8 Cr on the back of a significant jump in its service income due to the strong performance of its India business.\n\nPerfios joined the unicorn club in 2024, becoming the second unicorn of the year after picking up $80 Mn in funding from the Teachers’ Venture Growth (TVG), the late stage investment arm of the Canadian pension fund Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. Including the latest round, the fintech SaaS startup has secured more than $439 Mn in funding.\n\nKrutrim\n\nFounded in April 2023 by Ola Cabs and Ola Electric founder Bhavish Aggarwal, Krutrim is an AI startup, which claims to have built its AI models from scratch, having trained them on 2 Tn tokens and unique datasets. The AI models can understand over 20 Indian languages and generate text in 10 Indian languages, including Bengali, Tamil, Malayalam, Gujarati and Marathi.\n\nKrutrim is a family of LLMs, including Krutrim base and Krutrim Pro. These LLMs will be capable of multimodal output (the ability to generate content across multiple media forms) and many other technical advancements. The company claims that the model accomplishes better performance on multiple well-known, global, LLM evaluation benchmarks, including MMLU, HellaSwag, BBH, PIQA and ARC.\n\nIn January 2024, Krutrim became India’s first AI unicorn and Aggarwal’s third unicorn with a $50 Mn funding round led by a clutch of investors, including Matrix Partners India.\n\nUnicorns In India: Indian Startups That Entered The Unicorn Club In 2023\n\nInCred\n\nFounded in 2016 by Bhupinder Singh, InCred Group operates in the BFSI sector through three separate entities – lending vertical InCred Finance, wealth and asset management company InCred Capital, and InCred Money which deals in retail bonds and alternative investments.\n\nInCred’s net profit quadrupled to INR 120.9 Cr in FY23 from INR 30.8 Cr reported in the previous fiscal. Further, the unicorn reported an over 77% jump in its operating revenue to INR 864.6 Cr from INR 488 Cr in FY22.\n\nInCred’s lending arm turned unicorn in December 2023 after raising a $60 Mn (INR 500 Cr) Series D funding round led by Manipal Education and Medical Group’s Ranjan Pai, valuing it at $1.04 Bn.\n\nZepto\n\nFounded in 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohora, Zepto entered the market by capitalising on the rising demand for quick-commerce delivery following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The startup first turned heads after it bagged $60 Mn in November 2021 from Glade Brook Capital, Nexus and Y Combinator.\n\nZepto competes with Swiggy’s Instamart, Zomato’s Blinkit, Reliance-backed Dunzo and Tata-owned BigBasket. In FY23, Zepto saw its net loss surge 3.35X YoY, going from INR 390.3 Cr in FY22 to INR 1,272.4 Cr. Meanwhile, the startup’s revenue jumped 14.3X to INR 2,024.3 Cr in FY23 from INR 140.7 Cr in FY22.\n\nThe startup joined the unicorn club in August 2023 after raising $200 Mn in its Series E funding round at a $1.4 Bn valuation, becoming the first unicorn of 2023. Including its latest funding of $31 Mn in November 2023, Zepto has raised around $590 Mn across multiple rounds.\n\nUnicorns In India: Indian Startups That Entered The Unicorn Club In 2022\n\n1mg\n\nFounded in 2015 by Prashant Tandon, Gaurav Agarwal and Vikas Chauhan, healthtech startup 1mg offers medicine delivery, B2B distribution of medicines, healthcare products and diagnostics and telemedicine services. 1mg became India’s fifth healthtech unicorn after raising $40 Mn in a round led by Tata Digital.\n\nAccording to the healthtech unicorn’s website, it delivers to more than 1,800 cities and towns in India, having shipped more than 31 Mn orders since 2015. 1mg was acquired by Tata Digital in 2021.\n\nPost the deal, the startup was renamed Tata 1mg. The unicorn is also a part of Tata Digital’s super app, Tata Neu. Tata 1mg’s losses widened to INR 526 Cr in FY22, up 67% from INR 314 Cr reported in FY21. At the same time, its consolidated revenue reached INR 644.8 Cr, up 104% from INR 316 Cr reported in FY21. However, its total expenses also increased 85% to INR 1,171 Cr from INR 630 Cr in FY21.\n\nShiprocket\n\nFounded in 2017 by Saahil Goel, Vishesh Khurana, Gautam Kapoor and Akshay Gulati, Shiprocket is a Gurugram-based third-party logistics service provider, backed by the likes of Zomato, Temasek and Bertelsmann. The 3PL player became India’s 106th unicorn in August 2022 when it raised $33.5 Mn in a round led by Lightrock India.\n\nShiprocket claims to serve the logistics needs of more than 2.5 Lakh sellers across India and ships to more than 70 Mn consumers annually.
