Design/methodology/approach – A brief review of the (auto)biographical tradition in marketing scholarshipleadstoacommentaryonthefouraccountsinthisissue. Findings – Highlights of the four portraits are presented and insights into their authors’ lives and careers areoffered. Originality/value – The authors hope this introductory article whets readers’ appetites to learn more about the four contributors whose careers and personal lives are explicated for their consumption. Keywords History of marketing thought, Consumer research, Russell Belk, Philip Kotler, Sidney Levy, Morris Holbrook\n\nPurpose The purpose of this study is to determine what the history of research in marketing implies for the reaction of the field to recent developments in technology due to the internet and associated developments. Design/methodology/approach This paper examines the introduction of new research topics over 10-year intervals from 1960 to the present. These provide the basic body of knowledge that drives the field at the present time. Findings While researchers have always borrowed techniques, they have refined them to make them applicable to marketing problems. Moreover, the field has always responded to new developments in technology, such as more powerful computers, scanners and scanner data, and the internet with a flurry of research that applies the technologies. Research limitations/implications Marketing will adapt to changes brought on by the internet, increased computer power and big data. While the field faces competition for other disciplines, its established body of knowledge about solving marketing problems gives it a unique advantage. Originality/value This paper traces the history of academic marketing from 1960 to the present to show how major changes in the field responded to changes in computer power and technology. It also derives implications for the future from this analysis."
