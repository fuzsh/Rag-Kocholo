        "text": "Sharing our feedback on customer services in Rajkot (Kalawad Road branch). This is just to let you know that we got to experience a fantastic customer service in ICICI Bank (Nalanda Society, Kalawad Road branch) Rajkot around mid-January 2023. We were very pleased with Jesal Kothari, who was in the branch and served us. She was very courteous all the time and helpful and made sure our request was completed and we were comfortable. We wish her all the best in her future and career. Since we had a good experience, we would like to share our feedback for your information and records. Thank you. Your Sincerely, Happy Customers\n\nI am writing this letter to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding service Mr Saurabh Gandhi, Relationship Manager, Gurugram, provided during my recent home loan processing.

As a Relationship Manager, he demonstrated exceptional communication skills by keeping me informed at every stage of the process. He patiently answered all my queries and provided me with relevant information that helped me make informed decisions.

He went out of his way and called me on my personal number and requested those changes. Kudos to the rest of the team as they were helpful too, including the lady I spoke to on the phone. Great job. Love banking with you. It feels good to know that my money is with people I can trust. Good luck and all the best!\n\nbest banking services from none other than ICICI Bank, always!! Whether it’s in the city or any remote place their employees and call centres are always ready to help and assist. My kudos to ICICI Bank.

I recognise and appreciate employee Siddhanth Pandya’s excellent help and professionalism. I was new to this place but Siddhant Pandya and the Bank Manager tried their best to help me in each aspect of banking services. Every effort matters. It is important to understand that a simple call and help can encourage your customer to be a significant part of the company's future endeavours. That’s what Siddhant showed on that day. I wish him and ICICI Bank branch a lot of success and togetherness. Thank you once again for all your contributions.\n\nI am writing this letter to express my sincere appreciation for the excellent services that I have received from ICICI Bank.

The amount has been disbursed into my account. It started with Kartik initially. He really helped me sincerely & it was later taken further by Anusaya by ensuring each & everything should go smooth & hassle-free. This kind of work process may be a regular practice of yours but it can't be explained how a customer feels once they get such kind of personalized assistance. You guys are not less than an asset to the company. Thank you for all your support once again & I wish you & entire team all the best & a very happy & prosperous year ahead! Thanks, Prashant\n\nI had an issue with a chargeback from Karnataka Bank. I had approached ICICI Bank customer service. They had raised a Service Request on 29/8/2022. I visited the Karnataka Bank branch for the chargeback, but what I received was vague answers. 4 months passed. When nothing worked I approached Mr. V. Anish, Branch Manager of ICICI Bank, Devanahalli branch for help. He immediately took up the issue and I received the full chargeback within 2 days of approaching Mr. Anish. His relentless effort made it possible to satisfy this 83 yr old customer. Mr. Anish is a very sincere and efficient officer, who goes out of his way to satisfy the bank’s customers. I have heard about his selfless effort from some other friends too. Great job, Anish. ICICI Bank has a very able and sincere officer. Well done.\n\nWe all, complete India is under drive of ?500 and ?1000 rupee currency demonetisation and all banking institutions are much busy since 8th November-2016.\n\nI herewith express my warm gratitude to the ICICI Bank Personnel for arranging a very good service for their customers in all branches of Ahmedabad.\n\nPersonally, I am very thankful to Mrs. Dhara Shah at your JMC House-Law Garden Branch; the way she has well taken care of all privilege customers. It is highly appreciated.\n\nOnce again, thank you very much for providing hard service to our loved nation India.\n\nI have recently visited your Branch and I really appreciate the lady who served me, maybe her name was Ms. Priyanka. She helped me for raising a complaint regarding some transaction issue. I am very happy with the services of the lady and indeed I gives her good wishes.\n\nI request you to take these kind of employees those made your brand trustworthy for a customer and please appreciate her for her good work.\n\nI have already talked there with the Branch Executive. I would also like to give him good compliments, he is very nice and am also very much satisfied with his services that he has given me.\n\nI really want them both to grow well and always be appreciated and rewarded.\n\nICICI Bank has always been my favourite bank and it becomes more when we meet an employee who goes extra mile to help a customer. I recently visited ICICI Bank Allahabad (Civil Lines) Branch regarding my dormant account and to withdraw the balance. The first time when I visited the branch, systems were not working due to server problem, but the employee catered my concern and asked for my contact details, so that she can update me once the systems start working. When I visited the branch on Monday, January 15, 2018, she was able to recognise me the moment I said my concern is regarding a dormant account. She asked me to help her with my photo ID and other documents and helped me to complete the process. She also informed that to withdraw the funds, I have to visit the branch again as I don’t have any cheque. She was also aware that I am an outstation customer. She said that she will contact me regarding the amount withdrawal after checking with the branch manager. I thought I will again visit the branch and check about this if I can withdraw the amount and if not, then the next time when I will visit Allahabad I will sort this or from Delhi branch I will see. However, it was done before I left Allahabad and ICICI Bank proved again that they are the best.\n\nI am writing this to appreciate the wonderful services of your Ambernath, (Thane, Maharashtra) bank’s staff. Recently, I visited your bank to apply for a life insurance and mediclaim policy, and I was attended with utmost professional attitude and perfection. Mrs Samita Parab and team made sure that all my queries were resolved. They made me feel really very comfortable and introduced me with the concerned person of your bank.\n\nI was really pleased to visit your bank and I feel I have made the right choice. I would like to thank your staff for their warm reception and patience in answering all my queries and ensuring that all my doubts are resolved. She and her team even helped me pick the right policies along with taking care of all the official formalities. Once again, thanks a lot for serving my needs with such warmth.\n\nMy wife Sudha, joins me in thanking Mr. Murali Mudduru of Mangalore home loan branch and Mr. Ravinder Singh of Bahrain branch and their team members for their efforts in speedy processing of our home loan.We immensely appreciate their efforts and convey our sincere thanks and appreciation to their team members and particularly to Mr. Venkat of Bahrain, Mr. Manoj and Mr. Nitin of Mangalore home loan team.\n\nUnder the able leadership of Mr. Murali, with strong support from Manoj and Nitin, the speed and agility with which Mangalore home loan team worked to take the matter to its logical conclusion is a true testimony for the high standards of customer service, which ICICI Bank has pioneered in Indian banking industry. Equally well supported by Mr. Ravinder, from Bahrain, shows great team work and speaks a lot about ICICI as an organisation.\n\nIts worth to mention at this point that, even during my first visit to ICICI Bank Udupi branch, the warmth and support offered by Mr. Prasanna and Mr. Rejish gave me a huge strength.\n\nI have been an ardent fan of ICICI Bank, because i believe that, ICICI has ensured that i remain their loyal customer from last 13 years. More than 95% of my banking/loan/insurance needs are supported by ICICI and its affiliated institutions.\n\nI feel immensely proud of my association with ICICI BANK.\n\nI have been a customer of ICICI Bank since 1998. Since then, I have been shifting my base regularly to various places. I am truly glad that ICICI Bank provides a world class service to its customers. When I moved from Thane to Pune they did not change my Account Number. Even when I moved out of India they converted my Savings Bank Account in to an NRO Account with the same Account number.\n\nIn the past few months, the best experience I had has been pre paying my Housing Loan from Bahrain. Mr. Ravinder Singh of ICICI Banks Bahrain Branch has been a great help to me. Earlier I used to ask my father to go to ICICI Banks Belgaum Branch to give the cheque for the Home Loan prepayment. It used to take a long time to do so, as there is no Home Loan Office in Belgaum, and the cheque would be sent to the Hubli Branch. The staff in the Belgaum Branch were not that co-operative and we struggled a lot.\n\nOnce I met Mr. Ravinder in the Bahrain Branch who informed me that I could prepay my Housing Loan without going to bank and the adjustment of my loan is done as per my requirement, I was very happy. I don’t think, I would have ever got this sort of service in any other bank. I would like to thanks Mr. Ravinder and ICICI Bank for making my life easier. The Net Banking Facility is simply great. The free call back facility for NRI's is another feature worth mentioning. I had few complaints earlier with ICICI Bank and the way in which complaints were handled were truly world class. Kudos to ICICI Bank. Despite of their elephant like size their agility is fascinating. Who says elephants can't dance?\n\nI am customer of ICICI Bank since 1998, and I actively use the facilities of Online Banking, remittance and other services. I congratulate ICICI Bank to be able to service my requests and banking needs for all these times.\n\nI must say that ICICI has been the innovator for the banking Industry in India, I remember they being the first Bank to walk into our office and opening account at our doorsteps while the industry was dominated only by State Owned Government Banks where you would need to go thru so much pain in standing queue, bring witnesses or referees etc. I have not forgotten and will never forget, all the convenience ICICI Bank has offered me. I appreciate their staff’s friendly assistance at all times.\n\nI was called by an ICICI staff surveying the quality of service to me and I was honest in giving my opinion and I think they are great. Best Regards\n\nI had an issue with a chargeback from Karnataka Bank. I had approached ICICI Bank customer service. They had raised a Service Request on 29/8/2022. I visited the Karnataka Bank branch for the chargeback, but what I received was vague answers. 4 months passed. When nothing worked I approached Mr. V. Anish, Branch Manager of ICICI Bank, Devanahalli branch for help. He immediately took up the issue and I received the full chargeback within 2 days of approaching Mr. Anish. His relentless effort made it possible to satisfy this 83 yr old customer. Mr. Anish is a very sincere and efficient officer, who goes out of his way to satisfy the bank’s customers. I have heard about his selfless effort from some other friends too. Great job, Anish. ICICI Bank has a very able and sincere officer. Well done.\n\nMs. Meenakshi, I am writing this letter to express my sincere thanks and appreciation for the incredible service you have rendered for resolving my problems with respect to ICICI Bank Credit Cards. Your kindhearted behaviour and incessant support during the hour of crisis helped in solving my problems. You are a true team player and carry positive energy not only within the team but also in the entire organisation. It will not be exaggerating if I say that without your efforts, my problems would not be resolved in time and with this speed. I thank you once again for the wonderful help you have extended and wish you all the best for your future endeavours.\n\nI visited Bangalore HRBR Layout Branch yesterday, for a new NOC for my 2010 Vehicle Loan, which was not updated properly in RTO records for some reason. Remember, this is for a 10-year-old document (NOC). I have mixed thoughts in my mind. Then I met an executive by the name of Mr Darshan. I gave my older NOC for loan details, etc. He gave me a request form to fill. After a few minutes, a new NOC was printed and handed over to me. This was an amazing experience. ICICI Bank has certainly set a new standard in the customer banking experience. Can't imagine this kind of service in any nationalised bank, who would generally ask us to come the next day even for a cheque book or trivial document. Great service by ICICI Bank and Mr Darshan in setting high standards of customer service!\n\nRajarajeshwari Branch Executive Milan MG is definitely one of the best employees I have met so far. He provides all the information we want and is never late to respond on our queries. Since, we wanted to have startup Current Account we had lot of queries on benefits of account, but Milan made our life easy by setting up our bank process and he also tries to complete the work as fast as possible, so that the customer does not have to wait too long. My experience at ICICI Bank Rajarajeshwari Branch is the best so far. Thank you so much to the whole team for doing their best. And wish you luck for future. I would like to add that I will always be very happy to use ICICI Bank in future also and suggest others also to try the same. Thank you for the fastest response which really helped to save my time as we were running out of time on company startup. I have been using ICICI Bank since 2008 and I never had any problem till date. Their services are really good. Once again a big thanks to Milan and the whole team for always helping me at the time of need!\n\nBangalore Whitefield Branch Executive Jennifer is definitely one of the best employees I have met so far. She provides all the information we want and is never late to respond to anyone. She also tries to complete the work as fast as possible, so that the customer does not have to wait too long. My experience at ICICI Bank Whitefield Branch is the best so far. Thank you so much to the whole team for doing their best. And wish you luck for future. I would like to add that I will be always be very happy to use ICICI Bank in future also and suggest others also to try the same. Thank you for the fastest response which really helped to save my time as I was travelling at that time. I have been using ICICI Bank since 2011 and I never had any problem till date. Their services are really good. Once again a big thanks to the whole team for always helping me at the time of need. Jennifer as an executive has also helped me previously getting my mutual funds and other services. Big thanks to her. The moment I ask her for any help regarding my account or transfers, she has always responded the fastest and also solved the problem in no time. Also Whitefield Branch has a really good team which works together to make things happen really fast. I would suggest everyone to visit ICICI Bank Whitefield Branch to make things happen fast because they are really dedicated in what they are doing and also work hard to give their best. As I travel a lot cannot visit the branch frequently. Thank you.\n\nThis is to appreciate the staff from Kammanahalli Main Road Branch, Ms. Himani Wadhwani - who is on service counter. She really defines the meaning of 'Excellent Customer Service'. Number of occasions we have met Ms. Himani for services pertaining to my account and my family members. The most pleasing part is she knows stuff, extremely well informed about banking procedures which has made our sometimes complex queries/services hassle free. Specifically for my Mother's account, my mother is a senior citizen and Ms. Himani has been extremely courteous and resolves all queries that my mother had. She does this all with smile. To end it I would state, this is the level of service I would expect from a reputed bank like ICICI and I have 16 years old relationship with the bank. I am delighted and this is the kind of staff, even if they are discussing cross-sales products - I get inclined and encouraged to take it due to her attitude and knowledge. I 'Trust' the staff so well.\n\nMs Sneha Lata (Branch Operations Manager), Ulsoor road was very helpful in correcting a typo error in my given name. It was a tricky procedure because but she contacted multiple people and followed up for days and finally did the job for me.\n\nI also noted that she was kind a hearted person who wants to help as many people and customers as she can, I have observed that she speaks empathetic about customers even behind the curtains and stage.\n\nHaving people like Ms Sneha Lata enriches ICICI bank to a great extent.\n\nI would like to appreciate the Branch service of ITPL Branch in Bangalore. The staff is very cooperative. I had to make 2 DDs for my cousin's admission. This was the first time I was trying to get DD. I was running out of time as we had to submit these DDs to the college for the admission. The staff, Ms. Smita and all other staff, including the guard, not only guided me through the whole process, but also ensured I get the DDs on time.\n\nThank you ICICI Bank.\n\nBranch Manager at ICICI Bank ITPL branch is really amazing and always welcomes the customer with a smiling face. He has arranged for me the required change multiple times when I visited the branch. The greatness of this young man is that he tries to give a solution and sees the request from the customer's standpoint. Even if the requested change is not there, he promises the customer to get it later that day and he fulfilled the same multiple times. I am actually delighted by his service and attitude and I am sure he has a bright future. Please pass on my compliments to this gentleman. Best part this, he remembers customer name!\n\nI wish to appreciate Mr. Binod Gupta from J P Nagar 3rd Phase; he helped me in opening a Privilege account for my wife and demat account for myself, offered & upgraded my account to Titanium account for free. From my experience during the services he offered I particularly appreciated his sincerity & accountability, he has a superb habit of following up on his items in a self driven style which is a rarity in busy service industry. Also I believe he personally empathizes and hence strives to give the best deals that are most beneficial to customers.\n\nThese are exactly my expectations and reasons to continue the relationship with ICICI Bank.\n\nI have a savings a/c with ICICI Bank in Indira Nagar, Bangalore. When I was visiting my in-laws in Secunderabad I had an urgent requirement to sort few things with my saving a/c and my wife's account since we were travelling abroad in a week. I walked into this ICICI Bank in Kharkhana, Secunderabad and we were pleasantly greeted by this gentleman Manikanta\n\nHe was courteous and fantastically helpful. I was so surprised to see some executive from a different branch who was so helpful in sorting out a customer need. People might say that's the MO of ICICI and other standard pvt banks but this is way beyond that. He doesn't have to take all the trouble to fill out forms, suggesting the best ways to go about for our requirements. There were couple of requirements for which he said he will inform us about the status and he did promptly.\n\nI don't generally get awed by any service since I had seen best customer treatments before, but this is to me \"World class\".\n\nThat's when I decided that I need to note his employee id to write this appreciation note.\n\nICICI Bank please keep hold of these gems, these are the ones who are loyal to their company and do their jobs honestly without expecting too much in return. These guys are the good people.\n\nKeep up the good work and all the very best!\n\nI recently went to the Chamarajpet Branch for transferring funds abroad for Higher Education fees. The Bank representative Mr. Mohit clearly explained about the documents required and helped me through the process in making a successful fund transfer. Although this may seem to be a part of the process, it was very crucial for me as I was nearing the deadline. It was a high impact transaction for me and the way the representative assisted me in the situation is highly commendable. Thanks a lot Mohit for your customer oriented service and thanks to ICICI Bank for setting up such a beautiful system.\n\nIt was a real surprise when I went to the bank branch today. . I had visited your MG Road Branch and was called up within a minute, as per my token, to service desk counter No.8 handled by Dipali Kakkad.\n\nThe quality of service was great and truly memorable. I even shared my experience with my colleagues and at home.\n\nMy objective for visiting the Bank was to get a DD for my daughtersâ€™ school admission.\n\nDipali was very friendly and courteous. She even asked me about the quality of schooling and asked how old my daughter was. She also very nicely made a sales pitch for the opening of a new account for my son under the Young Stars initiative and within seconds I agreed and opened the account for my son.\n\nI would like to place on your records that â€œICICI Bank will live up to the expectations, if all your staff give this level of service.â€ I would thank Dipali Kakkad once again, who made the difference today at ICICI Bank.\n\nI have been visiting your branch (R T Nagar, Bangalore) and your staff members there are very efficient and quick in serving their customers.\n\nAlso, had couple of interactions with the Senior Manager (Mr. Jyothimaya Mohanty) and he is very efficient. He is always willing to help customers even before they look for him, when they visit the branch. He breaks the traditional Bank Manager personality by being proactive and posses an approachable personality. No wonder the branch is always packed with customers (but are cleared as and when they come) for the outstanding services rendered. Please keep up the good job!\n\nI have long standing relationship with ICICI. I recently opened a bank account with another bank as my new company needed me to open an account with them. Honestly after initial pathetic experience with the new bank customer care, I feel the customer care service in ICICI is so much better. I actually miss it and contemplating to work with my company and change my salary account back to ICICI. I get to talk to phone banking office in ICICI immediately but its herculean task with the other bank. I must say ICICI is far better when it comes to customer service. Wish ICICI keeps up this good work.\n\nI want to express my heartfelt thank you to Mr. Saurabh Singh, Senior General Manager and Head - Customer Service, who has helped me receive resolution for a Credit Card issue. I was levied late payment charges in spite of clearing the total outstanding amount along with interest charges. I was not only exempted from paying the late payment charges, but Mr. Singh also ensured that the interest charges that I had paid for a week was also reversed. Although, at one point the situation looked hopeless and I was even willing to make the late payment to bring closure to the matter as it was emotionally very draining for me. I am very glad to know there is support available with ICICI Bank with persistent follow up. Mr. Singh, I am grateful to you for your kind assistance.\n\nI have been banking with ICICI Bank for more than a decade now. ICICI Bank in my opinion has the most customer friendly internet banking portal. You wish for something and you will have a tab for it. ICICI Bank internet banking really lives up to the saying \"Just a click away\". Also you have the best and most courteous and well trained customer care executives. They are a pleasure to talk to. It has never happened that I have not got a solution if I have called up customer care. Please keep up the good work. You have in me a very loyal customer for life and all 'cause of job well done by your team.\n\nThis is my 6th year of holding an ICICI Bank account and believe me, there has not been a single day/opportunity for any disappointment! ICICI Bank has the most phenomenal online banking experience and I rate it much better and higher than most of your MNC and Indian counterparts. Be it instant fund transfers to beneficiaries, address change/updations, online DD issuance and collection from any branch, debit card upgrades, ATM accessibility, mobile recharge, bill payments, payment gateway or loan processing, it has ALWAYS been a delight to be an ICICI bank customer. I work for a leading private sector bank myself and have been in the Financial Services industry for 9 years and I would still vouch for the experience of being an ICICI Bank customer. Thank You for showing the way to others and leading the change! All the Best!\n\nIn comparison to the other Banks that I have personally banked with i.e. HSBC, HDFC and Citibank, there is nothing like ICICI Bank. The Banking Features are really incomparable and the best of its class. I have never seen other banks have so many friendly features such as ICICI. Take for example, the Savings Account, Loan Account, Demat, Insurance or Mutual fund...etc, ICICI Bank, its online services and its features are the best I have known. I also see the best Customer Service with ICICI Bank than others. I love banking with ICICI Bank. Thanks.\n\nA big Thank You to ICICI Bank. It has been long due to write an appreciation mail for the entire team of ICICI Bank for the kind of work they do. I am writing this because the Customer Care Executive that I interact with has always understood my problem and provided me a better resolution for it. They do not behave like other bank executives. The team is very polite and understanding.\n\nI am one among the most satisfied customer of ICICI Credit Card. I just feel like using it for any transaction and yes I always do that.\n\nI wish the ICICI team all the very best!!!\n\nI have always wanted to have a savings account with ICICI Bank as I have liked the services it provides to its customers. One more reason for wanting to have a savings account was the number of branches and ATMs that ICICI Bank has. My company provided me with the option of having to select the bank in which I would like to have a salary account. I happily opted for ICICI Bank. I like the Internet Banking services and specially the grid system they provide for online transactions which makes me feel more secure.\n\nAll the best for the future!\n\nI was planning for this from long time, at last I am writing to thank you for all the support and services you are offering at almost no cost or minimal cost.\n\nThe day I still remember when I got my first ATM-cum-Debit Card with free of cost and Internet banking access from where my life has changed. I learned most of the things liking transfer of cash, Paying bills, purchasing online etc..\n\nIn addition to this I hold ICICI Credit Card, and trading accounts.\n\nICICI Bank site is the most easiest Financial site I have ever seen.\n\nI called ICICI Bank in the morning with regards to some details. I spoke with Ms. Prerna who is working in your team. She was more than willing to help from the time the call connected. I started inquiring about multiple things. She has good listening skills, was patient throughout the call, ready to help and sounded happy with a lot of energy. She was more interested in helping than wrapping up the call quickly. I know there are parameters like AHT etc., but she was more interested in providing the Best Customer Service, despite of her parameters getting affected. I am glad that you have hired a person like her to represent ICICI, as she only elevated the Brand with her service and definitely needs appreciation. I wish her all the Best with her career in ICICI Bank.\n\nI am Randhir Kumar Singh, and I am very glad that I visited your branch as I got a very warm response. All my queries were easily resolved by the Manager and the Deputy Manager. They treated me in a very heartwarming way. As I am a wealth account holder in your bank, I got the perfect treatment from your side for which I am very thankful to both. I visited many banks and even the Begusarai branch of your bank, but the solution and treatment expected was fulfilled at the Barauni Branch of your bank.\n\nI look forward to your support and the same treatment from your side in future also. I am very glad to be connected with you and would appreciate if I can contribute to the bank.\n\nI look forward to your support and the same treatment from your side in future also. I am very glad to be connected with you and would appreciate if I can contribute to the bank.\n\nA personal thanks to the Deputy Manager and the Manager. Though I don't know the names in person, but they guided me very well.\n\nI am a customer since 12 years and recently had done a wrong transfer to another ICICI Bank account and almost was sure that I won't get the amount back.I was proved wrong by ICICI Bank customer service.\n\nI need to express my thanks and immense gratitude to ICICI Bank Customer Relationship Manager, Mrs. Sadhna. She has helped me by constantly following-up with different people on this matter and lead it to resolution.She has been regularly following-up on this and ensured to keep me posted and did every thing possible to get the issue resolved.\n\nKindly bestow my thanks and acknowledgement to her and her Manager. People like her carry the brand flag of ICICI Bank.\n\nI wish her all the very best in life and profession.\n\nIt gives me immense happiness and pleasure to explain my customer experience with Mr. Mastan Sheikh (UNS - Team). I work for International Airport Bangalore and due to the heavy work pressure, I was not able to remember the password though I regenerated the password and written it on slip of paper it was lost. He was very kind over the phone and gave me option to use the ATM to transfer the fund, as it was mandatory for me to transfer the amount. Hats off to Mr. Mastan and his quick thinking, though I was impatient that time, he listened to my whole query and gave me appropriate solution.\n\nOnce again thanks a lot Mr. Mastan.\n\nI would really like to thank Mallikarjuna (Malli) from support team who helped me to get the reissued cards(credit and debit cards), which I lost on April 3, 2016. After contacting Customer Care multiple times, I got good response from Malli. He committed me to get the cards to my nearest location(as I shifted from Pune to Bangalore) within 3 days. I am very happy with the service provided by Malli. Thanks a Lot Malli and Keep it up! It was really painful for me on the initial days when I lost the cards. Malli wasfollowing-up for both Credit and Debit Cards Team and ensured that I received my card. Keep it up Malli and please continue with same attitude and support for customer prospective.\n\nThis is to appreciate with my heartfelt thanks to 2 officers posted in your Chandrasekharpur Branch - Ms Smita Jena and Mr Abhishek Jena. They have been very cordial in their dealings and have gone a step ahead in helping me in my banking works in this branch. These 2 people are very proactive, no-ego, helping and charming in their behaviour. I got all the banking works done on time due to their helping hand in the last 1+ year. I thank again these 2 enthusiastic officers and thanks to ICICI Bank for having such generous hands in your office.\n\nOn 22nd March I visited the ICICI Bank branch, nearest to me.. I interacted with one of the employees - Mr Goutam Bhuyan. The interaction was very pleasing. Within just few minutes, I got my work done, even though there was a lot of work at his desk as closing for the day was on. I requested for a Net Banking password just before leaving the branch. I was on the way back from the branch, when I received an SMS regarding the request having been lodged,along with the request number. I also got a phone call from him, confirming the same. This just made me proud to be an ICICI Bank customer. Thanks a million Goutam. Thanks to ICICI Bank.\n\nI wanted to share the wonderful customer service experience given by one of your team member by the name of Astha Kapoor, Customer Service Manager for NRI division - in M.C International, The Mall, Amritsar. When I was in the branch, what a great service she provided. She looked after not only me but other NRIs with great passion and interest. Today back home in Australia, I wanted to open an account for my mom, I was so confused which one to open, and then she rang me from India and sorted everything in 10 minutes. I really thank her because she came forward and is sending someone tomorrow to arrange my mother's account opening. I would like to send my thanks and appreciation to Astha Kapoor of your bank for providing the excellent and prompt service to the NRI clients. She is very calm, patient and her mannerism is great. Quality of company employees is an indication of future success of such a great banks like yours. Please accept my wholehearted appreciation for having a great person like her.\n\nGetting my banking requirements met were proving extremely difficult and I constantly faced unacceptable levels of service, lack of understanding or an interest in helping me, resulting in me having to make several complaints for service failures. Finally, I struck success when Albina D’Cunha came into the frame. She took the time to hear me out, understand my issues and proactively started to address them individually and making sure I was fully updated on the progress. According to me, she is an employee any organisation would be delighted to have. She totally gets the importance of Customer Care and for me was a Godsend. Thank you, Albina, keep up the hard work and I sincerely wish ICICI Bank can take a leaf out of your Book when it comes to Customer Care/Satisfaction and permeates throughout the whole organisation.\n\nI have a Joint NRO and NRE Account with my husband at your Bank. It’s our pleasure to be associated with ICICI Bank for the good service you provide. We have been Banking with you for quite some time now. Banking can be a harrowing job, especially when we come on short leave, but it was not so, because of the excellent service provided by Diksha Jaiswal - Relationship Manager, Santacruz (W) Branch. We can’t thank her enough for the way she answered our queries. We were just shooting out questions at her and she had answers to them all. Her service was so impressive that my brother decided to open an NRE and an NRO Account with you. Through her hard work she helped bring in business to your Bank. Such commitment to great customer service is to be commended. You can be sure that we will continue to do business with ICICI Bank and also speak of your great service to our family and friends. Thank you Diksha, keep up the good work. We wish you every success.\n\nI have a Joint NRO and NRE Account with my husband at your Bank.

She not only dealt with the case like a through professional, but also helped me to overcome my issue with a practical and cost effective solution within no time.All my worries were gone in few minutes! Really appreciate the approach and professionalism of Roopika. Great!!This attitude of Roopika has actually has proven the tag line..\"Khayal Aapka\"\n\nKeep it up Roopika.....!!!!\n\nThanks\n\nI wish to thank and appreciate Mrs Raji (Rajeswari Rajendran) who almost took many requests and solved it by following up with customer repeatedly. In the midst of many such things which are rare, Mrs Raji had been fantastically taking care of the request during her pregnancy period. Sorry for the delay of acknowledging her efforts, but kudos to all her efforts. Great Job Mrs Raji. Raji is definitely one of the good committed employees I have met so far. She provides all the information we want and was never late in any closure of the requests or to respond on our queries. My experience at ICICI Bank Porur - Iyyappanthangal Branch is the best so far. Thank you so much to her for doing her best. And wish you best luck for future. Thank you for the fastest response which really helped to save my time as we were running out of time as I mostly live abroad. I have been using ICICI Bank since many years. Her services are really good. Once again a big thanks to Porur Branch and the whole team for always helping me at the time of need!\n\nWould like to share my experience on a recent visit to T. Nagar Branch with regard to my Home Loan interest rate upgrade. I would like to thank Ms. Gandhi Mathi one of the executives of T. Nagar Branch for helping me on my banking requirements. I am so happy the way she helped me in resolving my requirement as per the timeline which she has given. She was so particular that once my requirement was done, she called up and updated me. I am delighted the way she was supporting the customer no matter who we are. Thank you so much Madam and wish you all the very best and expecting the same kind of help and support for ever. .\n\nI am a Singaporean visiting Chennai for a day. Got into a situation where I was in desperate need of cash. All ATMs were closed and was running around for help. Finally reached T Nagar Branch ICICI Bank, with ICICI Bank ATM card borrowed from a friend hoping for a miracle. I noticed Nirmal Bose, Assistant Manager's friendly face and without hesitation approached him asking for help. Even though he was extremely busy, hearing my situation, he went beyond his call of duty and made sure I get the cash in my hand within minutes. I left Chennai knowing all is not lost in India and there are still kind and dedicated souls exist. We need more people like Mr. Nirmal Bose in our society. I wish Mr. Nirmal all the best in his career and kudos to ICICI Bank for taking care of its customers.\n\nI am extremely thankful for the courteous service rendered by your Mambalam Branch, Chennai. Once again your bank has proved that they are ready to take-up any eventuality. After demonetisation as I was away from my native I happened to be with meager money. As I was worrying how to carry out my remaining days in chennai ICICI Bank came for my rescue. Your Chennai Mambalam Branch Staff has courteous enough to withdraw my requirement. I am extremely thankful to your bank and all your staff especially Mambalama branch. I am proud to say that I am a customer of ICICI Bank.\n\nI am from Chennai and on travel to Kakinada (AP). On the same night Prime Minister, Mr. Modi announced about the note demonetizing the programme, I took train with family and my old parents. Had not more than ?2000 of valid currency. I went to Kakinada ICICI Bank Main Branch looking for some cash today, along with my wife (she has a separate account); and it was one of the most pleasant experience I ever had from Bank staff, in a chaotic situation and demands from customers. Mr. M Patnaik and Mr. Faleed (I hope this name is right) have been very supportive and they explained what they can do best for us, explained options of cheque withdrawal, ATM etc. and gave us requisite cash. I also found the whole ICICI Bank staff, in this branch behaving well with all customers in general. I am privileged customer of ICICI Bank for long time, but today was very good experience! Hats off! Even the security guard has been generally understanding with all the people! I shook hands with them to appreciate in person, but I felt that ICICI Bank Management requires to appreciate whole of ICICI Bank Kakinada Main Branch staff!\n\nI had been to ICICI Bank Chennai Mount Road branch on March 19, 2015 at 09:10 hours to take a Demand Draft (DD). I was informed by a staff that DD issuing officer will come at 10:00 hours and requested to wait. I conveyed my urgency. The Branch Manager, Mr. Ravisankar very politely approached me and asked the purpose for which I was taking the DD and at what time the DD should reach my office. Rushing towards my office at Mylapore, I informed that DD is meant for HDFC housing loan EMI. Immediately the branch manager collected the cheque and the challan meant to take DD and informed me that DD would reach HDFC HFL Mount Road branch before 10:30 hours. To my surprise exactly at 10:10 hours, I got a call on my mobile and conveyed that DD was delivered to HDFC HFL Mount Road branch. Special KUDOS and appreciation to Mr. Ravisankar. ICICI Bank is shining because of people like Ravisankar. I compliment ICICI Bank management for keeping right people at right place. Ever grateful indebted to Mr. Ravisankar.\n\nAs a loyal customer of ICICI Bank, I would like to thank and appreciate Mr. Vijay Baskara Pandiyan, Anna Nagar branch, Chennai for the exemplary level of service offered. When I walked into many banks to avail a loan facility, many didn't want to even listen due to the CIBIL and service issues I had with other banks. That's when I met Mr. Vijay at ICICI Bank, Anna Nagar branch, who is extremely professional and he is the first one who listened to my issues and was able to understand my genuineness and relate to the market and technical issues of the other bank which was the root cause of the problem. Mr. Vijay has followed up consistently until the issue was resolved and kept me aware. He has a brilliant memory and impressive concentration which makes any walk-in customer feel comfortable and creates an image that we have been provided personal services in a professional way by ICICI Bank. Mr. Vijay has gone the extra mile to create the positive experience with ICICI Bank with his sincere follow ups with other teams despite his busy schedules and has helped in resolving the matter at the earliest. Mr. Vijay is one of the best Manager that ICICI Bank has and truly deserves a huge appreciation for his commitment and great attitude. I thank ICICI Bank for having such great managers for the customers and that makes the ICICI Bank experience stand out as world class. Mr. Vijay deserves a very special mention, a STAR attitude.\n\nI have a long association with ICICI Bank. I had earlier applied to open a new “My KID account” with your bank but at the time of account opening there was a spelling mistake in the name. I contacted CIT Nagar Branch Assistant Manager Mr. Vijay , he himself visited to my office and gave a wonderful service and my entire problem was solved on the same day. I really appreciate Vijay’s Service. The people like Vijay help and build our loyalty to the bank. Keep up the good work, it makes me feel relaxed by associating with ICICI Bank Ltd. Kindly convey my good wishes to Mr.Vijay D for making your Bank a customer friendly and innovative Bank.\n\nThis is to place on record my deep sense of admiration and appreciation for Ms. Gayathri Durai of your Teynampet branch Dmat section. I have a mobility constraint and the assistance she renders me at the bank cannot be translated into words. Assistance is an under statement. It is care, concern and comfort all the way.\n\nThough she is in Dmat section, she takes care of all my banking needs transcending all sectional loyalties. After my work is over, she physically escorts me to the car.\n\nIn today's world even daughters would not give so much care. From the time I enter the bank till I leave, it is attention and affection only. To me she is a Mother Therasa in the making.\n\nMay God bless her.\n\nHappen to talk to a customer service executive named Nikita for disposal of my new Chip and PIN card for my account number and she is wonderful, the way she presented and assisted me was awesome. I was in this industry some time before and I know how tough it is, but the way she assisted me was WOW experience. I could sense her smile until she ends up the call from the bottom of my heart. I congratulate her for the fabulous work and the passion she has to serve the customer. Keep it up Nikita and I trust this will reach her and should be pasted on the common board as a token of appreciation, thanks ICICI Bank to hire an agent like this.\n\nI have been banking with ICICI for more than 12 years. I never had a reason to visit my First branch. In fact I don't even know where my Bank Branch is. Thanks to the Internet Banking services provided by ICICI, all my Banking needs are being fully met through the Online platform. I was looking if there will be any reason to visit my branch. But with the new redesigned Internet Banking I hardly doubt I will have a necessity to visit your Branch, though I would love to make a visit to the branch otherwise. Excellent work by the ICICI Bank Online team and kudos to the team who worked on the new Website design. I am yet to explore this fully, but I am confident that it will exceed any customer’s expectation. I am truly delighted on the customer service.\n\nKudos to your Internet Banking site! It is just awesome and very user friendly. I was in dire need of my IT statement for some preceding years and if I had been banking with other bank, I would not have even tried to get it. . But ICICI Bank I knew I have a chance of getting the certificate and I was able to do it through \"View Loan IT certificate\" on your site, just within 5 minutes! Special kudos to your Customer Care team, they were the ones who directed me to the site. I would like to offer my sincere compliments for the entire team of ICICI Bank.\n\nI have been with you for 8 years now and the service you provide, especially your web service, is amazing. I am a globe trotter and I have always found your Bank to be more customer friendly. Also, the responses to the queries on e-mails are very quick. Hats off to you guys for being a part of such an innovative Bank. Everything comes with a passion and you are without doubt a passionate Bank. Keep up the good work! Thank you for having revolutionised the way Indian banks work. Cheers!\n\nDear Mr. Kushal Roy, I would like to thank the corporate cards team in Chennai, I have been working with them for past 3 years and I have had a wonderful service from them, be it in replacing the card or informing about the security threat due to my travel to risky countries like Thailand, Srilanka, the speed is really unbelievable, especially the lady, Thenmozhi in your team has been serving Caterpillar accounts and she had been phenomenal in her action. Due to my continuous travels, I can not afford to wait to receive my card to start my travel. Recently I had only 2 days between my subsequent travel and contacted Thenmozhi to replace my blocked card, she agreed to send someone to deliver it, but it seems the second day her assistants were unavailable. So she came to airport to deliver my card, I was spellbound and she regretted that she could not give the card on time, but I was surprised by her commitment! Thanks a lot and keep up your good work!\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to receive a phone call from you in response to my e-mail requesting for a refund of charges. This was followed by your e-mail accepting my request. What is really amazing is that this was all done in just about 12 hours. I am an admirer of ICICI Bank for your liberal attitude, transparent transactions, up-to-date technology, customer friendly automation, professionalism with a human touch, etc. The list goes on and on and this response to my request has made me indebted to ICICI Bank always. I shall remain your brand ambassador for the common man. Thank you and good luck to you always!\n\nI have gone through the comments given by other customers. They all give only brief appreciations. But I personally wish to say that I have an account with ICICI Bank since 2001. At that time there were not too many ATMs of ICICI Bank and other national banks. But the service provided by ICICI Bank has been marvellous. Even now many banks have a lot of ATMs but they are not on par with the services provided by ICICI Bank. I have had a few problems at some time, but they were due to not following up and I cannot blame ICICI Bank for them. My first bank account was with SBI. Later, I opened an account with ICICI Bank and currently this is the only account I have. I have visited all ICICI Bank branches and it takes only a few minitues to get details. I have not seen such service in any other banks in Chennai. On my recommendation, many of my friends have opened accounts with ICICI Bank. The ICICI Bank debit card is very useful whenever I go out of station. Moreover, it takes just 1 to 2 hours to transfer funds from a bank account in any other state into my account. Many banks are now providing this service but it is not on par with ICICI Bank.\n\nI once again thank all the staff members and the management for providing excellent service even to a Savings Account holder. I wish you the best of luck always!\n\nI am an ardent ICICI bank customer for the last 11 years. I am simply amazed at your technology group in the Bank.. It is easy to get ahead of the game but to stay there all these years - I take a bow. I have never felt the need to walk into a branch. Your online banking is truly online, unlike others who just provide forms online. But I do walk into the bank sometimes just to see how you have improved, and I am always amazed by the continuous improvements (Kaizen) culture that you have. Every time I have walked in I see a difference, an improvement. I was surprised by the cheque scanning and depositing machine. The clinical efficiency of your staff and the productivity is at least 150% more than any other competitor. Given the wide variety and demands of Indian customer profile, to treat everyone with a smile and make them feel special is no mean task. To make all these a part of the culture of an organisation, truly deserves a special mention. I just did not know of a forum to express these. But then whenever marketing folks come from other banks, and tell me thatICICI is bad and all that stuff, I just tell them in reply that they cannot even hold a candle in comparison to the ICICI in technology and service. Given this opportunity I want to express my appreciation to all the staff of this excellent organisation called ICICI Bank. Kudos to you! Keep up your good work!\n\nI have been banking with ICICI Bank for around 6 years now. The response to complaints and the usage of technology (like cheque depositing machine, cash deposit machine) is really worth appreciating. Internet Banking is amazing. I am very happy for the good response they give to customer queries. The best example would be when I had applied for an add-on credit card through the internet. Within 2 days I got it at my address and also when ever I apply for a cheque book, I get it within 2 days at my residence . I am really very happy to bank with ICICI Bank. Internet Banking is superbly maintained. Congratulations to ICICI Bank employees and Management. ICICI Bank Customer Service is a boon to customers because of:\n\n1. Large ATM network\n\n2. Cash Deposit System\n\n3. Cheque Deposit System\n\n4. 8 to 8 banking hours. Very helpful for office going people\n\n5. Internet Banking\n\n6. Phone Banking\n\n7. Debit and Credit Card Online Services\n\n8. Good response and instant action to customer queries via Phone Banking\n\n9. Good response to Internet Banking emails, Cheque book Request, Password Request, Credit and Debit Card delivery by courier service.\n\n10. SMS alerts whenever when customer uses Debit or Credit Card.\n\n11. The first time I mailed, I got the response in just a few minutes. The next time too, it was no different. I congratulate all the employees of ICICI Bank for making the bank the best in all aspects.\n\nICICI Bank is really 100% banking and the no. 1 bank in India and off course all over the world .\n\nHi, I just wanted to take some time off to appreciate the instant response by you folks when I made a transaction of Rs. 45000/-. On 22nd April, I made a transaction of Rs. 45000/- in a merchant outlet and within two minutes of swiping the card, I got an SMS stating that I made a transaction of Rs 45000 and within four minutes I received a call from Mumbai to enquire if I had made a transaction of Rs. 45000/-. I was really surprised by this instant action taken by you guys. These instant actions greatly prevent any misuse done on credit cards. Good work folks. Keep it up!\n\nI have been a customer of ICICI Bank (Habsiguda branch, Hyderabad) for more than 7 years. I recently had to visit this branch and was extremely pleased with the outstanding level of customer service provided by Mr. Eswar Rao Malla (NRI Desk).\n\nMr. Eswar went to great lengths to understand the background and priority of the various banking requests I brought to his attention. He gave me his complete attention for hours, and demonstrated the highest level of commitment to delivering the best customer service I have ever received from any banker in India or anywhere in the world.\n\nMr. Eswar definitely understands the evolving nature of banking and how customer's needs are to be addressed. I have been extremely pleased with the outstanding quality of customer service and support that I received from Mr. Eswar. Because of the outstanding customer service experience, I will remain a loyal ICICI customer forever.\n\nKudos on a job well done, Eswar. Keep up the good work.\n\nThank you and good luck. You have an incredibly bright future and your fantastic personality will be a solid asset in your career.\n\nI would like to extend my appreciation for the services which I received from Miss Neelam Kumari at Bhagalpur branch, Bihar. I was on a visit to Bihar on some personal work and had to visit the branch for some queries. She was very helpful and listened very politely to my questions and resolved them in a very helpful manner. I havenâ€™t used my account in a long time as I was not well. Because of this, I could not use my Debit Card and Net Banking facilities. I thank her for her quick response. The brand name of ICICI bank is taken good care by these new generation employees. I would again like to thank Ms Neelam Kumari for her help.\n\nA supervisor named Sudhakar Reddy called me and helped me to sort the issue right away and I am so happy and satisfied with his service. I would like to give him a Tap on his back for his work. He was actually with me on call till the payment went through and I was able to make the payment without any issues. He helped me so much and I am so relaxed now as I made the payment which was very important for me. I really appreciate his help. I would like to talk to him every time when I call. Thank you so much. I am happy now.\n\nI was introduced to ICICI Bank using Tab Banking when I wanted to open Savings and PPF account for my wife. The request to customer service was forwarded to Rajouri Garden Branch in New Delhi where Mr. Sunil contacted me. The whole experience of opening account was smooth. Apart from savings account I also requested opening PPF account and the issue was that I didn't have much time and we had to submit the 80C proofs in office. Mr Sunil understood our problem and did all in his capacity and even went out of the way to make sure that apart from the account even PPF account got created well before the SLA provided by ICICI bank and regularly updated me the status and at times even post office hours. I am truly satisfied with the customer first approach of ICICI Bank and specially Mr Sunil who truly personifies the belief of ICICI Bank - \"khayaal aapka\"\n\nGood Job guys. Hope I will continue to have great experience with you all.\n\nI have been with ICICI Bank for the last 13 years and I am very happy to share that ICICI Bank, for me, is the best bank in terms of General Banking, iMobile, Credit/Debit Card shopping and so on. I was working in a private company in 1999-2000 and I was very keen to hold a credit card, but none of the banks were showing interest to fulfill my wish because I was earning less than Rs. 3,000.00 that time.\n\nIt was the ICICI Bank which gave importance to my wish and issued me a credit card (my first credit card). This is the reason behind choosing ICICI Bank for all my financial transactions. Now I am enjoying all the desired services of the bank (i.e. Savings Bank Account, FDs, PPF Account, iMobile Service, Debit/Credit Card, Internet Banking, Mutual Funds (Focused Bluechip) etc.So far, I've referred three friends of mine to choose ICICI Bank and it's my continuous effort. If someone asks me which bank one should choose doing banking transactions, I would definitely refer the name of 'the best banker' ICICI Bank.\n\nI am using ICICI Bank Savings Account for the past 6 years and recently I also opened an ICICI Bank Current Account for my new business. ICICI Bank helped me open my first Current Account and I was very pleased with their services and management. My account manager calls me and ask me if I have any problem or query to use my account and they make everything very simple and less paper work makes my work more comfortable and also saves time. Once again thank you for your well professional service. I like your services very much. Thanks ICICI Bank.\n\nI would like to commend Mr. Sanjeev Sharma, Branch Manager, Barakhambha Road, New Delhi, ICICI Bank Branch. He has been truly helpful and extremely professional. We have been working with this branch for a number of years and Mr. Sanjeev Sharma has given us brilliant service and banking support. He has responded promptly, ensured that work was done quickly and went above and beyond to ensure quality service. As we have been going to the branch for a number of years, I can safely say that his management of the branch and staff is the best that I have seen. The staff deals promptly and courteously with all customers, which is a reflection of his leadership. Well done, Mr. Sharma!\n\nI am very grateful to Sakshi Jolly from the East Punjabi Bagh Branch, for her warm welcome and prompt service. She was able to understand the urgency of the issue at hand and provided a detailed step by step procedure to resolve the concern raised. I also found her empathetic and very knowledgeable about the products that she thought would be useful for me. It is one of the best services I have received from a Bank and I look forward to availing similar services and products from the Bank. It would be great if you could pass on the compliment to her and motivate her to keep providing such amazing customer service.\n\nI am writing to sincerely appreciate Ms Twinkle Agrawal - Branch Manager at ICICI Central Market, Punjabi Bagh Branch in New Delhi for the extraordinary service rendered by her. My partner and I had visited the branch to sort out her father's death claim. Amidst the pandemic we had travelled to India only due to the loss of the loved one and were in so much of distress. Furthermore, as NRIs we have been comfortable with ICICI Bank Internet Banking for all our banking needs and seldom visited any branch in India. We visited the Central Market branch where her late father and she held account with lot of apprehensions. However, the Branch Manager Ms Agrawal really came through with utmost professionalism and was empathetic in her approach. She personally handled the case and ensured we were comfortable throughout the process. Having visited 2 other banks in the same timeline where her father held accounts and involved in similar process of FDs and account closures, etc., Ms Agrawal definitely stood out for her exceptional attitude. She truly is an asset to ICICI Bank. Once again, thanks a lot for the warm reception and resolving all our queries. Kindest regards, Bapitha Peethambar NRI Banking.\n\nI am very happy with Mr. Sunil Tripathi who is in Nehru Place Branch. That person solves my problem within 10 minutes. When I was facing a problem from August 4, 2018 and met the above mentioned person on August 13, 2018 he welcomed me and obliged the same. I think he should be rewarded. I agree that if these types of persons are there to help, bank will definitely rise up. I also thank Ms. Monika who is in your backend team she assured me your work will definitely happen shortly and she should also be rewarded. Assurance is the main thing. She also told that in case of any problem in future, I can contact her and she will co-operate with me.\n\nSo nice of both, I salute. Thanking you in advance!\n\nI would like to appreciate the excellent and personalized customer services I received in the Janpath New Delhi Branch, regarding the closure of my accounts.\n\nThe case was dealt by Dy. Manager Ms. Deepa Sachdeva, who quickly resolved some issue that had cropped up, kept me well informed and took pains to conclude the matter quickly and efficiently. I do appreciate her knowledge, professionalism, communication and problem resolving skills. This is in stark contrast to the service that I had encountered earlier by other ill knowledgeable employees.\n\nAn organization is as good as the people in it and Dy. Manager Ms. Deepa Sachdeva is certainly an asset to ICICI Bank and changed my perception of ICICI Bank in a positive manner.\n\nI would like to appreciate the assistance received from Mr. Manjinder Singh Kataria, Branch Manager, Vikaspuri Branch, New Delhi in my recent visit to India as an NRI account holder. He provided prompt, efficient and highly commendable service in activating, resolving and providing accurate and timely information regarding our accounts, especially at the critical time of recent demonetisation. He made us feel valued customer and went extra mile to resolve our banking issues considering our limited time period in India. Kudos to him for the tremendous help and definitely proving ICICI Bank slogan \"Khayaal Aapka\". I felt he is one of the best and hard working Bank Managers ICICI Bank can be proud of. Keep up the good work Mr. Manjinder, really appreciate it. Thanks again for all your help provided to us in those trying circumstances and our short period of stay.\n\nThe real GEM of the Branch at Dwarka Mor, New delhi, Mr. Manish Jha who is cool minded, soft, polite, confident, accurate, passionate, ever-smiling, dedicated, sincere, attentive, good listener and always ready to share the complete load of the Branch. In simple words - ONE MAN Show. Simply amazing and wonderful TEAM WORK in supportive role by Ms. Nivedita Rai.

The ideal joint performance of over-all branch, that too with huge business volume and to handle people (Customers/Non-Customers) visiting at a time, to give priority to each of them and allow them to leave Bank with 100% level of satisfaction and confidence with surety of saving the time, which is not there if they would have visited any other Non ICICIBanks Branches.\n\nI would heartily like to thank Mr. Chetan, New Delhi-West Patel Nagar Branch, who has been a great help for me.\n\nI am a BPO employee and was looking for invest some sort of my hard earned money for which I was looking for a good option. For the same I had visited your West Patel Nagar branch on January 13, 2016 and met Chetan on frontline desk. He understood my requirements and provided me great piece of resolution. Not only this, he resolved my some queries too.\n\nI am glad to appreciate his regular follow ups and tremendous help. Chetan has proved your bank sogan \"Khayaal Aapka\".\n\nIt’s really wonderful for having such a good experience.\n\nGreat Work Chetan... Keep up the Good Work...\n\nI am an account holder for the past 10 years and I became a victim of fraud for the first time. A friend of mine suggested I reach Mr. Atin for help. I am extremely thankful and truly appreciate Mr. Atin at Sector 14, Gurgaon branch for showing compassion and extending his immediate help to block my card even though I have never met him nor have an account in his branch. He is a true hero for ICICI Bank and I hope you have many more who are compassionate and professional towards their customers. He guided me in the next step as well as comforted me with his kind words when I was totally shaken. I truly appreciate his gesture.\n\nI am highly pleased with services of ICICI Bank Branch, BCP, New Delhi. Especially by the response of Mr. Ved Prakash Sharma who he is honest, hardworking and goes the extra mile to help the Bank Customers.\n\nI have a current account with the bank. On September 3, 2015, I visited the Bikaji Cama Place Branch and deposited money in my account. By mistake I had deposited an extra note of Rs. 1,000. After my accounts department realised this, I informed the Bank. It was late in the evening when he called me and informed me to come and collect the money i.e Rs. 1,000 from the bank.\n\nIt was Mr. Ved Prakash who called me several times and finally informed me to collect the same from the Bank.\n\nI highly appreciate what he did. Besides this, he always tries to help the customers by going out of the way.\n\nI would like to compliment the \"Relationship Management\" structure, and today's episode is a classic example of the same working very well. Let me start by confessing that I was skeptical that my issue will be resolved, leave alone fast, but then I chose to call my assigned Relationship Manager - Shreya Srivastav, who as always was very helpful and got the issue resolved in 5 minutes, honestly, I am hugely impressed. Now I know that it may be (or maybe not) a minor thing that she would have had to do, but whatever it is, it was a customer delight moment, and a big thanks to her! Keep it up! I am happy to be associated with ICICI Bank. Please pass on my formal compliments to Shreya as well and hope you recognise her efforts!\n\nI love and feel proud to be a customer of ICICI Bank. I visited Chandni Chowk branch on November 29, 2013. I approached a very senior staff, Shrey (Privilege Desk / Forex Desk). He was very polite and helpful for not only me, but for all of the customers who visited his desk.\n\nHe was also helping new staff in there queries.\n\nI was going to open PPF account in other bank, but now my mood has changed. Now I opened a PPF account with ICICI Bank. I would love to have this kind of service from ICICI Bank in future also. Please also share my compliment with that staff (Mr. Shrey) in front of all Chandni Chowk Branch.\n\nI want to record my appreciation for the excellent service I received yesterday.\n\nMy daughter who is a Doctor, wanted a draft to be made for the registration charges for appearing for the counselling for a PG course at Delhi in the morning of April 15, 2011. She told me about this around 8 p.m. yesterday, by which time the ICICI Bank at East Of Kailash (where I have my Savings Bank Account) was closed.\n\nI was in a fix as April 14, 2011 was a bank holiday and if any thing had to be done , it should have been done yesterday.\n\nIf my daughter doesnâ€™t get the draft she will not be allowed to attend counselling on April 15, 2011. I called up Siddharth Raj Singh, the Branch Manager of the East Of Kailash branch, who told me not to worry. He had a telecon with his counterpart at GK-1 Branch, which remains open till 8 p.m. and asked him to arrange for the draft.\n\nAlthough the GK-1 branch closes at 8 p.m. , I was told that they would help me even if I reach them by 8.30 p.m.\n\nI reached the GK-1 branch around 8.15 p.m. and within a few minutes the draft was in my hand. This is â€˜customer delightâ€™ and I would like to extend a special thanks to Siddharth Raj Singh, the Manager of the East Of Kailash Branch. Continue the same spirit.\n\nHi, Iâ€™d like to specially thank Ms. Manpreet Ahluwalia, from NBCC place ICICI Branch Delhi. She has extended all possible help whenever I approached her.

I am really happy and this experience has also changed my whole perception towards the bank. ICICI Bank and its customer is lucky to have you in the organization Anish and is not the vice versa. It is people like you who justify our decision of choosing ICICI Bank. I really appreciate the time & efforts taken by you. Thanks once again & continue the good work.\n\nI have my account in ICICI Bank since last 30 months only. But I have been in a lot of different circumstances with them. Every single time, I have seen a better part of their customer service. The way people handle the issues, if they do not know something, they ask the appropriate person and get your issue sorted out. I have been to various branches of this bank, and found more than satisfactory customer services. Specially, I would like to mention the one in Sector-15,Rohini, Delhi. They really look out for what you are looking for and give you the best possible service. Keep up the good work ICICI Bank and keep raising the benchmark of the industry in India.\n\nI would just like to mention that the staff in Block C 2, Jankpuri is very co-operative. They help us by providing solutions to our problems at each step. I would like to make a special mention of the person on Counter 3, who used to make drafts and carry out other work also. I like the work done by the staff and am very thankful to Mr. Neg of this branch, who without being formal, provided me with the best solutions to my problems. Also, he would hear me out immediately. I really appreciate the work done by the staff. I have been to this branch a number of times and every time these people have provided me with their full support.\n\nI hold a savings a/c and gold credit card with your bank but to pay all my utility bills i had to spend a lot of time in standing in the line waiting for my turn due to which my lot of time got wasted, it was till the time i had visited your New friends colony branch in New Delhi where i met Mr. Madan Mohan Jha who gave the information about your net banking services and also about the convenience of using it and getting benefits from it. I had always heard about the internet banking but because of so many frauds occurring everyday ,i was very scared of using this service but thanks to Mr. Jha who made me understand about the convenience of using net banking, telling me about the safety of using it and also explaining to me that, it is a secured way of making online transactions. Today I am sitting in my home watching T.V and making payments for my mobile bills, credit card, electricity bills, all thanks to Mr. Jha and ICICI bank for making all these things hassle free and tension free.\n\nReally you people had made banking a pleasure for me.\n\nMy compliments to Kamran Masood, the Wealth Manager at ICICI Bank, Preet Vihar, Delhi, who handles my account. He has sound knowledge of the subject. He inspires trust and confidence. While securing business for the Bank, he gives you the feeling that he is on your (the customer's) side. He shows maturity beyond his years. The right attributes for a person in this role. Often, one is motivated to give business to the Bank for Kamran's sake! Doubtless he receives guidance from his supervisors and seniors at the Bank. My best wishes to him, and many thanks to the Bank.\n\nI would like to share the experience I had with ICICI bank, I have been in relationship with ICICI Bank for more then 5 years and I never faced any issue or dissatisfaction.\n\nDuring the said period I have been in relationship with other banks but none of the bank having variety of solution on internet as ICICI Bank has and I sincerely appreciate the net-banking solution of ICICI Bank which never allowed me go to any branch.\n\nBest part of online banking is that its very user friendly, end to end solutions on board, high security features and lots more.\n\nHats off to the team managing online banking.\n\nI have had the account with ICICI since last 10 years now and I would like to quote that this is one of the best banks in the market today and I never faced any problem with them till now and all my queries or concerns were amicably sorted out. Their dependency on internet is one of the best features and helps the people on move without having to waste too much of time waiting in the queue. From a satisfied customer. Keep up the good work.\n\nI just called up the Customer Care in Delhi and was really glad to be assisted in such a nice manner. The agent on the call (Abhay) was very helpful and was eager to give me suggestions for my benefits. Apart from solving the issue for which I had called up the Customer Service Line, he also solved a major issue for which I had thought I'll have to contact the nearest ICICI Bank Branch. This was a perfect call and wonderful support which I have got from the ICICI Bank Customer Support. I also had a word with the Relationship Manager (Reena) who also spoke in a really helpful and a positive tone. I must admit that you guys know how to respect your Customers. It's highly appreciable.\n\nI just wanted to compliment the patience and customer friendly attitude of your representative Mr. Jibu John. Jibu spoke to me on the phone for almost one hour twenty minutes and even at the end of the call had such amazing composure, it was great. I work for a service industry and I know no one actually does something like he did.\n\nPlease ensure that these compliments reach him and he is aware of a wonderful experience I had while in conversation with him.\n\nTwo thumbs up Jibu. Way to go!\n\nI would like to thank Mr Abhijeet Ingle for his patience and co-operation. I had transferred my money from my HDFC Bank Account to my ICICI Bank Account. By mistake, it was transferred to my Account about which I had no information. Mr. Abhijeet helped me throughout the process and guided me on how I should proceed further. He was online with me for almost an hour and was very patient. He asked me not to worry and also assured me that my money was safe.\n\nThanks a lot Mr Abhijeet! I do not know where you are, however, I really wish to thank you. Warm regards.\n\nHi ICICI! It has been a surprising experience to be your customer. Your fast, accurate and warm customer handling is fantastic. I really appreciate your service. However, understanding the fact that everything can't be perfect, I would like to comment and request once more. I could not see my e-bank statement that I received in in my e-mail. When I click on the PDF folder, I couldn't find my Bank Statement. Please give me the easiest step to see it as I'm new in this field. Thanks...\n\nI would really like to thank one of the Officers, Mr. Basheer from the Credit Card division for his excellent support. I had discussed the matter of Credit limit enhancements before with few other executives from time to time but never got a satisfactory guidance. I would really appreciate Mr. Basheer for his patience and courtesy he had extended during the call and gave me with a very satisfactory solution to my queries. I would like to say that such employees are a good asset to the bank.\n\nI shall always be very thankful to the Asst. Branch Manager, Mr. Ashutosh Sharma of your branch at Deoria, Uttar Pradesh. I had been robbed by my own driver and again I was about to carry a huge amount of cash with him in my car. But thanks to your dynamic officer who suggested that I do not carry cash with me. He made a P.O. of the amount and made me travel safely. I am really proud of the service provided by the staff of your Bank.\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to Nibedita, Raveena (woman at cash counter) and one more woman working in Saraidhela, Dhanbad branch. They have been extremely polite and calm in handling the rush and interacted very well with the customers. This trio uphold the core banking values and were extremely well at Respect, Integrity and Customer services. It was customer delight at the best and made my banking experience a wonderful one despite of me standing in the queue for more than an hour due to crowd. They all are a great asset for the bank. Please pass on this appreciation to them. The experience was indeed Khayaal Aapka.\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to Nibedita, Raveena (woman at cash counter) and one more woman working in Saraidhela, Dhanbad branch.

My today's experience has made me delighted & happy to have a banking relationship with a bank whose employees are so motivated that they are at the service of the customer even after office hours.\n\nToday I had visited ATM at Dombivali, TATA power line branch. I did not realize that some debit & credit cards fell from my wallet. After some 2-3 hours I was contacted by your employees who personally handed me the cards (ICICI Card & other bank cards too) at 9.00 PM in the night.\n\nIf my card had gone in wrong hand, I would have suffered great financial loss.\n\nI want to thank your employees Mr Mandar Abhyankar & Mr Deepak Pathak for going out of the way & helping me .\n\nI would like to comment on Mrs. Soja Jose, Relationship Manager of ICICI Bank, Kaloor, Kochi. I had been to the Branch along with my daughter for transfer of amount to an Educational Institution abroad. The moment I met her she was very helpful. Customer Service was Excellent. She took the initiative of filling the form, managed the whole process with ease, spoke very softly, took interest to listen and answer all the questions with patience. There was no delay in doing any work and my amount has been transferred successfully. I really appreciate her and such people should be rewarded. It was indeed a wonderful experience with ICICI. I also take the opportunity to thank each one in the Bank who have been indirectly helpful. Amazing Team Work too. Thank You.\n\nI take this opportunity to congratulate ICICI Bank team of Muvattupuzha branch, Kerala and express my sincere thanks to them for helping many like me to deal with the current transition period of financial reforms with minimum pain and efforts! Irrespective of the status of the customers - whether they are account holders or not, your team in Muvattupuzha branch extended best possible attention and service to everyone who walked into the branch for currency exchanges and other services. Senior Manager, Mr. Santhosh Sreedharan and his team were present at the desks to ensure smooth transactions. The moment you walk into the branch, you are greeted by a staff and asked what kind of service you would be looking for! Then, while you are in the queue, they prepare you with necessary forms and help with formalities and by the time it is your turn at the desk, you are ready with all documents and formalities completed! This ensured hassle free transactions at minimum time. Before you leave the desk, the lady who is incharge informs you “we will be working also on Saturday and Sunday Sir...” that too with a smiling face!! Only a dedicated team with customer-centric work culture and great philosophy can do this!! In addition, I request you to kindly convey my heartfelt congratulations and thanks, to Team ICICI Bank, Muvattupuzha. I also request you to kindly consider rewarding them suitably for the kind of extra efforts they put in.\n\nI would like to express my gratitude to ICICI Bank for the customer service.\n\nI have been a customer of ICICI Bank for close to 8 years now, holding 2 savings accounts and 1 credit card. Till date I have not done any late payments on my credit card even if my purchases goes high month on month. But last month, for the bill of Rs 44000, I made a mistake and made early payment of Rs 7000 before the bill was generated, which went on by prior month’s bill. Unaware of the situation, I made rest of the payment on the due date. When November bill was generated, I noticed that I was charged with Interest for not making the full payment.\n\nSo on 30th November, I called customer care to clarify this and I spoke to Sreesha, who explained me about the payments. Even though it was my mistake, she clarified my query and was ready to reverse the interest charges as a good will gesture. I understand Banking is a business where an interest charge is the bread and butter. Even then, considering and valuing a customer does make a difference. Your associate Sreesha, have made my day and have taken my satisfaction on ICICI Bank to an advocacy level. Cheers!\n\nIt is with great gratitude that I write this comment. Though it is a fact that the Bank is giving us very good service consistently, yet, on behalf of my staff, I would like to pay my sincere appreciation, especially to Ms Reena Singh, Deputy Branch Manager, Neelam Bata Road Branch, Faridabad. Me and my staff have always eye witnessed and we don’t have words to recap the self-defying services she renders to the Bank's clients. She is a real asset to ICICI Bank and hope that their tribe (Madam Reena like employees) increases. I also express thanks for all other staff in our Bank Branch for their services also.\n\nI have long association with ICICI Bank. I have deposited Rs. 30,000 in Sector-10A Gurgaon branch. I had given uncounted notes to my boy to deposit in my account alongwith a voucher of Rs. 30,000. Actually the total amount of money was Rs. 32,000 in the denomination of (1000*17) (500*30). Mr. Parmod Verma Cashier immediately took prompt action, first he inquired from my boy about total amount and then called me up and inquired about the excess amount. He then immediately returned the excess amount to me. Its people like Parmod Verma who help and build our loyalty to the bank. Keep it up the good work, it makes me feel relaxed with the association with ICICI Bank Ltd.\n\nI am your satisfied customer since last several years. I got very efficient services from your bank and your officers come forward to help us in meeting our needs. On 27th May13, I deposited Rs3 Lacs in my saving account for making an FD. On that day I was little disturbed and instead of deposing Rs3 Lac, I deposited Rs.3.5 Lacs and mentioned Rs 3Lacs in deposit form.\n\nAfter depositing the money and FD form, I came back to my work place. In the mean time, I received the phone call from Mr. Gaurav Kumar and he informed that I have deposited Rs50000 more and I may collect the cash from Bank or he can deposit the cash in my saving account.\n\nIt was indeed an honest work done by Mr. Gaurav Kumar. It shows the character he has and upbringing he received from his family/parents. I highly appreciate his honesty and wish him all the great success in his life.\n\nKindly convey my good wishes to Mr.Gaurav Kumar and all other officers for caring the customers and making your Bank a customer friendly and innovative Bank.\n\nI am writing this note to thank you for your awesome customer services over the last 2 weeks. I have received home loan & Top Up Loan money and the entire process was extremely smooth and very professionally handled by Branch Credit Manager Shipra Singhal and Abhishek. However, the kind of response, pro-activeness, timeliness and customer service I received from you is unparallel. Though the interest rate that I was offered by your competitors was less, I am still happy giving that extra to you folks. Your attitude and personal touch compensated for that extra 1 percent. In this era of extremely competitive world and high customer centric environment, I am very pleased to see ICICI employing people like you who understand the true meaning of customer delight. Keep up the great work and keep winning hearts.... not just customers!! Once again, I thank you and please pass the same to your team members who are working with you at the back end.\n\nThanks Ones again,\n\nI received a fraud call advising that my reward points would be credited on my credit card. He asked for card details, issue date and expiry and then for OTP and CVV no. I refused to share and ended the call. Immediately I called up ICICI customer service and spoke to Saiprasad who helped me to block the card and advised me that bank would never ask for any details from the customer. Further assured that it was a fraud call and would send this number to the business analysis department who would look into this and penalize them if required. Thanks Saiprasad for helping me out and explaining the norms of the bank.\n\nThis is regarding the experience I got at Fatehabad Branch. I am a wealth account holder of the bank. Yesterday I got a gold loan from the bank that was continuing from last one year. I closed the same earlier and got the same again. I will say that the experience was wonderful at the ICICI Bank branch. Specifically BM Manoj Kumar. Anjali and Priyanka helped and does make it possible to put these compliments. I will again and again admire the response and treat I got in the branch. I will always make the best efforts to make the business of ICICI Bank whether that may be in form of new accounts or in conveying someone regarding loans or KCC. I always want that ICICI Bank should be the top private sector bank.\n\nI have all my accounts with ICICI Bank. I have a saving account, current account and 2 policy with ICICI Prudential. This is all just for conveying...and appreciating ICICI Bank.\n\nI am writing this text to appreciate the wonderful services of your Bank’s staff Mr Ram. Recently, I visited your Bank for the issuance and cancellation of a Demand Draft and I was attended with utmost professional attitude and perfection by Mr Ram. I was upset because I had only one cheque and also a short time but he made sure that all my queries were resolved. He made me feel very comfortable and issued the DD. I was pleased to visit your Bank and I feel I have made the right choice. I would like to thank your staff, Mr Ram, for his warm reception and patience in answering all my queries and ensuring that all my doubts are resolved. He even helped me at the time of the cancellation of the same DD. Once again, thanks a lot for serving my needs with such warmth.\n\nDear ICICI Bank, I am not your customer but wish to be in future. I am writing this letter to you just to say 'THANKS' for your wonderful thought better to say philosophy \"chhoti-chhoti batein hamesha chhoti nahi hotin\". When I first noticed it. I found a key to human relationships. As it is said 'Charity begins at home' so I suggest your staff to apply this philosophy in their family relations first,then among bank staff and then to their customer and see its positive results within few days. It is not a simple suggestion but Â I have applied Â this in my relationshipsÂ for a week and found a great change in my behaviour and attitude.\n\nI am having a Savings account at your Sector-18, Noida Branch. But I am operating most of the time from Ghaziabad as my residence is in Ghaziabad. My account is from Year 1996 and I have recently superannuated from NTPC as Executive Director. I have pleasure in informing you that I am getting very good service in terms of fast action and sincere advice from Privilege Banking team. In this regard I must appreciate Ms. Megha Tonk who is helping me whenever I am having any banking problem.\n\nI thought that we must acknowledge the good service instead of people complaining all the time.\n\nI would like to extend my gratitude as I appreciate the support and guidance provided by my Relationship Manager - Ms. Tanya Sinha. She has been humble, calm and showed her best support in resolving all my queries and issues with my Holding Account. Not just that, she helped me with the investments/operations and other things in my ICICI Direct Account as well. She has always gone beyond the bars to arrange help and guide me in the best way to ease my issues. I wish my ICICI Direct Relationship Manager was helpful enough so that I troubled Tanya lesser. Overall I am really happy with her support as she is always on her toes to help people with their queries. Thank You Tanya!\n\nI am thankful to Mohini Rane of Sector-14, Gurgaon Branch who resolved a query by understanding my pain & agony and showed personal interest in resolution. I would also like to appreciate the efforts of Mr. Rishabh Singh at ICICI Bank’s Wealth Management Branch at sector 14 Gurgaon, who went out of his call of duty to support me. I really appreciate their attitude of working towards customer centricity and delight. ICICI Bank should indeed be proud to have both of them with them. They are real assets to any organisation and people like them make ICICI Bank a great organisation. Keep up the great work Mohini and Rishabh and thank you once again.\n\nMy name is Anmol. I am glad to share that ICICI Bank Guru Dronacharya Branch people understand customers very well. I really want to appreciate Shraddha Jain who takes care of the ‘Accounts and Deposit’ counter. I was in emergency and bank server got down. But this lady committed to me that the amount will be deposited in sometime. I went to my work and got a call from Shraddha for confirmation. It was really urgent. Even bank time was over but still this girl helped me a lot. ICICI Bank should hire more people like this. Will post it on social media also.\n\nThanks Shraddha Jain\n\nI would like to place on record my appreciation for Ms Shweta Pandey and Mr. Sagar Kapoor at ICICI DLF Qutab Place Gurgaon branch. Ms Shweta was very understanding and responsive in handling my loan foreclosure request. Ms Shweta ensured that the service request was initiated and followed up to completion in a timely manner. Mr Sagar ensured that timely communication was given to me so that I could make myself available on time for document retrieval. Keep up the good work team! My best wishes are with you. Sincerity, professionalism & commitment that you demonstrated, will take you very far in your career & life. All the very best and thank you! ??\n\nI have my account with ICICI since Dec 2006.

I hope we continue to receive top class banking solutions and facilities from you. Cheers!!!!!\n\nThanks to you, Mr. Balamurugan and to your entire staff of Hosur Branch on the Krishnagiri Road.

Thanks to you and your amazing team.\n\nI am writing to let you know how much I appreciate the outstanding service that ICICI Bank staff has provided by Mr. Abdul Quddus and team. I have visited the ICICI Bank branch (Dr. A S Rao Nagar) couple of time to withdraw cash but was informed no cash available. I was in need of immediate cash and then tried reaching the Branch Manager. I got in touch with Mr. Abdul and expressed the domestic emergency I was in. He then assured me of help in 2 hours. Keeping in mind the queues at the branch, I know I have added a task to his regular duties, which he has acknowledged as a true gentleman. An immediate response is always admired. I have received a call at 4:45 PM from Mr Abdul, who has coordinated with Mr. Vamshi Krishna to arrange the necessary cash for withdrawal. It is because of such efforts, people feel special to be associated with ICICI Bank. This ability to provide the resolution quickly exceeded my expectations.\n\nFinally, I don’t feel the need to wish you success, your passion to excel in crunch situation exhibit your DNA.\n\nThank you Mr. Abdul Quddus, Mr. Vamshi Krishna and team.\n\nEverybody know that what the situation is in India after demonetisation of ?500 and ?1000 notes. On 10/11/2016, I went to Moosapet ranch and exchanged the old notes with the new one and I had been regularly visiting the branch as my company and I are associated with the bank since last 7 yrs. I was amazed by the services given by the staff to each and every single person who visited. The way they handled the situation was excellent.\n\nThey never differentiated with any person whether the customer or not and treated with equality.\n\nFrom branch manager to security guard all were helping people coming to their doorsteps.\n\nI would like to thanks and salute each and every staff of the branch.\n\nI had inadvertently issued cheques from my ICICI Bank account instead of issuing them from another bank account. Only when I received an automated call from ICICI bank, did I realize my mistake. My visit to this branch was so fruitful and the team there led by Ms. Sravanti N was extremely helpful, empathetic and kind.\n\nMs. Sowjanya (the "
