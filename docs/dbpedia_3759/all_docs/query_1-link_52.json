        "text": "The patient was then recommended for monthly follow-ups with specific physiotherapy exercises for strength and stability. Multivitamin supplements were prescribed to support growth and development. When the patient came for follow-up after 2 months, patient was examined to assess improvements. Her weight was now 8.3kg (<5th percentile) and head circumference is 45.8cm (25th percentile). On examination, improvement was noted in the following areas: head control, proprioception, muscle tone, ability to sit, core strength, weight bearing and cognition as tested on BSID-4 scales.\n\nOverall improvement regarding her growth was seen. The mother was recommended to continue home exercises on the infant regularly. The supplements were continued as before.\n\nCase Discussion\n\nCSSs are a group of rare congenital neurodevelopmental disorders caused by various genetic mutations that affect the nBAF complex. Here, we present a case of TYPICAL/ATYPICAL in a patient with CSS-6, who was diagnosed with an unexpected ARID-2 mutation. The estimated prevalence of the CSS-6 variant is a few hundred cases, as determined by experts. Family history can be negative such as in this case [2].\n\nIn the presented case, negative family history is suggestive of a de novo mutation. The mechanism by which de novo mutations occur is fundamentally related to epigenetics, genetic mutations secondary to environmental hazards, toxins, and specific electromagnetic frequencies [7-9]. The epidemiological and clinical consequences of these mutations are CSSs, which severely damage the normal and healthy development of affected infants. As previously stated, this may include developmental abnormalities and developmental delays [10]. There are several common clinical features of de novo mutations, the most significant feature of which is Intellectual Disability (ID). Coffin siris syndrome can be suspected when a patient presents with distinctive facial features such as a wide mouth, thick lips, thick eyelashes and brows, broad nose, flat nasal bridge, extra hair growth on the face and body, sparse scalp hair, small head size, intellectual disability, craniosynostosis, speech delay, delay in motor skills such as sitting and walking, underdeveloped fingertips or toes, missing \"pinkie\" fingernails or toenails, frequent respiratory infections in infancy, feeding difficulty in infancy, failure to thrive, short stature, low muscle tone, loose joints, eye abnormalities, heart abnormalities, brain abnormalities and kidney abnormalities [5,11]. These features present variably, and a high index of clinical suspicion, in addition to the exclusion of common clinical conditions, is required to make the diagnosis.\n\nThe final diagnosis requires Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) and confirmatory gene analysis. In this patient, a Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed craniosynostosis. Computed Tomography (CT) is an excellent diagnostic test for bone-related conditions [12]. The most mutated genes in craniosynostosis were FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST1, and EFNB1. Craniosynostosis with ARID-2 mutations is rare [13]. Before gene analysis, only clinical suspicion was provided for diagnosis and treatment. Gene analysis is highly specific for diagnosing rare syndromes [14] and has enhanced the capacity to provide care for specific syndromes.\n\nTreatment of coffin siris syndrome is nonspecific. Currently, only available treatment options are supportive. Conservative management and emotional support are the mainstays of current management. Current treatment aims to help the patient achieve an average growth rate, physical health, and mental health. Thus, tailored physiotherapy may be a helpful adjunct [15]. Simple passive movement exercises to improve muscle tone, and emotional support are crucial home care elements. Regular structured exercises are important for improvement in motor activities [16]. Caregivers can have a significant impact on improving the well-being of a child [17]. Regular follow-up and assessment of exercise efficiency is essential. Craniosynostosis can be corrected using surgery or special molding helmets. Indications for surgery include cosmetic improvement and, in some cases, to relieve the intracranial stress due to small cavity. Except for cosmetic improvement, however, no significant gains in cognitive outcomes were noted [18].\n\nSupplemental nutrition may be appropriate for stimulating neurological growth and brain function [19]. Monthly follow-ups are required to assess improvement in growth rate. The presented case reported improved cognition and neuromuscular growth with supplemental nutrition and regular exercise. Despite the notable improvement, the prognosis for this patient remains uncertain. In the absence of long-term studies, information on the life span of Coffin-Siris syndrome is not available. Uncommonly, aspiration pneumonia and seizures have proved fatal for children with CSS [20]. Efforts are underway by the Coffin-Siris Syndrome International Consortium to obtain more data and find other treatment options.\n\nAverage life expectancy is unlikely. An underdeveloped cerebral cortex leads to growth abnormalities, feeding problems [21], poor nutrition, hearing abnormalities, ocular abnormalities, and frequent infections. While not noted here, some patients have cardiac defects such as ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus. Renal and genitourinary abnormalities such as horseshoe kidney and hypospadias might be present [5]. The treatment is problem specific. Periodic surveillance for eye disorders, scoliosis, hearing loss, behavior abnormalities, and hormonal imbalance/bone age is appropriate to prevent complications during childhood and adolescence [22].\n\nConclusion\n\nARID-2 gene mutation in patients of CSS is uncommon. This study gives information regarding CSS, the genes involved, and the management of such rare conditions. This study can serve as a background for the diagnosis and management of Coffin-Siris syndrome.\n\nReferences"
