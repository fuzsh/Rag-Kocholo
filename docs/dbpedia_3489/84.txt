THE INVISIBLE WAR is a 2013 investigative documentary that features the powerfully emotional stories of several young veterans who experienced sexual harassment and assault in the military. The documentary prompted Senate Bill 1752, more commonly known as the Military Justice Improvement Act as an attempt to reform military court procedures and address the way that sexual assault in the United States military is handled through the military justice system and the chain of command.
