        "text": "Anyone Who Had a Heart, Do You Know the Way to San Jose, Walk on By, and Alfie are all pop songs that instantly conjure up the familiar melodic voice of Dionne Warwick. This documentary paints a portrait of the inspiring woman behind that voice. In a music world profoundly divided between black and white, Dionne Warwick forged a successful singing career from New Jersey gospel choirs to international cross-over super stardom. From her hit-making collaborations with Burt Bacharach and Hal David to her money-making collaboration with Elton John, Gladys Knight, and Stevie Wonder recording the AIDS charity single Thatâs What Friends Are For, Dionne Warwick has made an indelible mark on the music world and a positive impact on several social causes. Beyond this film, co-director Dave Wooley has been a long-time collaborator with Dionne Warwick, producing her concert events and co-writing three books with her including her autobiography My Life, As I See It, and the childrenâs book Say a Little Prayer which was nominated in 2009 for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work for Children."
