        "text": "Nate von Zumwalt, Editorial Coordinator\n\nKirby Dick’s 2012 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award winner confronts one of the most disturbing and underpublicized injustices in America today: an epidemic of rape in the U.S. armed forces. An estimated 30-percent of servicewomen are sexually assaulted during their enlistment, with a majority of the cases never resulting in prosecution or conviction. Dick’s unwavering documentary makes use of explicit accounts from the victims themselves as it bluntly exposes the facts behind this insidious cycle of crime and governmental negligence.\n\nThe Invisible War probes perhaps the gravest acts of crime by those accountable for our safety, and the ineffable layers of cover-up and deceit that follow. The film was supported in 2011 and 2012 as the recipient of two Sundance Institute Documentary Film Grants."
