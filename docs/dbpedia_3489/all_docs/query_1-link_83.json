        "text": "Five years ago, director Chris Paine sent a jolt through the automotive world with “Who Killed the Electric Car,” a conspiratorial documentary presenting an array of suspects responsible for General Motors putting the kibosh on its highly praised prototype, the EV1.\n\nThe defendants were numerous, ranging from Big Oil to political backstabbers. And Paine left it up to us, the jury, to decide who carried the most culpability in depriving the world of an energy efficient, environmentally protective electric car with great looks and high-performance capabilities.\n\nWhile some were guiltier than others, everyone involved in the EV1’s demise drew the ire of viewers. And along with the anger came the sorrow of seeing GM irresponsibly sending some 2,000 perfectly sound EV1s to their untimely death inside a metal crusher. And no one was sadder than electric enthusiasts like Tom Hanks and Danny DeVito, whose offers to buy their leased EV1s from GM were soundly rejected.\n\nThat was more than a decade ago, and a lot has changed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and soaring gas prices. Now, electric is all the buzz from Detroit to Stuttgart to Tokyo, as the likes of Chevy, Mercedes and Nissan rush to fill their showrooms with hybrid vehicles.\n\nAnd there to chronicle the EV’s phoenix-like rise from the compactor is Paine, whose “Revenge of the Electric Car” goes behind what were once enemy lines to yield a fascinating look at the evolution of the next generation of EVs from concept to mass production.\n\nIn the process, we meet such colorful characters as the cigar-chomping General Motors Vice President Bob Lutz, champion of the Chevy Volt; Carlos Ghosn, the risk-taking CEO behind Nissan’s all-electric Leaf; and dot-com billionaire playboy Elon Musk, the co-founder of the Silicon Valley upstart, Tesla Motors. With cameraman Thaddeus Wadleigh in tow, Paine follows each as they craftily maneuver through the ups and downs of making a dream a reality in the midst of a faltering economy.\n\nAlthough all three are basically stinking rich, mansion-dwelling snobs, you can’t help but root for them to succeed; almost as much as they root for each other, as they tirelessly invest their time and resources to expand a niche market into an international phenomenon.\n\nBut you also cannot avoid being troubled by Paine’s undying adulation for each man and his creation, failing to raise a critical eyebrow over the numerous shortcomings of electric vehicles, from their short battery life to hefty price tags ranging between $40,000 for a Volt and nearly $110,000 for the sleek-looking Tesla roadster.\n\nPaine also oversells their environmental benefit, failing to mention that it takes thousands of environmentally harmful coal and nuclear power plants to produce their “clean-burning” electrical fuel. Nor does he refer to the risks posed by the disposal of their 500-pound lithium-ion batteries once their 10-year life is exhausted; or the $10,000 cost to replace them.\n\nStill, even if you can’t keep those nagging questions out of your head, it’s impossible not to get caught up in the thrill of watching Lutz, Ghosn, Musk and EV-conversion entrepreneur Greg Abbott do something rare these days – making something out of nothing; and in the process, create jobs.\n\nThat entrepreneurial spirit fills every frame of “Revenge of the Electric Car,” and I dare say it delivers quite a charge in celebrating a revolution of an industry that for much too long has been full of gas."
