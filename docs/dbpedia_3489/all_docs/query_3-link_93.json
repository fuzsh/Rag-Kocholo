The level of that ambition only became apparent towards the end of the task – probably a good thing, as we might otherwise never have attempted to write this book. After having dipped into fields ranging from Egyptology to evolutionary biology, a sense of our own shortcomings as writers led us to rely on the expertise and kindness of many specialists. The generosity of the responses of those we approached for comment was heart-warming and enormously helpful. The academic world is filled with experts in specialist fields, and stepping into such terrain can be a nerve-wracking and dangerous affair. Because we skim over areas to which scholars have devoted years of research, there are many sins of omission and commission, along with our obstinate interpretation of the literature. We take full responsibility for these sins, but we would like to thank all of the following for their assistance and very useful observations and commentary. We are grateful to Salima Ikram, for advice on ancient Egypt, and Claudia Tocco for checking our facts on Ulisse Aldrovandi.

Our thanks go as well to John Meyer, who translated a section of Aldrovandi’s De animalibus insectis for us. Chris Collingridge shared his illuminating pictures of dung beetle research. Beautiful beetle pictures were loaned by Adrian Bailey and Shaun Forgie.

He was in the bush with his friends, playing with dung beetles. These friends, a group of scientists from Sweden, Australia, Germany and South Africa have managed to get together every year since 2003 to run experiments on dung beetle orientation. We had already shown that dung beetles were the first animals known to be able to orientate by polarised light from the moon. Our next task was to measure how the nocturnal species performed when compared with their diurnal (day-active) counterparts. This involved working all day and most of the night when the moon was in a particular phase, getting slimmer as it waned into a silver sliver lying on its back in the African sky. We were tired but happy. The nocturnal beetles were incredible; they could roll their dung balls in a straight line under a cat’s whisker of a moon. But when the moon was absent and we relaxed, drinking cold beer under the light of the Milky Way, we were fixated with the sky. If we could see this ethereal light, then surely the beetles could too, and therefore use it for orientation? At the time only humans, along with a few species of birds and seals, were known to be able to orientate by the stars. Our beetle companions were a (relatively) large, enigmatic ball-rolling species called Scarabaeus satyrus. We knew they could do ix\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nit, but needed to prove it with scientific rigour. The key challenge was to stop the beetles looking at the sky, which is equivalent to asking a goldfish not to swim. How does one stop a beetle looking at the sky? Not so difficult if you fit it with a little peaked cap. But not that easy either when it has no ears to hook things onto, and its head is flat and shiny and has evolved to stop anything sticking to it. Nevertheless, once their hats were glued precariously in place, the capped beetles were lost, wandering aimlessly with their dung balls, all dressed up and nowhere to go. Ten minutes earlier, the same uncapped individual had streaked across the starlit savanna with the confidence of a taxi driver heading for home. Problem solved – the beetles obviously needed to see the sky to find their way around – but which bit? The night sky, even without the moon, is a complex conglomerate of constantly moving light. Unpicking which part of the sky the beetles needed for pathfinding would reveal the compass cues they were using. This suggested that we should take them on a trip to the planetarium. Night after night, the dependable beetles enthusiastically pushed dung balls around the Johannesburg planetarium, responding to the pinpricks of light reflected from the domed ceiling with gusto. By systematically removing elements of our ersatz night sky, we were able to conclude that the Milky Way, the very centre of our own galaxy, is part of their nocturnal compass. Consider that a dung beetle hatches inside a cocoon of dung deep underground and spends most of its life grubbing around eating, moulding and transforming faeces beneath the earth; it is nothing short of inspiring to learn that the brilliant band of light that is the Milky Way is the beetle’s reference point when it plots a path through the African night. The dung beetle has a miniscule brain, much of it devoted to analysing smells, and yet it can process visual information that even humans with their vast brains struggle to comprehend. The contrast between the little insect and the immensity of its visual references reminds us in an oblique way of Hans Christian Andersen’s story about a dung beetle.\n\nx\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt’s a charming story about a rather arrogant little dung beetle who lives in an emperor’s stables. The emperor’s horse is honoured with golden shoes as a result of saving the emperor’s life in battle. Upon seeing his neighbour the horse shod with golden shoes, the dung beetle sticks out his skinny little legs and demands golden shoes. The farrier declares him out of his senses, to which the dung beetle replies that he is equally a resident of the royal stables and therefore as worthy as the emperor’s horse. The farrier absolutely refuses to provide the golden shoes and so the beetle quits the stables in high dudgeon. This triggers a series of adventures in which the dung beetle fails to find either his place in the world or his own satisfactory identity. He does not really learn humility but when he finally flies home to the emperor’s stables, landing exhausted on the back of the favoured horse, he reasons that the golden shoes on the horse were actually put there to honour him, the dung beetle. And so he is reconciled to his home. When we consider how vast our little planetarium dung beetle’s view of the galaxy is, it might feel that it well deserves those golden shoes after all. As a group of scientists working on the spectacular adaptations of everything from the neural pathways in dung beetles’ brains to their orientation and navigation abilities, we were contributing to an everincreasing body of knowledge on the complexity and variety found in this large family of very successful insects. When we published our Milky Way results, the story was picked up way beyond the scientific literature and spread rapidly around the world. We were struck by how the story of a lowly dung beetle and the immense Milky Way engaged popular imagination when so much other information about dung beetles is equally impressive, if not even more fascinating. This realisation prompted us to respond on behalf of these little creatures (which can be found on every continent except Antarctica) to show that they deserve better press than to be seen as mere dung-grubbers, some of whom happen to orientate by the stars.\n\nxi\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nDung beetles appear in early creation myths, and go on to take a central role amongst the Egyptians and their beliefs about life and death. Dung beetles’ fortunes have fallen and risen with the shift from a world dominated by a religion that symbolically incorporated them in some of its key concepts of rebirth, to a world in which science has largely separated itself from religion. The ascendancy of the dung beetle in our collective knowledge mirrors the development of science during the past five centuries: how it moved from being a quest by individuals trying to substantiate the biblical version of creation, to a pastime of well-heeled gentlemen in solitary pursuit of knowledge, to the dazzling but modest brilliance of Charles Darwin, and on to a collective of scientists engaging with increasing volumes of detailed data on animal and entomological development and behaviour. It is the very nature of these scientific practices that have changed the way we understand and view dung beetles in our world, and their value to us as an important source of information about the way the world works. It is that story, combined with their role in our most cherished beliefs, which turns these remarkable little dung consumers into creatures of immense interest. This book is the result first of musings, then of discussions between the two authors. We both realised that we could look at some of the history of the development of science in a microscopic way through a focus on dung beetles. They have been ever-present in the history of the West (but oddly, less so elsewhere), in religion, art, literature, science and the environment, and what we understand about them now mirrors our greater understanding of the important role they play in keeping our planet healthy. This is the story we explore in the following chapters. It is a story with a few unexpected twists, as it moves from the tombs of the pharaohs to the drawing rooms of the directors of the Dutch East India Company to the remote forests of Madagascar. It is a big story carried on the back of a family of small creatures who seldom diverge from their dogged pursuit of dung in its infinite variety and abundant xii\n\nIntroduction\n\nsupply. Like the housemaids of Victorian Britain, who tended fires and households in the small hours while the Empire swept across the globe, they remain largely unseen and ignored. Yet without them, the world would have a lot more dirt in it. Dung beetles are largely invisible, and yet without their vital activities the world would have a lot more faeces in it. One thing we find, looking back at the history of our understanding of dung beetles, is a progression in the way we as humans have viewed the world. We started with magical thinking about the world around us. From there, we moved into symbolic ways of explaining the world, and then rational thought (which has ebbed and flowed) came to dominate. That progression was neither linear nor sequential. We continue to retain magical thinking in the way we address the world around us, though overlaid by rational thought; symbols blending with reason. However, by exploring this one creature and its fortunes we can see how our ideas and practices surrounding our relationship to the world have changed. This is what we set out to do in the following chapters as we follow the fortunes of dung beetles in human history.\n\nxiii\n\nC H A P T E R ON E\n\nWhen the dung beetle wore golden shoes\n\nD e at h i s n o t a s u b j e c t one expects to find at the beginning of a book on dung beetles. The idea of someone’s great-great granny wandering around with dead dung beetles dangling from her ears is equally strange, but the two subjects are not unrelated. The Victorians in their grand obsession with Egypt, death and loss shared a number of ideas with the ancient Egyptians from whom they took the association of dung beetles with death. The difference in the case of the Victorians was that they had a monotheistic religious template for death, which differed from the Egyptians’ rich animist pantheon of gods. Moreover, instead of wearing scarabs made out of stone, the Victorians frequently wore the real thing. Quite how the hapless beetles found themselves adorning the earlobes of respectable ladies is part of a story that began seven thousand years ago in Egypt, and which came full circle with the nineteenth-century invasion of Egypt by Napoléon and the subsequent development of Egyptomania. It was the two subjects of death and resurrection that made dung beetles so significant in ancient Egypt. 1\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nAlthough the family of dung beetles comes in a huge array of sizes, bizarre shapes and iridescent colours (with some so small you can barely see them) it is the smaller subfamily of true dung beetles that earned these insects their central role in Egypt. What made them so important to the Egyptians was their intimate relationship with dung, which promoted them to godliness. This makes the idea of dainty/fastidious Victorian women boldly wearing such creatures as ornaments seem even odder. The Victorians, however, viewed dung beetles and nature in general as a window onto the mystery of creation and as a distraction from the ugliness of industrial society, so perhaps they did not consider the faecal associations of their entomological jewellery too closely. The same cannot be said for the ancient Egyptians, who were very aware of the dung-rolling proclivities of the beetles. It is this improbable and intriguing relationship between an insect known for its relationship to ‘filth’ and the beliefs of one of the most enduring civilisations known to humankind that is our point of departure. Why would a creature that subsists on the most unappealing end product of other living creatures be the one insect (as opposed to so many others) singled out for sacred recognition? And why primarily the ball-rolling species? On the other side of the world, the early culture of the Paraguayan Lengua-Maskoy people also gave ball-rolling dung beetles a mythological role. The dung balls seem to have been the clincher almost every time; this is not completely surprising, given that the balls of fresh faeces the beetles sculpt in full view are usually so beautifully spherical and (relative to the size of the beetle), evidence of remarkable strength. Although the handsome rollers are the most obvious component of the dung beetle fauna, only about ten per cent of tropical dung beetles actually roll balls, and that percentage declines as one moves towards the poles. The other species are either dung dwellers (like the beautiful Oniticellus formosus) or tunnellers (which are by far the largest contingent of the dung beetle fauna). Tunnellers commute between the dung/soil interface and their underground nest, 2\n\nW he n t he d u n g b ee t l e w o r e g o l d e n s h o e s\n\nso they are rarely seen unless one is prepared to poke through poo. It seems, however, that only a few species of rollers in the huge subfamily of over six thousand species lie at the core of the myths and beliefs that surround these beetles. It is their visible burying of the balls of dung in the earth (together with a seemingly miraculous reappearance from that same earth) that earned the beetles singular significance in certain early mythologies and belief systems. Dung beetles and their balls have made sufficient impression on humans to feature in creation myths on more than one continent. Among the Bushongo people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Africa, the scarab was seen as the original insect which created all other insects. This is an unusual variation on other creation myths, in which the scarab’s dung-rolling activities usually feature more prominently. In South America the Chaca Indians (who, along with the Lengua-Maskoy, lived in the area of present-day Columbia) gave their dung rollers a singularly important role. For them the dung beetle was the potter, a giant beetle known as Aksak, who created nothing less than man and woman.1 This creation myth is still present among Indian tribes resident in Bolivia’s Gran Chaco country, but has no resurrection counterpoint as found in Egyptian mythology. Instead, relatives generally destroy memories of their dead, who are believed to turn into animals – except for the shamans whose souls live among the stars of the Milky Way. For the Toba of Sumatra, the dung ball symbolised the ball of matter the scarab brought from the sky in order to form the world. Clearly it was the moulding of the dung ball that was symbolically important to the Chaca and the Toba. This gives us some understanding as to why that little ball has managed to carry so much significance. Dung is inescapably dung, however, and in other cultures it was not so much the ball as the beetle’s relationship to dung that was of importance. This earned dung beetles a place in a Chinese Taoist text, The Secret of the Golden Flower, which was based on ancient oral transmissions of an esoteric Chinese circle.2 In The Secret of the Golden Flower the dung beetle was a metaphor for the transformation central 3\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nto the Taoist concern with being at one with nature. This offered the means of transcending the self in order to be at one with the world. The dung ball, from which life would eventually develop, was an example of how the spirit might grow and transcend the environment in which an individual lived. This theme recurred in the writings of Christian theologians, albeit in the context of dung as a metaphor for sin. Unlike the Christian tradition, the Tao grew out of a form of animism, the beginning point for most spiritual expressions for early humankind. While dung beetles seem unlikely role players in our complex faiths and the history of human belief systems, they were far from alone in feeding the human imagination about answers to the origins of life and the hereafter. Natural resources (in particular certain mushrooms and other psychotropic plants) were responsible for visions of other worlds beyond the immediately visible one, and fed conceptions of realms that were somehow linked to the material world. Dung beetles entered these alternative worlds simply by rolling and burying balls of dung and thus unintentionally mimicking the daily death and rebirth of the sun, the first deity. The combination of invisible realms with the symbolism of an insect that seemed to replicate the motion of the earth is as intriguing as the raft of beliefs which followed. Both gave early humans visions and symbols, along with ways of translating the seeming chaos and uncertainty of life on the planet into digestible human interpretations and ways of thinking. The fungi and mind-altering plants consumed by the early shamanic mediums shifted their consciousness into shapes, forms and connections that defied words, but which were compelling enough that they were (and still are) believed to represent an unseen and significant reality. Meanwhile dung beetles, through their dung burial behaviour, became symbols of beliefs surrounding death and resurrection: the passage of day into night and back into day, from light into dark, and back into the light again. It was probably shamanic journeys into both the under- and overworld that fed the earliest myths of what we now call heaven and 4\n\nW he n t he d u n g b ee t l e w o r e g o l d e n s h o e s\n\nhell. The Mayan text, the Chilam Balam of Chumayel, is one of the few manuscripts to have survived the destructive judgement of Catholic monks in South America – they burned anything that they believed referenced pagan beliefs. This almost impenetrable text, which appears to be a mix of Christian cosmogony (theories about the beginnings of the universe) and traditional Mayan beliefs, might have escaped destruction for this very reason. In this work the scarab appears as the filth of the earth, in both a material and moral sense. As such, it represented something similar to early ideas of hell as a place and feeling of primal chaos, disorder, sickness and pain, in contrast to heaven as the realm of expansion, healing and release.3 In ancient times heaven was a world accessed either through rhythmic drumming and trance dancing, through psychoactive plants or through a combination of the two. Along with dreams, those experiences were the earliest happenings that created a sense of unseen worlds, equally numinous in their inclusion of the mystery of where people disappeared to after death. Although the dung beetle does not appear to have any place in modern mythological belief systems, the early pre-Egyptians saw them as a powerful symbol of resurrection and the creative power of the sun. It is via this route that their legacy was embedded in every major Western religion, from the time that humans first developed spiritual curiosity about where we came from, and to where we are going. The gradual desertification of the Sahara (which began to accelerate approximately 5300 BCE) motivated small groups of nomadic huntergatherers to cluster increasingly around the Nile River, where they began to farm its banks and to found one of the earliest and most enduring civilisations in human history. These nascent societies created an initial foundation for the multiplicity of gods that we now identify with early Egyptian civilisation. Death and order were central topics in these developing civilisations. In their late Neolithic burial sites at places such as Deir Tasa, there is evidence of a belief in an afterlife, with the dead being buried with bowls of food and other items thought essential to life in the hereafter. 5\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nThey also established an assemblage of gods and beings they had relied on in smaller tribal groupings. As animists they appear to have seen the cosmos as a ‘Grand Chinese Opera’, populated with a limitless cast of frogs and elephants, rivers and mountains and probably beetles.4 Over time the pantheon of Egyptian deities incorporated everything from crocodiles and bulls to dung beetles. Whatever early belief system one examines, it is not surprising that animals present in the local habitat were the ones invested with meaning and significant roles. The Japanese used the cicada as their symbol of resurrection in the hereafter. Life-giving animals such as the auroch (a forerunner of the cow which offered food, clothing and hides for warmth) were particularly significant in the cold climes of Europe. For the San people of Southern Africa the eland was an equivalent creature, a particularly powerful beast whose death opened up a space in which the living (through the intercession of a shaman) could connect with other realms and the spirit world. In Egypt, the mystical animal-deities were those still seen in tomb paintings and sculptures. They ranged from fierce or dangerous creatures such as lions, crocodiles and cobras to harmless birds and insects. Different groups revered different creatures, and the ruler of each district in pre-dynastic Egypt had his own god, which explains how a number of important deities (such as Horus, the falcon god) were introduced. The beginning of dynastic Egypt circa 3100 BCE saw the consolidation of regions under one overarching ruler, a Pharaoh (king) who, like the rulers in Egypt’s pre-history, identified with one or more animal gods. One of the defining differences between a Pharaoh and a shaman was that the latter was usually an otherwise unremarkable community member within a small social and kinship grouping, usually consisting of no more than 150 people. The shamans became priests and part of a formalised religious hierarchy, a radical contrast to the shamanic world of the egalitarian hunter-gatherer, in whose animist universe all creatures and things were able to address each other. The priest now 6\n\nW he n t he d u n g b ee t l e w o r e g o l d e n s h o e s\n\nbecame the intermediary to the gods, who were relied on to ensure rain and bountiful harvests. This meant the evolution of a powerful priesthood, in which the Pharaoh was the chief mediator with the gods, with the priests below them in the hierarchy. The role of the priests was to care for and mediate with the gods, who in turn would show their pleasure through the annual inundation of the Nile and plentiful harvests. Over time priests, priestesses and god wives (wives or consorts of the Pharaoh) became enormously wealthy and powerful. As they ostensibly communicated with the gods rather than the people, a language representing the gods in the form of symbols helped to cement the concept of different deities. Shared symbols with the same meaning for all were required for group cohesion, and represented a step away from the imagery and objects used in the earlier smaller groups. Dung beetles would have been well known around the rim of the Mediterranean, with the sacred scarab, Scarabaeus sacer, occurring in Southern Europe and North Africa; the term ‘scarab’ is used as a common name for dung beetles to this day. The sacred scarab eventually rose to such popularity in ancient Egypt that, 2 500 years after its zenith, both Pliny and Plutarch commented on the beetles’ surprisingly high status. The formalised appearance of symbolic scarabs as amulets in the early Egyptian Middle Kingdom from at least 3000 BCE suggests scarabs were already a well-established representation drawn from the natural world at the beginning of dynastic Egypt.5 Dung beetles were embodied in the god Khepri, a creature presented with a human body and a scarab head. His name is variously transliterated in English as Khepra, Khepera or Khepri meaning ‘itself is transforming.’ He was a magical creature, a perception reflected in the play on the name for dung beetle in Egyptian, ‘hprr’, which means ‘rising from, coming into being’ and which became ‘hpri’, the divine name Khepri: ‘It is said of Khepra, as of Horus, that [he] produced the Ma, that is the law or harmony which upholds the universe.’6 Khepri is a significant god 7\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nbecause he was associated with creation and becoming, whether in this world or the next. He was a special deity from the beginning of dynastic Egypt (circa 3100 BCE) and much of his fame was put down to his particular (but misinterpreted) breeding behaviour, in which it was assumed no females were involved. It has also been suggested that the jewel-like colours of many scarabs might have first attracted human attention (as many beautiful species still do) resulting in dresses for movie stars and grandiose ballroom ceilings being decorated by their metallic wing covers. (Prada handbags, designed by the mercurial Damien Hirst, continue this eccentric and impractical but nevertheless beautiful fashion on the runways of Europe). However, the sacred scarab (which is generally agreed upon as the model for Khepri) is not quite as colourful as some of its other scarab relatives, so brilliance is not a particularly compelling argument in this case. Its significance, since its first appearance as far back as the second prehistoric civilisation in the Nile region, derived from its ball rolling and breeding habits, and the interpretations of these behaviours. Dung beetles were placed in jars buried alongside the dead, indicating that their ability to disappear into the earth and then re-emerge was a magical attribute that could influence the fate of the corpse. Both dried beetles and models of beetles made out of green serpentine and cut sard were found in graves at Tarkhan. Scarabs and other beetles were considered sacred and magical from the earlier part of the second prehistoric age in Egypt right down to the Christian period.7 Khepri’s role in Egyptian belief systems increased in significance as the pantheon of gods and their roles evolved. A correlation between the number of gods and the increasing complexity of the newly settled society is apparent, but Khepri was included from the start; his fortunes and representation (although not static) remain in one form or another throughout the very long history of Egyptian culture. In Memphis, the ancient capital of Egypt, Khepri was associated with Ptah, who was originally the god of the earth from which it was 8\n\nW he n t he d u n g b ee t l e w o r e g o l d e n s h o e s\n\nbelieved humans were crafted. It was this association of creation and shaping forms from the raw material of the earth that linked him to Khepri, whose dung ball represented the daily passage of the sun and the coming into being of matter. Khepri also featured in one of the many Egyptian creation myths in which a lotus flower rises out of the waters. When its petals open, a scarab is revealed which transforms itself into a weeping boy; the boy’s tears become humankind.8 This potency was also associated with gods who represented the subjugation of chaotic natural forces, particularly with the dwarf figure of Pataikos, on whose head he is depicted. Khepri’s name was often included as one of the five great names of the King that reinforced the message of the King’s relationship to the gods. Science in early Egypt, a necessary outgrowth of agriculture, was an attempt to explain the way the world worked, and involved mathematics and geometry. These intellectual tools were used to lay out and record ownership of land, which frequently disappeared under the life-giving silt deposits that arrived with the annual flooding of the Nile River. The sciences were used to establish a calendar based on that critical event, which was vital to the local agricultural practices and ultimately to the survival of society. From this we can assume with some confidence that the Egyptians observed dung beetles pretty closely, something confirmed by the fact that they made a distinction between the scarab that went underground to breed (which was associated with Osiris, god of the dead) and the young scarab which emerged from the ground (associated with the son of Osiris, Horus the falcon god). They presumably noted the ravages of age on the parental beetle, with its cuticle dulled and front legs worn down from digging over three years of adult life. In contrast, the newly emerged adult would reflect a metallic sheen to match its pert spikey new legs as it broke free from its earthen chamber into the sun. Unfortunately, we have only this indirect evidence of early Egyptian naturalists excavating the ground where they might have seen a dung beetle disappear, but even if they followed him underground, 9\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nthey still subscribed to a magical and symbolic explanation for the significance of his re-emergence. To the Egyptians, Re (Ra) was the chief god while Horus was ‘the one far above’; so when a combination of Horus’s wings and tail with the newly emerged young Khepri began to appear inside the royal pyramids at the end of the fifth dynasty, this new representation cemented Khepri in his role as the symbol of resurrection. This was a key concept for the Egyptians, who believed that life did not end with death. Even though we do not know the exact origin of this belief, which was certainly not limited to the Egyptians, this does appear to be the first time we have actual documentation of it appearing in the records of a civilisation. It is a belief still widely held in the contemporary world, and represents a core concept in the development of religious perceptions around death. Although we find mention of Khepri in the Pyramid Texts, which are dated around 2350 BCE, he was at his peak of popularity during the period known as the New Kingdom (1550 BCE–712 BCE). This was characterised by five hundred years of exceptional prosperity, during which the pharaohs amassed huge wealth from the extension of Egyptian influence into the near Middle East and south into parts of Nubia (present-day Sudan). Much of this wealth was used to build elaborate temples and to construct statues dedicated to Egyptian gods. Nowhere was this more in evidence than at the temple complex at Karnak, which was constructed from around 2055 BCE, but which in the period of the New Kingdom became one of the most important temples in all of Egypt. Eighteenth dynasty rulers, in particular Thutmose III (1479 BCE–1425 BCE), began a series of ambitious embellishments to the temple complex, resulting in it becoming one of the largest religious sites ever constructed. Thutmose III’s reign is considered to be the greatest age of the scarab, when its use as a symbol was most common and most varied. In the Karnak temple compound a huge red granite statue of Khepri, dedicated by Amenhotep III (1386 BCE–1349 BCE), was moved at some point to the northern corner of a sacred lake. This position was imbued 10\n\nW he n t he d u n g b ee t l e w o r e g o l d e n s h o e s\n\nwith significance, as the human-made lake symbolised the primeval waters from which it was believed all life arose; Khepri crawling out of the life-giving mud after the Nile receded from the flood plains was associated with the coming into being and rebirth of life and the sun. The positioning of the Khepri statue at the northern side of the lake served as a symbolic representation of this relationship; ironically, the symbolism of this positioning was not significant enough to prevent the Egyptian Antiquities Authority from moving the statue from its initial position to ensure a better flow of tourists at the site. The statue rests on top of a cylindrical pedestal, the front of which has been flattened to form a stela (a carved or inscribed stone slab or pillar used for ceremonial purposes) on which is carved a kneeling king offering two vessels to Atum (the primordial god who arose from the sacred waters). The text on the pedestal reads ‘Khepri who rises from the earth’.9 Few things could express Khepri’s importance to ancient Egypt more visibly than this huge beetle statue. However, his journey from those lofty heights to the present is one that traces our changing understanding and perception of the world: his name now survives mainly as a classical reference in modern entomology, with Kheper referring to a group of over twenty (mainly Afro-tropical) dung beetle species of great beauty; such species in the sub-genus Kheper are the archetypal ball rollers and members of a larger grouping, the genus Scarabaeus, which includes the sacred scarab Scarabaeus sacer.10 Different species of scarab amulets were crafted during different dynasties, and the inscriptions on the undersides of these scarabs have helped us to reconstruct some of the history of ancient Egypt. In dynastic Egypt, for example, Khepri not only symbolised the belief that death was not the end of life, and that resurrection was real; he was also a metaphor for the passage of time and the movement of the sun through the course of the day. Everything about the life of the ball-rolling dung beetle was interpreted as portentous. It rolled the ball backwards – a peculiar way for any animal to move – creating a living image of reversible life. The scarab itself at times becomes the 11\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nsun, because it flies on hot clear days. Most importantly, the beetle created a circular ball that disappeared underground and from which a new dung beetle emerged. For the Egyptians, this internment of the dung ball was akin to the disappearance of the sun at night and its reappearance every morning. The dung ball thus became a symbol of the sun. It was believed that the setting of the sun represented the separation of the body and the soul of the sun, and that when the sun rose the following day, the two were reunited. To the Egyptians, who observed nature closely, this seeming capacity for self-regeneration was the transformative ability that promoted the dung beetle into a truly auspicious symbol. As a deity, however, Khepri represented more than a belief in resurrection. He was also identified as a primal source of creation. It was this that distinguished Khepri from other creatures also thought to be representative of the proof of resurrection. For the ancient Egyptians, anything that disappeared and then reappeared was included in the pantheon of creatures representing the concept of rebirth. Because they submerged themselves in water to resurface some time later, hippos were also associated with regeneration and rebirth, but the dung beetle and his ball spoke of life eternal while the hippo had a more ambivalent set of associations. Hippos were dangerous and associated with chaos, while female hippos were associated with mothers and childbirth in the shape of the goddess Taweret. The fearsomely mythical devourer of souls who failed the feather test at their judgement after death was Ammit, an amalgam of a crocodile, a lion and a hippo, all animals known to kill humans. The activities of dung beetles, however, always remained benign or beneficial. We can deduce from all of the above that dung beetles were closely studied, but we also know that their early observers suffered some confusion over what they were seeing. They believed that the male dung beetle was capable of parthenogenesis (that it had no need of a female to reproduce) and that this was an additional quality that made the dung beetle supernatural. The Egyptian assumptions about Khepri 12\n\nW he n t he d u n g b ee t l e w o r e g o l d e n s h o e s\n\ncan to some extent be explained by the fact that the sexes of ballrolling dung beetles are not that easy to distinguish, and that females of many insect species (including dung beetles) can store sperm between matings, precluding the need for the constant attentions of a mate. In addition, the dung ball rolled across the ground does not contain an egg: this is only added days later, after the female has reworked the ball underground, often on her own. If we consider that in Western science, the individual roles played by egg and sperm in the creation of a new individual were not finally settled until 1876, such shortcomings in Egyptian dung beetle biology shouldn’t be treated with too much scorn. They do, however, give us a clear marker of the limits of observation by the unaided eye – something which would define natural history for centuries. Based on their assumptions, the Egyptians concluded that there were no females in the entire scarab family. Inscribed on the stela of Hor and Suty, two overseers of works erected during the eighteenth dynasty, we find confirmation of this belief in the lines: Great Hawk, dapple plumed; Scarab who raised himself up; Who creates himself unbegotten.11 Less easily confirmed is Plutarch’s assertion that Egyptian warriors had a beetle carved on their signets as a symbol of masculine bravery as well as immortality, an assertion which appears to be myth transformed into fact. A more nuanced understanding of the role of males and females in ancient Egypt suggests that in some way Khepri, when seen in relation to Maat (the concept of balance), embodied the duality of male and female. Considering that he was a magical creature with mythical attributes, his ability to procreate in the absence of females was not all that implausible. Different periods and towns in Egypt had differing beliefs about the formation of the world, but Khepri was an enduringly popular god 13\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nwho managed to survive many changes in the expanding Egyptian world: bringing good fortune and (most importantly) ensuring the lifegiving and sustaining sun rose every day, just as a well-preserved body would eventually rise in the future. Various Pharaohs owned beautiful and valuable armbands and amulets representing Khepri. Less elevated individuals possessed simpler representations of him, but his presence was pervasive in both life and death, granting protection from evil in life and the promise of resurrection after death. The Egyptians had scarab amulets inscribed with everything from good wishes to deities’ names, and well-worn personal scarabs were usually found with the mummified remains of their owner. The Pharaoh Amenhotep III, who ruled from 1386 BCE–1349 BCE used such scarabs to reinforce proclamations about his own personal greatness and the extent of his power. Surviving scarabs from his period boast of his having killed 102 lions. Other scarabs promoted the name of his wife Tiy and his dominion over Lower and Upper Egypt, as well as his prowess in capturing wild cattle. Amenhotep apparently understood the value of self-promotion in public relations and the power of the symbolic, in which Khepri was a notable vehicle for transmitting his message. Yves Cambefort, a renowned French entomologist and dung beetle specialist, has conducted extensive research into the role of scarab beetles in early cultures. He suggests reasons for the elaborate and complex rituals surrounding Egyptian mummification can be found in the idea of regeneration via the dung beetles’ brood ball, its signature means of reproduction. Cambefort has proposed that the Pharaoh’s sarcophagi reference the pupal chamber into which a dung beetle larva eventually transforms its brood ball, a suitable environment for the possibility of rebirth of the body.12 According to his theory, the immobile pupa represented the mummified body. The Egyptians believed that a person’s body was necessary for resurrection, hence the need for it to be elaborately preserved (including the bandaging, which mimicked the segmentation of the inert beetle pupa). This 14\n\nW he n t he d u n g b ee t l e w o r e g o l d e n s h o e s\n\ninterpretation is based on the assumption that at some point, someone dug up a brood ball and investigated its contents, which is entirely possible. While we have no evidence other than conjecture for this, it is nevertheless a tempting conclusion. Egyptian mummification progressed over time, signifying the importance attached to the physical body of a person. Depending on the wealth of the individual who had died, mummification developed into a refined art ensuring that the deceased person would take their body, considered as a requisite for the next life, with them. As the art of mummification became more sophisticated, all the major organs were preserved and dedicated to the four sons of Horus: the liver was protected by Imsety, Hapy was associated with the lungs, Duamutef with the stomach, and Qebehsenuef with the intestines. The only organ not removed from the body was the heart, which was considered to be the seat of intelligence. Small scarabs were usually placed upon the eyes or the breast and sometimes over the stomach, a practice which varied according to the time period. The most important scarab, however, was the heart scarab of the mummy, which was much larger than the other scarabs and frequently made out of basalt or green stone. This was a form of insurance to protect the deceased at the decisive time when their heart would be weighed against a feather by the funerary jackal god Anubis before a panel of 42 judging deities at the threshold of the afterlife. Judgement of the goodness of their heart was critical to their chance of resurrection. The underside of the amulet was usually inscribed with a prayer, beseeching the heart not to bear witness against its owner in the final judgement. Cambefort has extended his theory about mummification and dung beetles further by suggesting that the interiors of some of the remarkable pyramids built to house the Pharaohs bear a curious similarity to the chambers and tunnels created by dung beetles underground; this again suggests that the Egyptians might well have done some digging to find out where dung beetles went underground. The structure of some pyramid interiors resembles the steep narrow 15\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\npassageway down to the beetle’s brood chamber, which houses the brood ball in which the dung beetle larva grows. Intermediate compartments (used for temporary dung storage), turns and blindended passages between the surface and the final chamber add to this similarity. Cambefort suggests that encasing the body in a ‘brood ball’ inside an elaborate and impressive structure that closely mirrored the underground home of Khepri ensured resurrection of the pharaoh: doubly important because pharaohs were considered to be gods who, once they died, would be reunited with Osiris, the god of the afterlife, life, death, resurrection and transformation. These theories are not improbable, but they do raise some questions; if these funerary practices and monuments were based on the model of the dung beetles’ underground life, why did the Egyptians build some pyramids above ground rather than underground? And why do we find pyramids in other cultures where dung beetles were not gods? Cambefort’s ideas are intriguing, if speculative, but one answer to the above-ground building of pyramids lies in the belief of the ancient Egyptians that the continuation of the life of a person after their death was connected to people remembering him or her. A solitary soul was undoubtedly dead, while a person with many people in their life was alive. One of the virtues of a vast pyramid was that it kept the dead pharaoh alive in people’s memory; and as long as they remembered him, he lived on. Hieroglyphics (mdw netjer in ancient Egyptian, translated as ‘the words of God’) were an important part of the representation of the Egyptian world view. The text of Horapollo Niliacus, written in the fourth century CE, provided an early explanation of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Although the authenticity or accuracy of much of what Horapollo wrote is disputed, the work is generally accepted as being written by someone who lived when hieroglyphic signs were still in use. Horapollo wrote that the Egyptians believed that the dung ball was also a symbol of the world, which in turn suggests that they were aware that the earth was round and not flat. They observed and recorded a great deal about their world: they knew that a month was 16\n\nW he n t he d u n g b ee t l e w o r e g o l d e n s h o e s\n\non average 30 days long, and they overlaid this knowledge with that of the brood cycle of the dung ball, since it took 28 days for a new beetle to emerge from a ball of dung (though in reality this would vary with the temperature and rainfall of the region and the species of beetle involved).13 They believed that this timing corresponded with the passage of the earth through each of the twelve signs of the zodiac. When the dung beetle emerged from the brood ball on the 29th day, they believed that this coincided with the initiation of a new regenerative cycle of the earth. Examining the world of the Egyptians reveals a search for order and attempts to make sense of their world. They looked closely at the night sky and the passage of the planets, and saw patterns, along with answers found in those patterns. They developed sophisticated ways of observing the stars and planets, and many of their observations persist in modern astrology. The heavenly Egyptian scarab remains in the modern zodiac as Cancer, metamorphosed by the Greeks and Romans into the crab. The symbolic presence of the persistent scarab in the stars adds romance to the finding that at least one species of nocturnal ball-rolling dung beetle can use the Milky Way to orientate its ball-rolling. To paraphrase Sir David Attenborough, had the ancient Egyptians known that the lowly scarab beetle could use the centre of our galaxy for orientation, they would surely have felt vindicated in elevating it to the status of a god? Horapollo tells us that Egyptian observers noted how the dung beetle pushed its ball with its hind legs, head down, going backwards ‘rolling its ball to the West, while himself looking towards the East’14. This is possibly one of the earliest written records of animal behaviour, linking the beetle’s rolling direction to the position of the sun. It wasn’t until the work of Ulisse Aldrovandi, a remarkable Italian naturalist intimately acquainted with Egypt’s most recondite mythology, was published in 1602 that the mystery of dung beetle reproduction was finally unravelled. It took almost another four hundred years to explain the influence of the sun on the orientation behaviour of dung beetles, 17\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nand we now know that the sun is but one celestial cue (but nevertheless the primary one) used by dung beetles to plot a path for their dung ball through unknown terrain to a burial spot. The Egyptian commentary would have required a close study of their own dung beetle fauna, but we have no record of who made the original observations of the beetles, nor how they came to their conclusions – which were largely correct concerning the influence of the sun in the orientation behaviour of dung beetles. However, Egyptian interest in dung beetles was never really a pragmatic one. Although the dung beetle was connected to the life-giving period after inundation by the Nile (when the beetles would reappear as harbingers of growth), over a period of more than three thousand years the dung beetle left the realm of the mundane and became firmly entrenched as a symbol of Egyptian optimism in the capacity of humans to transform and regenerate themselves. The Egyptians’ belief in life after death was shared by the early Christians in the same way that Egyptian practices and beliefs have left their traces in many other contemporary religions. The practise of circumcision was an Egyptian custom which appears to have been adopted by Judaism, as was the eschewing of pork in any form. However the centrality of resurrection in the Christian religion is of particular significance, as it lies at the heart of the ethical and moral foundation of that church. The notion of Jesus Christ dying for humanity’s sins and being resurrected from his grave after three days in the tomb is absolutely central to the Christian narrative. We have no way of proving exactly how core spiritual concepts moved between groups of early modern people, and there is always the danger of claiming that if one society had an idea, other cultures that share a similar idea must have copied it. Similar ideas can arise repeatedly and independently, with monotheisms appearing in human cultures which we know to have been separated by major oceans for most of their history. It remains noteworthy, nevertheless, that the key notions of burial and rebirth are so similar in Christianity and Egyptian mythology. The fact that Khepri as a symbol did travel 18\n\nW he n t he d u n g b ee t l e w o r e g o l d e n s h o e s\n\noutside of the borders of Egypt supports the theory that some aspects of his symbolism might well have influenced other cultures. We find Khepri in the discovery of scarab amulets in the Middle East and in countries around the Mediterranean basin, most of which traded with Egypt: Sardinia and Crete have ample evidence of this traffic. The Phoenicians borrowed the scarab from Egypt, and after they were overrun by Shalmaneser III, King of Assyria (860–825 BCE), scarabs found their way to Nineveh and Babylon. Scarabs have also been found in the graves of the Philistines in present-day Israel.15 We cannot assume that the spread of the scarab as symbol would have conveyed the exact beliefs it represented for Egyptians. Yet it is unlikely that it would have travelled as far and wide as it did if some vestige of its reputed symbolic power had not accompanied it. At an archaeological site in Mesopotamia in present-day Syria, scarabs were found at the temple of Ninkarrak, the Mesopotamian goddess of wellbeing and healing. The scarabs found there were not made in Egypt, but were of Levantine origin; and similar scarabs of non-Egyptian origin have been found at the sites of Sidon, Byblos, Ugant in the northern Levant, and Tell al Ayjul in the Southern Levant. These scarabs were used as amulets and were symbols of good fortune, happiness and beauty.16 Their presence in graves in particular suggests that some of their original meaning and value might well have been retained and, like other myths, found their way into new and different mythologies about the origin of human beings and the world. Christianity’s formal establishment of monotheism as central to its doctrine meant that all the other gods, particularly those drawn from the realm of insects and other animals, had to be dismissed. Once Christianity took a proper hold around the Mediterranean in the latter days of the Roman Empire, Khepri the dung beetle god had to be erased and forgotten along with all other gods. The influence of Egyptian thought, however, remained. In the pre-Christian era, the Greeks had already added another level to the spiritual journey after death. In their writings, the soul not only could live on after death, but could return to earth reincarnated 19\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nin another form, a subtle variation on the concept of resurrection. The Greek historian Herodotus (circa 484 BCE–425/413 BCE) states that several Greek authorities adopted a doctrine of transmigration of the soul based on the Egyptian beliefs, and used it as their own. The Greeks had different symbolic uses for the dung beetle, and in Aesop’s Fables (which date from approximately 500 BCE), a dung beetle appears as an earthy and dirty creature that can nevertheless fly to the chief god Zeus. The story in Aesop’s Fables indicates that the dung beetle was independently noticed by the Greeks, and was not influenced by the concept of Khepri. In the fable, an eagle hounds a hare, who begs the dung beetle to protect him. The dung beetle implores the eagle to leave the hare alone. He warns the bird not to ignore his pleas, his small size notwithstanding, and in the name of Zeus to abandon his pursuit of the hare. The eagle takes no notice and proceeds to tear the hare apart. The dung beetle is so incensed that he rushes off and destroys the eagle’s eggs. Not content with one year’s revenge, he proceeds to do the same the following year. The eagle, desperate to protect his future brood, takes the next lot of eggs to Zeus and places them in the god’s lap, trusting that they will be protected there. The indomitable little beetle simply fills itself with dung and flies straight into the face of Zeus, who, startled by the filthy creature, leaps up, dropping and breaking the eagle’s eggs. The beetle then relates to Zeus the wrong the eagle did, both to him and to the name of Zeus. The god tries to persuade the dung beetle to relent, but the persistent little insect is not prepared to do so. Zeus, who does not want the race of eagles to expire, arranges instead that the eagle will lay its eggs at a time of the year when the dung beetle is not active. This story is difficult to verify in modern scientific terms, as the species concerned are unknown. However, most dung beetles have a well-defined period of above-ground activity, linked to rainfall and rising temperatures, which would be around the end of winter in the Mediterranean. This may well not overlap with the breeding times of local raptors in the region. 20\n\nW he n t he d u n g b ee t l e w o r e g o l d e n s h o e s\n\nAnother Greek writer, Aristophanes (circa 446 BCE–386 BCE), would later incorporate these details into his play Peace (written in 421 BCE). This play imaginatively combines a mythical past, history and bawdy humour. The story concerns a shortage of food in Athens and how one father, Trygaeus, proposes to solve the problem by flying to the gods on a dung beetle to ask for bread. His young daughter is incredulous, but he points out that everyone knows from Aesop’s tale that dung beetles alone can fly to the abode of the gods. To which she replies: Little Daughter Father, father, that’s a tale nobody can believe! That such a smelly creature can have gone to the gods. Trygaeus It went to have vengeance on the eagle and break its eggs. Little Daughter Why not saddle Pegasus? You would have a more tragic appearance in the eyes of the gods. Trygaeus Eh! Don’t you see, little fool, that then twice the food would be wanted? Whereas my beetle devours again as filth what I have eaten myself. Little Daughter And if it fell into the watery depths of the sea, could it escape with its wings? Trygaeus Exposing himself. I am fitted with a rudder in case of need and my Naxos beetle will serve me as a boat. 21\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nLittle Daughter And what harbour will you put in at? Trygaeus Why, is there not the harbour of Cantharus at the Piraeus? Little Daughter Take care not to knock against anything and so fall off into space; once a cripple, you would be a fit subject for Euripides, who would put you into a tragedy. Trygaeus As the Machine hoists him higher. I’ll see to it. Good-bye! To the Athenians. You, for love of whom I brave these dangers, do ye neither fart nor crap for the space of three days, for, if, while cleaving the air, my steed should scent anything, he would fling me head foremost from the summit of my hopes.17 It is highly unlikely that the fables of Aesop or the comedies of Aristophanes were a consideration among the early Christian teachers who, emanating from the school of Alexandria in Egypt, were assembling the critical texts of Christianity. Khepri disappears as a symbol, but the dung beetle persists, albeit in less elevated roles. Its descent in some cultures is rapid. In Neo-Platonism, the dung beetle is stripped of all magic and reduced to the lowest of the low. Porphyry, a Syrian philosopher (234 CE–305 CE) demonstrated this attitude in his argument that everything in nature had a purpose, other than the following hideous and repellent creatures: flies, mosquitoes, bats, dung beetles, scorpions and vipers. It was inevitable that as the world became metaphorically flat, the dung beetle (the symbol of resurrection and a sun god) would crash rather ignominiously.\n\n22\n\nW he n t he d u n g b ee t l e w o r e g o l d e n s h o e s\n\nThe dung beetle was now ignored in a world in which, as the Bible proclaimed, humans had dominion over the earth and all its creatures, which in turn became subject to and lesser than humankind. This seems a minor point, as does the dropping of the dung beetle from its symbolic role in ancient Egypt, but it is not. The centuries that followed, in which humans separated their existence into a hierarchy of creation of which they were the apex, were critical to forming subsequent views of the world. The questioning behaviour and philosophies of the Greek thinkers and the school of Alexandria, which had flourished more or less simultaneously, had become dangerous because of their potential for heresy, and were suppressed. The nature and purpose of ‘Man’ was defined and narrow, and no questioning of why or how we came to be on earth (along with everything else in the natural world) was encouraged. According to the church patriarchs, the Bible provided all the answers and no further enquiry was necessary. Yet, as we shall see in the next chapter, the dung beetle appears in the writing of some of those church fathers in the context of its relationship to dung. Its days as a powerful and independent god, however, were completely forgotten. Dung beetles must have thrived on the Christian rejection of the cult of the body, as practiced by the Greeks and Romans with their baths and obsession with the human form. Poverty and a lack of interest in the beauty and cleanliness of the body showed one’s commitment to the Christian god, and encouraged turning away from concerns of the physical world to a focus on the spiritual. One inevitable outcome was that dirt and disease grew and prospered, and the not very clean world that ensued was a good one for dung beetles, and one in which to some degree they helped to keep humanity relatively healthy through disposal of faeces. We can find evidence of an awareness of this vital role of dung beetles in language, such as the old Anglo-Saxon word for dung beetle: ‘tordwifel’, or turd weevil, a creature at a long remove from its role as a deity.\n\n23\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nWith the growth of the priesthood and the Christian church in the West, centred in Rome, knowledge that threatened these power structures was often classed as dangerous and heresy. The majority of congregants lived in ignorance and were unable to read or write; this suited Rome, preoccupied as it was with power struggles and battles with kings and the aristocracy as it expanded its empire in the form of ‘holy wars’ and Crusades (in which the promise of god-sanctioned plunder proved most attractive). The truly great monuments to the long centuries of the Middle Ages are the awe-inspiring cathedrals of Europe, which reinforce the focus of the period on a trust in and reverence for the Christian god. The soaring spires of those cathedrals advertised their connection to God in his heaven, but ironically it was the celestial explorations of astronomers such as Galileo and Copernicus that gradually nudged the earth from the centre of the universe, to a quiet suburb of the Milky Way – our ordinary galaxy, one of billions. It seems fitting that nocturnal dung beetles have been looking at the Milky Way for millions of years, understanding its significance as a guide to path finding. It was dissension within the ranks of the Christian church about the accuracy of the scriptures that, when compared to new discoveries in astronomy and anatomy, marked the beginning of the Enlightenment. The advent of the Gutenberg press and the translation of the Bible into the vernacular liberated the Bible from the control of the Church. At the core of the Protestant Reformation was a desire for ordinary people to communicate with God through Jesus, not via a priest’s paraphrased Latin scripture. King Henry VIII, in his quarrels and ultimate breach with Rome, ordered a copy of the Coverdale Bible (a precursor of the King James translation into English) to be chained to the pulpit in every church in England. If the parishioners were unable to read it, they now had an incentive to learn.18 This growing access to increasing information and knowledge began to change the world, and ultimately ended the subjugation of humanity to the belief that the Bible was the only source of all the knowledge required to live on earth. 24\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nCrawling out of the darkness\n\nT h e f o r t u n e s o f d u n g b e e t l e s in the Middle Ages are relatively muted, and their main use appears to have been in remedies used by peasants. It was at the intersection of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance that the beetles began to reappear in the work of naturalists interrogating the heady mix of religion, alchemical pursuits and traditional knowledge of the previous thousand years. This small band of individuals frequently oscillated between alchemy and observationbased knowledge – hardly exceptional, given that there never is a clear break between historical periods. The word alchemy itself was derived from the Arab word ‘alchimia’ and referred to magical and mystical traditions combined with investigation into the nature of the physical world; it encompassed the very fluid boundaries between those activities. Despite official injunctions against magic, magical formulas were as prevalent in medicine as they were in alchemical formulas for transmuting base metals into gold.1 Such formulas appear in the materia medica (collections of information about the therapeutic properties of anything used for healing) of the Middle Ages, scattered among the more prosaic use of flora and, to a lesser extent, fauna. The actual 25\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nrecording of the use of animals and insects in the West can be traced back to Xenocrates of Aphrodisias, a first-century Greek whose work is only indirectly known via the writings of Galen (circa 130–210). Xenocrates’s influence spread to the Arab world, and it is in the Syriac Book of Medicines that we find a very medieval fate for black scarabs – they were boiled in olive oil to cure earache. Dung itself (without any attendant beetles) featured far more widely in medical concoctions in the Middle Ages, often in the form of bizarre mixtures which worked best (if at all) as placebos. In China, dung beetles appear in early materia medica, and are still used today by practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. These traditions began in rural areas, where peasants used whatever materials were at hand to effect cures. Some of these proved efficacious, and were recorded. Contemporary research in entomotherapy and compounds shows that different Chinese scarabs and their larvae have potentially useful antioxidant, antifungal, anti-viral and even anti-cancer properties, which probably explains why their use has continued for so long. The Middle Ages marked a time when scientific development in the East outstripped that of the West; however, apart from a remedial role, dung beetles do not appear to have contributed to the impressive achievements of Eastern scholars. Then came the period known as the Renaissance in the West (from about 1350 to 1600), which coincided roughly with the slowing down of the Chinese and Arabic paths of discovery and experimentation. It was during this exciting historical period that the humble dung beetle became detached from its role in religious mythology and folk medicine. It continued to appear in unexpected places though, not the least of which were the musings of deeply religious but conflicted thinkers who saw the beetles as metaphors for both sin and the common human being. The beetles also crept around the globe (literally) in association with the new voyages of exploration as they unwittingly hitched rides in ships’ ballasts. 26\n\nC r aw l i n g o u t o f t he da r k n e s s\n\nThe dung beetles travelling the world as unwitting colonists were to help reshape the physical world as much as the early explorers circumnavigating the globe. Driven largely by visions of glory, greed and the soon-to-be abandoned belief that their journeys might lead to the location of the original Garden of Eden, the early explorers carried their Christian concepts of the world with them. When Columbus landed in the Americas in 1492, he believed that he had found the Garden of Eden, but the discovery that most of the New World’s plants and creatures were not recorded as having been on board the Ark created great confusion. The number of new foods that were different from those in the Old World was extensive, and raised the question of the possibility of a creation different from the one mentioned in the Bible. Moreover, there was neither wine nor wheat for the celebration of Mass in the New World. The Portuguese were to continue the search for the Garden of Eden in South America, but the ultimate realisation that there was no physical Garden of Eden had a profound effect. The imagined world that had sustained both belief and social structures for centuries was starting to crack, and the light of evidence-based observation began to filter through those cracks. The revelation that revered thinkers such as Aristotle (circa 384 BCE–322 BCE) had been incorrect in their beliefs (making the claim, for example, that the equatorial region was too hot for life) opened up the possibility that if authorities such as Aristotle were wrong on certain subjects, they might have erred on many other fundamental ideas and beliefs. Aristotle’s description of dung beetles, when contrasted with some of his other biological observations, illustrates the contradictions presented by his work. He had described the dung beetle as a creature that ‘rolls dung into a ball, lies hid in it during the winter, produces small larvae in it, and out of these come more dung beetles.’2 On the one hand, this vaguely correct observation provides an indication that even in such an early period, evidencebased naturalism had a home in the classical world; but it highlights the inaccuracy of some of his other statements, which included the 27\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nnonsensical claim that insects were devoid of internal organs. He likewise claimed that men had more teeth than women, and that flies had four legs. The fly error might have come from a misinterpretation of Aristotle’s description of a particular mayfly that uses its front legs like antennae; and miscounting teeth might have occurred in a society where people lost teeth easily. Once received wisdom could be disproved by evidence, however, the way opened up for new challenges and methods of examination and discovery. Nevertheless, these new ways were always going to have to contend with the Bible and its authority, and traversing the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries provides abundant evidence of this tension. The question of humanity’s relationship to God and the world was a central question in early Christian writings. It is in there that we find the earliest tradition of dung beetles as metaphors for sin, human weakness and – most surprising of all – Jesus. The Physiologus, a didactic Christian text written in Alexandria by an unknown author in the second century, described dung beetles as symbols of heresy and their dung balls as evil thoughts. They were rather more kindly depicted in the metaphors of St Augustine (354– 430), the Tunisian theologian. Augustine, who was (and remains) one of the most influential early Christian authors, referred to Jesus as his Scarabaeus sacer, his ‘own good beetle’, because he had not only taken on human form, but had been born out of the same filth as humans. This likening of human weakness to the dung of dung beetles proved to be very tenacious. St Augustine’s ‘good scarab’ is intriguing because as a North African, it was very likely that he had come across Khepri in his home country of Tunis (now part of Algeria) or possibly Carthage, where he studied. He would also have encountered large ball-rolling beetles in the genus Scarabaeus or subgenus Kheper. Augustine’s knowledge of Khepri seems even more likely because he repeats the concept of dung-beetle parthenogenesis, a core feature of Khepri. Unlike the Egyptians, however, he did not see the dung ball as a symbol of the 28\n\nC r aw l i n g o u t o f t he da r k n e s s\n\nsun, but rather as a symbol of moral turpitude. It is easy to assume that St Augustine derived this metaphor from his knowledge of Khepri, but this is not necessarily the case. St Augustine found his true calling in the Catholic Church only when he travelled to Italy. It was there that he encountered the famous cleric St Ambrose of Milan (340–397), who was to influence him profoundly. St Ambrose also used the concept of ‘the good Scarabaeus’ numerous times, describing God as ‘The good Scarabaeus who rolled up before him the hitherto unshapen mud of our bodies.’3 The mystery surrounding this concept lies in the fact that St Ambrose never travelled to Africa, and that it was Augustine who was influenced by him, not the other way round; how then did the concept of the good Scarabaeus enter into a Milanese bishop’s thinking? These early Catholic theologians were preoccupied with establishing the Church, and would no doubt have been horrified had they known that their Scarabaeus would one day be used by a fifteenth-century theologian to criticise the very structure their writings had helped to cement. Erasmus of Rotterdam (1469–1536), justifiably known as one of the great humanists of the Northern Renaissance, used scarabs in his Adagia (published in 1500) to criticise the abuse of power by the Catholic clergy. In this annotated collection of more than 4 000 Greek and Latin proverbs, the dung beetle first appeared as the champion of the weak, while the eagle hunting him represented the tyrant – the clergy. It was a dangerous reference to make at a time when state and religion were in conflict, and in later editions of Erasmus’s Adagia the tale became more general and the dung beetle disappeared. Yet Erasmus liked the metaphorical value of dung beetles, and continued to use them in his writing. Fifteen years after the publication of the Adagia, Erasmus transformed the dung beetle from a symbol of the common people to that of a creature little different and yet cleaner than a sinner. In his De Immensa Dei Misericordia, he wrote ‘What is more vile than the dung beetle? Yet the dung beetle is clean compared to a sinner 29\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nin his squalor.’4 Erasmus was not done with the useful dung beetle, whose little hole or burrow he used to frame a question about God’s omnipotence. None other than the Protestant reformer Martin Luther (1483–1546) responded to Erasmus’s question about whether God was present in the dung beetle’s hole, arguing that God was indeed everywhere because he had created everything. The religious disputes of the time were subtle, but ultimately were always aimed at understanding our role on this earth, and the value of life. The implicit assumption was that we were here thanks to a beneficent deity, and that alone was the key to the universe; all enquiry into the nature of the world was aimed, at least originally, at furthering an understanding of that relationship. It was a slow and sweepingly different set of approaches, framed by a need to prove on the one hand God’s presence in everything; and on the other to perform a stocktake of everything that was known up until the 1500s which would ultimately refine and transform empirical methods of enquiry. One of the notable exemplars of this enterprise was the Italian scholar Ulisse Aldrovandi (circa 1522–1605). In addition to being Professor of Natural History at Bologna University, he was also the Chair of Philosophy and Logic. Aldrovandi was determined to investigate what he called the secrets of nature as a means to better comprehending the workings of God. What made Aldrovandi a man way ahead of his time was his practice of conducting extensive fieldwork and engaging with locals to collect specimens, rather than relying solely on the received texts of antiquity. He was interested in the vernacular names of creatures brought to him, their habits and where they had been found. In addition, on his field excursions he took with him skilled draughtsmen – Lorenzo Bernini of Florence and Cornelius Swint of Frankfurt – to record whatever they found, and employed a secretary to take notes. While modern academics seldom have the luxury of secretaries in the field, they do rely on primary observation as a valuable source of empirical data. Aldrovandi was a pathfinder in this regard, practising both comparison and detailed 30\n\nC r aw l i n g o u t o f t he da r k n e s s\n\nobservation. He taught his students to open up eggs to observe and understand what was happening inside them – the beginning of a new tradition of observation not limited by received knowledge as the boundary to enquiry. Although most famous for his ornithology, dung beetles came into Aldrovandi’s work in his 1602 fourth volume on the natural history of insects. He wrote that he found the study of insects the most difficult of all because of their size, and suggested that they should rather be called atoms. He speculated that it was because insects were so small that (as far as he knew) no one had published anything on them worthy of notice. Aldrovandi’s De animalibus insectis libri septem, cum singulorum iconibus ad viuum expressis (1602) provides further insights into his curious mix of modern observational science and traditional received wisdom. As a contemporary reader, it is often difficult to detect whether he is being critical of his predecessors, or is seeking credibility by quoting them; for example, he lists the various things that can give rise to dung beetles: the rotting flesh of horses (Isidorus), dead bullocks or asses (Virgil). Although it is not common, some dung beetles (such as species of Scarabaeolus) do use carrion as food instead of dung, while others vacillate between dung and flesh in their choice of filth in which to frolic. Even though Pliny the Elder (circa 23–79) correctly described the backwards progress of the ball-rolling beetle, Aldrovandi scolds him for not having ‘accurate knowledge of Scarabaeus pilularius’. He proposes the common name Scarabaeus for dung beetles and promotes them as being ‘… splendid and distinguished. Even though they delight themselves in faeces they should not be an object of reproach, for even the alchemists use dung in their attempts to extract the fifth essence’5 (part of the philosopher’s stone)6. In colour, strength and in heroism, he ranks them above eagles. In advocating for standardisation of common names for beetles and giving a clear description of S. pilularius, Aldrovandi might just take the honours from Linnaeus as the first scientific author (the 31\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nperson who first publishes the name of a new species) of a dung beetle species. This will remain debatable because Linnaeus developed the system which he himself used formally to describe all of the world’s biota, including dung beetles. This makes it chronologically difficult to pre-empt him. Nevertheless, the laurels for being the first to describe the nesting behaviour of dung beetles must go to our Italian ‘father of natural history’, as Linnaeus later described Aldrovandi. Preceding the French entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre by 300 years, Aldrovandi described and illustrated what is clearly the subterranean nest of a dung beetle, which he must have excavated in order to record what he found. His book is not only remarkable for its time in its attention to factual details along with accompanying illustrations, but also for its stocktaking of all that was known about insects at that point. What hampered Aldrovandi was the lack of a framework within which to interpret his findings. His life’s goal became to publish everything he could find on the known fauna of the world. The enterprise resulted in vastly expensive publications which few could afford, and cost him dearly. As an early collector of anything and everything, he displayed his acquisitions in a huge cabinet of curiosities, but the lack of a template other than a reference to Plato’s four divisions of animals (to which he himself did not strictly adhere) meant that Aldrovandi’s work teetered on a scale that oscillated uncomfortably between the past at one end and a distant future at the other, neither of which were available to him in a useful way. Despite the upheavals of the century, Europe was criss-crossed by a variety of efficient postal services. Through this informal network, European scholars were able to share their ideas exhaustively; Erasmus complained that he had to write more than ten letters a day. As part of this ‘republic of letters’, Aldrovandi was in touch with another leading scholar in natural history who lived in Switzerland, Conrad Gesner (1516–1565). Like his correspondent Aldrovandi, Conrad Gesner was attempting to gather all the known records of 32\n\nC r aw l i n g o u t o f t he da r k n e s s\n\nthe world’s flora and fauna into a series of books. Together these two encyclopaedists represent early examples of a foundational aspect of research: gathering all previous known work in a particular field of enquiry as a starting point for further research. Gesner gathered as many accounts of animals as he could find (as well as drawings from different sources) which he then recorded and attributed. While his work included mythical animals, its real significance was the systematic recording, ordering and annotation of information from diverse sources. Although in his descriptions of plants he used the taxonomic categories of species, genus, order and class that we recognise today, Gesner didn’t progress beyond Aristotle in his perceptions of the patterns of biological order. Like his contemporary Aldrovandi, Gesner was however laying a foundation for the later empirical tradition; however, without a template or broad interpretation of the huge subject matter he was dealing with, his work was primarily a record rather than a reframing of information. Even his tentative understanding of the concepts of genus and species was not pushed to its logical conclusion and the fame of providing a framework to understand nature passed this remarkable man by. Aldrovandi’s studies found their way into a work Gesner began but did not complete, and which was to become a scientific game of pass-the-parcel in its path to eventual publication. Gesner had begun writing a book on insects but had not completed it at the time of his death during the plague in 1565. The manuscript was then sold to the theologian and physician Thomas Penny (circa 1530–1589) who had visited Gesner. Penny proceeded to combine it with notes and observations of the Oxford physician, Edward Wotton (1492–1555), but the book remained unpublished. After Penny’s death the manuscript passed on to his neighbour and friend, Thomas Moffet (1553–1604), who completed the work and even commissioned its title page. The manuscript nevertheless did not see the light of day until 30 years after Moffet’s death when Sir Théodore Mayerne (1573–1655), 33\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\na successful physician, finally published the book Insectorum sive Minimorum Animalium Theatrum, also known as The Theatre of Insects, in 1634. Moffet’s title page displays a handsome ball-rolling dung beetle. The inspiration for this illustration is one of conjecture, as there are no ball rollers in England’s limited dung beetle fauna. Moffet had travelled to both Italy and Switzerland, but he was not the artist. It is likely that some of the illustrations and information used in the Insectorum were based on the work of Aldrovandi’s draughtsmen, in an era when it was common practice for art to be transferred and copied repeatedly, particularly when woodcuts were used as they were in The Theatre of Insects. Moffet’s book is regarded as the first English-language book on insects, but it owes its existence largely to the tradition already established by Aldrovandi and Gesner. It represents a very distinctive strand in the early practice of natural science, one that was not that successful in countering a less empirical approach. It is clear that the author understood that dung beetles were revered by the Egyptians and it repeated the Egyptian belief that there were no female dung beetles. It is an intriguing muddle of empirical observation, speculation and traditional wisdom. On the one hand, it speculates that farmers might well have learnt to compost their fields based on their observations of the effect of dung beetles distributing their balls of dung; on the other it notes that Saturn is the dunghill god and offers the not uncommon moralistic comparison between humans and dung beetles, that it is the dung beetle which stays relatively clean and neat in dung, whereas humans are polluted and infected with flaws. Although observationbased knowledge was becoming more systematic, the persistence of magical and mystical beliefs in publications such as The Theatre of Insects points to the continued conflation of the empirical and the magical. It was a road that was to survive well into the next century, and one which even Isaac Newton (1643–1727), often described as the first of the modern scientists, was to travel throughout his life. Newton 34\n\nC r aw l i n g o u t o f t he da r k n e s s\n\nwrote more about alchemy and magic than he did about physics. John Maynard Keynes described Newton as ‘the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians … the last wonder child to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage’.7 So it is not surprising that Aldrovandi and Gesner included mythical creatures in their encyclopaedic works, which they wished to be as comprehensive as possible. Nevertheless, most of what they reported was rooted in the observable and the recorded. It was not based on alchemical practises and beliefs that pervaded much of the emergent scientific thinking of the time. This seam of thought owed as much to the rediscovery of ancient writers during the Renaissance, which had included the emergence of old hermetic texts, as it did to the centuries of alchemical and magical ideas that preceded it. Unsurprisingly, Khepri reappeared somewhat divested of his former splendour in these arcane records. Hermeticism is based upon the writings of the ancient (probably mythical) prophet Hermes Trismegistus (who is credited with being a contemporary of Moses). These were mystical texts that pursued fundamental questions about the ingredients of life, described as the original truth. Egyptian religion (as conveyed through Hermeticism) emphasised knowledge, which came about both through revelation (the understanding of symbols), and through the power of magic (as exhibited through alchemy and divine protection). Ancient gods and goddesses symbolising different energies and powers persisted via Hermetic philosophy, and even formed part of the Christian discourse of the medieval period.8 By linking the Renaissance directly back to ancient Egypt by association with the Egyptian priest Imhotep (2667 BCE–2600 BCE), who was proposed as one of the texts’ authors, the sacred scarab may well have worked its way back into the limelight via its original promoters.9 One man who brought these divergent strands of religions, hermeticism and dung beetles together into the heart of the Catholic Church was Athanasius Kircher (circa 1601–1680). Born in Germany, he became a Jesuit at the same time that the Thirty Years’ War began. 35\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nHe travelled widely and ultimately ended up in Rome, where he befriended the high and mighty, including Pope Urban VIII. Kirchner learned Hebrew as a young man, and came to believe that the solution to all communication problems was the development of a common language. He believed that Egyptian hieroglyphs were the magical key linking symbolic thought with language, and that once such thought was unlocked, humankind would be brought closer to God. In pursuit of his theory, he set out to translate and understand hieroglyphs, basing his research on the works of Horapollo, Plutarch and the Mensa Isiaca,10 a famous Roman table reputed to be the table of Isis, but which turned out to be a fake with meaningless hieroglyphs. Kircher devoted much of his time to his great opus, and finally published his Oedipus Aegyptiacus between 1652 and 1654. The work was a failure, but is of interest to us as he included a curious and fascinating image of a scarab rolling a ball of dung through the planetary spheres. It is likely that Kircher would have come across the scarab in the Coptic writings that he had access to via the French astronomer, savant and antiquarian Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc (1580 –1637). Kircher had many strange and fascinating ideas, not least of which was that all water was stored in a massive subterranean sphere under the earth, with rivers springing from this source. In a short manuscript he wrote entitled Mundus Subterraneus he suggested that awareness of what he termed ‘panspermia’11 was first developed in ancient Egypt, and it was the dung beetle with its ball ‘orbiting the globe, [which] gives it life and fertility by the means of the same panspermia rerum and fills it with every kind of thing.’12 For Kircher, the scarab provided a vivid demonstration of the belief that putrefaction bred life. It was a widespread conviction that accorded well with the concept of the spontaneous self-generation of insects, a belief inherited from the writings of both Aristotle and Pliny. There can be no doubt that Kircher understood some of the significance of Khepri to the Egyptians, but his inaccurate understanding of the hieroglyphs meant that he 36\n\nC r aw l i n g o u t o f t he da r k n e s s\n\ndid not place Khepri properly in Egyptian cosmology, and instead introduced him in a modified and altered form into the alchemical realm he found so compelling. Kircher’s writings were immensely influential in the undefined territory of the time between chemistry and alchemy; they captured the reigning current of confusion between knowledge that threatened traditional Christianity alongside concepts of sun gods orbiting globes, which he seriously believed entertained varieties of acceptable truth about the workings of the physical world. Kircher’s fanciful muddle did not appear to earn him any significant opprobrium from the Catholic Church. Galileo Galilei’s assertion that earth was not the centre of the universe was a challenge of an entirely different order. Kircher’s patron, Pope Urban VIII, who left Kircher in peace to write and publish his strange theories, was to imprison Galileo (1564–1642) for his radical discoveries, which the Inquisition denounced as a direct challenge to the Church. Galileo was one of the first men to openly undermine the received wisdom of Aristotle, and to question the Church. His support of the Copernican theory of a sun-centred solar system led to him being accused of heresy. He was found guilty and placed under house arrest until his death. It seems incomprehensible that what is now so obvious represented such a challenge to the power of the Church. History is inevitably littered with the detritus of such discarded beliefs, but the process is rarely rushed, linear or clear, as supported by the curious fact that the Catholic Church only officially reversed their decision on Galileo’s ‘heresy’ in 1992, while Kircher continues to be somewhat dubiously described as ‘the last man who knew everything’. In Northern Europe, a contemporary of Galileo’s, Rene Descartes (1596–1650), was preparing an equally fundamental challenge to the Church. His experience of the Thirty Years’ War had led him to a profound intellectual response to the consequences of religious uncertainty: a new philosophy that began with the simple but startling premise, ‘I think therefore I am.’ This evolved into four steps that ultimately underpinned the development of the modern empirical 37\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nscientific method. The first step was to accept nothing that could not be clearly recognised to be true. The second step was to divide up each of the difficulties into as many parts as possible so as to resolve the question in the best way possible. The third part was to start with the simplest and easiest issue in order to rise to the most complex, even if the order was a fictitious one, and there was no natural sequence. The last point was to make notes as complete as possible and compile reviews in which none of the methods used were omitted. Such deceptively simple order and logic posed part of the scientific challenge both Descartes and Galileo introduced into a world still inclined to entertain the old magical symbolic thinking of Kircher. It would take time to dislodge the latter, but once the door had been opened, it was impossible to close it. The tension between the two opposing worldviews nevertheless persisted even in progressive environments, where empirical observation and methods were beginning to reverse centuries of traditional practice. Dutch medical schools of the time had many outstanding scholars who straddled the two worlds while introducing new medical practices. Despite personal interests in the arcane, the progressive and innovative changes of teachers such as Otto Heurnius were to cement the growing reputation of Holland as a centre for medical excellence. Attracted by this repute Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), a Swedish medical student, chose to complete his studies in Holland and received his degree of Doctor of Medicine from Harderwijk University. He then enrolled for further studies at Leiden University. Holland was experiencing what is now called its Golden Age, stimulated in part by the ending of Spanish rule, as well as its control over resources from the Far East via the Dutch East India Company or Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC). The VOC, a key player in the resurgent strength and wealth of Holland, was founded in 1602. It was to become the first multinational company in the world, and evolved a number of strategies to maintain its monopolies. One of these was the establishment of a tight grip on its holdings, including forbidding employees from disseminating knowledge about anything found within territories under the control 38\n\nC r aw l i n g o u t o f t he da r k n e s s\n\nof the VOC. The only reason that objects with no obvious commercial potential arrived in Holland was because of the demands made by individual directors, rather than any scientific interest or desire on the part of the company to learn about anything other than profit. Most of the directors of the VOC demonstrated a mercantile mindset, but there were exceptions, and George Clifford III (1685–1760) was one of them. It was at his famous country estate Hartekamp near Harlem, lavishly endowed with specimens brought back from exotic destinations, that Linnaeus had eagerly sought employment after encountering what he ecstatically called the four houses of Adonis. These were hothouses filled with the flora of Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas, as well as a museum of which he declared that he had never seen the like of before. Linnaeus had demonstrated an interest in the naming of plants from a young age, and the combination of his work back in Swedish Lapland, and his studies in Holland resulted in his remarkable and seminal publication Systema Naturae (1735), a catalogue of all the species of the world. Although initially only 12 pages long, it was the equivalent of splitting the atom in the way it was to transform how all information about the flora and fauna of the world was to be organised. He used flower structures to order them into related groups, and described the sexual parts of the flowers in Latin to reveal how species that might appear very different may in fact be closely related. Despite the immediate success of this logical system, Linnaeus was criticised as lascivious because of his emphasis on sex. The Polyandria,13 for instance, translates as ‘twenty or more males in bed with the same female’.14 The Bishop of Carlisle said that ‘nothing could equal the gross prurience of Linnaeus’s mind.’15 Needless to say, despite the inevitable criticisms of eighteenth-century trolls, the system was a success and forms the basis of the binomial nomenclature we still use to name all living organisms. However, this was not simply a way of ordering information; it also represented something more profound to scientific thinking of 39\n\nDA N C E O F T H E D U N G B E E T L E S\n\nthe day. A hundred years earlier, Descartes in his 1637 Discourse on Method, had suggested that even if there was no order in a subject, it would be necessary to create an artificial order as part of the process of coming to know the likely answer to a question. Linnaeus had successfully taken up that baton and presented the world with what became an enduring structure for ordering information. In the world of dung beetles, Linnaeus began to unravel the confusion surrounding the naming of what until then had loosely been defined as scarabs. He started appropriately by formally describing the sacred scarab (Scarabaeus sacer) within his own binomial system in 1758, in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. Specimen 3344 can still be found in the collections of the Linnaean Society, with a locality label bearing the script ‘Algiers’ attesting to its North African origin. It is an arche"
