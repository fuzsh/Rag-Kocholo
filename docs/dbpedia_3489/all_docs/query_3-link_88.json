        "text": "Abstract : The history of the Underground Railroad has long been marked by contentious debate. Surviving evidence from Jefferson County, Indiana, sheds new light on the day-to- day operations of the Underground Railroad in southeastern Indiana and the Ohio River border region. Historian J. Michael Raley examines the complex interracial network of fugitive slaves, their enslaved and free black families and friends, the free black residents of the Georgetown community in Madison, Indiana, and white abolitionists from area churches and antislavery societies. Their efforts were not without risk. In aiding runaway slaves in their flight northward, people of color secretly collaborated with trusted whites at grave peril to themselves and their families, and despite all efforts, fugitives from slavery far too often were recaptured in route. For those who succeeded in reaching Canada as well as for those who aided them, however, the potential dangers were always more than worth the risk.\n\nThis article defines the part that the town of Quindaro played in the struggle for ethnic social justice on the Territorial Kansas Frontier. The unique characteristics and personalities that combined to create the Quindaro Underground Railroad are presented and analyzed. This Underground Railroad managed to bridge the seemingly insurmountable political gap between the proslavery town of Parkville, Missouri, and the brazenly abolitionist Territorial town of Quindaro. The article emphasizes the Native Wyandot foundation of the town, the town's role in helping rescue the abolitionist movement in the Territory, and provides pathways to future research about Quindaro which can help enrich our understanding of this multi-ethnic collaboration and provide a model for ethnic solidarity today.\n\nThis article engages new histories of the black frontline communities of the Underground Railroad to rethink both fugitive democracy and the transformative possibilities of sanctuary as its constitutive twin. We analyze the ways that communities of free blacks and fugitives in the border zones between the Antebellum US North and South crafted themselves as magnetic spaces of creative refuge that suggest we reconceive sanctuary as the generative twin of fugitivity. This insight enables us to theorize new ethical and political dimensions of Sheldon Wolin’s concept fugitive democracy by illuminating how fugitivity as flight away from danger can be interwoven with sanctuary as flight into and toward alternatives. Specifically, we theorize three dimensions of fugitive democracy/transformative sanctuary—sanctuary tending, dramatic sanctuary, and disruptive hospitality. While some theorists have considered key motifs in Wolin’s fugitive democracy to be opposed to vital themes disclosed in ..."
