        "text": "Thaddeus Wadleigh grew up on a ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico without electricity or running water. This multi-cultured and off-the-grid lifestyle prompted him to make documentaries. He developed an early love of observing and recording his surroundings. In addition to his award-winning documentary cinematography, Thad has shot narrative films, commercials and television series. His doc credits include: The Hunting Ground, The Invisible War, Who Killed The Electric Car, and Sicko."
