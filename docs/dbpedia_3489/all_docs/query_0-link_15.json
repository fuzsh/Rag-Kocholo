        "text": "Dear Programmers:\n\nTFC is thrilled to announce that the incomparable Robert Redford has come aboard as a voice-over narrator for our environmental film A FIERCE GREEN FIRE. The film was an official selection of the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, where it played to sold out audiences with temp narration.\n\nMr. Redford—the first of five celebrity narrators added to the film—now narrates the first section of the film, entitled “Conservation.” A FIERCE GREEN FIRE is the first big-picture exploration of the environmental movementâgrassroots and global activism spanning fifty years from conservation to climate change. Email us at festivals@thefilmcollaborative.org to see the film.\n\nIn addition, we are proud to announce that TFC's film THE INVISIBLE WAR, winner of the Documentary Audience Award at Sundance 2012, has just won the Silver Heart Award at the 2012 Dallas International Film Festival.

Weiss\n\nEditors Ken Schneider, Veronica Selver, Jon Beckhardt\n\nCinematographer Vicente Franco\n\nMusic George Michalski, Sonya Kitchell, Garth Stevenson, Randall Wallace\n\nCast Featuring narration by Robert Redford\n\nABOUT THE FILM:\n\nA FIERCE GREEN FIRE: The Battle For a Living Planet is the first big-picture exploration of the environmental movement—grassroots and global activism spanning fifty years from conservation to climate change. From halting dams in the Grand Canyon to battling 20,000 tons of toxic waste at Love Canal; from Greenpeace saving the whales to Chico Mendes and the rubbertappers saving the Amazon; from climate change to the promise of transforming our civilization, the film tells vivid stories about people fighting —and succeeding—against enormous odds.\n\nIt’s not easy being green.\n\nEnvironmentalists have been revered and reviled, for being killjoys and Cassandras. Every battle begins as a lost cause and even the victories have to be fought for again and again. Still, environmentalism is one of the great causes of the twentieth century, and one of the keys to the twenty-first. It has arisen at a juncture in history when humans have come to rival nature as a power determining the fate of the earth. It’s the battle for a living planet.\n\nA FIERCE GREEN FIRE focuses on activism. It’s about movements more than issues. It’s a more engaging approach, full of drama and passion. It’s also a more open-ended approach than cant and rant. We emphasize synthesis, bringing together all the pieces of the environmental picture to explore connections, resonance, larger visions and deeper meanings. Never has a film told the full story of environmentalism. Our hope is it will be a defining film that reaches and teaches a huge and hungry audience.\n\nFeaturing narration by Robert Redford.\n\nFESTIVALS\n\nSundance 2012\n\nFESTIVAL TERRITORIES\n\nThe World, except for North America\n\nEXHIBITION FORMATS\n\nHDCAM, Digibeta, DVD\n\nClick here for more information about this film.\n\nWEBSITE:\n\nafiercegreenfire.com\n\n2011 | USA | 95 min.\n\nWriter & Director Kirby Dick\n\nProducers Amy Ziering, Tanner King Barklow\n\nExecutive Producers Regina Kulik Scully, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, Geralyn White Dreyfous, Abigail Disney, Maria Cuomo Cole, Sarah Johnson Redlich, Teddy Leifer, Sally Jo Fifer, Nicole Boxer-Keegan\n\nCo-Producer Kimball Stroud\n\nEditors Doug Blush, Derek Boonstra\n\nCinematographers Thaddeus Wadleigh, Kirsten Johnson\n\nABOUT THE FILM:\n\nCasualties of war rage beyond the battlefield. As ranks of women in the American military swell, so do incidents of rape. An estimated 30 percent of servicewomen and at least 1 percent of servicemen are sexually assaulted during their enlistment. And not by the enemy, but at the hands of fellow soldiers. With stark clarity and escalating revelations, The Invisible War exposes a rape epidemic in the armed forces, investigating the institutions that perpetuate it as well as its profound personal and social consequences.\n\nWe meet characters who embraced their service with pride and professionalism, only to have their idealism crushed. Their chilling stories of violent sexual assault become even more rattling as they seek justice in a Kafkaesque military legal system. As a courageous few defy victimhood, they face their most challenging fight yet: penetrating a closed circuit where officers collude, cases are routinely swept under the rug, and few perpetrators are tried or convicted.\n\nFESTIVALS\n\nSundance 2012 (Audience Award, Documentary), Dallas International 2012 (Silver Heart Award), Hot Docs 2012, San Francisco International Film Festival, Seattle International Film Festival, Human Rights Watch Film Festival\n\nFESTIVAL TERRITORIES\n\nThe World\n\nEXHIBITION FORMATS\n\nHDCAM, Digibeta, Blu-Ray, DVD\n\nClick here for more information about this film.\n\nWEBSITE:\n\ninvisiblewarmovie.com\n\n2012 | USA | 92 min.\n\nDirector Chris Arnold\n\nProducer Mark Schoen\n\nEditor Chris Arnold\n\nCinematographers Jon Dunham, Ed Stevens, Jerry Feldman\n\nSound Paul Kalbach, David Silberberg, Darcel Walker\n\nMusic Wayne Gratz\n\nABOUT THE FILM:\n\nTRANS is an extraordinary documentary feature about men and women, and all the variations in between. It is about the Transgender Community, perhaps the most misunderstood and mistreated minority in America and around the world. Inspired by the incredible story of Dr. Christine McGinn and her work as a transgender surgeon, and featured on Anderson Cooper and Dr. Oz, TRANS provides an up-close and very personal vision into the lives, loves, and challenges of a remarkable cast of characters of all ages and from all walks of life. Stories of confusion and courage, excitement and emotion that have never been told, until now. To anyone who has ever looked in a mirror and wondered, “who they really are?” TRANS ask another question, “are you brave enough to find out?”\n\nFESTIVALS\n\nThessaloniki Documentary Festival (World Premiere), 2012 Torino GLBT Film Festival (Winner, Best Documentary)\n\nFESTIVAL TERRITORIES\n\nThe World\n\nEXHIBITION FORMATS\n\nHDCAM, Digibeta, DVD\n\nClick here for more information about this film.\n\nWEBSITE:"
