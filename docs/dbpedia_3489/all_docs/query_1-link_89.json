        "text": "Ah, Utah – home of great Skiing, The Utah Jazz, Robert Redford, The Sundance Film Festival, and adjoined to that\n\ncelebration the Canon Creative Studio, which just wrapped-up Monday Night, January 26th, the Sundance Film Festival was underway until February 1st. The Canon Creative Studio served as a haven from the creative chaos that is the Sundance Film Festival, providing a relaxed yet engaging atmosphere for rest from the hubbub, along with insightful exchanges, and networking with like-minded professionals.\n\nThe noon daily tutorial on the use of the EOS C100 Mark II was helpful to all the happy new owners and perspective purchasers, especially the focus on its dim light usage, and its sweet and silky Dual Pixel CMOS AF, and when you combine that (and its other cool base features) with its remote control capacities, you end up with a very nice camera. The helpful and knowledgeable instructor for this was the talented Loren Simons (Sr. Product and Sales Trainer, Canon USA).\n\nMonday’s panels were insightful. Although it’s obvious on the surface, some filmmakers seem to forget that half the population is female. Monday’s panel on the women in cinematography, and film from the female perspective, hopefully reinforced that notion in the industry attendees. Why just appeal to half the population if you could offer something for everyone? The next panel that day had us taking a good look at the many drone camera ideas and uses – this was certainly an eye opener. That talk is sure to have stirred some of the attendees to action exploring this new(ish) area of camera usage. After that, it was time for Sundance veteran (DP) John Guleserian to share his insights on the usage of the Cinema EOS C500, along with fellow panelist Tim Smith (Canon) and the events moderator Paula Bernstein (Indiewire) who helped expand on and enhance his comments. Monday helped get attendees brains abuzz with possibilities.\n\nOn Sunday, attendees were once again treated to another in-depth look at the creative use of another fine camera; the Canon’s Cinema EOS C300 and its interaction with a premium Adobe product, the Premiere Pro CC. Cinematographer Adam Mcdaid, & Consulting Editor Rob Legato, along with Mike Kanfer (Adobe), Tim Smith (Canon), and event moderator Paula Bernstein (Indiewire) also took part in a lively discussion of the camera and the software and the workflow betwixt the twain. Also, that same day, Horror Meister Eli Roth & some of his gang discussed one of their thrillers “Knock Knock” and how the Cinema EOS-1D C camera in particular helped them get the scares right. The good folks at Canon and these expert filmmakers really helped the audience to appreciate the visual power that the DSLR helps promote. It’s a feature so good it was scary! Panelists in this discussion included Eli Roth (Director), Antonio Quercia (Cinematographer), and Aaron Burns (Actor, co-star of Keanu Reeves in the film (whoa, excellent!)). Canon’s Creative Studio event moderator, the talented Paula Bernstein (Indiewire) was also present. After 4PM that day (for those of you on Eastern Time that would have been at 2 pm) it was time for the Canon Crew Party in honor of crew members on the Sundance films. This RSVP event was a blast, what happens at the party stays at the party (wink).\n\nMonday was the final day of the Canon Creative Studio. Loren Simons gave her final Noon tutorial on the EOS C100 Mark\n\nII. Canon expert Tim Smith, and event favorite moderator Paula Bernstein (Indiewire) presided over a discussion on the specialized demands and choice of tools required for crafting of the documentaries of today. The bulk of the panelists included former and current Sundance independent filmmakers Crystal Moselle (Director/DP, The Wolfpack), Thaddeus Wadleigh (DP, The Hunting Ground), and Bradley Stonesifer (DP, Call Me Lucky).\n\nThings got a little more cinematic at that point and attendees were treated to a documentary “Bending the Light” at the New Frontier Microcinema (the film was about some of director Michael Apteds workers and artists and the creation of a lens). Stephen Goldblatt, (ASC, BSC), and the now familiar moderator Paula Bernstein answered questions after the film. After the film, it was back to the studio to wrap everything up (from 4:30-ish ‘til the event closed) this was the Canon Closing Cocktail Hour, the last chance to hob-nob with the remaining panelists, and attendees and get a last longing look at the neat toys from Canon.\n\nSo, there you have it folks; each day began at noon with the EOS C100 Mark II class. Saturday was sort of a grab bag of topics, Sunday helped showcase some sweet Canon products and their practical use on set. Followed by an invite only Sundance party. Then, Sunday focused on documentaries followed by the closing ceremony (so to speak). Sundance is over; hopefully, you got the chance to catch a couple of shows and then make the most of winter and hit a few slopes on any of the areas fine resorts; after you thaw, it’s back on the plane and back to the studio.\n\nHopefully, all that fresh mountain air, and avant garde films helped revitalize and inspire you in the months to come.\n\nAbout Canon U.S.A., Inc.\n\nCanon U.S.A., Inc., is a leading provider of consumer, business-to-business, and industrial digital imaging solutions to the United States and to Latin America and the Caribbean (excluding Mexico) markets.
