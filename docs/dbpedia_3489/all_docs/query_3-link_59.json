        "text": "George H. Butler was a Gilded Age writer, diplomat, and soldier, who was also a poster boy for what Richard Stott identifies as the “jolly fellow.” Butler parlayed a witty writing style to enter journalism, and with the help of his influencial uncle, Benjamin Butler, he obtained a diplomatic posting as consul general to Egypt. Overly fond of alcohol, George Butler participated in several newsworthy fights, often involving deadly force. His life serves as an archetype for out-of-control manliness, which was contrary to gender expectations of polite society in 1870s America.\n\n2 We found no reference that Butler ever advanced beyond the rank of First Lieutenant, yet his uncle, writing to President Grant on January 19, 1873, uses “Colonel Butler.” Simon, John Y., ed., The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant, vol. 22, June 1, 1871 to January 31, 1872 (Carbondale, IL, 1998)Google Scholar [Hence Grant Papers], 192.\n\n4 Mark Twain's Autobiography, Part 2 (Whitefish, MT, 2003), 218–19Google Scholar. The 1850 Census lists George as twelve years old and his father's occupation as “none.” Ten years later, his father was a “real estate broker” and George an “engineer.” See also Nancy Stone, “In Memory of Mark Twain on the Anniversary of his Death,” Lake Gazette 14 (August 4, 2010), No. 27, online version.\n\n7 “Broderick. Broderick's Last Will and Testament,” Sacramento Daily Bee (February 13, 1860), 1; “The Broderick Will. Note from Geo. Wilkes, Esq,” New York Times, December 10, 1869, 1; California v.

Hearn, Andrew Butler was persona non-grata to Massachusetts Governor John A. Andrew, so the Senate never confirmed his commission. This may have been a “golden insult” as lack of official status allowed Andrew tremendous leeway in his brother's administration of occupied New Orleans. See When the Devil Came Down to Dixie: Ben Butler in New Orleans (Baton Rouge, 2000), 48Google Scholar, 183.\n\n12 In May 1862, his own officers brought Pierce up on charges, accusing him of incompetence and “improper conduct.” The latter because he allowed soldiers to sing racy songs and provided burlesque shows for their entertainment. As will be shown, George Butler was very hostile to burlesque acts in 1869 New York. Bowen, James L., Massachusetts in the War, 1861–1865 (Springfield, MA, 1889), 137Google Scholar; John H. and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands (Palo Alto, CA, 2001), 422Google Scholar; Lowry, Thomas P., Curmudgeons, Drunkards and Outright Fools; The Courts Martials of Civil War Union Colonels (Lincoln, NE, 2003), 199–203Google Scholar.\n\n17 After considerable provocation, Butler issued General Order No. 28, which declared women who showed disrespect to federal soldiers would be treated as prostitutes. This earned him the nickname “Beast Butler”; he was also called “Spoons Butler,” an allusion to his confiscation of Confederate properties. Hearn, When the Devil Came Down to Dixie, remains a fun book that expands on these points.\n\n18 “An Old Confederate Dead,” New York Times, July 4, 1887; Correspondence ... Butler, vol. II: 423, 530; Cornell, John A., The Pioneers of Beverly (Dundas, ONT, 1887), 16Google Scholar; Syrett, John, The Civil War Confiscation Acts (New York, 2005), 82–83CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Winters, John D., The Civil War in Louisiana (Baton Rouge, 1963), 137–38Google Scholar. General William F. Smith and James T. Brady, a lawyer, were appointed in December 1864. Most of their findings are in the National Archives, Records of the Adjutant General's Office, 1780s–1917, RG 94.11, Other AGO Records, 1861–74.\n\n20 “Smartest damn rascal,” cited in Smith, Michael T., “The Beast Unleashed: Benjamin Butler and the Conceptions of Masculinity in the Civil War North,” New England Quarterly, 79 (June 2006): 275–76Google Scholar. See also “Law Reports; the Will of Col. A. J. Butler,” New York Times, June 1, 1864, 1. Benjamin Butler claimed only $35,921 remained of his brother's estate after all debts and obligations had been met.\n\n21 The National Archives reported no records pertaining to George H. Butler's service with the Massachusetts volunteers or U.S. regulars. Civil War historian James A. Morgan called this “unusual,” and considering Butler's checkered career, plus his uncle's influence, even “suspicious.” Morgan to Dunn, E-Mail correspondence, June 22, 2009; Butler is mentioned a few times in regimental correspondence; see Returns from Regular Army Infantry Regiments, 1821–1916, Tenth Infantry, 1855–1862, microfilm roll 113, National Archives.

Pfaff,” New York Times, April 26, 1890,1; G.J.M., “Bohemianism: The American Authors Who Meet in a Cellar,” Brooklyn Eagle, May 25, 1884, 9.\n\n36 Bowles, editor of the Springfield Republican, argued the press should be like “a dreadful mastiff rather than a crouching spaniel.” “The Arrest of Mr. Samuel Bowles,” New York Times, December 29, 1868, 8; McAlpine, R. W., The Life and Times of Col. James Fisk Jr. (New York, 1872), 168Google Scholar, 333; Swanberg, W. A., Jim Fisk.

Smith, Too Foul and Dishonoring to Be Overlooked: Newspaper Responses to Controversial English Stars in the Northeastern United States, 1820–1870, (Ph.D. diss., University of Texas at Austin, 2010). See also George Wilkes, “How to Settle with England,” Spirit of the Times, February 13, 1869.\n\n46 Very few 1869 newspapers provided bylines, so Henderson did not immediately know of Butler's authorship. Allen, Horrible Prettiness, 129–30; “The Battle of the Blondes. Renewal of the Henderson-Butler Controversy. Arrest of Defendant Butler,” New York Times, November 16, 1869; and “Light Reading about a Light Manager—The Shovel-Nosed Shark in the Sea of Vice,” Spirit of the Times, May 22, 1869, 4.\n\n50 “Battle of the Blondes,” New York Times, June 3, 1869; Welsh, Deschler, The Theatre (New York, 1886), vol. I: 253Google Scholar, claims Butler had been snubbed by one of the Thompson troupe, who had instead shown an interest for Henderson, which led to a “war to the knife” via “Butler's bitter pen.”\n\n52 Did Butler teach Henderson and Thompson a lesson in “American” manners? On February, 24 1870, after being attacked in print by Wilbur F. Storey, editor of the Chicago Times, the duo, along with two accomplices, ambushed Storey in front of his home, while Thompson and a fellow actress beat him with a horsewhip. Then, as Storey reached for his pocket, Henderson ordered him to stop or, “I will shoot you like a dog!” Allen, Horrible Prettiness, 19–20; “An Editor Assaulted.” Chicago Tribune, February, 25 1870, 4.\n\n54 United States v.

For more on the Egyptian Army and international arms merchants, see Dunn, John P., “Egypt's Nineteenth-Century Armaments Industry,” Journal of Military History 61 (April 1997): 231–54CrossRefGoogle Scholar. Ottoman authorities purchased the Winchester, and employed it with great effect at Plevna during the Russo-Turkish War. For details see Richard Trenk Jr, “The Plevna Delay,” Man at Arms Magazine, August 19, 1977; this article is also online.\n\n65 “Mott to Khedive,” n.d. and “Mott-Winchester Contract,” Carton 179, Dossier 50/7, Periodé Ismail, Dar al-Wathaiq, Egyptian National Archives, Cairo. Butler, a Class C Consular Official, was allowed to engage in private business transactions as his government salary was expenses plus $500 per year. For more on the duties and challenges of diplomatic work in Ismail's Egypt, see Hale, Charles, “Consular Service and Society in Egypt,” Atlantic Monthly, XL (September 1877): 280–90Google Scholar.\n\n66 Morgan, James III, A Little Short of Boats: The Fights at Ball's Bluff and Edward's Ferry; October 21–22, 1861 (Havertown, PA, 2004)Google Scholar provides the best account of the fighting. Farwell, Byron, Ball's Bluff: A Small Battle and its Long Shadow (Howell Press online, 1990)Google Scholar does well with the political repercussions. Also useful, Currie, James T., “Congressional Oversight Run Amok: Ball's Bluff and the Ruination of Charles Stone,” Parameters: U.S. Army War College 23 (August 1993): 96–105Google Scholar. Charles Pomeroy Stone had a fascinating life, one very much deserving a biography—how about it dear reader?\n\n70 Beauregard had been vocal in his denunciations of “Beast Butler.” See “General Beauregard,”1. Piasters were small Egyptian silver coins. “Beauregard and the Khedive,” New York Times, July 21, 1882, 6; “Interview with Butler,” New Orleans Times-Democrat, July 21, 1882, 1. For a good introduction to Ismail's American mercenaries, see Hesseltine, William B. and Wolf, Hazel C., The Blue and the Grey on the Nile (Chicago, 1961)Google Scholar. For more details, see Dunn, John P., “Americans in the Nineteenth-Century Egyptian Army: A Selected Bibliography,” Journal of Military History 70 (January 2006): 123–36CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n71 Much has been written on the capitulations; for a good start try Maurits van den Boogert, H., The Capitulations and the Ottoman Legal System: Qadis, Consuls, and Beraths in the 18th century (Leiden, 2005)Google Scholar. American capitulation rights did not end until 1937. See “Convention Regarding Abolition of Capitulations in Egypt,” American Journal of International Law 34, Sullement: Official Documents (Oct. 1940: 201–25).

Strang, who suspected Strologo's attack, came to the rail station with a “loaded cane,” i.e., with a metal core for superior bashing. He provided a lively account of this cane fight in “Bully Butler. The Assault on Missionary Strang,” Brooklyn Eagle, August 4, 1871, 2. Sadly, the Levant Herald only survives in British and Turkish libraries.\n\n78 For a lengthy account of the findings, see “Starring on Butler,” World, September 24, 1872, 2. Butler denied the charges; see “Bully Butler in Self Defense,” Brooklyn Eagle, August 17, 1871, 2. See also Grant Papers, 22, 190.
