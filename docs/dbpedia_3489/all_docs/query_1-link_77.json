        "text": "Working titles included Grounded and Teeny Weenies, as noted in several contemporary sources including the May 1988 issue of Box and 7 Sep 1988 Var.\n\nAn 18 Jun 1989 NYT article stated that executive producer Thomas G. Smith, who previously worked at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), received Ed Naha’s script shortly after finishing the 3-D film Captain EO, a Disneyland theme park attraction starring Michael Jackson. Walt Disney Pictures was on board to produce Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, with Stuart Gordon attached to direct. However, Gordon became ill and dropped out, prompting Smith to recommend former ILM art director Joe Johnston as his replacement. Johnston suggested changes to the screenplay, which he found too special effects-heavy and lacking in dimensional characters, and Tom Schulman was brought on for a rewrite. According to a 7 Sep 1988 Var item, Martin Short was initially attached to play “Wayne Szalinski” but was later replaced by Rick Moranis.\n\nA 23 Sep 1987 Var news brief announced that set construction had begun on stages 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 at Churubusco Studios in Mexico City, Mexico, where the film was shot in its entirety. Filming was initially expected to begin early Jan 1988, but a 2 Mar 1988 Var production chart cited the start of principal photography as 20 Jan 1988.\n\nSets and props took more than nine months to build, as stated in production notes in AMPAS library files. A May/Jun 1989 Disney Channel Magazine article reported that twelve houses, complete with front and backyards, were built in addition to a ten-foot-tall oatmeal cookie made from polyurethane foam and real cream filling, forty-foot-tall urethane foam blades of grass, and a giant mechanical ant that required a dozen puppeteers to operate. The ant was constructed using latex foam core and horse hair, and recreated for stop-motion sequences in which the children rode atop the insect.\n\nFor the scene in which miniaturized “Nick Szalinski” drops into a bowl of Cheerios cereal, a tank was filled with 16,000 gallons of a milk-like substance made from chlorinated water, food thickener, and pigment. The Cheerios, according to a 17 Jul 1989 People brief, were made from tractor inner tubes, twelve feet in diameter, coated in foam.\n\nAn 18 Jun 1989 NYT article stated that scenes involving the adult characters were shot first, followed by special effects-heavy scenes in which the children worked on oversized sets. To blend the normal-sized and miniature worlds, footage from first and second units was combined with blue screen material, special effects shots, and Vistavision reductions. Production notes stated that many scenes “were built from over eighty different pieces of film.”\n\nA 26 Feb 1988 LAHExam item cited the film’s expected release date as Christmas 1988. The opening was delayed until 23 Jun 1989, and the May/Jun 1989 issue of Disney Channel Magazine noted that a behind-the-scenes documentary, The Making of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, would premiere 9 Jun 1989 on the Disney Channel.\n\nThe theatrical release included a seven-and-a-half-minute animated short which preceded the film titled Tummy Trouble, featuring “Roger Rabbit” from Disney’s recent blockbuster Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988, see entry). Tummy Trouble marked the first animated short Disney had released since 1965, and a 17 Jun 1989 LAT article estimated that it cost $1.8 million. After an initial trailer devoted entirely to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids played in theaters for three months, another trailer for the film devoted its first two-thirds to the short, aiming to draw in Roger Rabbit fans.\n\nCritical reception was generally positive, and the film was a box-office success, grossing $22.2 million in its first week of release, as reported in a 30 Jun 1989 HR brief. First-week earnings surpassed Disney’s “previous highest single-week record of $20.6 million recorded by Three Men and a Baby” (1987, see entry). The film went on to gross $130 million in theaters and became the sixth-highest grossing home video of 1990, as stated in a 28 Oct 1996 HR article. A 28 Jun 1989 LAT article called Disney’s decision to pair Tummy Trouble with Honey, I Shrunk the Kids “a master stroke,” and suggested the film benefitted from moviegoers who were unable to secure tickets to sold-out releases of Batman (1989, see entry), the highest-grossing release with the same opening weekend as Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.\n\nA 13 Dec 1989 LAT brief reported that the Society for the Preservation of English Language and Literature (SPELL) awarded Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with its 1989 Dunce Cap Award, citing the title’s grammatical error of using the word “shrunk” instead of “shrank.” An unnamed Disney executive responded that the incorrect usage was on purpose and directly referenced a line of dialogue.\n\nAn 18 Feb 1994 DV item noted that screenwriter Jeffrey Kouf sued Disney, claiming the idea for Honey, I Shrunk the Kids was stolen from his screenplay about “a boy who invents a people-shrinking formula.” The lawsuit was rejected by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld an earlier ruling by a federal judge that the works were not “substantially similar.”\n\nThe film inspired a sequel, 1992’s Honey, I Blew Up the Kid (see entry), a playground at Disney’s Hollywood Studios in Orlando, FL, and a theme park attraction: a 3-D film titled Honey, I Shrunk the Audience, which replaced Captain EO in 1994 at Disneyland, Epcot, Disneyland Park in Paris, France, and Tokyo Disneyland. The attraction was shut down in early 2010, when Captain EO was brought back, according to a 9 May 2010 South Florida Sun–Sentinel article. The 28 Oct 1996 HR reported that a television series based on the film, titled Honey, I Shrunk the Kids – The Series, received a green-light from Buena Vista Television, with John Landis set to supervise creative elements of the show. According to HR, the series would be brought to the syndication market as early as the following week for an expected fall 1997 launch. As planned, the series premiered in fall 1997 and lasted three seasons, according to a 17 Apr 2000 Broadcasting & Cable news item, which announced its cancellation. A third feature-length sequel was produced, according to a 20 Mar 1997 LAT item, which noted that the project, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, was released straight-to-video. Rick Moranis, who also starred in Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, reprised his role as Wayne Szalinski. The film marked Disney’s “first live-action direct-to-video feature.”\n\nJoe Johnston made his feature film directorial debut with Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. The 18 Jun 1989 NYT quoted Johnston as saying that Disney had never gambled such a large budget on a first-time director, according to then studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\nEnd credits state: “Filmed on location at Estudios Churubusco, Mexico City.”\n\nLess\n\nGadgets abound in the Szalinski home, where inventor Wayne Szalinski is working in the attic on his latest invention, a shrink ray machine. His experiment on an apple fails, blowing up the fruit instead of shrinking it. Meanwhile, teenaged Amy Szalinski cooks breakfast for Wayne and her little brother, Nick, and comments to a friend on the phone that her mother, Diane, spent the night away after an argument with Wayne. Next door, Big Russ Thompson is awakened by the sound of Wayne’s tinkering, goes outside to complain, and walks into a booby trap set by his son, Ron. Big Russ asks his elder son, Little Russ, if he is excited about their upcoming fishing trip, but the teenager says fishing is not his “thing.” Big Russ’s wife, Mae, informs her husband that Little Russ is upset because he was cut from the football team for being too small. Big Russ insists his son must act big if he wants to feel big. Heading out for an important presentation, Wayne gets a call from his wife, Diane, who says she is coming home later and wishes him luck. Wayne asks Amy and Nick to clean the house and mow the lawn while he is away. Nick tempts a neighbor named Tommy into mowing the lawn for free with the Szalinksis’ remote controlled lawnmower, but the boy cannot do it until later that day. Readying to leave on a fishing trip, the Thompsons pack a recreational vehicle, and Little Russ spies Amy dancing with a mop in her kitchen. Big Russ pulls his mesmerized son into the shed and encourages him to lift weights, but again, Little Russ claims weightlifting is not his thing. When Little Russ refuses to throw a baseball for Ron, Ron peers over the backyard fence and asks Nick if he ever takes part in anything normal, like baseball. Nick says no and Ron calls him a worm. Soon after, he tosses a baseball into the air and accidentally bats it into the Szalinskis’ attic window. The ball crashes through the glass, hits Wayne’s shrink ray machine, and activates it. The machine’s laser settles on Wayne’s “thinking couch” and shrinks the furniture to a miniature size. Little Russ drags Ron next door to apologize and stumbles over his words when Amy greets them. She instructs Nick to take Ron to the attic to retrieve his ball, but when the boys go upstairs, they are zapped by the shrink ray. Amy and Little Russ go in search of them and the machine zaps them as well. Elsewhere, Wayne gives a presentation about his device, but naysayers in the audience demand proof. The miniaturized Amy, Nick, Little Russ, and Ron cower when the Szalinski family dog, Quark, runs into the attic and \"blasts\" their ears with its bark. When Wayne returns home, the children shout to get his attention, but he cannot hear them. He notices his couch is missing, then angrily bashes his machine, upset that it has failed him. Cleaning up his mess, he sweeps up the kids with the debris and deposits them in a garbage bag that he takes out to the sidewalk. The kids cut a hole in the garbage bag and slide down a giant blade of grass into the Szalinskis’ backyard. Nick calculates they are about a quarter of an inch tall, and the length of the sixty-four-foot backyard is equivalent to just over three miles at their current size. Diana returns home and announces she sold a house, while Wayne admits he failed his presentation. He tells Diana his thinking couch and the kids are missing, and she suspects Amy has taken Nick to the mall. Meanwhile, the boys climb a blade of grass for a better view and Nick falls into a flower. Little Russ goes to rescue him, but a swarm of bees descends, and the two are carried away by a bee. Wayne walks into the backyard, and Big Russ, from over the fence, pesters him about his un-mowed grass. The bee carrying Little Russ and Nick flies around Wayne’s head, and Wayne picks up Ron’s bat to swat at it. Taking notice of the bat in his hands, Wayne remarks to himself that Nick doesn’t own a bat, and glances up at the broken attic window. Deducing that Ron hit a baseball through the window, Wayne realizes that both his children and the Thompson kids must have gone to the attic, where they were shrunk by his machine. He checks the garbage on the sidewalk and discovers the hole in the bag. Assuming the kids are in the backyard, he uses a pair of stilts to avoid crushing them underfoot and begins searching with binoculars. When Nick and Little Russ are thrown off the bee, Russ decides they are still in the Szalinskis’ yard because the grass is overgrown. Wayne accidentally sets off the sprinklers and Nick, Little Russ, Amy, and Ron are reunited as they run from the deluge. Amy falls into a pool of mud and Little Russ dives in after her, dragging her out and administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation. As she comes to, Amy thanks Little Russ for saving her brother’s life, and Nick clarifies that Little Russ just saved Amy’s life as well. The kids find an old cookie that Nick dropped in the yard and begin to eat it, but a towering ant appears and runs them off. Determining that the ant is only a baby, Nick suggests they ride it back to the house. Luring the insect with a piece of cookie tethered to a stick, they rig a harness to its back and begin their ride. The Thompsons file a missing persons report with the police, just as Wayne informs Diane that he shrunk the children. The police stop by the Szalinskis but Wayne sends them away, assuring them that his children are in the backyard. Wayne rigs a device that allows him and Diane to hover just above the grass and search for the miniscule children with magnifying glasses. As night falls, Big Russ overhears the Szalinksis calling their children’s names and flicks his cigarette over the fence. The kids dodge the burning embers, then use them to create torches. Having set the baby ant free, they decide to spend the night in one of Nick’s toys, a plastic building block lying in the yard. Little Russ offers to lie on the ground as Amy nestles in the lower compartment of the building block. She asks why Little Russ never came to her house before, but he always thought she was too popular to notice him. Amy says she has been stupid and kisses him. Just then, a scorpion attacks and Amy, Little Russ, and Nick flee, but Ron is trapped inside the plastic block. The baby ant comes to Ron’s rescue, diverting the scorpion as the kids throw sticks at it. The scorpion limps away, but only after mortally injuring the ant. Having grown close to the insect, Ron bursts into tears as it dies. In the morning, Tommy arrives late to mow the lawn, and the kids initially mistake the disruption for an earthquake. They take cover in a hole burrowed by earthworms, but when Wayne and Diane yell at Tommy to stop mowing, he leaves the lawnmower hovered over a hole and the children are blasted out by the air stream. Quark runs to them and they grab onto his fur. Inside, the dog jumps on the kitchen table where Wayne is eating cereal. Nick falls into the cereal, and the other kids drop onto the table, screaming at Wayne to no avail. Wayne shovels Nick into his spoon, but the dog bites at his heel and he stops short, noticing the tiny Nick in his milk. He uses the magnifying glass to identify all the kids and they rejoice. Wayne takes them to the attic, where Nick plays charades to alert his dad that Ron’s baseball activated the laser. As Wayne reverses the shrinking process, Amy agrees to go to a school dance with Little Russ. The kids are zapped back to their normal sizes, and Diane assures Amy that she and Wayne have reconciled. The Thompsons are reunited as well, and Big Russ assures Little Russ he is proud of him. Later, on Thanksgiving, the two families share a huge turkey, blown up by Wayne’s machine, while Quark enjoys a giant dog bone, and Russ and Amy flirt across the table.\n\nLess"
