Manicur Assembly Hall. This event is free and open to the public.\n\nFilmmaker Kirby Dick created “The Invisible War,” a groundbreaking investigation about one of America’s most shameful secrets: the epidemic of rape within the U.S. military. The film paints a startling picture of the extent of the problem today; a female soldier in combat zones is more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire. The Department of Defense estimates there were a staggering 19,300 service members sexually assaulted in 2010 alone.\n\nThe film is presented in partnership with the Departments of Sociology, Philosophy, English, Theatre and Dance, Foreign Languages and Literature; Amnesty International; V-Day at FSU and the President’s Advisory Council Against Gender-Based Violence.\n\nFor more information, contact Dr. Julie E. Hartman at 301-687-3198 or jehartman@frostburg.edu., powered by Localist, the Community Event Platform",
