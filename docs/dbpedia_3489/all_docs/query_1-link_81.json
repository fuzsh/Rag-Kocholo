Thank you so much for your friendship, everyone. ðŸ˜»\n\nFine documentarian David Heilbroner (Stonewall Uprising and the tremendous The Newburgh Sting) is sucked into the biodoc universe with co-director Dave Wooley, and the results are serviceable for an icon who deserves the world, Dionne Warwick, so that's enough to get me to watch this decent feature, Don't Make Me Over.\n\nApparently one of the final films to be produced by CNN Films â€“ the takeover by Discovery had lead to innumerable cuts, including this entire documentary division â€“ thia People's Choice Award for Documentaries at TIFF delivers what you predict it will: a detailed personalâ€¦\n\nI'm a Dionne fan forever.

Most importantly, the film honours Warwick as a pioneer who ploughed through racial and cultural barriers to set a new precedent for black excellence.\n\nDonâ€™t Make Me Over is as by-the-numbers as documentaries get.
