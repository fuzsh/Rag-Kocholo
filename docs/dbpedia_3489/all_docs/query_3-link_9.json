        "text": "The only other documentary I've seen thus far from Kirby Dick is the highly entertaining This Film Is Not Yet Rated from 2006. His target in that film was the MPAA and he takes them apart in a comedic documentary that also features himself. For this film Dick stays behind the camera and let's people tell their stories in their own words backed up by nothing more then occasional statistics because there is nothing he could have added to make it anymore more powerful.\n\nHis target in this film is the US Military's judicial system, or lack there of, when it comes to cases of sexual assault. I use the word \"target\" because like Michael Moore, Dick's documentaries tend to…\n\ntrigger warning: rape\n\nvictims not only have to deal with the unimaginable pain of being raped and the lifelong ptsd that comes with it, but also the fight to be heard and taken seriously. being threatened that if you said anything, you’d be killed. your phone calls are taped. and even if you did, nobody in charge would care because they’re the perpetrators. more than 20% of women in the military have reported sexual assault. every single one was victim blamed and tossed aside. predators love to bring up the false accusation argument but the reality is, rapists almost never have to face any repercussions. the victims do. the victims deal with their lives and careers and reputations being destroyed all while the predators are still in power.\n\nPart of the December Project: Film #14\n\nKirby Dick's The Invisible War is a haunting documentary that displays the best of investigative journalism in film. Instead of going for his previous pop style displayed in his other documentaries, Dick instead lets the material do all the talking, and it's more powerful as a result.\n\nThe Invisible War documents interviews and statistics of sexual assault in the military. It addresses both sexes experiences with it, but mainly focuses on the issues women have experienced with it, which is my only complaint, but a silly one considering how traumatizing the experience is for women as it is.\n\nThe Invisible War's best moments are when it documents the interviews with survivors who detail their experience before, during, and after their various incidents. For others, it provides the usual documentary \"text shock\" moments, but the material here is well researched and looked at that it practically transcends the formulaic documentary structure.\n\nThis was a powerful and infuriating look into sexual abuse and rape in the United States military. According to the documentary 20% of women who join the military will be subject to this abuse and out of these convictions only a handful few will end up behind bars. This is just so wrong. Seeing the amount of times the victim is blamed and the case was dismissed and closed was sickening. It's just ridiculous and I cannot understand how someone can blame a rape victim and say she is guilty of adultery because the man she was raped by was married. And the scary part is that these are only the reported cases. Most people are not brave enough to come forward. All in all, this is a great documentary that brought to light a very important issue. I'm happy to hear some steps have been taken since this film was released to improve this whole situation.\n\nThe most telling moment in Dick's sharp documentary is the graphic at the end that says the survivors's case was dismissed because \"...rape is an occupational hazard of military service.\"\n\nThe most unfortunate element in a subject like this is the fact it will almost always be one-sided because no perpetrator is going to come forward, especially a military one, and be able to give a 360 degree angle. Simply put, the numbers show the problems at hand and something can hopefully be done to fix it."
