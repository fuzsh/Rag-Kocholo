One would expect the film to make headlines in Israel, but it didn’t. Moreover, no national public fund wanted to be involved with the production. In fact, almost no contemporary Israeli film deals with the conflict and the occupation; Tantura is the exception that confirms the rule. Israeli cinema used to be political, so what happened? When and why did the filmmakers and the public lose touch with reality? How and why did the local cinema become a world champion in repression?\n\nBio:\n\nAvner Shavit is one of the preeminent film critics in Israel. He has been covering both the local and international scenes for two decades and has been a consistent presence at major film festivals including Cannes, Venice, and Berlin. He is also a sought-after interviewer. His subjects have included Brad Pitt, Joon-Ho Bong, Michael Haneke, Isabelle Huppert, Wes Anderson and Mike Leigh, as well as a long roster of Israeli filmmakers. He holds a PhD from the New Sorbonne University in Paris, and is now a visiting professor at Wesleyan University.\n\nAvner Shavit will be present virtually.\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by Judaic and Near Eastern Studies Department, Film Studies Program, Comparative Literature Program, and the Institute for Holocaust, Genocide, and Memory Studies. It is free and open to the public."
