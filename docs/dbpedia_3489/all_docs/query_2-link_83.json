        "text": "GI Film Festival San Diego begins May 18, 2021\n\nSAN DIEGO, CA – April 16, 2021 – The GI Film Festival San Diego continues its commitment to featuring films which share the untold stories for, by and about military service members and veterans. Established in 2006 and brought to San Diego in 2015, the national military film festival is back to amplify underrepresented voices and remarkable stories. This year, the GI Film Festival San Diego takes a closer look at the female experience in the military, selecting “The Invisible Project,” a documentary style info-drama, to make its World Premiere as the festival’s opening night film.\n\n“The Invisible Project,” is directed by Pacifica J. Sauer, a filmmaker from Houston, Texas and a U.S. Navy veteran. The story follows the lives of four women as they work to change the public perception of women veterans in America. The documentary demonstrates that service matters and continues when you come home.\n\nRecently, the Marine Corps, the branch with the fewest number of women among the armed services, announced that its two bootcamps are now integrating and welcoming women into its ranks. Stories like “The Invisible Project” are being told during a time where women service members and veterans are starting to be acknowledged as military equals, deserving of the same celebration and recognition as their male counterparts.\n\n“The Invisible Project” is one of nine films in this year’s film festival that focuses on women in the military, including other stories like “Alene B. Duerk: The First Woman Admiral,” “Budding Creativity,” “Burger Day | A Short Story by Audrey di Faye,” “Charlotte Mansfield: a Woman Photographer Goes to War,” “Guide On,” “My War,” “REWIND,” and “Soldiers’ Stories from Iraq and Afghanistan: The Artist’s Process.” A Women Warriors film block will close out the festival on Sunday, May 23 with encore screenings of these select stories that celebrate the contributions of women service members over the years.\n\nThe festival moves online, video on demand options available\n\nThe 2021 GI Film Festival San Diego is set for May 18-23, 2021 and its virtual format provides the opportunity for attendees around the world to watch 38 films — the highest ever to be included — either live or on demand. The film lineup represents an array of documentaries, narratives, feature-length, and shorts focusing on additional themes including the Black military experience, the lasting impacts of the Normandy liberation, post traumatic growth, caregiver experiences, and a pandemic story. A full film schedule can be found below. The box office is now open for all online showtimes and video on demand (VOD) rentals at GIFilmFestivalSD.org.\n\nThe festival schedule will feature nightly online showtimes followed by post-screening discussions with filmmakers, film subjects, and subject-matter experts. These showtimes and discussions will provide audiences the experience to watch together and participate in the discussion in real time in a virtual auditorium – all from the safety and comfort of their homes.\n\nAdmission is $10 for general audiences and $8 for military, veterans, and students per screening. All proceeds support the festival. Each ticket holder will receive a unique URL and access code that will provide entry into the virtual auditorium on the GI Film Festival San Diego website. All Access passes are also available for $125 for festival-goers interested in attending every showtime and event, including the online Awards Celebration on Saturday, May 22. The All Access pass holders will also receive a Festival Fun Box, which will be mailed to them and will include a commemorative festival t-shirt, a festival button, a printed festival program, and other goodies like popcorn, chocolates, stationary, hand sanitizer, mask, and more. All Access passes must be purchased by May 7.\n\nIn addition to the virtual screenings, the films will also be available as a video on demand rental (VOD), beginning the day after its festival debut through May 26. This gives festival goers the flexibility to participate and enjoy the films whenever they choose within the rental window. Attendees will have the choice to either attend the online showtime for a synchronized watch and / or rent and watch on-demand. Each option requires a separate fee.\n\nThe history behind the largest military film festival in the U.S.\n\nWith San Diego’s multi-faceted military history and seven major bases between the Navy, Marines, and the Coast Guard, it’s only fitting that the region is home to the largest military film festival in the United States. Since its inception in 2015, the GI Film Festival San Diego has presented more than 170 films from international, U.S., and San Diego County, and has attracted thousands of attendees from various backgrounds. To help bridge the military-civilian divide, each film selected tells a compelling and unique story. The GI Film Festival San Diego challenges notions about what it means to serve and goes beyond one-dimensional depictions of veterans, service members, their caregivers and families.\n\nThe festival has also hosted several celebrities whose films had been presented at GIFFSD events, including documentary filmmakers Ken Burns and Ric Burns; actor and activist George Takei; actor Matthew Marsden; actor/producer/director Jeffrey Wright; and actor/director Brenda Strong.\n\nEvery year, films selected for the festival are curated by members of the GI Film Festival San Diego advisory committee. The film festival has active support from several military-related organizations, such as Project Recover, Workshops for Warriors, Travis Manion Foundation, Elizabeth Hospice, Challenged Athletes Foundation, Blue Star Families San Diego, American History Theatre, San Diego Military Family Collaborative, Armed Services YMCA, Southern Caregiver Resource Center, Courage to Call, and Joan & Art Barron Veterans Center at San Diego State University. Members of the advisory committee come from various military backgrounds, including veterans of the US Marine Corps, US Air Force, US Navy, US Army, US Coast Guard, as well as Air Force Reserves, and several military spouses, all who volunteer their time, talent, and expertise to ensure the festival provides an authentic view of the military experience and engages its audience through post-screening discussions.\n\nAbout GI Film Festival San Diego\n\nThe festival presents films and events for, by, and about military and veterans. The event is organized by KPBS and partners with the Film Consortium San Diego to present the Local Film Showcase. The festival is funded in part by a grant from the California Arts Council and is sponsored by National University and Scatena Daniels Communications. Additional support is provided by Task & Purpose.

These powerful eyewitness accounts from Steven Spielberg’s USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive®, share a cautionary tale and compelling reminder of what can happen when insidious hatred remains unchecked. Documentary Short / Directed by Vanessa Roth / 42 minutes / 2019 / USA\n\n“A Flash of Green” – After being wounded by the first explosions at Pearl Harbor, Charles McCandless fought in the most critical battles against Imperial Japan in World War II. Midway, Guadalcanal, Peleliu, and Iwo Jima, to name a few. When he got home, like many veterans, he never talked about it. When Sandra McCandless Simons first read her father’s memoir, its revelations inspired her to publish his book so that others could experience his unique perspective on the war in the Pacific. Using newly-discovered archive footage along with unique images from McCandless family scrapbooks, this film brings the vivid storytelling of Charles’ memoir to the screen, along with fresh insight and humanity to one of the most consequential military struggles in history. Documentary Short / Directed by Edward Nachtrieb / 41 minutes / 2020 / USA / San Diego Premiere / This film precedes “Liberation Heroes: The Last Eyewitnesses.”\n\nShorts Block | Closing Night Duo, Starting at 4:45 p.m. PDT\n\n“Actions Speak Louder than Medals – the Royce Williams Story” – On 18 November, 1952, Royce Williams found himself alone in an aerial duel against SEVEN superior, aggressively flown Russian MiGs. In the 38 minutes that followed, he bested at least four and just-barely brought his wounded F9F Panther back to the carrier….where he was promptly told that what had just happened “didn’t.” True to his values, Royce put the spectacular event out of his mind and continued his service, quietly, humbly — only telling his wife when informed (over FIFTY YEARS LATER) that the moment was now “unclassified.” Today, at age 95, Royce is finally (and somewhat bewildered by) the attention he deserves. But behind every great hero story is an even greater back-story proving out that the actions behind great deeds are their own reward.
