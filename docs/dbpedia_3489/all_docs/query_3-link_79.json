It was compiled to be shared... All I ask is that they consider sending a check to the History Center to help us out. That should be enough.\"\n\nFOREWORD\n\nIn this collection of information on the Sylvester family, many sources have been taken into account. The main source was the PLAINVIEW NEWS, which was the local newspaper of the time. It is from this document that most of the information in this collection was taken.\n\nAnother source, the George Dickman Diary, added a scope to the Sylvester daily life from the period of 1901 through 1912. The Dickman family lived just north of the E.L. Sylvester home on the other side of Broadway. Mr. Dickman ran the mens clothing store and was active in many community affairs. His family consisted of his wife Emma, sons Franklin & Alvin, and daughters Vera & Leona. The Dickman & Sylvester families frequented many of the same social circles.\n\nByrl Sylvesters personal letters from his war correspondence were discovered several years ago in a trunk in the Twin Cities. It is thought that they were from the Nettie Sylvester Caldwell household. These original letters were inserted on the dates they were written. Many of these letters were printed in the Plainview News (edited versions.). If you prefer to read these letters in a sequence when they were published rather than when they were written, the dates of the letters were noted to allow you to do so.\n\nNewspaper clipping from Rochester and Winona papers of the Sylvester Bank Scandal were among other items in the trunk found in the Twin Cities. When they were included in this collection they were noted as to distinguish them from PLAINVIEW NEWS items.\n\nThis project could go on forever. I have the prison records of the years E.L. Sylvester spent in Stillwater. This includes all the correspondence written to the warden concerning him as well as visitors and a record of all letters received by E.L. Someday I hope to add them to this collection.\n\nIve attempted to include a chart of family births and deaths. It is incomplete at this time. Perhaps it will be a catalyst for a more complete listing in the future.\n\nFor now, the time has come for me to halt this project. I hope it can be used by others to enjoy an unusual family saga. For me it has been an interesting search and I have enjoyed every moment. I hope it will serve as a valuable resource in the coming years.\n\nRon Manzow\n\nNovember 2001\n\n==========\n\nPAGE 1\n\nThe Sylvester Family\n\n-from the PLAINVIEW NEWS\n\nand other sources\n\n=== [ 1882 ] ===\n\nJune 10, 1882- Edwin Sylvester has been engaged to take the positioning the Plainview Bank vacated by Louis Champines removal to Fargo.

The loud but harmless thunder to the quite, zig zag, dangerous lightning. The unseen power of gravity that keeps man on earth, that prevents perpetual motion, and that draws the apple to the ground. The bright, invisible air produces effects more stupendous than the fury of the passing hurricane. The powerful work of evaporation and condensation so gently, noiselessly, for the most part so unobserved that comparatively few are aware of the magnitude of these operations. Silent forces continually surround the individual affecting him naturally for weal or for woe. His life and character are molded to a high or low standard according as he does or does not follow the guidances of his better nature. \"Silence is the perfect herald of Joy! I were little happy if I could say how much.\" But there are silent and secret forces interwoven in our natures. In no part of the constitution of the mind is the goodness of the great Designer more manifest than in material love, words cannot tell the numberless, nameless, impassioned sympathies that make the melody of a mothers tenderness\n\nJune 11, 1892- Miss Nellie Sylvester has a new safety bicycle and rides it nicely.

She was taken with a spasm at 5 oclock Wednesday morning from which time she never regained consciousness but was not relieved of her sufferings until deaths call summoned her to the land where care and endurance are unknown. It was a great shock to her husband, mother, brother & sisters as well as her numberless friends and acquaintances and especially more so on account of life passing away so sudden and not allowing the deceased to bid her fond relatives a last farewell.\n\nHattie Alice Sylvester was the oldest daughter of Mrs. M.A. Sylvester and was born in Plainview township, in the vicinity known as Woodland, on the 27th of March, 1864, and lived there until her mother moved with her family to this village where she spent the rest of her girlhood days. She made the acquaintance of and in June 1885 was married to Mr. A.P. Stafford who was then and with the exception of about 2 years 1889-1891, has since been a resident of this place. She was the mother of three children who are left to pick their way through the wide and troublesome world without a fond mothers guide and blessing.\n\nMrs. Stafford was a devoted Christian woman, a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church and was ever ready to lend a helping hand in church work or other Christian duties.

Sylvester and to \"represent our hobby\", we took our notebook and pencil and went. We found there about sixty others who had been \"bidden\" in the same way and who seemed just as curious to know what was to be done as we were.\n\nEach guest wore or carried some emblem or picture which we supposed to represent our chosen \"hobby\", and on arrival was given a number and his hobby was recorded. He was then furnished a card and pencil on which to write the name and number of other guests and their \"hobbies\", if we could guess them out. It was a new scheme to most of us, but it became very interesting from the start, so that a busier company of people we have seldom seen either at work or recreation than those there assembled.\n\nSome of the emblems were very plain while others were complex enough and even some of the plainest ones baffled the guesser by their simplicity.\n\nMr. F. L. Gilbert, the lumber man, had a couple of wooden toothpicks crossing each other fastened to the lapel of his coat, representing his well known hobby, fine lumber.\n\nMrs. F. L. Meachum wore a small card just over her watch on which was written the words, breakfast, dinner, supper- her hobby \"meals on time.\" Miss Nellie Hall carried a Parke Davis Calendar, showing a picture of a sick cat, representing Mew-sick, of course.\n\nF. J. Cornwell wore a tag on which was an original pencil sketch of a quiet fishing scene  a man seated in the shade on the bank of a stream, with rod and line, a good string of fish in the background and a lunch basket and little brown jug within easy reach.\n\nMiss Electa Sylvester wore a picture of a cart and some written music, which taken together made \"cartoons.\"\n\nMiss Lizzie Koenig kept us guessing all the evening on a picture of some elephants placing railroad ties, though trunks and ties are very suggestive of \"travel.\"\n\nC. D. Burchard wore a little hatchet, which might have had some reference to the famous George Washington incident, but so far as we heard no one consterned it that way. Charley said it represented \"Rheumatism\" because it attached the joints.\n\nWe mention these few of the fifty four hobbies represented just to give an idea of how the scheme worked. After refreshments were served, the list of hobbies was read with the correct answers for each and the guessers checked those which they had correctly written. The highest number claimed was forty-four by Miss Nellie Hall, to whom was awarded the prize  a bunch of carnations.\n\n==========\n\nPAGE 22\n\nIt is not necessary to say that all the guests enjoyed the evening, only we never worked so hard at a social entertainment in our lives.\n\nMarch 6, 1901, Wednesday- Mrs. M.

Fire Wednesday afternoon- Iroquois Fire. 550 killed in 10 minutes.\n\nElecta Sylvester killed in the Iroquois Fire in Chicago.\n\nThe Funeral of Miss Sylvester\n\nThe brief announcement in last weeks NEWS of the death of Miss Electa Sylvester in the Theatre fire in Chicago added pain and poignancy to the general sorrow over the great catastrophe.\n\nAs anticipated, E. L. Sylvester returned Saturday noon with the body and arrangements were accordingly made for the funeral services to be held Sunday afternoon at the Methodist Church and although every available foot of space was occupied even out to the side hall door, many turned away unable to gain admittance.\n\nThe services were conducted by the Pastor Rev. D. M. Johnson, assisted by Rev. W. D. King, a former pastor, and Rev. A. D. Adams of the Congregational Church, Rev. King preaching the sermon.\n\nA deep feeling of sadness pervaded the congregation, the speakers themselves being unable at times to proceed. It was not out of curiosity that hundreds of people came to the house of mourning bent to pay a tribute of respect and drop a tear at the bier of a departed friend, but everyone seemed to feel it a personal loss. It is seldom that grief at the death of one in the community is manifested so generally and sincerely. Qualities of mind and heart endured her to all who knew her and her straight forward manner to singleness and purpose commanded the respect and admiration of those whom she came in contact.\n\nMiss Electas influence on her pupils at Farmington, Minnesota and at Mayville, N. D., was very potent as she was constantly hearing directly and indirectly from them. In self sacrifice, modesty, beauty of Christian character, and sweet womanliness, she appealed to all who knew her. In the words of the president of the Mayville Normal School, she was a \"treasure.\"\n\nThe death of her aged widowed mother three years ago brought a saddening influence into her life which glorified her noble traits.\n\nAt the last meeting of the \"Travelers Club\", the ladys literary club, she recited that beautiful poem of Chas. McKay \"The Inquiry.\"\n\nThe casket was literally buried in a profusion of flowers wrought into beautiful and suggestive designs, the gifts of her companions and friends.\n\nThe following brief sketch was read from the pulpit at the close of the sermon.\n\nMiss Electa Anna Sylvester was born May 16, 1870 in Woodland and moved\n\n==========\n\nPAGE 30\n\nto this village in 1883, graduating from the high school in 1889 as salutatorian of her class. Following this she graduated from the Winona Normal School in 1891 and taught at Farmington, Minnesota in the public schools one year. The next two years Miss Electa attended the New England Conservatory of Music and studied Music and Art. She accepted a position of preceptors and teacher of music at the Mayville, N.D. school which position she was forced to give up on account of ill health at the end of two years. Since that time she has resided in Plainview, the past two or three years assisting her brothers in the Plainview Bank.\n\nThe remains were taken to Woodland for interment beside her father and mother where the glory of the rising sun, which she so much admired, shall each morning cast a halo of golden rays on the last resting place of the beautiful girl in Woodlands quiet sloping hillside (NOTE: The story was told that when E. L. Sylvester was called to Chicago to identify her body, her features were so mangled by the stampede she was caught up in that only a ring on her finger identified her.) [HOWDER NOTE: a"
