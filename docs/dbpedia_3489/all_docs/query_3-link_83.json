Although no longer an orphanage, its successor, the Harlem Dowling– West Side Center for Children and Family Services, maintains the principles of the women who organized nearly two hundred years ago the ﬁrst orphanage for children of African descent in the United States. Remarkably, the twenty-ﬁve founders fought against gender discrimination, ﬁnancial difﬁculties, and initial black resistance to house children who were either neglected, mistreated, or orphaned. Many of the women were the daughters, wives, or siblings of inﬂuential New Yorkers who made their reputation and wealth as businessmen, bankers, merchants, or entrepreneurs. Some were ardently antislavery, if not abolitionists. This study has several major themes that will be explored in its eight chapters. First, I will describe the efforts of the white women managers to procure a home for the children despite intense racial hostility and general civic disinterest. Although they would eventually receive ﬁnancial backing from some of Manhattan’s wealthiest citizens, including John Jacob Astor, Rufus Lord, Gerrit Smith, Gulian C. Verplanck, John Horsburg, Anson G. Phelps, Ann Jay, and Elizabeth and Sarah DeMilt, to name a few, the early years of the orphanage represented a ﬁnancial nightmare. Second, while the white female managers and their male advisers were dedicated to uplifting the black child, they harbored extreme paternalistic views that did not seek guidance from the African American community. The exception, of course, was the hiring of James McCune\n\nviii | p re fa ce\n\nSmith as the institution’s physician, a position he held for twenty years. The orphanage accepted material aid in the form of nonperishable goods, volunteer labor, and small ﬁnancial contributions from the black community, but it did not seek their advice and only grudgingly accepted it when it was given. Third, the evangelical and mainly Quaker founding managers sought to save the souls of their charges. Later, in the nineteenth century, their successors adopted a harsher, moralistic tone as they (and other similar institutions) became more bureaucratic and professional. Their objective was to uplift the poor in their care and, in a sense, to ‘‘rescue’’ their charges not only from the evils of the street but also from the perception that they, and not the black community, could best raise the children into responsible adulthood. Fourth, it was frank criticism in 1913 from W. E. B. Du Bois, editor of The Crisis, that highlighted the conﬂict between the orphanage and the community it served. It was not until 1939 that the white leadership decided that it was not enough simply to employ African Americans in menial positions; they also had to reach out and include them in the leadership of the institution. The orphanage’s ﬁrst black female trustee was elected in that year and was soon followed by others, including Jewish women and African American men. Fifth, it had become clear in the ﬁrst few decades of the twentieth century that the institution was an orphanage primarily in name, as most of the children under care were ‘‘half-orphans,’’ that is, neglected or delinquent children. It was during this period that the trustees introduced the cottage system as a means to accommodate children in a less-institutionalized manner. Boarding the children out led to a greater interaction with black churches and families. An antidiscrimination law in New York State pressured the reluctant trustees to accept white children in the late 1940s. It was at this time that it was decided to close the ‘‘orphanage’’ in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and ﬁnd boarding homes for all the children. The Colored Orphan Asylum survived several ﬁres, the nation’s ﬁnancial panics, wars, the Great Depression, and racial hostility so virulent that it led to the destruction of its Fifth Avenue building by a mob during New York’s July 1863 draft riots. Over ﬁfteen thousand children\n\np re fa ce | ix\n\nwere raised in the orphanage during the period under study, and throughout its history, letters and visits have revealed that hundreds if not thousands of ‘‘old boys and girls’’ have looked back with admiration and respect for the home that nurtured them throughout their formative years.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIn August 2002, the historian Gerald Horne was in New York researching a book. I was between research projects, and it was his suggestion that I check out the voluminous ﬁles on the Colored Orphan Asylum housed at the New-York Historical Society. I am indebted to many who helped to make this research possible. I want to thank the librarians of the National Archives; the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York Public Library; The New-York Historical Society; and the Rare Book and Manuscript Library of the University of Pennsylvania for their assistance. I thank the University of Pennsylvania for permission to cite from the Theodore Dreiser Papers and for the permission of the New-York Historical Society to quote from the records of the Manumission Society, the Association for the Beneﬁt of Colored Orphan Records, Children’s Aid Society Records, the ‘‘Riots, 1834’’ section of the American Historical Manuscript Collection, and the papers of Charles Chapin and Philip Hone. The New York Public Library, the Harlem Dowling–West Side Center for Children and Family Services, and the New-York Historical Society graciously allowed me to use photographs or illustrations in their possession. George Conliffe provided me with a photograph of himself as a member of the orphanage’s glee club. Mr. Victor Remer of the Children’s Aid Society provided me with assistance as he retrieved old volumes that delineated the names of children from the orphanage that were sent to the West. Janet Munch, the special collections librarian at Lehman College of the City University of New York, was extremely helpful with numerous leads that improved my level of research. I wish also to thank Arica Easely, a graduate student in history, and her cousin Fanny Crawford\n\nxii | a ck no wl ed gm en ts\n\nfor permission to quote from the unpublished recollections of Thomas Henry Barnes. Barnes, a former ‘‘inmate’’ of the orphanage, put a face to some of the events described in the annual reports or minutes. This study has been greatly improved by the frank criticisms of anonymous readers and the insightful suggestions of Timothy Hacsi and Janet Munch. Karen Franklin, the former director of the Judaica Museum of the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, in the Bronx, which occupies the former site of the Colored Orphan Asylum, showed enthusiastic interest in the project. Melba Butler, the former executive director of Harlem Dowling–West Side Center for Children and Family Services, the successor to the Colored Orphan Asylum, was very supportive of this project, and I thank her for putting me in contact with some of the institution’s alumni. I spent a pleasant June afternoon in 2003 dining and conversing with several alumni of the Colored Orphan Asylum/ Riverdale Children’s Association. Thanks to Madeline Davis Marshall, Gloria Torrence, Fitz Harvey, George Conliffe, Louis Eaddy, and Addison Eaddy for sharing their reminiscences of life at Riverdale during the early 1940s. I gained more insights into life at Riverdale when several of the alumni spoke eloquently about their experiences at an April 14, 2005, symposium at Lehman College. Louretta Smallwood De Haney, a nurse in the institution from 1940 to 1944, provided information about the institutional health care provided by the staff. Finally, I offer blessed thanks and deep appreciation for the ladies who confronted racial prejudice in their efforts to provide a safe and comfortable home for thousands of children of color who otherwise would have been subjected to the fate of life on the streets. I would like to thank my wife, Janette, for her love and support, and Aden Seraile, Garnet Seraile McKenzie, and Kristen Rich for their assistance with my still-evolving computer skills.\n\nAngels of Mercy\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction\n\nDespite the 1827 abolition of slavery in New York State, African Americans in Manhattan and elsewhere were treated with contempt and, at times, with cruelty by much of the state’s white population. Blacks in white churches were assigned to sit in separate pews or in high balconies crudely referred to as ‘‘nigger heaven.’’ They had to stand on the omnibuses or ride in separate cars. Public schools were segregated by race. Persons of color were not permitted in cabins on the Hudson River steamers but were relegated to the decks, regardless of weather conditions. African Americans, along with their few but vocal white supporters, were victims of violence. The ﬁrst half of 1834 in New York City was a troubled period of fraudulent elections, labor trouble, and bias against immigrants. Into this mix was added a virulent Negrophobia. Animosity against the small population of color broke out in three days of rioting in 1834. This riot would set the stage for the nineteenth century’s greatest racial outrage: the 1863 Irish draft riot. The instigators in 1834 were zealous in their efforts to kill or maim innocent African Americans and their abolitionist friends and to prevent racial progress through alliances with white progressives. Raising the taboo of interracial sex, James Watson Webb, the racist editor of the Courier and Enquirer, accused abolitionists of supporting race mixing, a charge later vehemently denied by David Ruggles, a prominent black abolitionist. The riot began on July 4, when hecklers interrupted an integrated celebration, which was rescheduled for July 7. On that date, Chapel’s Sacred Music Society declared that the Chatham Street Chapel, which the music society had leased two nights a week, was reserved for them.\n\n2 | i nt ro du ct io n\n\nAngry that blacks were in ‘‘their stalls’’ (even though on that date the chapel was free for any taker), the riot began, according to the Courier and Enquirer, which alleged that Negroes had physically harmed a peaceful gathering of whites. Afterward, vengeful whites sacked the home of the abolitionist Arthur Tappan, burning his furniture and damaging his silk store. Arthur Tappan’s brother Lewis suffered a similar fate when the mob broke into his home and burned his furniture in the street. The former mayor Philip Hone noted that the mob, encouraged that neither the police nor the military could ﬁre upon them unless ordered to do so by the governor, grew larger. The enraged mob attacked the home and church of Dr. Samuel H. Cox and invaded and destroyed furniture and the organ at St. Philip’s Episcopal Church, fueled by a rumor that the black priest, Peter Williams, had ofﬁciated at an interracial marriage. Eyewitnesses provided chilling accounts of the rioters’ behavior. Fifty-ﬁve communications were sent to Mayor Cornelius W. Lawrence. An undated note from Miles Osborne indicated that he had mingled with the rioters and believed that their actions were motivated by the anti-American remarks of the Englishman William Farren, the stage manager at the Bowery Theater. Osborne warned that the mob intended to attack the police and release prisoners. Other notes warned of attacks against the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, at the corner of Leonard and Church Streets, and the African Free School No. 4, at Jefferson Street and East Broadway. Individuals who were married to white women were targeted for attacks, as were black merchants. Philip Hone recorded in his diary that the riot ended when the police and several thousand uniformed militia and private citizens worked to preserve the peace on the evening of July 12.1 The outrageous behavior of the mob against blacks, with their homes and institutions as targets, caused much consternation among people of color. Antiblack riots in Philadelphia, Rochester, New York, and in several communities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania prompted the delegates to the Fifth Annual Convention for the Improvement of the Free People of Color in the United States to adopt a resolution afﬁrming ‘‘that the Christian forbearance practiced by [blacks] during\n\ni nt ro du ct io n | 3\n\ntheir persecution . . . merits the praise and respect of the whole Christian world; and is a most successful refutation of the proslavery argument advanced in this country.’’ The resolution concluded that colored Americans had displayed by ‘‘their peace, quietude and humility’’ that they were better persons than their agitators.2 The riot added more fuel to the simmering ﬁre of Negrophobia in New York City. The Castigator and New-York Anti-Abolitionist newspaper continued to accuse abolitionists of race mixing. Equating an integrated society with amalgamation, the rabid editor lamented, ‘‘is it possible that we can ever be willing to see our daughters promenading our streets, arm in arm with a thick lipped negro . . . or see our sons . . . sauntering . . . arm in arm with one of those kitchen appendages, a negro wench, because Arthur Tappan has said they were as good as white women.’’ The editor bluntly condemned the unspeakable horror of sexual relations between a ‘‘strapping buck nigger . . . with the delicate and reﬁned white female.’’3 The antiabolitionist feeling was so strong that many whites actively hunted fugitive slaves who escaped to New York. In their eagerness to capture runaways, they were not above kidnapping free men and women to send to work in Southern cotton, tobacco, and rice plantations. Progressive New Yorkers responded in 1835 by forming the New York Committee on Vigilance. Organizers included William Johnston, David Ruggles, Robert Brown, George Barker, and James W. Higgins. Their diligence prevented the kidnapping of 335 persons in 1837.4 It was in this context of racial hostilities that the Colored Orphan Asylum (COA) was established by white women in New York City. Blacks in Manhattan, with their small population and limited resources, tried diligently to advance through self-reliance. They had, since 1800, organized mutual relief and benevolent societies, churches, schools, and newspapers, but the paucity of educated individuals and the lack of individual and collective wealth made difﬁcult the task of speaking for themselves in matters of civil and political rights. Mutual relief and benevolent societies provided temporary relief to the ills suffered by the poor, but their lack of sufﬁcient resources prompted benevolent whites to establish an orphanage on their behalf. A large building, a matron, staff members, and ﬁnancial supporters were\n\n4 | i nt ro du ct io n\n\nneeded to run an orphanage. These could be provided by white women who were culturally programmed to be nurturers. Their control of an institution that served the needs of black youth met the day’s societal standards of white paternalism. Without the involvement of black leadership in the day-to-day operations of the orphanage, the women avoided scandalous talk of social equality—or worse, amalgamation. This study is an examination of the effort of a group of white women who, aided sporadically by limited ﬁnancial support from African Americans, labored for over a century to maintain a home for black youth, ﬁrst orphans and then also half-orphans and neglected, dependent, and delinquent children. The COA, the ﬁrst in the nation for African American youth, was similar to other orphanages in the nation. Some orphanages cared for only Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish youth. In contrast, the COA housed blacks and occasionally American Indians until 1944, when a state law required them also to accept white applicants. Timothy Hasci describes nineteenth-century orphanages’ missions as ‘‘to clothe, house and educate children; provide them with speciﬁc moral and religious code; and otherwise care for children until they could be indentured; placed in a family, or returned to their homes.’’ The COA did not deviate from this pattern, although very few children were indentured to African American homes, and it was not until the early twentieth century when efforts were made to place them in the homes of black foster or adoptive parents.5 Hasci notes that orphanages were either protective, isolating, or integrative asylums. ‘‘Protective and integrative [asylums] hoped to act as temporary replacement for children’s own parents with what they considered superior parenting and socialization tactics,’’ he noted.6 For much of its history, the COA acted as an isolating institution. It kept the children inside the building, provided educational and religious studies, made it difﬁcult for families to visit, and indentured the children to white families in the hopes of making them more ‘‘American’’—meaning Anglo-Saxon—in culture and values. The managers viewed most of their charges as coming from a primitive culture rife with superstition, vice, and immorality. Despite this patronizing attitude, the African American community allowed them to care for their children, as the alternative—the almshouse—was not an option, with its depraved,\n\ni nt ro du ct io n | 5\n\nmentally disturbed, and abusive inhabitants. Later, like other orphanages, the COA became an integrative facility, sending its children out to school, church, parks, and playgrounds. Like other early orphanage managers, the women who started the COA were elite benevolent women and evangelical perfectionists who wanted to ‘‘eradicate rather than ameliorate social ills.’’ The earlier founders of the COA came from upper-class families and were the wives and daughters of prominent New Yorkers such as Chief Justice John Jay.7 Middle- and upper-class nineteenth-century women found establishing asylums to be a practical outlet for their desire to be part of a broader world. They were able to leave the home, where they were nurturers, to go into an asylum, which also was a home, without facing condemnation for ‘‘desexing’’ or ‘‘unsexing’’ themselves. Many of the earlier founders of the COA came from homes where the heads of the household were members of the New York Manumission Society. These families had an interest—albeit a paternalistic one—in assisting blacks. This interest certainly made it easier for the women to work to save black youth. The twenty-ﬁve women who founded the COA came from predominantly upper-class homes. Anne M. Boylan’s research indicates that 34.9 percent of the founders came from homes headed by merchants or manufacturers. The others came from homes where the head of the household was a clergyman, artisan, lawyer, judge, shopkeeper, or physician.8 It is not surprising that 67.7 percent of the founders were members of the Society of Friends, or Quakers, as they were commonly known. Presbyterians, Protestant Episcopalians, and Methodist Episcopalians accounted for 10.7 percent each. None of the original twenty-ﬁve founders belonged to the Baptist, Reformed Dutch, Unitarian, Congregationalist, or Roman Catholic church. The Quakers’ strong antislavery beliefs explain their high number. A majority, 55.8 percent, of the original members were married. Unlike single women, they had their husbands as a source of economic security. The founding managers of the COA were mature women, with a median age of forty at time of joining. Boylan’s research shows that 30 percent were in the 30–39 age range, 23.3 percent in the 40–49 age group, 26.65 percent in the 50–59 age category, 13.3 percent in the 20–29 age range, and 3.3 percent were\n\n6 | i nt ro du ct io n\n\nteenagers or sixty years or older. Working on behalf of black children made easier the transition of leaving the home (if only for periods of the day), because social evolution deemed them superior to the black children in their charge. Their asylum work provided them with a sense of authority and legitimacy that allowed them to escape societal roles that deﬁned true women as those ‘‘who embraced piety, purity, submissiveness and domesticity.’’9 The women managers of the COA were able to acquire corporate status, thanks to the successful effort of the Society for the Relief of Poor Widows and Small Children, who acquired it in 1802. Incorporation permitted the managers, as an organization, to have legal rights that none of them could claim individually, ‘‘including the right to own property, bring legal suits, indenture minor children, invest funds, and control wages.’’ The married ofﬁcers ‘‘received concrete and often surprisingly broad powers that were theoretically restricted to male or unmarried female citizens.’’ Despite these gains, the women did not abuse these rights nor deny masculine involvement. Male advisers counseled them on ﬁnancial matters, offering suggestions to invest in stocks and bonds as well as in real estate. These men were involved in banking or Wall Street brokerage houses. This dependence on male ﬁnancial advice allowed for ‘‘masculine authority into feminine realms devaluing women’s money management skills; and separating women leaders’ vocational work more fully from home duties.’’ As ﬁnances were a ‘‘man’s business,’’ women’s dependence upon his advice kept them from desexing themselves.10 This study is an examination of the Colored Orphan Asylum from its founding in 1836 until 1946, when it closed its building in Riverdale (the Bronx), New York. During that period, it was aided by prominent New Yorkers such as John Jacob Astor; John Jay and his daughters, Anna and Maria; Cornelius V. S. Roosevelt; Theodore Roosevelt Sr.; Frederick Douglass; James McCune Smith; Eleanor Roosevelt; Lena Horne; Bill ‘‘Bojangles’’ Robinson; and others. Their generosity helped to care for ﬁfteen thousand children before the Colored Orphan Asylum, later known as the Riverdale Children’s Association, closed its doors and began to operate as a foster care agency.\n\ni nt ro du ct io n | 7\n\nDuring its ﬁrst century of operation, the COA maintained a paternalistic relationship with black New York, accepting their ﬁnancial support but not permitting them to advise them on how best to serve the African American community. It was not until 1939 that the management deemed it essential to add an African American woman as a trustee and to work more closely with Harlem’s religious and civic leaders.\n\n1\n\nThe Early Years, 1836–42\n\nAlas! I am an orphan Boy, With naught on earth to cheer my heart; No father’s love, no mother’s joy No kin nor kind to take my part. My lodging is the cold, cold ground, I eat the bread of charity; and when the kiss of love goes round, there is no kiss, alas.\n\nAs the New York Orphan Asylum, founded in 1809, admitted only Caucasian children, it came as no surprise when Quaker women established the nation’s ﬁrst orphanage for children of color.1 Originally slaveholders, in 1774 New York Quakers placed sanctions on members who bought and sold slaves. In 1778, they removed slaveholders from their congregations.2 The origin of the Colored Orphan Asylum has several versions, inﬂuenced by the passage of time, boastful pride, and marketing objectives. An original version noted that in 1834 two Quaker women, Anna H. Shotwell and her niece, Mary Murray, chanced upon two dirty and unkempt children at play under the watchful eye of a black woman. Upon learning that they had been abandoned by fugitive slave parents, the two gave the woman a few dollars to care for the children. Several days later, they found that the kind woman had four additional children under her care, having received enough funds to tend to their needs. This led the two Quakers to consider opening a home for homeless children of color. Later, Leslie Skiddy Parker noted that ‘‘a white\n\nt he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 | 9\n\nwoman . . . had taken [the two children] out of jail and not knowing what to do with them,’’ turned them over to the Quaker women, who took them home. This version places the kindness on the part of a sympathetic white woman instead of crediting a black woman for her generosity. Anna Shotwell and Mary Murray were both extraordinary women. Twenty-eight-year-old Anna, the daughter of William Shotwell, a member of the New York Manumission Society, was a staunch opponent of slavery. Anna had decided at age twelve never to have an African American servant or laborer as long as slavery existed. Eighteen-year-old Mary Murray, the granddaughter of John Murray Jr., the long-time treasurer of the Manumission Society, ‘‘was a person of a strong and dominant will [who possessed] a good deal of executive ability united with a great persistence of purpose.’’3 The Colored Orphan Asylum was formed on November 26, 1836, in the home of William Shotwell. The founders decided upon the name ‘‘colored’’ in deference to the community’s sensibilities. Many prominent men of color resented the white-led American Colonization Society’s assertion that the black person’s destiny was in Africa. These men, who had been born in the United States and had a mixed AfricanEuropean ancestry, preferred the nomenclature ‘‘colored’’ over ‘‘African,’’ which they believed better identiﬁed them as Americans and not Africans in exile. The founders of the COA, pioneers in child welfare for youth of color, included Anna Shotwell, Mary Murray, Eunice Mitchel, Sarah C. Hawxhurst, Sarah Shotwell, Hanna L. Murray, Mary Shotwell, Eleanor Shotwell, Phebe Mott, Elizabeth Little, Abby Ann Cook, Stella Tracy, Ernestine Lord, Jane U. Ferris, Sarah Underhill, Margaretta Cock, and Sarah Hall. A board of twenty-ﬁve female managers and ﬁve male advisers was quickly organized. The Association for the Beneﬁt of Colored Orphans in the City of New York immediately received the assistance of prominent New Yorkers including Robert C. Cornell, Charles King, William F.

Throughout the nineteenth century, a who’s who of New York philanthropists, merchants, artisans, and bankers would befriend the institution. But it\n\n10 | t he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42\n\nAnna Shotwell, Hannah Shotwell, and Mary Murray. (Collection of The New-York Historical Society.)\n\nt he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 | 11\n\nwould be years before the Colored Orphan Asylum would have ﬁnancial security, and even then it would be sporadic, as increased enrollment would lead to deﬁcits. The ﬂedging organization provided women with an opportunity to display leadership. As married women in the early nineteenth century were not allowed to own property in their own right, the managers noted in their constitution that ‘‘the husbands of any married woman who is or may be a member . . . shall not be liable for any loss occasioned by the neglect or malfeasance of his wife’’ but would be accountable if he received money from his wife, a member of the corporation. Thus, the women were able to ‘‘buy, sell, and invest property and to sign binding contracts.’’ In time, they would learn how to lobby legislators for municipal or state funds.4 In early 1837, after no one would rent them space to care for black children, the managers decided to purchase a home. After receiving one thousand dollars from the Lindley Murray Estate, the managers made a three-thousand-dollar down payment with a sixthousand-dollar mortgage on the late Dr. Alexander Murray’s two-story white cottage, located on Twelfth Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in lower Manhattan. In June, eleven children rescued from the cellar of an almshouse were placed in the home. Children who resided in almshouses, as noted by the commissioner of almshouses, lived in conditions of ‘‘neglect and ﬁlth and putrefaction, and vermin,’’ with ‘‘bedding [that] was alternately used by the sick, dying and the healthy.’’ The children had to walk or be carried to their new home, because no carriage drivers would take them. The managers also started a school for black youth, as there was none in their vicinity. Stafﬁng the house with a black matron, a teacher, and an assistant, the women depended upon the kindness of family, friends, and strangers to survive. Donations of blankets, utensils, beans, potatoes, turnips, cabbages, wheat ﬂour, cloth, andirons, and shovel tongs aided them in the beginning.5 The founders faced the arduous task of caring for orphans with considerable determination. As noted by Christine Stansell, they engaged in ‘‘corrective domesticity,’’ employing rules and regulations to teach cleanliness, religiosity, and morality—lessons they believed that the parents had failed to impart. Unfortunately, they did not deem it\n\n12 | t he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42\n\nnecessary to consult with the black community. By not seeking their advice in matters relating to cultural differences between the races, this negligence led to a fractious relationship between the managers and the African American community of New York City.6 The ﬁrst year of operation was nearly a ﬁscal disaster. The ﬁnancial panic of 1837 led to widespread destitution, hampering the efforts of private and public relief agencies to alleviate the problems of the poor. The COA desperately needed funds to purchase winter coal and meat and to make payments on the mortgage. Treasurer Mary Murray faced the ﬁnancial situation with distress. One day, she walked the streets unsuccessful in her solicitation for funds. She feared to return home without cash or pledges. But upon her return, a package was delivered that contained the exact amount needed for expenses.7 Believing that theirs was the work of Providence, the managers continued in their mission to house an oppressed group of children. Different circumstances could have easily ended the nascent organization’s effort to serve children, as the ﬁnancial burden would have overwhelmed the ladies. Instead, the work continued with hopes and prayers that further ﬁnancial assistance was forthcoming. Their highly anticipated ﬁnancial break came in 1837, but at a price that caused friction with the city’s African American leadership. William Turpin’s will had provided that two hundred shares of the capital stock of the Mechanics Bank, valued at $1,175.00, be given to a society or institution to ‘‘promote the education and welfare of the descendants of Africa.’’8 The trustees of the William Turpin legacy were divided over whom should receive the funds. Israel Corse, a supporter of the Colored Orphan Asylum, controlled the distribution of the funds, but the trustees Arthur Tappan and Simeon S. Jocelyn favored the Phoenix Society as the worthy recipient. The Phoenix Society, established in 1833 for the purpose of establishing a manual labor school, had been led to believe by one of the legatees that they would receive the money. Expecting funds, they overspent and were forced to give up their school room, lacking three hundred dollars for the rent. To complicate matters, they argued that Turpin had been an ofﬁcer of their society and would have wished to have his funds support a black school. The Colored American newspaper castigated both the trustees\n\nt he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 | 13\n\nof the Turpin legacy and the ladies of the Colored Orphan Asylum. Its editor, Samuel Cornish, criticized the appointment of white trustees ‘‘of every fund left to, or for the beneﬁt of colored people.’’ He accused them of dallying so long that they died before the funds got disbursed, which led to missing funds. Cornish lamented that six to eight thousand dollars was going to the Colored Orphan Asylum, which was not ‘‘an institution of learning, but rather a branch of the almshouse.’’ The money belonged to the Phoenix Society, he concluded, because ‘‘we have ﬁve or six young men of established piety and talent, seeking a preparation for usefulness, and who are by sheer necessity driven from the seminary of learning.’’ Cornish bitterly added that ‘‘the ladies knew when they applied for the funds that the Phoenix Society [had claims on it], and of the strong probability that it was intended solely for that society.’’ A compromise was suggested in July 1838, when Cornish and Simeon S. Jocelyn met with the COA’s advisers William F. Mott, Robert Murray, and Dr. James Proudﬁt and requested eight hundred dollars from the Turpin legacy. An agreement was reached the following month, whereby the Colored Orphan Asylum gave four hundred dollars to the Phoenix Society in exchange for the latter relinquishing all further claims upon the orphanage and trustees of the Turpin legacy. The ladies indicated that the funds represented their empathy for the disappointment experienced by the Phoenix Society.9 The ladies wanted to avoid a confrontation with Samuel Cornish and the Colored American. As the only African American newspaper in New York City (and the third in the nation), it wielded signiﬁcant inﬂuence among its readership, an audience that the Colored Orphan Asylum coveted for support. In April 1837, the managers informed Cornish of their need to have the colored community assist with ‘‘donations of . . . furniture, clothing or bedding.’’ Even before the Turpin controversy, the Colored American had objections to the orphanage. Cornish opposed ‘‘separate institutions for colored youth, as being contrary to the principles of the Bible, and at war with the best interest of our colored population.’’ He concluded that God would deny His blessings to those who maintained separate race institutions which reﬂected ‘‘the spirit of slavery [and] contributed more largely to the persecution, and neglect of our colored population, than all the politics of the land.’’\n\n14 | t he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42\n\nThis view was consistent with an earlier editorial’s denunciation of prejudice. He vowed to use the press to speak against the evils of racism ‘‘in thunder tones, until the nation repent and render to every man that which is just and equal.’’10 Despite this sentiment and his anger over the Turpin controversy, Cornish made a remarkable turnaround that helped to smooth the way for the Colored Orphan Asylum to better communicate with the African American community, perhaps preventing it from further alienation from the community it sought to serve. In late October 1837, Cornish visited the orphanage, which led to a description of the roomy yard as ‘‘suited to the innocent gambols of the dear parentless children.’’ Cornish declared that the blessings of ‘‘the fatherless and the widow abide upon [the founders],’’ for the asylum ‘‘claims our prayers, its founders claim our little contributions in clothing and provisions.’’ The impressed editor requested that the managers establish a monthly visiting day for the black community to bring money, clothing, and provisions or to mend or make clothes for the children. A year later, Cornish enthusiastically wrote that the female managers were worthy of the name Christian and that prejudice would be eliminated if more emulated them. They deserved immortality for acting in the image of Jesus by feeding hungry children, clothing them, and caring for them in sickness. ‘‘Go on good ladies, the Benefactor of the universe will be with you,’’ he concluded.11 The ofﬁcers of the Colored Orphan Asylum had much to achieve during that ﬁrst year. Led by First Directress Martha Codwise, who had over twenty years experience managing charitable organizations; Second Directress Sarah C. Hawxhurst; Secretary Anna Shotwell; and Treasurer Mary Murray, they sought, in addition to fundraising, to stabilize the home. Staff turnover was common in the early years, because of low salaries or incompetence. They needed a matron and a teacher for the growing school, which had forty day students, until two schools for colored children opened in the area. They also had to consider the request of the community to accept half-orphans into the institution, a decision they decided in the afﬁrmative. (Early nineteenth-century orphanages all were faced with the decision to accept more than full orphans, as contagious diseases and wretched living\n\nt he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 | 15\n\nconditions for the poor left many families without both parents. The Boston Female Asylum, founded in 1800, accepted both half-orphans and full orphans, but the New York Orphan Asylum, founded six years later, sent inmates who had a living parent to the almshouse. The Roman Catholic orphanage in Manhattan initially accepted only full orphans.) Caring for more children demanded increased funding, but the almshouse commissioners turned down the managers’ request for funds, because the commissioners did not feel obligated to ﬁnance the education of black children who were not ‘‘inmates’’ of the almshouse. The city’s Common Council also refused to render funds to the managers, a decision that Leslie Harris argues stemmed from their reluctance to encourage an alliance between blacks and progressive whites in the aftermath of the 1834 riots. The Common Council made this decision even though the orphanage relieved the city of providing for children removed from the almshouse.12\n\nAdmission\n\nThe decision to admit half-orphans led the managers to formulate criteria for admission. Children came from the almshouse, were brought to the orphanage by relatives or kind strangers who took pity on helpless children, or came on their own in desperate search for food and lodging. The managers decided not to turn away those children who were abandoned or neglected. In November 1837, the managers revised their constitution to give preference to orphans while reserving the right to admit half-orphans at their discretion. Six half-orphans were admitted that year after the surviving parent agreed to pay a monthly fee of two dollars. Over the years, some children would be admitted from the Colored Home (which was founded in 1839 by Anna Jay, Mary Shotwell, and Anne Mott as a home for both the aged and abandoned children).13 By October 1837, the small asylum on Twelfth Street housed ﬁfteen children. Five-year-old Benjamin Matthews came from the almshouse, but, like many others, he died of consumption. Jacob Beckett Lee, born in the South in about 1829, was brought to the asylum in October by\n\n16 | t he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42\n\nMaria Welk. His mother, Marie Lee, had died of cholera four years earlier. His father, whose name was unknown, was apprehended trying to escape from slavery. Jacob was apprenticed on April 19, 1839, as a house servant, but he absconded a year later. The fate of the approximate ten-year-old is unknown. His case was typical of many of the children admitted into the institution. Friends or even strangers cared for orphans or abandoned children until dire circumstances forced them to turn to the almshouse, the Colored Home, or the COA for relief. Not all half-orphans were accepted. Children who led a vagrant life and acquired evil inﬂuences were denied admission, out of the fear that they would be undesirable associates of other children.14 In November 1837, the managers admitted the Rawle children— the siblings Jeremiah and Adeline and their cousin Willy—all former slaves, even though they were not orphans. Minerva Rawle, the mother of Jeremiah and Adeline, was freed in Virginia by her owner. They and about forty other freed persons arrived destitute in New York City. The father was still held in bondage. Minerva, who was described by the managers as ‘‘vicious and ignorant [with] an ungovernable temper,’’ consented to their admission. The siblings were eventually indentured, but Willy died on February 19, 1841, of ‘‘disease of the bowels.’’15 Soon after, the managers decided not to make the admission of freed slave children a precedent, but circumstances did not allow them to honor this pledge. On October 15, 1838, John Tomata, who was born in about 1830 in Cuba, entered the United States with Ann Bridget Dulcie, who turned him over to the Committee of Vigilance of the Anti-Slavery Society. They brought him to the orphan asylum, where he soon contracted consumption. Knowing very little English, he uttered in his dying moments, ‘‘no father, no mother,’’ before death claimed him on January 13, 1839. Like others, he was buried in the Presbyterian burial ground at the corner of Houston and Chrystie Streets. Another foreignborn admission was Henry Bushman, whose parents were killed in the Sixth Kafﬁr War, 1834–1835, against the Xhosa people of Cape Colony in South Africa. A trader brought the boy to a Mr. Chase, the American consul, who delivered him to the orphanage on June 13, 1848, with an agreement to pay his board. The ten-year-old, afﬂicted with cholera, cried about his inability to pray as he knew only ‘‘our Father’’ and\n\nt he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 | 17\n\nfeared that his ignorance would deny him salvation. A moved Anna Shotwell wrote that ‘‘he was a remarkably innocent and guileless boy, yet such was his humility, with the sense of innate depravity.’’ Several interesting admissions occurred in 1858. On November 21, the offspring of a relationship between a slave woman and her owner was admitted to the orphanage by her guardian, Elvira Bowden. The managers gave the Kentucky-born girl the name Harriett Beecher Stowe, in honor of the author of Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Another slave child, Mary Davis, was born in Nashville, Tennessee. The mother was paying for the freedom of her two daughters, Mary and Harriett, but was two hundred dollars in arrears when the owner died, which led her to fear that the heirs would demand the children to cover the payment. It is not known how the children escaped bondage, but they ended up in Buffalo, where Maria Marshal of that city brought them to the asylum. Mary was indentured in Connecticut but ended up in Nebraska. The record’s last notice of Mary was an 1860 notation: ‘‘last account of Mary was a sad one, gone to destruction.’’16 George Lewis lived with some degraded people who forced him to beg. The orphan was admitted on January 24, 1838, without the permission of his ‘‘family.’’ George was so delighted with his new surroundings that he requested a new name. Since the managers did not believe that George Lewis was his true name, they called him Mott Cornell, after two of their advisers, William F. Mott and Robert C. Cornell. It was not uncommon for the managers to give admitted children unusual or humorous names. An illiterate and abused child whose parents were unknown was brought to the orphanage by a manager, a Mrs. North, after the girl came to her home begging. Mrs. North named her Mary Ann Topsy, because she was ‘‘lively [and] communicative’’ and resembled the character ‘‘Topsy’’ in Uncle Tom’s Cabin.17 The COA’s mission was the admission of children of color, but while they admitted biracial children, they were perplexed by the admission of Jane Guise, who was placed in the institution at age three by her mother. By age ﬁve, the child’s complexion was indistinguishable from that of a white person. Since she possessed no visible African features ‘‘which could prevent her enjoying the privileges afforded to the white population,’’ the managers wanted to send her to a white\n\n18 | t he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42\n\norphanage. The mother refused and continued to pay weekly board until Jane was indentured. The managers, in their understandable haste to improve the life of a child who could pass for white, thoroughly misunderstood the racial pride that some African Americans possessed, regardless of hue.18 Not all admissions were neglected or abused children. Benjamin Africanus, who was ‘‘quite forward in his studies,’’ came from a middle-class family. His father, the Rev. Edward Africanus, was a schoolteacher and community activist in Flushing, New York. His parents died of consumption, which resulted in Benjamin’s admission, but his unhappiness in the asylum led to a discharge to his uncle just a few weeks before the boy died of fever. The admission of Catharine Louise Smith was one that was replicated over the years. Her father died of fever, and her mother Julia, a Boston resident, agreed to pay a boarding fee. The admission records noted that Julia (no maiden name was provided, but she was either Julia Murray, Julia Jackson, or Julia Moore) was ‘‘one of our ﬁrst children belonging to the institution.’’ One of the asylum’s most unique admissions was that of nine-year-old Charles Carter, whose father had deserted the family in 1867. Charles’s mother, Mary, was the great granddaughter of Elizabeth Freeman, who had successfully sued her owner for freedom in 1781 in Massachusetts, helping to set the movement to abolish slavery in that state two years later. (A great-grandson, Willie, was better known as W. E. B. Du Bois.)19 Despite admitting children of former slaves, the managers decided, so as not to antagonize potential supporters, to remain ‘‘entirely independent of the exciting questions that have lately agitated the public mind, in relation to the colored race.’’ Twenty-three children were in the home at the end of 1837.20 The increased requests for admissions resulted in the admissions committee requesting applicants to provide the name, age, place of birth, parents’ names, and other relevant information of prospective inmates. Relevant information was necessary, because some offered false information. John Philip Bennet was admitted as an orphan on February 23, 1838. Shortly afterward, a man arrived claiming to be John’s father, which led to the child running away from the asylum.\n\nt he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 | 19\n\nThe man, whom the admission record described as having ‘‘depraved character,’’ was his biological father and intended to place him in the House of Refuge. The young boy’s character was also ‘‘depraved.’’ When John was found, he was bound out to the Rev. Dr. William W. Phillips, the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, located at 5 Wall Street. The Bennet ﬁasco made it clear that the managers had to develop controls not only for admission but for interactions between the matron and parents or guardians. It was decided in May 1838 that ‘‘at least one of the committee of admission to be present at the asylum when a child is received or provide another manager to supply her place.’’ It was further decided that a manager be present to inform parents or guardians that the matron had the support of the institution and that the use of abusive language would be grounds to deny visiting privileges. Visiting was limited to the ﬁfth day of each summer month, from 3 to 6 p.m., and from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the winter. Children were not permitted to go past the building’s front door without the matron’s permission. While it appeared on the surface that the managers simply wanted to manage visitations to a bustling building where different forces competed for time and space, the controls actually represented a deeper power struggle. The white reformers were dedicated to imposing their moral standards on children who, they believed, falsely or not, had been corrupted by undesirable elements in the black community. The managers judged that fewer contacts with this community prevented the children’s return to a vicious life, even if it meant that contact with relatives or guardians was kept to a minimum. Of course, some of the ‘‘abusive’’ language from family or guardians was a result of the white women’s interference with relatives or friends who were unwilling to put up with the scheduled visiting hours or days. Although many institutions limited parental visits or sought to isolate children from depraved members of the community, the white-black dynamics of the COA exacerbated the situation. Not all parents or guardians were depraved in character, and resentment developed over the blanket charge.21 The managers’ desire to assist as many children as possible and concerns about maintaining a healthy home certainly played a major role in restricting visitors.\n\n20 | t he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 Disease and Death\n\nThe admission of sickly children and the widespread distribution of viruses and bacteria in a society that was unaware of the germ theory led to outbreaks of cholera, consumption, and scrofulous diseases. The asylum would not be spared the ravages of disease and early deaths throughout its early history. Five-year-old Robert Atkinson died April 2, 1839, of consumption. His death was the ﬁrst of a child who was not an orphan or one who was deserted by a parent and suffered from neglect. His father, Noel, was a respectable free man who had purchased the freedom of his wife and son for two hundred and ﬁfty dollars. His wife’s death led him to bring his two sons, Robert and William to the asylum. Childhood death was common, as reﬂected in the last stanza of a poem. The Dying Boy Oh! Tis their songs [angels] so sweet and clear— I think I hear them softly say dear children stay no longer here; come, come with us, we’ll lead the way. It must be heaven where they dwell—22\n\nAnnual reports provided narrative and statistical descriptions of diseases that kept the physician and nursing staff busy, often to the point of exhaustion and risk to their own health. The thirteenth annual report (November 15, 1849) was the ﬁrst one to list all diseases and deaths by type and gender. The eighty-three diseases resulted in twenty deaths.23 The managers’ motivation to care for as many children as space permitted led to the admission of some who were sickly. Elizabeth Johnson was found on the street but died of dropsy of the brain on May 29, 1838. Her mother, a former slave in the Empire State, had died a few years earlier. The fate of the father was unknown. Her grandmother, an ineffective guardian, was, according to the admissions records, one who ‘‘belonged to the most ignorant and degraded\n\nt he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 | 21\n\nDisease Fever Intermittent fever Phthisis pulmonalis Bronchitis Pneumonia Congestion of lungs Scrofulous irritation of glands Scrofulous caries Scrofulous rheumatism Conjunctivitis Diarrhea Tubercular peritonitis Indigestion Anemia Enteritis Cholera Hypertrophy of heart Pericarditis Strangury (painful urination) Congestion of brain Onychia maligna Dentition Total Deaths Phthesis pulmonalis Enteritis Diarrhea Pericarditis Anemia Cholera Congestion of brain Tuberculous peritonitis Total\n\nBoys\n\nGirls\n\n3 1 2 2 2 1 0 1 0 6 9 1 8 1 1 7 1 0 1 0 1 1 49\n\n3 1 3 0 0 0 3 1 1 2 7 1 0 0 0 10 0 1 0 1 0 0 34\n\nBoys\n\nGirls\n\n2 1 1 1 1 6 0 0 12\n\n3 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 8\n\n22 | t he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42\n\nclass of our coloured population.’’ The poorly clad Elizabeth had to be outﬁtted before she could be admitted on February 13, 1838. Some children, such as Gustavas Thompson, a sickly child whose mother wanted him with her in his last days, were released to parental care. Soon after, it was decided that ﬁve managers had to agree to return a child, provided that three were members of the admissions committee. While many succumbed to sickness, not all deaths were attributed to deadly diseases. A nine-year-old orphan, Ann Williams, died after eating buds of stramonium, a poisonous weed from a nearby lot. She approached death calmly expressing a hope to ‘‘go to the good place.’’24 The health of children was connected to the managers’ need for additional space. In less than two years after moving in, the small home on Twelfth Street was woefully inadequate. There were by September 1838 forty-ﬁve children in the asylum, and the fear of endangering the children’s health (some had died of scrofulous diseases) limited the occupancy to ﬁfty children. Several locations were considered for a new home, including a former state prison and the Leak and Watts Asylum, located seven miles away in Harlem. Neither was appropriate for their needs. During the summer of 1838, they asked Dr. James Milnor ‘‘for a donation from some property left by [Mary Thompson], a colored woman to his disposal.’’ Milnor and the co-executor agreed to donate three hundred dollars. The managers sought additional building funds by taking children to neighborhood churches to ask ministers to solicit donations from their parishioners.25 Nepotism played a major role in the managers’ efforts to ﬁnd larger quarters. On October 8, 1839, the New York Manumission Society (some members were either advisers to or supporters of the orphanage) voted to give the women ﬁve thousand dollars with interest, provided that they purchase land to accommodate at least one hundred children and erect a building within three years. Soon after, in 1839 and the following year, two anonymous contributions totaling ﬁve thousand dollars were donated to the building fund. (It was revealed, after her death, that the donor was Anna Jay, a manager and daughter of Chief Justice John Jay.)26 Space was needed. By the end of 1838, nineteen months after opening their doors, the Colored Orphan Asylum had admitted sixty-four\n\nt he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 | 23\n\norphaned and neglected or abused children. Of the sixty-four, thirtythree were orphans; the remaining twenty-nine had one parent. Three had been returned to a surviving parent or parents. One child had absconded, another one had been sent to the House of Refuge, and nine, sadly, had died. Most of the deaths had been attributed to the children previously having lived in squalid conditions in damp rooms, which caused their feeble bodies to be susceptible to scrofulous diseases. The fourth annual report, in 1840, concluded with news of improved health. The death of only one child in the past eighteen months was attributed to boarding out sick children in the country or isolating them from the healthy ones. This reinforced the managers’ desire to remove the institution ‘‘from the atmosphere of the city,’’ with its ﬁlth and disease caused by poor sewage and questionable drinking water. This last point, often the crucial appeal for public support, was not hyperbole. The city’s black population resided in the notorious Five Points area of lower Manhattan (today, the courthouse area), where vicious crime, disease, violence, and helplessness were constant reminders of poverty. In 1845, John H. Griscom’s sanitary report described the black alley neighborhood of Elizabeth Street, near the Five Points. There ‘‘ranged next [to] the fence were a number of pig styes and stables which surrounded a yard on three sides from the quantity of ﬁlth, liquid and otherwise, [which rendered] the ground . . . almost impassable.’’ The COA had to turn many applicants away, even though it meant further exposing them to ﬁlth, ignorance, and possible lives on the street, with its implications for dangerous and criminal activity. Even nonmalicious children sometimes had a negative effect upon the house. Elizabeth Brown became deaf after a summer illness but remained in the orphanage until June 18, 1839, when she was sent to the almshouse. It was not cruelty but pragmatism that caused the managers to remove her: her deafness and other inﬁrmities had ‘‘rendered her a disagreeable as well an unwholesome inmate of the house.’’27 Death and Religious Belief\n\nThe Quaker managers did not seek to convert the children but were mindful of the need to teach them morality and a belief in God. They\n\n24 | t he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42\n\nsought to have their charges ‘‘esteem moral and religious culture as the object to which all others should be made subordinate.’’ In this regard, they were aided by Methodist ministers who preached on Sundays, and it pleased the managers whenever children, especially ‘‘bad’’ ones, readily accepted Jesus Christ as their savior. Death was common in the asylum’s early years, and, as many died in the home, it was acceptable for all the children to witness the dying child’s last breath. Death was not something to hide from the living, as would become the custom for later generations, and the managers believed it important for children to hear exclamations of faith from dying children. A dying girl ‘‘asked only to depart and be with Christ, and He, whose love assigned to her here, a brief and obscure existence, heard that prayer, and took her to mercy in Himself,’’ noted the 1842 annual report. Many dying children passed away unnamed, but some whose brief lives and spirituality moved the managers were named in the minutes or annual reports. The impending death of eleven-year-old Adeline Hicks on September 13, 1842, was recorded as a tribute to her religious faith. Dying of consumption, Adeline said, ‘‘I have no fear of death. I know it is only my body that will be laid in the cold grave, my soul will go to Jesus, who died for me.’’ A visibly moved teacher wrote ‘‘Lines on the Death of Adeline Hicks,’’ hoping that children who read it would seek, like Adeline, to ‘‘have their souls washed and made white in the blood of the lamb.’’ Children in the orphanage would gather around the bed of a dying child and express their farewells. It was difﬁcult to reconcile the death of a young person who had not had time to live, to experience life and know physical love. ‘‘The only reassurance [people had was] that the child is now with an angel.’’28 The fear of death without salvation even affected those who entered the institution with vicious or profane habits. Some, such as William M. Jackson, an orphan who was admitted as an eight-year-old, became more prayerful. William was found in the streets in a deplorable neglected condition by Andrew McGoron, a Harlem resident, who brought him home, cleaned him, and provided him with clothes. William was a boy preacher. On March 18, 1849, the matron, Susan Benedict, and a teacher listened outside a closed door as he proclaimed, ‘‘oh, children suppose you were to die tonight unprepared, where, oh!\n\nt he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 | 25\n\nwhere would you go?’’ William asked God to bless the children and reach them before they died. ‘‘Oh, I do feel happy. I feel that Jesus smiles upon my soul. O that I may not be one of those who die unprepared,’’ he exclaimed. William was indentured to Nathaniel Clark in Ulster County, New York. William wrote the institution on May 1, 1850, ‘‘I have given my heart to Jesus Christ, and intend to serve Him forever.’’ Clark found William to be ‘‘a curious boy’’ who held prayer meetings. Either curiosity about the outer world or teenage hormones eventually got the better of William, for Nathaniel Clark wrote in an undated note that William had ‘‘left his place.’’ Another pious boy told the doubting Thomas in the asylum that you had to choose either the road to heaven or hell. A laughing boy was told ‘‘you may laugh, but when you come to die, you will be sorry for it.’’ The chastened boy replied, ‘‘children, I am sorry that I laughed; but I hope God will forgive me, and [use] the hammer of His word, and break my heart in pieces and take away this heart of stone, and give me a heart of ﬂesh.’’ Some girls held a prayer meeting, singing and praying for over an hour. They asked the matron for forgiveness for their bad behavior. Eight-year-old Hannah Ann Franklin wanted to learn to read. Her dying request was that the nurse read the Bible or a good book to her, particularly one that ‘‘described the death of pious children.’’ Henry Johnson was devoted to prayer. He criticized the other children for their misbehavior, and he told the nurse, ‘‘I long to go to Jesus.’’ He exclaimed that earthly music could never compare to its heavenly counterpart awaiting him. ‘‘And in this blessed hope, with a simple reliance on the saviour’s love, was this humbled child of poverty and degradation redeemed from a world of injustice and oppression,’’ wrote Anna Shotwell.29 Good behavior was a character trait cherished by the managers, who struggled in the early years both to teach and to properly discipline children who came to them lacking in common courtesy. Education in the Asylum\n\nInitially, the members of the education committee handled the teaching assignments, but, wanting a regular teacher, the managers hired\n\n26 | t he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42\n\nAnn Ray in 1837. Despite good recommendations, Miss Ray’s youth and inexperience made it difﬁcult ‘‘for her to maintain a strict discipline and order in the school.’’ Unable to replace Miss Ray, the managers decided to retain her for three additional months, until illness forced her to leave her position. Increased attendance necessitated the hiring of Mrs. Sarah P. Melvin, the widow of James A. Melvin and Ann Ray’s sister, as principal. Progress in the children’s achievements was reported in early 1838, but the managers were dissatisﬁed with the principal. In April, they hired a Miss White to teach, and she was given an assistant who aided her for three hours daily in addition to her duties as a nurse and seamstress. It soon became clear that the assistant was incapable of adequately serving the school. Later, the managers decided that the assistant teacher needed to live in the asylum and care for children out of school hours. The challenge of ﬁnding women capable of providing quality teaching and good discipline would remain a problem for several years.30 The managers were torn between bestowing upon the charges caring understanding or harsh discipline. They debated the use of corporal punishment, an issue that they would revisit for decades. The managers were loath to whip the children, but they also understood that solitary conﬁnement was a counterproductive measure in the case of children who became ‘‘noisy and violent, thumping against the doors, breaking the locks, etc.’’ They would in the coming decades alternate between periods of limited corporal punishment and forms of psychological control.31 Needed funds for education came in the form of $425.93 from the commissioners of the public school fund. The managers also appealed to the New York Manumission Society for funds to keep the school functioning. For several years, the Manumission Society forwarded to the orphanage small but crucial funds. Additional funding was sought from John Jacob Astor, Rufus Lord, and Jonathan Goodhue, prominent New Yorkers all, who over the years became donors. In 1839, white Protestant churches contributed $315.71. An additional $61.29 came from St. Philip’s Episcopal Church, a black church. Financial problems continued to plague the institution in early 1840. James McCune\n\nt he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 | 27\n\nSmith, who would soon become the institution’s physician, aided the cause with $201.50, from the proﬁts from the publication of his lecture on the Haitian Revolution. Smith praised the managers for seeking to educate black children when public funds were not distributed for that purpose and at a time when eight hundred children of European immigrants were educated and taught trades at public expense.32 The rudimentary lessons taught to the children employed the Lancasterian system, where older children provided instruction for younger ones while the teacher provided instruction to others. However, in early 1847 the managers decided to maintain it only when classes were small enough for teachers to observe all of the students at once. The discipline problem was compounded by the difﬁculty that the asylum had in hiring and retaining competent teachers. White teachers had trouble relating to the cultural differences of their charges. For this reason, the managers advertised for a black instructor in six issues of the Colored American. The paucity of educated African American women and the desire of many to teach in a black-controlled school made it hard for the asylum to hire one quickly. It was not until 1848 that a black woman, Mary A. Bodee, was employed. A popular teacher, she was ill for several years with a heart condition and repeated hemorrhages of the lungs. On her deathbed, Mary thanked God for giving her time to say goodbye to her children, Frances, Robert, and Edward, as well as the staff, teachers, and managers. She exclaimed, ‘‘o death, where is thy sting. O grave where is thy victory.’’ She died with a ‘‘countenance . . . radiant with a sweet and heavenly smile.’’ Secretary Anna Shotwell tellingly wrote that the institution’s family loved Mary Bodee, despite her dark skin. Unfortunately, soon thereafter, Robert, Mary’s twelve-year-old son, died of consumption. Anna Shotwell noted, ‘‘Robert had evidently found the pearl of great price; his mother’s God was his God.’’ Mary’s daughter Frances had earlier been bound over to the institution until age twelve, but when she was ten, Mary had assigned her to be cared for by Mr. and Mrs. Edward Felix. The board of managers relinquished their claim and placed her in the foster home but retained oversight of her until she reached the age of twelve. Mary Bodee’s son Robert had been learning the tinning business from\n\n28 | t he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42\n\nEdward Felix, and her other son, Edward, was indentured to a barber. Mary’s death highlighted another segment of daily humiliation for New Yorkers of darker hue. The Rev. James W. C. Pennington heard of Mary’s funeral an hour before it started, but he was unable to get public transportation because of racial prejudice. No carriage driver would take him for less than a then-astronomical fee of $1.50 (more than a day’s pay for most laborers). Pennington had to walk on a humid day and arrived unﬁt for the service. Later, in 1855, he lost a discrimination suit against a railroad company.33\n\nCommunity Support\n\nThe African American community in New York deeply appreciated the efforts of the Colored Orphan Asylum to care for their children. Despite the earlier misgivings of Samuel Cornish, the progress of the COA in its earliest years was facilitated by the efforts of clergymen who solicited funds and services from their congregations. A strong supporter was Peter Williams, the pastor of St. Philip’s Episcopal Church. His death in 1840 was a major blow to the managers. The support of the black community reinforced the managers’ belief that their mission was a holy one that had providential blessing and that kind New Yorkers would not let their ﬂedging institution wither on the vine. They expected help from all quarters of political persuasion because they, from the beginning, never allowed the institution to ally itself with ‘‘the peculiar views and interests of any sect or party, or with the plans of any other benevolent organization.’’ The managers declared in their fourth annual report ‘‘to place on a permanent footing an institution which shall no longer permit the helpless orphan to perish in his ignorance and wretchedness.’’ They begged the public to support them in raising the black child ‘‘from his degradation . . . to elevate his character, develop his faculties and instruct him in . . . the knowledge of his obligation to himself, to his neighbor, and to his God.’’ The response was heartwarming. Twenty-three patrons pledged\n\nt he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42 | 29\n\nto give annually ﬁfty or more dollars at one time; seventeen life members vowed to donate twenty-ﬁve dollars at one time. Signiﬁcant and timely gifts of dry goods, beans, crackers, potatoes, apples, Indian meal, buckwheat, shoes, and seven pairs of stockings knitted by a ninety-year-old colored woman in Rahway, New Jersey, were accepted with appreciation.34 The ﬁrst few years proved to be a struggle for the female managers. Their heroic efforts kept the institution viable during this period and provided them with inspiration to continue despite future periods of ﬁnancial insecurity and the devastating destruction of their building by rioters in 1863. Many of the details of their story for the period of 1841 through November 1846 has been lost to history, because the ﬁres of the 1863 Draft Riots destroyed most of their records. The surviving records, however, reveal that faithful supporters kept alive the managers’ hopes. The partial records indicated that throughout 1841 the ladies provided the children with a ‘‘good practical education’’ at a time when most Americans, children as well as adults, were illiterate.35 In 1842, a small ﬁre started in a sleeping area, but thankfully during the day, averting a disaster. The children were temporarily sheltered on Fiftieth Street, then outside of the city’s limits. This spurred the managers’ effort to ﬁnd a new home in an area of cleaner air. Their prayers and hopes were answered in June, when the Corporation of the City of New York provided them with twenty lots on Fifth Avenue between Forty-third and Forty-fourth Streets. There was space to build a home with a 140-foot front, forty-two to ﬁfty feet of depth, and a cellar free of dampness. The prospect of a new home increased the urgency for renewed funding to pay for landscaping, to erect a fence, and eventually to grade the street. New supporters (there now were sixty-six) included Cornelius V. S. Roosevelt and his wife, Margaret, who became a manager in 1840. Margaret Roosevelt came from a prominent Philadelphia Quaker family. Cornelius Roosevelt, a wealthy banker, merchant, and philanthropist, was the grandfather of Theodore Roosevelt, the future president.36 The managers had over the years accumulated the twenty thousand dollars needed to erect the building, but in January 1843, Anna\n\n30 | t he ea rl y y ea rs , 1 83 6 – 42\n\nShotwell requested ten thousand dollars from the New York Manumission Society for the grounds, heating ﬁxtures, and simple furniture. The Manumission Society quickly appropriated one thousand dollars. The managers eagerly looked forward to their new home, where they moved to on May 1, 1843.37\n\n2\n\nFifth Avenue: Growth and Progress, 1843–54\n\nThe move to Forty-third Street and Fifth Avenue on May 1 was chaotic. The orphanage’s staff had to transport furniture and household goods—along with children of various ages—through Manhattan streets clogged with private and public carriages and wagons ferrying goods around the island. This section of midtown Manhattan was not the glamorous area it is today, with banks, expensive shoe stores, jewelry stores, publishing houses, insurance agencies, and department stores. In contrast, the area, then outside of the city’s limits, was described by Mary Murray as an inelegant neighborhood lacking paved streets. Winter storms brought endless mud, which forced the managers to place large stones in the road in order to cross Fifth Avenue. An advantage was the availability of water from the Croton Reservoir (the site of the present-day New York Public Library), located a block away. The new two-story building provided space for play rooms, coal and vegetable bins, a kitchen, dining room, bathing room, two inﬁrmaries, and school rooms. The dining room, one of the inﬁrmaries, and one of the school rooms were heated by hot water running through iron pipes. Friends of the institution aided their ﬁrst year in their new home with donations of beef, mutton, fruit, crockery, furniture, carpeting, soap, books, tools, sheets, eating utensils, and pies and cakes. Good news came in early 1844, when the city provided twenty additional lots adjacent to their home. The extra space was used to keep several cows and to grow vegetables. Within a few years, the managers had earned income from the vegetable garden; they had built a brick stable and erected a garden fence. Unfortunately, the managers found out in\n\n32 | f if th av en ue : g ro wt h a nd pr og re ss , 1 84 3– 54\n\n1847 that they had not been given legal right to the adjacent property, and it was sold.1 Prominent New Yorkers aided the institution. James Lenox, whose funds would immensely aid the future New York Public Library, was a major supporter of the Colored Orphan Asylum. Another supporter, John Jay, the son of the ﬁrst chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, spoke on behalf of the orphanage on December 11, 1843. He noted that there were seventy children in a building that could accommodate 150. He called upon public support for the ladies who sought to follow Jesus Christ’s admonition ‘‘to cherish the fatherless and to feed His lambs.’’2 By the end of 1845, 262 children had been admitted since June 9, 1837. The children helped to lower expenses by doing much of the housework (in preparation for similar work as indentures). The public appeals presented the bigoted view of the institution’s physicians James MacDonald and James Proudﬁt, members of the American Colonization Society (which supported the removal of willing blacks to Liberia), that the children’s high morbidity and mortality were due to environment, poverty, and their ‘‘peculiar constitution and condition.’’\n\nThe Fifth Avenue building at Forty-third Street, c. 1854.

This view of innate Negro depravity unless checked by benevolent paternalism was challenged by the black physician James McCune Smith, who informed the New York Tribune in early 1844 that proportionally there were more whites in the almshouses than blacks. Paradoxically, in light of the orphanage’s paternalistic statements, the African American community aided them ﬁnancially out of appreciation for the care provided their children. St. Philip’s Episcopal Church contributed $99.71; a child, Charlotte Ann Seymour, collected $21.00 from her mother’s friends; two black persons gave $2.00 each; another donated 50 cents; two friends from the West sent $3.00; and three donated four days each of work. The gratiﬁed managers exclaimed, ‘‘we would not omit the expression of gratitude to many of the colored friends of the institution for their kind offers.’’3 James McCune Smith, an educator, medical researcher, sociologist, political strategist, and ﬁrst-rate intellectual, would be hired in December 1846 to be the orphanage’s physician, where he remained until his death in 1865. Smith attended African Free School No. 2, where his classmates included the abolitionist Henry Highland Garnet, the actor Ira Aldridge, the educator Charles L. Reason, the clergyman Alexander Crummell, and the abolitionist Samuel Ringgold Ward. Racial prejudice forced Smith to go abroad for an education, after both Columbia College and Geneva Medical College denied him admission. He graduated ﬁrst in his class while earning a bachelors, masters, and a medical degree in 1837 from the University of Glasgow in Scotland. Smith was scheduled to return to the United States in 1837 aboard the Canonicus, but the captain refused him boarding. Upon his return, the Colored American referred to him as one of the nation’s brightest and no man’s inferior in ‘‘moral worth and intellectual capacity.’’ He treated both white and black patients at his private practice at 93 West Broadway in Manhattan.4 Smith’s impressive pedigree did not protect him from discrimination. New York public carriers either excluded African Americans or relegated them to segregated conveyances. Smith had to walk six or\n\n34 | f if th av en ue : g ro wt h a nd pr og re ss , 1 84 3– 54\n\nJames McCune Smith, asylum’s physician 1846–65.

At ﬁrst, the managers allowed him to hire a conveyance at their expense during a period of disease in the building. Later, they arranged for a special dispensation to grant him a ticket for personal use. Upset by such blatant discrimination, the managers placed a notice in the daily papers complaining about the city cars denying riding privileges to colored residents. While this gesture was a departure from their vow not to get involved in the issues of the day, perhaps here they can be faulted for not making a greater effort. Many of the managers’ friends were inﬂuential businessmen and attorneys, and some even supported equal rights, but the orphanage managers did not appeal to them to attack aggressively the racial discrimination that confronted African Americans daily. Blatant public conveyance discrimination persisted until 1858, when Maria Jenkins successfully sued for bias.5 The indignities that blacks faced in life often did not end with death. Just as many of their ancestors were buried in an area then beyond the city’s limits known as the Negro Burial Ground, African Americans in the mid-nineteenth century faced difﬁcult burial decisions. Many white churches would not bury them in their burial grounds, and unless they were members of a benevolent society, they might lack funds for a decent funeral. The managers’ concern for the proper interment of their deceased charges was alleviated after Samuel N. Burrill offered to handle the asylum’s burial arrangements at his own expense. However, his move to Brooklyn in late 1846 ended his near-decade of benevolence. Each burial at the Presbyterian Cemetery in Manhattan cost Burrill ﬁve dollars. His brother, who could not afford the whole cost, offered to bear half the expenses. The managers hoped that Samuel’s friends would join his brother to defray the funeral costs. In early 1847, Samuel Burrill recommended that the managers apply to the trustees of Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn for ‘‘a gift of ground.’’ Burrill provided the names of brothers-in-law who had inﬂuence with the cemetery’s board. On March 10, 1847, the managers were granted a Green-Wood plot of 37.5 feet. It would cost $2.371/2 for each interment. Henry Stephenson, who died on February 13, 1850,\n\n36 | f if th av en ue : g ro wt h a nd pr og re ss , 1 84 3– 54\n\nwas the ﬁrst asylum child buried at Green-Wood. In later years, children would be interred at Trinity’s cemetery in upper Manhattan and Kensico in Westchester County.6\n\nIllness, Death, and a New Hospital\n\nThe managers’ commitment to admitting needy children was tested during the winter of 1847, when an overabundance of children with infections or incurable diseases applied for admission. While not showing a willingness to admit diseased children, the managers thought it appropriate to admit scrofulous ones. However, a hospital was needed if the managers were to admit this class of children. Building a hospital would be costly, but Anna Shotwell argued that it was more costly to reject ‘‘this deplorably destitute and suffering portion of the human family.’’ The advisers recommended on May 3, 1847, that the managers construct a hospital, perhaps on their Twelfth Street property. Later, in November, the managers decided to add a wing to the Fifth Avenue residence instead of erecting a separate building. They also changed their by-laws to accept children over the age of eight as long as they would not become permanent charges of the asylum. This would prove to be a momentous decision, for it led to the admission of older children, whose age and background caused discipline problems. Dr. Smith noted that the main building had space for only fourteen sick children. A scrofulous condition, he stressed, was a product of poverty, not race. Many African American children lived in damp quarters, were exposed to inclement weather, and contracted the condition from their parents. Smith emphasized that a large hospital space would make it easier to control epidemics and noted that there had been twenty-four deaths in the orphanage in 1847 compared to ﬁfteen in the previous four years combined. His appeal for funds to build a hospital wing added $121.37 to the treasury.7 Financial difﬁculties plagued the managers throughout 1847, but their prayers were temporarily answered in early 1848. The New York Manumission Society (inactive since the abolition of slavery in 1827)\n\nf if th av en ue : g ro wt h a nd pr og re ss , 1 84 3– 54 | 37\n\nvoted to dissolve its operation. Two advisers to the orphanage, William F. Mott and Mahlon Day, were president and ﬁrst vice president respectively of the Manumission Society, and through their inﬂuence the society voted to turn over to the Colored Orphan Asylum all money, stock, bonds, and mortgages in their possession, provided the assets were used to educate and improve the condition of black New Yorkers.8 A hospital wing to isolate seriously sick and contagious children was needed. Smith’s excellent medical skills could not prevent in 1848 the death of seventeen young children, deaths mostly attributed to some form of scrofulous condition. Smith noted in his report that isolation would have limited the deaths and provided an opportunity to carefully study the diseases ‘‘to which their hard life has condemned so large a proportion of them.’’ The hospital became a reality with the receipt of a ﬁve-thousand-dollar legacy from Elizabeth DeMilt, who died on August 31, 1849. The managers used the unexpected funds to erect a thirty-by-sixty-ﬁve-foot building that corresponded ‘‘in height and architectural proportions with the main building,’’ about ﬁfteen feet apart from it. There were two large rooms for sick children, two additional rooms, a schoolroom for convalescent patients, an apothecary’s room, nurses’ apartments, a dining room, a playroom, and a basement room for drying clothes. The hospital wing opened on June 26, 1850, with thirty-two patients, mostly suffering from scrofulous inﬂammation of the glands. The managers praised James McCune Smith for ‘‘carefully seeking opportunity of marking the symptoms and of arresting the progress of disease, by judicial medical treatment.’’ For the year ending November 22, 1850, eighty-two children were ill, thirty-three suffered from dysentery, and seven had died. Smith’s physician report noted that a study, The Diseases of Infancy and Childhood by a Dr. West, reported that girls were affected more with whooping cough than were boys. This had proved true in London and in the New York orphanage as well, where 73.30 percent of the whooping cough cases were girls. Freedom to isolate the sick from the healthy allowed for better treatment of three typhus cases, and even though one died, it afforded the managers a ‘‘release from the pain of refusing applicant laboring under constitutional malady.’’ But even Smith’s exemplary medical skills could not protect all those who were sickly—not even\n\n38 | f if th av en ue : g ro wt h a nd pr og re ss , 1 84 3– 54\n\nhis own children were spared. A few years later, he informed his friend Gerrit Smith of the deaths of Amy, Frederick, Peter, and Anna. The physician’s lament, ‘‘oh it is so sad to have no children playing around the hearth stone,’’ is shared by all parents who lose a child to disease.9\n\nIndenturing\n\nIndenturing children was a common practice in nineteenth-century orphanages, but race played a part in the assignments of children from the COA. Like girls in the Colored Orphan Asylum, educated girls in other orphanages were placed out as domestics until the age of eighteen. In 1809, the New York Orphan Asylum indentured educated boys until age ﬁfteen, and then they were returned to the institution to be bound as apprentices ‘‘to virtuous mechanics of the community, and perhaps the future benefactors of the institution which nurtured their helpless infancy.’’ The COA children remained until age twelve and, unless they were boarders, the girls were indentured as domestics and the boys as farm laborers. Few were permitted to work in New York City, which the managers deemed to be an unsavory place for young bodies, and fewer still were sent to mechanics or artisans. Most were sent to white families far removed from New York City, where many felt alienated and longed for contact with siblings in the orphanage or indentured elsewhere.10 Bigotry kept African Americans uneducated and untrained for trades. It was difﬁcult for blacks to gain a bookkeeping position or to receive a carman’s license. Left unsaid was the failure of New York’s abolitionists and Quakers, many whom called for racial equality, to offer to teach the trades or business practices to African Americans. Samuel Ringgold Ward, a black abolitionist and clergyman, was deeply offended. He informed Frederick Douglass that even though Quakers were no longer slave owners nor did they join anti-Negro mobs, they never permitted youths of color to attend school with their children and that ‘‘whatever they do for us savors of pity, and is done at arm’s length, on a sort of [do not touch me] principle. [T]hey would sooner put on a narrow brim or an unstraight coat [than] raise a negro boy to\n\nf if th av en ue : g ro wt h a nd pr og re ss , 1 84 3– 54 | 39\n\na clerkship or put him in a profession or ﬁt him for anything more than a drudge.’’ This was a serious charge, and it had more than a germ of truth to it. Only rarely during the sixty-odd years that the managers sent out indentures did they broach the subject of placing them with skilled artisans, and when they did, it usually was with a black barber or other skilled worker. One rare example was the placement of sixteen-year-old Sarah Williams, the ﬁrst child admitted to the orphanage on June 9, 1837, who in 1849 left to be apprenticed to a tailor in Shrewsbury, New Jersey.11\n\nGood and Bad Indentures\n\nThose who were indentures had much in common: they left the orphanage at age twelve, but not all were mature enough to accept the separation from the orphanage, for some the only home they knew, or from siblings. Some were physically too small or weak to perform chores to the standards of their employers, and some were unable to live by the moral guidance provided them in the asylum. Many did not complete their indentures, chaﬁng under restrictions that initially conﬁned them to an employer until age twenty-one, for boys (later, it was lowered to age eighteen). Those who left their assignments early did not receive the stipend money sent to the institution by employers. T. H. F. (Thaddeus Henry Freeman) was indentured in 1843 to William Demerest. Thaddeus wrote in 1846, ‘‘I learned catechism and hymn and Bible question.’’ He had taught two young girls in his home to read. ‘‘They learn very nice,’’ he proudly noted. ‘‘I am glad I have been taught [at the asylum] that nothing is sure to make me a good boy, but to believe in God.’’ H. G. (Henry Giles) wrote from Sharon, Illinois, on February 10, 1846, ‘‘I send my love to sister, grandmother and mother, and let them know that I am pleased with the place.’’ H. S. (Henry Smith) wrote on November 13, 1846, from Yorktown, New York, ‘‘I think I have a good home.’’ He waited on tables, assisted the cook, cared for the cows, and read to the mistress of the house. Eager to please his new family, Henry added, ‘‘I try to be a good boy, and I hope no wrong deed will ever be coupled with [my] name.’’12\n\n40 | f if th av en ue : g ro wt h a nd pr og re ss , 1 84 3– 54\n\nSome indentures were extremely fortunate to have kind employers who not only fed them properly but allowed them to go to school and oversaw their moral development by encouraging church attendance. George Coles was indentured on February 3, 1860, to William Henry Van Deventer, of Cranbury, New Jersey. On June 30, 1861, George wrote Superintendent Davis from Bald Mountain, New York, expressing loneliness and requesting a letter from his orphanage home. ‘‘For home it is; it was there w[h]ere I ﬁrst l[e]arned the word of God; it was there where I ﬁrst uttered my ﬁrst prayer, and learned ﬁrst my alphabet. My employer says that if I stay with him until I am twenty-one, he will give me a house and ﬁfty acres of land; and I have now chose the place for the house. Now I want a little of your advice what to do about it, as I know that I can get good advice from you.’’13 Undoubtedly, many a child heard these words and prayed for an employer as kind as Mr. Van Deventer. Aaron Lewis, who was indentured on May 14, 1846, to Henry Roundtree of Cornwall, New York, was extremely pleased with his employer’s kindness. Aaron wrote, on December 11, 1851, to ‘‘my kind benefactor,’’ with thanks for being housed in the orphanage and for having a good master. ‘‘The darkness of my skin makes no difference in treatment of me,’’ he added. The happy teenager concluded that every asylum boy should have a place as nice as his. Unlike most indentures, who worked in the home or on a farm, Aaron had learned how to take care of a steam engine and how to make stoves. He was pleased that his employer provided him with time and money to go to the state fair at Rochester, New York. Aaron, like most of the children, was indentured to a white family, and the record showed that there was little evidence of racial discrimination in either the housing or with neighbors.14 Some lacked self-discipline once they were removed from the constraints of the orphanage. James Gomes was indentured in Sullivan County, New York, in 1853. His loneliness prompted him to return to the orphanage, but the rules prohibited him from remaining there. The alternative was an assignment to the House of Refuge or a return to the streets. A thoroughly chastened James walked the one hundred miles back to the home of his former master, who accepted him as\n\nf if th av en ue : g ro wt h a nd pr og re ss , 1 84 3– 54 | 41\n\nhis prodigal son. In 1858, the twenty-one-year-old James wrote from Fallsburgh, New York, to the asylum children, ‘‘I warn you all as long as you have a good home . . . leave it not in a hurry to ﬁnd a better. For if you do not you will ﬁnd a hard road to travel, as I found when I left the asylum . . . before I reached my port, the way of the transgressor is hard. Take the advice of one who has tried it.’’ James Gomes wrote to Superintendent William Davis, on November 15, 1860, ‘‘I am . . . striving to gain an honest livelihood which I owe to you. The only way I can show my gratitude towards you is by my future conduct and good behavior, and I can never forget my orphan home where I learned what it requires to make a man of good morals.’’15 By most circumstances, George Wesley Thompson could have been burdened by misfortunes. After the death of his parents, the thirteenyear-old boy departed Boston to be with his aunt in New York, who, unknowing to him, was buried the day before his arrival. He was indentured on April 15, 1845, but left his assignment without permission in 1847. Thirteen years later, the twenty-nine-year-old George wrote to the orphanage, ‘‘I am about to congratulate you upon the noble success you have had in training up those you have had and still are in charge of [for] many a child has been snatched away from poverty, cold, relentless grasp and placed in that happy home.’’ The grateful man concluded, ‘‘the work you have begun will crown your brow with laurels and your hearts with triumphant satisfaction. Fire the zeal of love and plant the seed of righteousness.’’ As a morality lesson for others, he added that he was a naughty boy who had ‘‘teased and taunted old men and women’’ until the asylum reformed him. ‘‘Oh! When will the children learn to honor their fathers an[d] mothers?’’ he lamented. Twenty-ﬁve-year-old George W. Potter wrote the asylum on Christmas Day, 1860. He reported that reading the Bible given him by the managers kept him from temptation. ‘‘I thank you for the kind attention given me. . . . To you I owe all that I am now, and [I plan] to act as a light of the institution. . . . It is with pride that I couple my name with the institution, and it shall be my care to bring no reproach, but . . . [to] retain the pleasant memory of my benefactors.’’ George’s brother, Frank, had completed his apprenticeship, and according to Anna Shotwell, the brothers were of ‘‘superior talents, strict integrity and persevering industry.’’ William Isaac, whom George was indentured to in\n\n42 | f if th av en ue : g ro wt h a nd pr og re ss , 1 84 3– 54\n\n1848, considered him a mechanical genius. Frank became a successful barber and hairdresser. He informed Superintendent Davis by letter on November 29, 1861, that he had shaved men and dressed hair for three months and was ready to cut hair. Frank praised the managers and hoped that they would receive his letter as a sign of his respect for them.16 These and other success stories were highlighted in annual reports as fundraising tools to loosen the purse strings of New Yorkers. Many indentured children failed to complete their assignment. For some, boredom led them to abscond from their placement, only to fall into a state of destitution or, worse, engage in mischievous or criminal behavior. Some came into the asylum bereft of common manners and lacking in morals. Their earlier exposure to vice and the managers’ inability to develop a moral base in their lives caused some to commit acts of violence against their employer or the family that housed them. These incidents were hidden mainly in the minutes or indenturing reports, which were not available to the public. A few vicious acts appeared in newspapers, which caused embarrassment for the institution. The oldest girl in the institution, Harriet Williams, an orphan, was placed on trial with James Montgomery of Charlton Street in Manhattan on April 15, 1839. Nine weeks later, she was deemed guilty of gross misconduct and sent to James Fuller of Skaneateles, New York, near Syracuse. Her age was between ten and twelve.17 Phoebe Clark’s father had died at sea. The twelve-year-old was indentured in 1854 to William J. Shurtleff of Winslow, Maine, who visited the asylum in 1855 to inform the superintendent that Phoebe had threatened to poison his family and set the house on ﬁre. Because most children were indentured as domestics or farm laborers, it was signiﬁcant when one had the prospect to be assigned to a mechanic or tradesman. But it was extremely tragic when the youngster did not take advantage of the opportunity. Edward Moll, a resident of Germany, proposed in June 1852 that the managers allow him ‘‘to take a dark boy from the asylum, give him a thoroughly good education and trade or profession as he may choose and when of age provide him with [funds to return] to New York, should it be his wish, by a respectable conveyance separate from the steerage passengers.’’ After\n\nf if th av en ue : g ro wt h a nd pr og re ss , 1 84 3– 54 | 43\n\nverifying Moll’s character, the managers allowed eleven-year-old David Shutt to travel abroad. This was an amazing gesture, which, unfortunately, the young boy did not or was not able to appreciate. He returned home for unknown reasons, but his age (over twelve) prohibited him from remaining in the asylum. He soon became a thief and a drifter. He died of fever at an unspeciﬁed date in a juvenile receiving home.18 Often, the young children did not realize how fortunate they were to be living in the Colored Orphan Asylum. Those who entered as infants were sheltered from the ills of poverty, food of poor quality and limited quantity, ﬁlth, and crime that hindered so many children of both races. Children in the asylum took for granted an education that many, including adults, were unable to receive. Elizabeth Thomas wrote the managers from Egremont, Massachusetts, on her ﬁfteenth birthday, April 18, 1859. ‘‘I feel very sorrow to think I did not improve the opportunity which I had to learn while I was there now that it does not seem convenient for me to go. I have been to school nearly four months since I have been here, and hope to go more.’’ Elizabeth had much to regret. Indentured to Mrs. Sarah Upton, Elizabeth wrote on April 3, 1857, nearly ten months after leaving the managers, that she liked her new home very much. The situation, however, changed rapidly. Mrs. Upton wrote the asylum on January 4, 1859, that the young girl had behaved improperly, which was the reason why she had delayed forwarding the stipend money. Mrs. Upton, nonetheless, saw some improvement in her fourteen-year-old charge. Elizabeth’s misbehavior paled in comparison with the antics of some children. A representative of this group was Charles Henry Cisco. The orphan boy was indentured on September 30, 1859, to the Rev. Thomas D. Hoover of Cranbury, New Jersey. Hoover wrote in July 1864 that Charles had been worthless for over a year and had recently been intoxicated three times. The pious minister’s kindness failed to turn Charles around. ‘‘I hope God will watch over him,’’ he plaintively added. Not soured by this experience, Hoover requested that the managers send him a fourteen-year-old boy, for whom he promised to ‘‘do all I can for his moral and religious culture.’’ Left unsaid in the correspondence was Charles’s age. His restlessness and experiments with liquor occurred when he\n\n44 | f if th av en ue : g ro wt h a nd pr og re ss , 1 84 3– 54\n\nwas about seventeen. Many indentures resented working until the age of twenty-one before they could earn wages, and drinking and smoking were their only expressions of reaching manhood.19 The depravity of some children resulted in theft, ﬁres, poisoning, and even physical violence. Even the promise of unofﬁcial adoption did not curb some misbehavior. Sophie Slossom was admitted in"
