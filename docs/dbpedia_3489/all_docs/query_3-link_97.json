        "text": "Fifteen years ago, on December 11, 2007, I posted my first \"On This Day in History\" feature on the History News Network, edited by Richard Shenkman, where I was a Features Editor. The post, \"December 17, 1862, Grant Issues General Order â„– 11 expelling Jews during the Civil War,\" was based on my graduate research in Southern Jewish history. At the time, I was a graduate student in the MA in Judaic Studies program in the Department of Religion at Concordia University. I wrote the feature sporadically over for three years until 2010. Eight years later, in 2018, after an illness, I was reassessing my career. For the previous five years, I dedicated myself to journalism, writing over 1,100 articles for Examiner.com, where I reported on Politics, Judaism, Education, and general news. Afterward, I wanted to return to my roots of academic writing, primarily history. For a long time, my mother asked me to restart writing \"On This Day in History\" stories. In June 2018, I took the plunge, posting them this time on Medium, with the title \"OTD in History,\" inspired by the popular social media hashtag. I wrote most of the articles in 2018 and 2019, mostly on American history, but some Jewish history. All these years later, I am still writing \"On This Day in History\" features but more sporadically, focusing instead on more comprehensive book-length historical research primarily in my field of American Jewish history. My latest from August is about Theodor Herzl and the First Zionist Congress held in Basel, Switzerland, from August 29 to 31, 1897. Last month, my mother died; she was my best champion; she constantly encouraged me; she believed in writing and art skills more than anyone and probably more than anyone ever will in my life. What she enjoyed most was when I wrote or drew. My \"On This Day in History\" articles were my mother's favorite among my articles and essays. She wanted me to keep going, keep writing, and keep drawing and painting. It is for my mother that I compiled all my \"On This Day in history\" articles in one place, and it is to her I dedicate this volume."
