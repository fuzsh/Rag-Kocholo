        "text": "The Sundance Film Festival is still a few months away, but already some of the films on the festival’s just announced slate are starting to stir up some conversation. Kirby Dick’s The Invisible War is one of those titles, and from a viewing of the just released trailer below, I’, thinking this is a conversation that will be ongoing for some time.\n\nThe film is described thusly on Dick’s own YouTube page, where the trailer debuted –\n\nAn investigative and powerfully emotional examination of the epidemic of rape of soldiers within the U.S. military, the institutions that cover up its existence and the profound personal and social consequences that arise from it.\n\nIt should be interesting to see the reaction to this film, though I suspect that Dick will be in for a lot of backlash. Rightfully so, the military is held in high regard by virtually all Americans. Unfortunately, there will be some people who won’t be able to separate themselves from that regard and be able to objectively look at the problems Dick may be detailing in the documentary. Personally, I’m of the opinion that if you love something it is vitally important that you can step outside that love and look at the object of your affection dispassionately for flaws in order to try and help it be even better. But to some, even well meaning criticism is only viewed as an attack and you can bet that certain quarters will call Kirby’s documentary a “slam piece,” probably without even seeing the film itself."
