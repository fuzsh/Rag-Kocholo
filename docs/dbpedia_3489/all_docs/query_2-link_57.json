The screening will be followed by a Q & A with Oscar-nominated director Kirby Dick.\n\nThe Invisible War\n\nis a groundbreaking investigation into one of America’s most disturbing secrets: the epidemic of rape within the US military. Focusing on the powerful stories of several young veterans, the film is a moving examination of the staggering personal and societal costs of these assaults.\n\nSays Professor Sally Rubin of the film,\n\nEveryone should go see Kirby Dick and “The Invisible War.” This is a groundbreaking film that has been hugely influential in changing policy around sexual assault in the military, and represents the highest potential of documentary films to create change."
