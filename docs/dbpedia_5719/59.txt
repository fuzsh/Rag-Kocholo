The Neighbourhood was formed in August 2011 by the singer Jesse Rutherford, guitarists Zachary Abels and Jeremiah Freedman, bass guitarist Michael Margott and drummer Bryan "Olivver" Sammis. The members of The Neighbourhood chose the British spelling of "neighbourhood" on the advice of their manager, in order to distinguish themselves from a band already using the American spelling; hence, their song names also use the British spelling.

In early 2012, the Neighbourhood released "Female Robbery" and "Sweater Weather". In May 2012, the band unveiled their debut self-released extended play titled I'm Sorry... for free download, produced by Justyn Pilbrow. In December 2012, the Neighbourhood released their second EP, Thank You,.

It was preceded by the lead single "Sweater Weather", which music video was released on March 5, 2013. They made their first televised performance of the song on June 27, 2013, at Jimmy Kimmel Live. "Sweater Weather" topped the charts in early June 2013, reaching number one on Billboard Alternative Songs chart and breaking the top ten on Billboard Heatseekers Songs chart.
