        "text": "CHICAGO — The arrival and resettlement of migrants in Chicago has dominated headlines, City Council hearings and community meetings in the year since Brandon Johnson was sworn in as mayor.\n\nJohnson pledged “real leadership” in the Mayor’s Office by creating the role of deputy mayor immigrant, migrant and refugee rights; slammed the housing of migrants in police stations but took months to offer an alternative; and his administration’s treatment of migrants was blasted by migrants and the volunteers who worked with them.\n\nBut one year into his tenure, as city faces another potential surge in arrivals this summer, Johnson’s plan to manage the crisis remains sparse in detail.\n\nSince August 2022, more than 41,000 migrants have arrived in Chicago, the majority of them brought on buses at the direction of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott as a protest of federal immigration policy.\n\nAs of May 13, about 7,600 migrants were living in temporary city-run shelters, according to data from the Office of Emergency Management and Communications. But in recent months, the city housed more than double that.\n\nDuring Johnson’s campaign and leading up to his inauguration, he offered little in the way of tangible plans on how as mayor he would address the thousands of migrants hoping to call Chicago home.\n\nBy the time Johnson took office, the pace of migrants arriving to the city was steadily increasing, and it became clear addressing this humanitarian crisis would be added to his list of priorities.\n\n“We don’t want the story to be told that we were unable to house the unhoused or provide safe harbor for those who are seeking refuge here, because there is enough room for everyone in the city of Chicago,” Johnson said during his inaugural address.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the mayor’s pledges and progress on his administration’s handling of this humanitarian crisis.\n\nDeputy Mayor For Immigrant, Migrant And Refugee Rights\n\nOn Johnson’s first day in office, he used an executive order to create the role of deputy mayor for immigrant, migrant and refugee rights. At the time, Johnson said he wanted to fill the position as soon as possible.\n\nThis ostensibly replaced the Office of New Americans, which was established under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Its director, Nubia Wilman, left during the mayoral transition.\n\n“I am committed to making sure that there is real leadership in the office of the mayor to provide the type of support so that we have a real plan in place,” Johnson said during a visit to the Near West Side (12th) District police station May 16, 2023. At the time, dozens of migrants lived there.\n\nBeatriz Ponce de Leon, who previously worked for the Illinois Department of Human Services, was appointed to the new role less than two months later on July 3.\n\nPonce de Leon quickly became a familiar face during community meetings where city officials shared details about migrant shelters opening in neighborhoods across the city. She also spoke about the city’s response during hearings before the City Council’s Committee on Immigrant, Migrant and Refugee Rights and during press briefings on the issue.\n\nHowever, bringing new leadership on the matter into Johnson’s office didn’t prevent his administration from making decisions that were fiercely criticized by migrant advocates.\n\nMoving Migrants Out Of Police Stations\n\nHousing new arrivals in police stations became perhaps the most visible signal to Chicagoans the city was unprepared and struggling to care for the growing migrant population.\n\nWhen Johnson took office, he hadn’t offered a specific plan for how his administration would manage the situation beyond saying he was briefed regularly throughout the transition and assembled a small team. Months into his term, he still hadn’t revealed any plans publicly.\n\n“I’m still very much committed to removing people from police stations and putting them into more sustainable, suitable shelters,” Johnson said in late August without elaborating.\n\nAs the city ran out of open shelter space in early 2023, new arrivals were being directed to police stations and told to call 311 to find shelter. Bringing migrants to police stations eventually became a de-facto city procedure.\n\nMutual aid volunteers and police officers working closely with migrants criticized the lack of support they received from the city.\n\nJohnson visited the 12th District police station during his first week in office to see “firsthand” how the stations and respite centers weren’t a viable solution, but he didn’t offer an alternative path forward.\n\nDuring an interview to mark his first 100 days in office, Johnson again declined to say when the city might have a plan to get families out of police stations.\n\nBus arrivals surged the following month, and the population at police stations swelled to more than 3,000.\n\nWhen arrivals began to slow in November, the number of people in stations finally started dropping. Soon after, the city began closing police stations as stopgap shelters. By mid-December, all migrants had left the stations.\n\nHowever, the victory in clearing out police stations came as Johnson and his administration faced criticism for other aspects of his handling of the crisis.\n\nShelter Conditions And Treatment Of Migrants\n\nIn the early days of his term, Johnson pledged new arrivals would be well taken care of in Chicago.\n\n“Everyone recognizes that the city of Chicago has been a real model and an example of how we treat people,” Johnson said in his visit to the 12th District station, according to the Sun-Times. “We have to make sure that we take care of residents and family members who are here while also making sure that families that wish to call the city of Chicago their home, that they are serviced, as well.”\n\nBut at the same time as families were living out of police stations, migrants and volunteers working the frontlines of the crisis sounded the alarm on poor conditions at some shelters, saying people were served moldy food, didn’t have hot water and weren’t allowed to accept donations from neighbors.\n\nCommunity organizers argued the city should be modeling its care of migrants after the systems they were creating. However, Johnson’s administration continued opening city-run shelters and didn’t bring community groups into the fold.\n\nIn September, Johnson’s team unveiled a new strategy that once again riled up critics: “base camps.” The mayor planned to move up to 2,000 migrants out of police stations into “winterized” encampments, run by the controversial company GardaWorld.\n\nMany alderpeople, volunteers and neighbors of the proposed camp sites were vehemently against the mayor’s plans. Some people held anti-immigrant sentiments, while others said such encampments wouldn’t be safe or dignified living conditions for migrants.\n\nThe base camp plan was ultimately scrapped at the behest of Gov. JB Pritzker, but the relief was short-lived for migrant advocates.\n\nIn December, tragedy struck the city’s largest migrant shelter when 5-year-old Jean Carlos Martinez Rivero died after falling ill. The child’s autopsy showed he had contracted several viruses and died from an infection that turned into sepsis.\n\nJean Carlos died just days after an investigation by Borderless Magazine detailed “inhumane conditions” inside the shelter — a warehouse converted into housing for over 2,000 families with children.\n\nVolunteers called for more transparency, oversight and partnership from the Mayor’s Office in light of these health concerns.\n\nThose calls were renewed this spring when measles cases were reported at the same city-run migrant shelter.\n\nWhat’s Next\n\nThe number of migrants staying in temporary shelters dropped dramatically through early 2024 as the city ramped up resettlement efforts and instituted a 60-day limit on shelter stays. But people continue arriving.\n\nOfficials have speculated the pace of buses arriving with migrants this summer could increase, especially with the nation’s top leaders converging on Chicago for the Democratic National Convention.\n\nConvention leaders have brushed off concerns that an influx of arrivals would affect the massive event, but in a recent interview with Block Club, Johnson said his administration is planning as best they can.\n\n“We are clearing out and decompressing shelters to create more room,” Johnson said. “We will have spaces if we have to, at a moment’s notice, open. We’ll be prepared to the best of our abilities. Now, look – there are some things that are beyond our control. We don’t know how many buses are going to come.”\n\nJohnson said state officials have also committed to opening and operating migrant shelters, similar to the state-run shelter that opened in Little Village early this year.\n\nIt’s unclear precisely where additional migrants would be housed if there was an increase in arrivals.\n\nJohnson’s team has repeatedly spoken about how difficult it is to find suitable buildings to convert into temporary migrant shelters. Five of the recently closed shelters are Park District buildings that have resumed hosting park programs.\n\nFunding the city’s response has also been a point of contention among neighbors and local officials, who worry city money is going toward new arrivals over longtime Chicago residents.\n\nMost recently, Johnson’s administration asked City Council to approve an additional $70 million toward the city’s care of migrants, just five months after allocating $150 million in the city’s budget to the new arrivals mission.\n\nThe funding was approved by alderpeople, but not without strong pushback from critics. Several alderpeople pointed to last summer’s destructive West Side flooding as an example of where city dollars could potentially be spent instead of the new arrivals mission.\n\nThe city’s attempt to balance the needs of new arrivals and existing neighbors will likely continue for the foreseeable future — and bleed into the next budget cycle — as there’s no indication of if or when buses of migrants might stop coming."
