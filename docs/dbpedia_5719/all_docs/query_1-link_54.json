        "text": "Drew Belline sharpened his culinary skills in New York City before returning back home to work at Bacchanalia, under iconic chef Anne Quatrano. He then partnered with another legendary chef, Ford Fry, to open Rocket Farm Restaurants. Belline, now vice president of culinary of Rocket Farm, and Fry run some of the city’s favorite restaurants, including Little Sparrow and Bar Blanc, Marcel, BeetleCat, St. Cecilia, and no. 246 as well as restaurants in Nashville and Houston.\n\nJohn Castellucci began his career in his family’s restaurant and helped them grow it into one of the city’s most respected restaurant groups: Castellucci Hospitality Group. His restaurant, Mujō, was recently awarded one MICHELIN star. After getting his education and training in the U.S. and Europe, Castellucci returned to home and showcased the best of Basque-inspired dishes that captivate diners at The Iberian Pig, Cooks & Soldiers, Double Zero, Mujō and Sugo.\n\nBrandon Chavannes is director of culinary for the Fifth Group Restaurants that include La Tavola, Lure and Ecco (with locations in Midtown and Buckhead). Chef Chavannes wholeheartedly believes in the power of food and seeks out ingredients with intention, striving to find the best quality and pursuing a deep connection with growers and artisans.\n\nTaylur Davis is the dynamic owner of Locale Island Eats in Halidom Eatery, a food court in East Atlanta. It is her second location after her popular Locale Caribbean at Politan Row in Colony Square. Known as a trailblazer due to her innovative take on chopped island meats including chicken and ox tails, she crafts easy-to-eat bowls that help guests experience a little tropical paradise in bustling Atlanta. The Locale Island Eats menu is a blend of her passion for island-inspired cuisine with a commitment to quality.\n\nCarla Fears has studied culinary trends and flavors from around the world, and she brings this knowledge and experience back to her hometown. Fears is the founder of Gourmet Street Foods where her culinary skills are front and center in pop-up events around town. Her repertoire clearly reflects her world travels and creative talents with menus such as an Irish Reuben sandwich, stuffed quail with green lentil salad, chicken satay and Korean BBQ shrimp platter.\n\nKevin Gillespie is one of the city’s most loved and respected chefs. He grew up in metro Atlanta and honed his craft at local restaurants such as the Ritz-Carlton, Woodfire Grill and TWO Urban Licks. He opened his first solo restaurant, Gunshow, to critical acclaim and was a semi-finalist in the James Beard Foundation’s “Rising Star Chef of the Year,” and later for “South’s Best New Restaurant” for his now-shuttered Revival. The opening of his latest restaurant, Nadair, a nod to his Scottish heritage and love of cooking over an open fire, is one of the most anticipated restaurant openings of 2024. He is the author of two acclaimed cookbooks: James Beard Award-winning “Fire in My Belly” and “Pure Pork Awesomeness.”\n\nTyler Haake is the executive chef at Indaco Atlanta, an elevated modern Italian concept that embraces Italy’s regional cuisine with modern and seasonal dishes using produce and meats from local farmers. The former chef of the Wrecking Bar and Argosy, Tyler has a passion for sustainable and local ingredients.\n\nChris Hall started his culinary career working at a local Pizza Hut and today he, along with his partners Ryan Turner and Todd Mussman, own and operate Unsukay Restaurant Group, which includes Muss & Turner’s, Local Three, Roshambo and MTH Pizza. He is the founding board member of The Giving Kitchen, which provides emergency assistance to food service workers.\n\n(Photo by Ryan Turner)\n\nRonald Hsu is the culinary director of the one-MICHELIN-star restaurant, Lazy Betty. Along with his partner, executive chef Aaron Phillips, they recently relocated the restaurant to Midtown. Hsu’s mother immigrated from Taiwan and opened a restaurant outside of Atlanta where he first worked and developed his love of cooking and hospitality.\n\nJared Hucks grew up in Brookhaven and is the owner/chef of The Alden, which received a mention from the 2023 MICHELIN Guide. Hucks practiced his culinary expertise around the world working in Sydney, the three-MICHELIN star Arzak in Spain and NOMA, which is the No. 1-rated restaurant in the world.\n\nA pioneer of Atlanta’s dining scene, Pano I. Karatassos, executive chef of Kyma, an upscale Greek restaurant, and corporate executive chef for the Buckhead Life Restaurant Group, which his father co-founded. Buckhead Life Restaurant Group consists of Kyma, Pricci, Atlanta Fish Market, Chops, Bistro Niko and Corner Cafe. He learned to cook by watching his grandmother work magic with Greek recipes in the kitchen and cooking in his father’s restaurants. He tutored under three of the country’s best chefs before returning to Atlanta. The author of “Modern Greek Cooking,” he also beat TV chef Bobby Flay with his signature dish, lamb pie.\n\nTony Manns boasts an extensive food and beverage background working in various acclaimed restaurants including Veni Vidi Vici, Little Alley Steak and Chops Lobster Bar. Manns now holds the position of corporate executive chef at C&S Seafood and Oyster Bar where he incorporates a wide variety of raw bar offerings, stand-out hors d’oeuvres, classic prime steaks, market fish and entrée specials at all three metro-Atlanta locations.\n\nTodd Rushing is a long-time culinary fixture in his hometown. He first started at the Peasant Restaurant Group alongside Bob Amick. Years later the pair formed Concentrics Restaurants that run TWO Urban Licks, Bully Boy and TAP, which are known for being chef-driven dining experiences. Concentrics also offers full-service design, development, consulting and management that provides food and beverage solutions for freestanding restaurants and hotels across the nation.\n\nJoe Schafer is vice president of culinary for Atlanta-based Electric Hospitality. With more than 25 years of experience, the James Beard Award nominee and Georgia native leads executive chefs and kitchen teams across all Electric Hospitality concepts: The Electric Room, Ladybird Grove & Mess Hall, Muchacho and Ranger Station. He also oversees the culinary programs for the company’s full-service events and catering group, Electric Events. He previously worked as a chef locally for King + Duke, Little Bach and Bacchanalia.\n\nTrevor Shankman may be one of Atlanta’s most unique chefs. Still in his early 20s, Shankman is the owner and chef of the Speak Easy Supper Club in Kennesaw, about 25 miles north of Atlanta. The club is named Maria, after his beloved grandmother who fled Cuba as a child and influenced his cooking and philosophy of life. The prix fixe dinner takes place at his late grandmother’s house and features eight to nine courses. The menu draws in elements of French and Japanese cooking as well as the Cuban cuisine he remembers as a child.\n\nJoey Ward is executive chef and owner of MICHELIN-recommended restaurants Southern Belle and Georgia Boy in Virginia Highland. He spent his childhood helping his grandfather cook and watching PBS cooking shows (after the cartoons, naturally). He also is an advocate of a service-inclusive model that aims for front and back-of-house pay-equity and a four-day work week. Ward is an outspoken advocate for causes like No Kid Hungry, mental health and addiction support groups targeted to the restaurant industry."
