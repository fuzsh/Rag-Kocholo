        "text": "Fan Reviews\n\nfearthewater\n\nFebruary 10th 2019\n\nIt was awesome! I really enjoyed it and i could take some Photos too. They played good songs like 'Void' or 'Stuck with me' (also the main stream songs like sweater weather..). Jesse had some great performance, Jer did his part damn good, Brandon got some hell of a beat, Mickey was cute and fantastic as always and Zeeko got some fine solo parts and was looking damn good. Only sad thing was that they had to go quite fast.. :( (btw sorry for my bad english skills lmao)\n\nBerlin, Germany@\n\nHuxley's Neue Welt\n\nChanel\n\nOctober 7th 2018\n\nThe setlist: perfect The girl behind me that kept catcalling Porches and at some point Jesse: not so perfect The girl who wouldn’t stop trying to move up when there was literally no where for her to go: Almost punched in the face Zac being right in front of me for 87% of the concert: EXCELLENT Jesse looking at me during Sadderdaze and Afraid: Sweet Jesus The drummer of Me and You: Wow\n\nNew York, NY@\n\nTerminal 5\n\nNadine\n\nSeptember 20th 2018\n\nFirst time seeing them live after years of them being my favorite band. They were absolutely incredible! Wish the show had gone longer and I honestly wish I'd spent the extra $10 so I can be closer, I think that would have made my experience even better. The venue was awesome though and I had no trouble hearing them clearly. Amazing experience and I'd see them over and over and over again if I had the money.\n\nLos Angeles, CA@\n\nGreek Theatre\n\nRoselyn\n\nJune 20th 2018\n\nIt’s was so awesome OMG!!! they were amazing I can’t explain. I’m kinda bummed out though they had no more long sleeve merch they had ran out and hoodies they had no more small 👎🏽 there was such a long line. But Jesse had stage dived at the end so cool. Some one also proposed on stage that was dope who wouldn’t want to be proposed at a nbhd concert!!! 😎😎 they were epic can’t wait to see them again in September!!!!!\n\nCharlotte, NC@\n\nThe Underground - Fillmore Charlotte\n\nUser\n\nJuly 27th 2017\n\nIt was a great show and the NBHD never disappoints! But the venue disappointed me. This was my first show at Bowery ballroom and from my friend's experience, he said they're very organized and is a good venue. The day of the show, it was not like that. An hour before doors are supposed to open, they started to let everyone in without warning, so it was a literal hoard! Then we had to go through the bar and wait to be let into the actual stage room, and again, we were let in without warning and it was literally a race! Very disappointed in Bowery ballroom. Overall, the NBHD performed amazingly and I got to meet Zach after the show which is nice because he's my favorite!\n\nNew York, NY@\n\nBowery Ballroom\n\nLicis\n\nJuly 26th 2017\n\nDissatisfied with the opening band, great band just different genre I think the band would had been great to open for a country style concert but not the neighbourhood unfortunately. You could see the disappointment and confusion in the crowd. Anyways THE NEIGHBOURHOOD though was great! They put on a amazing show, not so much as they did at the 2016 Microsoft Theatre venue but it was great, intimate, they played a couple new songs that are not out yet & I can't wait to add them in my Spotify playlist! Jesse did his things with the mic & overall super high energy. The NHBD for the second time have given me a blast!👌🏽😍😎 love them to death! Now regarding the theatre...oh God...there was \"no water and no ice\" at the time it ended, mind you it ended early as heck at 10pm. Poor guys just wanted to go home but boooo awful customer service for a hot day. Venue was cute though. And the NHBD performance made up for everything else.\n\nLos Angeles, CA@\n\nThe Roxy\n\nSara\n\nMay 12th 2016\n\nSo the neighbourhood did an AMAZING performance. The only down fall was the absolute chaos of the crowd. First there was a fight after several attempts of people pushing, and then as soon as the band came out, every single person had their phone out. Such a disappointment. Had to move to the back so I could enjoy the concert from my point of view instead of the next persons phone.\n\nCharlotte, NC@\n\nThe Fillmore Charlotte\n\nShinowa\n\nApril 28th 2016\n\nI wish I could give more than 5 stars. This was such an amazing show. The crowd was by far one of the most intense, and I saw more people being pulled out than any other concert before, so that was a little concerning, but other than that it was so worth it. And after I waited with a friend until we were the last two standing to get a picture with some of the band. I ended up getting pictures with Zach, Brandon, and Jeremy. All such humble dudes. They killed out there last night. And the opener was awesome!! I'm still in such disbelief about how amazing that concert was.\n\nSeattle, WA@\n\nShowbox SoDo\n\nApril 8th 2016\n\nTHIS CONCERT WAS AMAZING. The only down side, Jesse & none of the other band members even made contact with their fans or even acknowledged their fans after the show when they were loading onto their tour bus & some people waited over 2 hours after the show with stuff for them to sign. They all just looked away and down and walked straight onto the bus as fans were calling their names. One of the members, Brandon, did give and little smile and wave to both sides, but each of the other members just ignored everyone out there, which to me was pretty rude bc w/o these fans they wouldn't be where they are ://\n\nMilwaukee, WI@\n\nThe Pabst Theater\n\nBarbara\n\nFebruary 24th 2016\n\nIt was the third time I visited The Neighborhood concert in Moscow and this time was unfortunately not the best one :(There was a huge crowd of young crazy teen girls which were not adequate at all. And concerning the band: this time there wasn't a communication between the band and the fans, that's sad :(And the quality of the sound was bad (the need to change the venue next time in Moscow 'cause all the time they came - they play in one club with horrible sound)But anyway I enjoyed the show, especially when they played old songs which means a lot <3\n\nMoscow, Russia@\n\nYotaspace\n\nUser\n\nFebruary 8th 2016\n\nThe band was awesome but they took a while to come out and it was soo cramped and everyone was sweaty and pushing a lot. Also they took our water bottles before we came in so a lot of people seemed like they were overheating and we couldn't go get water because you'd lose your spot. At one point the whole band except Jesse literally walked right behind us in line and got in a car, that was pretty awesome but they wouldn't take a picture with anyone\n\nCharlotte, NC@\n\nThe Fillmore Charlotte\n\nAmber\n\nFebruary 8th 2016\n\nShow was amazing but the crowd should have been controlled better. Everyone was squished together like sardine and when the security asked everyone to step back they did but shortly after we were up against the barricades falling on top of each other. It got so hot and intense in that crowd multiple people fainted including myself. Over all the crowd was horrible but the show was amazing like always.\n\nDallas, TX@\n\nSouth Side Ballroom\n\nFebruary 8th 2016\n\nI thought the show was very good. the entire night was a wonderful experience. I felt as though the venue didn't do all they could for the sound and it was a little bit quieter than it should have been, but other than that the band did all they could to make the time pass quickly and put on the best show they could. will be going to see them again\n\nMilwaukee, WI@\n\nThe Pabst Theater\n\nTamera\n\nJanuary 18th 2016\n\nIt was absolutely incredible! Whilst waiting in the queue Brandon, Mikey and Jeremy walked past and Jesse's girlfriend Devon walked past us a bunch of times! Also Penn Badgley's band MOTHXR were the support act and a bunch of us got pictures with him outside whilst we were waiting. And after the show the first support act Kevin Abstract took photos with us and he was super nice! The concert itself was absolutely incredible and the venue was beautiful! Definitely one of the best concerts I've been to in a while!\n\nBirmingham, United Kingdom@\n\nO2 Institute Birmingham\n\nfleuresthetique\n\nNovember 27th 2015\n\nThe Neighbourhood is one of my favourite bands, if not the favourite band. Their music with the deep lyrics is extraordinary and have the ability to move your heart. However, at yesterday's concert I felt like they didn't care about their fans very much. Without saying anything at all, they simply went on stage and played one song after the other. As for me, a friendly hello and goodbye would have been nice to hear. All in all I enjoyed the concert, the music was stunning, the crowd went wild and their sunglasses were just on fleek. ? But a little more effort from the band to create an even better atmosphere would have been nice.\n\nZurich, Switzerland@\n\nHarterei\n\nUser\n\nSeptember 19th 2015\n\nIt was okay. They sound better on album and this girl was so hipster and wouldn't take off her beanie (even though it blocked my friends and I view) because it would ruin her look. Audience was rude and people kept making out. The pot smell wouldn't bother me if they offered it out or didn't blow it in my face every two seconds. People are annoying. I'm in a bad mood\n\nLas Vegas, NV@\n\nBoulevard Pool at the Cosmopolitan Hotel\n\nColin\n\nJune 25th 2014\n\nI prefer the band's live sound to recorded. Listening to their sound on recordings is very thick and produced. almost crowded if that makes sense. Live they are tight, and clear. I don't know if it was specific to the venue, but the mix in Dallas seemed drum and vocal heavy. These guys are tight like a gnats ass live and good rock and roll band, to boot. If you like this band, you will definitely come away from the live show with a new appreciation for a sound they have that isn't on a record.\n\nDallas, TX@\n\nSouth Side Ballroom\n\nWendolynne\n\nMay 9th 2014\n\nIT WAS FUCKING AMAZING. THE OPENER THE WHITE ARROW WAS A GREAT BAND. THEY ARE SO NICE AND HIP THEIR MUSIC IS HELLA DOPE. AND THE DJ TO INTRODUCE TEAVIS WAS DOPE AND KNEW WHAT WAS UP AND GOT US ALL PUMPED UP AND THEN TRAVIS GOT KN SO TRAVIS SCOTT WAS GREAT TWO BUT WTF HE GOT PISSED OFF BECAUSE THE MICROPHONE STOPED WORKING AND WALKED OFF STAGE FOR 5 MIN LIKE THATS UNPROFESSIONAL AND NOT COOL THAT PISSED SOME PEOPLE OFF. AND THE NBHD WAS FUCKING GREAT. BEST CONCERT OF MY LIFE . SHIT WAS LIVe\n\nAustin, TX@\n\nStubbs\n\nuser9619808\n\nFebruary 13th 2014\n\nThe Neighbourhood themselves were incredible but we had to wait insanely long for the first opening act and then about 45 minutes after the first for the second opening act, neither of which were that great. Also The Neighbourhood's setlist was shorter than I would've liked, especially since we had to wait so long. It would've been nice to have security guards passing out water as well considering how packed together everyone was.\n\nNew York, NY@\n\nRumsey Playfield, Central Park\n\nMelissa\n\nSeptember 9th 2013\n\nThe Nbhd was amazing as always, I loved the little light show they added to this tour, it went really well with the music, and it wasn't too extravagant so you could still focus completely on their music and their performance. hated the crowd though, it was obvious that most everybody there was there solely for Imagine Dragons, nobody stood up for the Nbhd which forced me to stay seated or else the people behind me wouldn't be able to see... should've done it anyways I guess. Their show at Fitz was by far more enjoyable only because of the crowd... and well their music was much louder there.\n\nHouston, TX@\n\nThe Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion\n\nView More Fan Reviews"
