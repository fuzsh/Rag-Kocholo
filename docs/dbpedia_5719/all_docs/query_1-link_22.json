[CW // Sexual assault]\n\nCONTENT WARNING: This article contains details of sexual assault that some readers may find triggering and disturbing.\n\nThe Neighbourhood have fired their drummer Brandon Fried after fellow artist María Sardoya accused him of sexual assault.\n\nYesterday (Nov 13), The Marías singer María Sardoya took to her Instagram stories to call out The Neighbourhood's Brandon Fried for sexually assaulting her. She wrote: \"I was at a bar last night, and I was groped under the table by Brandon Fried. It was one of the most uncomfortable things I’ve ever experienced. I felt an invasion of my space, privacy and body.\"\n\nMaría then tagged The Neighbourhood and wrote: \"Y'all need a new drummer, this guy is a complete creep\". Now, the rock band have released a statement in response to María and also revealed that they have removed Brandon from the group.\n\nREAD MORE: Rex Orange County charged with multiple accounts of sexual assault\n\nTaking to Twitter shortly after María posted about the sexual assault, The Neighbourhood wrote: \"We are grateful to María for coming forward. We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behaviour towards women. As a result of Brandon’s actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighbourhood.\"\n\nBrandon has also personally apologised to María on Instagram stories. He wrote: \"I am so terribly sorry to María. My actions were inexcusable and intolerable. They are not reflective of who I am as a person, but clearly a reflection of who I become while under the influence.\"\n\nBrandon added: \"It is evident that I must address my problems with alcohol and substance abuse, which I am now seeking help for. I want to apologize to women who have been victims of any behavior that has left them feeling uncomfortable or violated.\"\n\nHe ended by writing: \"I am also sorry to The Neighbourhood and our fans for letting them down.\"\n\nBrandon played as a drummer for The Neighbourhood for over eight years between 2014 and 2022. As it stands, The Neighbourhood are yet to replace him. We shall keep you informed with any updates.\n\nIf you - or anyone you know - needs help, please contact the following:"
