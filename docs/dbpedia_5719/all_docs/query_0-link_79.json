        "text": "As the Poway Historical and Memorial Society gets ready to celebrate its 60th anniversary, members have been reflecting on the town’s progress and the significance of keeping local history alive.\n\nPoway history has been documented by residents and volunteers since around 1888, when the community was considered a stagecoach stop for travelers between Escondido and San Diego, said Historical Society President Chris Olps.\n\nBefore the nonprofit Historical Society formed in 1964, a group of seniors with firsthand knowledge of Poway who called themselves The Old Timers Club met to share memories and swap stories, Olps said. They recalled a time when Old Pomerado Road was the center of town where the Big Stone Lodge operated a bed and breakfast next to a general store and stagecoach stop.\n\n“The Historical Society cataloged their stories and documented changes in (today’s) city and what the history of the city itself was,” he said. “Then the addition of the Poway Heritage Museum created a more formal location for everything.”\n\nThe museum, at 14114 Midland Road in Old Poway Park, got its start as the Old Poway district was renovated in the mid- to late-1980s, Olps said. It became a repository for all things Poway as people donated items that had belonged to their parents and grandparents, and docents volunteered to talk about the exhibits and answer questions, he said.\n\n“Visitors ask all kinds of questions about where the exhibits came from, what things had happened in Poway,” he said. “If we can’t find the answer or don’t know the answer we can reach out to someone else. With all of us together we have knowledge of a decent amount of history, and some people have been here longer than I have.”\n\nOne of the nine active Poway Historical and Memorial Society board members is Gwenmarie Hilleary, a docent who gives guided tours at Old Poway Park’s historic Nelson House. She and several other women tell visitors about the history of the Nelson House and describe the life of women from the 1890s through the early 1900s.\n\n“We’re trying to get people to understand we weren’t so different and that women’s roles were important,” Hilleary said. “Women were innovative and creative. We try to give people an awareness of that time and the role that women had.”\n\nAnne E. Smith was a prospector who reported finding the best local specimen of gold assaying at $4.13 per ton, and Mrs. G.W. Butterfield was a leader in fundraising efforts to construct Templars Hall at Old Poway Park, Hilleary said.\n\nPeople of that period built and used machinery to get work done without electricity. One example was the foot-pumped sewing machines that changed some women’s lives because they didn’t have to sew clothes by hand, she said.\n\nSears, Roebuck and Co. was also instrumental at that time because they could deliver goods by stagecoach so residents didn’t have to travel to San Diego, Hilleary said.\n\n“Sears built railheads, they had huge warehouses and major distribution systems,” she said. “They gave up the model to sell in brick-and-mortar stores and lost their business. The model of Sears is alive today, but it’s known as Amazon.”\n\nAs visitors tour the Nelson House they can see how the U.S. government encouraged people to settle in Poway Valley by offering homesteads, Hilleary said. If settlers stayed on the land for five years they would get 40 acres of property, she said.\n\nHilleary has her own historical connection to the community — Hilleary Community Park and the nearby Hilleary Place in Poway — are named for her family.\n\n“There was a fellow named George Hilleary who was from Iowa and he had 12 children, one of whom was Louis Hilleary, who was a doctor in Poway,” she said. “Another son, Arthur, went to Los Angeles and I’m a descendent of the Arthur side of the family.”\n\nThe 40-year-old Olps has lived in Poway since 1990. Now a senior systems engineer who drafts and reviews installation drawings for Navy ships, he recalls moving to Poway from Northern California with his family when he was nearly 7 years old.\n\nHis family lived in one of the first four homes built in The Grove neighborhood near Poway High School on Espola Road. There were dirt lots all around in what was formerly an avocado grove, he said.\n\n“We got to see the entire community be developed and see the neighbors move in,” he said. “For me, Poway is the best place for family and kids. You have a small town feel without it being a small town.”\n\nOlps joined the Poway Historical and Memorial Society Board of Directors in 2021 after volunteering for city activities and helping out at Garden Road Elementary School where his son Caleb Olps, now 13, was a student, he said.\n\nThose connections led to encounters with the late Mary Shepardson, a member of Poway’s first City Council following the city’s incorporation on Dec. 1, 1980 and its first female mayor who served from 1982-83. Shepardson had been an avid historian who was a founding member of the Poway Historical and Memorial Society.\n\nShepardson, who had lived in Poway since age 3, passed away of natural causes at age 77 on Jan. 22, 2023.\n\nThe Historical Society’s vice president, Torrey Powers, took Shepardson’s place as president on an interim basis. Then just over a year ago Olps was elected to a two-year term.\n\n“Mary knew a ton of things about the community, what happened, how it happened,” said Olps, adding that she was a prolific writer about Poway’s history who wrote for the Historical Society’s newsletter and penned the Poway News Chieftain’s “Then and Now” column.\n\n“Some of her articles are at the Poway Heritage Museum. We have a binder from her donated a few months before she passed. There were diary entries from when she was a kid describing her time in Poway.”\n\nShepardson had invited Olps to attend the Historical Society’s meetings and recruited him to support their computers and other technology devices.\n\nHilleary and Olps are in the midst of preparing for the Historical Society’s 60th anniversary celebration that will be held over two consecutive Saturdays at Old Poway Park. On Sept. 7, the nonprofit will host a day of family events including steer roping demonstrations, games and music. The following week, on Sept. 14, the Historical Society will present the play, “A Hearty Poway Legend,” in Templars Hall.\n\nThe play for adult audiences will be performed at 2 p.m., 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. and bring to life a true tale of Old Poway featuring cowboys, life at the stagecoach stop, and “unusual doings” that leads to a Sheriff’s investigation.\n\nThe Nelson House located adjacent to the park’s railroad barn will be open both days of the anniversary celebration from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\n“There’s a lot of history in the community,” Hilleary said. “There’s usually a story behind it, and most of the time it’s a pretty interesting story.”"
