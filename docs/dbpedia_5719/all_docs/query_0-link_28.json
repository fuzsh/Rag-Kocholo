        "text": "The Neighbourhood is an American rock band formed in Newbury Park, California, in 2011. The band is composed of vocalist Jesse Rutherford, guitarists Jeremy Freedman and Zach Abels, and bassist Mikey Margott. Drummer Brandon Fried was also part of the band from 2014 until 2022. After releasing two EPs, I'm Sorry... and Thank You, the Neighbourhood released its debut album I Love You. in 2013 via Columbia Records. The album was preceded by their 2012 single \"Sweater Weather\"—their only single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 14 in 2013 and re-surging in popularity nearly a decade later on radio airplay and Spotify from becoming a viral phenomenon on TikTok.\n\nThe same year, the EP The Love Collection was released, followed by a mixtape titled #000000 & #FFFFFF in 2014. The band's second studio album, Wiped Out! was released in 2015. In March 2018, the group's self-titled third studio album was released, preceded by the release of two EPs: Hard in September 2017, which briefly charted on the Billboard 200, and To Imagine in January 2018. After the release of the album, the tracks from the extended plays not included on the final track listing were compiled in another EP, Hard to Imagine. The album Hard to Imagine and another EP, Ever Changing, were further merged into the LP Hard to Imagine the Neighbourhood Ever Changing. In February 2022, it was reported that the band are taking a hiatus.\n\nLead singer Jesse Rutherford has dabbled with a solo career since 2016, and eventually signed a solo contract with Atlantic Records in March 2023. The band has been called a one-hit wonder for their biggest hit song, \"Sweater Weather\".\n\nHistory[edit][]\n\nFormation and I Love You. (2011–2013)[edit][]\n\nThe Neighbourhood was formed in August 2011 by the singer Jesse Rutherford, guitarists Zachary Abels and Jeremiah Freedman, bass guitarist Michael Margott and drummer Bryan \"Olivver\" Sammis. The members of The Neighbourhood chose the British spelling of \"neighbourhood\" on the advice of their manager, in order to distinguish themselves from a band already using the American spelling; hence, their song names also use the British spelling.\n\nIn early 2012, the Neighbourhood released \"Female Robbery\" and \"Sweater Weather\". In May 2012, the band unveiled their debut self-released extended play titled I'm Sorry... for free download, produced by Justyn Pilbrow. In December 2012, the Neighbourhood released their second EP, Thank You,.\n\nThe band performed at Coachella in 2013, anticipating their debut album I Love You., which was premiered on April 16, 2013, via Rolling Stone and officially released on April 23, 2013, via Columbia Records. It debuted at number 39 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 9,000 units in its first week. It was preceded by the lead single \"Sweater Weather\", which music video was released on March 5, 2013. They made their first televised performance of the song on June 27, 2013, at Jimmy Kimmel Live. \"Sweater Weather\" topped the charts in early June 2013, reaching number one on Billboard Alternative Songs chart and breaking the top ten on Billboard Heatseekers Songs chart.\n\nThe band went on tour opening for Imagine Dragons in July and September 2013. The Neighbourhood also made two appearances in Eastern Canada during the summer of 2013. They played as one of the headliners of Toronto's Edgefest on July 31, 2013, and then a few days later played at Canada's largest music festival, Osheaga, in Montreal on August 4. The Neighbourhood performed at Atlanta's Music Midtown on September 21, 2013.\n\n#000000 & #FFFFFF and Wiped Out!

It was hosted by DJ Drama and features guest appearances by YG, Dej Loaf, French Montana, Danny Brown, G-Eazy and others. The mixtape was officially released for streaming and download on November 22, 2017.\n\nIn August 2015, the band announced the upcoming October 30 release of their second album Wiped Out!. It was preceded by the lead single \"R.I.P. 2 My Youth\" and reached the number 13 position on the US Billboard 200. The band embarked on a European tour in November 2015 and on an American tour in May and June 2016 to support the album.\n\nHard to Imagine, self-titled album, Chip Chrome & the Mono-Tones and hiatus (2017–present)[edit][]\n\nOn September 21, 2017, the Neighbourhood released the EP Hard, which reached number 183 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Another EP called To Imagine was released on January 12, 2018. The band later announced their self-titled third studio album The Neighbourhood, released March 9, 2018, which included tracks from the previous extended plays, including the lead single \"Scary Love\". After the release, the tracks from the extended plays that were not included on the final tracklisting were collected in another EP called Hard to Imagine. The band then released the complete edition of the album, titled Hard to Imagine the Neighbourhood Ever Changing which featured all songs released from Hard, To Imagine, The Neighbourhood, and Ever Changing, except the two tracks \"Revenge\" and \"Too Serious\".\n\nOn August 16, 2019, they premiered a music video along with their single, \"Middle of Somewhere\". On October 10, 2019, the Neighbourhood's single, \"Yellow Box\" was released and featured on an action game, Death Stranding.
