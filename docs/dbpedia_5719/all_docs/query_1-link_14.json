        "text": "The Neighbourhood has parted ways with their drummer Brandon Fried after he was accused of groping The Marías frontwoman.\n\nOn Sunday, María Zardoya posted on her Instagram Story, writing: \"I was at a bar last night, and I was groped under the table by Brandon Fried, the drummer of The Neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"It was one of the most uncomfortable things I've ever experienced. I felt an invasion of my space, privacy and body,\" Zardoya wrote.\n\nShe also tagged The Neighbourhood's social media, voicing that the band needs \"a new drummer\" and calling Fried \"a complete creep.\"\n\nHours after her post, the indie rock band — which is also comprised of singer Jesse Rutherford, guitarists Jeremy Freedman and Zach Abels and bassist Mikey Margot — announced Fried would no longer be with the group, known for their songs \"Sweater Weather\" and \"Daddy Issues.\"\n\n'DWTS' Cheryl Burke reveals sexual, mental abuse throughout dance career on 'Red Table Talk'\n\n\"We are grateful to Maria for coming forward. We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behavior towards women,\" the band wrote. \"As a result of Brandon’s actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighbourhood.\"\n\nFried shared a statement Sunday, publicly apologizing to Zardoya. \"I am so terribly sorry to Maria. My actions were inexcusable and intolerable. They are not reflective of who I am as a person, but clearly a reflection of who I become while under the influence,\" he wrote on his Instagram Story.\n\nFilmmaker Paul Haggis ordered by jury to pay $7.5M to woman in rape civil trial\n\n\"It is evident that I must address my problems with alcohol and substance abuse, which I am now seeking help for,\" he continued.\n\nThe drummer also apologized to The Neighborhood fans and to any other women \"who have been victims of any behavior that has left them feeling uncomfortable or violated.\"\n\nOne other woman has accused Fried of sexual assault on social media since Zardoya came forward with the allegation.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to The Neighbourhood, Fried, Columbia Records and reps for Zardoya.\n\nIf you are a survivor of sexual assault, RAINN offers support through the National Sexual Assault Hotline (800.656.HOPE & online.rainn.org)."
