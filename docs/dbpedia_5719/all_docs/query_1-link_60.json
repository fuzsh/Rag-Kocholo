McCoy Theatre in Middletown, Virginia.\n\nThis play isn’t just another performance—it’s a tapestry of stories collected over a decade from the Black-owned business that became a cornerstone of Winchester’s community. Do’zia has masterfully interwoven these narratives into a compelling story that follows Azi Wells, a prodigal daughter returning home to bid farewell to Ruth’s Tea Room, a place that granted her and many others a sense of freedom and belonging. As Azi walks through the doors of the tea room one last time, she is met by memories that have come to life, each a poignant reminder of this inclusive space’s impact on its community.\n\nRuth’s Tea Room is more than just a backdrop in this dramatization; it represents a real place, a genuine historic site in Winchester known for welcoming everyone with open arms. The play breathes life into the highs and lows of Ruth’s Tea Room, highlighting its profound influence on the community and its residents. The combination of Bleu Do’zia’s storytelling and the talented cast, including Pamela Foster, Peter Hibl, Eric Ibarra, Eric Lee Santiful, Joanna Schilling, and Ariel Scott, promises to transport audiences into a world where grief, love, and the strength of community are explored through the lens of theatrical artistry.\n\nAdding to the richness of the production is an accompanying art exhibition titled “The Brokenness of Grief and Time” by local artist Maddie Jaques. This exhibition will be on display during the show, providing an immersive artistic experience that complements the play’s themes.\n\nThe opening night on September 13th will begin with a reception at 6 p.m., offering an opportunity for the audience to engage with the art and the artists before the show. Following each performance, audiences will have the chance to participate in post-show discussions with the cast and crew, giving them a deeper insight into the play’s themes and the creative process behind it. These discussions foster a stronger connection between the audience and the performance, allowing for reflection and understanding beyond the theater.\n\n“Ruth’s Tea Room” is not just a play; it’s a celebration of community, memory, and the power of storytelling. As part of the Selah Theatre Project’s mission to ignite contemplation and conversation, this production serves as a platform for diverse voices, encouraging the audience to pause, reflect, and engage with the arts in a meaningful way.\n\nPerformance Information:\n\nLocation: William H. McCoy Theatre, Alson Smith Hall, Laurel Ridge Community College, 173 Skirmisher Lane, Middletown, VA 22645\n\nDates and Times:\n\nFriday, September 13 @ 7 PM\n\nSaturday, September 14 @ 7 PM\n\nSunday, September 15 @ 2 PM\n\nFriday, September 20 @ 7 PM\n\nSaturday, September 21 @ 2 PM & 7 PM\n\nTicket Price: General Admission – $15\n\nTickets Available At: Selahtheatreproject.org/season\n\nDon’t miss this chance to experience an unforgettable evening of storytelling, art, and community at “Ruth’s Tea Room.” Your attendance supports local theater and the continued enrichment of the arts in our community.\n\nSamuels Public Library is abuzz with excitement as it prepares to host its much-anticipated annual event, Samicon, on September 21. This year’s theme, “Libraries Open Up a World of Magic,” is inspired by the enchanting world of Harry Potter. It promises a day filled with spellbinding activities, engaging presentations, and magical moments for all ages.\n\nA Magical Experience for All\n\nRachel Roman, the new organizer of Samicon, is stepping into big shoes as she takes over from the event’s former coordinator, Erin Rooney. “It’s been fun to learn about it,” Rachel shared enthusiastically. She’s excited about this year’s theme and the wide array of activities planned. “We’re going to have a lot of different vendors, presentations with local authors, games, scavenger hunts, escape rooms, and more,” she said. And yes, the entire event is free to the public.\n\nExciting Guests and Prizes\n\nThis year’s Samicon will feature notable guest authors, including John Gallagher, creator of the popular Max Meow series, and Ben Hatke, a local talent known for his Zita the Spacegirl graphic novels. “We’re very excited to have both of them be there,” Rachel said. Attendees can look forward to meeting these authors, getting books signed, and hearing them discuss their work.\n\nAmong the many exciting prizes up for grabs is a specially crafted wand donated by Alivans, a well-known wand-making company. The intricate design of the wand, along with other Harry Potter-themed gift certificates, will surely be a hit among fans.\n\nA Day Full of Fun and Fantasy\n\nThe event kicks off at 10 a.m. and runs until 5 p.m., giving attendees plenty of time to enjoy everything Samicon has to offer. From exploring the library’s various themed areas to participating in the costume contest, there’s something for everyone. “You can come dressed up in any costume and enter a costume contest or just come as you are and still participate,” Rachel noted. While the event is all about fun, it’s also a day for the community to come together and celebrate creativity and imagination.\n\nA Library Like No Other\n\nSamuels Public Library continues to be a hub of activity and community engagement. Besides Samicon, the library offers a range of resources and programs, from online databases and DVDs to special events like garden programs and memory libraries. “This library is such a gem,” Mike McCool from the Royal Examiner noted\n\nAs the countdown to Samicon begins, the library staff is gearing up for what promises to be a magical day. Whether you’re a Harry Potter fan, a lover of fantasy, or just looking for a fun day out with the family, Samicon at Samuels Public Library is the place to be on September 21.\n\nMark your calendars and prepare for a day of magic, creativity, and community spirit at Samicon 2024!\n\nTown Talk is a series on the Royal Examiner where we will introduce you to local entrepreneurs, businesses, non-profit leaders, and political figures who influence Warren County.

At National Night Out, beginning at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, August 6, at the Gazebo on the corner of Main and Chester Street, the Front Royal Police Department organized and hosted an event designed to show the public a good time and educate them about what our community partners like CBP do.\n\nWith activities and food and drink for sale, the Gazebo had an extra special atmosphere as a CBP agent demonstrated to a crowd the process by which trained canines detect illegal material. A few suitcases were arranged in a row, and an officer named Ice was tasked with sniffing out which one contained the contraband. The public learned about how the direction of the wind impacts the process and, after the demonstration, were invited to ask questions, like, are people allowed to pet the dogs, to which the answer was yes, upon request, and then from the shoulders down. CBP is a culture in which these animals are valued for their skills and the service they provide.\n\n“Every year, National Night Out takes this opportunity to celebrate all of our public safety and public health partners in the community,” said Director of Community Development and Tourism Lizi Lewis. “The Town of Front Royal’s police department throws this party where we invite the whole community to come out and meet these partners, and we have an opportunity for kids and adults to engage with them in a safe and accessible way. They get to take home some fun stuff, they get to listen to a great band, eat at some great food trucks. It’s almost like a block party environment. And we like that because that’s who we are as a community.”\n\nLocated near the 4-H Center, the CBP’s Field Operations Canine Academy is known throughout the nation as the place where the agency’s canines are trained. According to Branch Chief Jason Kropiewnicki, the agency has over five hundred trained animals who perform various tasks, including detecting human stowaways at airports. People may not realize the critical role the agency and its canine officers play on a day-to-day basis, and Tuesday night was an opportunity for them to step into the light. “It’s one of my favorite events,” Sheriff Crystal Cline said. Warren County Sheriff’s Office has the honor of coming alongside the Front Royal Police Department to be a presence at this event, which the FRPD has been organizing for about six years. “Them bringing it to town and rocking it every single year: I wouldn’t be anywhere else tonight.”\n\nLabor Day weekend is almost here, and with it comes the excitement of the Appaloosa Festival. Held at Skyline Ranch Resort, this vibrant event promises music, fun, and community spirit, marking its ninth official year. Founded by the band Scythian, the festival has grown into a beloved tradition, drawing crowds and top-tier talent from all over.\n\nA Homegrown Dream\n\nDan Fedoryka, a founding member of Scythian and a Front Royal native, shared the festival’s journey. “We started out in the DC area, but my heart was always here in Front Royal,” he said. “This place is stunningly beautiful, even compared to places like Austria and the Alps where I’ve lived. We saw a gap in the market for a Bluegrass Americana camping festival and decided to fill it.”\n\nThe festival began modestly with 3,500 attendees but quickly gained traction. Fedoryka credits their touring experience with helping them spot emerging talent. “We had Billy Strings perform when he was just a guy with a guitar. Now he’s a star. Molly Tuttle played our main stage and went on to win a Grammy. It’s incredible to see these artists grow.”\n\nA Star-Studded Lineup\n\nThis year’s lineup features a mix of seasoned musicians and rising stars. Highlights include:\n\nCarbon Leaf: A Virginia band renowned for their performances, they’re the only independent band invited to the Americana Music Awards.\n\nShadowgrass: Friends with Billy Strings; they often share the stage with him.\n\nTop House: This band has sold out 35 shows in a row and will open for Molly Tuttle at the Ryman.\n\nJig Jam: Hailing from Ireland, they blend bluegrass with Irish music and have been nominated for the Momentum Band of the Year by the International Bluegrass Music Awards.\n\nAshes & Arrows: Known from “America’s Got Talent,” they’re quickly rising in fame.\n\nKat Higgins: A standout, Higgins has written two number-one hits, one of which was nominated for Country Music Song of the Year. She’s now signed to Kenny Chesney’s new record label.\n\nFedoryka beamed with pride as he discussed these artists. “We see the ‘it’ factor. This year’s lineup is our best yet.”\n\nA Family-Friendly Affair\n\nThe festival isn’t just about music. It’s designed to be a family-friendly event with something for everyone. “We have a massive kid zone with inflatables, face painting, and stages for children’s shows,” said Fedoryka. “Kids 12 and under get in free because we want to inspire the next generation of musicians.”\n\nThere are also workshops where attendees can learn from the performers. “You could be three feet away from a Grammy-winning artist giving a guitar lesson,” Fedoryka added.\n\nFood, Drink, and More\n\nFoodies and craft beverage enthusiasts will be delighted by the offerings at the festival. “We have 30 craft vendors, numerous food vendors, and unique partnerships for exclusive festival drinks,” Fedoryka explained. “Rappahannock Cellars is producing an Appaloosa wine, Vibrissa is creating two private labels for us, and Old Town Cidery is making an Appaloosa cider. It’s unlike any other festival.”\n\nFor those looking for a more exclusive experience, the VIP area offers heavy hors d’oeuvres, free drinks during happy hour, and a chance to mingle with the musicians.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThe Appaloosa Festival is more than just a local event. It’s becoming a destination. “People come from all over, and it’s great for local tourism,” Fedoryka said. “We have great support from the town and our sponsors. It’s really a community effort.”\n\nDon’t Miss Out!\n\nMark your calendars for August 31st to September 1st, and head to Skyline Ranch Resort for an unforgettable experience.
