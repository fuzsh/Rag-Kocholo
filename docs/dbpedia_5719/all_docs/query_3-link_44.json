        "text": "The Neighborhood has fired Brandon Fried.\n\nThe rock group announced that they have ousted Brandon, who was their drummer, after allegations came out that he had groped Maria Zardoya of the band The Marias.\n\nThe allegation was made public on Sunday (November 13) when Maria took to social media to drop the bombshell that Brandon had groped her. She wrote on her Instagram Story:\n\n“I was at a bar last night, and i was groped under the table by brandon fried, the drummer of the neighbourhood. it was one of the most uncomfortable things i’ve ever experienced. i felt an invasion of my space, privacy and body.\n\n@thenbhd ya’ll need a new drummer, this guy is a complete creep.”\n\nShortly afterwards, The Neighborhood likewise took to social media to announce that they had fired Brandon. They made the announcement on the band’s Instagram Story:\n\n“We are grateful to Maria for coming forward. We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behavior towards women.\n\nAs a result of Brandon’s actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighborhood.”\n\nJust minutes after the band’s announcement, Brandon shared a message to apologize for his actions. He wrote:\n\n“I am so terribly sorry to Maria. My actions were inexcusable and intolerable. They re not reflective of who I am as a person, but clearly a reflection of who I become while under the influence.”\n\nHe went on to say that he was now seeking help:\n\n“It is evident that I musta address my problems with alcohol and substance abuse, which I am now seeking help for. I want to apologize to women who have been victims of any behavior that has left them feeling uncomfortable or violated.\n\nI am so sorry to The Neighborhood and our fans for letting them down.”\n\nRelated Posts"
