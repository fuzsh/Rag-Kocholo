        "text": "Rock band The Neighbourhood have booted their drummer Brandon Fried after he was slapped with a groping allegation.\n\nMaria Zardoya, who is the front-woman of indie band The Marías, accused the drummer, 32, of unsolicited lewd behavior, saying it was “one of the most uncomfortable things” that had ever happened to her.\n\n“I was at a bar last night, and I was groped under the table by Brandon Fried, the drummer of The Neighbourhood. It was one of the most uncomfortable things I’ve ever experienced. I felt an invasion of my space, privacy and body,” Zardoya wrote on her Instagram Story.\n\nShe then told the band they “need a new drummer, this guy is a complete creep.”\n\nNot long after her shocking post, the band announced Fried was no longer a part of The Neighbourhood on Sunday night.\n\n“We are grateful to Maria for coming forward. We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behavior towards women,” the “Sweater Weather” hitmakers wrote.\n\n“As a result of Brandon’s actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighbourhood.”\n\nFried took accountability for his actions, apologizing to the singer in a statement on Instagram.\n\n“I am so terribly sorry to Maria. My actions were inexcusable and intolerable,” the 32-year-old wrote. “They are not reflective of who I am as a person, but clearly a reflection of who I become while under the influence.”\n\nFried said he “must address my problems with alcohol and substance abuse,” before revealing he is now “seeking help.”\n\n“I want to apologize to women who have been victims of any behavior that has left them feeling uncomfortable or violated,” he continued. “I am so sorry to The Neighbourhood and our fans for letting them down.”\n\nThe California rock band was formed in 2011, and consists of guitarists Jeremy Freedman and Zach Abels, bassist Mikey Margot and singer Jesse Rutherford.\n\nFried had joined the band in 2014.\n\nThe band has released four studio albums, with their most recent release being “Chip Chrome & the Mono-Tones” in 2020."
