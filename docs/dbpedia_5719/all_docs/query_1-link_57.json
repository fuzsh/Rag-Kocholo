        "text": "Attended the Rally yesterday. Some pictures that I took. It was a great time. Perfect weather and the crowd was very diverse and upbeat. The Detroit Youth Choir brought down the place IMO — it’s a good watch. Was at the fence for the planes arrival. My gosh it’s huge and beautiful and I was choking back tears. She’s magnificent that plane.\n\nThe speakers/speech's were what you would expect. Elissa Slotkin got a huge positive response. That new governor of mine is a fine speaker also. Debbie Stabenow had a whole passage in her speech about the color Red and how it relates to the union. Very nice and let’s take that color back as well.\n\nGetting out was a disaster, beyond disaster, never seen anything like it. Didn’t get home until 1am. (1.5hr from airport). Somebody needs to be fired. Really. I had big fears of a Cincinnati for a little while. They sent everybody walking up/down the road and lining the road — that disappeared the clog of folks at the end of the fenced driveway out of there. It was crazy. There was a light hearted moment when organizers were beseeching people to “move back off the road” and an entire group shouted “We won’t go back, We won’t go back”.\n\nAfter getting home at 1am — I’m not in a hurry to go back and I’m feeling a bit like I got run over by all 87 busses they used to get folks back and forth! Those knees of mine are going to need to go.\n\nYou feel a sense of hope again. It’s been a long long time. It’s a nice feeling. Was fighting back tears on the bus over there. We need this as a country. It’s been a long hard few years for many of us.\n\nHaven’t written a diary in a long time, so please be gentle with the mistakes I’ve undoubtedly made."
