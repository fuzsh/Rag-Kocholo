        "text": "The Neighborhood is an American alternative rock/pop band that formed in Newbury Park, California in August 2011.\n\nThe group includes: Jesse Rutherford, Jeremy Friedman, Zach Abels, Michael Margott and Brandon Fried. Brian Sammis (drums) left the band in January 2014.\n\nAfter releasing two EPs, I'm Sorry and Thanks, The Neighborhood released their first full-length album, I Love You, on April 23, 2013 via Columbia Records.\n\nIn the same year, the mini-album The Love Collection was released, and in November 2014, the mixtape #000000 & #FFFFFF. Second album Wiped Out! was released on October 30, 2015.\n\nTheir third self-titled studio album was released on March 9, 2018, preceded by two EPs, Hard 22 in September 2017 and To Imagine on January 12, 2018, which quickly charted on the Billboard 200.\n\nMembers of The Neighborhood:\n\nJesse Rutherford - lead vocals\n\nZach Abels - lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n\nJeremy Friedman - rhythm and guitar, backing vocals\n\nMichael Margott - bass guitar, backing vocals\n\nBrandon Freed - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\nBrian Sammis (Olivver) was also in the band - drums, percussion, backing vocals. Unfortunately, in 2011 it became known on social media that drummer Brian Sammis was leaving the band.\n\nMYSTERIOUS APPEARANCE\n\nIn early 2012, a mysterious group appeared on the Internet. The Neighborhood group did not disclose their biographical data, photos and background, offering listeners only the interesting track Female Robbery.\n\nFans and the press were \"confused\" as they scoured the internet for any information that could lead them to the identity of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, have begun to emerge.\n\nAs it turned out, the guys are from California, despite their different names. Shortly after this riot, The NBHD decided to release another track, Sweater Weather, with a dark video to maintain interest.\n\nAlthough The NBHD's identity remained murky, it became clear that the music they produced was very inviting to debate for critics and fans alike.\n\nThe emotional combination of rock instruments with R&B, hip-hop aesthetics seemed in many ways a discovery and reimagining of sounds that made people demand even more information with even more interest.\n\nBy early May, when the band unveiled a free, self-released EP called I'm Sorry, it became clear that the band's uniqueness lies precisely in the music it creates.\n\nSO WHO ARE THE NBHD?\n\nThe group consists of five friends who joined to form their group in August 2011. They are known to be led by Rutherford (a 27-year-old singer) who worked in a variety of genres, including hip-hop, before creating the fusion of sounds that categorizes The NBHD's style.\n\nTheir debut album was released with the help of Justin Pilbrow, who invited Emil Haney to feature on Female Robbery. There is emotional tension with visual effects. And it's all part of the band's master plan.\n\n“I always have a certain picture, how I see it, before I create something,” says Rutherford. “I don't know how to make music differently. It's the idea, the whole idea of ​​the band's style is based on experimenting with sounds and genres. From the very beginning, we wanted to create this hip-hop aesthetic on an indie platform.\"\n\nI'm Sorry is a five-song EP, the precursor to the band's debut album, which was also produced by Pilbrow and Haney. The album, expected to be released in March 2013, expanded the band's dreary sensibilities.\n\nThis album combines brooding layers of instrumental music with Rutherford's hip hop inspired sound. The group even came up with their own name black & white for this style. It is these two shades that fully reflect the mood of the album and carry their message to the masses.\n\n“When I started playing music, I started playing drums and then I started doing vocals,” Rutherford explained. “And then I put them together because I think rap is just rhythmic vocals.\n\nI think the rhythm of hip hop really got me thinking. These are not just words, I began to delve deeper, to think about how these words are pronounced.\n\nOn September 21, 2017, The Neighborhood released the EP Hard, which peaked at number 183 on the US Billboard chart. Another EP titled To Imagine was released on January 12, 2018.\n\nThe band later announced their self-titled third studio album, The Neighborhood, released on March 9, 2018, featuring tracks from previous extended play singles including Scary Love.\n\nFollowing the release, the tracks were included on an album titled Hard to Imagine. And then the band released a complete edition of the album Hard To Imagine The Neighborhood Ever Changing, which contained all the songs released from Hard, To Imagine, The Neighborhood and Ever Changing, except for two tracks Revenge and Too Serious.\n\nSome facts about the band members:\n\nAccording to Zach, the band never saw themselves as an alternative rock band.\n\nJeremy is a big fan of The Beatles.\n\nThe group's favorite place is California.\n\nJesse's favorite subject is English.\n\nThe band describes their music as \"dark\" pop rock.\n\nGroup The Neighborhood, not The Neighborhood.\n\nThe band uses the British spelling of their name because the American spelling has already been used by someone.\n\nTheir style is black and white, so the group also usually writes its logo in this color.\n\nThe abbreviation for the band's name is the nbhd, not ngbh or tnbh or just nbhd.\n\nBrandon Freed is a relatively new drummer for the band.\n\nBriefly about the band: these guys are unique in that you always want to listen to them again. What only one of their songs Sweater Weather says, you can always listen to it.\n\nYou can talk more about the group, find more information and various facts, but is it necessary? Or shall we leave a bit of the same mystique as she originally wanted it? In the end, it was this ignorance that attracted the attention of the fans to the band from the very beginning."
