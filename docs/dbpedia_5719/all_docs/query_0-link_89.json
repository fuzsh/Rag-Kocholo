        "text": "Crews working three wildfires burning along the Front Range will have another day of hot, dry weather to contend with Saturday as they try to gain greater containment on the fires that started earlier this week.\n\nThe Alexander Mountain fire, which started Monday west of Loveland, has damaged or destroyed 49 structures, the Larimer County sheriff said Friday night. It has burned more than 9,500 acres. But by Saturday afternoon it was at 32% contained, up from 5% in the morning.\n\nThe greatest containment is on the Stone Canyon fire, which started Tuesday north of Lyons. Officials reported Saturday night they have 90% containment on the fire. One person died in the fire and five structures have been destroyed.\n\nMore resources are on the ground to fight the Quarry fire burning in Jefferson County. Officials say the fire was human-caused and an arson investigation is underway. The fire has burned 472 acres since starting Tuesday night in Jefferson County open space. It is 20% contained, officials said in a news conference Saturday.\n\nThe weather forecast for Saturday is concerning federal fire managers. Temperatures are expected to remain high, with the chance of thunderstorms that could bring erratic, gusty winds, though there is the possibility of rain in the Sunday outlook.\n\nForecast along the Front Range calls for near-record high temperatures this weekend, and the National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for Sunday.\n\n“Today, the weather is also concerning,” Jefferson County Sheriff Reggie Marinelli said Saturday morning. “If it were to drop rain for us, we’d be very appreciative of that. However, we all know in Colorado what comes with those small storms and that’s the lightning and the wind. So, we’re being very cautious about that.”\n\nCatch up: Read live updates from Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.\n\nAlexander Mountain fire\n\nContainment up to 32%; investigation into cause starts\n\nOfficials announced a major jump in containment Saturday, with lines now built around 32% of the fire, up from 5% when the day started. The greatest gains are on the east side of the fire, near Masonville, and along the U.S. 34 corridor.\n\nLarimer County Sheriff John Feyen said Saturday as containment improves they should be able to let some people back into their homes and “reduce the evacuation footprint tomorrow.”\n\nFeyen also said that investigators from the sheriff’s office and the U.S. Forest Service were able to get to the area where they believe the fire started, but he did not have information on their findings.\n\n“No determination or no final conclusion as to how it happened,” Feyen said. “It’s a hard hike to get in there, but they did get in there and that forensic work has started this morning.\n\nAsked if the fire was human-caused, Feyen declined to speculate.\n\nThe fire burning to the north is running into the Cameron Peak fire scar from 2020, which is helpful to firefighters. That fire is the largest in state history and burned more than 208,000 acres and destroyed 469 structures.\n\nFederal fire managers said earlier this week that they would likely let the fire move about a mile into the Cameron Peak scar before beginning to turn the flames back.\n\nMore than 500 people are now working the fire.\n\n— 4:31 p.m. Saturday\n\nCedar Park neighborhood big focus\n\nThe efforts Saturday for ground crews include boxing in the southwestern corner and the west side of the fire near the Cedar Park neighborhood.\n\n“Where we protected homes, now we’re going to get in there and work to try to create actual containment of the fire by connecting the dots,” Brandon Woodward, an operations chief with the management team, said in a morning update.\n\nNearly 400 personnel are on the fire, which was at 5% contained as of Saturday morning.\n\n— 12:51 p.m. Saturday\n\nNearly 50 structures damaged, destroyed\n\nAt least 25 homes were destroyed and four others were damaged as the Alexander Mountain fire moved through neighborhoods north of the town of Drake, the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office reported Friday night.\n\nNot all of the property owners have been notified, Sheriff John Feyen said. All of the damage is in the neighborhood of Palisade Mountain and Snow Top drives and includes another 20 outbuildings that were destroyed.\n\nInvestigators still are trying to reach people who have property on Cedar Creek Road, Spruce Mountain Drive, Green Ridge Road, Possum Court, Palisade Mountain Drive, Snow Top Drive and Bobcat Drive. Owners along those streets are asked to call 970-980-2800 to provide current contact information to the Office of Emergency Management.\n\nFire activity increased Friday on the northwestern edge of the fire and south of the neighborhoods where the homes were burned, federal fire managers said, causing more smoke in the afternoon. Crews protected an area near Cedar Springs Reservoir in the same neighborhood as aircraft dropped water and slurry on the western edge of the fire to slow its progress.\n\nThere are 398 firefighters working in rugged and steep areas above Big Thompson Canyon. Firelines on the fire’s eastern edge have held.\n\nSmoke continued to be heavy in communities near the fire, including Glen Haven and neighborhoods north of Estes Park. Air quality warnings have been issued for most communities in Larimer and Boulder counties.\n\n—7 a.m. Saturday\n\nStone Canyon fire\n\nOne neighborhood still under evacuation orders\n\nBoulder County authorities opened all of Stone Canyon Drive to residents and others on Saturday, leaving only the Moss Rock neighborhood just to the east, off limits.\n\nThe area includes 11 homes and was described as “still hot.” The Office of Disaster Management said fire and utility crews were working in the area, preparing for the evacuation to lift.\n\nIn town Saturday morning there was little evidence of the fire that terrorized Lyons earlier in the week. Barbecue grills in LaVern M. Johnson Park, which includes tent camping sites, were covered and posted with Boulder County’s countywide ban on open flames outdoors.\n\n— 4:45 p.m. Saturday\n\nFirefighters circling flames\n\nMore evacuation notices have been lifted as firefighters made major headway Friday in containing the fire. It is now more than halfway contained as ground crews circle the blaze.\n\nThe fire remains active and smoke will still be seen through the weekend, officials said.\n\n—7:15 a.m. Saturday\n\nQuarry fire\n\nFire lines being drawn as containment doubles\n\nFirefighters made big strides Saturday in containing the fire, which hasn’t grown much in size the past few days. The fire is now 20% contained, up from 10% Saturday morning.\n\n“That is a big step up from where we’ve been,” Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Mark Techmeyer said during a news conference Saturday afternoon. “We’ve made a lot of progress, folks.”\n\nA big part of getting the lines in rugged terrain has been the work of two Hotshot crews, which are about 20 people each and trained to work in dangerous areas.\n\nTechmeyer said residents are “gonna see a lot of smoke” Sunday as firefighters set intentional fires on the west side — in what he dubbed “no man’s land” — where the terrain is the most difficult.\n\n— 4:45 p.m. Saturday\n\nRattlesnakes, bears in mix\n\nA part of the fire is burning in an area known as Rattlesnake Gulch, and the Jefferson County sheriff said Saturday morning firefighters have encountered rattlesnakes and as well as inquisitive bruins.\n\n“They came across rattlesnakes yesterday as well as bears that are very curious as to what they are doing,” Sheriff Reggie Marinelli said. “Those are some safety issues for firefighters. But the number one safety issue is the heat.”\n\nContainment on the fire is expected to increase today as crews secure and connect fire lines.\n\n“I expect that (10% containment) number to jump. I anticipate a much bigger jump today,” Jefferson County spokesman Mark Techmeyer said Saturday morning.\n\nHe said more smoke will be visible Saturday because of the work crews are doing on the west side in open space.\n\n“It’s to be expected,” he said. “We don’t want anyone to panic and think things are getting out of control. It is intentional, and you’ll see that today.”\n\n— 8:20 a.m. Saturday\n\nWork on hand lines helping with containment\n\nFirefighters on Friday were “very aggressively” digging hand lines that have connected to fire breaks cleared by bulldozers, Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Karlyn Tilley said Friday afternoon. That, combined with continued air support, has increased the containment and kept the fire from spreading.\n\nNo structures have been damaged, but two firefighters sprained their ankles while working on the steep terrain Friday.\n\nInvestigators are bringing in the state’s K9 fire investigator as they look for what started the fire, which was human caused, Tilley said.\n\n—7:43 a.m. Saturday"
