        "text": "There are no claims made about artists on this page, just links to publicly-available claims.\n\nThe list is focused on the U.S. (where I live) and artists that perform in English (since I don’t have translation skills).\n\nI do not find profanity in general to be problematic. Only profanity relating to hate speech. According to academic definitions, not to your standards.\n\nDepicting a bad thing can be offensive, even if that thing isn’t being endorsed.\n\nThat you or I like someone is not a valid reason for them to not be on this list. It’s a binary thing, they did something problematic or they didn’t. Minor transgressions are on the list, even if apologized for or forgiven.\n\nIf you’re a liberal and you want to complain about this list, make sure you read the full context and understand what this list is. If you don’t agree with the statements above, keep your criticism, I’m not interested. The only feedback I’m looking for from you are factual errors (NOT interpretation of facts, only specific facts) or omissions. Submit something missing, I’ll review the facts and add if warranted.\n\nIf you’re conservative and you want to complain about this list, don’t. Instead you should fuck off. This isn’t for you and your thoughts about this don’t matter. I will delete without reading.\n\nThis is a woke list and proud of it.\n\n50 Cent, “P.I.M.P.”: Includes misogynistic lyrics and slurs.\n\nAaron Lewis, “Am I the Only One”: Includes lyrics that are jingoistic, pro-Confederacy and anti-liberal.\n\nAaron Tippin, “Drill Here, Drill Now”: Favors environmentally-destroying oil drilling.\n\nAC/DC, “Dirty Deeds (Done Dirt Cheap)”: Depicts violence against women.\n\nAdam Sandler, “At A Medium Pace”: Kink-shaming and graphically explicit in extreme ways.\n\nAdolescents, “She Wolf”: Includes racial slur and misogynist lyrics.\n\nAerosmith, “Dude Looks Like A Lady”: Includes transphobic lyrics.\n\nAimee Allen, “Ron Paul Revolution”: Pro-Ron Paul song.\n\nAlice Cooper, “Raped and Freezing”: Depicts rape, implied racism in the lyrics.\n\nAlien Ant Farm, “Smooth Criminal”: Depicts violence against women.\n\nAndrew Bird, “Fake Palindromes”: Depicts violence against a woman.\n\nAngry Samoans, “They Saved Hitler's Cock”: Makes light of Nazi war crimes.\n\nAnimals, “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”: From the point of view of an abusive man.\n\nAqua, “Barbie Girl”: Contains misogynistic lyrics.\n\nAsking Alexandria, “Not The American Average”: Contains misogynistic lyrics.\n\nThe Association, “Cherish”: The last verse seems to suggest the song advocates grooming.\n\nBeastie Boys, “Girls”: Filled with misogynistic lyrics.\n\nThe Beatles, “Getting Better”: Depicts violence against women.\n\nThe Beatles, “I’ll Get You”: Contains misogynistic lyrics.\n\nThe Beatles, “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer”: Depicts violence against a woman.\n\nThe Beatles, “Run For Your Life”: Advocates violence against women.\n\nThe Beatles, “You Can’t Do That”: Contains misogynistic lyrics.\n\nThe Bellamy Brothers, “You Ain’t Just Whistlin’ Dixie”: Celebrates the confederacy.\n\nBen Colder, “Welfare Cadillac”: Racist, contains right-wing propaganda.\n\nBen Folds, “B*tches Ain’t Shit”: Includes misogynist slurs, sexism and homophobia.\n\nBillie Holiday, “Ain’t Nobody’s Business”: The narrator of the song excuses a man’s abuse against a woman.\n\nBilly Currington, “Hey Girl”: Infantilizes women and objectifies them.\n\nBlack Flag, “Slip It In”: Includes misogynistic lyrics and seems to depict rape.\n\nBlink-182, “Voyeur”: Song is from the point of view of someone who violates the privacy of a woman he has a crush on.\n\nBloodhound Gang, “The Ballad of Chasey Lane”: Filled with misogynistic lyrics.\n\nBloodhound Gang, “A Lap Dance Is So Much Better When the Stripper Is Crying”: Filled with misogynistic lyrics.\n\nBrad Paisley, “Accidental Racist”: Includes a false equivalency between racism and violence and cultural choices.\n\nBryan Lewis, “I Think My Dog’s a Democrat”: Filled with right-wing nonsense.\n\nBryson Gray, “MAGA Steppin’”: Pro-Trump right-wing propaganda.\n\nBuddy Brown, “If This Country Still Had Balls”: Pro-lynching song.\n\nBuju Banton, “Boom Bye Bye”: Advocates for the murder of gay men.\n\nCage, “I Never Knew You”:Includes misogynistic lyrics and humanizes a serial killer.\n\nCharlie Daniels, \"Simple Man\": Right-wing nonsense, advocates violence.\n\nThe Charlie Daniels Band, “This Ain't No Rag, It's A Flag”: Includes jingoistic and racist lyrics.\n\nCheap Trick, “The Ballad of TV Violence”: Written about murderer Richard Speck.\n\nCity High, “What Would You Do?,”: Talks about rape, portrays slut-shaming.\n\nClint Black, “Iraq and Roll”: Jingoistic, pro-war.\n\nConflict, “An Option”: Includes racist and sexist slurs.
