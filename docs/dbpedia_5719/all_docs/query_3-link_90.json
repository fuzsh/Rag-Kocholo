        "text": "Trigger warning: This story contains sensitive content regarding sexual assault.\n\nOver the weekend, Brandon Fried, a drummer for the band The Neighbourhood, was removed from the group after María Zardoya, the front woman for the band The Marías, revealed he sexually assaulted her.\n\nOn Nov. 13, Zardoya took to her Instagram Stories to share her account of the incident. “I was at a bar last night, and I was groped under the table by Brandon Fried, the drummer of The Neighbourhood,” she wrote. “It was one of the most uncomfortable things I’ve ever experienced. I felt an invasion of my space, privacy, and body.”\n\n“I am so terribly sorry to María. My actions were inexcusable and intolerable,” Fried wrote on his Instagram Stories. “They are not reflective of who I am as a person, but clearly a reflection of who I become while under the influence.”\n\nHe continued, “It is evident that I must address my problems with alcohol and substance abuse, which I am now seeking help for.” His statement also apologizes to women who may have been victims, the band, and their fans.\n\nShortly after, The Neighbourhood shared a statement on their official social media accounts addressing the matter. “We are grateful to Maria for coming forward,” they wrote. “We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behavior towards women. As a result of Brandon’s actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighbourhood.”\n\nZardoya, Fried, nor the band made any further statements at the time of publication. It’s unknown if Zardoya will pursue legal action.\n\nWe stand with María Zardoya and commend her for speaking out."
