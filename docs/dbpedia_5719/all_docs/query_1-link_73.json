        "text": "A new upscale Chinese restaurant is now open in the Gulch neighborhood of Nashville. It's taken over the former home of Tansuo, Maneet Chauhan's contemporary Chinese restaurant that closed early this year.\n\nIt's the latest venture from Moni Advani, who opened Chauhan Ale and Masala House and Mockingbird with Chauhan. Partnering with him is Nishaan Chavda, previously the West Coast director of operations for Michael Mina's Mina Group, which locally includes Bourbon Steak. Chavda has also worked closely with iconic chef Thomas Keller as the captain of his restaurant group.\n\nConsulting on the menu is James Beard Award-winning chef Brandon Jew of the Michelin-starred Mister Jiu’s in San Francisco. Choy Executive Chef Brian Griffith was Jew's longtime sous chef and, as a Tennessee native, has added some Southern twists to the menu, including a chicken-fried wagyu steak draped with the pure spice funk of a nicely executed mapo tofu.\n\nThat mapo tofu could easily stand on its own. It's a good example of what Griffith intends with the menu: authentic flavor that's not too shy with the spice and leans on plenty of house-fermented flavors.\n\nFor the mapo tofu, he ages his own broad bean paste for three years. He dries the shellfish for the scallop XO sauce and cures the ham in a green bean dish fragrant with fermented black beans. The pork and shrimp wontons, with handmade wrappers dark with squid ink and spiced with fermented chilies, are a good example of a kitchen that's comfortable pushing the envelope.\n\n\"We do a couple of fermented cabbage dishes that are kind of akin to sauerkraut,\" Griffith said. \"But we usually serve them with Szechuan chilies.\"\n\nHigh-quality chilies have been hard to source, underscoring why authentic Chinese food has been somewhat hard to come by in Nashville ― a lack of the ingredients with which to make it.\n\nNow that he's found someone who could source the same chilies he used when cooking in San Francisco, he still wonders how well Szechuan peppers will play with the Nashville audience.\n\n\"That numbing sensation can be really polarizing if they don't know what they're expecting to get,\" he said.\n\nThe key is hitting on all the right notes to make a menu that's not too far out of left field, but still authentic, Griffith said. Still, it's far from overly sweet Chinese American buffet fare. But as with Southern food, Chinese food is not a monolith.\n\n\"It's just different and can be done with high-end ingredients and good oil and everything like that,\" Griffith said.\n\nTake for example the Peking Roast Duck, a star of the menu sourced from Jurgielewicz Birds in Philadelphia. Griffith separates the skin from the meat with an air compressor, then rubs it with brown rice syrup, dark soy sauce and a custom 10-spice blend. It's then hung under a fan to dry for 10 to 17 days, then wood smoked. The entire process can take up to three weeks.\n\n\"It gets served with liver mousse from the livers of the bird,\" Griffith said. \"Also confit hearts, confit of gizzards, a side of peanut butter Hoisin with peanut butter powder, and then pancakes we make in-house, and then just the traditional greens, cucumbers, scallions and cilantro.\"\n\nIt's a celebratory large-format dish, served with ceremony. At $130, it's meant to be shared among a small group, and it's a good reminder that fine-dining Chinese food is not uncommon, even if it's uncommonly hard to find in Nashville.\n\nThe restaurant's color scheme of rose gold, red, black and dark emerald, is also meant to project luxury. Local Nashville design firm Carlton Edwards took the Art Deco movement of mid-20th-century Shanghai for inspiration, Chavda said. The high ceilings, 30-foot-wide bar and hand-cut marble add to the mood of the 120-seat space, and the deep wine list and well-made cocktails also fit the theme well.\n\n\"The bar program is a modern take on old classics from the 20th century from legendary hotels around the world,\" Chavda said.\n\nThat includes well-executed plays on the Chartreuse Swizzle, Singapore Sling and the Hotel Nacional.\n\n\"The feeling of the room, it feels grand, it feels like an event that you're going out,\" Chavda said. \"I think also that style of dining is rare to see nowadays, especially in the downtown area where fine dining is closely associated to one style of restaurant in Nashville right now.\"\n\nFine dining does not have to mean steakhouses, Eurocentric hotel restaurants or Italian spots.\n\n\"We're trying to break that mold,\" Chavan said. \"The amount of work and attention that goes into a perfectly made fried rice is equivalent to a beautiful handmade bowl of pasta too.\""
