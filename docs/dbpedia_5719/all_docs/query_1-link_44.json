        "text": "NEWBURY PARK, CALIFORNIA: After being accused of groping Maria Zardoya of the band The Marias, rock group The Neighbourhood's drummer Brandon Fried has been fired, the band announced on Sunday. The band in a statement said they have \"zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behavior towards women\" after firing Fried. The initial accusation was made against Fried on Sunday by Zardoya in her Instagram Story.\n\nMaria stated, \"I was at a bar last night, and i was groped under the table by Brandon fried, the drummer of the neighbourhood,\" on her Instagram Story. \"It was one of the most uncomfortable things i've ever experienced.\" \"@thenbhd ya'll need a new drummer, this guy is a complete creep,\" she further added, tagging the band.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez discloses how sexual abuse in her early 20s drove her to run for office\n\nKris Wu: How sexual assault allegations against former EXO star rocked the K-pop world\n\nShortly after her accusation, The Neighbourhood issued a statement claiming that they had fired their drummer. \"We are grateful to Maria for coming forward. We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behavior towards women,\" the band wrote. \"As a result of Brandon's actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighbourhood.\"\n\nFried issued a message shortly after and apologized for his behavior which he attributed to drug misuse. The drummer wrote, \"I am so terribly sorry to Maria. My actions were inexcusable and intolerable. They are not reflective of who I am as a person, but clearly a reflection of who I become while under the influence. It is evident that I must address my problems with alcohol and substance abuse, which I am now seeking help for.\" He added, \"I want to apologize to women who have been victims of any behavior that has left them feeling uncomfortable or violated. I am so sorry to The Neighbourhood and our fans for letting them down.\"\n\nBrandon Fried has not been dating anyone as of 2022. Fried, 31, reportedly had at least one past relationship, according to CelebsCouples. He has never been married.\n\nThe Neighbourhood has recently been the subject of heightened media interest as a result of lead vocalist Jesse Rutherford's blossoming romance with Billie Eilish. Due to their age difference, their relationship has received criticism, with the 31-year-old Rutherford receiving flak for dating the 20-year-old GRAMMY winner."
