        "text": "The Neighbourhood have fired drummer Brandon Fried following an allegation of sexual assault.\n\nThe musician joined the band in 2014, replacing founder member Bryan Sammis. Brandon Fried quickly became an established member of the group, and played on 2015 album ‘Wiped Out!’ and its 2018 follow-up ‘The Neighbourhood’.\n\nOver the weekend, however, controversy engulfed the band, with María Zardoya – lead singer of LA based indie-psych group The Marías – accusing Brandon Fried of sexually assaulting her.\n\nIn a statement on IG Stories, the singer said she was “groped under the table” at a bar in LA by Brandon Fried. Continually, she said “it was one of the most uncomfortable things I’ve ever experienced” calling it “an invasion of my space, my privacy, and body”.\n\nClosing, she urged The Neighbourhood to replace Brandon Fried from the line up, calling him “a complete creep”.\n\nThe statement was then echoed by another woman, who also revealed her unpleasant experiences with the drummer.\n\nThe Neighbourhood have acted quickly, removing Brandon Fried from the line-up. In a statement, they cut ties with the drummer, and called out his behaviour saying they have “zero tolerance” for his actions and confirm he is “no longer” a member of The Neighbourhood.\n\nThe band write:\n\nWe are grateful to Maria for coming forward. We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behavior towards women. As a result of Brandon’s actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighbourhood.\n\nFind the statement below.\n\nBrandon Friend has not commented."
