        "text": "The Neighbourhood has fired long-time drummer Brandon Fried after an alleged groping incident was publicly announced by musician María Zardoya, of The Marías.\n\nOn Sunday, November 13, Zardova took to the band's Instagram to share a post explaining the groping incited by Fried.\n\n“I was at a bar last night, and I was groped under the table by @brandon fried, the drummer of the neighbourhood,” Zardova explains. “It was one of the most uncomfortable things that I’ve ever experienced. I felt an invasion of my space, privacy and body. @thenbhd ya’ll need a new drummer, this guy is a complete creep.”\n\nThe Neighbourhood was quick to respond to the claim by firing Fried and releasing a statement of remorse to Zardova and their fandom.\n\n“We are grateful for María for coming forward,” The Neighbourhood explains in their statement. “We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behavior towards women. As a result of Brandon’s actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighbourhood.”\n\nFried released a statement on his personal social media profiles.\n\n“I am so terribly sorry to María. My actions were inexcusable and intolerable. They are not a reflection of who I am as a person, but clearly a reflection of who I become under the influence,” he said. “It is evident that I must address my problems with alcohol and substance abuse, which I am now seeking help for. I want to apologize to women who have been. Victims of any behavior that has left them feeling uncomfortable or violated. I am also sorry The Neighbourhood and our fans for letting them down,” Fried concluded.\n\nThe Neighbourhood is known for their breakout debut album titled ‘I Love You.’ featuring their hit song Sweater Weather which has over 1 billion streams on Spotify.\n\nThe Marías made their debut in 2017 releasing the EP titled ‘Superclean Vol. 1.’ They are best known for their song ‘Cariño’ and ‘I Don’t Know You.’ Their first studio album ‘Cinema’ was nominated for a Grammy Award for the Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical category."
