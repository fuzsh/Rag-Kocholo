        "text": "Cast propels breezy Instigators\n\nThere’s nothing particularly memorable, or for that matter, unique about Doug Liman’s The Instigators. Be that as it may, the film is not without its charm, provided primarily by the tremendously overqualified cast, all veterans who bring a sense of enthusiasm to this project that it doesn’t deserve. The result is a pleasant caper film with a great deal of heart that will likely have viewers grinning from beginning to end.\n\nThe role of Rory is not the sort Matt Damon usually tackles. Unsure throughout, he’s an anachronism who brings a sense of honor and a bit of naivete to the scheme hatched by Besegai (Michael Stuhlberg), a local front with inside info on the corrupt mayor (Ron Perlman). When he’s not taking notes with a pen on paper regarding what he’s to do during the heist, he’s asking far too many questions about the most obvious things. That Damon conveys the character’s uncertainty and morality in such a relatable way has us pulling for him from the word “go.”\n\nNot so much with Cobby, a role Casey Affleck wrote for himself. Imagine his character from Good Willing Hunting, having not matured a lick, becoming more of an irritant as the years have gone by. His function is to irritate, which the actor can do in his sleep when called upon, but he wisely gives Cobby a solid backstory that goes a long way towards explaining his behavior and our accepting him.\n\nThe rest of the cast is an embarrassment of riches, each performer shining when given their moment in the spotlight. Rapper Jack Harlow continues to impress as the third in the trio of thieves, Scalvo, while Alfred Molina, playing Besegai’s partner Richie, wisely underplays his scenes, complimenting Stuhlbarg’s over-the-top turn. Paul Walter Houser is underused but makes an impression as Booch, the worst bounty hunter in history, while Ving Rhames glowers and menaces as only he can as the mayor’s enforcer. But it’s Hong Chau who steals the film, delivering a quiet, stealthy performance as Rory’s therapist, the most understanding, capable doctor you’re likely to meet. The heartfelt conversations between her and Damon provide the emotional touchstone around which the chaos revolves.\n\nWhen the heist goes sideways and the requisite car chases and gunfights ensue, Liman brings a degree of humor to these sequences, the banter between the characters often juxtaposed with pop tunes that belie the seriousness of the situation.\n\nClocking in at 100 minutes, The Instigators is a breezy, engaging entertainment buoyed not only by its wry humor and clever twists but, more importantly, its sympathetic characters. These two men struggle not simply with the world itself, but their own faults, which they fully recognize but are often unable to combat. Who can’t relate to that? Streaming on AppleTV+.\n\nArtificiality undercuts Ends important message\n\nBased on the best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover, the serious subject matter in Justin Baldoni’s It Ends with Us is undercut by the director’s Hallmark aesthetic. A glossy sheen permeates the film’s ornate, and at times overwrought sets, creating a sense of artificiality that is reflected in its story. Even worse than the physical artifice is the emotional hollowness that runs throughout.\n\nUnable to speak at her father’s funeral, Lily (Blake Lively) retreats to her new home in Boston where she has an odd meet-cute with handsome neurosurgeon Ryle (Baldoni). It’s evident from this moment – about 10 minutes in – that the film is on shaky ground as there’s no chemistry between the two leads. Their interactions are forced throughout, passion between them is absent and their conversations are of the most facile sort. If I didn’t know any better, I’d swear the source material was a YA novel.\n\nAnd though they part, Boston proves to be a very small town (more on this later) as Lily runs into ole Ryle again, when he saunters into her flower shop. Wouldn’t you know it, he just happens to be the brother of her sole employee and best friend, Allysa (Jenny Slate). Coincidences continue to occur when Lily crosses paths with Atlas (Brandon Skelner), who was her first love that she hasn’t seen in over 15 years, who’s also opened a business in Boston. What are the odds???\n\nAs the passionless romance between our heroine and Ryle unfolds, it's intercut with flashbacks recounting her relationship with Atlas (these names!). Seems he was a homeless classmate of hers who happened to take shelter in an abandoned home right next to her family’s. Why there is an empty, battered house such as this in an upper middle-class neighborhood, right next to the mayor’s residence, is a matter you’re not supposed to think too much about in movies such as these.\n\nWhat emerges is a story of regret, denial and damage seen through an idealized lens. As we come to find out, Lily witnessed her father abuse her mother and realizes only too late that she has followed in her footsteps when Ryle displays violent behavior as well.\n\nDomestic behavior and breaking the cycle of violence are serious issues that demand a mature approach. Unfortunately, the slipshod screenplay, which relies on ridiculous circumstances to move the story along, lays a shaky narrative foundation that fails to treat these problems with the weight they deserve. The artificiality of the world Lily inhabits, as well as the teenage romanticism that suffuses it, clash with these vital concerns, so much so that they come off as a melodramatic punchline rather than a genuine examination of abuse and its effects.\n\nIf any in the audience identify with Lily and come to take decisive steps in their own lives, then Ends serves some positive purpose. Yet, its simplistic approach smacks of soap opera sensationalism, which may tug at the heartstrings of Hoover’s fans, but in the end manages to do a disservice to real-life victims. In theaters.\n\nTrap aptly named\n\nThings get off to a rocky start in M. Night Shyamalan’s Trap and go quickly off the rails. Cooper (Josh Hartnett) is earning big-time dad points by taking his teen daughter, Riley (Ariel Donoghue), to see the pop sensation Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan). Yet, from the moment they arrive at the venue, something seems off. The security presence is akin to what you’d see in a warzone, prompting Cooper to notice other unusual protocols in play. You see, he has to be aware of these things because – here comes the twist – he’s a serial killer, who has slain 12 area youths and currently has another chained up in an undisclosed location.\n\nWith this shaky premise in place, Shyamalan unspools a game of cat-and-mouse that depends on incredible circumstances and coincidences to function, all the while asking us to identify with a psychopath. It’s fortunate Cooper crosses paths with a loose-lipped vendor who clues him in on key pieces of information that allows him to evade the authorities, while his oh-so-coincidental encounter with Raven’s uncle sets up a situation that gets him and Riley backstage. And the fact that there’s hundreds of officers on duty to catch one guy? C'mon!\n\nThe film is replete with instances such as these and it all becomes too much to swallow. Some critics read the film as a comedy – granted, seeing huge glass jugs of cooking oil next to a bubbling fryer is funny – but the overall tone of the film doesn’t support this. Unless Cooper has some sort of supernatural abilities we’re not privy to, there’s no logical explanation for the many improbable escapes and quick costume changes he pulls off. There’s a fine line between winking at the audience to let them know this is a parody and insulting them, one that Shyamalan crosses with impunity throughout.\n\nIf there’s a highlight, and it’s a small one, its Hartnett. Having acted only sporadically for years, he’s made a bit of a comeback recently and is obviously having a good time. Beginning by projecting a guise of normalcy, Cooper’s gradual unraveling is the sort of blatantly over-the-top role actors love to sink their teeth into. Hartnett does just that and it is a delight to see him become progressively unhinged. The rest of the cast accord themselves as well as they can, while the presence of Hayley Mills as criminal profiler Dr. Josephine can only be explained as a nod to her starring role in The Parent Trap …I think."
