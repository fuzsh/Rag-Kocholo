        "text": "The Neighbourhood have swiftly responded to allegations of their drummer, Brandon Fried, sexually assaulting singer MarÃ­a Zardoya.\n\nZardoya, vocalist of the indie pop band The MarÃ­as, raised the accusation yesterday via her Instagram stories. \"I was at a bar last night, and I was groped under the table by Brandon Fried. It was one of the most uncomfortable things I've ever experienced,\" she alleged.\n\nShe also wrote, \"I felt an invasion of my space, privacy and body.\" Zardoya tagged The Neighbourhood's Instagram account and said, \"y'all need a new drummer, this guy is a complete creep\".\n\nWithin a few hours, the band, composed of guitarists Jeremy Freedman and Zach Abels, bassist Mikey Margot and vocalist Jesse Rutherford, responded to Zardoya's allegations on social media and wrote, \"We are grateful to Maria for coming forward. We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behaviour towards women. As a result of Brandonâs actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighbourhood.\"\n\nFried first joined the group in 2014. Following the allegations, Fried made his own statement. \"I am so terribly sorry to Maria,\" his account opened.\n\n\"My actions were inexcusable and intolerable. They are not reflective of who I am as a person, but clearly a reflection of who I become while under the influence.\n\nDon't miss a beat with our FREE daily newsletter\n\n\"It is evident that I must address my problems with alcohol and substance abuse, which I am now seeking help for.\"\n\nHe closed the statement by writing, \"I want to apologize to women who have been victims of any behaviour that has left them feeling uncomfortable or violated.\n\n\"I am also sorry to The Neighbourhood and our fans for letting them down.\"\n\nThe Neighbourhood's most recent and fourth album, Chip Chrome & The Mono-Tones, was released in September 2020. The band gained new streaming highs that same year when Sweater Weather, from their 2013 album I Love You, and Daddy Issues, from their 2015 album, Wiped Out! went viral on TikTok."
