Now, he leverages his storytelling skills to share compelling narratives from across campus.\n\nSome have tried to convert him — and he did earn an MBA from Purdue University Global — but he remains a staunch Auburn fan. As a kid, he fantasized about playing centerfield for the Atlanta Braves and he still follows their season.\n\nEmily Disinger\n\nGraphic Designer\n\nEmily started out as an intern at Purdue Marketing and Communications while she earned her bachelor’s in visual communication design and minored in dance and philosophy.

He continued to shoot still images as a student photographer at Indiana State University, where he majored in English and minored in communications and creative writing. ISU hired Jon as a staff photographer after graduation, and his role quickly evolved to include videography. Now he’s a pro at both, and he puts those multimedia skills to use while telling the stories of Purdue. When he’s not shooting and editing videos, Jon loves playing video games. He even has a podcast where he talks gaming, technology and sometimes movies.

At work, Matt is quiet and reserved, which is why people are often surprised to learn he’s performed improv comedy for 20 years.\n\nMaura Klopfenstein\n\nContent Writer\n\nAs a writer who consistently works to be a more effective ally to marginalized groups, Maura is passionate about creating inclusive messaging that resonates with a diverse audience.\n\nThe positivity she brings to her work and talent for writing in a conversational tone make her an indispensable resource for campus departments desiring to tell their unique stories with authenticity.\n\nBy age 5, Maura knew she wanted to be a storyteller. A mom to three kids, she’s probably the proudest mom on the planet — when they’re not rolling their eyes or cracking bathroom jokes.\n\nMaura also loves spending time outside and watching the wildlife.\n\nKelsey Koenigbauer\n\nProject Manager\n\nKelsey Koenigbauer attributes much of her talent for multitasking to her time working as a waitress, a skill that has been invaluable throughout her career. With a background working in account services for marketing and communications agencies, she thrives in a fast-paced environment with many moving parts. In her work at Purdue, she harnesses these skills to advocate for her team, supporting others and keeping them on track so that they can be the best versions of themselves.\n\nFor Kelsey, authenticity is extremely important — she wholeheartedly believes in being true to yourself, no matter who is watching. One day she hopes to be able to buy a boat and spend her days on the water with her dog and her husband. When she’s not dreaming about afternoons on the lake, she’s working on her knitting skills — she recently finished her first two handmade sweaters.\n\nAva Kuhn\n\nSenior Content Writer\n\nCuriosity drives almost all aspects of Ava Kuhn’s life. With a double major in art history and journalism from Indiana University, she loves falling down research rabbit holes. Her drive to learn new things and connect with people drew her to her role as a content writer at Purdue Marketing and Communications.\n\nGrowing up, Ava found a model for hard work in her parents, who own a small business. From their tireless example, Ava discovered that she wanted to find a career that she could put her whole heart into. Now able to marry her love for research and creative communication, Ava shares Boilermaker stories that inspire and uplift people from all walks of life.\n\nWhen she’s not busy learning all there is to know about her newest research fixation, Ava is most likely to be found exploring nature with a book in her hand or a podcast in her ears.\n\nKelsey Lefever\n\nSenior Photographer\n\nKelsey Lefever is no stranger to the Purdue community. After graduating with a double major in professional and creative writing, she returned to Purdue for a master’s degree in creative writing — and even spent four years as a writing intern with the Purdue News service. When she started searching for a wedding photographer, however, she grew curious about how she might bring a visual approach to her storytelling.\n\nToday, as a senior photographer for Purdue Marketing and Communications, Lefever brings a high degree of attention to her work. With the help of her camera, she seeks to celebrate and uplift the unique human experiences embodied in her subjects’ stories.\n\nWhen she isn’t working, you will probably find her outdoors. She lives by the saying, “There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad gear.” One of her proudest achievements is climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, and — rain or shine — you might just catch her training for her next hike.\n\nZach Mogensen\n\nMultimedia Producer\n\nEven though being on-set for a video shoot can be a stressful experience, Zach Mogensen has discovered that a positive and supportive team can make all the difference. After a handful of years running a freelance video production company with a friend, Zach is excited to focus on telling Purdue’s best stories through video, alongside Purdue’s premier storytellers.\n\nA self-described “jack of all trades,” Zach appreciates the “multi” aspect of his “multimedia producer” role, using a wide range of skills and interests across his field to make the Purdue brand shine. He also enjoys playing and listening to music — in his free time, you can find him jamming out on the bass guitar with his band.\n\nChristi Perry\n\nSenior Marketing Production Manager\n\nWith natural problem-solving abilities and unbridled optimism, Christi’s positive attitude and forward thinking propels projects from ideation through execution.\n\nGrowing up, Christi dreamt of becoming an astronaut or an Avon lady. She likes to explore new places and managed aerospace programs for the likes of Lockheed Martin, Bell Helicopter and Boeing. Christi has decades of experience in sales and marketing and desire to connect with people.\n\nA childhood spent on the family farm stoked her lifelong passion for agricultural and historical preservation. As a board member of the Indiana Barn Foundation, Christi works to preserve Indiana’s heritage barns.\n\nJana Plyley\n\nSenior Graphic Designer\n\nAs a creative, one of Jana Plyley’s sources of inspiration is a bit unusual: her dad’s candy factory. Growing up, she witnessed the passion, energy and ingenuity it required — and the resulting magic and happiness from a job well done. Today, she brings that results-driven approach to her work. The excitement she hopes to inspire with her design work propels her to make others’ visions a reality.\n\nWhen she’s not working, you might find Jana spending time with friends, walking with her dog or hitting the gym — but only if you’re willing to get up early enough. She’s there most every day at 4:30 in the morning before she starts the rest of her day.\n\nKristy Reese\n\nSenior Project Manager\n\nTop-notch organizational skills are essential in a project manager role, and no one is more organized than Kristy. She keeps projects on time and within budget while documenting metrics that can improve team efficiency.\n\nEndlessly energetic, Kristy has always had trouble sitting still. Whether cleaning the house, doing yardwork, reading a book or going on a walk, she feels happiest when she has accomplished something.\n\nLosing both parents to cancer turned Kristy into an advocate for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. She’s participated in several events, such as Light The Night and Team In Training, raising more than $20,000 for the organization.\n\nSophie Ritz\n\nAssociate Content Writer\n\nA compassionate and enthusiastic storyteller, Sophie deeply values intelligent, efficient communication in any group. A Boilermaker at heart — she earned her BA at Purdue in 2023 with highest distinction — she decided to stay close to share stories about the Purdue community she loves.\n\nShe’s so passionate about communication, in fact, that she does it in two languages. She’s fluent in French, and began learning the language in third grade and minoring in it at Purdue. But, she says, in her free time, she’s happiest watching movies, hanging out with friends and family, and traveling. Among her favorite trips she’s taken are Chicago (to see The Cure in concert) and study abroad opportunities in Thailand and London.\n\nNow her home is in West Lafayette, and her favorite thing to do on Saturday mornings is enjoying a breakfast special at one of Purdue’s classic hot spots.\n\nRebecca Robiños\n\nLead Photographer\n\nRebecca interned with the photo team while earning her Bachelor of Arts in photography from Purdue. Her internship experience confirmed her passion for the medium and launched her photo career. She became a full-time team member after graduation.\n\nAn ardent collaborator, Rebecca enjoys conceptualizing shoots with other team members to deliver evocative images.\n\nIn addition to the portraiture and event photography she captures for the University, she’s also a fine art photographer. Her other creative pursuits include painting and crocheting scarves and blankets.\n\nAlways endeavoring to advance her skills, Rebecca looks for ways to challenge herself and experiment behind the lens.\n\nOlivia Sarault\n\nLead Graphic Designer\n\nAs a designer, Olivia is detail-oriented to a T. As a leader, she is passionate about mentoring new designers and watching them grow in their careers. In addition to leading a team of multimedia designers and photographers, she also oversees creative direction for all print and digital projects.\n\nA proud boy mom with two sons, she spends a lot of her time near the water. She and her husband volunteered to run the north division of the Indiana Bass Federation Youth Program.\n\nShe’s a Purdue graduate with a degree in visual communication design.\n\nTed Schellenberger\n\nBroadcast Media Senior Producer\n\nTed would say he’s a gaffer, grip and clamp aficionado. That’s just another way of describing his unfaltering energy and resolute dedication to doing whatever needs doing to get the job done.\n\nIf there’s an important event happening on campus, Ted will be there to cover it.\n\nHis childhood dream was to become a drummer in a rock band. Although that didn’t happen, he does play guitar and owns entirely too much music gear, including 15 guitars, 10 amps and more than 100 effects pedals.\n\nA vegan and animal lover, Ted’s cats are the absolute best.\n\nGreg Simmons\n\nLead Graphic Designer\n\nKnown in the office as the “fixer,” Greg is the workhorse of the design team, willingly taking on yearly churn projects such as updating the campus map or formatting awards certificates. But don’t think that means he settles for the status quo.\n\nResults-driven by nature, Greg always pushes for the strongest design, writing and strategy, and he’s not afraid to ask tough questions to galvanize the team.\n\nDeeply entrenched in the local arts community — he volunteers at Civic Theatre of Greater Lafayette and the Lafayette Ballet Company — Greg frequently attends art and music events. He’s also an avid tabletop gamer.\n\nJulie Sadler\n\nSenior Graphic Designer\n\nCreative and diligent with a keen eye for details, Julie has an uncanny ability to turn straw into (Purdue) gold when it comes to transforming a design. Proficient in both digital and print, she flexes her artistry across mediums and communication channels.\n\nShe and her husband live on a golf course where they can be found battling to collect the most birdies every weeknight. A consummate designer, she dabbles in house decor and is a voracious viewer of HGTV. She even designed her own labels for uniform glass containers that hold household cleaners, spices, baking ingredients and other pantry items.\n\nNate Saloh\n\nWebsite Content Manager\n\nWith 10 years of experience in website creation in a university setting, Nate Saloh is acutely tuned in to what makes website visitors tick. In his role at Purdue, he advocates for a better user experience, championing accessibility, unity and optimization across all pages. He believes that design is instrumental to achieving functionality — without strategically planned design, any web experience would be less–than ideal.\n\nDescribing himself as a quiet individual, he is thoughtful and detail-oriented, both at work and at home. In his free time, he enjoys spending time with his wife, working on projects throughout the house and listening to music from all genres.\n\nChelsea Schwab\n\nProject Manager\n\nOutgoing, optimistic and self-described as “overinvolved,” Chelsea found her love for collegiate projects as an undergraduate (while also working as a resident assistant, student activities lead and tour guide, of course). After discovering that she could turn her passion for her college campus into a career, she earned her master’s degree in student affairs administration in higher education. At Purdue, she served as a program advisor and assistant director of student activities and organizations before stepping into her current role.\n\nAs a project manager, Chelsea is the conduit for how Marketing and Communications creates the stories and experiences that enrich Purdue’s culture. Through overseeing timelines, utilizing resources and encouraging collaboration, she ensures that the team accomplishes its goals. Always resilient and habitually happy, she strives to create a community where everyone feels valued.\n\nChelsea doesn’t just juggle a lot on the job — she finds fun in a never-ending array of activities. An avid reader, crafter, homebrewer and half-marathon runner, she enjoys diving into her interests and learning something new. She loves being around her husband and daughter; the family adventures with their camper all summer.\n\nMark Townsend\n\nSenior Web Designer\n\nAfter studying journalism at Ball State University, Mark Townsend began his career working for media conglomerate Gannett in Nashville, Tennessee, as a page designer for The Tennessean’s sports section. After meeting his wife and looking for the opportunity to nurture his creativity, he moved back to Indiana, where he worked in an Indianapolis-based agency and later for the pharmaceutical manufacturer Roche.\n\nIn addition to the breadth of work he has undertaken, Mark also prides himself on his creativity, resilience and ability to make the best of any situation. When he isn’t working, you can find him spending time with his wife, Jordan, and their son, Owen, playing disc golf with friends or getting up early to cheer on Chelsea FC.\n\nJohn Underwood\n\nPhotographer\n\nTrained in the U.S. Navy School of Photography, John has held many creative leadership positions during his storied Purdue career. A keen observer with an artistic eye for composition, he enjoys how the creative process unfolds and aims to capture images that support the concept.\n\nJohn was part of the first Big Ten university photo team to transition entirely to digital. He continues to find innovative ways to support the University’s visual brand.\n\nWhen he’s not shooting, John likes to take rides on his Harley. He enjoys traveling and would love to drive the Italian countryside in a sports car one day.\n\nMike Willis\n\nMarketing Technology Process Manager\n\nA desire for discovery and knowledge led to a minor in biology, but Mike turned to a newer path and in the mid-‘90s began his Purdue career as the news service’s web and technology manager.\n\nIn his current role, he serves as a crucial link between marketing and IT, implementing new technologies to achieve marketing goals. His vast institutional knowledge casts him as the de facto archivist for the department.\n\nAs a reasonably skilled photographer, Mike would love to hit the road and take up travel photography. He also attends pop culture conventions in costume.\n\nDalani Young\n\nPhoto and Video Project Coordinator\n\nGrowing up, Dalani’s enthusiasm for photography was a pastime she could enjoy with her sister and friends in 4-H and yearbook class – she didn’t know how it would help forge her path. While earning her bachelor’s degree at Purdue, she saw opportunities to turn her passion into a career that she could happily pursue.\n\nAs a Boilermaker, Dalani’s talent and hard work led to several photography positions, contributing to campus organizations such as The Exponent and Purdue Athletics. After graduation, she gained work experience with coordinating, communicating and brand building, perfectly propelling her into her current role as the photo and video project coordinator for Purdue Marketing and Communications.\n\nWith an energetic spirit and an eye for detail, Dalani plans, problem solves and manages logistics for the team’s photo and video shoots. On the weekend, she loves to recharge and rest up with a little TV time and the best breakfast (Pancakes? Yes, please). You’ll likely find her two Australian shepherds nearby.\n\nKayla Albert\n\nSenior Science Writer/Communication Specialist\n\nGrowing up, Kayla thought she’d become a novelist. Now, she writes news stories for a living and reads a lot of fiction on the side.\n\nAs senior science writer, Kayla’s charged with conveying research discoveries and inventions in science and engineering. As communications specialist, she serves as a liaison for reporters around the globe, connecting them with engineering experts who can comment on major events and trends, ranging from natural disasters and disease to autonomous vehicles and space missions.\n\nKayla enjoys order and is really bothered by pictures that hang askew. One of her favorite thrills is checking something off her to-do list.\n\nValerie O’Brien\n\nDirector of Internal Communications\n\nAs the point person for Purdue Today, Valerie keeps a pulse on campus happenings and leads the team that informs faculty and staff of employment-related news. She stewards communications that build affinity, community, morale and investment in the university among Purdue employees. She’s a Purdue graduate herself with a bachelor’s in professional writing.\n\nA music lover, Valerie likes to curate her own playlists for whatever she’s doing — working, walking, cooking or holding a dance party with her kids. She also enjoys travel and dreams of taking a long summer road trip out west with her family to camp, hike and visit national parks.\n\nAmy Patterson Neubert\n\nDirector of External Media Strategy\n\nA focus on strategic media relations and developing strategic content empowers Amy to help others — specifically earned media — tell Purdue’s best stories.\n\nA two-time Purdue graduate, Amy earned her bachelor’s in English and her master’s in health communication with a concentration in public relations and social marketing. She uses that PR expertise to train top University faculty and scientists on media relations, helping them contextualize the significance of their complex research for a general audience. She leads the team’s development of a proactive earned media outreach strategy to identify, write, place and cadence the University’s most strategic external stories, especially related to science.\n\nAs a science communicator, Amy is naturally fascinated by the beauty found outdoors and is often hiking or walking trails.\n\nMicheal Burgess\n\nMedia Data Analyst\n\nA tidy and organized person by nature, Micheal Burgess gets immense satisfaction from finding patterns in chaos. As a media data analyst, he finds this skill handy when looking for and compiling data on Purdue’s media placements, unique views and how far into the world our brand has reached.\n\nMicheal is a self-described problem-solver, but he knows when to let go and go with the flow. He often reassures himself and others that “it’ll all come out in the wash.”\n\nHe loves road trips with friends but hopes to escape one day to a remote lakeside cabin where he can kick back to enjoy nature and watch college football — he usually cheers for Purdue and Mississippi State.\n\nLarry Farr\n\nAdministrative Assistant\n\nIf there is a better, simpler, more efficient way to do something, Larry will find it. As the department’s Sherpa, he consistently focuses on the next step to move forward and accomplish objectives.\n\nAn aspiring novelist, Larry writes fiction in his spare time. On the job, he spends a lot of time working with other people’s text, in addition to managing data, calendars and files. Although he’d love to become a full-time author, with his obliging nature, he’d probably still end up assisting people with projects in Excel.\n\nAdaptable, responsible and innovative, Larry is always willing to lend a helping hand.\n\nPhillip Fiorini\n\nLead Project Editor\n\nWhen Phillip joined Purdue in 2005, he brought nearly 25 years of experience as an editor, reporter and manager at newspapers from Texas and Florida to Indiana and Washington, D.C. Now fully immersed in digital marketing, his highly developed insights and instincts enable him to promote the exciting things underway at the university.\n\nA fervent champion of the power of words, Phillip’s role as editor calls on him to help others fine-tune their writing to effectively tell an emotional, powerful story.\n\nPhillip has long supported local music organizations and served on multiple boards, including the Lafayette Symphony Orchestra, Long Center and Tippecanoe Chamber Music Society.\n\nKami Goodwin\n\nSenior Writer, Executive and Internal\n\nGive Kami a goal and she can build a strategy and create the communication components to achieve it. She collaborates with the Marketing and Communications team as well as internal and external partners to ensure efficient executive-connected public relations. Her role has an emphasis on presidential initiatives and web content updates.\n\nKami is no stranger to meeting with multiple stakeholders and writing against a deadline. She spent six years as the lead communication and marketing specialist for the university’s Department of Agricultural Economics. Before that, she was at WLFI-TV in West Lafayette, working as a technical director and promotions producer.\n\nAway from a computer, Kami loves anything that gets her outdoors, including hiking, kayaking and biking. After earning a bachelor’s degree in communication from the University of Texas at Arlington and a master’s degree in mass communication from the University of Central Florida, she appreciates Indiana’s change of seasons — especially when rivers are running in the spring, and she can meet her friends at a kayak launch for their first float of the year.\n\nKim Held\n\nClerk\n\nEveryone knows that if you are meeting with Kim, she’ll always arrive early. Unfailingly dependable and exceedingly efficient, she’s the secret weapon that helps the news team function like a well-oiled machine. Always willing to help where needed, she’s frequently accepted roles that transcended her job description.\n\nAway from the office, Kim volunteers with her church, impresses with her fancily decorated cakes and rocks her role as grandma.\n\nHer permanently cheery outlook brightens even the dreariest of days. She’s a true believer that “Not every day is good, but there is something good in every day.”\n\nBrian Huchel\n\nSenior Writer/Communication Specialist\n\nWith his acute observation skills, there’s almost nothing Brian doesn’t notice. After earning his stripes as a newspaper reporter, he transitioned to his current role writing on a variety of topics from space to education.\n\nUnfailingly dependable, Brian is always ready to pitch in whenever anyone on the team needs help. When he was younger, he wanted to be a police officer. Although he doesn’t have a badge, he does stand up for people who are being pushed around.\n\nBrian loves to experiment in the kitchen. He occasionally writes poetry and once took a stab at writing short stories.\n\nIzzy Karpinski\n\nElectronic Communications Specialist\n\nGood things come from always asking great questions – Izzy Karpinski has learned that staying curious is the key to finding interesting subjects and telling compelling stories. In her role as electronic communications specialist, she can combine her natural creativity and love for organization to help the Strategic Communications team with production, analytics and content.\n\nIzzy’s background in news prepared her for collaborating with many people and recognizing the details that make a final piece great. A love for films merged with strengths in writing led her to major in telecommunications at Purdue. After graduating, she worked for TV stations in West Lafayette and Indianapolis as a producer.\n\nAfter spending so much time around an array of media, what could possibly pique Izzy’s interest? Answer: anything on the quirky side. She’s a ’90s boy band expert and appreciates a cheesy throwback movie. On the weekends, she loves exploring nearby neighborhoods with her family, finding the best coffee shops, farmers markets and local festivals.\n\nChristy McCarter\n\nSenior Emerging Media Specialist\n\nWith both a master’s degree and a Ph.D. in medieval literature and archival studies, plus almost a decade of experience teaching at a college level, Christy McCarter provides a fresh perspective on traditional and emerging methods of communication. This extensive study of the past with an eye toward the future has equipped her with a unique set of skills to discover what makes Purdue audiences tick, where they get their news and how we can leverage that information to provide the best experience possible.\n\nA leader by nature, Christy takes on the role of coach in many capacities, including as captain of her local roller derby team.\n\nWes Mills\n\nSenior Strategic Communicator and Public and Media Relations Specialist\n\nFrom on-air personality to producer and writer to TV news manager, Wes has done it all. Whether interviewing astronauts and C-suite executives or eyewitnesses when there’s breaking news, Wes knows that everyone has a story to tell – and he’s there to listen.\n\nAs a teammate, Wes prides himself on his commitment and readiness to step in whenever and wherever. When he isn’t working, you can find him reading historical biographies and spending time with his family. One of Wes’ highest professional accomplishments was helping South Bend’s WNDU-TV win best news operation in the country. The award, Wes says, wasn’t just about the ratings – but a reflection of sound on-air judgment and community impact.\n\nTrevor Peters\n\nLead Communication Specialist, National Media\n\nFor Trevor Peters, there’s nothing like driving down State Street in West Lafayette to work each morning. Peters is a third-generation Boilermaker who defines himself on three things: faith, family and Purdue.\n\nAs a kid, he dreamed of becoming a television news anchor — which he did, first working in Lafayette and then Cincinnati. Today, Peters sits on the other side of the desk, promoting Purdue to major news outlets across the world. Whether in his current role, as a news anchor or just telling a story to his friends, what Peters loves most is the reaction from getting to tell a good story.\n\nCarly Rosenberger\n\nInternal Communications Specialist\n\nCarly Rosenberger believes that a large part of becoming a good writer is being observant. She began practicing her observation skills from a young age, always choosing to take a back seat and observe situations before acting. Her keen investigative skills contribute to her success as an internal communications specialist who tells Purdue’s stories with an eye for detail.\n\nOriginally from Otterbein, Indiana, Carly is proud of the circle of close family and friends she has built that support her to this day — she still makes time to kayak, camp or otherwise spend time with many of her high school friends.\n\nMichael Robb\n\nVideo News Content Producer\n\nMichael Robb has a motto: “if you’re not prepared to be wrong, you’ll never come up with anything original.” The quote, originally from a TED Talk, hangs on his wall to remind Michael never to second-guess himself. And when working in his chosen field, he rarely has the luxury of time to do that.\n\nWhen the moment comes, Michael is always ready to grab his equipment and be the first man filming the action. Even if the action is as unassuming as a Purdue professor’s analysis of the most recent worldwide Netflix hit.\n\nWhen Michael isn’t behind the camera, he prefers to absorb other people’s creative work to relax and inspire him for future projects. His favorite type of media is animation, listing “How to Train Your Dragon,” “Coco,” “The Incredibles” and “The Emperor’s New Groove” as need-to-watch titles for any animation lover.\n\nTom Schott\n\nDirector, Executive Communications\n\nAt age 12, Tom started his own baseball magazine. Years later, he’s still energized by the process of storytelling. What started as a 10-month internship blossomed into a career at Purdue that included nearly 30 years in Purdue Athletics communications. Now, Tom focuses on executive communications for the university – notably the Board of Trustees, Office of the President and Office of the Provost.\n\nA prolific writer, Tom has authored/co-authored four books on Purdue sports, and his bylines have graced dozens of magazines, newspapers and other publications. A strong proponent of public education, he’s served on the West Lafayette Community School Corporation board of trustees and the West Lafayette Schools Education Foundation board of directors.\n\nDerek Schultz\n\nSenior Strategic Communicator and Media Relations Specialist\n\nGrowing up in Connecticut, Derek imagined someday becoming the play-by-play announcer for his beloved New York Knicks. Those dreams led him into a career in sports media, where he worked as an Indianapolis sports radio host, columnist and podcaster for more than a decade.\n\nA natural people person, Derek leverages his Indianapolis media experience to strengthen existing relationships and cultivate new ones as he spreads the word about Purdue’s work in Indy and beyond.\n\nDerek and his wife, Ashley, love to travel. They hope to take their son, James, to all 50 states by the time he graduates high school. James has already visited 20 states as of this writing, and he’s only 6, so he’s well on his way.\n\nTorrie Sheridan\n\nSenior Writer, Executive and Presidential\n\nTorrie is proud to put her passion for writing and wordsmithing to use while propelling her alma mater forward.\n\nWhile assisting President Mung Chiang and other university leaders with communication plans, public relations strategies, presentations, correspondence, background briefings and other messaging duties, Torrie gets stuff done with ever-present optimism.\n\nShe loves to get outdoors, whether it’s to snow ski or hang out at the lake. And regardless of whether it’s hot or cold outside, Torrie is always up for starting her day with an iced caramel latte.\n\nErin Smith\n\nEditor\n\nErin Smith puts her boundless curiosity to use by paying close attention to the minutiae in every document she edits – and she has worked on some big projects! Before joining our team, Erin edited numerous New York Times bestselling books – including titles by Francine Rivers and Joel C. Rosenberg – as well as “Coming Back Stronger” by Purdue football legend Drew Brees.\n\nWhen she’s not helping share the stories of her alma mater, Erin likes to read, help out with her church’s youth group and listen to music by her favorite artist, Steven Curtis Chapman. She’s also involved with New Life for Haiti, an organization that built and operates a model school, houses vulnerable children and develops community health, agronomy and animal care programs to support Haitian communities.\n\nBrandon Spaulding\n\nEditor\n\nBrandon’s love for stories started in elementary school, when he created his first book for a class assignment. His excitement for that project evolved into making his own short stories, neighborhood newsletters and sports publications at home in his free time. What he didn’t know as a kid was that his passion for storytelling and print media would drive him to his career as an editor for Purdue.\n\nIn his first full-time editing role, Brandon is excited to join the Purdue community to ensure Boilermaker stories are told at their best. He looks forward to collaborating with writers to present a clear and effective message to readers.\n\nWhen he’s not editing, you can find him reading, hiking, playing ultimate frisbee or perfecting his home cooking.\n\nBrittany Steff\n\nSenior Science Writer/Communications Specialist\n\nOne of those kids who scored really well in English, but actually liked science better, Brittany found a way to merge both her passion and her skills as a science writer. She majored in biology at Purdue, so she understands the scientific stuff and knows how to interpret cool discoveries and innovations for a general audience, whether the revelation is among the stars, lurking inside the human body or in the quantum depths of matter itself.\n\nShe spent nearly a decade writing for the Smithsonian’s National Zoo. Also a hobby photographer, animals are, naturally, among her favorite subjects.\n\nLisa Tally\n\nSenior Editor\n\nAsked to describe herself, Lisa Tally is quick to respond: persnickety. As an editor, it comes with the territory. She abides by the saying, “God is in the details — and so is the devil.”\n\nTally is also passionate about the broader picture. Her Purdue career has spanned three decades and seemingly every corner of campus. Over that time, the relationships that Tally has nurtured have given her deep institutional knowledge and keen insight into the workings of campus life.\n\nWhen not at her day job, Tally can be found working out The New York Times crossword puzzle, walking her dog or playing piano for her church or local theater productions. She has performed twice for Purdue’s theater program — as part of an ensemble for “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” and in the pit for “Cabaret.”\n\nSharel Welch\n\nSenior Communication Strategist\n\nSharel has a deep love for people and story and puts those passions to use in her role as senior communication strategist for Purdue University in Indianapolis. Her creative use of communications extends to the rest of her life, too. Whether she’s acting in a play, singing in her church choir or reading a mystery novel, Sharel says she loves being able to create something meaningful to share.\n\nA proud mom of three daughters, Sharel says her favorite weekend activities include spending time with her family (which also includes her husband and shelties), visiting museums and simply enjoying the peaceful quiet in her kitchen with a cup of tea — though the reality usually has her enjoying tea on the run!\n\nBut she says peace is a state of mind more than the state of her surroundings and aims for a life that reflects her favorite quote: “Peace: It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart.”\n\nAmy Wilson\n\nEditor\n\nIf you’re looking for a common theme in Amy’s personality, you’d land quickly on “nurturing.” Although her childhood dream of becoming a teacher didn’t materialize in a classroom, she’s highly skilled as a provider of thoughtful, in-the-trenches guidance and support — whether she’s doing that as a mom, a rescuer of animals, an advocate for veterans (in honor of her Marine dad) or an editor.\n\n“I love to read great writing and give it a little nudge (or big push!) to make it really sparkle,” Amy says. “Clear, concise communication is underrated as people face a barrage of messages all the time, so I prefer a whisper to a yell.”\n\nShe loves the outdoors, too, and prefers to spend weekends near a lake or her vegetable garden. Cold Midwestern winters relegate her to a cozy corner of her house with a book, but she thinks that’s not a bad way to spend a weekend, either.\n\nBrian Zink\n\nEditor\n\nThanks to years of experience in the news and editing worlds, Brian Zink has learned that the main goal of being an editor is to go unnoticed by the reader. According to him, your editing is only as good as the mistakes you missed. But he also believes that editing is more than just about catching and fixing grammatical mistakes. For Brian, the most rewarding aspects of his job are interacting with writers and leaving everything you touched just a little bit better than it started.\n\nBrian says he can find a song lyric that fits almost any situation, finding inspiration both through listening to music and playing it. He spends his weekends playing guitar with his musician friends, riding his motorcycle and picking golf back up after 20 years without playing. His advice for finding success in life is to “chase happiness, and accomplishment will follow.”"
