        "text": "The Neighbourhood have fired drummer Brandon Fried following a groping allegation made on Sunday.\n\nMaría Zardoya, lead vocalist of the US indie pop group The Marias, claimed she was felt up under the table by Fried at a bar, who she branded a ‘complete creep’.\n\nThe California rock band has since announced that Fried has been dropped.\n\nZardoya wrote on her Instagram Story over the weekend: ‘I was at a bar last night, and i was groped under the table by brandon fried, the drummer of the neighbourhood.\n\n‘It was one of the most uncomfortable things i’ve ever experienced. i felt an invasion of my space, privacy and body.’\n\nTagging the band, she added: ‘@thenbhd ya’ll need a new drummer, this guy is a complete creep.’\n\nIn response, the Sweater Weather hitmakers posted on the band’s Story a matter of hours later: ‘We are grateful to Maria for coming forward. We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behaviour towards women.\n\n‘As a result of Brandon’s actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighbourhood.’\n\nFried has since issued an apology, blaming his ‘inexcusable and intolerable’ actions on alcohol and substance abuse, which he claims to be getting help with.\n\nHe wrote: ‘I am so terribly sorry to Maria. My actions were inexcusable and intolerable. They are not reflective of who I am as a person, but clearly a reflection of who I become while under the influence.\n\n‘It is evident that I must address my problems with alcohol and substance abuse, which I am now seeking help for.’\n\nThe musician also apologised to fans of The Neighbourhood.\n\nHe added: ‘I want to apologise to women who have been victims of any behaviour that has left them feeling uncomfortable or violated. I am so sorry to The Neighbourhood and our fans for letting them down.’\n\nMeanwhile, the group has recently hit the headlines after Billie Eilish, 20, went official with her romance with The Neighbourhood’s frontman Jesse Rutherford, 31.\n\nThe No Time To Die chart-topper was spotted with the rocker on a series of dates in October, before posting a picture of them dressed as a baby and an old man for Halloween, appearing to mock their age gap.\n\nThey have since made their red carpet debut as a couple, where they decided to – quite literally – get cosy together under a Gucci blanket.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted reps for The Neighbourhood for comment.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Blur to reunite for first headline show in eight years in epic Wembley performance"
