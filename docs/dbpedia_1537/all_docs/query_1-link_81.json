        "text": "This contribution argues that the Historikerstreit, a heated debate between 1986 and 1988 among several prominent West-German intellectuals on the question of the comparability of the Nazi past, not only laid ground for a “comparative ease” of commemorating the German past but even lead to a standardization of memory in policy-oriented peacebuilding. To make this argument, this contribution is separated in two parts: A first part about the historian’s quarrel itself, his main arguments and achievements, and a second part which reasons how the Historikerstreit helped, as an important part of the process that gave rise to the “facing the past” framework, to develop this tendency of standardization of memorialization. To conclude, this text argues that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution for how to face atrocious pasts. To find a responsible way to deal with past atrocities each post-conflict society must examine and deal with its own crimes in their uniqueness. Without wanting to propose a standardized solution for a critique on standardization, the author pleads for new historians’ debates in post-conflict societies – in whatever form they may appear – to find a tailor-made solution for how to deal with the past and how to take responsibility for it.\n\nA question on a relation between the history and the politics is as old as these categories. It is still considered and discussed. However, currently we have a number of reasons to investigate this relation from a new perspective of contemporary phenomena and new research results; the history of science and its relation with social and political changes have been studied in past few decades with a careful attention. The significance of history-politics question is also based on processes of the rebirth of nationalism after the collapse of communism, the erosion of collective identities and identity-conflicts in the European Union. This relation is strengthened by a revolution in communication, and a necessity to redefine relations between government and masses, or state and society. Finally, new framework is sharpened by ongoing globalization. The aim of the conference is to deepen an interdisciplinary discussion on relations between history as a science, collective memory, and state’s narratives about the past. It considers it in two dimensions: internal and international.\n\nThis article seeks to explore some particularities of history writing in the present. It considers in turn the meanings of the contemporary interest in memory, the different ways in which ideas about and images of the past circulate through the mass-mediated public sphere of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, the complexities of publicness and the public sphere, and the shifting boundaries between popular ideas of the past and changes in the discipline of history. It then turns to the example of (West) Germany between the 1960s and now. The article concludes with some reflections on changing perceptions of the overall character of the twentieth century."
