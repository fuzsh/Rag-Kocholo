My deepest thanks to all of them.\n\nJamie Anthony\n\nMy name's Jamie Anthony and I was born 1981 in Edmonton, Canada, to Scottish parents who 3 years later divorced and moved back to Scotland where I've lived ever since. I presently live in the ABSOLUTE back of beyond, a small island community called Orkney in northern scotland. Since social life relies on being a redneck (which I am NOT) i have lived inside my computer for virtually my entire teenage years and am now at University in Dundee. I have a few friends, which I like but can't really be arsed socialising with much. I have never had any sort of relationship with a female, in fact I've never even kissed a girl. My non-musical interests include films, computers, history, and a little bit of literature & art. My top 5 favourite films are Apocalypse Now, One flew over the cuckoo's nest, Bladerunner: the director's cut, Taxidriver, and Unforgiven (1992 version).\n\nNow onto the music... My favourite artists (at present) would have to be Jethro Tull, Yes, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Moody Blues, Nick Drake, Cat Stevens, The Beatles, Genesis, Marillion, Camel, Caravan, Gentle Giant, Dire Straits, King Crimson, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Van Morrison, ELP, The Smiths, REM, and a few others... I also like loads of classical like Stravinsky, Chopin, Bach, Mozart, Brahms, and even Beethoven wrote some good tunes. Basically, I LOVE progressive rock, and just can't wait to discover another great prog band I didn't know about. No, not Van der Graaf Generator, I've tried (and failed) them. I haven't got a clue what the future may bring, and quite frankly, I don't care (I have NO ambitions). My deepest admirations for the creation and constant growth of this page, George, it is truly a work of unparalleled art on the web. Oh, I also agree with most of your opinions a LOT more then I used to. Wayhay!\n\nTomas Arias\n\ntomas arias. date of birth: 1982. born in panama,panama.studying in north carolina\n\ni enjoy reading, going to the beach, etc.\n\ni enjoy listening to pink floyd, the doors, beatles, bob dylan, cat stevens, jimi hendrix, nirvana, breeders, etc.\n\n20.02.2002\n\nKevin Baker\n\nI. Kevin Baker\n\n15\n\nTexas!!!!!!!!\n\nII. I greatly enjoy reading, and following Indecision 2000 has been very memorable. School occupies much of my time though :-(\n\nIII. My favorite band changes quite often; one week the Beatles, one week the Stones, next week Led Zeppelin and so on. I absolutely hate rap, but most else is fair game for me to listen to. My taste is pretty eclectic, but I'm a bit prejudiced towards the Byrds, Three Doors Down (not that they'd ever appear on this site), and ZZ Top since I'm from Texas. Generally speaking, my opinion of music is not so much centered on qualities of the songs or the band beyond how much I actually like the music. Originality and uniqueness do sometimes play a part in my opinions, but I love a lot of not particularly groundbreaking music just because...wel, I dunno, I guess it just rubs me the right way. I am learning to play guitar, I have my own site (www.geocities.com/andreea_n_byrdsfan/index.html), John Entwhistle was a fabulous bassist, and go Dubyah!!!!!!!!! Sorry, it' that Texas instinct again.\n\n13.12.2000\n\nMichael Battaglia\n\nI. Name: Michael Battaglia\n\nAge: 21\n\nCountry: USA\n\nBirth/Residence: New Jersey\n\nSocial Status: Um, does pharmacy student still living at home count as an answer?\n\nII. Non Music Stuff: Hm, I guess school is one of those things, as much as it drives me crazy half the time. I read an awful lot and try to read as many things as I can in science-fiction or literature (no Russian authors yet alas, but I'm working on it . . . I figure I should try War and Peace at least once). And even though they rot my brain, I read comics too. To round out my meager life, especially since I don't want that much TV, I try my hand at being an amateur writer. When all else fails, I work at a library, when I should be working in a pharmacy. Oh well.\n\nIII: Music Stuff: Here's the fun part. I really do try to listen to almost anything, I've got a general record collection of a few albums of just about every band you review, though I'm more slanted toward the late seventies and beyond. My favorite band is probably REM, for the same reason you love the Beatles so, it was the band that got me into music and I know they're not perfect but as far as my subjective little head is concerned, they can do no wrong. Other than that I'll give just about anything a try, I love Genesis and Bob Dylan and the Beatles and the Who and Elvis Costello but I listen to a lot of obscure 80's/90's bands like Neutral Milk Hotel, Pavement and Yo La Tengo. For some reasons I can't really get into the blues or rap, it just all sounds the same to me. The only genre I really find myself disliking is the whole \"manufactured\" boy/girl/thing band thing because to me it seems to be the total opposite of what music is about, though once in a while a song stands out as forgettably catchy. I figure everyone's allowed at least one good song. So I guess that makes me the \"branching out eclecticist\" type. Go me.\n\nMy criteria for rating music and music reviewing are basically the same. In my little world (and on the review page I tried to work on once before school got in the way) any album that contains a series of absolutely perfect songs, all of which are memorable and enjoyable, deserves a ten out of ten. So I'm more the subjective type, I don't know enough about music to attempt to be objective, I can barely make out melody or chords or any of that stuff. I'm more a lyrics guy, so they could be banging on pots for all I know, if the words are good, I'm sold. So when I did attempt to write some reviews, I mostly just described why I like the song and I figure if the reasons why I like a song coincided with someone else's, then they might go out and try it. One day I'll get my site up and running (I got about a hundred decent reviews right now) and . . . and you'll all see. You'll all see how good I am. Or not.\n\nBut as you probably figured I am not a musician, I barely know which way to hold a guitar and I wouldn't know two chords if they stood on either side of me and slapped me. But I figure that shouldn't stop me from enjoying music and how it sounds, I may not know why I like a song, but the fun's in trying to explain. For me at least, you might not be finding it as fun reading this.\n\n06.12.2000\n\nEric Benac\n\nI. i'm eric benac. i live in michigan in the US of AMERICA. boo. any ways, i'm a college student and single. just turned 21 recently: fun.\n\nII. going to college to uh become a teacher. non music related things? i like to read and write, i fancy myself something of a poet and author. and i wrote a nice review for calling all stations that i'm sure george would like. :D that is a bad album. i disgress. i like to be around friends, i guess i'm personal, even though i do spend alot of time alone. right now i'm living with my parents, but in the fall i'll be up at my new apartment going to school again. i'm single, and have been for about a year. not really looking too hard: it can be a pain in the ass, but it would be nice at the same time. i work at A&W and it's an alright job.\n\nIII. Favorite bands (no order, just whatever comes to mind) The beatles, the rolling stones, the who, Yes, Genesis, the beach boys, kate bush, ween, elvis costello, led zeppelin, talking heads, the kinks, frank zappa, the pixies, the stooges, beck. the mama's and the papas, john lennon solo, paul mccartney solo, black sabbath, the cure (and many more :) )\n\nLeast favorite bands: ooh this will be fun. I despise \"the boss\" springsteen. i hate hole, and i also strongly dislike \"dream theater\". aerosmith is pretty bad too. plus, i hate with a passion all these \"new rock\" bands like the strokes and the white stripes. boring retreads of past \"garage rock\" (if it can even be called that: it's just mostly boring dated easy guitar pop rock) weezer (MY MOST HATED BAND EVER). also i hate punk rock (most of it any ways) and i'm going to write an essay about why punk rock is the most boring, conservative, useless music i've ever heard in my life (asides from the ramones, the minutemen, fugazi, and a few others). :D! i'm probably an elitist.\n\noh, i prefer to like as much music as possible, but i've never been able to dig much funk, soul, or jazz music (it all sounds the same, what the?). so i guess i mostly only like rock, but i like a wide range of bands and styles within that genre: i do prefer \"older\" bands, but there are some great \"newer\" bands like ween doing great music. i'd like a site of my own but that'd be like so much work and i don't know html or any of that crap and don't have the patience to make one. i play guitar bass and keyboards poorly, and i do write music, some on paper, mostly on guitar pro on my comp though cuz i can write really complicated stuff and listen back to it! i could never play the music i write.\n\n30.05.2003\n\nTim Blake\n\nI. Personal data.\n\nName - Tim Blake\n\nAge - 22\n\nCountry - New Zealand\n\nCity of birth - Auckland\n\nCurrent residence - Wellington\n\nSocial status - ? Hrm. Quiet, music obsessed type prolly. Usher, data entry guy + guitarist, vocalist, bassist, drummer, song-writer, etc.\n\nII. Personal non-music related interests.\n\nHow do you escape the misery of this life nowand how are you planning to do so in the future?\n\nDon't really have much to say about my own life. It's just kind of... there, y'know. It just is. Really not much more to say about it...it's missing all kinds of social elements, devoid of a lot of emotion (thanks to lack of interaction + lack of social skills + ability to get through to others), extremely predictable and uneventful. But...I fill that void with, less playing and recording the music but more dreaming about it I suppose. I'm sure once I manage to actually work on my music as much as say, you've come to work at your reviews, I'll be set. It's all there waiting for me to take it up, and I'm hoping (in my dreamingness), I'll get around to applying all of it soon. I guess the main thing to conquer is the fear that what I make won't be good, which is stupid because after all you can only become awesome after practice, and part of practice is being bad and working on that, no matter what you are doing. And some are bad for a long long amount of time, but you can still find what you are good at if you just try, and often. And if I was truly doomed to make mediocre music, I'd still be doing what I love and I suppose that is enough to make up for it. (Not that my music is bad per se, but making it original is tough, and my favourite style of music isn't particular original, at least these days, but what is?). I fill the time spent not achieving much by playing my guitar and learning songs, which I do alot...almost everyday, so I guess that is constructive...and of course listening to music which is by far my biggsest past-time. Exploring genres (mostly older artists) and acquiring new stuff is where it is at for me. Plus lots of games, pointless vacuous hanging around with friends (though not always pointless and vacous, just often, and my fault frequently, but we do get through a lot of beer...hooray), lots of movies, and other such things. I guess the non-music question turned all music-y...well, wut can ya do.\n\nIII. Music-related questions (the most important part).\n\nYour musical tastes: favourite and most despised bands/artists/musical genres.\n\nMy most despised bands and artists and genres are all pretty obvious ones...y'know, pop (radio + tv masses kind), rap (extremely limited genre with moments of goodness here and there), a lot of electronic music barring the more atmospheric kinds...techno, drum n'bass, house...sure they sound ok sometimes but they pretty much have no soul, no emotional resonance, they are empty forms of music that stunt your ability to appreciate music horribly. Electronica and more ambient electronic mixes do manage to mix in a human element of emotion via atmosphere, even if they lack any real 'human' contribution. I guess what I really hate is just ear-candy electronic music, usually it is the stuff that sounds 'cool', but that is basically all is has. Pretty much is the trademark of something like drum n' bass. All flashing sounds and colours, no substance, no need to exist except mindless consumption. It has skill (usually of the production and vinyl spinning kind) and it has the 'whee, cool sounding' thing going for it but that is not near enough of anything for me. The more my friends blast it the less I like it. And I'm no elitist, I like a lot of 'shallow' music (which I often find are nowhere near as shallow as some objectivity brigade would say, for reasons they can't bring themselves tounderstand. I use '' marks to illustrate that what I've been told about what is and what isn't shallow is often utter bollocks...maybe they'd tell me I'm shallow, well the typical music critic is the shallowest person alive, scoff), I can just tell when something is having utterly no effect on me (because when music does it floors me), and the entire freakin' genre of drum n' bass even registers. The preceeding paragraph is a mess, but I dislike most current modern pap, particularly that the mainstream is producing, and rap, a lot of electronic, and others, the end.\n\nAre you more of a branching-out eclecticist or a more restricted fan?\n\nI would want to call myself an 'eclecticist' thanks to having been into quite a lot of 'eclectic' stuff over the years, whatever you consider that to be, but...I can't really. The reason is because I am aware that in my heart of hearts I have the most appreciation for simple, to the point music. When I say simple I don't mean, simple-stupid, or simple-emotionless, I mean it doesn't mess around TOO much with trying to go off on exploratory tangents, or it isn't quirky/experimental to the point of excess and so on. That said, a decent amount of my listening goes to what I'd think of as 'eclectic' music like, King Crimson, Yes (all those prog greats) and various other whacky artists, a lot of them being some of my very favourites, but the majority of what I really, really enjoy the most is straight-ahead, no-nonsense ass whooping rock n' roll (like Deep Purple, or The Doors, heck even The Beatles), and next emotionally orientated music that isn't too 'out there' (i.e Nick Cave, or Camel, even Pink Floyd), with ass-kicking metal still there strong but trailing a little. That said I don't tolerate stupidity that much in music, but I don't find a lot of artists people consider 'stupid' to even be that way. I have a strong dislike of elitists and their circular, frozen thinking. And I also dread all this 'objective' shite. Not for fear of it's 'truth' (hah!), but it's ability to systematically shut itself off from all kinds of potentially good albums, songs and artists. It's embarrasingly fickle. The reviews here have at least allowed me to get the opinion of a semi-champion of 'objective thinking' that actually has a clear justification for framing it that way, and they are all reasonable even when they are slagging off some of my favourite artists/albums (one exception: the Uriah Heep reviews which I saw as somewhat disgraceful not for the opinion stated but for the extreme bias totally clouding the writing, unlike with say, Black Sabbath, where the bias (I know it is there) was kept somewhat in check).\n\nWhat's your attitude about music reviewing?\n\nIt's useful only if the person who is writing isn't extremely biased against some element of what he is reviewing (and that can be told by a general sense that I've found imbued with most reviews I've read), and is above bashing, and would opt instead for a more constructive tact of opining. Blind praise isn't so great either. Barring those, a sense of humour can always save the day no matter what the opinion expressed. Are you a musician? What instruments do you play or would like to play? I play guitar, have been doing so for about 8 years but my practicing has been extremely sporadic over time, so I'm not near as good as that figure would have you believe. Only for the past 1-2 years have I consistently practiced all the time, and I think I've got a lot to learn still. Also other stuff I mentioned earlier. Working on my song-craft a bit and trying to get more things recorded, got a nice back-catalogue of things I've made but it isn't so impressive to me, need to get my quality up to my expectations, which is the tricky part.\n\nWho's your favourite bass player?\n\nGeezer Butler, I'd say.\n\nFinal thing - brief history of my music appreciation. I started off in music listening where most anybody does, with The Beatles. When I was a small kid we had Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road vinyls, and my parents played it a lot for me and my sisters. It was mainly a curiosity for me and for years my only musical interaction was The Beatles, Michael Jackson, and repulsively, Michael Bolton. I had my first musical brain explosion around 14-15 when I first heard Sparkle And Fade by Everclear. Years before I had heard Nirvana and decided that it wasn't for me, but I was into like Michael J. then so whatever. Things must have been different because Sparkle And Fade was the most radical music thing to ever happen to me and it remains the first landmark album in my listening. The Beatles were good but seemed more a distraction, at the time.\n\nThis lead me into a spiral of crap music listening, I'll admit. I started to get big on things like Disturbed, Papa Roach, Linkin Park, and other such pap, interspersed with a few good artist like System Of A Down (whose first album I still love), and Soundgarden. I was feeling apathetic one day and started browsing through extreme metal review sites (horror). I come across a review of this little known metal band called 'Opeth'. Oddly, it is described as...beautiful extreme metal...full of acoustic passages, soft vocals and eerie atmospheres in between all of the growling and distortion. Intruiged, I listen to their album 'Blackwater Park' at the music store, and that was the one, singular album that forever changed all of my tastes, to the horror of my friends and family. It was by far the most radical, powerful album I had heard. My friends all denounced my tastes for it but I know that they would never allow themselves to even begin to understand that an album that has growled vocals in it CAN be incredible. That led me into a big 'metal' period. Stuff like Opeth, Edge Of Sanity, In Flames, all great stuff. Then doom metal, My Dying Bride, Candlemass...black metal...Emperor, Dissection, Bathory...classic metal...Iron Maiden, art-metal...Maudlin Of The Well, Arcturus, Ulver, gothy metal...Katatonia, Anathema, viking metal, Enslaved, prog-metal...it goes on and on. One of the most diverse genres that ever existed ever, metal is, because you can mix it with just about anything and if you're creative enough it will work. The last revelation I had was maybe three years ago and it was Black Sabbath - Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Another whim purchase, this served as the gateway through which I've begun to explore the wealth of old music. It led me to King Crimson, which had me get into prog, it led me to Budgie and Deep Purple, my other two current favourite bands, Camel, Pink Floyd, even punk, finally to the 60s...The Doors, Blue Cheer, rediscovering The Beatles, Cream...leading onto Talking Heads and Depeche Mode and The Moody Blues, so on so on so on. My recent thing is solo artist, David Bowie didn't impress nor did Bob Dylan, but I've found The Velvet Underground and Lou Reed and that is well making up for it. So that is basically the story so far. There are about a bazillion other artists I could list off but this message is already far too long. Your site is awesome. Thanks for your time.\n\n01.06.2006\n\nMark Blakemore\n\n1) Personal data\n\nI've just started to add my two-pence worth to this great site so I guess I should add my details now. Well I'm Mark Blakemore, I'm 28 and I live in London.......and I'm a music junkie.\n\n2) Non music stuff\n\nI lived in Liverpool for my first 18 years, then did a degree and doctorate in Cardiff, before following the jobs to god old frantic London. I currently reside in Chiswick which is more relaxed and greener than my previous base in Tooting. I got a wondeful gal Dawn who puts up with my music and is slowly getting brainwashed too!!!\n\nMy work has nothing to do what-so-ever with my PhD - which was the psychology of vision. 4 years training unfortunately wiped out my inspiration for the topic unfortunately. I work as an analyst for the BBC - that pays ok and keeps me in CD's I guess. My dream job would involve music, a journalist perhaps? Tough to get into mind and i would'nt want to a) work for free Or b) report positively on any old crap.\n\nMy other interests involve playing football for perhaps the worse 5-a-side football side in Europe and avidly following the nerve-shreddingly inconsistent Liverpool Football club. Enough about who I am.....\n\n3) Music interests.\n\nWell where do I start. I've kinda gone through all kind of phases and I guess (thanks to sites like these) I always come across new, expensive ways to depreciate my bank balance. I destroy large ammounts of shoe leather trawling through Londons many record shops looking for bargains and rarities and I probably need some kind of help if the truth be told.\n\nMy love affair started with Queen and Led Zeppelin and my thirst for knowledge then led me to hit the books and find out about these guys and who they liked. That led to a two year obsession with da' blues, Free, Cream etc...\n\nMy mother is a huge soul music fan and she always warned me that I would one day really like Stevie Wonder. I always declared I could never respect a musician capable of 'I just called to say I love you' or 'Ebony and Ivory'. Then a strange thing happened at about 16 - I fell totally in love with a girl, cut off my Jimmy Page hair cut and binned my rocker-hippy look. Then she paid me no notice and I became a miserable git wallowing in the more self -pitying sides of my mothers Atlantic and Motown record collection. Then that was it...soul, RnB, blues and Funk for about 3/4 solid years - through Uni. Lots of great stuff here and its still the genre that makes up the bulk of my purchases and collection. The atrists I really admire here are probably the obvious ones - Stevie, Marvin Gaye, James Brown as well as some that are less well known : Tower of Power, War & Donny Hathaway to name but 3.\n\nThen I got hooked on Jazz big time - particularly Miles Davis (In a Silent Way may be in my top 5 of all time), Wayne Shorter, Roland Kirk and Eddie Harris.\n\nIn the last couple of years I've widened my tastes again and revisited some of my early fav's - e.g. Free. I've also got into, and been heavily impressed by, in particular Frank Zappa and Todd Rundgren. I also like King Crimson - although I wish they'd lighten up. I'm less impressed by some other things I've checked out of late , e.g. Yes, Robin Trower, although most things have their merits.\n\nOf late, I think I'm being irreversibly drawn towards latin music - and I think Bossa Nova may be its focus. Thanks to Todd's odd but beautiful - 'With a twist', a re-recording of his classics in this style.\n\nSo shucks I like everything bar crappy manufactured, untalented pop and robotic, unsoulful dance music. I also can't get into Bob Dylans voice.....love his songs but by other people. Listened to too many good soul singers perhaps?\n\nMusician I most admire - Probably Stevie, Todd or a British bloke called Lewis Taylor. He's a one man band who has made two albums in the last 5 years that fuse Marvin Gaye with prog rock elements in a maddenling wonderful way.\n\nFavourite albums include Talking Book(Stevie Wonder), Abbey Road, A Wizard/ A True star (Todd), In a Silent Way (Miles Davis), Here my Dear (Marvin Gaye), Overnite sensation (Zappa)....the list goes on and on.\n\nBest gig - Tower of Power last year. the tightest funkiest band ever - really scary musicianship (although maybe not that many great songs to back it up!).\n\nI do play (guitar, Keys and bass - pretty ordinary in all of them and I can't read music which does me no favours whatsover) and I've been in bands for over 10 years off and on - from crap rock (Funkadelic Shack, Bogus Toadstool) to goodish Jazz-funk (Planet Janet). I used to be the singer in all of the above and my voice is tuneful if unremarkable. I'm currently trying my hand at DIY with a cheap keyboard and a 4-track. The stuff I've recently done is a kind of 4th rate Stevie Wonder - harmonies are coming along though....\n\nI've really been going on.... apologies...but once you start these things its hard to stop.\n\nJeff Blehar\n\nI. Personal Info:\n\nName: Jeff Blehar\n\nAge: 20\n\nCountry: USA\n\nBirth/Residence: well it's kind of hard to hide since (see line below).\n\nSocial Status: Student at Johns Hopkins University\n\nII. Non Music-Related Bunkum:\n\nI'm an avid historian-in-training of totalitarian/authoritarian regimes (esp. the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany), and a voracious reader of pretentious literature. Favorite authors: Thomas Pynchon (natch), Woolf, David Foster Wallace, and the great 19th-century Russians (Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Pushkin, Chekhov), who I have a soft spot for. Also a writer of sorts. I enjoy public speaking, debating, and any sort of opportunity to deliver philosophical or political polemics (I love fighting over stuff which is so pointless). I fear and distrust computers: I don't understand them, and even more inexcusably, they don't understand me.\n\nIn the future I see myself doing Lord-know-what. College professor? Eminence grise-like political advisor? Music reviewer? Rock star? I've seriously considered each possibility, and I'm just vain enough to think I could pull any one of them off. Hey, you gotta believe in your dreams.\n\nIII. Music-Related Bunkum:\n\nEgads. I've made a long circuitous journey (okay, relatively long - since 1995) from 60's rock snob to musical eclecticist. Pretty much every preconceived notion I've had about any genre of music or particular band has been tossed to the wayside as I learn to listen without prejudice and appreciate what's GOOD, not what's hip. I've been wrong in my prejudices (Fleetwood Mac is shitty cocaine-fueled pop crap, Yes is despicable, Genesis is the scourge of all that is good, all music made after 1990 is worthless, etc.) too often to have any these days - nothing is bad per se until I've heard it. And I've heard a lot at this point. I've got a LOT of CDs (at this count, something like 2000, plus 50+ boxed sets), since when other people buy drugs or clothes I just go and get used discs at the local mega-used CD store (never buy new!).\n\nMy tastes reflect George's in many ways; perhaps that's why I like his site so much. My collection is HEAVILY skewed towards 60's and 70's rock, with a shameful lack of material from the 1990's, though I'm working to correct these mistakes. It runs the range from pop to rock to blues to hardcore punk to free jazz to trip-hop, art-rock, prog-rock, and soul/R&B. The only genres I don't care for are rap and techno, though I won't dismiss them outright; it's just not for me. I'd place The Beatles, Stones, Who and Dylan right up there in the pantheon of the greatest, although to be honest I can't get too excited about them anymore - my love for them has settled into a comfortable, lived-in appreciation. I also adore David Bowie up until about 1983 or so, and Elvis Costello and The Clash get my highest Punk/New Wave recommendations, though I highly recommend Graham Parker to anyone who has never heard of him - fabulous stuff. The music which I'm most excited about moves in shifts; while my critical estimation of groups stays more or less the same, the size of my collection requires me to listen to stuff in \"rotation\" so if you catch me at different times I'll be grooving to different people - right now I'm slapping myself for ever thinking Genesis were either a) an atrocious pop band or b) an atrocious prog band. Turns out they were superlative examples of the best of each genre. I think Led Zeppelin and The Doors are horribly overrated (especially The Doors; while I still enjoy listening to most of Zep's stuff, I can barely make it through a Doors album these days without gagging on the overweening pretentiousness and cheesy Manzarek keyboards, even though I once loved them and own all their LPs). Randy Newman is criminally underrated, as are The Byrds, who nobody wants to talk about these days. The only band I currently WORSHIP is Radiohead - although I'm not in a \"they can do no wrong\" mindset, I really think they're flat-out brilliant in all ways melodic, lyrical, production-wise, etc., and that their last three albums are required purchases for anyone with a passing interest in quality modern music. I'm also impressed by Blur's (and to a lesser degree Pavement's) versatility and general ability to wring interesting SOUNDS out of their instruments, and R.E.M. are the outstanding American group of the 1980's.\n\nAs an aside, I used to despise prog-rock as the epitome of everything that was unlikeable, smug, pretentious, and overreaching about western rock music, but I've since had to come around and admit that bands like Genesis, Yes, and King Crimson are actually pretty damn good, if not UNBELIEVABLY GREAT like some would say. And Emerson, Lake & Palmer is still perhaps the worst major group of all time, despite my repeated attempts to assimilate their music. Ugh.\n\nGenerally speaking, my predilections have tended towards art-rock: Bowie, Eno, Roxy Music, Peter Gabriel, VU, The Who's more ambitious work. This would reflect my general bias towards atmosphere and intellectualized music. Three things make a song good for me, in no order: melody, production/atmosphere, lyrics. The first two can be interchangeable if done well enough, but I'm pretty permissive on lyrics. I rarely listen to the lyrics of a song the first time through, and except in special cases like Dylan, Costello, and The Clash (where the lyrics are 3/4 of the appeal), I'm more than happy if a song has a great melody or feel even if its lyrics are banal. Lyrics only become a problem when they're forehead-slappingly bad, i.e. when they prevent me from enjoying the song without feeling like a dip. They can brilliantly enhance a song (and oftentimes do), but it takes a lot for them to detract. If I may be allowed to contradict myself, I also sometimes like music that is intentionally quirky or difficult - I'd put much of Zappa and the art-rockers and even groups like Pavement and Radiohead into this category, at least partially - music that makes me engage it to understand it. This is not the same as saying I like strangeness for strangeness' sake - there NEEDS to be something substantial underneath or else it's hopeless crap - but something about my musical head loves offbeat, crazy-sounding music.\n\nSpeaking more of music, I'm a musician. And I'd like to be one professionally, even. Primarily I'd say I'm a singer with a ridiculous range (I guess naturally my voice falls into that Bono/Thom Yorke archetype, but as far as I know I'm the only person I've met who can (shamefully) sing along to everything Jon Anderson has written in the correct octave without falsetto), but that's only because I trust my voice more than my piano skills (I've been playing since age 5, and I'm pretty good, though nowhere near as accomplished as I should be for that amount of time spent) and my guitar skills (just learning now). I write and perform, and I have a relentless desire to make music that other people somewhere will get and appreciate - a drive to be famous. Who knows? Maybe it'll happen someday. Probably not. Either way, playing music is an absolutely crucial factor in my love of music - 9 times out of 10 I gravitate towards songs that I can sing (all part of my incessant tendency to personalize the music I listen to - it's about ME, you see, not about whoever wrote it).\n\nBest album ever? Impossible to say, though I've settled on a compromise solution with The Who's Quadrophenia. But trying to hold me to that would be like trying to nail jelly to a tree, so don't gimme any flack.\n\nAlright then, that's the sweet & lowdown.\n\n12.12.2000\n\nOleg Bocharoff\n\nI. My name is Oleg Bocharoff. I'm from Moscow and now i'm 33 (and I hope for more). I think your web-site is THE best resource for classic rock and this is the great reason to join your community. I used to work in a couple records labels, also worked for MTV-Russia. Radio Russia and was the editor-in-chief for a couple of heavy metal magazines. I'm an author of several books about punk rock, Metallica, Depeche Mode, etc. Now I'm an editor of russian MAXIM mens magazine (see www.maximonline.ru) My collection includes more than 2.000 CD and some vinyl records never counted by me (now i'm use their covers to decorate home walls)\n\nII. Non musical interests? Nothing that is really great. B-movies, Apple Computers, two children and more beer.\n\nIII. My music interests? Almost any kind of music, except for Russian Rock. I hate it, and my article about (publiched in PLAY Magazine) it was an smash bomb among russian-rock haters. I listen for rock, old rock'n'roll, punk rock. indie rock, punk rock (in which many cite me as a biggest expert in Russia), all metal genres from hard rock to grindcore, reaggae, dub, pop, old school hip-hop, classical music, etc. My favourite bands? The Kinks, The Ramones, Pixies, closely chased by The Beatles, ABBA, The Who and The Byrds.\n\n03.08.2006\n\nChris Boehm\n\nI. Hey, my name is Chris Boehm and I live in Sea Cliff, NY(on Long Island). I was born on February 8, 1981, making me 20 years old. Currently, I'm a junior at SUNY Geneseo, located in Western New York, about half an hour from Rochester. Recently, I changed my major from Accounting to History and Secondary Education. I'm on the quiet side, but I can be humorous when I feel comfortable.\n\nII. My non-musical interests include reading, looking up history, cars, and computers. School and friends are also big priorities which I highly value.\n\nIII. Ahhhhhhh, music. I enjoy Classic Rock and some Heavy Metal immensely. I'll be honest, I used to be a typical teenager who liked the typical bands, so my first favorite band was...Green Day(feel free to laugh here.) I loved the album Dookie for a long time, because it was hard and very, very catchy. After this I grew up a little bit and moved on to Black Sabbath, and from there to Ozzy Osbourne's solo career. Although much better musically than Green Day, the heavy guitar tones started to depress me after a while, so I moved on to the fast twin guitars of Guns 'N Roses. Although less heavy than Sabbath, my hormones were slowing down and I moved into softer music, although I still pop these bands in a good amount of the time.\n\nAfter GNR, I moved into Pink Floyd, which I consider my favorite band. I know everything from Piper to Pulse, and I enjoy most of it. The atmosphere that they manage to create in much of their music is simply stunning. I consider Gilmour's guitar to be among the best in the business, even though many people consider it soul less. Other bands that I enjoy are Dire Straits, The Who, The Doors, The Stones, Simon and Garfunkel, Billy Joel, Dylan, Cream, Deep Purple, Metallica, Van Halen, Grateful Dead, and Pearl Jam, who I consider to be the last great hope of original rock music today.\n\nI hate Rap. I despise Rap. I LOATH Rap. Rap is not music.\n\nIf I haven't been clear, I don't like rap that much, and I don't like Country or Hip-Hop either. I also dislike light pop, i.e. Britney Spears, Back Street Boys, etc and I guess that's why I've always had a thing against the Beatles, for providing a model for this type of music. I steadily lose faith in most of today's music, because all that I think of is that the band I am listening to was fitted to the tastes of today's youth, and are not playing what they really feel or believe. Because of this, there will never be another Pink Floyd, Beatles, Stones, or Who. There will only be inadequate replications of these bands. I'd better stop talking, this is depressing me more than remembering that at one time my favorite band was Green Day :-) I often think about starting my own review site, but I just feel that I don't know enough about music to really be respected. I know what I like, and why I like it, but when I read the depth of George's reviews, or the humor of Mark Prindle, I don't think I could compete with either. But who knows, my taste has improved by leaps and bounds over the years, and my friends usually go to me with music questions.\n\nThat's all for now, great site George, I admire and respect you for your work on it.\n\nEric Bukowski\n\nMy name's Eric Bukowski, 24, part Polish, and part white too. I was born in New Castle, PA but currently reside in Philadelphia, PA. You ask for social status? I'm a partyer with better musical tastes than my friends.\n\nI escape the misery of my life by playing instruments, I've played piano since I was four and picked up bass and guitar along the way and can play some drums. I write music and like to jam with other musicians, none of which are ever as good as I am, which is really, reallly sad. As far as my future, who knows what it holds. At the moment, I'm working mundane, shit-paying jobs, struggling financially and continuing my hobby as a music lover. Whenever I'm totally sick of it I'll go to culinary school (I love to cook) or learn a boring trade so I can at least make halfway decent wages. Music school is out of the question, I'm not sure I'm keen on turning a personal hobby into work. I'm figuring I'm at a sad state now where my purchasing of a turntable this week is considered a money-saving investment on my part so I can hear more music cheaper than buying CD's via used vinyl.\n\nI'm biggest on prog-rock, but I like most any other genre of music. After all, prog incorporates almost all the other genres so it would be stupid to dislike or dismiss those who did those other genres in a simpler fashion. I'm hardly a prog snob. I like the best ABBA had to offer as much as Yes.\n\nAs far as hating musical genres, hardcore rap is the only genre I absolutely can't stand. I can see the fun in Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff or MC Hammer (it's not like I actually like them or think they're good, mind you) but serious, hardcore rap bores the shit out of me. I'll take the most asinine, banal, nu-country schlock over that any day, not that it's a great 2nd choice, but still, it's at least real music played by real musicians.\n\nAs far as having a site of my own, forget it! I need plenty of time to go out drinking.\n\nAs far as playing instruments, scroll up about a dozen paragraphs. Favorite bass player? Chris Squire. Technically not the greatest but he always played tasty shit. As far as my favorite keyboard player, since that's my main instrument? Rick Wakeman, and I feel it's criminal that you hate him more than I do and you have 5 times the solo albums by him that I have. I've had the chance to meet him too, he's super cool and signed my copy of Six Wives. My other claim to fame? Annie Haslam lives about a half hour away from me, in Doylestown. Oooo-eeee-wow!\n\nAs far as George Dubbaya, I don't think he's smart enough to remember to wear socks. I'm not looking forward to him fudging his election for a 2nd term.\n\nAnyways, your site rules and I go on it most every time I'm online, which isn't too often since I'm usually out drinking. Actually I come here every day for ideas on mp3's to download. Then, when I come home drunk I listen to what's downloaded since I've been gone. Sometimes I stay home and drink and impatiently sit by the computer waiting for my downloads to finish. Nevermind that, I'm online all day and don't even drink. I'm a total loser.\n\n10.08.2004\n\nDan Brophy\n\n[Taken off due to personal request.]\n\nRich Bunnell\n\nI. At the moment I'm 17 years old, having been born on June 26, 1983. According to my birth certificate, I was born on June 26, 1982, because the morons at the records department were not sufficient in the use of a typewriter and MADE A TYPO ON MY BIRTHDATE. So they think I'm 18, which is good for getting smokes and porn (nah) but annoying with regard to Selective Services and verifying my age for my driver's license (which I should hopefully be getting finally within the month). I live in Milpitas, an annoyingly badly-structured city on the southern tip of California's SF Bay Area, which places me smack-dab in the Silicon Valley, near the strongholds of Ebay, Yahoo, and Intel, and with close to nil of hope of being able to buy a house following college. I'm single and lacking a girlfriend, in large part because of the fact that I attend a non-co-ed all-male school (insert gay jokes [here]) and also because I'm a fairly shy and restricted person around people I don't know.\n\nII. I wouldn't really call life a \"misery,\" just more of an \"itch.\" Kind of annoying sometimes, but nothing to get worked up about. I'm a huuuuuge fan of The Simpsons, having watched it since it was a short on the Tracey Ullman show (keep in mind that I was FIVE at the time) and having been a dedicated fan ever since then. I'm also addicted to Saturday Night Live, hit-and-miss as it is these days (there has never been a show surrounded with so many interesting backing stories), Futurama, which is a hell of a lot funnier than Simpsons has been for the past three seasons, and most of the shows on Comedy Central, excluding South Park and a few other lame ones. Like Mr. Greenstein, I'm a huge fan of Kurt Vonnegut (it helps that I'm a teenager and thinks it's funny when an author draws a picture of an asshole in the intro to one of his books) and my favorite books of all time are \"Catch-22\" and \"The Phantom Tollbooth\"(the best children's novel ever). I used to be addicted to video games, but as high school set in I kind of grew out of them. I'm still indebted to the Mega Man series (the epic that never changes) and a few RPG's like Chrono Trigger and the Final Fantasy series (not 8). I used to play Sierra computer games, like George, before that company turned into absolute festering crap. The latest King's Quest game has a freaking lifebar, for Christ's sake! IT'S AN ADVENTURE SERIES, not an action game! -TANGENT OVER-\n\nIII. Music-wise, I like to consider myself an eclecticist but I'm simply not a fan of rap, reggae, or roots-rock (though I might be coming around on that last one). Unlike many people I know, I don't judge music based on my first listen-- the most annoying thing to me is when I play music like Bowie in my drawing class and my friends in the class dismiss nearly every song from merely the first 30 seconds. Whatever. Stylistically I've carved myself into a rut of post-punk new wave, progressive rock and '80s alternative, with some classic rock fit in. My favorite bands being XTC (DUUUUH), the Beatles, They Might Be Giants, The Who, Talking Heads, Bowie, the Police, R.E.M., Genesis, Yes, The Jam and Midnight Oil. Regardless of how George has pigeonholed me in the past, I am NOT a fan of synth-pop, as a good 95% of the genre is absolutely lame, but since I did review pages of Depeche Mode and the Pet Shop Boys (two of the only good synthpop bands ever, even if the former has put out some really lame crap) I'm automatically an afficionado. Whatever. When I listen to music, I usually try to find its good points rather than approaching an album with an automatic bias; that's why my reader comments are on the average more positive than other commentators.\n\nAnd that's all I have to say about that. Oh yeah, and despite what some people who don't like to have fun might tell you, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic is a god. So is Gumby, but that's another story.\n\n13.12.2000\n\nMatthew Byrd\n\nOk, my name is Matthew Byrd and I live in Primghar, Iowa (in the U.S.A. if you're not familiar with U.S. geography). Well, I'm 17 so I my 'social staus' is student, I guess. I DID used to live all the way over in South Korea.... so, I'm not a fully-realized country-bumkin... or is it bumbkin? Ok, well that's enough of this nonsense.\n\nI do read a bit more than some people (not nearly enough, though).... I play no sports adequately... or musical insruments. I escape the misery of this life by.... well, realizing I'm better than everybody I'm around.... ok, maybe not. It does kind of bother me though, no one around this area (i.e. my family, but do they count?) agrees with me about ANYTHING especially music, oh well though.\n\nI would say I like almost every genre of music.... and almost every-type of rock 'n' roll (almost). ok, here's my patented 'greatest albums' list\n\n1.Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - The Beatles (No Comment)\n\n2.Blonde On Blonde - Bob Dylan (It really is a step up from the great 'Highway 61 Revisited' but doesn't contain a scrap of politics in it.... does anybody else think that 4th Time Around is more of an insult than a compliment to John's (Lennon, of course) Norwegian Wood?)\n\n3.Abbey Road - The Beatles (Absolutely, a grandeur statement... the 2nd half really does it for me, though.\n\n4.London Calling - The Clash (I really enjoy all the meledious... err meledies in this new wave statement. 'From the hundred year war to the crimea, with a lance and a musket and a roman spear' from The Card Cheat is perhaps my favorite part of this one.)\n\n5.Highway 61 Revisited - Bob Dylan (What can I say? Really, what can I say, one of the best)\n\n6.Exile On Main Street - Rolling Stones! (Ok, fine maybe a bit overrated, but I think I like the feel of this album more than any other album on this list. Mixing R&B, soul, and country this is really a clasic album.... with a few throwaways, though. 'Tumbling Dice' may be their best song.\n\n7.Born To Run - Bruce Springsteen (Ok, here we go, I'm not going to defend this album, but wow, this is truely a masterpiece from the streets of New Jersey.)\n\n8.Beggar's Banquet - The Rolling Stones (Is there a greater song than 'Sympathy For The Devil'..... I absolutely love the feel of this album.\n\n9.This Year's Model - Elvis Costello (Can anybody make so much good pissed-off music?)\n\n10.What's Goin' On? - Marvin Gaye (Ok, a wee bit overrated, but how can you resist his sweet voice?)\n\n11.Quadrophenia - The Who (Townsend is showing what he's made of on this huge epic.... 5:15 and Love Reign O'er Me are excellent.)\n\n12.Blood On The Tracks - Bob Dylan (Who can write a more personal song than Dylan?)\n\n13.Purple Rain - Prince (Right now I am pretty enamored by this one, it will pretty drop down the list soon.)\n\n14.Bridge Over Troubled Water - Simon And Garfunkel (mmm mm, the sweet melodies and volcals are great.)\n\n15.The Beatles (White Album) - The Beatles (This one drops a few places thanks to Reolution 9.)\n\n16.Let It Bleed - Rolling Stones (I'm gonna stick a knife right down your throat, and baby it hurts hm hm hm mmm duh de duh, whoops I got a bit carries away... an blues-rock triumph.... but does anybody else just not buy 'You Can't Always Get What You Want'?)\n\n17.Darkness On The Edge Of Town - Bruce Springsteen (Hey, he sounds as pissed-off as Elvis Costello, what happened?)\n\n18.Revolver - Bealtes (I don't appreciate this one as much as some.)\n\n19.The Doors - Doors (The End.... Freud and the rest of the psychoanalysts are drooling to get their hands on something like that.)\n\n20.My Aim Is True - Elvis Costello (This made Costello a force to be reckoned with, and with good reason.)\n\n21.Are You Experienced? - Jimi Hendrix (This is one of the greatest debuts in rock.)\n\n22.Who's Next? - Who? (ok, I'm getting tired of commenting on each one of these.)\n\n23.Sticky Fingers - Rolling Stones (I agree with you on 'I Got The Blues' and 'Wild Horses' sounds contrived when put next to 'Sweet Virginia'.)\n\n24.Nebraska - Bruce Springsteen\n\n25.Physical Graffiti - Led Zeppelin - (Is there a better riff-maker than Page? Kashmir is excellent.... but Plant's vocals are almost uneeded.)\n\n26.Graceland - Paul Simon\n\n27.Bringin' It All Back Home\n\n28.1999 - Prince\n\n29.Rubber Soul - Bealtes (I have never liked this one as much as some)\n\n30.Born In The U.S.A. - Bruce Springsteen (This one, I like, a lot)\n\n31.Green River - CCR\n\n32.IV - Led Zeppelin (When The Levee Breaks is really on par with Stairway To Heaven)\n\n33.Imperial Bedroom - Elvis Costello (not an ounce of rock 'n' roll on this one)\n\n34.Remain In Light - Talking Heads\n\n35.Nashville Skyline - Bob Dylan (Underrated, underrated, underrated)\n\n36.At Folsom Prison - Johhny Cash\n\n37.Between The Buttons - Rolling Stones\n\n38.Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere - Neil Young\n\n39.Harvest - Neil Young (I like this one, George)\n\n40.Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - Elton John (The sweet meledies really win me over)\n\n41.The Wild, Innocent And The E-Steet Shuffle (Each song is like a play)\n\n42.Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. (Explosive tales from New Jersey)\n\n43.Tommy - The Who\n\n44.Steely Dan - Aja\n\n45.Some Girls - Rolling Stones\n\n46.ok, ok......... this conclude the list for now.... the top of the list will probably not change a lot but the rest will probably change drastically....\n\n27.06.2004\n\nFernando Henrique Canto\n\nMy full (boring) name is Fernando Henrique Canto (aka Fernie), but I discard the middle name because it makes me sound like I'm the former Brazilian president. Yes, I live in Brazil, and I like it! I think. I was born in August, 1985 - which makes me 18 at the time of writing. I'm a little bizarre kid who doesn't comb his hair, and sometimes looks like Philip Glass, other times like John Deacon, but that doesn't really matters.\n\nOne of my main interests is computers - especially programming - and it has been since I was, uh, 6. I am from the time when DOS still ruled our lives, and CD-ROMs were a distant dream. My other interest is The Simpsons. Okay, in fact, I'm a maniacal psychotic Lisa Simpson fanatic. You know. She was the reason of my life around 5 years old, and since then, she has been like a goddess to me. My love for her transcends human comprehension: you either have to be a schizoid, or see her in the same light as I do. I often write Simpsons fanfiction, and I frequent a group of Simpsons fans that ALSO write fanfiction that call themselves the Groening FanWorks Central and meet themselves at www.simpworks.com . Visit us!\n\nAnd then, there is music. It's not just an interest, you know. It's the reason of my life. It's the only thing in this terrestrial world that I can have faith on (I'm serious). My love for music started with Queen, around 6 years ago, and since then, I've been collecting music like a madman. Favourite artists now include The Who, Pink Floyd, Rush, Yes, Radiohead and The Residents (how I love these guys). I adore Mike Oldfield, who is, in my humble opinion, hideously underrated as a composer and guitarist. Also, I love Jean Michel-Jarre, who is unfairly neglected, and has written one of the best songs in the universe: 'Equinoxe 5'. I also write music on the computer. I have been doing so since 6 years, mostly, and my latest album - Musics For Highways (yes, MUSICS) - is available for sale on www.lulu.com/sirmustapha . Sorry for the spamming, but we oughta advertise! If you're interested on instrumental pop-art-rock, check it out! I play the keyboards, but not that much. I'm taking classes at the moment, too.\n\nBut in general, that's it. I have a little thing for artists that somehow do something DIFFERENT, you know. I'm getting into Brian Eno (my God, is that man a genius), and I love Bob Marley. I like music when it's SPECIAL, somehow. I don't care what it is, it just needs to do SOMETHING with me. If I can have fun with a piece of music, any kind of fun, it's valuable to me.\n\nSo there you have it. I have a music reviewing site of my own, at www.geocities.com/sirmustapha . I know, Geocities sucks, but what can I do? Thanks for your attention for reading this. Bye!\n\n12.11.2003\n\nKoka Chernov\n\nHi. My name is Koka (Konstantin) Chernov. My friends gave me a funny nickname - Blackmore (in Russian Chernyi means Black).\n\nI'm 19 years old. I was born in Zarechny town, Urals, Russia (somewhere between Europe and Asia). Currently a 3-year student of USTU, physical-engeering department. Obviously, I've got some interest towards physics and math. I've graduated from language liceum and therefore should have become George's counterpart someday. But I've decided that humanitarian path is too easy & dull to follow it, so I drastically changed my direction and I'm still happy with it. Right now i'm digging stuff, connected with artificial intellect, neurocybernetics and so on.\n\nSo, I read quite a lot. But, frankly speaking, 90% - specialized literature (it's sad, I know). However, I try not to forget sweet taste of real literature. Orwell, Bradbury and Frish are my favourites. I was taught to appreciate classical English prose in school and I sincerely admire it. I've read several Camu & Sartr compositions lately and I found 'em rather impressive. Apart from literature I'm interested in programming/hacking/formula one. Also I consider watching movies a stupid, worthless occupation.\n\nLike Sabs, I sold my soul for Rock'n'Roll once (aged 9 or 10, I think) and therefore I'm doomed to be a rock'n'roll soldier till my dying day. Queen, Sabbath, Floyd, Maiden, King Crimson, Zeppelin are the best. Other worthy groups/artists (imho): hundreds , so I won't abuse your attention with needless listing, I hope my comments will speak for themselves. Don't get me wrong - I'm quite tolerable to all kinds of music, except cheap pop and modern trash/doom metal.\n\nAnything else? Oh, I almost forgot about my drums. Yeah, I'm a drummer (although I never took lessons), and I play piano time after time (ditties like \"Fluff\", \"November Rain\"). Rhythm is burning inside of my soul, and I can spend hours, hammering life out of my poor snare. What about quality of my drumming: well, I think it's alright, at least my friends enjoy it and at least I can reproduce some interesting drumbeats.\n\nAccordingly, I'll try to devote, whenever it's possible, certain time for analysis of drummer's style and mistakes.\n\nIn conclusion - list of my heroes.\n\nBest album: Queen II.\n\nBest guitar players: May, Van Halen, Satriani, Vai, Iommi.\n\nBest bass players: Butler, Jones.\n\nBest Drummers: Bonham, Taylor, Burr, Baker.\n\nBest keyboardist: Richard Wright.\n\n28.08.2002\n\nKevin Coleman\n\nArlington VA and now happy in Cleveland (the HOME of Rock and Roll). Known on your review site as \"WhoJonGalt\".\n\nII. I let out the tension with a little bit of exercise. In a one-year period between March 2000 and February 2001 I either biked or jogged 2,466 miles. That's Cleveland to Mexico City...Love being a dad and husband. Future plan is to be the Poet Laureate of the USA. Joseph Campbell is my mentor. I enjoy German Wheat Beer with a shot of raspberry syrup. I have traveled the world and found the happiness Dorothy Gale found; in the back yard\n\nIII. In reviewing the CD case it is dominated by The Kinks as I have everything I can get my hands on - even UK Jive! I also dig The Who (collectively and individually), 10cc, Steely Dan, Frank Zappa, Procol Harum, Neil Young, The B-52s, Joe Jackson, Fats Domino, Louie Jordan, the Beatles (collectively and individually), Eric (God) Clapton, and such obscure folks as Basia, Fishbone, Ben Dover and the Screamers, and Michael Franks. Those who have peeked say I am stuck in the 50s and 60s but I know what I like. Most despised are Stevie Nicks, country, Stevie Nicks, Janet Jackson (although my wife dragged me to her concert as payback to taking her to The Who) and all that Brittany ATeen N'Sync Radio Disney crapola my kids like, and Stevie Nicks. Who ever told her she could sing, and her dancing...(Gee I sound like my dad...)\n\nI don't consider my self stuck as I also love classical from DeBussy to Prokofiev. My criteria for rating music is simple - does it strike the cord deep in my soul? Reviewing is a free exchange of ideas and opinions and who can argue with that? They are like belly buttons - everyone has an opinion, and one must consider the source. If the review has a crude attitude it will be a crude opinion. During a diet when I lost a bunch of weight my wife bought me \"a stratocaster with a whammy bar\" (like Frank Zappa) and I have taught myself. The stuff I like seems to be a different combination of three cords and it helps work out the tension along with the exercise. Favorite bass player is Paul. If you ask Paul who, why are you reading this? I truly enjoy reading the opinions of others and think this is a great web site. God Save The Kinks!\n\n18.10.2001\n\nBrett Collins\n\nHey...the name's Brett Collins in case you haven't already noticed.\n\nI enjoy listening to music, playing music (on any assorted instrument; guitar being a personal favorite), reading about music, and in this case, writing about music.\n\nFavorite artists are:\n\n1) Led Zeppelin (whom is despised by the looks of your reviews)\n\n2) Pink Floyd\n\n3) The Who\n\n4) Radiohead\n\n5) David Bowie\n\nP.S. I'd like to see some Radiohead reviews in the future, you do a great job with the other artists. Thanks. :)\n\n15.07.2003\n\nRichard Craig\n\nMy name is Richard Craig. I am 17 and am from Belfast in Northern Ireland.My favourite band without question is Genesis but I also like Led Zeppelin, Yes, Pink Floyd and Deep Purple.\n\nThe joint award for my least favourite band goes to just about every single band formed after about 1980, but hey i'm stubborn. I make an exception in the case of mid-90s band Kula Shaker, who were really from the late 60s but had to split up because the general public has no taste in music.\n\nThe sort of music I really hate with a passion is watery British toss like Coldplay and Travis. This music tries to be deep but Steve Hackett's left ear had more talent than any of these bands put together.\n\nTo while away the tedious hours of my life I drive my car,having just passed my driving test,watch Formula One, cycle and of course study, as obtaining a university degree is essential to the earning of money,a transaction that needs to occur in order for me to obtain a Rickenbacker bass guitar, something i genuinely desire.\n\nIn reality I would like to transport myself to the world exemplified by 'Dancing With the Moonlit Knight' but you can't have everything.\n\nI play the bass guitar, quite well. I sound a bit like Michael Rutherford, surprise surprise. My favourite bass player is probably John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin. He is a hugely talented musician.\n\nMy favourite guitarist, in appearance(at least in 1971) as well as style, would have to be Steve Hackett.\n\n31.03.2001\n\nIsaac David\n\n1.Hello George, my name is Isaac David, I'm 17 years old (18 in january) I born and live in Mexico ¡¡¡VIVA MEXICO CABRONES!!!! My house is in Pachuca, my social status is \"middle\".\n\n2. I'm a student of \"preparatoria\" (A grade before getting in the university) I want to study \"Computation\" or something related for it, Now I'm in the Mathematics assignatures. The people think that mathematics are very bore, but I don't think so, I like the mathematics and so, I want to study something related to computers ( I love the computers!!!!!) and mathematics.\n\nMy hobbie is ¡¡¡play piano!!!! ( I study piano since my 5 years old), guitar and drums ( I'd like to study bass), I compose my own songs and i want to get in a rock band, Please wish me luck (deséame suerte) to be a rock star, And I hope that you'll revise my albums in the future please.\n\nOtthers hobbies is: play videogames in the computers and hear a LOT OF MUSIC of course. My fathers don't understand why I hear a lot of music, the reason is that music is MY LIFE.\n\n3. I'm just interested for ROCK, is the only style that I hear, I like the classic rock and some bands of today. I hate a lot of styles that destroy my ears ( ha ha) (And i hope that you hate too) : the teenage pop, rap, electronic (dance, house, techno, ...) latin (cumbia, merengue , cha cha cha, ska...), nu metal, music in spanish ( not at all), opera, etc, etc, etc.\n\nMy favorite groups: They are not a lot, I started to hear rock music since my 5 years old, but I began to buy albums frecuently in 2002. This is my personal ranking: 1. Beatles 2. Pink Floyd 3.Queen 4 The who 5 Led zeppelin 6 Rolling stones 7 Red hot Chili Peppers ( do you know them???) 8 John Lennon 9 Radiohead ( I wish that you revise them, is the best band playing today) 10 George Harrison 11 Paul McCartney ...this last bands are my favorites of all the times, I have anothers but they are the best for me.\n\nI have put in the web a very very very young page of reviews: www.angelfire.com/rock3/thewall\n\nI hope that it'll grow in the future, in the page I explain my rating scale, How I put a note to a album ,etc. My scale is 0-10, it's very easy...The albums that I've put a 10 are: Abbey road, White album, Animals, A night at the opera, wish you were here, magical mystery tour and sgt. peppers ...they are the BEST albums for me.\n\n21.08.2003\n\nChristina DeGailler\n\nChristina DeGailler\n\n18\n\nPortland, Oregon\n\nHere is the list for the best of the best musicians.\n\nLEAD GUITER: GOD (duh!

I now live in Stockholm, Sweden with my partner (she's Swedish). Social status? Pariah, I hope.\n\nII. *Personal non-music related interests*. How do you escape the misery of this life *now* and how are you planning to do so in the future? I drink. I plan to keep on drinking.\n\nIII. *Music-related questions* (the most important part). Your musical tastes: favourite and most despised bands/artists/musical genres. Are you more of a branching-out eclecticist or a more restricted fan? What are, or would be, your criteria for rating music (if you have them at all, that is?) What's your attitude about music reviewing? Would you like to have a site of your own? Are you a musician? What instruments do you play or would like to play? Who's your favourite bass player? What colour are the socks of George W. Bush (oops, sorry, wrong program). You get my drift. Anyway, be the first one on your block to win the Certified Music Review Commentator tag! As for me, plans involve putting up links from your previous (or future) comments to this page so that everybody could easily access this personal info from any of your comments. This will be a hassle, of course, but it might be worth the entire game. So enter the game!\n\nMy musical tastes were formed in the mid-sixties to early seventies and most of the music I listen to is still from that era. Specifically I like the Stones, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Joy Division, the Doors, Nick Drake and Tim Buckley. Generally I like some metal (actually MOST metal), some Goth, blues, traditional English folk music, punk, post-punk, some New Country, Southern rock (especially the Allmans and Lynyrd Skynyrd), a lot of 60s pop, psychedelic, some techno and trance (especially Astral Projection). I'm busy hunting down rare 60s psychedelia. I used to play drums, and I also sang and wrote song lyrics for a briefly lived folk-rock band called The Otter in the early 1970s.\n\n12.05.2006\n\nMike DeFabio\n\nMike DeFabio.\n\n18 last time I counted.\n\nRichmond, California, USA.\n\nHigh school senior with no money and too much free time.\n\nI tend to escape the misery of this life by either listening to music, or making music that I'd like to listen to if I run out of pre-made music to listen to. I'm in a band called the Other Leading Brand that's weird as all get out (what's a get out, anyway?) and when I'm not up to my eyesockets in meaningless homework I'm probably pounding away on a drum machine. I don't watch television much unless someone else is watching it. The last movie I saw was \"Brazil\" and it was fantastic. The last good book I read was... er... Kafka's \"Metamorphosis.\"\n\nFavorite bands? Hoo boy. Radiohead, Pink Floyd, early Genesis, Beatles, the Fall, DJ Shadow, Can, the Police, Frank Zappa, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Steely Dan, etc.\n\nLeast favorite bands? Sheesh. Air Supply, Limp Bizkit, Korn, AC/DC, ABBA, Kansas, Slayer, Ted Nugent, Metallica (not because of Napster, but because they don't write very good songs), Supertramp, Bread, Puff Daddy, etc.\n\nFavorite albums? Oh MAN. OK Computer, The Wall, Foxtrot, Revolver, Perverted By Language, Endtroducing, Tago Mago, Zenyatta Mondatta, Apostrophe, Brain Salad Surgery, Countdown to Ecstasy, etc.\n\nI wholeheartedly embrace any and all genres. There's plenty of good rap, plenty of good country, plenty of good techno, plenty of good metal, and plenty of good new age. Would you like me to name some? Okay! Jurassic 5, Johnny Cash, Meat Beat Manifesto, Tool, Tangerine Dream. There's plenty of good avant-garde, too! Like Karlheinz Stockhausen!\n\nI'd like to have my own site if I didn't have to maintain it myself. Albums would be rated according to a big complicated graph that no one can read.\n\nMike DeFabio's Supergroup:\n\nGuitarist: Jonny Greenwood.\n\nBassist: Les Claypool.\n\nDrummer: The guy from Can.\n\nKeyboardist: Keith Emerson.\n\nSinger: Blixa Bargeld.\n\nMusic written by: Frank Zappa Lyrics written by: Bob Dylan and Roger Waters.\n\nWhat else can I say about me? I have three dogs. I use the computer too much. I'm wearing blue pants. Right now I'm working on a Low Maintenance Perennials remix album. I like ice cream. If you met me you'd hate me. I'm a music geek. You've seen \"High Fidelity,\" right? Jack Black's character? I AM that guy.\n\n28.03.2001\n\nAdrian Denning\n\nHi. My name is Adrian Denning, i'm twenty seven years of age and was born and raised in England. I'm still in England but I hope to see the rest of the world before I die. I grew up in the countryside and my favourite color is green. I also have green eyes and, when it get's out of hand, Bob Dylan hair.\n\nI don't believe i've had a particularly sucessful life uptil this point. I am however a hopeless romantic and just want to 'arrive' at some stage with a nice house and a nice person to share it with. However long it takes me to reach that point and have a nice job I enjoy into the bargain - i'm not too concerned about. I'd like to get there in the end though!\n\nI write poetry as a hobby. I live with six cats and some sort of dog who is almost as soppy as I am. My musical tastes? I adore sixties groups such as The Beach Boys, The Byrds and The Kinks. I also like weirder stuff such as Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart, Stereolab and The Fall. I like to think I have open minded tastes and have a wide variety of music in my collection. I also appreciate artists such as Erykah Badu, Marilyn Manson and one of my favourite songs is Abba's 'Dancing Queen'. So, that about sums it up then!\n\n12.12.2001\n\nRichard C. Dickison\n\nName: Richard C. Dickison (AKA Randomkill)\n\nDate Of Birth: Sept. 11th 1963\n\nLocation: Rio Nido, California USA\n\nJob: Web Admin - Wells Fargo Bank\n\n2. Just bought a house with 36 Redwood trees that needs allot of attention, the house that is.\n\nI hang on allot of sites and mod on a Farscape (TV, Sci-fi oriented) discussion board www.ultimatefarscape.com\n\nI have been overcome by the work George did on this board. It really is huge now and I remember when there were only three comments on the Pink Floyd area. I also am currently creating several sites for different reasons. It helps to see wonderful boards like this, well thought out and enjoyable, informative and just plain fun.\n\n3. Favorite band would be hmmmmm. OK! I give, I like so many here. OK, Mid-Fleetwood Mac, Early-Elton John, add Mid-Jethro Tull, and sprinkle with Late-Beatles, Brian Eno, Clannad, David Bowie, and a dash of various 90's industrial and dance for texture.\n\n07.12.2000\n\nDavid Dickson\n\nMy name is David Dickson. I am currently a junior at Rice University in Houston, Texas, and I am a popular music addict. I was born in Topeka, Kansas, home of the tallest capitol building in the United States. (It's true; taller even than the National Capitol by a foot.)\n\nI escape the misery of this life by constantly getting shot down by girls with more social experience than twenty of me. (Yes, even at Rice, most people seem to have lives. It's the very opposite of fair.) I plan to either start an art-rock band and get booed off the stage in every punk-addicted dive in Texas, or move to Russia and build a highway connecting Anchorage to Moscow via a tunnel under the Bering Strait, in the process making enemies of everyone from Russian nationalists to Irkut separatists to paranoid McCarthyites in the U.S., to the very environmentalists that I contribute to. Either way, I will make people hopping mad.\n\nI am currently embarking on an extensive and very expensive project: finding out what the 125 best albums of all time are. So far I have come to but one conclusion: Revolver is NOT number one. It's good, and it's on the list, but it ain't nearly the best. Many other albums that are widely considered to be the most influential of all time have been entirely eliminated from my list: Beggar's Banquet, The Velvet Underground and Nico, Never Mind the Bollocks, Tommy, and The Chronic being but a few of those unlucky ones. However, since I was 16, my tastes have become eclectic in the extreme: Public Enemy and Shania Twain both get the chance to rub shoulders with the Who and Def Leppard in my chronicles of the best in popular music. I would say honestly that my favorite styles of that multitude largely consist of big, bombastic, calculated schlock: King Crimson, Boston, The Smashing Pumpkins, and early '70's-era Pink Floyd being prime examples of my preferred kind of popular pomposity. My favorite band of all time, though, is the same one that 90% of all other music fans love--you know, that one that did \"Yesterday\". . . Of all the myriad artists of the last four decades, the Beatles seem to be the only ones to have been consistent AND innovative AND catchy AND popular all at the same time, on all their releases. I mostly rate musicians on how good their LP's are; you can write great songs but still have mediocre albums. Also, I tend to focus more on the music of a song than the lyrics; if a piece has good lyrics, fine; if not, that's also fine. Occasionally, the lyrics are so good that they push a song over the borderline between \"great\" and \"extraordinary\"; \"The Last Resort\" on the Eagles' Hotel California being a case in point. (Yeah, I'll admit it. I'm one of those Hotel California fanatics. So shoot me.) I disagree with George about the Rolling Stones; I think their albums are fairly overrated. (Then again, all I've heard of them is Beggars Banquet, Sticky Fingers, Tattoo You, and Forty Licks, so who am I to judge. . .) I wholeheartedly agree with him about Led Zeppelin; only one of their albums qualifies as a masterpiece, (though it isn't George's pick, in my opinion. Sorry, George, we have slightly different tastes. But you knew that already.)\n\nSo far, I've found forty-five albums that sound absolutely amazing enough to make the list. Here they are, in order from least incredible to most incredible. One more thing: influence very often has little, if anything, to do with the quality of any of the albums on this list. Though the two traits often correlate with one another, they do not necessarily go hand in hand.\n\n45.) Loaded (VU, 1970) Derivative, yes, but oh so fun.\n\n44.) Stand! (SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE, 1969)\n\n43.) Tracy Chapman (TRACY CHAPMAN, 1988)\n\n42.) Before and After Science (ENO, 1977) Thanks for introducing me to this masterpiece, George. You da man.\n\n41.) Who's Next (THE WHO, 1971)\n\n40.) War (U2, 1983)\n\n39.) Jagged Little Pill (ALANIS MORRISETTE, 1995)\n\n38.) Another Side of Bob Dylan, 1964\n\n37.) Source Tags and Codes (AND YOU WILL KNOW US BY THE TRAIL OF DEAD, 2002) Yes, that really is their name.\n\n36.) Cosmo's Factory (CCR, 1970)\n\n35.) Sticky Fingers (ROLLING STONES, 1971)\n\n34.) Violator (DEPECHE MODE, 1990)\n\n33.) Superunknown (SOUNDGARDEN, 1994)\n\n32.) 1999 (PRINCE, 1982) Best party album ever. You don't have it, and you have a life; buy it.\n\n31.) Blood, Sweat, & Tears (BS&T, 1969)\n\n30.) Pet Sounds (BEACH BOYS, 1966)\n\n29.) Pronounced Leh-nerd skin-nerd (LYNYRD SKYNYRD, 1973)\n\n28.) In the Court of the Crimson King (KING CRIMSON, 1969)\n\n27.) Pretty Hate Machine (NIN, 1989)\n\n26.) Play (MOBY, 1999)\n\n25.) Little Earthquakes (TORI AMOS, 1991)\n\n24.) Songs from the Big Chair (TEARS FOR FEARS, 1985)\n\n23.) Cracked Rear View (HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH, 1994) Innocent, yes, but loaded with hits.\n\n22.) AEnima (TOOL, 1996) Death-metal meets Yes. What can I say?\n\n21.) Hysteria (DEF LEPPARD, 1987) Even if you hate the entire '80's, George, you have to admit, all twelve songs on here are agonizingly catchy.\n\n20.) Come On Over (SHANIA TWAIN, 1997) Highest-selling album of the 1990's. Seriously.\n\n19.) Ziggy Stardust (DAVID BOWIE, 1972)\n\n18.) Revolver (BEATLES, 1966) Sorry. It's just not this album's lucky day.\n\n17.) OK Computer (RADIOHEAD, 1997)\n\n16.) Siamese Dream (SMASHING PUMPKINS, 1993)\n\n15.) The Wall (PINK FLOYD, 1979)\n\n14.) The White Album (BEATLES, 1968)\n\n13.) untitled (LED ZEPPELIN, 1971)\n\n12.) Bat Out of Hell (MEAT LOAF, 1977)\n\n11.) Metallica (METALLICA, 1991)\n\n10.) Highway 61 Revisited (BOB DYLAN, 1965) Brrr. \"Desolation Row\" gives me the shivers. In a good way.\n\n9.) Odelay (BECK, 1996)\n\n8.) Blood Sugar Sex Magik (RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, 1991) All the albums from here on have not a single bad song on them:\n\n7.) It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (PUBLIC ENEMY, 1988)\n\n6.) Boston (BOSTON, 1976)\n\n5.) Rubber Soul (BEATLES, 1965)\n\n4.) Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (ELTON JOHN, 1973)\n\n3.) Hotel California (THE EAGLES, 1976) Sorry, George. It just IS one of the best albums ever made. Nothing personal.\n\n2.) Abbey Road (BEATLES, 1969)\n\n1.) Dark Side of the Moon (PINK FLOYD, 1973)\n\nQuadrophenia also definitely makes the list, but I can't yet figure out where to put it. Definitely above Who's Next, though. Kiss my ass, Tommy.\n\nLes Claypool is the best bass player of all time; he's the only one, other than John Entwhistle (God rest his soul) who truly forged new frontiers in bass playing. George W. Bush's socks are probably pink with polka dots.\n\n--David Dickson, music freak extraordinaire, currently seeking a life in the real world.\n\n23.10.2002\n\nBen Dominici\n\nPERSONAL DATA:\n\nName: Ben Dominici Age: 23 Home: San Francisco, CA Social Status: ???\n\nPERSONAL NON-MUSIC RELATED INTERESTS:\n\nHmmmm, let's see...music is such a prominent part of my life, in so many ways....... Okay, I like the forest and the beach, writing, reading, animals, movies, art, animation, dancing, laughing, unselfish people, unspoiled children, San Francisco, The Simpsons, Salvador Dali, Calvin & Hobbes, Peter Sellers, Dustin Hoffman, Ren & Stimpy, The Daily Show, Robert Crumb, Woody Allen, BBC's The Office, Arrested Development(The TV Show), Richard Pryor, M.C. Escher, Vincent van Gough, Hunter S. Thompson, Ray Bradbury, The K Chronicles, The Far Side, John Callahan, Seinfeld, Fleischer, Warner Bros. and Disney cartoons...... That's all I can think of off the top of my head.... I want to hurry and proceed to the music part.\n\nMUSIC-RELATED INTERESTS:\n\nIn addition to writing/recording/performing songs, singing, and playing guitar and drums, I enjoy LOTS of different types of music. There are far too many mucicians/composers/bands/groups to mention, so I'll just list my favorites: Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, The Red Krayola/The Red Crayola/Mayo Thompson, The Mothers Of Invention/Frank Zappa, The Soft Machine, The Bonzo Dog Band, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Dolphy, Leadbelly, Syd Barrett, The Residents, Louis Armstrong, Nick Drake, Howlin' Wolf, The Freestyle Fellowship, Sly & The Family Stone, Moondog, John Lennon, Sun Ra, Os Mutantes, The Zombies, Robert Wyatt, Billie Holiday, Gong, Ray Charles, Procol Harum, Nirvana, Mikah 9, Renaldo & The Loaf, Sonny Rollins, Lee Perry, Skip James, Thelonious Monk, Moby Grape, Django Reinhardt, Blossom Toes, The Beach Boys, The Nice, Caravan, The Kinks, Sidney Bechet, Snakefinger, Can, Kevin Ayers, Giles Giles & Fripp, P.E.A.C.E, Slapp Happy, Daniel Johnston, Desmond Dekker, Chick Webb, Harry Nilsson, The Pretty Things, Spike Jones, Busdriver, Of Montreal, Max Roach, The Small Faces, Pere Ubu, The United States of America, Al Green, Tomorrow, The Everly Brothers, Buffalo Springfield, Grapefruit, and Mississippi John Hurt.\n\nPhew. That was tough. Anyway, like I said earlier, there's much more. I had to pick and choose, believe it or not. Maybe I should have seperated the list into genres. Oh well. There's Rock, Psyche, Prog, Blues, Jazz, Reggae, Soul and Hip Hop up there, as well as a few sub-genres that I won't bother mentioning.\n\nOne last thing: As far as my criteria is concerned, composition is generally what I pay the most attention to. I say \"generally\" because I believe artists' success within certain genres (like Jazz, Blues, and Reggae, for example) can have as much (if not more) to do with performance, but as a songwriter, that's usually what catches my interest.\n\nSome of the artists on my list haven't released that much material, and some have released a great deal. Whatever the case, the inclusion of an artist or group doesn't necessarily mean that I enjoy everything they've put out. Some are there because, when I average the quality of their material, it puts them at the top. Some are there because of just a couple of albums, or, in a few cases, just one album, whether they've released one, two, or 15 of them during their careers.\n\nI guess I don't really have much of a method to my criteria, and maybe it just goes to show that logic doesn't really apply when it comes to critiquing music, or any art for that matter. What it really comes down to is, certain music either grabs you or it doesn't. So cut George some slack. I disagree with him a lot of the time, but I appriciate how difficult it must be to listen to and review all the stuff on this site. I know I'd never attempt it. Besides, even if you think George is wrong most of the time, you'll have to admit that his stuff sure makes for an interesting and extensive document of opinions that you may or may not agree with.\n\n26.08.2006\n\nBrian Donovan\n\nI really appreciate this website, since the popular music of the sixties and early seventies is one of my life's passions.\n\nMy real name is Brian Donovan, and I was born precisely one year after the Riot On Cell Block #9. (That made yesterday pretty significant.) Guess I'm a frustrated rock guitarist but I make my money as an attorney.\n\nI come from Grand Rapids, Michigan which is where Al Green grew up...also Del Shannon who came from Coopersville just west of town.\n\nMusically it all flows from The Beatles...like so many others, it was a real milestone in my life when I first saw them on the Ed Sullivan Show. Before that I was listening to my dad's Dixieland and Broadway show albums, also Danny Kaye and some classical stuff. Afterwards I would get the mono Beatles albums right when they'd come out.\n\nI spent a lot of time listening to AM rock radio stations lie WLAV and WGRD, and also WLS out of Chicago. When I got the \"Nuggets\" double LP in the mid-70s I think I knew at least half of those songs from all that radio.\n\nAround 1969 I started branching out and getting other groups' albums, like Moody Blues, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver, Butterfield Blues Band. I got my first job and an awful lot of that money went into buying albums. Stones, Who, S&G, CSN, Zeppelin, Canned Heat. As the 70s went on I picked up on Procol Harum, Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks, Randy Newman, Dire Straits, Talking Heads. As the 80s began a lot of my interest in current rock began fading. I'd keep going back to the 60s and 70s instead. I'd go through various phases of getting into acts of the past, like Beach Boys, Otis Redding. Actually that still goes on. This past year I got a lot of the Kinks, even found a copy of Face To Face at a local used CD shop.\n\nI played guitar in a couple of classic rock hobby bands in the last ten years or so, better late than never I say. I still jam with a couple of friends but we need to find a rhythm section...bass players and drummers are hard to come by.\n\nBeyond saying the Beatles are my favorite band, it's hard to pick out other favorites because there are so many. One last thing...certainly music has changed since the sixties, but I'm struck by how much of that sound has remained. Even now, the difference between now and then is much less than the difference between the sixties rock I grew up with and the big bands and show tunes my folks listened to.\n\n03.07.2004\n\nE\n\nI like to think that my tastes are rather diverse, and in actuality I've enjoyed contributions from all genres (except rap, unless you count Subterranean Homesick Blues or Anyway the Wind Blows or something). I won't list my favorites because they're far too obvious and predictable, but suffice it to say my tastes are very similar to George's. I'm an amateur songwriter with many songs and no feasible way to convey their melodies. I love reading, writing, listening to music, watching movies and swimming. I have a dog. I'm very liberal. How far is this personal synopsis supposed to go anyway? Well, I guess this is adequate, if not I'll correct it on a future occassion. Well, peace, I guess.\n\n14.09.2002\n\nVincent Earley\n\nI. Personal data. Vincent Earley, 40, USA; Born in New Mexico\n\nII. Personal non-music related interests.\n\nMy non-music related interests would be family. My wife and son's interests and our time together. I escape the misery through music and . I want to write and perform music in some capacity in the future....but that's another question, huh....\n\nIII. Music-related questions (the most important part).\n\nMy musical tastes are very broad. I have been around music my entire life. From nickelodeans in the Ozark Mountains to the kid busting rythm on his knees to the Beatles to the latest from Staind. I love music and I especially love hearing the recordings of people that started new things. I hate the packaged bands that the industry shoves at us, but they are so obvious they never go the distance anyway. I am anchored, though, in the classics. Mostly because I believe that much of everything we will ever love about pop music has already been done. There is alot of good music out there today that is simply being regurgitated. Not that I don't like that. I am pining to hear some really good Elvis covers and if anyone thinks the Beatles didn't already produce much of the so called grunge alternative sound, all they need do is listen to \"Yer Blues\" or \"Happiness is a Warm Gun\" and they should be able to see the connection. I don't need to belong to a music genre when I can clearly see the things that all musical genres have in common. From folk to blues to country to R&B to rock.......all popular music owes itself to the collective. Resistence to that fundamental truth is futile.\n\nMy criteria for rating music would be that it should be an original work of the artist or, at least, a passionate display of expressing what he/she loves about the artist being covered. I hate rules in music. I think music theory should be used to open the door to aspiring creators, not tie them down. And if they tune their instruments to something totally strange and manage to produce their own chord structure that is musically appealing........good for them. It was the edgy new blues chords with their dark character that the early rockers were chasing down, not the common stuff found in music class. I despise the fashion/lifestyle package that is the demon we have to live with as long as the music industry is in control, which....joyously may soon come to an ugly end. I have a passion for the process of recording. I get into the details of the session. Where was it done? Under what limitations? I try to pick out the individual sounds and the effects of the room. I think there should be more left in. It is too damn clinical. Jimmy Page didn't bother cleaning up his guitar solo's and I believe the character of his music will endure the test of time because of it. I already like a musician (or band of them) for taking the time to record their music for me even before I hear them, especially if they did it themselves. I think I enjoy the simple more than the complex; however, I believe a complex piece of music that is successfully passed off as something simple is a true accomplishment and sign of genius.\n\nMy attitude about music reviewing is that the endeavor is actually kind of silly....especially in this day and age where we find more and more musicians circumventing the process of professional production and publishing via the internet and poor-boy home studios. The idea that any one person can effectively disect a recording with regards to musical content for the masses is kind of absurd. That said, I do believe; however, that once a person can be trusted with a good grasp of a particular brand or genre he/she can be a good place to start where it's new talent is concerned. I, personally, am more inclined to go to great lengths to hear anything a critic bashes because I feel like the band deserves a chance for the effort. I admit, though, that I often discover the critic to be right more times than not...heh heh. It's like when a friend tells you a band sucked.............aren't you more inclined to dissmiss them? But what if the band played alot of wonderful blues/love ballads and your friend just had a divorce? The point is, a critic should stay close to home to be useful.\n\nI don't think I would call myself a musician; however, I do play guitar. My favorite bass player is Paul McCartney. I like his melodies and the fact that he plays melodies with the bass. He may or may not have benchmarked that technique, but he has certainly used it effectively. I suppose as far as showmanship, he could be compared to Ringo Star. Neither really did more than what was necessary with their instruments and they were right on time. It's easy to have a favorite bass player. I don't play bass and I don't know that many of them. Ask me who my favorite guitar player is, narrow it down to those alive, and I would still be afraid that I was betraying the other dozen or so. I suppoes it would be cool to have a website of my own, in fact I have often thought that I would like to start up a site that featured local ameteur talent that was recorded and mixed right there. But I can barely find time to practice guitar, which is my first love.....so I doubt I will do something like that until I retire, at least. So there you are.\n\n22.07.2002\n\nLindsey Eck\n\nI was born in 1957 and consider myself fortunate to have lived through an incredible era in popular music. I am a musician myself, writing my own songs and more extended compositions, playing several instruments (guitar most prominently) and owning my own recording studio where I am engaged in finally recording my own album of original songs. I grew up in Massachusetts but studied as an undergraduate at William and Mary, in Virginia, as well as spending one year of university in the U.K., where I was exposed to their much different musical scene. For over a decade I have lived in Texas. So I believe I have a good background in Southern and British rock as well as the mainstream 1970s product. I also have a background in classical music, also American and Anglo-Celtic folk, even a little jazz.\n\nMy own arts-related Web site is The Corner Oak.\n\nI am employed as an editor of online documents, which also involves a lot of HTML coding, and I work as a technical assistant for a contemporary (crossover) classical composer in Austin, Texas. I write reviews of theater, television, and musical events. Those interested in a sample of my classical writing may visit this page on Corigliano's third symphony.\n\nOh, my first name is androgynous, but I'm very male.\n\nFavorite albums and artists: Gee, that's tough; I'm more of a musical gourmand than a gourmet. I grew up idolizing the Beatles and, to a lesser degree, the Stones (high peaks but a lot of filler). I was also a Who fanatic and saw a great concert by them in 1975. Between 1974 and 1978 I was also blessed with having seen George Harrison, the Jefferson Starship, Crosby and Nash, the Grateful Dead, Zappa (twice), Little Feat (with Lowell), the Marshall Tucker Band, Billy Cobham and George Duke, Jimmy Buffett, the Beach Boys, and many others. I went through a serious prog phase, especially Yes and ELP (but they both started to shit the bed after a few years, I'm afraid; Love Beach??), also King Crimson, and I was a big Floyd fan when they were classic. In the later '70s I got into fusion, which burned out for lack of new ideas after a few years. Never liked disco a whole lot, though I'll give the Bee Gees their due. In the '80s I liked a lot of early New Wave: Police, Split Enz, Flash and the Pan (now nearly forgotten, but groundbreaking at the time), Cars, Talking Heads, etc. Other '80s faves included early U2 and most of Dire Straits. Also reggae starting in the mid-'70s. I like '90s alt-rock more than most of my contemporaries, having a son who has turned me on to a lot of bands from that era, including Alice in Chains, Third Eye Blind, the Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden, Beck, many others. Recent favorites: Damien Rice's O, Green Day's American idiot.\n\n29.09.2005\n\nSeth Edwards\n\nI'm Seth Edwards, an 18 year old born/living in Seattle, Washington. Currently unemployed, yet still attending school at a local community college. I plan to transfer to the University of Washington when I have enough credits.\n\nOutside of music I enjoy moves quite a bit, some personal favorites being The Godfather 1&2, The Big Lebowski, Pulp Fiction, Batman, and This is Spinal Tap (of course). I used to act in high school productions (which were quite good) but haven't done anything like that in awhile. In fact as of right now most of my hobbies are music related, although I still read and do some writing.\n\nNow for the important stuff, my musical tastes/interests/obsessions/etc. I think the first album I ever heard was Revolver by the Beatles, when my parents used to play it. I remember hearing side 2 quite a bit more frequently than side 1, for reasons unknown to me. In elementary school I wasn't really into Vanilla Ice or anything like that...unlike my peers if I remember correctly. The first band I really liked was Guns N' Roses, to this day I still consider their debut album a classic hard rock release. Soon enough I had gotten into Metallica, and later the grunge bands (how could I not?). For a long time Metallica was my absolute favorite band, I don't listen to them much now. Right around, maybe 1 or 2 years ago, I started getting heavily into classic rock. I started out with Led Zeppelin. I don't care for them much anymore, either, for pretty much all of the reasons George lists on his Zeppelin page. After Zeppelin, it was the Beatles. My favorite band hasn't changed since getting Abbey Road and Sgt. Pepper on the same day. In addition to the Beatles, I am also into other Brit-invasion bands such as The Stones, Who, and Kinks.\n\nI also enjoy Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young, Van Morrison, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Elton John, Velvet Underground, David Bowie, The Stooges, Miles Davis, Cream, The Allman Brothers Band, Badfinger, The Clash, the Police, U2, Black Sabbath, and many others.\n\nI play guitar, and sing (tenor range I guess), so I also like to think I have the ability to write songs. Right now I just jam around with my friends.\n\nFavorite Guitarists: Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page Favorite Bassists: Paul McCartney, John Entwistle Favorite Drummers: Keith Moon, Charlie Watts, Stewart Copeland\n\nSome of my favorite albums: Any Beatles album, Blonde on Blonde (Dylan), Let it Bleed (Stones), Pet Sounds (Beach Boys), The Joshua Tree (U2), Disraeli Gears (Cream), Raw Power (Iggy and the Stooges).\n\n19.01.2001\n\nNick Einhorn\n\nName: Nick Einhorn\n\nBirthdate: Oct. 22, 1984 (making me 16)\n\nResidence: Connecticut\n\nStatus: High school student\n\nInterests: Im a heavy reader. My favorite authors are all of the Beat writers, as well as Kurt Vonnegut, Aldous Huxley, Lewis Carroll, and Arthur Rimbaud. I write a bit, too. Im a musician myself; I play piano/keyboard and I sing (Im a bass). Other interests include playing tennis, sleeping, and avoiding work.\n\nMusic: The first band I got into was (surprise, surprise) the Beatles, when I was in eighth grade. After that, I got into the Who, the Stones, and pretty much the rest of classic rock from there. I like to think of myself as an eclecticist: I like everything from folk (Woody Guthrie, Nick Drake) to punk (Clash, Stooges) to occasional rap (Beastie Boys, Public Enemy). But my main areas are British invasion rock and late sixties art/psychedelic music. You know, just to make it easier, heres my personal favorites (in approximate order).\n\nTop 10 bands/artists: Pink Floyd, The Beatles, The Who, The Kinks, Procol Harum, Jefferson Airplane, The Clash, Traffic, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan\n\nTop 10 albums: Animals (Pink Floyd), The Who Sell Out (The Who), Big Hits (Rolling Stones), Arthur (The Kinks), Shine On Brightly (Procol Harum), Ars Longa Vita Brevis (The Nice), Fifth Dimension "
