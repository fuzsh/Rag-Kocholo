        "text": "The third installment of our emigration story was planned to describe the fate of my great-grandfather, Feliks Michalski, a true Zagorowian whose roots in the city stretch as far back as the beginning of the 18th century. For many years, his life was a mystery, and his fate the object of many a family debate. I began my investigation into the life of this man during a rare visit to Poland. During this visit I had the good fortune to be able to discuss the past with my father and his brother, Feliks’ grandchildren. Unfortunately they knew almost nothing about the life of their grandfather- only that he and his wife had four children and they rented a small house for their family in Zagorow. I soon discovered that the subject of Feliks Michalski was somewhat of a polarizing issue amongst all of his descendants- half of them believed that Feliks had abandoned his wife and children and fled to America, while the other half denied the abandonment story claiming that Feliks was not running away, but that he divorced Maryanna, moved to Slupca and met an unfortunately early death and burial there in the late thirties after being involved in an accident. After reviewing the evidence available at that time, it seemed to me unlikely that Feliks traveled to America and for several years I believed Feliks Michalski to be a closed case. Little did I know the surprise that was waiting for me just around the corner.\n\nAt the end of 2017 I was conducting research for the first installment of our story about immigrants from Zagorow and without even thinking about Feliks Michalski, I found a document which had his name on it! Right there, in black and white, a simple ship’s passenger list obliterated all of my assumptions of the past several years about the fate of my great grandfather. Feliks’ home at 1105 Division Street South Bend, Indiana was listed as the final destination of one of his brothers, Stanislaw Michalski, arriving to New York by the Ellis Island Emigration Center on March 9, 1907. Incidentally, Stanislaw was traveling with his brother Tomasz who reported to be traveling to the home of another South Bend resident, Kazimierz Fiwek, who lived at 446 Carlisle Street.\n\nList of passengers arriving in New York on March 9, 1907.\n\nThis is where the real story begins, and while there are still many details to yet be uncovered including the fate of Feliks Michalski after he came to America I hope to soon be able to report the full story. I have had the good fortune to collaborate with a number of researchers on both continents on this project and I am sure that all the secrets will soon be explained. One surprise leads to another and in the wake of this startling revelation about Feliks Michalski I came across I came across another, very unexpected but fascinating discovery.\n\nAs I mentioned, Tomasz Michalski gave the address of Kazimierz Fiwek in South Bend, Indiana as the final destination of his journey in the passenger’s register. In this same document Tomasz claims that Kazimierz Fiwek is his half-brother. It is hard to say whether or not this is true, but if it is true, I hope that we can soon find proof because it would link the Michalski and Fiwek families of Zagorow.\n\nThe claim that Kazimierz Fiwek may be a half-brother to the three Michalski brothers in America interested me to such an extent that I decided to start digging into his background. With the help of many Americans of Polish descent whom I met on a Polish Genealogy online group, I began to accumulate facts and events that are worth describing here.\n\nThe first Polish settler in the town of South Bend, Indiana was Dr. G. Bolisky, a veteran of wars in Europe, who opened the first Polish doctor’s office in this city in 1840 in one of the local hotels. His medical practice, mentioned in the local newspaper South Bend Free Press, lasted only a few months after which all traces of Dr. Bolisky are lost.\n\nBetween 1860 and 1870, Polish emigration to South Bend began to increase. This influx of new immigrants was associated with a mass migration of European peasants and workers in search of bread which lasted continuously until the outbreak of the First World War. Millions of immigrants came to America from different regions of Europe, a large part from Poland and a small group from the regions of Wielkopolska. They entered through immigration centers in New York, Boston, Baltimore and part of Canadian Halifax. Most were attracted here by the sheer volume of jobs created by the developing manufacturing industry in the United States. Others came to be with family and friends who came before them in search of work. These immigrants settled in many different places around the United States, including South Bend, Indiana.\n\nIn 1870, about one hundred Polish families lived in South Bend which at that time was the largest population of Polish workers in any one city in Indiana. Six years later there were already 150 Polish workers employed in nearby factories, and by 1900 this number had increased ten-fold. Just before the First World War, over three thousand Polish immigrants, 20% of the city’s entire population, lived and worked in South Bend.\n\nThe main employment locations in South Bend included factories such as Oliver Chilled Plow Works, Birdsell Manufacturing, Studebaker Brothers Wagon Company and Grand Trunk Railroads. The Poles lived mainly near the factories where they worked. The epicenter of Polish Culture in South Bend, Indiana were the streets of Division, Chapin, Scott and Sample.\n\nStudebaker car factory in South Bend. A clipping from a local newspaper from 1913.\n\nUsually after a few years of hard work, Polish emigrants would have the means to buy a small house for themselves. In 1872, a small home would cost $500-$600 (about $10,000 in 2017 dollars) and even with their meager $1.50 per day salary, these frugal immigrants managed to save a little every day. Between these savings and a loan from the bank they could buy their own home, a major accomplishment in the eyes of a people who came from a world where such a feat would be unthinkable. Most of the Polish employees at the Oliver Chilled Plow Works factory, for example, already owned their own homes by 1900. Several Polish-American financial institutions sprung up in the United States to help this process along including the Kosciuszko Building and Loan Fund and Jan III Sobieski Building and Loan Association.\n\nIn spite of the heavy focus on the basic necessities of food and shelter, the faithful Poles stayed true to their religious roots and from the beginning of the Polish settlement in South Bend, Polish Catholic parishes were created, built by the financial sacrifices of the parishioners. Newly founded in 1874, St. Stanislaw Kostka Society and St. Casimir Society collected enough money from the contributions of its members that in 1875 they were able to buy an empty lot on Chapin Street, which was intended for the construction of a Polish church and school. The construction was completed in 1877 and on July 1st of that year the church of St. Joseph welcomed the parishioners for the first holy mass. Shortly thereafter, three other Polish churches were built: St. Casimir in 1899, St. Stanislaw in 1900 and St. Albert in 1911.\n\nChurch of St. Casimir in South Bend\n\nThree more Polish schools, sponsored by the Parishes, were built by 1914. Other Polish organizations and associations were also established, where these people gathered after work and on Sundays. These were cultural and patriotic organizations, including The Polish National Alliance, The Polish Falcons, or The Polish Women Alliance. Even a few Polish choirs were established including St. Cecilia in 1879 and the Mierzwinski Choir in 1888. The All-Polish Hedwig Band regularly toured in the city park and by the end of 1914, three other bands and several orchestras also performed.\n\nPolish National Band. Photograph from 1939.\n\nPolish libraries were also established, the first one funded by the priest Czyzewski in 1881. By 1914, a total of four libraries existed which together held about 3,000 books of Polish literature, history and science. Incidentally, it is worth mentioning that public libraries have occupied an important place in every corner of Polish culture, including Zagorow.\n\nIn 1896, the first and only Polish newspaper Goniec Polski started to be published, which had a very important position in propagating and supporting Polish cultural and patriotic traditions and was an important link connecting Polonia in South Bend with other centers inhabited by Poles in the United States and Europe.\n\nIn the city census published in 1921, Polish surnames were very popular. This testified to the large number of polonii gathered in this small city.\n\nThe beginning of the 20th century also brought considerable a considerable boom for Polish-owned businesses. In 1901, there were eleven grocery stores, fifteen butchers, two bakeries, eight hairdressers, a clothing shop, two pharmacies and five tailors. Over the next decade, Polish business grew to 31 grocery stores, 9 bakeries, 8 shoe stores and many other Polish companies. And here again, we return to Kazimierz Fiwek.\n\nKazimierz Fiwek was born January 27, 1880 in Zagorów, son of Tomasz and Michalina née Jasinski. He came to America through the Ellis Island immigration center in June 1902 on the ship s / s Virginia from the German port of Bremen. He settled in South Bend and worked at the Singer Manufacturing Company for the first eight years. He already had a basic education from Poland but that was not enough for the ambitious young Zagorowian. He worked hard during the day and in the evenings he went to school and did everything he could to get a degree in which he could run his own business- and that’s exactly what he did. In 1910 he opened his bar, which he ran until 1917, after which he transformed it into a restaurant that existed until 1948.\n\nThe building at 450 Carlise St., in which the restaurant of Kazimierz Fiwka was located in 1917-1948. Here, also, Kazimierz Fiwek lived for a long time. Present time photography.\n\nBeing already familiar with the language and details of business ownership, he and his brother Stanisław joined together to open a large furniture store right next to his restaurant. They built a magnificent new building to house the store, which at the time was the largest store of its kind in South Bend. The store advertised itself as “a great warehouse of furniture, carpets and metal stuff”\n\nSite of furniture store Fiwek Furniture at 501 Carlisle St. Contemporary photography.\n\nIn addition to running his two businesses, Kazimierz was also active in various Polish diaspora organizations over the years. He organized the West Side Democratic and Civic Club, was a member of the Polish – American Central Civic Committee, member of the Star of Victory Society, Polish National Alliance, St. Johns Evangelical Society, Polish Roman Catholic Union and several other Polish organizations. He also sat on the city council in this district of the city for some years. While he owned his restaurant, Kazimierz lived in the apartment above it. Kazimierz’s mother, Michalina Fiwek, nee Jasinska, lived with him there also, until her death in 1938. Kazimierz went to Poland in 1921 after nearly nineteen years in America to bring his mother Michalina to America. His father, Tomasz Fiwek, had already passed two years earler in 1919 by the time Kazimierz returned. Kazimierz also brought two brothers, Stanisław, who was a partner in the furniture store and Ignacy, who worked until he retired at the same Singer Manufacturing factory, where Kazimierz had worked when first arriving. The two sisters of Kazimierz also found their place in America. Kazimierz, as the oldest, emigrated as the first and slowly made arrangements to bring the rest of his family with him.\n\nKazimierz died in 1962, at the age of 82. Both his brothers and both sisters died earlier. It must have been sad for Kazimierz that, as the oldest of his siblings who had welcomed them in America, he had to say good-by to all of them before he died. Kazimierz left behind a son and two daughters.\n\nThe tomb of Kazimierz Fiwek at the cemetery in South Bend.\n\nHis mother Michalina is also buried here\n\n701 Falcon St, South Bend. The house of Kazimierz Fiwek, in which he died.\n\nThis story was supposed to be about Feliks Michalski but instead, almost with a will of its own, took a different track. It seemed to me, however, that the fate and remarkable success of Kazimierz Fiwek in America was worth remembering and sharing to the modern inhabitants of Zagorow.\n\nI am sure that the descendants of Kazimierz in Zagorow and the United States can be proud of his achievements. We would be very happy to enrich this story with additional photographs or documents from the Fiwek family’s private collections. Additionally, with more details we could write a second part to this story.\n\nWe will also shortly return to properly tell the full story of Feliks Michalski just as soon as we uncover additional facts about his life. We are working furiously on discovering these facts that have lain hidden for so many years and I am confident that we will soon know more."
