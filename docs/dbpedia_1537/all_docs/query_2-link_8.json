        "text": "Wovoka started as a risky adventure of established musicians led by profilic guitarist, Raphael Rogiński, and an unexperienced rough-diamond singer, Mewa Chabiera.\n\nInspired by American psychedelic rock of 1960s and 1970s, Moondog and Black spirituals (which provide all lyrics used by Wovoka), they soon became one of the most impressive live bands in Poland.\n\n“Sevastopolis” is their second album, ecstatic and soulful trip driven by bravado guitar, passionate keys, freewheeling drums and a powerful voice of Mewa. (Piotr Lewandowski)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “God Will Never Change” + album stream\n\nWovoka on Bandcamp, Facebook.\n\nOn his second solo album Wojciech Bąkowski expresses his fascination with mass consumption. The LP’s title relates to “telegazeta”, the Polish word for teletext.\n\nWandering around shopping malls, the Poznań-based artist looks for tenderness in his surroudings. But what he finds is only repeatability and stagnation. Musically, Bąkowski uses royalty-free music loops and laconic spoken word. (Andżelika Kaczorowska)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Escalators” + album stream\n\nWojciech Bąkowski on Facebook,\n\nKapela Maliszów is a family band started by Jan Malisz and his children – Kacper and Zuzanna. For the most of time they are inspired by traditional music from Beskid Niski and Pogórze, mountains of southern Poland, famous for their wildlife and vast spaces, beloved by hikers.\n\nThose folk songs are played with a violin, a basolia (an instrument similar to cello) and a drum. The strength of their music is the authentic sound, freedom and improvisation, reflecting the climate of the mountains from which they derive inspirations. (Kaśka Paluch)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Zielona Lipka”\n\nKapela Maliszów on Soundcloud, Facebook, www.\n\nAs you will see later on, it was Kuba Ziołek’s year in Poland. Truly a mastermind of Polish alternative music, Ziołek released four albums in 2015. “RHTHM” is a sophomore from T’ien Lai (their debut being stellar “Da’at” from 2013).\n\nThis time Ziołek and his frequent collaborator, Łukasz Jędrzejczak, delve deep into rhythmic explorations. On “RHTHM” krautrock meets techno, experimental music, world music, free jazz and even minimal music in great, Terry Riley-inspired “W D”. Still it’s quite catchy and thus serves as a perfect introduction to Ziołek’s vast catalog. (Michał Wieczorek)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “RHTHM” + album stream\n\nT’ien Lai on Bandcamp, Facebook.\n\nHeroiny shouldn’t be considered merely as Piotr Kurek’s side-project. This mixture of outsider house, similar to L.I.E.S.’ and LA Club Resource’s releases, with dissonant guitar samples and reminding of Jandek and No-Neck Blues Band, brings a completely new quality to dance music.\n\nThe iconic Roland TR-707 drum machine provides a danceable rhythm, but Kurek renders its mood overwhelming and nervous by adding instrumental lo-fi sounds. (Andżelika Kaczorowska)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Ahh-Ohh” + album stream\n\nHeroiny on Soundcloud, Bandcamp, Facebook,\n\nKortez does not set any new trends in music, and his ballads do not sound revolutionary. Yet he is one of the biggest musical surprises of the last year. Very simple, but beautifully written songs from his debut album “Boomerang” were enough to fill concert halls and give Kortez the first place on the Polish Radio Three hit list.\n\nThe album’s title has proved to be prophetic. Very melodic and very personal songs return to the listener like a boomerang and won’t easily let him go. No matter if you are a fan of rock, jazz or pop. Kortez found a way how to get to everyone. (Tomek Doksa)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Bumerang” + album stream\n\nKortez on Soundcloud, YouTube, Facebook.\n\nJews once constituted an important and influential minority in Poland. With the Holocaust, all this millennium-old culture perished. However, Jewish heritage and motifs have been resurfacing in the last years, especially in music.\n\nOla Bilińska on “Berjozkele” – released at the very end of 2014 – resurrects yiddish lullabies, giving them a completely new life. Accompanied by Mikołaj Trzaska, Raphael Rogiński, Kacper Szroeder and Michał Moniuszko (all of them being leading musicians in the so-called New Jewish Music movement), Bilińska transforms old songs into alternative music gems.\n\nIs it folk? Is it klezmer music? Is it jazz? It doesn’t matter here, because the beauty of this music is transcendent. (Michał Wieczorek)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Berjozkele” + album stream\n\nOla Bilińska on Bandcamp, Facebook, www.\n\nIt seems Pablopavo will be a permanent visitor in our end-of-year lists, with his two albums in our Best of 2014 and his new release “Wir” (“Whirl”) in this year’s poll. But as one of Poland’s most talented singer-songwriters of this century, he fully deserves that.\n\nFor his latest album, he teamed up with singer Ania Iwanek (from Rubber Dots) and producer Praczas to record his most etheral work to date. They paired up electronic arrangments and leisurely beats with piano, clarinet, and themes that could have some oriental, klezmer, or maybe Scandinavian roots as the nostalgic video for the lead single would suggest.\n\nStrangely enough, the very local music of Pablopavo seems to work very well for international listeners, at least according to beehype’s listening committee. Let’s hope he’s already working on his next release, we’ll keep a spot open in our Best of 2016. (Mariusz Herma)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Październikowy facet”\n\nPablopavo / Iwanek / Praczas on Facebook.\n\nAfter over a decade of silence, the most enigmatic Polish band of the 1990s recorded a sophomore to its cult debut. Księżyc’s (Moon’s) music remains difficult to pigeonhole deriving from traditions of 20th century minimal music, Eastern European ethnic melodies or apocalyptic-folk in style of Current 93.\n\nThis time though the band’s music is less structuralized, developing freely in various directions. As a result, it is less about songs now, but more about instrumentally-driven trance that becomes a trademark of “Rabbit Eclipse”’s ritual. (Jan Błaszczak)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Mglista”\n\nKsiężyc on Facebook.\n\n“1976: Space Odyssey” is a live collaboration between the legendary Polish singer-songwriter, Zbigniew Wodecki, and one of the most prominent alternative bands, Mitch&Mitch.\n\nThis album is a rework of Wodecki’s first LP from 1976 called „Zbigniew Wodecki”. One of the greatest, but also most underrated Polish albums so far.\n\nIt’s not only a great teamwork, but with references to Burt Bacharach’s oldschool pop, Brasilian MPB and Motown vibes, Wodecki and Mitch&Mitch created a perfect harmony, which proves that elegant, smooth and sophisticated style of composing is still alive. (Jacek Marczuk)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Rzuć to wszystko co złe”\n\nMitch&Mitch on Facebook, Bandcamp.\n\nMemento mori. Imagine you’ve always enjoyed black metal but you just don’t buy solemn, dead serious attitude of its numerous representatives. Imagine you’ve always loved simplicity and directness of punk but politics and stuff – it just bores you to death.\n\nNagrobki (Tombstones) have something for you: sinister and hilarious post-punk one-way excursion to nearest cemetery. It’s a pity you won’t get the brutal, nihilistic irony of their lyrics but you can always learn Polish. It’s a good thing to do before you die. Rest in peace. (Jarek Szubrycht)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Jesteśmy martwi” + album stream\n\nNagrobki on Bandcamp, YouTube, Facebook.\n\nGuitarist, producer and founder of the label Wet Music, Artur Maćkowiak for several decades now has been one of the primary figures of the Polish independent music scene.\n\nHe co-created an underground collective Milieu L’Acephale, which brought together music visionaries from Bydgoszcz and Toruń, two cities known for their creative music communities and such important projects as Innercity Ensemble, T’ien Lai and Stara Rzeka (you’ll find all of them on this list).\n\nMaćkowiak’s recent solo effort, “If It’s Not Real”, combines electronic throbbing and guitar preparations. He uses psychedelic loops, hypnotic rhythms, abstract melodies and dense textures doused with synthesized sounds to create highly energetic cocktail of krautrock, minimal music, ambient, free jazz, and post rock. (Bartosz Nowicki)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Some Sort of Trouble” + album stream\n\nArtur Maćkowiak on Bandcamp.\n\nBehind the name Ptaki (Birds) hides a duo of experienced producers and DJs, Funkoff and The Phantom. In 2013 they became well-known all around the world by their edit “Krystyna” relased under the flag of The Very Polish Cut-Outs label.\n\nTheir new record, “Przelot” (roughly meaning “Flight”), was produced from about 300 samples taken from heavily dusted Polish popular music of the 1970s and 1980s. Going through various styles (dub, trip-hop, downtempo, house), the album creates slightly dreamy and very nostalgic aura in its own original way. (Bartek Woynicz)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Już tyle” + album sampler\n\nPtaki on Soundcloud, Facebook.\n\n“On their third album, the Polish black metal duo Mgła offers six perfectly paced tracks that respect the black metal template but push things subtly, capably forward.”\n\n“There’s nothing especially fancy here; Mgła make perfect use of the ingredients of basic, raw, melodic black metal.” (Pitchfork)\n\n“That was… fast. ‘Exercises in futility’ LP is now sold out from us.” (Mgła)\n\n♪♫ Listen: full album\n\nMgła on Bandcamp, Facebook.\n\nAfter a bunch of well-received singles, Kraków-based indie popsters released their self-titled debut album. And it was really worth the wait. The sextet led by Gosia Zielińska and Karol Jadach proved to be one of the most skillful and imaginative bands in Poland.\n\nRycerzyki, whose name can be translated as Lil’ Knights, create a unique yet familiar dreamy atmosphere. Subtly surrealistic lyrics both in English and Polish correspond with colourful and sophisticated music. Their songs sound as if summer and adolescence have never ended. (Michał Wieczorek)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Hounds” + album stream\n\nRycerzyki on Bandcamp, YouTube, Facebook.\n\nThe band already recognized and appreciated by the leader of Swans, Michael Gira, and the jazz trumpeter Nils Peter Molvaer, built their 3rd album on the basis of musical sketches composed for the silent film “The Call of Cthulhu”.\n\nPaul Bartnik (electronic instruments), Olgierd Dokalski (trumpet) and Philip Kalinowski (turntables) shuffle sounds with a skill worthy of the best players of poker and improvise like there were absolutely no boundaries in music. Don’t be surprised to hear funky rhythms next to unidentified noises or a dub echo being transformed into nervously vibrating jazz solo – in this musical world you’ll never know what’s going to happen around the corner.\n\nBe sure, though, to encounter a lot of sonic puzzles as well as plenty of melodies and scraps of compositions that could be further developed… if the band didn’t decide to leave them unused, hidden somewhere between the main motives. To find them all is one of many reasons why you should listen to this album more then once. (Łukasz Wawro)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “[1]”\n\nkIRk on Soundcloud, Bandcamp, Facebook, www.\n\nEstablished just about a year ago, the Warsaw-based duo Rysy have been racking up impressive numbers of views on YouTube throughout the year to be hailed by many as 2015’s most important newcomer in the Polish scene. Just as you would expect from a project that borrowed its name from our country’s highest peak.\n\nIn its core, the group consists of two producers Wojtek Urbański and Łukasz Stachurko, with the latter one already introduced on beehype with his other band Sonar Soul.\n\nIn line with current trends, the duo consciously steer between laptop electronica and club music, taking the best from their western inspirations and Poland’s best young voices, like in the single “Przyjmij Brak“. (Mariusz Herma)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “The Fib”\n\nRYSY on Soundcloud, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.\n\nIt’s no wonder that after releasing such strong albums as “Chaos to Chaos” or Stara Rzeka’s “Zamknęły się oczy ziemi” (scroll down this list), Kuba Ziołek is considered the biggest name in Polish underground scene.\n\nFor me “Chaos to Chaos” is a suggestive, compelling and even a bit overwhelming sonic vision. Listening to this record is a bit like watching slo-mo footage of an ecological disaster: a dark and a bit frightening spectacle.\n\nConsidering Kuba Ziołek and Rafał Iwański’s wide interests (from Heidegger to 21st Century capitalism and influence of technology on modern spirituality) you could look for a philosophical/political statement in it. Take the titles: “Kolaps”, “Cyborg Interchaos”, “Trans-Mania”, “Zona Incognita” – and without hearing a note you get the sense that, definitely, it’s not a hippie folk record.\n\nBut putting all that dystopian porn aside, you might think as well: “It’s nothing more than what you can hear”, a mix of new age electronics, krautrock, oriental music and musique concrete. And it still will be great. (Piotr Kowalczyk)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Trans-Mania” + album stream\n\nKapital on Bandcamp, Facebook.\n\nUnder the monicker Wilhelm Bras, Paweł Kulczyński has been exploring the possibilities of modular synthesizers, including those built by himself.\n\nHis music is characterized by a distinct pulse and constantly evolving electronic passages in variety of colours. He combines melodies with techno sound and avant-garde explorations, stepping far into the realm of sound textures ansd polyrhythms.\n\nOn “Visionaries and Vagabonds” you’ll find microsounds, dynamic changes, and overwhelming, spatial sound. Bras creates music with clumps of ideas – like the title vagabond, he wanders between electronic sonorism and rhythm.\n\nOn the other hand, he does it with a vision and comprehension, showing how cleverly and intelligently electronic music can sound in the second decade of the 21st century. (Jakub Knera)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Drug Coefficient” + album stream\n\nWilhelm Bras on Soundcloud, Bandcamp, YouTube, Facebook, www.\n\nInvoking themes from folk tales, old legends and other narratives from bygone times, the sophomore album from Chłopcy kontra Basia (Boys versus Basia) is an exercise in musical storytelling.\n\nThe core trio of double bassist Marcin Nenko, percussionist and multi-instrumentalist Tomasz Waldowski – the boys – and vocalist and lyricist Basia Derlak, is weaving a contemporary yet timeless sound.\n\nRooted in jazz, folk and pop, their music on O” shows great progress. With nifty arrangements and engaging melodies, it takes the listener on a charming journey through time and space. (Artur Szarecki)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “O wielkiej”\n\nChłopcy kontra Basia on Facebook, YouTube.\n\nThree revered musicians, albeit in different genres, have come together to form this unusual project. The vocalist, Tomasz Budzyński is the leader of Armia, one of the most prominent alternative rock bands in Poland for over thirty years.\n\nThe saxophonist, Mikołaj Trzaska, was one of the pivotal figures in the yass movement in the 1990s, and since then have been thriving on the free-improv scene. And Michał Jacaszek is one of the most successful electroacoustic artists in Poland, known for his unique style, combining deep ambient with sacral chamber music.\n\nRimbaud, however, is pure intensity. A crushing wall of sound, full of noise, glitch and saxophone shrieks, juxtaposed with selected poetic phrases intoned by Budzyński’s husky voice. An intriguing combination of brute force and refinement that somehow works perfectly. (Artur Szarecki)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Armata”\n\nTomasz Budzyński on Facebook. Jacaszek on Soundcloud, Facebook, www. Mikołaj Trzaska on Facebook.\n\nIf one wants to discover traditional sounds of Poland, Warsaw Village Band would be a tricky choice. Obviously, they thrive on Polish folklore and keep reminding us of melodies forgotten long time before we were born, yet still written into our DNA.\n\nBut the thing is they do it in a very unorthodox way – mixing different times and traditions, melting warm sounds of old instruments with modern technology. They cross borders – and this is not just a handy metaphor. Hence guests from around the world on “Święto słońca”, their newest album, including Galician singer Mercedes Peón and Iranian kemanche virtuoso Kayhan Kalhor.\n\nAs if with this album Warsaw Village Band wanted to say that we’re all one human tribe sharing the same musical tradition. Differences are easy to spot, but they focus on similarities instead. (Jarek Szubrycht)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Jan Sobótkowy”\n\nKapela ze Wsi Warszawa on Soundcloud, Twitter, Facebook, www.\n\nSome people have stopped believing in them. Some said they can’t bring anything new to Polish music. But on their sixth album, Kobiety surprised everyone, even their most devoted fans.\n\nOn the record called “Podarte sukienki”, Grzegorz Nawrocki and his team sound like they rediscovered the joy of playing music. They give us a lot of fantastic old-fashioned rock & pop melodies and memorable lyrics.\n\nWhen I first heard one of their new songs, “Bohater Gorących Romansów”, played over and over again by a popular TV station in Poland, I thought: Yeah, now it’s their time. Perhaps thanks to this album Polish listeners will finally fall in love with this band. And I still have that hope, because they deserve it. (Tomek Doksa)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Wielki Wybuch”\n\nKobiety on Facebook, www.\n\nA cooperation of avant-hip-hop NP’s leader Robert Piernikowski and a skillful electronic producer Etamski has resulted in a raw hip-hop record that might be consider a homage to brutal, yet romantic beginnings of Polish rap culture.\n\nStories brought by Syny are being told in a style that make a use of its crooked poetics. Far from being pretentious, Piernikowski summons the provincial reality that revolved around soiled benches, noisy neighbors, teenage awe and bravado.\n\nBased on dense, dubish beats, Syny’s tracks are both reviving the nostalgia of pre-internet roaming around, as well as jumpstarting yourself to move. Brutal yet poetic, everyday yet extraordinary. (Jan Błaszczak)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Stoję” + album stream\n\nSyny on Bandcamp, Facebook.\n\nThe greatest sin of guitar bands is forgeting how powerful the dynamics of sound might be. Last years gave us a huge amount of guitar albums that simply lacked that knowledge.\n\nOn their third album, Trupa Trupa deliver a story. “Headache” is a beautifully crafted piece on tiredness. The idea of concept album may seem a bit outdated and monumental, but “Headache” gives it a new approach. It’s not only about putting tracks in the right order, beginning with a slacker-athem, progressing into a repetitive down-tempo inner part and ending with a Swans-like climax.\n\nIt’s also a great example of conscious production. The story of tiredness is told with dense sound that skips into dreamy, seventies ballads without the obvious retro touch. One of the most coherent pieces of guitar music in years. (Małgorzata Halber)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Snow” + album stream\n\nTrupa Trupa on Bandcamp, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, www.\n\nCharacterized as a “key figure in Polish electronic music scene”, Jacek Sienkiewicz is a holder of Recognition label, one of the most famous electronic music labels to the east from Berlin, where he released his latest album, “Driftings”.\n\nIn a few interviews, Jacek said that it could be the last strictly techno album from him, due to his growing interest in the sonic experiments with ambient and drone music at the forefront.\n\nAs a producer and DJ Sienkiewicz is active since the 1990s. His works are characterized by deep inspirations of Berlin techno sound, as well as Detroit and Chicago dance scene. Raw and spacious at the same time.\n\nSo are compositions from his latest album, which allow not only to get to know the work of Sienkiewicz anew (he came back with this album after a long break from releasing techno music), but also – once again – let us discover the quality of techno. (Kaśka Paluch)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Drifting”\n\nJacek Sienkiewicz on Soundcloud, Bandcamp, Twitter, Facebook, www.\n\nLike a travelling musician, the guitarist Raphael Rogiński explores music of various cultures. With the groups Shofar and Cukunft he immersed himself in the realm of the sacred and the profane of the Jewish culture. With Wovoka he goes back to the roots of American blues.\n\nHe was born in Poland, grew up in Germany, but it’s African music the he finds closest to him, as he admits. On his solo album “Bach”, he faced the German composer, stripping his music of all its seriousness and looking at it through the prism of rock’n’roll.\n\n“Plays John Coltrane and Langston Hughes. African mystic music” is an attempt to show Coltrane’s work in a reduced form, only with an electric guitar. Sometimes modified, adding African flavor to the instrument’s sound, sometimes like a street banjo.\n\nAiming at simplicity and subtlety, Rogiński’s performances seems mantric, especially in a few tracks that include lyrics by Langston Hughes sung by Natalia Przybysz. (Jakub Knera)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Walkers With The Down”\n\nRaphael Rogiński on Facebook.\n\nAlameda 3 turned into Alameda 5 as:\n\n– two guitarists, Mikołaj Zieliński (also known from: Alameda 3, T’ien Lai, Rara) and Kuba Ziołek (Alameda 3, Stara Rzeka, Innercity Ensemble, Hokei, Kapital, Ed Wood, T’ien Lai), have been joined by\n\n– two percussionists Jacek Buhl (Jachna/Buhl, Trzy Tony, Glabulator, Variete, Trytony, Henryk Brodaty), and Rafał Iwański (HATI, X:Navi:Et, Innercity Ensemble, Kapital), as well as by\n\n– electronic instruments expert Łukasz Jędrzejczak (So Slow, T’ien Lai, Duży Jack).\n\n– and… five other guests.\n\nThis dream team of Polish improvisation scene recorded an album long and diverse – two CDs filled with tracks exploring everything from psychodelia to krautrock to jazz-rock avantgarde.\n\nBut the real trick is that they managed to shelve their egos and creativy to come up with compositions that are clear, uncluttered with too many ideas, while still intruging and absorbing. (Łukasz Wawro)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Duch Tornada” + album stream\n\nAlameda 5 on Bandcamp, Facebook.\n\nThe sophomore album of Stara Rzeka, a solo project of multi-instrumentalist, Kuba Ziołek, is supposed to be the last release under this moniker. And what a deserving farewell it is.\n\nA double album, with almost one and a half hour of music, “Zamknęły się oczy ziemi” (“The eyes of the Earth have shut”) comprises a majestic fusion of calmness and storm that seamlessly moves between folk, drone, psychedelic, and metal. Ziołek crafts his vision with confidence and skill, creating a unique sonic world where raw force meets mystical beauty.\n\nA one-man institution of sorts, Ziołek has been active in numerous musical endeavors, some of which also appear on our list. Admittedly, Stara Rzeka has been his most critically acclaimed project to date, but whatever name he chooses to perform under, we can expect powerful and engaging music. (Artur Szarecki)\n\n♪♫ Listen: “Zamknęły się oczy ziemi” + album stream\n\nStara Rzeka on Facebook, Bandcamp.\n\n„Requiem Ludowe” has been inspired by Polish funeral tradition, a custom of singing to accompany the souls of the dead in their final journey. Its words come from „The Pelplin Songboook”, a collection of traditional and funeral songs from Baroque, void of music notation. Melodies, on the other hand, are rooted in the heritage of the Mazovia region in central Poland.\n\nFor the 21st century, they’ve been rediscovered by Adam Strug. A singer, composer of film and theatre music, and a promotor of traditional Polish songs handed down orally from generation to generation. He presented those themes to the members of the Kwadrofonik quartet, who combined folk motifs with contemporary chamber music to compose „Requiem Ludowe”.\n\nOld Polish words and old melodies have been arranged together with proper respect for local tradition, only subtly employing practices of the 20th century avant garde. Two pianos and two percussions, obscure sounds and noises, archival tapes of folk music and Adam Strug’s somber singing bring together a mixture of electroacustic, modern classical and traditional dirge.\n\nWith soul-piercing lyrics, universal messages, hypnotic voice and overall dramaturgy „Requiem Ludowe” is an intimate and intense eschatological experience. In a civilization tabooing the existence of death, the genuine beauty of „Requiem” is striking.
