        "text": "How Our University Began\n\nMorrill Act Provides for Donation of Land in 1862\n\nTexas A&M is the state's first public institution of higher education. The university came about due to the Morrill Act, approved by the United States Congress on July 2, 1862.\n\nThe Morrill Act provided for donating public land to the states to fund higher education. It stated that the \"leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanic arts.\"\n\nColleges and universities founded due to the Morrill Act are considered \"land-grant\" institutions.\n\nAgricultural and Mechanical College of Texas Created in 1871\n\nThe State of Texas agreed to create a college under the terms of the Morrill Act in November 1866. The Texas Legislature later established the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas on April 17, 1871. A commission created to locate the institution accepted an offer of 2,416 acres of land from Brazos County residents in 1871.\n\nInstruction Begins in 1876\n\nOn Oct. 4, 1876, the college began instruction with 40 students and six faculty members. Admission was limited to white males, and the Morrill Act required all students to participate in Corps of Cadets military training.\n\nProgram Offerings Expand\n\nBy the early 1900s, the college offered six engineering programs, an agriculture program and an architecture program. In 1915, the School of Veterinary Medicine was established, bringing an influx of students to campus. Throughout the world wars, the college gained prominence due to students’ military service, and it continued to grow as many veterans used the G.I. Bill. With the growth, the college created a graduate program in 1924, and the first doctoral degree was awarded in 1940.\n\nCollege Diversifies\n\nThere were many changes to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas in the 1960s under the presidency of Gen. James Earl Rudder. Under his tenure, the college diversified, opening its doors to African Americans and women. Participation in the Corps of Cadets was also made voluntary in 1965.\n\nCollege Renamed Texas A&M University\n\nIn 1963, the Texas Legislature changed the school’s name from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas to Texas A&M University. The \"A\" and \"M\" became a symbolic link to the school's past but no longer officially stood for \"Agricultural and Mechanical.\"\n\nUniversity Becomes Triple-Grant Institution\n\nTexas A&M began as a land-grant university. We also received designations as a sea-grant institution in 1971 and a space-grant institution in 1989. Our university was one of the first four universities distinguished with the triple land-grant, sea-grant and space-grant designations.\n\nBranch Campuses Open\n\nOver the years, Texas A&M has grown to include two branch campuses. The first, Texas A&M University at Galveston, was created in 1962, allowing students to study marine-related subjects in the coastal city of Galveston, Texas. Then, in 2003, Texas A&M University at Qatar was established, focusing largely on engineering fields. In addition to these two branch campuses, our university system includes various centers and programs around the U.S.\n\nUniversity Opens Presidential Library\n\nIn 1997, Texas A&M opened the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on West Campus, becoming one of only a few universities with a presidential library. President George H.W. Bush played an active role at Texas A&M, including hosting and participating in the library's special events."
