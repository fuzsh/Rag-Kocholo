Families and Part-time members coverage is offered through TRICARE Reserve Select and is a premium-based health plan available worldwide to Selected Reserve members of the Ready Reserve (and their families) who are not eligible for, or enrolled in the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program.\n\nLearn more about TRICARE benefits available to National Guard and Reserve members and their families at http://www.tricare.mil/Plans/Eligibility\n\nServicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI) - SGLI is a low cost group life insurance members of the Air Guard can purchase. SGLI coverage is available in $50,000 increments up to the maximum of $400,000.\n\nEach unit seeks to share information about benefits with soldiers and family members. Methods of doing this include inviting family members to annual briefings and sending printed information home with soldiers. Most units also have a Family Readiness Group that provides support, information and assistance to soldiers and their families.\n\nFamily Services\n\nThe Army National Guard values the support and contributions of our Families across the country. Family Programs not only benefit service members and their Families, but also have a positive impact on a unit's morale and readiness.\n\nMission\n\nAs a strategic partner with the States, we develop and deliver innovative human resource programs and services designed to support the mission of the Soldier and his/her Family.\n\nVision\n\nOur purpose is to improve the quality of life of Soldiers and their Families in the Army National Guard by providing responsive, efficient and high quality support services that promote self-sufficiency, well-being and prosperity of individuals, Families, businesses and communities.\n\nMore information about the Army National Guard Soldier and Family Programs can be found by reading the lastest FOUNDATIONS magazine available in .pdf form via the links to the right.\n\nPrograms\n\nArmy Spouse Employment Partnership (ASEP)\n\nNational Guard members and their Families face their own set of challenges, from organizing life around training weekends, to dealing with deployment issues. The Army Spouse Employment Program (ASEP) is a great opportunity to attain financial security or to achieve employment. Army Spouses are probably the most diverse in the world, with a variety of educational experience making a talented, global, diverse workforce.\n\nFamily Assistance Centers (FAC)\n\nFamily Assistance Centers provide a variety of referral based services to geographically-dispersed families and retirees from all military components. Services include, but are not limited to, ID cards and Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) enrollment, TRICARE and military medical benefits education, emergency financial services, legal information & referral, crisis intervention and referral, and community information and referral.\n\nStrong Bonds\n\nThis program empower soldiers and families with relationship-building skills, and connects them to community health and support resources. The program, led by Army Chaplains, is holistic, and preventative, and committed to the restoration, and preservation of Army families, especially those near crisis.As members of the world’s premier fighting force, Army Soldiers sacrifice for our country every day, and so do their loved ones. Military life places extreme hardship on relationships, especially in wartime, so the Army – backed by Congress - has committed unprecedented resources to help Soldiers build stronger relationships through the Strong Bonds Program. Strong Bonds has specialized programs for single Soldiers, couples and Families. Those Soldiers being deployed or redeployed can also learn special coping tactics. With Strong Bonds, participants not only bond with their loved ones they bond with other Army families, chaplains and the Army community as a whole.\n\nArmy Family Team Building (AFTB)\n\nAFTB is an educational program for the Army Families, Soldiers, Civilians, Retirees and other who wish to learn more about military life. AFTB promotes practical life management skills and independence, improves knowledge of the military and enhances Family Readiness. AFTB classes cover a broad spectrum of topics from basic information about the Army to the development of skills for personal and professional growth.\n\nFamily Action Plan (AFAP)\n\nThe Army Family Action Plan (AFTB) is the Army’s primary tool to communicate to leader’s issues of importance to Soldiers, Retirees, Family members and DoD civilians. It is the people’s perspective of adjustments and improvements that will increase recruitment, retention, and work-life satisfaction. AFTB is a way to address the demands of Army life by identifying quality of life “hot spots” as the Army moves forward.\n\nGenerally, membership in the Guard has a positive influence on civilian jobs. The skills and leadership you acquire are sought after by many employers. Some soldiers find their civilian and military jobs complement each other, while others seek to add diversity to their lives and skills by serving in a capacity quite different than their civilian occupation. Regardless, your membership within the Guard should not have a negative impact on your civilian employment.\n\nIf you are called to active service, your employer is required by law to allow you to return to the same (or equal) job you had when you left. Also, there are federal laws that prevent employers from discriminating against an employee due to his or her membership in the National Guard. The Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve organization http://www.esgr.mil/ can provide additional information.\n\nThe Army National Guard is always looking for good Soldiers. The best way to find out if you are elgibile is to contact your local Army National Guard recruiter.\n\nMost people between the ages of 17 and 35 are eligible to join the National Guard. However, we do have strict guidelines. Read on to see if you meet the minimum requirements, as well as the physical, education and aptitude requirements for Guard service.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\nTo qualify for enlistment into the National Guard, you need to:\n\nBe between the ages of 17 and 35* (must enliston or before your 35th birthday; 17 year olds require consent of a parent or guardian), unless you have prior U.S. military service, a specialized professional skill, such as a chaplain, lawyer or certain medical specialties\n\nBe a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident alien\n\nMeet necessary medical requirements and moral requirements\n\nFor more information on the National Guard's elgibility requirements go to http://www.nationalguard.com/eligibility.\n\nPhysical Fitness Requirements\n\nGuard Soldiers need to be in excellent condition, and fall within certain ranges of height and weight (depending on age and gender), to fulfill the physical demands of military service.\n\nPrior to Basic Combat Training, you'll also be tested to measure your level of physical fitness, using a version of the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT). This test measures the number of push-ups and sit-ups you can complete within a given time, and the amount of time it takes to complete up to a two-mile run. You can find out more by downloading the Army Physical Fitness Test.\n\nThink you're physcially fit enough to join the Guard? Find out with the Fitness Calculator.\n\nEducation and Aptitude Requirements\n\nEducation:\n\nAt minimum, applicants must have a high school diploma, GED, or have completed 15 credit hours of college. Those applicants with a bachelor degree or higher may be elgibile to enlist with advanced rank, or enlist for Officer Cadidate School.\n\nIf you're still in high school, you may be eligible for the Split Training Option, which offers the option of joining while you finish your senior year.\n\nFor more information on education benefits click National Guard's education benefits/.\n\nAptitude:\n\nBefore enlisting in the Guard, you'll be required to take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (or ASVAB). This important aptitude test measures your knowledge in eight areas, including math, science, word knowledge, electronics, mechanics and auto/shop skills. It will help you find the Guard career best suited to your strengths—the one where you'll fit best and be most likely to succeed.\n\nThis information is only a basic outline of the qualifications. Your recruiter is ready to provide you with more detailed information and make specific recommendations regarding your qualification status.\n\nYour total enlistment period will be eight years, but you can serve as little as three or six years, and spend the remainder in IRR (Individual Ready Reserve). IRR Soldiers don't train with a unit, but can still be called up in the event of an emergency. Your local recruiter can explain how this works, discuss your options with you, and help you make the best choice for your needs.\n\nInitially, all personnel are required to attend initial entry training (IET), which can usually be scheduled to meet civilian occupation scheduling requirements. Duration and location of IET varies according to career specialty - a recruiter can provide specific information for each Military Occupational Specialty.\n\nArmy National Guard members are required to attend one drill weekend each month and one two-week annual training period each year (usually during the summer). Weekend drills are usually scheduled over a Saturday and Sunday each month, but can occasionally include reporting for duty on Friday night.\n\nVeterans who have served in any branch of the military have additional options available to them, including a \"Try One\" program which allows a veteran to serve for only one year on a trial basis before committing to a full enlistment. A recruiter can provide further details. To contact a recruiter please visit http://www.nationalguard.com/ or call 1-800-GO-GUARD.\n\nThe Army National Guard is two things. When activated for a federal mission, it is a Reserve Component of the U.S. Army. When not activated, it is a state-based military force under the control of the governors. As a state force, the National Guard can trace its roots back to the militia of the various colonies, and thus is older than the United States. The Army National Guard is composed of full time and part time soldiers, as well as civilians, who together serve both state and federal governments. The difference between the Guard and other branches is that while Guard units are combat-trained and can be deployed overseas, they are just as likely to serve in their home communities during an emergency.\n\nDuring local emergencies, Guard units assist local emergency responders to help residents endangered by storms, floods, fires and other disasters. Guard units deployed overseas may see combat, but are often found building schools and hospitals, training local police, or teaching local farmers more efficient techniques and better uses of their land. In many cases, the skills Guard members acquire in their civilian jobs make them the ideal people to teach these same skills to the citizens of other countries.\n\nIf you are seeking Army National Guard records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) please see information below.\n\nIf you are seeking records within the ARNG, to include the staff of the ARNG Director, you should direct your request to the appropriate ARNG FOIA Officer using the attached directory\n\nIf you are seeking records about yourself under the Privacy Act that are filed within a Privacy Act System of Record, you should direct your request to Chief of the Office where the records are held.\n\nIf you are unsure of where your records may be located you may contact the appropriate ARNG State Privacy Manager using the list above.\n\nRequests for IG Records must be made to the ARNG Inspector General FOIA Office at:\n\nSAIG-ZXR\n\n111 S.
