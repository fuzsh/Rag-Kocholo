        "text": "Prioritize China as the 'Pacing Challenge.'\n\nAn increasingly aggressive China is trying to shape the international rules-based system to suit its authoritarian preferences. This is a generational challenge, and the department will rise to meet it. To do so, we must embrace integrated deterrence, which charges us to coordinate our efforts across all war-fighting domains, theaters and the spectrum of conflict to create new and more complex dilemmas for our adversaries. We must continue to break down stovepipes across the department; improve our cooperation with the interagency and Congress; and work with our allies and partners to improve operational planning, increase joint and allied interoperability and better align our operations, activities and investments. We are strengthening our deterrence posture in the Indo-Pacific by developing new concepts and capabilities, deepening our alliances and partnerships and expanding our activities and operations. As the threat from the PRC [People's Republic of China] evolves, we will provide Taiwan self-defense capabilities consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act. Our team is making major investments in the nuclear triad, space, cyberspace, long-range fires and next-generation capabilities in fighter aircraft and undersea warfare, while also accelerating Joint All Domain Command and Control.\n\nChina China Military Power Report Indo-Pacific\n\nTackle the Acute Russian Threat.\n\nRussia's illegal and unjust invasion of Ukraine is also an attack on the rules-based international order built at such high cost since 1945. The United States has rallied the world to support the brave defenders of Ukraine, and the unprecedented speed and scale of contributions from nations of goodwill has been inspiring. We are determined to support Ukraine' s fight for freedom over the long haul. We will not be drawn into [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war of choice, but we remain resolved to defend every inch of NATO territory. Working closely with our allies, we have already strengthened NATO's Eastern Flank, and we will continue to strengthen our collective defense and deterrence.\n\nRussia Support for Ukraine NATO\n\nAddress Advanced and Persistent Threats.\n\nThe department will also remain vigilant against dangers including North Korea, Iran and global terrorist organizations. We will continue to respond to North Korean provocations, coordinating closely with the Republic of Korea, Japan and other allies and partners. We will counter unmanned aerial systems that threaten our homeland or our forces around the world. We will continue to sharpen our over-the-horizon counterterrorism capabilities and defend against terrorist threats against the United States. In recent months, we have removed top leaders of ISIS and al-Qaeda from the battlefield, upgraded our presence in Somalia and taken historic steps to limit civilian harm.\n\nNorth Korea Iran\n\nInnovate and Modernize.\n\nAmerica's dynamism has always been at the heart of our strategic advantage. To tackle emerging challenges, we are modernizing every aspect of the joint force, from hypersonic weapons to our Joint Warfighting Concept, from data analysis to artificial intelligence. We are also accelerating the development of advanced technologies to deliver new capabilities to the force. Finally, to strengthen America's competitive edge further, we are making historic investments in defense research and engineering, a once-in-a-generation investment in our shipyards and our munitions industrial base, and much more.\n\nEngineering Science & Technology Artificial Intelligence\n\nMeet the Climate Crisis.\n\nOur strategy and planning address the security implications of our changing climate. We are developing new platforms that mitigate logistical risks in contested environments. We are also investing to improve mission resilience and cut the risks from extreme weather.\n\nClimate Change Tackling the Climate Crisis\n\nJoin Forces With Our Allies and Partners.\n\nAmerica's unparalleled network of allies and partners is unmatched - and one of our greatest strategic assets. We will continue to work closely with our friends around the world. Our support to Ukraine has demonstrated what nations of goodwill can achieve when they work together to defend freedom and sovereignty. We will continue to strengthen NATO, and our commitment to Article V remains ironclad. We will strengthen our alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific by improving interoperability, deepening information-sharing and joint planning, and conducting more complex joint and combined exercises. We will also implement the historic Australia-United Kingdom-United States initiative.\n\nPartnerships Support for Ukraine NATO Indo-Pacific AUKUS\n\nStrengthen Partnerships Across America.\n\nOur partners at the state, local and tribal levels play important roles in our national security, including supporting service members and their families at military installations around the country. Service members will also continue to support our fellow Americans in times of crisis, such as pandemics and natural disasters. In addition, Congress remains an important partner in providing the resources and the oversight that we need to protect our republic, and our partners in industry are the engine of innovation that ensure our warfighters remain ready and lethal.\n\nHumanitarian Innovation Helping Hands\n\nBuild Unity Within the Department.\n\nWe will make timely decisions based on rigorous cooperation among civilian and military teams across the department. We will demonstrate that spirit of partnership at the highest levels, and we will expect it from every person in the department.\n\nGrow Our Talent.\n\nTo remain the strongest fighting force in the world, we must recruit and retain the best of America. That means building pathways of opportunity for all qualified American patriots who choose to serve their country. We will deepen the department's partnerships with America's best universities. We will continue to make investments in training and education and create scholarships for science, technology, engineering and math. We will provide exceptional opportunities for service and professional development for our total force.\n\nValue of Service Stars Behind the Stripes Service\n\nBuild Resilience and Readiness.\n\nLast year, through my \"Taking Care of People\" initiative, we made significant investments to improve the quality of life for our service members and their families, including making moves easier, strengthening childcare support and expanding spousal employment opportunities. But we still have much more to do. We will strengthen our mental health care and suicide prevention efforts, maximize the effectiveness of the Military Health System and improve military housing.\n\nPrioritizing People Taking Care of Our People Military Spouse Appreciation Month of the Military Child Military Health Suicide Prevention\n\nEnsure Accountable Leadership.\n\nThis department will not tolerate any behavior that detracts from the health, safety or well-being of a service member. On my first day in office, I created a 90-day independent review commission on sexual assault in the military, and the department and all military services are now implementing the commission's excellent recommendations as approved. The department worked with the president and Congress to enact historic legislation improving the response to sexual assault and related crimes under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and we have begun standing up new Offices of Special Trial Counsel to prosecute these crimes. And we will continue to work relentlessly to prevent sexual assault and related crimes.\n\nSexual Assault Awareness Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military"
