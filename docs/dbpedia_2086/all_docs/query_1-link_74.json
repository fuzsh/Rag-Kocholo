        "text": "Headquarters, United States Indo-Pacific Command\n\nThe United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) encompasses about half the earth's surface, stretching from the waters off the west coast of the U.S. to the western border of India, and from Antarctica to the North Pole. There are few regions as culturally, socially, economically, and geo-politically diverse as the Asia-Pacific. The 38 nations comprising the Asia-Pacific region encompasses 52% of the earthâ€™s surface, home to more than 50% of the world's population, 3,000 different languages, several of the world's largest militaries, and five nations allied with the U.S. through mutual defense treaties. Two of the three largest economies are located in the Asia-Pacific along with 10 of the 14th smallest. The AOR includes the most populous nation in the world, the largest democracy, and the largest Muslim-majority nation. More than one third of Asia-Pacific nations are smaller, island nations that include the smallest republic in the world and the smallest nation in Asia.\n\nUSINDOPACOM is one of six geographic Unified Combatant Commands of the United States Armed Forces. Commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (CDRUSINDOPACOM) is the senior U.S. military authority in the Indo-Pacific Command AOR. CDRUSINDOPACOM reports to the President of the United States through the Secretary of Defense and is supported by four component commands: U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Pacific Air Forces, U.S. Army Pacific and U.S. Marine Forces, Pacific. These commands are headquartered in Hawai'i and have forces stationed and deployed throughout the region.\n\nApproximately 375,000 U.S. military and civilian personnel are assigned to the USINDOPACOM area of responsibility. U.S. Pacific Fleet consists of approximately 200 ships (to include five aircraft carrier strike groups), nearly 1,100 aircraft, and more than 130,000 Sailors and civilians dedicated to protecting our mutual security interests. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific includes two Marine Expeditionary Forces and about 86,000 personnel and 640 aircraft assigned. U.S. Pacific Air Forces comprises of approximately 46,000 airmen and civilians and more than 420 aircraft. U.S. Army Pacific has approximately 106,000 personnel from one corps and two divisions, plus over 300 aircraft and five watercraft assigned throughout the AOR from Japan and Korea to Alaska and Hawaii. Of note, component command personnel numbers include more than 1,200 Special Operations personnel. Department of Defense civilian employees in the Indo-Pacific Command AOR number about 38,000.\n\nUSINDOPACOM protects and defends, in concert with other U.S. Government agencies, the territory of the United States, its people, and its interests. With allies and partners, USINDOPACOM is committed to enhancing stability in the Asia-Pacific region by promoting security cooperation, encouraging peaceful development, responding to contingencies, deterring aggression, and, when necessary, fighting to win. This approach is based on partnership, presence, and military readiness.\n\nUSINDOPACOM recognizes the global significance of the Asia-Pacific region and understands that challenges are best met together. Consequently, USINDOPACOM will remain an engaged and trusted partner committed to preserving the security, stability, and freedom upon which enduring prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region depends.\n\nMISSION: USINDOPACOM persistently integrates and employs credible, all-domain combat power in order to deter aggression, prevent and respond to crisis, and, if necessary, conduct decisive joint and combined operations to prevail in conflict. Integrating our operations in support of and supported by other U.S. Government agencies, the Joint Force will persistently operate in and across all domains to defend the homeland, deter strategic attack, counter aggression, protect U.S. interests throughout the Indo-Pacific, and enhance U.S. alliances and partnerships.\n\nPriority Challenges and Opportunities:\n\n1. Campaigning for Integrated and Impactful Information Operations\n\n2. Fighting and Winning in an Environment of Global Conflict\n\n3. Accelerating Alliances and Partnerships and Leveraging Geography\n\n4. Assuring Effective Command and Control\n\nUSINDOPACOM headquarters is located in the Nimitz-MacArthur Building on Camp H.M. Smith just outside of Honolulu, Hawaii."
