Eldridge, Dr. Ryan Peeks, and Dr. Greg Bereiter1\n\nThis paper and the attached chronology summarize defense reform and changes in the Navy’s roles and authorities from 1798 through early 2012. The chronology places defense and Navy organizational and institutional reform in the context of major historical challenges to the service and the nation. By necessity, it includes an examination of the Chief of Naval Operations’ (CNO) advisory role and the relationship between the Navy and the Department of Defense after 1947.\n\nThe chronology, which is not meant to be definitive, captures nearly 200 defense and Navy reform-related events since 1798. When possible, the authors have provided online references to encourage further investigation into detailed aspects of defense and Navy reform.\n\nThe chronology suggests that after the significant reform effort that culminated with the passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (PL 99-433), hereafter referred to as the Goldwater-Nichols Act, a large number of other legislative remedies were necessary to address the unintended consequences of the original legislation. Often, the problems that exhaustive reform efforts attempted to redress persisted despite the best efforts of Congress, the Navy, and other defense officials.\n\nThe chronology also proposes that most calls for reform have been related to one or more of four themes: the degree of civilian control of the military with the advent of new warfighting capabilities; business management, acquisition, efficiency, effectiveness, and cost savings;\n\n_____________\n\n1 The authors would like to thank Peter Swartz, Curtis Utz, Steven Wills, and Dr. Tom Hone for their help in shaping the essay and chronology.\n\n[1]\n\nimproving unity of effort (i.e., joint operations); or significant shifts in national policy and strategy as a result of changing international circumstances.\n\nDefense reform must also be seen as part of contemporary reform efforts that followed what Paul C. Light has characterized as “broad patterns in the tides of reform.” Light has argued that these tides “reflect deep shifts in the market for administrative reform that are rooted in changing public attitudes, rising congressional involvement in administrative reform, and declining presidential engagement in either generating legislative initiatives or resisting Congress.”2 The first tide was the pursuit of scientific management, which dominated administrative reform from the 1930s to the 1960s, and which, for the Navy, played out even earlier, at the turn of the 20th century. The second was the “war on waste” in the 1970s. The third focused on “openness,” which had a prominent role during the administration of President Richard M. Nixon (January 1969–August 1974), and the fourth was the “liberation of management” movement of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nRecent reform efforts have reflected a combination of many of these “tides,” especially as the pace of reform has increased.3 Both the Navy’s early efforts at reform and later defense reform in general can be seen as part of these broader trends in government reform, especially when the governmental apparatus comes under political pressure to perform multiple tasks in a\n\n____________\n\n2 Paul C.

Light, The Tides of Reform: Making Government Work, 1945–1995 (New Haven, CT and London: Yale University Press, 1997), 1–5. Professor Light has consistently maintained that a key problem with government effectiveness and efficiency is that the bureaucracy has become too large and unwieldy. See, for example, Paul C. Light, “The real crisis in government,” Washington Post, January 12, 2010, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/11/AR2010011103255.html or, more recently, Paul C.

For this reason the chronology includes entries that highlight these themes, from the scientific management principles of Frederick Winslow Taylor to the more modern efforts by David Packard and beyond.\n\nUniformed service professionals have often been the last to embrace some of the more controversial reforms, possibly in part to defend against what they may view as interference by misinformed civilian authority. Uniformed Navy leaders have been especially intransigent in their efforts to sidestep some of the more extensive reform efforts by either resisting change or, more subtly, compelling concessions. This intractability may well be the result of the axiom that the Navy, among all the services, maintains a particularly unique responsibility for the maritime commons. “The Navy . . . was always wary of placing naval forces under the command of Army or Air Force generals,” wrote Peter Swartz of the Center for Naval Analysis. “The Navy believed that the optimum use of these forces was only possible when their commanders were themselves naval officers, trained and experienced in the exercise of sea power. They saw the assignment of naval ships and aircraft to CINCs [commanders-in-chief, now combatant commanders] from other services as a recipe for misuse.”4\n\nDespite such parochialism, Navy leaders have not approached policy and strategy formulation in a vacuum. The Navy operates in a dynamic environment that includes a variety of other organizations, institutions, and individuals that have critical roles to play in policy and defense reform. Although the discourse is typically professional, the CNO has often found himself in disagreements or, at the most extreme, at public loggerheads with a variety of other organizations and institutions that have included the material design bureaus (abolished in 1966),\n\n____________\n\n4 Peter Swartz with Chester L. Eiland Jr., Michael C. Markowitz, and Maureen A. Wigge, “Drawing Lines in the Sea: The U.S. Navy Confronts the Unified Command Plan (INTERNAL DRAFT), 1946–1999,” (Alexandria, VA: Center for Naval Analyses, 1999), 109–110.\n\n[3]\n\nthe fleet, the Marine Corps, combatant commanders, other service chiefs, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) chairman, members of the Joint Staff, the Secretary of the Navy, his own staff, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). Much of the abrasion has been the result of efforts to enhance civilian oversight of the services, often at the expense of the service chiefs. Internal Navy staff organizational changes have often reflected the CNO’s efforts to avoid or manage centralization (at either the Navy Secretariat or Department of Defense levels) and maintain uniformed Navy oversight of and influence over complex and politically charged issues.\n\nSince 1915 many of these disagreements have concerned the CNO’s role and authority in operations, developing and executing budgets, establishing priorities (e.g., current operations vs. future capabilities), recruiting and training personnel (e.g., having the right number of civilians and Sailors with the right skills), and the Navy’s role as a component of national policy and security strategy.\n\nThe supposition both within Congress and in some sections of the public and defense community has been that inadequate civilian supervision and control have been the root cause of the myriad problems encountered with the defense establishment. Congress, of course, is a civilian authority, but since 1947 it has almost systematically abrogated much of its oversight responsibility to the Department of Defense. The debate has now become more about which civilians—those in OSD or the service secretariats—will assert control over the uniformed military, especially in the area of weapons development and acquisition.\n\nThe centralization of civilian authority within both the Navy secretariat and the OSD has been one of the most politically sensitive and divisive issues that the CNO has had to address. Few active duty military officers are willing to publically state that there has been too much\n\n[4]\n\ncivilian control of the military. Yet the individuals involved with the complexities of defense organizational and institutional reform, both political and administrative, have sparred over what constitutes adequate and appropriate authority for effective administration. “Authority commensurate with responsibility is universally recognized as a basic requirement of sound administration,” wrote retired Rear Admiral Julius A. Furer, but agreement among the disparate groups involved has been difficult to achieve.5 As a result, defense reform has been, for the most part, incremental. Some officers have found such centralization efforts anathema to a well-run and effective Navy, especially when they perceive that the uniformed naval professionals are sacrificing responsibility to civilian or joint authority.\n\nThe first major Navy administrative reform meant to create a more effective, modern management system came in August 1842 when Congress created a system of bureaus responsible for the material needs of the Navy. However, it was after the 1898 Spanish-American War that circumstances demanded the Navy address the need for a modern fleet capable of worldwide deployment with an eye toward blockading and conducting fleet actions against a peer competitor. Such modernization required an end to officer promotion by seniority, the amalgamation of line and engineering officers, centralized planning, systematic training, improvements in engineering and gunnery, an investment in research and development, and the ability to mobilize in the event of war.6\n\n______________\n\n5 Julius A. Furer, Administration of the Navy Department in World War II (Washington, DC: Naval History Division, 1959), 7–8.

However, one man with a small cadre of assistants found these responsibilities impossible to effectively or efficiently address. The increased demands required the Secretary to have help, and this came initially from a series of ad hoc boards and committees, a system of aids, the material bureaus, and eventually the General Board of the Navy.\n\nYet, with the exception of the General Board, these efforts proved to have been inadequate to the task. On the eve of World War I, Congress created the position of Chief of Naval Operations. The role of the CNO and his staff (Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, or OPNAV) in setting policy for the Navy and developing effective strategies for national defense has changed as the power and authority of the CNO varied over time.\n\nAt the time of creation of the CNO position and OPNAV, the Secretary of the Navy was the controversial Josephus Daniels (March 1913–March 1921), who believed among other things that ships afloat should serve as schoolhouses. Such social engineering received little public support from the uniformed professionals, even though some likely recognized that a modern Navy with new, expansive missions demanded skilled, efficient, and educated Sailors.\n\nNavy reformers and strategists at the time such as Captain Alfred T. Mahan and Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce, along with several Navy Secretaries and President Theodore Roosevelt (September 1901–March 1909), rejected the Navy’s limited, pre–Spanish-American War strategy of commerce raiding.7 In doing so, they also questioned what had been the\n\n_______________\n\n7 See Harold and Margaret Sprout, The Rise of American Naval Power: 1776–1918 (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1967), 219–221, 227–228; Norman Friedman, U.S. Battleships: An Illustrated Design History (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1985), 5; Allan R. Millett and Peter Maslowski, For the Common Defense: A Military History of the United States of America (New York: The Free Press, 1994), 267; Henry P. Beers, “The Development of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations,” Military Affairs, vol. 10, no. 1 (Spring 1946), 46.\n\n[6]\n\ntraditional view that the Secretary managed strategy and the fleet while the technical details of sailing and ship design were left to the uniformed professionals.\n\nInstead, Mahan, Luce, and contemporary Navy reformers preferred that the service carry the more robust strategic responsibility of “command of the seas,” which required a capital shipbuilding program that included a battleship fleet to search out and defeat the enemy’s fleet in a dramatic and climactic sea engagement. This vigorous approach to naval strategy demanded new ships and new ideas in naval administration that necessitated (or so the reformers argued) the formation of a general staff to minister to the new Navy’s strategic, operational, and material needs.8 This staff, according to the uniformed reformers, would necessarily require an increase in the influence and control of the uniformed Navy vis-à-vis the civilian secretariat regarding all aspects of Navy administration.\n\nIn the winter of 1915, Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske, at the time the aid for operations (a pre-CNO position created by then-Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer in 1909)9 and others approached Representative Richard P. Hobson (D-AL), a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee and a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, to add language the officers had drafted to the annual appropriations bill calling for the establishment of a uniformed service chief. The recommended language stated:\n\nThere shall be a Chief of Naval Operations, who shall be an officer on the active list of the Navy not below the grade of Rear Admiral, appointed for a term of four years by the President, by and with the advice of the Senate, who, under the\n\n___________\n\n8 Sprout, Rise of American Naval Power, 219–221, 227–228; Millett and Maslowski, For the Common Defense, 267; Beers, “The Development of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations,” 46.\n\n9 See M.

Benson as the Navy’s first Chief of Naval Operations.12\n\nIn the interwar period, the Navy’s challenge was how best to use scarce dollars to build a framework for a large Navy that could take the war across the Pacific to Japan, especially given the limitations on naval material development as a result of the Washington and London treaties, both of which dictated specific limitations for warships in terms of total tonnages as well as armament for certain classes of ships. The Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, developed the intellectual foundation for a modern Navy. Throughout this period, the authority of the CNO often fluctuated in part because of the office holder’s personality.\n\n____________\n\n10 Sprout, Rise of American Naval Power, 219–221, 227–228; Millett and Maslowski, For the Common Defense, 267; Henry P.

Pratt (September 1930–June 1933), a man who believed “administration is the thief that steals time,”13 recognized the importance of personality and how it influenced the development of the Navy. With this in mind, he maintained that the Navy’s uniformed leaders consisted of two types of officers: those who fretted and “meddled constantly with detail, delegated as little as possible, found fault incessantly with those below them, and were able always to pin the cause of failure on some errant subordinate” and “those who picked the best leaders they could to serve them and gave these men the freedom to accomplish what they could.”14 He also believed that naval officers “fastened everything upon the opinion of the Chief,” which he found to have been “a sort of pass-the-buck system. Its roots lie in fear: fear that someone over you will find fault. Therefore, many men in top positions have spent so much time over trivial details that they have no spare moments for more important matters.”15 For Pratt, the key to effective leadership and management of the Navy was in finding the right men with the right leadership qualities to serve as the service’s senior uniformed leaders.\n\nThe Navy staff and the responsibilities of the CNO grew with time. The CNO’s authority increased significantly, however, when Admiral Ernest J. King16 strove to gain authority over the\n\n_____________\n\n13 Pratt quoted in Gerald E.

Initially, a number of senior military leaders, including General George C. Marshall Jr., supported the concept of a single, post-war “department of war.” Senator Harry S. Truman (D-MO) also supported service unification along similar lines. When Congress held hearings on the matter, virtually every war department official who testified supported the single department concept, which was a reversal of the positions of their counterparts two decades earlier. Even a Joint Chiefs of Staff special committee directed to study the issue arrived at similar conclusions. Despite the committee’s recommendation, retired Admiral James O. Richardson, the committee’s chairman, opposed the conclusions as premature. Instead, he concluded that the roles and missions of the Army and Navy were so “divergent” that a single department would inhibit the “development of each.”18 Similar arguments had been made by those opposed to like reforms throughout the 1920s and 1930s. In June 1945, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal (May 1944–September 1947) commissioned Ferdinand A. Eberstadt, an influential attorney and policy advisor who had been instrumental in the development of the\n\n_____________\n\n17 See Barlow, From Hot War to Cold, ch. 1, 9–34; Furer, Administration of the Navy Department in World War II, 932; Thomas Hone, Unpublished Manuscript, History of the Navy Staff, ch. 5.\n\n18 Gordon Keiser, The U.S. Marine Corps and Defense Unification, 1944–1947: The Politics of Survival (Washington, DC: National Defense University, 1982), 14–16.\n\n[10]\n\nNational Security Council, to independently examine post-war defense organization. He concluded that contrary to popular opinion, defense unification would “not improve national security.”19\n\nIn the post-war period, defense reorganization was meant to reflect Washington’s new peacetime responsibilities. At the time, two interrelated issues drove Navy organization. The first was the struggle over development of the necessary platforms and delivery of nuclear weapons. The second was the emergence of the Cold War, which challenged the traditional notions of service roles and missions. Several years passed before the nation’s leaders comfortably accepted the idea of large standing military forces, Washington’s leadership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the role that strategic nuclear deterrence would play in the nation’s national security strategy. Inevitably there would be an effort to keep defense spending in line with domestic needs and a struggle over what is now called “joint operations” accompanied by the logical need to maintain forward deployed forces to bolster allies and deter direct Soviet aggression. As a result, there was a flurry of legislation, conferences, public debates, and political struggles within Congress because of the size and complexity of defense budgets. Those early debates and congressionally-driven reforms resulted in the National Security Act of 1947 (PL 80-253) and the Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1958 (PL 85-599) which, respectively created and then gave greater authority and discretion to the Secretary of Defense. The Goldwater-Nichols Act was the culmination of these efforts.\n\nAfter nearly 25 years of congressional debate on the establishment of a defense department, the ten-page National Security Act of 1947 (PL 80-253) established the Joint Staff\n\n___________\n\n19 Ibid., 16–19.\n\n[11]\n\nand the Secretary of Defense.20 One of the act’s defining purposes was to enhance civilian control of the military and not just improve military organization.21 Apparently, the act did not resolve the issue of civilian control. It was followed by a number of post-1947 defense reports, such as the Rockefeller Committee report for President Dwight D. Eisenhower22 and the Symington Report to Senator and President-elect John F. Kennedy23 to defense secretaries, such as Robert S. McNamara.24 These continued to address the issue in a manner that further increased civilian authority over defense planning and programming through administrative rather than legislative means. Civilian control of the military is, of course, in the eyes of the beholder, and the meaning and context has changed with each generation (and sometimes even within the same generation) of uniformed and civilian military leaders.\n\nThe eight-page Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1958 (PL 85-599) amended the National Security Act of 1947 and granted the defense secretary wide latitude in organizing and managing the military establishment.25 The act also intended to provide the services with “unified direction under civilian control of the Secretary of Defense.”26 This act served as the rationale and authoritative guide that Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara\n\n____________\n\n20 National Security Act of 1947, Public Law 80-253, 26 July 1947, The National Archives Catalog, Record Group 11, https://research.archives.gov/id/299856.\n\n21 Ibid.; Barlow, From Hot War to Cold, 57–73, 228, 234–240.

For the most part the focus of reform fluctuated between military “efficiencies” and “effectiveness,”28 terms that had been used by defense reformers who favored service consolidation since the early 1920s. The reason, in part, was due to the large number of organizations that became directly involved in the reform process. As could be expected, McNamara’s consolidation of authority within the Office of the Secretary of Defense was neither unique nor without controversy. Sometimes a shared dedication to a common goal could overcome such tension, but at other times a public political crisis ensued, as it did in 1949 (well before McNamara’s time in the Pentagon) with the “revolt of the admirals,” which arose in part over the Navy’s role in nuclear weapon delivery.29 Like Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson’s decisions that led to the “revolt,” McNamara’s changes to how the Pentagon would conduct the nation’s business also carried the taint of scorn from some of the Navy’s uniformed leaders. In October 1965, for example, both Rear Admiral William A. Brockett, the chief of the Bureau of Ships, and his deputy, Rear Admiral Charles A. Curtze,\n\n______________\n\n27 McNamara believed that what the Defense Department really lacked were the necessary management tools found in the private sector that would “make sound decisions on the really crucial issues of national security” possible. Instead of organizational reform that would have required congressional approval, such as the elimination of the current service structure, he would provide the department with a “new planning system [that] allowed us to achieve a true unification of effort within the Department without having to undergo a drastic upheaval of the entire organizational structure.” See Robert S. McNamara, The Essence of Security: Reflections in Office (NY: Harper & Row, 1968), 88, 95.\n\n28 See, for example, the hearings on the Defense Procurement Process held on 13 and 20 September 1984 and on 30 January 1985.

In July 1969, the commander of Naval Ship Systems Command, Rear Admiral Edward J. Fahy, retired for comparable reasons.31 CNO Admiral Arleigh M. Burke (August 1955–August 1961) believed that such centralization stifled initiative and would leave an “ignorant” civilian bureaucracy in “command” of the military.32 Despite these concerns, the defense establishment retained McNamara’s administrative and institutional foundation.\n\nOn 15 July 1985, President Ronald W. Reagan used an executive order to charter the Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management.33 The commission, popularly known as the Packard Commission after its chairman, David Packard, reviewed defense acquisition in response to a number of high-profile scandals that occurred during the early stages of Reagan’s military buildup. The commission’s recommendations found a ready audience with the authors of the Goldwater-Nichols Act. The 87-page act was meant, according to the preamble, to “strengthen civilian authority in the Department of Defense,” enhance the authority of the unified and specified combatant commands, improve the formulation of strategy and contingency\n\n____________\n\n30 See Naval Institute, The Reminiscences of Vice Admiral Raymond E.

Washington’s enormous defense budgets had always attracted interest of numerous and disparate stakeholders, which in turn created a large number of external constituencies interested in a variety of reforms from weapons acquisition to oversight and changes in who can serve (and where they serve) in the military.\n\n_____________\n\n34 See Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, Public Law 99-433, October 1, 1986, http://history.defense.gov/Portals/70/Documents/dod_reforms/Goldwater-NicholsDoDReordAct1986.pdf; Staff Report of the Senate Committee on Armed Services (99th Cong., 1st Sess.), Defense Organization: The Need for Change (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1985), 6, http://digitalndulibrary.ndu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/goldwater/id/2160.\n\n35 Irv Blickstein, Defense Acquisition Reform: Where Do We Go From Here?, Staff Report, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, United States Senate, October 2014, 25, https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=714067&lang=en-US.\n\n36 See David Oliver, Defense Acquisition Reform: Where Do We Go From Here?, Staff Report, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, United States Senate, October 2014, 143; General Norton Schwartz, Defense Acquisition Reform: Where Do We Go From Here?, Staff Report, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, United States Senate, October 2014, 164, https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=714067&lang=en-US.\n\n37 Blickstein, Where Do We Go From Here?, 24.\n\n[15]\n\nWith time, a number of new, unintended complications arose with the legislation, and much of the post–Goldwater-Nichols Act reform effort has aimed to incrementally address the concerns and needs of the external constituencies.38 For some defense critics and policy makers the recommendations of the Packard Commission and the Goldwater-Nichols Act that followed have become insufficient for today’s new challenges.39\n\nThe most recent flurry of reform efforts started when it became apparent that the post–Cold War defense establishment was unresponsive to the administrative, planning, and equipping needs to fight the insurgencies in Afghanistan and Iraq. In March 2015, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) launched a two-year review of the Goldwater-Nichols Act to see if the three-decade old law remained relevant.40 Further guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense in support of this effort was meant to “reexamine the structure of the military staffs and the service secretariats to ensure optimal performance.” These efforts “must also be mindful of preserving civilian control over the military and the ability of the service chiefs to deliver military advice to the service secretaries.”41\n\nAlongside changes to defense administration, the post–World War II period has seen changes in the command of operational military forces. Since its inception in 1946, the military’s joint command arrangements, known as the Unified Command Plan (UCP), have concentrated\n\n_____________\n\n38 Paul M.

The Navy has tended to push back against this concentration, with limited success.\n\nAt the outset of the UCP, the commands covered specific regions where potential conflict reflected post–WWII realities and the disposition of U.S. forces (i.e., Europe, the Far East, the Atlantic). The initial plan also left entire areas of the world (Africa, the Middle East, most of Asia) outside of the UCP scheme. Since then, the plan has gradually grown to span the entire globe, through a combination of expanding existing commands and creating new geographic commands including Central Command (CENTCOM) and Africa Command (AFRICOM). The desire for greater cooperation among the services has also been advanced by the creation of functional commands linking service components with similar missions. Yet much of the post-1991 consolidation of the UCP has been as much about cost savings and a lack of a unified threat as a specific need for a joint force in a given region.\n\nChanges to the UCP have also occurred because of changes in the strategic threat environment. Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), the first new command added to the UCP, was created in 1954 to provide an integrated defense against Soviet bombers. Later, CONAD was disestablished and replaced by an Air Force specified command, Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM), in line with the change in the Soviet strategic threat from bombers to missiles. Space Command (SPACECOM) was established in 1985 to oversee the Reagan administration’s Strategic Defense Initiative program and later absorbed ADCOM’s mission. Although Northern Command (NORTHCOM), created after the 9/11 attacks, is geographic rather than functional, it was organized to serve as the military wing of U.S. homeland defense planning and contingency operations.\n\n[17]\n\nFinally, Congress created the Special Operations Command (SOCOM). Prompted by the failure of Operation Eagle Claw in 1980 as well as coordination issues in the 1983 invasion of Grenada, Congress sought to ensure effective command and control of service-specific special operations forces (SOF). In the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1987, Congress directed DOD to create a unified combatant command to oversee SOF. To ensure adequate oversight, Congress gave the SOCOM commander more authority than other combatant commanders, including oversight of “special operations-peculiar equipment” in the budget process and the career paths of special operations personnel in each service.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, changes to the UCP have been effectively manpower neutral with regard to headquarters staff. Secretaries of Defense and the JCS have been careful to ensure that the creation of new commands is balanced by the elimination of old commands. In most cases, the missions of an eliminated command are integral to the command that succeeded it, although there are two notable exceptions. The first is SOCOM, established in 1987, which took Readiness Command’s headquarters billets without absorbing its mission. The second is Joint Forces Command, which was eliminated in 2011 as a cost cutting measure; its missions were parceled out to other unified commands and the Joint Staff, but no command was created to take its place in the UCP.\n\nMost of the changes in the UCP occurred in the face of intense opposition from the uniformed Navy. Emerging from World War II, the Navy attempted to preserve its Atlantic and Pacific fleet organizations, which were reflected in the first UCP in 1946. That plan created three primarily Navy commands—Atlantic, Pacific, and Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean—and a key Navy goal in the Cold War period was to maintain the autonomy of these three commands,\n\n[18]\n\nwhile minimizing non-Navy control over Navy assets in other commands.42 Simply put, the Navy has consistently believed that naval warfare is unique from land warfare, requiring education, training, and experiences only possessed by naval officers. Since ships can move from region to region, the Navy has also argued that keeping ocean areas in Navy-dominated commands eases issues of coordination and planning.43\n\nTo that end, the Navy has tepidly supported geographic commands, which represent looser, more decentralized, patterns of authority.44 Of special interest to the service has been creating or maintaining commands that covered either oceanic or land areas, but not both. This way, the Navy could ensure the appointment of admirals for oceanic commands, while land-based commands under an Army or Air Force general would have few naval assets to “misuse.”45 In fact, the extension of the Army-dominated European Command into the Mediterranean may be one of the reasons the Navy deemphasized the region in the 1950s and 1960s.46 By the late 1960s, this had expanded to an attempt to draw a distinction between the NATO areas in Europe, necessarily dominated by heavy land and air forces, and the rest of the globe, where periodic crises demanded the rapid response available from the Navy and Marine Corps.47\n\n_____________\n\n42 Swartz, et al., Lines in the Sea, 77–78.\n\n43 Ibid., 110–12.\n\n44 Ibid., 110–12. For example, before 1958, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) had direct control over Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command, Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Command, and Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, not only as the Joint Chiefs of Staff executive agent/executive agent of the Secretary of the Navy, but also because those three commanders were the CNO’s purely naval subordinates as fleet Commanders in Chief (Lines in the Sea, 85–7).\n\n45 Ibid., 110–12.\n\n46 Ibid., 171–3.\n\n47 Ibid., 114.\n\n[19]\n\nOn the other hand, the Navy has tended to oppose the creation of functional commands, viewed as representing increased centralization of authority within OSD and the Joint Staff.48 While the Navy acquiesced in the 1954 creation of CONAD, which did not involve significant Navy assets, the service fought the creation of SOCOM, SPACECOM, and TRANSCOM in the 1980s, arguing that Navy special forces, satellites, and transport provided critical support for naval forces, especially in Pacific Command (PACOM) and Atlantic Command (LANTCOM), and that removing them from Navy control threatened the effectiveness of Navy combat formations.49 In the early 1990s, however, CNO Admiral Frank B. Kelso acquiesced in the assignment of Navy ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) to the new Strategic Command (STRATCOM) after receiving assurance that Navy officers would constitute 35 percent—355 of approximately 1,000 officers —of the new command’s staff.50\n\nThe Navy’s efforts to pursue its agenda with regard to the UCP have been mostly unsuccessful. Today, most of the geographic commands span large areas of land and ocean, while the functional commands have control over Navy ballistic missile submarines, space assets, special forces, and transport.51 However, it has remained unclear whether “these losses [have] had any appreciable effect on the Navy’s institutional health.”52 The one unqualified success of Navy policy with regard to the UCP has been the gradual expansion of PACOM to cover the entire Pacific Basin and parts of the Indian Ocean while always remaining under the control of an admiral.\n\n_____________\n\n48 Ibid., 110–12.\n\n49 Ibid., 93.\n\n50 Ibid., 307–12.\n\n51 Ibid., 115.\n\n52 Ibid., 330.\n\n[20]\n\nMeasuring success in such a complex reform environment, especially after 1986, has been problematic. Reform has typically been administrative, legislative, or a combination of both. The most effective reforms have changed the service’s and the Pentagon’s institutional culture. To that end it can be fairly argued that Secretary of Defense McNamara’s exhaustive administrative reforms to planning and programming have been the most effective as they fundamentally changed the services’ institutional culture with a firm emphasis on civilian control of defense programs. To varying degrees many of the other reforms have also found success, while simultaneously creating unforeseen complications that have required incremental, increasingly complex adjustments to the contemporary state of play.\n\nSince 1915 the ability of the CNO and OPNAV to recognize, adjust to, and accommodate rapidly changing political and strategic circumstances has been critical for institutional, organizational, and individual success. One advantage of internal changes in the Navy staff structure has been that they come with comparatively little political cost.53 In the interwar years, for example, the CNOs nurtured OPNAV’s war planning abilities. Recently, CNO Admiral Gary Roughead (September 2007–September 2011) established the Deputy CNO for Information Dominance (N2/N6) and created an independent Director for Naval Integration (N00X). CNO Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert (September 2011–September 2015) established the Deputy CNO for Warfare Systems (N9), eliminated the Director for Naval Integration (N00X), and assigned the Director, Assessments Division as Director, Capability Assessment Group with these additional responsibilities. Admiral Greenert also established the 21st Century Sailor Office (N17) and the Unmanned Warfare Systems Directorate (N99). However, these Navy staff\n\n____________\n\n53 More detailed material on the political costs (or lack thereof) can be found at Peter M. Swartz with Michael C.

Staff organizational changes have typically reflected the immediate needs of the CNO for flexibility and not the enduring organizational and institutional reforms defense reformers have demanded.\n\n[22]\n\nSelected Reference Chronology: Defense and Navy Reform Since 1798\n\n1798\n\n30 April: Congress creates the Navy Department. In 1789, Navy matters were the responsibility of the newly established War Department. However, with time, the burdens and responsibilities of managing both an Army and Navy become too onerous for one office. Secretary of War James McHenry (January 1796–May 1800) proves to be a disappointment, especially in managing naval matters. McHenry, acutely aware of the burdens of office, recognizes that his position may not be able to handle both an Army involved in confronting Native Americans in the West and quelling civil disturbances and a Navy capable of protecting U.S. commercial shipping interests abroad.\n\nBarbary corsairs operating in the Mediterranean continue to seize U.S. merchant ships and hold their crews for ransom. Increasing tensions over France’s seizure of U.S. merchant ships in the Caribbean and the subsequent “XYZ Affair” when three French representatives demand a bribe to restore relations with the United States only highlight further the nation’s need for a strong Navy. Some in Congress doubt McHenry is up to the task of preparing an adequate military response to such varied provocations.\n\nCongress thus creates the Navy Department. President John Adams appoints Benjamin Stoddert (May 1798–March 1801) as the Navy’s first secretary. On 18 June 1798 the new Navy Department begins work with a small staff out of offices at 139 Walnut Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.54\n\n1815\n\n______________\n\n54 See Michael J.

The Secretary of the Navy maintains responsibility for military issues, such as personnel appointments, discipline, and fleet deployment.55\n\n1842\n\n31 August: Congress creates the Navy’s bureau system. The Office of Navy Commissioners proves ineffective in managing increasingly sophisticated technology, which calls for greater expertise in technical areas. The commissioners fail to provide for the latest ship improvements, such as steam propulsion.56\n\nThe Navy’s initial five bureaus are Yards and Docks; Construction, Equipment and Repairs; Provisions and Clothing; Ordnance and Hydrography; and Medicine and Surgery. The bureaus have responsibility for the business side of the Navy, while the Secretary of the Navy handles fleet operations and personnel issues.57 The President nominates bureau directors with congressional approval.58\n\nThis organization does not remain static and often changes with the demands of both Congress and the Navy.59 The Secretary can redistribute the workload among the existing bureaus60 but not eliminate them or reorganize them based on the needs of the executive branch alone. The bureaus also have independent budgets and, over time, develop distinct relations with the congressional naval committees.\n\nCongress thus maintains “considerable control of the Navy” through the confirmation process of the bureau chiefs. This in turn creates an “alliance of mutual interest with Congress,” along with a certain degree of “independence from the Secretary” of the Navy.61\n\n_____________\n\n55 See Kenneth J.

Three of the original bureaus—Medicine and Surgery, Provisions and Clothing, and Yards and Docks—are retained, but the remaining two are reorganized into four for Equipment and Recruiting, Navigation, Ordnance, and Construction and Repair. A new bureau is added to deal with advanced technology, Steam Engineering. The increase in the number of bureaus represents a further subdivision of the “technical cognizance in the earlier bureaus.”62\n\n1869\n\n3 February: Outgoing Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles (March 1861–March 1869) writes that Representative Benjamin M. Boyer (D-PA), “who is on the Military Committee, tells me that General [John M.] Schofield, Secretary of War [June 1868–March 1869], was before the committee today and advised the consolidation of the War and Navy Departments under one head.” Welles denounces the recommendation as a threat to free government.63 Schofield’s proposal reflects what may be a reconsideration of the 30 April 1798 decision to separate naval activities from the War Department. Nothing further comes from the recommendation until early 1924.\n\n1882\n\n23 March: Secretary of the Navy William H. Hunt (March 1881–April 1882) further reorganizes the bureaus, establishing the Office of Naval Intelligence inside the Bureau of Navigation.64 In 1884 the Bureau of Navigation gains the responsibility for ship movements.65\n\n1889\n\n25 June: The Bureau of Navigation increases its authority when Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy (March 1889–March 1893) issues General Order No. 372.

Tracy (March 1889–March 1893) convenes an ad hoc policy board to coordinate policy, strategy, and ship construction. The board concludes that the United States needs a large battle fleet. The size of the plan shocks Congress, which agrees instead to a more modest plan for three 8,500-ton battleships for 1890 and stretches costs for additional ships over several years. Tracy recognizes the importance of political compromise, and instead of insisting on 20 Indiana-class battleships, he agrees that 12 is a more reasonable number given the ships’ projected capabilities.67\n\n1898\n\nMay: During the Spanish-American War, Secretary of the Navy John D. Long (March 1897–April 1902) establishes the War Board. It is to transform war plans developed at the Naval War College into actual operations.68 Under the auspices of the Bureau of Navigation, the board compensates for Long’s lack of naval experience and serves, as best as practical, as a de facto Navy general staff.69 The board’s mandate proves to be as short-lived as the war (April–August 1898)70, which does not last long enough for proper exercise of any new ideas in naval administration. The bureaus continue to jockey for influence and resources.\n\n1899\n\nFrederick Winslow Taylor’s scientific management theories emerge as important considerations\n\n______________\n\n66 General Order No. 372, 25 June 1889, Order for Official Communications, Naval History and Heritage Command, http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/g/general-orders/general-order-no-372-1889.html.\n\n67 Friedman, U.S. Battleships, 1, 5, 23–25.\n\n68 William L.

Navy officers are not immune to these influences (Taylor, a mechanical engineer, works for a time at the William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company in Philadelphia) and find themselves caught in the maelstrom during the transition from old to new ideas and notions of what it means to be a professional naval officer.72\n\nTaylor’s ideas first find purchase with Lieutenant Commander Holden A. Evans at Mare Island Navy Yard, near San Francisco, California. Taylor also works closely with Rear Admiral Caspar F. Goodrich when the latter serves as commander of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Goodrich, in turn, helps Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce found the Naval War College and serves as the third and fifth president of the college. Goodrich proves to be an advocate of “rational contingency planning”73 and certainly is one of a handful of Navy reformers who are in a position to translate theories into practice. As a reformer, Luce is likely aware of Taylor’s ideas. He uses the term “scientific management” in some of his writings and refers to the specialized term in quotation marks.\n\nTaylor also influences two other outspoken reformers: Rear Admirals William S. Sims and Bradley A. Fiske.74 Fiske publishes The Navy as a Fighting Machine,75 the title of which evinces Taylor’s systematic ideas of modern industrial management.\n\nAnother of Fiske’s supporters is Secretary of the Navy Truman H. Newberry (December 1908–March 1909).76 Apparently, Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer (March 1909–March 1913) finds Taylor’s ideas of little use, so in turn Taylor encourages the use of the term “scientific management.”77\n\n______________\n\n71 See Frederick Winslow Taylor, The Principles of Scientific Management (New York and London: Harper & Brothers, 1947), 7; Matthew Stewart, “The Management Myth,” The Atlantic, June 2006, http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/06/the-management-myth/304883/.\n\n72 See S.

From the start of the steam era in the Navy, engineering officers are classified as a separate branch of the officer corps. Despite their importance, they, like doctors and paymasters, are not line officers and could not rise to command a ship. To address the obvious equality issues that arose as a result of the dual professional tracks, Secretary of the Navy John D. Long (March 1897–April 1902) convenes a board to study the “causes of friction between the Line and the Engineer Corps” over such issues as authority, rank, and social status. In March 1899 Congress amalgamates the two, but differences remain.78\n\n1900\n\n13 March: Secretary of the Navy John D. Long (March 1897–April 1902) establishes the General Board of the United States Navy with General Order No. 544.79 The board is a compromise between a fully developed Navy staff and the bureau system. Some contemporary public comments refer to the General Board as a General Staff.80\n\nThe board serves as a quasi-Navy staff under the directorship of Admiral of the Navy George Dewey until his death in 1917.81 The Secretary of the Navy determines the board’s agenda, and the board advises him on strategy, types of ships, fleet size, and manning for the purpose of budget submissions to Congress. The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) becomes an ex officio part of the board when his position is established in 1915, but this ends in 1932 when the revised Navy Regulations removes him from the board.82 The board remains in being until 1951 when\n\n_____________\n\n78 See Furer, Administration of the Navy Department in World War II, 236–37; Petersen, “Fighting for a Better Navy,” 155–56. For his part, Mahan explained how he viewed the relationship between strategy and technology in a critique of the officer educational system. For Mahan, the current state of Navy officer education, with its emphasis on technology and engineering, was misguided. He had argued as early as 1879 that the “the manufacture of ordnance, the intricate questions connected with explosives, have a very close connection with the military part of [the officer’s] business. Yet to say that an exhaustive and exact knowledge of the various processes by which the finished gun and the proved power are furnished to his hand and the rapid though gradual advance made in each, is necessary, is to occupy ground that is not tenable.” Although Mahan recognized that understanding some of the technical aspects of warships and weapons design remained essential, he also believed that it was more important for naval officers, especially senior ranking officers, to comprehend the methods of employing the fleet, and the technical aspects of how an individual ship operated was of secondary importance.

This encourages them to be free from the bureaus’ daily activities and allows them to shape recommendations without undue bureau influence or interference. Their advice pertains to both “strategical and tactical matters.”87\n\n1915\n\n3 March: The Navy Act establishes a Chief of Naval Operations.88 The legislation states:\n\nThere shall be a Chief of Naval Operations, who shall be an officer on the active list of the Navy appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, from the officers of the line of the Navy not below the grade of Captain for a period of four years, who shall, under the direction of the Secretary, be charged with the operations of the fleet, and with the preparation and readiness of plans for its use in war.89\n\n______________\n\n83 John Trost Kuehn, “The Influence of Naval Arms Limitation on U.S. Naval Innovation during the Interwar Period, 1921–1937,” (Ph.D. dissertation, Kansas State University, 2007) 41, 45, 51n98.\n\n84 President Theodore Roosevelt, “The Defining Duties of the United States Marine Corps, Executive Order No. 969, 12 November 1908, https://www.mcu.usmc.mil/historydivision/Pages/Speeches/DefiningDutiesoftheMC.aspx.\n\n85 Howe, George von Lengerke Meyer, 447, 456.\n\n86 U.S. Congress, testimony of George von L.

Fiske leads a group of Navy reformers that had pushed for a full Navy staff for years.90\n\n11 May: Captain William S. Benson becomes the first Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Benson had been in command of the Philadelphia Navy Yard when selected to be CNO. With the exception of George Dewey, the Admiral of the Navy, the highest permanent grade for flag officers was rear admiral. These officers served in three- and four-star billets (such as fleet commanders) and then reverted to rear admiral upon completion of their tour. Many reformers believed Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske would be the first CNO, but Fiske knew he had no chance after he circumvented Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels (March 1913–March 1921) and went directly to Congress to get his version of the CNO language into the Naval Appropriations Act of 1916.91\n\nJuly: Thomas A. Edison organizes the Naval Consulting Board as a private body at the request of Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels (March 1913–March 1921). The board received legislative recognition in the Naval Appropriations Act of 1916. It functions as a civilian advisory board on inventions and never formally dissolves, holding annual meetings until 1943.92\n\n21 July: President Thomas Woodrow Wilson issues an ultimatum to Germany regarding the sinking of RMS Lusitania, warning that Washington considers any future sinkings as “deliberately unfriendly” acts.

The act requires the President to coordinate the requests for all agencies and send a comprehensive budget to Congress. It also creates the Bureau of the Budget, now the Office of Management and Budget.103 In response, the Secretary of the Navy appoints Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Robert E. Coontz (November 1919–July 1923) as the Budget Officer of the Navy.104 He is the only CNO to serve as budget officer; the position moves to the Navy secretariat in 1923.105\n\n12 July: Congress creates the Bureau of Aeronautics. Previously, naval aviation is under the control of a director of aviation in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Rear Admiral David Taylor, Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, believes that the office of the CNO is not up to the task and lobbies Congress to establish a Navy bureau of aviation as a distinct entity. Other reformers, such as Rear Admirals Bradley A. Fiske and William S. Sims, concur with Taylor’s ideas. Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby (March 1921–March 1924), CNO Admiral Robert E. Coontz (November 1919–July 1923), and former Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels (March 1913–March 1921) support the idea, as do the bureau chiefs and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.106 The new bureau has charge of all matter\n\n_____________\n\n100 Robert Greenhalgh Albion, Makers of Naval Policy 1798-1947 (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1980), 371.\n\n101 Henry P.

In late 1921, the Chief of Naval Operations established the WPD after other sections of the old Planning Division shifted to elements of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations staff or to the bureaus. The division’s main mission is to prepare various war plans color coded for different nations: orange (Japan), red (Great Britain), black (Germany), silver (Italy), etc. Orange is seen as the most likely adversary and is the focus of most of the division’s work for the next two decades. The WPD, with an initial staff of nine officers, works with the Naval War College (war games at Newport) and the fleet (Fleet Problems) throughout the period to develop, tests, and improve the plans.108\n\n21 January: From his position as President Warren G. Harding’s (March 1921–August 1923) special representative on the Joint Congressional Committee on Reorganization of the Administrative Branch of the Government, Walter F. Brown recommends that “the War and Navy Departments be divested of all activities not directly related to national defense and then consolidated into a single department to be known as the Department of Defense, which, in addition to the Army and Navy Divisions shall include a Division of National Resources.”\n\nThe proposal is not new. On 28 August 1921, Brown explains in an article in the New York Times that such reorganization would provide “great economies . . . through the saving of overhead expenses and the joint purchase of supplies, the use of interchangeable guns and munitions, and the joint training of soldiers and sailors.” Congress creates the Joint Committee in 1920 for the purpose of investigating and formulating legislation on executive branch reorganization. Eventually the White House appoints Brown as the executive branch’s representative on the committee, which is allowed with a special amendment. Brown drafts a proposal that the president’s cabinet debates and modifies.109 Brown becomes Postmaster General under President Herbert C. Hoover (March 1929–March 1933) and remains an influential member of the Republican Party.\n\n_____________\n\n107 Roy Grossnick, United States Naval Aviation, 1910–1995, (Washington DC: Naval Historical Center 1996), 49; William F.

The United States, France, Great Britain, and Japan also agree to consult with each other in the event of a crisis in East Asia.111\n\nThe Five Power Treaty is the major agreement of the conference limiting naval armament by the use of tonnage restrictions and ratios. The total tonnage for capital ships (battleships and battlecruisers) and aircraft carriers for each nation, as well as maximum tonnage for individual capital ships and aircraft carriers, is limited. Tonnage allocations for each signatory nation are ratio based; 5 (U.S. and Britain):3 (Japan):1.75 (France and Italy). All other warships must be no larger than 10,000 tons and with guns no larger than 8-inch bore. The treaty reflects, for the most part, the limitations that the United States proposes at the start of the conference. The one major difference is in the area of “auxiliary craft,” which includes destroyers that the treaty does not cover. The treaty, with its limits on improvements to Pacific bases contained in Article XIX, leads the Navy “to design a measurably different fleet than it might otherwise have done” in the absence of limitations. It codifies “parity between the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy” and establishes, according to one modern scholar, the “U.S. Navy’s superiority in capital ships over the Imperial Japanese Navy.”112\n\nThe conference restrictions help stimulate interwar U.S. Navy reform.\n\n15 April: Representatives Clifton N. McArthur (R-OR) and William S. Vare (R-PA) sponsor the amendments to the Naval Appropriations Act of 1923 that authorizes 86,000 enlisted men for the Navy for fiscal year 1923. At the beginning of fiscal year 1922, the Navy reduces the number of enlisted personnel from 115,000 to 106,000. Given the political support for fiscal retrenchment, Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Robert E. Coontz (November 1919–July 1923) anticipates further reductions, but wants to maintain a force of 96,000 sailors. Republican leaders of the House Committee on Appropriations recommended a reduction to 67,000 enlisted men, despite President Warren G. Harding’s (March 1921–August 1923) support for a force of 86,000. CNO Coontz and his staff obtain a copy of the committee recommendation and respond that such reduced manning would all but nullify the 5:5:3 provisions of the Washington Treaty. Coontz considered the passage of the McArthur-Vare Amendment one of his greatest achievements as CNO.\n\n_____________\n\n110 Department of State, The Washington Naval Conference, https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/naval-conference.\n\n111 Ibid.\n\n112 See “A Treaty Between the United States of America, The British Empire, France, Italy, and Japan, Limiting Naval Armament,” Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Senate, 67th Cong., 2nd Sess., Document No. 126 (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1922), 871–87; John T.

This was part of the larger financial challenges facing the Navy in this period.114\n\n31 May: The General Board agrees that the Five Power Treaty gives “formal international recognition to the principle of an American Navy second to none, which has thus become the national policy.”115\n\n15 November: Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Robert E. Coontz (November 1919–July 1923) cancels winter maneuvers. The CNO’s Annex to The Annual Reports to the Navy Department for 1922 includes one simple sentence: “The winter maneuvers contemplated for the year were abandoned on account of the lack of fuel.”116 The Navy lacks funding to carry out necessary training. In the same annex Coontz states: “An arbitrary sum was appropriated to be expended for fuel. This sum proved absolutely inadequate . . . . ” In previous years, the fuel estimate is made with the “understanding that deficiencies could be incurred” and paid from later years or supplements.\n\nCongress agrees that the arbitrary amount was inappropriate and indicates “that this practice would no longer continue.” Coontz emphasizes that “operations relied entirely on fuel,” either coal or oil, of which the need and cost may vary, not “an amount to be paid for fuel.” Fleet operations and training, as well as manning, is also part of the ongoing financial challenges facing the Navy.117\n\n1924\n\n7 January: The Congressional Joint Committee on the Reorganization of the Administrative Branch of the Executive Department begins hearings, which last through the 31st, on the consolidation of the Navy and War Departments.

Weeks (March 1921–October 1925) and Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby (March 1921–March 1924) strongly oppose consolidation.\n\nWeeks maintains that the currently existing joint organizations, which include the Joint Army and Navy Board, the Joint Army and Navy Planning Committee, the Joint Aeronautical Board, the Army and Navy Munitions Board, and the local joint planning committees are “adequate and efficient machinery . . . to prevent duplication of effort and to insure unity of planning and the effective and efficient conduct of joint operations.”\n\nWeeks maintains that “to attempt to apply methods applicable to civil business to the military and naval forces would result in reduced efficiency and lower esprit de corps.” He adds that only men without the necessary “military or naval experience” support consolidation.\n\nSecretary Denby agrees with Weeks’ opposition and believes the two departments are “vital and well-administered.” He adds that he knows of “no officers in the Navy Department” who support consolidation.\n\nThe committee eventually rejects Brown’s recommendations for consolidation. However, its rejection does not stop consideration of a single defense department. With only the exceptions of 1928, 1934, 1937, and 1938, each year saw at least one bill or resolution before Congress calling for unification.118\n\n24 March: The House of Representatives establishes the Lampert Committee, under the chairmanship of Representative Florian Lampert (R-WI), to assess the status of the Army Air Service.119\n\n1925\n\n26 February: Representative John B. P. C. Hill (R-MD) offers a congressional resolution, according to historian Dr. Robert Albion, “authorizing the investigation of the advisability of creating a Department of Defense, with Under Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air.”120\n\n30 November: The Morrow Board, a collection of well-known military and political figures, releases its report on the status of U.S. aviation.

Morrow, after the 3 September 1925 loss of the Navy dirigible Shenandoah. Morrow, a respected diplomat, politician, and businessman, and the board investigate the status of U.S. aviation, including the growing interest from the military departments. The board in its conclusion rejects any idea of a unified defense department.121\n\n14 December: The Lampert Committee, named for its chairman, Representative Florian Lampert (R-WI), which the House of Representative established on 24 March 1924 to assess the status of the Army Air Service, proposes the consolidation of the Navy and War Departments into a single defense department. This conflicts with the recently released recommendations of the Morrow Board.122\n\n1926\n\n11 December: The General Board of the Navy expresses concern over the loss of naval parity with Great Britain, including the loss of skilled workers and the disconnection between “phased [ship] construction” and fiscal authorizations.123\n\n1930\n\n22 April: The United States signs the London Naval Treaty. Unlike the previous Washington Naval Treaty, this addresses destroyer numbers. It defines destroyers as “surface vessels of war the standard displacement of which does not exceed 1,850 tons (1,880 metric tons), and with a gun not above 5.1-inch (130mm) caliber.” The treaty’s Article 8 exempts destroyers from the U.S.’s 150,000 ton limitation, but only so long as they did not mount guns above 6.1 inches, have more than four guns above 3-inches, could not launch torpedoes, or were “designed for a speed greater than twenty knots.”124\n\nArticle 16 establishes tonnage totals for destroyers, “not to be exceeded on the 21st December, 1936 . . . ” For the United States, this total is 150,000 tons with the demand that “vessels which cause the total tonnage in any category to exceed the figures . . . shall be disposed of gradually during the period ending on the 31st December 1936.” The treaty also limits the size of destroyers. No “more than sixteen per cent of the allowed total tonnage shall be employed in\n\n__________\n\n121 Ibid.; Thomas H.

Roosevelt signs the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933.126 This creates economic stimulus through government and industry cooperation. It suspends antitrust laws, calls for industrial self-regulation, and allows companies to write industry-wide “codes of fair competition” for the protection of consumers, competitors, and employers that effectively fix prices and wages. It also establishes production quotas, and imposes restrictions on entry of other companies into the alliances. Employees receive the right to organize and bargain collectively and could not be required, as a condition of employment, to join or refrain from joining a labor organization.\n\nFor the most part, the shipbuilding industry supports the act. Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company begin building the aircraft carriers Yorktown (CV-5) and Enterprise (CV-6). Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation begins construction of two heavy cruisers, Quincy (CA-39) and Vincennes (CA-44). Other builders, such as Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Electric Boat Company, New York Shipbuilding Corporation, and Bath Iron Works receive portions of new ship construction programs.127\n\n7 December: Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson (March 1933–July 1939) signs General Order 241, establishing the Fleet Marine Force.128\n\n1934\n\n27 March: President Franklin D. Roosevelt signs the Naval Parity Act (PL 135),129 popularly known as the Vinson-Trammell Naval Parity Act because of its congressional sponsors, Representatives Carl Vinson (D-GA) and Park M. Trammell (D-FL).\n\nThe U.S. Navy is not building ships to the numbers and tonnage allowed in either the Washington or London Treaties, and the act authorizes the acquisition of 102 warships within the confines of both. It requires that:\n\n___________\n\n125 Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armament, Treaty Between the United States of America and Other Powers, Treaty Series, No. 830 (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1931), 23–24.\n\n126 National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, 16 June 1933, http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=66.\n\n127 Thomas C.

The scope is far-reaching, especially with the low-dollar minimum reporting requirement. It also covers, in the words of the General Accounting Office in 1980, “practically all tiers of subcontractors and material suppliers that contribute to a completed aircraft or vessel.” By 1980, the act is still in effect although circumstances that surround its adoption in 1934 are no longer present. There is bipartisan agreement that the act is no longer “workable.”130\n\n1938\n\n17 May: The Naval Expansion Act of 1938 (PL 528), otherwise known as the second Vinson Act, authorizes the President, within the limitations of the Washington and London Treaties, an increase—estimates are approximately 20 percent—in the tonnages of authorized vessels, including capital ships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. The act allows for a 46 percent increase in aviation construction over the current building program. It also authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Navy “to appoint a board consisting of not less than five officers to investigate and report upon the need, for purposes of national defense, for the"
