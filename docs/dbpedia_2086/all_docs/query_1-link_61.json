        "text": "My name is Tasha Anna Williams and I'm a specialist in the US Army. My name is Dante Williams and I'm also a specialist in the US Army. We've been together for almost seven years and we've been here for about three years now.\n\nThere are plenty of housing options on base for families. We got the option of choosing between three different communities. We chose to stay in Liberty woods here and Fort Stewart.\n\nWe currently live in a four-bedroom townhome. It has a living room, the kitchen area, in the dining area upstairs we have four bedrooms with our kids room our master bedroom. The guest bedroom and Dante's mancave. So we have quite a bit of space that we can just be comfortable. In living on base is important to me because I can get to work in like five minutes from the commissary, is right there, so everything that we need is here on base.\n\nQuite often we have barbecues or we grill out and we either do it at the neighbor's house or our House. And they just bring their kids over and their families over and we just you know relax and watch the game and eat some barbecue. The things that I enjoy for the kids and there's a playground at every spot we can go to either the one down the street or take them to everyone around the corner and so it's a variety of things that the kids can do. My kids are really happy here, they love playing in the backyard and every time they see somebody out the window they're like mommy my friends playing outside when I see my children happy it makes me happy.\n\nI got shiner after I had already joined the military. I got him about six years ago and I've been in the military for eight years now. Things like to do with shiner on basis I like to take him over to the dog park. Let him run around throw the ball for Him. I'll take him you know to the pond sometimes he likes riding in the back of the truck. You have to check with your specific housing to see which pets are allowed for example they don't allow pets in the barracks. But currently in the apartment complexes, I believe it's just dogs and cats. I do feel fortunate to have amenities on post they have not only a vet but also a boarding facility on post everybody that works there is super nice and just makes the whole process a lot easier. I think people think that you can't have a pet in the military because people think when they go into the military they just are always deployed or never home but that's not true just like having a pet as a civilian. It's important to me that shiner has a good life because he keeps me centered and happy he brightens my day when I get home."
