        "text": "Yes. We regularly change our processing times as demand for vital records varies throughout the year. From late winter into summer, demand for vital records is generally higher than other periods of the year. We encourage you to plan ahead and apply during our traditionally slower season in the late fall and early winter when processing times are generally faster.\n\nWe anticipate making additional changes to our processing times throughout the year. We will post updates on our site when we change our processing times.\n\nOur processing times are a range, and you may receive your vital record on a different date than your family member or friend who sent a request on the same date as you.\n\nNo. People born in the former Panama Canal Zone did not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship at birth. A Panama Canal Zone birth certificate can be submitted to apply for a U.S. passport. In addition to a Panama Canal Zone birth certificate, an applicant will also need to submit evidence of their parents U.S. citizenship (ex. birth certificate from a U.S. state or territory, U.S. passport, naturalization certificate, etc.) to fully document their claim to U.S. citizenship.\n\nNo. A U.S. military base overseas is not considered U.S. territory. Your claim to U.S. citizenship must be documented in the same way as any other U.S. citizen born overseas. If you are outside the United States, you need to apply for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad or a U.S. passport at a U.S. embassy or U.S. consulate. Inside the United States, you need to apply for a U.S. passport or a Certificate of Citizenship from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services."
