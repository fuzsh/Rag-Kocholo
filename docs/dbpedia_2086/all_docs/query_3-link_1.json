        "text": "On July 3, 1790, Revolutionary War veterans drew for lots in the Military Tract. The Military Tract was a vast area of land in Central New York that was divided into 28 townships, each comprised of 100 lots, with 600 acres in each lot. The townships were predominately named after famous Greeks and Romans, such as Homer, Cicero, Marcellus and Pompey, many of which have kept the same names. Soldiers were awarded between 600 and 3,000 acres depending on their rank. The Military Tract was taken from the territory of the original inhabitants of New York state, the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois as they are more commonly known; specifically, the Onondaga and Cayuga nations. According to the Onondaga Nation, between 1788 and 1822, the Onondaga Nation lost possession of approximately 95% of its land as more Americans/Europeans moved into Upstate New York.\n\nThis area of one million, 747 acres in the middle of New York State was set aside by state legislators as a bounty for men from New York who had served in the American Revolution. Privates and noncommissioned officers got 500 acres; high ranks more, the largest number, 2,000 acres, to lieutenant colonels and majors. Soldiers could claim their lands by pulling lot numbers from a ballot box. Records indicate that of 2,090 New Yorkers entitled to land, though many many sold their land or let it lie vacant.\n\nThe man credited with naming the 26 town within the tract was Robert Harpur, a Columbia College classics scholar who was New Yorkâ€™s assistant secretary of state. Harpur was a member of the board charged with naming the towns."
