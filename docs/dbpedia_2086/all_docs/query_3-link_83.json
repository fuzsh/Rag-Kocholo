        "text": "About\n\nFor more than a century, the History Division's primary task has been to preserve and promulgate the official record of the Marine Corps in peacetime and in war. In doing so, its archivists collect and maintain research materials (official documents, special collections, maps, oral histories, photos, and film/video) so that its historians might research and write official accounts on operational, institutional, and doctrinal topics and events; unit histories and lineage; and the establishment and lifecycle of Marine Corps bases/stations. Because of its focus, the History Division is not staffed to retrieve materials from our archival holdings, make copies of research materials, or research general queries for the public. We can, however, provide you advice and guidance on how to conduct your own research. Our intent for the future is to provide the general public access to our holdings though a state-of-the-art online website. Until then, access to the majority of our holdings is by way of in-person visits only. Queries from Headquarters Marine Corps, Marine Corps units and commands, Department of Defense organizations and agencies, and other government agencies will, however, continue to be our priority.\n\nFor visiting researchers (military and civilian), the History Division is located in a secured facility with controlled access. All researchers must request an appointment at least a week in advance when visiting. Appointments can be made through history.division@usmcu.edu. We are located on the campus of the Marine Corps University on board Marine Corps Base Quantico in Northern Virginia, a secure military reservation. Please review the base’s access instructions on the Marine Corps Base Quantico website at www.quantico.marines.mil.\n\nFor immediate assistance, we ask that you visit our website at www.usmcu.edu/Research/History-Division and search our current digitized collections. To expedite your research, consider the following:\n\nSearch our Archives Branch at https://grc-usmcu.libguides.com/marine-corps-archives/main to see where the information you are looking for is held. If you think the document is held by the History Division, go into the research tools area at the left of the webpage to see if it is listed in one of the finding aids.\n\nCheck our Frequently Requested Topics page to see if we have already posted an answer to your question.\n\nCheck our online bookshelf at www.usmcu.edu/HDPublishing to study and to see if you can glean the information from materials we have published.\n\nFor researchers seeking historical photos, please visit our Flickr page at or contact the National Archives in Washington, DC.\n\nContact the Marine Corps Association and Foundation at mca@mca-marines.org or call (866) 622-1775 for access to past articles featured in the Marine Corps Gazette and/or Leatherneck and that provide insight into the Marine Corps and its history.\n\nAnother source to consider for general Marine Corps history is your local library. Many of the most basic and even the most detailed questions about the Marine Corps can be answered with standard reference materials or by requesting specialized literature through interlibrary loan. Local libraries are one of our nation's most valuable resources and should be the first stop for anyone interested in pursuing research in Marine Corps history.\n\nCommonly requested topics often misdirected to the Marine Corps History Division center on awards, casualties, and service records. If you have queries on these topics, please follow these instructions:\n\na. AWARDS: For information on military awards (personal, unit, and service/campaign), please contact the Marine Corps Awards Branch, Headquarters Marine Corps at www.manpower.usmc.mil/webcenter/portal/MMMA\n\nb.

For anyone wishing to make a donation to the Marine Corps History Division, we consider archival donations on a case-by-case basis and only when the donations are of historical relevance (e.g., official documents, personal papers and special collections, maps, photos, film/video, and select Marine Corps history and doctrinal books) and research value. For material donations, such as Marine Corps uniform items, medals, and equipment, please contact the National Museum of the Marine Corps.\n\nWe thank you for your patronage, understanding, and support.\n\nHistorical Branch\n\nThe Historical Branch records the official institutional and operational history of the Marine Corps. It prepares a wide variety of publications, ranging from pamphlets, monographs, and occasional papers to case-bound histories, for distribution within the Marine Corps, the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, and to the general public. Publications produced by the branch are written works that provide an account of the planning, operational, logistical, developmental, and/or administrative activities of a specific unit, event, or period in Marine Corps history.\n\nMission\n\nIn accordance with Marine Corps Order 5750.1H, the Histories Branch is responsible for recording the official institutional and operational history of the Marine Corps. Located in the Brigadier General Edwin H. Simmons Marine Corps History Center on the Marine Corps University campus, the branch reports to the director of the History Division. It executes the director’s mission of preparing works that offer historical perspective and precedents to be used in decision making for policies, plans, doctrines, and techniques, and to support professional military education. Its historians are subject matter experts on the service’s history and prepare publications for distribution to the Marine Corps, the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, and the general public. In service of this mission, the History Division and the writers in Histories Branch produce a variety of publications, including battle studies, monographs, and definitive histories. These works provide an objective and thorough account of the planning, operational, logistical, developmental, and administrative activities of a specific unit, event, or period, thus fostering esprit de corps and ensuring that the history of the Marine Corps is available for practical study.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe origins of what would become the Histories Branch dates to the months after World War I, when Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels directed the Navy and Marine Corps to prepare institutional histories of their wartime experiences. On September 8, 1919, Major General Commandant George Barnett established the Historical Section, Adjutant and Inspector’s Department at Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, in Washington, D.C. In the subsequent decades, the History Division made several organizational changes, creating the Histories Branch and its three sister branches within the division, as well as a number of moves, from the Navy Annex at Arlington, Virginia to the Washington Navy Yard and finally to Marine Corps Base Quantico. Throughout, the mission to preserve and promote Marine Corps history has remained.\n\nTypes of Works\n\nTo find our entire catalog and stay up to date on the most recent publications, please go to the History Division's Publications page, which you can find here.\n\nSince the division was founded in 1919, its writers have been recording history that is applicable to Marines but appeals to other Federal agencies, scholars, and a general audience. The office produces a variety of publications of varying length in the fulfillment of its mission. These fall into three categories traditionally:\n\nHistorical Studies\n\nThe first are historical studies that reflect discussions occurring inside the Marine Corps and inform those responsible for making decisions that will shape the future of the service. These works can be three types:\n\nBattle Studies: Short case studies of single battles or campaigns involving the Marine Corps. Their length can range from 15,000 to 40,000 words.\n\nReference Pamphlets: Concise narratives on narrow topics in the recent past, these are intended to keep Marines informed and to provide answers to the public. Authors generally have been Marine officers. Pamphlet length can range from 12,000 to 20,000 words.\n\nOccasional Papers: Any product that is considered of intrinsic worth to the study of Marine Corps history but is not intended for mass publication. Design work is minimal and print runs are small. They can range from 10,000 to 190,000 words.\n\nCommemoratives\n\nThe second are works that commemorate important events in Marine Corps history. They are derivative works written for a popular audience and are of one type:\n\nCommemoratives: These short books (15,000-50,000 words) serve as History Division’s main contribution to Department of Defense efforts to commemorate major wars, in particular World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. They focus on a specific campaign, operation, or theme of significance to the overall war effort.\n\nOfficial Histories\n\nThe third category is official histories of the major wars that the Marine Corps has fought. In the production of these official histories, the office has followed an identifiable pattern for the last forty years:\n\nAnthologies: These are the first stage of official history and intended as an interim reference until there has been sufficient historical distance from the event. They are a compilation of articles, interviews, after-action reports, and other sources related to the study of a major topic in Marine Corps history. Primary material from the History Division’s Reference and Oral History Branches are also often included. They range from 70,000-160,000 words.\n\nMonographs: These are the first draft of an official history and are the most common History Division publication. They are book-length studies of campaigns and operations of considerable duration (6-12 months) and can range from 15,000 to 150,000 words. The division also produces thematic monographs on topics such as African-Americans in the Marine Corps and women in the Marine Corps.\n\nDefinitive Histories: These are the most comprehensive and highly detailed accounts of all aspects of Marine Corps operations during a major conflict that the History Division produces. They are the final stage in the process of producing official history, and use information from the anthologies and monographs. They draw on all available sources, from archives, oral histories, and secondary works. Definitive histories are usually divided into multiple volumes of 110,000 to 600,000 words each.\n\nSUPPORT OF THE MARINE CORPS UNIVERSITY STRATEGIC PLAN\n\nAs part of Marine Corps University and Education Command, the History Division and Histories Branch support MCU/EDCOM in the mission of preparing leaders to meet current and future security challenges and inform the public of the service’s role in national defense by preserving, presenting, and promoting the history of the Marine Corps. As the service’s institutional memory, the Histories Branch and its publications supply historical perspective and precedents to MCU students in their professional military education and encourage study and research on subjects relevant to Marine Corps history. This supports the MCU/EDCOM strategic plan of advancing the legacy of the Marine Corps’ warfighting excellence through a forward-thinking military academic institution.\n\nIn Marine Corps University Strategic Plan 2017-2022, Goal 5 focuses on university outreach: Leverage MCU’s scholarship, research, publishing, stewardship, learning opportunities, and conferencing capabilities in order to strengthen the MCU brand and to support the Marine Corps, the broader national security audience, and the public. Histories Branch helps achieve this goal through its publications but also by ensuring that its subject matter experts assist faculty and students in researching, writing, and publishing on a variety of topics that relate to national security, thereby promoting a greater understanding of the Marine Corps’ role in U.S. and world history. The branch therefore assists MCU in honoring the Marine Corps’ past while embracing the challenges of educating and training students to succeed in uncertain and unpredictable security environments."
