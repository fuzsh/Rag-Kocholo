        "text": "California mayor quits after email with 'I don't believe there's ever been a good person of color killed by a police'\n\nThe mayor of Temecula, California, has resigned after sending an email that read \"I don't believe there's ever been a good person of color killed by a police officer\" — something he blamed on a speech-to-text program he uses because he has dyslexia.\n\nMayor James \"Stew\" Stewart had previously apologized and said in a statement Wednesday \"I absolutely did not say 'good' I have no idea how that popped up.\" He said he intended to say he did not think there had ever been a person of color murdered by a police officer locally.\n\nThursday night in a Facebook post, Stewart said in part: \"My typos and off-the-cuff response to an email on a serious topic added pain at a time where our community, and our country, is suffering.\"\n\n\"I may not be the best writer and I sometimes misspeak, but I am not racist,\" Stewart said. \"I deeply regret this mistake and I own it, entirely. I am truly sorry.\"\n\nStewart said he would step down as mayor and from the city council effective immediately. The email came in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody last week. The white officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck and three other officers have been fired and criminally charged.\n\nTemecula is a city of around 114,700 in Riverside County, southeast of Los Angeles.\n\nNFL stars call on league to 'admit wrong in silencing our players from peacefully protesting'\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Saquon Barkley and Michael Thomas are among more than a dozen NFL stars who united to send a passionate video message to the league about racial inequality.\n\nThe 70-second video was released on social media platforms Thursday night and includes Odell Beckham Jr., Deshaun Watson, Ezekiel Elliott, Jamal Adams, Stephon Gilmore and DeAndre Hopkins, among others.\n\nThomas, the New Orleans Saints wide receiver who has led the league in receptions the past two seasons, opens the video with the statement: “It’s been 10 days since George Floyd was brutally murdered.” The players then take turns asking the question, “What if I was George Floyd?”\n\nThe players then name several of the black men and women who have recently been killed, including Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Eric Garner.\n\nThe video closes with the players insisting they “will not be silenced.” They also demand the NFL state that it condemns “racism and the systemic oppression of black people. ... We, the National Football League, admit wrong in silencing our players from peacefully protesting. ... We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.”\n\nThe NFL has been a flashpoint for protests over police violence ever since Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during national anthems before games. Kaepernick has since gone unsigned — and emerged as a leading voice in opposition of police violence.\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell spoke against Floyd's death but has been accused of hypocrisy and insincerity in his response, with critics pointing to the way the league handled Kaepernick's protest against police brutality in 2016.\n\n2 National Guard members hospitalized after D.C. lightning strike\n\nTwo people thought to be National Guard members deployed during protests in Washington, D.C. were hospitalized after lightning struck the area of their post not far from the White House early Friday, a fire official said.\n\nThe strike and possible injuries were reported shortly after midnight inside a perimeter anchored by Lafayette Square, the site of George Floyd demonstrations this week, according to Vito Maggiolo, spokesman for the district's fire and emergency medical services department.\n\nThe two were hospitalized in non-life-threatening condition, he said.\n\nImmediate information appears to indicate the pair wasn't struck directly. He said the victims \"felt the effects of a nearby lightning strike.\"\n\nOvernight White House social media director Dan Scavino retweeted imagery of lightning striking the capital.\n\nBuffalo officers suspended after shoving man to ground on video\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nTwo Buffalo police officers were suspended without pay Thursday after a video showed authorities knocking down a 75-year-old man during a protest, Mayor Byron Brown said.\n\nIn a statement, Brown said the suspension came after the city’s police commissioner launched an investigation into the incident.

We cannot cooperate with torture because George Floyd deserved better than that. We all deserve better than that.”\n\nCrump referred to Floyd’s final moments under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin as “inhumane” and invoked Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s call to action.\n\n“The plea for justice is simply this,” Crump said. “Dr. Martin Luther King said, ‘he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting is really like cooperating with it.’”\n\nCrump also reminded mourners that Floyd died not of the current coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 100,000 people across the country, but instead of the unspoken pandemic generations in the making.\n\n“I want to make it clear on the record,” Crump said. “It was the other pandemic that we’re far too familiar with here in America.

Attorney General William Barr said in a press conference Thursday that the Justice Department is \"seeing foreign actors playing all sides to exacerbate the violence,\" without going into specifics.\n\nBut a number of experts who track such behavior online said they haven't seen any significant foreign campaign surrounding Floyd and the protests that have cropped up nationwide in response to his death.\n\n\"These narratives are playing out on traditional media and social media platforms, but there is no evidence as yet to suggest a large-scale, covert interference campaign like those the Russian Internet Research Agency waged against the United States from 2014 until at least early 2020,\" said Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, which tracks such operations.\n\nRev.

Newton became a Christian and in 1778 spoke out publicly against slavery.\n\nIn 2015, President Barack Obama, a man with no previous history of public singing, sang the hymn at a memorial service for the nine African Americans killed by a white supremacist shooter inside one of the nation's oldest black churches, Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina.

As they do, the police fire some 15 rounds... over the course of about 30 seconds.\"\n\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley said in a news conference on Monday the officer had been aiming at another demonstrator but missed. “Within a moment’s notice after that, one of the officers fired their less-lethal munition at that individual, apparently, but it struck this victim instead,” Manley said, “and this victim then fell to the ground and it appears as though he hit his head when he fell to the ground as well.”\n\nMaredith Michael, a medic at the protests on Sunday night, shared a picture that showed she was also injured while trying to help Howell. She said in statement on Facebook on Monday: “I told the EMS that there was a young man dying, that I was just doing what the cops said to do, that they shot me and others who were trying to get him to the cops.”\n\nJustin Howell was a student at Texas State University, which released a statement saying that \"a heartbreaking situation has hit painfully close to home.\"\n\nIran's Khamenei says Floyd's killing exposes 'U.S. government's true nature'\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the killing of George Floyd in police custody had exposed the true nature of the rulers of the United States.

There will also be an increase in police training, he said."
