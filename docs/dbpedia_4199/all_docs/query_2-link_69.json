        "text": "No. The text of news articles will match in both formats, but other content can be different. For example, the digital website format does not include many print features, including weather pages, sports tables, stock prices and advertising, including paid obituaries.\n\nArticles on the website that were published between 1985 and 2000 often do not include photos, maps or other content that appeared alongside them in print. After 2000, this content began to appear more often in digital versions and increasing numbers of articles, extra photos and other content were published only online.\n\nAlso, the Times website does not have rights to certain freelance articles, book excerpts and opinion essays, most of these published during the 1980s and 1990s. These will only be found in the print versions at newspapers.com.\n\nYou may want to try external search engines (include “latimes.com” in your search) as well as the Times site search. Search first by a phrase, keywords, dates, a snippet of text or author. Standard search techniques can help, such as putting an exact phrase in quotes.\n\nIf you have the print headline and want to find the article on the website, it’s best to search for a key part of the headline because the headlines may be different.\n\nIt is normal to see multiple news articles on one subject, since events unfold over time. Also, regional editions of the newspaper sometimes printed different versions of an article. In the early years of the internet it was common to publish an article on the website during the day, then separately publish an updated version the next morning on the website and in print. Searchers online may also find additional coverage in the form of digital photo galleries, blog posts, newsletters and other formats."
