        "text": "OSU students,\n\nThe start of fall term within Oregon State University is just around the corner.\n\nWhile this year will undoubtedly be like no other given the pandemic, attention to racial injustice and inequalities nationally, and recent very serious wildfires and smoke affecting much of the state, I write to assure you that OSU will continue to deliver unwavering quality in all we do. We will inspire all of our students to learn and discover in supportive, engaging environments. OSU research, innovation and outreach will be more important than ever as we address humanity’s most pressing challenges. In the face of the pandemic and other matters of importance facing our state and nation, it will take each of us to be at our best.\n\nThe university’s Board of Trustees approved OSU’s Resumption Plan on Aug. 14, 2020, and we submitted the plan as required to the state’s Higher Education Coordinating Commission. This fall, we are planning for nearly 95% of instructional activities on the Corvallis campus to be conducted remotely. At OSU-Cascades, about half of all classes are planned to be offered on-site/in-person or in a blended format, with both on-site/in-person and remote instruction. Through limited on-site instruction, OSU is working to maintain low on-site density on our campuses. We also will provide expanded virus prevalence testing at OSU campuses and centers in Corvallis, Bend and Newport; support local county contract tracing efforts; provide for isolation and quarantine services; engage in extensive public health promotion; and promote adherence to new policies for Face Coverings and Physical Distancing. Here is a link to a video on what fall term will look like. Please share this link with fellow students, as well as with family and community members.\n\nThrough the work of our Continuity Management Team, as well as continued engagement with community stakeholder groups, health authority partners, and statewide coordination teams, OSU remains laser-focused on the health of students, employees and local communities.\n\nWe ask that you stay informed; participate in prevalence testing; adhere to—and encourage others to adhere to—OSU’s public health measures; and remain flexible. To keep you informed, we have added a COVID-19 dashboard located on the COVID-19 Safety and Success website. This dashboard includes important public health and other metrics that will be updated each week and inform adjustments in our plans.\n\nOn Sept. 16, 2020, we will host a webinar to provide an overview of the OSU’s testing strategy. At the center of this strategy is measuring the prevalence of the virus on campuses in Corvallis and Bend and at the Hatfield Marine Science Center. As part of this effort, we will conduct weekly random prevalence testing through the TRACE OSU team. While participation in random prevalence testing will be voluntary, for safety’s sake, we encourage you to participate when invited. Understanding the prevalence of the virus is key to having the data necessary to inform operational plans. Details on how to participate in the webinar will be shared in the next few days and will be available on the COVID-19 Safety and Success website.\n\nI remain both confident and realistic about OSU’s strategy. I have studied the resumption plans of numerous universities nationally and talk daily with university presidents across the nation. OSU’s plans are in alignment with the nation’s most prepared institutions. I recognize that it is inevitable that we will see more cases of COVID-19. When they do occur, be assured that we will engage in rapid testing, support local county contract tracing, and work to contain cases.\n\nSuccess depends on each and every one of us. We must act together as a community by engaging in and modeling protective personal and public health behaviors. Here is a video indicating my commitment and that asks each of you to join me. I hope you do join me and please share this video with others.\n\nTogether, we help build a safer and healthier community.\n\nSincerely,\n\nF. King Alexander\n\nPresident\n\nOSU faculty, staff and students,\n\nDue to prolonged smoke and ash conditions resulting from numerous wildfires in the Pacific Northwest, the following university facilities in western Oregon will close until further notice beginning at 3 p.m. today, Sept. 9, 2020:\n\nAll non-essential Corvallis campus educational, research, administrative, OSU Extension programs and campus operations.\n\nAll non-essential Hatfield Marine Science Center operations in Newport.\n\nAll non-essential county Extension offices and programs in western Oregon and all non-essential Agricultural Experiment Station operations in western Oregon.\n\nThe OSU Portland Center.\n\nEssential operations at these university facilities will be designated by department managers and include on-going critical research, University Housing and Dining Services, public safety and facility services operations. Programs and centers serving children, including camps and child care centers on OSU’s Corvallis campus, will remain open today until designated parents or family members are able to pick-up their children.\n\nEven while we prepare to close these operations, air quality in university buildings continues to meet federal and state standards. However, OSU is closing these facilities to enable university personnel to shut down air circulation systems in buildings that do not serve research activities that must be sustained or students within UHDS facilities. This will limit anticipated extensive damage to air circulation systems from infiltration of heavy ash and smoke residue. As a result and until further notice, all other non-essential OSU employees should work from home if their work can be performed remotely and with their supervisor’s knowledge. If an employee is unable to perform their work remotely, please see additional guidance as provided by on the Hazardous Conditions, Inclement Weather matrix.\n\nDuring this air quality crisis, we encourage you to be mindful of your health, as well as the health of your family and friends, by adhering to public health advisories.\n\nWe acknowledge that this week’s fire-related impacts are occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic, and are affecting university community members and communities that OSU serves. For updated information about fires throughout Oregon, visit the Oregon Office of Emergency Management Facebook page. For air quality and smoke information, visit the AirNow website. You also may visit your local county website for other pertinent local information regarding emergency management and evacuations.\n\nFor additional support and confidential assistance, students should contact Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) at 541-727-2131 or visit the CAPS website for information about counseling services. Employees seeking confidential support may contact Beyond Benefits, OSU’s new employee assistance program, at 855-327-4722 or visit its website. Note that OSUbeyond is the organization web ID needed for initial registration for the Beyond Benefits program.\n\nYou may seek ways to help those directly affected by these wildfires. Anyone wishing to volunteer or contribute food or other supplies to evacuees located at the Benton County Fairgrounds should call 541-224-1339 or visit this website for more information. OSU employees living outside of Corvallis should visit their local county emergency operations website to provide assistance to others impacted by the fires.\n\nAccording to air quality monitoring sites in western Oregon, air quality in some locations will improve some tonight and tomorrow while remaining in the hazardous range. In the meantime, please take care of yourselves.\n\nWe will provide further updates on the OSU Home Page and by e-mail in the days ahead.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael J. Green\n\nVice President for Finance and Administration\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nOffice of the Vice President\n\nDivision of Finance and Administration\n\nOregon State University\n\n640 Kerr Administration Building\n\nCorvallis, OR 97331\n\nPh: 541-737-2447\n\nDear Students,\n\nAs you prepare to return to campus, make sure to pack your masks or face coverings. OSU has a face coverings policy for common indoor spaces and outdoor spaces where physical distancing is not possible. OSU also has a physical distancing policy to contribute to the safety of the university. Make sure to keep 6 feet between others to help support a safer and healthier community.\n\nFor information on how to obtain a face covering, please see this site for a list of distribution sites and times.\n\nFor more guidance on navigating campus safely, please see the COVID-19 Safety & Success for Students site. For immediate assistance or answers to COVID-specific questions, call the COVID-19 hotline: 547-737-7211.\n\nTimely announcement: The Valley Library, scheduled to re-open today, has postponed its reopening due to a HVAC system issue. Please see the Valley Library Hours page for up-to-date information.\n\nThank you,\n\nOregon State University\n\nStudents are asking questions about what the different course delivery modalities mean. In a previous message to students, we showed you how to search for courses based on course delivery method:\n\nWe offer more information on what these modalities mean below.\n\nRemote Learning: These classes are 100% remote and exclude Ecampus courses. Students attend class sessions remotely at scheduled times (synchronously). There are no on-campus requirements. Students must be prepared to block class meeting times in their schedule and participate during those times. Class times listed in the Schedule of Classes use the Pacific Time zone.\n\nBlended Learning: OSU is planning for these classes to consist of both on-campus and remote elements. Unless health conditions change such that classes return to fully remote, students will attend class in-person and remotely based on a schedule from the instructor. Some components may include synchronous remote learning. Students must block class meeting times in their schedule and participate during those times. Class times listed use the Pacific Time zone.\n\nOn-Campus Only: OSU is planning for all instruction in these courses to be delivered in-person. Unless health conditions change such that classes return to fully remote, students primarily attend class in-person/on-site. Instruction occurs at the scheduled time and location listed in the schedule of classes. Students must block class meeting times in their schedule and participate during those times. Class times listed use the Pacific Time zone.\n\nEcampus: These classes consist of fully online (asynchronous) instruction and learning. Students participate via Canvas. Students meet regular deadlines and milestones throughout the course, but can participate in the course based on their schedules. Synchronous class meetings are not required.\n\nIf you have any questions about a particular course, please contact the instructor or the department offering the course.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Office of the Registrar\n\nDear OSU Community,\n\nUniversity Information and Technology is making two changes to help protect Oregon State’s e-mail from cyberattack and SPAM:\n\nBeginning this past Monday, August 31, a notification now appears at the top of e-mails when they are sent from outside Oregon State University. The notification looks like this:\n\n[This email originated from outside of OSU. Use caution with links and attachments.]\n\nThe notification is intended only to signal that the e-mail is from a domain other than Oregon State University and that care should be taken when clicking on links and attachments. Some trusted services OSU uses that send e-mail, such as DocuSign and Zoom, will appear with the notification, too. If you have any concerns about an e-mail you receive, please contact the Service Desk.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Duo will be applied to the Microsoft Office 365 services on campus, which will add two factor authentication (or log in). This improvement in security will help protect our community from abuse and assists in our compliance requirements.\n\nIn addition to these changes, you may notice less spam email going to your inbox. With this change, a review of your Junk Mail folder may be warranted to see if e-mail you wish to receive was placed there. More details about managing your Inbox/Junk folder are listed below.\n\nUIT is committed to ensuring our information technology infrastructure and services are resilient, high- quality, and conducive to a safe and productive learning, teaching, and working environment. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your IT Department or the Service Desk at 541-737-8787.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid McMorries\n\nDavid McMorries, Chief Information Security Officer, Office of Information Security\n\nOregon State University | University Information and Technology | 541-737-9561\n\nAs you get ready fall term, we want to be sure that you are technologically prepared for your class requirements.\n\nThe technology checklist provides you with a guide to prepare for technology requirements you may need to engage in remote learning. Take time to ensure you have the hardware, software and accessories listed. If you need technology support, contact the IS Service Desk.\n\nIf you need assistance with affording technology and textbook access, OSU’s Human Services Resource Center (HSRC) can help. If you are a student at OSU-Cascades, the campus library can lend you a computer. You can also search the Schedule of Classes for courses based on course material cost.\n\nYou can also search the Schedule of Classes for courses based on course material cost.\n\nLastly, check to ensure you have your correct contact information listed for the OSU Alert system to stay informed about any emergency notifications. To sign up or update your information, please visit the OSU Alert Portal page.\n\nMore technology resources and guidance are listed on the COVID-19 Safety & Success for Students website. For immediate assistance or answers to COVID-specific questions, call the COVID-19 hotline: 547-737-7211.\n\nAugust 24, 2020\n\nDear OSU Students,\n\nI am writing to provide attention to important updates to OSU’s COVID-19 safety policies.\n\nPhysical Distancing Policy:\n\nStatewide mandates on gatherings and social get togethers have also been updated by the governor and OSU has updated its policy to align and supplement these requirements.\n\nAdditionally, as we have seen across the nation, social get-togethers continue to take place without the necessary precautions of keeping physical distance. Large crowds gathering in spaces not suited for adequate physical distancing may create greater risk to the university and local communities.\n\nWith that risk in mind, OSU’s Physical Distancing Policy now provides requirements for students on gatherings and social get-togethers, on and off campus. Until further notice, and enforceable through the Code of Student Conduct, students must restrict their attendance at and hosting of social get togethers to 10 people or fewer, indoor and outdoor, while residing or participating in an activity in the state of Oregon, regardless of whether the get together is related to University business or on University property, unless a more restrictive law or Oregon Health Authority guidance applies. While not accountable to the Student Code of Conduct, we ask OSU faculty and staff also to observe the university guideline prohibiting indoor and outdoor social gatherings to no more than 10 people.\n\nFace Covering Policy:\n\nWe appreciate the OSU community’s commitment to adhering to the university’s important public health measures regarding face coverings. With Gov. Kate Brown’s August issuance of statewide mask, face covering, and face shield guidance, OSU has updated its policy to align with the state of Oregon’s requirements and limited exceptions. Moving forward, requests from individuals to not comply with the university’s policy or otherwise be exempted will require approval through our existing disability accommodation processes. Employees who seek an exemption based on a disability can direct their accommodation request through the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access. Students may contact Disability Access Services for an exemption request for accommodation based on disability. Requests not based on a disability may directed to the OSU Coronavirus Response Coordinator at [email protected].\n\nIn addition, please be aware that in some instances, OSU’s Face Covering Policy may be more restrictive than state of Oregon guidance.\n\nPlease familiarize yourself with both updated policies. Through continued adherence to Gov. Kate Brown's Executive Orders, OHA Guidelines and OSU policy and the OSU Resumption Plan, we will continue to seek to minimize the risk and spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nThank you,\n\nDan Larson\n\nVice Provost for Student Affairs\n\nOSU Coronavirus Response Coordinator\n\nDear Students,\n\nAs OSU prepares for fall term, we will provide timely updates on important topics.\n\nOSU’s Corvallis campus is planning to offer most classes remotely, but is planning to offer some in-person class options. OSU-Cascades plans to offer approximately 50% of classes in-person or with blended remote and in-person instruction. You may search for remote classes and blended classes in the Schedule of Classes. Blended classes are anticipated to include a mix of in-person and remote learning.\n\nIn the Schedule of Classes, remote classes will display “Remote Learning RL” in the Meeting Info or in the Attribute Description section. Blended Learning classes will display in the Attribute Description section.\n\nOnce you have your class schedule, you can also see the location where the class will be held or if a class is remote through MyOregonState in the Academic Resources tab. You can do so two ways:\n\nClick ‘My Week at a Glance.’\n\nIt will take you to Online Services, where you can enter a date during fall term to see your schedule:\n\nOr, you can click ‘View Your Class Schedule in Detail.”\n\nThis will also take you to Online Services, where you can select fall 2020 and see details about your class:\n\nIf your physical campus-based course does not display “RL or Remote Learning,” it means that you will follow the regular class schedule, attending in-person. If for some reason this presents challenges for you, you may wish to talk with your academic advisor about a schedule that accommodates your needs. Just be sure to do so within the add/drop period as published on the Academic Calendar.\n\nYou can use the Scheduler to help you create a schedule that fits your needs.\n\nFor more information on student resources and guidance, please see the COVID-19 Safety & Success for Students website. For immediate assistance or answers to specific COVID-19 questions, call the OSU COVID-19 hotline: 547-737-7211.\n\nOregon State Students:\n\nBack in June, we told you about MyOregonState - the modern, friendly and personalized dashboard built to replace MyOSU. Starting today, all students will be directed to MyOregonState by default.\n\nReally putting the \"my\" in MyOregonState\n\nMyOregonState is designed for YOU. It goes where you go, whether that's on your laptop or phone, in the library or on the go. It's personalized and tailored to fit your preferences based on your profile. And there's a lot more coming; we're constantly developing new features — requested by you! — and working on ways we can enhance your Oregon State University digital experience.\n\nGetting Started\n\nWe built MyOregonState to be intuitive and easy-to-use. If you can't find what you're looking for, try searching under Resources. You can favorite any resource by clicking the heart icon; your favorites will show up in your Favorites on the Overview page.

By far the most-requested enhancement request was \"dark mode\" and we heard you. Thanks to a talented student developer employee, dark mode for MyOregonState is here — enable it today in your profile menu!\n\nWhat about that other portal?\n\nDon't worry, you'll still be able to access MyOSU through September. However, starting today, MyOregonState is the official platform and we are beginning to retire the old MyOSU portal for good. You can learn more about the transition to MyOregonState here: https://is.oregonstate.edu/dx/my/launch\n\nHave an idea for us?\n\nWe're always happy to hear from you. And if you have any suggestions on how we can make MyOregonState even better, let us know: https://beav.es/o5y.\n\nThanks,\n\ndw\n\nDerek Whiteside, Director, Web and Mobile Services\n\nOregon State University | University Information and Technology\n\nAug. 14, 2020\n\nOregon State University is announcing a revised Title IX Investigation and Resolution Process in response to the U.S. Department of Education’s new Title IX regulations that are effective Aug. 14, 2020 and apply to OSU. The new Title IX regulations redefine what behavior is federally prohibited.\n\nWe recognize that concern has been expressed regarding these federally required Title IX changes. We also write to share that OSU remains strongly committed to fostering safe and inclusive living, learning and working environments for all members of the university community through processes that are fair and equitable. For example, all university policies remain in effect regarding allegations of sexual misconduct and discrimination by students and employees and the existing expectations for behavior found in the Code of Student Conduct (Code) continue. What this means is that reports or concerns that allege violations of those policies or the Code that fall outside the new Title IX definitions will continue to be addressed through OSU’s existing student and employee sexual misconduct processes.\n\nBy way of background, the university’s Title IX process was formerly found in two documents titled “Sexual Misconduct and Discrimination Investigation and Resolution Process for Complaints against Students (Student Process)” and a similar “Sexual Misconduct and Discrimination Investigation and Resolution Process for Complaints against Employees (Employee Process).” OSU also updated University Policy 05-001, Sexual Misconduct and Discrimination to include the revised Title IX definitions of prohibited conduct. In addition, OSU is issuing a revised Code reflecting the changes required by the new Title IX regulations.\n\nThe revised Title IX Investigation and Resolution Process can be found here https://eoa.oregonstate.edu/sites/eoa.oregonstate.edu/files/title_ix_process_final_8.14.20.pdf\n\nThe university’s Title IX Investigation and Resolution Process includes these changes mandated by federal law:\n\nRevised definition of Title IX sexual harassment.\n\nClarification of jurisdiction as related to responding to complaints under Title IX.\n\nIntroduction of a new hearing process involving 1) live hearings and 2) live cross-examinations for formal Title IX complaints.\n\nThe requirement that both complainant and respondent (formerly reporting and responding parties) have an advisor at the live hearing to conduct cross-examination. The university will provide an advisor for any party who does not have one for the live hearing.\n\nClear delineation of roles for university offices involved in Title IX matters – Equal Opportunity and Access will no longer reach factual findings on the allegations. Factual and policy findings will be reached by hearing officers from Student Conduct and Community Standards (for student matters), and by Employee and Labor Relations (for employee matters).\n\nClarified procedural protections and support resources for both parties.\n\nClearer descriptions of the voluntary facilitated resolution process option.\n\nGoing forward, the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access will continue to work in collaboration with the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards, the Office of the Dean of Students, Employee and Labor Relations within Faculty Affairs and University Human Resources, the Office of General Counsel, and the Office of Audit, Risk and Compliance. These partners will develop outreach programs and education opportunities to inform all members of our university community of our shared expectations for behavior and the processes that will be used for addressing allegations of sexual misconduct, including the new Title IX definitions.\n\nStaff in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access, Student Conduct & Community Standards, and Employee and Labor Relations, are available to provide information, guidance and support.\n\nWe encourage you to reach out to Equal Opportunity and Access at [email protected] or by calling (541) 737-3556. You also may contact Student Conduct & Community Standards at [email protected] or by calling (541) 737-3656, if you would like to learn more about changes to the Code and the student process. If you have questions about the employee process, contact Employee and Labor Relations at [email protected] or by calling (541) 737-3103.\n\nAs the new academic year begins, we look forward to engaging with our new and returning students, academic faculty, professional faculty, graduate assistants, classified staff, and student employees and working to foster an environment that supports student and employee success.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKim D. Kirkland\n\nExecutive Director and Title IX Coordinator\n\nOffice of Equal Opportunity and Access\n\nOregon State University\n\nKevin A. Dougherty\n\nAssociate Vice Provost & Dean of Students\n\nOregon State University\n\nCarol Millie\n\nDirector, Student Conduct & Community Standards\n\nOregon State University\n\nHeather Horn\n\nAssociate Vice Provost-Sr. Director Employee & Labor Relations\n\nOregon State University\n\nOSU community members,\n\nI write you regarding the university’s efforts to improve public safety services on our Corvallis campus, including licensed law enforcement.\n\nOSU considers the safety of all students, faculty, staff and visitors as a top university priority. As you may recall, university leaders and the OSU Board of Trustees decided in spring that public safety services on the Corvallis campus should include well-trained police officers, who are university employees and whose work each day supports the university’s educational mission and community values.\n\nHere is an update on OSU’s efforts to advance public safety.\n\nNumerous meetings with stakeholder groups involving faculty, staff and students have been held this summer to gather input regarding public safety needs, concerns and values. These meetings have engaged university administrators, including myself, and public safety leaders. I greatly appreciate this community input as it helps inform and guide our path forward.\n\nEdgar Rodriguez, OSU’s interim associate vice president for public safety and chief of police, has decided to leave his position at OSU effective Aug. 21, 2020.\n\nWhile at the university, Chief Rodriguez made significant progress with the development of our OSU police department and we are thankful for his efforts. We wish him the best as he pursues new opportunities.\n\nI have directed that we begin a nationwide search to fill the permanent Associate Vice President for Public Safety and Chief of Police position. Until such time that this position is filled — or an interim appointment is made — Paul Odenthal, senior associate vice president for administration, will oversee the operations of the Department of Public Safety, including the current recruitment of sergeants and officers.\n\nThe university’s public safety advisory committee made up of students, faculty and staff continues to meet regularly and provide review and recommendations on public safety programs and best practices on other campuses.\n\nAs you know, our contract with the Oregon State Police to provide licensed law enforcement services on our Corvallis campus ends on Dec. 31, 2020. Let me be clear about our plan to replace our contract with OSP: we will have a university-employed and directed police force serving the Corvallis campus and that serves the university’s educational mission and community values.\n\nThe safety and security of our campus requires us to be able to respond to criminal activity promptly with appropriately trained and equipped police. In order to protect our students, faculty, staff and visitors, we must be able to deter and intervene in criminal acts and properly investigate those acts. OSU’s public safety staff cannot adequately provide these services, nor can local law enforcement agencies.\n\nOSU’s Corvallis campus police force will follow the best practices and standards for community policing within higher education. We will hire outstanding people and train them to operate in accordance with our educational values and policies. We will hold our force accountable to those values and policies, and we will fund, hire and train staff to prioritize student, faculty and staff engagement, transparency, inclusivity, equity, crime prevention and partnership with campus and area social and health services.\n\nWe also recognize it is important to appropriately fund wellness, mental health and other social services for our students, faculty and staff. An evaluation of campus mental health, wellness and other support programs is underway. Once completed, we will move to expand these services and increase collaboration among public health, student support services, police and public safety programs to improve how we address campus underserved community needs.\n\nI understand and respect that some members of our university community hold different views about law enforcement than the approach I have described.\n\nAs we move forward, I ask that we continue to share our views on how OSU public safety programs can serve the university’s mission and values, and the safety of the OSU community. The opportunity to build a wholly new public safety program and police department will take all of us working together to get it right.\n\nSincerely,\n\nF. King Alexander\n\nPresident\n\nDear OSU Corvallis students,\n\nWe write to announce important decisions regarding instruction for the fall term.\n\nBased on careful monitoring of the status of the COVID-19 locally, throughout Oregon and nationally, we have decided that OSU’s Corvallis campus will deliver approximately 90% of courses remotely in the fall, making it possible for you to live and study from home if that is the best option for you.\n\nThis approach will contribute to student wellness and educational success, help limit the density of activity on-campus and in the Corvallis community, and help minimize the possible spread of COVID-19. The university’s COVID-19 Safety and Success website and this video offer details on what OSU will look like this fall. The following provides an outline of fall term.\n\nChoice: To the greatest extent practicable, we are providing you with the ability to decide the location that works best for you to pursue your studies. If you feel safest living at home and taking OSU courses remotely and online, almost all of our instruction will support that choice. If you choose to live on campus while you pursue your studies (mostly remotely or online), you are welcome at OSU.\n\nCourses offered on-site will primarily be those that have a heavy experiential learning component, such as labs and field courses. Therefore, some students—especially advanced undergraduates and graduate students—may need to return to Corvallis to order to take those courses and continue progressing in their degree programs. The OSU Schedule of Classes lists the instructional modality or format for each course: on-site/in-person, remote, a blend of on-site/in-person and remote, and online through Ecampus. Regardless of instructional mode, courses will be compelling and engaging, supporting you in achieving your academic goals.\n\nLiving on campus: Residence halls will be open for students who decide that living on campus is their best and safest option. We will offer only single and double occupancy rooms and create space for use in isolating and quarantining, should it be needed. We have adjusted our First Year Experience Live-on policy so that all first-year students otherwise subject to this policy may make the choice to remain at home. If students elect to stay at home and attend OSU remotely, no exemption request is required. Students with a current UHDS contract who decide to stay home must cancel their contract by emailing [email protected].\n\nBuildings with classrooms and teaching laboratories for in-person instruction and applied learning will be open during fall term, along with the Memorial Union, Dixon Recreation Center, Valley Library, buildings that provide students with student services and study spaces, child care, health and wellness, food services and emergency assistance. Student advising will be provided mostly remotely.\n\nFinancial assistance and student fees: The OSU Board of Trustees froze tuition rates for the 2020-21 academic year for continuing undergraduates enrolled at Corvallis, Bend, Portland and at Eastern Oregon University and we are increasing need-based financial aid assistance for eligible students. As well, fees associated with Student Fee-funded programs are now under review by student leaders. Information on any student fee reductions will be provided after student fee committees complete their review.\n\nLiving near campus. We know that many students remain in and around Corvallis during the summer months while others will return in fall in order to utilize the university’s facilities, information technology infrastructure, and support programs while taking remote or online courses. Therefore, the campus will be open under modified conditions to support those students, and we will have public health measures and COVID-19 testing protocols in place.\n\nWe ask all students and living in the Corvallis community to become a public health champion and vigilantly follow university and state guidelines indoors and outdoors regarding face coverings, social and physical distancing and indoor and outdoor social gatherings. In addition, we ask students this fall to conduct daily health screenings and stay home if they are experiencing symptoms of illness or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19.\n\nPublic health measures: In addition to face covering and physical distancing requirements, this fall OSU will provide enhanced cleaning protocols within university buildings; isolation and quarantine rooms in residence halls; improved HVAC filtration, where possible; expanded availability of hand sanitizer; and other public health measures recommended by local and state health officials. These measures are working well and have helped OSU to keep selected programs and services on-site and in-person over the summer.\n\nOn campus testing: We will test continuously for the prevalence of the virus that causes COVID-19 on the Corvallis and OSU-Cascades campuses and at the Hatfield Marine Science Center with the expert guidance of OSU researchers leading the TRACE-COVID-19 project. In addition to prevalence testing, we will monitor wastewater on our campuses and at HMSC for the presence of the virus. We are also exploring providing an initial test to students who choose to live on campus in Corvallis and students arriving from out-of-state hotspot communities.\n\nWe certainly had hoped that we would be at a different place in the national battle with COVID-19 by this point in the summer, such that we would be able to return to a significant complement of on-site and in-person instruction for fall term. However, we believe that in shifting to a primarily virtual instructional format, while also offering a limited mix of on-site teaching that facilitates students’ continued progress toward their degree, we will maintain a low density of activity on campus and help minimize the spread of COVID-19. Of course, we are prepared to pivot to fully remote operations if public health considerations dictate such a decision.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding as we adjust to ever-changing pandemic conditions and public health circumstances. Thank you in advance for remaining flexible and adaptable as we continue to prioritize your health and educational success.\n\nAs resilient members of Beaver Nation, we will continue to respond, adapt and recover from these challenging times and become an even stronger community and better university for our students and all we serve.\n\nSincerely,\n\nF. King Alexander Edward Feser\n\nPresident Provost and Executive Vice President\n\nDear OSU-Cascades students,\n\nWe write to announce important decisions regarding instruction for the fall term.\n\nBased on careful monitoring of the status of the COVID-19 locally, throughout Oregon and nationally, we have decided that OSU-Cascades will deliver about half of all classes in blended or in-person formats. On-site courses will be coupled with remote learning options, making it possible for you to live and study from home if that is the best option for you.\n\nThis approach will contribute to student wellness and educational success, help limit the density of activity on-campus, and help minimize the possible spread of COVID-19. The university’s COVID-19 Safety and Success website and this video offer details on what OSU-Cascades will look like this fall.\n\nChoice: To the greatest extent practicable, we are providing you with the ability to decide the location that works best for you to pursue your studies. If you feel safest living at home and taking OSU-Cascades courses remotely and online, almost all of our instruction will support that choice. If you choose to live on campus while you pursue your studies, you are welcome at OSU-Cascades.\n\nAbout half of all classes will be offered in blended or in-person formats. In addition, almost all courses offered on-site will include a remote learning option.

Students with a current housing contract who decide to stay home must cancel their contract through the myHousing portal.\n\nBuildings with classrooms and teaching laboratories for in-person instruction and applied learning will be open during fall term. The Fitness Center, Beaver Dam and Study Grounds will be open as long as public health conditions permit. Co-curricular and extra-curricular programs will be offered in controlled, reduced density environments; transactional offices (cashier, transportation, front desk, etc.) will offer reduced in-person hours of operation; and remote services, including advising, will be provided remotely.\n\nFinancial assistance and student fees: The OSU Board of Trustees froze tuition rates for the 2020-21 academic year for continuing undergraduates enrolled at Corvallis, Bend, Portland and at Eastern Oregon University and we are increasing need-based financial aid assistance for eligible students.

To serve these needs, the campus will be open under modified conditions to support those students and will feature public health measures and access to telemedicine through OSU Student Health Services.\n\nWe ask all students living in the Bend community to become a public health champion and vigilantly follow university and state guidelines indoors and outdoors regarding face coverings, social and physical distancing and indoor and outdoor social gatherings. In addition, we ask students this fall to conduct daily health screenings and stay home if they are experiencing symptoms of illness or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19.\n\nPublic health measures: In addition to face covering and physical distancing requirements, this fall OSU will provide enhanced cleaning protocols within university buildings; isolation and quarantine rooms in residence halls, HVAC filtration that meets CDC recommendations; expanded availability of hand sanitizer; and other public health measures recommended by local and state health officials.

Vivian and Representative John Lewis. We ask the university community to join us in recognizing the significant contributions of both men who devoted their lives to social justice and whose sacrifices brought about changes to better the lives of African Americans and all Americans that we enjoy today.\n\nAt the young age of 23, Reverend C.T. Vivian participated in his first nonviolent action to desegregate lunch counters in Peoria, Illinois. He became a minister because of his conviction that racism and segregation were moral issues. In 1955, he co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Nashville, Tennessee. The SCLC’s work centered on teaching students how to be leaders and activists to end segregation by engaging in a number of sit-ins and leading the first march of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nIn 1961, he joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) members in the Freedom Rides in Jackson, Mississippi where he was violently beaten by police. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. asked him to assume leadership of the SCLC in 1963 and he worked alongside Representative John Lewis to advance and eventually pass the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. After being punched by Sheriff Jim Clark on the steps of the courthouse in Selma he is quoted as saying, “You can turn your back on me, but you can’t turn your back on the ideals of justice…you cannot beat down justice.” President Barack Obama honored Reverend Vivian with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013.\n\nAs a college student, Representative John Lewis was a founder of SNCC and its first president. Additionally, he was one of the Freedom Riders. Representative John Lewis organized the March on Washington and delivered a stirring address to the nation on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. In 1965, he led the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama a day that is forever remembered as “Bloody Sunday”. Representative Lewis was severely beaten that day by Alabama state police. The beatings he endured never dampened his pursuit for civil rights and voting rights.\n\nRepresentative John Lewis introduced many pieces of legislation in congress. Legislation designed to support the poor, create jobs, gun control and universal health care. His legislation enabled the creation of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. This bill was first introduced in 1988 and failed many times before President George W. Bush signed the bill in 2003.\n\nSadly, many of us have forgotten what these men had to endure to secure our civil and voting rights. They suffered beatings that we can only imagine today as our collective voices continue to denounce efforts to deny the rights of others to vote and in the Black Lives Matter movement across the country. Let us honor them by remembering to vote and encouraging others to do so. I end with the final words from his address on Washington:\n\n“We will march through the South; through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham. But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today. By the force of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say: Wake up America! Wake up! For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient.” Rep. John Lewis, Speech at the March on Washington (28 August 1963).\n\nRest in power, Reverend C.T. Vivian and Representative John Lewis.\n\nCharlene Alexander, Ph.D.\n\nVice President, Chief Diversity Officer\n\n[email protected]\n\nOffice of the Provost and Executive Vice President\n\n20 July 2020\n\nDear OSU community,\n\nPresident Alexander and I recently wrote with an update explaining the principles and indicators the university is using to monitor the status of COVID-19 and decide the level of onsite activity at OSU locations. We emphasized that the health of students, faculty, staff and community members remains our top priority as we navigate the pandemic.\n\nIn response to questions received since our message, we have created an additional tool to clarify how we are determining specific levels of university onsite activity. The tool defines four public health condition levels, from Level 1—a condition in which a reliable vaccine and/or treatment is available—to Level 4, in which the governor has issued a stay-at-home order because an outbreak of the virus is in imminent danger of overwhelming health response systems. Details on how the health condition levels are defined, the extent of onsite activity associated with each level, and the indicators we are using to monitor changes in level are available on the university’s COVID-19 Safety and Success website.\n\nAt present, the University has designated most of its locations statewide as operating at Level 2: COVID-19 cases are present but they are relatively few, protective measures are working, and public health systems have adequate capacity to respond. Looking ahead to fall term, a Level 2 designation means we will teach using a variety of modalities, with a majority of instruction held online and via remote means. At Level 2, research and engagement activities and programs may take place onsite when physical distancing and other health measures are effective in providing for health and safety.\n\nAt this time, trends in some OSU locations are tracking toward Level 3, a condition characterized by protective measures under significant stress and public health response systems at or near capacity. For locations designated at Level 3, fall term activities would be characterized by very limited in-person instruction and very low onsite density of OSU employees, students and visitors.\n\nAs COVID-19 conditions across the state change, we will consult local staff and health authorities and make decisions regarding changes in public health status levels for OSU locations. Our Safety and Success website will continuously update the current public health level for all OSU locations. In this video message, Dan Larson, vice provost for student affairs and OSU’s COVID-19 response coordinator, explains how OSU will utilize the Level 1-4 tool in evaluating conditions by county and determining the extent of local OSU onsite activities.\n\nI want to stress the following:\n\nThe definition of public health condition levels is an information resource that complements our OSU Resumption Plan. We continue to follow the plan, which is guiding our efforts under modified return as of July 14.\n\nOSU has locations in every Oregon county. As conditions statewide may vary, the level of onsite OSU activity may vary, depending on location.\n\nBarring a Governor’s stay-at-home order and a Level 4 condition, we anticipate having some onsite activity at our Corvallis and Bend campuses in the fall, including instruction, research, extracurricular and co-curricular activities, and residential living. What continues to evolve is the nature and extent of that activity. All of our academic and administrative leaders are prepared to guide faculty and staff in adjusting plans as conditions change.\n\nAs always, our responses to COVID-19 will remain in full alignment with the guidance provided by state and county health authorities. Please see the OSU COVID-19 Safety and Success website for additional information.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdward Feser\n\nProvost and Executive Vice President\n\nOregon State University\n\nOffice of the Provost and Executive Vice President\n\n624 Kerr Administration Building, Corvallis, Oregon, 97331\n\nleadership.oregonstate.edu/provost\n\nDear OSU faculty, staff, and students,\n\nOregon State University believes that the safety of all students, faculty, staff and visitors is a top priority.\n\nWe recognize this is a unique and important time in the history of America. Much has changed as our nation and community grapples with the May 25 killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. At OSU, we are fully considering the implications of these events on our approach to public safety.\n\nThe university provides public safety services in many ways at OSU facilities throughout Oregon, including efforts to advance building safety, educational programs, campus patrols in Corvallis and Bend, support services to employees and students, emergency crime response and law enforcement services on the Corvallis campus, and collaboration with local agencies for fire and medical first response. OSU has a history of providing public safety services on its Corvallis campus since the mid-1930s and law enforcement services since 1974, including the Oregon State Police (OSP) providing licensed law enforcement services since 1989.\n\nThe provision of public safety on OSU’s Corvallis campus is transitioning while we engage our community in dialogue and manage the change from OSP providing law enforcement services on the Corvallis campus. As we take these steps, we assure that public safety services will reflect the university’s values and vision while supporting OSU’s teaching, learning and research.\n\nWith this in mind, we have reviewed our community dialogue and engagement plans to embrace further community input and feedback into the design of public safety programs and law enforcement services.\n\nUniversity leaders and the OSU Board of Trustees have determined that to serve OSU’s values and mission, address community needs and support public safety as a priority, it is important to bring law enforcement for the Corvallis campus in-house and provide university management of those services consistent with OSU’s values and principles and educational mission.\n\nGiven the requirements to implement its police services—and to ensure thorough and thoughtful community engagement—OSU extended its agreement with OSP for Corvallis campus law enforcement through the end of this year. To provide its own law enforcement services on Jan. 1, 2021, OSU will resume a comprehensive recruitment, hiring and training process for sworn officers that will include bias, diversity and de-escalation training.\n\nWe recognize the unique challenges of campus policing and are mindful of the national debate on best practices and standards for public safety within higher education. While the public often compares campus police with state or local law enforcement, there are distinct differences at OSU where campus partnerships are the foundation of public safety programs and law enforcement. We are committed to building trust through the sharing of information, transparency and open lines of communication and engagement with the campus community.\n\nAs OSU began to develop the structure of this new department, we did so intentionally with Corvallis campus community listening sessions in March and April. Data obtained from these listening sessions provided the OSU Public Safety Advisory Committee – a collection of faculty, students and staff—with an understanding of community sentiment regarding campus public safety. We also acknowledge the concerns shared recently by community members of color regarding policing. Community engagement has been and will remain a core part of the process to evaluate and recommend future public safety needs. Edgar Rodriguez, OSU’s new associate vice president for public safety and chief of police, already is meeting with many faculty, staff and students. Over the next month or more, he will hold meetings with more than two dozen OSU student, faculty, staff and community groups on the Corvallis campus to share his transition plan and receive valued community feedback to inform public safety programs and the future of OSU’s Department of Public Safety. This public safety outreach will include meetings with stakeholders at OSU-Cascades, the OSU Portland Center and the Hatfield Marine Science Center.\n\nWe welcome this opportunity for engagement with Chief Rodriguez as it will help inform, guide and transform his department to advance inclusive excellence and contribute to the safety and success of all members of the Corvallis campus community.\n\nWe will continue to provide updates in the months ahead and encourage you to participate in upcoming public safety meetings and regularly visit an updated Department of Public Safety website to be launched on Monday, July 20. Thank you for your interest and engagement in this very important process for the university.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichael J. Green\n\nVice President for Finance and Administration\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nOffice of the Vice President\n\nDivision of Finance and Administration\n\nOregon State University\n\n640 Kerr Administration Building\n\nCorvallis, OR 97331\n\nPh: 541-737-2447\n\nJuly 15, 2020\n\nDear OSU students,\n\nWe recognize the many challenges students and employees face during the pandemic due to a lack of available childcare services, youth programs and other caregiver resources.\n\nWe write to share that we are providing additional support and new programs for parents and families by expanding our youth-related programs and childcare service offerings. We know these services will be very important with the expected fall hybrid delivery of K-12 education in the communities in which OSU community members live.\n\nOSU Child Care Centers at the Corvallis campus:\n\nChildcare centers nationally are especially hard during this pandemic, and OSU’s childcare centers are no exception. OSU is working with existing university-based third party childcare providers so that services will resume as soon as possible. With our support and facilitation, we are hopeful that these contractors will re-open both the Azalea Child Care Center and Beaver Beginnings Child Care Center within Oregon Health Authority guidelines in early August. Please contact the Family Resource Center for information on service levels, safety precautions and other details.\n\nShort-Term Child Care Options:\n\nNEW! The Family Resource Center (FRC) provides short-term drop-in care for OSU students, called Our Little Village (OLV). Due to COVID-19, this program is no longer a drop-in childcare program and will be provided on a reservation-only basis. The university is allocating funding to expand this program to support childcare services for faculty and staff and provide for more availability for students. Faculty and staff will be able to reserve 3.5-hour time slots, up to 3 times a week, at a reduced cost. This program continues to be no cost at time of service for student parents. A location for this new service will be announced and program details are under development. We anticipate this program being available in late summer, pending space readiness. Contact the Family Resource Center for more details and visit the center’s website for updates on this exciting new offering.\n\nNEW! OSU’s Family Resource Center and KidSpirit will collaborate to offer a short-term reservable childcare program for school-aged children in Langton Hall. The program will offer childcare by reservation and is due to open in early September. OLV|KidSpirit will provide OSU faculty and staff short-term, hourly rate childcare that can be reserved morning or afternoon, for 3.5 hours per day Monday through Friday. For students who are parents, OLV childcare will continue be provided at no cost at time of service. For more information, please contact Kristi King, student family coordinator at [email protected].\n\nNEW! The Family Resource Center is offering a new resource to facilitate connections between families in need of childcare. In addition, this program will help parents connect with other parents, enabling the sharing of tips, resources and solutions. One of these solutions could be to share the cost of childcare. Visit the Family Resource Center website for more information.\n\nCare.com\n\nStudents at all OSU locations have free access to Care.com, which provides helpful childcare provider referrals. Additionally, students may view a parent resource guide created by Care.com to learn about finding summer childcare and to explore summertime activities and classes for kids.\n\nStudent Parent Connections\n\nConnect with other OSU student parents on Thursdays from 11 a.m. to noon through Zoom. You can ask questions of other student parents, share resources, tell the group about your success and challenges as a student parent … and more! This is a great opportunity to meet other OSU Student Parents and build community. Contact Kristi King, Student Family Coordinator at [email protected] for the Zoom link and password. Kristi is also available for one-on-one consultation through email, phone or Zoom, if you want to learn more about how the programs/services offered through the Family Resource Center can support you during your time at OSU.\n\nStudent Child Care Assistance\n\nThe Family Resource Center offers childcare assistance each term. If you are paying for childcare (center-based, family provider, babysitter/nanny), after school care, summer programming, etc., you may qualify for need-based assistance. Learn more at: https://familyresources.oregonstate.edu/student-financial-resources.\n\nFinancial Assistance:\n\nIn collaboration with the OSU Foundation, the university is offering emergency financial assistance grants through Beavers Care. This fund helps students at all OSU locations with unexpected needs during this unprecedented time. Voluntary charitable donations and contributions from donors and others enable this fund to assist OSU students facing unexpected financial challenges. The program responds to specific needs related to the pandemic, so response is not available for general financial assistance.\n\nStudents should contact their college or the Financial Aid Office for more information.\n\nAs we progress through summer, we will continue to provide updates on these services and programs.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDan Larson\n\nVice Provost for Student Affairs\n\nCoronavirus Response Coordinator\n\nOregon State University\n\nOffice of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs\n\nstudentaffairs.oregonstate.edu\n\nOffice of the Provost and Executive Vice President\n\n14 July 2020\n\nDear faculty, staff and students,\n\nI am very pleased to share that today the U.S. government rescinded proposed restrictions issued last week on international students taking online college courses while in the United States.\n\nThe new policy would have been effective for fall term, requiring international students to take at least one in-person class, even amid the pandemic. The policy threatened the education and wellness of OSU international students and hundreds of thousands of more students across the nation. Certainly, that was of great concern to all of us at OSU and caused needless stress for our nearly 3,400 international students.\n\nThis important, nationwide resolution was reached in a court case brought by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On Monday, OSU and 19 other west coast universities jointly filed a similar lawsuit in federal court in Eugene.\n\nThis resolution reinstates for now federal provisions adopted last spring that allow international students to take courses online while in the U.S. or abroad while retaining their immigration status. The willingness of the federal government to return to its March policy is heartening considering the serious harm the proposed restrictions would have had on students and many universities and colleges.\n\nOregon State University’s decision to support the needs of its international students by opposing the unfair federal restrictions in court was consistent with the mission of the university and the global economy and culture within the state of Oregon. We strongly believe that through the education of students from throughout Oregon, the nation and the world – and research, teaching and public engagement with international faculty, universities and communities – OSU advances its transformative impact as an internationally recognized 21st century university.\n\nWe will never waver in our support for our international students, faculty, staff and scholars.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdward Feser\n\nProvost and Executive Vice President\n\nOregon State University\n\nOffice of the Provost and Executive Vice President\n\n624 Kerr Administration Building, Corvallis, Oregon, 97331\n\nleadership.oregonstate.edu/provost\n\nDear faculty, staff and students,\n\nI am writing to share that today OSU – along with 19 other western United States universities – filed a lawsuit today in federal court in Eugene to keep the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from enacting proposed restrictions on international students taking online college courses while in America.\n\nIt is in keeping with Oregon State University’s mission as a global land grant university that we seek to protect the educational status of nearly 3,500 international students attending OSU. Here is a link to news release on the university’s case.\n\nThe federal government’s proposed restrictions are reckless and arbitrary, and without notice put at risk the education and wellness of thousands of international students.\n\nAs you know well, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, OSU and many U.S. universities and colleges transitioned in spring from in-person to remote instruction. At the time, the federal government provided more flexible immigration rules that allowed international students to take courses online while in the U.S. or abroad while retaining their immigration status due to the pandemic. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has announced it will issue new orders to reverse the COVID19-related flexibility provided since March.\n\nIf enacted, the federal order could unfairly force students to return to their home countries during a global pandemic and to relocate to their home countries – some of which have unstable political and public health conditions. Meanwhile, some students no longer have homes in those countries.\n\nThe federal government should not place such burdens on international students and America’s universities and colleges without notice, considerations of the impact and well-reasoned explanations, all of which he said are required by federal law.\n\nI will continue to provide updates to the university community on this matter, as new information is available.\n\nIn closing, I want to be clear: enrolling and educating international students will remain a core element of the global mission of Oregon State University. As a former international graduate student myself, I want our international students to remain focused on their studies during this difficult period and not the arbitrary threats coming out of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nEngagement of international students, researchers and educators in education and the open and interdisciplinary pursuit of research and discovery is foundational to OSU’s mission and the education of students from throughout Oregon, the nation and the world to succeed in a 21st century economy and culture.\n\nSincerely,\n\nF. King Alexander\n\nPresident\n\nOSU faculty, staff and students,\n\nUniversity telecommunications staff will perform an upgrade to the OSU Corvallis campus telephone system on Saturday, July 11, 2020, that will result in the campus telephone system being out of service from 10 to 11 a.m.\n\nOne-Hour Service Impact:\n\nDuring the outage, all campus telephones will be out of service. Any incoming calls will receive a busy signal until the system comes back up. This one hour outage will also apply to softphone programs that use web-based programs for making telephone calls.\n\nOutgoing calls will not be possible during this time.\n\nThe OSU voicemail system will be inaccessible for incoming callers and voicemail only users.\n\nUsers with integrated voicemail/e-mail accounts will be able to access and listen to any voicemails they already have in their e-mail inbox, but will not be able to listen to voicemails by phone. This interruption also will impact voice mail users located at the Hatfield Marine Science Center, OSU-Cascades and Portland locations.\n\nCorvallis building alarms, Blue Light phones, dorm entrance phones (Yellow Box), classroom phones and elevator phones will be out of service.\n\nPhone systems located at the HMSC, Bend and Portland locations will be able to make and receive calls, but will not be able to call any OSU Corvallis campus extensions.\n\nImportant Emergency Info:\n\nDuring this outage, calls to the Corvallis campus Public Safety Department will be interrupted. If you have an emergency, please call 911 using your cell phone. For all non-emergency matters, call the Corvallis campus public safety dispatcher at 541-602-0419.\n\nThroughout Saturday, July 11, OSU telecommunication staff will be performing additional upgrade activities. While no additional service interruptions are anticipated campus wide, it is possible that service to portions of campus may be affected for a short time. Updates on phone system status information on July 11 can be provided by going to: https://status.is.oregonstate.edu/.\n\nIf you find you are having any telephone service issues following the completion of Saturday’s upgrade maintenance, which is scheduled to be concluded at 7 p.m., please call 541-737-4357, or send an email to [email protected] or submit a TD ticket.\n\nThank you,\n\nSteve Fowler\n\n​​Mgr-Operations, Telecom & Data Centers\n\nUniversity Information and Technology\n\nOregon State University\n\n541-737-9630\n\nDear OSU students,\n\nAs the university proceeds to gradually increase onsite activities in the weeks ahead to support summer and fall term programs, we want to assure you we are tracking the increased prevalence of COVID-19 cases across the country, as well as localized and regional outbreaks on college and university campuses.\n\nLike you, we see disconcerting trends in states and regions that reopened quickly and, in some cases, with only limited public health measures.\n\nWe believe the public health measures we are taking at OSU to minimize student and employee density through remote work and instruction, face covering and physical distancing requirements, hygiene measures, contact tracing, and follow-up isolation and quarantine protocols will be effective as we slowly resume onsite activity.\n\nIn some cases, outbreaks observed elsewhere have been mostly contained utilizing these kinds of measures. Over the next month, we will observe how colleges and universities operating on semesters and returning to campus in early to mid-August finalize their plans. As those institutions decide whether and how to resume onsite activity, we will have the opportunity to apply their lessons learned to our own strategies.\n\nWe know that in-person engagement and activity is very important for undergraduate and graduate student learning, research and success. As such, we have a mission-centered obligation to consider every possible strategy to return to a level of onsite activity while also striving to preserve and protect the health of the OSU community.\n\nAt this time, and in consultation with county and state health authorities, we believe our plan to implement low density, mixed modality instruction and activities – facilitated by the public health measures noted above – is a sound approach. Yet, we recognize that we may need to alter our plan if the course of the virus changes in Oregon or experience elsewhere advises a different strategy. OSU’s Resumption Plan is designed to be flexible and anticipates the possible need for adjustments.\n\nAs we consider how to ramp up onsite activity, our principle guides will be indicators on the infection itself. As well, we will be guided by the readiness and capacity of the university and local counties to effectively respond to outbreaks through rapid testing of symptomatic and close contact cases, support county health authorities with contact case investigations, and isolate and contain cases.\n\nWe anticipate that by the middle of August, we will have a much better sense of the precise level of onsite instruction and activity that will be viable for fall term. However, if pandemic spikes and cases in Oregon, our neighboring states, and among many peer universities get much worse, we are prepared to act sooner regarding the precise level of onsite activity for the fall term.\n\nWe know the uncertainty this pandemic is introducing is challenging. But we believe it is critical that we continue to proceed cautiously, listen to and align with local and state public health authorities, and consider the many impacts of each decision we make.\n\nIn the coming days, we will provide you with more information on our resumption plan and associated public health measures, and we will provide regular updates through the summer. Please share your feedback and questions as we navigate this challenge by writing to [email protected].\n\nSincerely,\n\nF. King Alexander\n\nPresident\n\nEdward Feser\n\nProvost and Executive Vice President\n\nDear Corvallis students,\n\nHopefully you have settled into summer and were able to enjoy a short break after you finished spring term classes. OSU recognizes that spring term was perhaps your most challenging term and we want to thank you for your resilience, flexibility patience and dedication to your education during a pandemic.\n\nCOVID-19 has deeply affected our lives and our daily work. As we receive additional guidance from state and local health authorities, we are updating the university’s plans for to provide a safe and high quality environment for you to keep learning. This email serves as a follow up to information you received in late May about the fall schedule.\n\nRemote learning sections\n\nAs of July 1, many courses that will be taught remotely in the fall are now designated that way in the Schedule of Classes. If you wish to check your courses, your schedule will list Remote Learning in the spot where you would normally see the building/room location if the course was scheduled to be held remotely. If there a building and room location is provided at this time, that means your class is scheduled to be held on-campus or at a site location.\n\nWe expect that nearly all courses identified as Remote Learning will remain remote. Some on-campus courses may shift to Remote Learning based on the changing public health environment, so it is important to regularly check your schedule.\n\nViewing this information online\n\nIf you wish to check your schedule, log into self-service to look at the meeting location for your classes. If you wish to use the schedule of classes online, you can select a section and then scroll down to the Meeting Info to look at the classroom location or Remote Learning notice.\n\nInformation will be continually updated in the Schedule of Classes over the summer, so it is important to check back periodically.\n\nFall term campus classes\n\nWe expect that by early August classroom assignments for on-campus classes will be completed. Out of an abundance of public health caution, classroom assignments will be made with the following values:\n\nUtilize physical distancing standards that meet or exceed the Oregon Health Authority guidance.\n\nProvide for campus density that is much lower than pre-COVID-19.\n\nProvide transitions between class times to support a low density model and guide students to use specific doors for entering and exiting buildings.\n\nYour advisor is always your best point of contact for questions about your schedule and the Office of the Registrar also has significant information about classes on its website: registrar.oregonstate.edu. We encourage you to utilize resources available so that you are ready to start classes this fall.\n\nPlease enjoy your summer and be well.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRebecca Mathern\n\nAssociate Provost and University Registrar\n\nDear Oregon State University community,\n\nI am very pleased to become a member of the OSU community and am inspired to serve as the university’s 15th president.\n\nI look forward to working with each of you — and those we serve as Oregon’s statewide university — to advance the momentum and impact of this outstanding and internationally recognized land grant research institution. I pledge to listen and learn; to be accessible, transparent and accountable; and to engage as a partner.\n\nTogether, we will build on more than 150 years of faculty excellence, research scholarship and innovation, and outreach and engagement. By doing so, we will serve our mission to promote economic, cultural, social and environmental progress for the people of Oregon, the nation and the world.\n\nI recognize and thank the OSU Board of Trustees and President Emeritus Ed Ray for their outstanding and difference-making leadership of OSU.\n\nThe times we live in — and that remain ahead — are like none other. As one of our nation’s great public universities, Oregon State University and our community must commit to reforming systemic racial issues here at home and across America.\n\nAs a land grant university, we must accept that the societal, public health and economic challenges of our state, nation and world are also OSU’s challenges and responsibilities. The tools that we have within the university are powerful: teaching, research and service. They also are intergenerational and, if we act, these tools will produce lasting positive impact within the university community and beyond for those that need assistance the most.\n\nI encourage your engagement in addressing these challenges. And ask that you join me to advance OSU’s values of inclusivity and diversity — and a culture of collaboration and innovation — to provide for transformative education that is accessible and successful for all learners. However, it will be through action — not words or promises — that we will affirm that Black Lives Matter and end injustice, violence and racism across America. And create an inclusive community that provides justice, equal opportunity and lasting changes for Black, Indigenous, and people of color communities.\n\nToday, our society faces additional challenges — both old and new. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed our nation and world to how vulnerable we are to current and future health crises. It has placed on display the vast health disparities that still plague Black, Hispanic, Indigenous and other underrepresented populations. The pandemic also has exposed vast disparities and has created a recession that will intensify the great divide in economic and educational opportunities among members of our society. And this divide will only grow due to unemployment and fiscal neglect of our public educational systems.\n\nIt is our responsibility as members of the Oregon State University community to address these challenges head on through teaching, research and public service.\n\nAs I look ahead, I am very impressed by how our university community continues to work effectively and collaboratively to address the fiscal and other impacts that the pandemic is causing for OSU’s educational, research, outreach, athletics and other programs. I thank each of you for your resilience and flexibility. The behavior of the virus will dictate what lies ahead and what actions will be needed. But I am confident that as students, faculty, staff and stakeholders, we will proactively seek to address matters of health and wellness, while sustaining and advancing student success, faculty excellence, research, and outreach and public service.\n\nWe will not achieve these outcomes alone. It will require the commitment of institutions and individuals. We will continue to work with communities, partners and higher education stakeholders statewide. We also must receive greater support from state and national leaders to address the impacts of the pandemic, provide for lasting social change, support student success for all learners, and advance research innovation and public service.\n\nAs a new Oregonian and as OSU’s 15th president, I am committed to working collaboratively with you by listening, learning and addressing these challenges and opportunities together.\n\nSincerely,\n\nF. King Alexander\n\nPresident\n\nDear OSU community members,\n\nWhile I conclude my service today as OSU president, there are important actions underway, including next steps to advance diversity, equity and inclusion within Oregon State University.\n\nPresident-elect King Alexander and I agree it will take each member of the university community to achieve transformational reform, support Black Lives Matter and end systemic inequality and discrimination against the Black community and other communities of color. We ask that you join us in committing to action and persistence to provide equal opportunity and success for all faculty, staff and students.\n\nFirst, we fully support policing reform legislation adopted last week by the Oregon Legislature.\n\nAs well, OSU will utilize extensive community dialogue and engagement sessions to design future Corvallis campus public safety services and programs that are based on OSU community values and needs, and the educational mission of the university.\n\nAs a community, we will design a public safety program that includes Corvallis campus law enforcement services that provide for community oversight, accountability, transparency, ongoing community engagement and conversation, ongoing training, and a commitment to advancing inclusivity, diversity and justice, and ending bias in law enforcement. In doing so, we will change and continue to improve public safety within the university.\n\nCommunity outreach sessions to help design public safety services will be held throughout July. Meanwhile, Edgar Rodriguez, OSU’s new associate vice president of public safety, will engage personally in meetings with the Associated Students of Oregon State University, the offices of Diversity and Cultural Engagement, including the seven student cultural resource centers, Equal Opportunity Access and Institutional Diversity, the Faculty Senate, student-athletes and many other faculty, staff and student organizations.\n\nYou likely know that we sought by July 1 to transition from contracted law enforcement services provided by the Oregon State Police.\n\nMindful of the change in policing long overdue and required in America – and fully emphasized by the May 25 killing of George Floyd by police – two weeks ago we put on hold the development of OSU’s law enforcement program and related hiring of personnel until we fully engage the community in dialogue and public safety design programs. At the same time, we must continue to protect the university community and provide emergency response to reported incidents on the Corvallis campus, including matters such as robbery, sexual assault, vehicle accidents, building and vehicle break-ins, and other reports of violence against people, while providing potential law enforcement response for the OSU research nuclear reactor.\n\nTherefore, following the recommendation from Mike Green, vice president for finance and administration and the OSU public safety advisory committee – which is made up of faculty, staff and students – we will continue OSP services through Dec. 31, 2020. At that time, we will move to university-provided law enforcement services to be designed in the weeks ahead with community involvement.\n\nOn Thursday, July 2, from noon to 1 p.m., Mike Green, Edgar Rodriguez, and Paul Odenthal, senior associate vice president for administration, will hold a virtual community town hall on this public safety transition. Here is a link to that virtual community meeting: https://oregonstate.zoom.us/j/97869030477\n\nThe extension of OSP services will disappoint and concern some members of our university community and I sincerely appreciate that concern. At the same time, I ask that you trust that we are moving to address what must change and do so in a complete, transparent and caring manner that will provide long-term change while providing needed community protection.\n\nLooking ahead, we will continue to engage in collaborative conversations with communities of color to address meaningful reform in other aspects of the university, including required training for all faculty and staff; hiring more Black faculty and staff; and improving the ways we support and increase the support of Black faculty, staff and students and other faculty, staff and students of color.\n\nI know that much more is needed to advance diversity, equity and inclusion within OSU and share some of the efforts already underway.\n\nThis summer, we are launching Leading Change for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion as a core offering in OSU’s Academic Leadership Academy. This program will help prepare academic unit leaders – including deans, school directors and department heads – to effectively lead the organizational change that is needed to achieve OSU’s diversity, equity and inclusion goals. The program complements additional trainings available from the offices of Faculty Affairs, Human Resources, Student Affairs, Institutional Diversity and Equal Opportunity and Access.\n\nWe are in the final stages of hiring a director for talent acquisition in the Office of Human Resources to develop and carry out strategies for increasing diversity in hiring. Much work has already taken place to review and improve our search and selection process. For example, this year the President and Provost’s Leadership Council spent the year developing toolkits for diverse faculty and staff recruitment and retention.\n\nWithin Counseling and Psychological Services, a current counselor vacancy will be redesigned to serve as a specialist in supporting Black/African-American students.\n\nWe know that We Have Work to Do to achieve an inclusive, diverse and equitable university culture that we are proud of. An example of such action – even if a small gesture – is that we announced jointly last week with the University of Oregon that we will discontinue the use of “Civil War” in promoting athletic events between OSU and UO. Additional actions being taken and planned by the university will be shared in the week ahead.\n\nTo be fully successful in advancing this work and outcomes will take the effort and engagement of every member of OSU community. Any less is not acceptable. We must each continue to be in conversation and action as a community to advance our goals and university values. We must persist, persist, persist!\n\nI am confident that by working together, we can transform the university experiences of all students, faculty, staff, alumni, stakeholders, future members of the university community and Oregonians that we serve.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdward J. Ray\n\nPresident\n\nMembers of OSU community,\n\nI am writing to share that Oregon State University and the University of Oregon have agreed that effective immediately the term “Civil War” will no longer be used to promote any athletic competition between the universities.\n\nAs you likely know, “Civil War” has been used for football and basketball games — and other sports competition — between OSU and UO since the phrase was first referenced in the 1930’s.\n\nChanging this name is overdue as it represents a connection to a war fought to perpetuate slavery. While not intended as reference to the actual Civil War, OSU sports competition should not provide any misconstrued reference to this divisive episode in American history.\n\nIn recent years, some students, faculty, alumni, student-athletes, OSU stakeholders and community members have questioned the appropriateness of this term. That we did not act before to change the name was a mistake. We do so now, along with other important actions to advance equal opportunity and justice for all and in recognition that Black Lives Matter.\n\nPresident-elect King Alexander and I are in full agreement with this decision. So is UO President Mike Schill, OSU Vice President and Director of Athletics Scott Barnes, and UO Athletics Director Rob Mullens, as well as numerous current and past student-athletes from both universities.\n\nIn the months ahead, OSU and the University of Oregon will engage collaboratively to involve their respective students, faculty, staff, student-athletes, alumni, donors, community partners and athletics sponsors to consider other, more appropriate names, if any, to call the athletics rivalry between our two great universities.\n\nI encourage your support and engagement in this naming transition, as we work to identify other areas where our references, practices and norms do not represent our values of diversity and inclusivity.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdward J. Ray\n\nPresident\n\nDear OSU community members,\n\nI write to provide additional information about the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on June 18 in Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of California regarding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nThe decision ensures that for the time being, the DACA program will continue. In its opinion, the court found that the manner used and the rationale offered by the Department of Homeland Security in 2017 to repeal DACA was “arbitrary and capricious,” and violated federal law. However, the court did not determine whether DACA should continue permanently, leaving that question to the presidential administration and Congress. Instead, the court made a procedural decision which has the effect — for now — of keeping DACA in place. It is possible that further attempts may be made by the presidential administration to curtail or end the program.\n\nOSU President-elect King Alexander and I are in full agreement that students and employees with DACA, undocumented students, and students from mixed-immigration status families are valued and essential members of the university community. They are part of the fabric of this university. While the Supreme Court’s decision is undoubtedly a relief for them and their families, Dr. Alexander and I fully commit that the university’s work to support these OSU community members must — and will — continue.\n\nConsistent with OSU’s land grant mission, the university is committed to providing access to higher education for all residents of Oregon. And OSU will continue advocating for federal legislative action to end the uncertainty and protect DACA recipients. We will advocate for maintaining DACA in partnership with state and Oregon Congressional leaders, the President’s Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, and the Association of Public Land Grant Universities.\n\nAs we learn more about the effects of the court’s decision, information will be updated on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Undocumented Student FAQs website.\n\nOSU’s Dreaming Beyond Borders Resource Center — part of the university’s Educational Opportunities Program — at [email protected] and the Office of Human Resources at [email protected] remain available to provide guidance, support and referral to university resources for students and employees with DACA, undocumented students, and students from mixed-status families, regardless of location.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdward J. Ray\n\nPresident\n\nDepartment of Public Safety\n\nDear OSU community members,\n\nThe Department of Public Safety wants you to know that we feel the pain, the outrage and the impact of the tragic and avoidable death of George Floyd. As a country, we have witnessed too many examples of this racist behavior, and it continues today despite demands from the public for police reform.\n\nI am writing today to share my commitment and approach to community partnerships within the OSU community.\n\nAt this time, each of us bears the societal responsibility to do everything in our power to change the abhorrent reality confronting communities plagued with systemic inequality and discrimination against the Black community and other communities of color. We must rise and speak out. If not we are bystanders to prejudice, and we must commit to educating all on the importance of inclusivity and equality. We also need to actively protect those among us who are most vulnerable.\n\nWhile I am new to Oregon State University, I know that we are a university founded on comprehensive excellence for all people. I also believe we must hold one another accountable for our actions and encourage courageous conversations about the most challenging topics that arise. And I believe that our public service foundation must be built upon trust, openness and civility to truly protect and serve our unique university community.\n\nThe foundation of public safety and law enforcement in a campus setting starts with building trust through sharing of information, being fully transparent, fostering positive and personal relationships, and maintaining daily lines of communication. I assure that at OSU, public safety will be in line with the university’s values and principles.\n\nAs OSU’s public safety leader, I shall set a clear expectation for the entire department on how we move forward with community engagement. My pledge to the university community is that we will create an approach to public safety that is friendly, caring, safe and understanding. In doing so, we will help all community members know they are welcome, safe and belong here.\n\nWe will hold all Public Safety Department employees accountable by developing measurable goals that are consistent with university values and build a system to ensure greater effectiveness and accountability to the OSU community through training, discipline, and commitment to achieve results.\n\nOne of my first initiatives will be to create a Community Oriented Results and Expectation Committee (CORE). The purpose of this committee is to collaborate with OSU community members to address their issues and concerns through cooperative effort and review of community needs, and by discussing expectations and responses relative to public safety services, quality-of-life issues and community-oriented policing. In the days and weeks ahead, I will continue to share my developing concepts and plans for public safety and Corvallis campus police services, and seek and listen to input from students, faculty and staff. Before then, I want the OSU community to know that I hear your concerns regarding Black Lives Matter, racial inequality and policing nationally. Please know that I will engage you in creating public safety and community policing services that represents what is best for the university, students, faculty and staff.\n\nAs a member of the OSU community myself – and in my role leading public safety – I look forward to building a personal and trusting working relationship with our student cultural resource centers, leaders within student government and all students, faculty and staff.\n\nIn closing, I want you to know that I chose to become a police officer 30 years ago after witnessing first-hand, the mistreatment of my father by police. I made a commitment to make a positive difference and be a public servant for my community.\n\nI believed then – just as I believe now – that through transparency, accountability and collaboration with the very communities that we collectively serve, we can provide appropriate, trusted and valued community and public safety services. I remain committed to safety, diversity and inclusivity for all, and I am fully committed to help rebuild the law enforcement community across America into a noble and trusted profession.\n\nWorking together with university community members and collaborators, I am confident that we will set an exemplary standard and lead the way. Please join me in this effort and I invite you to reach out to me personally at [email protected].\n\nRespectfully,\n\nEdgar Rodriguez\n\nInterim Associate Vice President of Public Safety and Chief of Police\n\nOSU Department of Public Safety\n\nDivision of Finance and Administration\n\nOregon State University\n\n200 Cascade Hall\n\nCorvallis, OR 97333\n\nPh: 541-737-3010\n\nOSU community members,\n\nI am writing to share that the United States Supreme Court this morning released its opinion in the Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California case regarding the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nWe are strongly supportive and appreciative of the court’s opinion, which sustains DACA – an essential protection for approximately 700,000 DACA recipients nationwide, including valued members of the OSU community who are students, alumni and employee colleagues.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s ruling is greatly valued during these challenging times in America.\n\nDACA is a program created in 2012 that provides temporary protection from deportation and eligibility to work for certain young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors. In 2017, the federal government rescinded the DACA program. This rescission was challenged in court and is the subject of the Supreme Court opinion.\n\nWe are in the process of closely analyzing today’s opinion to determine its impact on OSU community members. In the coming days, we will provide additional information, resources and updates. Even then, I want to make clear that Oregon State University’s support for our DACA recipients remains strong and unwavering.\n\nAs I stated in a 2017 community message, OSU will continue to enroll and support DACA students, as well as undocumented students and students from mixed-immigration status families.\n\nOSU’s Dreaming Beyond Borders Resource Center – part of the university’s Educational Opportunities Program – at [email protected] and the Office of Human Resources at [email protected] remain available to provide guidance, support and referral to university resources.\n\nAs members of the university community, I ask each of us to be informed about this development for DACA recipients and act with understanding and compassion. Faculty, staff, students and alumni can learn more by reviewing the university’s"
