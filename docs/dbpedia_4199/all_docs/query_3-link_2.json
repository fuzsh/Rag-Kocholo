Although most sportswriters thought that Johnson had won the 15-round bout in Las Vegas, Pastrano was declared the winner by the judges in a 2 to 1 decision. \"I'm not saying that the underworld dictated the decision,\" Johnson's manager told reporters afterward, \"but the betting was 5–1 and 6–1 for my boy? What do you think?\"[1]\n\nManned Spacecraft Center (MSC) announced two space station study contracts to compare concepts for a 24-person orbital laboratory: one with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and another with Douglas Aircraft Company, Inc., Missiles and Space Systems Division.

They thought that the Mercury spacecraft was capable of much longer missions and that much could be learned about the effects of space environment from a mission lasting several days, to be applied to the forthcoming Gemini and Apollo projects. NASA continued to reject the proposed Mercury 10 mission.[29]\n\nA spokesman for General Dynamics Corporation told scientists in Denver that a crewed space mission to the planet Mars could be launched in 1975. Andrew Kalitinsky was a speaker at a two-day symposium by the American Astronautical Society, called \"The Exploration of Mars\", and envisioned that \"a convoy of four multi-ton spaceships\" would make the journey. The day before, NASA announced plans to send two satellites to Mars in November 1964 as the first step toward a mission.[30]\n\nChairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China Communist Party sent a letter to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, stating that \"The Chinese people will never accept the privileged position of one or two superpowers\" with a monopoly on nuclear weapons, and then gave the go ahead for China to accelerate its own nuclear program.
