        "text": "Six-Day War\n\nMiddle East [1967]\n\nTop Questions\n\nWhat was the Six-Day War about?\n\nThe Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbours was not about one particular concern or dispute. The war occurred, rather, after a series of events escalated tensions. After a number of smaller military strikes between the countries, Soviet intelligence reports heightened tensions by claiming that Israel was planning a military campaign against Syria. As Egypt began to ready itself for war, Israel launched a preemptive strike against Egypt and Syria, marking the beginning of the Six-Day War between Israel and an Egypt-Syria-Jordan alliance.\n\npreemptive forceLearn more about the purpose, strategy, and philosophy behind the use of preemptive strikes.\n\nWhere was the Six-Day War fought?\n\nThe Six-Day War began with a preemptive Israeli air assault in Egypt and Syria. An Israeli ground offensive was also launched in the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank. These territories were all captured by Israel, though the Sinai Peninsula was later returned to Egypt.\n\nWhat was the significance of the Six-Day War?\n\nAt a time when Arab forces posed a significant threat to Israel’s security, Israel’s preemption in the Six-Day War dealt a decisive blow to their ability to carry out threats, especially by incapacitating Egypt’s air force. Israel also captured territory held by Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, none of which was recaptured by military means. Calls by the United Nations (see United Nations Resolution 242) to return these territories in exchange for lasting peace laid the foundation for the “land for peace” formula underlying the Camp David Accords peace treaty between Israel and Egypt as well as the proposed two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\ntwo-state solutionRead more about the two-state solution.\n\nHow did the Six-Day War start?\n\nThe Six-Day War occurred at a time of heightened tension between Israel and its neighbouring Arab countries. After a series of back-and-forth military strikes, it was spurred on further by Soviet intelligence reports that indicated Israel was planning a military campaign against Syria. Egyptian Pres. Gamal Abdel Nasser ramped up rhetoric against Israel and mobilized Egyptian forces in preparation for war. The war began on June 5, 1967, when Israel launched a preemptive assault against the Egyptian and Syrian air forces.\n\nWhy was the Six-Day War a turning point?\n\nThe Six-Day War ended with Israel capturing the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Of these, only the Sinai Peninsula was returned, per the Israel-Egypt Camp David Accords peace treaty, while the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem were formally annexed by Israel. Meanwhile, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were placed under Israeli military occupation, while the Palestinians sought to establish an independent Palestinian state in those territories, and the political status of Jerusalem remained a highly contentious issue into the 21st century.\n\nCamp David AccordsLearn more about the Camp David Accords, a treaty between Israel and Egypt in which Israel returned Egyptian territory that had been captured in the Six-Day War in exchange for lasting peace.\n\nSix-Day War, brief war that took place June 5–10, 1967, and was the third of the Arab-Israeli wars. Israel’s decisive victory included the capture of the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank, Old City of Jerusalem, and Golan Heights; the status of these territories subsequently became a major point of contention in the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nBackground and escalation\n\nPrior to the start of the war, attacks conducted against Israel by fledgling Palestinian guerrilla groups based in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan had increased, leading to costly Israeli reprisals. In November 1966 an Israeli strike on the village of Al-Samūʿ in the Jordanian West Bank left 18 dead and 54 wounded, and, during an air battle with Syria in April 1967, the Israeli Air Force shot down six Syrian MiG fighter jets. In addition, Soviet intelligence reports in May indicated that Israel was planning a campaign against Syria, and, although inaccurate, the information further heightened tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbours.\n\nEgyptian Pres. Gamal Abdel Nasser had previously come under sharp criticism for his failure to aid Syria and Jordan against Israel; he had also been accused of hiding behind the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) stationed at Egypt’s border with Israel in the Sinai. Now, however, he moved to unambiguously demonstrate support for Syria: on May 14, 1967, Nasser mobilized Egyptian forces in the Sinai; on May 18 he formally requested the removal of the UNEF stationed there; and on May 22 he closed the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli shipping, thus instituting an effective blockade of the port city of Elat in southern Israel. On May 30, King Hussein of Jordan arrived in Cairo to sign a mutual defense pact with Egypt, placing Jordanian forces under Egyptian command; shortly thereafter, Iraq too joined the alliance.\n\nMain events of the war\n\nIn response to the apparent mobilization of its Arab neighbours, early on the morning of June 5, Israel staged a sudden preemptive air assault that destroyed more than 90 percent Egypt’s air force on the tarmac. A similar air assault incapacitated the Syrian air force. Without cover from the air, the Egyptian army was left vulnerable to attack. Within three days the Israelis had achieved an overwhelming victory on the ground, capturing the Gaza Strip and all of the Sinai Peninsula up to the east bank of the Suez Canal.\n\nAn eastern front was also opened on June 5 when Jordanian forces began shelling West Jerusalem—disregarding Israel’s warning to King Hussein to keep Jordan out of the fight—only to face a crushing Israeli counterattack. On June 7 Israeli forces drove Jordanian forces out of East Jerusalem and most of the West Bank. Photos and films of Israeli troops taking control of the Old City of Jerusalem have proved to be some of the war’s iconic images.\n\nThe UN Security Council called for a cease-fire on June 7 that was immediately accepted by Israel and Jordan. Egypt accepted the following day. Syria held out, however, and continued to shell villages in northern Israel. On June 9 Israel launched an assault on the fortified Golan Heights, capturing it from Syrian forces after a day of heavy fighting. Syria accepted the cease-fire on June 10.\n\nAftermath and legacy\n\nThe Arab countries’ losses in the conflict were disastrous. Egypt’s casualties numbered more than 11,000, with 6,000 for Jordan and 1,000 for Syria, compared with only 700 for Israel. The Arab armies also suffered crippling losses of weaponry and equipment. The lopsidedness of the defeat demoralized both the Arab public and the political elite. Nasser announced his resignation on June 9 but quickly yielded to mass demonstrations calling for him to remain in office. In Israel, which had proved beyond question that it was the region’s preeminent military power, there was euphoria.\n\nThe Six-Day War also marked the start of a new phase in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, since the conflict created hundreds of thousands of refugees and brought more than one million Palestinians in the occupied territories under Israeli rule. Months after the war, in November, the United Nations passed UN Resolution 242, which called for Israel’s withdrawal from the territories it had captured in the war in exchange for lasting peace. That resolution became the basis for diplomatic efforts between Israel and its neighbours, including the Camp David Accords with Egypt and the push for a two-state solution with the Palestinians.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Adam Augustyn."
