        "text": "The life of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was so shadowy, with such an overlay of myth and rumor, that there was lingering disagreement or uncertainty about his ancestry, his true name and his date of birth.\n\nBut when he returned in triumph to Teheran on Feb. 1, 1979, after almost 15 years in exile, the imposing man in a black robe with a white beard and intense dark eyes left little doubt about who he was, or what he wanted for his ancient land.\n\nAyatollah Khomeini felt a holy mission to rid Iran of what he saw as Western corruption and degeneracy and to return the country, under an Islamic theocracy, to religious purity.\n\nThe Islamic Shiite leader's fervor helped drive Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi from the Peacock Throne on Jan. 15, 1979, and into foreign exile. The Shah's eventual arrival in the United States for cancer treatment was the spark that set off the American hostage crisis of 1979-81. Hostility for the West\n\nUnder the Ayatollah, Iran was wrenched backward from widespread economic development and social change and onto a path that was broadly hostile to the Western world.\n\nThe Ayatollah's path also led to eight years of grisly, costly, inconclusive war between Iran and its Arab neighbor, Iraq. He demanded that his country fight unrelentingly after Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980, but he eventually accepted a truce in 1988.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
