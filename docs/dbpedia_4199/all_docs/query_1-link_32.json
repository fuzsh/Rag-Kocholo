With him were his wife, a 53-year-old former hairdresser, their son Mohammed, six, their daughter Halima, her fiancé, their butler and two maids. Subsequently an unnamed senior air force official recounted the final moments of the president and his wife on Tunisian soil. As Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali refused to board the plane his wife words were reported as: \"Get on imbecile. All my life I've had to put up with your screw-ups.\" According to the eye-witness account Ben Ali stood on the tarmac in Tunis airport with a small briefcase, wringing his hands and saying: \"Leave me, I don't want to go, I want to die here for my country.\" At his wife's side was Ali Seriati, the president's hated political police chief, who pushed him on to the steps, shouting: \"For —-'s sake, get on!\"\n\nMohammed Ghannouchi, the 69-years-old Tunisian prime minister (since 1999) and a close ally of Ben Ali, cites chapter 56 of the Tunisian constitution and becomes the interim president. Chapter 56 of the Tunisian constitution, under which Ghannouchi took power, reads: \"In the event the president of the republic is incapable of discharging his duties temporarily, he may order for his powers and authorities be delegated to the first minister, save the right of dissolving the parliament. During this period of temporary incapacity, the government shall remain standing until such state of incapacity is eliminated, even if the government is chastised.

On this basis of this and of its support for action that aids the wellbeing of the Tunisian people, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia welcomed President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali and his family to the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia while also announcing its full backing for the people of Tunisia, hopes for greater cooperation between Tunisians so they can surmount this difficult phase in their history.‖\n\nSecurity vacuum left by the departure of Ben Ali is exploited by looters and violent gangs.\n\nJanuary 16, 2011\n\nTunisia – Tension and uncertainty grip Tunisia as military forces attempt to restore order.\n\nWikiLeaks releases a four-part series of US diplomatic cables that shows the United States knew about the extent of corruption and discontent in Tunisia and chose to support Ben Ali regardless.\n\nBen Ali holds telephone conversation with Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nLibya - Muammar Gaddafi and Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak discuss the Tunisian political situation on the telephone.\n\nMuammar Gaddafi deplores developments in Tunisia. In a televised address beamed to Tunisia he states that Tunisian people have suffered a great and irreparable loss, shedding blood and pushing their country into turmoil. He criticized the media campaign following the riots, and said the reported cases of corruption and other vices in the government were unfounded. He wondered why the media would be reporting such vices in a country like Tunisia, where resources are limited, instead of focussing attention on countries where billions were looted and sold to the West and the East. The Libyan leader condemned the leaking of official documents, including incitement to hatred, by Wikileaks and various other websites. He said that ―these leaks are aimed at destabilizing the region and plunging it into disorder and social unrest under agendas established by foreign intelligence services.‖\n\nAlgeria - Civil protection officer attempts self-immolation in the town of Oum El Bouaghi in eastern Algeria.\n\nJanuary 17, 2011\n\nAlternative Politics, Vol.3, No.3, 256-419, November 2011 264\n\nTunisia - Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi appoints opposition figures to a new coalition government, aiming to establish political stability after protests.\n\nSudanese foreign ministry issues a statement: ―the government of Sudan welcomes the choice of the people of Tunisia to determine the political future of their country‖.\n\nMorocco - Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation issues a statement: ―The Kingdom of Morocco, which has followed with great concern the major events and dramas that have occurred in recent days in sisterly Tunisia, expresses deep and sincere feelings of solidarity with the people of Tunisia as a whole, in this delicate and crucial period in its history.‖\n\nEgypt - Abdouh Abdel Moneim – age 48, sets himself on fire outside Egyptian parliament. An interior ministry source said the man was the owner of a small restaurant and was protesting about his poor living standards. Self-immolation as a method of protest is uncommon in the Arab world, where many associate it with protesters in the Far East or the Indian subcontinent.

He described himself as a \"simple citizen who is claiming legitimate rights\". Ould Dahoud's online declaration called for \"the release of rights activists who are fighting against slavery from civil prison\" and demanded lower prices for rice, wheat, oils, sugar and milk. He also called for election oversight and a constitutional amendment banning current and former military figures from seeking the presidency. \"Isn't it yet time for the Mauritanian people to freely and seriously choose who to govern them and manage the wealth that suffices them, away from handouts of foreign sabotage governments?\" Ould Dahoud asked.\n\nAlgeria - In Algeria, a man named Senouci Touat doused himself in gasoline and set himself on fire in the city of Mostaganem, 350 km west of the capital Algiers.\n\n265 Bogdan Szajkowski\n\nJanuary 19, 2011\n\nArab League - Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa warns Arab leaders gathered at economic summit in Sharm El-Sheikh that the hardships of ordinary Tunisians that sparked a popular uprising were linked to \"unprecedented anger\" in the region.

Police fired on demonstrators, injuring four, and detained 22 others in heavy clashes.\n\nTawakul Karman a prominent female human rights activist is arrested in the middle of the night in Sana‘a and accused of organising the anti-government protests.

It was the first demonstration to directly confront the rule of Yemen's president, something that had been a red line few dissenters dared to challenge. The demonstrators clearly drew inspiration from the recent ouster of Tunisia's long-time leader, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. \"Oh, Ali, join your friend Ben Ali,\" the crowds chanted. Police fired tear gas at the demonstrators, whose grievances include proposed constitutional changes that would allow the president to rule for two additional terms of ten years. Saleh's current term in office expires in 2013.\n\nIn the evening Yemeni television broadcasts President Ali Abdullah Saleh delivered early to military officers. Saleh announces the raise of salaries for those serving in the army apparently in an attempt to ensure the army's loyalty in the face of the rising challenges. He denies claims by his opponents that he plans to install his son, Ahmed, who commands the Republican Guard and special forces, as his successor. \"We are against succession. We are in favor of change ...and these are rude statements, they are the utmost rudeness.\"After the Tunisian turmoil, Saleh also ordered income taxes slashed in half and instructed his government to control prices. He also deployed anti-riot police and soldiers to several key areas in the capital, Sana‘a, and its surroundings to prevent riots.\n\nThe \"Caravan of Liberation\" protest of thousands reaches Tunis.\n\nJanuary 24, 2011\n\n267 Bogdan Szajkowski\n\nTunisia - Tunisian Army Chief of Staff Rachid Ammar an impromptu speech to hundreds of demonstrators who gathered near the Prime Minister‘s Office in Tunis.

The void brings terror, which brings dictatorship... The national army is the guarantor of the Revolution. The army has protected and will protect the people and country...

We protect the Constitution.\"\n\nPolice fired tear gas after protesters surged through a security picket and into the compound of Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi.

Troops had opened fire on protesters because they were not trained to handle civil unrest, he argues. He warns that if the protesters continued, the European and American fleets would invade to protect the oil, and the Libyan people would be living under an occupation.
