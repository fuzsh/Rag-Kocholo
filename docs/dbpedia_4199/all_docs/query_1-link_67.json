        "text": "Massive protests calling for freedom and regime change have spread across Syria since first erupting in the southern governorate of Deraa on March 15. The movement has gained momentum in spite a persistent and brutal military crackdown.\n\nSyrian security forces and pro-government armed men have continued their repressive measures despite the abolition of the 48-year-old emergency law and a pledge by Bashar al-Assad, the president, to implement major reforms.\n\nMore than 1,300 civilians have been killed and many more wounded throughout the country. At least 10,000 people, including many women and children, have also been imprisoned – and in many cases tortured – for protesting.\n\nThe Syrian government has blamed an “armed resurrection” by Salafi militant groups for the deaths of civilians, but raw video footage reveals a whole different story.\n\nSyria has been subjected to emergency law since 1963 – the year Hafez al-Assad, the father of the current president, took power after leading a military coup.\n\nInternational organisations have described the human rights status in Syria as being one of the worst in the world, with security forces having a long history of harassing and imprisoning rights activists and critics of the government. Protesters are also calling for the release of thousands of political prisoners and dissidents.\n\nDemonstrators have also lashed out at rampant corruption in the Syrian government. Among the many officials accused of being “thieves” – Rami Makhlouf, the first cousin of Bashar al-Assad and arguably the most powerful economic figure and businessman in Syria, reportedly controls as much as 60 per cent of the country’s economy through an intricate web of holding companies.\n\nSyria has banned nearly all foreign media and restricted access to troubled areas since the uprising began, making it almost impossible to get independent assessments.\n\nDefying restrictions and risking detainment, many ordinary Syrian citizens have taken it upon themselves to record and post videos of the protests online.\n\nHere are some of the videos either displayed or linked to highlighted words. Check back later for updates.\n\nSince I could not fit all the videos in one page, I created separate pages for older videos:\n\n— PAGE TWO —\n\n— PAGE THREE —\n\nA compilation of videos showing protesters tear down posters and destroy statues of Bashar al-Assad and Hafez al-Assad across Syria since demonstrations first erupted in March.\n\nA newly defected lieutenant colonel of the Syrian army says he has joined the uprising and condemns the Syrian government for ordering the “mass killings of women, children and elders across Syria”.\n\nA defected Syrian soldier accuses the army of deliberately ordering the murders of civilians protesting. Al Jazeera has verified the veracity of this video’s source.\n\nJune 9\n\nSecurity forces beat handcuffed protesters in Homs. A troop accuses the demonstrators of conspiring with Israel, which has been a common occurence during the uprising.\n\nVideo shows a group of handcuffed protesters are beaten and tortured by troops in Deraa.\n\nJune 8\n\nA huge convoy of tanks heads for Homs.\n\nJune 7\n\nVideo shows a young boy tortured by Syrian authorities.\n\nJune 6\n\nA young boy is allegedly shot dead by security forces the town of Jisr al-Shaghour.\n\nJune 4\n\nVideo shows security forces apparently fabricating evidence of an insurrection by placing ammunitions on dead civilians in Deraa.\n\nThey shout obscenities and call those killed “dead pigs and dogs”.\n\nJune 2\n\nSchool students protest in Homs after they took final exams.\n\nJune 1\n\nSyrian opposition leaders and members attending a conference in Antalya Turkey stand up and swear an oath that they will support the uprising in Syria “until the people become free”.\n\nMay 31\n\nWomen demonstrate in Kafranbel in solidarity with the besieged Homs town of al-Rastan, where security forces killed 41 people, including a four-year-old girl on Tuesday. The protesters hold up a sign addressed to the US that says: “You lived September 11 one time, but we live it every day.\n\nMay 30\n\nA defected security officer in Hama joins the revolution.\n\nMay 29\n\nSecurity forces and Shabiha thugs fired live bullets on a bus containing 13 students from Rawafed school in Talbiseh, Homs, injuring all of them including four critically injured. 10-year-old boy Hajar Khatib was killed.

This was corroborated by testimonies from two family members who spoke to Insan, a Syrian human rights group.\n\nBut the secret police broke into Izraa hospital and arrested Murshed, according to the same sources. His body was returned to his family on Tuesday.\n\nLike 13-year-old Hamza al-Khateeb, Murshed’s neck was also broken, as was his nose, according to those who examined him, while his face, neck and flank show black burn marks and lacerations, as do the soles of his feet, consistent with being tortured with electric shock devices. A gaping gunshot wound is visible in his side.\n\n“Watch it clearly Arabs and Muslims,” says the voice on the video. “We are not asking Europe or America for help. We want you, brothers of our land, Muslims, with merciful souls to be terrified for us and support us. They are killing us, we are starving, we are under a siege.”\n\nVideo below shows Murshed’s body.\n\nMay 25\n\nVideo shows a massacre in Deraa.\n\nMay 24\n\nSecurity forces set fire to motorcycles owned by civilians in Deraa amid a military siege of the city.\n\nMay 23\n\nVideo shows women and children protesting in the Damascus suburb of Moadmiyyah.\n\nVideo below students from a Baath University – run by the Syrian regime – in Homs reportedly staged a protest on Monday in solidarity against the government’s violent crackdown on demonstrators across the country.\n\nCitizen video below claims to show the students holding up placards calling for freedom, before some tear apart their university identity cards in front of the camera. At the end, they chant: “No education until the government is toppled”.\n\nMay 22\n\nVideo reportedly shows a man who was killed by security forces in Deraa for trying to smuggle food into the besieged city is called a “pig” by a soldier.\n\nSecurity forces severely beat a protester.\n\nMay 20\n\nScores of people have been killed as security forces tried to crush ant-government protests across the country on Friday.\n\nHoms\n\nSecret police killed at least nine people including Aiham al-Ahmad, an 11-year-old boy, and Ahmad Bakr, a 16-year-old, in an armed crackdown on protestors today, according to three separate eye witnesses who spoke to al-Jazeera.\n\n“The four secret police officers opened fire on the protesters with machine guns,” said the eyewitnesses.\n\nIn a separate incident, three residents were killed when secret police attempted to storm the hospital in Homs’ al-Wa’r neighbourhood, according to a third eyewitness. Locals responded by forming a human chain around the hospital trying to prevent the secret police arresting wounded protestors inside, as they have done in past such attacks.\n\nThe eyewitness said some locals had shot at the secret police using personal handguns, the first such armed clashes between security and citizens in Homs al-Jazeera has been able to verify since the uprising in Syria began over two months ago.\n\nVideo below shows security forces open fire on mourners carrying out a funeral in Homs.\n\nAnother video shows bodies of those killed during the funeral.\n\nA third video of funeral shows cars abandoned and some on fire in the street after troops attacked.\n\nAt the same funeral, civilians were shot at while trying to cross the street.\n\nThousands of protesters march in Homs.\n\nProtesters in Baba Amr district in Homs include Christians and Muslims holding up crosses and crescents in a show of solidarity after security forces attacked civilian areas there.\n\nVideo shows protesters in Homs chant: Homs wants freedom for Muslims and Christians.\n\nA demonstration during Friday prayers in al-Rastan, Homs.\n\nDamascus\n\nIn the Old City of Damascus, pro-regime thugs with iron bars have attacked a group of 500 to 700 worshippers as they left the Dahabiyye Mosque in Bab Sriejeh after Friday prayers, an eyewitness told al-Jazeera.\n\nIn Midan, a conservative Sunni neighbourhood of Damascus, a demonstration by Abu Ayoub al-Ansari Mosque had barely begun before security forces fired tear gas on around 1,000 protesters, an eyewitness told al-Jazeera.\n\nSecurity forces opened fire on protesters in Berze, a suburb north-east of Damascus, this afternoon, killing four protesters and wounding tens, an eyewitness told al-Jazeera.\n\nAfter the killing, security forces began detaining people, he said. “So people are afraid to go home for fear of being arrested.”\n\nProtesters hold up a giant flag in the Qitna district in Damascus.\n\nA large demonstration in the Hajar al-Aswad in Golan.\n\nSyrian Kurds\n\nIn Qamishli around 3,000 protesters took to the streets calling for toppling the regime, a call that was echoed across the north.

There were hundreds of Assyrians with us and now the security men are arresting leaders from the Democratic Assyrian Organization,” said a Kurdish leader in Qamishli.\n\n“The regime is so afraid to see that Muslim Arabs and Kurds and Christians are demonstrating together against the regime.
