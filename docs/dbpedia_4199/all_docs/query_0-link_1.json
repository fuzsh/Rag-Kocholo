        "text": "Archives belonging to the library of the Berkeley-based Iranian Students Association of Northern California (ISANC) reflect Iranian and Bay Area histories during the critical years between the CIA coup in Iran on 19 August 1953 and the aftermath of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. ISANC began its activities in 1964 as a member of the Iranian Students Association in the United States (ISAUS), which had joined forces with the Confederation of Iranian Students Association (CIS) in Europe in 1962; the resulting CISNU (National Union), an international, non-governmental, and politically autonomous organization consisted of various Iranian opposition groups sympathetic to the struggle for democracy in Iran.\n\nIn the ’60s and ’70s, Iranian students abroad joined the anti-imperialist, anti-colonial, anti-racist, and anti-war struggles going on around them in increasing numbers, voicing their opposition to Cold War-era US foreign policies and exposing the brutal suppression of political dissent in Iran through demonstrations, campaigns, hunger strikes, and sit-ins; these actions resulted in their being targeted by local police, the Department of State, the Department of Justice, Congress, the Immigration and Naturalization Service Department, and the Sāzemān-e Ettelā’āt va Amniyat-e Keshvar, or SAVAK (the Organization of Intelligence and National Security). The students also published feverishly, sustaining a critique that linked racial oppression in the US to imperial domination abroad and integrated opposition in the Middle East to broader resistance movements; they hoped that “public knowledge of widespread opposition might call into question the nature of American involvement in the Middle East and set the stage for widespread public protest similar to the movement against the war in Vietnam.”\n\nImmersed in the political climate of its era, influenced by the global liberation movements of its time, and directly involved with the many national and local freedom struggles in the Bay Area, the ISANC demonstrated solidarity with the Student for Democratic Society (SDS), the Black Panther Party, the Palestinian Liberation popular Front (PLFP), the Revolutionary Community Party (RCP), the Progressive Labor Party (PLP), as well as the Filipino, Ethiopian, and Arab student associations. The organization came to a halt following the Iranian Revolution and the systematic arrests and executions of many ISA members who had returned to Iran to participate in the uprisings. In 1982, ISANC closed its Berkeley-based “House of Iran” and discontinued its many publications.\n\nBelow is a timeline documenting the history of ISANC against a backdrop of global conflicts and struggles.\n\n• Events • Monarchy • National Front • Islamic Groups • Dissent • Confederation of Iranian Students • Britain • US\n\n­1941 •August Allied powers, including the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union, invade and occupy Iran. •The Allies force Reza Shah to abdicate in favor of his son. •October Tudeh Party of Iran is established.\n\n1942 •Central Union of Worker’s Council is established; dominated by the Tudeh Party. 1944 •August 8 The Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement is signed, dividing Middle Eastern oil between the US and Britain. 1945 •April 12 Harry Truman becomes US President. •May Day Several thousand Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) employees demonstrate for better housing, benefits, and higher wages. •Partial accommodations and additional payments are recommended by the British government. •People demand revising AIOC concession terms. 1946 •Major strikes cripple AIOC operations. •July Tudeh Party leads national strike of oil workers. 1947 •Dr. Mohammad Mosadeq is re-elected to the Majles (Parliament). •AIOC reports £40 million in profits; Iran gets £7 million. •Very bad working conditions for AIOC oil workers are reported by Iran’s Petroleum Institute. 1948 •June Several days of violent protests in Tehran and Qom, organized by Mullah Kashani. •First large-scale split of the Tudeh Party. 1949 •May Britain offers a “Supplemental Oil Agreement” to appease unrest in the country. •February 4 An attempt is made on Shah’s life by the Fadaaian e Islam; the Tudeh party is suspect. •The Tudeh party is officially outlawed.
