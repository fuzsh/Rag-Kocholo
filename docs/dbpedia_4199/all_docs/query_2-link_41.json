Despite nearly every metric supporting that outcome, a few waves of clouds and showers during the morning and early afternoon ultimately sapped much of the energy out of the atmosphere, and the few periods of sunshine weren’t nearly long enough to re-destabilize the atmosphere. While some of the storms that did arrive produced some severe weather, most of Ohio was spared. A few tornadoes, however, did manage to be produced. The only one in Ohio within the Columbus Metro Area occurred in Licking County.

Here, the tornado damaged some homes causing some roof damage. The tornado quickly strengthened further, and affected a number of homes along Evans Road as it crossed Highway 739, and then continued southeast to areas just north of Broadway. Across portions of that corridor, damage consistent with wind speeds from 115-125 mph were noted. One modular home was completely destroyed with contents thrown downstream nearly a half mile, and another home lost a majority of its roof with exterior wall collapse.\n\nSignificant tree damage was observed near Broadway, including in a cemetery just to the east of Broadway. As the tornado passed Broadway and continued southeast across Highway 31 and State Route 4, a number of additional homes and barns were impacted, with roof damage being common. Tree damage along the entire length of the tornado was considerable, trunk snapping and uprooting. The tornado crossed into Delaware County as an EF1 tornado, producing\n\nadditional damage as it moved east to Marysville Road.\n\nThe second- and longest-tracked tornado in the metro area- touched down shortly after Delaware County was issued a tornado warning at 8:51PM.\n\nTornado #2\n\nBULLETIN – EAS ACTIVATION REQUESTED\n\nTornado Warning\n\nNational Weather Service Wilmington OH\n\n851 PM EDT Thu Mar 14 2024\n\nThe National Weather Service in Wilmington has issued a\n\n* Tornado Warning for…\n\nDelaware County in central Ohio…\n\n* Until 945 PM EDT.\n\n* At 850 PM EDT, a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado was located near Ostrander, moving east at 40 mph.\n\nHAZARD…Tornado and half dollar size hail.\n\nSOURCE…Radar indicated rotation.\n\nIMPACT…Flying debris will be dangerous to those caught without shelter.

As the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 23, the tornado strengthened and widened, and began causing more structural damage as it crossed the Olentangy River, and then especially so as it moved along Berlin Station Road and other areas of Berlin Township. Along this portion of the track, a number of homes sustained siding and roof damage, and numerous tree snaps and uproots were seen. Several barns were also destroyed. In vicinity of Olentangy Berlin High School, parts of the school campus and\n\nathletic fields were damaged, signs were bent over, and several free-standing transmission towers were felled. Among all of the damage indicators in this area, wind speeds around 110 mph were estimated as the maximum wind speed.\n\nThe tornado crossed Alum Creek Reservoir and moved into neighborhoods southwest of Sunbury and west of Galena, continuing to cause widespread and significant tree damage, along with a large number of homes having windows blown out, partial roof removal, and power poles snapped. Damage in these areas was consistent with wind speeds from 95 to 105 mph.\n\nAs the tornado moved through the Galena area, there was a complex mix of straight-line wind damage through southern parts of the town of Galena, with tornadic damage embedded across the north side of Galena. The damage field through this area is notably wide.\n\nAs the tornado crossed into Licking County, the damage path remains quite wide and likely a complex mix of straight-line winds on the immediate southern flank of the tornadic circulation. However, the damage is very consistent with wind speeds ranging from 90-100 mph across most of Licking County. Along this entire stretch of the damage path, the damage is a combination of partial roof removal on some homes, barns being completely destroyed or\n\nheavily damaged, widespread tree uproots and snapped trunks, and power poles snapped.\n\nThe tornado dissipated between Highway 13 and Horns Hills Road south of St. Louisville.\n\nWednesday, February 28, 2024\n\nAlmost a year to the day after a small tornadic event in Central Ohio, another very rare winter outbreak occurred, this time much larger. A low pressure system and very strong cold front brought warm, unstable air into Ohio during the 27th and the early part of the day on the 28th. A Tornado Watch was issued at 4:40AM on the 28th, less than 1 hour before the tornadic storms entered the Columbus area.\n\nThe first tornado, an EF1 with 100MPH winds, would take a 2.4 mile path through Montgomery and Greene counties. It would be spawned at 4:37AM, just before the watch was issued. It would form from a rotating cell that would ultimately be responsible for 9 tornadoes in the state, 7 within the Columbus Metro itself, all on a consistent west-to-east-path across Madison, Franklin and Licking counties. The following information for each tornado includes the tornado warning texts, radar images at the time of warning and National Weather Service storm surveys.\n\nTornado #1\n\nBULLETIN – EAS ACTIVATION REQUESTED\n\nTornado Warning\n\nNational Weather Service Wilmington OH\n\n454 AM EST Wed Feb 28 2024\n\nThe National Weather Service in Wilmington has issued a\n\n* Tornado Warning for…\n\nSoutheastern Clark County in west central Ohio…\n\nNortheastern Greene County in west central Ohio…\n\nSouthwestern Madison County in central Ohio…\n\n* Until 530 AM EST.\n\n* At 454 AM EST, a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado was located near Springfield, moving east at 45 mph.\n\nHAZARD…Tornado.\n\nSOURCE…Radar indicated rotation.\n\nIMPACT…Flying debris will be dangerous to those caught without shelter.

The tornado then strengthened and broadened as it moved east northeast eventually reaching EF2 intensity along Ridge Rd near Highway 41 where three homes had complete roof loss. After this, there was intermittent EF1 and EF2 damage consisting of around a dozen barns and outbuildings destroyed and more homes with complete roof loss. The tornado then continued for around 10 miles to the east northeast continuing into Madison county. The survey team was\n\nunable to complete the survey north of London as roads were still impassable so some extension of the track is still possible.\n\nOne note about the path width of this tornado. In a couple areas, including along Hwy 41 near the Rose Hill Cemetery, the total damage path was more than a half mile wide, however, the maximum width of the tornado circulation was estimated to be around 500 yards wide.

While initially beginning with minor tree and structural damage, including a tipped over trailer, the tornado increased intensity as it crossed Spring Valley Road and then across Glade Run Road, peaking in intensity as it crossed Wilson Road. At this location, a home lost part of its roof, and tree damage was considerable with snapped off trunks. Damage in this area was consistent with wind speeds around 110 mph. The tornado continued across West Jefferson-Klousville Road where it shifted more abruptly northeast and weakened as it crossed Olmstead Road and dissipated.\n\nTornado #3\n\nBoth the tornado warning and radar image for Tornado #2 are also relevant for this tornado and tornadoes #4 and #5, as these events occurred only a few minutes after issuance.\n\n…NWS DAMAGE SURVEY FOR 02/28/2024 TORNADO EVENT…\n\n…Franklin County Tornado…\n\nStart Location…3 SW Hilliard in Franklin County OH\n\nEnd Location…2 SSE Hilliard in Franklin County OH\n\nDate…02/28/2024\n\nEstimated Start Time…05:26 AM EST\n\nEstimated End Time…05:29 AM EST\n\nMaximum EF-Scale Rating…EF1\n\nEstimated Maximum Wind Speed…110 mph\n\nMaximum Path Width…200.0 yards\n\nPath Length…2.3802 miles\n\nBeginning Lat/Lon…40.005 / -83.1844\n\nEnding Lat/Lon…40.0067 / -83.1396\n\n* Fatalities…0\n\n* Injuries…0\n\n…Summary…\n\nWith considerable assistance from Franklin County EMA, the National Weather Service in Wilmington completed a damage survey from severe storms which occurred during the early morning of Wednesday, February 28th.\n\nThe survey revealed that a weak tornado developed on the west side of Alton and Darby Creek Road and moved along the north side of Roberts Road through portions of the city of Hilliard. Along the path, damage was a consistent mix of snapped trees, uprooted trees, numerous instances of minor roof and siding damage. One home on Hilliard Rome Road lost part of its roof, and another home near Westbreeze Drive had an attached garage peeled away and shifted. Damage in this area was consistent with wind speeds of around 110 mph. The tornado weakened as it approached Interstate 270 and dissipated on the west side of the Interstate.\n\nTornado #4\n\n…NWS DAMAGE SURVEY FOR 02/28/2024 TORNADO EVENT…\n\n…EF0 Confirmed near Darbydale OH…\n\nStart Location…2 W Darbydale in Franklin County OH\n\nEnd Location…..2 W Darbydale in Franklin County OH\n\nDate………………………02/28/2024\n\nEstimated Start Time………..05:28 AM EST\n\nEstimated End Time………….05:29 AM EST\n\nMaximum EF-Scale Rating……..EF0\n\nEstimated Maximum Wind Speed…70 mph\n\nMaximum Path Width………….60 yards\n\nPath Length………………..0.5 miles\n\nBeginning Lat/Lon…………..39.8497 / -83.2246\n\nEnding Lat/Lon……………..39.8505 / -83.2150\n\n* Fatalities…0\n\n* Injuries…..0\n\n…Summary…\n\nThe National Weather Service has confirmed an EF0 tornado west of Darbydale in Franklin County, Ohio.\n\nThe first known damage from this tornado occurred on the southeast corner of the intersection of Biggert Road and London Groveport Road.

The tornado continued to rapidly strengthen as it approached McOwen Road, where considerable tree damage was observed, with numerous stands of soft and hard wood trees snapped off completely or uprooted. A shipping container was tossed, and a home suffered extensive roof\n\nloss and the loss of one exterior wall, with debris thrown hundreds of yards downstream. In this area, winds were estimated to be around 120 mph.\n\nThe tornado began weakening just a bit as it crossed into Licking County, but still produced a wide swath of tree and structural damage along its path across Graham Road SW and Highway 41. Structural damage was mainly in the form of windows blown out, destroyed barns, and minor roof removal. The tornado continued to slowly weaken as it moved east-northeast from the Jersey area toward the southwest side of Granville where it dissipated. Along this stretch, mainly tree and very minor structural damage was noted.\n\nThe historical context of the February 28, 2024 tornadic event cannot be understated. While there have of course been other winter and other February tornadoes- including the aforementioned 2023 event- this is the largest single event on record for the Columbus metro in February and during the December-February winter period. Indeed, the 5 tornadoes that struck Franklin County is the most ever recorded for a single date at any time of year. The anomalously warm weather that is increasingly becoming more common during winter months is certainly playing a role in the amount of severe weather during the season. The high of 66 on the 28th and the low of 56 on the 27th both represent the warmest high and warmest low ever recorded for those dates.\n\nMonday, February 27, 2023\n\nA rare winter mini-outbreak occurred across Southwest and Central Ohio with 4 confirmed tornadoes, all of them week. Supercell thunderstorms with strong rotation moved through the region between 3PM-5PM, prompting numerous severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings. 2 of the 4 tornados occurred in the Columbus Metro.\n\nTornado #1\n\nThe first tornado in the Columbus area touched down southwest of Orient in far northern Pickaway County, just a few miles from the Franklin County border. The EF0 tornado had winds of up to 85MPH and traveled along a southwest to northeast path for about 1.4 miles. The tornado damaged several buildings and downed many trees along its path, but did not cause any injuries or fatalities.\n\nBULLETIN – EAS ACTIVATION REQUESTED\n\nTornado Warning\n\nNational Weather Service Wilmington OH\n\n357 PM EST Mon Feb 27 2023\n\nThe National Weather Service in Wilmington has issued a\n\n* Tornado Warning for…\n\nSouthwestern Franklin County in central Ohio…\n\nNorthwestern Pickaway County in central Ohio…\n\nSoutheastern Madison County in central Ohio…\n\n* Until 430 PM EST.\n\n* At 357 PM EST, a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado was located near Mount Sterling, moving northeast at 40 mph.\n\nHAZARD…Tornado and quarter size hail.\n\nSOURCE…Radar indicated rotation.\n\nIMPACT…Flying debris will be dangerous to those caught without shelter.

Damage details can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=817746\n\nTornado #4\n\nThe final tornado in the Columbus metro area was also the 2nd to last to be confirmed in Ohio (An EF0 briefly touched down from this storm in Vinton County). This 700-yard-wide EF1 touched down in Perry County at Twp. Road 71A at 1:35AM and travelled to the east-southeast on a 1.67-mile path that ended just inside Muskingum County. Winds reached at least 100MPH. At the time, there was no Tornado Warning. Details can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=817933\n\nOverall, the Central Ohio tornadoes caused about $4 million in damages, but luckily did not kill or injure any people.\n\nTuesday, April 3, 2018\n\nA mini outbreak of 5 tornadoes hit Ohio, 3 of which occurred within the Columbus metro.\n\nTornado #1\n\nAn EF0 tornado with winds of about 85MPH touched down briefly on a farm along Roberts Mill Road in Madison County at 5:14PM. The tornado damaged some buildings on the farm before lifting.\n\nhttps://www.weather.gov/iln/20180403_London\n\nTornado #2\n\nAt 5:37PM, an EF1 tornado touched down in Grove City just south of Orders Road near the Grove City First Baptist Church. From there it moved generally northeast for 2.63 miles. Winds reached 105MPH along its path. It lifted near Stringtown Road. More information can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.weather.gov/iln/20180403_grovecity\n\nTornado #3\n\nThe 3rd and final Central Ohio tornado of April 3, 2018 touched down in Perry County about an hour after the Grove City tornado. An EF0 first touched down just north of Baltimore-Somerset Road NE between Twp. Road 15 and Ridenour Road. From there, the tornado travelled about 1.25 miles in an easterly direction before lifting up at Bruno Road. The area is sparsely populated, so the tornado’s 75MPH-80MPH winds mostly down trees and caused damage to a few residential trailers. More information can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=741930\n\nSunday, November 5, 2017\n\nA Midwest tornado outbreak brought 16 Ohio tornadoes, now the 4th largest outbreak in Ohio history.\n\n**Coming Soon**\n\nWednesday, April 20, 2011\n\nAn outbreak of 15 tornadoes hit Ohio between April 19-20. The Columbus metro recorded 6, all of which occurred in the early morning hours of the 20th. This multi-state outbreak was the opening event of a very active tornadic week across the Eastern US that would eventually spawn 132 tornadoes through April 24th.\n\nTornado #1: The first tornado in the series came down in Pickaway County at 2:14AM. The EF1, having winds of 105MPH, had the longest path of the 6 at 4.2 miles. The tornado touched down on Main Street (Egypt Pike) on the south side of New Holland. The tornado moved slight north of due east to Rt. 207 east-southeast of Atlanta before lifting. It destroyed several farm buildings, including 3 barns and grain bin. Several treees were also downed. No injuries or deaths occurred.\n\nTornado #3: The second tornado touched down at 2:25AM on the morning of April 20th. Touchdown occurred at London-Lancaster Road on the border of Rickenbacker in southern Franklin County. The EF1 travelled about 2.6 miles almost due east to a point just west of Richardson Road. The 100-yard-wide tornado’s winds reached up to 109MPH along its path. Due to the area being mostly undeveloped, damage was limited. Damage consisted of uprooted trees, roof damage to two homes, downed power poles and significant damage to a large storage shed. No injuries or deaths were reported.\n\nTornado #3: The second tornado touched down about 2 miles east-northeast of Groveport in Franklin County at 2:27AM. This small EF0 had a path of about 250 yards and winds up to 83MPH. Touchdown occurred at Rager Road about midway between Groveport Road and US 33, and travelled eastward. Damage was almost entirely concentrated at a greenhouse complex near the touchdown site. Several greenhouse structures were damaged or destroyed, and plants and equipment were tossed about. No injuries or deaths were reported.\n\nTornado #4: An EF1 with winds of 110MPH touched down at 2:36AM near Baltimore in Fairfield County. It came down along Canal Road northeast of Baltimore, and then moved 2.4 miles east to Millersport Road. Damage consisted of of destroyed garage at a house, downed trees and a damaged barn. There were no injuries or deaths.\n\nTornado #5: At 2:42AM, the strongest tornado in the metro outbreak occurred in Licking County. The EF2, packing winds of up to 120MPH, touched down on Aerospace Drive at Ramp Creek just to the southwest of Heath. The tornado tracked east-northeast about 3.8 miles to Jacksontown Road south of Linville Road. Damage included downed trees and damage to several retail and commercial buildings. There were no injuries or deaths.\n\nTornado #6: The final tornado in the metro touched down at 2:48AM in Licking County. Touchdown of the EF1 occurred just northeast of Albright Road and south of Brushy Fork Road about 6 miles east-southeast of Newark. The 100-yard-wide tornado travelled about 500 yards in total. Damage included the destruction of a mobile home, snapped trees and damage to a second home. No injuries or deaths occurred.\n\nTo find out more about these tornadoes and this outbreak, go here: https://www.weather.gov/iln/20110420\n\nThursday, September 16, 2010\n\nAn outbreak of tornadoes across central and southeastern Ohio brought 4 tornadoes to the Columbus metro area.\n\nTornado #1\n\nThis EF0 tornado touched down about 3 miles south of Galena in Delaware County. First coming down just north of Big Walnut Road west of Pinehaven Drive, the tornado moved east-northeast for about 0.12 miles before lifting at Hoover Reservoir. The tornado’s 75MPH winds mostly caused damage to trees and ripped some shingles off of one house. No injuries or deaths were reported. More information on this tornado can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.weather.gov/iln/20100916_Galena\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=251493\n\nTornado #2\n\nThe next, and strongest tornado came down in Fairfield County. First touching down at Fairfield Union Road, the tornado moved generally eastward just north of West Rushville and Rushville before turning southeast and crossing into Perry County near the County Line Road and Twp. Road 140 intersection. The 75MPH winds in Fairfield County caused tree and roof damage along its path. As the tornado moved into Perry County, it strengthened into EF2 status with winds reaching 120MPH and a width of 800 yards. In Perry County, the tornado travelled 7 miles and destroyed 8 homes. No deaths occurred, but one woman was injured when a door hit her in the back. More information can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.weather.gov/iln/20100916_WestRushville\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=251492\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=255613\n\nTornado #3\n\nThis EF1 tornado first touched down near the intersection of Dozer Road and Valentine Road in southwest Fairfield County. It moved east-southeast on its roughly 4-mile total path, but was not on the ground the entire time- there were likely 3 separate touchdowns. The tornado damage continued in Hocking County near Ellis Road and Middlefork Road before the tornado finally lifted. Winds were estimated to be up to 90MPH along the path. Damage to trees, farm buildings, some homes and businesses occurred along its path, particularly in the Tarlton area, though there were no injuries or deaths.\n\nMore information can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.weather.gov/iln/20100916_Tarlton\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=256303\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=256305\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=256299\n\nTornado #4\n\nThis tornado, an EF1, was spawned by the same storm that produced the Fairield-Perry County tornado. First touching down at the Melon Road and Twp. Road 211 intersection, this tornado moved east-northeast until it entered Morgan County just west of Misco, finally ending north of Ogg Creek east of Whitehouse Road. During the 4.6 mile path, winds reached up to 110MPH in the 300-yard wide tornado. 8 homes were destroyed, with an additional 28 being damaged. No deaths or injuries were reported. The NWS officially lists this event as 2 tornadoes, though their beginning and end points are essentally the same. This was just the 2nd confirmed tornado in Morgan County since 1928. More information on this tornado can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=255614\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=255615\n\nhttps://www.weather.gov/rlx/perry09162010#:~:text=THE%20NATIONAL%20WEATHER%20SERVICE%20IN%20CHARLESTON%20WV%20HAS,STARTED%20IN%20FAIRFIELD%20COUNTY%20OHIO%20NEAR%20WEST%20RUSHVILLE.\n\nWednesday, September 20, 2000\n\nOn the same day that Xenia was struck by a deadly EF4, an EF2 tornado traveled a broken 25-mile path through Delaware, Licking and Knox counties. The tornado first touched down along Harlem Road about a mile north of the Franklin County line. From there it moved northeasterly for several miles. It destroyed 2 high-tension power towers and 14 homes before lifting just west of the Licking County line.\n\nThe tornado touched down again just inside Licking County just northeast of the Clover Valley Golf Club, moving generally east-northeast. At least 15 homes were damaged or destroyed along with several barns and outbuildings. Additionally, a dozen buildings at Buckeye Egg Company were destroyed, trapping at least 1 million chickens, most of which had to eventually be killed. The tornado continued into Knox County, causing damage to some farm buildings and 4 homes. Overall the 100-yard-wide tornado injured 2 people and caused about $2.5 million in damage.\n\nTuesday, May 23, 2000\n\nAn EF0 tornado briefly touched down just east of the Jerusalem Road/Lancaster-New Lexington Road intersection northeast of Bremen in Fairfield County. It downed trees, destroyed a shed and damaged some farm machinery. It caused about $50,000 damage along its 130-yard-wide, half-mile track. There were no injuries or deaths.\n\nA second tornado in the family, an EF1, touched down to the east in Perry County on Jackson Township Road 371. It then moved east for about 2 miles along County Road 9 (Pen Road) where it ripped off the roof of a house, pushed a modular home off its foundation, removed the roof another trailer before destroying a barn and garage on Palomino Road. The 150-yard-wide tornado caused about $185,000 in damage, but no injuries or deaths.\n\nSunday, July 12, 1992\n\nThe most active tornado day in Ohio history, a total of 28 tornadoes would touch down across the state.\n\nSunday, June 1, 1980\n\nAn EF1 tornado touched down on the southwest side of Croton in Licking County at around 3PM. It was only on the ground a few miles, but 8 homes were destroyed, and the fairgrounds sustained heavy damage. Three people were injured.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10097793\n\nAnother brief EF1 tornado touched down on the east side of Pataskala in Licking County at 2:30PM, damaging a home and some trees.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10097792\n\nTuesday, April 18, 1978\n\nAn EF1 tornado touched down on the north side of Big Darby Creek to the north of Plain City east of Rt. 42 at about 7PM. This tornado tracked generally east-northeast to a point just east of the Converse Road-Mitchell Dewitt Road intersection. The tornado lifted briefly at that point before touching down again, continuing on an east-northeast path just north of the Franklin-Delaware County line. It continued through the Muirfield area, across O’Shaughnessy Reservoir and then through southern Delaware county suburban areas to a point just north of Seldom Seen Road just west of Liberty Road. Overall, the tornado’s path was about 9.5 miles long and about 33 yards across. Luckily, only minor damage was reported throughout the path.\n\n**Note, although the Storm Events page lists this as occurring on April 19th, media articles from the time indicate it happened during the evening of April 18th.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10098835\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10098836\n\nTuesday, June 17, 1975\n\nA weak tornado touched down just outside the Scarlett Manor trailer park at 555 Greenlawn Avenue in Franklin County. The tornado proceeded to destroy 3 trailers, with dozens more damaged or knocked off their foundations. The tornado lifted briefly before coming down again and damaging the roofs of 4 buildings at the Greenbriar Apartments at 910 Eaton Avenue.\n\nA separate tornado hit Grove City in Franklin County, damaging about 30 homes in a 4-block area bounded by Parlin Drive, Yates Avenue, Hoover Road and Devin Road.\n\nYet another small EF1 tornado touched down briefly in SE Franklin County northeast of Bixby Road and Rohr Road.\n\nApril 3-4, 1974- The Super Outbreak\n\nAt one time, the Super Outbreak of April 1974 was the largest tornado outbreak in US history, but was eventually surpassed by the Southeast outbreak in April 2011. Still, the 1974 event is still legendary among US tornado events, and is perhaps most infamous for producing the Xenia EF5, which leveled a large portion of the city and, along with an EF4 in 2000, cemented the city’s reputation as a tornado magnet. Ohio recorded 13 separate tornadoes, 38 deaths and more than 1100 injuries. Central Ohio itself was largely spared from the destruction that western Ohio saw, but there were still 3 tornadoes from the event in the region, 2 of which were from the same storm that produced the Xenia monster.\n\nTornado #1\n\nThe first tornado in the Columbus Metro was an EF2 that touched down on the border of Madison and Clark counties near the intersection of Botkin Road and Neil Road. This 180-yard-wide tornado moved generally east-northeast, barely missing London to the south. The storm paralleled Rt 142 just to the its south for much of its path before lifting less than a mile to the southwest of West Jefferson. Despite staying on the ground for almost 16 miles, the tornado’s fortunate path prevented it from hitting much of anything except farmland, a warehouse and a few farm outbuildings, and there were no injuries or deaths. The storm that spawned this tornado, however, was so severe that Downtown London was heavily damaged by high winds and had to be evacuated. It was initially assumed it was caused by the tornado itself, but storm surveys show the tornado to have missed to the south and the London damage caused by high straight-line winds. This tornado was spawned by the Xenia storm.\n\nTornado #2\n\nThe second tornado was a short-lived EF1 in Pickaway County. It touched down northeast of the Rt 104/Rt 22 intersection and travelled about 1 mile to the northeast before lifting northeast of SR 56. Ironically, the smallest, most short-lived and weakest tornado in the Columbus series caused the most injuries when it destroyed the mobile home of a family of 7.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10086994\n\nTornado #3\n\nAt around 6:05PM, a tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of East Dublin-Granville and Hamilton Road in Franklin County. This EF2 tornado moved generally northeast for just over 5 miles, passing over 161 near Harlem Road and continuing northeast until it crossed the Franklin-Delaware County line and ending just south of Fancher Road. The 400-yard-wide tornado damaged or destroyed about 20 homes and toppled a large transmission tower. There were no injuries or fatalities. This was the final tornado from the Xenia storm cell.\n\nFor more information on this tornado, go here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10086991\n\nColumbus’ Worst Tornado\n\nThursday, May 10, 1973\n\nArguably the most significant tornado in Columbus history got its start with a storm in Northern Champaign County southwest of Couchman Road and Glady Creek at around 6:45PM. This EF3 tornado touched down and lifted numerous times, never staying on the ground for very long. The tornado first moved southeastward, passing just east of Urbana where it damaged 34 homes and several farm buildings, injuring 3 people. It then touched down again just north of Springfield and began moving more toward the east, but damage was minor in Clark County. The tornado first moved into the Columbus Metro when it touched down in northern Madison County. As it moved just to the north of London, the tornado damaged or destroyed 34 houses and caused 14 injuries. The storm then entered Franklin County on the northeast side of West Jefferson. In Franklin County, it first destroyed a mobile home near the intersection of Hall Road/Alton Road at about 8:30PM before destroying about 10 homes under construction in the Quail Hollow subdivision southeast of the Hall Road/Alton Road intersection. The tornado crossed Norton Road at the railroad tracks and then lifted. It would cause damage again by tearing the roof off a house on Big Run Road just north of 270 before damaging a business at 2375 Harrisburg Pike. It continued to sporadically damage buildings a 2380 Harrisburg Pike, 2500 Gantz Road and several homes along Dyer and Brown roads. It then struck the South High Drive-in at 3050 S. High Street, destroying one of the screens. The tornado next damaged homes, buildings and trees on Basswood Road and Stockbridge Road. After that, the tornado lifted again, before coming down near the intersection of Williams Road and Lockbourne Road, destroying the roof of a building. After that, the tornado lifted once more until it reached Fairfield County, where it destroyed a mobile home. Although not continuous, the tornado affected a path of about 85 miles overall. In Franklin County, the tornado damaged or destroyed 97 homes and dozens more other buildings. Damage was estimated above $1 million. There were also 3 injuries, but no deaths.\n\nTuesday, May 8, 1973\n\n**Coming Soon**\n\nPalm Sunday Tornado Outbreak\n\nApril 11-12, 1965\n\nThe Palm Sunday outbreak was one of the largest tornadic events in the Midwest up to that time, and still ranks as one of the deadliest nationally. The outbreak had 47 tornadoes with 271 fatalities. Ohio had 11 tornadoes during the event, 2 of which hit the Columbus metro area and will be detailed here.\n\nTornado #1\n\nThe most significant tornado within the Columbus metro, this EF2 touched down in Union County just west of the Delaware County line near the intersection of Smokey Road and Donovan Road after 11pm. From there it moved generally east-northeast along and just south of Smokey Road. The 400-yard-wide tornado caused only scattered damage until striking the northern sections of Radnor, destroying homes and other buildings. From there it crossed Delaware Stare Park and hit Westfield before the path ended in the far southwestern corner of Morrow County. Overall, the tornado killed 4 people and injured more than 60. It destroyed at least 25 homes and several farm buildings along its path, with damage exceeding $2.5 million.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10083991\n\nTornado #2\n\nThe second tornado in the metro areas was an EF1 that touched down after Midnight on Gibson Road north of Rt 316 to the northwest of South Bloomfield in Pickaway County. It moved generally east-northeast just to the north of Ashville and across dozens of farms before the path ended at the intersection of Marcy Road and Cedar Hill Road in Fairfield County. It touched down again shortly after and traveled across north-central Fairfield county, moving a few miles north of Lancaster before lifting again in southwest Perry County. From there, it touched down a 3rd time, traveling 3 more miles to just northeast of Somerset. The 300-yard-wide tornado injured about 10 people near Ashville and another 4 in Fairfield and Perry counties, causing damage to farms, homes and trees along its path, but caused no fatalities. It caused about $750,000 in damage along its 3 paths.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10083995\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10083996\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10083998\n\nThursday, September 12, 1963\n\nTornado #1: An EF1 tornado struck near Broadway in Union County around 11:30AM. It destroyed a barn and garage, damaged Broadway Elementary School and broke windows at Pickerington School, causing 9 students to be covered in glass, injuring two.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10084280\n\nTornado #2: An EFO touched down at Price Field, a small airport at roughly 4588 Refugee Road in Franklin County. There, the tornado flipped and damaged several small planes and ripped a wall from a hangar.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10084283\n\nTornado #3: The 3rd tornado of the day apparently came from the same storm that spawned #2. The EF1 hit about a quarter mile north of Pickerington on County Rd 20 in Licking County where it damaged or destroyed several farm buildings on 2 separate farms.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10084284\n\nThere were no deaths from this outbreak.\n\nWednesday, June 5, 1963\n\nTornado #1: An EF1 tornado struck Trailer Terrace Court on Rt. 40 about 1.25 miles west of Kirkersville in Licking County. The tornado destroyed a trailer during its less than half-mile track. No injuries or deaths were reported.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10084259\n\nTornado #2: An EF2 tornado touched down for less than half a mile at 6:30PM about 2 miles southwest of Commercial Point in Pickaway County. The tornado lifted a house trailer off its foundations and rolled it over a fence. 2 children were injured and about $25,000 in damages occurred.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10084260\n\nTuesday, July 22, 1958\n\nAn EF2 tornado touched down in Licking County just to the east of Mt Vernon Boulevard and north of Pierson Boulevard just north of Newark at around 1pm. The 200-yard-wide tornado traveled 8.6 miles in a general east-southeast direction to a point just to the east-northeast of Rt. 16 and Rock Haven Road SE. Besides many trees and power lines being knocked down, at least 20 farms reported heavy damage to barns, outbuildings and homes. The tornado also reportedly carried a 1.5 ton boiler half a mile. This would be the first tornado from the storm, which also produced tornadoes and damage in Muskingum, Guernsey, Coshocton and Tuscarawas counties. Meanwhile, storms brought over 2″ of rain across Columbus, flooding many streets.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10084507\n\nThursday, May 22, 1958\n\nAn EF2 tornado touched down about 3:15pm near Canal Road west of the Scioto River just southwest of Circleville. From there, the 30-yard-wide tornado traveled in a northeasterly direction, crossing Rt 23 and traveling along Crites Road. It continued moving northeast over Pickaway Country Club, passed the Pickaway/Fairfield County line less than half a mile north of Stoutsville, and ended to the southwest of the Justus Road SW and Wyandott Road SW intersection. The 9-mile path caused more than $250,000 in damage and 3 injuries. Strangely, I couldn’t find any news articles about this.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10084491\n\nFriday, March 19, 1954\n\nAt 8:50PM an EF1 tornado moved through a valley between the towns of Laurelville and Adelphi on the border of Pickaway, Ross and Hocking counties. This tornado was roughly 100 yards wide and traveled a path of about 1 mile. The tornado destroyed some outbuildings, trees and at least 4 homes in Laurelville. One home was punctured with 10-foot beams from a destroyed barn, narrowly missing a sleeping boy’s head. Losses were estimated between $20,000-$35,000. No injuries or deaths were reported.\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10083314\n\nSunday, June 16, 1912\n\nStorms hit the metro area during the afternoon and caused damage across the region. Several possible tornadoes touched down. In Dublin, the Christie Methodist Church, as well as the local Presbyterian church, were destroyed, trees were downed and several other buildings sustained roof damage. From Downtown Columbus to Linden, trees were downed, roofs were blown off, electric poles were snapped and billboards were demolished. Most of the damage in Columbus occurred between the northern part of Downtown through the Short North and east through southern Linden.\n\nIn addition, a tornado struck Downtown Plain City, causing significant damage to many buildings. In Grove City, a schoolhouse was destroyed and a few homes lost roofs. At least one person was killed in Worthington. One other interesting fact is that it was reported the storms were moving from southeast to northwest, a very unusual storm motion.\n\nTornado Events that will be added at a later date.\n\nMarch 8, 1964\n\n**Coming Soon**\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10084287\n\nMay 16, 1965 #2\n\n**Coming Soon**\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10084010\n\nNovember 16, 1965\n\n**Coming Soon**\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10089739\n\nNovember 27, 1965\n\n**Coming Soon**\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=10089751\n\nOhio Tornado Statistics By Year"
