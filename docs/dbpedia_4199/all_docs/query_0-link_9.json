This document has not been reviewed or officially approved by the Members of the Committee. LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL ---------- House of Representatives, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC Hon. William M. Thomas Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: In 1987, the Committee first published a resource document entitled ``Overview and Compilation of U.S. Trade Statutes'' for use by Committee Members and interested parties in the international trade community. This document was unique in that it contained not only an overview of the operation of foreign trade statutes, but also an overview of the operation of foreign trade statutes, but also an up-to-date statutory text of such laws, which integrated numerous separate acts of Congress into a single statutory compilation. This document was so well received by Members of Congress, congressional staff, government officials, the international trade community and the general public that an updated version was published in 1989 and updated and expanded versions were published in 1991, 1993 1995, and 1997. In order to update the changes in various trade statutes since the publication of the 1997 edition, the staff has prepared a new version, incorporating all statutory provisions enacted through the 106th Congress. As was the case with the earlier versions, the statutory authorities selected are the major provisions of federal law which are directly related to the conduct of U.S. international trade. The compilation is not meant to be a comprehensive treatise of every trade-related law or program, nor does it cover provisions to regulate domestic commerce. The laws and programs which are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means are the main focus of this document and are discussed in the greatest detail. In addition, some of the laws and programs described may be within the jurisdiction of other committees of the House of Representatives. These provisions are included in order to provide a complete survey of the principal trade authorities. The document has been prepared by the Committees' trade staff with assistance from the Office of the Legislative Counsel and various government agencies, to which the staff extends its most sincere thanks. (III) IV Any suggestions on how to improve this document as a reference tool in subsequent editions of this publication are always welcome. Sincerely yours, Angela Ellard, Staff Director & Counsel, Subcommittee on Trade PREFACE The role of Congress in formulating international economic policy and regulating international trade in based on a specific constitutional grant of power. Article I of the U.S. Constitution sets forth the various powers and responsibilities of the legislature. Article I, section 8 lists certain specific express powers of the Congress. Among these express powers are the powers: ``to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises . . . [and] to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states. . . .'' The Congress therefore is the fundamental authority responsible for federal government regulation of international transactions. Within the House of Representatives, jurisdiction over trade legislation lies in the Committee on Ways and Means, based on its jurisdiction over taxes, tariffs, and trade agreements, Throughout the history of U.S. trade law and policy, the Committee on Ways and Means has been at the forefront of its development. The Committee's jurisdiction ranges from regulation of tariff affairs, to regulation of non- tariff trade barriers such as quotas and standards, regulation of unfair trade practices such as dumping, subsidization, or counterfeiting, provisions of temporary relief from import competition and adjustment assistance, providing for bilateral and multilateral trade agreements with foreign trading partners, and responsibility for authorizing and overseeing the departments and agencies charged with implementation of the trade laws and programs. The difficulties of retaining and exercising full control over international trade matters within the legislative branch were recognized by Congress shortly after enactment of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. In 1934, the Congress enacted the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act which delegated to the President authority to negotiate international trade agreements for the reduction of tariffs. This Act, which marked the beginning of the trade agreements program for the United States, represented the first significant delegation of authority from Congress to the President with respect to international trade policy. Since 1934, the delegation of authority from Congress to the President has varied in scope and degree, reflecting congressional concern over maintaining careful control of international trade policy. When the trade agreements negotiating authority granted to the President expired in 1967, for example, it was not renewed again until 1974. In the Trade Act of 1974, presidential negotiating authority was substantially revised, extended to non-tariff as well as tariff negotiations, and made subject to specific consultation and notification requirements both prior to and during the course of negotiation. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, in addition to providing negotiating authority and explicit negotiating (V) VI objectives for the Uruguay Round, expands the consultation requirements between the USTR and the Congress and requires the formulation of an annual trade policy agenda. Both the Uruguay Round Agreements Act and the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act provide for the involvement of Congress in a number of key trade policy areas. The Trade and Development Act of 2000 marks important changes in U.S. preferential benefits for the Canbbean Basin and provides such benefits for the first time to the nations of sub-Sahanan Africa. Finally, legislation in 2000 concerning normal trade relations for the People's Republic of China represents the congressional views on the accession of this important country to the World Trade Organization. Due to the central role of Congress in formulating international economic policy, an understanding of U.S. international trade law and policy must begin with the statutory authorities and programs which provide the foundation for our trade policy. This document provides two essential tools for those interested in obtaining a better understanding of U.S. trade law and policy. Part I contains a general overview of current provisions of our trade laws. This over view was prepared by the staff of the Subcommittee on Trade with the assistance of the Congressional Research Service and provides a thorough yet understandable explanation of how these laws operate. Part II contains a compilation of the actual text of these laws, as amended. This updated statutory compilation incorporates all major provisions of U.S. trade law and includes all amendments to theses laws as of the beginning of the 107th Congress. While this integrated text should not be treated as a substitute for official public laws or the United States Code, it is an accurate and highly useful document which integrates numerous separate Acts of Congress into one text. We hope this document will prove useful to official policymakers as well as the interested public.

Incorporated into a multilateral convention effective as of January 1, 1988, the HS was derived from the earlier Customs Cooperation Council Nomenclature, which in turn was a new version of the older Brussels Tariff Nomenclature. The HS is an up-to-date, detailed nomenclature structure intended to be utilized by contracting parties as the basis for their tariff, statistical and transport documentation programs. The United States did not adopt either of the two previous nomenclatures but, because it was a party to the convention creating the Council and because of the potential benefits from using a modern, widely adopted nomenclature, became involved in the technical work to develop the HS. Section 608(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 \\4\\ directed the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to investigate the principles and concepts which should underlie such an international nomenclature and to participate fully in the Council's technical work on the HS. The ITC, the U.S. Customs Service (which represents the United States at the Council), and other agencies were involved in this work through the mid and late 1970's; in 1981, the President requested that the ITC prepare a draft conversion of the U.S. tariff into the nomenclature format of the HS, even as the international efforts to complete the nomenclature continued. The Commission's report and converted tariff were issued in June 1983. After considerable review and the receipt of comments from interested parties, legislation to repeal the TSUS and replace it with the HTS was introduced. Following the August 23, 1988 enactment of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, the United States became a party to the HS Convention, joining over 75 other major trading partners. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Public Law 93-618, approved January 3, 1975. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Structure of the HTS Under the HS Convention, the contracting parties are obliged to base their import and export schedules on the HS nomenclature, but the rates of duty are set by each contracting party. The HS is organized into 21 sections and 96 chapters, with accompanying general interpretive rules and legal notes. Goods in trade are assigned in the system, in general, to categories beginning with crude and natural products and continue in further degrees of complexity through advanced manufactured goods. These product headings are designated, at the broadest coverage level, with 4-digit numerical codes and are further subdivided into narrower categories assigned 2 additional digits. The contracting parties must employ all 4- and 6-digit provisions and all international rules and notes without deviation; they may also adopt still narrower subcategories and additional notes for national purposes, and they determine all rates of duty. Thus, a common product description and numbering system to the 6-digit level of detail exists for all contracting parties, facilitating international trade in goods. Two final chapters, 98 and 99, are reserved for national use (chapter 77 is reserved for future international use). The HTS therefore sets forth all the international nomenclature through the 6-digit level and, where needed, contains added subdivisions assigned 2 more digits, for a total of 8 at the tariff-rate line (legal) level. Two final (non- legal) digits are assigned as statistical reporting numbers where further statistical detail is needed (for a total of 10 digits to be listed on entries). Chapter 98 comprises special classification provisions (former TSUS schedule 8), and chapter 99 (former appendix to the TSUS) contains temporary modifications pursuant to legislation or to presidential action. Each section's chapters contain numerous 4-digit headings (which may, when followed by 4 zeroes, serve as U.S duty rate lines) and 6- and 8-digit subheadings. Additional U.S. notes may appear after HS notes in a chapter or section. Most of the general headnotes of the former TSUS appear as general notes to the HTS set forth before chapter 1, along with notes covering more recent trade programs (and the non-legal statistical notes). These notes contain definitions or rules on the scope of the pertinent provisions, or set additional requirements for classification purposes. In addition, the HTS contains a table of contents, an index, footnotes, and other administrative material, which are provided for ease of reference and, along with the statistical reporting provisions, have no legal significance or effect. The HTS is not published as a part of the statutes and regulations of the United States but is instead subsumed in a document produced and updated regularly by the ITC entitled ``Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States: Annotated for Statistical Reporting Purposes.'' Changes in the TSUS became so frequent and voluminous that its inclusion in title 19 of the United States Code effectively ceased with the 1979 supplement to the 1976 edition. The Commission is charged by section 1207 of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (19 U.S.C. 3007) with the responsibility of compiling and publishing, ``at appropriate intervals,'' and keeping up to date the HTS and any related materials. The initial document appeared as USITC Publication 2030. That document, and subsequent issuances, have included both the current legal text of the HTS and all statistical provisions adopted under section 484(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(f)). It is presented as a looseleaf publication so that pages being issued in supplements to modify the schedule's basic edition for any year edition may be inserted as replacements. Two or more supplements may appear between the publication of each basic edition. Unlike the TSUS, which applied exclusively to imported goods, the HTS can, for almost all goods, be used to document both imports and exports. The small number of exceptions enumerated before chapter 1 require particular exports to be reported under schedule B provisions. That schedule, which prior to 1989 served as the means of reporting all exports, has been converted to the HS nomenclature structure. For certain goods that are significant U.S. exports, variations in the desired product description and detail compel the use of schedule B reporting provisions that cannot be accommodated in the HTS under the international nomenclature structure. The HTS, like its predecessor the TSUS, is presented in a tabular format containing 7 columns, each with a particular type of information. A sample page of the HTS is set forth on the next page.

It should be recalled that 8-digit-level provisions bear the only numerical codes at the legal level which are determined solely by the United States, because the 4- and 6-digit designators are part of the international convention. The second column is labeled ``Stat. suffix,'' meaning statistical suffix. Wherever a tariff rate line is annotated to permit collection of trade data on narrower classes of merchandise, the provisions adopted administratively by an interagency committee under section 484(f) of the 1930 Act (19 U.S.C. 1484(f)) are given 2 more digits which must be included on the entry filed with customs officials. Where no annotations exist, 2 additional zeroes are added to the 8-digit legal code applicable to the goods in question. The goods falling in all 10-digit statistical reporting numbers of a particular 8-digit legal provision receive the same duty treatment. The third column, ``Article description,'' contains the detailed description of the goods falling within each tariff provision and statistical reporting number. In the fourth column, ``Units of quantity,'' the unit of measure in which the goods in question are to be reported for statistical purposes is set forth. These units are administratively determined under section 484(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930. In many instances, the unit of quantity is also the basis for the assessment of the duty. For many categories of products, two or three different figures in different units must be reported (e.g., for some textiles, weight and square meters; for some apparel, the number of garments, value, and weight), with the second unit of quantity frequently being the basis for administering a measure regulating imports, such as a quota. If an ``X'' appears in this column, only the value of the shipment must be reported. The remaining columns appear under the common heading ``Rates of duty'' and are designated as column 1 (subdivided into ``General'' and ``Special'' subcolumns) and column 2. These columns contain the various rates of duty that apply to the goods of the pertinent legal provision, depending on the source of the goods and other criteria. Their application to goods originating in particular countries is discussed below under the heading ``Applicable duty treatment.'' A rate of duty generally has one of three forms: ad valorem, specific or compound. An ad valorem rate of duty is expressed in terms of a percentage to be assessed upon the customs value of the goods in question. A specific rate is expressed in terms of a stated amount payable on some quantity of the imported goods, such as 17 cents per kilogram. Compound duty rates combine both ad valorem and specific components (such as 5 percent ad valorem plus 17 cents per kilogram). Chapter 98 comprises special classification provisions permitting, in specified circumstances, duty-free entry or partial duty-free entry of goods which would otherwise be subject to duty. The article descriptions in the provisions of this chapter enunciate the circumstances in which goods are eligible for this duty treatment. Some of the goods eligible for such duty treatment include: articles reimported after having been exported from the United States; goods subject to personal exemptions (such as those for returning U.S. residents); government importations; goods for religious, educational, scientific, or other qualifying institutions; samples; and, articles admitted under bond. Chapter 99 contains temporary modifications of the duty treatment of specified articles in the other chapters. Additional duties and suspensions or reductions of duties enacted by Congress are included, as are temporary modifications (increases or decreases in duty rates) and import restrictions (quotas, import fees, and so forth) proclaimed by the President under trade agreements or pursuant to legislation. Separate subchapters contain temporary special duty treatment for certain goods of Canada or of Mexico pursuant to the NAFTA. However, antidumping and countervailing duties imposed under the authority of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, are not included. These duties are announced in the Federal Register. Applicable duty treatment Column 1--General.--The rates of duty appearing in the ``General'' subcolumn of column 1 of the HTS are imposed on products of countries that have been extended most-favored- nation (MFN) or non-discriminatory trade treatment by the United States, unless such imports are claimed to be eligible for treatment under one of the preferential tariff schemes discussed below. The general duty rates are concessional and have been set through reductions of full statutory rates in negotiations with other countries, generally under the GATT. Column 1--Special.--General Note 3 to the HTS sets forth the special tariff treatment afforded to covered products of designated countries or under specified measures. These programs and the corresponding symbols by which they are indicated in the ``Special'' subcolumn along with the appropriate rates of duty are as follows: Generalized System of Preferences [GSP] A or A* Automotive Products Trade Act [APTA]... B Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft C [ATCA]. North American Free Trade Agreement:... Goods of Canada...................... CA Goods of Mexico...................... MX Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act E or E* [CBERA]. United States-Israel Free Trade Area... IL Andean Trade Preference Act [ATPA]..... J or J* The presence of one or more of these symbols indicates the eligibility of the described articles under the respective program. In the case of the GSP (when in effect), a symbol followed by an asterisk indicates that, although the described articles are generally eligible for duty-free entry, such tariff treatment does not apply to products of the designated beneficiary countries specified in General Note 4(d). In the case of CBERA and the ATPA, the asterisk indicates that some of the described articles are ineligible for duty-free entry. These programs are discussed in greater detail below. Column 2.--The column 2 rates of duty apply to products of countries that have been denied MFN status by the United States (see General Note 3(b)); these rates are the full statutory rates, generally as enacted by the Tariff Act of 1930. (See separate description of most-favored-nation treatment and HTS General Note 3(b) for a list of countries subject to column 2 rates of duty.) Special duty exemptions and preferences Certain notable provisions in chapter 98 of the HTS grant duty-free entry to various categories of American goods returned from abroad and allow U.S. tourists to import foreign articles free of duty. Other provisions in the general notes of the HTS provide duty-free entry to imports from the U.S. insular possessions, to imports of Canadian auto products under the Automotive Products Trade Act, and to articles imported for use in civil aircraft under the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. American goods returned (HTS subheading 9801.00.10).-- American goods not advanced or improved abroad may be returned to the United States free of duty under HTS subheading 9801.00.10. The courts have interpreted this provision to allow duty-free entry of American goods which had been exported for sorting, separating (e.g., by grade, color, size, etc.), culling out, and discarding defective items and repackaging in certain containers, so long as the goods themselves were not advanced in value or improved in condition while abroad. American goods repaired or altered abroad (HTS subheading 9802.00.40).--HTS subheading 9802.00.40 provides that goods exported from the United States for repairs or alterations abroad are subject to duty upon their reimportation into the United States (at the duty rate applicable to the imported article) only upon the value of such repairs or alterations. The provision applies to processing such as restoration, renovation, adjustment, cleaning, correction of manufacturing defects, or similar treatment that changes the condition of the exported article but does not change its essential character. The value of the repairs or processing for purposes of assessing duties is generally determined, in accordance with U.S. note 3 to subchapter II of chapter 98, by-- (1) the cost of the repairs or alterations to the importer; or (2) if no charge is made, the value of the repairs or alterations, as set out in the customs entry. However, if the customs officer finds that the amount shown in the entry document is not reasonable, the value of the repairs or alterations will be determined in accordance with the valuation standards set out in section 402 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.\\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ 19 U.S.C. 1401a. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- American metal articles processed abroad (HTS subheading 9802.00.60).--HTS subheading 9802.00.60 provides that an article of metal (except precious metal) which is exported from the United States for processing abroad may be subject to duty on the value of the processing only upon its return to the United States. To qualify for this duty treatment, the exported article (1) must have been manufactured or subjected to a process of manufacture in the United States; and (2) must be returned ``for further processing'' in the United States. The term ``processing'' refers to such operations as melting, molding, casting, machining, grinding, drilling, tapping, threading, cutting, punching, rolling, forming, plating, and galvanizing. As in the case of articles imported under subheading 9802.00.40 (repairs or alterations), discussed above, the duty on metal articles processed abroad is assessed against the value of such processing, determined in accordance with U.S. note 3 to subchapter II of chapter 98. American components assembled abroad (HTS subheading 9802.00.80).--Articles assembled abroad from American-made components may be exempt from duty on the value of such components when the assembled article is imported into the United States under HTS subheading 9802.00.80. This provision enables American manufacturers of relatively labor-intensive products to take advantage of low-cost labor and fiscal incentives in other countries by exporting American parts for assembly in such countries and returning the assembled products to the United States, with partial exemption from U.S. duties. Subheading 9802.00.80 applies to articles assembled abroad in whole or in part of fabricated components, the product of the United States, which-- (1) were exported in condition ready for assembly without further fabrication; (2) have not lost their physical identity in such articles by change in form, shape, or otherwise; and (3) have not been advanced in value or improved in condition abroad except by being assembled and by operations incidental to the assembly process such as cleaning, lubricating, and painting. The exported articles used in the imported goods must be fabricated U.S. components, i.e., U.S.-manufactured articles ready for assembly in their exported condition, except for operations incidental to the assembly process. Integrated circuits, compressors, zippers, and precut sections of a garment are examples of fabricated components, but uncut bolts of cloth, lumber, sheet metal, leather, and other materials exported in basic shapes and forms are not considered to be fabricated components for this purpose. To be considered U.S. components, the exported articles do not necessarily need to be fabricated from articles or materials wholly produced in the United States. If a foreign article or material undergoes a manufacturing process in the United States resulting in its ``substantial transformation'' into a new and different article, then the component that emerges may qualify as an exported product of the United States for purposes of subheading 9802.00.80. The assembly operations performed abroad can involve any method used to join solid components together, such as welding, soldering, gluing, sewing, or fastening with nuts and bolts. Mixing, blending, or otherwise combining liquids, gases, chemicals, food ingredients, and amorphous solids with each other or with solid components is not regarded as ``assembling'' for purposes of subheading 9802.00.80. The rate of duty that applies to the dutiable portion of an assembled article is the same rate that would apply to the imported article. The assembled article is also treated as being entirely of foreign origin for purposes of any import quota or similar restriction applicable to that class of merchandise, and for purposes of country-of-origin marking requirements. All requirements regarding labeling, radiation standards, flame retarding properties, etc., that apply to imported products apply equally to subheading 9802.00.80 merchandise. An article imported under subheading 9802.00.80 is treated as a foreign article for appraisement purposes. That is, the full appraised value of the article must first be determined under the usual appraisement provisions. The dutiable value, however, is determined by deducting the cost or value of the American-made fabricated components from the appraised value of the assembled merchandise entered under subheading 9802.00.80. Personal (tourist) exemption.--Subchapter IV of chapter 98 of the HTS sets forth various personal exemptions for residents and non-residents that arrive in the United States from abroad. The relevant customs regulations are set forth at 19 CFR 148 et seq. In particular, HTS subheading 9804.00.65 provides that U.S. residents returning from a journey abroad may import up to 400 dollars' worth of articles free of duty. The articles must be for personal or household use and may include not more than 1 liter of alcoholic beverages, not more than 200 cigarettes and not more than 100 cigars. The technical amendment to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-277) inadvertently removed the personal exemption relating to domestically produced cigarettes re- imported into the United States. As a result, travelers bringing cigarettes puchased outside the United States did not receive the personal exemption for these cigarettes (i.e., they were not permitted to bring these cigarettes into the United States). Section 4003 of the Tariff Suspension and Trade Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-476) re-instated that exemption. Special rules provide increased duty-free allowances for U.S. residents returning from U.S. insular possessions or from beneficiary countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) and under the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA). An increased duty-free allowance of $1200 is provided under HTS subheading 9804.00.70 for U.S. residents returning from the U.S. insular possessions, and an increased duty-free allowance of $600 is provided under HTS subheading 9804.00.72 for U.S. residents returning from beneficiary countries under the CBERA and the ATPA. U.S. note 3 to chapter 98 provides that, in addition to being exempt from customs duty, all such articles are exempt from any internal revenue taxes as well. The Tariff Suspension and Trade Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-476) provides for staged reductions of duty rates applicable to merchandise accompanying persons entering the United States, and merchandise from American Samoa, Guam, or the U.S. Virgin Islands. Purchases for personal and household use accompanying the returning traveler in excess of the $400 duty-free allowance had been subject to flat rate of duty of 10 percent, if the person claiming the benefit had not received the benefit within the past thirty days. In addition, non- commercial importations from U.S. insular possessions exceeding $1200 (American Samoa, Guam, or the U.S. Virgin Islands) were subject to a 5 percent rate of duty. This legislation provides a staged reduction of the 10 percent duty-rate as follows: 5 percent effective January 1, 2000, 4 percent effective January 1, 2001, and 3 percent effective January 1, 2002. The legislation also provides a staged reduction of the 5 percent rate of duty for articles imported from American Samoa, Guam, or the U.S. Virgin Islands as follows: 3 percent effective January 1, 2000, 2 percent effective January 1, 2001, and 1.5 percent effective January 1, 2002. The Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-295) amended the exemption from duty for personal and household goods accompanying returning U.S. residents. Section 321(a)(2)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930 originally applied to returning residents arriving from foreign countries other than the insular possessions. Due to a split in tariff classification numbers, the tariff numbers applicable to residents returning from a foreign country were inadvertently dropped. The Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1996 restored HTS number 9804.00.65 to correct the error and allow the Customs Service to apply administrative exemptions from duty for personal and household goods of returning residents arriving from foreign countries other than insular possessions. It ensures that U.S. residents returning from foreign countries other than insular possessions are entitled to bring articles for personal or household use free of duty, if such articles are valued at not more than $400. The provision was made retroactive to December 8, 1993, the date on which the customs provisions within the NAFTA (Public Law 103- 182) became law. In addition, the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-295) amended the personal allowance exemption for merchandise purchased in duty- free sales enterprises. Previously, under section 555(b)(6) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1555(b)(6)), merchandise purchased in duty-free sales enterprises which was brought back to U.S. customs territory was not eligible for a duty-free exemption under the personal allowance exemption for returning U.S. residents. The Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1996 amended section 555(b)(6) to make merchandise purchased by returning U.S. residents in duty-free enterprises eligible for a duty-free exemption under HTS subheadings 9804.00.65, 9804.00.70, and 9804.00.72, if the person meets the eligibility requirements of the exemption. This provision does not apply in the case of travel involving transit to, from, or through an insular possession of the United States. Duty-free treatment for personal effects of participants in international sporting events.--The Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-36) extended until December 2002 duty-free treatment for the personal effects of participants in, officials of, and accredited members of delegations to certain international athletic events held in the United States provided that these items are not intended for sale or distribution in the United States. The provision also exempted the articles covered under this provision from taxes and fees and gave the Secretary of the Treasury discretion to determine which athletic events, articles, and persons are covered under this provision. The Tariff Suspension and Trade Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-476) made this exemption permanent under new HTS subheading 9817.60.00. Products of U.S. insular possessions (General Note 3(a)(iv)).--Imports from the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island, Kingman Reef, Johnson Island, and Midway Islands are entitled to duty-free entry under certain conditions, designed to promote the economic development of these U.S. insular possessions. This provision does not apply to Puerto Rico, which is part of the ``customs territory of the United States.'' As provided in General Note 3(a)(iv) of the HTS, an article imported directly from a possession is exempt from duty if-- (1) it was grown or mined in the possession; (2) it was produced or manufactured in the possession, and the value of foreign materials contained in that article does not exceed 70 percent of its total value. Materials of U.S. origin are not considered foreign for this purpose. Likewise, materials that could be imported into the United States duty free (except from Cuba or the Philippines) are not counted as foreign materials for purposes of the 70 percent foreign-content limitation; or (3) in the case of any article excluded from duty- free entry under section 213(b) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, it was produced or manufactured in the possession, and the value of foreign materials does not exceed 50 percent of its total value. In addition, an article previously imported into the United States with duty or tax paid thereon, shipped to a possession without benefit of remission, refund, or drawback of such duty or tax, may be returned to the United States duty free. General Note 3(a)(iv) also provides that articles from insular possessions are entitled to no less favorable duty treatment than that accorded to eligible articles under the Generalized System of Preferences and the Caribbean Basin Initiative described below. In applying the 70 percent foreign-materials test, Customs determines the value of the foreign materials by their actual purchase price, plus the transportation cost to the possession, excluding any duties or taxes assessed by the possession and excluding any post-landing charges. The value thus determined is then compared with the appraised value of the products imported into the United States, determined in accordance with the usual appraisement methods. If the differential is 30 percent or more, the foreign materials limitation is satisfied. This procedure is set out in 19 C.F.R. 7.8(d). As previously noted, the product imported from a possession must have been produced or manufactured there (unless grown or mined there). It is not sufficient for foreign goods to be shipped to a possession for nominal handling or manipulation, followed by a price mark-up to meet the 70 percent test. Extension of United States Insular Possession Program.--The Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-36) (the Act) amended the U.S. notes to Chapter 71 by adding an additional U.S. Note 3. This amendment extends to certain fine jewelry the same trade benefits enjoyed by watch makers in U.S. insular possessions under the Production Incentive Certificate (PIC) program. U.S. Note 5 allows producers of watches located in U.S. insular possessions to benefit from the PIC system, which permits watch producers to import specified quantities of watches, watch movements, and watch parts. The benefits provided under Note 5 are based on the amount of wages paid to produce such watches in insular possessions. New Note 3(a) permits the inclusion of wages paid for jewelry production in the insular possessions as an offset to duties paid on watches, watch movements, and watch parts imported into the United States. Note 3(b) provides that the extension of Note 5 benefits to jewelry may not result in any increase in the authorized amount to benefits established by Note 5, and Note 3 (c) prohibits diminishing of benefits that had been available to watch poducers under paragraph (h)(iv) of Note 5 to Chapter 91. Canadian motor vehicles and original equipment entry pursuant to the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965 (APTA) (General Note 5).--Throughout the HTS there are a number of specific provisions which provide for duty-free entry of imported motor vehicles and specified original equipment parts that qualify as ``Canadian articles'' under General Note 5. These provisions were added to the HTS pursuant to the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965,\\6\\ which was enacted to implement the U.S.-Canadian Automotive Agreement. The purpose of the Agreement was to create a North American common market for motor vehicles and original equipment parts (replacement parts are not covered). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ Public Law 89-283, 19 U.S.C. 2001, et seq. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The term ``Canadian article'' refers to an article produced in Canada but does not include any article produced with non- Canadian or non-U.S. materials unless the article satisfies the criteria set forth in the NAFTA (General Note 12). Most of the product categories established by the APTA are applicable to ``original motor-vehicle equipment,'' which is defined in General Note 5(a)(ii) as a Canadian fabricated component intended for use as original equipment in the manufacture of a motor vehicle in the United States and which was obtained from a Canadian supplier pursuant to ``a written order, contract, or letter of intent of a bona fide motor- vehicle manufacturer in the United States.'' The phrase ``bona fide motor-vehicle manufacturer'' is defined as a person determined by the Secretary of Commerce to have produced at least 15 motor vehicles in the previous 12 months and to have the capacity to produce at least 10 motor vehicles per week. Civil aircraft products (ATCA) (General Note 6).--Title VI of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 gave the President the authority to proclaim new headnote 3 to part 6C of schedule 6; to make specific headnotes to designated TSUS items in order to implement the Tokyo Round Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft; and to provide duty-free treatment, in accordance with the annex to the Agreement for the civil aircraft articles described therein. These changes were implemented by Presidential Proclamation 4707 of December 11, 1979. This duty treatment is continued in the ``Special'' rates subcolumn of the HTS. The provisions work much like those implementing the APTA in that a number of specific product breakouts are spread throughout the HTS providing duty-free entry to specifically described articles which are ``certified for use in civil aircraft'' in accordance with General Note 6. Section 234 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 enacted on October 30, 1984, gave the President the authority to make additional tariff breakouts in designated TSUS items in order to provide duty-free coverage comparable to the expanded coverage provided by all other signatories to the Aircraft Agreement pursuant to the extension of the annex to the Agreement agreed to in Geneva on October 6, 1983. This duty treatment has been continued in the ``Special'' rates subcolumn of the HTS for the relevant articles. The Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-295) significantly amended General Note 6. The note now requires importers of duty-free civil aircraft parts to maintain such supporting documentation as the Secretary of the Treasury may require. Importers must also certify that the imported article is a civil aircraft, or has been imported for use in a civil aircraft and will be so used. The importer may amend the entry or file a written statement to claim duty-free treatment under General Note 6 at any time before the liquidation of the entry becomes final, except that any refund resulting from any such claim shall be without interest. The amendment to General Note 6 also changed the definition of ``civil aircraft'' to mean any aircraft, aircraft engine, or ground flight simulator (including parts, components, and subassemblies thereof): (A) that is used as original or replacement equipment in the design, development, testing, evaluation, manufacture, repair, maintenance, rebuilding, modification, or conversion of aircraft; and (B)(1) that is manufactured or operated pursuant to a certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), or pursuant to the approval of the airworthiness authority in the country of exportation, if such approval is recognized by the FAA as an acceptable substitute for an FAA certificate; (2) for which an application for such certificate has been submitted to, and accepted by, the FAA by an existing type and production certificate holder; or (3) for which an application for such approval or certificate will be submitted in the future by an existing type and production certificate holder, pending the completion of design or other technical requirements stipulated by the FAA. This section applies only to quantities of parts, components, and subassemblies as are required to meet the design and technical requirements stipulated by the FAA. The Commissioner of Customs may also require the importer to estimate the quantities of parts, components, and subassemblies covered under this section. The term ``civil aircraft'' does not include any aircraft, aircraft engine, or ground flight simulator purchased for use by the Department of Defense or the U.S. Coast Guard, unless such aircraft, aircraft engine, or ground flight simulator satisfies the requirements outlined above. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) TITLE V OF THE TRADE ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED The concept of a Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) was first introduced in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1964. Developing countries (LDCs) asserted that one of the major impediments to accelerated economic growth and development was their inability to compete on an equal basis with developed countries in the international trading system. Through tariff preferences in developed country markets, the LDCs claimed they could increase exports and foreign exchange earnings needed to diversify their economies and reduce dependence on foreign aid. After several international meetings and long internal debate, in 1968 the United States joined other industrialized countries in supporting the concept of GSP. As initially conceived, GSP systems were to be (1) temporary, unilateral grants of preferences by developed to developing countries; (2) designed to extend benefits to sectors of developing country economies which were not competitive internationally; and (3) designed to include safeguard mechanisms to protect domestic industries sensitive to import competition from articles receiving preferential tariff treatment. In the early 1970's, 19 other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also instituted and have since renewed GSP schemes. In order to implement their GSP systems, the developed countries obtained a waiver from the most-favored-nation (MFN) obligation of article I of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which provides that trade must be conducted among countries on a non-discriminatory basis. A 10-year MFN waiver was granted in June 1971 and was made permanent in 1979 through the ``enabling clause'' of the Texts Concerning a Framework for the Conduct of World Trade concluded in the Tokyo Round of GATT multilateral trade negotiations. The enabling clause, which has no expiration date, provides the legal basis for ``special and differential treatment'' for developing countries. The enabling clause also requires that developing countries accept the principle of graduation, under which such countries agree to assume ``increased GATT responsibilities as their economies progress.'' U.S. GSP basic authority Statutory authority for the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences program is set forth in title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.\\7\\ Authority to grant GSP duty-free treatment on eligible articles from beneficiary developing countries (BDCs) became effective under that Act on January 3, 1975, for a 10-year period expiring on January 3, 1985. The program was actually implemented on January 1, 1976 under Executive Order 11888. Relatively minor amendments to the statute were made under section 1802 of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 \\8\\ and section 1111 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.\\9\\ Title V of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 \\10\\ renewed the GSP program for 8\\1/2\\ years until July 4, 1993, with significant amendments effective on January 4, 1985, particularly with respect to the criteria for designating beneficiary countries and limitations on duty-free treatment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ Public Law 93-618, approved January 3, 1975. \\8\\ Public Law 94-455, approved October 4, 1976. \\9\\ Public Law 96-39, approved July 26, 1979. \\10\\ Public Law 98-573, title V, approved October 30, 1984. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The GSP program was extended without amendment for 15 months, until September 30, 1994, by section 13802 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.\\11\\ The program was again extended without amendment for 10 months, until July 31, 1995, by section 601 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.\\12\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ Public Law 103-66, approved August 10, 1993. \\12\\ Public Law 103-465, approved December 8, 1994. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subtitle J of title I of the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996 renewed the GSP program for 1 year and 10 months, through May 31, 1997, with amendments effective October 1, 1996. This law also revised and reorganized title V.\\13\\ An additional technical change was made by the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1996.\\14\\ Section 1011 of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-277) extended to program through June 30, 1999, and section 508 of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-170) extended it through September 30, 2001. The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, signed into law by the President on May 18, 2000 (Public Law 106-200) extended regular and enhanced GSP benefits through September 30, 2008, for eligible countries in sub-Saharan Africa. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ Public Law 104-188, approved August 20, 1996. \\14\\ Public Law 104-295, approved October 11, 1996. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) administers the GSP program and makes recommendations to the President through an interagency committee that conducts annual reviews under regulatory procedures of petitions by interested parties and self-initiated actions to add or remove GSP eligibility for individual products or countries. Section 501 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, authorizes the President to provide GSP duty-free treatment on any eligible article from designated beneficiary developing countries, subject to certain conditions and limits, having due regard for (1) the effect of such action on furthering the economic development of developing countries through the expansion of their exports; (2) the extent other major developed countries are undertaking a comparable effort to assist developing countries by granting generalized preferences on their products (i.e., burden-sharing); (3) the anticipated impact on U.S. producers of like or directly competitive products; and (4) the extent of the BDC's competitiveness with respect to eligible articles. In 1999, the program provided duty-free treatment on imports valued at about $13.7 billion from 146 designated developing countries and territories. Designation of beneficiary developing countries Section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President to designate a country or territory as a BDC. It also authorizes the President to designate any BDC as a least- developed beneficiary developing country (LDBDC). However, the President is expressly prohibited from designating the following developed countries as BDCs: Australia Japan Canada Monaco European Union New Zealand member states Norway Iceland Switzerland The President is also prohibited from designating any country for GSP benefits which: (1) is a communist country unless (a) its products receive non-discriminatory (MFN) treatment; (b) it is a WTO member and a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF); and (c) it is not dominated or controlled by international communism; (2) is party to an arrangement and participates in any action which withholds supplies of vital commodity resources or raises their price to unreasonable levels, causing serious disruption of the world economy; (3) affords ``reverse preferences'' to other developed countries which have or are likely to have a significant adverse effect on U.S. commerce; (4) has nationalized or expropriated U.S. property, including patents, trademarks, or copyrights, or taken actions with similar effect, unless the President determines and reports to Congress there is adequate and effective compensation, negotiations underway to provide compensation, or a dispute over compensation is in arbitration; (5) fails to recognize as binding or to enforce arbitral awards in U.S. favor; (6) aids or abets by granting sanctuary from prosecution to, any individual or group which has committed international terrorism, or is the subject of a determination by the Secretary of State under section 6(j)(1)(A) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. app. 2405) regarding repeated support for terrorism; or (7) has not taken or is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized workers rights to its workers.\\15\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ Defined by amendment under section 503 of the 1984 Act for purposes of GSP to include: ``(A) the right to association; ``(B) the right to organize and bargain collectively; ``(C) a prohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor; ``(D) a minimum age for the employment of children; and ``(E) acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health''. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The President may waive conditions (4), (5), (6), and (7), if he determines and reports with reasons to the Congress that designation of the particular country is in the national economic interest. Section 412 of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-200) added a new eligibility criterion to this list which prohits the President from designating a country for GSP benefits if it has not implemented its commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. In addition, the President must take certain other factors into account under section 502(c) in designating BDCs: (1) an expressed desire of the country to be designated; (2) the country's level of economic development; (3) whether other major developed countries extend GSP to the country; (4) the extent the country has assured the United States it will provide ``equitable and reasonable access'' to its markets and basic commodity resources and refrain from engaging in unreasonable export practices; (5) the extent the country is providing adequate and effective means under its laws for foreign nationals to secure, exercise, and enforce exclusive rights in intellectual property; (6) the extent the country has taken action to reduce trade distorting investment practices and policies and reduce or eliminate barriers to trade in services; and (7) whether the country has taken or is taking steps to afford its workers internationally-recognized worker rights. If the President determines that a BDC has become a ``high income'' country as defined by the World Bank, the President is required to remove the country from eligibility under the program. The statute provides for a transition period of up to 2 years for country graduation from the GSP program. In 1994 the World Bank designated countries with a per capita GNP of approximately $8,600 as ``high income'' countries. Before designating any country as a BDC, the President must notify the Congress of his intention and the considerations entering into the decision. Before terminating designation of any beneficiary, the President must provide the Congress and the country concerned at least 60 days advance notice of his intention, together with the reasons. The President must withdraw or suspend the designation if he determines the country no longer meets the conditions for designation. The countries currently designated as BDCs of GSP are listed under General Note 4(a) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Countries designated as LDBDCs are listed under General Note 4(b). On March 21, 1995, the President notified Congress of his determination to designate the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a beneficiary country.\\16\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ Message from the President of the United States transmitting notification of his intent to add the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2462(a), House Document 104-47, March 21, 1995. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- On June 30, 1999, pursuant to section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, President Clinton designated Gabon and Mongolia as beneficiary developing countries for purposes of GSP. He futher determined, pursuant to section 502, that GSP benefits for Mauritania, which were suspended on June 25, 1993, should be reinstated.\\17\\ On August 27, 2000, pursuant to sections 501 and 502, President Clinton designated Nigeria as a beneficiary country.\\18\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ Presidential Proclamation No. 7206, June 30, 1999, 64 Fed. Reg. 36229-36231. \\18\\ Presidential Proclamation No. 7335, August 27, 2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 52903. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Eligible articles The President designates articles under section 503 eligible for GSP duty-free treatment after considering advice required through public hearings, from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on the probable domestic economic impact, and from executive branch agencies. In general, GSP duty-free treatment is prohibited by statute on textile and apparel articles which were not eligible articles on January 1, 1994; watches, except those watches entered after June 30, 1989, that the President specifically determines, after public notice and comment, will not cause material injury to watch or watch band, strap, or bracelet manufacturing and assembly operations in the United States or U.S. insular possessions; \\19\\ import-sensitive electronic articles; import-sensitive steel articles; footwear, handbags, luggage, flat goods (e.g., wallets, change purses, eyeglass cases), work gloves, and leather wearing apparel which were ineligible for GSP as of January 1, 1995; and import-sensitive semi-manufactured and manufactured glass products. The President must also exclude any other articles he determines to be import sensitive in the context of GSP. Articles are ineligible for GSP during any period they are subject to import relief under sections 201-204 of the Trade Act of 1974 or to national security actions under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Also, no quantity of an agricultural product subject to a tariff-rate quota that exceeds the in- quota quantity may be eligible for duty-free treatment under GSP. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ This amendment was made by section 1903 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Public Law 100-418, approved August 23, 1988. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The President may designate any article that is the growth, product or manufacture of an LDBDC as an eligible article with respect to LDBDCs after receiving advice from the ITC, if he determines such an article is not import-sensitive in the context of imports from LDBDCs. However, he may not designate the statutorily exempt articles--textiles and apparel, footwear and related articles, and watches. The President must notify Congress at least 60 days in advance of LDBDC designations. The USTR has established by regulation an interagency procedure for annual review of petitions from any interested party to have articles added to, or removed from, the GSP eligible list. The interagency committee also considers modifications on its own motion. However, section 503 prohibits consideration of an article for designation of eligibility for 3 years following formal consideration and denial of that article. GSP duty-free treatment applies only to an eligible article which is the growth, product, or manufacture of a BDC (i.e., has undergone ``substantial transformation'' in an exporting BDC) \\20\\ and which meets the following rule-of-origin requirements: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ An amendment made by section 226 of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1990, Public Law 101-382, title II, approved August 20, 1990, 19 U.S.C. 2463(b), conformed GSP rules to treatment under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) the article must be imported directly from a BDC into the U.S. customs territory; and (2) the sum of (a) the cost or value of materials produced in a beneficiary country, plus (b) the direct cost of processing performed in such country is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of the article when it enters into the U.S. customs territory. Materials and processing costs in two or more beneficiary countries which are members of the same association of countries which is a customs union or free trade area may be treated as one BDC and cumulated to meet the 35 percent minimum local content. Materials imported into a BDC may be counted toward the 35 percent minimum valued-added requirement only if they are substantially transformed into new and different articles in the BDC, before they are incorporated into the GSP eligible article. Treatment of sugar imports under GSP Under the tariff-rate quota system for sugar,\\21\\ the Secretary of Agriculture establishes the quota quantity that can be entered at the lower tier import duty rate, and the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) allocates the quantity among sugar exporting quantities. The quantities allocated to beneficiary countries under the Generalized System of Preferences receive duty-free treatment. Imports above the in-quota amount from beneficiary countries are tariffed at the higher, over-quota rate. Certificates of quota eligibility (CQE) are issued to the exporting countries and must be returned with the shipment of sugar in order to receive quota treatment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ Presidential Proclamation No. 6763, December 23, 1994, 60 Fed. Reg. 1007. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Limitations on preferential treatment The President has general authority under section 503(c) to withdraw, suspend, or limit application of GSP and restore column 1 normal trade relations (NTR) or most-favored-nation (MFN) duties with respect to any article or any country after considering the factors in sections 501 and 502(c), but he cannot establish any intermediate rates of duty. Since 1981, this authority has been used in the context of the annual interagency review process for ``discretionary graduation'' from GSP of particular products from particular countries which have demonstrated their competitiveness and to promote a shifting of benefits to less advanced developing countries. Pursuant to the authority of this section, the President on January 29, 1988, notified the Congress of his intention to remove Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan from their status as beneficiaries under the GSP program,\\22\\ effective on January 2, 1989. Removal from GSP status was based on the President's assessment that these four BDCs had ``achieved an impressive level of economic development and competitiveness, which can be sustained without the preferences provided by the program.'' Similarly, on October 17, 1996, the President made a determination that Malaysia was ``sufficiently advanced in economic development and improved trade competitiveness'' and that designation of Malaysia as a beneficiary developing country would be terminated efffective January 1, 1997.\\23\\ Pursuant to 502(e) of the Act the President also determined on October 17, 1996, that Cyprus, Aruba, Macau, the Netherlands Antilles, Greenland, and the Cayman Islands meet the definition of a ``high income'' country as defined by official statistics of the World Bank, terminating preferential treatment under GSP for imports from these countries effective January 1, 1998. \\24\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\22\\ Message from the President of the United States transmitting notification of his intent to remove Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan from the list of beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2462(a), House Document 100-162, February 1, 1988. \\23\\ Presidential Proclamation No. 6942, October 17, 1996, 61 Fed.
