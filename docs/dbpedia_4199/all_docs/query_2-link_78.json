Mariner 2 flew by Venus after a 3.5-month voyage through space.\n\nMariner 2: First Spacecraft to Another Planet\n\nThe mission launched just one month after the Mariner 1 mission failed during launch. After departing from Cape Canaveral, Florida, Mariner 2 almost met the same fate when an electrical problem with the Atlas-Agena rocket caused it to start rolling, which made it unable to respond to any guidance commands from mission control.\n\nBy some miracle, the problem fixed itself, and Mariner 2 was on its way to Venus!\n\nOn This Day in Space Archive!"
