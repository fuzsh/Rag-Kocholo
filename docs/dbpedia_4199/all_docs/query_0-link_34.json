        "text": "Accountability Is the Cure for an Ailing Democracy\n\nJanuary 20, 2021\n\nTricia Olsen was quoted in “Accountability is the Cure for an Ailing Democracy” in The New Republic.\n\nInauguration Day: What can the Biden administration hope to achieve?\n\nJanuary 20, 2021\n\nNaazneen Barma co-moderated “Inauguration Day: What can the Biden administration hope to achieve?” The event was presented by The Scrivner Institute of Public Policy and the Center on American Politics.\n\nGov. Polis addresses threats regarding Colorado Capitol\n\nJanuary 15, 2021\n\nDeborah Avant appeared on Denver FOX 31 to discuss potential violence around the Inauguration at the Colorado Capitol.\n\nQ&A: Politics and Ethics in Business\n\nJanuary 14, 2021\n\nTricia Olsen was featured in the Daniels College of Business Blog.\n\nThe specter of irreparable ignorance: counterfactuals and causality in economics\n\nJanuary 8, 2021\n\nReview of Evolutionary Political Economy - Those economists who have emphasized true uncertainty have tended to draw an epistemic distinction between an ascertainable past and an unknowable future. But in one critical respect—in extracting causal relationships—that epistemic distinction is not warranted. Whether they are situated in the past or future, causal arguments in economics depend equally on counterfactual reasoning. Counterfactualizing entails the construction of fictitious narratives—narratives about worlds that do not exist. Unfortunately, there is no dependable method for ascertaining the uniquely correct counterfactual. This implies that causal claims in economics, too, are irreducibly fictitious. The chief value of counterfactuals, then, is not to prove causation but to help scholars and practitioners confront an inscrutable world—to imagine and prepare for unknowable possible futures. In this endeavor, economic pluralism, which expands the range of plausible counterfactuals, is to be taken as a virtue rather than a curse.\n\n\"Superstitions and Civilian Displacement: Evidence from the Colombian Conflict” project selected for funding\n\nJanuary 8, 2021\n\nOliver Kaplan's project on \"Superstitions and Civilian Displacement: Evidence from the Colombian Conflict” was selected for funding by the World Bank, UNHCR, and DFID program on “Preventing social conflict and promoting social cohesion in forced displacement contexts.”\n\nProfessor Avant Named President-elect of the International Studies Association\n\nJanuary 6, 2021\n\nDeborah Avant, Ph.D., has been named the President-elect of the International Studies Association (ISA) effective April 2021. Professor Avant is director and chair of the Sié Chéou-Kang Center for International Security and Diplomacy at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies.\n\nOn Inconvenient Findings\n\nJanuary 5, 2021\n\nDuck of Minerva - What happens when research findings challenge the work that policy makers are invested in promoting?\n\nIn recent years, a strong, ongoing initiative to “Bridge the Gap” between academic research and policy makers has gained salience in academic circles. For several years now, and with support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and other funders, scholars of international affairs have doubled down on efforts to write for public audiences, engage with various actors in policy processes, and even work to revise tenure and promotion standards to increase the value of policy-relevant work. Through the Women’s Rights After War project and other work, we have been eager participants in these efforts. We view engaged scholarship as part of our commitment to democratizing knowledge more generally.\n\nContesting the Fighter Identity: Framing, Desertion, and Gender in Colombia\n\nOctober 23, 2020\n\nInternational Studies Quarterly - The growing literature on desertion from insurgent groups focuses almost exclusively on male deserters, with few comparisons to combatants who choose to stay and little consideration of women combatants or the gendered norms and narratives that restrict combatants’ options. As governments increasingly emphasize “counter-narratives” to prevent radicalization and encourage disengagement from non-state armed groups, there is insufficient empirical evidence on how such framing contests between governments and insurgents might affect how recruits calculate their options. With “deradicalization” programs proliferating globally, and disarmament, disengagement, and reintegration (DDR) programs continuing to perpetuate gender stereotypes, it is critical to examine why some men and women disengage from violence while others stay, how they evaluate these decisions, and how gendered norms affect these decisions. Based on over 100 interviews with men and women ex-combatants across seven departments of Colombia, this article examines the effects of framing contests between the FARC guerrillas and the Colombian government, in which gender norms and gendered power dynamics play key roles. This paper argues that these gendered framing contests are critical to individual combatants’ disengagement decisions and, in particular, influence how women combatants perceive their alternatives and manage their exit pathways out of non-state armed groups.\n\nClimate Change as an Unconventional Security Risk\n\nOctober 23, 2020\n\nWar on the Rocks - As security threats go, climate change is not the wolf at the door, threatening to blow the house down. Rather, it is thousands of termites whose individual impacts are small and hard to see, but whose collective impact is potentially just as catastrophic. Because of the complex nature of these threats, climate change does not fit neatly into conventional security paradigms for risk mitigation or neutralization. This implies the traditional toolkit for addressing security threats will need to be augmented by a more inclusive approach to conceptualizing national security threats and the agencies tasked with addressing them.\n\nAn Age of Actorless Threats: Rethinking Nationl Security in Light of COVID and Conflict\n\nOctober 23, 2020\n\nJust Security - Climate change and the COVID pandemic are highlighting key weaknesses in U.S. national security strategy and policy. Addressing these issues will not just require making traditional national security agencies more climate- and pandemic-aware, but a reimagining of the concept of national security itself. This means everything from changing the focus of troop deployments, to altering the missions of forward and domestic bases, refocusing military research and development (R&D) spending, and refining officer education at the military academies. Beyond that, it means bringing more U.S. government agencies to the tables where national security is discussed.\n\nFear of Election Unrest is Driving a Boom in Private Security\n\nOctober 22, 2020\n\nBuzzFeed News - “I am concerned,” said Deborah Avant, a professor at the University of Denver who runs the school’s Center for International Security, “given both the unevenness of regulation around the country and reports of links between police forces and right-leaning extremist groups, which may lead private security to be a mechanism for pursuing extreme ‘law and order’ actions.”\n\nState Department has a crucial role in climate change and protecting the environment\n\nOctober 20, 2020\n\nPeterson Institute for International Economics - MEMORANDUM ON State Department Priorities for Rebuilding the Global Economy. To: The Assistant Secretaries of State for the Bureaus of Energy Resources and Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs.\n\nUsing City Diplomacy to Address Policing Reform and Racial Justice\n\nOctober 5, 2020\n\nUSC Center on Public Diplomacy - Mayors are on the global stage now, more than ever. The conduct of diplomacy of cities can both reinforce local priorities, frame global policy at the local level and move policy in the face of Washington intransigence. The future of diplomacy runs through cities. Beyond the challenges of climate change or city recovery from COVID-19, recent civic tumult on racial justice and police brutality should also cause local leaders, especially those engaged in city public diplomacy, to ask “how can I use my platform to address systemic injustice?” For municipal offices advising their councils and mayors on international affairs, trade, or intergovernmental affairs, there are several avenues that cities can pursue to leverage city-based public diplomacy to advance racial justice and police reform. This is a pivotal task, especially since American foreign policy has treated policing as a central pillar of nation-building. From setting up colonial police forces in Central American and the Caribbean to police training, recruitment and arming campaigns in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, policing and diplomacy are inexorably tied. City diplomacy can engage police issues differently.\n\nJoint management of shared resources as an alternative approach for addressing maritime boundary disputes: the Kenya-Somalia maritime boundary dispute\n\nOctober 2, 2020\n\nJournal of the Indian Ocean Region - Socio-economic security has motivated African states to explore natural resources in areas of overlapping maritime claims. However, Africa’s maritime boundaries are characterized by unresolved disputes. Resolution of these disputes is time-consuming, expensive and can undermine the state’s ability to exploit natural resources. The Somalia and Kenya maritime dispute under litigation with the International Court of Justice demonstrates the continental commitment to peaceful resolution. Citing cases from across Africa, we discuss outright delimitation or Joint Management Zones (JMZs) as means to address disputes over shared resources, particularly transboundary fisheries, which have received little attention. Reframing the Kenya-Somalia maritime dispute resolution process as cooperation over fisheries management will have spill-over effects into greater diplomatic relations. Fish do not abide by maritime boundaries. As such, we posit that the peaceful resolution of maritime boundary disputes lies in Africa’s ability to consider settlements by way of JMZs to motivate sustainable use of natural resources.\n\nAmerica's Pragmatic Role\n\nSeptember 28, 2020\n\nInternational Studies Review - What has made the United States a global leader? Though analysts often attribute American success to a combination of resources and ideas, a subtle undercurrent in these arguments points to pragmatism and the creativity it often generates as an important part of the story. First theorized by American philosophers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, pragmatism emphasizes that creativity can reshape how we see norms and interests to make cooperation more likely. After discussing the basic elements of pragmatism and its intersection with prominent international relations arguments, I show how the creativity that pragmatism envisions appears in each of these books. Though the collected authors do not label themselves as pragmatists, piecing these pragmatic elements together demonstrates the importance of creativity for key global leadership moments in the twentieth century, as well as important, if under-appreciated, governance innovations in the twenty-first century. It also offers insights into how the United States might move into the future.\n\nBeyond IR's Ivory Tower\n\nSeptember 28, 2020\n\nForeign Policy - For years, prominent international relations (IR) scholars have openly criticized the field for privileging “rigor over relevance,” offering little practical advice to those who live and work outside the ivory tower. For example, Stephen Van Evera, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argues that traditional academic disciplines and incentives promote a “cult of the irrelevant”—“an internal discussion of arcane questions that the wider world is not asking.” On the other hand, scholars such as Ido Oren and Adam Elkus reject the idea that political scientists should make themselves policy-relevant and argue that doing so biases political science by encouraging academics to cater to the “whims of elite governmental policymakers.”\n\nWHEN QUOTAS COME UP SHORT\n\nSeptember 14, 2020\n\nBoston Review - Much has been written about the benefits of electing women to office. Scholars note links between women’s political representation and the stability of states, the likelihood of peace, the prioritization of social welfare programs, and even economic growth. In recent decades, a number of countries recovering from war have linked their constitutional and government overhauls with gender equality initiatives. Many now have higher rates of women in politics, largely as a result of these efforts. As we have explored in our past work, war can create unexpected opportunities to shift traditional power relations.\n\nMALI’S COUP: HARBINGER OF HOPE OR UNCERTAINTY\n\nSeptember 10, 2020\n\nUnited States Institute of Peace - Last year was one of the most dramatic years of nonviolent action in recent memory, with millions taking to the streets to push for greater economic equality, democratic representation, and social justice. Some of the most dramatic uprisings took place in Africa, where longstanding repressive political regimes were forced from power in Sudan and Algeria, and protests over fuel prices in Zimbabwe led to a government crackdown. The recent almost entirely bloodless coup in Mali, in which soldiers abducted President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and forced him to resign capped a similar uprising, but is complicated by the role of the military in the president’s ouster and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRENEWABLE OR SUSTAINABLE? GREEN ENERGY IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN YOU THINK\n\nSeptember 2, 2020\n\nDuck of Minerva - On 30 June, House Democrats released a climate plan aimed at eliminating the U.S. economy’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The plan mandates sweeping shifts towards clean and renewable energy, with U.S. automakers transitioning to solely electric vehicle production and electric utility providers operating as net-zero emitters, all in the name of making America’s economy more sustainable.\n\nOPINION: LET'S TRY TO BE CIVIL ENOUGH TO KEEP ARGUING\n\nNovember 18, 2019\n\nColorado Sun - In the midst of one after another political slight, I cannot stop thinking of something my colleague and prominent blogger, Seth Masket, posted on his Facebook page earlier this year. The comment got a few laughs and sarcastic comments like \"low bar,\" but recent research suggests this action is worthy of more serious attention.\n\nEVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT POLICY ENGAGEMENT* (*BUT WERE TOO AFRAID TO ASK)\n\nNovember 18, 2019\n\nDuck of Minerva - Earlier this year, our team at the Sié Center at the University of Denver announced our program on the three R's of Academic-Policy Engagement (or R3, if you prefer): Rigor, Relevance, and Responsibility. Generously supported by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, our program is intended to both study and help train early-career scholars around the ethical issues that arise when academics—who face ever-increasing pressures to demonstrate the broader social impacts of their research—attempt to interface with policy audiences. Broadly speaking, our scholarly community is doing a good job of training scholars to engage: initiatives like the Bridging the Gap Project (BtG) have been massively successful in demystifying the mechanics of engagement: how to write for policy audiences, give good interviews, etc. BtG now has over 100 alums who are doing an excellent job of making IR scholarship legible for policy and general audiences.\n\nNOT COOL EP 22: CULLEN HENDRIX ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND ARMED CONFLICT\n\nNovember 13, 2019\n\nFuture of Life Insititute - Right before civil war broke out in 2011, Syria experienced a historic five-year drought. This particular drought, which exacerbated economic and political insecurity within the country, may or may not have been caused by climate change. But as climate change increases the frequency of such extreme events, it's almost certain to inflame pre-existing tensions in other countries — and in some cases, to trigger armed conflict. On Not Cool episode 22, Ariel is joined by Cullen Hendrix, co-author of \"Climate as a risk factor for armed conflict.\" Cullen, who serves as Director of the Sié Chéou-Kang Center for International Security and Diplomacy and Senior Research Advisor at the Center for Climate & Security, explains the main drivers of conflict and the impact that climate change may have on them. He also discusses the role of climate change in current conflicts like those in Syria, Yemen, and northern Nigeria; the political implications of such conflicts for Europe and other developed regions; and the chance that climate change might ultimately foster cooperation.\n\nLIBYA'S COMPETING GOVERNMENTS CONTEND FOR WASHINGTON INFLUENCE\n\nNovember 8, 2019\n\nVoice of America - The Libyan civil war has found a new battlefield: the halls of Washington. The eight-year conflict shows little sign of ending, and the warring governments are stepping up their efforts to influence policymakers in the United States.\n\nA THIRD OF THE WORLD HAS ORGANIZED IN MASS PROTEST\n\nNovember 7, 2019\n\nDU Clarion - Fifteen out of those seventeen countries have used tear gas against their own people over the course of these protests; only the United States and the United Kingdom have not. This is despite the fact that in the 1925 Geneva Protocol, the use of tear gas against enemy combatants was outlawed. Some countries' governments such as Haiti and Iraq have used live ammunition against their own unarmed people.\n\nWOMEN GATHER IN DENVER TO WORK TOWARD SOCIAL CHANGE & PEACE\n\nAugust 23, 2019\n\nColorado Public Radio - In Syria, when Rajaa Altalli was 12 years old, she saw her father arrested for being an activist. Years later, her sister was forced out the country for her work as a human rights lawyer. Despite that, Altalli still fights for peace in her home country. And now she's here in Colorado to continue that work. She is the co-founder of the Center for Civil Society and Democracy that aims to create peace in Syria. She's also one of 16 women from 15 countries around the world who are in Colorado, focused on social change and international women's leadership. It's part of the University of Denver's Summer institute. Marie Berry is a professor at D.U. and the institute's director. Both women join us to talk about the mission and the message of this project.\n\nREASSESSING SAMPLING BIAS IN CLIMATE-CONFLICT RESEARCH\n\nAugust 22, 2019\n\nSSRN - Is research into the links between climate change and conflict biased, and does this bias undermine our ability to draw conclusions about climate-conflict links? Adams et al. (2018, henceforth AIBD) argue the literature on climate-conflict links suffers from endemic sample selection bias. Because of this, the literature overstates links between climate change and conflict.\n\nSUMMER INSTITUTE BRINGS WOMEN ACTIVISTS TOGETHER FOR TRAINING AND SISTERHOOD\n\nAugust 21, 2019\n\nUniversity of Denver - This year's weeklong gathering will be third for the initiative, known as IGLI, and its first held in partnership with USIP. The 15-17 activists (and one DU graduate student) will spend the beginning of the week at a retreat in the Colorado mountains, benefiting from training on civil resistance and building peace, as well as resiliency and self-care practices such as yoga, hiking and art. Then the activists fly to Washington, D.C., where the training continues at USIP headquarters and the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\nWOMEN ACTIVISTS FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE GATHER IN DENVER FOR ANNUAL INCLUSIVE GLOBAL LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE SUMMER INSTITUTE\n\nAugust 15, 2019\n\nSié-Chéou Kang Center for International Security & Diplomacy - Leading women activists to convene with University of Denver scholars in partnership with the United States Institute of Peace for advanced training on leading movements for social change.\n\nIN SEARCH OF CONSENSUS ON CLIMATE-CONFLICT LINKS\n\nAugust 12, 2019\n\nNew Security Beat - What do we (think we) know about the links between climate change and armed conflict? Early attempts to theorize what climate-related conflict might look like were exceptionally successful in sparking policymaker interest in and funding of research on climate-conflict links. But they were more like works of science fiction than science. Since then, research on climate-conflict links has exploded, with hundreds of articles and working papers published on the subject. Moreover, the findings have been all over the map, with some arguing for strong impacts of climate on conflict at multiple temporal and spatial scales, while others argue—in both specific instances, about the supposedly climate-fueled Syrian Civil War, and more generally—that climate-conflict links are overstated.\n\nPEELING BACK THE LAYERS ON THE ROLE OF PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES IN AFRICA\n\nAugust 4, 2019\n\nThe Conversation - Private military and security companies have been regular fixtures in conflicts across the globe. For Africa, these corporations became increasingly visible with their role in civil wars in Angola and Sierra Leone. More recently, reports in 2015 indicated the Nigerian government contracted a number of companies to aid in counterinsurgency efforts targeting Boko Haram.\n\nREFLEXIVITY AND TEMPORALITY IN RESEARCHING VIOLENT SETTINGS: PROBLEMS WITH THE REPLICABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY REGIME\n\nJuly 23, 2019\n\nGeopolitics - Researchers studying conflict, violence, and human rights in dangerous settings across the globe face a complex set of ethical, personal, and professional dilemmas. Especially in more positivist fields and professions, there is pressure to conduct and present research as 'objective'. Yet the reality of field research in violent and conflict-affected settings is much messier than ideals in methodology textbooks or the polished presentation of field data in much published work.\n\nKEEPING UP WITH THE FUTURE: UPGRADING FORECASTS OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND GEOPOLITICAL RISK\n\nJuly 17, 2019\n\nPeterson Institute for International Economics - The nature and magnitude of geopolitical risk is changing more rapidly than the ability to anticipate it, with increasingly severe economic consequences. This Policy Brief discusses the economic costs and risks associated with episodes of political instability, arguing that firms, government agencies, and international institutions must update their forecasting and risk assessment efforts to take global factors into account. Since the global financial crisis, political instability has shifted from emerging-market countries in the developing world to larger, more globally impactful econo¬mies. Acknowledging this changing risk profile—and developing better tools to predict major episodes of instability—will allow both policymakers and firms to plan with greater confidence.\n\n\"IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO REPHRASE THAT COMMENT\"\n\nJuly 17, 2019\n\nABC News - A straightforward look at the day's top news in 20 minutes. Powered by ABC News. Hosted by Brad Mielke.\n\nDEMOCRATS SHOULD STOP WHINING ABOUT THE DEBATES\n\nJuly 11, 2019\n\nBloomberg - The question is whether the party should hold a nomination debate focused solely on climate change, as Washington Governor Jay Inslee and others have argued. That's produced some push-back. Jonathan Chait, for example, is concerned about a slippery slope: If one group of advocates gets a debate dedicated to their preferred issue, then won't the party have to accommodate every other interest group?\n\nFINDING CONSENSUS ON CLIMATE-CONFLICT LINKS\n\nJuly 11, 2019\n\nThe Center for Climate & Security - Today's issue of Nature reports the results of an attempt to mine the scholarly debate over climate-conflict links for consensus using \"expert elicitation.\" The process, led by Katharine Mach of Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, brought together experts from economics, geography and political science to identify sources of agreement and disagreement in the now large body of evidence linking climate change to conflict – in this case, domestic armed conflict, like the ongoing civil wars in Syria and Yemen.\n\nWILL CLIMATE CHANGE LEAD TO MORE WORLD CONFLICT?\n\nJuly 11, 2019\n\nWashington Post's Monkey Cage - During last month's U.S. Democratic presidential candidate debates, former congressman Beto O'Rourke, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro all identified climate change as a major geopolitical threat facing the United States. Some even gave it equal billing with China and the prospect of nuclear war.\n\nTHE COST OF DOING POLITICS? ANALYZING VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT AGAINST FEMALE POLITICIANS\n\nJuly 6, 2019\n\nPerspective on Politics - Violence against women in politics is increasingly recognized around the world as a significant barrier to women's political participation, following a troubling rise in reports of assault, intimidation, and abuse directed at female politicians. Yet conceptual ambiguities remain as to the exact contours of this phenomenon. In this article, we seek to strengthen its theoretical, empirical, and methodological foundations.\n\nDU PROFESSOR EXPLORES LINK BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND ARMED CONFLICT\n\nJuly 2, 2019\n\nDU News - Conflict and climate change have been linked for decades, with Pentagon-commissioned studies predicting a range of dark scenarios — from shooting wars in South Asia and civil war in China to the breakup of the European Union.\n\nAlthough climate change remains a significant threat to peace, the picture may not be quite so dire, says the University of Denver's Cullen Hendrix, an associate professor in the Josef Korbel School of International Studies and director of the Sié Chéou-Kang Center for International Security and Diplomacy. He lent his expertise to a recently published study in the renowned scientific journal Nature.\n\nHOW DANGEROUS WAS KARGIL? NUCLEAR CRISES IN COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE\n\nJune 28, 2019\n\nWashington Quarterly - Between May and June of 1999, India and Pakistan engaged in a higher-intensity military conflict than any other pair of nuclear-armed states had before or have since. Although it remained geographically contained, the Kargil War resulted in hundreds of casualties on both sides and saw frantic diplomatic intervention by the United States in an effort to de-escalate the conflict. It is therefore unsurprising that the Kargil War is commonly seen as one of the few occasions that the world has come close to nuclear war, and perhaps second only to the Cuban Missile Crisis in terms of the risk of nuclear escalation. In the years since, India and Pakistan have engaged in repeated skirmishes, crises, and periods of tension, with the two countries again coming into conflict in the spring of 2019 in response to a deadly attack on Indian military forces by the Pakistan-backed terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed.\n\nWHAT FOOD PRICE-RELATED PROTESTS IN SUDAN AND LIBERIA TELL US ABOUT HOW AUTOCRACIES AND DEMOCRACIES ADDRESS PRICE CRISES\n\nJune 25, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - As one of the world's most talented footballers of the 1990s, Liberian President George Weah is no stranger to roaring crowds. But recently, these crowds were less than supportive: Weah's administration has faced mass protests—and threats of more to come—due to its inability to address skyrocketing inflation and food prices.\n\nWHAT PREVENTS PEACE? WOMEN AND PEACEBUILDING IN BOSNIA AND NEPAL\n\nJune 22, 2019\n\nPeace and Change - There is an emerging consensus that women must play a more substantial role in transformations from violence to stability. The UN Women, Peace, and Security framework recognizes the unique challenges women face during war and affirms the important role they play in the prevention and resolution of conflicts. Despite this framework and other related efforts, peace remains elusive for many who have lived through armed conflict. What prevents formal, internationally led peacebuilding efforts from fostering sustainable peace in ordinary citizens' lives? Put differently, despite the variety of peacebuilding mechanisms offered, what prevents peace from taking hold, for women in particular? In this paper, we focus on two postwar cases: Bosnia and Nepal. Drawing on interviews with more than seventy women in both countries, we identify five barriers that prevent women from feeling at peace in their daily lives: economic insecurity, competing truths, hierarchies of victimhood, continuums of violence, and spatial and temporal dislocation. We conclude by outlining ways that women in both countries work to overcome those barriers by pioneering innovations in peacebuilding, which may reveal possibilities for future interventions.\n\nWHEN NORMS COLLIDE: BUSINESS, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN COLOMBIA\n\nJune 21, 2019\n\nCenter for Security Studies - This fall will mark three years since the Colombian Peace Accord between the government of Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC guerrilla group was ceremoniously signed in Havana, Cuba. It was unique for a variety of reasons: it ended the world's longest-running civil war, it was signed with the world's oldest guerrilla group (the FARC), and—what few know—is that it is also the first peace process that explicitly includes economic actors in the truth and accountability mechanisms to help the country transition to peace.\n\nRESPONSIBLE POLICY ENGAGEMENT: SOME CHALLENGES\n\nJune 19, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - Last month, the team at the Sié Center introduced our program on Rigor, Relevance, and Responsibility: Promoting Ethical Approaches to Policy Engagement. Via this work, we hope to help scholars navigate the sometimes murky waters of policy engagement (or \"broader impacts\") in which funding agencies and universities are increasingly asking them to swim. When we take an active role in affecting policy outcomes, we onboard some responsibility for those outcomes.\n\nCU BOULDER PROFESSOR ADDS TO STUDY SHOWING CLIMATE CHANGE, CONFLICT LINK\n\nJune 17, 2019\n\nDaily Camera - Imagine rising temperatures across the globe exacerbating armed conflicts in countries with limited resources. According to researchers and experts, including scientists from the University of Colorado Boulder and Stanford University, this scenario could easily become reality, rather than a plot for the next \"Mad Max\" film.\n\nTHE \"DEPORTATION THREAT DYNAMIC\" AND WAGE THEFT IN DENVER\n\nJune 14, 2019\n\nJust Wages DU - \"Employers look at someone who doesn't have papers and feel like they have more power. Right now, we have a racist government, so racism grows,\" a day laborer in Aurora, CO, explained how the current immigration climate enhances the exploitation of, and discrimination against, immigrant workers.\n\nCLIMATE AS A RISK FACTOR FOR ARMED CONFLICT\n\nJune 12, 2019\n\nNature - Research findings on the relationship between climate and conflict are diverse and contested. Here we assess the current understanding of the relationship between climate and conflict, based on the structured judgments of experts from diverse disciplines. These experts agree that climate has affected organized armed conflict within countries. However, other drivers, such as low socioeconomic development and low capabilities of the state, are judged to be substantially more influential, and the mechanisms of climate–conflict linkages remain a key uncertainty. Intensifying climate change is estimated to increase future risks of conflict.\n\nPress release here >>\n\nOLIVER KAPLAN'S BOOK WAS IN THE UCSD ALUMNI MAGAZINE, \"ON THE SHELF\"\n\nJune 4, 2019\n\nTriton Magazine - Kaplan contests the typical depiction of civilian populations as victims by explaining how unarmed communities protect themselves from civil conflict and pressure armed groups to limit their violence. Looking at cases of Colombia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, Resisting War counters the traditional narrative and provides further understanding to the story of human struggle and survival during wartime.\n\nMARIE BERRY'S BOOK, WAR, WOMEN AND POWER: FROM VIOLENCE TO MOBILIZATION IN RWANDA AND BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, WAS AWARDED A BOOK AWARD HONORABLE MENTION FROM THE SOCIOLOGY OF DEVELOPMENT SECTION.\n\nJune 4, 2019\n\nABORTION RESTRICTIONS AS STATE VIOLENCE\n\nJune 4, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - The alarming rollback of abortion rights in Georgia, Alabama, Missouri and elsewhere over the past few weeks has rightfully provoked outrage and alarm among those concerned with women's rights around the globe. What people are not speaking about is how this is a form of state violence.\n\nWHEN NORMS COLLIDE: BUSINESS, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN COLOMBIA\n\nMay 28, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - This fall will mark three years since the Colombian Peace Accord between the government of Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC guerrilla group was ceremoniously signed in Havana, Cuba. It was unique for a variety of reasons: it ended the world's longest-running civil war, it was signed with the world's oldest guerrilla group (the FARC), and—what few know—is that it is also the first peace process that explicitly includes economic actors in the truth and accountability mechanisms to help the country transition to peace.\n\n** A Spanish-language version of this post is available below the English version (hay una versión Espanñol de este artículo abajo.)\n\nHOW DO YOU REDUCE SEXUAL AND GENDER VIOLENCE IN CONFLICT? CONSIDER THESE FIVE KEY ISSUES.\n\nMay 22, 2019\n\nWashington Post - How do you stop — or at least mitigate — the harm done by sexual and gendered violence in humanitarian crises? That's the topic for this week's international conference in Oslo, where governments, United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations are coming together to discuss commitments and solutions.\n\nRESISTING WAR AND WAR, WOMEN, AND POWER BOOK REVIEWS IN MOBILIZATION\n\nMay 22, 2019\n\nCONSIDERING POWER IMBALANCES IN COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH\n\nMay 15, 2019\n\nRift Valley Institute - This blog is part of RVI's Research Collaboration project in partnership with the Groupe d'Etudes sur les Conflits et la Sécurité Humaine (GEC-SH) and funded by the Knowledge Management Fund of KPSRL. The project examines the political economy of knowledge production and its impact on the security of researchers in conflict-affected settings, and in turn, the quality of the research that is produced. Specifically, the project focuses on the experiences of Congolese researchers working on collaborative Global North-South projects and aims to contribute to the conversation on research ethics, collaboration and decolonizing knowledge. Interviews and focus group discussions were conducted by the GEC-SH team in March and April 2019. The project takes the position that all forms of research whereby a researcher or institution relies on another researcher or institution for access, data collection and analysis, translation, transcription, writing, or other form of knowledge production or sharing can be considered collaborative. As such, the project examines various forms of collaborative research, whether short-term consultancies or long-term partnerships, in an effort to combat extractive forms of research.\n\nRESISTING WAR IN COLOMBIA\n\nMay 14, 2019\n\nColombia Calling Podcast - Oliver Kaplan is an Assistant Professor at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver. He is the author of the book, \"Resisting War: How Communities Protect Themselves\" (Cambridge University Press), which examines how civilian communities organize to protect themselves from wartime violence.\n\nWHAT TO DO WHEN WOMEN POLITICIANS ARE ATTACKED? HERE ARE FOUR IDEAS FROM AROUND THE WORLD\n\nMay 14, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - In a previous post, I discussed how women elected to public office often face forms of violence and harassment that their male counterparts do not face. Practitioners and academics studying this problem refer to it as violence against women in politics (VAWIP). In that post, I predicted that recently elected US Congresswomen would face harassment and violence.\n\nRadicalization in the German Armed Forces and Beyond\n\nMay 9, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - Question: Back in 2017, a German army lieutenant in the Bundeswehr, Franco Albrecht, was arrested for creating a fake asylum-seeker identity in Germany. Albrecht's larger objective was, as a refugee imposter with a government stipend and asylum-seeker housing, to carry out a terrorist plot in order to bring disrepute to refugees more generally, particularly Muslim populations from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. Are such conspiracies symptomatic of a larger phenomenon of military radicalization in the German armed forces, or was this an isolated incident?\n\nAUTHORITARIAN RESILIENCE: WHY BOUTEFLIKA AND BASHIR FELL, BUT ORTEGA REMAINS\n\nMay 1, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - April saw protestors—with an assist from the military—oust longtime authoritarian leaders Abdelaziz Bouteflika in Algeria and Omar al-Bashir in Sudan, despite the dictators' best efforts. There is a great deal of uncertainty about the future in each of the countries, with the possibility for a military seizure of power, like in Egypt's counterrevolution, or the reassertion of control by ancien régime officials, like in Zimbabwe. For the moment, at least, the sight of Bashir in prison and a planned military-civilian shared transitional council in Sudan and the possibility of democratic elections in Algeria is a cause of hope. Both outcomes are also a sign of the enduring possibility for unarmed 'people power' movements to effect leadership transitions and possibly regime change.\n\nELECTIONS SOUTH AFRICA 2019: 25 YEARS \"POST-APARTHEID,\" LA LUTA CONTINUA...\n\nApril 23, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - As South Africa prepares for general elections on May 8, the \"beloved country\" marks another milestone: its first 25 years post-apartheid. Two-and-a-half decades ago, the long-troubled country emerged from some five decades of white minority rule under an abhorrent system of racial segregation, apartheid, and centuries of colonialism before that.\n\nBOOK REVIEW FOR \"RESISTING WAR: HOW COMMUNITIES PROTECT THEMSELVES\"\n\nApril 22, 2019\n\nPeacebuilding Journal - In Resisting War, Oliver Kaplan flips the traditional analysis of peacemaking on its head by examining how local communities actively engage in reducing violence during times of civil conflict. His main argument centres around a contention that civilians are actors with agency, whose ability to successfully respond to violence derives in part from strong social organisation. Resisting War centres on this question of local organization, when and why does it take place and, to a lesser extent, when and why is it successful.\n\nYEAR OF THE WOMAN? NOT SO FAST\n\nApril 16, 2019\n\nPsychology Today - Thanks to the record-breaking number of women elected to Congress in 2018 and the success of the #MeToo movement in taking down many powerful male predators, some critics have called 2018 the Year of the Woman.\n\n25 YEARS AFTER THE GENOCIDE – QUOTA, POWER AND WOMEN IN RWANDA\n\nApril 12, 2019\n\nThe Wire - April 7, 2019, marked the 25-year anniversary of the start of the Rwandan genocide against the Tutsis, a brutal conflict where 800,000 people were massacred in 100 days, according to the UN estimates. President Paul Kagame, who has led Rwanda since 2000, lit a remembrance flame in the capital Kigali. \"In 1994, there was no hope, only darkness. Today, light radiates from this place,\" Kagame said. \"Rwanda became a family, once again. The arms of our people, intertwined, constitute the pillars of our nation. We hold each other up.\"\n\nONE OUTCOME OF RWANDA GENOCIDE 25 YEARS AGO: MORE WOMEN IN PARLIAMENT\n\nApril 8, 2019\n\nVOA News - The genocide in Rwanda 25 years ago left an estimated 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, dead. Since then, Rwanda has made progress in recovering from the devastation, growing its economy with GDP growth of six to eight percent a year since 2003, according to the World Bank. Also, Rwanda now has the highest percentage of female parliamentarians in the world - more than 60 percent.\n\n\"I DON'T BELONG HERE\": UNDERSTANDING HOSTILE SPACES\n\nApril 2, 2019\n\nJournal of Women, Politics and Policy - This panel offered different perspectives from people from marginalized and underrepresented groups in political science and in academia more generally. Panelists spoke from their experiences as Black and Latina women, LGBTQ,\n\nlow-income people, religious minorities like Jewish and Muslim people, immigrants, and folks who have experienced systematic discrimination in the discipline both because they exist at the busy intersections of these identities and others and because legalistic responses to discrimination do not typically provide necessary workplace remedies for industry-wide problems.\n\n#METOO WHAT KIND OF POLITICS? PANEL NOTES\n\nApril 2, 2019\n\nJournal of Women, Politics and Policy - This panel offered different perspectives on the #MeToo hashtag, the campaign/movement it ignited, and the general context in which women decide to come out with their experiences with sexual harassment and assault. In general, the panelists were very critical of the #MeToo \"movement\" because it is focused on individual experiences of sexual harassment without challenging or questioning the structures—socioeconomic and political—that facilitate sexual harassment in the first place.\n\nFROM JOSEPH KONY TO NILE PERCH: COMPLEX LINKS HOOK ARMED CONFLICT TO FISHERIES\n\nApril 1, 2019\n\nNew Security Beat - In \"Africa's smallest war,\" both Kenya and Uganda lay claim to Migingo Island, a tiny island in the waters of Lake Victoria. While the claims are over the island, the conflict is about something else entirely: Lates niloticus, also known as Nile perch, a tasty white fish that swims in the waters surrounding the island. The fish forms the backbone of the Lake Victoria economy but is increasingly hard to come by along the lakeshore. Catches are in decline, incomes are dropping, and the Ugandan government is taking increasingly harsh, militarized steps to help revive the fishery.\n\nRWANDA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS GIVEN ITS STRONG STATE EVEN MORE POWER\n\nMarch 26, 2019\n\nThe Nerve Africa - Rwanda has emerged as a model for economic development. The country has taken great strides just 25 years since its horrific genocide. But at the same time, the government under President Paul Kagame has been widely criticised for its authoritarian tactics and use of violence against those who oppose it.\n\nRwanda stands out for many good things. It has the highest number of women in politics anywhere in the world. More than half the members of Parliament in the country's lower house are female.\n\nRwanda also has an impressive technology track record. The country is known for the innovative use of technology to deliver essential services like blood. It also has extensive internet infrastructure, which covers over 95% of the country. And of course, Rwanda also continues to record impressive economic growth.But there are reasons to be cognisant of the wider context.\n\nTHE MUELLER REPORT AND GLOBAL CONTENTIOUS POLITICS\n\nMarch 26, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - As we begin to digest Attorney General William Barr's summary of the Mueller Report's findings, one thing is crystal clear: allies of Putin, private companies, and other interested parties outside the United States sought, and had, influence over US elections. Henry Farrell and Abe Newman argue in Of Privacy and Power that we had better get used to this. US domestic politics is not its own separate sphere as academics often assume. Instead, it can be deeply affected by political strategies of non-citizens quite removed from US territory. Far beyond the transnational activists that Keck and Sikkink wrote about, there is growing evidence that many, many transnational links are impacting political struggles as political actors can (as Farrell and Newman say in a related article) \"weaponize interdependence\".\n\nHOW TO THINK ABOUT NUCLEAR CRISES\n\nMarch 2019\n\nTexas National Security Review - How dangerous are nuclear crises? What dynamics underpin how they unfold? Recent tensions between North Korea and the United States have exposed disagreement among scholars and analysts regarding these questions. We reconcile these apparently contradictory views by showing the circumstances in which different models of nuclear crises should be expected to hold. Nuclear crises should be expected to have different dynamics depending on two variables: the incentives to use nuclear weapons first in a crisis and the extent to which escalation is controllable by the leaders involved. Variation across these two dimensions generates four types of nuclear crises: \"staircase,\" \"stability-instability,\" \"brinkmanship,\" and \"firestorm\" crises. These models correspond to well-established ways of thinking about nuclear crises, but no one model is \"correct.\" Different models should be expected to apply in different cases, and nuclear crises should therefore be interpreted differently according to which model is most appropriate. We demonstrate the utility of our framework using the cases of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, 1999 Kargil War, 2017 Doklam Crisis, and ongoing U.S.-North Korean tensions.\n\nRWANDA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS GIVEN ITS STRONG STATE EVEN MORE POWER\n\nMarch 25, 2019\n\nThe Conversation - Rwanda has emerged as a model for economic development. The country has taken great strides just 25 years since its horrific genocide. But at the same time the government under President Paul Kagame has been widely criticised for its authoritarian tactics and use of violence against those who oppose it.\n\nRwanda stands out for many good things. It has the highest number of women in politics anywhere in the world. More than half the members of Parliament in the country's lower house are female.\n\nRwanda also has an impressive technology track record. The country is known for the innovative use of technology to deliver essential services like blood. It also has extensive internet infrastructure, which covers over 95% of the country. And of course, Rwanda also continues to record impressive economic growth.\n\nBut there are reasons to be cognisant of the wider context.\n\nWOMEN'S POLITICAL INCLUSION IN KENYA'S DEVOLVED POLITICAL SYSTEM\n\nMarch 20, 2019\n\nJournal of East African Studies - Kenya's 2010 constitutional reforms devolved the political system and included a quota designed to secure a minimum threshold of women in government. While the 2017 elections yielded the country's highest proportion of women in government in history via both elected and appointed positions, many political entities still fell short of the new gender rule, leaving them in noncompliance with the constitution.\n\nTRICIA OLSEN HAS BEEN AWARDED A FULBRIGHT FOR STUDYING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PEACEBUILDING IN COLOMBIA AT PONTIFICAL JAVERIANA UNIVERSITY.\n\nMarch 16, 2019\n\nON HOW MEHDI HASAN CAUGHT ERIK PRINCE IN A LIE\n\nMarch 16, 2019\n\nAl Jazeera - On March 15, Mehdi Hasan interviewed Erik Prince on the Al Jazeera show Head to Head. Much as the show's title suggests, Hasan is a hard-hitting questioner eager for that \"got you\" moment. Hasan was well prepared with Prince's congressional testimony in hand and appears to have caught Prince in some double talk about an August 3, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower (with George Nader, Joel Zamel, Steven Miller, and Donald Trump Jr). In the interview, Prince, after he mistakenly asserted he had told Congress about the meeting, also disclosed what the meeting was about: Iran policy.\n\nTEMPER THE TREATY FEVER: WHY A TREATY WON'T SOLVE THE BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS CONUNDRUM\n\nMarch 13, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - Human rights advocates, observers, and policy leaders have made great strides toward creating a treaty for business and human rights. In October 2018, the UN's intergovernmental working group shared an initial draft (the \"Zero Draft\"), which was discussed by over 400 civil society organizations, 94 state representatives, and business leaders in Geneva. Yet, an established body of literature documents the ineffectiveness of treaties, in particular around respect for human rights.\n\nTOP 12 BOOKS: INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\nMarch 8, 2019\n\nMedium - 'As a country transitions from violent conflict to \"peace\", men and women often have different visions for the postwar future. Marie E. Berry's well-researched book is a comparative study not only of the ways in which women responded to the wars in Rwanda and Bosnia, but also of what happened to the women and their visions for the future after the war officially ended.'\n\nETHNICITY, NONVIOLENT PROTEST, AND LETHAL REPRESSION IN AFRICA\n\nMarch 5, 2019\n\nJournal of Peace Research - Why do governments use deadly force against unarmed protesters? The government's threat perception may be a function of the mobilization potential of the opposition and/or the size of the ruling elite's support coalition. Given the high salience of ethnicity in African politics, governments that depend on small ethnic coalitions will see peaceful protests as more threatening, as the opposition may be able to draw on larger numbers of potential dissidents and excluded groups.\n\nDESPITE ITS ADVANCES, THE COLOMBIAN PEACE AGREEMENT UNDERMINES GENDER EQUALITY GOALS\n\nMarch 5, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - In 2016 the government of Colombia signed a peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Peace Agreement represents an important threshold as it puts an end to more than 50 years of struggle between the Colombian state and the FARC. At the same time, this document is the most gender-sensitive peace agreement to date. This achievement was possible, in part, because of the work of feminist activists and women's organizations that pressured both the government and the FARC to include women.\n\nINTRODUCING THE 2019 PUBLIC IMPACT FELLOWS\n\nMarch 4, 2019\n\nUniversity of Denver - Deborah Avant and Marie Berry chosen for the 2019 cohort of DU Impact Fellows.\n\nTHE GROWING SIGNS OF THE FRAGILITY AND RESILIENCE OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY\n\nMarch 1, 2019\n\nInternational Centre for Defence and Security - In order to better understand the resilience of a democratic regime and its defining and characteristic features, we need to define what resilience is. Resilience comes from the Latin resiliens, which literally means \"rebounding\". This shows that the basis of the concept of resilience is the capability of a strained body to recover its size and shape after deformation caused especially by compressive stress (Merriam-Webster dictionary). In the 2017 IDEA report, Timothy Sisk describes the resilience of democracy as \"the properties of a political system to cope, survive and recover from complex challenges and crises that represent stresses or pressures that can lead to a systemic failure.\"\n\nFLYING BLIND IN CRISIS TIME: THE US STRATEGIC AND HUMAN FOREIGN POLICY DEFICIT\n\nFebruary 28, 2019\n\nDuck of Minerva - This week has seen a number of key events and crises in global politics that have made crystal clear once again the careening mess that is US foreign policy under the current administration. The Trump administration has no real overarching strategy—the argument that allies in Europe and elsewhere should bear more of the costs of their defense was not articulated as part of any coherent broader vision—and gutting of the diplomatic corps has left the US devoid of expertise and key actors to confront crises when they arise.\n\nRELIGIOUS VIOLENCE IS ON THE RISE. WHAT CAN FAITH-BASED COMMUNITIES DO ABOUT IT?\n\nFebruary 25, 2019\n\nWorld Economic Forum - Religious violence is undergoing a revival. The past decade has witnessed a sharp increase in violent sectarian or religious tensions. These range from Islamic extremists waging global jihad and power struggles between Sunni and Shia Muslims in the Middle East to the persecution of Rohingya in Myanmar and outbreaks of violence between Christians and Muslims across Africa. According to Pew, in 2018 more than a quarter of the world's countries experienced a high incidence of hostilities motivated by religious hatred, mob violence related to religion, terrorism, and harassment of women for violating religious codes.\n\nWOMEN MARCHED FOR KOREAN RECONCILIATION. WASHINGTON IS IN OUR WAY\n\nFebruary 25, 2019\n\nThe Washington Post - In 2015, we were among 30 women from around the world who came together to cross the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ), the infamous strip of land that has separated North and South Korea since a \"temporary\" cease-fire halted the Korean War 65 years ago.\n\nJULIA MACDONALD WILL BE THE HIGHLIGHTED SPEAKER AT THE DENVER COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATION'S DINNER TALK ON MARCH 6, \"A NEW NUCLEAR REVOLUTION? A DISCUSSION OF CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGES TO THE NUCLEAR ORDER\"\n\nFebruary 25, 2019\n\n\"BEHIND BARS AND BARGAINS: NEW FINDINGS IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN EMERGING DEMOCRACIES\"\n\nFebruary 24, 2019\n\nInternational Studies Quarterly - The global transitional justice tool kit—involving the use of criminal prosecutions, amnesties, and other mechanisms to address past human rights abuse—has become a primary means for thwarting future human rights violations and consolidating democracy. Nevertheless, evidence on the consequences of transitional justice remains mixed and amenable to contradictory interpretations. Existing studies fail to adequately address issues of selection, the difference between short- and long-term effects of transitional justice mechanisms, and qualitative and quantitative differences in state practices. This article uses a new database of transitional justice mechanisms to address these concerns and test propositions from realist, constructivist, and holistic approaches to this set of policy issues.\n\nTRICIA OLSEN, WITH COLLEAGUES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, FLACSO-MEXICO, AND UNAM (NATIONAL AUTONOMOUS UNIVERSITY OF MEXICO), WILL PRESENT THEIR WORK ON MEDIA COVERAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DISAPPEARED IN MEXICO TO JOURNALISTS AND ACADEMICS IN MEXICO CITY ON MARCH 18-19, 2019\n\nFebruary 22, 2019\n\nTRICIA OLSEN WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT'S BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ROUNDTABLE ON APRIL 6, 2019\n\nFebruary 22, 2019\n\nOLIVER KAPLAN WAS INVITED TO JOIN THE PROJECT ADVISORY GROUP (PAG) FOR THE MANAGING EXITS FROM ARMED CONFLICT INITIATIVE OF THE UNITED NATIONS UNIVERSITY\n\nFebruary 22, 2019\n\nTIMOTHY SISK RECEIVED A SENIOR FULBRIGHT FELLOWSHIP IN A SPECIAL PROGRAM ON INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY AT THE NORWEGIAN NOBEL INSTITUTE IN OSLO. THE PROJECT HE WILL BE WORKING ON IS, \"SOCIAL POLARIZATION IN ELECTORAL PROCESSES: PRECURSOR TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE?\"\n\nFebruary 21, 2019\n\nYOU CAN NOW DOWNLOAD THE PRIVATE SECURITY EVENTS DATABASE (PSED) RESEARCHED AND MATERIALIZED BY DEBORAH AVANT AND SIÉ RESEARCH FELLOW, KARA KINGMA NEU\n\nFebruary 21, 2019\n\nTHE FUTURE IS A MOVING TARGET: PREDICTING POLITICAL INSTABILITY\n\nFebruary 20, 2019\n\nBritish Journal of Political Science - Previous research by Goldstone et al. (2010) generated a highly accurate predictive model of state-level political instability. Notably, this model identifies political institutions – and partial democracy with factionalism, specifically – as the most compelling factors explaining when and where instability events are likely to occur. This article reassesses the model's explanatory power and makes three related points: (1) the model's predictive power varies substantially over time; (2) its predictive power peaked in the period used for out-of-sample validation (1995–2004) in the original study and (3) the model performs relatively poorly in the more recent period.\n\nWHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM LOOKING AT PRIVATE SECURITY ACROSS TIME AND SPACE\n\nFebruary 19, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - We know a lot about private security from analyses of its use in individual instances. Case studies of Sierra Leone, Angola, Croatia, Iraq, and Afghanistan have yielded important insights relevant to governments or others that might hire private military and security companies (PMSCs) and those who operate around them. In the last 10 years or so, scholars have begun to collect data to examine the industry and its potential impacts. Thus far, the data has focused on contracts with PMSCs – in either Africa or failing states. As we discuss in our recent article, the Private Security Events Database (PSED) allows a broader scope, covering events involving PMSCs in three regions (Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia) from 1990-2012.\n\nTHE INCLUSIVE GLOBAL LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE IS NOW ACCEPTING NOMINATIONS FOR THEIR 2019 SUMMER INSTITUTE\n\nFebruary 14, 2019\n\nSié Center - The Inclusive Global Leadership Initiative (IGLI) is pleased to invite nominations for our third annual Summer Institute, to be held in collaboration with the U.S. Institute of Peace from August 24-31, 2019, in Colorado and Washington, D.C. The 2019 Summer Institute will convene leading women-identifying activists from the front lines of movements to advance peace, justice, and human rights across the world. The Institute will offer these activists opportunities for training, networking, and learning on how to wage effective nonviolent movements for social change in their communities.\n\nBATTLEFIELD RESPONSES TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES: VIEWS FROM THE GROUND ON UNMANNED AIRCRAFT\n\nFebruary 7, 2019\n\nSecurity Studies - How do individuals on the battlefield respond to the introduction of new technologies? How will unmanned and increasingly autonomous technologies be received by ground combat personnel? In this paper we explore tactical-level perceptions of one particular technology—armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)—by conducting a survey experiment of ground fires controllers. Our findings reveal that these personnel have strong behavioral reactions to the introduction of unmanned technology. Especially in situations with high risk to ground troops, we find a strong preference for manned aircraft with implications for the future use of UAVs and human–machine relationships in war. These results suggest the need to incorporate behavioral variables into future studies of military adoption and innovation and indicate that the future adoption of unmanned systems may be just as much about the \"warm fuzzy\" of trust as confidence in unmanned capabilities\n\nRESISTING COCA: HOW COMMUNITIES AVOID NARCO-ECONOMIES\n\nFebruary 5, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - When armed conflicts involve illicit economies, they can create special risks for civilians. Not only may armed actors in these conflicts be more opportunistic and violent and less restrained, but the promise of economic rents also fosters competition over the civilian population and labor force. It can be difficult for communities to avoid these dynamics. After all, why resist when there is so much money to be made? And why face the danger of going up against murderous cartels and armed groups?\n\nSIÉ CENTER, ONE EARTH FUTURE, AND OEF RESEARCH JOINT POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nFebruary 2, 2019\n\nThe Sié Center, One Earth Future (OEF), and OEF Research are looking for postdoctoral candidates to staff an existing joint postdoctoral position.\n\nSIÉ CENTER, ONE EARTH FUTURE, AND SECURE FISHERIES JOINT POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\nThe Sié Center, One Earth Future (OEF), and Secure Fisheries are looking for postdoctoral candidates to staff an innovative joint postdoc position around conflict and fisheries.\n\nSIÉ CENTER AND OXFAM JOINT POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\nThe Sié Center and Oxfam America are looking for exceptional postdoctoral candidates to staff an innovative joint postdoc around peace, security, and humanitarian action.\n\nWHAT ONE COMPANY'S VANISHING ACT TELLS US ABOUT THE PRIVATE SECURITY INDUSTRY\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\nThe Bureau of Investigative Journalism - Yesterday we published an investigation into the strange vanishing act of private security firm Sabre International Security - once one of the biggest contractors in US-occupied Iraq - and what happened to its Nepalese and Indian workforce when tragedy struck in Kabul in 2016.\n\nDISAPPEARING RIGHTS: WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN THE AGE OF TRUMP\n\nJanuary 31, 2019\n\nReiff Center for Human Rights and Conflict Resolution - Marie Berry is giving a talk at Christopher Newport University's Reiff Center for Human Rights and Conflict Resolution. Her talk will be discussing women's and LGBT folks rights reporting under the Trump Administration.\n\nTHE PRIVATE SECURITY EVENTS DATABASE\n\nJanuary 30, 2019\n\nJournal of Conflict Resolution - Since the 1990s, the private provision of military and security services has become a common feature of local, national, and transnational politics. The prevalence of private security has generated important questions about its consequences, but data to answer these questions are sparse. In this article, we introduce the Private Security Events Database (PSED) that traces the involvement of private military and security companies (PMSCs) in events in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia from 1990 to 2012.\n\nWHEN DO TIES BIND? FOREIGN FIGHTERS, SOCIAL EMBEDDEDNESS, AND VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS\n\nJanuary 30, 2019\n\nJournal of Peace Research - How do foreign fighters affect civilian victimization in the civil wars they join? Scholars of civil war have gone to great lengths to explain why states and insurgent groups victimize civilians, but they have not explicitly examined the impact of foreign combatants. Furthermore, while contemporary conventional wisdom attaches an overwhelmingly negative connotation to foreign fighters, history shows that the behavior of those who travel to fight in wars far from home varies significantly, especially when it comes to interacting with local populations.\n\nGLOBAL RESEARCH HUBS TACKLE WORLD'S TOUGHEST CHALLENGES\n\nJanuary 22, 2019\n\nUK Research and Innovation - Marie Berry is part of a collaborative research team that was awarded a grant under the UK Research and Innovation's Gender, Justice, and Security Hub housed at the London School of Economics.\n\nTHE ELUSIVE 'NEW NEPAL': DEMOCRATISATION, ETHNIC POLITICS AND SOCIAL CONTRACT-MAKING IN A PLURAL SOCIETY\n\nJanuary 22, 2019\n\nResilient Social Contracts - Nepal's decade-long process from 2005 to 2015 of ending its civil war through a comprehensive peace agreement, constitution-making and overall democratisation of the state portend a 'New Nepal' social contract to upend centuries of exclusive rule and a hierarchically ranked society. This paper considers how the newfound social contract has been forged and the ways in which a sustainable contract remain elusive.\n\nFRIDAY NEWS ROUNDUP- INTERNATIONAL\n\nJanuary 18, 2019\n\nNPR - This week, the American military confirmed that two service members, one government contractor and one civilian affiliated with the Pentagon had been killed in a suicide bombing in Syria.\n\nQ&A: AHEAD OF THE MARADE AND WOMEN'S MARCH, DU PROFESSOR DISCUSSES POWER OF MARCHES\n\nJanuary 17, 2019\n\nUniversity of Denver - Political participation is not only an American tradition, but also a Pioneer tradition embraced by students of varied political persuasions. In 1968, for example, DU students protested the presidential run of Alabama Gov. George Wallace. In 1970, they joined a statewide student strike in protest of the Kent State shootings, the invasion of Cambodia and the Bobby Seale trial.\n\nRESISTING DEMOCRATIC EROSION IN LATIN AMERICA AND BEYOND\n\nJanuary 15, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - The dawn of 2019 saw Latin America's democratic crisis continue and deepen. Most prominently, New Year's Day saw far-right former military officer Jair Bolsonaro sworn in as President of Brazil. Bolsonaro immediately acted to consolidate power; curb the independence of NGOs; undercut government efforts to expand educational access and protect human rights; open up Amazonian lands to development despite indigenous objections; and give security forces free rein. Bolsonaro has already dispatched the military domestically. This could begin an expanded military role in Brazil's domestic politics and security, a worrying prospect given the country's history of dictatorship.\n\nSIÉ CHÉOU-KANG CENTER RESEARCH PROJECT ON ETHICAL APPROACHES TO POLICY ENGAGEMENT WAS AWARDED A GRANT FROM THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK\n\nJanuary 10, 2019\n\nSié Center - Carnegie Corporation of New York has awarded a philanthropic grant of $500,000 to the Sié Chéou-Kang Center for a project titled \"Rigor, Relevance, and Responsibility: Promoting Ethical Approaches to Policy Engagement.\"\n\nAs scholars of international relations become more involved in policy debates and actively participate in the policy process, the importance of exploring the ethical dimensions of policy engagement increases. \"Academics in the field of international relations find themselves in a difficult moment,\" says Cullen Hendrix, Director of the Sié Chéou-Kang Center. \"Many face mounting pressure and inducements to engage with policymakers, and many are working to facilitate constructive academic-policy engagement. Yet, academics receive little training about the ethical considerations these activities engender. Our program will develop knowledge around, and inform the practice of, responsible engagement so that future generations of academics can engage in the policy world with confidence and clarity. We are grateful to Carnegie Corporation of New York for funding support that will enable us to carry out this important work.\"\n\nLOST JOB—WILL TRAVEL: TRADE-RELATED JOB LOSSES AND MILITARY RECRUITMENT\n\nJanuary 8, 2019\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - A new study shows how trade-related job losses translate into increases in military enlistment. While the study is convincing in its own right, it raises important questions and highlights one potential pitfall of political-economic analysis: focusing on partial equilibrium results in a full-equilibrium world.\n\nKAI THALER, POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW, WROTE A CHAPTER IN THE ROUTLEDGE INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF VIOLENCE STUDIES\n\nJanuary 4, 2019\n\nRoutledge International Handbook of Violence Studies - Kai Thaler is a contributing author and wrote the chapter, \"Mixed Methods in Violence Studies\".\n\nTHE CLIMATE NEXUS\n\nNovember 29, 2018\n\nRoyal Geographical Society's \"Geographic\" Magazine - According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 'human influence on the climate system is clear,' and a 'warming' trend in that system is 'unequivocal'. Credible scientists are no longer researching if climate change is happening. Instead, efforts have now turned towards mitigation and adaption.\n\n#16DAYS: ELIMINATING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN\n\nNovember 29, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - Last Sunday marked the start of #16days of Activism, a global campaign against gender-based violence. Championed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN Women, and many other groups, the campaign is designed to generate momentum towards eliminating the pervasiveness of all forms of gendered violence, including the physical and sexual violence that one-third of women across the globe will be subjected to in their lifetime.\n\nTHE US ELECTED A RECORD NUMBER OF WOMEN: NOW THEY MAY FACE VIOLENCE\n\nNovember 28, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - The recent US mid-term elections saw a rise in the number of women candidates across the country. The Center for American Women and Politics reports that women represented 32.4% of all nominees for the US Senate, 28.7% of all nominees for the US House, 21.9% of all nominees for governorships, and 32.7% of all nominees for statewide elected executive offices. Of these women, 102 were elected to the House of Representatives and 13 to the Senate. This means that in January, 125 women will be sitting in the US. Congress, a significant increase from the current 107. However, being elected is not the last obstacle that women with political ambitions face. Research and reports from around the world show that once elected, women face significant obstacles for advancing their political goals and careers. These obstacles include violence and harassment.\n\nAID AND DIPLOMACY, NOT TEAR GAS: HOW TO ADDRESS THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANT CRISIS\n\nNovember 27, 2018\n\nDuck of Minerva - On Sunday, the US Border Patrol fired tear gas into Mexico at migrants, including children, attempting to enter the US near the San Ysidro border crossing between Tijuana and San Diego. The use of a chemical weapon banned in war against families rightly provoked widespread condemnation (Border Patrol agents also used pepper spray against migrants in 2013, fired tear gas and pepper spray into Mexico in 2007, and have killed rock throwers at the border in the past). Migrants attempting to enter the US are frustrated by the Trump administration's restriction of the process of seeking asylum, a legal right under US and international law, a situation that won't be solved by processing asylum seekers on Mexican soil.\n\nFISH WARS: THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF FISHERIES CONFLICT IN TANZANIA\n\nNovember 21, 2018\n\nSecure Fisheries - As competition for finite fisheries resources increases, the risk of violent conflict over fisheries also rises. Where and when can we expect fisheries conflict to occur? What are the most frequent causes of fisheries conflict? How often does conflict result in arrests, property damage, or death? What can be done to mitigate fisheries conflict? Fish Wars: the Causes and Consequences of Fisheries Conflict in Tanzania explores the frequency, intensity, and drivers of fisheries conflict in Tanzania during 1990 – 2017.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE FOR SYRIAN RETURNEES\n\nNovember 20, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence at a Glance - In February 2018 the UN divided its support of the repatriation of Syrian refugees into three phases. In Phase 1 conditions are not conducive to mass return, and the UN's engagement is limited to counseling, monitoring cross-border movements, analysis of return trends, and advocacy. In order to shift to a more proactive Phase 2, specific protection thresholds must be met, including a guarantee of full amnesty in Syria for returnees, including for those who evaded or resisted compulsory military service. Phase 3—whereby the UN would actually promote voluntary return—is nowhere in sight.\n\nTHE LAW AND VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN POLITICS\n\nNovember 15, 2018\n\nPolitics & Gender - Latin America has been at the vanguard in implementing diverse strategies to combat violence against women in politics (VAWIP). In 2012, Bolivia became the first country to criminalize \"political violence and harassment against women\" with Law 243. Soon, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica, and Mexico followed with similar proposals (Krook and Restrepo Sanín 2016). Despite high levels of criminal impunity (Piscopo 2016), legislative measures have been the preferred strategy to combat VAWIP within the region. The Inter-American Commission on Women (CIM) recently published a model law, drawing on experiences in Bolivia, to serve as inspiration for other legislative measures in the region. What can these legislative definitions tell us about the phenomenon of VAWIP, its limits, and its challenges?\n\nARE SOUND DEMOCRATIC AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS NECESSARY FOR GROWTH?\n\nNovember 9, 2018\n\nPeterson Institute for International Economics - In the 2000s, the emerging consensus among economists was that if countries had the right economic and legal institutions that govern exchange, property rights, dispute resolution, and corruption, good policies and economic growth would follow. Similar arguments were made about political institutions, with democracy emerging as decidedly pro-growth.\n\nBANKING ON MARKETS: THE TRANSFORMATION OF BANK-STATE TIES IN EUROPE AND BEYOND\n\nNovember 6, 2018\n\nAssociation for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES) - Rachel Epstein's book Banking on Markets: The Transformation of Bank-State Ties in Europe and Beyond is the co-winner of the 2018 Ed A.

Alarmingly, countries of origin for asylum seekers and countries with greater gender inequalities saw their reporting decline at even higher rates of around 50%. These reports are important inputs into US policy and help support human rights defenders at home and abroad. They are also a critically important trove of systematic data on human rights practices available to advocates, scholars, asylum seekers, and multinational firms.\n\nWHEN DISASTER STRIKES, GO FISH\n\nOctober 24, 2018\n\nHakai Magazine - Dyhia Belhabib was born in 1984, seven years before the onset of Algeria's \"Black Decade,\" a vicious civil war that claimed 200,000 lives. She grew up in Tazmalt, an Algerian town less than 100 kilometers from the Mediterranean, but constant violence and government-imposed curfews prohibited outings to the ocean. Every day brought news of explosions and beheadings. \"It was a horror movie, quite frankly,\" she says.\n\nPROFESSOR'S RESEARCH EXPLORES HOW HUMANS RESPOND WHEN AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS REPORT FOR DUTY\n\nOctober 24, 2018\n\nUniversity of Denver - When the Department of Defense (DOD) needs to get up to speed on the social, cultural, behavioral and political trends affecting the nation's security, it calls in a special kind of special forces. Via its Minerva Research Initiative, named for the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare, the department seeks insight — and data — from the ranks of the nation's top researchers. Count Julia Macdonald of the University of Denver's Josef Korbel School of International Studies among them. An assistant professor affiliated with the Korbel School's Sié Chéou-Kang Center for International Security and Diplomacy, her research focuses on state threat assessments, use-of-force decisions, and U.S. military strategy and effectiveness\n\nWHAT SHOULD WE MAKE OF ELITE AMERICAN MERCENARIES IN YEMEN?\n\nOctober 23, 2018\n\nWar on the Rocks - A recent Buzzfeed exclusive reveals that veterans of America's elite military units, working for the United Arab Emirates, are responsible for a string of assassinations in Yemen. They worked for a company called Spear Operations Group, directed and led in the field by an enigmatic Hungarian-Israeli named Abraham Golan. After meeting in Abu Dhabi with former Palestinian Authority security chief Mohammed Dahlan, now a top adviser for the Emirates, Golan was supplied with weapons, legal cover in the form of military ranks for him and his employees, escorts into Aden, and a list of names.\n\nFORMER U.S. SPECIAL FORCES WERE REPORTEDLY HIRED TO KILL YEMEN'S LEADERS. DID THE GOVERNMENT KNOW?\n\nOctober 19, 2018\n\nThe Washington Post's Monkey Cage - In a BuzzFeed article this week, Aram Roston reports that a Delaware company, Spear Operations Group, organized a private hit squad to work for the United Arab Emirates in Yemen. The company's founder, Israeli operative Abraham Golan, and former U.S. Navy SEAL Isaac Gilmore admitted to these actions in the article. The company appears to have hired several other U.S. veterans and reservists, including one who retired from the well-known SEAL Team 6 (responsible for killing Osama bin Laden). Everything we understand about the private security industry tells us that this action is likely to have serious ramifications.\n\nPEACEKEEPING'S PERVERSE EFFECTS: BOLSONARO AND BRAZIL'S REMILITARIZED POLITICS\n\nOctober 16, 2018\n\nDuck of Minerva - In under two weeks, Brazil will have the second round of its presidential election. Former military officer and fan of fascists Jair Bolsonaro looks set after a strong first-round showing to defeat Workers' Party (PT) candidate Fernando Haddad.\n\nTHE ROOTS OF RESTRAINT IN WAR\n\nOctober 16, 2018\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross - The Roots of Restraint in War is an update of the 2004 Roots of Behaviour in War. You can also find here the Executive Summary of this report. Based on two years of research collaboration between the ICRC and six distinguished scholars, the report identifies sources of influence on various types of armed forces and armed groups, ranging from those with a highly decentralized structure to those embedded within their communities.\n\nTHE BEST HUMAN RIGHTS BOOKS, JULY TO SEPTEMBER 2018\n\nOctober 14, 2018\n\nHong Kong Free Press - The ten books on the list are about and/or set in Algeria, Australia, China, Egypt, Russia, Syria and the United States. There is only one fiction book, an unusually low number compared with past lists; the rest are nonfiction.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE: IDEOLOGICAL EXTREMISM IN ARMED CONFLICT\n\nOctober 11, 2018\n\nThe MIT Press Journals - In \"The Extremist's Advantage in Civil Wars,\" Barbara Walter seeks to explain the rise of radical Islamist groups in civil wars since 2003, especially Salafist groups.1 She claims that ideologically extreme groups have an organizational edge and thus outperform more moderate groups. This thesis is unpersuasive, however, because of its shaky empirical basis.\n\nCONFLICT AND CONTAGIONS: DISEASE BURDEN AND CIVIL WAR\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence @ a Glance - The Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing what is now the seventh largest Ebola outbreak in history. The World Health Organization is saying the outbreak—located in the heavily conflict-affected province of North Kivu, but spreading to South Kivu and Ituri as well—is occurring in a \"perfect storm\" of active armed conflict, limiting the ability of relief workers to access exposed populations. As of September 25, WHO staff were only able to reach 20% of individuals in need.\n\nTRUMP WILL PUSH TRADE POLICIES AS HELPING WORKERS IN U.S. HEARTLAND\n\nOctober 5, 2018\n\nThe Wall Street Journal - With a month to go until the midterm elections, President Trump will hit the road next week to sell his new North American trade deal in the U.S. heartland, while trying to ease concerns over lingering trade disputes.\n\nDO MILITARY DEFECTIONS HELP OR HINDER PRO-DEMOCRACY CIVIL RESISTANCE?\n\nOctober 4, 2018\n\nInternational Center on Nonviolent Conflict - When activists start mobilizing to pursue a transition from dictatorship to democracy in their country, they face real risks—perhaps the most serious being lethal repression at the hands of state security forces. If feeling especially threatened, the dictator may choose to deploy the military and order it to throw its weight behind ending the popular challenge.\n\nREPRESSION, REGIME CONSOLIDATION, AND LATIN AMERICA'S AUTHORITARIAN (RE)TURN\n\nSeptember 25, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence @ a Glance - This week, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega is planning to attend the United Nations General Assembly for the first time in eleven years; it will also be his first visit since a wave of protests against his regime began in April. The largely nonviolent demonstrations quickly expanded into the most serious challenge yet for Ortega, who has been in office since 2007. After months of contestation, Ortega used paramilitaries and police to crush protesters and their roadblocks and campus occupations. Government forces have killed hundreds, more have been arrested, and opposition leaders have fled into exile.\n\nKEY INFORMANT LOSS\n\nSeptember 19, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence @ a Glance - The news came via a friend's Facebook post earlier this year. A key informant that I had spent time with a decade earlier during my field research on community peace movements had passed away.\n\nBLACKWATER FOUNDER TOUTS PLAN TO CUT US TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN\n\nSeptember 17, 2018\n\nThe National - Blackwater founder Erik Prince believes he has an \"audience of one\" to persuade to back his plan to turn the war effort in Afghanistan over to an army of private contractors backed by its own air force in a move that would see US and Nato forces largely withdrawn.\n\nPOLARIZATION, POPULISM, AND PR: PROPORTIONAL, INCLUSIVE ELECTIONS APPEAR TO BE THE KEY TO COUNTERING SOCIAL POLARIZATION\n\nSeptember 14, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence @ a Glance - The just-concluded elections in Sweden reveal that the vein of populism in Europe is not yet waning, and in some countries the \"vote share\" of populist parties continues to rise. In the globally watched Swedish elections, the far-right party Sweden Democrats garnered some 18% of the vote—less than predicted, but more than the vote share in the 2014 polls—becoming a significant factor in Sweden's typically boring, centrist-oriented politics.\n\nPRIVATIZING THE U.S. EFFORT IN AFGHANISTAN SEEMED A BAD IDEA. NOW IT'S EVEN WORSE.\n\nSeptember 11, 2018\n\nWashington Post - It's been 17 years since 9/11, the pivotal event that precipitated the start of the U.S. war in Afghanistan. In recent weeks, there has been new talk of privatizing that war.\n\nRETHINKING SECRECY IN CYBERSPACE: THE POLITICS OF VOLUNTARY ATTRIBUTION\n\nSeptember 8, 2018\n\nJournal of Global Security Studies - Cyberspace affords actors unprecedented opportunities to carry out operations under a cloak of anonymity. Why do perpetrators sometimes forgo these opportunities and willingly claim credit for attacks? To date, the literature has done little to explain this variation. This article explores the motivations behind voluntary credit-claiming for the two main actors in cyberspace: states and politically motivated nonstate actors. We argue that states are most likely to claim credit for their operations and to do so privately when the goal is to coerce an opponent. Nonstate actors tend to publicly claim credit for their attacks in order to showcase their capabilities, influence public opinion, and grow their ranks. We use case narratives to assess the plausibility of our argument and find strong support. This article places cyberspace operations in conversation with the larger literature on secrecy in international relations and advances a common framework for understanding how both states and nonstate actors operate in this evolving domain.\n\nJULIA MACDONALD, \"THE MOST SURPRISING THING ABOUT THE VENEZUELA DRONE ATTACK IS THAT IT HASN'T HAPPENED SOONER\"\n\nSeptember 4, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence @ a Glance - Approximately one month ago a group of dissident soldiers reportedly attempted to assassinate the President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, with explosive-laden drones. News of the attack quickly dominated the news cycle and shocked many observers who viewed this as a pivotal moment in the use of drones by non-state actors. This reaction is understandable. While armed drones are frequently used in conflict zones, this event seemed to represent a departure from the norm in two respects: it took place in a civilian environment, and it marked the first time a drone has been used to target a head of state.\n\nERICA CHENOWETH IN THE WASHINGTON POST, \"MILLIONS OF PROTESTERS TURNED OUT IN JUNE — MORE THAN IN ANY MONTH SINCE TRUMP'S INAUGURATION.\"\n\nAugust 31, 2018\n\nMonkey Cage Blog - In June, more people showed up at U.S. protests, demonstrations, and other political gatherings than in any month since we started counting in January 2017. We tallied 1,736 protests, demonstrations, strikes, marches, sit-ins, rallies and walkouts, with at least one in every state and the District of Columbia. Our conservative guess is that between 2,790,334 and 4,622,113 people showed up at these political gatherings, though it is likely there were more participants. This count is close to but probably slightly higher than, that of March 2018.\n\nCULLEN HENDRIX IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE AT A GLANCE, \"ALL STICK, NO CARROTS: THE SHORTSIGHTED GEOPOLITICS OF THE IRAN SANCTIONS\"\n\nAugust 21, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence @ a Glance & Denver Dialogues - The Trump administration, having withdrawn the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action last May, is threatening US trading partners over doing business with Iran and attempting to freeze Iran out of global oil markets. The attempted freeze-out began with the re-imposition of US sanctions against Iran and businesses operating there, and the Trump administration set November 4 as the target date for US allies to zero out their purchases of Iranian crude. With some arm-twisting, NATO allies like Turkey and Asian security partners South Korea and India have agreed to curb Iranian imports, though it will be difficult for India to zero out its Iranian imports. Fearful of being caught up by US sanctions, major European firms like Total, Allianz, and Maersk have begun winding down operations in Iran in advance of the November 4 deadline.\n\nERICA CHENOWETH ON NONVIOLENT PROTESTS, \"ARE WE LIVING IN AN UNPRECEDENTED AGE OF PEOPLE POWER?\"\n\nAugust 20, 2018\n\nTVL1 - Professor Erica Chenoweth, a scholar of international relations says that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of non-violent protests in the world. She knows because she counts them, rigorously; she also counts when they work and why.\n\nMARIE BERRY'S BOOK-WAR, WOMEN, AND POWER WAS SELECTED TO BE A PART OF THE DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA BOOK CLUB.\n\nAugust 15, 2018\n\nDemocracy in Africa - How do women experience war? Does war reconfigure gender power relations? Marie E. Berry explores these and other questions in her new book: War, Women, and Power: From Violence to Mobilization in Rwanda and Bosnia-Herzegovina (Cambridge University Press, 2018), in which she argues that war can reconfigure gender power relations by catalyzing women's political mobilization.\n\nCULLEN HENDRIX IN THE PETERSON INSTITUTE BLOG, \"FREEZING IRAN OUT OF OIL MARKETS WON'T WORK\"\n\nAugust 13, 2018\n\nPeterson Insitute for International Economics - The Trump administration, having withdrawn the United States from Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action last May, is threatening US trading partners over doing business with Iran and attempting to freeze Iran out of global oil markets. It won't work—and will indirectly strengthen the United States' principal rivals, China and Russia, in the process.\n\nCULLEN HENDRIX IN THE DENVER POST, \"FREEZING IRAN OUT OF OIL MARKETS WON'T WORK\"\n\nAugust 7, 2018\n\nThe Denver Post - The Trump Administration, having withdrawn the United States from Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action last May, is threatening U.S. trading partners over doing business with Iran and attempting to freeze Iran out of global oil markets. It won't work — and will indirectly strengthen the United States' principal rivals, China and Russia, in the process.\n\nSIÉ FELLOW, TOM ZOLOT, WAS PUBLISHED IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST AND WON FIRST PLACE FOR HIS ESSAY, \"HOW AMERICA HAS BECOME A THEATER OF WAR\"\n\nAugust 4, 2018\n\nThe National Interest - America's marginalized communities pay the heaviest cost for the escalation in police militarization.\n\nDEBORAH AVANT HAS A CHAPTER PUBLISHED IN \"U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY REFORM\"\n\nAugust 3, 2018\n\nRoutledge Publishing - \"Contradictions in U.S. Security Planning for a Global Environment and a Process Approach to Solving Them\"\n\nERICA CHENOWETH AND COLLEAGUES IN WASHINGTON POST, \"TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PROTESTED IN APRIL AND MAY — ON TOPICS LIKE GUN VIOLENCE, LABOR RIGHTS AND SCIENCE\"\n\nAugust 1, 2018\n\nMonkey Cage Blog - This is the 16th installment in a series reporting on political crowds in the United States. Each month, the Crowd Counting Consortium will post updates about trends and patterns from the previous month or months. For our counting methods, please see our first post in the series. You can find the rest of the posts here.\n\nTHESE ARE THE FOUR LARGEST PROTESTS SINCE TRUMP WAS INAUGURATED\n\nMay 31, 2018\n\nWashington Post - For March, we tallied 6,056 protests, demonstrations, strikes, marches, sit-ins, rallies and walkouts in the United States, with at least one in every state and the District. Our conservative guess is that between 2,587,786 and 3,944,175 people showed up at these political gatherings, although it is likely there were more participants. As a monthly count, this number of participants was only surpassed during the first month we started counting, January 2017. The boost came from the overwhelming attendance at the March for Our Lives, which we reported on here earlier, and the associated national student walkouts for school safety from gun violence.\n\nINNOVATIONS IN PEACEBUILDING REPORT NOW AVAILABLE\n\nMay 23, 2018\n\nSié Center - \"Innovations in Peacebuilding\" was a two-year research, dialogue, and policy project (2015-2017) that explores innovative ways in which international organizations, donors, governments, and local non-governmental organizations conduct activities aimed at conflict prevention and management, peacebuilding and reconciliation. The project explored this research question: How do norms affect mobilization dynamics in local settings in conflict-affected countries, and what are the implications for peacebuilding practice and effectiveness? Read more about the project here.\n\nERICA CHENOWETH AND FORMER POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW, EVAN PERKOSKI, TO TALK AT THE INTERNATIONAL CENTER ON NONVIOLENT CONFLICT\n\nMay 22, 2018\n\nICNC - On June 1st, Nonviolent Resistance and Prevention of Mass Killings during Popular Uprisings.\n\nPOSTDOCTORAL FELLOW YOLANDE BOUKA AS A WITNESS FOR THE CANADIAN PARLIAMENTARY SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS IN OTTAWA\n\nMay 22, 2018\n\nHouse of Commons, Canada - The human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\n\"ON MARCHING\"\n\nMay 21, 2018\n\nDIY Democracy - Interviews with Dr. Erica Chenoweth about marching as a nonviolent tactic and with Sana Shahid about organizing the Houston Women's March.\n\nJULIA MACDONALD PART OF A RESEARCH TEAM AWARDED MINERVA RESEARCH INITIATIVE GRANT\n\nMay 17, 2018\n\nSié Center - The DoD's Minerva Research Initiative's three-year grant supports social science research in areas of importance to U.S. national security policy. The awarded project is a collaboration led by Michael C. Horowitz, Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania, who will work alongside researchers at the Naval War College, Yale University, and the Sié Center. Entitled, \"The Disruptive Effects of Autonomy: Ethics, Trust, and Organizational Decision-making,\" the study will explore the factors that affect the use of autonomous systems employed by U.S. military on the battlefield.\n\nTENSION GROWS AROUND REFERENDUM IN BURUNDI\n\nMay 17, 2018\n\nNPR - Yolande Bouka, a research fellow at the University of Denver who has studied Burundi's current political crisis in detail, says the proposed constitutional amendment makes it easier for the ruling party \"to get its way.\" It gives the president broader powers to control the legislative agenda, for example, and it also makes it easier for the president to minimize the influence of other political parties and ethnic minorities.\n\nBURUNDI VOTES TOMORROW ON CONTROVERSIAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. A LOT IS AT STAKE.\n\nMay 16, 2018\n\nWashington Post - On Thursday, Burundi will hold a referendum to revise its constitution. The current constitution, adopted in 2005, grew from the 2000 Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement, which helped end Burundi's civil war by establishing one of Africa's most inclusive political arrangements. The proposed amendments threaten to dismantle the Arusha Agreement without a broad national debate — and could lead to renewed instability.\n\nSTATES ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN MASS VIOLENCE AGAINST NONVIOLENT UPRISINGS THAN VIOLENT UPRISINGS\n\nMay 8, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence @ a Glance - What drives governments to crack down on and kill their own civilians in the context of popular uprisings? This is the topic of Chenoweth and Perkoski's newly-released special report with the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict. In it, they explore why governments engage in mass killings – or the intentional killing of 1,000 or more civilian noncombatants – in the context of both violent and nonviolent mass uprisings.\n\nRESISTING WAR: HOW COMMUNITIES PROTECT THEMSELVES\n\nMay/June 2018\n\nForeign Affairs - Caught in the crossfire between militant insurgents and government forces, unarmed civilians are often portrayed as helpless. Kaplan rejects this idea and finds that under certain circumstances, local communities can protect their members from civil strife. He bases his hopeful conclusion primarily on his extensive field research in rural Colombia; using secondary sources, he also finds local islands of peaceful civilian autonomy within conflict zones in Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Syria—suggesting that even in extreme circumstances, civilians can organize to keep themselves safe.\n\nMIGRATION, CITIES, AND ENGAGED SCHOLARSHIP\n\nMay 1, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence @ a Glance - On April 3, 2018, just prior to the start of the annual meeting of the International Studies Association (ISA) in San Francisco, Kelsey co-organized (along with Dr. Hans Schattle) a working group titled \"Cities and the Contentious Politics of Migration,\" co-sponsored by the Ethnicity, Migration & Citizenship and International Ethics sections. The idea behind the workshop arose from the previous year's ISA meeting in Baltimore, which took place just weeks after President Trump's first issuance of the now infamous 'Muslim Ban.'\n\nWAR, WOMEN, AND POWER: FROM VIOLENCE TO MOBILIZATION IN RWANDA AND BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA\n\nApril 30, 2018\n\nNew Books Network— How can war change women's political mobilization? Using Rwanda and Bosnia as case studies Marie E. Berry answers these questions and more in her powerful new book, War, Women, and Power: From Violence to Mobilization in Rwanda and Bosnia Herzegovina (Cambridge University Press, 2018). Berry provides the reader with a solid history and background of how war came to be in each of these countries respectively.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT: NONVIOLENT RESISTANCE AND PREVENTION OF MASS KILLINGS DURING POPULAR UPRISINGS\n\nApril 30, 2018\n\nInternational Center on Nonviolent Conflict— ICNC is excited to announce the publication of a special report by Evan Perkoski and Erica Chenoweth entitled \"Nonviolent Resistance and Prevention of Mass Killings in Popular Uprisings.\" The report is the second release in ICNC's Special Report Series, launched in 2017.\n\nRETHINKING WOMEN'S POWER DURING AND AFTER WAR\n\nApril 24, 2018\n\nPolitical Violence @ A Glance— Noémie was born in the south of Rwanda in the early 1960s. After graduating from University, she became a teacher. When the genocide broke out in 1994, her husband and many members of her family were killed. As she described it to me,\n\n\"I was married to a successful man...but after the genocide, it was different because my husband was dead. And I was the head of the house. So, I had to do everything that was the same for the kids as when their dad was around.\"\n\nERICA CHENOWETH AND JONATHAN PINCKNEY PUBLISH THE NAVCO 3.0 DATASET\n\nApril 19, 2018\n\nJournal of Peace Research— Although the empirical study of strategic nonviolent action has expanded in recent years, no current dataset provides detailed accounts of the day-to-day methods and tactics used by various nonviolent and violent actors seeking political change. We introduce the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) version 3.0 dataset, which assembles over 100,000 hand-coded observations of nonviolent and violent methods in 21 countries around the world between 1991 and 2012.\n\nTHE MOBILIZATION OF WOMEN IN RWANDA AND BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: AN INTERVIEW WITH DR.

Her work examining women's political mobilization, leadership, and peacebuilding efforts is critical to the vision of Our Secure Future for a more peaceful future transformed by women's full participation.\n\nDID YOU ATTEND THE MARCH FOR OUR LIVES? HERE'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE NATIONWIDE.\n\nApril 13, 2018\n\nThe Washington Post's Monkey Cage Blog— On March 24, Parkland, Fla., high school students — in coalition with people nationwide — organized massive public rallies to support gun regulation, safer schools and safer communities. By our count, the March for Our Lives event brought out 1,380,666 to 2,181,886 people at 763 locations — making it the third-largest day of demonstrations since President Trump's inauguration launched an extraordinary period of national political mobilization.
