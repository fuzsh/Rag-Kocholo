Jean-Pierre Bekolo is a filmmaker. Through a committed practice spanning thirty years, he has explored numerous cinematographic genres with the aim of deconstructing stereotypes about Africa and its cinema. A pioneer of Afrofuturism, he explores science fiction, but also playful tales, thrillers, and documentaries (fictional and real). He has directed many films including Quartier Mozart (1992) (awarded at the Cannes Festival, Locarno, Montreal), Le complot d’Aristote (1996), Le Président (2013), Naked Reality (2016) and Les Saignantes (2005; classified by MoMA as one of the 70 classics of science fiction).
