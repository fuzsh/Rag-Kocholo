        "text": "Written and directed by Jean-Pierre Bekolo, “Les Saignantes” is a 2005 erotic sci-fi thriller and political satire. It centers around two young women who use their sexuality to bring down their government. The film has often been praised for the fresh, futuristic perspective it offers viewers into a modern/futuristic Africa. If you are in New York City, the film will be screening tomorrow for free at 7pm at Brooklyn’s Morbid Anatomy Museum. Tickets are still available.\n\nIf you can’t make, you can still watch the film online. Check out a trailer for “Les Saignantes”.\n\nby superselected"
