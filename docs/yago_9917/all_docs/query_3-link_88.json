        "text": "Location: 121 Shaffer Art Building\n\nTwo Evenings with Filmmaker Jean-Pierre Bekolo\n\nJean-Pierre Bekolo (Yaounde '66)\n\nVlad Dima hosts Bekolo, an avant-garde filmmaker and socio-cultural activist whose imaginative work overturns stereotypes of Africa and African cinema. His entertaining films operate on multiple layers, engaging viewers with thrilling stories, biting humor and dramatic aesthetics. An advocate of artistic freedom, Bekolo is committed to realizing Africaâ€™s philosophies and cultures.\n\nAll are invited to a screening of Bekolo's Miraculous Weapons, a manifesto against the death penalty and a hymn to life, championing negritude and the liberation of Black peoples. Q&A follows the film. Bekolo's campus visit includes a separate film with discussion on April 22.\n\nFor more information, or to request accessibility accommodations, contact Vlad Dima by April 8.\n\nView or download a printable event flier.\n\nAdditional supporters:"
