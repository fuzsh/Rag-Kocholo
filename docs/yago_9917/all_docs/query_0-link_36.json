        "text": "This article reads two of Claire Denis' films-Nénette and Boni (1997) and Beau travail (1999)-through the lens of Deleuze's account of modern cinema as a sensation-producing machine. Through their respective engagement with sensual and performative discourses, both these films attempt to dissolve the disciplinary mechanisms that tend to constrain the bodies of characters and viewers in classical narrative cinema. Nénette and Boni transforms a young man's routinized, phallocentric and fetishistic sexuality into a sensual and feminized experience that reconnects the body to a world of unstructured surfaces and textures. Through this transformation, the film addresses the Deleuzian concept of 'becoming-woman' as the possibility, available to both men and women, of gaining a kind of deterritorialized, non-individuated sexuality. To a large extent, this kind of 'molecular' sexuality is also at the heart of Beau travail's displacement of narrative in favour of performance. Although a homoerotic narrative of seduction/repulsion seems to drive Beau travail's machinery of desire from start to finish, the film reaches its most intense desiring production through a self-conscious seduction of the spectator that is consummated in Galoup's final solo dance. In this dance, we become the recipients of the repressed legionnaire's delayed and displaced response to seduction, as we witness the ex-colonizer's exchange of disciplinary ritual for unmotivated jouissance.\n\nThis is an Act by Act analysis of the play Over My Dead Body by Violet Barungi. A formalist Analysis approach. This review focuses on the play text in itself. Additionally, it critically speaks on Feminism in relation to the play and seeks to identify the perspective and values of the play script. Indeed, many of our African plays do not have a lot of information on them online. This is what I love, literature. Thus, I am using this medium to make this document accessible to all students who are studying this play. And for all who are interested in the Arts.\n\nThis piece is composed by two different and, sometimes, divergent readings of the film Black Venus (Vénus noire, Abdellatif kechiche, 2010), written as a result of discussions between the authors about the representations of the body in cinema. The essays focus on two issues present in the film: the place of the body in the representation of colonialism and the ethics of the representation of the non-normative in cinema. Based on real facts, Black Venus narrates a period of Saartjie Baartman’s life, who was a black South-African woman that was taken to Europe at the beginning of the nineteenth century. She was exhibited in circus spectacles to European audiences, where she drew attention of anatomists eager to study her physical traits. Both essays that make up this piece were formulated from a dialogue between the authors, which revealed dissonant spectatorial perceptions and experiences and, thus, they seek to problematize how modes of narration and the aesthetics of the film corroborate towards an understanding of the horrors of colonialism or, conversely, how these legitimate a violence from the relationship that the filmmaker establishes between the image of horror and the place of the spectator."
