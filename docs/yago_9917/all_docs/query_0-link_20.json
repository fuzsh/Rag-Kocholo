        "text": "With a wholly original style, Bekolo is a trailblazing filmmaker whose work throughout his three-decade career interrogates the very definition of African cinema. Beginning with music videos and shorts, his 1992 debut feature Quartier Mozart was hailed at Cannes and the London Film Festival as the advent of a groundbreaking, innovative voice in African and world cinema. At once part of the MTV generation of Africans and also deeply influenced by the films of Spike Lee and by American popular cinema more broadly, Bekolo crafts cult-like films that defy stereotypes and bring new perspectives to African and Western audiences alike. His diverse filmography includes the humor-filled essay on film Aristotle's Plot (1996), Afro-futurist Naked Reality (2016), sci-fi thriller Les Saignantes (2005), a three-hour portrait of African philosopher Valentin Mudimbe and many more.\n\nHis latest directorial effort, Nous les Noirs, takes the form of a fake ethnographic documentary about the discovery and history of Colombia's black people. With a distinct visual style and sly humor, the film explores cultural identity forged around the idea of resistance against slavery and colonialism.\n\nBekolo is currently Harvard's 2024 McMillan-Stewart Fellow in Distinguished Filmmaking. You can read more about his work here >\n\nD: Jean-Pierre Bekolo, Cameroon, subtitled, 2021, 1h41m\n\nDiscussion follows with director Jean-Pierre Bekolo, Prof. Ayo Coly and Prof. Mark Williams.\n\nCo-sponsored by the Department of African & African American Studies and the Department of Film Studies and programmed in conjunction with a course on \"The Idea of Africa.\""
