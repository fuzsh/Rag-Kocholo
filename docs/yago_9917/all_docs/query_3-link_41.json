        "text": "Jean-Pierre Bekolo was born June 8th, 1966 in Yaounde, he studied physics at University of Yaounde 1984-1987 and Television production (editing) at Institute National de l'Audiovisuel - INA in Paris where he also studied semiotics under Christian Metz 1988-1989. He was part of the inaugural class of the Clinton School of Public Service (President Clinton school of public service for social change) in Little Rock Arkansas in 2005.\n\n1992 Jean-Pierre Bekolo is a noted African film director from Cameroon. He already garnered attention at the Cannes Film Festival with his debut film Quartier Mozart made at the age of 25, with a style that is playful, comic, and sardonic became the representative of a new generation that has been working against the restrictive expectations of African cinema, mixing genres and linking pop with politics. Quartier Mozart won number of awards (Locarno, Montreal... and was nominated for the Surtherland Trophy in London along with Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs.)\n\nAn advocate of artistic freedom, Bekolo is committed to realising Africa’s philosophies and cultures. Quartier Mozart shows the hybridity, complexity and humour in urban Yaounde in a playful, hip-hop reinvention of a traditional tale about gender, power, magic and politics.\n\n1995 He directed Aristotle's Plot , the African entry in the British Film Institute's series of films commemorating the centenary of cinema that has included the participation of artists such as Scorsese, Bertolucci, Frears, Miller, Reitz, and Godard. Part action movie send-up, part parody of Aristotle's rules, part satire on Africa's preoccupation with itself, this first African film selcted at Sundance shows Bekolo to be an \"increasingly fearless trickster.\"\n\nAristotle’s Plot parodies rules and definitions, action movies and ‘African’ cinema made for European audiences, while aesthetically reflecting on the nature of existence, its ambiguities and absence of rigid categories.\n\n1996 Bekolo’s work on the re-representation of Africa also includes insightful documentaries\n\nthat seek to educate, such as Grandmother’s Grammar on groundbreaking Senegalese filmmaker Djibril Diop Mambety.\n\n2005 His avant-garde political thriller Les Saignantes premiered at the Toronto film festival, was nominated in two categories at the French Césars (2009); it is considered to be the first African sci-fi movie. Les Saignantes won the Silver Stallion & Best Actress Awards at Fespaco (Pan African Film Festival Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso) in 2007.\n\nThis dystopian, sci-fi comic thriller with stunning surreal visuals, presents extreme corruption, feminism, social decay and intergenerational conflict for review.\n\n2013 Banned in Cameroon in 2013, Jean-Pierre Bekolo's controversial film Le President (2015 AMAA Awards Best screenplay and Jury Special Prize) Aiming to incite viewers to conceive an alternate reality, his fake documentary The President is a hilarious, biting satire on African leaders who cling to power.\n\n2015 Les Choses et Les Mots de Mudimbe on the renowned Congolese philosopher, multi-linguist and uber-polymath. This 4 hours documentary was part of the official selection of the 2015 Berlinale. \"An unusual film, as fascinating as its object/subject, opulent, sensitive, clever, and radical. Another station of delightful postcolonial, cosmopolitan filmmaking\".\n\nJean-Pierre Bekolo is awarded for his creative resistance, irreverence and eclectic\n\nAfrican reworking of dominant cinema conventions; for creating a unique body of innovative\n\nwork that both entertains and transmits profound socio-political messages; for his highly\n\noriginal aesthetics; for challenging misrepresentations of African cultures; and for re-affirming the power of film.\n\n2016 Naked Reality\n\n2017 Miraculous Weapons (in Post-production)\n\n2017 Our Wishes (shooting)"
