        "text": "In February, LaCinetek invites Cameroonian director Jean-Pierre Bekolo. Discover his influences and recommendations!\n\nBekolo was revealed at the age of 25 at the Cannes Film Festival with Quartier Mozart (1992). He then went on to play at many renowned festivals, from the Berlinale to Sundance, where Aristotle's Plot (1995) was the first African film selected. Between dystopia and utopia, he hybridizes genres (real and fake documentary, science fiction, thriller...) and renews the views on contemporary Africa, from The Bloodettes, 2005, a pioneer film of African SF, to the experimental documentary Naked reality in 2016.\n\nHis list for LaCinetek makes us explore sub-Saharan cultures and cinematographies (from Djibril Diop Mambety to Souleymane Ciss√©), the Caribbean (with The Harder They Come, the first Jamaican film, contemporary with the emergence of reggae) or the African-American community (from Spike Lee's Los Angeles hip hop to John Singleton's). There is also an attraction to the cinema of the East (from the Maghreb to Bollywood), of Europe and of Hollywood, favoring social subjects treated with style, inventiveness and dreaminess."
