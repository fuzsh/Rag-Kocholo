        "text": "on 15 April, 7pm. At the Warehouse Theatre. Entrance Free.\n\nWe are launching the first\n\nNamibian film Agency/Distribution/Events company:\n\nIndependence Avenue Films.\n\nWith the screening of\n\nThe President (feature, Cameroon) and\n\nThe Projectionist (short film, Morocco)\n\non 15 April, 7pm. At the Warehouse Theatre.\n\nEntrance Free.\n\nIndependence Avenue Films will focus on events/agency/distribution of film products in Namibia.\n\nIn order to introduce ourselves we are inviting all interested members of the Namibian film and arts industry, the wider public and cultural-interested people to the launch of Independence Avenue Films on 15 April, 7pm, Warehouse theatre (backstage venue).\n\nAddressing the lack of a movie distribution and film agency company, Independence Avenue Films will serve as an institution to tackle the challenges faced by Namibian film products in terms of distribution, agency and marketing. We furthermore want to focus on film related events, as we believe in the need and possibility to establish a cinema culture in Namibia.\n\nFor us, independence avenue is an ongoing project. Independence was not gained in one day and should be a daily road we travel even today, in order to address social, political or economic challenges. Art is part and parcel of this daily process to reflect and comment on social challenges. Art, and here in particular film, can play a role to reflect and bring society forward. Hence the name Independence Avenue Films.\n\nTo celebrate the launch of this newly created entity, we present the Namibian Premiere of Jean-Pierre Bekolo's honest and daring film \"The President\" (Cameroon/Germany, 2013, 63 min), and Najat Jellab's short film \"The Projectionist\" (Morocco, 2013, 20 min).\n\nFilm must use its aesthetic and narrative potential to play a role in the African democratic process.\n\nContact details: Independence.Ave.Films@gmail.com"
