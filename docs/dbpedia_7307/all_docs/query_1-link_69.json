His restructuring and non-contentious work includes advising on schemes of arrangement and insurance business transfers.\n\nProfessional liability including professional negligence claims involving accountants, solicitors, barristers, architects and a wide range of specialist contractors.\n\nRecent appellate work includes landmark Supreme Court decisions: in Willers v Joyce (recognition of the tort of malicious prosecution in civil proceedings); in BPE Solicitors v Hughes-Holland (confirming the correctness of the Saamco principle in professional liability claims); and in BPE v Gabriel (the potential liability of insolvency practitioners for litigation costs incurred prior to their appointment).\n\nPrior to joining Chambers in 2004, Adam practised as an employed barrister at Clyde & Co, where he was heavily involved in insurance litigation and arbitrations arising out of the PA insurance spiral and the failure of split capital investment trusts. He continues to advise on insurance coverage and subrogation issues.\n\nExamples of Adam’s work include:"
