        "text": "Planning a move to Iceland? It’s becoming a popular choice with expats, drawn there by its breathtaking natural landscapes, thriving economy and high quality of life.\n\nWhether you’re moving there to work, study or simply to explore the country’s incredible scenery, you’ll need a way to manage your money in Iceland. A local bank account could be convenient, letting you get paid (if you’re working) and cover your bills.\n\nBut how easy is it to open a bank account in Iceland, and can you do it from the UK before your move?\n\nRead on for everything you need to know. Our helpful guide will cover things like the documents needed to open an Icelandic bank account, banking fees and the main banks you can choose from.\n\nAnd if you’re only moving or travelling to Iceland temporarily, consider checking out the Wise card – it’s designed for travellers to ease managing money abroad.\n\nPlease see the Terms of Use for your region.\n\nHow to open a bank account in Iceland as a foreigner?\n\nThere are no restrictions preventing foreign citizens from opening a bank account as a foreigner. However, all Icelandic banks require new applicants to have an Icelandic ID number known as kennitala. Everyone living in the country must have an electronic ID, as it’s needed for everything from banking to paying taxes.\n\nForeigners need to apply in person for their electronic ID.¹ People from EU countries can do this at the Registers Iceland, but those outside the EE/EEA will need to apply through the Directorate of Immigration.\n\nCan you open a bank account in Iceland as a foreigner from the UK?\n\nYou can open an Icelandic bank account as a UK citizen, but you’re unlikely to be able to do it while you’re still in the UK.\n\nThis is because you need an electronic ID number to apply for a bank account in Iceland. And to get this, you need to provide your residential address in Iceland.\n\nSo if you’ve not yet moved there or found somewhere to live in Iceland, you’ll need to wait until you arrive.\n\nCan you open a bank account online in Iceland?\n\nYes, it’s possible to open an Icelandic bank account online. But again, you’ll need to have your electronic ID number in order to do it.\n\nOnce you have your electronic ID, it should be a relatively quick and easy process to open your account online. Banks in Iceland have all embraced digital banking technology, so offer access to many of their services online.\n\n📚 Read more: The best UK bank accounts for travelling and travel insurance\n\nWhat documents do you need to open a bank account in Iceland?\n\nWhile the requirements can vary from bank to bank, you’ll usually need to provide the following to open a bank account in Iceland:¹\n\nYour electronic ID - this is stored in the SIM card on your mobile phone, so you’ll need to have a compatible SIM card. Once you have your kennitala ID number, you’ll be able to activate your ID through a bank or a mobile phone company.\n\nYour passport\n\nYour residence permit (as a citizen of a country outside of the EU/EEA).\n\nTypes of Icelandic bank accounts\n\nBanks in Iceland typically offer two main types of account:\n\nDebit accounts - these are the Icelandic equivalent of UK current accounts, designed for depositing your salary into. When you visit the bank’s website, you may see the option to apply for a debit card rather than an account. When you do so, you’ll get access to both the debit account and linked card.\n\nSavings accounts - these come in many forms, including interest-paying currency accounts, fixed interest accounts, first home savings accounts and dedicated accounts for young people and retirees.\n\nWhich Icelandic bank is best for foreigners and expats?\n\nThere are three main banks for retail customers in Iceland. These are Íslandsbanki, Landsbankinn and Arion Bank.\n\nLet’s take a look at each of these in turn, including what they have to offer for new arrivals.\n\nÍslandsbanki\n\nWith a history dating back to 1875, Íslandsbanki is a universal bank with 12 branches and a network of ATMs across the country.² It’s the second-largest bank in Iceland.\n\nIt offers services for both personal and business customers, with products including:²\n\nCurrent/debit accounts\n\nSavings accounts\n\nDebit and credit cards\n\nLoans, including mortgages, personal loans and car finance.\n\nLandsbankinn\n\nThe largest bank in Iceland, Landsbankinn has roots dating back to 1886 - although the bank in its current form was established in 2008. The bank is owned by the National Treasury of Iceland.⁶\n\nIt’s a universal bank, offering services to both personal and business banking customers. It has a large network of branches and ATMs across the country, as well as offering digital banking services.\n\nIts products include:⁷\n\nSavings accounts\n\nPayment cards\n\nLoans, including mortgages, inflation-indexed and non-indexed loans, and car loans.\n\nArion Bank\n\nThe third-largest major bank in Iceland, Arion Bank provides services in three separate areas - retail banking, corporate/investment banking, and markets. It has 15 branches and service centres across the country.³\n\nFor retail customers, it offers services such as:³\n\nPayment cards\n\nSavings accounts\n\nLoans, including mortgages and vehicle financing\n\nPension savings\n\nInsurance.\n\nDigital-only alternatives to banks\n\nThere are also a number of digital-only money management providers available in Iceland. These don’t have any physical branches, so you’ll usually manage your account online or through a mobile app.\n\nThis can be a convenient option, especially if you haven’t yet moved to Iceland and want to get an account set up. But just be aware that as these aren’t bank accounts, they may not offer the same protections, security and services.\n\nHere are some of your options for digital-only accounts:\n\nWise\n\nBunq\n\nN26\n\nRevolut\n\nIndo\n\nVivid Money.\n\n📚 Read more: Online banks and alternative providers in the UK\n\nWhat kinds of banking fees and charges can you expect in Iceland?\n\nWherever in the world you bank, there will always be some fees to watch out for. Below, we’ll run through the kinds of banking charges you can expect when you open a bank account in Iceland.\n\nAccount maintenance fees\n\nWhile it can vary between banks, you can usually expect there to be some sort of annual charge for having an Icelandic bank account.\n\nIn most cases, you’re not likely to be charged an account maintenance fee on the account itself. But you will almost certainly pay an annual debit card fee. This can range from between 790⁴ to 950 ISK⁵, which is only around £4.78 to £5.75.\n\nPayment charges\n\nIcelandic banks may also charge some payment fees for one-off payments, direct debits and using your debit card.\n\nThese fees are typically very small, but they can add up. To give you an idea, here are the payment charges when you open an account with Landsbankinn:⁴\n\nPayments made through online banking - 80 ISK (£0.48 GBP)\n\nDebit card payments - 18 ISK (£0.11 GBP)\n\nInternational payments through online banking - 900 ISK (£5.45 GBP).\n\nOther fees to look out for\n\nDepending on the bank, you may also be charged fees for:\n\nOverseas card purchases and cash withdrawals\n\nBank services carried out in branches or service centres (it’s always recommended to carry out transactions online if you can)\n\nCredit cards - these usually have an annual fee\n\nRequesting a printed account statement.\n\nWise – Money for here, there and everywhere\n\nA bank account isn’t the only way to manage your finances in a different country. Many expats, international students and digital nomads use Wise instead.\n\nWise is a money services provider, offering a multi-currency account, international money transfer services and a debit card.\n\nOpen a Wise account online and you can manage your money in multiple currencies and get a Wise card to spend internationally at the mid-market exchange rate.\n\nSign up with Wise today 🚀\n\nPlease see the Terms of Use for your region or visit Wise fees & pricing for the most up-to-date information on pricing and fees.\n\nFAQ on how to open a bank account in Iceland\n\nStill have questions about bank accounts and money in Iceland? Take a look below for a little more information.\n\nCan I use online banking in Iceland?\n\nYes, online banking is the norm in Iceland, so you’ll have access to a full range of digital and in-app banking services.\n\nCan I use my UK debit/credit card in Iceland?\n\nYou can use your UK card in Iceland, but watch out for the fees. UK banks tend to charge foreign transaction fees whenever you spend in a different currency. And if you’re using a credit card, you’ll almost definitely be charged a fee for any cash-based transactions, such as withdrawing money from an ATM.\n\nCan I withdraw money from an ATM in Iceland?\n\nYes, you can use your debit card to withdraw cash from ATMs in Iceland, and you’ll find a decent network across major towns and cities. But just be aware that your bank may charge a small fee for debit card transactions.\n\nAnd that’s it - all the essential info you need on how to open a bank account in Iceland from the UK. As long as you have that all important electronic ID number, you should find it reasonably easy to do.\n\nThere isn’t a huge amount of choice when it comes to banks, but then that could make it a little easier to select an account.\n\n📚 Read more: Cost of living in Iceland\n\nSources used:\n\nÍslandsbanki - Banking in Iceland\n\nÍslandsbanki - Branches\n\nArion Bank - About Arion Bank\n\nLandsbankinn - Interest rates and fees\n\nArion Bank - Interest rates and fees\n\nWikipedia - Landsbankinn\n\nLandsbankinn - Personal"
