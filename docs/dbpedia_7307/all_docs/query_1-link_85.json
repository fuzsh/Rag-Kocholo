Practical assessment of the situation concludes that Japan cannot and will not have a military advantage over china if a military or economic confrontation erupts, despite the limited protection of the United States nuclear umbrella and its allies………..Various factors limits the amount of help the united states will be able to provide japan, and some are overplaying their cards in the current situation.\n\nIf a confrontation erupts, this will test the whether the U.S. will be able to commit its full military contingent to aid Japan in a dispute over an island (S), which would affect the world economy. Japan might not like the outcome and find itself more isolated than before with a few illusions broken.\n\nA mutually beneficial arrangement with regard to the island would go further to maintaing peace and stability in the region and prove to the world that Asia can manage and is competent in dealing with its own affairs.\n\n______________________\n\nThe trappings and illusions of Democracy\n\nDemocracy was the political means by which the Wet south and used to dominate the world but what is democracy. I briefly elaborated on the subject in this blog posted on the month of Aug 2012.\n\nDemocracy is a double-edged sword, and although in its beginnings might have been a means of equality (which was only for the chosen few), even that was an illusion. The early democracies were empires in and of themselves and committed atrocities. The United States and much of the western world were democracies in name but had apartheid systems, with disenfranchisement for years….\n\nIt was only when it was necessary to create the perception of a full democracy as means to an end with regards to the state, that people started paying or creating the illusion of a full on democracy, to win the cold war for global hegemony.\n\nDemocracy literally means rule by the people-true democracy would constitute direct votes, so throughout history you see modification of democracy, with no country on earth really being a true democracy in the pure sense of the word.\n\nDuring the cold war the west discovered that democracy can be effectively used as a means of divide and conquer by having and creating numerous factions, who can be manipulated from the shadows, externally by those economically and financially powerful to do so. This has the effect of diluting a unified forces or identities into squabbling parts who are functionally vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nDemocracy is heralded as the great equalizer, but there are far more inequality in the world today than in the history of human kind under the banner of democratic and civil society perpetuated y an economic policy of capitalism.\n\nThus, what is the cause of inequality, poverty and wars?\n\nThe political system is democracy and the economic system is capitalism. Both are double-edged swords. Both have room for abuse.\n\nThen what are the solutions to the problems?\n\nWhat is to be done?\n\nDemocracy creates factions to be exploited\n\nCapitalism exploits and disposes\n\nThus, the two go hand in hand-\n\nThe big myth being spread is a return to morality (which is true), but the myth of it is that morality can only be applied by religious doctrine and teachings, this is a historical lie, and from the days when religion took the role democracy now holds.\n\nReligious fear did not prevent many a historical atrocities the dwarfs Stalin Russia and the Nazis were not atheists, when taken consecutively throughout recorded human history.\n\nI personally suffer on a daily basis from the machinations of the religious mafia here\n\nRussia cannot and will not be caught up in Religious squabbles within its borders. The Russian Orthodox Church and other religious groups will do just fine with their adherents within a civilized Russia.\n\nThis is why Russia will remain a secular state so as to maintain the balance of forces political and economical.

Russia tried to warn Europe but to no avail, now the Europeans (citizens) are realizing that their so termed elected leaders are agents of various interests except their own after all.\n\nThe united tates will not become energy independent (the myth) to supply enough engergy to Europe, it is impossible at the moment. Let’s say the U.S overcame the technological hurdles to efficiently extract minreal and geological resources without causing massive (90% percent) environmental damge and degradation to its landscape, it would take 30 years before the infrastructure is complete and the energy reaches Europe, by then Europe will become a third world region and economically dead.\n\nThe same structures which undermine the middle east are the same structures and forces which undermines Europe.\n\nSaudi Arabia is it the point where it can no longer sustain its geographic advantage, with regards to its energy resources. That is why the arab spring will be coming to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Countries, which they are currently bathed in the false sense of security from the West, for not allowing it in their territory. In fact one could safely assume based on recent analysis, that the tools and actors are already in place waiting of for the goahead.\n\nRussia should balance its books and respond accordingly.\n\nThe Saudi Security establishment is not as infiltration proof as some people think it is. Saudi Arabia was sold out long ago….How could the King have spinal and back problems and no one knows the cause after all this years…\n\nFor the moment Russia does not need to change its gas export laws——The days when Europe and the West had much to offer Russia in terms of economic viability is over.\n\nThe capital outflows occurring in Russia are from those who realize they can no longer repeat the 1990s economics of rape and pillaging the Russian economy, let them go, as they have no where else to go.\n\nIdeally, in the efficient sense, there should be a market equilibrium concerning capital inflow and outflow, and a reserve for when there is disequilibrium. This is akin to a water reservoir or wetland, if not well maintained, will be depleted before replenishment or natural disaster, which can and will result in environmental havoc in a domino effect. In the case of the reservoir, one hopes for no prolonged droughts which can and will deplete it, so you have more than one for differing conditions, but no one ever really plans this way, because they think things will go on the same forever.\n\nThe US and much of the West have run its course for this sort of pillage, so what they do is look to emerging markets to economically pillage and rape. This doesn’t last, because like the laws and other analogies of nature, when you milk or over-milk the cow, eventually it runs out of milk or stops producing, either due to old age or over-milking, or more specifically, the cow has been milked to oblivion without giving it time to rest and recuperate to regain market equilibrium, because of one mantra and condition spread through capitalist dogma as acceptable, that word is “GREED”.\n\nMy observation nothing more\n\n_______\n\nFor years they did some stupid profile trying to glean information of what I like and don’t like, for what purpose?\n\nThen trying to used gleaned information to get into my personal space\n\n______________\n\n21 Dec 2012\n\nPain along spine continues, with headaches, chest pain and difficult breathing, swollen tongue, pain in throat.

The used the inherent military culture of following orders corrupted it, allowed discipline to lax, so that corruption should flourish and removed military culture under the guise of fighting various isms, which they instigated and spread.\n\nIn effect they privatized the military as an extension of privatizing the military industrial complex.The military industrial complex had become corrupt, but the actual military despite various short comings could have relied on the rule of law, standards and discipline. That is no longer the case\n\nPrivatization essentially means cronyism, without checks, balances and accountability. It is dictatorship wrapped in corporate fascism. Where bullying covert and overt is promoted as a means of ensuring conforming and obedience. That was the reason for the push of religious structure, to create conformity and obedience without question.\n\nThat they have implanted in various militaries around the world, to include the middle east and the Russian Federation, where some of their agents still reside.\n\nThat is a recipe for disaster.

The deactivation of the transmitter was not taking place when the spacecraft was flying in the shadow of the Earth for prolonged periods of time.

Abdominal pain increasing, starting to have massive abdominal and spinal pain.\n\n_________\n\nDid you see this harassment, in just two days it ridiculous\n\nI told you so\n\n_________________\n\nRandom observations\n\nThe recent debts ceiling debacle confirms what the collaboration has been stating, the Americans are not in control of their own house, which creates myriad of problems on the geo-political stage.\n\nIt would appear that under the banner of “Austerity,” these measures serves a variety of purposes, mainly to launch a cold war against China and Asia.\n\nAn often overlooked fact, is that the goal of the instigated Sino-Soviet split was to procure the financial resources to challenge the Soviet Union. China had leverage but they did not realize thus fully at the time. The seeming success of post-WWII European economic recovery was one of the biggest myths perpetuated in the history of geo-politics.\n\nRecovery did exist, but it was superficial, as we are now seeing the consequences, so it seems an initiated instigation between The Russian Federation and the European Union would allow NATO to engage China in Asia, however, Europe has no leverage, military, political or otherwise against the Russian Federation, this was made clear in the 2008 South Ossetian War,a result of total reliance under the nuclear umbrella.\n\nThus, there is no equivalent of China today, to contest china in a new cold war as The Russian Federation and China are strategic allies now, by virtue of geographic proximity, space and now thanks to Nato aggression, a shared history of being geopolitically targeted by NATO.\n\nThus, “Austerity” was meant to siphon money from Europe and thus Function as a financial bedrock to contest China, however the citizenry of Europe is not up for the task, revolt in Europe is inevitable.\n\nEuropeans genuinely believed in the post WWII proclamations of NATO dressed in fancy free, but would never guess, that they would be treated like this, as is now the case, the Soviet Union Pointed out to the then Czhekoslovakia\n\nNATO is now incapable of a repeating in Syria what was done in Libya, as the gloves are of, a ground invasion of Syria full force has a 85% chance of erupting into a regional conflagration, with dire consequences for the countries within proximity.\n\nEven technologically advanced states have their limits, more specifically, there are limits, to what a technologically advanced military can do, NATO is now realizing this, because China, Russia and Iran now hold the geopolitical advantage of brinksmanship and surprise.\n\nThe missiles in each militaries arsenals are more than enough to overcompensate and damage NATO’s, NAVAL and Aviation Fleets.\n\nIt’s the Missiles, Stupid\n\nAnd Russian despite some military loss after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, possesses some superb missile systems, that is second to none.\n\nThe battle was over taxes versus entitlements, while the conveniently overlooked mechanism of increased production was left out.\n\nProponents of no taxes argue that the revenue from taxes alone hurt the wealthy capitalist producers and everyone else by not allowing the producers to be comfortable doing what they do, without the haggle of taxes. Blatantly overlooking the fact that, the largest form of welfare in the states is of the corporate kind and they have not produced, only hoarded and flee. Also, that a lot of wealthy do consider that they need to be taxed.\n\nProponents of taxes argue that the wealthy make enough and more money, since they control and profit from the most resources, to be able to shoulder the most tax burdens.\n\nTranslation:\n\nThe economy is in the shits\n\nThe Republicans and anti-tax company propose a cut to spending, but where have they been in the production of jobs and sustainable income so that the tax burden can be evenly spread to help maintain some form of market equilibrium. If you’re not going to tax, then where is the revenue going to come from?\n\nSo far everyone is hoarding their money.\n\nThe Democrats and pro tax company propose more taxes and public spending but do not prepare the masses for the fluid change in market forces with regard to jobs and professions. No one has been prepared for the post-industrial, post-modern, and post-20th century workforce in the context of educational and vocational skills, thus the labor force was just left to languish.\n\n______\n\nObjective analysis:\n\nWhen the no tax company speaks of allowing the wealthy and producers to do what they do, they are talking about corruption, plain and simple.\n\nThere within lies the problem, the cold war was fought over two ideologies and capitalism won out, why, because a lot of dirty tricks were used and justified by capitalist and at the heart of that is greed and corruption. The former breeds the latter and vice versus.\n\nThe entire capitalist system at its heart and foundation , despite rule of law and civil society functions on corruption and corrupt practices to facilitate and dispossess at the expense of the masses for the few, thus creating market disequilibrium. So, now we are seeing the consequences of this method, economic madness.\n\nFirst justified as a means to fighting external enemies and the like, corruption crept its way into the system like a cancer, into the political and economic structures of various organizations, governments, societies and the like, using the subalterns and the privileged alike.\n\nThat is why after so many years and months now, there is no sound solution to these economic problems. Every one learned it, greed and corruption: “Get rich or die trying, by any means necessary”\n\nIt has come back to bite the world in the ass with a vengeance\n\n“There is always enough for everyone, but never enough for that one greedy man” and this applies to economics in the broader context\n\nWhat is to be done?\n\n______\n\nWell, they’ve been using their position at UH Manoa to black list and Harass me\n\nDemocracy? I see no Democracy here\n\nAnd as usually some bug is monitoring my computer\n\n_______________\n\nGiving credit where it is do, based upon the publicly available technical characteristics of it missile systems, Russia as achieved the ability to create missile standoff with regards to engagement of large scale NAVAL ships and Aircraft formations. This in essence, limits the ability for NATO to project conventional ground forces within proximity (if they are not already stationed closer-which another means is already employed to counter that) of Russia, as NATO has no counter to this missile systems due to their inherent technical capabilities, and level of sophistication, which is at the peak of technological innovation for the forseeable future.\n\nIf anything this is missile supremacy, in terms of the brad range, capabilities and various mission characteristics these missile systems can perform, which act quality force multipliers with the respective conventional and nonconventional platforms.\n\nThe Russian Federation has created a formidable missile force\n\nHats off their engineers\n\n__________\n\nRandom observations and I told you sos\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/02/tsunami-bomb-in-development-world-war-ii-top-secret-documents_n_2397856.html?utm_hp_ref=world\n\n‘Tsunami Bomb’ In Development During World War II, Documents Note\n\nA New Zealand author has rediscovered evidence of top secret tests carried out by the United States and New Zealand during World War II. The tests explored the creation of a “tsunami bomb” capable of flooding coastal cities of the Allies’ enemies.\n\nRay Waru came across the material while digging through old military files for his new book, “Secrets and Treasures,” which details some of the historical artifacts available at Archives New Zealand in Wellington, the AFP reports.\n\n“It was absolutely astonishing,” Waru told the outlet. “First that anyone would come up with the idea of developing a weapon of mass destruction based on a tsunami…and also that New Zealand seems to have successfully developed it to the degree that it might have worked.”\n\nDubbed “Project Seal,” the materials document the joint effort by the U.S. and New Zealand to develop a device that might rival the destructive power of the atomic bomb. According to the Telegraph, 3,700 bombs were detonated during testing that took place between 1944 and 1945 off the coast of New Caledonia and Auckland.\n\nThe results showed that such a weapon, deployed in the form of a series of 10 large underwater blasts, could have created a 33-foot tsunami.\n\n“Presumably if the atomic bomb had not worked as well as it did, we might have been tsunami-ing people,” Waru told The Telegraph.\n\nAuckland University Professor Thomas Leech, who was held in high regard by U.S. military officials, helped conduct the experiments, according to a previous New Zealand Herald story about the project.\n\nThe tsunami-as-weapon idea had been floated even earlier than 1944, according to The Herald, which reported that they considered sending Leech to Bikini Atoll to watch the early atomic bomb tests.\n\nNeil Kirton, a former colleague of Leech, said that, “Whether it could ever be resurrected … Under some circumstances I think it could be devastating.” (This quote has since surfaced on various conspiracy theory blogs.)\n\nThe news of “Project Seal” follows renewed interest in a top secret plan to detonate an atomic bomb on the moon. That plan, researched during the Cold War, was designed as a show of force to the Soviets, who were fresh off their Sputnik triumph.\n\n______\n\nThe Nazis developed something more sinister, lost in the history books, they never got to fully try it\n\nEarthquakes anyone?\n\n________\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nQuestion?\n\nCa you muster a large enough population to harass and track someone?\n\nWell, in theory you could if these groups were third of fourth tier counter intelligence or auxillary operatives and agents\n\nI.e. church goers, sports clubs or pocket groups connected through some social organizational structure.\n\nThat could in this day and age use software and the like of twitter to coordinate and move about\n\nThe next level in the covert and weird\n\nI would have never believed it, had I not seen it\n\n______\n\nwas at the DMV today, dirty paper on the flour picked it up, someone thought it was a SPY message, these people are unbelievable\n\n_________\n\nThen there was that crazy, out of this world idea of using sophisticated diamond tipped tunnel diggers under other countries, the kind used to dig large, deep underground tunnels, which at the end of the tunnel mission have no where to go but to be buried or are they really buried that is, some one proposed that idea pre-WWII, who knows if it ever happened\n\n______\n\n3 Jan 2013\n\nPain along spine continues, with headaches, chest pain and difficult breathing, swollen tongue, pain in throat.

It is accompanied subsequently, naturally by increases in military capabilities.\n\nTo establish the policy of denying this of any nation is in effect, an advanced (preemption) declaration of total war against the intellectual, technological and scientific capabilities of any sovereign state.\n\nBecause, to maintain this supremacy comes at the expense of the other sovereign states intellectual, scientific, technological and subsequently military capabilities, or more plainly put, the maintaining of sovereign states within the stone age in perpetuity.\n\nThis is nothing more than slavery by another name\n\nThis serves also, as the rallying cry and potential platform for Asia and the rest of the w world to rally around as they increasingly become more weary of western double motives.\n\nThey will plainly surmise that if after more than half a century, the world is an eddies of crises and instabilities, then the western world had no intention of global stability amongst equal human beings, but a master slave relationship.\n\nThis will create the impetus for regional coalitions and groupings as a from of collective protection against western interference and push for all sorts of dominance under the guises of democracy, human rights and balance of power politics.\n\nSoon observers will start remarking and noticing, if Japan was not able to surpass China economically, whose fault is that?

The only difference being, is that the market for production shifted to where the labor was cheaper.\n\nThis was evidenced by the case of American Cars who could not compete in quality with their foreign competitors, even though made in America is now being marketed as a luxury brand.\n\nIn fact mass production was not originally geared towards quality, it was for quantity and economic consumption. Luxury brands were geared towards quality…………….\n\nMost of the scientific innovations of the United States came from foreigners and continues to this day, that is why America lags the world in math and science in the education analysis and testing of its students, the never had that scientific base, the had the religious and political base, even the brightest citizens during the American revolution were British, French and other European subjects.\n\nThe entire United States programs can be attributed to Nazis scientists, and Werner Von Braun (A Nazis-who is immortalized in the Halls of the US Army Ordnance Branch hall of fame), a result of Operation Paper clip.\n\nTo this day the numerous scientists who contribute to the United States technology and innovation are foreigners.\n\nMaking the rest of the world inhospitable, to siphon off their brightest minds..\n\n________\n\n“Syria ?….

To Lt. Col. James Gentry of the Indiana National Guard, who was stationed at the Qarmat Ali water treatment center in Iraq just after the 2003 U.S. invasion, it was “just different-colored sand.” In their first few months at the base, soldiers were told by KBR contractors running the facility the substance was no worse than a mild irritant.\n\n_____________________\n\n9-10 Jan 2013\n\nI could ( a standing student) not get an appointment with PResident Greenwood\n\nHe staff blatantly stonewalled me in violation of a few laws an ethics could, using campus security, and faculty from other departments.\n\nAccording to them the University PResident, was either too busy, not available and off the island and her safety was in jeopardy, which I am sure was what they sold her if anyone even spoke to her..\n\nThere is not governing body, authority or person for University students to direct any redress or observations….\n\nThe university is Run amok, and external forces have free rein with the entire campus, no wonder things are the way they are…\n\nThey had non-security personnel tracking me, and relaying information in real time, ahead of time to each office I visit and attempt to visit……\n\nThis was involving personnel and staff of local origin and distinction as well as none locals, to include the Vp of Academic affairs….\n\nNo personnel from the civl rights office was available because the office is understaffed…\n\nThey have effectively removed any mechanism for redress from their harassments, which I would wager the same thing was done at the schools where the shootings incidents occurred\n\nThe mechanism of redress that were supposed to be at the local level were not there, for one reason or another\n\nThe only way this could be happing in a vacuum, is because of an inter-twining of local and university politics, in a corrupt manner through the manipulation of the faculty senate….\n\nEvery person they directed me to, was a placed agent (most of whom, happen to be female-the feminist twist meant to create sympathies-a female advisor pointed that out), meant to frustrate and redirect my redress and inquires.\n\nAlong with the religious, military, blind man and disabled personnel each placed in my path and each observed independently by independent parties, to harass psychologically.\n\nNumerous messages was sent and left with president Greenwoods secretary whom is never available, which defies logic as either one or the other is neither available at the same time…\n\nTwo collaborators are of the opinion that this harassment has a feminist element to it, I replied “well, that would make sense and carry them ark of Dina Dahbny Miraglia, but lets give them for the moment the benefit of the doubt…\n\nI asked them for further verification of the feminist element..Someone recognizes Ms Miraglia, and know some her exploits.\n\nThe Russian Federation, I am willing to bet, will find this pattern at a few of their

obscuring dispositions and extolling sensibilities in an elaborate scheme of deception and mayhem designed to drive a person crazy.\n\nSuch a thing had to take years to build and develop to the

groups.\n\n___\n\nThe clicker requirement for these courses are is experiment without the students consent…..\n\nThe keep the results looked up, how does using the clicker contribute to students passing the course is questionable and only subjective data is available, because these covert studies do not go beyond the classroom and asses external factors, unless they are secretly spying on these students…\n\nThe Chair at the Math Depart gave me a run around as to the answer, I took offense that the professor would tell us we are experiments in this endeavor.\n\n_______\n\nRunning around
