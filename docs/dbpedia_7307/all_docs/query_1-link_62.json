(AIM, TSX-V, NASDAQ Iceland: AMRQ), an independent mining company with a substantial land package of gold and strategic energy transition mineral assets in Southern Greenland, confirms, further to its announcement on 11 February 2024, its intention to conduct a placing and subscription of new common shares (“Common Shares”) to raise gross proceeds of approximately £30.0 million (equivalent to approximately C$51.0 million or ISK5.2 billion) (the “Fundraising”) at a price of 74 pence (C$1.25, ISK127) per new Common Share (the “Placing Price”), with the net proceeds being used to accelerate development and exploration activities. As announced on 11 February, the Company has already received indications of interest from investors in excess of £30.0 million at the Placing Price.\n\nHighlights\n\nThe approximately £30.0 million Fundraising will consist of:\n\nA proposed placing of new Common Shares (the “UK Placing Shares”) with new and existing institutional investors (the “UK Placing”), at the Placing Price;\n\nA proposed placing of new depositary receipts representing new Common Shares (the “Icelandic Placing Shares”) with new and existing investors (the “Icelandic Placing”), at the Placing Price; and\n\nA proposed private placement of new Common Shares (the “Canadian Subscription Shares”, together with the UK Placing Shares and the Icelandic Placing Shares, the “Fundraising Shares”) by certain existing institutional investors and a director of the Company at the Placing Price (the “Canadian Subscription”). The Director has committed to subscribe for approximately £2.0 million (equivalent to C$3.4 million or ISK 343 million) in the Fundraising.\n\nNet proceeds from the Fundraising will be used to accelerate mining of the Target Block at the Company’s cornerstone Nalunaq gold project (“Nalunaq”) and other associated works to enable a smoother transition to nameplate capacity of 300 tonnes per day to the processing plant, installation of a flotation circuit and dry-stack tailings facility (“DSTF”) to increase recoveries, as well as provide funding to accelerate exploration during 2024 across the Company’s Vagar, Nanoq and Gardaq JV licences.\n\nDetails of the Fundraising\n\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (“Stifel”) is acting as sole bookrunner and broker on the UK Placing. Stifel is also acting as the Company’s nominated adviser.\n\nLandsbankinn hf. (“Landsbankinn”) and Fossar fjárfestingarbanki hf. (“Fossar”) are acting as joint bookrunners on the Icelandic Placing and Landsbankinn is acting as underwriter.\n\nIn relation to the UK Placing:\n\nThe UK Placing will be conducted through an accelerated bookbuild process (the “Bookbuild”) to be conducted by Stifel, which will launch immediately following the release of this announcement and will be made available to eligible institutional investors subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix to this announcement. The Bookbuild is expected to close no later than 6.00 p.m. (London time) on 12 February 2024, however Stifel and the Company reserve the right to close the Bookbuild earlier or later, without further notice;\n\nThe UK Placing is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix to this announcement (collectively, the “Announcement”); and\n\nThe UK Placing is conditional, amongst other things, upon the Icelandic Placing not having been terminated prior to admission of the Fundraising Shares to trading on the AIM market of London Stock Exchange plc (“AIM”) and the receipt of conditional approval from the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSX-V”) for the listing of the Fundraising Shares.\n\nLandsbankinn has agreed to underwrite the Fundraising by up to £10 million guaranteeing to the Company participation in the Fundraising in the maximum amount of £30 million, with the commitment to procure subscribers or itself subscribe for new Common Shares to be delivered as Depositary Receipts amounting to an amount equal to the difference between £20 million and £30 million, or its equivalent in ISK.\n\nAllocations in the UK Placing are at the absolute discretion of Stifel, in consultation with the Company. The number of Fundraising Shares will be determined following completion of the Bookbuild by agreement between the Company and Stifel. Allocations in the Icelandic Placing are at the absolute discretion of the Company. Details of the number of Fundraising Shares will be announced as soon as practicable after the close of the Bookbuild.\n\nEldur Olafsson, CEO of Amaroq, commented:\n\n“We are investing to increase recoveries at Nalunaq and to accelerate our exploration plans in our strategic mineral acreage across Southern Greenland, which has become one of the last frontiers for Western governments and companies to secure scaled supply of strategic minerals so desperately needed for the energy transition. By further de-risking the development of Nalunaq whilst also advancing exploration in both gold and strategic minerals, we believe we can deliver value for shareholders. It is a very exciting time to be the largest acreage holder in Southern Greenland.”\n\nEnquiries:\n\nAmaroq Minerals Ltd.\n\nEldur Olafsson, Executive Director and CEO\n\neo@amaroqminerals.com\n\nEddie Wyvill, Corporate Development\n\n+44 (0)7713 126727\n\new@amaroqminerals.com\n\nStifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (Joint Bookrunner, Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\n\nCallum Stewart\n\nVarun Talwar\n\nSimon Mensley\n\nAshton Clanfield\n\n+44 (0) 20 7710 7600\n\nLandsbankinn hf.

Amaroq has been listed on the TSX-V since July 2017, AIM since July 2020, First North between November 2022 to September 2023 and the Icelandic Exchange since September 2023.\n\nThe Company acquired the Nalunaq gold project in 2015 and has made significant progress since this time in expanding the extent of the resource base through drilling, incorporating a new geological model (the Dolerite Dyke model) to better understand the distribution of the high-grade ore, building a new 50-person winterized camp to allow full-year activities, and acquiring and otherwise progressing much of the infrastructure required to bring Nalunaq into production. During this time, Amaroq has also been able to acquire the largest package of mineral rights in southern Greenland with a number of assets that are highly prospective for gold and strategic minerals. The addition of strategic minerals into the portfolio provides significant growth potential, as these metals and minerals, such as copper, nickel, titanium and graphite, are critical for increased electrification as part of the world’s decarbonisation strategy and as independent supply continues to become an increasing focus for nations globally.\n\nKey developments at Nalunaq since AIM admission in 2020 include:\n\nInfrastructure: since admission, Amaroq has completed a significant proportion of Nalunaq’s required infrastructure, with 60% of major processing plant equipment procured, a 50-person all weather exploration camp constructed and commissioned, critical surface mobile equipment purchased and supporting infrastructure either purchased or commercially and technically evaluated.\n\nThird Party Engineering Study: Halyard Inc. (Halyard) was engaged to complete a third party engineering study on Nalunaq’s development costs including the process plant, mobile equipment, surface infrastructure, permanent camp and associated logistics and engineering. The study concluded that the advanced engineering of the overall project is now to Feasibility Study level based on the Canadian requirements of National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Project (“NI 43-101”).\n\nThe Dolerite Dyke Model: Amaroq has worked with SRK Consulting to develop a robust Mineral Resource estimation technique for Nalunaq. This included the development of the Dolerite Dyke Model to account for the high-grade variability from core sampling (the ‘nugget effect’) in order to better reflect the full resource potential at Nalunaq. The model allows the geological results to be incorporated into the Halyard engineering study in order to move the project towards independent technical studies to support further development.\n\nResource Growth through Drilling: Amaroq has drilled approximately 23,924 metres at Nalunaq since it listed on AIM and, incorporating learnings from the new Dolerite Dyke model, has identified two new high-grade zones, namely Valley Block and Welcome Block, taking the total number of identified high grade zones at the asset to five. The Valley Block is now expected to be one of the key targets for initial development. As a result of drilling in the 2020 and 2021 field seasons, Amaroq announced on 6 September 2022 that it had increased its total Inferred Mineral Resource by 30% contained gold, with a 50% increase in average grade, since the previous estimate reported in 2020. The resource now sits at 355 Kt @ 28.0 g/t Au for 320 Koz gold, putting the project in the top 2% of projects globally in terms of reported gold resource grade.\n\nDebt Financing: Amaroq has raised a US$50.9 million senior secured package comprising a US$18.5 million term loan, US$22.4 convertible notes, and a US$10 million overrun loan to fund the transition of the Company’s Nalunaq mining licence from a bulk sample trial mining development plan to staged, full scale production of gold doré on site by bringing forward construction of a processing plant and associated infrastructure.\n\nMining Contract Awarded: Amaroq has signed a contract mining agreement with Thyssen Schachtbau GmbH and a procurement and supply chain support agreement with Tamarack Mining Services to support the restart of Nalunaq.\n\nDelivering on our ESG mandate: The Company has worked hard over the period to update its Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) and Social Impact Assessment (“SIA”), and will continue to do so over the coming months in line with the terms of its exploitation licence.\n\nFollowing the Company’s progress outlined above, Nalunaq has transitioned to a full restart operation with mine rehabilitation works having commenced during Q4 2023 following detailed design work, site preparation, procurement of remaining long-lead items and camp upgrades. Key contracting processes are almost complete and overall engineering for the processing plant is 85% complete. During 2024 the Company is expected to commence trial mining at 100 tonnes per day which will deliver first gold from the process plant. Preparation for a phased ramp-up to 300 tonnes per day process plant design capacity will continue throughout the year. The Company also recently commenced the public consultation process for the draft EIA and SIA report on Nalunaq and is expected to close the consultation process by March 1, 2024.\n\nThrough ongoing work with its internal technical management and external consultants, the Company has identified several initiatives to enhance Nalunaq’s restart which will require additional funding. The main initiative is accelerating development of the Target Block which will undergo trial mining in conjunction with the Mountain Block. As currently designed, the Mountain Block will only deliver c.100 tpd to the process plant which has nameplate capacity of 300 tpd, resulting in intermittent operation of the plant. The acceleration of Target Block will allow for 350 days of operations at 300 tpd, thus right-sizing mining operations for optimal plant utilization. This is expected to have a significant impact on unit costs as ~75-80% of process plant costs are estimated to be fixed. The Company also plans to invest in infrastructure extensions to allow the two blocks to be mined concurrently and begin preparatory works at the South & Valley Blocks to ensure a smooth transition and a 300 tpd mining rate, when mining of the Mountain Block is complete. This will include de-watering of the existing workings and underground mapping and exploration.\n\nThe second major identified initiative involves the installation of the flotation circuit and the DSTF which is expected to deliver increased recoveries from 79.5% to 94%.\n\nOutside of Nalunaq development, the Company also plans to accelerate certain advanced exploration at the Company’s high priority gold targets, including scout drilling at the Vagar and Nalunaq satellite areas, targeting additional resources to feed the mill at Nalunaq as well as a drill programme at Nanoq to prepare for a maiden resource. In addition, proceeds will fund the Company’s share of the Gardaq Joint Venture with GCAM LP to expedite strategic metals target generation, including an an aerial geophysics survey and expanded drilling programme at Sava to target copper porphyry mineralization, and a drill programme at Stendalen to define the full extent of the copper and nickel mineralization.\n\nSources and Uses of Proceeds\n\nThe net use of proceeds from the Fundraising will be used to fund the accelerated development of the Target Block, infrastructure investment to allow for the mining of two blocks simultaneously, preparatory works at the South & Valley Blocks, installation of the flotation circuit and DSTF, and accelerated exploration at Vagar/Nanoq and the Gardaq joint venture. By further de-risking the development of Nalunaq and advancing exploration activities across Amaroq’s gold and strategic minerals portfolio, the Company intends to enhance value creation in anticipation of delivering shareholder returns.\n\nProceeds CAD$ millionsISK millionsGBP millionsExchange rate​​CAD:ISK 102.064​CAD:GBP 0.587​Fundraising51.105,215.47​30.00Transaction Costs(1.55)(158.2)(0.91)Total Net Proceeds49.555,057.2729.09\n\nUses of Net ProceedsCAD$ millionsISK millionsGBP millionsExchange rate​​CAD:ISK 102.064​CAD:GBP 0.587​Acceleration of Target Block​12.33​1,258.45​7.24​Infrastructure Extension to Mine 2 Blocks7.02​716.49​4.12​South Block / Valley Block Preparation ​3.75​382.74​2.20​Dry Stack Tailing Facility and Flotation18.72​1,910.64​10.99​Exploration for strategic minerals and gold7.73788.954.54Total Uses of Net Proceeds49.555,057.2729.09\n\nAs a result of the Fundraising, the Company will become net debt free.\n\nIn case of oversubscription of the Fundraising, the Company may increase the offer size with the use of additional proceeds to be focused on further exploration at Vagar and Nanoq and a capital injection into its Gardaq joint venture.\n\nBookbuild\n\nStifel is acting as sole bookrunner and broker on the UK Placing. Stifel is also acting as the Company’s nominated adviser. Landsbankinn and Fossar are acting as joint bookrunners on the Icelandic Placing, and Landsbankinn is acting as underwriter.\n\nThe Bookbuild for the UK Placing will launch immediately following the release of this Announcement. The Bookbuild is expected to close no later than 6.00 p.m. (London time) on 12 February 2024, but Stifel and the Company reserve the right to close the Bookbuild earlier or later, without further notice.\n\nThe UK Placing is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix to this Announcement.\n\nThe number of Fundraising Shares will be determined following completion of the Bookbuild by agreement between the Company and Stifel. Allocations in the UK Placing are at the absolute discretion of Stifel, in consultation with the Company, and will be confirmed orally or by email following the close of the Bookbuild. Details of the Fundraising Shares will be announced as soon as practicable after the close of the Bookbuild.\n\nBy choosing to participate in the UK Placing and by making an oral and legally binding offer to acquire UK Placing Shares, investors will be deemed to have read and understood this Announcement in its entirety (including the Appendices) and to be making such offer on the terms and subject to the conditions of the UK Placing contained here, and to be providing the representations, warranties and acknowledgements contained in the Appendix.\n\nApplications will be made for admission of the Fundraising Shares to trading on (a) AIM; (b) the Nasdaq Iceland Main Market (the “Icelandic Exchange”); and (c) the TSX-V, with listing subject to the conditional approval of the TSX-V and the Company satisfying all of the requirements of the TSX-V. It is currently expected that admission will become effective, and that dealings in the Fundraising Shares will commence, on AIM at 8.00 a.m. GMT on 23 February 2024, on the Icelandic Exchange at 9.30 a.m. UTC on 23 February 2024 and on the TSX-V at 9:30 a.m. ET on 23 February 2024 (or in each case such other date as may be agreed between the Company and Stifel).\n\nRelated Party Transaction\n\nA Directors of the Company has indicated their intention to participate in the Canadian Subscription for approximately £2.0 million (equivalent to C$3.4 million or ISK 343 million) in aggregate. As such, the Canadian Subscription will constitute a “related party transaction” within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”) and within the meaning of Policy 5.9 of the TSX-V rules.\n\nRelated party transactions require the Company to obtain a formal valuation and minority shareholder approval unless exemptions from these requirements are available under applicable Canadian securities laws. With respect to the Canadian Subscription, the Company is relying on the exemption from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements in sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a), respectively, of MI 61-101, as the fair market value of the securities distributed to, and the consideration received from, interested parties does not exceed 25% of the Company’s market capitalization. The Company did not file a material change report at least 21 days prior to the expected closing of the Canadian Subscription as participation of the insiders had not been confirmed at that time and the Company wishes to close on an expedited basis for business reasons.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, all amounts are based on ISK:GBP of 173.34 and C$:GBP of 1.6996 as at 9 February 2024.\n\nAbout Amaroq\n\nAmaroq’s principal business objectives are the identification, acquisition, exploration, and development of gold and strategic metal properties in Greenland. The Company’s principal asset is a 100% interest in the Nalunaq Project, an advanced exploration stage property with an exploitation licence including the previously operating Nalunaq gold mine, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Nalunaq A/S. The Company has a portfolio of gold and strategic metal assets in Southern Greenland covering the two known gold belts in the region. Amaroq is incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act and wholly owns Nalunaq A/S, incorporated under the Greenland Public Companies Act.\n\nQualified Person Statement\n\nThe Mineral Resource Estimate was prepared by Dr Lucy Roberts, MAusIMM (CP), Principal Consultant (Resource Geology), SRK Consulting (UK) Limited an independent Qualified Person in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101.

or\n\n(b) a “qualified institutional buyer” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act (a “QIB”); and\n\n8. it understands that the allocation of UK Placing Shares to it if it is in the United States shall be conditional on the execution by it of an investor representation letter in the form provided to it.\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PLACEES ONLY REGARDING THE UK PLACING\n\nBookbuild\n\nFollowing this Announcement, Stifel will commence a bookbuild process in respect of the UK Placing (the “Bookbuild”) to determine demand for participation in the UK Placing by Placees. The book will open with immediate effect following release of this Announcement. This Appendix gives details of the terms and conditions of, and the mechanics of participation in, the UK Placing. No commissions will be paid to Placees or by Placees in respect of any UK Placing Shares.\n\nStifel and the Company shall be entitled to effect the UK Placing by such alternative method to the Bookbuild as they may, in their sole discretion, determine.\n\nDetails of the Placing Agreement and the UK Placing Shares\n\nStifel is acting as placing agent in connection with the UK Placing. Stifel has entered into a placing agreement (the “Placing Agreement”) with the Company under which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Placing Agreement, it has, as agent for and on behalf of the Company, agreed to use its reasonable endeavours to procure Placees for the UK Placing Shares at a price of 74 pence per UK Placing Share (the “Placing Price”). The number of UK Placing Shares in the UK Placing will be determined following completion of the Bookbuild and set out in a term sheet to be entered into between Stifel and the Company (the “Term Sheet”). The final number of UK Placing Shares, Canadian Subscription Shares and the number of Icelandic Placing Shares will be decided at the close of the Bookbuild. The timing of the closing of the book and allocations will be at the discretion of Stifel. Details of the number of UK Placing Shares, Canadian Subscription Shares and the number of Icelandic Placing Shares will be announced as soon as practicable after the close of the Bookbuild.\n\nIn accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions in the Placing Agreement, the UK Placing is not underwritten by Stifel and in the event that subscribers are not obtained for all or any of the UK Placing Shares (being the “Unplaced Shares”) or in the event of a default to make payment by any subscribers procured by Stifel, there will be no obligation on Stifel to subscribe for any Unplaced Shares or defaulted UK Placing Shares.\n\nThe UK Placing Shares will, when issued, be subject to the constitutional documents of the Company and credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing issued Common Shares in the capital of the Company, including the Canadian Subscription Shares and the Icelandic Placing Shares, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid in respect of such Common Shares after the date of issue of the UK Placing Shares.\n\nAlongside the UK Placing, the Company has proposed a placing in Iceland of new Common Shares at the Placing Price, being the “Icelandic Placing Shares”. Fossar and Landsbankinn are acting as joint bookrunners in connection with the Icelandic Placing. The Company has entered into a service agreement with Fossar and Landsbankinn in relation to the Icelandic Placing (“Icelandic Service Agreement”). Landsbankinn has agreed to underwrite up to £10 million of new Common Shares or new depositary receipts representing Common Shares, subject to £20 million being placed in the Fundraising, reducing pound for pound to the extent that the Fundraising raises gross proceeds of more than £20 million.\n\nPursuant to the Fundraising, the Company is seeking, in aggregate, to raise gross proceeds of approximately £30.0 million (equivalent to approximately C$51.0 million or ISK5.2 billion), to expand its resource base and accelerate exploration. Alongside the UK Placing and Icelandic Placing, the Company has also procured certain subscriptions of Canadian Subscription Shares at the Placing Price, being the Canadian Subscription. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms and Conditions set out in this Appendix apply to the UK Placing, but do not apply to the Icelandic Placing or the Canadian Subscription.\n\nAs set out under “Conditions of the UK Placing”, the UK Placing is conditional upon, amongst other things, the Icelandic Subscription Agreements and the Canadian Subscription Agreements being wholly unconditional. The Icelandic Placing is conditional upon, amongst other things, the Service Agreement not having been terminated prior to the subscription for the Icelandic Placing Shares and the conditional approval of the TSX-V.\n\nApplications for admission to trading\n\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the Fundraising Shares, including the UK Placing Shares, to trading on AIM (“Admission”).\n\nIt is expected that Admission will become effective at 8.00 a.m. (London time) on 23 February 2024 (or such later date as may be agreed between the Company and Stifel).\n\nThe Company will apply for conditional approval of the TSX-V, with respect to the UK Placing Shares, subject to the satisfaction by the Company of any conditions imposed by the TSX-V. It is expected that admission of the UK Placing Shares on the TSX-V will become effective on or around 9.30 a.m. (Toronto time) on 23 February 2024 (or such later date as may be agreed between the Company and Stifel).\n\nThe Company has applied for listing of the Fundraising Shares, including the UK Placing Shares, on the Icelandic Exchange, with admission expected to become effective at 9.30 a.m. (Reykjavik time) on 23 February 2024.\n\nParticipation in, and principal terms of, the UK Placing\n\nStifel is acting as sole bookrunner and broker in connection with the UK Placing. Stifel is acting as agent of the Company. Stifel is also acting as nominated adviser to the Company. Participation in the UK Placing will only be available to persons who may lawfully be, and are, invited by Stifel to participate. Stifel and its Affiliates are entitled to enter bids as principal in the Bookbuild.\n\nThe Bookbuild, if successful, will establish the number of UK Placing Shares to be issued and allotted by all Placees whose bids are successful. The number of UK Placing Shares and the aggregate proceeds to be raised through the UK Placing will be agreed between Stifel and the Company following completion of the Bookbuild. The number of UK Placing Shares will be announced on a Regulatory Information Service (“Placing Results Announcement”) following the completion of the Bookbuild and entry into the Term Sheet by the Company and Stifel.\n\nTo bid in the Bookbuild, Placees should communicate their bid by telephone to their usual sales contact at Stifel. Each bid should state the number of UK Placing Shares which a prospective Placee wishes to subscribe for at the Placing Price. Bids may be scaled down by Stifel on the basis referred to in paragraph ‎7 below. Stifel reserves the right not to accept bids or to accept bids in part rather than in whole.\n\nThe Bookbuild is expected to close no later than 6.00 p.m. (London time) on 12 February 2024 but may be closed earlier or later, at the absolute discretion of Stifel. Stifel may, following consultation with the Company, accept bids that are received after the Bookbuild has closed. The Company reserves the right (upon agreement of Stifel) to reduce or seek to increase the amount to be raised pursuant to the UK Placing, in its discretion.\n\nEach Placee’s allocation will be agreed between Stifel and the Company and will be confirmed to Placees orally or in writing by Stifel, acting as agent of the Company, following the close of the Bookbuild, and a contract note will be dispatched as soon as possible thereafter. Subject to paragraph ‎11 below, Stifel’s oral or written confirmation to such Placee will constitute an irrevocable legally binding commitment upon such person (who will at that point become a Placee) in favour of Stifel and the Company, under which such Placee agrees to subscribe for the number of UK Placing Shares allocated to it and to pay the Placing Price for each such UK Placing Share on the Terms and Conditions set out in this Appendix and in accordance with the Company’s constitutional documents.\n\nThe Company will release the Placing Results Announcement following the close of the Bookbuild, detailing the aggregate number of the UK Placing Shares, Canadian Subscription Shares and Icelandic Placing Shares to be issued.\n\nSubject to paragraphs 2 and ‎3 above, Stifel may choose to accept bids, either in whole or in part, on the basis of allocations determined at its discretion and may scale down any bids for this purpose on such basis as it may determine or be directed. Stifel may also, notwithstanding paragraphs ‎2 and ‎3 above, following consultation with the Company, (a) allocate UK Placing Shares after the time of any initial allocation to any person submitting a bid after that time; and (b) allocate UK Placing Shares after the Bookbuild has closed to any person submitting a bid after that time. The acceptance of offers shall be at the absolute discretion of Stifel. If within a reasonable time after a request for verification of identity, Stifel has not received such satisfactory evidence, Stifel may, its absolute discretion, terminate the Placee’s UK Placing participation in which event all funds delivered by the Placee to Stifel will be returned without interest to the account of the drawee bank or CREST account from which they were originally debited.\n\nThe UK Placing Shares are being offered and sold by the Company (a) outside the United States to non-US persons in offshore transactions as defined in, and pursuant to, Regulation S, or (b) in the United States to a limited number of investors reasonably believed to be QIBs who have delivered to the Company and Stifel an investor representation letter in the form provided to it, in transactions not involving any “public offering” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and/or pursuant to an exemption from, or transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

Each Placee will also have an immediate, separate, irrevocable and binding obligation, owed to Stifel (as agent of the Company), to pay it (or as it may direct) in cleared funds an amount equal to the product of the Placing Price and the number of UK Placing Shares that such Placee has agreed to acquire. Such Placees’ obligations will be owed to the Company and to Stifel. The Company shall allot such UK Placing Shares to each Placee following each Placee’s payment to Stifel of such amount.\n\nExcept as required by law or regulation, no press release or other announcement will be made by Stifel or the Company using the name of any Placee (or its agent), in its capacity as Placee (or agent), other than with such Placee’s prior written consent.\n\nIrrespective of the time at which a Placee’s allocation(s) pursuant to the UK Placing is/are confirmed, settlement for all UK Placing Shares to be acquired pursuant to the UK Placing will be required to be made on the basis explained below under “Registration and Settlement”.\n\nAll obligations under the Bookbuild and UK Placing will be subject to fulfilment of the conditions referred to below under “Conditions of the UK Placing” and to the UK Placing not being terminated on the basis referred to below under “Termination of the UK Placing”.\n\nBy participating in the Bookbuild, each Placee will agree that its rights and obligations in respect of the UK Placing will terminate only in the circumstances described below and will not be capable of rescission or termination by the Placee.\n\nTo the fullest extent permissible by law, neither Stifel, nor the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall have any responsibility or liability (including to the extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) to Placees or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise. In particular, neither Stifel, nor the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall have any responsibility or liability (including, to the extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) in respect of Stifel’s conduct of the Bookbuild or of such alternative method of effecting the UK Placing as Stifel, its Affiliates and the Company may agree or determine.\n\nConditions of the UK Placing\n\nThe UK Placing is conditional upon the Placing Agreement becoming unconditional and not having been terminated in accordance with its terms.

Any such extension or waiver will not affect Placees’ commitments as set out in this Announcement. Stifel may terminate the Placing Agreement in certain circumstances, details of which are set out below.\n\nPlacees will have no rights against Stifel or the Company under the Placing Agreement pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (as amended) or otherwise.\n\nNeither Stifel, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any of its or its Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees, agents or advisers shall have any liability to any Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) in respect of any decision Stifel may make as to whether or not to waive or to extend the time and/or date for the satisfaction of any condition to the UK Placing nor for any decision any of them may make as to the satisfaction of any condition or in respect of the UK Placing generally and by participating in the UK Placing each Placee agrees that any such decision is within the absolute discretion of Stifel.\n\nBy participating in the Bookbuild, each Placee agrees that its rights and obligations cease and terminate only in the circumstances described above and under “Termination of the UK Placing” below and will not be capable of rescission or termination by it.\n\nTermination of the UK Placing\n\nStifel is entitled to terminate the Placing Agreement in accordance with its terms in certain circumstances, including, inter alia, if at any time before Admission in the opinion of Stifel (acting in good faith):\n\nany statement contained in the documents issued by the Company in connection with the UK Placing is incorrect or has become or been discovered to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or misleading in any material respect or that there has been a material omission therefrom;\n\nany of the warranties given by the Company under the Placing Agreement was, when given, in any material respect, untrue or inaccurate or misleading;\n\nany of the warranties given by the Company under the Placing Agreement is not, or has ceased to be, in any material respect, true or accurate or not misleading (or would not be true, accurate or not misleading if then repeated) by reference to the facts subsisting at the time;\n\nthe Company has failed to comply with any of its obligations contained in the UK Placing Agreement;\n\nthere has occurred a suspension or cancellation by either the AIM, the TSX-V or the Icelandic Exchange of trading in the Company’s securities on any of AIM, the TSX-V or the Icelandic Exchange, other than a suspension of trading in the Company’s securities on the TSX-V to facilitate the Bookbuild;\n\nany of the Icelandic Service Agreement or the Icelandic Letter of Commitment having terminated or lapsed;\n\nthere are any facts, matters or circumstances which give rise to, or are reasonably likely to give rise to (in the opinion of Stifel acting in good faith) a claim under the indemnities given by the Company for the beneﬁt of Stifel under the Placing Agreement;\n\nthe appointment of Stifel as agent of the Company under the Placing Agreement is terminated for whatever reason;\n\nthere shall have occurred any signiﬁcant new factor, mistake or inaccuracy in the information in this document requiring in the opinion of Stifel, acting in good faith, a supplementary press document to be published by or on behalf of the Company; or\n\nthere has occurred, in the opinion of Stifel acting in good faith, a Material Adverse Change whether or not foreseeable at the date of the Placing Agreement.\n\nOn the occurrence of any one or more of the above-mentioned circumstances, Stifel may, in its absolute discretion, by notice in writing to the Company (or by orally communicating the same to the Company), terminate the Placing Agreement with immediate effect.\n\nUpon such notice being given, the parties to the Placing Agreement shall be released and discharged (except for any liability arising before or in relation to such termination) from their respective obligations under or pursuant to the Placing Agreement, subject to limited exceptions.\n\nBy participating in the UK Placing, each Placee agrees that its rights and obligations terminate only in the circumstances described above and under the “Conditions of the UK Placing” section above and will not be capable of rescission or termination by it after oral confirmation by Stifel following the close of the Bookbuild.\n\nBy participating in the Bookbuild, each Placee agrees with the Company and Stifel that the exercise by the Company or Stifel of any right of termination or any other right or other discretion under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of the Company or Stifel or for agreement between the Company and Stifel (as the case may be) and that neither the Company nor Stifel need make any reference to, or undertake any consultation with, Placees and that neither they nor any of their respective Affiliates’, agents, directors, officers or employees shall have any liability to Placees (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) whatsoever in connection with any such exercise.\n\nNo prospectus\n\nThe UK Placing Shares are being offered to a limited number of specifically invited persons only and will not be offered in such a way as to require any prospectus or other offering document to be published. No prospectus or other offering document has been or will be submitted to be approved by the FCA in relation to the UK Placing or the UK Placing Shares and Placees’ commitments will be made solely on the basis of publicly available information taken together with the information contained in this Announcement, and any Exchange Information (as defined below) previously published by or on behalf of the Company simultaneously with or prior to the date of this Announcement and subject to any further terms set forth in the contract note sent to individual Placees.\n\nEach Placee, by participating in the UK Placing, agrees that the content of this Announcement and the publicly available information released by or on behalf of the Company is exclusively the responsibility of the Company and confirms to Stifel and the Company that it has neither received nor relied on any other information, representation, warranty, or statement made by or on behalf of the Company (other than publicly available information) or Stifel or their respective Affiliates or any other person and none of Stifel or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates or any other person will be liable for any Placee’s decision to participate in the UK Placing based on any other information, representation, warranty or statement which the Placees may have obtained or received (regardless of whether or not such information, representation, warranty or statement was given or made by or on behalf of any such persons). Each Placee acknowledges and agrees that it has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial or other position of the Company in accepting a participation in the UK Placing. No Placee should consider any information in this Announcement to be legal, tax or business advice. Nothing in this paragraph shall exclude the liability of any person for fraudulent misrepresentation.\n\nLock-up\n\nThe Company has undertaken to Stifel that, between the date of the Placing Agreement and 120 calendar days after the Closing Date, it will not, without the prior written consent of Stifel (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), enter into certain transactions involving or relating to the Common Shares, subject to certain customary carve-outs agreed between Stifel and the Company.\n\nBy participating in the UK Placing, Placees agree that the exercise by Stifel of any power to grant consent to waive the undertaking by the Company of a transaction which would otherwise be subject to the lock-up under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of Stifel and that they need not make any reference to, or consult with, Placees and that they shall have no liability to Placees whatsoever in connection with any such exercise of the power to grant consent.\n\nRegistration and settlement\n\nSettlement of transactions in the UK Placing Shares (ISIN: CA00108V1022) following Admission will take place within the relevant system administered by Euroclear (“CREST”), using the delivery versus payment mechanism, subject to certain exceptions. Subject to certain exceptions, Stifel and the Company reserve the right to require settlement for, and delivery of, the UK Placing Shares to Placees by such other means that they deem necessary if delivery or settlement is not practicable in CREST within the timetable set out in this Announcement or would not be consistent with the regulatory requirements in the Placee’s jurisdiction.\n\nIn order to enable Placees in the United Kingdom to settle their securities through CREST, the Company has appointed Computershare Investor Services plc to act as a depositary (the “Depositary”) to hold the Common Shares and issue dematerialised depositary interests representing the underlying Common Shares (“Depositary Interests”). The Depositary will hold the Common Shares on trust for the relevant shareholders.\n\nThe Depositary Interests are independent English securities and held on a register maintained by the Depositary. The Depositary Interests have the same security code and ISIN number as the underlying Common Shares which they represent and do not require a separate admission to AIM. Any references to UK Placing Shares in this Announcement shall include any Depositary Interests issued in relation to the same.\n\nFollowing the close of the Bookbuild for the UK Placing, each Placee allocated UK Placing Shares in the UK Placing will be sent a contract note stating the number of UK Placing Shares to be allocated to it at the Placing Price, the aggregate amount owed by such Placee to Stifel and settlement instructions. It is expected that such contract note will be despatched on or around 12 February 2024 and that this will also be the trade date.\n\nEach Placee agrees that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is completed in accordance with either the standing CREST or certificated settlement instructions that it has in place with Stifel. The Company will deliver the UK Placing Shares to a CREST account or account operated by Stifel as agent for the Company and Stifel will enter its delivery instruction into the CREST system. Stifel will hold any UK Placing Shares delivered to this account as nominee for the Placees. The input to CREST by a Placee of a matching or acceptance instruction will then allow delivery of the relevant UK Placing Shares to that Placee against payment. It is expected that settlement will be on 23 February 2024 on a T+9 basis in accordance with the instructions given to Stifel.\n\nInterest is chargeable daily on payments not received from Placees on the due date in accordance with the arrangements set out above at the rate of two percentage points above SONIA as determined by Stifel.\n\nEach Placee agrees that, if it does not comply with these obligations, Stifel may sell any or all of their UK Placing Shares on their behalf and retain from the proceeds, for the Company’s own account and benefit, an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee plus any interest due. The relevant Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the Placing Price and for any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (together with any interest or penalties) which may arise upon the sale of its UK Placing Shares on its behalf.\n\nIf UK Placing Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, Placees must ensure that, upon receipt, the conditional contract note is copied and delivered immediately to the Relevant Person within that organisation. Insofar as UK Placing Shares are registered in a Placee’s name or that of its nominee or in the name of any person for whom a Placee is contracting as agent or that of a nominee for such person, such UK Placing Shares should, subject as provided below, be so registered free from any liability to United Kingdom stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. Placees will not be entitled to receive any fee or commission in connection with the UK Placing.\n\nRepresentations and warranties\n\nBy participating in the Bookbuild, each Placee (and any person acting on such Placee’s behalf) irrevocably acknowledges, confirms, undertakes, represents, warrants and agrees (for itself and for any such prospective Placee) with Stifel (in its capacity as placing agent of the Company in respect of the UK Placing) and the Company, in each case as a fundamental term of its application for UK Placing Shares, the following:\n\nit has read and understood this Announcement in its entirety and that its acquisition of and subscription for UK Placing Shares is subject to and based upon all the terms, conditions, representations, warranties, indemnities, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings and other information contained herein and that it has not relied on, and will not rely on, any information given or any representations, warranties or statements made at any time by any person in connection with Admission, the Bookbuild, the Company, the UK Placing, the UK Placing Shares or otherwise;\n\nthat no offering document or prospectus or admission document has been or will be prepared in connection with the UK Placing or is required under the EU Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or the rules of the Icelandic Exchange or the Rules of the TSX-V and it has not received and will not receive a prospectus, admission document or other offering document in connection with Admission, the Bookbuild, the Company, the UK Placing or the UK Placing Shares;\n\nthat the Common Shares are traded on AIM and that the Company is therefore required to publish certain business and financial information in accordance with MAR and the AIM Rules for Companies (collectively, the “Exchange Information”), which includes a description of the nature of the Company’s business and the Company’s most recent balance sheet and profit and loss account, and similar statements for preceding financial years and that it has reviewed such Exchange Information and that it is able to obtain or access such Exchange Information;\n\nthat none of Stifel, the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates nor any person acting on behalf of any of them has provided, and none of them will provide it with any, material or information regarding the UK Placing Shares, the Bookbuild, the UK Placing, the Company, the Icelandic Placing or the Icelandic Placing Shares or the Canadian Subscription or any other person other than the information in this Announcement;
