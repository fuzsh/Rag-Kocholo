Will your institution be left behind? From $70 billion today, this market is projected to reach as much as $320 billion by 2030 — offering incredible opportunities for those who take action now. → For banks and financial institutions, embedding financial services into other products is no longer a choice; it is an imperative strategy. It unlocks new revenue streams and builds customer loyalty. The opportunity is clear, but the window won't stay open forever. → Consider Buy Now Pay Later: from $3 billion in 2019 to $37 billion today, and on a path to grow to as much as $167 billion by 2032. → Other high-growth markets are emerging with similar potential. These are the kinds of markets in which the first movers will experience surging revenues against still-manageable entry costs. Your institution could be at the forefront of this transformation. To explore how you can lead this change, we invite you to join us at the Nordic Banking Forum on 28th November in Helsinki for a session on “Embedded Finance: Smoothing Transactions for B2B Companies.” We'll share concrete, real-world use cases and zero in on critical improvement areas. You’ll also have the opportunity to engage in open and candid discussions with industry leaders. Partner slots are available. 🔋 #NordicBankingForum #HelsinkiFinTech #DigitalBanking #EmbeddedFinance #DigitalPayments\n\n$6.6 billion to pay - from banking elephants to crypto whales. The major common ground in our industry that leading players share is large fines imposed for many violations, such as AML, GDPR, sanctions, KYC, CDD, consumer protection failures, and wholesale conduct breaches. → In 2023, global regulators issued $6.6 billion in penalties to financial institutions, with AML fines making up $4.6 billion of this amount. For the first time, crypto firms topped traditional FIs for AML-related regulatory fines at $4.5 billion, followed by payment firms at $1.4 billion. You must have probably heard of the largest recent fines — like Binance at $4.3 billion and Deutsche Bank with $186 million — with penalty totals since 2000 for the German bank over $20 billion according to Violation Tracker. → If we go down the list in the last several years, you will find big names like HSBC, Citigroup, BNP, UBS, Credit Suisse, Revolut, Bank of Queensland, Commerzbank, Monzo, Starling, and other #crypto firms like FTX, Coinbase, Robinhood, BlockFi, etc. → And here in the #Nordics, we have our own stories. The famous Danske Bank scandal alone exceeded €200 billion in suspicious transactions, with fines of circa €2 billion. Other regional leaders, such as Swedbank, SEB, and DNB, have all faced large penalties. In all, we are talking about billions. 🤑 Over time, there has been an increase in both the number and amount of fines imposed. ☑ That is why, here in our Digital Banking Academy at Helsinki Fintech Farm, we put a lot of focus on #compliance with the modules. It is under an even higher bar for the industry, as new regulatory bodies enhance #AML efforts from 2025 onwards. → Also, regulators are making many processes easier, like filing Suspicious Activity Reports; some feasible Compliance & #RegTech solutions aid institutions in digitizing and automating a risk-based compliance approach to protect against enforcement in a complex and heavily regulated environment. → The last emerging area of focus is #ESG compliance. In 2023, ESG-related fines against financial institutions surged by 246% to $19 million. Watch for this category that's coming hot next. 📈 Yes, it's a deep and often expensive conversation. You now have a chance to be involved in open and frank discussions with leaders on both the industry and regulatory sides. Join us in Helsinki on November 28th at our Digital Banking Forum. Partner slots are available. 🔋 👀 Below is an image of the largest financial fines assessed in 2023.

Aiming to impact the planet through business transactions, our Finnish partner, Enfuce, is introducing a new commercial card program to Síminn Pay's 14,000 Icelandic business accounts with an integrated carbon footprint tracker by Deedster. ☑ Enfuce’s secure, scalable, and innovative card payment solutions are already trusted in Iceland. For example, one of their partnerships is with Kvika banki hf., which processes around 25% of #payments in the country. Here's a catchy add-on: → Integrated tracker from Deedster provides transparent data on transaction #carbon emissions, thus giving companies choices: from sustainable suppliers to reduced-waste business dealings. It is a great move. Early adopters win, but why? → With tightening regulations and market demands nearing, they can track their footprint, drive sustainable business practices, and prove their commitments to the stakeholders with transparent data. 🇮🇸 Also, Iceland itself is an interesting place, leading the way. → The country now generates 99.99% of its electricity from renewable energy, and 97.4% of the heating comes from geothermal energy. → The Icelandic banking sectors have started blending #ESG factors into their activities, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2040. Notably, Iceland's commitment to #sustainability is very evident in Iceland's green bond issuance, which has raised an overwhelming response from investors of over €7 billion💰 → Cooperations: major Icelandic banks like Landsbankinn, Íslandsbanki, and Kvika banki hf. drive their payment services by working with agile #fintech firms. In those collaborations, the worlds of payments and sustainability meet on the ground, with more players contributing to the land of fire 🔥 and ice ❄. We congratulate Enfuce, Deedster, and Síminn Pay and welcome them to discuss this topic at the Nordic Banking Forum on November 28th in Helsinki, which will attract industry leaders. Partner slots are available🔋 Let's look forward to more great partnerships within the #Nordics ecosystem, all for a good cause. #NordicBankingForum #HelsinkiFinTech #Iceland #DigitalBanking\n\nAre the Nordics too dependent on Germany? During the Nordic Banking Forum last year, Johan Javeus from SEB, pointed out that Nordic economies are highly reliant on Germany, which in turn depends heavily on its manufacturing industry (as shown in the video ⤵). Johan stated, “Germany is very important for us in the northern part of Europe because we rely a lot on Germany in Scandinavia, in the Nordics.” 📉 Indeed, the #Nordics have felt tremors from Germany’s economic problems, particularly in manufacturing. According to the European Commission, this year supply chain disruptions and fluctuating energy prices will cut down Germany’s GDP growth rate to 1.2%. ➡ This downturn affects the Nordics considering our heavy reliance on imports from and exports to Germany. However, the Nordic banks are not standing still. ☑ They are broadening their partner base so that they do not over-rely on one market alone; Finland 🇫🇮 and Sweden 🇸🇪 for instance are expanding their trade with Southeast Asia and India which have a strong economic growth trend. ☑ Moreover, these diversification attempts are backed by digitalization efforts being led by Nordic banks themselves. Danske Bank has introduced advanced supply chain finance solutions that enable businesses to handle global supplier risks. SEB is funneling money into digital trading platforms that offer easier and safer transactions across countries all over the world supply chains. ☑ Finally, Nordic banks are leveraging the shift towards #sustainability to create new opportunities. With a global focus on renewable energy, Nordic banks fund green projects supporting environmental goals and stimulating economic growth to reduce dependence on traditional industries impacted by the slowdown. In 2024, Nordic investments in green technology are expected to increase by 15% led mainly by the #banking sector. 💡 What are your thoughts on the strategies Nordic banks are using to reduce their dependence on Germany? 🔋 Want fresh insights from top Nordic banking minds in 2024? Join Johan and other executives at the Nordic Banking Forum on November 28 in Helsinki. Partner slots are available! #NordicBankingForum #HelsinkiFinTech #NordicBanking #DigitalBanking\n\nDid you see the recent largest funding 🥇 in the history of Finnish fintech? 💸 Recent AlphaSense capital raising of $650m, increasing its valuation to $4bn is a record-breaking round. This round of financing was co-led by Viking Global Investors and BDT & MSD Partners and featured new investors such as J.P. Morgan and SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2. ▶ Consequently, AlphaSense also announced that it will acquire Tegus for $930 Million.
