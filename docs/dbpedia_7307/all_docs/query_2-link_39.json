        "text": "BBA//Fjeldco is the lead Icelandic counsel for Marel hf., one of Icelandâs largest and most valuable companies which is listed on Nasdaq Iceland, as the recipient of a non-binding proposal from John Bean Technologies Corporation (âJBTâ) for the combination of the two companies in late 2023. In January 2024 it was publicly announced that JBT intended to make a voluntary takeover bid for all shares in Marel under the Icelandic Act on Takeovers. Our involvement included drafting and providing input on structure and transaction documents, as well as advice on disclosure requirements and implications of the imminent offer on the conduct of the companyâs business and the duties of its board. This is a particularly complex transaction as its cross-border elements raise a number of novel issues, JBT and Marel are competitors, Marel is listed in Iceland and has a large shareholder base by Icelandic measures, JBT is listed in the United States and subject to filing requirements there, and the consideration offered by JBT is a mix of JBT shares and cash. This M&A transaction is as big and complex as they come in Iceland and if the takeover is successful, it would constitute the biggest public takeover in Iceland since 2007.\n\nOn 26 February 2024, subsequent to receiving an approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of Simlandi injection as an interchangeable biosimilar to arthritis drug Humira, Alvotech announced that the company had accepted offers from Icelandic and European professional investors or eligible counterparties for the secondary sale of shares for a value of approximately USD 166 million.\n\nAlvotech is a biotech company that specialises in the development and manufacturing of biosimilar medicines for patients worldwide and was the first Icelandic company to be dual listed in the US and Iceland.\n\nBBA//Fjeldco was Alvotechâs legal advisor with respect to the secondary sale of shares and congratulates its management team and employees on the important milestone achieved in the companyâs journey to offer broader access worldwide to more affordable biologics, following approvals of Alvotechâs biosimilars in other global markets.\n\nBBA//Fjeldco acted as advisors to Landsbankinn and Fossar fjÃ¡rfestingarbanki in connection with the private placement of new shares in Amaroq Minerals Ltd. The fundraise was a success, with the initial target being to raise some GBP 30 million, which was then expanded to approximately GBP 44 million due to significant excess demand. BBA//Fjeldco's role in the offering was to handle all documentation between the company and the banks and between the company and investors. Furthermore, BBA//Fjeldco assisted the banks with the market sounding process, as well as collecting and compiling subscriptions on behalf of the company and announcing the allocation to investors.\n\nBBA//Fjeldco acted for Danish multinational company Coloplast in the acquisition of the entire share capital of Kerecis. The transaction values the target company at up to USD 1.3 billion, making Kerecis the first so-called \"unicorn\" coming out of Iceland and is therefore among the largest M&A deals in the history of the country.\n\nBased in Isafjordur, in the Westfjords of Iceland, Kerecis has grown fast on the back of its innovative wound care product based on fish-skin technology. Coloplast is a global leader in providing intimate health care services that develops and manufactures products that help people with private medical conditions to improve their quality of life.\n\nThe strong commercial presence of Kerecis in the US and the buyer being a Danish company added complexity to the due diligence exercise and closing mechanics, providing an opportunity for BBA//Fjeldco to make good use of its cross-border experience.\n\nBBA//Fjeldco acted for SafÃ­r byggingar ehf., a real estate development company and constructor, in the ISK 5,1 billion acquisition of âProject Orkureiturâ, a new BREEM certified sustainable neighbourhood in ReykjavÃ­k covering 40,000 m2, including 436 apartments, plus shops and services. BBA//Fjeldco acted as legal counsel to SafÃ­r byggingar ehf. in relation to the acquisition and in respect of all applicable areas in both the acquisition and future development of the area, including by conducting a due diligence review of the area, negotiating and documenting the share purchase agreement agreements, finance documents, structuring and drafting subscription and share purchase agreements for investors as well as all corporate matters with regards to the transaction and the ongoing operations of the company. BBA//Fjeldco also advised SafÃ­r byggingar ehf. on financing in relation to development which was conducted both via new equity from investors and third party bank loans. Furthermore, BBA//Fjeldco advises SafÃ­r byggingar on an ongoing basis with all corporate, employee and planning matters in relation to the project.\n\nHorn IV slhf., an ISK 15bn private equity fund operated by Landsbref hf., has acquired a 45% shareholding in REA ehf., which is the sole shareholder of the Icelandic ground handling companies Airport Associates and SouthAir, which both play an important role in the operations of Keflavik international airport.

(one of the largest contractor companies in Iceland for the past few decades) regarding recognition of liability. Â This is the first time an Icelandic court decides on the choice of law between the current and previous statutes of limitations in with regard to contractual damages under contracts made before the entry into force of the current statute, as well as the effect of indirect involvements in court proceedings in that regard.\n\nBBA//Fjeldco provided legal advice to LangisjÃ³r with regards to LangisjÃ³rÂ´s acquisition of Freyja, including legal and tax due diligence, negotiating and drafting the share purchase agreement.\n\nThe family business Freyja, established in 1918, is the oldest candy production company in Iceland. Freyja produces and markets countless of well-known brands both for the Icelandic market and for export, where the sweets from Freyja are in constant demand.

The takeover offer was made to all shareholders at the end of January 2023 and will be closed in February 2023. The deal was particularly challenging and complex due to both the regulatory requirements relating to takeovers of listed companies and due to the time sensitivity of the transaction. BBA//Fjeldco also acted as legal counsel to Arion bank in relation to the bankâs financing of AU22âs OTC acquisition of shares prior to the takeover bid. This included negotiating, structuring, and drafting multiple facility agreements, guarantee agreement and other finance documents.\n\nBBA//Fjeldco advised the Icelandic Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Climate, by preparing a comparison report on wind energy legislation in Scotland, Norway, Denmark and New Zealand. The report focussed on the regulatory aspects of wind energy production, including the licensing procedure, environmental matters, administrational and municipal decision-making, involvement of governmental bodies, disputes and claims, including land rights, incentives and more. The report further provides a high-level reference to wind energy legislation in France, Sweden and the Netherlands. The report will be relied upon by a task force, established by the Icelandic Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Climate, currently working on a draft legislation for wind energy in Iceland.\n\nBBA//Fjeldco provided legal advice to biosimilar pharmaceutical company Alvotech Â in the listing on the Nasdaq main market in Iceland, after a successful listing on the Nasdaq First North Growth market earlier in the year, which was the first US/Icelandic dual listing of any Icelandic company in history and for a long while Alvotech was the only Icelandic company to be listed in the US. Alvotech has the highest market cap of all companies listed on the Nasdaq main market in Iceland or approximately USD 3,250,000,000. This was a complex multi-jurisdictional transaction, involving Iceland and Luxembourg as Alvotech is incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\n\nBBA//Fjeldco acted for Holding Cage AS in relation to the sale of Norwegian fishing equipment manufacturer Morenot AS to Hampidjan.

(an SPV investment vehicle) and minority shareholders of Jardboranir hf., which included management as well as current and former employees, in all matters of the sale of the company to Norwegian Archer drilling company and Icelandic investment company Kaldbakur.
