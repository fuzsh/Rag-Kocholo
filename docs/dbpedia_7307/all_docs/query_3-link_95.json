        "text": "Crime\n\nFormer CEO of failed Landsbankinn and three deputies sentenced to prison for market manipulation\n\nBy Staff\n\nFive years in prison Yesterday's 1.5 year sentence brings the total prison term of Sigurjón Arnason, the former CEO of failed bank Landsbankinn, to five years. Photo/Vilhelm Gunnarsson.\n\nYesterday the Supreme Court of Iceland found Sigurjón Árnason, the CEO of failed bank Landsbankinn, one of the three big Icelandic banks which failed in 2008, along with three of his deputies, guilty of systematic and extensive market manipulation. The court sentenced Sigurjón to 1.5 years in prison. This sentence comes in addition to an earlier sentence of 3.5 years he had received for market manipulation in a separate ruling in the same case. This brings Sigurjón’s prison term to a combined five years.\n\nRead more: More bankers behind bars: Three Landsbankinn bosses sentenced to prison\n\nGuilty of systematic and extensive market manipulation\n\nThe court found in its ruling that the four had engaged in systematic manipulation of the market for Landsbankinn shares in the lead up to the financial crash of 2008, specifically during the last week prior to the collapse of the bank. The court found that the large scale purchase of Landsbankinn shares, which were executed by Ívar Guðjónsson the head of proprietary trading and the traders, Júlíus Steinar Heiðarsson and Sindri Sveinsson, created a false impression of the price and demand for Landsbankinn shares, inflating their price. Sigurjón, the court argued, was intimately involved in the trades, which could not have been carried out without his knowledge and direction.\n\nHarsher sentences and a reversal of a previous acquittal\n\nWith its ruling the Supreme Court extended the sentences the four had received by the Reykjavík District Court. Sigurjón’s sentence was extended by six months, to 1.5 years in prison. Ívar’s sentence was increased by 15 months, from nine months in prison to two years. Júlíus was sentenced to one year in prison and Sindri to nine months.\n\nRead more: 26 bankers already sentenced to a combined 74 years in prison\n\nThe District Court of Reykjavík had previously sentenced Júlíus to nine months but acquitted Sindri. This ruling therefore continues the pattern the Supreme Court seems to have established in cases relating to the 2008 financial collapse, which is to extend sentences handed down by the District Court of Reykjavík and overturn acquittals.\n\nClaimed market manipulation was really \"informal market-making\"\n\nThe defendants claimed that their actions should be considered as “informal market-making” and were, as such legal and recognized as a routine and normal type of transaction in banking.\n\nThe court rejected this defence as absurd, pointing out that market making operations require a formal contract between the financial institution and corporation whose shares a market was being made for, that this contract be public and that the corporation whose shares a market is being made for has no way of influencing the market price. Market making is only intended to insure liquidity, not maintain a certain price or give an impression of an inflated level of demand. Moreover, the law expressly bans financial institutions from engaging in market making for their own shares.\n\nEconomy\n\nTwo radically different visions emerge of the future of the Icelandic banking system\n\nBy Staff\n\nBreadcrumbs or the greater good Two radically different visions of what to do with the government's stakes in the three big Icelandic banks have emerged as Icelanders debate what kind of banking system to create as capital controls are lifted and the economy recovers. Photo/Valgarður Gíslason.\n\nTwo radically different visions of what to do with the state owned Landsbankinn were advanced during the weekend at the national conferences of the conservative Independence party and the Left-Green alliance. The bank, which was founded around the domestic assets and liabilities of the bankrupt Landsbankinn which collapsed in October 2008, is almost wholly owned by the state.\n\nThe question of what to do with the states stake in Landsbankinn, Íslandsbanki and Arion has is quickly becoming one of the most hotly debated political questions of the day in Iceland.\n\nA social bank rather than breadcrumbs\n\nThe National congress of the Left-Green alliance called for Landsbankinn to be turned into a non-profit “social bank”, which would be operated in the interest of society as a whole, rather than shareholders. Katrín Jakobsdóttir, who was re-elected as the chairman of the Left-Green Alliance told the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service RÚV that the question was whether society would enjoy the entire benefits created by the bank, “or just the breadcrumbs, falling off the table.”\n\nA consensus around privatization\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman of the conservative Independence party outlined a plan to privatize the banks. Bjarni Benediktsson, who was also re-elected as party chairman at his party’s national congress, proposed that the state distribute 5% of the shares in all three banks among all citizens. RÚV estimates that this would transfer assets worth 29.65 billion ISK (230 million USD/210 million EUR) from the state to the citizens, meaning every Icelander would receive shares worth 90,000 ISK (700 USD/640 EUR).\n\nBjarni argued that this plan was “not intended to dramatically improve the economy” of Icelandic homes, but to “create a broader consensus around changes in the ownership structure and ensure the goal of broad-based ownership.”\n\nNew banks, created on the ruins of the old banks\n\nThe three banks were created when the domestic assets and liabilities of the collapsed Landsbankinn, Glitnir and Kaupþing were moved out of the bankrupt estates into new banks.\n\nThe state owns almost all of the shares in Landsbankinn, while the estates of the collapsed Glitnir and Kaupþing own the majority of shares in Íslandsbanki and Arion, respectively. Recently the estate of Glitnir offered to hand over 95% of the shares in Íslandsbanki as payment of the stability tax required before they can repatriate funds locked in due to the capital controls instituted in 2008. If the state agrees to this transaction it would own two of the big banks in Iceland, and a large stake in the third.\n\nRead more: A 40% exit tax to be imposed on foreign investors\n\nWhile the privatization of important government assets would under any circumstances be hotly debated, the question is made all the more contentious by the fact that many have argued the roots of the financial crisis of 2008 can be traced to the privatization of the state-owned banks in 1998-2002.\n\nCrime\n\n26 bankers already sentenced to a combined 74 years in prison\n\nBy Staff\n\nThe Kaupþing four Former Chairman, Sigurður Einarsson, former CEO Hreiðar Már Sigurðsson, former CEO of Kaupþing Luxembourg Magnús Guðmundsson and Corporate Viking Ólafur Ólafsson, sentenced this February for market manipulation. Photo/Vísir.is\n\nIn two separate rulings last week, the Supreme Court of Iceland and the Reykjavík District Court sentenced three top managers of Landsbankinn and two top managers of Kaupþing, along with one prominent investor, to prison for crimes committed in the lead-up to the financial collapse of 2008. With these rulings the number of bankers and financiers who have been sentenced to prison for crimes relating to the financial collapse has reached 26, and a combined prison time of 74 years.\n\nRead more: Bankers Behind Bars: A guided walking tour through the collapse of Iceland's banking system in 2008\n\nFormer managers of Kaupþing top the list\n\nEleven former bankers have been sentenced to four and a half years or more in prison. The former top bosses of Kaupþing have received the longest sentences to date. Hreiðar Már Sigurðsson, the former CEO of failed bank Kaupþing and Magnús Guðmundsson, the CEO of Kaupþing Luxembourg, top the list, having been sentenced to a combined six years in prison for extensive market manipulation, embezzlement and breach of fiduciary duties. The maximum combined sentence for financial crimes according to Icelandic law is six years.\n\nCourts can sentence people to longer prison terms than six years in cases where the crimes are systematic and repeated, and in cases where people make a living from engaging in financial crimes. Future cases against Magnús and Hreiðar Már will determine if the courts consider the two to have engaged in financial criminality of a scale which justifies expanding on the maximum sentences.\n\nMarket manipulation and embezzlement involving bankers and corporate Vikings\n\nIn addition to Hreiðar Már and Magnús eight other individuals with connections to Kaupþing have been sentenced to prison. Sigurður Einarsson, the Chairman of Kaupþing has been sentenced to a combined prison term of five years in two cases involving market manipulation in the lead up to the 2008 crisis, while the Reykjavík District court sentenced Ingólfur Helgason the CEO of Kaupþing’s domestic division to four and a half years and Bjarki Diego, managing director of the bank’s loan division to two years, both for market manipulation. Three others received suspended sentences.\n\nTwo financiers with ties to KAupþing have also been sentenced. Ólafur Ólafsson, one of the most powerful “corporate Vikings” of the pre-2008 years and one of the largest shareholders in Kaupþing was sentenced to four and a half years for market manipulation by the Supreme Court while Skúli Þorvaldsson, a prominent investor was sentenced to six months in prison by the District Court for cover-up in a case involving the embezzlement of bank funds by the CEOs of Kaupþing and Kaupþing Luxembourg, Hreiðar Már and Magnús.\n\nFormer Landsbankinn bosses guilty of market manipulation\n\nThe Special Prosecutor for financial crimes has also charged former employees and top managers of the two other big Icelandic banks, Landsbankinn and Glitnir, for various crimes, including market manipulation.\n\nLast week the Supreme Court of Iceland found Sigurjón Þ. Árnason, the former CEO of Landsbankinn guilty of market manipulation, sentencing him to three and a half years in prison, as well as Elín Sigfúsdóttir, the former director of corporate lending, was sentenced to one and a half years and Steinþór Gunnarsson, head of brokerage to nine months. In a second market manipulation case against Landsbankinn bosses, which is headed to the Supreme Court, Sigurjón, Ívar Guðjónsson the head of proprietary trading along with a brokerJúlíus Steinar Heiðarsson, were all sentenced to three months in prison by the District court.\n\nCEO of Glitnir, the smallest bank acquitted\n\nLárus Welding, the former CEO of Glitnir has been acquitted by the Supreme Court in one case involving breach of fiduciary duty and fraudulent loans, while another case awaits retrial by the District Court. Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson, one of the most illustrious corporate vikings and the largest shareholder in Glitnir, is also awaiting retrial for fraudulent loans in the same case, along with several top Glitnir bosses.\n\nFour former employees of Glitnir have been sentenced by the District Court to five years in prison for market manipulation and breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nSeveral others have been sentenced or await trial\n\nIn addition to the bosses of the three largest banks several other financiers and bankers have been sentenced by the Supreme Court or the Reykjavík District Court for crimes in the lead up to the 2008 financial crisis. The most prominent of these was Baldur Guðlaugsson, the former permanent secretary of Ministry of Finance, who was sentenced to two years in prison for insider trading in 2012.\n\nSupreme Court vs the Reykjavík District Court\n\nTo date the Supreme Court has ruled in eight cases. The court has handed down guilty verdicts in six of these cases, acquitted the defendants in one and referred one case back to the District Court of Reykjavík. Several cases are now making their way from the District Court to the Supreme Court. Judging by the previous rulings of the Supreme Court most observers believe the court will either uphold guilty verdicts and hand down more severe sentences or overturn acquittals.\n\nSentences handed down by the Supreme Court:\n\nFebruary 2012\n\nBaldur Guðlaugsson, former Permanent Secretary of the Ministery of Finance: two and a half years for insider trading.\n\nJune 2012\n\nRagnar Z.

Photo/Vilhelm Gunnarsson.\n\nA French investigative judge has charged Björgólfur Guðmundsson, the largest shareholder of bankrupt Landsbankinn along with eight top managers of the Luxemoburg branch of Landsbankinn for having misled customers and mismanaging their investments. The scale of the case makes it one of the largest fraud cases in France.\n\nQuestionable equity release loans\n\nThe Icelandic National Broadcasting Service reports that a French investigative judge, Renaud van Ruymbeke, filed charges yesterday against Björgólfur Guðmundsson and the top brass of the Luxembourg branch of Landsbankinn in a case involving equity release loans offered by the subsidiary.\n\nRelated: Bankers Behind Bars: A guided walking tour through the collapse of Iceland's banking system in 2008\n\nThe loans were offered to French and Spanish customers, mainly retired clients who owned valuable real estate. The loans allowed the customers to mortgage their properties, accessing their equity. Typically a fourth of the loan was paid out in cash, while the rest was invested with the promise that the returns on this investment would pay for the servicing of the loan.\n\n“Risk free” investments, mismanagement and deception\n\nBjörgólfur, who sat on the board of Landsbankinn, and the Landsbankinn managers are charged for having promised its customers a “risk free” transaction, which is illegal under French law. They accused of having misled the customers about the nature of the investments, as the bank invested in different securities than it promised its customers, buying large amounts of bonds issued by Landsbankinn and Kaupþing, another Icelandic bank which went bankrupt in October 2008. They are also accused of having mismanaged the investments and ignored complaints from customers. The crimes allegedly took place in 2006-2008.\n\nThe charges follow a five month investigation. According to Sigrún Davíðsdóttir, the London correspondent of the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service, the investigation was only opened after a group of diligence of a group of French borrowers. The borrowers had attempted to bring the case to the Luxembourg authorities, which refused to investigate it explicitly siding with Landsbankinn. Sigrún argues the scale of the case makes it one of the largest fraud cases in France.\n\nFormer tycoon, father of only Icelander to get on Forbes list of 500 richest people on earth\n\nBjörgólfur, who declared personal bankruptcy in 2009, is the father of Icelandic tycoon, Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson. The father and son team were the largest shareholders in Landsbankinn, one of the three large Icelandic banks which went bankrupt in October 2008. In 2007 Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson was the 249th richest man in the world, according to Forbes. Björgólfur Thor is currently the 1,415 richest man in the world according to Forbes. Björgólfur Thor is not connected or named in the fraud case against his father, nor is his investment fund Novator."
