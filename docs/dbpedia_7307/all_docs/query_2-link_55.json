Still, Iceland can leverage its unique assets to overcome challenges of adapting to climate change. One asset is Iceland’s abundant domestically produced renewable energies that cover nearly all the country’s heat and electricity production needs.

        "text": "Responsibilities, Powers, and Functions of Supervisors\n\nPrinciple 17. Supervisors should ensure that they have adequate resources and capacity to effectively assess banks’ management of climate-related financial risks.\n\n61. The Central Bank of Iceland has an adequate mandate to oversee and supervise climate-related financial risks in the banking sector. According to Act No. 161/2002 on Financial Undertakings, Act No. 87/1998 on Official Supervision of Financial Activities, and other relevant laws32, the CBI has adequate legal power to supervise regulated banks in all risk domains. Assessment of governance and risk management is part of the scope of banking supervision, and climate-related financial risks are included in the range of various risk domains that are being assessed, because of the transversal nature of such risks that may impact other domains (credit risks and liquidity risks, for instance). Though climate-related financial risks have not been explicitly added to legal provisions on risk management of other risk domains developed in Act No. 161/2002, it is clear that the CBI shall oversee and supervise the banking sector accordingly. The authorities plan to incorporate EBA standards and guidelines for climate-related financial risks into Icelandic law after their final version has been issued, expected in 2023 or 2024, as usually done for EU regulations and EBA norms.\n\n62. The Central Bank of Iceland’s strategic planning for implementing banking supervision of climate-related financial risks is barely structured. The CBI is gradually starting to work on the plan, using a pragmatic and informal approach that may be adapted to the moving regulatory environment in this domain. Preliminary work has started mostly at the technical level, with a few supervisors and experts acting on their own initiative with support from their directors. The CBI has not yet designed a formal strategic action plan for managing the implementation of the supervisory framework of climate-related financial risks, covering the comprehensive scope of internal and external issues. Therefore, the Financial Supervision Committee, nor the Financial Stability Committee, have not endorsed any plan. Advancing from the current light-touch approach to implementation toward a more structured strategic plan and reform management process would help address global implementation issues in the medium term and reach preconditions for effective and adequate supervision in a proportionate manner as soon as possible (for instance, tailoring data reporting requirements, ensuring reliable data production, coordinating with public agencies for relevant data collection).\n\n63. The Central Bank of Iceland’s organizational framework is gradually being adapted to the emerging workload, resulting from the central bank’s mission, under development, on oversight and supervision of climate-related financial risks. The CBI is promoting a transversal approach to supervision of the financial sector as a whole, as can be seen with the new organization chart decided in January 2023. The CBI created the Prudential Supervision Department and the Conduct Supervision Department, both of which handle microprudential supervision tasks, while the Financial Stability Department manages macroprudential surveillance and stress testing. Oversight and supervision of climate-related financial risks are handled within these three Departments. Interdepartmental cooperation within the CBI remains informal: there was no dedicated internal committee, specific unit, or single point of expertise in place during the mission, but a new climate expert was appointed at the Governor’s Office by late March 2023, which may introduce some structuration of the oversight of climate issues within the CBI.\n\n64. The Central Bank of Iceland has not estimated its anticipated need for additional supervisory resources and capacity for banking supervision of climate-related financial risks. By mid-March 2023, there were only two CBI specialists with relevant expertise in climate-related financial risks. As already mentioned, a new employee with climate-related expertise but no supervisory experience was hired during the mission. According to the CBI, a sustainable officer would also be hired in the Conduct Supervision Department. The CBI should develop greater internal expertise to be shared among a larger number of supervisors. Training and other actions to increase the awareness of CBI’s supervisors have not yet been organized. Additional staffing needs and expertise among financial supervisors for the next three to five years have not yet been precisely determined. These needs should be defined with consideration of the potential increase in supervisory work that may globally result from effective oversight and supervision of climate-related financial risks. The CBI should also estimate multiyear budget needs in this domain to secure adequate funding to develop staff, expertise, tools, as well as proactive outreach communications.\n\n65. Though the Central Bank of Iceland has started working on climate-related financial risks, development of supervisory processes is only preliminary. The CBI has started to engage with banks, notably during (1) the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), implemented in 2022 for the three larger banks; and (2) the first climate scenario analysis, in 2022–23. Oversight of climate-related financial risks has been incorporated into the scope of work for the Financial Stability Department and the two departments in charge of financial supervision (Prudential Supervision and Conduct Supervision). A first scenario analysis has been performed by the Financial Stability Department, with the outcome being an article published in the March 2023 Financial Stability Report (see footnote No 21). First steps of implementation of EBA standards and guidelines have been performed by the Prudential Supervision Department, mostly through the SREP work in 2022 during meetings with larger banks on various components of the risk assessment, notably governance and risk management. The FSAP mission has not reviewed confidential supervisory materials pertaining to the 2022 SREP. Internal supervisory procedures and processes will need to be adjusted once the regulatory framework has been stabilized and enforced. In the meantime, the CBI has some latitude to engage more deeply and broadly with various relevant stakeholders, including other authorities, to build a comprehensive and structured framework of regulation and supervision of climate-related financial risks. The framework would support governmental policies on climate change, as well as banks’ efforts toward sustainable finance. Besides, collection of additional information and data from banks to develop analytical and supervisory work has also barely started.\n\nPrinciple 16. In conducting supervisory assessments of banks’ management of climate-related financial risks, supervisors should utilize an appropriate range of techniques and tools and adopt adequate follow-up measures in case of material misalignment with supervisory expectations.\n\n66. Supervisory expectations on management of climate-related financial risks have yet to be set, tailored to Iceland, and disclosed to banks. By March 2023, the CBI had not yet disclosed supervisory expectations for effective, adequate, and proportionate implementation of standards for risk management and disclosure of climate-related financial risks, tailored to the Icelandic banking sector at the national level. Such disclosure is likely premature at the preliminary stage of the reform while the regulatory setup is not yet stabilized: (1) EU regulations on ESG disclosure have been issued and will become applicable in coming years; and (2) the EBA’s issuance of standards and guidelines is ongoing, but they are not yet fully enforceable within the EU nor in Iceland. Banks are aware of publications and public drafts pertaining to the European regulatory framework. Yet, institutional communication by the CBI on the supervisory expectations and preparatory steps for smooth implementation has not started (for instance, no publication has been produced, and no outreach communication event has been held to raise the banking sector’s awareness of climate-related financial risks).\n\n67. Supervisory tools and techniques on climate-related financial risks are under development. The CBI is at the preliminary stage of creating supervisory procedures and processes, as well as designing IT tools, techniques, databases, and assessment methodology for oversight and supervision of climate-related financial risks within the banking sector. Progress is acknowledged as necessary but not planned in a systematic way. For instance, NGFS climate scenarios have been partially used (as the CBI indicated in the FSR) for a first impact assessment, and SREP meetings with banks have included climate change on their agendas. Further identification and design of supervisory tasks is needed, and a dedicated action plan to incorporate climate-related work, including priority ranking, into supervisory processes would be useful.\n\nPrinciple 18. Supervisors should consider using climate-related risk scenario analysis to identify relevant risk factors, size portfolio exposures, identify data gaps and inform the adequacy of risk management approaches. Supervisors may also consider the use of climate-related stress testing to evaluate a firm’s financial position under severe but plausible scenarios. Where appropriate, supervisors should consider disclosing the findings of these exercises.\n\n68. The Central Bank of Iceland has implemented the first climate scenario analysis, whose outcome was disclosed in the March 2023 CBI Financial Stability Report. During the FSAP mission, the CBI published an informative article on its climate scenario analysis in the FSR33, which focuses on a top-down analysis of climate-related financial risks (especially transition risks) on banks’ credit portfolios—an analysis focused on corporate loans. The CBI mostly used available data from the Credit Registry, not data directly collected from banks. The CBI plans to expand this exercise to other types of risks in the next few years, and also to conduct a bottom-up exercise in cooperation with banks. As indicated in the FSR: (1) the ESRB/ECB scenario analysis published in July 2022 was used as a role model; and (2) NGFS scenarios provide downscaled information in individual jurisdictions, including economic variables provided by the NiGEM macroeconomic model. The latter does not yet apply to Iceland, but the Department of Economic Affairs is currently working on implementing the NiGEM model. Therefore, the CBI considers that in the meantime specific Icelandic results are needed to perform scenario analysis with economic variables. The central bank plans to explore available data, like the internal economic model (QMM), and perhaps buy rights to access additional data sources in order to implement NGFS scenarios fully.\n\n69. The Central Bank of Iceland plans to leverage its recent climate scenario analysis to develop solvency and liquidity stress testing further and to better define supervisory objectives. Climate-related stress testing is not yet used to assess the adequacy of banks’ solvency and liquidity buffers covering climate-related financial risks. Currently, the CBI’s climate stress tests and standard stress tests that focus on the resilience of the banking sector are separate exercises, as for the EBA. Given that the EBA is considering taking ESG risks, including climate-related financial risks, in its next review of SREP guidelines, such risks have not been included in the Basel Pillar 2 requirement process in Iceland yet. In addition, the CBI intends by end-2023 to enforce a new law on the disclosure of sustainability and taxonomy for sustainable finance (planned to be adopted by the Parliament in mid-2023).\n\n70. Supervisory scenario analysis is too preliminary to identify data gaps, and size portfolio exposure. The CBI needs to dedicate more work to bridge data gaps and enhance the identification, measurement, and assessment of banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks. The central bank should prioritize the work on bridging data gaps internally and in collaboration with banks, and public agencies that may also collect useful data (for instance, Statistics Iceland). The CBI has not yet taken such initiative.\n\nPrudential Regulatory and Supervisory Requirements for Banks\n\nPrinciple 13. Supervisors should determine that banks’ incorporation of material climate-related financial risks into their business strategies, corporate governance, and internal control frameworks is sound and comprehensive.\n\n71. Supervisory assessment of banks’ corporate governance frameworks on climate-related financial risks has started through the supervisory review and evaluation process and is awaiting more specific guidance and thorough analysis. The CBI indicated that a first round of discussions including governance of ESG risks and climate-related issues took place during the 2022 SREP exercise of larger banks. Apart from that, the CBI has not yet reviewed nor thoroughly assessed whether banks have fully integrated climate-related risk drivers in their business strategies, corporate governance, and internal control frameworks. For instance, the roles and responsibilities of banks’ boards of directors and senior management, as well as internal reporting on climate-related financial risks, remain to be assessed. The CBI has only some high-level insights that deserve a more granular assessment. Banks’ 2022 Pillar 3 reports indicate that all larger banks have set up sustainability committees and included ESG risks in their governance frameworks and business strategies, but such high-level public information should be assessed more thoroughly.\n\nPrinciple 14. Supervisors should determine that banks can adequately identify, monitor, and manage all material climate-related financial risks as part of their assessments of banks’ risk appetite and risk management frameworks.\n\n72. Supervisory assessment of banks’ risk management strategies and objectives for climate-related financial risks has not yet been systematic. The CBI has not yet reviewed the extent to which banks regularly assess the materiality of climate-related financial risks, supported by appropriate KRIs and, where applicable, risk mitigating measures. The CBI needs to assess to what extent banks have incorporated climate-related financial risks into their risk strategy, risk appetite (including risk exposure limits), and risk management frameworks. In their 2022 Pillar 3 reports, larger banks mentioned that they have defined policies and strategies on ESG risks, but with varying levels of details disclosed among banks. Adequacy and implementation of banks’ risk management strategies and objectives have not yet been formally examined. Such supervisory assessment would be useful in the long term to ensure that banks have developed effective risk management strategies on climate-related financial risks that are more specifically focused than ESG risks and have concretely embedded these strategies throughout their risk management processes. It is important that ESG is not just mentioned in banks’ financial disclosure, whose purpose is mainly external communications.\n\nPrinciple 15. Supervisors should determine the extent to which banks regularly identify and assess the impact of climate-related risk drivers on their risk profile and ensure that material climate-related financial risks are adequately considered in their management of credit, market, liquidity, operational, and other types of risk. Supervisors should determine that, where appropriate, banks apply climate scenario analysis.\n\n73. Supervisory assessment has not yet covered the inclusion of climate-related risk drivers in banks’ risk assessment and risk management policies. The CBI indicated that it has not structured a supervisory process nor engaged in supervisory action to ensure that banks (1) consider a range of mitigation options to manage and control material climate-related risks; and (2) consider climate-related financial risks assessed as material over relevant horizons within their internal capital and liquidity adequacy assessment processes (ICAAP and ILAAP). Even so, some specific requirements are in place, such as EBA guidelines for loan origination and monitoring (Article 208), which require that banks consider ESG factors when valuing immovable property collateral. However, this covers a limited scope of global risk management processes.\n\n74. The CBI plans to conduct supervisory assessments of banks’ scenario analysis policies and processes after EBA guidelines on institutions’ stress testing have been reviewed, tentatively by 2023, and implemented within the Icelandic legislation. So far, the central bank has not determined whether banks effectively implement adapted scenario analysis to assess the resilience of their business models and strategies to a range of plausible climate-related outcomes. Due to time constraints, the CBI did not leverage banks’ experience of scenario analysis to inform its first supervisory scenario analysis, published in March 2023. More thorough dialogue, guidance, and information sharing would be useful.\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nPrinciple 1. Banks should develop and implement a sound process for understanding and assessing the potential impacts of climate-related risk drivers on their businesses and on the environments in which they operate. Banks should consider material climate-related financial risks that could materialize over various time horizons and incorporate these risks into their overall business strategies and risk management frameworks.\n\n75. The Central Bank of Iceland has implemented EU regulations and EBA guidelines on corporate governance, which include requirements for ESG. The CBI refers to EBA guidelines EBA/GL/2021/05 on internal governance requiring banks’ boards of directors to take into account ESG risks (including material physical and transition risk drivers of climate-related financial risks) when developing and implementing their business strategies. Regarding the consideration of climate-related financial risks in banks’ compensation policies, the EBA published a guideline stating that remuneration policies should be in line with ESG strategies. Existing legal requirements state that banks’ remuneration policies should be in line with their overall strategies, objectives, values, risk appetites, and long-term interests. When reviewing and discussing remuneration policies with larger banks during the 2022 SREP, the CBI noted that climate-related factors should be more visible in remuneration policies and frameworks, but no formal supervisory action was decided.\n\n76. Icelandic banks have disclosed at some point information on their corporate governance of ESG, including climate-related financial risks. Financial disclosure of 2022 annual accounts by the three larger banks34 reveals that Icelandic banks are aware of requirements for ESG-related objectives, risk management, and disclosure, though banks seem to make uneven progress. Even if banks’ effective commitment to consider climate-related financial risks is specifically emphasized in their financial disclosure, there may be room for further enhancement. Banks’ ESG frameworks have been evaluated by Reitun, a national rating agency specialized in ESG rating, and they received good ratings35. This is a commendable initiative that can support work on improving green strategies and developing sustainable finance. Yet not all evaluations by Reitun took place after the latest international standards and the release of EU/EBA guidelines on ESG and climate-related financial risks. Moreover, Reitun’s methodology refers mostly to more global guidance on ESG issued by the United Nations, and Nasdaq, among other sources, which are less focused than BCBS principles on climate-related financial risks applicable to banks. In addition, the CBI indicated that Reitun is not a regulated external rating agency, and that the relevancy and adequacy of Reitun’s assessment methodology has not been evaluated from a risk-based and prudential viewpoint of banking regulation and supervision.\n\n77. Supervisory assessment of the impact of climate-related financial risks on Icelandic banks’ business models is a work in progress. The CBI during the 2022 SREP assessed the three larger banks’ business plans, which were designed before the finalization of the 2021 EBA guidelines on governance and the 2022 BCBS principles on climate-related financial risks. Consequently, one bank was advised to start integrating ESG more effectively into its strategy setting and business planning; additional action is needed. The CBI will further emphasize ESG risks globally in the supervisory dialogue with banks and plans to start deeper discussions in 2023. So far, it is premature to evaluate how physical and transition risks would impact the resilience of banks’ business models. The CBI mentioned that several banks have included environmental risk factors in their stress test scenarios for ICAAP/ILAAP, which build on their business plans, and in their recovery plan scenario analysis. However, such practices are neither systematic nor thorough. Some qualitative risk assessment is being put forward in banks’ business plans and is discussed during the SREP.\n\nPrinciple 2. The board and senior management should clearly assign climate-related responsibilities to members and/or committees and exercise effective oversight of climate-related financial risks. Further, the board and senior management should identify responsibilities for climate-related risk management throughout the organizational structure.\n\n78. Banks’ boards of directors are increasingly considering climate-related financial risks within their scope of duties, as the supervisory review process has established. The CBI applies EBA guidelines EBA/GL/2021/06 on assessment of suitability of members of banks’ management bodies and key function holders, requiring that banks’ boards of directors and senior management effectively oversee and manage all risk domains, including ESG. Annual self-assessments of banks’ boards made during the 2022 SREP reflected increased focus on ESG. Regarding climate-related financial risks specifically, more concrete illustration of the involvement of banks’ boards and senior management would be useful in order to demonstrate that banks’ ESG and sustainability policies are also effectively focused on (1) climate-related financial risks; and (2) risk management of these risks.\n\n79. Financial disclosure of larger banks in 2022 clearly brings out a range of commendable initiatives to proactively implement sustainable finance strategies. The following list is not comprehensive, but illustrates concrete actions undertaken by banks (see Appendix IV for reference materials): setting up a sustainability committee; adopting an environmental and climate policy; developing green finance products; deciding sustainability objectives for 2023 to reach GHG and net-zero strategic objectives; reporting on financed GHG emissions; disclosing the bank’s GHG emissions’ footprint and the ratio of carbon-related assets in the total loan book using the TCFD definition; participating in domestic and international cooperation initiatives; and carrying out an ESG risk assessment for corporate customers.\n\n80. Banks are developing their resources and capacities to upgrade their risk management frameworks on climate-related financial risks. Larger banks have adopted a sustainability policy approved by the board and set up a sustainability committee. They have also created dedicated units and hired staff with expertise in ESG and sustainability. The adequacy of banks’ human resources and expertise has not been assessed by the CBI, which is planning to do so during the 2023 SREP on larger banks. Yet the FSAP team met with banks’ representatives during the main mission, and discussions revealed that banks clearly take climate-related financial risks seriously, which may be seen as a strategic opportunity for the CBI to intensify the supervisory dialogue in order to further develop the capacities of both the banking sector and the supervisory authority.\n\nPrinciple 3. Banks should adopt appropriate policies, procedures, and controls that are implemented across the entire organization to ensure effective management of climate-related financial risks.\n\n81. Effective adoption and implementation of appropriate policies and procedures on management of climate-related financial risks through operational processes needs to be assessed. No information is available that would illustrate how larger banks have appropriately incorporated climate-related financial risks into their concrete operational processes, for instance, credit risk management. The CBI has not yet performed in-depth assessment through offsite supervision or on-site inspections.\n\nComprehensive Management of Market, Liquidity, Operational, and Other Risks\n\nPrinciple 9. Banks should understand the impact of climate-related risk drivers on their market risk positions and ensure that market risk management systems and processes consider material climate-related financial risks.\n\n93. Specific supervisory requirements or guidance on climate-related market risk are not yet applicable. The CBI has not set any specific requirements regarding climate-related market risk management, but the EBA is developing ESG risk management guidelines, which are expected to address this issue. Therefore, banks are not explicitly required to (1) identify and understand how climate-related risk drivers could affect the value of the financial instruments in their portfolio; (2) evaluate the potential risk of losses on and increased volatility of their portfolio; and (3) establish effective processes to control or mitigate the associated impacts.\n\n94. Banks’ adjustment of their market risk management processes considering climate-related drivers and risks have not yet been assessed. Given the lack of information and pending implementation of regulation and supervision of climate-related market risk, it is premature to identify, measure, and assess banks’ exposure to market risk resulting from climate-related financial risks. Even so, they might not be material, considering that global exposure of Icelandic banks to market risk is limited. To the CBI’s knowledge, banks have not yet considered how the pricing and availability of hedges can change, given different climate and transition pathways, but the simplicity of banks’ hedging strategies might be a mitigating factor at some point.\n\nPrinciple 10. Banks should understand the impact of climate-related risk drivers on their liquidity risk profiles and ensure that liquidity risk management systems and processes consider material climate-related financial risks.\n\n95. Specific supervisory requirements or guidance on climate-related liquidity and funding risks are not yet applicable. The CBI has not set any specific requirements regarding climate-related liquidity risk management, but the EBA is developing ESG risk management guidelines, which are expected to address this issue. Therefore, banks are not explicitly required to assess the impact of climate-related financial risks on net cash outflows (for instance, increased drawdowns of credit lines, accelerated deposit withdrawals or reallocation), nor the value of assets comprising their liquidity buffers (high-quality liquid assets—HQLA).\n\n96. Banks’ adjustment of their liquidity risk and funding risk management processes considering climate-related drivers and risks have not yet been assessed. Given the lack of information and pending implementation of regulation and supervision of climate-related liquidity risk, it is premature to identify, measure, and assess banks’ exposure to (short-term) liquidity risk and to (longer-term) funding risk resulting from climate-related financial risks. The issuance of green bonds by banks is at an early stage. Besides, the pricing effect of the development of green finance products on profitability may be an attention point to monitor, as well as the overall impact of climate-related financial risks on banks’ profitability drivers and structure.\n\nPrinciple 11. Banks should understand the impact of climate-related risk drivers on their operational risk and ensure that risk management systems and processes consider material climate-related risks. Banks should also understand the impact of climate-related risk drivers on other risks and put in place adequate measures to account for these risks, where material. This includes climate-related risk drivers that might lead to increasing strategic, reputational, and regulatory compliance risk, as well as liability costs associated with climate-sensitive investments and businesses.\n\n97. Specific supervisory requirements or guidance on climate-related operational risk are not yet applicable. Icelandic banks are subject to existing prudential requirements on operational risk management, which are stated in Act No. 161/2002, notably on business continuity planning. In that sense, climate-risk drivers should already be identified and included in business continuity plans, as physical risks may directly or indirectly impact business continuity. Yet no specific requirement has been issued on consideration to be given to climate-related financial risks within the operational risk management framework and processes. During the FSAP mission, no information was available on other aspects of risk management pertaining to operational risk, especially compliance risk, legal risk, and liability costs that may result from climate-related financial risks, not to mention reputational risk and strategic risk, which are not part of operational risk.\n\n98. Banks have developed business continuity plans that consider threats resulting from climate change-related events, yet the impact of climate-related risk drivers on banks’ operations remains to be clarified. Icelandic banks as well as the CBI pay serious attention to business continuity planning. In addition, the financial sector is used to address issues resulting from natural hazards, which are inherent to Iceland, and the Natural Catastrophe Fund plays a key mitigating role. Though natural hazards do not always result from climate change, incorporating climate-related physical risks into regular operational risk management should not be a major issue for Icelandic banks. Banking supervision should further assess whether climate-related financial risks may have any additional specific potential impact in that regard."
