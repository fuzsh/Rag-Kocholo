Digital distribution[ | ]

Big Fish Games distributes casual downloadable games for over 500 developers. Big Fish Games has over 1,500,000 downloads per day on peak days.[3] The service offers downloadable casual games with a try-before-you-buy model where consumers can play a selection of over 3000 games for free for 60 minutes, then have the option to purchase that game to keep playing.

Online games[ | ]

Big Fish Games used to distribute online web browser games that were free to play and advertising supported. There were over 80 games to play. The games all included chat and players earned tokens that could be used to enter lotteries to win cash prizes and free games. Some of the games (just over 20) that used to be free to play on that site were on a sister site called Big Sea Games that was free to play with no advertising. After many problems it was announced that the sister site would be closed on 1 September 2010 after just over a year. [1]
