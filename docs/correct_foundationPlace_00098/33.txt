Seattle-based casual games publisher Big Fish Games is looking to jump into the cloud gaming space with a new service that allows users to stream games directly to their television, mobile device, or PC. The new service, dubbed Big Fish Unlimited, went live Tuesday morning, and promises instant access to 100 games from Big Fish's catalog. In the months ahead, the company said it wants to offer at least 1,000 streaming titles. With this new service, Big Fish hopes to get a slice of the market currently dominated by cloud streaming companies like OnLive or the Sony-owned Gaikai, which give users one-click access to games across a wide range of devices. By getting into cloud gaming, Big Fish hopes to move away from cumbersome game downloads, thereby lowering the barrier to entry for more complex titles and providing games that can exist across multiple platforms. In addition, the company announced that it's partnered with media streaming company Roku, and Big Fish plans to bring its new cloud streaming service to Roku boxes in the fourth quarter of this year. At the moment, users can get full access to the Big Fish Unlimited catalog for a subscription of $7.99 per month. Non-paying users, meanwhile, have access to a rotating catalog of 20 ad-supported games. For more information on Big Fish Unlimited, check out Big Fish's official website.
