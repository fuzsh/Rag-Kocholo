SEATTLE, July 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Big Fish Games, Inc., an innovative developer and world-class publisher of a diverse portfolio of casual game franchises, today completed its move of the company's 630+ Seattle-based people into the iconic Seattle waterfront Maritime Building. The Maritime Building was built in 1910 and was chosen by Big Fish as a celebration of its Seattle roots. Located at the corner of Alaskan Way and Madison Avenue, Big Fish's new location provides easy access to city transit, ferries, and amenities for the company's growing team of engineers, game designers, artists, business intelligence analysts, product marketers and more.

News Facts:

Big Fish is a leading developer of top-charting casual games and is known for its emphasis on putting its people first. This is exemplified by this new location's access to many transit options and walkable amenities.

With this move, the Big Fish team has reduced its overall commute to and from Big Fish's headquarters, doing its part to ease Seattle's traffic congestion and better the city's environment:

Most Big Fish employees can now take one bus direct to and from work, which is a significant improvement on the previous average of 2.7 bus trips per person.

Only 27% of employees will choose to drive to the new office â€“ down from 40% in the previous location.

IA Interior Architects redesigned the office space, which spans eight floors and 190,000 square feet.

The employee-driven design includes:

Use of recycled natural materials and wood salvaged from the original Maritime Building.

Unique spaces to accommodate and energize all types of people and suit diverse working styles.

A rooftop amenities space that includes a gym, games room, and a deck complete with barbeque grill and fire pit.

A dedicated art space that will allow Big Fish's talented people to produce and display personal artwork.

Extensive daylight, external views, plants and natural materials throughout to enhance employee well-being.

To celebrate the new location, Big Fish has a fresh new look, complete with a new logo and brand that was designed to reflect the inspiring people who create Big Fish games, and the dynamic growth and evolution of the company.
