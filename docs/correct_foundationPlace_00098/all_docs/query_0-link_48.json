Thank you also to Rich Thomas and Matthew Dawkins, for understanding why this book took as long as it has and for helping me get it back up to speed. Although they did not survive to see this book’s completion, Raven Bond and Coyote Ashley Ward provided a significant part of its DNA. Raven, in particular, helped me puzzle my way through the emotional and metaphysical challenges involved, providing wise guidance and an educated understanding of the thornier aspects of this book and its contents. I miss them both deeply, and they’ve been a constant presence throughout the book’s creation. Shortly before this book’s completion, our friend Ember Johnston Nannydotter was killed in a car crash. Ember was a creative luminary in our Seattle community and a ferocious voice for justice and transformation. Their sudden and unforeseeable death underscores the need for all of us to appreciate one another while we can, and to live lives that make our world a better place long after we’re no longer physical parts of it. Thank you, Ember, for the beauty you shared and the spirit you revealed through your arts. Thanks go out as well to Francesca Gentille, my longtime friend and long-ago sweetheart, who taught me a lot about healing, descent, the Jungian shadow, and the treasures we might find in the Underworld. Thank you, love. This book holds a part of you as well. And though I won’t refer to them by name, certain people have inspired this book by living out examples of what Nephandi can be like. I hope you left less of a mark on the world in general than you left on me back then.\n\n© 2019 White Wolf Entertainment. All rights reserved.

Men must be made to blush and feel ashamed as belonging to the same species we do. I demand that a monument be raised to commemorate this crime and signal it to the whole world and that our names should be graven upon it by our own hands. — Saint-Fond, from Juliette, by the Marquis de Sade I promised long ago that I would never release a Players Guide to Nephandi. This isn’t one. Here’s why. One of my earliest memories involves my fascination with a pretty tile on our kitchen counter. When I asked my mother what it was for, she did something I couldn’t see, took me by the hand, lifted me up, and held my hand to the plate. It was a ceramic hot plate. I was three or four years old. When I screamed and pulled my hand away from her, Mom said, with chilling calm, “Now you know why you should never, ever touch that plate.” I love my mom, but that was a fucked-up thing to do to a toddler. She meant well, I guess, and she says she doesn’t remember it now. I do, though. I can’t forget it. About five years later, my family lived next door to a family called the Dunlaps. My sister and I were good friends with their kids. Some evenings, though, we would sit at the dinner table and listen to screams and smashing sounds coming through our townhouse wall. A few times, my father went over to have a word with Mr. Dunlap. Most nights, we would sit around the table and pretend not to hear the guy beating the shit out of his wife and kids. Like I said, their daughter and I were friends. One day, we were messing around with a tape recorder and she made some “jokes” that, in hindsight, strongly implied that her father was molesting her as well as beating her. Such a thought was totally alien to me when I was eight. I no longer have those tapes, and I’m really glad I can’t hear them with my middle-aged ears. The memories are bad enough.\n\nEvil is Not a Toy\n\n9\n\nMy childhood friend’s older sister spent some time in juvie. When I was around 11 years old, I asked her why. She told me how she and another girl had been angry at a classmate of theirs. And so, they held the girl down, pulled up her skirt, and poured bleach into her vagina. The sister laughed when she told me this. I realize now she was a literal psychopath. Last I knew, she was in prison. I never found out why, and I’m glad not to know. In college, one of my best friends, his then-girlfriend, and a mutual friend of ours spent a summer living in a cabin with a charismatic dude who thought of himself as a budding Aleister Crowley. I don’t know the details, but I know that summer involved grave-robbing, group sex, prodigious amounts of drugs, and a systemic program of psychological, physical, and sexual abuse. My friend did not speak for nearly six months after he came home, and his former personality was shattered. That girlfriend disappeared soon after they returned. The mutual friend later beat his own girlfriend into unconsciousness, came after her children (who locked themselves in the bedroom and called the cops), abducted her mother, and then forced the mother to drive him out of the city, at knifepoint. He’s now in prison too. I have no idea what happened to the guy who was behind all this…but I suspect he’s still out there somewhere, and I’m sure he’s done this to other people. In a shitty apartment complex my now ex-wife dubbed Domestic Abuse Central, we got to listen to drunk fathers and drugged mothers beating their children, each other, and anyone else unfortunate enough to be within reach. I wound up in a lot of brawls back then, and I was lucky to escape that situation without being arrested, seriously injured or killed. That same period saw another friend choked out by a boyfriend who tried to rape her, traded for drugs by a girlfriend, and stalked by both parties. Later, the ex-boyfriend tried to run her over with his car, and the ex-girlfriend threatened to burn down our building after the friend moved in with us…something one of our neighbors almost did one night when he had a psychotic break and set fire to his apartment. His next-door neighbor was beaten into a coma by some pals with a baseball bat, another neighbor was shot and killed by his wife’s boyfriend, and our upstairs neighbor beat and raped a woman he’d brought home from a bar. We had him locked up, but her screams that day were not something you can ever forget. There’s more…so much more: the “tough love rehab” where my non-druggie girlfriend was tortured for four months and her brother was driven to slow-motion suicide; a similar camp where my sister was beaten and sexually abused by the “counselors” in charge, and where her roommate committed suicide with a piece of glass; the atrocities I learned about in my time with Amnesty International and as a political activist for almost 40 years; the woman slammed through a plate-glass window by “pro-life” demonstrators during a showdown outside a women’s clinic in Washington, DC; the former gaming buddy who got caught renting a friend’s child out for sex on the internet. If I wrote about all the shit I’ve witnessed just in my own life, the results would seem impossible to believe. But I lived them. They were real. Evil, too, is real.\n\n10\n\nThe Book of the Fallen\n\nI’m not talking about painted Satans and otherworldly conspiracies. I mean the horrific things that go on right next door. Sometimes, we pretend not to see them. Sometimes we try to stop them. Most often, we don’t even know about them. And so, to many of us, evil becomes a joke. Worse still, it seems cool. Fun. Desirable. This book is personal. Personal in the sense that it’s rooted in real-life experiences and observations, and personal in that I, as the author, employ a more direct voice than usual throughout this book. Why? Because horror is personal. Evil is personal. Abuse and the triumph over it are personal, and so rendering those things in a blandly impersonal way robs them of impact and importance. To truly understand the Fallen and their effect on our fictional World of Darkness, I feel it’s necessary to bring you, the audience, eye to eye with the real-life fallout from the metaphorical evils the Nephandi represent. Personally, I faced evil in the hallway of an apartment building where a drunk ex-Marine with bloody fists justified beating a woman so badly the cops had to carry her out on a stretcher. I saw it in the eyes of a mob with tire irons and at least one knife, who closed in on me when they thought I was a drug addict. Sure, I’ve read books and seen movies, but the evilest things I can imagine came through in the jokes of my childhood friends and the laughter of a teenage kid who gang-raped a girl with bleach. Evil is not a toy. It’s the kid up your block who dresses like a ninja and brags about how he plans to break into girl’s rooms and attack them and then cut their throats. It’s the boyfriend of your sister who says he’ll assault your girlfriend just for fun, then holds you down and beats your ass just to show you that you can’t stop him from doing it. This isn’t four-color evil, and if you’re looking for a little comfort-food sadism then put this book down and go look elsewhere. Evil can be sexy. It can be cool. It’s often powerful because any and every tactic, to evil, is fair game. But it doesn’t look like bug-eyed monsters. It looks like us. It lives in a mother’s good intentions and a father’s drunken force. And then it walks down the streets alongside us, and only when it jumps out at us do we even know it’s there. That’s why I wrote this book. That’s where this comes from. That’s why there’s not a character sheet at the end of this book. I can’t stop you from playing a Fallen mage if you choose, but I’m not going to encourage you to do so. This book is not a player’s guide for fictional monstrosities. It’s a warning about real monsters who are already here.\n\nEvil is Not a Toy\n\n11\n\nIntroduction: Eaters of the Weak Compassion is the vice of kings: stamp down the wretched & the weak: this is the law of the strong. — Aleister Crowley, The Book of the Law You are prey. Prey to the gods, to mortality, to your own weakness. Prey for the Eaters of the Weak. And you don’t even know that yet. But you will. “Nephandi,” people call them. Raving idiots in black robes chanting blasphemous hymns to Otherworldly masters. Some say they were exiled. Or purged. Or nothing to worry about at all. They’re just goons with a fixation on death metal, cutting up kitty cats in homage to ludicrous ideas. Suckers. That’s exactly what they want you to think. Your ignorance makes them wise. Your hatred makes them strong. Your fear of everything and everyone around you cuts you off from the herd and serves you up on a paper plate, one more meal for aspiring gods.\n\nYou expect you’ll see them coming. You assume you’re immune. You figure there’s nothing they can say or do that will turn you from your righteous path. And you are deeply fucking wrong. The Eaters of the Weak are here. Among us. Possibly right next to you. They’re your sweethearts. They’re your mentors. They’re your parents, your friends and neighbors, your reflection. Those folks might not be initiated Nephandi. You might not have gone through the Cauls yourself. But trust me, and hear my words: You’re doing exactly what they want you to do. They’re winning, is my point. This is the Fallen Age, and we’re all on the menu. Wake up or be consumed.\n\nTrolling the Void To the uninitiated, the mages referred to as Nephandi are blood-drenched tentacle-fetishists, worshipping distant gods of chaos and destruction. According to some accounts, they were driven out beyond the Horizon sometime between the mid20th century and the early 21st. Rumors of an “Avatar Storm” (which, in your chronicle, may or may not have occurred) place\n\nthe Fallen out among the stars, their unquenchable evil living out an H. P. Lovecraft fever dream. Still other rumors put them in charge of everything from 4chan to the Technocratic Inner Circle. Gibbering through the deepest shadows of the World of Darkness, they grow horns and gut whatever virgins they can find. These metaphysical serial killers boast a shoot-on-sight status Introduction: Eaters of the Weak\n\n13\n\namong every other Awakened group. Even the Mad despise the Fallen, whose rampaging demon-fuckerey embodies the flipside of Ascension: an ideal devoted to eternal ending of all things. So, who are the Fallen, anyway? Behind the caricatured façade they use to misdirect their reality-bending rivals, who are these people whose devotion to malignancy might potentially end the world as we know it and usher in oblivion? The sad fact is they’re people just like us. Oh, sure — some of them do hack up vagrants and bathe themselves in blood. The extravagantly stupid ones paint targets on themselves by trying to act out Cannibal Corpse album covers, and the most metaphysically charged Nephandi grow too bizarre to survive long in earth’s Consensus Reality. Those are the Nephandi people see. The most accomplished Eaters of the Weak, however, are the ones you don’t see unless you know what to look for: The ones running companies and cults, pulling political strings, setting virtual warfare in motion, and simply getting us to hate each other just a little bit more than we already do. That’s what makes them so damn dangerous: Not wild magicks (though they command some) or Lovecraftian beasties (though they have a few of those as well), but the fact that they understand us all so damned well. Humanity is a disease in love with its own reflection, and the Fallen know this to be true. People like to think that evil is the Other, a snarling face of barbarism stamped across the features of the alien. But evil, in fact, looks like us. Is us, when we put aside our empathy. We’ll talk more about evil soon enough, but for now just realize that people suck and the Nephandi excel at convincing us to suck even worse. Such evil is a human prerogative. It’s as close as your reflection and as vivid as the comments section on any website you can name. We are the ultimate invasive species, cloaking our condition under projections and myths that, gods forbid, look nothing like us, oh no. We seek out evil in them and those people, chasing the truth before us with a prayer. The true evil, though, is in us all along. The more we deny it, the stronger it grows. Humanity prospers in spite of itself. Man’s natural predator is other humans. When we combine our efforts, we create miraculous horrors and horrific miracles. Human history is written in blood. The end of our species, most likely, will not come by way of angry gods or an exploding star but by mankind putting a gun in its mouth and firing just because we can. It’s a precious gravity that holds our world intact — a hope for a better future and a determination to bring that future about. The driving force of Mage’s Ascension War derives from an ideal that we can rise above our self-destructive urges and become the angels we always dreamed we might be. The fault lines in that dream come from selfish blindness, the lure of power, and the traumas that bind us to our private pain. When stressed, we often break apart. Dreams shatter. Despair pours in. Ideals become fanaticism. The center, as Yeats said, cannot hold, and that precious gravity instead becomes an undertow. 14\n\nThe Book of the Fallen\n\nSociopathy Chic vs. Clinical Sociopathy Are Nephandi sociopaths? No. Clinical sociopathy — detailed further in Chapter Two — is an involuntary mental condition. The Fallen behave callously but that behavior is a conscious choice, not a neurological condition. Throughout this book, however, we’ll use the term “sociopathy chic” to describe behavior that mocks and demolishes empathy. In this context, we’re referring to choices of philosophy and behavior, not to the neurological condition known variously as psychopathy, sociopathy, or ASPD (Antisocial Personality Disorder). A few passages refer to “clinical sociopathy.” In this book, that term reflects a person who does have that internal lack of empathy but may or may not choose to behave like the proverbial psychopath. That lack of empathy does not itself make a person into a monster, and plenty of human monsters have an innate sense of empathy but choose not to use it. The distinction between clinical and chic, in this book, divides people who have a condition they cannot control from folks who choose to toss empathy out the window for fun, profit, and fashion’s sake. A politician who guts environmental protections and waves away the human cost indulges in sociopathy chic — he might have the clinical condition, or he might not, but in either case he acts with disregard for the effects of his action on other people. For more about the clinical condition, see “Psychopath, Sociopath, Narcissist or Fallen?” on pp. 44-45. 44-45.\n\nNephandi personify a metaphysical gravity well, drawing everything toward ultimate annihilation. A malignant mass feeding on human frailties, they pull in everything they touch. Where other mages seek to exalt humanity, the Fallen help us to debase ourselves. We’re doomed. They know it. And they want us to know it, too. Oh, they’ll seek personal power, sure. Many aspire to godhood of a sort, stepping outside the human rat-race and seizing power through cosmic transcendence. Their dark enlightenment, however, involves a predatory glee in humanity’s extinction. There is no “better tomorrow” for us — that’s a lie. Instead, there’s a gaping, voracious now that exists in the space between self-delusion and self-destruction. That void is the beginning of all things, and likewise is its end. The Nephandic endgame is not a CGI monster-fest in which titanic elder gods break through and stage an orgy of madness across the earth. It’s much simpler than that: They want to destroy hope, gut compassion, feed on our future, and\n\nmake us love them for it. They’re the hidden ringmasters of global extinction, laughing as we make our world burn. They turn extremity into virtue and empathy to ash. For them, the war for reality is won when we hate ourselves and one another so badly that no better reality is possible. Their aim, ultimately, involves killing hope itself. Kill hope, and you kill the future. That’s when the lights go out for good. The Traditions, Technocracy, and Crafts, despite their many flaws, strive toward the common good. The Nephandi don’t bother. To them, there is no “common good.” In its place is a continued state of subjugation of the weak by the strong under pretenses of justice. The only good worth striving for is individual Descent: The state of ultimate Enlightenment gained through wandering the Abyss and coming out the other side as a newly elevated god. Like all ideals, of course, this state of godhood may itself be just one further state of delusion — a pretty thing to strive for but ultimately yet another prison. The only true surety is that this Fallen world is damned. And so, though Nephandi might quest toward an ideal of dark transcendence, they know in a practical sense that we’re all fucked anyway and so they might as well have a great time while they can before the lights go out forever.\n\nReality Check\n\nThe Book of the Fallen is not a simple gaming sourcebook. It’s an exploration of human atrocity, a de-glamorization of evil that seems too often glamorous. Its words and sentiments are often racist, sexist, homophobic, sadistic, greedy, vain, treacherous, vile, and altogether repugnant to me. Those words should in no way be construed as the honest sentiments of the authors. This\n\nis not a player’s guide; in intention, at the very least, it’s very much the opposite of that. By the same token, it’s no mere monster manual, filled with spooky enemies to kill. Evil is complex, and those dedicated to it are even more so. The Fallen are, of course, fictional. There isn’t actually a conspiracy or six rewriting reality behind the scenes. Or is there? Especially when you’re dealing with a fictional game about metaphysical reality wars, it’s sometimes hard to realize where fiction ends, and reality begins. The book in your hands features real-life evils: abuse culture, human trafficking, callousness as a fashion statement, and far, far worse conducted not by shadowy maleficeans but by people you might like, respect, or even love. Although there aren’t really cabals of reality-warping mages dictating the fate of humankind, the realities described in this book run deeper than cardboard Satanists and their facile rituals. The Nephandi personify what’s worst about ourselves. Abuse and violence are innate elements of the human condition… perhaps even of life on earth, and certainly of life as we know it. Given the current state of upheaval, though, we are — in real life — at a point of crisis in the human experiment. Mage in general, and the Fallen in particular, are reflections of that crisis in this age. On both an intimate and an epic scale, this book shows how we really are being abused by people who profit from our fear, and how we might, in fact, become those people, too. Mage’s “battle for reality” is fictional, yet also real.\n\nIntroduction: Eaters of the Weak\n\n15\n\nThemes: Predation, Abuse, Horror, Evil, and Compassion Fuck you, suckers — I’ve got mine! Although the average Nephandus can weave esoteric explanations for the philosophies that drive them (see the Paradigms explored in Chapter Five), the core of the Fallen Path can be summed up simply: You’re either predators or prey. The Fallen prefer the former role, thank you very much. As unapologetic predators of the mortal and metaphysical worlds, the Fallen represent that selfish urge to excel at the cost of others, if only because otherwise someone else will excel at cost to you. And so, the themes of this book involve the malevolent tactics used by predators, the horrors of imminent mortality and human cruelty, and the compassion the Fallen forsake, even though it’s the cornerstone of human survival.\n\nPredation\n\nEat or be eaten is a core ethos for Fallen folk. Everyone’s on the menu, really, but some folks have a better spot at the table and so they treat the rest of their world as meat and drink at the banquet of the gods. Vampires and shapeshifters are predators, certainly, with infernal spirits and malevolent aliens dwarfing such entities in power and hunger alike. Humans, by such epic standards, are cattle; Kindred even refer to them as “kine.” Mages are a different breed, however, and Nephandi are the apex predators among them. The Nephandic Path toward their vision of Ascension is carved from the bones of their prey and enemies. Essentially a pursuit of self-godhood, it posits a metaphysical arms-race in which the only meaningful end is the domination of others for the glory of the self. Certain Fallen may place their faith in even greater predators, tossing their lot in with demons and gods who they believe (perhaps rightly) are poised on the edge of devouring our world; others seek ultimate transcendence through the assumption of divinity by essentially eating a god and taking his place. Regardless of their personal beliefs, Nephandi are predators, one and all. In the ancient tongue of Bhât, the mythic Eden of earthly domination, their name means “the Eaters of the Weak,” and they take that title seriously.\n\nAbuse, Metaphor, and Reality\n\nFor predators and prey alike, the most common tool of domination involves abusing another party in order to gain control over them. Such abuse can be as blatant as a slap across the face, or as subtle as pervasive love-bombing aimed at isolating a person 16\n\nThe Book of the Fallen\n\nfrom outside influence. Nephandi excel at a wide spectrum of abusive techniques, using the ones that seem most effective for the job at hand. Thus, the Fallen can seem like generous friends and kindly lovers — the most awesome folks you’d ever want to meet…until the moment you seem to be slipping the leash of their control, at which point anything goes. The Book of the Fallen presents an ugly metaphor of abuse on an intimate yet cosmic scale. But it also provides a toolkit for dealing with abuse. In the face of all that’s going down in the world, a game about reality-wizards might feel absurd. But yet… Hope is fundamentally absurd. So much so that, to the Fallen, hope is a lie that needs to be purged. That’s what abusers do: They try to crush hope. It’s all about power. Who has it, who doesn’t, how we claim it, and what we do with it. And because so much of Mage is about power, certain mages believe that the ultimate power involves destroying hope.\n\nWhat is Abuse? What do we mean here by abuse? A systemic pattern of dependence, isolation, exploitation, threats, damage and fear. Fictional Nephandi perpetrate abuse because they believe they have the right to do so, because it profits them to do so, and because it’s fun to do so. Real-life abusers aren’t nearly as obvious about their motives and nature, and they tend to abuse people out of a sense of their own fears about weakness and vulnerability. That said, some people really do enjoy hurting other people, make their livings by hurting other people, feel justified about hurting other people, and — in the case of mental illness, inculturation, or similar conditions — might not even realize they’re hurting other people. Secretive as they are, the fictional Nephandi tend to be more obvious and intentional about the abuses they commit. Real-life abusers often aren’t as overtly evil as the Fallen, but that doesn’t make the damage they inflict any less painful to the people on the wrong side of it. In real life, we’re surrounded by abusers and abuse, and some people make excuses for such behavior“ “He’s just angry,” “she’s just scared,” “once you get to know them, you’ll understand why they act that way.” Abusers get voted into power. People might give them money, love, and faith. The cycle of abuse runs so deep and strong that despite loathing abuse, we might find ourselves carrying it out. Mages, too, can be abusers. The Fallen excel at such things, but they’re not the only ones who do it. The Technocracy is abusive in the name of “the greater good,” and behind their castles-and-unicorns ideals the Traditions have an appalling\n\nhistory of abuse as well. The Crafts tend to be forged by abuse, so their members often pass abuse along to anyone who gets in their way. Marauders may provide the ultimate example of people who’ve been abused so badly that they can’t recognize the damage they inflict upon others as abuse. The Nephandi, though — and this point is vital — choose to abuse. Predation is essential to their concept of Ascension, and their ideal involves abusing everybody else in the universe, forever. Yes, Nephandi are often victims of abuse themselves, but that element of choice marks the Fallen as the ultimate perpetrators of abuse.\n\nTechniques of Abuse Nephandi, like abusers in the real world, use the following techniques (detailed further in Chapter Two): • Shower the target with affection, to buy that target’s trust. • Lie about what they’re doing, to conceal the abuser’s flaws and motives. • Point in someone else’s direction, to distract the abused party and get them angry at someone other than the abuser. • Promise great things, to keep the target craving more attention. • Isolate the target, to reconstruct the reality the abuser wants to enforce. • Undercut the target’s sense of reality and self, to establish control “for your own good.” • Blame the target and exercise “discipline,” in order to show the abused party who’s boss. • Threaten severe consequences, so the abused party will fear losing the abuser’s favor. • Explode (the part people finally recognize as abuse). • Repent, apologize, and reconcile, to keep the abused party close. • Repeat these techniques, as often as the abuser can get away with repeating them. That explosion might be emotional, social, financial, physical, even — in the case of religious and metaphysical communities — spiritual. Whatever form it takes, the explosion is punishment aimed at hurting the target as much and as badly as possible at the time. The “apology and reconciliation” technique covertly blames the abused party for the explosion (“You made me do it… if you would just stop doing that…”) while taking a superficial amount of blame that’s still manipulative as hell (“I can’t help it — I just love you so much…”).\n\nAn experienced abuser varies those techniques in whichever order appears to work best for a particular target. Most real-world abusers, like the fictional Nephandi, have honed these techniques in advance, and realize which techniques work best on you before you even realize they’re manipulating you. This cycle of abuse is further detailed in Chapter Seven, pp. 207-208. For now, just realize the most vital step to escaping abuse is to see it for what it is.\n\nBreaking the Power of Abuse Mage is a game about transforming reality. The Fallen are metaphors for abusive people and techniques. And this book is about recognizing, escaping, and moving beyond abuse. How can we do that, then? Faced with people — imaginary or otherwise — who excel at remaking realities with their victims on the bottom and them on the top, how can people overcome that situation and transform their reality into one where hope is possible? There’s no single answer to that question, because so much depends upon personal circumstances. The following tactics, though, can help: • Recognize what’s going on: Abusers thrive on misdirection, excuses, and blaming other people — especially the people they’re abusing — for the problem. The first step, then, involves realizing the cool person you thought you knew is a façade hiding someone who thinks abusing people is okay, maybe even justified. Yeah, no — fuck that shit. Read up on abuse, if you can, or talk to people familiar with abuse and recovery. If the stuff you hear seems familiar, you’re probably being abused. • Refuse to be Blamed: Abusers blame their targets for the things they do. While it’s important to recognize one’s own flaws, abusers exaggerate those flaws or blame the flaws on “those people” in order to keep their targets focused on hating themselves or other parties. Because abusers — and the Nephandi are very good at this part — present themselves as someone the abused party needs, it’s often hard to see the game when you’re in the middle of it. That’s especially true for folks who had low self-esteem before the abuser even showed up. Abusers target desperate, insecure people, though, and so a major step in overcoming abuse involves refusing to bear the blame for things the abuser chooses to do. • Recognize Your Worth: No matter what an abuser tells you, you do not deserve to be abused. Everyone has an awesome quality or two. Use them. Draw strength from them. Start from there, see what other qualities you possess (if possible, ask someone else to help you get perspective), and see yourself as you are, not as your abuser tells you you are. Introduction: Eaters of the Weak\n\n17\n\n• Set and Maintain Boundaries: Abusers strive to control reality for other people. Setting boundaries, regarding what you will and will not put up with, takes control of your reality back from the abuser. They probably won’t like that. Tough. It is your right to set boundaries regarding your body, emotions, physical and financial safety, and so forth. While legal exceptions exist for minors and incapacitated adults — exceptions that non-abusers will not exploit in order to abuse you — you are the ultimate authority about your boundaries. Recognize it, enforce it, enjoy the autonomy, and if the abusive party cannot accept those boundaries, then… • Realize You Have Options: Abusers isolate their targets and tell them they have no options. Unless a person is a child, an invalid, or in actual captivity — and sometimes even then — escape options exist. Depending on circumstances, those options can include:\n\n◊ D omestic violence shelters and advocate groups, assuming some exist in your area. ◊ Friends or family (who are not friendly with the abuser). ◊ Legal authorities, if you feel they can be trusted. ◊ Leaving your relationship, job, home, neighborhood, or social circle. Escape won’t be easy, but if you can contact someone else to help you form and execute an escape plan, those options exist. If you can’t currently contact someone, look for an opportunity to do so.\n\n• Get Out: If at all possible, get out. If it’s not possible, then plan for potential escapes, and use those plans 18\n\nThe Book of the Fallen\n\nas soon as possible. If the abuser has displayed a potential for violence, then get as far from that party as possible and put as many layers of protection as you can between the abuser and yourself. Whatever the circumstances might be, remember: Abuse is not your fault, and you do not deserve to be abused.\n\nHorror So… what scares you? Is it pain? Rejection? Betrayal? Perhaps the fear that those people (whomever “those people” happen to be) are stealing your world right out from under you? Do you fear loss? Damnation? A failure of control? Whatever it is, fear becomes a weapon in the hands of Nephandi. That which you fear, they employ. Not because they’re boo-scary devil-people, but because fear is the greatest method of control. Fear galvanizes the human animal. It snaps us to attention in ways no other impulse can. The rush of chemicals and neurological connections sharpens senses and focuses every element of our minds and bodies upon survival. In excess, it can paralyze us too, either by locking us into a state of shock or by sweeping us into an irrational and often addictive haze. Too much fear becomes a drug — lulling us into a stupor, distracting us from every other thing, and hooking us on the burst of fight-or-flight miasma until we’re like rats in an electrified cage, shitting ourselves with conflicting urges of sensation and escape. Fear can, in the right hands, become a form of enlightenment. More commonly, however, it’s a tool of command. Scared people obey those who promise action. We look for targets of our rage, because a good punch in someone else’s face seems like strength when we’re afraid. If somebody points that face out to us, and\n\nthen promises us a chance to punch it in, many people do just that. Terror, therefore, provokes desire — the thrill of stimulation and the potential to strike back at the things we think we fear. For those who follow the Nephandic Path, fear unlocks the doorway to fearlessness. By making a friend of horror, the Fallen strive to toss aside their own mortality. Meanwhile, they command the tools prepared by other people’s fears — and then, through those tools, elevate themselves above the masses they use as sustenance for potential godhood. Fear, then, is the path to self-divinity… a state achieved by feeding on the fears of lesser mortals while laughing at the heat-death of the universe. So, again — what scares you? The Fallen probably know that answer better than you do. And if you don’t already fear them, then it’s probably time to start.\n\nEvil Anyone can commit evil. The Fallen embrace evil. What, though, is “evil?” Modernist and postmodern philosophies claim there’s no such thing, while religious theologies claim that many things outside their purview are innately evil. What does the word even mean anymore? That’s a complicated subject we’ll explore further in this book. For now, let’s just say that intentional malignancy is a defining characteristic of Nephandic identity… not the facile alien evil of cartoonish villains but the pervasive evil that remains an inescapable element of human existence.\n\nCompassion “Neither heaven nor earth is humane,” states the Tao Te Ching. “They regard all things as straw-dog offerings. Nor is the sage humane. He regards all things as straw-dog offerings.” Taken literally, this passage, and others like it, appears to sanction callous enlightenment. Why should a master shed tears for the servant’s plight? What value is the smartest worm if it lies in the path of a master’s feet? Mages, whose regard for “sleepers” and “the masses” often extends only so far as it takes to see if anybody’s watching when they throw a fireball, aren’t usually as compassionate as they’d like to think they are. For Nephandic mages, compassion is a weakness, and all weakness must be purged. Enlightenment without compassion can attain an awful cruelty. Hermetic slave-owners, Etherite bio-tinkerers, Thanatoic assassins… such monsters make vampires cringe. The certainty of Awakened power tends to blind mages to the effects their actions have on other people. Aw, gee — another gas-main explosion? Who cares about the folks who lost their homes, that kid with third-degree burns, the firefighters who risk their lives to put out the blaze? That damn HIT Mark had it coming, and everyone else is collateral damage for my Ascension… right? Imagine, then, how cruel a mage can be when that person has deliberately killed compassion in his heart. What he might be capable of with the power of the Spheres and no conscience about using it. Compassion is the failsafe switch of social animals, and a mage without it becomes the most awful sort of fiend.\n\nDoes such a fiend deserve compassion? Should other mages regard him as a potential subject for reform? If a person (mage or otherwise) treasures compassion, then should we then have sympathy even for these devils? If you were looking for easy answers, you’ve come to the wrong place.\n\nHow to Use This Book • Author’s Preface: Evil is Not a Toy presents the primary author’s intent behind this book.

In life as in the game, people are working Introduction: Eaters of the Weak\n\n19\n\nto destroy hope and define reality in their image. We might lack the powers of the Spheres but we can still use such knowledge to keep from being victimized. Despite the fictional nature of the Fallen, the tactics described in the following chapters are used each day to deceive us, break us, pit us against each other, and perhaps ultimately destroy us. If parts of this book cut close to home, then look close at what’s going on in that home. Mage is a game, true, but it has always been intended to be more than simple entertainment. From its inception, Mage has been a metaphor for stuff that’s really going on, and there truly is a battle going on to determine the reality of our species, our planet, and our selves. Underneath the people we choose to be, there’s a darker\n\nshadow we suppress. It’s in all of us, no matter how gentle or righteous we might wish to be. It might take different forms and hold different views, but our forbidden self is always there. It’s nasty and it’s cruel and it sometimes gets the better of us even when we see ourselves as heroes. Our task, then, in gaming and in life, is to be better than that — to “do the right thing” and embrace the better angels of our nature. The Fallen refuse to do that, though. For them, evil is transcendent virtue. Our light is their shadow, and they aim to smother it and turn all Creation into ash. This book is not for everyone, and you may want to bail out now.\n\nNephandic Lexicon Absolute, the: The Void at the beginning and end of all things, whose violation by Light provided the origin of suffering.

Though considered traditional, the following honorifics (aside from Ashraaah) are rather archaic, and the newer generation doesn’t pay much attention to them anymore. Capitalization is a matter of taste, combined with the desire to not get cooked by a pissed-off elder. Adsinistratus: A specialist in temptation, corruption, subversion, betrayal, and renunciation of previous ethics and loyalties. Plural adsinistrati. Ashraaah: A powerful Nephandus who has created her own Realm(s) and largely exiled herself from Earth. Plural Ashraaahs. (See Gilledian.) Aswad: A “bodhisattva of the Abyss” who appears to be a normal person but is actually a Nephandus of deceptive and astonishing power. Sometimes also used to refer to Nephandic Archmages or (rarely) Oracles. Plural aswadim. According to rumor, only six or seven such entities exist, but they are, by nature, deceptive, so there may be fewer of them… or more. dregvat: Old name for a Nephandic pawn, cultist, or ally. Plural dregvati. Often referred to as “the dregs,” this title is never capitalized, as dregs are not worth that much respect. Gilledian: Absurdly powerful and deformed Nephandi whose paranormal talents and scars have left them unfit for earthly reality. Named for the infamous French Infernalist Gilles de Rais. Plural gilledians or sometimes gillediai. Lila: Old name for a Nephandic elder of the feminine gender. Named, of course, for Lilith. Plural lili, lilai. Prelate: Nephandic elder of formidable power and influence but subtle tactics. Plural prelati. Shaytan: Violent Nephandic stormtrooper, AKA cannon fodder. Plural shaytans. Introduction: Eaters of the Weak\n\n23\n\nChapter One: The Awful Truth If you go far back enough into any villain’s story, you’ll find they started as the hero. — Jen Soska The moon above is blood, dripping red upon the earth below. Its surface writhes with tortured souls, the essence of those born and shunned and damned before Earth had a name and before humanity crawled from the shadows of their overlords and claimed the sun as a beacon of their light. Behind the stars above, the Abyss waits, hungry, eager to consume. Yet such eagerness is measured in eternities, and an age will pass before its maw gapes wide and swallows our sun. Damp soil beneath my feet squirms with maggots and rot. Dense smells enrapture me — shit, sweat, sweetness, decay. The carnal perfumes daze my senses, carry me like atoms on the breeze. I am the rotting corpse, the fly, the stench. They mingle within me, becoming one. The moon bleeds, and I bleed with it. She comes to me as serpents, their jaws like lions, their teeth\n\nthe needles which piece the skin. Her kiss is heroin. Her eyes, desire. Her serpent-self wraps around my limbs, sinking needles, ripping skin. They clench my muscles, grind my bones. In rapture, I am lost to pain. Descend. Arise. Consumed. Consume. She spits my pieces in the dust. I bleed into soil, like the moon. The dark enfolds me. Stars disappear. Light flees the coming of the purge. All breath is silence. All sound stills. In depthless blackness, I unfold — my wings arcing to catch the stars. I am nothing. We are All. My self is my prison, and my sentence is forever.\n\nEnough Aren’t you tired of it? The white noise of consumer culture? The treadmill of work-sleep-consume-repeat? The platitudes and lies tossed at your head as if they’re supposed to mean a goddamned thing? Purity commandos sweeping in to tell you what you cannot say and who you can and cannot say it about? Folks telling you to be ashamed of who and what you are? Haven’t you just gotten sick of it all yet?\n\nI am. The world as we know it is a trap. It is. We are bred like sheep to fleece and consume and wallow in our own shit while the farmer sits in his house and gets rich off our existence. You think you’re better than the so-called “masses,” right? Well, you’re not. You’re just another sucker trapped in the pen with the rest of us, ankle deep in manure and baaing our Chapter One: The Awful Truth\n\n25\n\nDrinking From a Broken Glass Our esteemed narrator may be telling the truth as they know it. That doesn’t make them right about what they say. “Truth” is slippery, often conditional, and subject to change when you view it from a different perspective. If this Nephandic tour guide seems to be making a little too much sense, just remember — that’s the way they work: Use just enough truth to get what they want, and then tilt it in the direction that makes them sound right even when what they’re saying is abominable. Don’t get me wrong: They make some pretty good points here. It’s just part of the picture, though — a broken glass, so to speak, half-full of blood and the other half filled with sewage. They’re not wrong, exactly, but do you want to drink that shit? Or do you want a new glass, even if you have to clean it up yourself? More to the point, would you want to take that broken glass and feed its contents to an innocent kid? Because that is what the Fallen do. Rather than drink from that glass themselves, they force the contents down someone else’s throat, or trick another person into drinking it, and then consider themselves superior for doing so. Hey, at least they didn’t drink from that glass, right? I guess that makes them smarter than you. Except, of course, they’re not. They’re just too lazy to get another goddamned glass, and so in love with themselves that they feel clever about forcing poison down someone else’s throat if that means they didn’t drink it themselves. The Fallen lash out because lashing out makes them feel strong. It’s fear and pain disguised as righteous fury because at least that feels better than surrender.\n\nstupid heads off at each other while the farmer sharpens his knife and decides which of us will get sheared and which of us will breed and which of us will get eaten today. Don’t you see the cage? Really, how can you not? They’re not even trying to be subtle about it anymore. They know they can grin and say all the right words and you’ll keep on punching that clock, keep on busting your ass, keep on pulling the lever for thieves and liars because at least your thieves and liars are better than those other guys’ thieves and liars, right? Don’t you want better than that? I know I do. I used to be like you. I was like you, once. Raised to do the right thing, be a nice little kid, keep my room clean, go to school, go to work, pay my taxes, make money, buy stuff, maybe fuck once in a while if I get lucky, the whole deal. I got schooled the good old-fashioned way, too: yelling, hitting, the\n\n26\n\nThe Book of the Fallen\n\nback of the hand, the belt across my ass, threats, shame, all the best ways to beat the Devil out of you. Sit up straight, don’t curse, don’t slouch, be a lady, be a gentleman, do what you’re told, and if we think you’re good enough, and smart enough, and a hard-enough worker to pull yourself up out of this pit we dropped you into, then we’ll stick you in this little box — maybe if you’re really good, a bigger, better box! — and chain you to a paycheck while taking most of it back for ourselves. That’s what normal looks like. That’s the training we receive. I used to be like you, until I broke the leash and buried my teeth in the master’s face. I did it. You can, too. Look, you seem like a smart cookie, so I’ll be straight with you. Honest. Full disclosure. Why should I lie to you, anyway? Lying’s too much work. Fuck that. Truth is simpler and lot more effective. You can take it however you please. I don’t care. We’re all on this ride together, and you knowing where it’s going isn’t gonna change the tracks. You don’t have to be a pawn. You don’t need to play their games. Sure, they’ll scream and pitch a fit once you step off their path but that’s their problem. It doesn’t have to be yours. Life sucks. That part’s inevitable. But you can make it suck a lot less if you step up and refuse to play victim anymore. You have the potential to remake the world in your own image, at least to a small degree, and to establish your own place at the top of the heap instead of at the bottom. That’s what we do. People like me. You probably shouldn’t be seen talking to me this way, but hey — here we are, and the door’s right there if you want to use it. Just realize that if you stick around and listen, you’ll see the world differently. Dangerously. Without illusions or restraint. Other folks won’t like that. Really won’t. They might censure you, curse you, maybe even kill you, burn your soul, and blow the ashes out Oblivion’s ass just for sitting here with me. That’s a risk you take if you want to hear the truth. Straight up, no bullshit bought or sold. I have what you want if you’re willing to listen to what I have to say. If not, it’s no skin off my nose. Save me the time and yourself the trouble. Life is a war. Always has been, always will be. Expecting anything different is delusion. All that shit about peace and respect and equality is just a tactic to take what’s yours and hand it off to someone else. You are a predator, or you are prey. It’s that simple. Those of us who refuse to be prey must step off the Sheeple Express and make our own way in this world, and anyone who stands in the way of our freedom deserves to get mowed down. That’s the truth, and I’m sticking to it. Not going anywhere, huh? Okay. This is on you, then. Are you ready for alternatives? If so, let’s talk…\n\nThe Atrocity Exhibition\n\nWelcome to our world. It is our world, you know. It always has been, but now, with the dreams of a new era dying amidst the storms of war, catastrophe, and unrelenting global hatred, the fact is indisputable. We are the masters of this age, its avatars and puppeteers, the gleaming embodiment of our most sacred truth: Man is a monster, God is a dick, and the only thing you can truly depend upon is yourself. Now, more than ever before, this is clear. Our rival brethren disagree, of course. They hold the charming view that man can elevate his baser self. The children of technology await Utopia, shaped by brilliant minds and noble hearts, refusing to admit that their palaces of plastic, steel, and glass are — at root — dirt baked in fire until it assumes a semblance of accomplishment. The god-criers preach salvation through cosmic overlords whose wisdom makes order out of primal chaos. Philosophers fumble toward abstract ideals beyond the grasp of mortal men, while reformers bleed for compassion that will never come. Other mages devote their lives to what could be. We devote our lives to what is. And what is, as anyone with clear sight can see, is a realm of depthless horrors paved over with delusions of civility.\n\nLet’s take a stroll, shall we? We can start with your next-door neighbor’s house, where the father’s beating the fuck out of his wife and kids while the “news” tells him how liberal traitors are destroying America. If you’ve got the stomach for it, we can go pop by after the punches stop falling and everyone’s headed off to bed, when dad goes to “check in on” his little girl in ways he hasn’t “checked in on” his wife for months. But hey — I’m not saying all the bad guys are right-wing conservatives or anything like that. Hell, the guys down the block, the ones running that cool RPG on the weekends and saying all the right things on social media, convinced a woman in their gaming group that renting out her kid to pedophiles was an excellent way to pay off the dope debt she owes them. I’ve got to hand it to those boys, that was one slick sales presentation! Worthy of one of our very own, and yet they’re still convinced they’re good guys in the eyes of their oh-so-progressive social-media friends. Men suck, don’t they? Total garbage people, all of them. Just ask that girl who secretly hounded a few of her classmates to suicide last year. She’ll tell you. She told them. Oh, nobody’s put the pieces together yet — she’s good at what she does. That pathetic old dude who’s been buying her whiskey in return for an hour or so of her flirtations thinks she’s pretty amazing, too, even though he hasn’t gotten so much as a hug for his troubles. They’re just friends, that’s what he keeps telling himself. Two of the boys who killed themselves thought so, too…and that one girl who imagined Chapter One: The Awful Truth\n\n27\n\nherself to be that charming young lady’s best friend starved herself into the hospital last month but remains convinced she’s too fat because her “best friend” keeps telling her she is. The guy at this address dragged a girl behind his buddy’s pickup truck, then dumped their human ragdoll off a bridge. The poor kid was still alive at the time, but the river finished her off eventually. There’s the grandma who threatened to snip her grandson’s penis off with garden shears if she caught him playing with it again, and the old war vet who still smiles when he recalls the young Vietnamese woman whose teeth he knocked out with an M-16 when she cursed him out in perfect French. We haven’t even left the block and there’s enough human sewage here to choke an angel. The “artist” whose wife does sex work exclusively to support their heroin habit, the day-laborer who drinks his pay away trying to forget the friend he left cooking in a storage container when the guy threatened to rat him out to the employer they’d been stealing from, the old lady who poisons cats when no one’s looking, then buries them in her backyard so the neighbors don’t find out…And you idealistic morons think you can redeem this species? Human beings are trash. It’s our natural state, and all the enlightened homilies in the world won’t change that. That’s not even a bad neighborhood, really — not one of those places where your girlfriend would sell you out for a baggie of meth, or where bangers with bruised knuckles and gun-oil fingertips grab girls off the streets and rent them by the hour, or where every other warehouse holds human traffic with busted teeth and broken spirits. Or one of the really high-end areas, either — the ones where asking, “How many people do I have to kill in order to afford a house here?” is not a joke, it’s a fact. The well-lit homes where literal slaves get flown in from Syria or India or Ukraine with promises of a work visa or shelter from this month’s latest war. The mansions where wealthy tyrants rape entire generations of relatives and servants and get away with it all because no one wants to upset the applecart everybody eats from. The office buildings where go-getters figuratively slit one another’s throats for the corner office while figuring out which mercenary company will be most effective at wiping out those local troublemakers…and then go home to their beautiful homes and their lovely but disposable wives, while attending prayer breakfasts with their local representatives and bragging about how soon the government will operate under biblical law. Let’s go even further out, shall we? To those mountains of garbage where barefooted children scrounge for sellable scraps while industrial poisons eat them from the inside out. To the refugee camps under a blazing-hot sun, where a mouthful of water costs more than the average laborer makes in a week. To the “humanitarian aid” centers where hippie do-gooders force local girls and boys to fuck for food and water, or the “tender years” center where fleeing kids have been separated from their families by a bureaucratic machine and then sold off to slavers, pervs, and the local “disaster relief” agency for healthy profits under the table. You don’t even need to go to one of the many war-ravaged clearinghouses of weapon sales and religious carnage and see the people with blown-off arms 28\n\nThe Book of the Fallen\n\nand drone-shattered faces. You can just sit at home and browse the internet for “Russian brides” and “Asian girls looking for love” — or, in blunter terms, for on-demand-sex-slaves who won’t dare say “no” unless they’re looking for deportation back to something even worse. Check the dark web ads for rent-by-hour children, or spend all day clicking links for torture porn where all the screams are real. You don’t need to go to hell, is what I’m saying here, because hell is already here, all around us, every day. We live in it, we play in it, we create it, and we enjoy it. From the shittiest squat to the tallest gleaming glass tower, human beings feed on innocence, shit out money, and call themselves virtuous for deeds that would shame Satan himself. They even graft the face of their god across churches filled with child porn and temples built from the literal bones of the men who laid the foundations. They’ll whip a woman to death for loving the wrong person, chase little girls back into a burning school, or jet around the world on a fleet of private planes paid for by food taken from the mouths of starving kids. Who needs a statue of Mammon, after all, when you can feed babies into the fuel tank of a Lear Jet while calling yourself an emissary of your god? This is the face of your Sleeping Masses, kid. This is the reality behind Ascension’s ideals: A cancerous species of self-deluded chromosomes, causing misery by drawing breath. An extermination-level event on two legs, bragging about how the gods it designed in its own flawed image love it best. There’s so much nonsense out there about my kind. It’s like someone shat out a bunch of bad horror-movie clichés and thought they were saying something profound about us. Here’s the truth — the real truth that, as that one guy said in that ‘80s movie, you can’t handle. We are the Fallen. All of us. We make reality the shitshow that it is. Who needs “elder gods” and “Dark Masters” from the Void when plain old human evil does the job? It’s been said that man’s a virus. That’s an insult to the virus and gives too much credit to the man. A virus doesn’t know what it’s doing; human beings do. Hypocrisy and violence are in our DNA. We conquer and torture and butcher and destroy and then pat ourselves on the backs for a job well done because that’s what human beings do. There are, as some biblical jackass put it, none righteous — no, not one. The brighter the light, the deeper the shadow, and all humanity walks within that shadow, averting our eyes from the image on the wall. Humans don’t require boogeymen to destroy our world. We do it every day for fun and profit, close our eyes, and binge watch another show while whole fucking nations burn. You can’t save that which does not wish to be saved. The only “ascension” humanity deserves is the end of our long, bad joke. It’s not just human beings who are awful, either. It’s everything. I mean really: Cancer? Ebola? Brain-eating zombie-ant fungus? Even without our deep wells of despicable humanity, gods and\n\nnature have conspired to lock us on a funhouse of horrors. Let’s all be honest with ourselves: Creation fucking sucks. It’s a rigged game and we all lose in the end. Between a traumatic birth and a painful death, we live in a world of sickness, violence, disease, deformity, war… not just human beings but every living thing. Life exists at the expense of other life, and the lives snuffed out to feed their stronger counterparts often die in excruciating fear. Life is terror and agony and death — that’s the bottom line. If this is some god’s divine plan, then that god is an asshole. If it’s random chance, then life is meaningless. The only fact of life is that we are born from pain, live in pain, and die in pain…and if we’re unfortunate enough to wind up in some cosmic hell, as most people do, then we’re in pain after death as well…and then, if we’re not so stuck on ourselves that we wind up anchored in that final afterlife, then we’re reborn through reincarnation to live in pain again, and again, and again, and again… And it’s not like this pain is merely physical. Consciousness makes it even worse. I mean, it’s bad enough, I guess, to be a blade of grass…grass which, by the way, has a degree of awareness, too, even if your lawn will never write The Complete Works of William Shakespeare. The grass doesn’t contemplate its place in the universe the way we do, though, and really — once you start contemplating that sort of thing, it’s terrors all the way down. Our sense of identity is a curse. Our ability to comprehend that curse is punishment. Is it because some talking snake convinced a naked chick to eat the fruit of a vengeful jealous god? Or because the sun goddess threw a hissy fit and hunkered down in the back of a cave until she felt like coming out again? Are we walking trauma batteries, reliving childhood molestation and a desire to rub shit on the walls? Or fractured bits of someone else’s war, desperately seeking meaning in an existence we’re too blind to comprehend? The more you ask these questions, the crazier it drives you. Existence is a nightmare, is what I’m saying here. Ending existence, then, is the most merciful thing we can do. That, or creating another existence in which the flaws of this world are — unlike in the already-corrupted Digital Web — removed. In order to save this world and everything within it. And that latter goal? That’s a pipe dream — a goal to aspire to, perhaps, but not something you or I are ever likely to achieve in this or any other lifetime. It’s bullshit, really. Jack off all you like to your precious Ascension crap but it’s not gonna stop this world from spinning blood until the heat death of the universe. Till the lights go out, we suffer. We all suffer. Everything suffers. Fuck that. Let’s just call the patient dead. Someone has to make those hard calls, you know. You won’t, so we will. In a world as big and sick and painful as this one is, it takes someone “fallen” to make those calls for you. That’s what we do. We’re not babbling devil-kiddies — we’re the surgeons who determine when to pull the plug on the suffering terminal patient. What our sanctimonious rivals call “Descent” is, to us, a mercy killing. Personally, I think it’s a lot crueler to leave something living in agony than it is to end its suffering and bring on the final sleep.\n\nYou Must Make a Friend of Horror\n\nWe are the unafraid. Eaters of the Weak, Those Who Live Outside of Fear. We do, and we dare. Fear is our friend, our weapon, our transcendence and gateway to a better world. To be who we are and do what we do, you must abandon fear. Leave it at the door and lock that door behind you. From the moment someone chooses to live as we do, that person enters a new realm, faces it, and has her fear stripped from her like skin at an Assyrian court proceeding. We refuse to be afraid of life’s terrors. Instead, we make them dance with us. Folks call us “the Fallen,” like that’s some sort of moral assessment that says everything there is to know about us. Sure, right, whatever. You just keep thinking that, Sherlock. Keep on typing away on computers built by slave labor in a far-off land. Whistle to yourself as you stride past that homeless guy on the corner, pretending not to see how bad he’s hurting. Wrap yourself in virtue as you hammer away on “garbage people” online while conveniently convincing yourself that those gigs of porn on your hard drive were made by consenting sex workers, not trafficked slaves. Strap on those cool shoes made by little kids in some Taiwanese sweatshop for a buck or two a week, paid to the overseer who bought those kids from their parents or snatched ‘em off the street on the way to school. Pretend it’s not happening, O My Righteous One. Pretend you’re not a part of it. Post selfies, gobble drugs, and convince yourself that I’m the villain here. Go for it. I don’t care. Your self-deception won’t change the facts. We are the Fallen, sweetheart. All of us. Every human, every living thing. We’re fallen monsters in a broken world. But hey — just keep thinking happy thoughts about yourself. At least I’m being honest about who and what we are. People like me, we’re warriors of the Real. We pull back the curtain in your heart and let you see what’s really there. We’re honest predators, living by Creation’s laws. We might cloak our identities out of self-preservation but, unlike you, at least we’re honest with ourselves. This is our age, our world, our reality, and you know it. You babble about hope’s promise. We revel in hope’s futility. We’re right next door to you. In your mirror, your home, your heart. We are the things you won’t admit, not even to yourself. We’re the mother pimping children for a fix. The businessman who sells baby food tainted with bacteria and broken glass. We’re the cops busting heads, and the tycoons they protect. We’re anarchists and status-quo enforcers. We turn humanity against itself for fun and profit and power. We sell weapons and run prisons. We manage every government on earth. We’re the teenage grave-robber and the uncle with roving hands. We’re the advertisers who convince you to hate yourself, and the pundits who tell you to hate others. We are Division. We’re Leviathan. We’re every sin in the lexicon of Chapter One: The Awful Truth\n\n29\n\nman. We are legion, and we have already won. Our greatest weapon, you see, is that we understand the human heart. Our rivals seek to elevate it. We simply let it play. That’s what we’re all about: not “evil,” but reality. We recognize it for what it is, we strip away the illusions, and we step beyond the sheep pen where the rest of humanity — including you — choose to remain. We’re realists, sweetheart, not idealists. You can keep your “thoughts and prayers” if they make you feel better. I left those delusions behind a long time ago, and my life and our world are better off for that. Don’t be afraid. Jump. Play. Hunt. Live. Run through the ruins. Dance in the flames. Really, why would you want anything less from life? It’s not like being a good little lamb will save you from the knife. Ah, but if you grab that knife, rip it out of the farmer’s hands and slit the fucker’s throat with it, then you can escape that pen and run. People say we were exiled. I tell you, we escaped. If you’re willing, you can, too.\n\nLook for God Within The first step of this escape involves realizing that you are your own god. Not a servant of some cosmic carcinoma — and trust me, I’ll get back to that subject in a moment here — but the proverbial master of your fate and keeper of your soul. You were raised to be a sheep, but you were born to be a legend. Whichever role you choose in life is up to you. Now, you and me, we’re already ahead of the game in terms of the overall human flock. The odds are already in our favor. I know you know the basics here: Powers of a god, shaper of reality, blah blah blah — all that pretentious metaphysical horseshit they hand out to us supposedly woke… Oh, oops, I meant Awakened people. I don’t need to cover that ground again — you know it as well as I do. We’re all grownups here, so I’ll give you the respect of treating you like one. Just by being who you are, you’ve already climbed out of the hardcore monkey mass and joined a more elite company. And yes, you can embrace that word: elite. You are better than most people. You are superior. There’s no shame in that. Fuck all that equality noise — some animals really are more equal than others, and we’re those beasts. Please don’t insult either one of us by pretending to be “one of the common people.” You’re not. I’m not, either. Change, as they say, is our birthright. We make shit happen because of who we are and what we can do. Don’t ever be ashamed to be as powerful as you can be. While we’re at it, let’"
