        "text": "Big Fish Games is the first developer to win permission from Apple to offer a subscription service for its products, Bloomberg reports.\n\nThe Seattle-based developer will ultimately charge $6.99 a month for the ability to stream \"dozens\" of games through its official app. The service is for iPad only, and will initially require wi-fi to play.\n\nThere will also be a promotional period where a subscription costs $4.99, and an ad-funded free version that lets users play for 30 minutes a day.\n\n\"It took longer than usual to be approved,\" said Big Fish founder Paul Thelen. \"They needed to be convinced there's a reason to charge customers every month.\"\n\nBig Fish Games was founded in 2002, and last year booked $140 million in revenue. Thelen estimates that around 75 per cent of its players are women over the age of 30."
