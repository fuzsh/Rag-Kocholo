        "text": "Course record setters back to vie for 2016 Mumbai Marathon honours\n\nMen's and women's course record-setters, Jackson Kiprop of Uganda and Valentine Kipketar of Kenya, would be back to try and better their own three-year-old marks in the 13th edition of the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon to be held on January 17, 2016.\n\nMarathon specialist Kiprop, whose course record of 2:09:32 was set as a pacemaker in the 2013 race, would also use the event to qualify for next year's Rio Olympic Games. He had recently clocked 2:15:16 to finish overall 10th in the Beijing World Championships, a media release said on Thursday.\n\nLeading the Ethiopian brigade would be Seboka Dibaba, who came third in the Paris Marathon clocking 2:07 in April and has had podium finishes at the Sydney Marathon in 2014 and Seoul International Marathon in 2013. With a personal best time of 2.06, he is among the fastest in the field.\n\nKenyan David Kiyeng would be among the most experienced athletes in this edition of SCMM, having run 34 marathons. Having numerous titles to his credit, some of his wins include two-time Reims Marathon winner in 2008, the Joongang Seoul Marathon 2010, Daegu Marathon 2012 and runner-up in Chuncheon Marathon 2013.\n\nKiyeng's first major competition came in Prague 2006, where he finished 2nd, setting up a tone for a successful marathon career. With a personal best of 2.06.26 set at Paris Marathon, 2009, David has finished in the top 3, 17 times out of which he has won 8.\n\nCommenting on the elite line-up Race Director Hugh Jones said, \"Jackson Kiprop and Valentine Kipketer set the current course record in 2013. While Kiprop's time of 2:09:32 is all but secure, Kipketer's time of 2:24:33, on the other hand, remains untouched. There are 11 men in the field with a personal best time faster than of Kiprop's but among the women, there is no one who is faster than Kipketer. Kiprop's familiarity with the Mumbai course has helped him cope well with the difficult climatic conditions. Kipketer is full of confidence and if she still has anyone with her after 36km then she will probably have more than enough left in reserve to outrun them in the closing stages.\"\n\nThe other prominent men elite athletes from diverse nationalities are Abraham Girma, Hendrick Ramaala, Lawrence Kimaiyo, Bekana Daba, Mulugeta Wami, Cheshari, Debele, Kimutai, Seboka Negusse, Ezekial Omullo, Leting, Herpasa Negasa, Lungile Gongqa, Michael Mazibuko, Petro Mamu, Xolisa Tyali, and Joseph Ebuya.\n\nhttp://images.mid-day.com/images/2015/dec/SAFF-s.jpghttp://images.mid-day.com/images/2015/dec/31-shane-warne-insta-s.jpg\n\nThe party has properly started, only complaint is my 80's music !!!

Talking about the experience of working in the film, Kingsley, who played a world-renowned mathematician, had said in an interview, \"It's a very, very small part... It was an opportunity to work with an Indian crew again after Gandhi. I missed that. It was an opportunity to work with Mr Bachchan who is an icon in his own field. It's interesting to mix cultures in a film to see how different people from different backgrounds can be so very synchronised and work together. We worked very intensely. I keep appearing in little scenes in the film as a storyteller. We hit a very quick working rhythm.\"\n\n*The Supervillain**Nathan Jones in a still from 'Mad Max: Fury Road' (2015)*\n\nNathan Jones, the burly baddie of 'Mad Max: Fury Road' (2015), has reportedly been signed for Remo D'Souza's next.

'Superman' Routh performed an action scene with Akki and according to reports, the two actors were seen exchanging tips on fitness, action and martial arts on set.*Brandon Routh*\n\n*The other side*\n\n'Vikings' actor Clive Standen appeared in the 2007 film 'Namastey London', which had Katrina Kaif and Akshay Kumar in lead roles.*Clive Standen featured in Akshay Kumar-starrer Namastey London*\n\nThe film showed how NRIs give little value to Indian traditions and, instead, ape Westerners.

This has been the actor's only Hindi film till date.\n\n*Lights, camera, action*\n\nAkshay, who is known for performing his own stunts in films, shared screen space with Lester Speight in 'International Khiladi' (1999). Speight, who is popular for his role in 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon', played a goon in the action-thriller. The lean Akshay taking on the brawny Speight made for an interesting action sequence.\n\n*Another perspective?*\n\nToby Stephens, who has worked in films like 'Die Another Day', played a British officer in 'The Rising - Ballad of Mangal Pandey' starring Aamir Khan and Rani Mukerji in lead roles.*Aamir Khan and Toby Stephens in 'The Rising - Ballad of Mangal Pandey'*\n\nAccording to director Ketan Mehta, Stephen's role in the film was that of an \"officer with a conscience.\" After the shoot wrapped up, the actor was quoted saying, \"It was a real experience. To make a film in India, work with Indian actors and filmmakers, and to experience the culture was extraordinary. The fact it was a historical film about the British in India and what happened there was a real eye opener. I went to a public school and grew up with a sense of Empire even in the '70s and '80s, and this gave me a different perspective. The idea of us, the British, being some sort of benign, educating force suddenly seemed to be a load of rubbish. It was a company running a country. I mean how twisted was that?

The \"Dilwale\" actress said after enacting a scene from the upcoming film with Sushant, she felt they had an instant spark.\n\n*Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon. Pic/Sushant's Twitter account *\n\n\"Dinesh asked us to do a scene from the movie. We were sitting on the sofa and did it impromptu. There was something special, something you can't describe in words. There was a connect, a spark, some chemistry between me and Sushant even though that was the first time we met.\"\n\n\"So, that kind of thing coming out in the first meeting was very different and unique for all of us. The film has a beautiful script. It is something which we three are very passionate about and there is some great energy between three of us,\" Kriti told PTI.\n\nWithout divulging details about the film, the 25-year-old actress said it will present a different side of her to the audience. \"It is about love, dreams, destiny... I feel it will show a different side of me to the audience. It is different from what I have already done. I will be starting Feb end-March beginning. Sushant would be done with 'Dhoni...' by then.\"\n\n\"After that we will go into a little prep and then begin shooting. I remember the first time I met Dinesh a few months ago, it was for something else and while talking, he narrated me this script. Sushant was already involved with it. I went back home and it stayed with me for days and after some time I met Dinesh and told him that I would love to do the film.\"\n\nShe is just two-film-old and though aware of the competition around, Kriti is in no hurry to sign films. \"I consider everyone a competition. I don't keep a tab on their work but there is a good, healthy competition. Whether it is Alia, Shraddha or Parineeti everyone is doing so well. They have done so many films. Technically, I am the newest of all. Everyone is being picky and choosy,\" she said.\n\nWhile Kriti comes from a non-film background, many of her contemporaries are star kids, who enjoy backing from the industry. The actress, however, thinks the filmy association helps an actor only for the initial part of the career and beyond that it is one's hardwork that does the talking.\n\nhttp://images.mid-day.com/images/2015/dec/31-Krishna-Raj-Kapoor_s.jpg\n\n*Krishna Raj Kapoor* celebrated her birthday recently and her granddaughter, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, posted the party pictures on social media.\n\nShe captioned it, \"Grannys prebday celebration #lunching.\" The bash was attended by Neetu Kapoor, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni with her daughter Samara, Reema Jain and others.\n\nAs the Kapoor matriarch always dresses in white, several of the guests, too, turned up in the same hue.\n\nâÂÂ¤ï¸ÂÂ #faves #unconditionallove #grannysprebdaycelebration #family\n\nA photo posted by riddhimakapoorsahni (@riddhimakapoorsahni) onDec 29, 2015 at 9:47pm PST\n\n#grannysprebdaycelebration #lunching âÂÂ¤ï¸ÂÂ\n\nA photo posted by riddhimakapoorsahni (@riddhimakapoorsahni) onDec 29, 2015 at 5:51am PST\n\n#family #grannysprebdaycelebration #lunching #bua #mum #granny\n\nA photo posted by riddhimakapoorsahni (@riddhimakapoorsahni) onDec 29, 2015 at 5:50am PST\n\nhttp://images.mid-day.com/images/2015/dec/23-Rohit_s.jpg\n\nTheir were stories that the 41-year-old \"Chennai Express\" helmer and \"Haider\" star will team up soon.\n\n\"No, I am not working with Shahid.

The prosthetics took about four hours... The guy is a lookalike of someone who he loves. His story is a lot similar like mine.\n\n\"He follows the star as he feels the star is from Delhi and he can also be like his idol some day. But the story is different... To capture all that was very interesting and schizophrenic. I just hope that I have turned it out just okay,\" Shah Rukh told PTI.\n\nThe 50-year-old actor is happy that he got the opportunity to play a Delhi-based boy in the film. \"I am glad that I got the opportunity to play a Delhi boy. I used to hate it when actors, who are not from Delhi, will play Delhi guys. I used to think why I have not been given the chance to play a Delhi boy as I come from there. I am very happy now. I had forgotten the accent. It's good to recapture that.\"\n\nSRK says as far as the role of superstar Aryan Khanna is concerned, it is a milder version of his public persona. \"He is actually very quiet unlike the flamboyance you see of me coming out on my birthday and waving at thousands of people.\n\n\"I don't do the same in that film. We have never shown the star at shooting. We have never shown his flamboyance. That's very different. That's itself is very internalised because that's how perhaps I am at home, very normal and regular.\"\n\nThe teaser of the movie has already captured the attention of fans as SRK's appearance is different despite resembling him. Asked whether he is expecting to sweep all the awards Shah Rukh jokingly said, \"I am just waiting for the National award as I have decided to retire after getting one.\"\n\nhttp://images.mid-day.com/images/2015/dec/31-play-coy_s.jpg\n\n*Pulkit Samrat and Yami Gautam\n\n*\n\nThe two started seeing each other while working for Divya Khosla Kumar's upcoming film 'Sanam Re'. By the time the Simla schedule began, they had become inseparable, claim sources. The link up buzz followed with cracks in Pulkit's marriage (to longtime sweetheart Shweta Rohira, Salman Khan's rakhi sister). The wife has confirmed that she is splitting from Pulkit, but he and Yami don't seem ready yet to talk about their relationship.\n\n*Alia Bhatt and Sidharth Malhotra\n\n*\n\nWhen they debuted together in 'Student of the Year' (2012), they were just as friendly as co-stars are expected to be. But somewhere down the line, the two seemed to have gotten serious about each other. Ever since they returned from their 2015 New Year holiday, they are speculated to be a couple. The buzz reached a crescendo when they began shooting for Shakun Batra's 'Kapoor & Sons' earlier this year. A long schedule in Coonoor and Ooty apparently ignited the spark. Alia has been clicked visiting Sid's home in Bandra though the two evade being spotted together in public. When asked about their relationship, they prefer to just smile. If the grapevine is to be believed, the two are going strong.\n\n*Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover\n\n*\n\nBips took everyone by surprise when she agreed to star opposite the television actor in the horror flick, 'Alone'. During the shoot, both were going through personal upheavals — the actress had parted ways with beau Harman Baweja while Karan's marriage with actress Jennifer Winget had ended. Initially, it appeared that their love story was a publicity stunt for their film. But long after the film released, Bips and Karan continue to paint the town red with their romance. The duo is often spotted at nightclubs and have even holidayed together. The two have been posting their lovey dovey snapshots on social media, but still refuse to admit that they are a couple.2015: The Year That Was in the World of Entertainment*Bollywood's fashion report card for 2015: Winners and sinners*\n\n*2015 Recap: Bollywood 'couples' who kept rumour mills buzzing*\n\n*2015 Rewind: 8 lessons Bollywood taught us*\n\n*2015 in Pictures: Hottest on-screen Bollywood liplocks*\n\n*Bollywood's 'candid' connection: The best of 2015 in pictures*\n\n*The A to Z of 2015 Bollywood landmarks -- scoured, sifted and served*\n\n*Insta-hit in 2015!

We figure they need a little help in deciding which darlings should make the shortlist when nominations are announced on Jan. 14. With studios' campaigns entering the homestretch, The Huffington Post's movie gurus, Matthew Jacobs and Joe Satran, have some suggestions to help the Academy make the tough choices.

Russell, \"Joy\"\n\nRidley Scott, \"The Martian\"\n\nI didn't like \"Carol\" quite as much as everyone else did -- I found it frosty, even, at times, inert -- but I have to admit that it was one of most beautiful, well-acted movies of the year. Still, I hope the award goes to Miller.\n\nMatt:\n\nLenny Abrahamson, \"Room\"\n\nSean Baker, \"Tangerine\"\n\nTodd Haynes, \"Carol\"\n\nGeorge Miller, \"Mad Max: Fury Road\"\n\nRidley Scott, \"The Martian\"\n\nIt's hard to weigh the subtlety of \"Carol\" against the grandeur of, say, \"Mad Max: Fury Road,\" but each of these five directors gave us the same thing: intimate character studies wrapped in flashy but effortless cinema. As much as I'd love to include a woman on this list (Marielle Heller would be my first pick, for \"The Diary of a Teenage Girl\"), it's Hollywood's fault that the pickings were so slim.\n\nSee our full coverage of the Best Director race.BEST ACTRESSJoe:\n\nCate Blanchett, \"Carol\"\n\nBrie Larson, \"Room\"\n\nJennifer Lawrence, \"Joy\"\n\nDaisy Ridley, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\"\n\nCharlize Theron, \"Mad Max: Fury Road\"\n\nI'm obsessed, in this category, with Jennifer Lawrence, Charlize Theron and Daisy Ridley: They brought a strength and ferocity to their roles that made them into true icons. But Lawrence and Theron have both won before and Ridley hasn't even been in the conversation. Brie Larson, meanwhile, was amazing, so I have no issue with her as the frontrunner.\n\nMatt:\n\nCate Blanchett, \"Truth\"\n\nBrie Larson, \"Room\"\n\nSaoirse Ronan, \"Brooklyn\"\n\nCharlotte Rampling, \"45 Years\"\n\nLily Tomlin, \"Grandma\"\n\n\"Carol\" will be rightfully seen as the defining Cate Blanchett film of 2015, but I thought she submitted stronger work in the unfairly maligned \"Truth.\" (She was also great in \"Cinderella,\" by the way.) Still, this is Brie Larson's prize, and the rest of us are just Imperator Furiosa rounding up a bushel of ladies who defined the year in film. Others include Teyonah Paris (\"Chi-Raq\"), Bel Powley (\"The Diary of a Teenage Girl\"), Melissa McCarthy (\"Spy\") and, of course, Charlize Theron (\"Mad Max: Fury Road\").\n\nSee our full coverage of the Best Actress race.BEST ACTORJoe:\n\nMatt Damon, \"The Martian\"\n\nPaul Dano, \"Love & Mercy\"\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, \"The Revenant\"\n\nTom Hanks, \"Bridge of Spies\"\n\nSamuel L. Jackson, \"The Hateful Eight\"\n\nI'm not wild about any of these performances -- except Paul Dano's. His take on the young Brian Wilson was so uncanny that watching the 1960s parts of \"Love and Mercy\" felt like time travel. He's being campaigned as a supporting actor, while his co-star John Cusack is in contention for lead, but I think that's a mistake. I hope the Academy agrees.\n\nMatt:\n\nChristopher Abbott, \"James White\"\n\nMatt Damon, \"The Martian\"\n\nPaul Dano, \"Love & Mercy\"\n\nAndrew Garfield, \"99 Homes\"\n\nMichael B. Jordan, \"Creed\"\n\nImagine a calendar where male leads couldn't hold a candle to the year's female stars. That was 2015. Most of the A-list Oscar players -- Leonardo DiCaprio (\"The Revenant\"), Johnny Depp (\"Black Mass\"), Eddie Redmayne (\"The Danish Girl\"), Will Smith (\"Concussion\") -- turned in work that felt removed and performative. I'll echo Joe by saying that Paul Dano, in one of the year's best screen achievements, should be the lead contender to beat.\n\nSee our full coverage of the Best Actor race.BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS Joe:\n\nJoan Allen, \"Room\"\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh, \"The Hateful Eight\"\n\nRooney Mara, \"Carol\"\n\nKristen Stewart, \"Clouds of Sils Maria\"\n\nAlicia Vikander, \"Ex Machina\"\n\nI guess it's a foregone conclusion that Vogue cover girl Alicia Vikander will be nominated for \"The Danish Girl,\" but I still prefer her in \"Ex Machina.\" She captured the uncanny and seductive power of artificial intelligence as well as any actor ever has.\n\nMatt:\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh, \"The Hateful Eight\"\n\nRooney Mara, \"Carol\"\n\nCynthia Nixon, \"James White\"\n\nKristen Stewart, \"Clouds of Sils Maria\"\n\nKristen Wiig, \"The Diary of a Teenage Girl\"\n\nThis category is loaded, and it's a shame to omit Alicia Vikander (\"The Danish Girl\"), Elizabeth Banks (\"Love & Mercy\"), Tessa Thompson (\"Creed\"), Mya Taylor (\"Tangerine\") and a host of others. But the supporting-actress hardware begins and ends with Rooney Mara, even if she's arguably a co-lead in \"Carol.\"\n\nSee our full coverage of the Best Supporting Actress race.BEST SUPPORTING ACTORJoe:\n\nWalton Goggins, \"The Hateful Eight\"\n\nOscar Isaac, \"Ex Machina\"\n\nMichael Keaton, \"Spotlight\"\n\nMark Rylance, \"Bridge of Spies\"\n\nJacob Tremblay, \"Room\"\n\nWalton Goggins completely blew me away in \"The Hateful Eight.\" There was something unhinged and committed about his performance as a Confederate sympathizer that made him seem alive in a way that few Quentin Tarantino characters do.\n\nMatt:\n\nJoel Edgerton, \"Black Mass\"\n\nIdris Elba, \"Beasts of No Nation\"\n\nJason Mitchell, \"Straight Outta Compton\"\n\nMark Rylance, \"Bridge of Spies\"\n\nJason Segel, \"The End of the Tour\"\n\nIf Johnny Depp and Tom Hanks were forgettable in \"Black Mass\" and \"Bridge of Spies,\" respectively, their supporting counterparts certainly were not. Hats off to Joel Edgerton and Mark Rylance for besting their upperclass screen partners. Really, any of these five men deserve this accolade.\n\nSee our full coverage of the Best Supporting Actor race.BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAYJoe:\n\nPete Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, \"Inside Out\"\n\nAlex Garland, \"Ex Machina\"\n\nTom McCarthy and Josh Singer, \"Spotlight\"\n\nDavid O. Russell, \"Joy\"\n\nQuentin Tarantino, \"The Hateful Eight\"\n\nI think everyone is wrong about \"Joy.\" People say that its plot was confused, bizarre and implausible -- but my take is that David O. Russell was intentionally playing with our expectations about how a plot should work. Indeed, I think the whole movie was a brilliant commentary on the art of screenwriting. There's not enough room to explain why here, but I might revisit the topic in an essay soon.\n\nMatt:\n\nSean Baker and Chris Bergoch, \"Tangerine\"\n\nPatrick Brice, \"The Overnight\"\n\nPete Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, \"Inside Out\"\n\nAlex Garland, \"Ex Machina\"\n\nTom McCarthy and Josh Singer, \"Spotlight\"\n\n\"Spotlight\" accomplished so much with so few flourishes, but I maintain that \"The Overnight\" is the year's most under-appreciated comedic script. Regardless, this victory belongs to the \"Inside Out\" scribes. Imagine conceptualizing something half as eye-opening and original as that Pixar gem.BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAYJoe:\n\nJ.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\"\n\nEmma Donoghue, \"Room\"\n\nDrew Goddard, \"The Martian\"\n\nNick Hornby, \"Brooklyn\"\n\nAdam McKay and Charles Randolph, \"The Big Short\"\n\nIt initially seemed strange to me that \"The Force Awakens\" was competing in this category, but then I saw the genius of it: If you think about it as an adaptation of \"A New Hope,\" it's a near-perfect script.\n\nMatt:\n\nDrew Goddard, \"The Martian\"\n\nMarielle Heller, \"The Diary of a Teenage Girl\"\n\nNick Hornby, \"Brooklyn\"\n\nAdam McKay and Charles Randolph, \"The Big Short\"\n\nPhyllis Nagy, \"Carol\"\n\nEach of these movies faced challenges in their source material, whether too esoteric (\"The Big Short,\"\"The Martian\") or too intimate (\"Carol,\" the also deserving \"Room\" and \"45 Years\"). They all overcame it, but it was Nick Hornby who penned the year's most graceful adaptation: \"Brooklyn\" is cinematic storytelling at its smoothest.\n\n*Also on HuffPost:*\n\n-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Raman was not wearing a helmet when Mohammedan’s Mehrab Hossain’s shot struck him on the temple and rebounded to wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud. Raman walked off the field never to return to play his much-loved sport.*Wedding Day: Raman and Kim on Sept 7, 1990.

Pic/Kim Lamba.*\n\n*Excerpts:*\n\n*Each of Raman’s death anniversaries must evoke sad memories. How do you see the bright side?*\n\nThe only way to deal with something like this is to believe that Raman had completed the duration of his magnificent and very full life, and be so thankful that for 10 years I was blessed to be part of it resulting in our two wonderful children Jasmyn and Kamran.\n\n*Have you truly got over this tragedy?*\n\nThat is not a possibility. The scars are too deep and the vacuum is too vast.*1986: Raman Lamba attacks Australia’s Bruce Reid. Pic/MiD DAY Archives.*\n\n*How did you get the news of his injury that day in 1998?*\n\nI was preparing to go to the airport to pick him up from his flight when I received a very frantic call from Bangladesh delivering news that no one would ever want to hear. The living nightmare began.\n\n*Do you often think… what if Raman had worn a helmet?*\n\nI tried my best from the beginning not to go down the road of the ‘what ifs’. After overthinking for hours on end every day in my anxious state, I persuaded myself it was futile to look for answers. I knew there were none. Because I had to focus on our little ones — Jasmyn then aged five and Kamran then aged three, I had to find a way to be able to function in the hell I had been catapulted into. So I turned to working really hard, bringing up our two children the best that I could. Meditation calmed all the ‘what ifs’ in my mind and became an addictive habit of mine for years.\n\n*How did you meet Raman?*\n\nCompletely by chance. Our eyes met across a crowded room and he came straight over to talk to me. We were together since that first meeting.\n\n*Was it love at first sight?*\n\nIt was. He said he immediately knew he had met his future wife.*ONE-DAY WONDER: A delighted Raman Lamba receives the man-of-the-series trophy against Australia at Rajkot in 1986-87. PIC/MiD DAY ARCHIVES*\n\n*Sunil Gavaskar reacted to Raman’s death by saying, ‘someone who loved life so much was deprived of it.’ Can you give me an example of Raman’s zest for life?*\n\nI can vouch for that. Raman lived life to the max. He felt very blessed with his life and prayed every day. He was so thankful to God to be able to play his cricket and to have and enjoy his family. He was such a romantic and a brilliant family man. He completely adored his Punjabi Tiger Kamran and his Princess Jasmyn. He always smiled when he woke up and always said, ‘smile at the day and the day will smile back.’ Even when he had worries, he believed in positivity and faith. He was a force. He exercised everyday without fail, didn’t smoke or drink, never abused his consumption of food, watched his diet. He planned on having a very long, full and healthy life.\n\n*Did Raman ever complain to you that he deserved to play more than four Tests and 32 one-day internationals for India?*\n\nIn all honesty, it saddened me that he did feel slighted and overlooked at times especially as he worked so hard. He never complained or whined ‘poor me’, but he did talk about the injustices when asked.\n\nSome used to say he was outspoken and this cost him dearly. To that I say, Raman could have said a lot more, but he often refrained. He always measured his words and actually some ‘got off’ very lightly indeed. Despite the politics that cocooned cricket, he never lost faith. He maintained his dignity and he just kept going, always giving his cricket his 100 per cent and ever hungry for new opportunities.\n\n*Why did you decide to stay in Portugal?*\n\nFour years after Raman’s passing, I was still not doing well. My life was still so empty without Raman and I was living solely for my children and my work. I started to consider a life outside of Ireland and India in the hope that I could breathe again. I had the opportunity to work in a newspaper for one year in Madeira.\n\nSo we all embarked upon this new adventure with great enthusiasm. Within months Jasmyn and Kamran were fluent in Portuguese and adored their new life and surroundings. I also enjoyed the change of scenery and lifestyle very much during that first year, so it seemed a great idea to stay. We three have happily been together here ever since and visit India and Ireland periodically. Jasmyn is working with me in the family business and Kamran is studying at University.\n\n*What is your profession?*\n\nI am the director of my business: BOOK-it-HERE! It’s an adventure sports and leisure activities reservations office.\n\n*What’s the one thing you have in your house which perpetuates the memory of Raman?*\n\nHis favourite cricket ball sleeps under the mattress of my bed and I always carry with me — in my purse — the last rupee coin he handled. This has private significance to us both and these are just two little things that make me feel well.\n\n*Have you preserved any of his equipment?*\n\nI donated some items to some less financially fortunate young, aspiring cricketers and my father keeps everything that remains private and in great order.\n\n*How should India remember Raman Lamba?*\n\nFor everything that he was. He was a unique force — a wonderful example and inspiration to every aspiring cricketer — a great ambassador and credit to the game. An absolute credit to India.For the recordRaman Lamba, who died at the age of 38, played four Tests and 32 one-day internationals. The highlight of his international career was a man-of-the-series ODI performance against Allan Border's Australians in 1986. He scored a 120-ball 102 in the last game at Rajkot. The hundred ended up in vain, but India clinched the series 3-2.\n\nhttp://images.mid-day.com/images/2016/jan/02trouble-s.jpg\n\n*Sundar Raman. Pic/Getty Images*\n\nRaman has drawn the worst flak in the report for his activities in the 2012 Indian Premier League (IPL) and could be banned for life from holding any post in a sporting body.\n\n*Also Read: Sundar Raman - The rise and fall of IPL's former COO*\n\nThe Lodha Committee, which probed Raman who had been associated with the IPL since its inception with both Lalit Modi and N Srinivasan, found him guilty on several counts. Similar charges have been pressed by the Committee against a number of BCCI officials who, the Committee found, worked closely with Raman.\n\n“Details of Raman’s involvement with the BCCI officials could set the cat among pigeons in the board,” sources said. Raman’s future in the IPL was in question ever since Shashank Manohar was elected as the BCCI president last year.\n\n*Bookie issue*\n\nRaman was named as Individual 12 in the Mudgal report, which said the IPL CEO “knew a contact of a bookie and had contacted him eight times in one season”. In his defence, Raman “admitted” to the Mudgal panel that he “knew” a contact of the bookie, but was “unaware of his connection with betting activities”. The report stated Raman “also accepted” that he had received information about “individual 1 and individual 11 (that is, Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra) taking part in betting”. He said he was further “informed” by the ICC-ACSU chief that this was not actionable information. Raman accepted that this information that he received about two team officials being reportedly involved in betting “was not conveyed to any other individual” by him. Highly placed sources, who had a glimpse of the report, said the former CJI, RM Lodha had made it clear that any BCCI official, against whom any case was on in a court of law, should not be allowed to hold any position in the board.\n\nIf that turns out to be true, then it would be difficult for the current BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur to retain his position because of the legalities involved in his case relating to the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association ground and charges of financial irregularities. Thakur, a top BJP leader, has brushed aside the charges as “Congress vendetta”.\n\n*Not only Thakur*\n\nNot just Thakur, sources said there were a number of BCCI officials who were involved in litigation in various cases of financial irregularities. Those officials could be asked to drop their files and designation and resign.\n\nSources further said the Lodha Committee has suggested sweeping changes in the way various officials are offered highly paid jobs in the board “without any clear cut directions and guidance”.\n\nThe Committee, claimed the sources, severely castigated the BCCI for handing out associate and permanent membership to various cricket associations in the country in an arbitrary manner, and favouring some of the cricket associations, while ignoring others.\n\nhttp://images.mid-day.com/images/2016/jan/1-ronaldo-cristiano-s.jpg\n\n*Cristiano Ronaldo*\n\nIn an interview with LatAm magazine El Papel, which is to be published on Sunday, Ronaldo said, \"We cannot live being obsessed with what other people think about us.

Pic/ AFP*\n\n“With 43 Australians diagnosed with breast cancer every day there is critical and continuing need for more McGrath Breast Care Nurses to support families through breast cancer,\" McGrath said.\n\n“This year we’ve set our Pink Test fundraising goal at $380,000, which will fund one new McGrath Breast Care Nurse for three years.”\n\nBeginning January 3, the Pink Test has become an iconic event, in particular Day 3 of the Test that has come to be known as Jane McGrath Day. On that day the entire crowd turns pink to support the McGrath Foundation and raise funds to place McGrath Breast Care Nurses in communities all over Australia.\n\nCricket Australia chief executive officer James Sutherland said: “We're incredibly proud to be supporting the McGrath Foundation, with the Pink Test in Sydney now truly one of the great occasions on the Australian sporting calendar.\"\n\n“Every year we're amazed by the overwhelming support the Pink Test generates for the Foundation and its important work. From the two competing teams to the thousands of fans who bathe the SCG in pink, it demonstrates the positive difference sport can make to society,\" he said.\n\n“Thanks to the cricket community, the Test has raised more than $5 million, helping the McGrath Foundation place 110 breast care nurses across Australia and demonstrating cricket’s ability to galvanise public support behind an important cause,” Sutherland added.\n\nResearch from the McGrath Foundation shows that in 2016 there will be a shortfall of 85 breast care nurses across the country and this figure will grow by 28 percent by 2020.\n\nhttp://images.mid-day.com/images/2016/jan/saina1jan-s.jpg\n\nThe League, revived after a gap of two years following a successful inaugural Indian Badminton League in 2013, has brought in the fresh idea in which each of the competing teams will nominate one match in each tie as their Trump Card.*Saina Nehwal. Pic/ AFP*\n\nA victory by the team that picked the particular game as its Trump will provide it with one extra point but a defeat will set it back by one point, and the intrigue generated by\n\nthis new concept would keep the ties alive till the end, according to national coach Pullela Gopichand.\n\n\"It's a great addition to the league to ensure that the excitement remains till the end of the tie. Two teams can nominate the same match as Trump match. This ensures that the last two matches are also important in a tie,\" said Gopichand here in the run-up to the League opener.\n\n\"Even a 3-0 lead is not sufficient to win as you still can lose the tie. Spectators' interest will be kept alive. It needs to be seen how the players react to the extra pressure. Some play better under pressure and some others crack,\" he said.\n\nWorld no. 2 Saina, who commanded USD 100,000 at the auction, would be leading Awadhe Warriors' challenge against Mumbai Rockets who appear strong in men's singles with two top men shuttlers of the country - H S Prannoy and R M V Gurusaidutt - leading their charge.\n\nThe host outfit has a strong men's doubles players in Denmark's Mathias Boe and Russia's Vladimir Ivanov. World no. 20, Prannoy, has already sounded upbeat about his team's chances.\n\n\"Over the last two years I have been playing really well, along with Gurusaidutt. We both are in good form. We are a pretty balanced outfit. We have really good doubles players too,\" said the 23-year-old, who hails from Kerala, here ahead of the tournament opener.\n\nThe Warriors would look up in the main to Sai Praneeth, Sourabh Verma and Tanomgsak Saensomboonsuk of Thailand in men's singles, apart from the undoubted skills and fighting spirit of London Olympics bronze medallist and World Championship silver medallist Saina.\n\nThe opening tie will be followed on January 3 by clashes between Hyderabad Hunters and Bengaluru Top Guns, to be followed by the evening encounter between the Rockets and Chennai Smashers.\n\nTop Guns have roped in a pretty strong men's singles players in Kidambi Srikanth, India's highest ranked player in the world (no. 9), Anand Pawar and Sameer Verma - who recently won the men's singles crown at the Tata Open Indian Challenge.\n\nThe Malaysian men's doubles combination of Kim Wah Lim and Thien How Hoon, ranked 32nd, adds meat to the squad's overall strength along with India's women's doubles specialist Ashwini Ponn"
