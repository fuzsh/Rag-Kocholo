        "text": "Contemporary living is inseparable from digital technologies. Design researchers and practitioners have shown an increasing interest in predicting and examining the effect of these technologies in transforming our everyday life and surroundings, notably in William J. Mitchell's epic trilogy: City of Bits [1], e-topia [2] and Me++ [3]. Built environments as an essential part of our holistic living environment have played an important role in this revolutionary process. Although digital technologies have shown great potentials in innovating many areas of the AEC (architecture-engineering-construction) industry, their roles in built environment design are yet to be fully understood. Rather than seeing the future of built environments as a more confusing array of computers and cables, this paper presents three different uses of the emerging digital technologies in designing \"media place\", \"augmented reality place\" and \"curious responsive place\" for built environments, where the boundaries and our interactions with the physical and the digital worlds are blurred. The emerging digital technologies as new place making elements illuminate interesting opportunities for innovative designs and ideas in built environments. For designers, they suggest exciting new languages and resources for exploring alternative place designs. The positive changes of these new places will further influence the way people communicate, interact and collaborate. The paper concludes with a summary on the characteristics of these three types of new place designs.\n\nThis paper tries to articulate how the concept of design instantiations can contribute to the field of design as research. Starting out from making, with a focus on design doing, and the concept of pro-searching, with a focus on future change, the text elaborates the meaning of design instantiations. The domain of design is tangible interaction and ubiquitous computing, which is described as interplay between physical artefacts, digital media, social enactment and computation, and interaction design is understood as a task of understanding and transforming places. Relating design to natural science suggests that a design discourse is needed, but that it differs from those of natural sciences, and thus must have a different agenda. The dissemination of design instantiations can be expressed in the forms of different interventions. Design is the art of the possible future. The very nature of change is in many aspects in contrast to that of recognition of the already existing and this ...\n\nThe terms 'Performative' and 'Performance' are more and more emerging in the spatial design discourses, from exhibition, to interior, arriving to urban design. These notions are not clearly defined yet. They are characterized by a semantic width and multiple applicative possibilities. Between the different interpretations and uses of 'performance' and 'performative' in architectural discourses, this paper will focus on two main dimensions of a particular importance: The first refers to the concepts of the scenic, the narrative, and the theatrical qualities in architecture. The second relates to the 'event-character' of spatial interventions, and the relation between event, and soft intervention, which tackles the concept of the 'transformative power of the performative', which indicates to the capacity of architecture to activate spaces and processes. Exhibitions, pavilions and installations are all concerned with changing the performance of the existing space, and therefore they are able to illustrate what a 'performative-oriented architecture' could be or mean. The Italian architect and thinker Andrea Branzi, in his essay \"L'Allestimento come metafora di una nuova modernit√†\" (exhibitions as a metaphor of a new modernity) (Lotus, n.115, December 2002), invites architecture to learn from the sub-categories of architecture. Architecture can learn from the practice of exhibition (displaying and installing). Architecture is invited to learn design approaches and strategies from performance-oriented spatial disciplines such as exhibition design, scenography, art-installations, and events, with a particular focus-in this paper-on: 1) Soft interventions and the transformative power of the event-intervention, 2) The aesthetic of experiencing and the narrative approach. Therefore, it is in the sub-disciplines of architecture that we can 'rehearse' a 'performative understanding' of the spatial project, in the sense of studying and designing spaces basing on performative criteria, and performance perspectives. The repertoire of the performative is large; it includes the concepts of the flexible, the event, the transformative, the theatrical, the narrative, etc. The aim of this paper is to explore and rehearse this kind of performative analytical tool for the architectural project (taking the case of Nevicata14, a project of refurbishment of the pedestrian Piazza Castello in Milan, 2015). A performative understanding of architecture is proposed as an alternative to a general theory, and as a new dramaturgy to analyse and design spaces.\n\nDermott McMeel's research is primarily conducted within the discipline of architecture. However, there is increasing interaction between architecture, robotics, information sciences and art. With an interest in the social, collaborative, experiential and philosophical implications of digital media, he seeks to advance the discussion on the influence of technology in both the design/making process and in occupying the built environment. His current research has a focus on locative media and the effect of GPS and mobile phones on the 'craft' of design and construction, in both commercial Abstract. This paper investigates inter-disciplinary research through an urban design project and explores the creation of broader architectural representations of place. It advances the position advocated by McCarthy and Wright, who make the case for developing deeper associations between experience and technology. Artist Janet Cardiff creates rich media representations of space that invite interpretation, design students were challenged to represent richer descriptions of place that include factors such as temporal and spatial resistance; experiential laminations; social linkages and their gaps. Findings support design and trans-disciplinarity as a potentially compelling modality for research in these complex contexts, it resists bringing technology to centre stage and advances propositions that recommend looking beyond the functional and attending to personal and social facets of our interaction with technology.\n\nMemoires by eminently creative people often describe architectural spaces and qualities they believe instrumental for their creativity. However, places designed to encourage creativity have had mixed results, with some found to decrease creative productivity for users. This may be due, in part, to lack of suitable empirical theory or model to guide design strategies. Relationships between creative cognition and features of the physical environment remain largely uninvestigated in the scientific literature, despite general agreement among researchers that human cognition is physically and socially situated. This paper investigates what role architectural settings may play in creative processes by examining documented first person and biographical accounts of creativity with respect to three central theories of situated cognition. First, the embodied thesis argues that cognition encompasses both the mind and the body. Second, the embedded thesis maintains that people exploit features of the physical and social environment to increase their cognitive capabilities. Third, the enaction thesis describes cognition as dependent upon a person‚Äôs interactions with the world. Common themes inform three propositions, illustrated in a new theoretical framework describing relationships between people and their architectural settings with respect to different cognitive processes of creativity. The framework is intended as a starting point toward an ecological model of creativity, which may be used to guide future creative process research and architectural design strategies to support user creative productivity.\n\nThe concept of ‚Äòplace-making‚Äô emerged in media studies in 2015, but to date, there has been little theoretical engagement with the term. The primary research question this scoping review answers is how is ‚Äòplace-making‚Äô defined across disciplines and which methodologies have been applied to creative and digital projects? A bibliometric analysis of 1974 publications from Web of Science (published in the last 30 years) were analysed to (1) define ‚Äòplace-making‚Äô across disciplines, (2) model common themes in scholarship, (3) identify the methodologies used and (4) understand the impacts on citizens. The results show that ‚Äòplace-making‚Äô first appeared in geography/urban studies in 1960s, was then adopted as ‚Äòcreative placemaking‚Äô in the creative industries, and in the past 5 years (since 2015), it has appeared as ‚Äòdigital placemaking‚Äô in media studies. It also highlighted areas (i.e. gaps) for future research into ‚Äòcreative placemaking‚Äô and ‚Äòdigital place-making‚Äô practices for cultural ...\n\nThis paper will present grassroots urban creative placemaking as a co-produced and performative artform. It will conceptualise this activity as the logical extension of urban arts practice, from public/new genre public art (Lacy 2008) and participatory arts to a ‚Äònew situationism‚Äô (Doherty 2004). This is a polylogic performative artform with space/place the non-human actant (Whybrow 2011, Kwon 2004) to the human ones of creative process and urban creatives. It will position participatory art as lacking a meaningful collaborative ethos and practice, and a co-produced one as a new paradigm of art practice of social relatedness (Gablik 1991, Miles 1997) and place this practice within a placemaking taxonomy (Legge 2013 and authors working paper). The paper will problematize the notion of urban arts practice and the formal arts sector as a critical spatial practice (Rendell 2006, Petrescu 2006) and will extend geographers critical thinking on the co-production of art as constructive of new spatial configurations and emergent relations between users and space, impacting public life (Meejin Yoon 2009), whereby locating it in the socio-political of urban life, this practice has to be understood as an art form that dematerialises the art object and is concerned with creative and social processes and outcomes. It will present research findings of fieldwork case studies that work in the public realm and aside from the formal galleries/museums sector, in a community co-produced context. Specifically, Art Tunnel Smithfield, Dublin; W Rockland Street, Philadelphia; and in the UK, Homebaked, and Greyworld.\n\nThis article discusses the importance of perception of spaces, and involvement with spaces during the design process. Over the last decade, mapping the relationship of architectural spaces to human experience has become popular as a successful design methodology. The beginning phase of the design process is characterized by perceptual integrity; unfortunately, this integrity often fades away or is even eliminated once the spaces become real and occupied. The availability of advanced visual representation techniques has created a realistic clarity of visual experience in space. However, emphasis on the visual has resulted in the possibility that other sensory modalities will be ignored. The goal of the craft of architecture as a profession is to create experiential qualities. If well designed, an architectural space can effectively shape experiences and evoke feelings. This paper focuses on design processes and outlines a series of phenomenological arguments that arise in contemporar..."
