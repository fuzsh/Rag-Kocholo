Some 200 miles north of the Arkansas River, the South Platte — flowing a mile wide but slowing down — crept into Nebraska near Big Springs, scene of a recent bank robbery and triple killing. Elsewhere, with danger past, cleanup operations moved for- ward. Denver, where the cloudburst- fed South Platte swept out of the foothills Wednesday night, had 1,000 men on the job — many of them clearing debris threat- ening the 11 of 24 bridges still standing. The city also swung into action as the hub of relief efforts for communities down- stream. Thousands of persons were driven Jrom their homes in western Kansas, even before the Arkansas crest arrived, with 300 evacuated at Garden City alone. Police Chief Greno Gigante said almost all residents of Springer, N.M., who were root- ed .from their homes are back and \"there is just a lot of mud and filth to clean up.\" Similar conditions existed at Raton, Cimarron and Maxwell, N.M. Wyoming escaped much dam- age it otherwise would have suf- fered, U.S. reclamation officials said, because big storage reser- voirs at Guernsey and Glendo stopped the flood waters.

The plane, identified by expo- sition officials as a Fint 19, skid- ded along the ground and smashed into the parked vehi- cles. A newsman on the scene re- ported six people in one small sedan wefe^ Tsctreffdcd \"when the plane crashed into their car. Authorities said the pilot of the plane was Capl. Italo Do- nati. They said he tried to eject from the plane as it plummeted toward the ground over the parking area but was killed in the attempt. Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and. the U.S. Gemini space twins, Edward H. White U and James A. McDivitt, had left the field a short time be- fore the crash. It was the second disastcg during the air show.

Most tanks which moved into position before dawn had been withdrawn, although a few stood sentry eutside some buildings. Troops armed with submachine guns patrolled the streets. There was no official informa- tion as to Ben Bella's wherea- bouts, b(jt rumor had It that he is being held in nn army bar- racks somewhere in the city. There was no indication what direction the new regime would take. Ben Bella maintained close ties with both the Soviet Union and Red China in a leftist government that never got off the ground. Boumedienne, 40, was said by the French to have received military training in Moscow and Peking. French officials with inside knowledge say he defi- nitely is not pro-Chinese, but is first an Arab nationalist who wants to see socialism work in Algier. Apparently, Boumedienne's patience with Ben Bella, 48, was exhausted by the president's \"government by wftim,\" as Ra- dio Algiers put It. The two had been close associates since \\954 tho first year of the Algieran rebellion against France. First outward signs of the coup occurred just as dawn broke over the port city.

Antonio Imbert Barrera chief of the civilian-military junta, and Hector Aristy, minis ter to the presidency in the reb- el regime, told newsmen, how ever, that some details of the OAS proposal were vague and perhaps objectionable. Both factions said the three page OAS document would have to be studied before formal re plies are made, probably on Monday or Tuesday. The three-man OAS mediating team, which announced the peace formula Friday, met with Catholic Church leaders, politi- cians and bu-sincssmeri~*in an effort to generalo wklc public support for the formula. OAS sources said an OAS rcp>- resentative might go to Puerto Rico to see ex-President Juan Bosch and solicit his endorse- ment of the OAS solution. It calls for elections in six to nine months. A provisional govern- ment would rule until then. \"This is still a personal view because we haven't discussed the OAS formula in detail yet,\" Aristy told newsmen. \"But we consider that it opens the way to negotiations. It is so vague how- ever that wo might have to ask the OAS comnimee for some clarification.\" The nati on's three Rornan Catholic bishops met with the OAS mediating team Friday night and expressed approval of chairman of the conference, cs timated that close to 500 per- , the peace formula, according to sons attended the three-day af-|llmar Penna Marinho of Brazil fair, which ctilminated Saturday , a member of the OAS commit night with a banquet.

Shortly before noon rumors that Ben Bella had been over thrown were confirmed by the revolutionary council's state- ment. Ben Bella, former French army sergeant and one of the heros of Algeria's seven-year rebellion against France, was in disgrace. • The council said Ben Bella frittered away the country's economy in government by per- sonal whim. It charged him with being a charlatan, «dven turlst, oppressing the people, a man who had committed high treason and of ruling by menace and blackmail. The council's statement Indi- cated that the final blow Was Ben Bella's activity concerning the African-Asian summit con fcrence scheduled to open in Algiers June 29. The statement charged that Ben Bella had planned to profit perionally by -the conference and \"not to reaffirm our com- mon ideals of solidarity, liberty and peace, but to, extend his personal power.\" Salmon Tract 4-H Clu>Meets Salmon Tract 44f Club met Friday at the home of Mrs. He- l>er Loughmiller.

India, that apostle of non , violence, continues to make f noises indicating a shift of its pleaders to the position tlwt the country of Gandhi and Nehru must turn to nuclear arms for self-defense. Indian diplomats here fear that unless there is an early settlement of the Viet Nam war, the Cold War will heat..up and Red China will renew its aggres- sive designs on their country. They say the Soviet Unimi^cannot be expected -to cooperate with the tjnited States \"to keep the peace if the Viet Nam conflict is escalated. What India originally wanted was the estab- lishment of a system within the United Nations which would guarantee the have-not countries against aggression by the nuclear powers. But lately its spokesmen al.^o have been demanding a tighter test-ban treaty, a substantial cut in all nuclear fajfces' and a freeze on the production of both nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. hospitals in California serve to emphasize the caliber of Magic Valley Memorial. The so-called Medicare bill has spurred California hospitals into a rush program of improvement and modernization in anticipation of a big increase in patients. There should be no similar flurry of ac- tivity here^ although Magic Valley Me- morial has been involved in a remodeling project in recent weeks. The project is adding the very-ljest ond latest X-ray equipment. It's all renewed evidence that the ad- ministration and board of Magic Valley Memorial hospital intend to maintain the Memorial Hospital inten dto maintain the tion and high standards will assure con- tinued accreditation for the hospital. ANOTHER CASUALTY ■ •^gonhammer Spring, located along U.S. Highway 93 near North Fork, is an- other casualty of civilization. It's con- taminated and the public has been warned it's not safe to use the water without boiling it first. The news will be something of a blow to those who have made- it a point of stopping at Wagon- hammer Spring down through the years. The wide spot in the road has historical significance, in addition to being a mighty fine place to stop for a short rest from driving or even to spend the night. In addition, residents of the area make heavy tise of a small park maintained in conjunction with the spring. Everyone has drunk from Wagonhammer Spring for years without fear of contamination because the free-flowing water looks so pure and sparkling and tastes that way, too. It's just more evidence that- those who take advantage of Idaho's ample facilities for outdoor recreation must be more aad more suspicious of drinking water. Spar kling appearances mean nothing any- more. Water that's readily accessible to the public in pi aces like Wagonhammer Spring is tested constantly by the Idaho Department of Health. But everyone; should keep in mind that It's virtually impossible to test every possible source of water, particularly the thousands of springs and streams away from main traveled thoroughfares. It's possible for any spring to be contaminated these days. efficient nuclear power programi and the ex- perts say it could develop a bomb within two years. To counter Indian impatience, Washington is now encouraging various neutral countries to sponsor a UN proposal — probably at the next General A ssembly session next fall-pledging all UN members to i iuine l u the aid o f any non - nuclear country threatened with nuclear war. Such anngreement, it Is felt, would calm the fears of those nations which now feel defense- i less without their own nuclear arsenals. | For obvious reasons, the U.S. is not about to sponsor the proposal itself; it would be suspect in certain non-aligned quarters. But if it came from some of the smaller nations, it Would have the. automatic support of a big U.N. bloc. India, for example, would b« almost certain to go along. e • a VS. AID PROMISED BY LBJ — For all the Indian government's wishy-washy tendencies, no one doubts its reluctance to join the nuclear arnis race. Of all the emerging nations, India is most sincere about spending all its brains and energy on programs to benefit its poverty- stricken people. There would be overtones of a Greek tragedy in an India suddenly forced to shake an atomic bomb at its neighbors. But the Indians are worried not only about China but Pakistan, especially since Pakistan started romancing Peking. In a vague kind of way, the United States is already on the record as supporting a treaty to protect the nuclear have-nots. After the first Red Chinese nuclear explosion. President Johnson promised the U.S. would go to the aid of countries threatened with nuclear aggression. Some critics are urging that Johnson spell out that promise in detail, but that is not Johnson's way. He wants this to be a cooperative business, and he feels it is much better politics to let other countries dot the I's and cross the t's so they'll have ■ vested Interest in it. ~' ^ i'iPi\"ii:. Views of Others NOT SO MIGHTY For generations, Mt. Everest was re- garded with awe as the highest peak in the world and It defied all efforts of moun- tain climbers. Then in 1953, Edmund Hil- lary and Tenzing Norkey reached the summit of the mighty peak. Since then, Mt. Everest has been climbed several -more times; but not enough to-pooh-pooh tHb feat. Whenever someone struggles to the top of the 29.028-foot peak. It's still enough of an accomplishment to rate stories in newspapers around the world But the day may arrive In the near future when climbing Mt. Everest will be reduced to an almost rountine accom- plishment. An Indian mountaineering expedition has taken a big step in that direction. Recently, the Indians reached the summit of Mt. Everest four times in nine days. That's far and away the heav- SH-H-H! In trying to keep its readers up to date on developments in aeronautics the McGraw-Hill publication Aviation Week and Space Tech- nology sometimes must tap strange sources of information. Take the matter of the unmanned reconnais- sance aircraft the United States has been send- ing lo make photographs of Communist China. The PentaRon won't admit it is doing any such thing, much less give any details of the drone planes it is using. Us silence appears based on the head-ln-the-sand theory that if it says noth ing, nobody will know anything. But in a recent issue. AW and ST printed a photograph borrowed from a Japanese news- reel which showed one of three such drones shot down over Red China and put on display at the Cliinese People's Revolution Museum ir Peking. The plane in the picture is virtually in- tact, and the magazine says it appears to be an advanced version of the Fircbee jet-powered t.nrget nircrnft built by the Ryan Aeronautical Co. of San Diego. Changes noted from the stand- ard BQM-34 Firebee Include a longer wingspan a high-lift wing .lection, and possibly a length- ened fuselage, although AW and ST's experts couldn't be sure of this, since the crash appar ently broke the fuselage in a couple of places. It appears the net effect of the Pentagon's silence has been to keep the American people in the dark about what their government is up to, while the communist people know all about it. As for the length of that fu.sriage. if the Pentagon still won't let the.

The result is confusion about what is being done or should be done. It happened to President Harry S. Truman with Korea; it's happening now to President Johnson with \"Viet Nam. In both cases the presidents sought discussions but the prob- lem in Korea and in Viet Nam was and is how to persuade the enemy to agree to such talks. Just proposing wasn't and isn't enough. The task for both men was how to hit the enemy hard enough to convince him it's wiser to talk peace without hitting so hard that the United States finds itself in a huge land war in Asia. Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur for wanting to ex- tend the war in Korea to Red China whose •\"volunteers\" were the main foe in Korea. Now there is fear if the Vietnamese war is broadened loo much Red China will come in. Before this country was In the Korean war six months — Tru- man sent the troops in and they became part of a United Na- tions operation uncjer American leadership — Sen. Robert A. Taft, Republican leader from Ohio, was on Truman's back. He accused the president bf violating the Constitutioin by not getting advance congressional approval for use of troops and he suggested the United States pull Kjut of Europe. There is less ground for this complaint against Johnson for using troops in South Viet Nam and bombing North Viet Nam he'd manage to stumble over because Congress last August something even If there wasn't gave him a go-ahead to do what anything In the .same room with he thought necessary. But Taft. who wanted to pull out of Korea, later backed Mac- Arthur and wanted to use U.S. him.\" GENTLEMAN IN THE FOURTH ROW Religion In America By LOUIS CASSELS United Press International Martin Ruber, the greatest Jewish philosopher of modern time, died in Jerusalem last planes and warships against Red China. Another Republican leader. Sen. Styles Bridges of New Hampshire, called the Truman policy in Korea an \"immoral course of kill, kill, kill and hope somebody will be willing to negotiate.\" But then Truman got drowned In more criticism than ever for dismissing MacArthur, whose attitude was a lot more bellig- erent than Truman's. In the end. North Korea agreed to an armistice. In Viet Nam, Johnson has sought to induce the North Viet- namese Reds 16 negotiate a set- lloment. To persuade them, he has been bombing them since February but they have ignored him and in South Viet Nam the Viet Cong is fighting harder than ever. By a twist in politics most of the congressional criticism of Johnson comes from inside the ranks of his own Democrats. The Republicans so. far have been supporting him although there are signs this may change. Sen. Wayne Morse of Oregon, one-time Republican who be- came a Democrat and friend of Johnson when the latter was Senate leader, is perhaps the harshest critic of his Viet Nam MARQUIS CHILDS WRITfe OH y/ASHINGTON — It may one day be called the pact or the arts f esUval.

The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had -not received such an invitation in many months. While he had attended ses- sions with other congressional leaders it was no secret that the President was distinctly an- noyed with Fulbright's doubts over the administration course In Viet Nam. Those doubts had been expressed in public with considerable reserve in contrast to the blasts from such all-out critics on the Democratic side as Sens. Wayne Morse of Ore- gon arid Ernest Gruening of Alaska. But Fulbright's reservations about the bombing of North Viet Nam and the escalation of the ground war were nonethe- less deep-seated.

And a Republican, Sen, Jacob K. Javits of New York, asked for a tliorough fact-finding in- quiry into the Vietniimese war, such as the Senate Foreign Re- lations Committee is going to make into the U.S. role in the Dominican Republic. i In the midst of all this, Sen. J. W. Fulbright of Arkansas, chairman of the Foreign Rela tions Committee, Tuesday made a long Senate .speech which didn't pretend to have solutions but illustrated the unhappy American condition. He is against pulling out the American forces in Viet Nam — he .thinks the con,sequences would be disastrous. He hopes for a negotiated settlement doesn't want to see the war broadened. He said he Is afraid broad- ening it would get the United States into a long drawn-out jungle war where the other side would have the advantages. Fulbright made his speech after a White House conference with Johnson. Interpreting The News By WILLIAM RYAN MEXICO CITY (AP) — The United States ri.sked its good- neighbor image by its military action in the IJominican Repub- lic. The image now is larnished in many Latin-American eyes. But even as the Dominican crisis drags on, threatening to be worse in the long run than when it began, the end results for some of Ijitin America may turn out better than had been expected at the out.sei. Some consolation for what- ever loss of prestige the United States may have suffered from the Dominican intervention can conic from a few unexpected results in Latin-American coun- tries. ~\" It all could be nullified, how- ever, at any moment by one more crisis like the Dominican cept in rare cases.

By coincidence on the day (hi two men met a noteworthy sig- nal came from the Republican minority who have until ntm tfeen supporting the Presidem'i fXJlicy. Rep. Melvin R. Laird, chairman of the Republican Conference of the House, issued a statement saying the time was \"dangerously close\" whej Viet Nam'pollcy could no longer be supported. Republicans; said Laird, had not bargained for i large ground war at the ve7 time the Prciident was restrict- ing the bombing in such a nf that it could not succeed. House Republicans, who da not operate under the resiniia imposed on the other side i the Capitol by Minority Leader Everett McKlnley Dirk-sen, hart been itching to get at the lo^ eign policy issue. Whether on the Caribbean and the line that the administration was tolerat- ing a Communist regime in Cuba, exportihg i?ubversion,.or on the threat of \"appeasement\" in Viet Nam whenever the word negotiation is mentioned, the? have begun to edge up. It is i record often played in ihe jaS. with \"appeasement\" on side 1 and \"our boys dragged inio Democrat wars\" on side 2.
