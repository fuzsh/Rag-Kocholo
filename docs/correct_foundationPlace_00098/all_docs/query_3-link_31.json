On a PC, the default game installation location is C:\\Program Files. On a Mac, the default game installation location is your Applications folder.\n\nHow do I change the location of my games after I've installed them?\n\nYou can change the game installation location, but your past installations will remain in their original location. In order to move installed games to the new location they must first be uninstalled and then reinstalled after the new location is selected.\n\nTo choose your new location for game installations, follow these steps:\n\nOpen the Big Fish Games app (Game Manager).\n\nIn the upper right corner, click Options.\n\nClick on the Downloads tab at the top of the Options window.\n\nUnder Game Installation Location, click the Browse button and choose the drive where you would like your games to now be installed.\n\nClick OK.\n\nCan I install my games on an external drive?\n\nYes. Your games can be installed on an external drive by choosing the drive as your Game Installation Location. Make sure the external drive is connected to your computer when you attempt to play games installed in that location."
