I graduated in 1949, the first class whose students spent all four years at Richland High. My maiden name is Watts and my family first came to Richland in 1942 - and all but me still live in the area. In fact, a funny thing happened to my family that made a little history in the Richland annals. I was a sophomore at Richland High at the time. Richland still had many areas that were still undeveloped and dust was a constant nuisance, but it really presented a problem when the wind blew. Well, one night it decided to blow about 88 miles per hour; you couldn't stand or your bare legs felt like the skin was sandblasted of your body. That wind took the roof off our prefab on Roberts and Duportail Avenues and landed in the street. When the roof undertook its flight, it wedged the doors to two bedrooms so tight they couldn't be opened. Unfortunately, my father and uncle were in these rooms and we had no way of knowing whether they were injured, alive, or dead. Fortunately nobody was hurt. However, it was somewhat of a mystery as to what happened to our cat. You can imagine our amazement to find him in the washing machine. How he got there is a real puzzle. When I got to school, Betty Lauder was one of my best friends; her father happened to be the Plant Manager. She told me her father said we caused a major housing problem because all the prefabs in town now had to have their roofs reinforced with metal straps. Happy New Year -Shirley Watts James ************************************************** >>From: Millie Finch Gregg (54) I have been reading all of the memories and truly enjoying each person's recollection of an event or events. It is amazing how much we do remember, when someone \"tweeks\" our memory bank. To: Doris Brinkerhoff (57): Enjoyed your input. You mentioned your sister, Virginia. She was in my class and I am wondering where she is living now. Tell her hello, and to get in touch with some of us, as we are currently planning our 45th reunion in 1999! To all Bombers: Gary and Maren have provided us with such a positive tool to enable us to reconnect after years of separation from high school. Yet, we are still a unique group because of the events that brought us here. Thank you Gary and Maren for your tireless efforts and my hope is that this new year will bring many of us even closer as we reflect on the past. My prayer for all of us in 1999 is good health, renewed health, happiness and contentment and peace. How many of you stayed up until midnight? Not this girl, lights out before then! Those days are over for me, but the younger Bombers will be out and all I can say is: GO BOMBERS!!!!! Until later, -Millie Finch Gregg (54) ************************************************** >>From: Ramona Miller Garcia (54) Dear Bombers and one Falcon: I see by the most recent input that we have a Falcon amidst us. ALL RIGHT!! My kids both graduated from Hanford High and now my daughter, Debbie Montgomery Bell and her husband, Norm (61), teach there. So I see a lot of Purple and Gold. Norm is still a firm Bomber even after all these years so it makes for an interesting household! They have a darling four-year old BOMCON, but he wears mostly purple and gold because his mom buys his clothes. I recently found a book (being a bookstore junkie) that I really enjoyed. It tells of what was going on 'behind the scenes' while we were getting blown away by dust, hanging around drug stores, etc. If you would enjoy some remembrances by people who were here, I highly recommend it to you. WORKING ON THE BOMB An Oral History of WWII Hanford by S. L. Sanger ~ Published by: Portland State Univ. Continuing Education Press, PO Box 1394, Portland, OR 97207 ~~~ Price: $17.95 You will find many familiar names of contributors: Doc Norwood, Mac Macready, Joe Holt, Rob Johnson, Hope Amacker and many more. It was as they saw it all during those years. For our Physics-minded colleagues, it tells of all the trials and tribulations they had to make this thing work (us common-folk can scan that part). It is really fascinating reading. My best to all of you in 1999. The memories we are sharing are great. I look forward each day to hear \"you have mail\" and just hope it's the Sandstorm. It's certainly never Tom Hanks! Thanks again Maren & Gary. -Ramona Miller Garcia ************************************************** >>From: Dick Nelson (59) Do any of you \"old\" Bombers remember Sophomore initiation? John Meyers (58) made me stick my head in a garbage can and sing \"You Ain't Nothing But a Hound Dog\" - got even the next two years though! -Dick Nelson '59 ************************************************** >>From: Howard Kirz (60) RE: Richland Rocket Society Hey Bombermaniacs, Does anybody remember the \"Richland Rocket Society\" circa 1958? Right after Sputnik appeared some Richland whiz kids ( I remember Larson Greninger (60), Mike Waggoner (60) and Mike Lewis (60) as a few of the hapless cohort) figured out that the feds could really use some help and opened their very own branch of NASA. Several railroad ties set up across the bypass highway comprised a bunker and the Mikes spent long hours perfecting a glorious, two-stage, mercury switch, solid fuel rocket. Of course getting it lit with a 12 volt car battery and then dashing around madly looking for cover on the rare occasions when it actually went off proved to be the real test. What's all this sappy media coverage lately about John Glenn? We Bombers were clearly there first! ************************************************** >>From: Sandra Woods Crabtree (61) from a Bomber guest book: Date: Thu Dec 31 16:56:19 1998 Add e-mail address to 1961 alumni list Have just spent the better part of 3 hours at the Richland Bomber website. What a great way to start the new year!!!!!! Ahhhh such memories. ************************************************** >>From: Bruce Edwards (62) For those interested, to be placed on the Bomber Wall of Fame, and athlete must have been an All-State performer in a team sport, or in an individual sport (such as gymnastics or track) taken a first place trophy in state competition. Rather than cheapening the concept behind the \"Wall\", the recent induction of 79 athletes and coaches speaks more to the prowess of Bomber athletes. Think of it, a school in existence for slightly over 50 years has had 100+ athletes be named \"All-State\" or placed first in state competition. Not many other schools can make that claim. Cheers, -Bruce Edwards (62) ************************************************** >>From: Paula Beardsley (62) Just want to take a minute to wish all those on this site the very happiest new year. Getting ready to watch the ball drop with Dick Clark and was remembering running home every day after school to watch American Bandstand. Still can remember how to stroll and do the mashed potatoes, watusi and all those other \"cool\" dances. Maybe it is time to get a life. Anyone else learn to dance with Justine, Pat and the rest of the AB group? Hope 1999 is great to everyone, especially Gary and Maren. Janice - if you are reading this - HNY to you too sis. ************************************************** >>From: Mary Collins Burbage (63) Happy New Year to all fellow Bombers. I will always remember 1998 as the year that brought me back in touch with all my childhood memories. Since I have no family to visit in Richland any longer I rarely get back there. You have all made it seem closer to me and brought back many memories and for that I thank you very much. -Mary Collins Burbage ************************************************** >>From: Roy Ballards (63) Gary, I have all the information about all the people who have been inducted into the wall of fame at RHS. I'll make up the list for the Sandstorm and send it along. The criteria is you have to have been all-state in your sport or have won your event at the state event that you were participating in. Some changes have been made to compensate for sports that don't have a all-state selection such as cross country, softball, golf and adult selections. I've been associated with the wall of fame since it started and also have been fortunate to be on the selection committee for all of the inductees. It all started with Gene Conley (48), Chuck Curtis (55), Norris Brown (57), John Meyers (58), C.W. Brown (58), Theartis Wallace (63), Ray Stein (64), Denny Duncan (66), Pat Hoke (72), Mike Neill (75), Brian Kellerman (79), Bob Kennedy (79), Mark Hoke (79), and 2 coaches: Art Dawald 47-70, and Ray Juricich 47-75.

This is the third group inducted into the Wall of Fame 2/11/95. The first group was inducted 2/11/94 and were all for basketball, baseball and football. The second group was inducted 10/29/94 and was for football. The fourth group which were inducted 12/19/98 is an attempt to bring the wall up to present time and there may be people that we have missed, for that we are sorry, but that can be rectified. They begin with Chad Allen (82), Mike Alton (90), Jamie Archibald (81), Greg Bell (88), Aric Buck (95), Nick Chacon (97), Roger Chambers (80), Mark Culverhouse (76), Micha Dunham (97), Brian Edwards (91), Tim Hale (82), Danny Henrickson (87), Nate Holdren (90), Rod Jochen (80), Jared Mitchell (97), Jim Perryman (86), Bryon Skinner (79), Jim Thompson (75), Dominic Woody (96), and Pete Zorich (77) all for baseball.

If there is anyone that might have any information about or verification of anyone else please let myself or any other member of the nominating committee know. Thanks -Roy Ballard Class of 1963 Have a happy new year. ************************************************** >>From: Larry Holloway (64) TO: Holly chamberlain (76): I was wondering if you lived on Stanton across from Marcus Whitman? If you did, then you lived next door to the Mallory's and across the street from me. We lived at 707 Stanton. My late father's name was Joe Holloway and my name is Larry. ************************************************** >>From: Mary Sullivan (64) To: Janice Beardsley Glenn (62) Re: TONI DOLLS - I wish you could have seen my face when I read your comment about (Best Christmas Present)!! I even thought you could read my mind - because the year I got MY Toni Doll - it was MY best Christmas I had as a little girl! And, just like you - the next year a very good friend of my Mother's (Mrs. Rislov) made several outfits for her - nightgowns, robes, ball gowns with sequins as well as some \"petal pushers\" and tops. You also said \"Wonder what ever happened to them?\" I know where MINE is - She has a \"special place\" in my bedroom along with three other dolls I have had since I was a young girl! I do know some information re: Toni dolls! They stopped making them after 1956 (I believe)! They were \"put out\" by the Tonette Company - Mine is blonde with very long \"bangs\"--They were the first \"plastic\" doll that you could wash her hair and style it! My youngest niece and I have a \"love affair\" with dolls and I have been checking out several books about \"Dolls\" that were very popular \"back in our day\"! I think I'm on a roll here!!! I had a \"Tiny Tears\" doll which I DIDN\"T keep and is now considered a \"collectible\" also - anyone remember \"Bonnie Braids\"?? She was from the \"Dick Tracy\" cartoon. Had THAT ONE also - but didn't keep! One of the other dolls I DID keep is a \"Nancy Ann\" Storybook Doll - \"Muffie\" and the other is \"Saucy Walker\" (you could hold her hand and she could walk)!! The ONE DOLL in the \"whole world\" I desired was a \"Madam Alexander\" - Of which I never received but my youngest niece has at LEAST four of them!!! Well, I could go on and on talking \"Dolls\" but I must run. I Wish Everyone a Safe and Happy New Year!! See you in 1999!! -Mary Sullivan (64) ************************************************** >>From: Teresa DeVine Knirck (64) Regarding Densow's Pharmacy - most of you know by now that my husband, Bill Knirck (65), and I own that drugstore as well as Malley's (used to be Johnson's and then Miller's) in north Richland, Sadly, the soda fountains are gone from both, but if you visit Densow's, you will find that it looks a bit like it did in the old days - same worn tile on the floor for example. Evan Lytle's health declined over the years, and when he passed away, his wife sold Densow's to us. The neighborhood is very nice still and many of the same people are still customers. Of all the smaller drugstores from the fifties and sixties - including Uptown and Downtown Thrifty, Johnson's, Pennywise, the old Malley's on Symons - I think only Malley's and Densow's survive. Drop in and say hi sometime. Bill splits his time between both stores. Also, in answer to Rick Maddy - our daughter, Jocelyn, played basketball for Hanford from 1992-96, and we made many trips to Eastmont. Sounds like we just missed you, though, because her freshman season was 92-93. -Teresa DeVine Knirck ************************************************** >>From: Micky Hemphill (66) Kathy Rathjen(66) wrote that Mrs. Ericson is celebrating her 100th birthday. Boy does that make me feel old. My memories of her: We were preparing for a school play or something, and each student had to select a vegetable or fruit that they wanted to represent up on stage. Well, I thought it would be cool to be spinach, 'cuz the rest of the kids all said \"yuk!\" when it was mentioned. I was real happy until I had to draw a picture of spinach on a large paper board sign to carry. After agonizing over my lack of artistic ability and complete frustration in not knowing how to draw spinach, I told Mrs. Ericson that I was sick with the flu and wanted to go home. Mom came to pick me up, and by the time I got home the truth came out. The next morning Mom assured me that all would be well and not to worry. When we started our sign preparation Mrs. Ericson asked me if I wanted some help, and boy, was I relieved. I didn't find out for several years that Mrs. Ericson had called my Mom the night before to check on me. Memories........... -Micky (66) ************************************************** >>From: Rick Polk (70) Someone mentioned the old J.J. Newberry's store in the Uptown. I remember that soda fountain well. When I was a wee thing, I used to go shopping with my Mom and Grandma and we used to always get lunch at the lunch counter at Newberry's. My favorite was the grilled cheese with fries. Then finish it all off with a hot fudge sundae, in one of their small \"tulip\" glasses. Those were the days. Not a worry in the world. Now we have all the headaches are parents had then.... and then some. -Rick Polk (70) ************************************************** >>From: Steve Neill (72) Much appreciated is the page you've organized. Many of the home folks discuss and share hard copies of the dialogues. thanks again -Steve Neill - class of '72. ************************************************** >>From: Holly Chamberlain (76) To: Jim Wingfield (71): I remember going to Newberry's every year for a long time to see the Easter chicks. (I also remember seeing the uncolored variety at the Farmer's Exchange in Kennewick; another thrill.) As a child, it didn't occur to me that those fascinating little multi- colored chicks were probably not having a good time cheeping around in that brightly-lit bin. A highlight of first grade was the Easter-time drawing in my class (teacher Barbara Brown [then Skalicky], Marcus Whitman) to win a chick. There were two of them, pink and blue, living in the classroom for some period of time prior to the drawing. I think everyone in the class was dying to win one but when the fateful day came for the drawing, two names were picked: Louise Kirz and, I think, Duane Horne. Louise happened to be coming home with me that day after school to play. I still remember the expression on my mother's face when I walked in the door carrying that chick, and the relief that appeared there after the excited report that Louise was the one who had won it, not me. My parents had already been through my sisters receiving baby ducks one Easter - ducks which grew up to do some sort of damage in their yard. As adults, those ducks eventually went to live in Benton City, as did Louise's chicken. I've heard over the years that a lot of people's ex-pets went to various farms out that direction. Today there's the Betty Ford Center - we had the famous Benton City Easter Animal Rehab Center! Thank you to whoever the people were who adopted all those animals! ************************************************** >>From: Kim Edgar Leeming (79) To Debra Evans Grimm (79): Chili and cinnamon rolls were my favorite too. I remember them most in High School, I haven't come across any cinnamon rolls that tastes a good, but I'm still looking. Are you going to the reunion?, If so, maybe I'll see you. Kim \"Edgar\" Leeming Class of \"79\" *************************************** *************************************** That's it for today. Please send more. *************************************** *************************************** ****************************************************** ****************************************************** Alumni Sandstorm ~ 1/2/99 11 Bombers and 1 son of a Bomber sent stuff in: Ralph Myrick (51), Marilyn Peddicord (53), Tom Hughes (56), Carol Carson (60), Gene Trosper - son of Diane Trosper (64), Dan Gregory (66), Jan Jones (67), Patty Eckert (68), Mike Davis (74), Elizabeth McAllister (78), Jenny Smart (87) Kareana Hupp (89) ************************************************** >>From: Ralph Myrick (51) To Shirley Watts James (49): Hi Shirley. I remember that roof blowing off. Our roof was raised about 2 inches. It is a wonder it didn't blow off too. That was the same wind storm that George Parott got peppered from the small pebbles that were flying through the air. He was pushing his bike up Lee Blvd. hill. By the way, I wondered if you remembered the Myricks. Lived right behind you on Rossell Ave. I was wondering what happened to you. I see Bob once in a while and saw Jim a time or two in the paper. Mom is 87 years old now and not well. She has lost her sight and has dementia. Norma is her care giver and has been for the last 20 years. Nice to see your name come up on the Alumni Sandstorm. -Ralph Myrick ************************************************** >>From: Marilyn Peddicord Whitley (53) I haven't seen Betty Byrd (53) or Marilyn Richey (53) mentioned for the athletic wall of fame - they were really excellent. ************************************************** >>From: Art \"Tom\" Hughes (56) Someone mentioned the Rocket Society. I think the first one was in 1953. Myself and several friends got together with Robert Heinrich, the Chemistry Teacher, and joined the American Rocket Society. This was headed up by some of the people from NASA and was for high school students. We got the formula for a zinc and sulfur rocket fuel and made a number of small rockets. We fired these off below the high school where there was a large concrete handball court. We would set up the rocket on one side, light the fuse and run to the other side. We made tracking devices so we could measure how high they went. I built a very large one from a large paper tube and a payload with a parachute and some other pieces. I don't remember what they were supposed to do. This one blew up and we all went running. We later found pieces of the rocket in the swimming pool and there was a large black mark on the north side of the handball court for a long time. -Tom Hughes, Class of 56 ************************************************** >>From: Carol Carson Renaud (60) Several members of mentioned J.J. Newberry's recently. The strongest memories popped into my head of Blue Waltz Perfume, the Waxy Orange Lipstick and buying fabric upstairs for our Home Ec projects. Wow! -Carol (Carson) Renaud '60 ************************************************** >>From: Gene Trosper - son of Diane Trosper (64) I was surfing the internet and decided to check in on the happenings in Richland, WA (my old hometown) when I stumbled upon the Bomber Alumni page. I wasn't certain what year my Mom graduated, so I gave her a call and she said 1964. I clicked on the link, and there was her name: Diane Trosper. She yelled out ecstatically when I clicked on her name and her graduation photo popped up! Well, she wants me to send a quick update to you: She is now living in Sandy, Utah, where she owns a small home. She has two kids, Gene (that's me!) who is 33 and Gale, who is soon to be 28. Gale also lives in Utah and works at a credit union. I live in Southern California. Both of my Mom's parent's are deceased. Homer, in 1981 and Welthey in 1989. She has said that if you want contact information to please let me know and I will send it your way! You would be surprised who she remembers! I was surfing all the class of 64 information while I had her on the phone and the memories came flooding out for her. It was probably the best New year's present I could have ever given her. Although she owns a computer, she is not online, but hopes to be soon. She wants me to pass on a New year's greeting to everyone. Take care. -Gene Trosper ************************************************** >>From: Dan Gregor (66) HI THERE TO ALUMNI SANDSTORM: MY WIFE AND I HAVE FUN READING ALL THE MEMORIES OF YESTERYEARS. THERE'S SOME MENTIONING OF THE OLD JJ NEWBERRY. I HAVE A TRIVIA FOR YOU WHO WENT THERE TO EAT - ANYONE KNOW WHO THE WOMAN WAS WHO RAN THE FOUNTAIN FOR MANY Y EARS? HER SPECIALTY WAS HOME MADE PIES. MICKY IF YOU READ THIS NO FAIR RESPONDING. -DAN GREGORY-66 ************************************************** >>From: Jan Jones Becker (67) Hi. I'm Jan (Janet Jones) Becker. Class of '67. I didn't graduate from Richland as we moved to Fairbanks when I was in high school. I did attend Jason Lee, Chief Jo, and a year of high school there. I kept in touch with some of the kids and did go back for their 10th year reunion. Bev Karns (67) started sending me the Sandstorm and I really enjoy it. I think she sends it to my older brother as well. He is Don Jones (RHS - '64). So we grew up there. Our Dad recently moved back there (Pasco). I visited him last May and was amazed at the changes! I have really laughed at some of the memories this reading has sparked. Anyway thanks to everyone involved whose major efforts has produced much pleasure to all. -Jan ************************************************** >>From: Patty Eckert Weyers (68) Thanks for all the work giving us the Bomber memories Maren and Gary, Happy New Year to You and Yours. A special Happy New Year To [deleted for privacy]. (hope all is working out for you and Best Wishes in '99) Dan Henry what do you think of our low-key snow fall here in Montana, what a winter this is turning into! and Sally Radditz (sp). from C of K. Where are all the CofK oldies now: Leon Heneghen, Susan Henderson, Linda Dossett, Ellen Kuykendall, Steve Rouse, Dale Kunizel(sp) Steven Edwards, Peggy Burnside, Randy Kaffenzes (sp), Rita Hodges,Michelle Vesper, Janice Kleyn, Len Clossey, Barbara Clement, Cathy Charette, John Gastkill, Sharon Ghirado, Kathy Grob, Nancy Casey, Dick Foley, Stacy Elliott, Gail Meyer, Jodi Williams, Martin Salina, Mary Kerstetter, Jack Cartmell and Phil Amy; we shared 8 years of nuns and priest and 'lay-teachers' and mass and the sacraments! Now I cherish all those memories of our recitals and processions and competitive sports like the volley ball and soccer and tether ball matches and the memorizing of all those prayers and commandments and church rules.... Some of my old teachers were, and (I wonder where they are today) : Sister Margaret Mary, Mrs. Duncan, Mrs. Murphy, Sister Martin Mary, Sister Auriella Marie?? They were all younger nuns except the last one... anyone know any of them or where they are today? Going onto our first experiences in a public (freedom!) school in '64. Sally have enjoyed the pictures of our drill team and Mrs. Murphy's class. She was one great teacher. We most all went on to Col Hi and became the infamous Bombers of class of '68 closer for the CofK years... Well hoping all Bomber and Family Bombers have a Wonderful Year Ahead in 1999! -Patty Eckert Weyers (68) ************************************************** >>From: Mike Davis (74) I've seen names here of some of the old participants in the 3 on 3 Basketball tournaments at my parent's house on Tinkle. I remember when my brother, Steve (Bear) (72) and I started pestering my dad about putting in a basketball court. My dad would always say, \"Sure, go right ahead. You two get the ground ready to go!\" I think he thought by saying that that we'd forget about the idea and move on to something else. Boy, was he wrong!! He came home from work one day in the summer of 1970 to find that the entire neighborhood of kids, along with a few others, had removed the sod from about 1/3 of his backyard. We were ready for concrete!! After the initial shock, my dad climbed on board and saw the project through. Little did he know that he would become the proud owner of the most famous basketball court in the city of Richland. Throughout the seventies and into the eighties this court was the unofficial training grounds for future Bomber hoopers. The teachers were the older kids who taught the younger ones the finer points of the game such as: NO BLOOD, NO FOUL!! (Of course unless you were Dick Cartmell(73) or Rod (Dink) Marcum(76) who would call a foul about every play.) TRAVELING (Never hurt to get that extra step in - Just ask Kelvin Soldat (71)) HOLDING (If the guy was bigger than you, of course you held him) ELBOWS (I had many a knot on my head from the likes of John (Rooster) Anderson(71) and Pat Hoke (72). I can remember playing hours and hours, regardless of the weather. Sometimes we would get the snow shovels out to clear the court to play. One winter every thing iced over so we threw salt pellets on the court to play. Incredible 3 on 3 tournaments would take place. In fact I recall one tournament we had representatives from ever graduating class from 1961-1981. Many learned the game in elementary and jr. high, but the skills were honed on Davis Court. I'll include the names of some participants. I apologize if I leave your name off. It was unintentional! The Davis boys (Steve(72), Mike(74), Jumbo and Wig(82),The Slater Boys (Rick(76) and Greg(73)), Paul Caudill(72), Craig King(71), Kelvin Soldat(71), Dennis Soldat(81), Dick Cartmell(73), Jim Bixler(72), The Marcum Boys (Jeff(73) Rod(76) Randy) The Neill Boys (Steve(72) Mike (75) I think even Phil(66) might of played a couple times) Obie Amacker, Jon Anderson(71), Eric Anderson, Thompson Boys (Jim(75) and Dean(72)) Blaine Teverbaugh(74) Pat Booth(73) Mark Ibatuan(74), Winston McCulley(74), Greg Sevigny(74), Roger Kindley(74), Paul Rinehart(74), Chuck Peoples(75), Mark Stevens(74), Gus Myers(79), Barry Deobald(74), Dave Keller (82), Mark Bircher (82), George Naughton(82), John Wunderlich(82) Dick Wing(74) Dave Tubbs(75), Roger Sonderland(77), Roger Fishbach, Mike Hogan(70) and many many more!!! ************************************************** >>From: Elizabeth McAllister McCardle (78) HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL BOMBERS!

Best wishes to all. -ELIZABETH MCCARDLE (MCALLISTER) CLASS OF 78 ************************************************** >>From: Jenny Smart Page (87) To all of you Bombers from years past who are sharing such wonderful stories, I would like to say Thank You!! Its fun for us more recent graduates to hear what it was like to be Bomber in the early years. And to Shirley Watts James (49): I had always known that early on in the school's history there were freshman classes, but I didn't know when was the first graduating class year. I'm from the \"other\" first freshman class (87). A bunch of us were upset when they closed Chief Jo in '83, because we wouldn't get to be \"top dog\" at the Junior High. Then we realized what a true gift we had been given! We were going to be Bombers for FOUR years!! ..and not just three like everyone else! (My first thought was of all the money I was going to save by getting into football and basketball games free with my ASB card). I hope you had as much fun being a Bomber for four years as my class did! Happy Green & Gold New Year! -Jenny Smart Page (87) ************************************************** >>From: Kareana Hupp McCulloch (89) Hello to all and especially those from the 80's. I am one of the lucky ones to never have gone through the changing of schools but went to Lewis and Clark, Carmichael Jr High and then onto Richland High. I have to say I miss the Richland schools. My children attend Kennewick schools and now as of next year they will attend Bethlehem Lutheran for the remainder of their years. It is sad to see how little the schools care for our children. Now does anyone feel the same? As for that 10 year coming up, I am looking forward to see how everyone is doing. I think we've all just gotten old, married and had kids. LOL Hope everyone had a safe and enjoyable New Years. Take care -Kareana Hupp McCulloch (89) *************************************** *************************************** That's it for today.

We lived across the street from Eckerts, we were at 403 Smith and Mandels were on the corner. I remember catching the bus on the corner of Sanford and Duportail and riding down to C.C.Andersons. Those shopping trips were really a thrill for me. My memories are of By's Burgers as my Mom worked there when it first opened and I would stop there on my way home from school and Byron would pick me up and put me on one of the stools and feed me french fries and coke. I also remember Skips as we would run down there for lunch when in high school. As for the initiation to high school we had to wear our clothes on backwards, and during Atomic Frontier Days the upper classmen would catch us and write things with lipstick all over our arms and faces. When you mentioned Newberry's I am reminded of it every day. I work in that building and - even though I know it is there - I trip over the hump in the floor where they have filled in where the floor slanted down into the snack bar. Densow's when it first opened had a restaurant attached known as the Green Hut, my Father-in-law was the cook then and later was the chef at Ernie's, which is now the Golden Lion. My brother said he remembers the older Eckert girl taking him and my sister out to Finley to go swimming he thought it was a 1930's car. Tell Rita hello for me, I haven't seen her and Lonnie for quite a while. Thanks to Gary and Maren and Happy New year to all. -Betty McElhaney Hudspeth (57) ************************************************** >>From: Vera Smith Robbins (58) To: Dan Gregory (66): Dan, saw your question in the Alumni Sandstorm about the manager of the fountain. I believe her name was Butch Gregory. I used to work at Newberry's for about 3 or 4 years. Even after I got married and was pregnant, I still worked during Christmas and ran the main register because I was so fast. I think when I started there, I made 75 cents an hour. -Vee (aka Goldi13) ************************************************** >>From: Gregor Hanson (65) To Dan (Danny) Gregory (66) - The woman who ran the lunch counter at JJ Newberry's for years was your own very dear Mother - \"Butch\" Gregory!! -Gregor Hanson '65 ************************************************** >>From: Mari Eckert Leahy (65) Re Patti Eckert Wyers (68) letter asking for info on so many of her CK classmates and teachers, from WAY back in the late 50's, early 60's -- I only know that Mrs. Agnes Murphy has passed on, and Sr. Aurilia Maria, the last I heard several years ago, she was in the retirement nunnery(?) up in Spokane. Though I know some of the brothers and sisters of some of the classmates you listed, am afraid I can't give you anymore info. Love ya, sis. -Mari Leona Eckert Leahy (65) ************************************************** >>From: Sandy Hardin Koontz (65) This is in reply to Nancy Cruz (65). Seeing your name brought back lots of memories. We lived a few houses down the street from you at 2008 Turner. I remember I went to my first boy/girl party in your back yard and we danced on your patio. You, your Mother, and your sister were all crazy about a certain Spanish male singer whose name escapes me, and you played his 78 records. Those were carefree times. I remember outside slumber parties (also with Andrea Wilson (65) and Terri Cawdry (64) who lived in the 2000 block of Van Giesen. We would run around the neighborhood all night long - something we would be terrified to let out own children do. Then in the morning Terri's Mother would make huge pancake breakfasts. I reestablished contact with Andrea during the 1995 class reunion and have seen Terri, probably in 1982 or 1987, because her husband is in the same class as my husband. Do you know what has happened to anyone else on the old block? -Sandy Hardin Koontz (65) ************************************************** >>From: Darwin Perkins (69) Debra Evans Grimm (79) and others wrote about the Chili and cinnamon rolls. I have the recipe. They taste as good now as they did then.

Wow! Lots of (mostly good) memories. ************************************************** >>From: Mike Franco (70) It was great to hear the history of Bear Davis' basketball court and the \"legends \" who played there... although some (like Rooster Anderson and Slug Daddy Soldat) are already in the Richland Outer Limits Hall of Fame. The story does bring to mind memories of one of the great athletic venues in the annuls of WIFFLE BALL history: Clark Stadium located on the corner lot of the parents of Fat Jack Clark. This hallowed turf was prowled originally by the likes of Jim Van Wyke, Big Bixler, Fat Jack and others.... then the park was passed on to Cartmells (Jack & Dan), Pete Turping, Goofy Felts, Boston et al. We even had a scoreboard we put up. It was not of the exploading variety, it was of the \"wind blew it down\" variety. This was a multi purpose facility as we played \"pass football\" there when we weren't playing wiffle ball. The special joy was playing \"fat bat\" wiffle ball with an oversized red bat.... when the games got slow we could always hit some of \"the little kids\" (Dick Cartmell & Jim Bixler were two favorite targets) over the head with those bats without causing too much damage. I would like to hear from any others that appeared at Clark Stadium.... -Mike Franco (70) ************************************************** >>From: Gene Trosper (84) Well, I have been busy making contact for my Mom, Diane Trosper (64) but have neglected to inform you I attended Col. High myself for two years (82 & 83). I am class of 84 and wound up having to transfer, so I couldn't finish out my time there. Oh well, we can't always get what we want! I played on the undefeated sophomore football team in 82 and had become a member of the wrestling team that year also, but a medical problem prevented me from remaining on the team. Talk about disappointment! It would have been a personal honor to wrestle with the likes of Martin Yamamoto. I attended Jason Lee and Lewis & Clark before moving on to Carmichael Jr. High. I spent my 8th grade year in Yakima (Wilson Jr. High) then moved back to Richland in time for 9th grade at Carmichael (wrestling and track). I moved from the Tri-Cities in Oct. 1988 and haven't been back since. I currently live in Southern California, am married and have a daughter who attends private school. I work in the medical device industry and am heavily involved in politics. Currently, I am chairman of the Riverside County Libertarian Party. I served as an assistant operations manager for a gubernatorial candidate briefly this past year. Doesn't mean I'm a stuffed shirt though! Anyone who remembers me knows I was a music fanatic.. I still am! I played bass guitar for a spell and attended studio engineering classes in Hollywood in 1989. Anyway, I have been in an extremely sentimental mood lately and I am very interested to get back in touch with anyone I knew from my life in Richland. A few people I knew: David Smith, Dave Walker, Orlando Wallace, Mike Myer (his father was/is pastor at the Lutheran church by Carmichael Jr. High), Kim Nolan, Janet Finch, David Bennet... I could go on, but I will save some space for everyone else contributing to this fine e-mail publication! If my Mom attends her class reunion this summer, I am considering tagging along to see how much my hometown has changed and perhaps even look into employment opportunities there (though I doubt my native So. Cal. wife would want to transplant!). By the way, go ahead and add me to the e-mail list for the class of 84, if possible (though I had to transfer just before my senior year). Have a FANTASTIC New Year everyone! Warmest regards from Southern California, Gene Trosper (84) ************************************************** >>From: Kathy Jones aka Yvonne Taylor (84) To Mike Davis (74): I lived just down the street from the Davis Court, around the corner on Birch. I am the sister of Dave Jones and I'm sure he was involved in the construction, or at least played on it at one time or another. He didn't miss out on anything in that neighborhood! Yeah, I turned out a tomboy, but how could I not - in that neighborhood full of boys, like Jumbo and Wiggy, Bob Andy and Scott Carter, and Gus Meyers. My poor mother, the things she had to endure, like my brother turning our backyard into a putting green, complete with 18 holes. The day my brother and the Carter boys decided to build their own in-ground swimming pool. Dug a big hole, filled it with trash bags for a liner. Geez what a mess that was. Well, Mr. Carter, Curly as we all called him, finally gave in years later and put in the real thing. None of the boys would let me in, except for Andy Carter. He was always a sweetheart! And just for the record, I was 14 before I knew that you had more than four tries to make a touchdown (you know, yardage and all that.... our back yard was just big enough for a decent game, but they never explained yardage to me.) and that running up behind someone and tackling them right behind the knees is called clipping and is very illegal. Hey, that's my secret tackle technique! Worked every time on those big boys! Thanks to all those good neighbors who would patiently break, wait for us to finish our baseball play, then move out of the street so they car could pass. Thanks for the memory Mike..... -Yvonne (aka Kathy) Jones Taylor ************************************************** >>From: Julie Hannah Gilchrist (89) If they're still taking nominations for the Hall of Fame, Travis Litchfield must be included. Even if he didn't win state (which I think he actually did or our team did...), Travis deserves to be in the Bomber Hall of Fame. He was an incredible athlete and he epitomized what the Bomber Cross Country program is all about. -Julie Hannah Gilchrist (89) *************************************** *************************************** That's it for today.

I want to thank in this Sandstorm today Jan. 3rd, a fellow Bomber and wonderful friend and ex-spouse, Benton County Deputy Sheriff Officer Nick Koontz (68) for assisting in the early morning hours on the first call coming in on my Dad's peril. \"Andy\" Eckert was 85 and he and Mom have been married a wondrous 66 years, arriving in 1944 with 5 of the later to be 10 children he and \"Vada\"/Mom had to form our Eckert Clan. The fast response of Nick helped alert another Eckert cousin, Benton County Sheriff's Lt. Jerry Hatcher and he in turn called his Uncle CJ, my youngest brother and before Nick could even arrive at my parents' home, three of my four brothers had been notified and were there for our sweet Mother of 81 so she wasn't alone. Dad found the courage and intellect to move clear across the U.S. coming in from New York when Hanford was still a big mystery contract and building an existence for his growing family starting. I see where our beloved 'F' House on Van Giesen just sold again to yet another young Dad I witnessed loading up his sons in his truck parked out front of the house over the Holidays and it brought back some great old memories of the years I spent there with my brothers and sisters. He will be greatly missed by all of our family and friends and I so appreciate all you Bombers reliving cherished memories this past year making one truly relive and remember how extremely lucky we were to be raised in Richland and share this common bond for a life time. -Patty Eckert Weyers (68) *************************************** *************************************** That's it for for this Special Edition. *************************************** *************************************** ****************************************************** ****************************************************** Alumni Sandstorm ~ 1/4/99 10 Bombers sent stuff in: Mary Kay Mitchell (52), Vera Smith (58), Cheryl Moran (66), Larry Brunelle (67), Darwin Perkins (69), Rebecca Manolopoulos (70), Kelvin Soldat (71), Kellie Walsh (77), Mike Neidhold (77), Kareana Hupp (89) ************************************************** >>From: Kay Mitchell Coates (52) Having spent a quiet New Year's sitting here in my northeast Washington mountain home (in a snow covered deep freeze!) I had time to reflect on how New Year's was spent in Richland when I was a kid. Back in the middle 40's there was not a lot to do on New Year's Eve for a grade school kid. I attended Sacy and lived at 1108 Williams Blvd. The really BIG thing for the neighborhood kids to do was to gather in our front yard, everyone bringing some kind of noisemaker, and at the stroke of midnight, we would bang on old kettles, toot whistles or make whatever kind of noise we could. Pretty exciting! Just want to thank Ralph Myrick (51) for helping me find my buddy Carol Haynes (51). She was my best friend during those early Richland days and welcomed me into the Williams Blvd. clan the very day we moved into the house. We kept track of each other for years as we married, had our children, etc. I had not heard from her for several years and through the Alumni Sandstorm, was able to reconnect with her yesterday. We had a wonderful conversation via telephone. She is living in MD, soon to retire and move to Florida with her new husband. I told her about the Sandstorm and she is anxious to subscribe as soon as they are established in their new home. Thanks Ralph for helping me find her! -Kay Mitchell Coates (52) ************************************************** >>From: Vera Smith Robbins (58) To: All '58 class member who still live in Richland or close to Richland: A few of us got together the other day and thought it might be a great idea to have a get together on a regular basis. We could meet once a month, on the first Sunday of each month, at Roy's Chuckwagon at the \"Y\" at 1:00 pm. This would be a no host luncheon. Just come if you can, if you can't, then come the following month or whenever. We thought it would be a great way to keep in touch and exchange memories and ideas. If everyone would pass this idea on to other 1958 classmates that aren't on-line we can reach as many as possible. This should be fun and would keep us all \"in touch\". We will start this the first Sunday of February. Hope to see you there next month! -Vera Smith Robbins (58) ************************************************** >>From: Cheryl Moran Fleming (66) Wishes to everyone for a Healthy and Happy New Year! Beings how it's the last year of the Century, my resolve is to make it a good one. Mary Sullivan reminded me of several dolls I owned. I'd forgotten about Tiny Tears and Toni Dolls. I got a Ginny doll each year in my stocking. They were a smaller, chunkier version of Barbi. A few years ago we went to an antique toy show and saw not only Ginny, but many toys from childhood. My mother worked at the Elite Shop in Uptown for a while and bought my sister and I Barbi Dolls when they first came out. They were bride dolls with full white gowns and veils. I passed it down to my daughter when she was young, and it's still in a lunch pail with the original clothes (somewhere in this house). I doubt whether it's worth much because of its condition, but I'm glad we kept it. I have no idea where my baby doll ended up. This was purchased for one of my birthdays from the old toy store in downtown Richland that became a typewriter store. My grandma knitted beautiful sweaters, hats and booties. She also sewed clothes for it. We ate at the Newberry's lunch counter once in a while. Always liked the club sandwiches cut into triangles with toothpicks holding it together. It was fun to be able to watch the food being made right at the counter. But it was really exciting when they opened the grill next to it. You could order hot dogs and hamburgers and see the hot dogs cooking on the rollers. I still remember the lady who worked at the grill. She had glasses and earrings that matched. Thought that was awesome!!!!!!!!! The last day of school my Mom would take us there for a banana split. -Cheryl Moran Fleming (66) ************************************************** >>From: Larry Brunelle (67) Howdy one and all For those of you waiting for someone to perform some rare act, or just some rare event that will happen only \"Once in a BLUE MOON\" then Jan 31, 1999 is the day (or night).

They thought it would be a great addition to the Bomber web page. You might give credit to Rayola Wheelright for giving me the recipe several years ago. They always turn out great. Really brings back fond memories. --Darwin Perkins (69) RICHLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT CINNAMON ROLLS (makes a bunch!) 1. Dissolve 3T of Yeast & 2 T of Sugar in 1C of lukewarm water 2. Add 1 1/2 cups of lukewarm water 3. Scald 2 cups of milk, Add 2/3 cups of shortening & 10T of Sugar (just less than 3/4C), 2T of salt, stir until dissolved Cool. Beat 2 eggs and add to milk mix. Pour that into the yeast water from step 2. Gradually mix in 10-12 cups of flour Till the dough is thick 4. Kneed till smooth 5. Put in a greased bowl and raise 1 hour punch down and let raise another 45 minutes 6. Roll in a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Butter dough completely with softened butter (try 1/4 to 1/2 cup of butter). Sprinkle with brown sugar until it's covered (1-2 cups at least). Sprinkle with cinnamon until covered. Add raisins or (wal)nuts as desired. Roll up the entire rectangle and slice into 1 inch sections. (for large rolls flatten with the palm of your hand). Place pieces in buttered pan or cookie sheet. (if you pack them in, just touching, they look just like the ones from the cafeteria when they are done) Let stand 45 minutes. Bake 15-20 minutes at 350F. Remove from oven and glaze. Note: If you want to add raisins, put the raisins in a small amount of water then in the Microwave for a minute or two. Drain them WELL, maybe squeeze excess out with your hands. Add to the dough after a few cups of flour, then mix and add the rest of the flour. To cut into nice even pieces, use a string. Slide the string under the long roll, bring the ends up to the top, cross and pull. This will cut the rolls without smashing them. Glaze: Mix powered sugar, Margarine (or Butter), vanilla, and milk until it looks and tastes right (try a cube of margarine, lots of sugar, a tsp. of vanilla, and milk until the glaze is smooth.) Don't glaze the rolls until they are ready to be eaten, If you want to save them till later, put the glaze in an air-tight container. After the rolls cool, you can cover them in plastic. They're still good re-heated in the microwave. (30-45 seconds) ************************************************** >>From: Rebecca Manolopoulos (70) I want to let everyone know who has been sending messages for my sister Alexandra to my e-mail, she has finally decided to join the 21st century and get on line.

She can be reached at [deleted for privacy] As you will notice she cannot just purchase a PC and join all of us she has to go get the webtv. It could be due to her age and eye sight (no offense to all Bomber's older than her).

It was THE place to play if you wanted to become a Bomber hoopster in the 70's and 80's. More important it was a wonderful place to meet and \"hang\", mainly because of the neighborhood people and the terrific hosts the Davis family). I spent so much time there it became a second home to me. Mike, don't forget to put Gary Webb (64) and Denny Duncan (66) on your list of famous Bomber hoopsters to play there. Mike, I do agree on your assessment of Dick Cartmell (73) and Rod Marcum always calling fouls and Pat Hoke's and Rooster Anderson's elbows but Mike, I never traveled, I was just utilizing the Mel Schauer cross over step I so perfected. One thing for sure, of all the players that played at Davis Court, Steve Neill was the shortest! Rumor has it there will be a reunion this summer of all Tinkle streeters and Davis Court regulars. More on that will be forthcoming.

Someone told me about this site so I had to check it out. Nice work. As RHS alumni, has anyone ever tried to explain to someone what the mascot of our school was (is)? Every time I tell about the R logo with the mushroom cloud, or how the cheerleaders would bring out a 3 foot bomb replica out on the basketball court at half time, they look at me with such disbelief. Also they laugh when they hear about the good ol' Bleacher Bums at the Basketball games and their obnoxious chants like this one that was grandfathered in from way back... \"1-2-3-4 everybody hit the floor, 5-6-7-8 everybody urinate. Give me a U (U), Give me a R (R), Give me an I (I), Give me a N (N), Give me a E (E), what's that spell (URINE), what's that spell (URINE), what's that MEAN (You're in Bomber Country, You're in Bomber Country ...\" Okay I'll stop, I'll stop.

Too many things to see and do to feel too old. To: Kay Mitchell Coates (52) You lived down the street on Williams from my husband Paul. He lived at 1003 Williams in the 40's. We remember his mother knowing your mother and I think my mother Grace Meyer may have known your mother also. Was your father in Security?

We talked to them both at a reunion sometime ago. My husband says he enjoyed playing basketball with Allan and we both enjoyed knowing them. We just checked their pictures in our 1946 annual.

Mike, I never had the opportunity to work with your dad but my wife, Judy Myrick, did. She was secretary at Richland High when you dad was there. One thing she will always remember about Jerry is each morning when he got to work he would report to the office to check with Judy and Betty Steelman. They would always check his socks to make sure they matched. And I don't care where it was on the street or on the golf course, Jerry would pull up his pants so she could check his socks. I know my wife certainly did think the world of your dad. I did too. I played lots of golf with him and Jim Perryman. Those two guys were something else. I know I played with your dad and some of your brothers, you might have been one. Jerry was well thought of and well liked by everyone. ************************************************** >>From: Jane Rollison (52) To Ken Heminger (56): I don't believe we ever met, but I grew up in West Richland when it was still Enterprise/Heminger City.

I was horrified to hear a rumor that the top of Flat Top is now fenced off! Is this true? Is the cross gone? I thought that was public land - or if not, it should be. It belongs to all of us. -Jane Rollison (52) ************************************************** >>From: Marguerite Groff Tompkins (54) New Year's Greetings. Hope this time next year we can all get into our e-mail at 1/1/2000 - and our computers aren't thinking it's 1900 and won't work. Sure would miss this mail - not to mention my lights, heat, water, etc. My \"little\" brother, Bill Groff (61) finally got on line. Please add his e-mail to your Sandstorm list. He's retired from Boeing and is enjoying it. He would love to hear from any of his friends out there. His e-mail is: [deleted for privacy]. I can hardly wait to hear his stories of growing up in Richland. There are six years difference in our ages, so I wasn't much interested in what he was doing in those days. I tell my grandkids about the neat drugstores we used to have in town. The drugstores I frequented was the Thrifty Drugs next to the Richland Theater in downtown. They had the (then traditional) soda fountain which we always visited after the movies. There was a drugstore on Symons next to what was then the Groceteria (sp??) Grocery store. The Richland Bakery was attached to the grocery store. These business were located on the corner of Symons and Goethals. There was also the Pennywise Drugstore on the corner of Thayer and Williams Blvd. That also became a popular place to get our favorite ice cream and/or soda. And then Densow's Drugs that everyone has talked about so much. Next to Densow's there was a grocery store (can't remember name) that became Roys Chuck Wagon and is now West Side Church's Activity Center. I always thought Densow's carried lots of neat things. I can't remember specifics, but at the time we lived on the corner of Olympia and Cottonwood and I used money earned from baby-sitting to buy wonderful and marvelous gifts from Densow's. I don't think I've been in there since they re-opened. However, another \"Senior Moment,\" I don't remember Densow's Green Hut Restaurant that Betty McElhaney Hudspeth (57) mentioned. To Darwin Perkins (69): Thanks for the Cinnamon Roll recipe. I'm on my New Year's resolution diet so can't bake or eat them, but you have made the day for all 6 of my kids that went through the Richland School District. Thursdays was always chili and cinnamon rolls. If I had kept records, I bet they had fewer Thursdays as \"sick days\" than any other day. I'm sure this will be a treasured family recipe for many years to come. Atomic Frontier Days bring back great memories. When I think about being a teenager I loved those times and remember how much we all looked forward to Atomic Frontier Days. A group of us would walk downtown and spend all day. There was always the street dance and all our friends would be there. There was so much excitement. I think for me it was the balmy weather we had - the nights were almost magical (at least when I look back at it). It seemed like there were always lots of stars and the wonderful harvest moons. Of course, I had a lot of the same feelings about going to football and basketball games. I suppose it was the excitement of being young and having no worries and the feeling that life would always be as exciting as it was then. Well - enough nostalgia for this time. It's really nice to have this forum to just reminisce and bring back some of those feelings of youth. Today is wonderful with great children, grandchildren and even a great-grandchild who has (hard for me to believe) made me the \"mother of a grandmother.\" That seemed a little more traumatic than just saying I was a great-grandma But, thank God for memories and being able to go back, once in a while, for just a few minutes. Once more, Gary and Maren, you are awesome and we are all so grateful. Marguerite ************************************************** >>From: Robert Kennedy (60) Like Howard Kirz (60), I too, have recently thought about the Richland Rocket Society. I never got out to one of their launches, so never had the benefit of a first hand observation. I suspected that some of the members used the launchings as a way to attract adventuresome girls to desolate lonely places - \"forget the submarine races, we've got rockets!\" I found interesting, Howard's use of the word \"sappy\" in his recent contribution to the Sandstorm. I remember how that word came into the working vocabulary of most of a junior English class in the spring of 1959. It was at the time of the writing contest \"Voice of Democracy\" (I think) for which we were all given the opportunity to enter and for which some actually wrote moving essays on the topic of democracy in America. For this contest, Mr. Black read a couple of the best submittals and asked us to comment. Howard's was clearly the best and most of us agreed, but not Karen Karnie (60). She raised her hand and informed the world that Howard's entry sounded \"sappy.\" Howard's essay went on to win the competition in the Tri-Cities and I continue to think of that little episode whenever I hear or read the word \"sappy.\" -Robert Kennedy (60) ************************************************** >>From: Carol Converse Maurer (64) Maren: There was mention of the \"Blue Moon\" at the end of this month. You mentioned no full moon in February and 2 full moons again in March. I read in the paper yesterday about this. They said that the last time that there were 2 months of 2 full moons was in 1915. Just thought I'd add this trivia. -Carol Converse Maurer (64) ************************************************** >>From: Kathy Rathjen Loper (66) This is a second invitation to former Lewis and Clark students who had Mrs. Ericson (and anyone else who is interested) to send her a birthday card or note for her 100th birthday. Her birthday is January 16, and I'll mail a packet of greetings on January 11th. You may send them to Mrs. Peg Ericson, c/o Kathy Loper, 1309 Rochefontaine, Richland, Wa 99352. Thanks to those who have already participated. I know she will appreciate hearing from you. -Kathy Rathjen Loper (66) ************************************************** >>From: Lucinda Green (69) from a Bomber Guess Book Date: Mon Jan 4 18:31:13 1999 Great Web site and idea! While riding Delta \"home\" for the holidays sat next to a grad from 1984 who lives in CO. as do I. She told me about the site and I was definitely interested. She offered to email me the address which I just received today. And here I am. Thanks for all of your combined efforts. Happy New Year and I'm looking forward to attending the Class of '69 30th reunion in August. -Lucinda Green (69) ************************************************** >>From: Mike Franco (70) To: Mike Neidhold Regarding your dad Jerry... I graduated in 70 and never had your dad in grade school ( I went to Jefferson) and didn't have him for driver's ed ( I had Droopy Juricich, a truly inspirational educator). However, I did get to witness your fathers \"navigational skills\" many mornings at the Spudnut Shop... it was indeed an education..... -Mike Franco (70) ************************************************** >>From: Don McJilton (72) Response to Kelvin Soldat's (71) memories of the Davis basketball court. Don't forget about all the good games right across the street at Craig (Wally) King's. I can remember spending a lot of time there and playing late into the nite. -Don McJilton (72) ************************************************** >>From: Patty Stordahl (72) Re: Darwin Perkins (69) recipe: You are a God send. I have always boasted of the old chili and cinnamon roll lunch. Now I can actually make them. I printed the recipe out and I am gong to make them today. Guess what we will have for dinner? \"A MEMORY Lunch\". Thanks. This is great. and welcome to [email deleted for privacy] This really is a blast -Patty Stordahl (72) ************************************************** >>From: Mike Davis (74) I've been reading some people's memories about Bomber basketball and it has given me a idea. Let's do an informal poll of the greatest Bombers ever. Send me your choices of the best hoopsters that you can recall. Your list may only have one or two names or it may have a dozen ,but remember, only the best ones. Mail your choices to me at and I will tally the results and post them in the Sandstorm in a few weeks. Hoping to hear from you soon! Please include player's graduation year and your graduation year. --Mike Davis (74) ************************************************** >>From: Kelly Weil Austin (81) This message is in response to Mike Neidhold's (77) request for memories about his dad, Jerry. Yes, I had the distinct privilege of taking Drivers Ed from your dad. I remember sitting in his summer school classroom while watching all those old blood-bath films like \"Blood on the Highway\". If those movies were supposed to put the fear of death into all of us, just so we would be safer drivers, it worked! Even so, the movies were a little campy! I also remember many of your dad's funny little quips about getting us to pay attention to the road while we were driving! Here are a few: \"When you are the driver, don't be looking in the mirror at Billy and Susie playing `kissy-face' in the back seat...\" \"You always drive where you're looking.\" (turning his head and putting his hands up like he was holding onto the steering wheel, then proceeding to turn in the wrong direction.) HE WAS RIGHT! \"Pay attention you peeps!\" Mike, your dad was funny and sassy, and he made drivers ed easy and bearable any time of the year! Now, when it came to actually driving in the car, I had Mr. Perryman. He wouldn't stand for any monkey business in his car! If you acted up while behind the wheel, he threatened to take us to East Pasco and leave us there! I was also in the same class as your brother, Joey! He probably wouldn't remember me, since I hung out with the marching band crowd and he with the jocks, though. Either way, I loved RHS and being a Bomber! -Kelly Weil Austin (81) ************************************************** >>From: Julie Hannah Gilchrist (89) Seeing the recipe for cinnamon rolls reminds me of the cafeteria serving them with chili every Wednesday. When I was a sophomore or junior there was a period of a few weeks where there would be food fights every now and then. One Wednesday, some upperclassman decided it would be fun if a food fight started with the chili (not the cinnamon rolls of course). I'll never forget ducking under the table as soon as the chili started flying! It was EVERYWHERE, even on the ceiling. It was total chaos. By the time a few teachers wander upon it, it was all over. It was probably around the 86-87 school year some time. Does anyone else remember that crazy day? -Julie Hannah Gilchrist 89 *************************************** *************************************** That's it for today. Please send more. *************************************** *************************************** ****************************************************** ****************************************************** Alumni Sandstorm ~ 1/6/99 ALL Bomber Alumni Links site has had 14,517 Bomber hits. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 11 Bombers sent stuff in: Doreen Hallenbeck (51), Kay Mitchell (52), David Tampien (58), Lee Newsom (59), Howard Kirz (60), Kathy Hartnett (69), Gina Evans (70), Lauri Kraemer (77), Mike Neidhold (77), Kelly Weil (81), Erica Fletcher (89) ************************************************** >>From: Doreen Hallenbeck Waldkoetter (51) To Jane Rollison (52). You inquired about Flat Top Hill in West Richland. I lived in West Richland until two years ago (when I found the sunshine of Arizona). The top of the Hill has been purchased by a man named Hans Ripfel. He has fenced it, and plans to build a home there. He currently resides in the Laurel Hill Addition of W.R. I don't know if the cross is still there or not. Good to hear from some of the 'not so young' Bombers like the Crowders and the Myricks. I'm still looking for mailing addresses for lots of Class of '51 folks. -Doreen Hallenbeck Waldkoetter (51) ************************************************** >>From: Kay Mitchell Coates (52) To: Evelyn and Paul Crowder (46) Yes, our moms did know each other. My mom, Mildred Mitchell, worked in the late 40's and early 50's at the Richland Hardware Store, now Jennifers Bakery. She was the buyer for the gift department - one of the places other than CC Andersons, where you could buy a nice wedding present. She had a knack for ordering and arranging beautiful glassware and unique gift items, and really built that department of the store into a store of its own. Paul's mom worked there also, and they were best friends. This was my place of employment from age 15-18. I loved the job but my favorite part was being able to gift wrap all the pretty things that were going out as birthday and wedding presents. While employed there, I began buying things for my \"hope chest\". Each payday I would add items and when I married, by hope chest was overflowing. I was so excited when I began purchasing my own dishes - they were the latest thing on the market - heavy non-breakable plastic by Brookwood. The plates, bowls, cups and saucers were square!! How unique!! They came in a set with 4 of the most modern colors - dark green, lime green, burgundy and gray. Unbreakable, yes! I raised 3 kids with those dishes before I put them away for a set of Corning. My oldest son inherited them, and this weekend when I was at my great-grandson's birthday party, lo and behold - there were the dishes. Guess I made a good investment!! My Dad was Art Mitchell, head of the Transportation Dept. He kept the area roads maintained and was instrumental in the building of the dike in '48. He also was on the crew that built the runways at the old Civil Air Patrol field out by the Yakima, where he later became commander. Are you Dick Meyers sister? I know there was a Grace Meyers involved somehow in CAP. That name is really familiar. -Kay Mitchell Coates (52) ************************************************** >>From: David Tampien (58) To Doris Hackney Barott (52) Hi Doris, My name is David Tampien. I was you neighbor on the Yakima River for a few years. I was remembering that yours was the first wedding that I ever attended. Also While you and Bob were being married some of your good friends were doing your car up. I didn't know about the tradition and thought them very unkind to do that to you. The only thing I remember they wrote on your car was, \"Oh! for a breeze on Lake Louise.\" I certainly had no idea what that meant, at the time but it was such an easy phrase to remember that it's still in my current memory bank. I also was remembering that one time on the way home from school, on the bus, your boyfriend ,Bob Barott, was playing with matches in the seat behind you and I don't know if he meant to but he set your hair on fire. I remember how it just went puuff! It was out in an instant and probably only singed your hair. I was in a seat close by and the memory is still vivid after all these years. I also have fond memories of your family. I've seen John and Sharon but it's been several years now. I remember that your dad would smoke his cigar and then when it was finished he would knock the ash off and chew the rest. Since my father smoked cigars the first part was normal but when I asked him why he chewed the leftover he said, \"It keeps me from sweating while we're putting up this hay\". We helped George Harrington with his hay. I haven't heard anything about Elvira and Red but would be glad for an update. When we first moved to the farm in 1948 I remember that George Harrington took us up to Twin Bridges in his Chevrolet to catch the bus. I think it was a couple of years later when the bus came up to his place so we got the bus to the drive way. I live in Moses Lake. -david tampien (58) ************************************************** >>From: Lee Newsom (59) I just read in the sandstorm from Julie Hannah Gilchrist (89) about a crazy food fight at school. I was just wondering who had to clean up all of that crazy food? I bet I can guess. If that had happened in (59) I know who would clean it up. That is after I was again able to stand up due to all of the welts on my *** from the old spat (what is that) board. But the real crazy part is yet to come when I show up at home an face off with that even crazier dad of mine!! When he was done with me I wouldn't won't to look chili in the face for a long time. What has happened to our schools? I know I'm just glad I did mine in (59). -Lee Newsom (59) ************************************************** >>From: Howard Kirz (60) RE: Sappy stuff Loved reading Robert Kennedy's recollections of Karen Karnie's first venture into literary criticism, and her very astute diagnosis of my personal language disabilities. Have long since lost all memory of the contest itself, but I think the occasion was the ceremonies surrounding Richland's transition from federal to private ownership. (1959-60) Robert's reminiscing brought back a couple of other memories of equally important events of that year: 1) We once stuffed 18 kids into a Volkswagen bug and 2) 15 more into the telephone booth at Uptown. I'm not sure that Robert's right about the Richland Rocket Society being a scam to lure girls, but I'm absolutely certain that the Volkswagen and telephone booth capers were hormonally inspired. Anybody still got pictures? -Howard Kirz (60) ************************************************** >>From: Kathy Hartnett Mitchell (69) Just perusing the \"memories\" from 1/4/99, and it really did wake me up and bring a flood of nostalgia! Someone mentioned drugstores, I had completely forgotten the counter in the back of Thrifty in Uptown. Who remembers my dad, Gabby Hartnett? Besides umpiring almost every little league, pony and colt league, American Legion and summer - loads of softball, he also manned the camera departments of both Thrifty and Densow's. My sis, Peg, and I jokingly remember thinking that everyone must spend summer vacation in the sun-drenched cities, vacation hot-spots such as Moses Lake, Yakima, Connell, I could go on, any where there was a dusty baseball field... we were there!!! Subject #2: Inspirational teachers. I'm sure this will elicit a tirade of opinion, but I still hold Art Dawald's teaching methods personally responsible for my lack of interest in American government. I know he was working out plays for Friday night games while he sat in the back of the class. I did however have an incredibly soft spot for Mr. Hepper, I had him for typing and shorthand, even when I was at my worst (and I had my moments) he was very kind and supportive, truly my one fond teacher memory... Thanks Mike. Being an alumni of CTK also, I do have some fun nun memories, Sister Aurelia Marie's bell. There's more, I'm out of time. Still trying to track down Nancy Dutton Haverly (69), I see her on the roster, anyone have an address or phone # Thanks for the memories, -Kathy Hartnett Mitchell '69 ************************************************** >>From: Gina Evans (70) To: Mike Neidhold (77) I have great memories of our dad. I was in his sixth grade class at Lewis and Clark and also had him for driver's ed. He was and still is my most favorite teacher. My father worked for Albertson's and the family had just moved into Richland from Great Falls, Montana. My introduction into the Richland school system was in your father's class. He was the first teacher I had to use humor as a basis of teaching and believe me I loved to go to his class. I would go home telling the stories to my mom and dad. I had to do one \"time out\" in the corner of the classroom - I don't remember what I was being punished for. Probably for talking. Who cares. Anyway, the afternoon I get to do the \"stand in the corner\" routine is the same afternoon your dad invites Mr. Lane's sixth grade class from next door to come in and watch a movie. Great! I get to stand in the corner with not only my own class staring at my back but Mr. Lane's class too. Mr. Neidhold would go to the office way down the hall from the classroom and listen to us over the two-way intercom. Of course, we would get a bit rowdy and fool around. Next thing you know we would hear your dad at the end of the sixth grade hallway up by Mrs. Lester's class. Sometimes he would say something to get our attention three doors down the way and sometimes we would just hear his heavy footsteps coming down the hall ever so slowly. We knew we were in some kind of trouble then. The door to the classroom was at the back of the room and our desks were facing away from the door. He would stop for the longest time and just stand in the doorway. We would be diligently working on whatever. He would wait ever so patiently until we just couldn't stand it any longer and we would slowly start stealing peeks back at him. Then he would erupt with his big voice talking about individual students and what they said and what we were doing. At first we couldn't figure out how he knew all the details. I had Mr. Neidhold for by driver's ed. when I was a sophomore. Not only for the lecture but the actual driving too. What a bonus. As soon as I saw him I knew the class was going to be good. I had to take the driver's ed. class in the summer time so I thought it would be a drag. No way. He made the class fun and and informative. His descriptions were wonderful and fun. Then to have him as the driving instructor too! One afternoon when we were out doing our long distance driving I fell asleep in the back seat. It was hot and boring because we were basically going no where. I always fall asleep when I'm not driving even today so it was not so different for me. I was in the middle in the back snoozing away and he turned around and in his \"big\" voice said, \"I can't believe you would fall asleep and trust one of these other yahoos at the wheel. Can't you see they don't know what the heck they are doing and you fall asleep?\" I still laugh to this day. I wish I had a recorder then to record some of the funny stories. He was a great, fun teacher. My mom also worked with your mom at Kadlec Hospital for many years. I would get periodic updates on your dad. I saw him about 10 years ago at the street fair in Howard Ammon Park. I was surprised he still remembered me. Your dad is a pretty nice guy. -Gina Evans (70) ************************************************** >>From: Lauri Kraemer Serafin (77) Thanks to Darwin Perkins for the cinnamon roll recipe. I can't wait to try it, since they were my favorite at Jason Lee Elementary. I bake a SMALL batch of cinnamon rolls about once a month and haven't ever been able to duplicate them. Those rolls were so special that I had \"hot lunch\" on chili and cinnamon roll day. Just reviewing the recipe brought back that fragrant smell... Thank you. -Lauri Kraemer Serafin (77) ************************************************** >>From: Mike Neidhold (77) To: Crowder '46: That was my dad and his brother, Alan. Dad graduated in '49 and Alan in '48. Thanks for sharing. To Mike Franco (70) - thanks for sharing, Mike. I remember you and my dad having some beers at regionals when I was a kid. I think you and your buddies were in college or something like that. Dad always thought you were one of the funniest people he knew. Could any Bomber experience be complete without droops getting on your *** about a sloppy left turn? Thanks again for sharing. To Kelly Weil Austin '81 - Thanks for sharing. I heard all those sayings every day as a kid. My personal fav... you peeps. Thanks again. (joey is doing great.) -mike neidhold '77 ************************************************** >>From: Kelly Weil Austin (81) Many thanks for the cinnamon roll recipe! Even those of us who were \"brown-baggers\" managed to get our parents to foot the bill for one hot lunch a week/month when there was the infamous chili/cinnamon roll lunch. I often reminisce about this favorite with my friends and acquaintances, and they look at me like I'm nuts! \"What an odd combination!\" Maybe, but it was the best hot lunch on the planet! Now that we have the cinnamon roll recipe, anybody have the chili recipe? -Kelly Weil Austin (81) ************************************************** >>From: Erica Fletcher-Bender (89) To: Mike Neidhold (77) Hi Mike! Your Dad was my teacher for Driver's Ed during the Fall Semester of 1986. This particular class was held during ZERO hour. I was absolutely amazed at his ability to be truly hysterical at that awful hour of the morning. It really was quite incredible how he could get an entire class of grumpy, groggy teenagers LAUGHING at 7am. And as others have already mentioned, some of his one-liners were absolutely classic and are easily remembered 13 years later! Take Care, -Erica Fletcher-Bender ('89) *************************************** *************************************** That's it for today.

I remember Dave Barnett and I took a couple of gals out to watch it burn. What excitement! -Ralph Myrick ************************************************** >>From: Annette Verellen Parnell (56) I have been having fun reading how all of you loved the chili cinnamon rolls. I have been cook and now kitchen manager at RHS for 21 years. The chili and cinnamon rolls is still a favorite meal. Things have changed a lot. We now make them for Marcus, Lewis and Clark and Badger Mountain. So we make 90 gallons of chili, and 1,300 cinnamon rolls to feed the hungry kids. Chief Jo and Hanford cook for the other elementary schools. The recipe has been updated, and we use more modern methods of mixing, and we had to eliminate some of the fat, to comply with today's nutritional guidelines, but they are still great. It is nice to fix such a popular meal. It is great to read everyone's memories. Keep up the good work. -Annette Verellen Parnell (56) ************************************************** >>From: Connie Madron Hall (60) As an old Bomber cheerleader, I'm sure glad I didn't have to do the \"Give Me a U-R-I-N-E cheer\" as written in by Kelly Walsh of '77!!! Have been enjoying reading everyone's inputs and the e-mails we have received from this site. John (Hall - fellow classmate) and I have been married for 37 years this year, have one quality son who thinks we Bombers are \"definitely different.\" We have lived in Tempe, AZ for 25 years and love it here in paradise - it's 72 degrees today! Hard to beat. I try to get to Richland every four or five months to check on our mothers who still live in their little \"B\" house on Thayer and \"Ranch\" on Chestnut. Just wanted to say hi and to thank you for creating a wonderful way to escape. -Connie Madron Hall (60) ************************************************** >>From: Carol Converse Maurer (64) TO: Darwin Perkins (69) - Thanks for sending the recipe for the cinnamon rolls. I'm anxious to try them out to see how close they taste from what my memory remembers. I'm sure we will all be making them in the next few weeks. I remember a diner at the Richland Y when I was little. It was inside an old railcar. Does anyone else remember it? I don't know what the name of it was. As I remember, it was located on the left hand side of the street going into the Y. I thought it was the greatest place to go eat with my folks. Another memory that I haven't seen is in 2nd or 3rd grade learning about the Whitmans and the Mission. We made pioneer costumes and went out to the mission for a field trip. I don't know how many people have been out there in recent years, but back then, it was still the same as it had been - no fences and intercoms. Your imagination could really bring back the real thing. I don't know about the rest of the elementary schools going, but Lewis and Clark did. I still have my hat that I my mother made for me. Later, -Carol Converse Maurer (64) ************************************************** >>From: Pam Ehinger Nassen (67) To the class of 67. Has any more info. come in about the 50 party? I talked with Jess Daniels a while back, about it but have not heard a word since then. So does any one know what is going on??? I hit the big 5 0 yesterday, so now I'm official and can go to the party!! So would love to hear what's going on, or if there is something I can do to help. Just let me know! -Pam Ehinger Nassen 67 ************************************************** >>From: Vicki Schrecengost Carney (67) Just finished reading Kathy Hartnett Mitchell's (69) memories of inspirational teachers - Mr. Hepper. I, too, had Mr. Hepper for typing and shorthand (in '65). He was a very young teacher and we used to always laugh because his voice would \"crack\" all the time. His wife was expecting at that time and we used to joke that they should name a girl \"Pepper\". Boy, we were weird! My vote for inspirational teachers goes to Gene Dudley who taught 6th grade at Marcus Whitman. Did anyone else have him? Someone told me that he is still in Richland. Anyone have an address? Another inspiration was Mrs. Davis (she of the penciled eyebrows), although I lived in fear of the woman the whole year in English. I learned so much from her. I do a lot of professional writing and have her to thank for giving me the basics that have stuck with me through the years. Does anyone remember Mrs. Macy (11th grade English) with the rainbow hair? -Vicki Schrecengost Carney (67) ************************************************** >>From: Kelvin Soldat (71) The recent stories on Driver Ed bring back fond memories. I was lucky enough to have both Ray \"Droopy\" Juricich and Mr. Neidhold. They were both fantastic. I remember the first day of driving with Ray Juricich being the instructor. He chose me to be the first driver. I got behind the wheel and immediately started driving with the emergency brake on. He had me pull over and gives one of his patented \"Jeesh, What the Hell you doin? I thought you were smart?\" I replied, \"What made you think that?\" and he says, \"Well you're so damn ugly I figured you had to have something going for you!\". Everybody in the car burst out laughing, including me. Turns out I got an A in the class and later in the year I started for his JV B-ball squad that finished undefeated, first ever at Richland. He actually was a pretty good teacher and coach. -Kevin Soldat (71) ************************************************** >>From: Linda Barott Rodriguez (71) To David Tampien (58) David, I am a 71' graduate of Col-Hi and my mother is Doris Hackney Barott (52). I remember her fondly talking about the Tampiens and the Harringtons all the time. Being out in the boonies, they didn't have very many close neighbors growing up at Horn Rapids Dam. My Grandpa (nicknamed Cork) was the ditch rider for many years and I have many fond memories of having lunch under a big tree down by the Yakima River with my Grandma. I can still remember the inside of the two story house that is sadly no longer there. But in many art shows around, there are paintings and pics of the dam and the house. I deemed it quite famous and I know that my Auntie (Elvera) Verd and Uncle Red have a large painting of it in their living room and Mom has a picture of it hanging on her walls. I have never heard the story about Dad playing with matches on the bus. Can't wait to talk to him. It doesn't surprise me though, he is still feisty after all these years. I remember Grandpa always having a stogie and loving the smell, but I never saw him eat it, ick! Mom, Auntie Verd and I still attend Bethany Church in West Richland where they got married. Mom and Dad were the first to get married there. They had to hurry to finish the church for the wedding. Mom is still close to Elvera and John. They have family sing-alongs quite often singing the old tunes, reminds me of sing-along with Mitch. I guess Uncle John was called \"Little Elvis\" in his day. I still love to see him stand up with his guitar and sing the Battle of New Orleans. He really gets into it and gets his leg going like Elvis. Well, I am writing because Mom's PC is out of commission until her neighbor, who is a PC guru can get back this weekend from a trip and fixes it. I am sure she will write when she gets back on line soon but I wanted to let you know. One interesting footnote: My husband David (69) grew up on Riverside Drive in West Richland. He went into the Marine Corps that year and was in boot camp in Calif. with a young man named Rob Rivers who was Florence Harrington's son. -Linda Barott Rodriguez (71) ************************************************** >>From: Marsha Jepsen Lee (73) I've loved reading all the wonderful memories from the past. Does anyone remember Wayne from the candy counter at Densow's? I remember stopping by there everyday after school to get penny candies and bubble gum. Wayne was a gruff old guy that was always yelling at the dozens of kids that were hanging out there. Also licorice ice cream cones from the lunch counter there were great! Does anybody remember the totem pole that Mr. Swensons 6th grade class from Spalding made? Cindy Arnold (73) was the lucky winner of the totem pole and had it in her back yard for a long time. Is it still standing? As for the cinnamon rolls... I now work in the kitchen at Chief Jo. We make those cinnamon rolls all the time. But I don't think they are quite the same as the old ones. Ours are still good but the memories of the old ones seem to be better! Would love to hear from my class of 73. -Marsha Jepsen Lee (73) ************************************************** >>From: Sue Oberg Friend (79) To Mike Neidhold '77 - I had your Dad as a driving instructor back in the fall of '76 so I could be sure to get my license the second I turned 16. I remember him as a man of great patience. He would take us out in those cheesy cars to teach us how to parallel park - something that has never come naturally to me. Going out on the highway between Kennewick and Pasco was always a big deal too, but the greatest thrill was the \"Night Driving\". Once we'd driven around a while and had a pretty good feel for the car, he'd have us go into a gravel parking lot and spin a doughnut so we could feel what it was like. What a thrill for a kid. The other thing I remember about your Dad was that he had a pretty good sense of humor and didn't mind being teased. One day he came to class with a fresh haircut - a sort of Prince Valiant sort of look. I asked him if he'd just gotten his hair cut and I think he mumbled something about his wife having cut it for him. I then asked if she had just taken a bowl out of the cupboard, put it over his head and... That's when he cut me off saying, \"Hey, that'll be enough of that\". He acted all gruff, but you could see the smile in his eyes that told me he had a great sense of humor and his ego hadn't been bruised. I still give thanks to your Dad for teaching me the proper way to do a \"head check\" when changing lanes. -Sue Oberg Friend '79 ************************************************** >>From: Randy Ragsac (81) >From the RHS Guest Book Record 244 Name: Randy Ragsac Referred by: AOL From: Salinas, Ca.

I was probably one of many who gave your father a heart attack while driving. It was my turn to take the wheel and one of my class mates, Eric Thompson, (who was such a joker anyway) kept giving me crap while driving, and dingy blonde that I am I turned around to yell at him and almost hit a parked car right there on Long Avenue! Needless to say I got a little bit of a lecture from your father. He always had such a great sense of humor and made the class a lot of fun and never made you feel stressed about knowing the material he had great patience! -Kelly Flanagan Gustafson, Class of 1985 ************************************************** >>From: Jenny Loper Buchanan (87) To Mike Neidhold (77) - Your dad was my driver's ed teacher the summer of 1985. He was so entertaining! He would keep us enthralled with gruesome car accident stories, (for s"
