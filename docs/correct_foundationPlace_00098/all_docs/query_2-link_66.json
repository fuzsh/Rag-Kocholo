        "text": "I was lucky to work with Steen at Microsoft, building a new team in AI Operations. Steen was recognized for his great people management skills right away, and promoted within months of first hire. He is a dedicated manager who really cares for his team, and yet can balance the challenges of working in a dynamic and fast-paced operations environment with constant change. Steen is reliable, decisive, accountable, and inspires his team and peers to perform at their highest level of quality. He is fun to work with and is greatly missed. Thanks Steen!\n\n-Heather, Business Operations Manager, Business Architecture, Microsoft\n\nI am very fortunate to work with Steen together to build up the AI Operations Team in Microsoft. Steen is a trustworthy partner with excellent communication and management skills. Steen is a pleasure to work with. He is always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that our team / project meets its goals and objectives, and he has a positive attitude that makes him a valuable member of our team. I highly recommend Steen for any future projects or positions. He would be an asset to any organization lucky enough to have him on their team.\n\n-Terry, Artificial Operations Manager, Microsoft\n\nI've known Steen for over 10 years and managed him directly through his various roles at Big Fish Localization for eight years. As he assumed the mantle of each new role, Steen grew quickly \"into the box\" that is the role and then started to push the boundaries of those roles continuously seeking to expand his skillset and to grow himself to the next level. Steen brings a vast array of experiences which led to his success: translator/linguist, editor/tester and translation project manager - Steen has operated effectively at all levels of the localization process. An expertise that guarantees he will succeed in whatever direction he applies himself. Steen will be a valuable addition to your organization.\n\n-Matt, Senior Localization Manager, Big Fish Games\n\nIâve had the honor of working with Steen for over 8 years, and he is one of the most capable, quick, and kind people I have interacted with professionally. Our work together often included super tight deadlines and I could count on Steen 100% of the time to collect and provide the input and feedback necessary to ensure that I could deliver localized marketing assets on time. A quality I appreciate highly in Steen is his ability to complete any task, assignment, or work needed without the drama and ego that often appears and inhibits efficiency within work environments. His problem solving, forward moving, resolution motivated approaches to his position made him a joy to work with, and we connected well through our shared goal of a strong work ethic mixed with welcomed bits of timely humor.\n\n-Alicia, Outsource Manager, Big Fish Games\n\nI've known Steen for several years, both when I was working for Big Fish inhouse, and now as a French localization vendor. I highly recommend his project management and people skills: he's flexible, well organized and highly reactive, with a pinch of humour that makes him a pleasure to work with. I've also always appreciated his knowledge of software localization and of translation constraints, which enables us to always go for the best possible quality; as a translator, it's a pleasure talking to someone who understands what you do and what you need to produce quality. I think he's an asset in any localization team.\n\n-Raph, French Freelance Translator\n\nI have known Steen since 2011, when we were both localization translators at Big Fish Games. Over the years, he was promoted to become localization manager, and became my main point of contact at Big Fish for all projects sent to me, as I was by then an external localization provider. Working with Steen on localization projects is a breeze. He has a deep understanding of game localization issues, both technical and linguistic. On top of being very approachable and friendly, Steen is extremely professional. He always answered my queries very fast. He tracked the info I needed from the relevant stakeholders. He forwarded my comments to the relevant teams. And generally, he made sure that we felt part of the team and valued as freelancers, and were provided with all the tools we needed to work: reference material, technical support, and, most importantly, trust. I am confident that Steen will be an amazing fit in any team, and a great asset for the company.\n\n-Sandrine, French Freelance Translator\n\nI worked for Steen as an external localization provider for many years, first in his role as a Translation Manager, and then in his role as a Localization Manager, both for Big Fish Games. Steen always went above and beyond to make sure that I not only had clear work instructions and as much reference material as he could possibly provide but also to make sure that I was happy with any assigned project and its deadline so that I could plan my tasks according to my various clients' needs and schedules. I have rarely met anyone who was so considerate of what an external provider's need to juggle different clients and projects can mean. Steen is approachable, dedicated to excellence, a great communicator and simply a joy to work with. I cannot recommend him enough!\n\n-Kit, German Freelance Translator\n\nI had the pleasure of working with Steen for a little over 4 years at Big Fish Games, where he oversaw and managed all things related to translations and the localization process. Steen has an impeccable work ethic and the patience of a saint! There was nothing he couldn't solve or work around, always with the best attitude and a calm demeanor that made working with him a delight. I can honestly say that he was an instrumental part of the Localization team and anyone looking for a diligent and committed project manager would be lucky to have Steen in their team!\n\n-Valerie, Spanish Localization Specialist, Big Fish Games\n\nSteen is a highly dedicated and thoughtful localization manager and hiring manager.

He is going to make any team a better one by being part of it.\n\n-Michaela, German Localization Translator, Big Fish Games\n\nI have been working as an external Spanish Linguist for Bigfish for the last four years. During this time Steen has been my Project Manager and main contact.

He treats the linguists with respect and true empathy, while at the same time keeping everybody informed and on schedule. He is one of a kind!\n\n-Gilga, Spanish Freelancer Translator\n\nI had a pleasure to work with Steen within the Localization group at Big Fish Games.I was always impressed with Steen's patience with training and on-boarding new localization QA testers as well as his ability to be in control of any challenging situation or project given to the team. Steen has a great attention to detail and knack for resolving technical challenges. He was stellar localization QA tester that received constant praise from management and other teams and it has been great to see him move up in his career.\n\n-Alisa, Localization Coordinator and Producer, Big Fish Games\n\nI got to know Steen at Big Fish Games, when I started there in 2010. At the time he worked as an editor on the International-Danish team. I was hired to do the same job, but instead for Dutch. I quickly learned that Steen was a great person to learn from since he is very thorough and precise. He is willing to help and can explain well.In the years that I stayed at Big Fish, we both got promoted into different roles, in which we still worked together on a daily basis.I would recommend Steen to anyone.

Steen showed himself as an extremely reliable and efficient editor and translator, willing to work on the project that were most important for the team at a particular time, often under considerable time pressure. Being a very reliable team member, he was able to juggle the priorities and produce timely translations and test reports. During my time with Big Fish Games, Steen showed a tremendous learning abilities and was able to take on new challenges and responsibilities which resulted in fast professional growth. I would be delighted to have an opportunity to work with Steen again and would recommend him to any team.\n\n-Irina, Localization Coordinator, Big Fish Games\n\nSteen is the kind of person you want to have in your team.
