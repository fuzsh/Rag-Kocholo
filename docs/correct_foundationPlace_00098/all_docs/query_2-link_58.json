        "text": "They are now offering certain packages at a certain price like you get 289 million coins 52,000 gold bars for $49.99 but when you go to purchase it you're not getting that you're getting just a regular package for that price And you can tell that they are controlling the slots at no payout rate I have tons of videos of them cheating the system they're collecting extra cash and Apple. For instance, does nothing about it. They will not return your money even if you can show them that they're wrong they don't care they won't give you your money back, they have side games that you play but you have to bet billions to even move an inch on the sidebar game to win something like a chest a low level chest they make it impossible so that you have to purchase and then they control what you win which is nothing?\n\nTip for consumers:\n\nNow are the worst app on or available and Apple will not refund any money they take more money than they should. When you haven’t even purchased it’s their word against yours and they don’t care. Them and Bigfish casino are in cahoots.\n\nProducts used:\n\nNa\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nQuality\n\nI have had 3 billing issues with bigfish. They send my invoice for 6.99 in AUD dollars. They take out the American amount. I have tried endlessly to have this rectified. All falling on deaf ears. My membership runs out in 2 weeks I think I will cancel my membership. I have sent them 7 emails in 3 weeks with no response. I have updated my account to say AUD but it keeps taking out the wrong amount every time. I have asked for someone to contact me and give me the instructions in case there is something I am missing. I am sick of the silence. Please don't use them They owe me over $20 and won't accept responsibility. SO, I shall go elsewhere. One consultant said they didn't care. I wish there was a game site in Australia that has the same games.\n\nTheir games are very tight but not at first as they \"lure\" u in. Once ur in that's when they get you. Games will be very hard to win. Buying chip packages can get pricey. And DONT contact customer support. I just did & had a slight typo where I complained bout them say all the time \"they punch luck or chance\" that was the typo it should have been \"push luck & chance\" when there is none. They removed me from playing. I said no curse words I simply had a typo & they were quick to remove. I highly do not recommend this company whatsoever. They \"bully\" you,,, and you have no freedom of speech as I cannot make a complaint. Please go to a different place to play. This company has also been sued & lost twice. Do research. They make $150+ Million a year. That's stealing money from customers. Read what I wrote. You can see I had a typo they took wrong way. Does it look like I said something wrong?\n\nTip for consumers:\n\nPLEASE AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS\n\nProducts used:\n\nChips bought for game play. $100’s of dollars spent by many people. This is supposed to be non gaming site???\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nReturns\n\nQuality\n\nBig fishes poker feature hs been either running slow or can't connect at all for over 30 days. After numerous emails by me and 100s of friends on the site nothing has been done AND when you do email you get a computer generated letter that doesn't speak to anything you've asked. There's no customer service phone # to call after 10 years I think it's time to move on. They seem to have no clue to fix it. They have the capability to message all players, yet not one word of what's going on. Besides the slots are fixed, you'll be hard pressed to win anything. If I could give them 0 stars I would\n\nProducts used:\n\nNone\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nReturns\n\nQuality\n\nBig fish games is a total scam. I won 131.00 and went to cash out and was told the hours were 8-2pm. It was 242pm. I was told to message again then and to take down my request on cash app. From 830-354pm I messaged back and forth and was repeatedly told to try again during hours. I sent another request on cashapp. They then proceeded to suspend my account with them. They take their time. Steal small amounts you don't think you'll notice. Make you wait hours or days to be paid out. Or completely empty out your account with a glitch then say it was not their fault and try to blame you. Don't do it.\n\nNow you might think that I'm a bot or someone who works with big fish games, but I'm actually like you, I saw so many bad reviews about this company about \"scamming\" and \"coupons codes\" and I wanted to test that by myself, so I downloaded big fish games launcher and I bought 3 childhood games I used to play them when I was a child: Alice Greenfingers, Farm Mania and Youda Farmer. I couldn't believe that this company have these very old games that we all used to play them as kids, so I downloaded them and I played the demo version and of course they let you try the game before buying it, so I played them and I finished the demo and then bought them all, I added my visa card info and bought without any issue, not like these other reviews claim, and the support? They have a really nice and amazing support team, they can help you with any issue you face or any help you need. Now for the part of the people who lost their accounts it's because they broke the rules. How did they do that? Now big fish games gives a free coupon code for new users (1 time only) but these people wanted to abuse it and try to get multiple codes to activate it in the same account and to be honest they deserved the punishment, which made these users get mad and make a fake bad reviews against this company and of course also they will get their friends and alt accounts to make more fake reviews\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nReturns\n\nQuality\n\nAs an avid enthusiast of coding and technology, my recent interaction with [Company Name] has left me grappling with an overwhelming sense of shame and regret. In an era where innovation and precision are paramount in the coding realm, my experience with this company has been a disheartening deviation from the norm.\n\nFrom the outset, it became apparent that the coding practices employed by [Company Name] were subpar, to say the least. The lines of code resembled a chaotic tapestry, devoid of the elegance and structure that defines a well-crafted program. This lack of attention to detail extended beyond mere aesthetics; it infiltrated the functionality of the software, resulting in a user experience that was marred by glitches, errors, and inexplicable hiccups.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder how a company operating in the coding domain could produce such a haphazard product. It raises questions about their commitment to quality, professionalism, and their understanding of the very foundation upon which their business is built – code. As someone who appreciates the artistry of coding, it was disheartening to witness the neglect and indifference with which [Company Name] approached their craft.\n\nWhat compounded my sense of shame was the realization that I, as a consumer and advocate for quality coding, had unwittingly become entangled with a company that fell short of the standards I hold dear. I should have exercised greater due diligence in evaluating their track record and scrutinizing their coding practices before engaging in any form of collaboration.\n\nThe shame I feel is not only a reflection of my misplaced trust but also a recognition of the responsibility we bear as consumers to demand excellence from those we choose to support. In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, settling for mediocrity is not only detrimental to individual projects but also contributes to the erosion of industry standards.\n\nIn conclusion, my regretful association with [Company Name] has left an indelible mark on my perception of coding-based enterprises. It serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of thorough research and scrutiny when aligning oneself with companies in the coding arena. As a community, we must hold each other accountable for maintaining the integrity and excellence that define our craft.\n\nREFERENCE IN IMAGE.\n\nTip for consumers:\n\nNo ipad\n\nProducts used:\n\niPAd\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nReturns\n\nQuality\n\nThis game used to be fun and they say the odds are just like a real casino but I've been to a real casino many times and you win at least once or twice in the past two years out of the 15. I've been a member list last two years have been the WORST! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NONEXISTENT HALF THE TIME AND YOU WOULD THINK ANYWHERE FROM 500 TO 900 A MONTH IN A GAME. YOU COULD KEEP A LITTLE BIT OF CHIPS ABSOLUTELY NOT! FUNNY HOW IN OTHER CASINO GAMES YOU ACTUALLY CAN ACQUIRE BILLIONS AND THEN OF COURSE LOSE IT BECAUSE YOU'RE CARELESS, BUT YOU AT LEAST WIN THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY ZERO WINS IF YOU HAPPEN TO WIN BY CHANCE IT'S TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AWAY AND YOU CAN TELL IF YOU RECORD HOW THEY DO THAT! I think they should treat their VIP members that spend quite a bit of money. They keep their app going in there, plus few workers in support working with more respect! And you a little better with what they give you,in there, they say VIP program is malarkey, and if something goes wrong in the app, you damn near, have to bring God down to prove it to them! Don't don't waste your money, nor your time there are other apps out there that truly truly charge very little for their coin packages and you actually win and have a fun time, there yet you don't have to buy you actually win that's all! Have a good day!\n\nTip for consumers:\n\nThey are criminals!\n\nService\n\nValue\n\nReturns\n\nGood selection of games, GREAT prices, no malware or ads. I have purchased over 10 games from them and have never had a problem. I have changed computers a couple times and was able to easily re-download my games. I like that they let you \"try before you buy\"\n\nYou have to join their club to get discounted price on games, but you can cancel it as soon as you download your game... then just start it again when you want another game. Or stay with the membership and get special deals from them.\n\nNow on day 15 waiting for tech support. After (now) literally weeks receiving links to their FAQ's I have received the following support ticket reply. 15 days and they tell me there will be a delay to their next response. 15 days and they have kept my money. 15 days and they have done nothing to resolve their issue. I have even told them exactly what steps THEY need to take to get my games working...\n\nThank you for writing back to us.\n\nThank you for your patience and for providing relevant information. I'm escalating this to our senior team so we can figure out the next steps. Please know we are currently receiving a high volume of tickets, and unfortunately, there will be a delay with our next response. We are working through these tickets as quickly as possible and will get back to you as soon as we're able.\n\nThank you for your understanding. Have a great weekend.\n\nRegards,\n\nRyan N.\n\nTip for consumers:\n\nEverything is ok until you have a problem - then it takes many many days before you receive a 'form letter' response. You then need to go back into their (lack of) tech support system to try to resolve the problem.\n\nI am at 15 days and counting and I have just been informed that their response may be delayed - I am not surprised that they recently lost a class action lawsuit, and I am waiting to sign up to the next one.\n\nIf you want to buy a game to play today, buy them elsewhere.\n\nProducts used:\n\nGames\n\nQuality\n\nI like this site a lot. The membership isn't worth it to me. I only download about 1 game a month, maybe 2 if there is a sale going on. But I love the fact they give you a an hour trial on all their games so you can try before you buy. Plus they've started releasing iPhone games as well. My favorite are hidden object games and they have quite a wide variety. My only complaint is that I wish the prices were a little lower. But I wish that about a lot of things. Overall I like the site."
