This book has been a long journey. First of all, I wish to acknowledge the pioneer efforts of authorities like Maj. Gen. George Younghusband, who wrote the ﬁrst book on the modern game, and Mr. James Moray Brown, the editor of the ﬁrst genuine compendium of polo. After Mr. Moray Brown’s premature death, the Rev. Thomas Dale carried on his work, both as editor of subsequent editions of the Badminton Library volume on polo and with his own writings, which culminated with the sumptuous Polo at Home and Abroad. Those early writers have marked the starting point for all subsequent polo historians. I wish to thank in particular Mr. Nigel à Brassard, who went to considerable trouble on my behalf on several occasions and who kindly wrote the foreword for this book. Lady Susan Reeve was not only my most important link to South African polo, but she also became a friend and a constant source of support. Mr. James Ashton and Mrs. Rosemary Foot, Jim Ashton’s children, kindly lent me photographs of their father and the Australian Goulburn polo team. I am especially indebted to Mr. Chris Ashton for all the references from his magniﬁcent Geebung. I could never hope to improve his prose; the only solution was to quote him if the chapters touching polo in Australia were to have more than a shade of authority. Mr. Roger Chatterton-Newman, once eminent editor of Polo Quarterly International, was ever willing to answer my multiple questions and to help when I sought assistance regarding ﬁne points of the game in the British Isles. I am greatly indebted to Mr. and Mrs. George DuPont for the freedom to use many photographs from the National Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame collection and for their invariably cordial welcome during my frequent visits to the museum. I would also add my gratitude to Alex Pacheco, a talented photographer, for taking some of the photographs for this book. Dr. Alberto Pedro Heguy helped me understand a lot more about Argentine polo, especially the high-goal variety. A meeting with Alberto Pedro is on my agenda on every visit to Buenos Aires. Charles Llewellen Palmer was generous with time and effort, particularly so with regard to the 9th Lancers’ and 10th Hussars’ histories and his loan of photographs. Sinclair Hill shared his thoughts on contemporary polo through candid and extensive correspondence.\n\nix\n\nx\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nMiguel Novillo Astrada, polo player extraordinaire, voiced his opinions on the current polo scene in Argentina, England and the United States from a top professional player’s point of view. During our long conversations, Miguel demonstrated a sharp intellect and a ﬁrm grasp of many issues confronting polo today. Fred Fortugno, wherever we met, was always a friend who went out of his way to help. I particularly remember him looking after Martha and me during our stay at Aiken. To these names I must add my dear friend the late Thomas Burke Glynn. I was always amazed at his recall. His twinkling eyes and wonderful conversation are sorely missed. Through the years, many personalities in the polo community have shared their thoughts on the game. All the outstanding players and observers of the game I met were remarkably patient with me, as well as providing entertaining and illuminating company. Thank you to: Mariano Aguerre, Dr. Enrique Braun Estrugamou, Dr. Alejandro Castro Almeyra, the late Carlos de la Serna, the late Heriberto Duggan, Norberto Fernández Moreno, the late Tommy Garrahan, Celestino Garrós, Juan Carlos Harriott, Jr., the late Horacio Heguy, Dr. Jorge MacDonough, David Miles, the late Dr. Emilio Montaña Cruz, John Nelson, Alfonso, Alvaro, Gonzalo and Paul Pieres, Dr. Ernesto Pinto, the late Dr. Eduardo Pondé, Jorge Torres Zavaleta and Marcos Uranga, in Argentina. In Australia: Patrick and Jo Dawkins, Leonard Hamersley, and Nigel and Mollie Lacey. In England: Hugh and Margie Brett, Buff and Liza Crisp, Tony and Jill Emerson, Tony and Jean Lacey, Mrs. Lucy Lewis, the late Nigel Miskin, David and Mary Ann Wingﬁeld and Col. David Woodd. In the United States: Santiago “Tato” Alvarez, Dennis Amato, Sebastián Amaya, Lester “Red” Armour, Bruce Balding, the late Alan Corey, Russell Corey, John Goodman, Carlos Gracida, Julian Hipwood, Skey and Gill Johnston, Nick Manifold, Peter Orthwein, Steve Orthwein, Peter Rizzo, Raúl Roldán, Frédéric Roy, the late Bob Skene, Charles Smith, Mike Teitelbaum, Alex Webbe, Bill Whitehead, and Paul and Sheldon Withers. I hasten to add that I have had help from a large number of persons, including the staff at the Pequot Library in Southport and Fairﬁeld University’s DiMenna-Nyselius Library, both in Connecticut. Many others, not named, have assisted me; I hope they will not be offended if they are not in the list. I also wish to thank collectors of polo art who allowed items in their collections to serve as illustrations in this work, many of which have not been published before. I must respect their wish to remain anonymous. My appreciation to Sonja Norgaard for allowing me to use one of her photographs. A word of appreciation to my habitual companions in watching games at Palm Beach: Peter and Elisabeth Grace, Robert and Mary Ann Mountford, John and Marilyn Perakos, and Frank and Trude Vlahovic. They always offer interesting conversation and thoughtful insights about the game. My long-time coworker, Mrs. Marge Hickey, was once more recalled to editing duties. Thanks to her for a superior job, as always. Finally, a word of thanks to my father, one of those among the polo-playing band of estancieros of an age gone by, who taught me, among a host of other things, how to appreciate this great game. The support and encouragement of my family were essential. I am especially indebted to our son, Patrick, who prepared the photographs and illustrations and helped with the production of the ﬁnal manuscript, and to our daughter, Gisèle, for her search of books and other printed material. I am deeply grateful to my wife, Martha, for her patience and help in providing a household atmosphere conducive to creative writing. Without her help, this or any other book I have written would not have been completed.\n\nForeword by Nigel à Brassard This book, which I warmly commend to all lovers of the game of polo, tells the story of how the game has evolved over the centuries. The tale is a magisterial account of the game sweeping down the centuries and criss-crossing continents. Dr. Horace A. Laffaye is arguably the greatest ever authority on the history of polo and is also an acute commentator on the modern game. I will never forget when I recommended a researcher at the Public Record Ofﬁce in London to Dr. Laffaye. The researcher, with a mixture of admiration and gentle despair, remarked to me on Dr. Laffaye’s tireless pursuit of accuracy.This attention to accuracy and detail is one of the hallmarks of this scholarly work. This book is the ﬁfth that Dr. Laffaye has written about polo. Each is distinguished by being authoritative and comprehensive and by demonstrating the incisive insights of someone who has a deep love and knowledge of the game. In some ways this book shows that no sport has changed so much as polo. Yet it might also be said that no game has seemed to change so little. Certain aspects of the game — a mounted player trying to hit a ball through a pair of goal posts — have remained constant. And yet, as Dr. Laffaye chronicles, so many aspects of the game have changed, often reﬂecting the community in which the game was played. The contrasts between the army ofﬁcers who ﬁrst brought polo to Britain, the amateurs of the inter-war years, and the modern day professionals could not be more marked. I detect who I think Dr. Laffaye’s heroes might be. Most sports and games have writers that are indelibly associated with their character and essence. One thinks of Bernard Darwin on golf, George Plimpton and Norman Mailer on boxing, John Updike and Roger Angell on baseball and C.L.R. James and Neville Cardus on cricket. I believe that polo has now found its own distinctive voice: a voice that combines an encyclopedic knowledge of the game’s development and its characters, and the lucid examination of the vagaries of the modern game. Polo is truly lucky to have found someone with the knowledge, understanding and passion that Dr. Laffaye has for this the greatest of games. London, June 2009 Nigel à Brassard plays polo at Cirencester Park and is patron of the Courtenay and Band of Gypsies polo teams. He is captain of the Bucks Club Polo Team and a member of the Hurlingham Club, a member of the Finance and Grants Committee of the Hurlingham Polo Association, an ambassador of the Federation of International Polo and a director of Cirencester Park Polo Club.\n\n1\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPreface This book traces the development of polo from its origins as a folk game played by tribesmen in Asia to the current crop of professional players. It was with a mixture of relish and reverence that I approached writing this work. Relish because of the enjoyment that research gives me; reverence because the chronicle of polo abounds with human elements that reﬂect the best in mankind: honor, competition, achievement, friendship. I hasten to add that in spite of occasional bouts of hero worship, the overall attitude is more analytical than reverential. Based upon newly found documentation, several episodes in the game’s history that over the years have been taken at face value are vigorously challenged. This book is intended to evoke a certain classical tradition and respect for the game’s heritage. Polo is a game that started centuries ago in the rugged landscape of central Asia and now has spread throughout the world. It is played by men, women and children, mounted on true ponies and thoroughbred racehorses, on dusty paddocks and green ﬁelds, on bare grounds and in large stadiums. The competition might be for a priceless trophy or just to enjoy the pleasure of play, but the intensity and the will to win are equal. At its most basic, polo is a simple game, and that is one of its attractions. A group of players of any age, strength and degree of skill can have fun scrambling around on a ground, occasionally bumping into each other, just trying to hit a ball through a pair of goal posts. No sporting pastime could be so elemental and so easy to enjoy. Therefore, it is inconceivable that a single individual invented such a game as polo. There is, however, a huge difference when comparing polo to other games: the horse. What separates polo from other ball games is the equine component. Another of the game’s allurements is that its art and skills can take a lifetime to learn and appreciate. How and when to turn on the ball; the multiple angles that come into play in a knock-in; the right time to leave the ball and take the player, the lovely arc of the ball when a powerful hitter smacks a penalty shot: every one of these requires time to absorb and enjoy. It is time well spent. Much polo history that concentrates on matches won and lost most likely shows only a limited sense of how the game was developed, particularly within a sociological context. This book consists of much more than games lost and won. While not stingy on the detail of which teams played, who won, who lost and why, it is also a social narrative as seen through the ﬁlter of time. It intends to provide a sense of the varied and fascinating human environment in which polo developed through centuries of ups and downs. It is a story of hills and valleys about a game played on a surface as ﬂat as a billiard table. It is less history, more of an evoca-\n\n3\n\n4\n\nPREFACE\n\ntive essay. This portrait of polo perhaps has extra passion because the game was a giant in my childhood memories. Polo literature and art reﬂects the way the game has changed. Thus, several mentions are devoted to the written word and the plastic arts to examine the game’s evolution through the passage of time as seen by gifted writers and artists. Evolution means change, but people — especially older gentlemen — are by nature reluctant to change, with the notable exception of those who are endeavoring to modify and improve things. The ruling hierarchies of polo have always been conservative in their approach to new ideas. In spite of such attitude, probably the only thing that has not changed in centuries is the width of the goal, which still is 24 feet, or 7.30 meters between the goal posts. Another thing that is still the same is a player’s emotions when he misses the ball. The game of polo has changed signiﬁcantly in many aspects. Just as Americans were prepared to use sports as a metaphor for life and Britons took games along another path, treating simple pastimes not as games but as a sort of moral improvement, the current reality in many games, including polo, is the massive investment of money. Sports and games have become more entertainment than pastime, at least at the top level. This work is not a history of the game. The deﬁnitive history of polo remains to be written and it will probably be a massive, multi-authored work. This book tries to be analytical, often judgmental, in looking at how powerful men and institutions tended to modify things, but more often remained immobile in the quagmire of tradition and fear of change. In spite of that conservative attitude, or perhaps because of it, change has occurred. However, it was usually individuals who spearheaded revolution, not institutions. Special attention is given to the changes that have occurred in the last century, in tactics developed by thoughtful thinkers and applied by outstanding teams in their quest for success, mostly through trial and error. The evolution of the laws, from mobs engaged in a free-for-all melee to the current free ﬂowing and largely open, speedy game, is also a subject of curious attention. Folk games were subject to a sort of common law, a lex non scripta. Nowadays, most rules read like a legal treatise. Finally, the development of that imprescriptible companion, the polo pony, merits a description in some detail. Equus caballus is the animal force that nicely complements the graceful rider and classic striker of the ball. The symbiosis of man and mount contributes to make the ancient pastime of polo the most elegant of games. It always was, and it shall remain so forever.\n\nPART I : THE TRIBESMEN\n\n1. Folk Games: From the Silk Road to the Manipuri Valleys Polo has continued its ceaseless gallop into the future. From the dim, impenetrable recesses of time, the mounted ﬁgure of this sport came cantering into the pages of our ﬁrst histories and has gone swinging along ever since, side by side with the march of man, oblivious to changing fashions and changing nations, remaining always the calm patrician of sport.— Robert F. Kelley1\n\nThe origins of the game of polo are shrouded in the mist of history. China, Iran, Manipur, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Tibet all claim to be the birthplace of polo. It can be safely assumed that it began as a simple folk game played by the nomadic tribes in central Asia. Westward and eastward expansion followed, to Byzantium and China, most likely along the trail of the legendary Silk Road. Southwards, the game moved into Tibet, India, Assam, Manipur and Burma, now Myanmar. As to the word polo, it derives from the Tibetan po-lo or po-long, in reference to a ball made of willow, but also applied to the playing ﬁeld or the game itself. Ancient folk games, precursors of many modern sports, were characterized by several different factors, regardless of whether the mode was equestrian or pedestrian. There was wide variation regarding the number of participants, the ground’s size and shape, the amusement’s time span, and its regulations. Folk games were a deeply ingrained custom in most communities. A form of lacrosse among Native Americans, knappan in Pembrokeshire, Shrovetide football in Ashbourne, hurling in southwest England and Ireland, golﬁng precursors such as pall-mall and kolf in Europe, mounted games in Asia and, more recently, the game of pato in South America had a large following, either as spectators or participants. It was usual for most of a village’s inhabitants to show up for the game. Dunning and Sheard in their Barbarians, Gentlemen and Players, a seminal work on rugby football’s sociology, quote Sir Richard Carew: “There was also a rudimentary division of labour within each team into which Carew, using a contemporary military analogy, called a ‘fore-ward,’ a ‘rere-ward,’ and two ‘wings.’”2 Sir Richard also mentioned a division into players on horseback and players on foot. This is interesting sociologically since it suggests that in these folk pastimes, elements of what were later to become separate games — in this case, hurling and polo — were rolled together in a single whole.3 The rules of folk games were unwritten and quite simple; they were consuetudinary or common law, legitimized by oral tradition and enforced by the participants themselves. They\n\n5\n\n6\n\nPART I : THE TRIBESMEN\n\nwere also characterized by numerous variations based upon regional structures, such as the ball’s size and shape, or in the case of more gruesome games, the animal carcass used as the token, be it a duck, or a headless goat or calf. There was wide variation regarding the ﬁeld of play. The existing polo ground at Shardu, in Baluchistan — a state between Afghanistan and Pakistan — that dates back several centuries is quite narrow and its four sides are bordered by stone walls. At the other end of the spectrum, if two villages competed, the grounds would be the land between the two towns; the winners were the ones who took the ball — or goat — to the opposing village. Folk games were ﬁrmly entrenched in many societies. Proﬁciency in these primitive games was rewarded with a higher social status and perhaps even an early form of hero-worship. Throughout the game’s early stages, the important thing was participation, either in active form, or vicariously as passive players or just interested spectators. Only two aspects seem to have been relatively constant: one was the manner of starting a game, usually the ball being thrown up in the air by a strong individual, and the second was related to a goal and, therefore, a determination of a winner. In the case of polo’s predecessors, the humble folk game eventually enjoyed royal patronage. The earliest written mention of the game in a 7th century work4 appears to conﬁrm that the ﬁrst patrons of polo were the rulers of the Parthian dynasty, who were in power from 247 B.C.E. until 224 C.E. The royal support of polo was continued in Persia by the Turkic and Mongol rulers in the 11th century. Members of the Safanid dynasty, who ruled Persia after the Mongols, were reported by the English traveler Sir Anthony Shirley as superior polo players.5 The game then went into a decline until the waning years of the 19th century, when two other Englishmen, Sir Horace Rumbold and Maj. Percy Molesworth Sykes, later Brig. Gen. Sir Percy Sykes, brought the modern version of the game to Persia. From central Asia, the game of polo initially spread both eastward and westward. To the west, it was carried through the empire of Byzantium to Constantinople, now Istanbul, where it was played during the 4th century. Emperor Theodosius II, who ruled from 408 to 450, had a stadium —tzykanistérion— constructed within the Constantinople Grand Palace’s walls for better enjoyment of the game, a plan of which is illustrated in Carl Diem’s book.6 Emperor Manuel I Comnenos (ruled 1143–1180) was an ardent supporter of polo. A description of a game is given by Johannes Cinnamus, who wrote about it in 1190.7 Two teams played with a leather ball the size of an apple. The sticks ended with a hoop, to which was attached a net of strings, resembling a racket. Interestingly enough, a similar instrument was used in Japan, which is difﬁcult to explain because of the long distance involved. In no other Asiatic region was the game played with such equipment. From Persia the ancient game was imported into Baghdad, Damascus and Egypt around 800 C.E., while Saladin (r. 1169–1193), the Crusaders’ feared adversary, was known to be a polo enthusiast. In the Arabian work History of the Mameluke Sultans in Eg ypt by Take-EddinAhmed-Makrizi, there is a lengthy note about those rulers and their involvement with polo.8 It is intriguing that the Arabs who invaded Spain did not bring the game along with their magniﬁcent horses. These early forms of polo only had a remote resemblance to the modern game. In a variation known as Buzkashi, there were hundreds of participants, the winner being the horseman who had the courage to get hold of a headless goat by a leg and carry the carcass away from the pack. In another form similar to the modern game, the teams could be formed by up to 1,000 horsemen each, and the round ball, the gui, was the size of a man’s head. At both\n\n1. Folk Games\n\n7\n\nends of the ground, there were stone pillars as goals. The ball was hit at with a wooden stick, called chowgIn— the game’s name in Persian language — and the game continued until the ball was destroyed. The oldest existing goal posts, dating from the 17th century, which are located in the central square — Naghsh-é-Jahan — in Isfahan, Iran, are 24 feet wide, precisely the distance formulated in the current laws of the game. They are made of stone, seven feet high, topped by a design resembling a bishop’s miter. The second oldest goals are located in India, near the city of Bidar, some 80 miles northwest of Hyderabad. It has been estimated that they are at least 380 years old. The two sets of stone goal posts are seven and a half feet high with a circular base ﬁve feet, six inches in diameter, from which pillars rise. The distance between the bases is 11 feet, and between the sides of the pillars, 13 feet. They are, then, approximately half the width of Isfahan’s goalposts. The ground’s length between the posts is about 500 yards, precisely 407 paces as measured by Leslie M. Crump, an ofﬁcial at The Residency in Hyderabad, who reported his ﬁndings in The Polo Monthly.9 They are set in an east-west direction, which was the goals’ traditional setting. The ground’s width was estimated to be less than 200 yards, based upon the location of some buildings. This disproportion is not surprising, because it mirrors the smaller grounds in northern India and Pakistan, where the narrow valleys mandated such conﬁguration. Local tradition is that this is the polo ground of the Bahmani kings. The tradition is that when Kasim Barid, who was the Barid dynasty’s ﬁrst ruler succeeding the Bahmanis (he did not take the title shah), began to look for a site for his tomb, he chose a place overlooking the polo ground so that even in death he might watch the game he loved so well. This appears to be the reason why his tomb, and that of his successor, Ali Barid Shah, are not enclosed by a wall like those of the Bahmanis, but were constructed with open arches. Mr. Crump wrote: “The names of Kasim Barid and Ali Barid Shah, who were both buried so as to overlook their polo ground, deserve enshrining in the roll of polo enthusiasts.”10 The exact date of the polo ﬁeld and posts cannot be determined. The Barid kings ruled Bidar from 1487 until 1619. The game was taken with the Mohammedan invasion that captured the city of Gulburga in 1323 and in 1347 established the Bahmanis, who later transferred the capital to Bidar. If this is an accurate assumption, the goalposts date back 650 years, and if constructed by the latest Barids, they are 380 years old. The game’s progress eastwards, towards the Celestial Empire, Indochina, Korea and Japan, was most likely along the Silk Road. According to Edward Parker, polo was introduced into China by the Tartars. Professor Parker states that the earliest speciﬁc mention of polo dates to the year 710, when the emperor assembled his courtiers at a retreat known as the Pear Orchard.11, 12 Under the T’ang dynasty (618–907), polo beneﬁted from imperial benevolence and several rulers were practitioners of the game, especially Ming Huan, who was mentioned as infatuated with the sport. The artist Li Kung-lin depicted him playing polo with his notorious consort Yang Kuei-fei. His devotion to polo is also remembered in a poem, which disloyally also mentions his return to the palace from a game under the inﬂuence of drink. An article in the October 1903 issue of the Asiatic Quarterly Review mentions moon sticks or clubs used in the game, an obvious reference to the early polo mallets illustrated in the Badminton Library volume on polo.13 By then the game was more organized. The teams aligned about 16 players each, while the targets were named east and west goals. Gongs were sounded to signal that a goal had been scored. Besides the dangers inherent in a vigorous pastime, polo carried other unexpected risks. Emperor T’ai Tsu of the Posterior Liang dynasty (907–921) became rather upset after one of\n\n8\n\nPART I : THE TRIBESMEN\n\nhis relatives had a fall and was killed. The enraged ruler had all participants in the game, friend and foe alike, executed without further ado. During the Song dynasty (960–1279), Confucian scholars articulated their doubts about the game of polo: “Polo is akin to heavy drinking, gambling, popular music, licentious conduct, and other forms of immoral activities.”14 Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose. The Juche or Nüchên (early Manchus) emperors who succeeded the Cathayans and who are mentioned by Marco Polo under the name Chorené are frequently described in Chinese history as players of polo. The Mongols, who were great falconers and archers, are not mentioned as polo players; neither is the Ming Chinese dynasty (1368–1644) that in turn deposed the Mongols. The rules of the game demanded that the ball should be struck only when galloping — beware current proponents of tapping the ball at a walk — and the game was subject to a certain unspoken etiquette rather than a written code. Etiquette is a much more controlling power in Eastern culture than all regulations in Western societies. Breakage of the unwritten but customary laws was met by scorn. At times, it was customary to allow one player, unimpeded, to throw the ball in the air in the middle of the ﬁeld and to hit it towards the opposing goal. A witness relates a case in which one player disobeyed the code of conduct, hustling the hitter, only to be met by verbal abuse from other players and the spectators’ jeers.15 In 727, a match was played at the court of Japan’s emperor. It was a different version, with seven-a-side players, each team distinguished by red or white badges. However, the difference was that each player had a similar colored ball in his racket; the object was to throw each ball into a net. When one side netted seven balls, the game’s second phase began. A paper ball covered with bamboo ﬁber was thrown into the ground and both teams endeavored to place the ball through a one foot, two inch hole in a board, ﬁve feet from the ground, thus winning the game, which was restricted to no more than half an hour. A modern version is still played in the city of Hachino-he.16 Mika Mori has recorded in her book on Japanese polo that Persian ponies were imported to Japan by Shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune, who ruled from 1716 until 1745.17 Polo arrived in India from Persia with the Mughal conquerors in the 13th century and became quite fashionable at the court of the emperors. Akbar the Great (1542–1605) was considered to be an outstanding polo player; whether this is true or just a form of ﬂattery, it will never be known. It is also reported that Akbar enjoyed playing polo at night, with a ball made of Butea frondosa (Flame of the Forest) wood, which is very light and burns slowly for a long period of time. No mention is made of any damage to the mallets.18 Akbar’s principal polo ground was located at Gharíwálí, some four miles from Agra — the Taj Mahal’s site — and later at Nagarchin, also located close to Agra. There is an often-reproduced scene of Akbar playing with his courtiers.19 Moray Brown notes that the artist must have been a conscientious Muslim because he strictly followed the Koran’s precepts, which forbid the depiction of features; in the drawing, the faces of both men and horses are left blank. It is a worrisome fact that polo is a dangerous game. In a back lane in Lahore’s Anarkalli bazaar there is a small monument, the grave of Sultan Kutub-ud-Din Aibak, better known as the builder of the Kutub Tower at Delhi, who in 1206 died as the result of a polo accident. History says he received fatal injuries from violent contact with his saddle. Sultan Kutub’s death was one of earliest recorded fatalities on a polo grounds. The game gradually disappeared from the main Indian scene. By the mid–19th century, it was played in two widely distant locations: in the upper Indus valley, in remote areas such\n\n1. Folk Games\n\n9\n\nas Baltistan, Chitral, Gilgit and Ladakh, and in Manipur, a small state tucked between Assam and Burma. It is to Manipur that our story will move on later. There are many mentions of the game of polo in ancient literature. Firdusi,20 in his epic poem Sháhnámah, as well as Mahmoud Ariﬁ in his Book of Ecstasy, also known as The Ball and the Polo Stick, repeatedly used metaphors to emphasize their writing. Abul Fazl, Emperor Akbar’s court historiographer, extolled polo’s virtues as a means of learning promptitude and decision, as well as a test of a man’s value and courage. In the celebrated Arabian Nights, polo is the subject of two stories. Nizami, a Persian poet, describes how the beautiful Shirin, wife of Khusrau Parviz, together with her ladies-in-waiting, played a game against the king and his courtiers: “Seventy maidens like lionesses presented themselves before Shirin, all blazing with ardor. The maidens were seated in their saddles like cypresses. They all had moonlike faces veiled, and thus proceeded into the Shah’s presence. The king of kings was overcome at seeing them.” There are many examples of early polo depicted in Oriental paintings and sculptures. Some of the best known is a series of murals in the tomb of Li Sieng of the T’ang dynasty.21 There are twenty-two murals, of which ﬁve are depictions of the game of polo. These murals are cultural relics that provide contemporary evidence of the life and customs of the time. Li Sieng was the son of Emperor Kao Tsung and his wife Empress Wu Tse-tien, and was named crown prince. Described as licentious and depraved, he was stripped of all rank and status for plotting to seize power. Li Sieng died a commoner in 684. In 706, his remains were interred in an attendant tomb in his parents’ mausoleum and posthumously he was given the title Crown Prince Chang Huai. Both the British Museum and the Field Museum in Chicago have in exhibition sculptures of Chinese women indulging in polo, and several terra cottas have been found of women players in China. Most of them carry no mallet, perhaps because its use was explicitly understood. There is a bas-relief of two polo players in a temple in Indochina, illustrated in Carl Diem’s book. Firdusi was the pen name of Abul Kasim Mansur22; his work Sháhnámah (Epic of Kings) was illustrated with a rendition of Síawusch, the story’s hero, who astonishes Afrásiáb, a semimythical king of Scythia, with his skills at polo. The manuscript in the British Museum depicts Afrásiáb in the left top corner, with an attendant carrying an umbrella for royal protection from the sun. Síawusch, his son-in-law, wearing the royal plume in his turban, appears in the right top. He is mounted on a bay pony, while his opponent is on a white and orange horse with a red mane and tail. The goalposts are also pictured, as well as the mallets. These must have been rather fragile, for there are mallet-carrying attendants on foot. The horses are shown with small heads, tapering muzzles, round quarters and high tails that betray their Eastern origin.\n\n2. An Ancient Pastime Discovered by Western Eyes The evolution and development of polo is the work of able men who have risen up from time to time in the history of the game. Dimly across the long expanse of centuries, we see the form of Siawusch, half-mythical, half-historical, yet the ﬁrst of the series of great polo captains and makers of the game.—The Rev. Thomas F. Dale 1\n\nThe tiny eastern Indian state of Manipur is located between Cachar to the west and Myanmar to the east. It enjoyed a semi-independent status until 1949, when it became part of the newly independent India. During the mid-nineteenth century, because of a tense political situation, numerous Manipuris settled in the border region of Cachar and in Cachar proper. It was in this remote area that Lieutenant Joseph Ford Sherer, adjutant of the Sylhet Light Infantry, ﬁrst witnessed a game named sagol kanjai (sagol, horse; kanjai, hockey stick) played by the local people. It was a popular and rough pastime: usually seven players, mounted on 12-hand or so ponies (one hand equals four inches) strove to hit a wooden ball past the backlines of a rectangular ﬁeld of play. The barefooted players wore turbans, secured by a strap, dhotis (a long cotton loincloth), leg-guards, and sleeveless jackets, always either yellow or red. There were no ofﬁcials, with the single exception of a fellow on foot known as Huntre-Hunba, wearing a white dhoti, kurta costume and a light turban. His only function was to throw the ball in the air between the players in a line-up while shouting “huntre.” After that, it was a chaotic situation. It was permissible for the players to pick up the ball with the hand, toss it in the air unimpeded, and smack it forwards, a practice reminiscent of the game of hurling, already in vogue in Ireland. There was another custom, which has remained as part of the laws of the game until these days: after a goal was scored, the teams changed ends. Lieutenant Sherer, just like hundreds of thousands ever since, was smitten. Along the chain of command, Sherer reported to Capt. Robert Stewart, who was the deputy commissioner in Silchar, Cachar’s capital. These two ofﬁcers joined some of the tea planters in the district, who had seen the game as far back as 1854, in some impromptu matches. They are the ﬁrst recorded Englishmen to play the game, which they called hockey on ponies. In typical British fashion, these pioneers decided to start a polo club and accordingly, the Silchar Kangjai Club was started in March 1859 at a meeting that took place in Stewart’s bungalow. On the occasion, the following were elected to membership in addition to Captain Stewart\n\n10\n\n2. An Ancient Pastime Discovered by Western Eyes\n\n11\n\nand Lieutenant Sherer: James Abernethy of Hailakandi, Arthur Brownlow of Hailakandi Valley, James Davidson of Soubong, Ernest Eckhardt of Silkuri, Julius Sandeman of Chutla Bheel, J.P. Stuart of Larsingah and W. Walker of Bograhagt. Thus, unhonored and unsung — indeed, almost unknown — as one writer has it, the ﬁrst club to play the game of polo was organized in a remote outpost of the British Empire.2 Four years later, an unknown hand drafted the ﬁrst written rules of the game for the Silchar Club. (See Appendix 1.) Two years later, Captain Eustace Hill, 3rd Native Infantry, saw the game in Cachar, got the details from Sherer, and started the game in Dacca, where his unit, the Lahore Light Horse — a regiment of East Indians, disbanded in 1865 — was stationed. In the meantime, some merchants traveling to Cachar from Calcutta (now Kolkata) saw the game and decided to give it a go. In September Maj. Gen. Joseph Sherer earned his sobriquet 1862, Lt. George Stewart (later major general) “Father of English Polo” for his pioneer efforts in visited his brother Robert, now Cachar’s com- Cachar, Calcutta and Manipur. To quote Gilbert and Sullivan, Joe Sherer was the very model of missioner, and saw the game as played by a major general, as far as polo is concerned British planters and Manipuris.3 Taking with (Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame). him some sticks and balls, Lt. Stewart returned to Barrackpore, where he was stationed, and founded a club where practice games had taken place for a few months, when the game was picked up by some residents from Calcutta under the leadership of Mr. C.B. Stewart, a well-known local sportsman. Practice games were also held on the parade ground in Ballygunge, one of Calcutta’s suburbs. The ﬁrst formal match was played on the Calcutta Maidan early in 1863, between the Barrackpore Club and the Calcutta Club. Maj. Gen. George Stewart wrote: “The only members of the Barrackpore Club I remember were, besides myself, Colonel Arthur Broome, Bengal Cavalry; the late Colonel J. [John Howard] Broome, 2nd Punjab Cavalry; the Hon. R. [Robert] Napier (the present Lord Napier); Colonel [William Wynne] Apperley, late 15th Bengal Cavalry; a veterinary surgeon of the name of Farrell, and a Captain King, since deceased. The Calcutta players were chieﬂy merchants, one of whom went by the name of ‘Bobby Hills,’ a little fellow, I think a relation of the General [Sir James] Hills who was in Kabul with Roberts.”4 There is also a report that in 1862, during the Christmas Race Week in Calcutta, polo was played in public for the ﬁrst time.5 Rapidly, the game became popular, and in April 1863, another club was founded, the Calcutta Hockey Club, still extant as the oldest polo club, its colors red with a white sash. Among the initial members were C.B. Stewart, R.S. Hills (the Bobby Hills of the Rugby School cricket eleven of 1855), John Thomas, Elliott Angelo, and Col. Richard Beadon.6\n\n12\n\nPART I : THE TRIBESMEN\n\nThen, in March 1864, Lt. Sherer brought over to Calcutta a team of Manipuris known as the Band of Brothers, along with their nifty ponies. The players were Tullain Sing, Chowba Sing, Anon Sing, Omah Sing, Tubal, Attomba and Monge Pa. The Manipuris created a grand sensation with their high saddles, leg guards, bridles ornamented with shells, rope reins, and diminutive ponies. There is no record of the Calcutta team; however, there is a photograph of the original members in 1863, identiﬁed as Colin Smith, Duncan Stewart, R.E. Goolden, D.G. Landale, R.S. Hills, Elliott Angelo, John Thomas, W. Blandford, Montague Champneys, Lewis Pugh Evans, Capt. Cross and Capt. Howe Frederick Showers.7 After the game was over, the cagey Manipuris sold their ponies, presumably for good prices. Some of the ponies were still played on Edward, Prince of Wales’s visit in 1875. As it was, during the match the small Manipuri ponies ran circles around the bigger Indian mounts; the ﬁnal score is not recorded. When later on Sherer took his team to Imphal, Manipur’s capital, to play against local teams, the visitors were unable to win a single match. While in Calcutta, Sherer was given a dinner at the Indigo Club, during which he was presented a silver tankard and salver, as well as the title by which he was hence known, “Joe Sherer, The Father of English Polo.” His portrait, bearing that inscription, hung in the Retreat Club in Silchar. More than 100 years later, the portrait was re-discovered by Captain John Tessier-Yandell while on a temporary posting in Silchar. In the Retreat Club’s bar, an old picture caught his attention. A tarnished silver plaque informed that was presented by Lt. J.E. [sic] Madden in 1898, and further examination of the frame and printed matter below disclosed the subject’s name.8 The captain’s musings were interrupted by his wife’s return from the club’s store, an old polo ball in her hand. It was made of bamboo root, the last polo ball from the ﬁrst polo club. The ball was eventually presented to Prince Philip of Edinburgh, mounted on a plinth, and in turn presented by him to the Calcutta Polo Club as the Sherer Trophy, ﬁrst played for on 22 December 1973. This is how Capt. Tessier-Yandell began his quest for more information on Lt. Sherer; he eventually became the authority on this polo pioneer. The proﬁle that follows is largely taken from his thorough research. Poignantly, Capt. Tessier-Yandell relates how, standing in that dusty and ghost-ridden club in Cachar, he lifted his glass to Joseph Sherer, now rescued from oblivion.9 Joseph Ford Sherer was born at sea on 12 April 1829, the son of Lt. George Moyle Sherer — later Maj. Gen. Sir George Sherer, K.C.S.I.10— and Jane Baillie, daughter of Maj. Gen. Sir Joseph O’Halloran, Bengal Army. Young Joe was nominated to a cadetship in the East India Company and was commissioned on 10 December 1847. Soon after, he sailed for India and was posted to the 49th Bengal Native Infantry Regiment. Shortly after joining, he was involved in the Second Sikh War, being rewarded with a medal and campaign clasp. Promoted to lieutenant in 1851, Sherer became qualiﬁed in Hindustani, Assamese and Bengali; obviously, the young ofﬁcer had a facility for languages. Three years later Lt. Sherer was posted to the Sylhet Light Infantry and was appointed as the regiment’s adjutant eleven months later. Sherer saw duty during the Indian Mutiny, receiving another medal. His aptitude for skirmish warfare came to his superiors’ attention and he returned to Assam’s Cachar District as commandant of the Kookee Levy, in addition to the post of assistant superintendent of the district. It was then, in 1859, that Sherer was one of the founders of the ﬁrst polo club, Silchar. Sherer was responsible for the new game’s organization and promotion in both Cachar and Calcutta. Joseph Sherer had married at Simla, on 10 October 1853, Charlotte Catherine Goldney, seven years younger than the groom.\n\n2. An Ancient Pastime Discovered by Western Eyes\n\n13\n\nIn 1858, the British Crown had assumed responsibility for all the territories previously administered by the East India Company, popularly referred to as “John’s Company,” and a large number of ofﬁcers were left without an appointment. Sherer then joined the non-regimental Staff Corps in 1865 with the rank of captain. He continued to serve mainly in Assam, steadily rising through the ranks: major in 1867, lieutenant colonel in 1873, and colonel in 1879, retiring in 1883 with the rank of major general. His last mention in the London Gazette appears in 1899 with the ofﬁcial announcement of his appointment as additional commissioner for land taxes “for the Town and Port of Hastings and the liberties thereof.” The name Joseph F. Sherer then sinks back into the obscurity of a life serving Crown and country, but it remains a bright star on polo’s ﬁrmament.11 Robert Stewart, arguably the ﬁrst English polo player, died in retirement in 1885. An unsigned article was published in Baily’s Magazine in 1875 stating, “Polo has been played in India by both European ofﬁcers and native irregular cavalry for the last thirty years, and General Outram, Brigadier Mayne, Colonel Skinner, Major Nightingale, and the Scinde Horse, Hodson’s Irregulars, and Fane’s Seikhs [sic] were all adepts in the game.”12 Skinner’s Horse, Central India Horse, Scinde Horse, and the 19th Lancers — originally Fane’s Horse — achieved fame and glory as polo playing regiments. However, there is no record of Gen. George Outram, Brig. Henry Mayne, Col. James “Old Sekunder” Skinner or Maj. Arthur Nightingale, all distinguished soldiers during the Indian Mutiny, ever playing polo, certainly not in 1845. Returning to the game’s unabated growth in India, in 1862 polo was brought to Punjab and the Northwest Provinces by the previously mentioned Lt. George Stewart of the Guide’s Corps. Stewart not only started the game in Barrackpore, but also in Cawnpore, Lahore and later, in Peshawar, where a variation of Manipuri origin was already in vogue under the name kàn-jai bazèè (kàn-jai, hockey stick; bazèè, game). By 1863, polo had been started in Burma at Tonzang by British ofﬁcers stationed in that remote outpost, located just south of Manipur. The game was also introduced at Hazaribagh, India, about 1862, as a side effect of an unusual occurrence. Kaifa Singh and Konai Singh, two princes of the blood, had been deported to Hazaribagh because of their intrigues against the rajah of Manipur. Some of his attendants followed the princes, and as most Manipuris look upon their ponies and their sticks as precious possessions, they took them in their exile. Their pastime soon caught the Europeans’ attention and polo took off. The Manipuris’ attachment to ponies is supported by a record of a player pawning his wife in order to purchase an expensive pony.13 During the summer of 1864, Captain Alexander Kinloch, Riﬂe Brigade,14 saw the game in Srinagar, where the Rajah of Kashmir had constructed a ﬁeld 350 yards long by 60 yards in width, and took polo to his garrison city of Meerut, where both the Riﬂe Brigade and the 19th Hussars took it up. Shortly after, the 54th Foot (Devonshire) Regiment was reckoned to be on top of the heap at the time. In 1868, a big leap took the game from Calcutta across the subcontinent to Bombay (now Mumbai). The messenger was Mr. Walter Crum and the ﬁrst members were John G. Anderson, Stephen E. “Spider” Atkinson, C. Gaddum, Donald Graham, a Mr. Peel and T. Taylor.15 Thus, by 1870, the game had spread all over India. Indigo planters in Behar and Tirhoot gave impetus to polo in those areas. It was also played in Madras and Lower Bengal. However, the real push was given by the cavalry regiments, both British and those from the Army-in-India. The 10th Hussars, about which more anon, were deployed to India in the\n\n14\n\nPART I : THE TRIBESMEN\n\nwinter of 1872. Having been the pioneers of the game in England, they took polo into India with gusto. The 10th showed for the ﬁrst time that bigger ponies were better that the small Arabs or country-bred ponies. On their way south, the 54th Devonshires, who had defeated all their opponents, passed through Muttra, where the 10th Hussars were quartered, and proceeded to challenge them to a polo game. The 54th were mounted on small ponies, 12.3 hands, and when Thomas St. Quintin pointed out to their captain that it was unfair that 10th had big ponies, measuring 13.2 hands, he laughed and stated that the big ponies could not turn as quickly as the small ones, as had An unidentiﬁed early polo player in India, his pony Tommy Atkins and his dog Rock. The photograph was taken in Meean Meer, a been the case in Calcutta almost small cantonment near Lahore, in March 1875. The player is wear- a decade before.16 In the event, ing white long pants, a common attire for polo in tropical cli- the big ponies held the advanmates.

The collection). game became so one-sided that they mixed players from both teams to make it an even and enjoyable contest. A turning point in the game’s evolution had been reached: in polo, larger ponies were faster and stronger than their smaller brethren. In spite of such obvious fact, it took more than 30 years for the ruling bodies in Britain and India to abolish height restrictions, although the limit was 13.3 hands and was later increased to 14.2 hands. It is difﬁcult to say how strictly the measurement rule was applied in India. There are many references to the fact that the rule was observed more in its breakage than in its compliance. In some tournaments, there were some attempts to measure ponies, but mounts of any size were ridden. A wag observed that some ponies would put a cavalry charger to shame.17 The ponies themselves knew the truth. A keen observer of the game, Rudyard Kipling wrote, “They’re chargers — cavalry chargers!’ said Kittiwynk indignantly, ‘They’ll never see thirteen three again.’ ‘They’ve all been fairly measured and they’ve all got their certiﬁcates,’ said the Maltese Cat, ‘or they wouldn’t be here. We must take things as they come along, and keep our eyes on the ball.’”18 In another tournament all the ponies were measured, with four of the largest excluded, but on second try they were allowed to play. Somehow, they became smaller. Some ponies were taught to splay their forelegs, so a few centimeters were saved when under the ofﬁcial\n\n2. An Ancient Pastime Discovered by Western Eyes\n\n15\n\nmeasurer’s bar. The height limit was mentioned in both the United States and Argentina’s rules of the game, but it was totally ignored in practice. The 10th Hussars’ great adversaries in England, the 9th Lancers, were posted to India in 1875, and their rivalry continued. Both regiments would account for the ﬁrst seven Indian Inter-Regimental Tournaments. The ﬁrst two were taken by the 9th Lancers, in 1877 and 1878.19 It is of note that the great John Watson was the umpire in the ﬁnal game. Before the ﬁnals at Meerut, Tim Butson,20 the Lancers’ captain, stated that the rule forbidding crossing was all nonsense, and he would not pull up for any man living. Shortly after the start of the game, Thomas St. Quintin came out of the bully hitting the ball and Butson crossed him; a tremendous collision ensued, but luckily, neither players nor mounts were seriously injured.21 This was the ﬁrst tournament played under the new rules and everyone realized the danger of crossing the line of the ball. Unfortunately, many injuries and even deaths still occur because of disregard for the capital rule of polo. The year 1875 was a watermark for the game of polo in India. Because of the visit by Edward, Prince of Wales and later King Edward VII, a grand gathering took place in Delhi. Representatives from all regiments met, rules were drawn up, four-a-side was adopted, and an annual Inter-Regimental Tournament was instituted. Col. Thomas St. Quintin, who had participated in the ﬁrst game in England and would take polo to Australia in due time, was unanimously elected honorary secretary of the InterRegimental Tournament. The 10th Hussars presented in 1883 a trophy for the Indian Cavalry Inter-Regimental, which was taken by the 12th Bengal Cavalry at Ambala (at times spelled Umballa).22 The 12th was not particularly well mounted, one of the reasons being that they were stationed in Jhansi, a rather out of the way location. According to Lt. Col. Denzil Holder, Jhansi was a poor station, with a very indifferent polo ground.23 Nevertheless, young Ulick Browne of the 12th Bengal Cavalry had drilled his team to play as a unit, at the time in which either the game was characterized as a melee or some runs of individual effort. They took the cup, to everybody’s surprise, except the 4th Battalion of the Riﬂe Brigade, with whom they had been practicing for the past twelve months. Browne was a pioneer in the game’s development, because no other team had perfected teamwork as had the 12th Bengal Cavalry. This was Hiri (Heera) Singh’s debut in tournament polo. The brilliant Hiri would go on to be considered the best Indian player of his generation, showing his skills at back on the Maharajah of Patiala’s celebrated teams, and, perhaps in no small measure because of his polo prowess, reaching the rank of colonel in the Patiala Cavalry. The 12th Bengal Cavalry went on to take the Punjab Polo Cup ﬁve consecutive years, but another Inter-Regimental victory eluded the team. Ulick Browne married, gave up polo and divided his time between Surrey in England and County Mayo in Ireland, devoting himself to country pursuits. Browne inherited the title Marquess of Sligo and became something of an authority in antiquities. At his behest, his father donated to the British Museum some columns that had been damaged by a ﬁre in their ancestral home. The columns came from the treasury of Atreus in Mycenae, circa 1200 B.C., and had been excavated, acquired, and taken to Ireland by his grandfather. Buried in the debris, they had been forgotten. The infantry regiments, more noted for their prowess at hockey, started their own polo competition in 1884 for a cup presented by the Earl of Airlie; the King’s Own Scottish Borderers took the trophy.24 While stationed in India, the K.O.S.B. won the Infantry Tournament several times. Bombay started its own Open Cup in 1883, the Calcutta Turf Club gave a cup for all comers — natives were excluded from the Inter-Regimental — and the Mahara-\n\n16\n\nPART I : THE TRIBESMEN\n\njah of Mysore presented a trophy to be played for at Bangalore. Ornate silver trophies became tangible evidence of the spread of polo throughout India. Until 1880, the game of polo in India was a leisurely affair. To quote “An Elderly Gentleman”: “We did not have any foolishness, such as hustling, and riding off and galloping about like maniacs. Not at all; we took our pleasures calmly.”25 Nevertheless, the challenge provided by competition at tournaments brushed aside the thoughts of playing polo as it were croquet at times, and rugby football at other occasions. The main changes were about the number of players, the ground’s size, the increase in the height of the ponies, the standardization of the rules and the feeble attempts to play it as a team game. A letter to the editor of The Pioneer in Allahabad, published on 4 September 1878, gives an idea of what the games were. Signed by “Hoolvi,” who had played with the Manipuris in the Northwest Province and the Punjab, it says: “This [off-side rule] and the height of the ponies are the two worst rules they could institute, and causes all the mischief in addition to their present play motto, which seems to be —‘every one for himself and devil take the foremost,’ or as you remarked, ‘mad dog like’ regardless as to the position of their sides or the direction the ball is struck.”26 The number of players in each team was usually, but not always, eight, sometimes with two goalkeepers. It was soon realized that goalkeepers had a small role in an open game, and this led to their abolition. At the team’s other end, the number 1 player, also known as the ﬂying man, was hampered by the offside rule that gave the opposing back great advantage. Nevertheless, the number of players was reduced to ﬁve, and then four-a-side. The ﬁeld of play became larger, especially in its width, which allowed more lateral movements in launching an attack and causing further problems for the defensive players, who had to cover more ground closer to the goals. The net result was higher scores than hitherto. The game was played under numerous local rules, which became confusing. Order was restored when the code of rules then in vogue in Bombay was adopted as the matrix for the inter-regimental tournament. Rudimentary tactics began to develop. The usual line-up placed the heaviest man on the team at back, and the number 1 was most of the time a lightweight mounted on the fastest ponies. As the game evolved from trot to gallop, the notion of a stationary, burly back quickly became obsolete. Even with different degrees of ability, and beyond a rudimentary division of labor, every member of the team had to contribute in both attack and defense. There was a certain ethos in the soldier’s games. In the course of a match at Meerut, where General Sir George Richards Greaves was in command, he enjoyed playing on different regimental teams. On one occasion, while playing on the 8th Hussars team, one of his opponents urged another player to “ride the general.” Sir George shouted back, “Ride the general! Ride the general! By heaven, and what next?”27 He explained later that the man on the ball should be left alone until he missed it. Lt. Col. Edward Miller notes that although his ideas on polo were sketchy and his execution poor, Sir George Greaves was personally very popular. The game had been revived in the main by the cavalry regiments. For the Indians, polo — the game of sahibs and rajahs — had been dormant for some 200 years, but the game’s new popularity in the military stations stirred up the princely classes from their slumber. The Maharajas of Cooch Behar, Patiala and Dholepore, and the Nawab Vikar-ul-Oomra started their own teams, usually made up from ofﬁcers and subalterns from their own states’ armies.28 In 1886, Sir Pratap Singh invited Col. Stuart Brownlow Beatson, 11th Bengal Cavalry, to help\n\n2. An Ancient Pastime Discovered by Western Eyes\n\n17\n\nhim organize a regiment of Jodhpur Lancers. Col. Beatson also brought polo to Jodhpur and trained a team, composed of Sir Patrap Singh, Col. Stuart Beatson, Thakur Hurji Singh and Thakur Donkhal Singh. That team won their ﬁrst competition in 1893, the Rajputana Challenge Cup. On Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee in 1897, a team representing Jodhpur traveled to England and played at Hurlingham and Ranelagh. By 1891, it was clear that there was a need for an organization to govern the game of polo in India, similar to the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Hurlingham Polo Committee in England.29 Preliminary meetings were held at Ambala and Simla, Lt. Henry Spencer Follett, 7th Dragoon Guards, being appointed honorary secretary. The ﬁrst ofﬁcial meeting of the Indian Polo Association took place in March 1892, and the inaugural Open Championship in 1898. The Indian game had reached maturity.\n\nPART II: THE ARISTOCRATS\n\n3. The European Journey Ireland It may be that the ﬁrst game of polo in Europe took place in Ireland in the summer of 1868. A detachment from the 10th Hussars was diverted to the Emerald Isle and somehow the ofﬁcers arranged a game against a team of locals at Rathbane, near Limerick.1 Col. Henry Russell so stated in a letter to The Polo Monthly.2 This event happened a year before Lt. Edward Hartopp’s impromptu game at Aldershot in England, to be described later. It also precedes the traditional inaugural game in Ireland, held at Gormanstown Strand in 1870, between a team representing County Meath and the 9th Lancers. “Chicken” Hartopp was Meath’s captain and they were able to defeat the Lancers, at the time serving duty in Dublin. It is not surprising at all that Ireland claims priority in this endeavor, given the special afﬁnity between horse and man in that country. There is another claim for primacy on Irish soil. In the Stonyhurst Magazine, there is a notice informing that a polo stick and a ball from Tibet has been donated to the Society of Jesus school in Lancashire.3 This reminded the notice’s unknown writer that polo was introduced in the British Isles by Valentine Irwin, a former pupil. Irwin entered the Indian Civil Service and in due time was appointed commissioner in Manipur — perhaps succeeding Robert Stewart — where he played polo. Valentine Irwin returned to Ireland on leave around 1865, and at that time introduced the game in Roscommon. According to the note, many accidents occurred; therefore, the new game found no acceptance. Norman Cinnamond’s tutor at Stonyhurst College, Father Frank Irwin, S.J., who was Valentine’s nephew, conﬁrmed the story to Cinnamond, who in turn mentioned it in his book El Polo.4 Valentine Irwin’s contribution to polo in Ireland is also noted in Stonyhurst College’s website. The All Ireland Polo Club was founded in 1873, mainly through the efforts of Horace Rochfort, who had established the County Carlow Polo Club, and two years later a set of rules was promulgated by the club. In 1886, the Irish followed the great majority of British clubs when the Hurlingham rules were adopted. The issue of a polo ﬁeld in Dublin was put before the Board of Works, which allowed a parcel of Phoenix Park, known as the Nine Acres, to be used for polo. Some difﬁculties occurred because, although the board could grant permission to play polo, there was no body, earthly, heavenly, or otherwise — as Thomas Levins Moore quaintly put it — that could grant exclusive rights, because Phoenix Park had been given to the Dubliners as their playground.5 Moreover, the citizens of Dublin had made full\n\n18\n\n3. The European Journey\n\n19\n\nuse of the park, enjoying their football, hurling and wrestling. The All Ireland Polo Club was granted leave to erect a small pavilion and a boundary fence; however, anyone had the right to use the ﬁeld. The pavilion was burnt to the ground in 1987, but a new structure, along the original lines, was then constructed and play on the old ground continues to this day. This makes Nine Acres the oldest recognizable polo ground in Europe. It is not possible to accurately identify its predecessors: a pasture in Rathbane, a paddock at Aldershot Garrison, a common in Hounslow. Perhaps even the isle of Malta may claim priority for its dusty ﬁeld at Marsa. The rest of Ireland took to polo with alacrity. County Kilkenny held games at Prior Wandesford’s property in Castle Comer. County Sligo and County Westmeath soon followed suit. The game was played ﬁve-a-side, all players lining up behind each goalposts; when the umpire tossed the ball in the middle of the ﬁeld, a mad race ensued as ten men converged on the ball. Given this dangerous situation, it came to as no surprise that the ﬁrst recorded modern polo fatality was on Irish soil. Robert Darley, a cousin of the famous Miller brothers, suffered a broken skull when his pony crossed his forelegs, tripped and fell.6 The venue was Phoenix Park, and the year, 1877. In those early days, no player wore head protection except for a cloth forage cap. The All Ireland Open was instituted the following year; the 7th Royal Fusiliers became the ﬁrst holders of this challenge cup.7 That same year, 1878, Capt. John Watson returned from service in India with the 13th Hussars to become the most formidable ﬁgure in polo for the next two decades.8 Watson’s contributions to the game were many and varied. Technically, he developed the backhand stroke, which was revolutionary at the time. It put an end to the customary practice of turning around in a wide circle while tapping the ball, thus speeding up the game’s pace. Curiously enough, he never used the nearside backhander stroke; he always hit the ball on the offside. As far as tactics is concerned, Watson organized his players as a team, insisting — perhaps a bit too rigidly — that each one remain in his place, in the manner of the straight line or “column” game later advocated by Cameron Forbes, ﬁrst in the Philippines and later in America.9, 10 Under Watson’s theory the main task of the number 1 was to neutralize the opposing back — also called number 4 — thereby allowing the two middle players, the number 2 and the number 3, then called half-back, to obtain control of the ball, and ergo, of the game. The back’s responsibility was mainly defensive because his only attacking role was to feed the ball forward. The players were supposed to stay in their allotted positions, with no interchange contemplated or — under Watson’s strong leadership — permitted. The rotational tactics would have to wait before their development by the Peat brothers’ Sussex team, and the concept of an attacking back would be brought on to perfection by the Patiala team in support of their outstanding back, Hira Singh. Currently this tactic is the staple of many teams led by Adolfo Cambiaso, who nominally is listed as number 1, but in practice roams through the entire ﬁeld. As to the number 1, his role was so minimal that he might as well have ridden without a mallet. The offside rule handcuffed his mobility and scope of action, giving tremendous advantage to the adversary’s back, in those days the strongest player and usually team captain as well. Number 1, traditionally the weakest player on a team, had to wait until 1911, when the offside rule was abrogated, to claim his place in the sun and the opportunity to shine in the most difﬁcult position to excel at in the game. John Watson, player, was a superstar. His winning record speaks for itself: Hurlingham’s Champion Cup, the County Cup, Ranelagh’s Open Cup and the International Cup — later\n\n20\n\nPART II : THE ARISTOCRATS\n\nknown as the Westchester Cup — against America. He also drafted the rules of the game. In Chatterton-Newman’s felicitous phrase, “He found it [polo] a virtual free-for-all, and gave it pace, order and science.”11 Other important trophies were put up for competition in Ireland: the All Military Challenge Cup in 1886, ﬁrst taken by that remarkable polo-playing regiment, the 10th (Prince of Wales’ Own Royal) Hussars,12 and the Irish County Cup in 1890. The latter trophy was presented by the All Ireland Polo Club with the idea of promoting the game in the country clubs and providing for a reunion of all clubs in Dublin City. County Fermanagh produced the ﬁrst winner,13 a feat that was repeated the following two years, thereby obtaining permanent possession of the Cup; a new trophy was then donated, but the character was changed to that of a perpetual trophy. This trophy was won by County Dublin in 1909; regrettably, it was stolen from John Leonard’s home, never to be recovered. Some sixty years later, a similar fate would befall the original Cowdray Park Gold Cup. The Dublin fortnight included the Horse Show, the County Cup and the All Ireland Open. After its initial successes, the County Fermanagh Polo Club unfortunately became dormant. Ireland was a fertile ground for polo in its early years. An abundance of good horseﬂesh combined with a relative decrease in expenditure, compared to the game’s cost in England, contributed to its popularity. Several good teams from England made the crossing in order to compete in the All Ireland Open Cup to challenge local teams imbued with furor hibernicus, which played hard, but always within the rules. They were rewarded with some success, like the ones achieved by several regiments in the early years, when most of the players were army ofﬁcers, and later by civilian teams such as Eaton, the Old Cantabs, and the Miller brothers’ Rugby — who were Irish anyhow — and also with the appreciation of Dublin’s crowds. The locals were a knowledgeable bunch, having had the opportunity to watch the game free of charge for years, and having a congenital, well-educated eye for a horse.\n\nEngland In his often-quoted passage from Chances of Sports of Sorts, Col. Thomas St. Quintin relates how some ofﬁcers in the 10th Hussars started polo in England.14 The regiment was in Aldershot Garrison for the 1869 summer drills; one afternoon following lunch, Lt. Edward Hartopp read in The Field an account of polo on horseback as it was played in India (see Appendix 2). Without further ado, some half a dozen ofﬁcers had their chargers saddled, procured a few walking sticks and tried — without too much success — to hit a cricket ball. Colonel Robert S. Liddell, in his book The Memoirs of the Tenth Royal Hussars, gives a slightly different version: “Lord Valentia, Mr. E. Hartopp and Mr. George Cheape of the 11th Hussars, attached to the regiment, were the originators. The ﬁrst game that was ever played took place at Aldershot on a piece of ground below Caesar’s Camp. Amongst those who took part in it on this day were Lieutenant Hartopp, the Hon. Thomas Fitzwilliam, Lieutenant Edward Watson & c. The ofﬁcers rode their chargers and golf sticks and billiard balls were used; later on it was found that a cricket ball, whitened, was more suitable for the purpose. The 9th Lancers adopted the game the following year, and assisted materially by introducing an improved stick.”15 Regardless of which version was closest to the truth, the seeds of polo were planted in England.\n\n3. The European Journey\n\n21\n\nThe next step was to improve the equipment. Long-handed sticks were fashioned, as well as wooden balls the size of a cricket ball, painted white. As to mounts, Capt. William Chaine was deputized to cross the Irish Sea and purchase ponies. Captain Chaine was instructed to ﬁnd ponies about 14 hands high, docile, and handy; it did not matter if they were a bit slow. The concept of pace was not in their minds; that would change soon enough. Captain Chaine returned with some 17 ponies; the 10th Hussars, having returned to their quarters in Hounslow, near Heathrow Airport, marked out a polo ﬁeld on the Heath, had it rolled, and began practicing in earnest. The 9th Lancers were then stationed at Aldershot, and duly they received a challenge from the 10th Hussars. The ﬁrst formal game in England thus was held on Hounslow Heath. The polo game was preceded by a cricket match between the two regiments, which was left unﬁnished. A great number of people came down from London to witness the novel sight of a polo match, and Hounslow Heath was crowded with spectators. They played eight-a-side, with basically no rules. St. Quintin tells that they tried some sort of organization, placing four men on the bully, two half backs, one back and one goalkeeper. Nevertheless, after a few minutes, all players, with the exception of the two goalkeepers, became entangled in a hopeless melee where no one could see the ball, let alone take a shot at it.16 The year is not exactly known; estimates vary from 1869 to 1871. A celebration of the game’s centennial took place in 1970 with a match at Windsor Park, the players and umpires — the Duke of Edinburgh and Earl Mountbatten of Burma — attired in period costumes. Some contemporary evidence points out to 1871. A detailed description of the match at Hounslow Heath was published by The Morning Post in July of that year, according to a reprint in Chances of Sports of Sorts. The report’s initial paragraph reads: “Nearly all fashionable London journeyed from Town to Hounslow on Tuesday to witness a new game called ‘Hockey on Horseback,’ between the Ofﬁcers of the 10th (Prince of Wales’s Own) Hussars from Hounslow Barracks and the ofﬁcers of the 9th (Queen’s) Lancers, who had come from Aldershot.”17 The game was watched by the Prince and the Princess of Wales, Prince Arthur, and the Duke of Cambridge. Royal patronage of the game of kings was evident at its very beginning. Final score was three goals for the Hussars against two goals by the Lancers. Despite some rather caustic words by the unnamed reporter, polo quickly expanded in England: “It was admitted by all who were looking that [the game] was more remarkable for the strength of the language used by the players than anything else.”18 Early matches included the Household Cavalry versus the Light Cavalry at Lillie Bridge ground on 27 June 1871. Then there would be a reasonable priority claim for this match. Assuming that the “Tuesday” mentioned in The Morning Post refers to the month of June, in 1871, it was precisely the 27th. The last Tuesday in June 1870 was the 28th. Common sense would dictate that the encounter at Hounslow Heath took place in 1870. The summer of 1869 would have been too soon because Captain Chaine had to travel to Ireland to purchase ponies; the 9th Lancers had to start their practice games from scratch, secure their own ponies and manufacture some mallets. The 10th Hussars were dedicated to level and mark out the grounds at Hounslow Heath. All that would take time, but perhaps not as long as two years. In the face of the available evidence, it is reasonable to assume that the proto-game in England was held on 28 June 1870. There is corroborating artistic evidence. The artist Terence Cuneo was commissioned to paint a work commemorating that historic event.19 It is signed and dated December 1970. A plaque on the frame reads:\n\n22\n\nPART II : THE ARISTOCRATS Centenary Commemoration Polo Game Windsor 28th June 1970 To commemorate the introduction of Polo into England by a Match played between The 9th Lancers and The 10th Hussars in 1870. 9th/12th Lancers v The Royal Hussars 3 goals nil Presented by Lt. Colonel R.S.G. Perry, D.S.O.— Joined 9th L 1929 — Commanded Reg. March 1944 — March 1946\n\nA reproduction of the painting adorns the cover of the recently published book Smith’s Lawn — The History of Guards Polo Club 1955–2005, by Maj. John N.P. Watson, and is also illustrated in Polo Quarterly International, in the Winter 1992 issue. The two pioneer polo regiments suffered the indignation of being amalgamated with other regiments, ﬁrst, the 9th Lancers with the 12th Lancers in 1960; nine years later the same fate befell the 10th Hussars and the 11th Hussars, which formed a unit that was designated the Royal Hussars. Tradition had to give way to modern army methods. Erstwhile opponents 9th Lancers and 10th Hussars — light cavalry regiments — joined forces in a game against the 1st Life Guards and the Royal Horse Guards at Richmond Park in 1870, the Heavies emerging as victors. Polo in the Greater London area was concentrated on the Lillie Bridge ground in West Brompton, better known as a cricket and athletics ﬁeld. It was a small ground, only 200 yards long; however, it had to do until better grounds were made available to the growing polo population. Capt. Edward Hartopp, Capt. Macqueen and the Hon. Debonnaire Monson were the prime movers in the enterprise, which was launched under the highest patronage. Edward, Prince of Wales, allowed his name to appear as patron, Earl Spencer became president and Viscount Valentia vice-president. The Committee of Election consisted of Lord Sholto Aberdour, Captain William Clayton, Viscount Lowry Cole, E.M. Dunsey, Col. David Ewart, the Hon. Charles FitzWilliam, Captain Hartopp, Reginald Herbert, Dermot, Earl of Mayo, Cristóbal de Murrieta, Captain Macqueen, John, Marquess of Queensbery, Lord Arthur Somerset, and Henry, Marquess of Worcester. Under their auspices the number of playing members, initially limited to 100, soon enrolled, and the club was formally established.20 On Tuesday, 2 June 1873, the ﬁrst grand meet at polo took place at Lillie Bridge before a very large assemblage of London’s fashionable élite world, the match being between the Lords and the Commons. On this occasion, the weather was beautiful, and the recent rains had made the ground on good playing order. The sides were fairly even, and, after some brilliant play, the Commons ultimately succeeded in winning four games (goals) to their opponents’ two. The Spanish player Adrián de Murrieta made two goals, while his pony, a wiry bay with black points, appeared to enjoy the sport as much as his rider. Since what may be called the opening day, polo constantly increased in popularity. Baily’s Magazine noted that “the club being as select as possible, admission to the members inclosure is only obtainable by vouchers.”21 What attracted the society’s interest were the players. When two years later the Hurlingham Club organized a tent-pegging contest featuring the 5th Lancers, “everybody was there, or meant to be; and if everybody had not looked cold and cross it would have been a pretty sight. As to the tent pegging, there was some disappointment, mainly among the female members of the country-cousin brigade, as to the actors on the scene. When it was discovered that the performers were not what a dear old Irish lady used to call ‘the horse ofﬁcers,’ but that the ‘pegging’ was relegated to the troopers, all interest in it died out. The east wind might\n\n3. The European Journey\n\n23\n\nhave been encountered cheerfully if the ‘captains’ had been to the fore, but there was no enthusiasm about the sergeants.”22 The Hurlingham Club in Fulham, started as a pigeon-shooting endeavor in 1867, by 1874 began to cater to polo players and quickly became polo’s guiding light under the Hon. Debonnaire John Monson’s astute management, ably supported by Capt. John Walter Smyth — later Sir Walter — as polo manager. Hurlingham’s history and profound inﬂuence on the game will be examined later. At the time, the vast majority of polo players were cavalry ofﬁcers, but in 1872, Capt. Francis “Tip” Herbert, having left the service, founded with his older brother Reginald the ﬁrst civilian club on the British Isles, the Monmouthshire Polo Club, with grounds at Clytha, near Usk.23 The ﬁrst match was held on 23 September, followed by a dinner at the Angel Hotel in Abergavenny.24 Monmouthshire had a signiﬁcant impact upon English polo, being the winner, runner-up and joint-winner in the only ﬁnal tied game in the history of polo’s major tournament, the Hurlingham Club Championship Cup. When Tip Herbert became manager of the Ranelagh Club, Monmouthshire went into decline and ﬁnally closed its doors around 1897. The Beaufort Polo Club was established in a corner of Gloucestershire around 1872 by Capt. Francis Henry, formerly of the 9th Lancers, and at the time in the Royal Gloucestershire Yeomanry. Captain Henry is mentioned as a participant in the ﬁrst match between the 9th Lancers and the 10th Hussars in 1870.25 This statement is incorrect, because the thenlieutenant Henry had retired from the 9th Lancers in 1866. Furthermore, he is not listed in the roster of players that participated in the celebrated game at Hounslow Heath.26 All the original members hunted with the Duke of Beaufort Hunt. There is no mention of the Beaufort Polo Club in the 1895 edition of J. Moray Brown’s Polo. The grounds were in Norton, between Malmesbury and Hullavington. In 1929, the Beaufort Club was revived by Herbert C. Cox, a Canadian player who developed seven playing ﬁelds at his Down Farm in Westonbirt, near Cirencester, to supplement the original grounds. Down Farm was purchased in 1977 by Capt. and Mrs. G. Simon Tomlinson of team Los Locos fame. Twelve years later, they formally established the new Beaufort Polo Club, which is now thriving as a venue for country polo. A peculiar entity was the International Gun and Polo Club in the seaside resort town of Brighton. The club was formed for the purpose of holding meetings in England and on the Continent for pigeon shooting, polo, archery, tilting in the ring, fashionable fêtes and other rural amusements. The club’s headquarters was the Bedford Hotel in Brighton, while the polo ground was in Preston, Sussex. Reviewing the scarce annuals issued by the club, it appears that only prizes for polo, polo ponies racing, tent pegging and shooting were given. The club’s founder was George Marshall, who held proprietary rights. The total membership was a little over 300; it reads like a list of European high society. Nevertheless, polo played a prominent part. Among the prizewinners were good players such as Edward Baldock, John Scott Chisholme, Capt. Frank Grissell, the Herbert brothers, James Mellor, Richard St. Leger Moore, Adrián de Murrieta, Hugh Owen, the Peat brothers, the Marquis of Queensberry and Sir Charles Wolseley. The continental meetings were held in Baden-Baden, Berlin, Brussels, Hamburg, Paris and Spa. The club’s rules are printed in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Flemish, Russian and Arabic, in that order. Admission tickets to events were only issued with a member’s voucher. Members were ﬁrmly advised, “Should any Member furnish Vouchers to Ladies not received in general society he\n\n24\n\nPART II : THE ARISTOCRATS\n\nwill be expelled from the club.”27 In keeping with the club’s policy of holding meetings elsewhere, polo matches took place not only on their home ground near Brighton, but also in Cheltenham and in London’s Richmond Park. Other early provincial clubs included Derbyshire, established in 1880 by that grand old supporter of the game, the Earl of Harrington, who built grounds at his seat, Elvaston Castle, and at Trent Bridge. Then we have Barton-under-Needwood in Staffordshire, which had some battles with Monmouthshire. Manchester Polo Club, founded by Colin Ross, Ashton Radcliffe, Bailey Worthington and others in the same year as the more celebrated Monmouthshire, had a short time span, for it closed in 1877. It was restarted as Manchester Garrison by the 18th Hussars ﬁve years later and reorganized as Manchester Polo Club by Sir Humphrey de Trafford, who played with ofﬁcers of the Queen’s Bays stationed there. The venue was Old Trafford, now better known as the home of the Manchester United football team. The ghosts of Busby’s Babes must surely mix with yellow and chocolate clad poloists on many a foggy night.28 The Cheshire Polo Club, with grounds in Little Budworth, just north of Tarpoley, claims its antiquity to 1872.29 In fact, the club is the result of a merge among three other clubs: Manchester, founded in that year, Wirral, which dates back to 1885, and Bowdon, where play had started in 1891. Manchester and Bowdon joined in 1906 with grounds at Ashley, retaining the name Manchester as the senior club. In 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, the club moved to Little Budworth and took the name Mid-Cheshire Polo Club, retaining the traditional scarlet and white colors. Cheshire Polo Club was established in 1951 and remains a powerful force in the area, being the home of the Junior County Cup, a provincial trophy dating back to 1905. Another old trophy is the Cheshire Champion Cup, presented to the Liverpool Polo Club in 1911 by its women members. Nearby, Chester Polo Club, started in 1881 by Lord Arthur Grosvenor, played their matches at the Rodee, the public grounds in the walled city of Chester, where there is a race course. The club was revived by Alfred Tyrer in 1895, but fell into abeyance. A new Chester club was formed in 2005. Most appropriately, the home ground is on the Rodee track. The universities also had polo clubs: Oxford, founded in 1874 by Walter Hume Long, later Viscount Long of Wrexhall, and Cambridge a year earlier, established by the Hon. John Fitzwilliam. The Inter-University polo match ﬁrst took place in 1878, the Dark Blues taking the honors. Between 1870 and 1890, the game made slow progress. Balls and sticks of every conceivable pattern were used, with balls ranging from inﬂated India rubber to tennis balls. At the beginning, it was no more than a scrum or a maul — to use rugby terms — which slowly evolved into a slow, dribbling game. It was the time of ﬁve-a-side players, snafﬂe bridles and blinkers, docked tails and no martingales. The increased use of the backhander stroke, as devised by John Watson, changed it into a faster galloping game, in which the celebrated Sussex County team of the brothers Arthur, James Earnest “Johnnie” and Alfred “The Boy” Peat reigned supreme from 1879 until 1893. Along their many years of almost unbroken success, the Peat brothers were helped by players such as James Babington, Edward Baldock, Henry Ashton Case, Gerald Hardy, Thomas Pinchard Kempson, Thomas Kennedy, the Earl of Lewes, Sir Francis Mildmay, Sir Algernon Peyton, Geoffrey Phipps-Hornby, Sr., and their brotherin-law, Edward Kenyon Stow. In 1894, playing with the Earl of Harrington, then in his ﬁftieth year, Sussex was defeated 4–3 in the Hurlingham Champion Cup ﬁnal. The Peats’ ponies had been trained to be changed every time the ball went out of play, when time out was called\n\n3. The European Journey\n\n25\n\nfor one minute. When the rule was modiﬁed that year, their ponies could not keep up the pace and Sussex lost in overtime to the Freebooters, among whom was their old teammate Gerald Hardy, who scored the seventh and winning tally. The Peat brothers then sold their ponies and did not appear on a polo ground again.30 The Peats’ inﬂuence upon the game was most signiﬁcant. Up to their time, most players considered the pony just a conveyance to get near the ball. The brothers three from Wimbledon were the ﬁrst to pay special attention to training their ponies for polo and purchased the best available mounts. Johnnie Peat, at number 1, became the best striker and goal scorer of the day. Not only that, but instead of going after the opposing back, he made the back go after him. Edward Miller wrote that Arthur Peat at back was as good as, if not better than, John Watson, which is saying a lot, while “The Boy,” not as brilliant as his siblings, was as good as any number 3 of the day.31 But what made the Sussex County team almost unbeatable — eleven Champion Cups in thirteen years — was their combination play. For all their individual brilliance, it was combination play that made the team so successful. Their merit was that they assimilated and applied John Watson’s teachings better than any others, and complemented their tactical prowess with superb ponies. Further improvements were achieved by the celebrated Rugby team led by Capt. Edward Miller, who — with his younger brothers Charles and George, ably assisted at various times by Walter Jones and the Earl of Shrewsbury at the number 1 position, and W.J. “Jack” Drybrough at back — were the Sussex County successors as the most dominant force in English polo. The Miller brothers were experts in the selection and training of polo ponies, which they put to good use on the polo grounds. The times of slow, dribbling polo were gone forever. Another change that contributed to speeding up the game was limiting the teams to four-a-side. Although this practice was formally adopted in 1883 by the Hurlingham Polo Committee, in 1880 the Royal Scots Greys had taken the All Ireland Open with only four men on the team.32 The goalkeeper’s lonely position had previously been abandoned. In early English polo, the honor of victory had to be its own reward. That would soon change. The conditions for the International Gun and Polo Club stated, “The Polo Prizes consist of Silver Cups and Medals specially manufactured for the occasion.”33 The Prince of Wales, always an interested spectator, donated a trophy for the match between military and civilians at Hurlingham on 12 June 1889. During this entire period, polo was dominated by army ofﬁcers. Almost every cavalry regiment in Britain and in India had a polo club. As previously described, there were several civilian clubs and many good players, of whom the vast majority were military men. It was a peculiar army, in a transitional stage from the Crimean war — saddled with its Wellingtonian legacy — to the rude awakening of the Anglo-Boer conﬂict at the turn of the century. The army’s central core was the regiment, each one with its own traditions, mottos, battle honors and strict hierarchical order: cavalry ﬁrst, then the infantry guards, then the regiments of the line. The ofﬁcers obtained their commissions by purchase, a quaint and ingrained custom. When Edward Cardwell, later Viscount Cardwell of Ellerbeck — appointed Secretary for War in Gladstone’s Liberal Party cabinet — tried to implement a modicum of reform, the establishment closed ranks in bitter opposition, led by no other than the commander-in-chief, the Duke of Cambridge and a cousin of Queen Victoria. Even the queen herself was said to have reservations about doing away with the old practice of purchasing commissions. Some of these reforms, which included the abolition of ﬂogging — but only during peace-\n\n26\n\nPART II : THE ARISTOCRATS\n\ntime — had been resisted mainly by the cavalry, which represented the army of “the good old days before the confounded meddler, who knew nothing about these things, had got his way with the Queen.”34 Two things that did not change were pay and leave: in the ﬁrst case, there was too little, in the latter, far too much. In some regiments, ofﬁcers would take up to a sixmonth leave in a year. In the 1930s, Lt. Col. Humphrey Guinness, Royal Scots Greys, several times an international player, used to say about leave: “at any time,” which meant plenty and often.35 No social event was ever considered too small to justify escape from duty. There were notorious escapades, in which the 5th Lancers, a great polo regiment, were prominent. It got to such a degree that the Duke of Cambridge had to handle the situation. Col. Valentine Baker, a respected soldier who was commanding the elite 10th Hussars, was convicted of attempting to assault a woman on a railroad carriage. The printed reference states, “His sad story needs no comment.”36 After serving time, Colonel Baker joined the Egyptian Army, and as Baker Pasha, rose to high command. Nevertheless, the peacetime high jinks did not deter the ofﬁcers from duty in battle. Philip Mason recalls the story of a Prussian ofﬁcer admonishing his colleagues never to underestimate the foxhunting, polo-playing British ofﬁcers’ conduct in war.37 The progress of polo in England was hampered by the continuing use of the offside rule and, to a lesser extent, by the lack of individual handicaps. Both were set aside almost simultaneously in 1911. The catalyst was the unexpected and overwhelming triumph of the American team in the 1909 Westchester Cup matches at Hurlingham. The cup’s rules indicated that the competition must be carried out under the host association’s rules and regulations. The British challenge in 1911 would then be played under American rules, which had abolished the concept of offside many years before because it was quite evident that it did not favor the smooth ﬂow of the game. For the Hurlingham Defense Committee, if they harbored any hope of bringing back the trophy to English shores, there was no alternative but to practice games under the no-offside concept. The majority of players, after a few games, were in favor of the new rule. As to individual handicaps, the problem had been recognized by astute observers of the game around the turn of the century. A halfway solution was implemented in February 1903 with the institution of the Recent Form List. This rule established that in some selected tournaments no more than two players on the list could play on the same team. It was not enough. Lopsided scores in many important matches — in 1902, the Freebooters beat the Black and Tan by 12 goals to one in the ﬁnals of the Champion Cup — continued to plague the landscape. Yet, there was no change until July 1910, when the Recent Form List was abolished and the Hurlingham Polo Committee issued the ﬁrst handicap list. Four Americans, the Big Four team players, were joined by a lonely Briton, Walter Buckmaster, a stockbroker who was the leader of the Old Cantabs team — Cambridge University’s former students — as the ﬁrst 10goaler in Britain.38\n\nScotland According to the well-known polo writer James Moray Brown, the game was played in Scotland in 1872. He ought to know because his own regiment, the 79th Cameronian Highlanders, was garrisoned in Edinburgh, together with the 7th Hussars, which counted the Duke\n\n3. The European Journey\n\n27\n\nof Connaught among its ofﬁcers. Play was on a ﬁeld near Duddington. Moray Brown reminisced that those were the days of the dribbling game and charging for the ball. It was during the latter, at the beginning of a match, when he had the misfortune of colliding with Queen Victoria’s son, both riders going head over heels.39 The game received a big boost when 17 acres were leased at Murrayﬁeld — now the site of the Scottish Rugby Union stadium — backed by the Murrayﬁeld Woods, where a ground was laid out by Tom Drybrough, one of the players and author of a book on the game. The ground measured 260 by 175 yards and had sideboards. The Edinburgh Club was formally established in 1880. The team of William Younger, Captain Gordon Mackenzie, and Tom and Jack Drybrough took the County Cup in 1893 and 1894, a remarkable achievement for a remote and isolated club in the northern reaches. The next Scottish club to be afﬁliated with the County Polo Association was Ayrshire, started in 1908.\n\nFrance The city of Pau, located in the Basses-Pyrénées — now Pyrénées Atlantiques — presents a strong claim to be the ﬁrst place where polo was played in Continental Europe. A large foreign colony, in which the British were predominant, started polo together with racing, foxhunting, rugby, steeple chasing, tennis, pigeon shooting and cricket. Pau was the ﬁrst of many continental resorts, such as Brioni, Cannes, Deauville and Ostend, where polo was brought over for the enjoyment of mainly English vacationers, with a sprinkle of North and South Americans. British sporting inﬂuence upon the town goes back a long time. In his history of golf, Robert Browning writes: “It is said that after Wellington’s victory at Orthez in 1814, two ofﬁcers of Scottish regiments who were billeted at Pau and who had optimistically included their golf clubs in their kit, played a rough and ready game on the Plain of Billère.”40 Polo was played on that same Billère Plain, adjacent to the golf course where the royal and ancient game has been played since 1856; the Pau Golf Club is the oldest in Continental Europe. The game of polo was started by two Americans, the publisher James Gordon Bennett, who is credited with bringing the game to New York, and William Knapp Thorn, who played for America in the ﬁrst Westchester Cup in Newport. William Thorn, Jr., Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt’s grandson, was one of the best-known sportsmen in both France and America; he hunted, played polo, rode races and was a ﬁne equestrian. He died in 1910, of a brain hemorrhage, at home in his beloved Pau. Other early players included the Comte de Madré, later patron of the Tigers team, the Scots Jack and Tom Drybrough; the former a mighty back who met his end during a match at Rugby, the latter a well-known author of a treatise on polo. Charles Carroll, the American Henry Ridgeway, who was also Master of the Pau Hunt, James Mellor, of the famous Monmouthshire Club, the international Walter McCreery, a winner of steeplechases, and the American Alfred Torrance also played. Torrance was killed during a steeplechase at Croix-de-Berny.41 Later players included the Russian Prince Sergey Belosselski, Sir Victor Brooke (Field Marshal Alan Brooke’s grandfather) Eustace Jameson, J. Morris Post, Robert Stewart-Savile (donor of New Zealand’s Savile Cup), and Mexican Olympic player Guillermo Hayden Wright. The “upper ten thousand” English or Parisians, who spend six months of the year in Pau, did not have an entirely happy relationship with the local townsfolk because the visitors did\n\n28\n\nPART II : THE ARISTOCRATS\n\nnot mix well with the Palois. In 1876, Bertall wrote, “Pau is not a French town; Pau, obviously and clearly is part of England.”42 The foreigners felt that they were scalped by the local merchants on every possible situation; a letter to The Times suggested that the Palois’ only interest was emptying the visitors’ purses.43 It is not at all remarkable that reproaches from both sides were about money. On their part, the locals objected to the isolation and the conspicuous consumption by the visitors. An unnamed observer pointed out in 1886: “The arriving Peerage, the Gentry, and the rich merchant class, live in a different world. Wealth is everything. Whoever has the most money is ﬁrst in Pau. From princes whose destiny is to wear the most beautiful crowns in the world, to newcomers like Gordon Bennett, who throws away gold at his parties....”44 Instead of town and gown, it was town versus vacationers. Let us remember that Pau was a provincial town in the Bearn, the proud birthplace of Henri IV, one of the great rulers of France. The author’s father grew up in Pau in the 1890s and the children were educated at the local lycée and at the Ursuline Sisters’ school. The family’s petit hotel was on the Place Albert Premier, in the heart of the Quartier Anglais. In spite of having a French-born father and the family’s verbal facility with the local patois, they were considered foreigners. When the ﬁve children were out for a ride aboard a carriage or mounted on small ponies, the usual comment they heard was, “There they go: les Americains.”45 Polo continued at Pau through the early 20th century; after 1902, there was another ground in Jurançon, across the river on the Bourda ﬁeld. Nevertheless, polo was not resumed after the Kaiser’s War. Other sports continued to thrive in Pau. The Stade Palois rugby team was for many years a top national team in rugby-mad southwest France. The beautiful golf course remains a top attraction for tourists and locals alike; steeplechase races are part of the French racing season. The motorcar racing fraternity meets yearly at the Parc Beaumont circuit, which traditionally signaled the start of the European season featuring the Grand Prix de Pau. The Pau Hunt remains active; Frederick Prince, of the polo-playing family from Boston’s North Shore, was master until the 1930s. There is another British heritage in town: the gardens. The English brought with them their hobby of gardening. Private gardens are everywhere, because the Palois readily"
