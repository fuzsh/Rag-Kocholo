        "text": "Reaching out to potentially profitable new players in their native tongue\n\nBig Fish Games announced Thursday that it is expanding its games into several new languages and currencies. One might wonder why Big Fish Games, which was founded in 2002, is making these additions. The company has players in more than 200 countries, with 50% of its sales coming from international markets, according to Jeremy Lewis, the president and CEO of Big Fish Games. That is no small dollar amount when you consider that the company had revenues in 2009 that exceeded $100 million.\n\nThis means that games will now be available in the following languages:\n\nEnglish\n\nFrench\n\nGerman\n\nItalian (new)\n\nJapanese\n\nSpanish\n\nBrazilian Portuguese (new)\n\nDanish (new)\n\nDutch (new)\n\nSwedish (new)\n\nThe move also increases the company's potential player market. More than 300 million people speak one of the new languages offered. Expanding into these markets is too potentially lucrative to pass up.\n\nThe site will also be adding 12 new payment currencies, which brings the total number of currencies accepted by Big Fish Games to 16. The new currencies include:\n\nArgentine peso\n\nAustralian dollar\n\nBrazilian real\n\nBritish pound\n\nCanadian dollar\n\nDanish krone\n\nEuro\n\nJapanese yen\n\nMexican peso\n\nNew Zealand dollar\n\nNorwegian kroner\n\nSouth African rand"
