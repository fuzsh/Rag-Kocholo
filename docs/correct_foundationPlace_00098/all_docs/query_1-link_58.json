        "text": "One of Largest Producers and Distributors of Mobile and Online Games in the World\n\nBig Fish Games - A Top-Grossing Mobile Game Publisher Worldwide\n\nBig Fish Casino - A Top-Grossing Mobile Social Casino Game Worldwide\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 12, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Churchill Downs Incorporated (Nasdaq:CHDN) (CDI) and Big Fish Games, Inc. (Big Fish), one of the world's largest producers and distributors of mobile and online games, today announced they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which CDI will acquire all of the outstanding stock and equity interests of the privately held Big Fish.\n\nThe transaction is structured on a cash-free/debt-free basis and is valued at up to $885 million, including a base consideration of $485 million and a potential earn-out payment of up to $350 million based on 2015 Adjusted EBITDA, and a potential bonus payment to the founder and current Chief Executive Officer of Big Fish, Paul Thelen, of $50 million based on 2016 bookings. The purchase price will be paid in cash, except for approximately $15 million paid in CDI common stock to Paul Thelen.\n\nThe upfront payment represents a multiple of approximately 8.5-times Big Fish's Adjusted EBITDA (including an adjustment for changes in deferred revenue) for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2014 of $57.3 million. The earn-out payment will be calculated by applying a multiple of 9-times the increase in calendar year 2015 Adjusted EBITDA over a base value of $51.2 million, except that for purposes of the earn-out calculation the adjustment for change in deferred revenue will be reduced by subtracting expected costs associated with such deferred revenue.\n\nThe merger, which has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, is conditioned upon receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Subject to the satisfaction of these conditions, the transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.\n\n\"The acquisition of Big Fish and our entry into the rapidly growing mobile and online games industry gives us new products, new customers, new geographies and new sizeable growth opportunities,\" said Bill Carstanjen, Chief Executive Officer of CDI. \"While many will view this transaction as a logical extension to what we currently do with Twinspires.com, what is most important to us are the strong team and the processes and capabilities that have been built by Big Fish in Seattle, Oakland, and Luxembourg. We are excited to announce this transaction and believe we will do great things together.\"\n\nPaul Thelen, Big Fish's founder and CEO said, \"We are extremely proud of the company we have built over the last twelve years. Churchill Downs is a company with a commitment to interactive entertainment and a track record of growth and performance. We believe Big Fish is now positioned to become an even greater force in the casual, mid-core and social casino mobile and online games industry. Churchill Downs is a great cultural fit for us and we are thrilled to be joining the Churchill Downs family.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs is acting as financial advisor and Sidley Austin LLP is acting as legal advisor to CDI. JPMorgan is acting as lead on the financing of this transaction.\n\nQatalyst Partners LP is acting as financial advisor and Perkins Coie LLP is acting as legal advisor to Big Fish on this transaction.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nA conference call to discuss this transaction is scheduled for Thursday, November 13, 2014 at 9:00 a.m. E.S.T.\n\nInvestors and other interested parties may listen to the conference call by accessing the online, real-time webcast and broadcast of the call at www.churchilldownsincorporated.com, or by dialing (877) 372-0878 and entering the pass code 35368078 at least 10 minutes before the beginning of the call.
