        "text": "ROCKFORD, IL — The Kenosha Kingfish have fallen one big hit short in several games this year dropping 9 ball-games this year by a score of one run. Kenosha was able to get that hit today in a 4-1 victory over the Rivets in 6 innings.\n\nWill Plattner launched a two-run homerun in the fourth to break a game tied at 1-1. The homerun marked the first away home-run of the Kenosha season and the second of the week for Will Plattner.\n\nKenosha was able to add one more run in the 5th on a Robert Newland single that scored Christopher Schuchart to make the game 4-1.\n\nThe game was later called after heavy rain pushed the game into two delays giving Kenosha the 4-1 win, their fourth win of the second half.\n\nThey will continue the road-trip at Traverse City tomorrow at 6:05 p.m. CT. Follow @Kenosha_Kingfish on X or watch the game on Northwoods League+ for updates.\n\n###\n\nThe Kenosha Kingfish are a member of the finest developmental league for elite college baseball players, the Northwoods League.
