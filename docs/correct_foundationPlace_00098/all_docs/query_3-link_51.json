        "text": "Armenian game developer\n\nElephant Games is an international casual game developer company founded in 2003. The main expertise of the company is Hidden Object games. The company released more than 150 games[2] smost of them in partnership with a US publisher Big Fish Games. The head office [3] of the company is located in Yerevan, Armenia, and the geography of the team is from India to Argentina.\n\nInitially the company was called White Elephant. The large white animal was associated with a big scale and uniqueness. Later it was renamed to Elephant Games. The company is owned by two people with a passion for games, Dmitry Kuklin and Andrey Pakhmutov.\n\nThe very first game the company released is called Crazy Worms. The projects that followed are Jungle Heart and RIP (Rest in Peace) Trilogy.\n\nDuring 2006, the company released three installments of the top-down arcade shooter RIP. The game was first published by Meridian4, and then distributed as a trilogy on Steam.\n\nIn 2007, Elephant Games entered the European market with a fashion simulator game, Real Stories: Fashion Shop for Nintendo DS. Elephant Games was one of the first in its region to get the license from Nintendo. Later Nintendo approved and licensed the concept of the shooter WinD (Way in Dusk)\n\nIn 2009 the company expanded its DS and Wii portfolio with the action mini game Love Is... In Bloom based on the comic of the New Zealand artist Kim Grove.\n\nElephant Games also works on Hidden Object games. Lost in the City[4] was launched in 2009. Other games include Mystery Trackers,[5] Grim Tales[6] and Detectives United.[7]\n\nThe company has been cooperating with Big Fish, a major US company, a global publisher and distributor of casual games. During the partnership, Elephant Games has won many international Big Fish Games Customer Favorites Awards.\n\nIn October 2012, the company released its first free-to-play game Found: A Hidden Object Adventure,[8] which was available on both PC and iPad (currently closed).\n\nThe company's second free-to-play game Midnight Castle,[9] was released in December 2013. The project has been around for over 10 years at this point.\n\nSince 2009, Elephant Games has focused on the hidden object genre and launched more than 150 games with different themes, styles and settings.\n\nLost in the City\n\nLost In The City (2009)\n\nLost In The City: Post Scriptum (2010)\n\nMystery Trackers[10]\n\nMystery Trackers: The Void (2010)\n\nMystery Trackers: Raincliff
