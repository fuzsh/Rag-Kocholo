        "text": "13th Annual Meeting, The European Association of Archaeologists, Zadar, Croatia (18th to 23th September 2009) The independence of Macedonia after the dissolution of Yugoslavia has contributed for political reality to reflect in many fields, including archaeology. The break-up with the tradition to which Macedonian archaeology was linked both methodologically and conceptually for almost 50 years made it necessary for it to become self-reliant. Lacking experts, unable to produce new professionals, or introduce new traditions, in a region marked by conflict due to its multi-ethnic nature, the results reflected in Macedonian archaeology in terms of a lack of basic excavations, as well as in the absence of multidisciplinary research. Stuck in the past, it would probably be helpful in this process of transition to do a complete reevaluation of Macedonian archaeology as a whole, including certain periods which outdated chronology needs to be rejected or confirmed in the light of new findings, international trends and hypotheses. This paper will present an overview of Macedonian archaeology in the past 20 years, and the challenges it is facing after gaining independence from former Yugoslavia. It will present views that reflect the current condition in Macedonian archaeology, expressed in terms of statistical analysis.\n\nAlthough the island of Cyprus seems to have remained largely isolated throughout the earlier phases of the Bronze Age, during the later 2nd millennium BCE it became a significant trade spot in the maritime networks of the East Mediterranean. Because of the considerable intensification of copper production and export during the Late Cypriote period, the island greatly increased its external contacts and transformed into the important trade partner of Egypt, Levant, Anatolia and the Aegean. As active participants in international trade, especially in the export of copper, the merchants from Cyprus most probably adapted existing metrological systems from other areas. Balance weights have come to light at numerous Late Bronze Age sites on Cyprus in various contexts: in settlements (e.g. Hala Sultan Tekke; Apliki-Karamallos), in graves (e.g. Hala Sultan Tekke; Ayia Irini-Paleokastro; Paleokastro by Ayia Irini) and in hoards (e.g. Kalavassos-Ayios Dhimitrios; Enkomi; Pyla-Kokkinokremos). The primary aim of this paper is to review the weighing equipment (balance weights and scales), as well as metrological systems used on Cyprus in the Late Bronze Age. It seems that only Egyptian and Near Eastern metrological systems were adapted, while the Aegean system was not applied. This is especially striking since wide trade and social contacts with the Aegean had existed for many centuries and became particularly intensive in the Late Bronze Age. In addition, the relationship between metal production and weighing utensils, including both canonical and uncanonical weights (potential stone weights), will be investigated.\n\nSeveral hundreds of sites of the Vinča culture (Late Neolithic/Chalcolithic), known today in southeast Europe, have yielded well preserved architectural remains – burnt wattle and daub houses with rich inventory. The analysis of these buildings is usually limited to architectural features and to objects with specific inventory, interpreted as related to cult and ceremony. The areas were everyday activities were carried out, however, received less attention and very few possible working places for processing flint, bone, antler, leather and hide etc., were identified so far. The paper will focus on problems in identification and interpretation of activity areas and possible workshops. Problems are in both insufficient archaeological evidence and in models offered to interpret craft production in Vinča culture and in future both recovery techniques as well theoretical frameworks should be further developed. Several case studies related mainly to bone industry will be presented, such as probable antler workshop at Jakovo and possible activity areas related to use of bone and antler objects on other Vinča culture sites (Divostin, Grivac) .\n\nCyprus became a significant trade spot in the maritime networks of the East Mediterranean during the later 2nd millennium BCE.

It was recently determined to date to the Middle Pleistocene, in contrast with previous suggestions for a much older age. Its date demonstrates that H. naledi co-existed with larger-brained hominins in South Africa’s central interior. Moreover, it is contemporary with the beginning of the Middle Stone Age in the region (characterized by prepared core or mode 3 assemblages). In light of this, its discoverers have explicitly cast it as a potential producer of Middle Stone Age technologies (Berger et al. 2017). We develop a hypothesis on the ecological and technological niche Homo naledi likely occupied. We briefly review relevant elements H. naledi’s anatomy and their implications for its ecology. We provide an overview of the characteristics of the South African archaeological record contemporary with H. naledi. We reason from the principle of competitive exclusion and suggest a technological repertoire consisting of simple cores and flakes functioning in a niche focusing on extracted foods is most likely for Homo naledi. We contend that prepared core assemblages were associated with larger-brained populations, fossil remains of which are also known from South Africa’s central interior.

Homo naledi and Pleistocene hominin evolution in subequatorial Africa. eLife, 6, e24234.\n\nThe different criteria used to analyze and to categorize the results through the different research traditions make difficult to compare data. Although many technological approaches have been developed, there are still differences in method between the different countries in the study of the Middle Pleistocene industries in the Western side of Europe. The British research has been based on the typological system of Wymer or the morphometric system of Roe for the analysis and classification of handaxes, as well as on the simple description of shaping sequences developed by Newcomer and Wenban-Smith. In turn, the French traditions are mainly based on the typological view proposed by Bordes, on the complex approach of the chaine operatoire, and on the techno-functional approach proposed by Boëda. Meanwhile, the Spanish tradition has been highly influenced by the French school, with significant methodological developments coming from the Logical Analytic System. This work proposes a common method of analysis of the Acheulean technology to go beyond the local perspective and gain a regional point of view in the Western side of Europe. This requires a deep understanding of the underlying technology to identify the differences or similarities in processes and traditions of manufacture. The new methodology, applied in several sites of UK and France, is based on the selection of those technological attributes which give more information about the LCT and how they have been produced. Each tool will be analyzed as a unit and also divided in its three main morpho-potential sections: distal, medium and proximal parts. And, taking advantage of new technologies and combining the basic technological analysis with 3D models, we willto standardize the process of measurement and documentation of the pieces. This methodological approach is the base of a Post-doctoral Marie Skłodowska Curie project, entitle The Western European Acheulean Project, (ID. 748316).\n\nThe implication of cloth and/or clothing in ritual actions is amply testified in Aegean Late Bronze Age iconography. Nevertheless, their identification involves problems related to both our main iconographical sources, i.e. wall paintings and various sphragistic media (signet rings, seals and seal impressions/sealings). Pictorial wall paintings, which appear in Crete from late MM III and spread afterwards to Cyclades, Rhodes, Miletus and Mainland Greece, are in their vast majority poorly preserved, with the exception of Akrotiri (Thera) frescoes. So, we deal with partial (often) or dubious (occasionally) restorations, let alone the stylistic conventions. Drawing upon a common iconographical tradition, the much richer seal imagery, from the 16th century B.C. onwards, often fills the gaps of the fragmentary wall paintings. Usually however, features related to the limited sphragistic surface (miniature scale, lack of details, schematization), as well as the occasional poor preservation of the scenes, make their interpretation difficult. Data offered by miscellaneous media (figurines, vases, sarcophagi, faience models etc.) remain valuable though disparate. Despite the problems of ambiguity arisen, I aim at discussing the types of cloth and clothing detected in Aegean Late Bronze Age religious iconography and their role in specific rituals, with reference to their possible correlation with terms testified on Linear B tablets."
