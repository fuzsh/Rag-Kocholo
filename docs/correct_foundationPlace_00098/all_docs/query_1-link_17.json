The ability to quickly integrate AppsFlyer‘s SDK across Big Fish Games’ global apps saved significant development time, allowing UA managers to focus on the mission of scaling and engaging their global user base.\n\nIn the eyes of BigFish, AppsFlyer’s key benefits were:\n\nPowerful and easy to integrate attribution SDKs\n\nProven ability to measure and process events at massive scale in real-time\n\nIndustry-leading usability and customizable reporting capabilities that fit the needs of advanced mobile growth marketers\n\nAdvanced fraud protection to ensure data is clean and correctly attributed\n\n24/7, global support coverage with customer success teams across 15 offices worldwide, and a track record of first-class support with international, enterprise-grade clients\n\nResults\n\nAppsFlyer’s scale allowed Big Fish Games to streamline attribution data to make more informed and effective marketing decisions.\n\nAnthony Cross, VP User Acquisition, Data Science, & Product Management agreed, noting:\n\nUpgrading to AppsFlyer was a game changer for us. Comprehensive data provided by AppsFlyer is the north star for our growth team, enabling us to make better marketing decisions across our portfolio of games."
