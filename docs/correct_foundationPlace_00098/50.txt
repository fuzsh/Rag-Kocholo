Seattle-based game developer Big Fish Games will continue its North American expansion with a new talent hub in New Orleans, creating at least 40 jobs in the region.

Big Fish Games will be seeking quality assurance and corporate team members for its fourth location, which will be headquartered at The Shop coworking space.

“With every new software job in our region, we are not only creating more opportunity for our residents, we are also establishing Greater New Orleans as a diverse and productive technology hub,” said Michael Hecht, President and CEO of Greater New Orleans, Inc.

The company plans to partner with local universities and other partners to recruit and retain local talent.

“Big Fish is a collaborative company, and we are excited to work with partners who share our philosophy that making games should be fun as well as inclusive,” shared Larry Plotnick, President of Big Fish Games.
