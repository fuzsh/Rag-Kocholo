        "text": "STORY OF KOF '95\n\nIt's 1995, and once more an invitation to the King of Fighters arrives at the doorsteps of the world's most accomplished warriors—from none other than \"R\" again, no less! Could this really be Rugal, who supposedly perished in the explosion of his aircraft carrier the previous year?\n\nThis year's tournament is no mere repeat of the previous one, though. Indeed, it finds itself playing host to a trio of newcomers—Billy Kane, Eiji Kisaragi, and Iori Yagami—who assert their right to entry after defeating Team American Sports from KOF '94.\n\nWhat could Billy be after here? What ambition drives Kisaragi?\n\nAnd what is the goal of Iori Yagami, the sworn enemy of Kyo Kusanagi?\n\nWith Team American Sports out of the picture and new challengers in the mix, a grand scheme begins to unfold, threatening to pull heroes and hellions alike right into it!"
