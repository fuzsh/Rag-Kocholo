        "text": "Genre: Action\n\nPerspective: Side view\n\nVisual: 2D scrolling\n\nGameplay: Arcade, Fighting\n\nArt: Anime / manga\n\nNarrative: Martial arts\n\nPublished by: SNK of America\n\nDeveloped by: SNK Corporation\n\nReleased: 1995\n\nPlatform: Neo-Geo\n\nThe combat system has not undergone significant changes, mainly the existing mechanics have been improved. Now, after dodging a blow, you can retaliate against your opponent by pressing any of the attack buttons at that moment. A short jump appeared, which is performed by quickly pressing up. All returning characters have received new animations and moves, and the game speed has been slightly increased.\n\nThe main innovation was the ability to create your own team. The player can now freely choose any characters. However, you can only see the unique ending by playing as one of the standard teams.\n\nPlot"
