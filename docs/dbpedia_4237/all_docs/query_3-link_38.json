        "text": "HAMSTER's strange and random time-hopping will return in the coming week when The King of Fighters '95 joins the Switch eShop line-up on 12th October.\n\nThe second game in the series brings a rather welcome option that would go to become a series staple: You are not confined to pre-determined teams, so you can pick any characters from the roster to make your own dream trio. The Sports Team from the previous game didn't make the play-offs and has been replaced with the \"Rival Team\" made up of series favourite Iori Iagami, along with Billy Kane and Eiji from Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting fame respectively."
