        "text": "Year: 2000 | Publisher: SNK | Developer: SNK| Original format: Arcade | Version played: Arcade, Neo Geo\n\nThe year 2000: a brand new decade, a new century, and a new millennium. Fear of world-ending computer bugs aside, it was a time for optimism, of new beginnings. Except in the case of SNK whose fantastic decade, defined by the Neo Geo and its top drawer fighting games, was about to ring out to the sound of bankruptcy.\n\nNot that I would have noticed at the time. These were my college years. A time of very few lessons and many visits to the arcades, both the incredible Playland in Wakefield and the tiny but equally awesome Leeds arcade I’ve long forgotten the name of, situated next door to the superb import games shop New Generation Consoles. Both boasted rows of giant-screened Neo Geo arcade cabs with multiple King Of Fighters games positioned side by side in a murderer’s row of the genre’s best. It was, as the saying goes, a great time to be alive.\n\nNow, I’m not going to pretend I was the biggest KOF fan in these days. I was much more into Street Fighter, but it’s only with hindsight I realise just how lucky I was to be an arcade-goer around the turn of the century. My friends and I played the superb King Of Fighters ‘98 regularly but since SNK had released a new game in the series every year since ’94, there were plenty of options, each of them crammed with dozens of characters. Sometimes we’d hop from one KOF to another, jumping around in the history of the franchise as well as the physical space of the arcade.\n\nIt could be as bewildering as it was exciting. In comparison to Street Fighter, which had a reassuring familiarity I’d become used to over many years, King Of Fighters felt more unknowable. I struggled to master the mechanics and movesets enough to compete against others. I put this down to a few factors… Firstly, I’d never owned a console version in the 16-bit era like I had for Street Fighter, so there was no chance to practice at home. My opportunity to get to know it was limited by the number of coins in my pocket. Secondly, there were just so many characters that it was hard to know where to begin. Finally, and most importantly, there were so many games by this point, seven in total, that the subtle mechanical changes between each entry were hard to distinguish and recall from one entry to the next.\n\nNevertheless, I really liked these games. The ability to team up three characters in battle made them stand out from the one-on-one format of most other fighting games, the pixel art was second to none, and there was something about the characters; the classiest, most snappily dressed men and women in the genre, that gave SNK’s games a unique allure. But I never got enough time with them to really fall in love, at least until I was able to get my hands on some home versions.\n\nI loved King Of Fighters ‘95 on the Saturn, which came with its own ROM cartridge in addition to the CD, so Sega’s console could handle the vast number of sprites with ease. But it’s only in the last few years, after re-buying a Neo Geo AES console, that I’ve really put some quality time into the series.\n\nI’ve paid more money than is sensible, but less than would be certifiable, for Neo Geo carts of King Of Fighters ‘96 and 2000. Maybe it’s the rabid collector in me talking, but I think there’s something about paying a lot of money for a luxury collectible that encourages you to spend more time with it than you ordinarily would. Not to mention that there’s something about plugging those chunky cartridges into real hardware, then sitting back with an official SNK arcade stick and basking in the glow of a giant CRT television for an extended play session, away from the always-online distractions of modern consoles.\n\nIn fact, as well as playing KOF 2000 on a real Neo Geo for this blog post, I also played the emulated arcade version on Nintendo Switch so I could easily capture some screenshots. At a fraction of the price, this modern console release is obviously way more convenient and accessible than the real thing, but it’s not quite as enjoyable to me. The beautiful visuals aren’t quite as special on an LCD screen and the squishy controls are no substitute for the precision and robustness of SNK’s arcade stick.\n\nEither way, I’ve been able to spend some real quality time with this near 25 year old fighting game and it’s honestly been one of the most rewarding gaming experiences of my 2024. Focusing exclusively on this particular entry and avoiding the temptation to compare to others in the series, has allowed me to appreciate what I now believe may be an underrated King Of Fighters.\n\nI can’t really speak for the SNK fanbase but KOF 2000 doesn’t often seem to come up in conversation when players talk about their favourite entries. Before this week, I would have name-checked ’95, ’98 or even the most recent, excellent entry, XV before championing this one.\n\nWhat’s more, KOF 2000 occupies a unique position in SNK’s history that makes it an easy target for criticism. Since the legendary developer went bust during production, reducing their team down to a bare minimum, a number of cuts needed to be made so the game could be shipped before it was too late. Characters were apparently scrapped, certain bugs went unsquashed, gameplay wasn’t quite as balanced and the art style was unusually drab, ensuring the game struggled to stand out, especially when lined up in arcades next to its more celebrated predecessors.\n\nDespite all this, as I’ve learned through extended, focused play sessions that King Of Fighters 2000 has plenty to offer. In fact, I must admit I haven’t noticed the glitches myself. Although they obviously do exist; check out this compilation video of the game’s bugs for some amusing proof. The muted, colour-drained graphics are another common source of criticism, but I think they’re actually pretty cool, lending this entry a grittier and more mature look. As for the supposed lack of characters… You must be joking! It feels as crowded as ever.\n\nWith 35 playable characters, there’s even more choice than in KOF ‘99 and it even beats the bloated roster of Street Fighter Alpha 3, which was a firm favourite in the same era. And this is before you count all of the bonus characters who appear as optional “strikers’ who can be summoned in for a quick attack mid-battle. By my reckoning there are 43 such extra characters, bringing the grand total up to 78, a frankly astounding number of sprites for a game made by a developer on the brink of collapse.\n\nOf course, I’m sure many of the striker sprites are re-used from previous games but who cares when it’s so much fun to see them all together. You even get unexpected appearances from series not often represented in King Of Fighters. When the series began in 1994, it was ostensibly a crossover game between Art Of Fighting and Fatal Fury, with a few characters thrown in from Psycho Soldier and Ikari Warriors, but in 2000 you’ll see strikers from Samurai Shodown, Metal Slug, The Last Blade and even lesser known SNK games like Burning Fight, Kizuna Encounter and Robo Army. In a wonderful act of serendipity, this jamboree of cameos makes KOF 2000 feel like a fitting celebration of the history of SNK, just as the curtain fell on the company’s original incarnation.\n\nThe appeal of the strikers system isn’t just fan service though. It has a huge benefit to the gameplay. Introduced in KOF ‘99, the system changed the fundamentals of character selection so that instead of picking three characters, you now picked four. Then, when choosing the order of your fighters before each match, whoever you picked last would become your striker. What I didn’t appreciate until I spent more time playing the game is that you get to change which of your four fighters the striker is between every match, so if you look at the mechanic in a slightly different way, rather than choosing a striker, what you’re actually doing is selecting three fighters from a pool of four, which introduces way more variety to the game.\n\nThis is especially appealing to me simply because of the large number of unfamiliar characters there are to learn in any given King Of Fighters game. So when playing KOF 2000 I like to pick 2-3 tried and tested characters – Terry and Ryo are firm favourites – and then choose 1-2 I’m less familiar with. Then, by rotating through who is fully playable and who’s a striker, you get to have your cake and eat it, enjoying the comfort of familiar fighters while learning some new ones. This is something traditional one-on-one fighters cannot do and something the strikers system absolutely excels at. It initially feels like a nice little mechanic to help you out when you’re in a jam, but in actual fact it’s also an engine for amazing cameos and a way to get to know KOF’s enormous cast.\n\nI realise that many of the things I might praise about King Of Fighters 2000 are not exactly unique to this entry. Many of the characters are reused from previous games, while the striker system is expanded on even further in KOF 2001, but by focusing on this particular entry I’ve had an enormous amount of fun with it and come to appreciate the game in its own right. For me, the striker system introduces a significant improvement on previous games, including KOF ’99, which doesn’t feature the bonus strikers. This system has encouraged me to play with many more characters I likely would have left untouched in other games, deepening my understanding of the game itself and broadening the pool of fighters I’ll now feel comfortable selecting in other KOF entries. It has essentially primed me to enjoy the whole series a lot more. Which is great, because there are so many more still left to play…\n\nSIXTEEN LITTLE THINGS ABOUT THE KING OF FIGHTERS 2000 THAT I RATHER LIKED\n\nFinally, how about some music from The King Of Fighters 2000…"
