        "text": "King of Fighters - collection of all ten games on Neo Geo AES\n\nI have recently completed my King of Fighters collection on Neo Geo AES (all ten games, ranging from KOF 94 to KOF 2003). I remembered that I had been looking for King of Fighters history-type videos before, but never found one that showed how the series evolved. I decided to make a video which includes openings, photographs of the AES games, and in-game footage for all ten titles. The music is from various titles between 94 and 2003.\n\nI believe the series is important to the Neo Geo platform because it shows SNK's (the maker of Neo Geo) astounding energy and dedication - releasing a game every year as part of a series is a serious commitment!\n\nKing of Fighters 94\n\n* First game to feature 3 on 3 teams\n\n* Characters from many SNK franchises\n\n* Boss: Rugal\n\nKing of Fighters 95\n\n* Orochi Saga begins\n\n* Teams can be edited\n\n* Boss: Omega Rugal\n\nKing of Fighters 96\n\n* Introduction of rolling move\n\n* Super Desperation Moves are introduced\n\n* Boss: Goenitz\n\nKing of Fighters 97\n\n* Conclusion of Orochi Saga\n\n* Selectable Extra and Advanced modes\n\n* Boss: Orochi\n\nKing of Fighters 98\n\n* Has no storyline\n\n* Characters from all previous games\n\n* Boss: Rugal\n\nKing of Fighters 99\n\n* NESTS saga begins\n\n* Striker team members are introduced\n\n* Combat and Armor modes are introduced\n\n* Boss: Krizalid\n\nKing of Fighters 2000\n\n* Player-chosen Striker characters\n\n* New Strikers from other SNK games\n\n* Boss: Zero\n\nKing of Fighters 2001\n\n* Conclusion of NESTS saga\n\n* Flexible striker/fighter team ratio\n\n* Boss: Igniz\n\nKing of Fighters 2002\n\n* Has no storyline\n\n* Characters from 99-2001\n\n* Boss: Omega Rugal\n\nKing of Fighters 2003\n\n* Sacred Treasures saga begins\n\n* Introduction of tag system\n\n* Boss: Mukai"
