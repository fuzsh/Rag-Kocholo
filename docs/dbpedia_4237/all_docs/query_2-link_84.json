Truthfully, the answer to those questions is a simple one: it's fun. As rudimentary as that explanation may be, it's the truth.

Instead, our articles are meant to be taken as an abridged look into the past: covering significant changes in the series' history and storylines that are meant to help an all-new generation of fighting fans understand a little but more about the toughest competition that the Street Fighter series has ever had.\n\nFor our first installment, we'll be taking a look at the first titles in the KOF series, King of Fighters '94.\n\nKing of Fighters '94\n\nThough technically the beginning of the KOF franchise, King of Fighters '94 still had quite a bit of history behind it. In fact, the old SNK classic Fatal Fury is where it all originally began. As it turns out, the Southtown badass himself, Geese Howard started the tournament when he used the King of Fighters competition to eliminate any potential threats to his position as the city's most powerful man (plus, he used the gambling profits to fuel his criminal empire). And for quite some time Geese ruled with an iron first. That is, until the son of one of his victims (Jeff Bogard) named Terry Bogard came along and whipped his butt all the way out of a skyscraper window -- ending the KOF tournament and giving Terry and his brother Andy peace. Or so they thought...\n\nThe very next year, a mysterious new honcho by the name of Wolfgang Krauser became the new master of the King of Fighters tournament and made it his personal mission to defeat the man who destroyed his predecessor. And though Terry kicked his butt too, the seeds were planted for the first \"official\" King of Fighters game.\n\nIn it, a third man had taken over leadership of the King of Fighter tournament, a super-powerful Black Market baddy named Rugal Berstein. To make things more interesting, though, Rugal made a significant change to the rules -- requiring participants to fight in teams rather than individually. If one person lost a round against one opponent the next would take his place, and so on and so on. Once all three members of a team were defeated, their time in the tournament was over and the winning team would move on. The premise was quite simple really and it set the stage rather nicely for KOF '94.\n\nWinning the KOF tournament wasn't exactly roses, however, as the eventual victorious team (Team Japan, which consisted of original characters Kyo Kusanagi, Goro Daimon, and Benimaru Nikkaido) would have to square off against the tournament ringleader himself, Rugal. The stakes were quite high too -- as Rugal would add the fallen foes to his collection of steel-encased fighters that he had previously defeated in is career. Only when Kyo noticed that his father Saisyu was among the many statues aboard Rugal's personal ship known as the Black Noah was the team inspired enough to overcome Rugal's considerable strength and defeat him -- blowing up the ship in the process and obliteration Rugal Bernstein along with it.\n\nAs a game, the original King of Fighters may not be as advanced as most of today's flashy fighting games, but at the time it was actually quite advanced. In fact, it was the first game of its type to offer three-on-three battles (which have since become commonplace in several genre titles since) and it legitimized the idea of borrowing characters from several existing franchises to make one big super crossover that fans of various backgrounds could enjoy. The Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, Athena, and Ikari Warriors characters assembled together in a single game was considered a blockbuster move, and it quickly gained notoriety among those series fans as well as hardcore fighting nuts looking for alternatives to Street Fighter II.\n\nIn terms of its mechanics, KOF '94 was essentially a cross between Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting; with a much speedier response time than either. Granted, it wasn't as quick as Street Fighter, but each combatant still offered as many as five special moves apiece with familiar fireball and sonic boom motions that allowed veterans of Capcom's classic to become more easily acclimated. Unfortunately, the game did employ several odd \"upside down fireball\" maneuvers that created strange control hitches that affected your maneuverability and jumping prowess in addition to making for a rather limited combo system.\n\nBut even with these restrictions, King of Fighters '94 still offered a number of new features that weren't available with Ryu and Ken. User-controlled super move charges and the ability to sidestep projectiles, for example, were a terrific ideas that really opened up the possibilities. While the much more detailed backgrounds helped put it on par with the Street Fighter series as a viable substitute.\n\nBut that was just the beginning for SNK and its soon to be legendary series, as there were still much more impressive things still to come. Next time, we'll explore the next step in this fighting evolution with King of Fighters '95! See you then."
