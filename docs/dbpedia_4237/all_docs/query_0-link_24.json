        "text": "Did some minor research on the topic and I believe today is the 30th anniversary of the release of the first Art of Fighting game but most importantly the 30th anniversary of the longest standing active voice role of a video game character in history.\n\n🎉As of today, Japanese VA Harumi Ikoma has voiced King from the Art of Fighting series and The King of Fighter series for 30 years! 🎉\n\nHere's an excerpt from her page on the SNK Wiki:\n\nHarumi Ikoma (生駒 治美, Ikoma Harumi), born February 5th, 1970 in Osaka, is a Japanese voice actor. She is affiliated with J Productions. She is sometimes called by SNK to perform character image songs at SNK's special events. As Nakoruru, she also participates as a member of SNK's character image band, Band of Fighters. She was also one of the main hosts to the now defunct radio program, Neo Chupi. Prior to joining J Productions, she was affiliated with the Osaka TV Talent Bureau (TTB).\n\nThe King of Fighters XV, which came out early this year, would be her latest reprisal of the role. Outside of a drama CD and an OVA, she has been the sole voice of King throughout the both fighting game franchises and other spinoff SNK titles like Capcom vs. SNK.\n\nHere's a quick list of voiced game appearances from the SNK Wiki:\n\nArt of Fighting\n\nArt of Fighting 2\n\nThe King of Fighters '94\n\nThe King of Fighters '95\n\nThe King of Fighters '96\n\nThe King of Fighters '97\n\nThe King of Fighters '98\n\nThe King of Fighters '99\n\nCapcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000\n\nCapcom vs. SNK Pro\n\nCapcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001\n\nThe King of Fighters 2000\n\nThe King of Fighters 2001\n\nThe King of Fighters EX: Neo Blood\n\nThe King of Fighters 2002 - potential mid-boss & unlockable in console versions only\n\nThe King of Fighters Neowave\n\nThe King of Fighters 2003\n\nThe King of Fighters '94 Re-Bout\n\nThe King of Fighters XI\n\nThe King of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match\n\nThe King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match\n\nThe King of Fighters XIII\n\nThe King of Fighters XIV\n\nCR The King of Fighters\n\nThe King of Fighters XV\n\nThere's also some mobile games like KOF All Stars and the CG anime series The King of Fighters: Destiny where she voices King.\n\nThis is pretty significant as SNK would usually retain the same VAs for of the majority the cast of the KOF series throughout its run but there was a huge recast of voice roles in The King of FIghters XIV. The only characters that retained their old VAs are King, Benimaru, Athena, Geese, Kula, Maxima, Chang, Choi, and Tizoc/King of Dinosaurs. Ikoma as King existed before all of these characters and their respective current portrayals.\n\nNow I have to put a huge AF asterisk over this thread because:\n\nI am only 99% certain that Ikoma actually voiced King in the first Art of Fighting game but I'll make my case in a little bit.\n\nThere might be an active role for a video game character out there that is even older then Ikoma as King that has gone under my radar. I think I found some decent runner-ups though. More on this as well.\n\nI can't confirm with 100% certainty if 1992's Art of Fighting (aka 龍虎の拳) came out on the 24th of September. Various wikis claim it did on Japanese MVS arcades and internationally on the NEO GEO home console but there's no source to confirm this. It's basically an impossibility to get these dates rights for arcade games of those days and as such this sorta muddies the record.\n\nMy case of her doing this role since 1992\n\nThe first Art of Fighting game unfortunately did not credit the voice cast in the game. It also does the thing where barely anyone involved in the game is in the credits and the few staff that are used nicknames so they can't be identified and poached by rival game companies. Indeed, the Japanese games industry was wild like that back then.\n\nHere are the game's credits on MobyGames.\n\nHowever, she is credited on the 1994 sequel Art of Fighting 2. MobyGames page here.\n\nIf you compare King in AOF1:\n\nView: https://youtu.be/6Jmt9gvSg-Q?t=462\n\n...and then King in the Japanese version of AOF2 (the international version has an english dub):\n\nView: https://youtu.be/BUG9t-lkV2Y?t=55\n\n...its pretty clearly Ikoma in both games IMO but make of this what you will.\n\nThe case for potential usurpers/runner-ups to this record\n\nNow my research has lead me on different paths but here are two characters that I think make a case of good runner-ups for various reasons.\n\nMortal Kombat series creator and director Ed Boon has been yelling Scorpion's iconic \"GET OVER HERE\" callout for his spear-rope-thingy attack and its variations since the beginning of the franchise to the latest entry Mortal Kombat 11. The first game came out in October 8, 1992. This would be a few weeks after the possible confirmed release date of Art of Fighting. This is already a shaky case for just the date alone but you can argue he's not reeeeeeaally the current portrayer of Scorpian. The character has had actual actors portray the role for multiple games now. Boon only provides the attack callout these days as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the series roots.\n\nHere's a clip of Boon yelling the line on a ComiCon panel.\n\nIf you're some weirdo that counts pinball games as video games then Charles Martinet as Mario may have preceded Harumi Ikoma as King by months.\n\nThe Gottlieb produced Super Mario Bros. Pinball (allegedly) released on April 25, 1992 has Martinet making callouts as Mario in an uncredited (and unpayed) role. If you not a \"pinballs are video games\" freak then his first game portrayal as Mario was the updated MS-DOS version of Mario Teaches Typing that came out in 1994. Here's a Reddit post in which the OP claims Martinet confirms this uncredited role. Again, make of this of you will.\n\nHere's a video of the pinball machine in action. That sounds like Charles Martinet to me.\n\nIn conclusion...\n\nIf you know any other characters that preceded Harumi Ikoma's portrayal of King then please post it on this thread. I'm pretty certain there's no other video game character that has been portrayed by an actor or voice actor longer than her.\n\nLet's give a hand to the One True King of The King of Fighters\n\nHere's some clips of Harumi Ikoma doing full dialogue as King in KOF 14 and 15.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/K9oYr6HOkz4?t=1643\n\nView: https://youtu.be/LnTJNDR-j1U?t=863\n\nSuprise Rose me if old.\n\nDid some minor research on the topic and I believe today is the 30th anniversary of the release of the first Art of Fighting game but most importantly the 30th anniversary of the longest standing active voice role of a video game character in history.\n\n🎉As of today, Japanese VA Harumi Ikoma has voiced King from the Art of Fighting series and The King of Fighter series for 30 years! 🎉\n\nHere's an excerpt from her page on the SNK Wiki:\n\nThe King of Fighters XV, which came out early this year, would be her latest reprisal of the role.
