        "text": "Game Play\n\nThe next game in the series is similar to The King of Fighters '94. Like as before, a player must pick a team of 3 fighters then face other teams before reaching the bosses. However, instead of picking a pre-set team of three, there is now the option to pick anyone from any team opening up many possible combinations. This game properly kicks off the Orochi storyline in King of Fighters.\n\nAll fighters from the last game return with the exception of the USA Sports team (Heavy D!, Lucky and Brian) who have been replaced with Team Vengeance: Iori Yagami, Eiji Kisaragi (from Art of Fighting 2) and Billy Kane (from Fatal Fury series).\n\nThe bosses of the game are Saishu Kusanagi (Kyo Kusanagi's father) and an Orochi-powered version of Rugal, called Omega Rugal.\n\nVAPS Arcade/Coin-Op King Of Fighters '95, The Census\n\nThere are 15,014 members of the Video Arcade Preservation Society / Vintage Arcade Preservation Society, 9,566 whom participate in our arcade census project of games owned, wanted, or for sale. Census data currently includes 165,373 machines (6,956 unique titles).\n\nVery Common - There are 110 known instances of this machine owned by King Of Fighters '95, The collectors who are active members. Of these, 3 of them are original dedicated machines. One is a conversion in which game circuit boards (and possibly cabinet graphics) have been placed in (and on) another game cabinet. 106 of them are only circuit boards which a collector could put into a generic case if desired.\n\nFor Sale - There are 3 active VAPS members with a King Of Fighters '95, The circuit boards for sale.\n\nWanted - No active members have added this machine to their wish list.\n\nThis game ranks a 41 on a scale out of 100 (100 = most often seen, 1=least common) in popularity based on census ownership records.\n\nRarity and Popularity independently are not necessarily indications of value.
