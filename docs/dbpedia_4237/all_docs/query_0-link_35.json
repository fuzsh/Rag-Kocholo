Its impact on the environment is heavily debated, particularly in relation to climate forcing attributed to emissions at cruising altitudes and the noise and the deterioration of air quality at ground-level due to airport operations. This latter environmental issue is of particular interest to the scientific community and policymakers, especially in relation to the breach of limit and target values for many air pollutants, mainly nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, near the busiest airports and the resulting consequences for public health. Despite the increased attention given to aircraft emissions at ground-level and air pollution in the vicinity of airports, many research gaps remain. Sources relevant to air quality include not only engine exhaust and non-exhaust emissions from aircraft, but also emissions from the units providing power to the aircraft on the ground, the traffic due to the airport ground service, maintenance work, heating facilities, fugitive vapours from refuelling operations, kitchens and restaurants for passengers and operators, intermodal transportation systems, and road traffic for transporting people and goods in and out to the airport. Many of these sources have received inadequate attention, despite their high potential for impact on air quality. This review aims to summarise the state-of-the-art research on aircraft and airport emissions and attempts to synthesise the results of studies that have addressed this issue. It also aims to describe the key characteristics of pollution, the impacts upon global and local air quality and to address the future potential of research by highlighting research needs.\n\nKeywords: Aviation, Atmospheric pollution, Emissions, LTO cycles, Particulate matter, Oxides of nitrogen\n\nHighlights\n\n•\n\nAviation is globally growing (+5% y−1) mainly driven by developing countries.\n\n•\n\nAirport operations cause an increase in ground-level pollution.\n\n•\n\nChemical and physical properties of the emitted gases and particles are reviewed.\n\n•\n\nAn overview of other additional sources within airports is provided.\n\n•\n\nFuture research needs on aircraft emissions are highlighted.\n\nList of abbreviations\n\nAAFEX\n\nAlternative Aviation Fuel Experiment\n\nAEs\n\nAirport emissions\n\nAPEX\n\nAircraft Particle Emissions eXperiment\n\nAPU\n\nAuxiliary power unit\n\nBC\n\nBlack carbon\n\nC∗\n\nEffective saturation concentration\n\nCIs\n\nChemi-ions\n\nCIMS\n\nChemical ionisation mass spectrometry\n\nEC\n\nElemental carbon\n\nEI\n\nEmission index\n\nEXCAVATE\n\nEXperiment to Characterise Aircraft Volatile Aerosol and Trace-species Emissions\n\nF00\n\nEngine thrust expressed as a percentage of maximum rated power\n\nFGEP\n\nFixed ground electrical power\n\nFSC\n\nFuel sulphur content\n\nFT\n\nFischer–Tropsch fuel\n\nGMD\n\nGeometric number mean diameter\n\nGPUs\n\nGround power units\n\nGRPs\n\nGround running procedures\n\nGSEs\n\nGround service equipments\n\nICAO\n\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization\n\nLTO\n\nLanding and take-off cycle\n\nOC\n\nOrganic carbon\n\nNMHC\n\nNon-methane hydrocarbon\n\nNOx\n\nNitrogen oxides (NO + NO2)\n\nNOy\n\nReactive odd nitrogen (NOx and their oxidation products)\n\nOA\n\nOrganic aerosol\n\nPAHs\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\n\nPM\n\nParticulate matter\n\nPM1\n\nParticulate matter (aerodynamic diameter less than 1 μm)\n\nPM2.5\n\nParticulate matter (aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm)\n\nPM10\n\nParticulate matter (aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm)\n\nRF\n\nRadiative forcing\n\nRPK\n\nRevenue passenger kilometres\n\nRTK\n\nRevenue tonne kilometres\n\nSARS\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome\n\nSIA\n\nSecondary inorganic aerosol\n\nSN\n\nSmoke number\n\nSOA\n\nSecondary organic aerosol\n\nSVOCs\n\nSemi-volatile organic compounds\n\nTC\n\nTotal carbon\n\nTF\n\nTurbofan engine\n\nTIM\n\nTime-in-mode\n\nTJ\n\nTurbojet engine\n\nTP\n\nTurboprop engine\n\nTS\n\nTurboshaft engine\n\nUFP\n\nUltrafine particles (diameter <100 nm)\n\nUHC\n\nUnburned hydrocarbons\n\nVOCs\n\nVolatile organic compounds\n\nε\n\nAbundance ratio ((•SO3+H2SO4)/total sulphur)\n\nξ\n\nPartitioning coefficient\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAmong pollution issues, poor air quality attracts a high level of interest within the scientific community and engages public opinion because of the known relationship between exposure to many air pollutants and increased adverse short- and long-term effects on human health (e.g., Schwartz, 1997, Ayres, 1998, Brunekreef and Holgate, 2002, Kampa and Castanas, 2008, Maynard, 2009, Yang and Omaye, 2009, Rückerl et al., 2011). In addition, air pollution can seriously impair visibility (Hyslop, 2009), may damage materials in buildings and cultural heritage (Watt et al., 2009, Screpanti and De Marco, 2009) and has direct and indirect effects upon climate (Ramanathan and Feng, 2009). While air pollution remains a major concern for developing countries (Fenger, 2009, Liaquat et al., 2010) as a result of the rapid growth of population, energy demand and economic growth, developed countries have experienced a significant decline in the concentrations of many air pollutants over the past decade.\n\nAirport emissions (AEs) have received increasing attention in recent years because of the rapid growth of air transport volumes and the expected expansion to meet capacity needs for future years (Amato et al., 2010, Kurniawan and Khardi, 2011, Kinsey et al., 2011). Most studies highlight knowledge gaps (e.g., Webb et al., 2008, Wood et al., 2008a, Lee et al., 2010) which are a matter of concern as the literature indicates that aircraft emissions can significantly affect air quality near airports (Unal et al., 2005, Carslaw et al., 2006, Herndon et al., 2008, Carslaw et al., 2008, Mazaheri et al., 2009, Dodson et al., 2009) and in their surroundings (Farias and ApSimon, 2006, Peace et al., 2006, Hu et al., 2009, Amato et al., 2010, Jung et al., 2011, Hsu et al., 2012). Emission standards for new types of aircraft engines have been implemented since the late 1970s by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through the Committee on Aircraft Engine Emissions (CAEE) and the subsequent Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP). One of the key actions of the ICAO committees was the provision on engine emissions in Volume II of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the so-called “Chicago Convention”, which recommended protocols for the measurement of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO + NO2 = NOx), unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and smoke number (SN) for new engines (ICAO, 2008). Standards were listed on a certification databank (EASA, 2013), which represents a benchmark for engine emissions performance and is used in many regulatory evaluations (ICAO, 2011). This regulation has produced significant improvements in engine and fuel efficiency and technical progress to reduce emissions. However, although these efforts have led to a substantial reduction in direct aircraft emissions over the past two decades, these gains may be offset by the forecast growth of the aviation industry and the resulting increase in airport traffic (ICAO, 2011). Furthermore, the ICAO regulation address only four main generic pollutants and a more detailed chemical and physical characterisation of exhausts is required to quantitatively and qualitatively assess aircraft emissions. An increasing number of studies provide a detailed chemical speciation for many exhaust compounds, including gases and airborne particulate matter (e.g., Anderson et al., 2006, Herndon et al., 2008, Agrawal et al., 2008, Mazaheri et al., 2009, Onasch et al., 2009, Herndon et al., 2009, Kinsey et al., 2011, Mazaheri et al., 2011, Santoni et al., 2011). However, the literature remains very sparse and many questions remain unresolved because of the large differences in measurement strategies, technologies and methods, compounds analysed and environments studied.\n\nAircraft exhausts are only one of several sources of emission at an airport (ICAO, 2011). Although exhaust plumes from aircraft engines were conventionally considered to account for most of the emissions, other sources are present within modern airports and contribute to air pollution at the local scale. Among these, tyre, brake and asphalt wear and the re-suspension of particles due to the turbulence created by the aircraft movements can account for large fractions of total particulate matter mass (e.g., British Airports Authority, 2006), but their chemical and physical characteristics have been investigated in only a few studies (Bennett and Christie, 2011, Bennett et al., 2011). Moreover, the emissions of the units providing power to the aircraft on the ground have received relatively little consideration despite their potentially high impact on the local air quality (Schäfer et al., 2003, Ratliff et al., 2009, Mazaheri et al., 2011). These units include the auxiliary power units (APUs), which are small on-board gas-turbine engines, and the ground power units (GPUs) provided by airports. In addition, airport ground service equipment (GSEs) further impact the air quality (e.g., Nambisan et al., 2000, Amin, 2001, Schäfer et al., 2003). GSEs include most of the equipment that an airport offers as a service for flights and passengers and includes a large number of vehicles, such as passenger buses, baggage and food carriers, container loader, refilling trucks, cleaning, lavatory services and de/anti-icing vehicles, and tugs, which are used to move any equipment or to push the aircraft between gates and taxiways. Only few studies are available on the air traffic-related emissions produced by ground services such as GSEs, GPUs or APUs (e.g., Webb et al., 2008, Ratliff et al., 2009, Mazaheri et al., 2011, Presto et al., 2011).\n\nAdditional sources may also be present at airports, including maintenance work, heating facilities, fugitive vapours from refuelling operations, kitchens and restaurants for passengers and operators, etc. Moreover, as many airports are located far from cities, their emission inventories should also include sources not directly present within a terminal, but on which the airport has an influence. These sources may include intermodal transportation systems or road traffic including private cars, taxis, shuttle buses and trucks for transporting people and goods in and out of the airport.\n\nAs most large airports are located near heavily populated urban settlements, in combination they have a potentially significant impact on the environment and health of people living in their vicinity. For example, 150 airports in the USA are located in areas designated to be in non-attainment for one or more criteria air pollutants (Ratliff et al., 2009). In undertaking air quality assessments and the development of successful mitigation strategies, it is therefore fundamental to consider all the aspects associated with the entire “airport system”. However, current information on many aspects of this polluting source is inadequate, including a detailed speciation of hydrocarbons, physicochemical characteristics of particles, volatile and semi-volatile emissions and especially the secondary transformations from the aging of aircraft exhausts and other airport-related emissions. Some of these gaps are well summarised in a US Transportation Research Board report (Webb et al., 2008).\n\n1.1. Aims and outline of the review\n\nSince the scientific literature on AEs remains very sparse and many questions are still open, this review aims to summarise the state-of-the-art of airport emissions research and attempts to synthesise and analyse the published studies. An overview of current information on airport-related emissions is presented and the key characteristics of the pollution and the impacts on the local and global air quality are discussed. This review further summarises the various methodologies used for measurements and attempts to critically interpret the data available in the literature. Finally, this review will highlight priority areas for research.\n\nThe next section traces the main stages of the development of civil aviation, by focussing especially on the changes and development strategies of modern airport systems. Recent traffic data and statistics are presented and the trends are also discussed in order to understand the potential future growth of air transport, which is fundamental to forecasting the impacts of aviation in future years. The third section gives an overview of the operation of aircraft engines, briefly discusses the most widely used technologies, describes some fuel characteristics, such as the sulphur content, and analyses the current use and future jet fuel consumption scenarios. The fourth section reviews the current information on aircraft engine exhaust: the landing and take-off cycles are described since they are commonly used to assess aircraft emissions during the operational conditions within an airport and within the atmospheric surface boundary layer; the main gaseous and particulate-phase compounds emitted by aircraft are listed and their key chemical and physical characteristics are described in separate subsections. A summary of data on the emission indices for many pollutants is also provided. The fifth section describes the non-exhaust emissions related to aircraft operations, such as the tyre and brake wear and the re-suspension of runway material, which have been little investigated even though they may have serious impacts on local air quality. The sixth section reviews data on the non-aircraft emissions potentially present within an airport, including the ground service equipment emissions, the auxiliary/ground power units and others. The seventh section presents the results of studies conducted indoors and outdoors at airports to directly assess the impacts of AEs upon human health. Finally, this paper reviews the results of the recent literature on aircraft emissions and other airport-related contributions to highlight the potential role of AEs upon local air quality.\n\n2. Present scenarios and future perspectives of civil aviation and airports\n\nThe Airport Council International (ACI, 2013) has reported recent statistics on the air traffic volumes for 2012: more than 79 million aircraft movements carried annually 5.7 billion passengers between 1598 airports located in 159 countries, and reported that the total cargo volume handled by airports was 93 million tonnes. However, these numbers are expected to further increase in the forthcoming decades: in the past half century, the aviation industry has experienced a strong and rapid expansion as the world economy has grown and the technology of air transport has developed (Baughcum et al., 1999). Generally, air traffic has been expressed as revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) by multiplying the number of revenue-paying passengers aboard the vehicle by the travelled distance, or occasionally in revenue tonne kilometres (RTK). shows the absolute growth of aviation recorded by ICAO in terms of RPK, RTK and aircraft kilometres from the 1930s to today (ICAO, 2013, Airlines for America, 2013). Despite some global-scale events, such as the Gulf crisis (1991), the terrorist attack of 11th September 2011, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002–2003 and the recent global economic crisis (2008–2009), an average annual growth rate of 5% was observed and this trend is expected to continue over the next decades mainly driven by the economic growth of emerging regions (ACI, 2007, ACI, 2008, Airbus, 2012, Boeing, 2013). It is anticipated that there will be more than 9 billion passengers globally by 2025 and more than 214 million tonnes of total world freight traffic are forecast over almost 120 million air traffic movements (ACI, 2007). The future growth of air transport will inevitably lead to the growth of airline fleets and route networks and will therefore lead to an associated increase in airport capacity in terms of both passengers and cargo. This poses questions as to the consequent impact on air quality.\n\n3. Aircraft: characteristics and in-use technologies\n\nEmissions from aircraft engines are recognised as a major source of pollutants at airports and have been extensively investigated over the past 40 years. Initially, the main historical concern for supersonic aircraft was over stratospheric ozone depletion (Johnston, 1971) and secondarily about the formation of contrails at cruising heights (Murcray, 1970, Schumann, 2005) and indirect effect on the Earth's radiative budgets (Kuhn, 1970). Apart the development of the Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144, a supersonic fleet flying in the stratosphere was never developed and today all commercial airliners are subsonic equipped with turbofan or turboprop engines. Therefore, the main present issue arising from civil aviation has today shifted to the increased levels of ozone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere resulting from the atmospheric chemistry of emitted NOx (Lee et al., 2010 and reference therein). Furthermore, the development of increasingly restrictive legislation on ambient air quality and the implementation of enhanced monitoring networks in many developed countries has highlighted the effects of aircraft emissions at ground-level and the deterioration of air quality near airports.\n\n3.1. Engines\n\nEngines for civil and general aviation are generally classified as gas turbine engines (turbofan and turboprop) fuelled with aviation kerosene (also named jet fuel) and internal combustion piston engines fuelled with aviation gasoline, often referred as avgas (ICAO, 2011). The majority of modern airliners are equipped with turbofan engines. These engines are derived from predecessor turbojet engines developed during World War II. A turbojet is composed of an inlet compressor, a combustion section adding and igniting fuel, one or more turbines extracting energy from the exhaust gas in expansion and driving the compressor. A final exhaust nozzle accelerates the exhaust gas from the back of the engine to generate thrust. Turbofan engines use a turbojet as a core to produce energy for thrust and for driving a large fan placed in front of the compressor. In modern airliners, the fan provides most of the thrust. The “bypass ratio” refers to the ratio of mass flux bypassing the combustor and turbine to the mass flux through the core: high-bypass ratios are preferred for civil aviation for good fuel efficiency and low noise. Some small and regional airliners are instead equipped with turboprop engines, which use a turbine engine core fitted with a reduction gear to power propellers. A simplified diagram of a turbofan engine is provided in . In August 2013 the ICAO (EASA, 2013) listed a total of 487 in-use turbofan engines (including packages): provides a summary of the current engine families mounted in the most popular airliners (75% of total in-use turbofan engines).\n\nTable 1\n\nManufacturerEngine familyMain aircraft and number of enginesFuel and emissions per LTO cycle (kg)FuelCONOxHCGeneral ElectricCF6 seriesA300 (2); A310 (2); A330 (2); B747 (4); B767 (2); MD DC-10 (3); MD-11 (3)811 ± 7611 ± 512 ± 22.3 ± 2.2GE90 seriesB777 (2)1159 ± 14114 ± 725 ± 51.1 ± 0.8GEnx seriesB747 (4); B787 (2); replacing CF6 series827 ± 747 ± 110 ± 30.2 ± 0.1CMF InternationalCFM56 seriesA318 (2); A319 (2); A320 (2); A321 (2); A340 (4); B737 (2): MD DC-8 (4)419 ± 466 ± 25 ± 10.6 ± 0.4Pratt & WhitneyJT8D seriesB707 (4); B727 (3); B737 (2); MD DC-9 (2); MD80 (2)477 ± 355 ± 24 ± 11 ± 0.9JT9D seriesA300 (2); A310 (2); B747 (4); B767 (2); MD DC-10 (3)842 ± 4519 ± 1013 ± 17 ± 4.8PW 4000 seriesA300 (2); A310 (2); B747 (4); B767 (2); B777 (2); MD DC-11 (3)966 ± 1508 ± 317 ± 61 ± 0.8Rolls-RoyceRB211 seriesB747 (4); B757 (2); B767 (2); L1011 (3); Tu-204 (2)852 ± 12815 ± 1515 ± 57.1 ± 11.1Trent seriesA330 (2); A340 (4); A380 (4); B777 (2); B787 (2)817 ± 3705 ± 219 ± 40.2 ± 0.3BMW Rolls-RoyceBR700 seriesB717 (2)332 ± 324 ± 14 ± 10.1 ± 0.1International Aero EnginesV2500 seriesA319 (2); A320 (2); A321 (2); MD-90 (2)452 ± 353 ± 0.46 ± 10.04 ± 0.01Aviadvigatel' Solov'ëvD30 seriesTu-154 (3)622 ± 11021 ± 65 ± 15.5 ± 2.4\n\nReciprocating piston engines are predominately fitted in small-sized aircraft typically related to private use, flying clubs, flight training, crop spraying and tourism. Internal piston engines run under the same basic principles as spark ignition engines for cars, but generally require higher performance. Four-stroke-cycle engines are commonly used, more rarely these can be two-stroke and occasionally diesel. The principal difference between jet and piston engines is that combustion is continuous in jet engines and intermittent in piston engines. Other flying vehicles may be present within an airport, such as helicopters. These vehicles are usually less numerous than the airliners in most terminals, but in some circumstances their contribution to the air quality cannot be disregarded. Today, most modern helicopters are equipped with turboshaft engines, whose functioning is similar to a turbojet but are optimised to generate shaft power instead of jet thrust. This review abbreviates turbojet (TJ), turbofan (TF), turboprop (TP) and turboshaft (TS).\n\n3.2. Fuel characteristics\n\nAt the current time, almost all aviation fuel (jet fuel) is extracted from the middle distillates of crude oil (kerosene fraction), which distils between the gasoline and the diesel fractions. The kerosene-type fuels most used worldwide in civil aviation are of Jet A and Jet A-1 grades: Jet A is used in most of the world, except North America where Jet A-1 is used. An exhaustive review of jet fuel production processes is given elsewhere (Liu et al., 2013). The specifications of such fuels are addressed by two organizations, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MOD). Jet A is used for almost all commercial aviation flying within or from the USA and is supplied against the ASTM D1655 specification. It has a flash point minimum of 38 °C and a freeze point maximum of −40 °C. Jet A-1 is widely used outside the USA and follows the UK DEF STAN 91-91 (Jet A-1) and ASTM D1655 (Jet A-1) specifications. It has same flash point as Jet A but a lower freeze point (maximum of −47 °C) and a mean C/H ratio of C12H23 (Lewis et al., 1999, Chevron Corporation, 2006, Lee et al., 2010). Other fuels can be used as an alternative to Jet A-1. Jet B is a wide-cut type fuel covering both the naphtha and kerosene fractions of crude oil and is used in very cold climates, e.g. in northern Canada where its thermodynamic characteristics (mainly lower freeze point and higher volatility) are suitable for handling and cold starting. ASTM publishes a specification for Jet B, but in Canada it is supplied against the Canadian specification CAN/CGSB 3.23. Other specifications also exist such as DCSEA (France) and GHOST (Russia). TS-1 is the main jet fuel grade available in Russian and CIS states, along with T-1, T-2 and RT; it is a kerosene-type fuel with slightly higher volatility (flash point is 28 °C minimum) and lower freeze point (<−50 °C) compared to Jet A and A-1 fuels. Various types of jet fuels are instead regulated by Chinese specifications: RP-1 and RP-2 are kerosene-type fuels similar to Russian TS-1, while RP-4 to Jet B. Nowadays, virtually all jet fuel in China is RP-3, which is quite comparable to Jet A-1 (Shell, 2013). Fuels for military purposes are formulated for high-performances and are regulated separately by many governments; some of these (JP grades for USA and NATO forces) were used in several studies (e.g., Anderson et al., 2006, Chen. et al., 2006, Cowen et al., 2009, Cheng et al., 2009, Cheng and Corporan, 2010, Santoni et al., 2011). The kerosene-based JP-8 grade is currently the primary fuel for NATO aircraft. Corporan et al. (2011) reported some JP-8 characteristics.\n\nJet fuels are a mixture of thousands of different hydrocarbons. The range of their molecular weights is restricted by the distillation: in kerosene-type fuels (e.g., Jet A and Jet A-1) the carbon number ranges between about 8 and 16, while in wide-cut jet fuels (Jet B), between about 5 and 15. Spicer et al. (1994) reported that jet fuel is primarily composed of species with five or more carbons and 70% of the compounds by weight contain 11–14 carbon atoms. Most of the hydrocarbons in jet fuel are members of the normal paraffins, iso-paraffin, cycloparaffin, aromatic and alkene classes: 20% n-paraffins, 40% iso-paraffin, 20% naphthenes and 20% aromatics are typical (Lindstedt and Maurice, 2000, Liu et al., 2013 and reference therein). Moreover, a series of different additives are required or approved for use by ASTM and DEF STAN specifications to enhance or maintain some fuel properties, improve performance or handling. Among those approved for Jet A and Jet A-1 fuels, some hindered phenols serve as antioxidants, the di-ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acts as icing inhibitor, the N,N′-disalicylidene-1,2-propane diamine is added as chelating agent for many metal ions. Other additives act as electrical conductivity/static dissipaters, corrosion inhibitor and biocides: a summary is listed in Chevron Corporation (2006).\n\nThe aviation industry is nowadays investing significant effort towards the use of alternative fuels (Blakey et al., 2011, Williams et al., 2012). Since aircraft emissions are recognised to be closely linked to the fuel composition (Beyersdorf et al., 2013 and reference therein), recently the introduction of synthetic fuels and bio-fuels instead of common oil-derivate jet fuels has been much discussed in terms of beneficial effects upon exhaust emissions (e.g., Corporan et al., 2005, Corporan et al., 2007, DeWitt et al., 2008, Timko et al., 2010a, Corporan et al., 2011, Lobo et al., 2011, Williams et al., 2012, Cain et al., 2013). Among others, the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) fuel seems to be a potential candidate for replacing, or mixing with, oil-derived conventional jet fuels. The FT reaction was developed in the first half of twentieth century and uses a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to produce a complex product stream of paraffins, olefins, and oxygenated compounds such as alcohols and aldehydes via product upgrading (e.g., cracking, fractionation, and isomerisation). The mechanism is explained in Liu et al. (2013). The FT process leads to a fuel with low aromatic content and no sulphur, which are reported to be beneficial in reduction of emissions of particulate matter and its precursors from aircraft engines (Corporan et al., 2007, Timko et al., 2010a, Lobo et al., 2011). Corporan et al. (2011) report gas chromatograms and hydrocarbon content of JP-8 and various alternative jet fuels. To study the effects of FT fuel usage on aircraft gaseous and particulate emissions the Alternative Aviation Fuel Experiment (AAFEX) was carried out in 2009: results are spread across various papers (e.g., Lee et al., 2011, Santoni et al., 2011, Anderson et al., 2011, Kinsey et al., 2012a, Kinsey et al., 2012b, Beyersdorf et al., 2013).\n\nAvgas for general aviation is distilled separately from the most common motor gasoline and is formulated for stability, safety, and predictable performance under a wide range of environments. Nowadays there are two main grades (100 and 100LL low lead) regulated by the ASTM D910 and UK DEF STAN 91-90 specifications. Tetraethyl Pb is added to avgas for increasing fuel octane and avgas 100LL has a lead content up to 0.56 g Pb L−1. The impact of general aviation is under discussion, since it was reported as one of the largest remaining source of lead emissions to the air in the USA (e.g., Carr et al., 2011). Avgas is principally composed of isoparaffinic and aromatic hydrocarbons and their carbon numbers vary from about 4 (butane) to 10, with the most prevalent carbon number being 8 (Chevron Corporation, 2006). It may include tetraethyl lead as antiknock additive, icing inhibitors, antioxidants and others.\n\n3.3. Sulphur content in fuels\n\nOver the past decades there has been a worldwide trend to decrease sulphur content in fuels and many jurisdictions, including the USA and the European Union, have recently required very low sulphur levels in road and marine fuels to reduce the SOx and particulate matter emissions from the transport sector. A similar reduction has not occurred for jet fuel although at the beginning of the 2000s the IPCC indicated that reducing the sulphur content of kerosene will reduce SOx emissions and sulphate particle formation (IPCC, 1999). The maximum sulphur content of aviation fuel has remained at 3 g S kg Fuel−1, or 3000 ppm by mass (Lewis et al., 1999, Ebbinghaus and Wiesen, 2001, Anderson et al., 2005, Barrett et al., 2012). However, lower values of fuel sulphur content (FSC) have commonly been reported: Fahey et al. (1999) stated that in the world market at the beginnings of the 2000s the FSC was near 400 ppm; Hileman et al. (2010) reported that average FSC in commercial Jet A, Jet A-1 and military JP-8 fuel grades varied between 550 and 750 ppm; Agrawal et al. (2008) reported that FSC in the fuel was 300 ppm. Popovicheva et al. (2004) and Demirdjian et al. (2007) reported that the aviation kerosene TS-1 has a FSC of 1100 ppm and less than 10−4 wt.% of metals.\n\nFSC in jet fuels is directly related to the SO2 emissions in aircraft exhaust (e.g., Arnold et al., 1998a, Schumann et al., 1998, Hunton et al., 2000). Some research projects, such as APEX-1, were designed to study the effects of FSC on aircraft engine emissions (e.g., Wey et al., 2006, Wey et al., 2007, Kinsey, 2009, Onasch et al., 2009). Generally the studies reported that the emissions of both SO2 and sulphates are proportional to S levels in fuels, but no systematic difference between the low and high sulphur fuels in terms of other emitted organic sulphur species (OCS and CS2) were reported (Anderson et al., 2006). The conversion of S(IV) to S(VI) is amply discussed later in this review.\n\nRecently, the impact of ultra-low sulphur jet fuel (15 ppm) upon public health, climate, and economics was examined by Barrett et al. (2012). They reported that the use of ultra-low sulphur fuels on a global-scale will cost 1−4 billion US $ per year, but may prevent 900−4000 air quality-related premature mortalities per year. Moreover, Barrett and co-authors also stated that the radiative forcing (RF) associated with reductions in atmospheric sulphate, nitrate, and ammonium loading can be estimated as +3.4 mW m−2, i.e. equivalent to about 1/10th of the warming due to CO2 emissions from aviation.\n\n3.4. Current use and future jet fuel consumption scenarios\n\nThe availability of reliable information on fuel consumption is essential to make robust estimates of aviation emissions at both global and regional scales. Various estimates of aviation fuel consumption are available in the literature and generally refer only to jet fuel, since piston-powered flights were estimated to account for approximately 2% of propeller (piston plus turboprops) and ∼0.05% of total (propeller plus jet) fuel burn (Kim et al., 2007). Gauss et al. (2006) estimated a total of 169 Tg fuel globally burned in 2000, of which 152 Tg is due to civil flights. The AERO2k global aviation emissions inventories reported a total of 176 Tg of kerosene used in 2002 for both civil (156 Tg) and military (19.5 Tg) aviation (Eyers et al., 2004); other studies of the 2000–2005 period estimated that the global aviation industry consumed approximately 170–203 Tg of kerosene per year with an evident decrease in 2001–2002 following the drop of aviation traffic due to the 11th September 2001 and SARS events (Kim et al., 2007); Wilkerson et al., 2010, Whitt et al., 2011 and Olsen et al. (2013) reported that the global commercial aircraft fleet burned 188 Tg of fuel in 2006; Chèze et al. (2011) reported a world consumption of 229 Mt of jet fuel in 2008. These estimates accounted for approximately 3% of current annual fossil fuel energy usage (Barrett et al., 2010, and reference therein). Data from OPEC (Mazraati, 2010) stated that the aviation sector in 2006 was the second major consumer of total oil demand in the transportation sector (11.2%) and accounted for 5.8% of total oil consumed in the world. Given the past and future growth of the aviation industry, this consumption may rise further: AERO2k emission inventories estimated a forecast scenario for 2025 in which the fuel demand for aviation will be 327 Tg y−1 (Eyers et al., 2004); Chèze et al. (2011) reported that the world jet fuel demand is projected to grow by 38% between 2008 and 2025, rising to more than 316 Mt in 2025 at a mean growth rate of 1.9% per year. Owen et al. (2010) estimated the future global aviation emissions under four of the IPCC/SRES (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change/Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) marker scenarios and reported a fuel use of 336 Tg in 2020 and varying from 426 to 766 Tg for 2050. This study also reported an estimate of 325 Tg for 2050 if the ambitious technology targets of the Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe (ACARE, 2002) were to be achieved. summarises the yearly global fuel consumption reported in recent studies. However, aviation traffic growth and jet fuel demand have been shown not to be strictly correlated, since the efficiencies of aircraft engines and air traffic management are improving and modern airliners are 75% quieter with consequent fuel consumption reduced by 70% with respect to the 1960s (Baughcum et al., 1999, Nygren et al., 2009, and references therein). In particular, the current average fuel consumption of in-use fleets was estimated to be less than 5 L fuel every 100 RPK, while in most modern aircraft it drops to approximately 3.5 L/100 RPK: Nygren et al. (2009) reported the historical world fleet of aircraft average fuel consumption and found an exponential trend in fuel consumption reduction from 1987 to the present day. Oil prices have driven investment in more efficient aircraft models. Fuel costs exceed those of labour costs for airlines. Fuel costs accounted for ∼13% of total costs in 2002, but today they are closer to 34% (Boeing, 2013).\n\nTable 2\n\nYearFleetaFuelH2OCO2NOxbCOHCSOxcSootReferenceTgMgGlobal1999Scheduled air traffic which includes turboprops, passenger jets, and jet cargo aircraft128––1.70.6850.189––Sutkus et al.

Aircraft exhaust emissions\n\nEmissions from aircraft engines are generally considered to be the dominant source at airports and the large majority of studies available in the literature focus on aircraft emissions. Common airliners burning kerosene-type fuels primarily produce carbon dioxide and water (Wahner et al., 1995, Lewis et al., 1999, Anderson et al., 2006, Lee et al., 2010), which are directly related to the burned fuel, with minor variations due to the carbon–hydrogen ratio of the fuel. In this context, it is reported that the fuel flow of common airliner engines is approximately linearly proportional to engine thrust setting (e.g., Anderson et al., 2005, Wey et al., 2006).\n\nThe oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen at the very high temperatures in engine combustors drives the formation of nitrogen oxides, while the presence of trace amounts of sulphur, nitrogen and some metals (e.g., Fe, Cu, Zn) in fuels (Lewis et al., 1999) and non-ideal combustion conditions within engines may lead to the production of by-products, including sulphur oxides, additional nitrogen oxides, unburned hydrocarbons and particulate soot. Furthermore, exhausts can also contain species from the combustion and release of lubricant oils (Dakhel et al., 2007, Timko et al., 2010b, Yu et al., 2010, Kinsey et al., 2011, Yu et al., 2012) and from mechanical component wear (Petzold et al., 1998, Demirdjian et al., 2007). Therefore a more realistic, but simplified, combustion scheme in aircraft engines can be summarised as (Lee et al., 2009):\n\nCnHm + N2 + O2 + S → CO2 + N2 + H2O + O2 + CO + SOx + NOx + HC + soot\n\nIPCC reported that approximately 99.5–99.9% of the molar content of typical commercial engine exhaust consists of N2, O2, CO2, and H2O (Lewis et al., 1999). reports a more detailed breakdown of combustion products for a core engine mass flow: the combustion products in aircraft exhausts are mainly made up of CO2 (∼72%), H2O (∼27.6%), while residual products account for less than 1%. summarises the main exhaust components of aircraft engines and their potential effects on the environment and human health. It is estimated that roughly 90% of aircraft emissions, except hydrocarbons and CO (∼70%), are produced while cruising at altitude, while the remainder is emitted during landing, take-off, and ground level operations (e.g., FAA, 2005).\n\nAircraft emissions have been studied extensively since the late-1960s and initially the interest was mainly driven by their direct and indirect effects on climate and the generation of contrails. For this reason, many early studies focused on emissions at high cruise altitudes (e.g., Reinking, 1968, Kuhn, 1970, Arnold et al., 1992, Fahey et al., 1995a, Fahey et al., 1995b, Wahner et al., 1995, Brasseur et al., 1996, Schumann, 1996, Schumann, 1997, Anderson et al., 1998a, Anderson et al., 1998b). The interest in aviation emissions at airports also dates back many years (e.g., Daley and Naugle, 1979, Naugle and Fox, 1981), but only recently was there an increasing awareness of the effects of aircraft emissions at ground level, or at least within the planetary boundary layer. The recent interest in aircraft emissions at ground-level was initially motivated by public concern, given that more and more often airports are held responsible for air pollution and noise in nearby residential areas (e.g., Mahashabde et al., 2011). Since aircraft emissions are related to engine thrust (e.g., Anderson et al., 2006, Lobo et al., 2007, Whitefield et al., 2008, Timko et al., 2010b, Kinsey et al., 2010, Kinsey et al., 2011) and engines are designed for high performance while cruising at high altitudes, some aircraft operations within airports require that engines operate outside of their optimal regimes, ranging from maximum thrust during take-off to low power settings during operations on the ground. This fact was clearly highlighted during the APEX-1 campaign by Onasch et al. (2009), who reported that a CFM56 engine is less efficient at the low thrust levels usually used at airports. This may result in potentially higher emissions on the ground than that during cruising for those pollutants mainly emitted at low power, such as CO and hydrocarbons.\n\nEarly reports of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and particulate matter from jet aircraft turbine engines were made by Spicer et al. (1984). Subsequent studies (Spicer et al., 1992, Spicer et al., 1994) added further information and provided detailed information on the organic component of turbine engine emissions. Following from these pioneering studies, the scientific literature now comprises a large number of studies and most have concluded that aircraft exhausts are responsible for significant emissions of a series of gaseous, semi-volatile and non-volatile species. Non-volatile emissions are produced in the combustor and are made up of refractory material such as soot (e.g., Agrawal et al., 2008, Kinsey, 2009, Dodson et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2010, Presto et al., 2011), which is emitted into the atmosphere as particulate matter even at the high engine exit temperatures, but also contains many organic compounds (e.g., Herndon et al., 2006, Anderson et al., 2006, Webb et al., 2008, Wood et al., 2008a, Agrawal et al., 2008, Herndon et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2010, Mazaheri et al., 2011, Presto et al., 2011, Kinsey et al., 2011, Mazaheri et al., 2013).\n\nVolatile emissions include compounds that exists as vapour at engine exit temperature and pressure (Presto et al., 2011) and are made up of gaseous and vapour-phase pollutants, such as CO2, CO, NOx, SO2, O3 and many organic compounds, including alkanes, alkenes, carbonyls, aromatic compounds and a number of other volatile organic species. The least volatile fraction has been shown to range from 10 to 20% of the total organic emissions (Presto et al., 2011) and its presence is particularly challenging, because it can react in the atmosphere and may undergo condensation in the exhaust plumes leading to aerosol particles or volatile coating of pre-existing particles (Lee et al., 2010, Miracolo et al., 2011). This latter component is named volatile PM, however there is today a considerable controversy about its definition (Kinsey, 2009). Such particles may act as condensation nuclei or may interact with soot to form condensation nuclei and thus may have effects on cloud formation, precipitation and climate. In addition, additional compounds may subsequently originate from the aging of exhausts following a chain of oxidation with atmospheric oxidants and gases.\n\nThe relative amount of exhaust emissions depends upon combustor temperature and pressure, fuel to air ratio and the extent to which fuel is atomised and mixed with inlet air (Anderson et al., 2006). It is well recognised that the amounts of many pollutants may vary considerably with the engine technology, model and especially with the thrust. For example Slemr et al., 1998, Slemr et al., 2001 and Spicer et al., 1992, Spicer et al., 1994 reported that hydrocarbon emissions can be dependent upon engine type, use and maintenance history as well as fuel composition.\n\n4.1. Geographical and vertical distributions of flights\n\nBased upon the main air traffic routes, a series of studies have discussed the geographical and vertical distributions of fuel consumption, which can be used to further assess the relative emissions from aviation (e.g., Kim et al., 2007, Wilkerson et al., 2010, Olsen et al., 2013, Simone et al., 2013). Due to the geographical distribution of civil aviation in the 2000s, the global fuel burn by domestic flights is dominated by the North America and Caribbean regions, while fuel consumed by international flights is dominated by Asia, North America and the Caribbean, and Western Europe and North Atlantic (Kim et al., 2007). Using the Aviation Emissions Inventory Code (AEIC, Stettler et al., 2011) Simone et al. (2013) estimated the fuel burn by country of origin/destination in 2005 and reported that the USA was the most important (59.1 Tg), followed by Japan (9.7 Tg), UK (9.4 Tg), China (8.5 Tg, excluding Hong Kong), Germany (6.7 Tg) and France (5.4 Tg). A map showing the column sum of global fuel burn from scheduled civil aviation in 2005 is provided in a. Other studies have been carried out to estimate annual fuel consumption and pollutant emissions more locally: for example Fan et al. (2012) assessed the fuel consumption and emissions for each airline in China in 2010.\n\nKim et al. (2007) and Lee et al. (2007) used the System for assessing Aviation's Global Emissions (SAGE) model to estimate the vertical profiles of commercial aviation and pointed out that the highest fuel burn and emissions are between 9 and 12 km, which corresponds to typical cruise altitude. Generally, most studies also reported that about 5–7% of total jet fuel is consumed within 1 km above ground level during airport operations (Kim et al., 2007, Simone et al., 2013), and Olsen et al. (2013) reported a comparison of the annual global vertical distribution of fuel burn by the commercial aviation deriving from different estimates ( b). Although most studies have concluded that 5–10% of fuel is burned below 1000 m, aircraft operations within airports may further increase fuel consumption due to the acceleration and deceleration of the engines following airport congestion (Anderson et al., 2005, Nikoleris et al., 2011) or due the unaccounted use of fuel for APUs (Ratliff et al., 2009).\n\n4.2. Emissions at ground\n\n4.2.1. Landing and take-off (LTO) cycles\n\nThe emissions of all aircraft engine must comply with applicable standards promulgated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO, 2008) and measured upon the landing and take-off (LTO) cycles. A LTO cycle refers to all the operations the aircraft carry out below 3000 ft above field elevation (equivalent to 914 m) over a specific range of certifiable operating conditions and includes four stages in terms of both engine thrust settings (expressed as a percentage of maximum rated thrust, or F00) and typical time in each specific mode of operation (time-in-mode, TIM). The 3000 ft height roughly corresponds to the atmospheric mixing height, i.e. the lower part of the troposphere within which pollutants emitted at ground-level mix rapidly (e.g., Schäfer et al., 2006). The LTO cycles are designed for aircraft engines manufactured after 1985 whose rated output is greater than 26.7 kN and aim to guarantee they not exceed certain regulatory environmental limits for a series of pollutants, namely unburned total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and smoke number (SN). This latter parameter is roughly representative of the amount of soot an engine generates (e.g., Wayson et al., 2009, Stettler et al., 2013a, Stettler et al., 2013b). In the first LTO phase the aircraft descends from cruising altitude toward the runway and lands at the airport. This phase is named “approach” and is estimated as lasting for 4 min with engines at 30% F00. After landing, the aircraft enters in the “idle” phase which includes all the ground-based operations: it proceeds at a low speed to the gate (taxi-in), remains on stand-by for the loading and unloading operations and again prepares for take-off proceeding towards the runway (taxi-out). Idle lasts 26 min and the engines are required to be at 7% F00. The subsequent operating modes include the “take-off” with engines stressed to the full thrust (100% F00) for 0.7 min, and the “climb” (85% F00 for 2.2 min) up to 3000 ft height. A standardised LTO cycle is shown in .\n\n4.2.2. Engine ground running procedures\n\nIn addition to the operations falling within LTO cycles, the ground running procedures (GRPs) may lead to further emission loads from aircraft engines at airports. GRPs refer to the operation of some or all engines carried out on the ground for the purpose of functionally checking the operation of either engines or aircraft systems. GRPs are therefore an essential part of the operation of any airliner prior to the release to service of an aircraft from maintenance. The main reasons for running the engines on the ground are (Buttress and Morris, 2005): (i) check starts after minor maintenance actions; (ii) runs at no more than ground idle to ensure that the engine operates correctly after maintenance action, these include thrust reverser function checks, etc.; (iii) runs at powers greater than ground idle to check the correct operation of certain valves, leak checks, etc. To date, only few studies take into account the emissions from GRPs, but their importance for the atmospheric loads of some pollutants cannot be neglected. For example, Buttress and Morris (2005) showed that GRPs at London Heathrow airport release approximately 15.6 Mg y−1 NOx. Mazaheri et al. (2011) investigated the annual emissions of particle number, particle mass and NOx throughout the LTO cycles and GRP at the Brisbane Airport and showed that annual emissions account for less than 3%. Despite the evidence that GRPs may have a substantial impact on local air quality at airports, up to now they have received only minor consideration. GRPs are not yet regulated internationally and must comply only with local regulatory requirements imposing limitations on the locations, times and engine thrust levels employed during ground running which may differ from one airport to another.\n\n4.2.3. Limitations in the use of standard LTO cycles\n\nThe use of standard LTO cycles as a surrogate for typical aircraft operations close to the ground represents an approximation and is not always representative of operations at airports. One limitation is that the ICAO engine emissions standards are applied through national and multi-national certification processes to turbojet and turbofan engines, but not turboprop, turboshaft and piston engines (ICAO, 2011). This limitation may be negligible at large airports, where most traffic is due to common airliners equipped with TF engines, but may represent a major approximation for small and medium-sized airports where small, private, business and regional aircraft account for a large portion of flight traffic. In addition, despite LTO cycles having been designed to model optimally all the operational procedures of aircraft in the vicinity of airports, sometimes they are not well adapted to engine settings and actual TIM, which depend upon pilot' technique, fleets, airport layouts and flight traffic. In fact, default ICAO TIM are not representative of real operations and are for certification purposes. Consequently, although some inventories account for the deviations from the ICAO default TIMs and thrust settings, some deviations from the standardised LTO procedures may occur during actual LTO cycles. This inevitably leads to some differences between actual airport operations and emission inventories used in modelling studies. The main deviations/limitations are:\n\n•\n\nreduced thrust during take-off. This practice is often carried out for performance and cost-efficiency reasons (ICAO, 2011) and has been widely observed on operational runways (Carslaw et al., 2008, Herndon et al., 2008); it may depend on aircraft weight and weather factors (Morris, 2002) and is often largely unknown (Carslaw et al., 2008). Since the emissions of some pollutants increase monotonically with the thrust (e.g., NOx), this could lead to an overestimation of emissions from airports;\n\n•\n\nlower thrust at idle/taxi mode. It has been reported that most aircraft use a thrust of 3%–4% F00 instead of 7% (Morris, 2005a, Morris, 2005b, Nikoleris et al., 2011 and reference therein) during idle operations. Since most pollutants emitted in exhaust plumes are strongly increased at decreased power settings (CO and generally all hydrocarbons), this may lead to underestimation of emissions at airports. In this context, Wood et al. (2008b) suggested that the thrust used in taxi operations can be split in two modes, i.e. ‘ground idle’ carried out at 4% F00 and ‘taxiway acceleration’ with thrust settings up to 17%. Moreover, higher thrust levels are sometimes used for turning;\n\n•\n\nacceleration and deceleration of the engines or stop-and-go situations. This is mainly the result of congestion on taxiways and is known to be responsible for significant increases in fuel consumption and increased emissions (Anderson et al., 2005, Nikoleris et al., 2011). For example Morris (2005a) reported that instant accelerations up to 10% F00 and lasting ∼10 s may occur at London Heathrow airport when aircraft cross an active runway or make a sharp turn. Due to this, the entire taxiway phase of operation using a uniform engine thrust level have been also recognised as problematic for emission inventory estimates because of the nonlinear emission rate of many compounds at low power (Herndon et al., 2009);\n\n•\n\nuse of a reverse thrust phase during landing. Reverse thrust is applied to assist mechanical brakes in slowing down the landing aircraft and is not generally required for normal operations onto a dry runway (ICAO, 2011). However, it generally occurs with idle thrust power as a prudent safety precaution, and under some circumstances it may also occur at power higher than 10% F00 (Morris and Easey, 2005, Stettler et al., 2011). Generally, reverse thrust is applied for 10–20 s (Fanning et al., 2007, Stettler et al., 2011), but may vary as a function of the landing velocity, runway length and aircraft weight;\n\n•\n\nthe evident differences between the standard TIM, which is used as part of the ICAO engine emissions certification processes, and the actual TIM used at airports (e.g., Unique, 2004, Watterson et al., 2004, Patterson et al., 2009, Stettler et al., 2011, Mazaheri et al., 2011, Khadilkar and Balakrishnan, 2012). For example, Patterson et al. (2009) and Khadilkar and Balakrishnan (2012) observed that total fuel burn during departures and arrivals at airports is generally overestimated by the ICAO method with respect to emissions computed from real-time aircraft flight data. Other studies have also reported measured TIM at airports: Unique (2004) reported TIM in Zurich airport and detected differences in all the LTO phases: idle (−43%), approach (+10%), climb (−77%) and take-off (+129%) which have been estimated to have a strong impact on the calculation of emissions, resulting in reduced fuel flow (−38%) and NOx emissions (−31%);\n\n•\n\nthe composition of the fleet that serves an airport and the weight of the aircraft. Since the ICAO certifies the engines and not the full aircraft, some airplane characteristics, mainly the aircraft weight, may have a key role in determining the emissions. Furthermore, in addition to the mass of the aircraft, its load of fuel, passengers and goods affect the overall weight: it is reported that passengers, crew and luggage usually add 6–15% to aircraft weight (Hu et al., 2009). Most of those factors vary from flight to flight, are largely unknown and may have direct implications for reduced thrust during take-off. In fact, it should be inferred that the increase of the aircraft weight has direct effects upon the thrust levels needed for carrying out usual LTO operations. For example, Carslaw et al. (2008) studied the NOx emissions at London Heathrow and found evidence for statistically significant differences in the emissions from the same engine type used on the same aircraft frame. Among other factors, they speculated that the aircraft weight could be a cause. In a study conducted in eight major busy airports, Turgut and Rosen (2010) detected significant differences in the emissions of some pollutants and concluded that every airport has LTO cycles carried out by aircraft with different characteristics and, consequently, emissions. Another recent study by Turgut et al. (2013) showed a good relationship between aircraft mass and the NOx emission during take-off and climb, which supports the concept of an explicit relationship between the aircraft weight and emissions. There is a general lack of knowledge about the relationships between aircraft mass and emissions, although some recent studies have indicated that heavier aircraft also emit more particles (Zhu et al., 2011).\n\nRecent studies assessing airport emissions have proposed and used LTO cycles which are much more complex than those standardised by the ICAO. For example, in a study of the air quality and public health impacts of UK airports, Stettler et al. (2011) used specific TIMs derived from Watterson et al. (2004) and Underwood et al. (2004) composed of 12 phases, namely approach, landing roll, reverse thrust, taxi-in, taxiway acceleration, APU, taxi-out, taxiway acceleration, hold, take-off, initial climb and climb-out. Proposed TIMs were developed by analysing the common procedures of an A320 aircraft at London Heathrow, but may vary by aircraft size category. Other studies (e.g., Ratliff et al., 2009), used models, such as the Emissions and Dispersion Modelling System (EDMS), which also requires jet fuel quality data, main engine and APU specifications, aircraft weight and ground operating time to generate more reliable emission estimates.\n\n4.2.4. The emission indices (EIs)\n\nThe emissions during standardised LTO cycles are then reported as emission indices (EIs) expressed as mass of pollutant emitted per unit mass of fuel burned. Fuel-based emission indices for the compound X are calculated according to:\n\nEI(X)=Fc·(MX/MCO2)·(ΔX/ΔCO2)\n\nwhere Fc represents the stoichiometric calculation of CO2 produced per kilogram of fuel consumed (with units g CO2 kg Fuel−1) assuming complete combustion and given a particular hydrogen to carbon ratio (e.g., Herndon et al., 2004). Mx and MCO2 are the molecular weights of the compound X and CO2, respectively, and ΔX and ΔCO2 are the enhancements of compound X and CO2 within the plume, respectively (e.g., Anderson et al., 2006). Unless specified differently, by convention EI(NOx) is defined in terms of NO2 and therefore the mass of NOx emissions is:\n\nNOxasNO2=NO2emissions+NOemissions·M(NO2)/M(NO)\n\nwhere M(NO2) and M(NO) are the molecular weights of NO2 and NO, respectively. In a similar way it should be specified that EI(hydrocarbons) is often referenced to methane (Wahner et al., 1995). ICAO maintains a databank of engine certification data for commercial aviation reporting EIs for the four selected pollutants (EASA, 2013). Emissions of a pollutant X from an engine can be therefore calculated using three parameters: the first two are provided by the ICAO databank and are the main engine EI(X) and the engine fuel flow, i.e., the burned fuel at a defined power setting (expressed as kg s−1); the third parameter is the time-in-mode (TIM), i.e. the time the engines spend at an identified power setting (ICAO, 2011):\n\nEmission(X)=EI(X)·TIM·fuelflow\n\nAnalogous to the EI for the emitted pollutant, emission indices for the number of particles have been commonly reported in the literature. For convention, they are here reported as EI(#).\n\nUsing ICAO EIs and standardised LTO TIMs, , , report a reprocessing of the data included in the ICAO databank. In particular, shows the total burned fuel and the mass of emitted pollutants (CO, NOx and hydrocarbons) during a complete LTO cycle, i.e. the sum of standardised time in each mode per fuel flow per average EI at each of the four power settings (ICAO, 2013); data are organised to show the changes in the ICAO emission data for in-use engines certified from 1973 to present (five year steps). Since different engines have different characteristics, including the thrust force, also shows the ratios between the fuel burned during complete LTO cycles and the engine maximum rated thrust (in kN) to normalise the fuel consumption of the engine power. summarises the ICAO EI data (all in-use engines certified from 1976 to today) per each LTO stage, expressed as g pollutant emitted per kg fuel burned. shows the total burned fuel and emissions per each LTO phase, i.e. the product of EIs per standardised time in each phase per fuel flow. The reprocessing of ICAO data does not take into account the number of units produced for each engine model, but only the different models produced and still in service in April 2013 (and included in the ICAO databank), regardless of manufacturer, type and technology. Moreover, data refer to single engines, and generally conventional aircraft are equipped with 1–4 engines. Therefore the sole purpose of the reprocessing of ICAO data is to report qualitatively the trends in fuel consumption and emissions for in-use TF engines.\n\nCurrently, the scientific literature includes several studies aiming to give EIs for comparison with reported ICAO databank certification data and for many other components, including particulate matter, elements, ions and speciated hydrocarbons. However, such data are often sparse and results poorly comparable. Most studies were carried out using single or a few engine types, under certain environmental conditions, without a standardised thrust and/or often using different measurement techniques and instrumental set-up. lists the most recent studies available in the literature reporting EIs for various engines in aircraft and helicopters. The table also shows some information (if available) about tested aircraft, engine models, selected thrust, type of fuel, sampling methodologies and analytical techniques. provides a list of recent studies which measured EIs during real aircraft operations at airports. Most of the data in such studies (both engine tests and real world operations) are summarised in the Supplemental Information Tables SI1, SI2, SI3 and SI4, which provide detailed information about the EIs for many gaseous pollutants, speciated hydrocarbons, particle number, particle mass (including soot) and species/ions in particulate matter, respectively. Note that specific thrust levels provided in the tables are derived from the literature and are categorised in five groups, named idle, approach, cruise, climb and take-off, on the basis of the engine type. The thrust, expressed as F00, is always provided along with the EIs. Additional tested thrust levels (if available) are also reported, along with fuel and analytical methodologies.\n\nTable 3\n\nAirframe/EngineAnalysed compoundsSampling and experimental (Sampling system [analytical methods])Tested regimes and [fuels]ReferencesF101 (Military TF with reheat used on the B-1B aircraft); F110 (Military TF with reheat used on the F-16C and F-16D aircraft)CO2, CO, NOx, total hydrocarbons, individual organic speciesSamples collected from each engine using a probe positioned just behind the exhaust nozzleFour power settings from idle to intermediate powerSpicer et al.

Considerations about the EIs\n\nAs indicated by the large number of studies in , , most of the literature provides results through the calculation of EIs. When applied to the specific testing studies on engines or airplanes, such methodology has the advantage of giving data easily comparable with EIs reported in the ICAO databank. This may allow a better evaluation of the differences amongst tested engines and technologies or, in case of the use of innovative analytical devices, allows a check the agreement between data obtained and certified values. In contrast, expressing the results as EIs from studies conducted during real-world operations at airports has both advantages and limitations. An advantage of the specific studies may be comparison of the results with the ICAO data to detect changes due to evolution of the exhaust plume, e.g. aging and gas-to-particle partitioning. Carslaw et al. (2008) noticed that EIs do not give a clear indication of the absolute contribution of aircraft emissions to ground-level concentrations, which is important for assessing air quality at airports. Furthermore, they commented that the value of EIs may be substantially affected by limited knowledge of some important aircraft operational factors, such as the aircraft weight and thrust setting at take-off. A list of remaining studies conducted at airports and in their surroundings, which do not report data expressed as EIs, is provided in . In summary, , , provide an overview of the most important studies reported in this review for the characterisation of aircraft emissions in both tests and real operations.\n\nTable 5\n\nTarget; period; airportAnalysed compoundsSampling; analyticalEngine thrusts (if know) or LTO phasesReferencesAir quality data in the vicinity of Hong Kong International Airport (1997–1998) and Los Angeles International Airport (2000–2001)CO, NOx, SO2, and respirable suspended particlesData from routine air quality monitoring site and special study–Yu et al.

Emissions at cruise altitudes\n\nAlthough injected at high altitudes, aircraft cruise emissions have been found to impact surface air quality through the mean meridional streamlines due to the polar, Ferrel, and Hadley cells (Barrett et al., 2010, Barrett et al., 2012) and they are not currently regulated. Consequently, although this review focuses on airport emissions, a brief statement upon the aircraft emissions during cruise (8–12 km) is presented, as the majority of exhaust from aircraft is emitted at high altitudes (e.g., Gardner et al., 1997, FAA, 2005, Wilkerson et al., 2010, Whitt et al., 2011). A more exhaustive summary of the effects of both civil (subsonic) aviation in the upper troposphere and supersonic aircraft in the stratosphere is reported in two reviews by Lee et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2010.\n\nImpacts of aviation during cruising first focused the interest of the scientific community in the late 1960s in relation to contrail generation at high altitudes and the relative effect on climate (Reinking, 1968, Kuhn, 1970). Contrails are formed whenever the requisite conditions of either ice or water supersaturation exist within aircraft exhaust plumes (DeWitt and Hwang, 2005). Subsequently, in the early 1970s, concern grew over a possible role in stratospheric ozone depletion while interest in the impact of nitrogen oxide emissions on the formation of tropospheric ozone began in the late 1980s (Lee et al., 2009, and references therein). Subsequent studies (e.g., Wahner et al., 1995, Brasseur et al., 1996, Schumann, 1997) investigated a number of emissions other than CO2, and effects from aviation with potential effects on climate. To date there are a large number of studies characterising aircraft emissions during cruising (e.g., Fahey et al., 1995a, Fahey et al., 1995b, Busen and Schumann, 1995, Schumann et al., 1996, Schlager et al., 1997, Paladino et al., 1998, Anderson et al., 1998a, Curtius et al., 1998, Brock et al., 2000, Schröder et al., 2000, Schumann et al., 2000, Schumann et al., 2002, Curtius et al., 2002, Jurkat et al., 2011).\n\nThe RF of civil aviation emissions has been extensively studied (e.g., Prather et al., 1999, Wuebbles et al., 2007, Lee et al., 2009) and can be summarised in the following emitted compounds and processes, each having positive (+) or negative (−) forcing: H2O (+); CO2 (+); the atmospheric chemistry of NOx causes the formation of tropospheric O3 (+) but also the destruction of methane (−); oxidation of SO2 results in sulphate particles (−); contrails (+); aviation-induced cloudiness (potentially +); soot, mainly composed of black carbon (+). Lee et al. (2009) estimated that aviation-induced RF in 2005 was ∼55 mW m−2, which accounted for 3.5% of global anthropogenic RF. In addition, black carbon emissions generated by aircraft at altitude have been shown to have a role in the formation of contrails (Schumann, 1996) and contrail-induced cirrus clouds, which affect the Earth's radiation balance by reflecting incoming solar radiation and by absorbing and re-emitting long wave radiation. The result is an additional positive RF of a magnitude similar to that of CO2 (IPCC, 1999, Sausen et al., 2005, Lee et al., 2010). Recently, Azar and Johansson (2012) also assessed the non-CO2 climate impact of aviation, including NOx and contrails, and calculated the emissions weighting factors, i.e. the factor by which aviation CO2 emissions should be multiplied to get the CO2-equivalent emissions for annual fleet average conditions. Recently, Gettelman and Chen (2013) reported the climate impact of aviation aerosol. Although such studies highlighted the climate impact of aviation, it should be borne in mind that the magnitude of the total emissions of pollutants from aviation in terms of mass with direct and/or indirect effects on climate are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than from road transport or shipping (Balkanski et al., 2010, Eyring et al., 2010). The study of aircraft emissions at cruise altitudes is very challenging mainly due to the obvious difficulty of sampling. Thus, measurements are commonly performed indirectly or extrapolated from data collected on the ground or in the laboratory. For this reason, the assessment of cruise emissions at altitude offers unique challenges to understanding the impacts of atmospheric emissions and their processing (Herndon et al., 2008, and reference therein). Computational models are available to extrapolate the test stand EI data to cruise altitude conditions (Baughcum et al., 1996b, Sutkus et al., 2001).\n\n4.4. Military aircraft emissions\n\nDespite most attention being given to civil aviation, a number of studies have also addressed emissions from military aircraft (e.g., Spicer et al., 1984, Spicer et al., 1992, Spicer et al., 1994, Heland and Schäfer, 1997, Heland and Schäfer, 1998, Gerstle et al., 1999, Gerstle et al., 2002, Miller et al., 2003, Anderson et al., 2005, Brundish et al., 2007, Corporan et al., 2008, Cheng, 2009, Cowen et al., 2009, Spicer et al., 2009, Cheng et al., 2009, Cheng and Corporan, 2010). Despite the relatively high potential impact of military aircraft emissions under particular circumstances, the task of studying military emissions is very difficult. Unlike civil aviation, military operations generally do not work to set flight profiles and do not follow fixed plans (Wahner et al., 1995). In addition, national and military authorities are reluctant to disclose sensitive information either about operations or in-use technologies. The lack of comprehensive data about military operations makes realistic assessments of the contribution of military aircraft in terms of fuel consumption extremely difficult. In addition, some aircraft may have a dual function, such as the C-130 Hercules, which can be engaged in both military and civilian operations. Henderson et al. (1999) reported a historical breakdown of aviation fuel burn for civil and military aviation: in 1976 fuel burned by civil aviation was 64%, while military was 36%. In 1992 the percentages were 82% and 18%, respectively. Subsequent studies stated that military aviation fleets used 11% (19.5 Tg) of fuel in 2002 and estimated that the military contribution is in the range of 10–13% of total aviation emissions (Eyers et al., 2004, Waitz et al., 2005). provides estimates of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions from military aviation by the AERO2k model (Eyers et al., 2004). Among the large number of military aircraft, Cheng and Corporan (2010) stated that the three classes of military engines T56, TF33, and T700/T701C fitted in the C130 Hercules, B-52 bomber and Apache/Blackhawk helicopters, respectively, consume 70%–80% of the USA military aviation fuel each year.\n\n4.5. Water vapour\n\nWater is a key product of all hydrocarbon combustion and aircraft engines release H2O as vapour (Lewis et al., 1999). Water vapour is a greenhouse gas and its increase in the stratosphere (Solomon et al., 2010) and the free troposphere (Sherwood et al., 2010) tend to warm the Earth's surface (Prather et al., 1999). Water vapour, via latent heat released or absorbed during condensation and evaporation cycles also play an active role in dynamic processes that shape the global circulation of the atmosphere (Schneider et al., 2010). Moreover its effect on the formation of contrails and on the enhanced cirrus generation in the upper troposphere can be relevant for additional global RF with an indirect consequent potential increase of positive effects on global warming (Lee et al., 2009). The annual and global-mean RF due to present-day aviation water vapour emissions has been found to be 0.9 (range 0.3–1.4) mW m−2 (Wilcox et al., 2012). The increased water vapour in the lower troposphere may have secondary effects on precipitation, fog, visibility and some microphysical processes.\n\nAn emission index of 1230 ± 20 g H2O kg Fuel−1 is commonly reported for completely burnt fuel (Lewis et al., 1999, Lee et al., 2010): this represents a little less than 30% of all combustion products in aircraft exhaust ( ). No differences in emission indices during idle, take-off and cruise power settings are reported (Lewis et al., 1999), as emissions of H2O are a simple function of fuel consumption. The AERO2k inventories (Eyers et al., 2004) estimate a global emission of 217 Tg H2O for 2002, 193 Tg from civil aviation and 24 Tg from military operations. Other more recent estimates report 251 Tg H2O in 2005"
