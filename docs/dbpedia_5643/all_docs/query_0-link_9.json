        "text": "Deciphering cGMP signatures and cGMP-dependent pathways in plant defence\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMeier, Stuart; Madeo, Laura; Ederli, Luisa; Donaldson, Lara; Gehring, Chris\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe second messenger, 3â²,5â²-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), is a critical component of many different processes in plants while guanylyl cyclases that catalyse the formation of cGMP from GTP have remained somewhat elusive in higher plants. Consequently, two major aims are the discovery of novel GCs and the identification of cGMP mediated processes. Recently, we have reported temporal signatures of ozone (O3)-induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) generation, their effect on cGMP generation, and consequent transcriptional changes of genes diagnostic for stress responses in tobacco. We demonstrated that O3 and NO induced early transcriptional activation of the scavenger encoding proteins, alternative oxidase (AOX1a), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and the induction of ethylene production through aminocyclopropancarboxylic acid synthase (ACS2) are cGMP-independent. By contrast, the early response of the phenylalanine ammonia lyase gene (PALa) and the late response of the gene encoding the pathogenesis-related protein (PR1a) show critical dependence on cGMP. Here we show differential cGMP responses to virulent and avirulent Pseudomonas syringae strains and propose that host-pathogen recognition and/or down-stream processes are transduced by complex cGMP signatures. This is in accordance with the identification of a growing number of multi-domain molecules in Arabidopsis that are reported to contain putative functional GC catalytic centers.

Recently, we described the bacterial second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) as a novel regulator of a subclass of chemotaxis receptors. In Azospirillum brasilense , c-di-GMP binds to a chemotaxis receptor, Tlp1, and modulates its signaling function during aerotaxis. Here, we further characterize the role of c-di-GMP in aerotaxis using a novel dichromatic optogenetic system engineered for manipulating intracellular c-di-GMP levels in real time. This system comprises a red/near-infrared-light-regulated diguanylate cyclase and a blue-light-regulated c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase. It allows the generation of transient changes in intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations within seconds of irradiation with appropriate light, which is compatible with the time scale of chemotaxis signaling. We provide experimental evidence that binding of c-di-GMP to the Tlp1 receptor activates its signaling function during aerotaxis, which supports the role of transient changes in c-di-GMP levels as a means of adjusting the response of A. brasilense to oxygen gradients. We also show that intracellular c-di-GMP levels in A. brasilense change with carbon metabolism. Our data support a model whereby c-di-GMP functions to imprint chemotaxis receptors with a record of recent metabolic experience, to adjust their contribution to the signaling output, thus allowing the cells to continually fine-tune chemotaxis sensory perception to their metabolic state.

In the dark-adapted photoreceptors, the activity of PDE6 is blocked via tight association with the inhibitory gamma-subunits (Pgamma). The Pgamma block is removed in the light-activated PDE6 by the visual G protein, transducin. Transducin-activated PDE6 exhibits an exceptionally high catalytic rate of cGMP hydrolysis ensuring high signal amplification. To identify the structural determinants for the inhibitory interaction with Pgamma and the remarkable cGMP hydrolytic ability, we sought to reproduce the PDE6 characteristics by mutagenesis of PDE5, a related cyclic GMP-specific, cGMP-binding PDE. PDE5 is insensitive to Pgamma and has a more than 100-fold lower k(cat) for cGMP hydrolysis. Our mutational analysis of chimeric PDE5/PDE6alpha' enzymes revealed that the inhibitory interaction of cone PDE6 catalytic subunits (PDE6alpha') with Pgamma is mediated primarily by three hydrophobic residues at the entry to the catalytic pocket, Met(758), Phe(777), and Phe(781). The maximal catalytic rate of PDE5 was enhanced by at least 10-fold with substitutions of PDE6alpha'-specific glycine residues for the corresponding PDE5 alanine residues, Ala(608) and Ala(612). The Gly residues are adjacent to the highly conserved metal binding motif His-Asn-X-X-His, which is essential for cGMP hydrolysis. Our results suggest that the unique Gly residues allow the PDE6 metal binding site to adopt a more favorable conformation for cGMP hydrolysis.\n\nPeriodic GMP Matrices\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEichinger, Benjamin\n\n2016-07-01\n\nWe recall criteria on the spectrum of Jacobi matrices such that the corresponding isospectral torus consists of periodic operators. Motivated by those known results for Jacobi matrices, we define a new class of operators called GMP matrices. They form a certain Generalization of matrices related to the strong Moment Problem. This class allows us to give a parametrization of almost periodic finite gap Jacobi matrices by periodic GMP matrices. Moreover, due to their structural similarity we can carry over numerous results from the direct and inverse spectral theory of periodic Jacobi matrices to the class of periodic GMP matrices. In particular, we prove an analogue of the remarkable ''magic formula'' for this new class.\n\nASEAN GMP and pharmaceutical industries in Indonesia.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoesilo, S; Sitorus, U\n\n1995-01-01\n\nIndonesia was appointed by the ASEAN Technical Cooperation in Pharmaceutical as a focal point and to coordinate the development of practical guidelines for the implementation of GMP. The ASEAN GMP Guidelines were endorsed by the ASEAN Technical Cooperation in Pharmaceutical in 1988, which among others required separation of Beta-Lactam dedicated facilities and three degrees of cleanliness for production areas. As it was realised that drug manufacturers in developing countries need more detailed guidelines to be able to implement the GMP, an Operational Manual for GMP was also prepared for providing examples of SOPs lay-outs, documentation etc. It was agreed by the technical cooperation group to leave the implementation of GMP to each member country. However, the ASEAN Manual for Inspection of GMP was drafted and endorsed by the group and training of ASEAN Drug Inspectors was organized to support the implementation. The ASEAN GMP is being implemented in Indonesia through a five-year, stepwise implementation plan, starting in 1989.\n\nDiversity of Cyclic Di-GMP-Binding Proteins and Mechanisms\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2015-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) synthetases and hydrolases (GGDEF, EAL, and HD-GYP domains) can be readily identified in bacterial genome sequences by using standard bioinformatic tools. In contrast, identification of c-di-GMP receptors remains a difficult task, and the current list of experimentally characterized c-di-GMP-binding proteins is likely incomplete. Several classes of c-di-GMP-binding proteins have been structurally characterized; for some others, the binding sites have been identified; and for several potential c-di-GMP receptors, the binding sites remain to be determined. We present here a comparative structural analysis of c-di-GMP-protein complexes that aims to discern the common themes in the binding mechanisms that allow c-di-GMP receptors to bind it with (sub)micromolar affinities despite the 1,000-fold excess of GTP. The available structures show that most receptors use their Arg and Asp/Glu residues to bind c-di-GMP monomers, dimers, or tetramers with stacked guanine bases. The only exception is the EAL domains that bind c-di-GMP monomers in an extended conformation. We show that in c-di-GMP-binding signature motifs, Arg residues bind to the O-6 and N-7 atoms at the Hoogsteen edge of the guanine base, while Asp/Glu residues bind the N-1 and N-2 atoms at its Watson-Crick edge. In addition, Arg residues participate in stacking interactions with the guanine bases of c-di-GMP and the aromatic rings of Tyr and Phe residues. This may account for the presence of Arg residues in the active sites of every receptor protein that binds stacked c-di-GMP. We also discuss the implications of these structural data for the improved understanding of the c-di-GMP signaling mechanisms.

Hydrolytic activity of the C-terminal catalytic domain is increased by cGMP binding to the N-terminal GAF A domain. We present the NMR solution structure of the cGMP-bound PDE5A GAF A domain. The cGMP orientation in the buried binding pocket was defined through 37 intermolecular NOEs.\n\nCrystal Structure of PKG I:cGMP Complex Reveals a cGMP-Mediated Dimeric Interface that Facilitates cGMP-Induced Activation.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Jeong Joo; Lorenz, Robin; Arold, Stefan T; Reger, Albert S; Sankaran, Banumathi; Casteel, Darren E; Herberg, Friedrich W; Kim, Choel\n\n2016-05-03\n\nCyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is a key regulator of smooth muscle and vascular tone and represents an important drug target for treating hypertensive diseases and erectile dysfunction.

To investigate the mechanism of high selectivity in cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), we determined a room-temperature joint X-ray/neutron (XN) structure of PKG IÎ² CNB-B, a domain 200-fold selective for cGMP over cAMP, bound to cGMP (2.2 Ã ), and a low-temperature X-ray structure of CNB-B with cAMP (1.3 Ã ). Finally, the XN structure directly describes the hydrogen bonding interactions that modulate high selectivity for cGMP, while the structure with cAMP reveals that all these contacts are disrupted,moreÂ Â» explaining its low affinity for cAMP.Â«Â less\n\nEnzymatic Production of c-di-GMP Using a Thermophilic Diguanylate Cyclase.\n\nPubMed\n\nVenkataramani, Prabhadevi; Liang, Zhao-Xun\n\n2017-01-01\n\nC-di-GMP has emerged as a prevalent bacterial messenger that controls a multitude of bacterial behaviors. Having access to milligram or gram quantities of c-di-GMP is essential for the biochemical and structural characterization of enzymes and effectors involved in c-di-GMP signaling. Although c-di-GMP can be synthesized using chemical methods, diguanylate cyclases (DGC)-based enzymatic synthesis is the most efficient method of preparing c-di-GMP today. Many DGCs are not suitable for c-di-GMP production because of poor protein stability and the presence of a c-di-GMP-binding inhibitory site (I-site) in most DGCs. We have identified and engineered a thermophilic DGC for efficient production of c-di-GMP for characterizing c-di-GMP signaling proteins and riboswitches. Importantly, residue replacement in the inhibitory I-site of the thermophilic DGC drastically relieved product inhibition to enable the production of hundreds of milligrams of c-di-GMP using 5-10Â mg of this robust biocatalyst.\n\nCyclic Di-GMP modulates the disease progression of Erwinia amylovora.\n\nPubMed\n\nEdmunds, Adam C; Castiblanco, Luisa F; Sundin, George W; Waters, Christopher M\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a nearly ubiquitous intracellular signal molecule known to regulate various cellular processes, including biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. The intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP is inversely governed by diguanylate cyclase (DGC) enzymes and phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, which synthesize and degrade c-di-GMP, respectively. The role of c-di-GMP in the plant pathogen and causal agent of fire blight disease Erwinia amylovora has not been studied previously. Here we demonstrate that three of the five predicted DGC genes in E. amylovora (edc genes, for Erwinia diguanylate cyclase), edcA, edcC, and edcE, are active diguanylate cyclases. We show that c-di-GMP positively regulates the secretion of the main exopolysaccharide in E. amylovora, amylovoran, leading to increased biofilm formation, and negatively regulates flagellar swimming motility. Although amylovoran secretion and biofilm formation are important for the colonization of plant xylem tissues and the development of systemic infections, deletion of the two biofilm-promoting DGCs increased tissue necrosis in an immature-pear infection assay and an apple shoot infection model, suggesting that c-di-GMP negatively regulates virulence. In addition, c-di-GMP inhibited the expression of hrpA, a gene encoding the major structural component of the type III secretion pilus. Our results are the first to describe a role for c-di-GMP in E. amylovora and suggest that downregulation of motility and type III secretion by c-di-GMP during infection plays a key role in the coordination of pathogenesis.\n\nCyclic Di-GMP Modulates the Disease Progression of Erwinia amylovora\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEdmunds, Adam C.; Castiblanco, Luisa F.; Sundin, George W.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a nearly ubiquitous intracellular signal molecule known to regulate various cellular processes, including biofilm formation, motility, and virulence.

We found a massive accumulation of cGMP in CNGA3-deficient retina and investigated whether cGMP accumulation plays a role in cone degeneration in CNG channel deficiency. The time course study showed that the retinal cGMP level in Cnga3(-/-);Nrl(-/-) mice with CNGA3 deficiency on a cone-dominant background was sharply increased at postnatal day 8 (P8), peaked around P10-P15, remained high through P30-P60, and returned to near control level at P90. This elevation pattern correlated with photoreceptor apoptotic death, which peaked around P15-P20. In Cnga3(-/-);Gucy2e(-/-) mice lacking retGC1, cone density and expression levels of cone-specific proteins were significantly increased compared with Cnga3(-/-), consistent with a role of cGMP accumulation as the major contributor to cone death caused by CNG channel deficiency. The activity and expression levels of cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) were significantly increased in Cnga3(-/-);Nrl(-/-) retina compared with Nrl(-/-), suggesting an involvement of PKG regulation in cell death. Our results indicate that cGMP accumulation in photoreceptors can itself exert cytotoxic effect in cones, independently of CNG channel activity and Ca(2+) influx.\n\nModulation of cGMP in Heart Failure\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBoerrigter, Guido; Lapp, Harald; Burnett, John C.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nHeart failure (HF) is a common disease that continues to be associated with high morbidity and mortality warranting novel therapeutic strategies. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is the second messenger of several important signaling pathways based on distinct guanylate cyclases (GCs) in the cardiovascular system. Both the nitric oxide/soluble GC (NO/sGC) as well as the natriuretic peptide/GC-A (NP/GC-A) systems are disordered in HF, providing a rationale for their therapeutic augmentation. Soluble GC activation with conventional nitrovasodilators has been used for more than a century but is associated with cGMP-independent actions and the development of tolerance, actions which novel NO-independent sGC activators now in clinical development lack. Activation of GC-A by administration of naturally occurring or designer natriuretic peptides is an emerging field, as is the inhibition of enzymes that degrade endogenous NPs. Finally, inhibition of cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterases, particularly phosphodiesterase 5 provides an additional strategy to augment cGMP-signaling.

Here we report the crystal structure, at 2.7 {angstrom} resolution, of a c-di-GMP riboswitch aptamer from Vibrio cholerae bound to c-di-GMP, showing that the ligand binds within a three-helix junction that involves base-pairing and extensive base-stacking. The symmetric c-di-GMP is recognized asymmetrically with respect to both the bases and the backbone. A mutant aptamer was engineered that preferentially binds the candidate signaling molecule c-di-AMP over c-di-GMP. Kinetic and structuralmoreÂ Â» data suggest that genetic regulation by the c-di-GMP riboswitch is kinetically controlled and that gene expression is modulated through the stabilization of a previously unidentified P1 helix, illustrating a direct mechanism for c-di-GMP signaling.Â«Â less\n\nEnhanced Vascular Effects of Cyclic GMP in Septic Rat Aorta\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1988-01-01\n\nenzyme in turn catalyzes Integrative Comp.

Recent studies indicated that cGMP is a secondary signal generated in response to auxin stimulation. cGMP also mediates auxin-induced adventitious root formation in mung bean and gravitropic bending in soybean. Nonetheless, the mechanism of the participation of cGMP in auxin signalling to affect these growth and developmental processes is largely unknown. In this report we provide evidence that indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) induces cGMP accumulation in Arabidopsis roots through modulation of the guanylate cyclase activity. Application of 8-bromo-cGMP (a cell-permeable cGMP derivative) increases auxin-dependent lateral root formation, root hair development, primary root growth, and gene expression. In contrast, inhibitors of endogenous cGMP synthesis block these processes induced by auxin. Data also showed that 8-bromo-cGMP enhances auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAA protein modulated by the SCF(TIR1) ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, it was found that 8-bromo-cGMP is unable to directly influence the auxin-dependent TIR1-Aux/IAA interaction as evidenced by pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays. In addition, we provide evidence for cGMP-mediated modulation of auxin signalling through cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Our results suggest that cGMP acts as a mediator to participate in auxin signalling and may govern this process by PKG activity via its inï¬uence on auxin-regulated gene expression and auxin/IAA degradation.\n\nAllosteric activation of exopolysaccharide synthesis through cyclic di-GMP-stimulated proteinâprotein interaction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSteiner, Samuel; Lori, Christian; Boehm, Alex; Jenal, Urs\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn many bacterial pathogens, the second messenger c-di-GMP stimulates the production of an exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix to shield bacteria from assaults of the immune system. How c-di-GMP induces EPS biogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we show that c-di-GMP allosterically activates the synthesis of poly-Î²-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine (poly-GlcNAc), a major extracellular matrix component of Escherichia coli biofilms. C-di-GMP binds directly to both PgaC and PgaD, the two inner membrane components of the poly-GlcNAc synthesis machinery to stimulate their glycosyltransferase activity. We demonstrate that the PgaCD machinery is a novel type c-di-GMP receptor, where ligand binding to two proteins stabilizes their interaction and promotes enzyme activity. This is the first example of a c-di-GMP-mediated process that relies on proteinâprotein interaction. At low c-di-GMP concentrations, PgaD fails to interact with PgaC and is rapidly degraded. Thus, when cells experience a c-di-GMP trough, PgaD turnover facilitates the irreversible inactivation of the Pga machinery, thereby temporarily uncoupling it from c-di-GMP signalling. These data uncover a mechanism of c-di-GMP-mediated EPS control and provide a frame for c-di-GMP signalling specificity in pathogenic bacteria.

Levels of the second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) are regulated by a variety of environmental stimuli and play a critical role in regulating cellular processes such as biofilm formation and cellular motility. Cyclic di-GMP signaling systems have been largely characterized in pathogenic bacteria; however, proteins that can impact the synthesis or degradation of c-di-GMP are prominent in cyanobacterial species and yet remain largely underexplored. In cyanobacteria, many putative c-di-GMP synthesis or degradation domains are found in genes that also harbor light-responsive signal input domains, suggesting that light is an important signal for altering c-di-GMP homeostasis. Indeed, c-di-GMP-associated domains are often the second most common output domain in photoreceptorsâoutnumbered only by a histidine kinase output domain. Cyanobacteria differ from other bacteria regarding the number and types of photoreceptor domains associated with c-di-GMP domains. Due to the widespread distribution of c-di-GMP domains in cyanobacteria, we investigated the evolutionary origin of a subset of genes. Phylogenetic analyses showed that c-di-GMP signaling systems were present early in cyanobacteria and c-di-GMP genes were both vertically and horizontally inherited during their evolution. Finally, we compared intracellular levels of c-di-GMP in two cyanobacterial species under different light qualities, confirming that light is an important factor for regulating this second messenger in vivo.

Studies in isolated perfused rat livers showed that infusion of 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-BrcGMP, 3 micromol/min or 100 microM) 1) increased bile flow without affecting biliary excretion of simultaneously infused taurocholate, 2) increased biliary concentration and excretion of HCO3(-) but did not affect biliary excretion of glutathione, and 3) increased net perfusate H+ efflux without affecting hepatic O2 uptake. Studies in isolated rat hepatocytes showed that 1) 8-BrcGMP increased intracellular pH in the presence (but not in the absence) of extracellular HCO-3, and effect inhibited by 4,4' -diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and Na+ replacement, 2) 8-BrcGMP did not affect taurocholate uptake and intracellular [Ca2+], and 3) bile acids, like ursodeoxycholate and cholate, did not increase cellular cGMP. Taken together, these results indicate that cGMP stimulates bile acid-independent bile formation, in part by stimulating biliary HCO3- excretion. cGMP may increase HCO3- excretion by stimulating sinusoidal Na+ - HCO3- cotransport, but not Na+/H+ exchange. cGMP, unlike adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, may not regulate hepatic taurocholate transport, and bile acid-induced HCO3- rich choleresis may not be mediated via cGMP.\n\nProlonged treatment of porcine pulmonary artery with nitric oxide decreases cGMP sensitivity and cGMP-dependent protein kinase specific activity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPerkins, William J.; Warner, David O.; Jones, Keith A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA cultured porcine pulmonary artery (PA) model was used to examine the effects of prolonged nitric oxide (NO) treatment on the response to acutely applied NO, cGMP analog, or atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Twenty-four-hour treatment with the NO donor (Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA-NO) resulted in >10-fold decrease in the response to acutely applied DETA-NO. In parallel with this, the relaxant response to acutely applied cGMP analog, Î²-phenyl-1,N2-etheno-8-bromoguanosine-3â²,5â²-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Sp isomer (Sp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS), and ANP decreased. The reduction in ANP responsiveness in PA was not associated with a reduction in cGMP levels evoked by 10â6 M ANP. Twenty-four hours in culture and treatment with DETA-NO decreased total cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGKI) mRNA level compared with that in freshly prepared PA (1.05 Â± 0.12, 0.42 Â± 0.08, and 0.11 Â± 0.01 amol/Î¼g, respectively). Total cGKI protein levels were decreased to a lesser extent by 24 h in culture and further decreased by 24-h DETA-NO treatment compared with that in freshly prepared PA (361 Â± 33, 272 Â± 20, and 238 Â± 25 ng/mg total protein, respectively). Maximal cGMP-stimulated phosphotransferase activity was reduced in 24-h cultured and DETA-NO-treated PA (986 Â± 84, 815 Â± 81, and 549 Â± 78 pmol PiÂ·minâ1Â·mg soluble proteinâ1), but the cGMP concentration resulting in 50% of maximal phosphotransferase activity was not. cGKI specific activity (maximal cGMP-activated phosphotransferase activity/ng cGKI) was significantly reduced in PA treated with DETA-NO for 24 h compared with freshly prepared and 24-h cultured PA (1.95 Â± 0.22, 2.64 Â± 0.25, and 2.85 Â± 0.28 pmol PiÂ·minâ1Â·ng cGKIâ1, respectively). We conclude that prolonged NO treatment induces decreased acute NO responsiveness in PA in part by decreasing cGMP sensitivity. It does so by decreasing both cGKI expression and cGKI specific activity.

From the relative obscurity of an allosteric activator of a bacterial cellulose synthase, c-di-GMP has emerged as one of the most common and important bacterial second messengers. Cyclic di-GMP has been shown to regulate biofilm formation, motility, virulence, the cell cycle, differentiation, and other processes. Most c-di-GMP-dependent signaling pathways control the ability of bacteria to interact with abiotic surfaces or with other bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Cyclic di-GMP plays key roles in lifestyle changes of many bacteria, including transition from the motile to the sessile state, which aids in the establishment of multicellular biofilm communities, and from the virulent state in acute infections to the less virulent but more resilient state characteristic of chronic infectious diseases. From a practical standpoint, modulating c-di-GMP signaling pathways in bacteria could represent a new way of controlling formation and dispersal of biofilms in medical and industrial settings. Cyclic di-GMP participates in interkingdom signaling. It is recognized by mammalian immune systems as a uniquely bacterial molecule and therefore is considered a promising vaccine adjuvant. The purpose of this review is not to overview the whole body of data in the burgeoning field of c-di-GMP-dependent signaling. Instead, we provide a historic perspective on the development of the field, emphasize common trends, and illustrate them with the best available examples. We also identify unresolved questions and highlight new directions in c-di-GMP research that will give us a deeper understanding of this truly universal bacterial second messenger.

Within preovulatory follicles, granulosa cells produce high levels of cGMP, which diffuses into the oocyte to maintain meiotic arrest. LH signaling restarts meiosis by rapidly lowering the levels of cGMP in the follicle and oocyte. Part of this decrease is mediated by the dephosphorylation and inactivation the NPR2 guanylyl cyclase in response to LH, but the mechanism for the remainder of the cGMP decrease is unknown. At least one cGMP phosphodiesterase, PDE5, is activated by LH signaling, which would contribute to lowering cGMP. PDE5 exhibits increased cGMP-hydrolytic activity when phosphorylated on serine 92, and we recently demonstrated that LH signaling phosphorylates PDE5 on this serine and increases its activity in rat follicles. To test the extent to which this mechanism contributes to the cGMP decrease that restarts meiosis, we generated a mouse line in which serine 92 was mutated to alanine (Pde5-S92A), such that it cannot be phosphorylated. Here we show that PDE5 phosphorylation is required for the LH-induced increase in cGMP-hydrolytic activity, but that this increase has only a modest effect on the LH-induced cGMP decrease in mouse follicles, and does not affect the timing of meiotic resumption. Though we show that the activation of PDE5 is among the mechanisms contributing to the cGMP decrease, these results suggest that another cGMP phosphodiesterase is also activated by LH signaling.

R.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nCyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is a unique bacterial intracellular signaling molecule capable of stimulating enhanced protective innate immunity against various bacterial infections. The effects of intranasal pretreatment with c-di-GMP, or intraperitoneal coadministration of c-di-GMP with the pneumolysin toxoid (PdB) or PspA before pneumococcal challenge, was investigated in mice. We found that c-di-GMP had no significant direct short-term effect on the growth rate of S. pneumoniae either in vitro or in vivo. However, intranasal pretreatment of mice with c-di-GMP resulted in significant decrease in bacterial load in lungs and blood after serotypes 2 and 3 challenge, and significant decrease in lung titers after serotype 4 challenge. Potential cellular mediators of these enhanced protective responses were identified in lungs and draining lymph nodes. Intraperitoneal coadministration of c-di-GMP with PdB or PspA before challenge resulted in significantly higher antigen-specific antibody titers and increased survival of mice, compared to that obtained with alum adjuvant. These findings demonstrate that local or systemic c-di-GMP administration stimulates innate and adaptive immunity against invasive pneumococcal disease. We propose that c-di-GMP can be used as an effective broad spectrum immunomodulator and vaccine adjuvant to prevent infectious diseases.

Understanding how bacteria integrate signals from various environmental factors and quorum sensing autoinducers to regulate the metabolism of various nucleotide second messengers c-di-GMP, c-di-AMP, cGMP, cAMP and ppGpp, which control several key processes required for adaptation is key for efforts to develop agents to curb bacterial infections. In this review, we provide an update of nucleotide signaling in bacteria and show how these signals intersect or integrate to regulate the bacterial phenotype. The intracellular concentrations of nucleotide second messengers in bacteria are regulated by synthases and phosphodiesterases and a significant number of these metabolism enzymes had been biochemically characterized but it is only in the last few years that the effector proteins and RNA riboswitches, which regulate bacterial physiology upon binding to nucleotides, have been identified and characterized by biochemical and structural methods. C-di-GMP, in particular, has attracted immense interest because it is found in many bacteria and regulate both biofilm formation and virulence factors production. In this review, we discuss how the activities of various c-di-GMP effector proteins and riboswitches are modulated upon c-di-GMP binding. Using V. cholerae, E. coli and B. subtilis as models, we discuss how both environmental factors and quorum sensing autoinducers regulate the metabolism and/or processing of nucleotide second messengers. The chemical syntheses of the various nucleotide second messengers and the use of analogs thereof as antibiofilm or immune modulators are also discussed.\n\nA calcium-permeable cGMP-activated cation conductance in hippocampal neurons\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLeinders-Zufall, T.; Rosenboom, H.; Barnstable, C. J.; Shepherd, G. M.; Zufall, F.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nWhole-cell patch clamp recordings detected a previously unidentified cGMP-activated membrane conductance in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. This conductance is nonselectively permeable for cations and is completely but reversibly blocked by external Cd2+. The Ca2+ permeability of the hippocampal cGMP-activated conductance was examined in detail, indicating that the underlying ion channels display a high relative permeability for Ca2+. The results indicate that hippocampal neurons contain a cGMP-activated membrane conductance that has some properties similar to the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels previously shown in sensory receptor cells and retinal neurons. In hippocampal neurons this conductance similarly could mediate membrane depolarization and Ca2+ fluxes in response to intracellular cGMP elevation.\n\nCyclic di-GMP-dependent Signaling Pathways in the Pathogenic Firmicute Listeria monocytogenes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Li-Hong; KÃ¶seoÄlu, Volkan K.; GÃ¼vener, Zehra T.; Myers-Morales, Tanya; Reed, Joseph M.; D'Orazio, Sarah E. F.; Miller, Kurt W.; Gomelsky, Mark\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe characterized key components and major targets of the c-di-GMP signaling pathways in the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, identified a new c-di-GMP-inducible exopolysaccharide responsible for motility inhibition, cell aggregation, and enhanced tolerance to disinfectants and desiccation, and provided first insights into the role of c-di-GMP signaling in listerial virulence. Genome-wide genetic and biochemical analyses of c-di-GMP signaling pathways revealed that L. monocytogenes has three GGDEF domain proteins, DgcA (Lmo1911), DgcB (Lmo1912) and DgcC (Lmo2174), that possess diguanylate cyclase activity, and three EAL domain proteins, PdeB (Lmo0131), PdeC (Lmo1914) and PdeD (Lmo0111), that possess c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity. Deletion of all phosphodiesterase genes (ÎpdeB/C/D) or expression of a heterologous diguanylate cyclase stimulated production of a previously unknown exopolysaccharide. The synthesis of this exopolysaccharide was attributed to the pssA-E (lmo0527-0531) gene cluster. The last gene of the cluster encodes the fourth listerial GGDEF domain protein, PssE, that functions as an I-site c-di-GMP receptor essential for exopolysaccharide synthesis. The c-di-GMP-inducible exopolysaccharide causes cell aggregation in minimal medium and impairs bacterial migration in semi-solid agar, however, it does not promote biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces. The exopolysaccharide also greatly enhances bacterial tolerance to commonly used disinfectants as well as desiccation, which may contribute to survival of L. monocytogenes on contaminated food products and in food-processing facilities. The exopolysaccharide and another, as yet unknown c-di-GMP-dependent target, drastically decrease listerial invasiveness in enterocytes in vitro, and lower pathogen load in the liver and gallbladder of mice infected via an oral route, which suggests that elevated c-di-GMP levels play an overall negative role in listerial virulence.

As guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) is an important messenger in melanocyte signaling we have compared the regulation of cGMP levels in human melanocytes and melanoma cells with different metastatic potential under hypergravity conditions. We were able to demonstrate that long-term exposure to hypergravity stimulates cGMP efflux in cultured human melanocytes and non- metastatic melanoma cells, whereas highly metastatic melanoma cells appear to be insensitive to hypergravity, most probably, due to an up-regulated cGMP efflux at 1g. Here we report that these effects are associated with the expression of the multidrug resistance proteins 4 and 5 known to act as selective export pumps for amphiphilic anions like cGMP. Thus, an altered gravity vector may induce cGMP-dependent signaling events in melanocytic cells that could be important for malignant transformation.\n\nCoordinated Cyclic-Di-GMP Repression of Salmonella Motility through YcgR and Cellulose\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZorraquino, Violeta; GarcÃ­a, BegoÃ±a; Latasa, Cristina; Echeverz, Maite; Toledo-Arana, Alejandro; Valle, Jaione\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a secondary messenger that controls a variety of cellular processes, including the switch between a biofilm and a planktonic bacterial lifestyle. This nucleotide binds to cellular effectors in order to exert its regulatory functions. In Salmonella, two proteins, BcsA and YcgR, both of them containing a c-di-GMP binding PilZ domain, are the only known c-di-GMP receptors. BcsA, upon c-di-GMP binding, synthesizes cellulose, the main exopolysaccharide of the biofilm matrix. YcgR is dedicated to c-di-GMP-dependent inhibition of motility through its interaction with flagellar motor proteins. However, previous evidences indicate that in the absence of YcgR, there is still an additional element that mediates motility impairment under high c-di-GMP levels. Here we have uncovered that cellulose per se is the factor that further promotes inhibition of bacterial motility once high c-di-GMP contents drive the activation of a sessile lifestyle. Inactivation of different genes of the bcsABZC operon, mutation of the conserved residues in the RxxxR motif of the BcsA PilZ domain, or degradation of the cellulose produced by BcsA rescued the motility defect of ÎycgR strains in which high c-di-GMP levels were reached through the overexpression of diguanylate cyclases. High c-di-GMP levels provoked cellulose accumulation around cells that impeded flagellar rotation, probably by means of steric hindrance, without affecting flagellum gene expression, exportation, or assembly. Our results highlight the relevance of cellulose in Salmonella lifestyle switching as an architectural element that is both essential for biofilm development and required, in collaboration with YcgR, for complete motility inhibition. PMID:23161026\n\nIntegration of the Second Messenger c-di-GMP into the Chemotactic Signaling Pathway\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRussell, Matthew H.; Bible, Amber N.; Fang, Xin; Gooding, Jessica R.; Campagna, Shawn R.; Gomelsky, Mark; Alexandre, Gladys\n\n2013-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Elevated intracellular levels of the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP are known to suppress motility and promote sessility. Bacterial chemotaxis guides motile cells in gradients of attractants and repellents over broad concentration ranges, thus allowing bacteria to quickly adapt to changes in their surroundings. Here, we describe a chemotaxis receptor that enhances, as opposed to suppresses, motility in response to temporary increases in intracellular c-di-GMP. Azospirillum brasilenseâs preferred metabolism is adapted to microaerophily, and these motile cells quickly navigate to zones of low oxygen concentration by aerotaxis. We observed that changes in oxygen concentration result in rapid changes in intracellular c-di-GMP levels. The aerotaxis and chemotaxis receptor, Tlp1, binds c-di-GMP via its C-terminal PilZ domain and promotes persistent motility by increasing swimming velocity and decreasing swimming reversal frequency, which helps A.Â brasilense reach low-oxygen zones. If c-di-GMP levels remain high for extended periods, A.Â brasilense forms nonmotile clumps or biofilms on abiotic surfaces. These results suggest that association of increased c-di-GMP levels with sessility is correct on a long-term scale, while in the short-term c-di-GMP may actually promote, as opposed to suppress, motility. Our data suggest that sensing c-di-GMP by Tlp1 functions similar to methylation-based adaptation. Numerous chemotaxis receptors contain C-terminal PilZ domains or other sensory domains, suggesting that intracellular c-di-GMP as well as additional stimuli can be used to modulate adaptation of bacterial chemotaxis receptors.

The loop diuretic furosemide is a potent inhibitor of NKCC2. However, less is known about the mechanism regulating the electrolyte transporter. Considering the well-established effects of nitric oxide on NKCC2 activity, cGMP is likely involved in this regulation. cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI; PKGI) is a cGMP target protein that phosphorylates different substrates after activation through cGMP. We investigated the potential correlation between the cGMP/cGKI pathway and NKCC2 regulation. We treated wild-type (wt) and cGKIÎ±-rescue mice with furosemide. cGKIÎ±-rescue mice expressed cGKIÎ± only under the control of the smooth muscle-specific transgelin (SM22) promoter in a cGKI deficient background. Furosemide treatment increased the urine excretion of sodium and chloride in cGKIÎ±-rescue mice compared to that in wt mice. We analyzed the phosphorylation of NKCC2 by western blotting and immunostaining using the phosphospecific antibody R5. The administration of furosemide significantly increased the phosphorylated NKCC2 signal in wt but not in cGKIÎ±-rescue mice. NKCC2 activation led to its phosphorylation and membrane translocation. To examine whether cGKI was involved in this process, we analyzed vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, which is phosphorylated by cGKI. Furosemide injection resulted in increased vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation in wt mice. We hypothesize that furosemide administration activated cGKI, leading to NKCC2 phosphorylation and membrane translocation. This cGKI-mediated pathway could be a mechanism to compensate for the inhibitory effect of furosemide on NKCC2.

Accordingly, the supply of cells for clinical applications in highest quality is required. As hMSCs are considered as an advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), they underlie the requirements of GMP and PAT according to the authorities (FDA and EMA). The production process of these cells must therefore be documented according to GMP, which is usually performed via a GMP protocol based on standard operating procedures. This chapter provides an example of such a GMP protocol for hMSC, here a genetically modified allogenic cell line, based on a production process in a microcarrier-based stirred tank reactor including process monitoring according to PAT and final product quality assurance.\n\nA new adjuvant delivery system 'cyclic di-GMP/YSK05 liposome' for cancer immunotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyabe, Hiroko; Hyodo, Mamoru; Nakamura, Takashi; Sato, Yusuke; Hayakawa, Yoshihiro; Harashima, Hideyoshi\n\n2014-06-28\n\nCyclic dinucleotides are of importance in the field of microbiology and immunology. They function as second messengers and are thought to participate in the signal transduction of cytosolic DNA immune responses. One such dinucleotide, cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), stimulates the immune system. It is thought that c-di-GMP is recognized by ATP dependent RNA helicase (DDX41) in the cytosol, forms a complex with the Stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), triggers a signal via the tank binding kinase 1-interferon regulatory factor 3 (TBK1-IRF3) pathway and induces the production of type I interferons. Therefore c-di-GMP can be thought of as a new class of adjuvant. However, because c-di-GMP contains two phosphate groups, this prevents its use as an adjuvant because it cannot pass through the cell membrane, even though the target molecule of c-di-GMP is located in the cytoplasm. Our group has been developing a series of liposomal drug delivery systems and recently investigated YSK05 which is a synthetic, pH sensitive lipid that has a high fusogenicity. We utilized this lipid as a carrier to transport c-di-GMP into the cytosol to then use c-di-GMP as an adjuvant. Based on screening experiments, YSK05/POPE/cholesterol=40/25/35 was found to induce IFN-Î² in Raw264.7 cells. The induction of IFN-Î² from c-di-GMP liposomes was inhibited by adding BX795, a TBK1 inhibitor, indicating that the production of IFN-Î² caused the activation of the STING-TBK1 pathway. C-di-GMP liposomes also showed significantly higher levels of expression of CD80, CD86 and MHC class I. The c-di-GMP/YSK05 liposome facilitated antigen specific cytotoxic T cell activity and the inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse model. These findings indicate that c-di-GMP/YSK05 liposomes could be used, not only to transfer c-di-GMP to the cytosol and induce an innate immune system but also as a platform for investigating the mechanism of immune sensing with cyclic dinucleotides in vitro and in vivo.

Thus, investigation of c-di-GMP regulation requires reliable methods for the assessment of c-di-GMP levels and turnover. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis has become a commonly used approach to accomplish these goals. The following describes the extraction and HPLC-based detection and quantification of c-di-GMP from Pseudomonas aeruginosa samples, a procedure that is amenable to modifications for the analysis of c-di-GMP in other bacterial species.\n\nModulation by cyclic GMP of the odour sensitivity of vertebrate olfactory receptor cells\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLeinders-Zufall, T.; Shepherd, G. M.; Zufall, F.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nRecent evidence has indicated a significant role for the cGMP second messenger system in vertebrate olfactory transduction but no clear functions have been identified for cGMP so far. Here, we have examined the effects of 8-Br-cGMP and carbon monoxide (CO) on odour responses of salamander olfactory receptor neurons using perforated patch recordings. We report that 8-Br-cGMP strongly down-regulates the odour sensitivity of the cells, with a K1/2 of 460 nM. This adaptation-like effect can be mimicked by CO, an activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, with a K1/2 of 1 microM. Sensitivity modulation is achieved through a regulatory chain of events in which cGMP stimulates a persistent background current due to the activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. This in turn leads to sustained Ca2+ entry providing a negative feedback signal. One consequence of the Ca2+ entry is a shift to the right of the stimulus-response curve and a reduction in saturating odour currents. Together, these two effects can reduce the sensory generator current by up to twenty-fold. Thus, cGMP functions to control the gain of the G-protein coupled cAMP pathway. Another consequence of the action of cGMP is a marked prolongation of the odour response kinetics. The effects of CO/cGMP are long-lasting and can continue for minutes. Hence, we propose that cGMP helps to prevent saturation of the cell's response by adjusting the operational range of the cAMP cascade and contributes to olfactory adaptation by decreasing the sensitivity of olfactory receptor cells to repeated odour stimuli.\n\nThe cyclic-di-GMP signaling pathway in the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNovak, Elizabeth A.; Sultan, Syed Z.; Motaleb, Md. A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn nature, the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi cycles between the unrelated environments of the Ixodes tick vector and mammalian host. In order to survive transmission between hosts, B. burgdorferi must be able to not only detect changes in its environment, but also rapidly and appropriately respond to these changes. One manner in which this obligate parasite regulates and adapts to its changing environment is through cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling. c-di-GMP has been shown to be instrumental in orchestrating the adaptation of B. burgdorferi to the tick environment. B. burgdorferi possesses only one set of c-di-GMP-metabolizing genes (one diguanylate cyclase and two distinct phosphodiesterases) and one c-di-GMP-binding PilZ-domain protein designated as PlzA. While studies in the realm of c-di-GMP signaling in B. burgdorferi have exploded in the last few years, there are still many more questions than answers. Elucidation of the importance of c-di-GMP signaling to B. burgdorferi may lead to the identification of mechanisms that are critical for the survival of B. burgdorferi in the tick phase of the enzootic cycle as well as potentially delineate a role (if any) c-di-GMP may play in the transmission and virulence of B. burgdorferi during the enzootic cycle, thereby enabling the development of effective drugs for the prevention and/or treatment of Lyme disease.

Diguanylate cyclases containing GGDEF and phosphodiesterases containing EAL domains have been identified as the enzymes controlling cellular c-di-GMP levels, yet less is known regarding signal transmission and the targets of c-di-GMP. FimX, a protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that governs twitching motility, belongs to a large subfamily containing both GGDEF and EAL domains. Biochemical and structural analyses reveals its function as a high-affinity receptor for c-di-GMP. A model for full-length FimX was generated combining solution scattering data andmoreÂ Â» crystal structures of the degenerate GGDEF and EAL domains. Although FimX forms a dimer in solution via the N-terminal domains, a crystallographic EAL domain dimer suggests modes for the regulation of FimX by c-di-GMP binding. The results provide the structural basis for c-di-GMP sensing via degenerate phosphodiesterases.Â«Â less\n\nNitric Oxide Mediates Glutamate-Linked Enhancement of cGMP Levels in the Cerebellum\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBredt, David S.; Snyder, Solomon H.\n\n1989-11-01\n\nNitric oxide, which mediates influences of numerous neurotransmitters and modulators on vascular smooth muscle and leukocytes, can be formed in the brain from arginine by an enzymatic activity that stoichiometrically generates citrulline. We show that glutamate and related amino acids, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate, markedly stimulate arginine-citrulline transformation in cerebellar slices stoichiometrically with enhancement of cGMP levels. NÏ-monomethyl-L-arginine blocks the augmentation both of citrulline and cGMP with identical potencies. Arginine competitively reverses both effects of NÏ-monomethyl-L-arginine with the same potencies. Hemoglobin, which complexes nitric oxide, prevents the stimulation by N-methyl-D-aspartate of cGMP levels, and superoxide dismutase, which elevates nitric oxide levels, increases cGMP formation. These data establish that nitric oxide mediates the stimulation by glutamate of cGMP formation.\n\nStructural Basis of Cyclic Nucleotide Selectivity in cGMP-dependent Protein Kinase II\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nCampbell, James C.; Kim, Jeong Joo; Li, Kevin Y.; ...\n\n2016-01-14\n\nMembrane-bound cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) II is an important regulator of bone growth, renin secretion, and memory formation. Despite its crucial physiological roles, little is known about its cyclic nucleotide selectivity mechanism due to a lack of structural information. Here, we find that the C-terminal cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB-B) domain of PKGII binds cGMP with higher affinity and selectivity when compared with its N-terminal CNB (CNB-A) domain. To understand the structural basis of cGMP selectivity, we solved co-crystal structures of the CNB domains with cyclic nucleotides. Our structures combined with mutagenesis demonstrate that the guanine-specific contacts at Asp-412 and Arg-415moreÂ Â» of the Î±C-helix of CNB-B are crucial for cGMP selectivity and activation of PKG II. Structural comparison with the cGMP selective CNB domains of human PKG I and Plasmodium falciparum PKG (PfPKG) shows different contacts with the guanine moiety, revealing a unique cGMP selectivity mechanism for PKG II.Â«Â less\n\nPosttranscriptional regulation of human iNOS by the NO/cGMP pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nPÃ©rez-Sala, D; Cernuda-MorollÃ³n, E; DÃ­az-Cazorla, M; RodrÃ­guez-Pascual, F; Lamas, S\n\n2001-03-01\n\nNitric oxide (NO) and cGMP may exert positive or negative effects on inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression. We have explored the influence of the NO/cGMP pathway on iNOS levels in human mesangial cells. Inhibition of NOS activity during an 8-h stimulation with IL-1beta plus tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha reduced iNOS levels, while NO donors amplified iNOS induction threefold. However, time-course studies revealed a subsequent inhibitory effect of NO donors on iNOS protein and mRNA levels. This suggests that NO may contribute both to iNOS induction and downregulation. Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activation may be involved in these effects. Inhibition of sGC attenuated IL-1beta/TNF-alpha-elicited iNOS induction and reduced NO-driven amplification. Interestingly, cGMP analogs also modulated iNOS protein and mRNA levels in a biphasic manner. Inhibition of transcription unveiled a negative posttranscriptional modulation of the iNOS transcript by NO and cGMP at late times of induction. Supplementation with 8-bromo-cGMP (8-BrcGMP) reduced iNOS mRNA stability by 50%. These observations evidence a complex feedback regulation of iNOS expression, in which posttranscriptional mechanisms may play an important role.\n\nIntercellular signaling via cyclic GMP diffusion through gap junctions restarts meiosis in mouse ovarian follicles.\n\nPubMed\n\nShuhaibar, Leia C; Egbert, Jeremy R; Norris, Rachael P; Lampe, Paul D; Nikolaev, Viacheslav O; Thunemann, Martin; Wen, Lai; Feil, Robert; Jaffe, Laurinda A\n\n2015-04-28\n\nMeiosis in mammalian oocytes is paused until luteinizing hormone (LH) activates receptors in the mural granulosa cells of the ovarian follicle. Prior work has established the central role of cyclic GMP (cGMP) from the granulosa cells in maintaining meiotic arrest, but it is not clear how binding of LH to receptors that are located up to 10 cell layers away from the oocyte lowers oocyte cGMP and restarts meiosis. Here, by visualizing intercellular trafficking of cGMP in real-time in live follicles from mice expressing a FRET sensor, we show that diffusion of cGMP through gap junctions is responsible not only for maintaining meiotic arrest, but also for rapid transmission of the signal that reinitiates meiosis from the follicle surface to the oocyte. Before LH exposure, the cGMP concentration throughout the follicle is at a uniformly high level of â¼2-4 Î¼M. Then, within 1 min of LH application, cGMP begins to decrease in the peripheral granulosa cells. As a consequence, cGMP from the oocyte diffuses into the sink provided by the large granulosa cell volume, such that by 20 min the cGMP concentration in the follicle is uniformly low, â¼100 nM. The decrease in cGMP in the oocyte relieves the inhibition of the meiotic cell cycle. This direct demonstration that a physiological signal initiated by a stimulus in one region of an intact tissue can travel across many layers of cells via cyclic nucleotide diffusion through gap junctions could provide a general mechanism for diverse cellular processes.\n\nFrom bedside to bench--meeting report of the 7th International Conference on cGMP \"cGMP: generators, effectors and therapeutic implications\" in Trier, Germany, from June 19th to 21st 2015.\n\nPubMed\n\nFriebe, Andreas; Sandner, Peter; Seifert, Roland\n\n2015-12-01\n\nDuring the past decade, our knowledge on the physiology, pathophysiology, basic pharmacology, and clinical pharmacology of the second messenger (cGMP) has increased tremendously. It is now well-established that cGMP, generated by soluble and particulate guanylate cyclases, is highly compartmentalized in cells and regulates numerous body functions. New cGMP-regulated physiological functions include meiosis and temperature perception. cGMP is involved in the genesis of numerous pathologies including cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, metabolic, neuropsychiatric, eye, and tumor diseases. Several new clinical uses of stimulators and activators of soluble guanylate cyclase and of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as heart failure, kidney failure, cognitive disorders, obesity bronchial asthma, and osteoporosis are emerging. The combination of neprilysin inhibitors-enhancing stimulation of the particulate guanylate cyclase pathway by preventing natriuretic peptide degradation-with angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists constitutes a novel promising strategy for heart failure treatment. The role of oxidative stress in cGMP signaling, application of cGMP sensors, and gene therapy for degenerative eye diseases are emerging topics. It is anticipated that cGMP research will further prosper over the next years and reach out into more and more basic and clinical disciplines.\n\nBacterial Signal Transduction by Cyclic Di-GMP and Other Nucleotide Second Messengers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGrÃ¼ndling, Angelika; Jenal, Urs; Ryan, Robert; Yildiz, Fitnat\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe first International Symposium on c-Di-GMP Signaling in Bacteria (22 to 25 March 2015, Harnack-Haus, Berlin, Germany) brought together 131 molecular microbiologists from 17 countries to discuss recent progress in our knowledge of bacterial nucleotide second messenger signaling. While the focus was on signal input, synthesis, degradation, and the striking diversity of the modes of action of the current second messenger paradigm, i.e., cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), âclassicsâ like cAMP and (p)ppGpp were also presented, in novel facets, and more recent ânewcomers,â such as c-di-AMP and c-AMP-GMP, made an impressive appearance. A number of clear trends emerged during the 30 talks, on the 71 posters, and in the lively discussions, including (i) c-di-GMP control of the activities of various ATPases and phosphorylation cascades, (ii) extensive cross talk between c-di-GMP and other nucleotide second messenger signaling pathways, and (iii) a stunning number of novel effectors for nucleotide second messengers that surprisingly include some long-known master regulators of developmental pathways. Overall, the conference made it amply clear that second messenger signaling is currently one of the most dynamic fields within molecular microbiology, with major impacts in research fields ranging from human health to microbial ecology.

To better understand the regulatory mechanism, x-ray crystallographic and biochemical studies were performed on constructs of human PDE5A1 containing the N-terminal phosphorylation segment, GAF-A, and GAF-B. Superposition of this unliganded GAF-A with the previously reported NMR structure of cGMP-bound PDE5 revealed dramatic conformational differences and suggested that helix H4 and strand B3 probably serve as two lids to gate the cGMP-binding pocket in GAF-A. The structure also identified an interfacial region among GAF-A, GAF-B, and the N-terminal loop, whichmoreÂ Â» may serve as a relay of the cGMP signal from GAF-A to GAF-B. N-terminal loop 98-147 was physically associated with GAF-B domains of the dimer. Biochemical analyses showed an inhibitory effect of this loop on cGMP binding and its involvement in the cGMP-induced conformation changes.Â«Â less\n\nImportance of NO/cGMP signalling via cGMP-dependent protein kinase II for controlling emotionality and neurobehavioural effects of alcohol.\n\nPubMed\n\nWerner, Claudia; Raivich, Gennadij; Cowen, Michael; Strekalova, Tatyana; Sillaber, Inge; Buters, Jeroen T; Spanagel, Rainer; Hofmann, Franz\n\n2004-12-01\n\nCyclic GMP is a second messenger for nitric oxide (NO) that acts as a mediator for many different physiological functions. The cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs) mediate cellular signalling induced by NO and cGMP. Here, we explored the localization of cGMP-dependent protein kinase type II (cGKII) in the mouse brain. In situ hybridization revealed high levels of cGKII mRNA in cerebral cortex, thalamic nuclei, hypothalamic nuclei, and in several basal forebrain regions including medial septum, striatum and amygdala. The close link to NO and the distribution pattern of cGKII suggested that this enzyme might be involved in emotional reactions and responses to drugs of abuse. Therefore, cGKII knockout animals (cGKII-/-) were compared with littermate controls in behavioural tests (i) for emotion-linked and (ii) for acute and chronic ethanol responses. Deletion of cGKII did not influence aggressive behaviour but led to enhanced anxiety-like behaviour. In terms of acute responses to ethanol, cGKII-/- mice were hyposensitive to hypnotic doses of ethanol as measured by the loss of righting reflex, without an alteration in their blood alcohol elimination. In a two-bottle free choice test, cGKII-/- mice showed elevated alcohol consumption. No taste differences to sweet solutions were observed compared to control animals. In summary, our data show that cGKII activity modulates anxiety-like behaviour and neurobehavioural effects of alcohol.\n\n8-Nitro-cGMP promotes bone growth through expansion of growth plate cartilage.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoshino, Marie; Kaneko, Kotaro; Miyamoto, Yoichi; Yoshimura, Kentaro; Suzuki, Dai; Akaike, Takaaki; Sawa, Tomohiro; Ida, Tomoaki; Fujii, Shigemoto; Ihara, Hideshi; Tanaka, Junichi; Tsukuura, Risa; Chikazu, Daichi; Mishima, Kenji; Baba, Kazuyoshi; Kamijo, Ryutaro\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIn endochondral ossification, growth of bones occurs at their growth plate cartilage. While it is known that nitric oxide (NO) synthases are required for proliferation of chondrocytes in growth plate cartilage and growth of bones, the precise mechanism by which NO facilitates these process has not been clarified yet. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) also positively regulate elongation of bones through expansion of the growth plate cartilage. Both NO and CNP are known to use cGMP as the second messenger. Recently, 8-nitro-cGMP was identified as a signaling molecule produced in the presence of NO in various types of cells. Here, we found that 8-nitro-cGMP is produced in proliferating chondrocytes in the growth plates, which was enhanced by CNP, in bones cultured ex vivo. In addition, 8-nitro-cGMP promoted bone growth with expansion of the proliferating zone as well as increase in the number of proliferating cells in the growth plates. 8-Nitro-cGMP also promoted the proliferation of chondrocytes in vitro. On the other hand, 8-bromo-cGMP enhanced the growth of bones with expansion of hypertrophic zone of the growth plates without affecting either the width of proliferating zone or proliferation of chondrocytes. These results indicate that 8-nitro-cGMP formed in growth plate cartilage accelerates chondrocyte proliferation and bone growth as a downstream molecule of NO. Copyright Â© 2017.

The soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a key transducer in NO signaling, catalyzes the formation of the second messenger guanosine 3Â´,5Â´-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic cGMP or cGMP). For human melanocytes, which are responsible for skin pigmentation by synthesizing the pigment melanin, it has been reported that the NO/sGC/cGMP pathway is involved in UVB-induced melanogenesis. Melanin acts as a scavenger for free radicals that may arise during metabolic stress. It may also act as a photosensitizer that generates active oxygen species upon UV irradiation, which may initiate hypopigmentary disorders (e.g., vitiligo) as well as UV-induced oncogene cell transformation. In addition, melanoma, a deadly skin cancer, which arises from transformed melanocytes, is characterized by a resistance to chemotherapy. In our studies we have shown that NO can induce perturbation of melanocyte-extracellular matrix component interactions, which may contribute to loss of melanocytes or melanoma metastasis. Such NO effects appear to be modulated partly via cGMP. Moreover, we found that different guanylyl cyclase isoforms are responsible for cGMP synthesis in melanocytic cells. Normal human melanocytes and nonmetastatic melanoma cells predominantly express sGC, which appears to be associated with melanogenesis, whereas absence of NO-sensitive GC, but up-regulated activities of the natriuretic peptide-sensitive membrane guanylyl cyclase isoforms were found in highly metastatic phenotypes. Due to the growing interest in the regulation of signaling activities in normal and transformed cells under altered gravity conditions, we have further investigated whether the NO/cGMP signaling is involved in melanocyte response to gravitational stress. We found that normal human melanocytes and non-metastatic melanoma cell lines, but not highly metastatic cells\n\nAmyloid-Î² Peptide Is Needed for cGMP-Induced Long-Term Potentiation and Memory.\n\nPubMed\n\nPalmeri, Agostino; Ricciarelli, Roberta; Gulisano, Walter; Rivera, Daniela; Rebosio, Claudia; Calcagno, Elisa; Tropea, Maria Rosaria; Conti, Silvia; Das, Utpal; Roy, Subhojit; Pronzato, Maria Adelaide; Arancio, Ottavio; Fedele, Ernesto; Puzzo, Daniela\n\n2017-07-19\n\nHigh levels of amyloid-Î² peptide (AÎ²) have been related to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, in the healthy brain, low physiologically relevant concentrations of AÎ² are necessary for long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. Because cGMP plays a key role in these processes, here we investigated whether the cyclic nucleotide cGMP influences AÎ² levels and function during LTP and memory. We demonstrate that the increase of cGMP levels by the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors sildenafil and vardenafil induces a parallel release of AÎ² due to a change in the approximation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the Î²-site APP cleaving enzyme 1. Moreover, electrophysiological and behavioral studies performed on animals of both sexes showed that blocking AÎ² function, by using anti-murine AÎ² antibodies or APP knock-out mice, prevents the cGMP-dependent enhancement of LTP and memory. Our data suggest that cGMP positively regulates AÎ² levels in the healthy brain which, in turn, boosts synaptic plasticity and memory. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) is a key pathogenetic factor in Alzheimer's disease. However, low concentrations of endogenous AÎ², mimicking levels of the peptide in the healthy brain, enhance hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. Because the second messenger cGMP exerts a central role in LTP mechanisms, here we studied whether cGMP affects AÎ² levels and function during LTP. We show that cGMP enhances AÎ² production by increasing the APP/BACE-1 convergence in endolysosomal compartments. Moreover, the cGMP-induced enhancement of LTP and memory was disrupted by blockade of AÎ², suggesting that the physiological effect of the cyclic nucleotide on LTP and memory is dependent upon AÎ².

While O3 causes mitochondrial H2O2, early leaf nitric oxide (NO) as well as transient ethylene (ET) accumulation, the levels of jasmonic acid and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid remained unchanged. It was shown that both, NO and ET dependent pathways can induce AOX1a transcription by O3. AOX plays a role in reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) which in turn are linked to biotic and abiotic plant stresses, much like the second messengers guanosine 3â², 5â²-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP). The goal is to unravel specific cGMP signatures and induction pathways downstream from O3 and NO, including transcription of AOX1a. Here we propose that some late (>3 h) responses to NO, e.g., the accumulation of phenylalanine lyase (PAL) transcripts, are critically cGMP dependent, while the early (<2 h) responses, including AOX1a induction are not.

The c-di-GMP riboswitch (GEMM) is an important downstream target in this signaling pathway and alters gene expression in response to changing concentrations of c-di-GMP. The riboswitch selectively recognizes its second messenger ligand primarily through contacts with two critical nucleotides. However, these two nucleotides are not the most highly conserved residues within the riboswitch sequence. Instead, nucleotides that stack with c-di-GMP and that form tertiary RNA contacts are the most invariant. Biochemical and structural evidence reveals that themoreÂ Â» most common natural variants are able to make alternative pairing interactions with both guanine bases of the ligand. Additionally, a high-resolution (2.3 {angstrom}) crystal structure of the native complex reveals that a single metal coordinates the c-di-GMP backbone. Evidence is also provided that after transcription of the first nucleotide on the 3{prime}-side of the P1 helix, which is predicted to be the molecular switch, the aptamer is functional for ligand binding. Although large energetic effects occur when several residues in the RNA are altered, mutations at the most conserved positions, rather than at positions that base pair with c-di-GMP, have the most detrimental effects on binding. Many mutants retain sufficient c-di-GMP affinity for the RNA to remain biologically relevant, which suggests that this motif is quite resilient to mutation.Â«Â less\n\nInhibition of Cyclic GMP Export by Multidrug Resistance Protein 4: A New Strategy to Treat Erectile Dysfunction?\n\nPubMed\n\nBoydens, Charlotte; Pauwels, Bart; Vanden Daele, Laura; Van de Voorde, Johan\n\n2017-04-01\n\nIntracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations are regulated by degradation enzymes (phosphodiesterases) and by active transport across the plasma membrane by multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) 4 andÂ 5. To evaluate the functional effect of MRP-4 inhibition and the role of MRP-4-mediated cGMP export in mouse corpora cavernosa. Isometric tension of mouse corpora cavernosa was measured after cumulative addition of MK-571, an inhibitor of MRP-4, or sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor. In addition, the effect of MRP-4 inhibition on cGMP-independent and cGMP-dependent relaxations was studied. InÂ vivo intracavernosal pressure and mean arterial pressure measurements were performed after intracavernosal injection of MK-571. The effect of MRP-4 inhibition on cGMP content was determined using an enzyme immunoassay kit. Measurement of the effect of MK-571 on cGMP content, relaxant responses of mouse corpora cavernosa to cGMP-independent and cGMP-dependent vasodilating substances, and determination of the ratio of intracavernosal pressure to mean arterial pressure after intracavernosal injection of MK-571. MK-571 and sildenafil relaxed the corpora cavernosa concentration dependently, with sildenafil being the more potent relaxing compound. Furthermore, MK-571 enhanced relaxing responses to cGMP-dependent substances, such as sodium nitroprusside, sildenafil, acetylcholine, and electrical field stimulation, with the latter even under inÂ vitro diabetic conditions. In contrast, cGMP-independent relaxations were not altered by MRP-4 inhibition. Intracavernosal administration of MK-571 significantly increased intracavernosal pressure, with minimal effect on mean arterial pressure. The cGMP analysis showed that MRP-4 inhibition was accompanied by increased cGMP levels. MRP-4, at least when targeted locally in the penis or when combined with a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, might be a valuable alternative strategy for the treatment of\n\nLiposomes loaded with a STING pathway ligand, cyclic di-GMP, enhance cancer immunotherapy against metastatic melanoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakamura, Takashi; Miyabe, Hiroko; Hyodo, Mamoru; Sato, Yusuke; Hayakawa, Yoshihiro; Harashima, Hideyoshi\n\n2015-10-28\n\nMalignant melanomas escape immunosurveillance via the loss/down-regulation of MHC-I expression. Natural killer (NK) cells have the potential to function as essential effector cells for eliminating melanomas. Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), a ligand of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signal pathway, can be thought of as a new class of adjuvant against cancer. However, it is yet to be tested, because technologies for delivering c-di-GMP to the cytosol are required. Herein, we report that c-di-GMP efficiently activates NK cells and induces antitumor effects against malignant melanomas when loaded in YSK05 lipid containing liposomes, by assisting in the efficient delivery of c-di-GMP to the cytosol. The intravenous administration of c-di-GMP encapsulated within YSK05-liposomes (c-di-GMP/YSK05-Lip) into mice efficiently induced the production of type I interferon (IFN) as well as the activation of NK cells, resulting in a significant antitumor effect in a lung metastasis mouse model using B16-F10. This antitumor effect was dominated by NK cells. The infiltration of NK cells was observed in the lungs with B16-F10 melanomas. These findings indicate that the c-di-GMP/YSK05-Lip induces MHC-I non-restricted antitumor immunity mediated by NK cells. Consequently, c-di-GMP/YSK05-Lip represents a potentially new adjuvant system for use in immunotherapy against malignant melanomas. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The atriopeptin-catalysed increase in cyclic GMP was transient and reached a maximum some 10-20 min after challenge of cells with atriopeptin. The basis for the transience of this increase was shown to be due to the desensitization of guanylate cyclase coupled with extrusion of cyclic GMP from the cells and the degradation of cyclic GMP by phosphodiesterase activity. Atriopeptin-catalysed extrusion of cyclic GMP was time- and dose-(EC50 ca. 1.5 x 10(-8) M) dependent and was inhibited by probenecid but not by high external cyclic GMP concentrations. The extrusion process underwent apparent desensitization as did guanylate cyclase with similar half lives (T1/2 of ca. 20 min). Desensitization was dose-dependent upon atriopeptin and did not appear to be mediated by elevated cyclic GMP concentrations as pre-incubation with 8-bromo cyclic GMP did not cause desensitization and the half-times for desensitization were similar whether or not IBMX was present. The majority of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity was found in the cytosol fraction of the cells and could be separated into two cyclic AMP specific forms and two cyclic GMP preferring forms.\n\nModulation of cGMP by human HO-1 retrovirus gene transfer in pulmonary microvessel endothelial cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbraham, Nader G; Quan, Shuo; Mieyal, Paul A; Yang, Liming; Burke-Wolin, Theresa; Mingone, Christopher J; Goodman, Alvin I; Nasjletti, Alberto; Wolin, Michael S\n\n2002-11-01\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) stimulates guanylate cyclase (GC) and increases guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) levels. We transfected rat-lung pulmonary endothelial cells with a retrovirus-mediated human heme oxygenase (hHO)-1 gene. Pulmonary cells that expressed hHO-1 exhibited a fourfold increase in HO activity associated with decreases in the steady-state levels of heme and cGMP without changes in soluble GC (sGC) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) proteins or basal nitrite production. Heme elicited significant increases in CO production and intracellular cGMP levels in both pulmonary endothelial and pulmonary hHO-1-expressing cells. N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of NOS, significantly decreased cGMP levels in heme-treated pulmonary endothelial cells but not heme-treated hHO-1-expressing cells. In the presence of exogenous heme, CO and cGMP levels in hHO-1-expressing cells exceeded the corresponding levels in pulmonary endothelial cells. Acute exposure of endothelial cells to SnCl2, which is an inducer of HO-1, increased cGMP levels, whereas chronic exposure decreased heme and cGMP levels. These results indicate that prolonged overexpression of HO-1 ultimately decreases sGC activity by limiting the availability of cellular heme. Heme activates sGC and enhances cGMP levels via a mechanism that is largely insensitive to NOS inhibition.\n\nAn atypical CNG channel activated by a single cGMP molecule controls sperm chemotaxis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBÃ¶nigk, Wolfgang; Loogen, Astrid; Seifert, Reinhard; Kashikar, Nachiket; Klemm, Clementine; Krause, Eberhard; Hagen, Volker; Kremmer, Elisabeth; StrÃ¼nker, Timo; Kaupp, U Benjamin\n\n2009-10-27\n\nSperm of the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata can respond to a single molecule of chemoattractant released by an egg. The mechanism underlying this extreme sensitivity is unknown. Crucial signaling events in the response of A. punctulata sperm to chemoattractant include the rapid synthesis of the intracellular messenger guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) and the ensuing membrane hyperpolarization that results from the opening of potassium-selective cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNGK) channels. Here, we use calibrated photolysis of caged cGMP to show that approximately 45 cGMP molecules are generated during the response to a single molecule of chemoattractant. The CNGK channel can respond to such small cGMP changes because it is exquisitely sensitive to cGMP and activated in a noncooperative fashion. Like voltage-activated Ca(v) and Na(v) channels, the CNGK polypeptide consists of four homologous repeat sequences. Disabling each of the four cyclic nucleotide-binding sites through mutagenesis revealed that binding of a single cGMP molecule to repeat 3 is necessary and sufficient to activate the CNGK channel. Thus, CNGK has developed a mechanism of activation that is different from the activation of other CNG channels, which requires the cooperative binding of several ligands and operates in the micromolar rather than the nanomolar range.\n\nAuxin-induced nitric oxide, cGMP and gibberellins were involved in the gravitropism\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCai, Weiming; Hu, Liwei; Hu, Xiangyang; Cui, Dayong; Cai, Weiming\n\nGravitropism is the asymmetric growth or curvature of plant organs in response to gravistimulation.

In our studies before, mediation of the gravitropic bending of soybean roots and rice leaf sheath bases by nitric oxide, cGMP and gibberellins, are induced by auxin. The asymmetrical distribution of nitric oxide, cGMP and gibberellins resulted from the asymmetrical synthesis of them in bending sites. In soybean roots, inhibitions of NO and cGMP synthesis reduced differential NO and cGMP accumulation respectively, which both of these effects can lead to the reduction of gravitropic bending. Gibberellin-induced OsXET, OsEXPA4 and OsRWC3 were also found involved in the gravitropic bending. These data indicated that auxin-induced nitric oxide, cGMP and gibberellins were involved in the gravitropism. More experiments need to prove the more detailed mechanism of them.\n\nGating by Cyclic Gmp and Voltage in the Î± Subunit of the Cyclic GmpâGated Channel from Rod Photoreceptors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBenndorf, Klaus; Koopmann, Rolf; Eismann, Elisabeth; Kaupp, U. Benjamin\n\n1999-01-01\n\nGating by cGMP and voltage of the Î± subunit of the cGMP-gated channel from rod photoreceptor was examined with a patch-clamp technique. The channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. At low [cGMP] (<20 Î¼M), the current displayed strong outward rectification. At low and high (700 Î¼M) [cGMP], the channel activity was dominated by only one conductance level. Therefore, the outward rectification at low [cGMP] results solely from an increase in the open probability, P o. Kinetic analysis of single-channel openings revealed two exponential distributions. At low [cGMP], the larger P o at positive voltages with respect to negative voltages is caused by an increased frequency of openings in both components of the open-time distribution. In macroscopic currents, depolarizing voltage steps, starting from â100 mV, generated a time-dependent current that increased with the step size (activation). At low [cGMP] (20 Î¼M), the degree of activation was large and the time course was slow, whereas at saturating [cGMP] (7 mM) the respective changes were small and fast. The doseâresponse relation at â100 mV was shifted to the right and saturated at significantly lower P o values with respect to that at +100 mV (0.77 vs. 0.96). P o was determined as function of the [cGMP] (at +100 and â100 mV) and voltage (at 20, 70, and 700 Î¼M, and 7 mM cGMP). Both relations could be fitted with an allosteric state model consisting of four independent cGMP-binding reactions and one voltage-dependent allosteric opening reaction. At saturating [cGMP] (7 mM), the activation time course was monoexponential, which allowed us to determine the individual rate constants for the allosteric reaction. For the rapid rate constants of cGMP binding and unbinding, lower limits are determined. It is concluded that an allosteric model consisting of four independent cGMP-binding reactions and one voltage-dependent allosteric reaction, describes the cGMP- and voltage-dependent gating of cGMP-gated channels\n\n75 FR 17756 - Availability of the Final General Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement (GMP/EIS...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-04-07\n\n... and Environmental Impact Statement (GMP/EIS) for Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area (CRNRA...) announces the availability of a Final GMP/EIS for the CRNRA, Georgia.
