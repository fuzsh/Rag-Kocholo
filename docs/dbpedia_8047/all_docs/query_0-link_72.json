        "text": "Read our new book! This collection is a go-to resource for individuals wishing to heighten leadership effectiveness through access to vanguard theory and practice. It highlights stories and insights from leadership practitioners and scholars around the world, in the process offering invaluable insights into diverse lessons, models, and practices, and it offers case and place-based chapters that bridge theory and practice to empower diverse actors around the world.\n\nIn these uncertain times of unprecedented environmental, economic, social, and political change, the world needs hopeful and helpful guidance on how to chart a future of global sustainability and collective wellbeing. Beyond asking why the changes are happening to us, we have the opportunity to ask why they are happening for us. In other words, how are we being compelled to evolve our leadership, and who are we being called to become?\n\nYola Carlough, former head of Social Mission at Ben and Jerry’s and director of sustainability at Burt’s Bees, likens the spirit of collaboration in the benefit corporation movement to the spirit of collaboration in the Olympics. We learn and serve and work and strive together for something that matters deeply, not just for our own communities but for the global community. Each fall, the Champions Retreat emboldens that spirit of inspired collaboration and invigorated competition as the standards are heightened and the stakes are raised...\n\nWhen I was first asked to talk at New Hope Media's Natural Products Expo East about Mindfulness In Business: How to Lead for Healthy People and Planet, I was both honored and confronted – honored by an invitation from an industry that has been on the vanguard for responsible business and confronted about how the climate impact of a trip across the country was of justifiable benefit. Then as the tone of the 2016 U.S. Presidential race devolved, along with other global indicators, I realized...\n\nToday, The Restorative Leadership Institute (RLI) was recognized as “Best For The World” for creating the most positive impact by B the Change Media. Honorees are featured in the upcoming fall issue of B Magazine and on B the Change’s digital platform, bthechange.com...\n\nRestorative leadership demonstrates a fundamental belief in human potential and the power and wisdom of community. It’s a belief echoed and practiced by Sister Simone Campbell in her work as a tireless champion for democracy. I recently listened to Sister Simone talk about the role of community in democracy in the On Leading podcast...\n\nThe mystic Aurobindo wrote, \"If there is to be a future, it will wear a crown of feminine design.\" If the state of the world is a reflection of the quality of our leadership, unprecedented indicators and opportunities of the 21st century—socially, politically, culturally, environmentally, and more—are calling us to step up and leap into our greatness as women.\n\nWhat if following your dreams could save the world? Atossa Soltani's dreams may have led her to do just that. It wasn’t until I talked with Atossa Soltani, founder of Amazon Watch, during our interview On Leading that I understood just how important the world’s largest rainforest is for a sustainable future. Astoundingly, each of the Earth's 7+ billion people counts on the Amazon Rainforest for ...\n\nImagine a world in which the ocean is teeming with life and vibrant with color. That is the world that Dr. Sylvia Earle first saw in 1979 as the only human ever to dive untethered to a depth of over half a mile. Having witnessed so much loss in the world’s waters since then, National Geographic Explorer Earle offers deep insight about what we can do to protect and restore nature’s bounty during her interview on On Leading.\n\nWith the emergence of the Zika virus, I am reminded of a recent National Geographic article (January, 2016) on “Health and Climate” that maps the dramatic increase in mosquito-carried disease concurrent with the trends in rising global temperatures...\n\nAt its heart, restorative leadership works to answer the question, how do we bring out the best of our diverse humanity to ensure a sustainable future? One of history’s great proponents of such possibility was Martin Luther King, Jr., who inspired us that: “We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there \"is\" such a thing as being too late...\"\n\nAs concerned citizens of a planet in delicate balance, we call on you, the leaders of the 123 parties of the Rome Statute(1) to make Ecocide the 5th International Crime Against Peace.\n\nIt’s pre-dawn on the morning of the People’s Climate March. The air is moist and crisp, autumn dancing in the air with summer’s yawning presence. The UN Climate Summit, intended to catalyze action for the 2015 UN Climate Negotiations, convenes this week. Yet the most remarkable display of leadership may be the catalytic momentum on the streets.\n\nIn 2014, NPR made the surprising decision to cut back on the number of staffers focused solely on the environment and climate change. But for those committed to making leadership choices that recognize the interconnectedness of all life and serve the highest benefit for all, a reduction in the national news coverage of what some call the most pressing issue of our time is simply not acceptable. And so RLI launched a petition...\n\nUncertainty is a hallmark of the 21st century as we envision the possibility of global equilibrium and collective wellbeing while confronting the reality of having exceeded the limits to growth."
