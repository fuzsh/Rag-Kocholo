        "text": "3.1. Analytical approach\n\nOur analytical approach was divided into three steps (cf. [7]):\n\nIn the first step, we identified and selected case examples in order to represent the different innovative contract types for agri-environmental and climate schemes (result-based, collective, land tenure, and value chain) in our sample. The output of this step was a sample of 19 innovative contracts (4-5 per contract type) from six European countries (cf. data file: contracts_abreviations_hybridity.xlsx).\n\nIn the second step, we used Elinor Ostrom's institutional development and analysis (IAD) framework (cf. [3]) for a structured data collection per selected case, employing a survey. The survey contained 34 questions to collect information on the same number of variables. We linked each variable to one of the five aspects of the IAD framework, describing:\n\n(1)\n\nthe general characteristics of the contract,\n\n(2)\n\nthe biophysical, socio-economic, and political context conditions under which the contract is applied in a given country and region,\n\n(3)\n\nthe targeted interactions within and between the social and ecological system, i.e. which social actors are targeted in the social system to be involved in the contract, and which ecosystem services are targeted in the ecological system, suggesting certain land use measures to increase their provision,\n\n(4)\n\nthe (measurable) outcomes of these interactions, both in the social and the ecological system, and\n\n(5)\n\nthe indicators/criteria used for evaluating the outcomes.\n\nThe output of the second step was a structured description of each contract by 34 variables linked to aspects 1-5 of the IAD framework, creating a data matrix with 646 data points (cf. data file: contracts_x_variables_[matrix].xlsx).\n\nIn the third step, we zoomed in on the social system as part of aspect (3) ‘interactions’ of the IAD framework to conduct an in-depth analysis of the involved actors and their roles in contract governance. Informed by the institutional design of contracts for agri-environmental and climate schemes in general (cf. [4]:8), we grouped actors into three categories: contracted, contracting, and third parties or intermediaries. Further, we differentiated four different actor types: public, private, civil, and hybrid actors, and also considered from which governance level the actors are involved: local, regional, national, or international. For assigning each identified actor's roles in contract governance we build on the work of Westerink and others ([8]:178), who distinguished 12 governance tasks for collective agri-environmental and climate schemes. As a result of our analysis, we complemented these roles with another four (which emerged from the analysis of our selected cases that also included other contract types than collective), resulting in overall 16 possible roles. The output of the third step was a full inventory of 179 identified actors and their respective role/s in contract governance assigning each actor one or more out of the 16 possible roles and creating a data matrix of 2,864 data points (cf. data file: actors_x_roles_[matrix].xlsx).\n\n3.2. Materials and methods\n\nMethods and materials used for the first step in our experimental design: To identify potential cases we employed a method mix combining literature review, web search, and expert consultation (cf. [1]). For expert consultation, we approached team members of the Contracts2.0-project (https://www.project-contracts20.eu/), under which umbrella the research related to the described dataset was conducted, to list possible case examples for result-based, collective, land tenure and value chain contracts for agri-environment and climate schemes. The final selection of cases for our sample was then guided by the rationale to have several contracts to compare for the same contract type and also different contract types for the same country under similar context conditions. We also aimed to represent the diversity of the institutional design of existing contracts, e.g. in terms of bottom-up vs. top-down initiated contracts, contracts related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union vs. CAP-independent contracts, small- vs. large-scale contracts, still young vs. mature contracts, private vs. publicly funded contracts, contracts targeting the provision of single ecosystem services vs. contracts targeting bundles of different ecosystem services (cf. data file contracts_variations.xlsx). Furthermore, we intended to only include existing and mainly still ongoing contracts. To this effect, we did not include any contracts in the planning stage or hypothetical cases constructed for economic experiments. For the assignment of the selected cases to the four contract types (result-based, collective, land tenure, and value chain) we elaborated a list of criteria considering:\n\nI)\n\npayment specifics,\n\nII)\n\nhow land use measures were defined to deliver targeted ecosystem services, and\n\nIII)\n\nthe range of different actors involved.\n\nNevertheless, several contracts showed a hybrid nature combining elements of more than one contract type (cf. data file: contracts_abbreviations_hybridity.xlsx).\n\nOur final sample included 19 case examples representing the four contract types. We focused our selection on European case examples only to keep the overall workload linked to data collection and analysis manageable.\n\nMethods and materials used for the second step in our experimental design: For the structured data collection based on the five aspects of the IAD framework we designed a survey in Excel (Microsoft). The information for the survey was collated from different data sources. We included both freely accessible materials and materials with limited accessibility. Mostly, we looked for contract-specific websites, websites of different actors involved in a specific contract, media websites (e.g. from newspapers) which reported on a specific contract, or websites of different research projects conducting research on innovative contracts. We also included materials retrieved from the respective websites, such as flyers, booklets, reports, project videos. Materials with limited accessibility included internal documents available through the Contracts2.0-project, such as internal milestones, notes from work meetings, and interviews conducted with experts directly involved in a specific contract. During the interviews, we filled in the survey together, or the survey was sent to experts involved in a specific contract who volunteered to fill in the survey themselves. We primarily analyzed information available in English, but also included materials in the local languages. For languages one of us co-authors was familiar with (i.e. French and German) we translated the information ourselves. For materials in local languages neither of us was familiar with (i.e. Dutch and Flemish), we first used DeepL (DeepL) and Google Translate (Google LLC) and then asked native speakers involved in the Contracts2.0-project to check if we understood the information correctly. Whenever possible, the completed data matrix was again reviewed by an expert involved in the contract to verify entered data and close last data gaps.\n\nMethods and materials used for the third step in our experimental design: Based on the information already retrieved for variables no. 9, 11, 13, 15, and 32 (cf. data file: contracts_x_variables_[matrix].xlsx), asking about the involved contracted party (variables no. 9 and 11), the contracting party (variable no. 13), as well as any other third parties or intermediaries involved (variable no. 15), and which party specifically was responsible for the monitoring (variable no. 32), we looked for additional information explaining what roles exactly each actor performed in contract governance. For the assignment of roles, we started with the list of 12 governance tasks identified by Westerink and others [8] for collective agri-environmental and climate schemes. But whenever the description of an actor suggested a new role, we created a new column and reviewed the cases already analyzed once again, if this new role also applied to the involved actors there. Alongside the analysis we elaborated a description of each role (cf. data file: roles_descriptions.xlsx). When possible, we consulted again an expert directly involved in the contracts to verify the information and to make additions or corrections if they felt something was not yet accurate.\n\nFor the documentation and visualization of the results, we used Excel and Word (both Microsoft), Tableau Public (Salesforce), ArcGIS (ESRI), and Chordial (Gumroad)."
