        "text": "A self-refuting argument\n\n“That it afforded a measure of justification to the free activities of the individual capitalist, attracted to it the support of the dominant social force behind authority.”\n\nWhile the general reader may be most interested in this article of Professor Galbraith’s for its review of some of the economic thinking that’s out there that has a better handle on our current economic crisis than the conventional thinking, the main thrust seems actually to be that these economists labor in undeserved obscurity, and that perhaps if that injustice were corrected, society might be guided by better economic thinking. This item seems to be part of a series about progressives in academia.\n\nI can’t help but think that obscurity probably has considerable survival value for someone who holds these views, and also works at UT, especially, and really, any place in academia. The dominant social force behind authority, both public and the sort of private authority with enough money behind it to run a university, is indeed the individual capitalist. It goes without saying that an institution that funds itself off of an endowment will defend the investments that are its lifeblood. In this era of the 401K, that rubric would include just about everyone who bothers to vote, so even insofar as we actually are still a democracy, even the demos has tied its interests to the capitalists, to roll themselves into one grand and inglorious “investor class”. And that investor class funds public universities. Only obscurity, only the fact that obscurity keeps the folks in charge from noticing this trahison des clercs, is keeping the scholars Galbraith lists from, at the least, being ridden out of town on a rail, and at worst, being burned at the stake.\n\nIt’s all well and good to talk about sending banksters to jail where they belong, as Galbraith does towards the end. But for now, and until and unless there is a radical change in the dominant authority, the actual arrangment is that the jailers work for the banksters. And that arrangement holds not just for literal prisons, but also for the jailers of thought, the people who determine what thinking is let loose on society, and what gets held closely in some dungeon. The economists who have it right aren’t getting out of Siberia until after the revolution, they’re not going to cause the revolution.\n\nthe very many economists who are sincerely trying to understand the economy the best way they know how\n\nnah. Not buying it. I think that the killer point here is the objection made by (I think) John Emerson in this comments section, which went:\n\nIf you were someone wanting to commission a piece of sloppy, fallacious, politically slanted research in history, biology, sociology or nearly any other subject, you would be picking it up from the dregs of academia – third or fourth tier universities on the margins of accreditation. If, on the other hand, you wanted a piece of research in economics that ignored obvious facts, made elementary logical and mathematical errors and clearly slanted itself in favour of a particular point of view, then you could commission it from the very best-regarded universities in the world, with Nobel Laureates and John Bates Clark medallists to choose from.\n\nThis is a sign that there is something terribly, horribly wrong with academic economics, and looking away from it isn’t going to make it go away. Even the “good” economists you’re referring to (who I very much doubt whether they form a majority) aren’t actually helping because they absolutely refuse to police their profession – DeLong and Krugman noted with alarm that Cochrane, Fama and Mankiw were spouting politically motivated crap a year ago, but now they’re all mates again. And then there are people like Martin Feldstein, who really does not seem to have any concern about being wrong on subjects like Social Security privatisation, which he was apparently pushing once more at the AEA meetings.\n\nGlen: “. It goes without saying that an institution that funds itself off of an endowment will defend the investments that are its lifeblood. In this era of the 401K, that rubric would include just about everyone who bothers to vote, so even insofar as we actually are still a democracy, even the demos has tied its interests to the capitalists, to roll themselves into one grand and inglorious â€œinvestor class”.\n\nIncorrect. I don’t have the figures available, but last I heard, most Americans don’t have any direct or indirect investment in the stock market – remember, more Americans don’t have pensions, and most don’t have 401K’s. Of those that do, most have somewhere around ‘not enough to matter’; a few months of unemployment would drain those investements, even if the stock market wasn’t down at the time due to a recession. And in the current situation, of course, we have a combination of a reduced stock market + high unemployment + high long-term unemployment.\n\nI recall seeing some figures from the late 90’s which put it at 50% of Americans having *any* money in the stock market, direct or indirect, and the median amount for those who did was ~$5,000.\n\nIn short, the stock market doesn’t affect most Americans except through the job market.\n\nNow, one wouldn’t know that from hearing the US mass media, but that’s the point, isn’t it? The MSM tends to reflect the interests of the economic elites more than the rest of us.\n\nI’m not looking away from it, I’m disagreeing with you.\n\nI do not share your remarkable ability to know when Cochrane, Fama and Mankiw are spouting politically motivated crap, as opposed to just getting things wrong and/or having political views that I do not share, and I believe some people have accused De Long and Krugman of spouting politically motivated crap from time to time too. And I do not think Cochrane, Fama and Mankiw are representative of the profession (why not pick Rajan, Deaton, Acemoglu, Tirole, Obstfeld, Heckman or some of this lot). I also do not share John Emerson’s remarkable ability to spot these elementary logical and mathematical errors which I gather permeate the thousands of economics journal articles published each year, although I am sure many such errors exist [1]. Sadly, I find economics difficult, and languish in a world where it is hard to identify the right approach to any given question, let alone the right answers. Sure, I have been horrified by some of the things I have read from economist Nobel winners, but I also am horrified by some of the things I read from eminent figures in other fields. I also do not share your ability to tell the difference between the research clearly slanted in favour of a particular point of view and that which merely reaches a particular conclusion. And I’m not sure what these mendacious “points of view” are – I really think I’d struggle to find many journal articles to fit your bill (perhaps you would like me to provide some papers and you could take a quick glance and point out all the errors and “smokescreens for policies which favour the interests of rich and powerful men”). I think that comment from Emerson is really rather silly – let’s actually look at research commissioned from top rank economists – say the Growth Commission – I think there’s some really good work there, but if anywhere is going to contain conclusions tailored to the interests of the rich and powerful, this will surely bit it. Show me.\n\nIn many respects I agree with you … there’s tons about economics which is unsatisfactory, which is another way of saying there’s still lots of work to do, and I agree that sometimes methodology is getting in the way. Not just to do with short-run macro, but all over the place. I just think your picture of mainstream economics and economists is so off beam as to suggest you just don’t know what you are talking about – we could argue about the merits of the actual economic research & theories but you are making assertions about actually existing individuals that could be refuted by meeting them. It’s strange to read such rubbish from somebody who is usually quick to respond sharply to ignorant attacks on say postmodernism or sociology.\n\n[1] I do hope you are not referring to ‘errors’ of the sort that would only have merit if you were meant to take the model as a simulacrum of reality.\n\nBarry,\n\nMost Americans don’t vote. If they did, we’ld be governed by at least Social Democrats, if not plain Socialists, if not Marxists. The Democrats and Republicans, unless they retooled their positions drastically, would be left squabbling over the far right of the electorate, and the far upscale of the electorate. The effect of 95%+ of those eligible to vote actually registering, and then actually voting, would be even more dramatic in key states. Texas would move from being one of the most radically conservative states in the Union, to probably the most radically Socialist. One of the results of such shifts in the composition of the electorate would be that eligibility to vote would be widened, as the folks who would, under this 99%+ turnout regime, would dominate politics, sought to further strengthen that dominance.\n\nAmong those who do vote, holders of 401Ks or some other of the alphabet soup of completely irresponsible govt inducements to pour money into a secondary market, for retirement, or for their children’s education, or folks who are keenly aware that their employer-administered pension fund is stock-market based, make up a clear majority. Nor would I take as indicative of importance to them a median size of “investment” that is low only because it is pulled down by the large numbers of people just starting their college or retirement funds, and who therefore have only small amounts “invested” so far. These people think, and then act, in terms of what they plan to have in the NYSE when they’re age 65, or their kids age 18, not by what’s there now.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare are sometimes referred to as the “third rails” of American politics. While there’s some truth to that idea, the very fact that politicians can refer to these programs that way is an indicator that they are not considered so sacred by so many that this blasphemy is fatal to their political careers. NYSE prices have become the real third rail of American politics. It would be simply unimaginable for a politician to propose any regulatory course of action that would require, encourage, even allow, the DJIA to tumble very far for very long as part of its workings. Concern for the DJIA is one of the factors that makes an institution too big to fail, too big to be allowed to fail without endangering electability. Sure, unemployment isn’t good for electability either, but despite that, our political system seems much readier to let a big employer go under than to let a big pillar of the DOW go under.\n\nActually, the only fact Luis throws out in is comments is about the 401k. Which is interesting. This is a system that, it is estimated, takes in 50 million people – not by any means close to the whole of the American workforce – and includes, in that number, those who have nominal sums invested. Now, why would Luis mention the 401k? Because it was the centerpiece of one of the great projects of the “great moderation’ – to extrude social insurance from the public sphere to the private sphere – privatizing social security, for instance. The design of the 401k was the proto-type of that project.\n\nNow, Luis seems to think that project was a remarkable success.\n\nThere is an economist – one of Galbraith’s ignored – who would beg to differ, Theresa Ghilarducci. Her work has shown that the tax exempt encouragement of 401ks is not only strongly regressive, but encourages what a stream of bad investment – in fact, the kind of misallocation of capital that is the hallmark of the Great Moderation era. Furthermore, the motive for the turn to 401ks was, ultimately, to save firms money on pensions – and on that dimension, it has been an outstanding success. In 2002, Ghilarducci did a study of 827 firms and found that “that 401(k)s allowed employers to reduce pension costs by almost one third. And, if a firm adopted a DC or 401(k) plan between 1981 and 1995 lowered their pension costs per person by about 20%.”.\n\nThis is from Ghildarducci’s testimony before the House last year:\n\nhttp://www.workforce.com/section/00/article/25/94/89.php\n\nGhilarducci testified that â€œthe shift toward 401(k) plans increases tax expenditures, does little to expand retirement savings and favors workers who need the help least.â€\n\nThe â€œshocking resultsâ€ of the 401(k) design, she said in her testimony, are that â€œ6 percent of taxpayers with incomes over $100,000 per year get 50 percent of the tax subsidies.â€\n\nThe promotion of such plans is exactly what James Galbraith is talking about – economists who refuse to recognize that they are advocating agendas that produce negative social benefit for the majority of the people, but benefit, to an extraordinary extent, the wealthiest.\n\nA realistic economics is the study of human frailty not human progress, but economics is defined first as the optimistic study of the stupidity of others, then rationalized into a moral celebration of greed. A disinterested celebration of interested reason?\n\nBut there is no necessary logical relation of technical and moral progress. Increased complexity is just that.\n\nRealism implies a certain cynicism about others, so I was raised to understand greed, but also not to be greedy. That duality is lost on both most economists and most liberals. A history of the modern academy would show that the fixation on money began in the 70’s first with the astronomical rise in salaries of administrators and the concomitant shrinking of the salaries of faculty. It became a scandal decades ago. Then the faculty caught on. The culture of contemporary academia, of professional intellectuals, is one of a neoliberal individualism. That some are paid $150,000 or more to preach against neoliberalism is irrelevant.\n\nThe choice should not be between vulgar determinism and the vulgar denial of what is at the very least a tendency. It’s annoying that all those so fond of the terminology of “memes” aren’t capable of imagining their own fixations as a prime example. A case of determinism for thee but not for me: and subtext is for other people. The “science” of history has been shown to be bunk, unless its the history of the present.\n\nGlen Tomkins 01.04.10 at 4:17 pm\n\nBarry,\n\n“Most Americans donâ€™t vote. If they did, weâ€™ld be governed by at least Social Democrats, if not plain Socialists, if not Marxists.

Andrew Gelman (Author of ‘Rich State Poor State, Red State Blue State’) once posted a map showing the electoral vote breakdown by the thirdtiles (?) of the income distruction. For the bottom third, the map is almos pure blue. For the middle third, mostly blue – for the top third, mostly red.\n\n“Among those who do vote, holders of 401Ks or some other of the alphabet soup of completely irresponsible govt inducements to pour money into a secondary market, for retirement, or for their childrenâ€™s education, or folks who are keenly aware that their employer-administered pension fund is stock-market based, make up a clear majority. ”\n\nNow this I’ll disagree with. And (anticipating what comes later), I’ll strongly disagree that the majority of voters have (or rather had) a 401(k) balance worth more than 2-3 months’ income. Which meant that a layoff would be infinitely more punishing than a total loss of their 401(k).\n\n“Nor would I take as indicative of importance to them a median size of â€œinvestmentâ€ that is low only because it is pulled down by the large numbers of people just starting their college or retirement funds, and who therefore have only small amounts â€œinvestedâ€ so far. These people think, and then act, in terms of what they plan to have in the NYSE when theyâ€™re age 65, or their kids age 18, not by whatâ€™s there now.”\n\nI agree that most Americans vote as if they had a better chance to be rich than they do, but I disagree with this. Particularly as voting is positively correlated with age, which means that there is a high percentage of voters who are middle-aged or older, and should have few illusions about their late-life wealth than a 20-something just out of college.\n\n“Social Security and Medicare are sometimes referred to as the â€œthird railsâ€ of American politics. While thereâ€™s some truth to that idea, the very fact that politicians can refer to these programs that way is an indicator that they are not considered so sacred by so many that this blasphemy is fatal to their political careers. ”\n\nNah, it says ‘touch and die’. And US politics fits this reasonably well – SS is being looted, but very indirectly.\n\n“NYSE prices have become the real third rail of American politics.

(Sperry seems to think the same applies to odd scientific hypotheses like ‘water memory’ – though that’s a bad example because as a non-scientist I’d presume it false – and if I thought it worth bothering to look into, I imagine I would find it had been pretty conclusively discredited – by the orthodox experts in the field.)\n\nAs with other true (or highly credible) quasi-conspiracy theories, a big task is explaining to those who are implicated but not themselves actually self-consciously bent, and to those who know them or respect them, or just assume a general low incidence of corruption, how such a thing can happen without involving weekly meetings of thousands of psychopaths in a vast (smoke-filled, preferably underground) auditorium.\n\nOne mechanism which has effect only once the corruption of the field has been achieved is a ‘self-selection filter’. [Autobiographical illustration: I myself chose to get out of economics (no great loss given my subsequent wastrel life, but it could have been – I was, fwiw described by my economics tutor at a minor Oxford college as the most able student he’d had for years) because I thought there was just too much too radically wrong with what I was being taught. Having drunkenly told a much more junior tutor that it was ‘the son of Satan’s arse and [hyperbole] a subject fit only for imbeciles’ I ended up doing philosophy at London instead, which was easy – apart from the history bits – because I didn’t have to learn and regurgitate stuff I believed to be false and utterly misguided.]\n\nAlso relevant – Jim Harrison @35: Looking at this debate from the side, it seems to me that two separate issues are involved: the shaky foundations of neoclassical economics and the persistent misuse of neoclassical economics to promote the financial and ideological interests of elites.\n\nKind-of, but not really separate in sociological terms – nor enirely separable in theoretical terms. Plenty of feedback from the needs of ideologues to the framing of research projects. And a kind of ‘divide and conquer’ strategy (metaphorical perhaps – I’m describing the phenomena, not leaping to intentional explanations) operates, whereby honest specialists in particular areas of theory can well see that their particular pixel is not the colour it’s (vulgarly) supposed to be, but still the overall picture (i.e. everyone else’s pixels) is assumed to be more or less as advertised.\n\nMainstream economics may turn out to have been more astrology than astronomy all along, but it must be admitted that plenty of orthodox economists oppose the dominant neoliberal political economy without questioning the basic assumptions of their discipline. It may be that all economists are charlatans, but not all charlatans are whores.\n\nSurely sex workers are rarely if ever charlatans, but that bit of prissiness aside, I’d say it’s as above – to get to be an orthodox economist you have to learn – and probably to some degree internalise – the orthodoxy, then you specialise and go off into your Chinese room. To some extent the results you pass back out have to mesh with the generalised body of theory or no-one knows what to do with them.\n\nOf course, plenty of self-aware corruption in pursuit of the usual same-old-same-old money prestige fame etc too, especially clearly among journos etc that are obviously ideologues and obviously paid to be. But that’s not usually the whole story in any quasi-conspiracy. There are plenty of unware participants, cowardly non-blowers of whistles, useful idiots, instinctive self-protectors, ostrich-heads and someone-else’s-problem merchants, as well as the marginalised honest brokers.\n\n[Q: even if one believed straightforward conscious corruption to be the dominant driver behind an observed ‘quasi-conspiracy’, would face-saving, figleafing and other rhetorical considerations make it (a) politic, (b) justifiable to construct just-so stories about (another JKGism) ‘innocent fraud’?]\n\nI don’t think many quasi-conspiracies can be reduced to the classic smoky room scenario, and I think (social) psychology, game theory, history and social sciences, among other disciplines, are all relevant to getting a better understanding of how these phenomena work.\n\nAnyway that’s just my own take – and without projecting any of it on Daniel, I’d still like to say how pleasing it is to hear such forthright sentiment from someone with web-credibility.\n\nRelevant to the above (currently in moderation as a spam-suspect), C.S. Lewis’s The Inner Ring, which I happened to be revisiting only yesterday:\n\nTo nine out of ten of you the choice which could lead to scoundrelism will come, when it does come, in no very dramatic colors. Obviously bad men, obviously threatening or bribing, will almost certainly not appear. Over a drink or a cup of coffee, disguised as a triviality and sandwiched between two jokes, from the lips of a man, or woman, whom you have recently been getting to know rather better and whom you hope to know better still-just at the moment when you are most anxious not to appear crude, or naif, or a prig-the hint will come. It will be the hint of something which is not quite in accordance with the technical rules of fair play: something which the public, the ignorant, romantic public, would never understand: something which even the outsiders in your own profession are apt to make a fuss about: but something, says your new friend, which “we”-and at the word “we” you try not to blush for mere pleasure-something “we always do.” And you will be drawn in, if you are drawn in, not by desire for gain or ease, but simply because at that moment, when the cup was so near your lips, you cannot bear to be thrust back again into the cold outer world. It would be so terrible to see the other man’s face-that genial, confidential, delightfully sophisticated face-turn suddenly cold and contemptuous, to know that you had been tried for the Inner Ring and rejected. And then, if you are drawn in, next week it will be something a little further from the rules, and next year something further still, but all in the jolliest, friendliest spirit. It may end in a crash, a scandal, and penal servitude: it may end in millions, a peerage and giving the prizes at your old school. But you will be a scoundrel.\n\nIt’s not a conspiracy theory. I’ll make my argument one more time and be done with it.\n\nChomsky’s attack on Skinner: Not because he was wrong but because he had to be: because the results were morally offensive. Chomsky attacked not only Skinner but empiricism and has been forced back again and again by the results of experiment and observation and the data that have come from it. His theories are toast: mythologies that he holds onto because for whatever reason he thinks he must. He’s considered the world’s most important intellectual only on account of his empiricism of his reportage. His moral philosophy begins in a Jewish intellectual idealism not unlike the Chicago economists of the same generation.\n\nDonald Davidson: On “Conceptual Schemes”: empirically provable as false. You cannot “translate” Pushkin. Full stop.\n\nThe Trolley Problem: In the search for context-free truths evidence in the history of responses to this problem in actually existing society are ignored. The military is run on utilitarianism to the point where it is the job of some men to decide the fate of others. They are not allowed to even eat at the same table. Friendships, in the strict sense of the term, are forbidden. Common sense morality can be defined as morality among equals. Utilitarianism puts a strain on the community, that can be resolved through use of formal structures. An anthropologist will recognize these roles immediately, but philosophy can not, for reasons that are ideological. There is not “right” answer to the trolley problem.\n\nRawls: Begins with a speculative fiction, the study of which has at the very least slowed us down in our understanding of ourselves. Raymond Geuss seems to have figured that out.\n\nNone of this is first and foremost a conspiracy. But it does become absurd\n\n> [1] Christ, how I hate it when people like Galbraith sanctimoniously\n\n> claim to be the only ones interested in the â€˜realâ€™ economy\n\nThe problem is that it takes 5-10 years at a manufacturing company, as well as some extraordinary hard work and/or clout and/or luck, to work yourself into a position where you start to see how decisions such as capital allocation, personnel management, and pricing are actually made. And in many organizations if you aren’t a member of the “ruling” social class (e.g. white male midwesterner from working class background with engineering degree from one of 20 universities) then you aren’t ever going to get to that point [1]. Whereas getting a PhD in Economics (in the US at least) means going directly from undergraduate to graduate studies and not spending that 5-10 years in an actual living, breathing, messy, theory-ignoring\n\nWhich leads to, e.g. Brad DeLong pontificating about how “firms” make “pricing decisions” without ever having sat in an actual pricing meeting where he would have learned that essentially none of the theoretical models that economists use to discuss pricing are even close to being used, and that those decisions are often made on utterly irrational factors (e.g. dislike of the VP of Sales for the VP of Manufacturing).\n\nCranky\n\n[1] A respected and famous sociologist spent 10 years doing an in-depth study of one firm where I worked. Having read some of the outcomes of that study it is pretty clear to me that in 10 years not a single employee told him or his graduate assistants the truth about anything important. Not one.\n\nJoaquin Tamiroff @68: Itâ€™s not a conspiracy theory.\n\nFirst, I was talking about the OP – on economics – and said it can easily be described as one, not that it is one. In any case, usage of that term is heavily loaded and highly problematic.\n\nI’m not sure what putative phenomenon you are describing exactly, but I agree it doesn’t seem to be on all fours with what I’ve called ‘quasi-conspiracy’ – a superset of ordinary conspiracy – which (as a rough first try) has the elements of (a) undesirable and (b) coordinated/confluent activity on the part of (c) high-status/trusted persons, which (d) has every appearance of subserving an unacknowledged goal.\n\nJust to expand slightly on what I’m getting at (and not addressing JT in particular now): Chomsky is coincidentally relevant – his rather basic ‘propaganda model’ would be one kind of explanation for a quasi-conspiracy. But he plays down actually conspiratorial elements – to the point that he once said ‘who cares’ whether any 9/11 ‘conspiracy theories’ are true (here I am required to add the tiresome and irrelevant disavowal of belief in ‘smoky room’ 9/11 theories). Marxian and other ruling class theories are another, and ‘invisible hand’-type explanations another.\n\nIt’s a rather obviously silly and unnecessary step in such modes of explanation to insist that they are incompatible with explanations in terms of ordinary conspiratorial behaviour: institutional (say) explanations may incorporate conspiratorial elements, e.g. the intentional exercise of proprietorial control over editorial content, which Chomskty treats as a simple mechanism too obvious to analyse: ‘How do corporations control the media? They don’t have to [sic] – they own them’. By not addressing the mixed conspiratorial and merely quasi-conpiratorial mechanisms involed, he ironically enough leaves pure ‘smoky room’ theories as the default interpretation. And in doing that, he tends to alienate anyone who doesn’t think all journalists are craven, corrupt or dishonest enough routinely to go along with being directly ordered to falsify the news.\n\nFurther, conspiracy explanations can be nested inside systems-based ones, and vice versa: e.g. a conspiracy to institute a particular invisible-hand system (it could be a conspiracy of Rawlsians, or of so-called free-market economists: ‘laisser-faire le fait accompli’). Or conversely, an impersonal institutional structure which tends to produce conspiratorial behaviour might be posited. Smith himself, with his ‘conspiracy against the public’ remark, kind-of implied that the invisible hand of capitalism/’laisser-faire’ had an evil (sinister?) twin. And any Marxian scheme which is in the slightest bit fact-sensitive would have to allow that, trapped by historical forces or not, ruling classes do their ruling in conspiratorial ways.\n\nBut instead of such a any mention of the C word elicits howls of ourage or at least disavowal from all quarters however radical, and false dichotomies pop up as numerous and unwonted as Grays in Midwestern bedrooms. (You have to do utterly tedious and unfunny jokes like that too, so everyone knows you are not a Paranoid Cultic Pseudohistorian.) The strange behaviour that tends to be exhibited (and enforced) by most people – more so the more Serious they take themselves to be or are taken to be or want to be taken to be – itself has many of the features of quasi-conspiracy.\n\nWhat a wonderful harvest over one continental night!\n\n61-” Some people choose the former and try to claim them as a model of representation. To go back to an earlier thread, I call that a good description of â€œModernismâ€ – of a specific response to the problem of modernity.”\n\nWay to go Joaquin!, I thought at that time before it got absurd. Economist are indeed the last of the modernists, believing as the most popular do in the final analysis.\n\n63- “and without projecting any of it on Daniel, Iâ€™d still like to say how pleasing it is to hear such forthright sentiment from someone with web-credibility.”\n\nOuch!\n\n66- “The proper place for macro thinking, research, and policy implications is departments of Government, Sociology, and Public Administration.”\n\n& Why is that not the solution? Why not split economics in the way metaphysics was once split – give the honorific older titles to the modernist prophets of macro-tuning (allowing sociologists, anthroplogists etc. in to keep it a little bit sober) – and give the scientists the new field: quantum economics or something.\n\n71- LOL but in a saddish kind of way, it really would be necessary for the science of behaviour in and of organizations to recruit people who have been part of organizations; it maybe is kind of a new anthropological dilemma (soimebody must surely have published on this though?)\n\n74- Jerry, right on! I guess Joaquin means it in the same way one could try to mean that it’s near impossible to translate Shakespeare into English. But that is Davidson’s point – there are neither many nor a single one conceptual scheme.\n\nAre you, by the way, related to the cyclist? To write the story of his life is something that needs to be done.\n\n74- Jerry, right on! I guess Joaquin means it in the same way one could try to mean that itâ€™s near impossible to translate Shakespeare into English. But that is Davidsonâ€™s point â€“ there are neither many nor a single one conceptual scheme.\n\nWell, I was vaguely familiar with Davidson’s ideas on conceptual schemes (bear with me, I’m an amateur philosopher in time spent away from physics) but I just went back to read “On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme,” and while I saw some things in there that made me raise my eyebrows, the notion that something can be translated between languages doesn’t seem all that controversial to me. More than that, it doesn’t seem to me that Davidson is using the word “translate” in any different sense than one would be using it if one were, you know, actually translating something. I can understand the argument that the poetic sense of Pushkin is untranslatable into English (although I would disagree; Pushkin certainly thought that the poetic sense of Byron was translatable into Russian and I find myself convinced by his efforts) but that isn’t the argument Davidson is making.\n\nAre you, by the way, related to the cyclist? To write the story of his life is something that needs to be done.\n\nHeh, you and the Czech railway conductors both want to know (I was asked this question when traveling in Europe a few years ago). The answer is: not that I know of. I don’t think my last name is all that common so I was kind of surprised to find a somewhat-famous person with it. However, when I asked my dad, he said that he was not aware of any Kazakh-based relations. I suspect it’s not impossible that we have a common ancestor in our recent past, but there’s no immediate relation.\n\nI’d add that I’m an admirer of Chomsky’s political work in general; this is a minor niggle in the scheme of things. One may well think it’s not his job to provide such explanations, or that there is no need for them except as just-so-stories to persuade the naive and undercut the disingenuous, and one may be right. But I do think Chomsky does, understandably, err on the side of knee-jerk anti-conspiratorialism. His co-author addresses some quasi-conspiratorial aspects here, but those themes aren’t really addressed in MC.\n\nChomsky does deal with this kind of thing occasionally, e.g. in the 2nd excerpt here. Problem is I think this kind of stuff is much more important in rhetorical terms than Chomsky acknowledges. The introduction of new terms and catchphrases would be one way for the concepts involved to gain currency in popular discourse: imagine if a term as successful as ‘passive-aggressive’, say, were developed to illustrate and encapsulate the phenomena involved…\n\nNot that I’m blaming Chomsky for not doing that. But I do think that he unfairly derides those he regards as chasing irrelevant ‘conspiracy theories’ – a constituency he should be courting and moderating. He thinks that ‘conspiracy theories’ are a distraction. That’s hardly surprising since he defines conspiracy as something abnormal:\n\nall decisions involve people. So the real question is, are there groupings well outside the structures of the major institutions of society which go around them, hijack them, undermine them, pursue other courses without an institutional base, and so on and so forth? And that’s a question of fact[NB not merely of mood music]: do significant things happen because groups or subgroups are acting in secret outside the main structures of institutional power? (Understanding Power, p. 348)\n\nNow given Chomsky’s positive analysis of power institutions, that means ‘conspiracy theories’ are almost automatically of no more than marginal interest, because they are anomalous. So far, so definitional, but it’s not as simple as that because in this area, (re)definitions have a way of being transmuted into substantive theses. Chomsky goes on to say that, insofar as the CIA is just an agency of the White House (and he says it pretty straightforwardly is), whatever it gets up to is not a ‘conspiracy’. Then he goes into full anti-conspiratorial smear mode as he dismisses the “Kennedy-assassination cult”.\n\nDonald Johnson @105: no, ajay is right. Chomsky seems to say that if the CIA have authorisation from the White House, then whatever they are doing is no longer to be counted as conspiratorial, including cases in which ‘plausible deniability’ is sought. In what interesting sense of ‘conspiratorial’ is that the case? You are putting a lot of weight on ajay’s use of the word ‘legitimate’ in ‘legitimate parts of their jobs’.\n\nHere’s the passage:\n\nIf you look at the place where investigation of “conspiracies” has absolutely flourished, modern American history, [not ancient or renaissance Rome or Florence, etc etc etc etc: plots from long ago or far way aren’t “conspiracies”, see] I think what’s notable is the absence of such cases- at least as I read the record, they almost never happen. I mean, occasionally you’ll find something like the Reaganites, with their off-the-shelf subversive and terrorist activities, but that was sort of a fringe operation – and in fact, part of the reason why a lot of it got exposed so quickly is because the institutions are simply too powerful to tolerate much of that stuff. As far as the Pentagon goes, sure the Services will push their interests-but typically they do it in pretty transparent ways.\n\nOr take the CIA, which is considered the source of a lot of these conspiracies; we have a ton of information about it, and as I read the information, the C.I.A. is basically just an obedient branch of the White House. I mean sure, the C.I.A. has done things around the world- but as far as we know, it hasn’t done anything on its own. There’s very little evidence-in fact, I don’t know of any-that the C.I.A. is some kind of rogue elephant, you know, off on its own doing things. What the record shows is that the C.I.A. is just an agency of the White House, which sometimes carries out operations for which the Executive branch wants what’s called “plausible deniability”; in other words, if something goes wrong, we don’t want it to look like we did, those guys in the C.I.A. did it, and we can throw some of them to the wolves if we need to. That’s basically the role of the C.I.A., along with mostly just collection of information.\n\nIt’s the same with the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, all these other things the people are racing around searching for conspiracy theories about-they’re “nothing” organizations. Of course they’re there, obviously rich people get together and talk to each other, and play golf with one another, and plan together-that’s not a big surprise. But these conspiracy theories people are putting their energies into have virtually nothing to do with the way the institutions actually function.\n\nIt doesn’t happen; not as far as I know; hardly ever; not typically; not without being blown wide open; only as a ‘fringe’ activity; not without proper authorisation; it’s not a big surprise. Note the Reaganites are mentioned as examples of conspiratorial activity. Chomsky is, uniquely on this topic, floundering a bit and even inconsistent, and it’s because he wants to insist on a dichotomy between his own systems analysis and vulgar ones that consider individual motives and behaviour, a dichotomy that isn’t really sustainable.\n\nJerry Vinokurov @111: I don’t think 9/11 conspiracy theories, or the ones I have come across, are ‘totalising’ in any sense I can formulate. The appropriate grounds for criticising them are the same as for any other, less extreme, allegation of covert action. I don’t think there is a difference in kind, only degree, however concvenient it might be to have an overarching generalised refutation. As to the reading in terms of confluence v contrivance, I don’t see that in what Chomsky wrote. I certainly don’t think that as a matter of fact actual quasi-conspiracies can usually be reduced without remainder to one or the other category.\n\nLikewise to Henri @112 – I quite agree. I’m using ‘falsify’ in an objective sense – consistent with either aware or unaware corruption (or, as in most cases, a mixture of varying proportions and degrees of each). I’ve perhaps been a bit imprecise once or twice in using ‘conspiratorial’ when I should have said ‘quasi-conspiratorial’ but I think this was clear enough overall:\n\ninstitutional (say) explanations may incorporate conspiratorial [this is the one which perhaps s/b ‘quasi-conspiratorial’] elements, e.g. the intentional exercise of proprietorial control over editorial content, which Chomsky treats as a simple mechanism too obvious to analyse: â€˜How do corporations control the media? They donâ€™t have to [sic] â€“ they own themâ€™. By not addressing the mixed conspiratorial and merely quasi-conspiratorial mechanisms involved, he ironically enough leaves pure â€˜smoky roomâ€™ theories as the default interpretation.[but that last bit makes it pretty clear]\n\nThe same applies to my response to geo @110. Perhaps those could be seen as climbdowns (more the latter than the former, and I think because the earlier imprecision got me somewhere I hadn’t planned to be and didn’t properly stop to reconsider) in which case, and to which extent, thanks for talking me down while I had only one knee-jerkingly defensive foot on the bottom rung. On the other hand, perhaps I’m being overmodest there: insofar as the control is intentional (and Chomsky’s model does regard it as such), then at least the proprietor is acting ‘conspiratorially’ – after all, it’s perhapsnot really germane that there might be only one person involved – the main point of interest is the secret corrupt behaviour, not the numbers. In any case, I shall certainly continue to mull this stuff over.\n\nCouple of last thoughts – In some cases it’s probably not even possible to disentangle deliberate from subconscious or self-deceiving corruption in – at least not without peering into peoples’ heads – and on some views, there may in those cases not even be a determinate fact of the matter. But as Henri acknowledges, sometimes direct and explicit pressure is brought to bear in such a way that co-operation couldn’t possibly be seen as innocent. One is not likely to find out about those unless one happens to be interested enough to look into it and come across the rare case in which such pressure has been resisted, and the resistance made ‘public’. (Incidentally, ‘adversarial’ or ‘opposed’ epistemology, involving situations in which there is reason to think one’s attempts to find things out are being or will be frustrated, would be an interesting field…I’m sure everyone can agree that there are such situations.)\n\nI do think Chomsky is rightly concerned that people may be distracted by personalities to the exclusion of considering the overall system in which they operate – and I agree they might, and do. But I also think that if that’s his concern, he overcompensates for it. And again, I didn’t especially want to focus on Chomsky and certainly not to exaggerate the degree to which he goes off-course.\n\nAnyway, I hadn’t intended to monopolise the thread. Thanks for responses to my somewhat underdeveloped musings.\n\nEnvoi\n\n(Can’t resist)\n\nThe funny thing is that when the C word isn’t lurking around casting its malign influence over proceedings, Chomsky is entirely reasonable on such topics. Conspiracy theories are bad, m’kay, so Chommers populates the category with bad and silly things: irrelevances, rogue units, one-offs.\n\nAt the other extreme, though Chomsky doesn’t tend to mention it much, is the classic strawman of the eternal, all-powerful, omniscient, centralised, single-minded, inhumanly evil controlling force. (‘There is no all-powerful conspiracy!’ that is the cry of the running dogs of ponero-plutocracy.)\n\nThe idea of reasonably cohesive money interests having the power to tightly constrain and even direct what the politicians do, which in turn involves all sorts of secretive and illegal activity up to and including domestic assassinations, isn’t a conspiracy theory, because it’s not silly. (And if the White House doesn’t want to know – or need to know – about some particular project, then I’m sure that isn’t enough to tip such activity into the ‘conspiracy’ bucket either.)\n\nAnd that’s not just a matter of ‘mood music’. Chomsky’s understandably unwilling to be associated with various strange ideas about aliens etc – which get called ‘CTs’ becuase they involve government coverups, even though such rudimentarily conspiratorial aspects are, shall we say, not the most arresting features of such beliefs. So he repudiates ‘conspiracy theories’ by applying that term in an idiosyncratic way. But having done so, he contributes to the taboo, intellectually ghettoised status of anything so-labelled whether or not it falls under Chomsky’s odd and unclear conception.\n\nOn Watergate, for example, he says that Nixon was taken down by the powers that be, and this is unremarkable, part of the normal operation of power institutions – not conspiracy theory material. Meanwhile he points out that the real story was Cointelpro, which involved burglaries, intimidation, organising riots, ‘gestapo-style assassination’, etc, and had been going on under successive changes of administration. That is exactly the kind of thing that (the less outré) ‘conspiracy theory’ websites are mainly interested in, and so they bloody well should be. But I suppose to Chomsky they don’t count as ‘conspiracies’.\n\nAnyone who thinks they do, however sane, reasonable, scrupulous and thoughtful, is outside the pale with the logo-analysers, the Freudian-slip watchers, the occultists, anti-semites, alien-spotters that are among the predictably superstitious manifestations of a lack of control and knowledge among a baffled and buffeted populace. And that phenomenon has the features of quasi-conspiracy, too.\n\nBut anyway: economists, quasi-conspiracy and information cascades…\n\n#120: It’s an irrelevant claim to fixate on. He is having it both ways; he’s also flagging which way he prefers in the case of ‘rogue CIA’ scenarios (MKULTRA – going by what we can tell from such records as weren’t destroyed – seems not to have been authorised. But then that involved the army, too, and no doubt a ‘plausible deniability’ hypothesis, or unsubversiveness relative to Executive aims, or failure to be sufficently spectacular, or – cheekily – insufficiently hermetic secrecy, or something, can be invoked to save the hypothesis.)\n\nBut I’m not going to follow your example and repeat myself, Donald, if I may reciprocally patronise a second time. (This really is heavy patronisation territory isn’t it.)\n\n#121: Let’s say, incredibly, that evidence were now unearthed that the CIA killed JFK (and – yawn – I’m not saying they did). I don’t think Chomsky would take it to refute his position.\n\nSuch an event might be like the case of Nixon in the Watergate link above (also featured in slightly different form in the same book, Understanding Power, pp117 ff): Watergate is a very clear example of what happens to servants when they forget their role and go after the people who own the place: they are very quickly put back into their box, and somebody else takes over.\n\nAlternatively, and still sticking to what Chomsky says in the same section of Understanding Power, it might be a ‘blip on the screen’ (i.e. we’re not going to learn anything about the world from it, at least nothing that generalises to the next case), as he described – with some justice given the, er, extraordinary circumstances – the generals’ conspiracy to kill Hitler. This is similar to his “even if it were true, who cares? It doesn’t have any significance” remark about of 9/11 ‘inside job’ theories (see previous disclaimers). Note also that on his prveiously examined view – and undercutting the ‘blip’ rationale for not caring – a “Bush done it” theory wouldn’t be a conspiracy theory at all (though it would be particularly ridiculous, of course, simply on the basis that Bush couldn’t organise a cutlery drawer.)\n\nOr it could be like the MLK assassination, of which in the same section he says:\n\nthat’s the one case where you can imagine pretty plausible reasons why people would have wanted to kill him*, and I would not be in the least surprised if there in fact was a real conspiracy behind that one, probably a high-level conspiracy. I mea the mechanisms were there,[?] maybe they would have hired the Mafia or something to do it – but that conspiracy theory is perfectly plausible, I think.\n\n[*note the top-down approach, often characterised as ‘conspiratorial’ (except here it’s nemini bono).]\n\nIt’s not clear if he thinks this is another blip on the screen, or a normal operation of power institutions, or what, but either way, it is a conspiracy theory and it is one he endorses, and endorses as a conspiracy theory. Now you can if you like try and two-step between that and the stuff on the previous page rubbishing ‘conspiracy theories’, but I think it would be better to accept that there is something wrong with what C is saying on the topic somewhere along the line.\n\nNice use of the ‘conspiracist’ label by the way. Given Chomsky’s MLK views, you had now better decide whether he is a conspiracist too, or whether you are applying that label on the basis of a substantive generalisation about everyone who gives substantial credence to the possibility of CIA involvement in the murder of JFK.\n\n(Anyway, back to explanations of the uncoordinated emergence of ideologically-orientated economic theory, anyone?)\n\ngeo: yes, v interesting.\n\nI’d say the element of some kind of wrongdoing is pretty fixed, and usually – but not necessarily (for example when theories are conjured up about ‘imputation of agency’ etc) – co-operation of multiple actors. But in the context of ‘conspiracy theory’, it must be one of the most heavily loaded and widely abused words around.\n\nFor example, ‘conspiracy theory’ may not apply to plot theses in (distant) history, or it may only apply to PTs involving the govt of one’s own country, or by extension those in other authority roles, or by a different extension those whom one -can- should be able to trust, or it may be taken to imply that since it’s a ‘theory’ it must be unconfirmed, unconfirmable, or just false, or it may only be used to indicate views which are surprising, implausible, ‘paranoid’ or silly or in some other way – often easily diagnosable or characterisable – defective, or perhaps most insidiously it may be applied to beliefs not themselves conspiratorial but which would if accepted tend to suggest a conspiracy (‘that man has three knives in his back’).\n\nOr as with Chomsky – it may only apply to conspiracies against – or less restrictively but more arbitrarily, bypassing – the government.\n\nAnd the application conditions and the inferential role of the term commonly, and conveniently – if that isn’t too stylistically paranoid a term – come apart, adverting to disparate conceptions of the core concept (if it is even unitary enough to be called that). So, for example: X is a theory about a conspiracy (in a fairly straightforward compositional sense of fairly straightforward senses of ‘conspiracy’ + ‘theory’), therefore it is a conspiracy theory, therefore it is a certain kind of confabulation. Obviously not as explicit as that, but often not far off. Google News is full of it.\n\nHenri @129: Yes, I think that is the best sense that can be made of Chomsky’s position. As mentioned, I tend to share his view in general, but the only non-conspiratorial act would be to relinquish the power, to self-destruct doesn’t seem to me to be adequate.\n\nAfter all, he says that certain kinds of hypotheses are distinguishable as ‘conspiracy theories’, and memberhip of that category seems really to depend on standard incidents such as murderousness, lower than normal visibility, ad-hoc outsourcing, etc. Far from being indispensable, those are considered ‘optional extras’, even when they don’t run counter to the dominant plutocratic power structures, or even are an informal or White-House-bypassing manifestation of it.\n\nHe also singles out certain specific views which he happens to disagree with for no very good reason – such as that of the unitary ‘JFK conspiracy cult’ – which would appear to include anyone who gives balance-of-probabilities credence to any possibility other than the ‘lone nut’ thesis – which would include the House Committee on Assassinations, and various other non-cultic types, including some ‘web-credible’ commentators I could mention.\n\nInsofar as what is known as conspiratorial or ‘deep’ politics (or as ‘parapolitics’ – unfortunately, given stereotypically ‘conspiratorial’ tropes such as ‘paranoia’, ‘paranormal’, ‘parapsychology’) is part of the operation of de facto power structures, he owes an account of why he dismisses (anyone else’s) discussion of it – at least when speaking in general terms.\n\nIf the reason for doing so is to avoid focusing on the intractable, dubious or disreputable, then it would be better if Chomsky were either to make it clear that he is stipulating that only the intractable, dubious or disreputable count as ‘conspiracy theories’, or to give sustainable reasons for assuming all ‘conspiracy theories’, less tendentiously defined, to be intractable, dubious or disreputable.\n\n[Warning – if you don’t like leaden and longwinded irony you won’t be very keen on the following break from laboured earnestness.]\n\nCranky Observer @128 says:\n\nCheney managed to build a secret office, create a â€œ4th branch of [US] governmentâ€, and presumably use that office to take actions the to this day have Republicans, the press, and most Democrats cowering in fear and refusing to criticize or even discuss Cheney. And he kept it secret for 8 years in Washington DC, the most gossip-riven town in the world.\n\nChomsky says:\n\nJust another blip, or perhaps business as usual – in either case, uninteresting compared to endless detailed and specific analysis of biased press coverage. I think you’ll find that particular situations, often in the present or recent past, are not really representative of the general run of things. And when they are they’re unremarkable.\n\nThe MSM says:\n\nTaking a broad view and putting any actual evidence into a wider perspective, it’s evident that the picture you are painting is a typical cultic conspiracy theory. Everyone knows the blogs are full of those, not like the much more credible, er, MSM.\n\nAnd you’re wrong, I’m sure, about these supposed ‘secrets’ (yeah right – secrets, but you -know them- know about them, do you? Fantasist! Liar! Troublemaker! Supercilous self-aggrandiser! Comfort/thrill-seeker! Er, racist!).\n\nThe fact of the matter is, no-one ever keeps secrets, and people who are involved in – or who suspect or discover themselves to be implicated in – powerful, corrupt, ruthless and illegal groups generally can’t wait to tell all – preferably in unambiguous terms, attributably, on the record. Failing that, they certainly love to devastate their mourning relatives with the well-known phenomenon of “deathbed confessions” – though not the kind that is said to a priest – they just can’t be relied on to publicise such stuff properly.\n\nHushing things up, you see, is not a matter in which there is any leeway or room for error. It is like trying to plug holes in a balloon, not a box. Truth is always recognised as such, and never contested. It spreads irresistably and exponentially, even when based on unattributed, partial or unsubstantiated evidence. It is always reported in detail, investigated and tested impartially and in full public view, and then officially endorsed. Incriminating evidence is never contradicted, and those who give it never retaliated against, marginalised, ruined, persecuted, driven to penury or to assisted or unassisted insanity, or anything like that. If that sort of thing happened it would be all over the papers, wouldn’t it.\n\nAnd there would have to have been hundreds, probably thousands, of people involved, all of whom would have access to top-level strategy, on the well known ‘fuck it – you may as well know’ basis. Where are all those whistleblowers?\n\nName one credible conspiracy theory for which, er, credible evidence hasn’t come out. The fact is these things always come out in the end. (Small print: after about 40 years when everyone of any seniority is dead, any documents which haven’t been destroyed may be declassified with appropriate redactions. After about another fifty or so, established historians will have a look at those documents and the contemporary newspapers, and start drafting some tentative conclusions.)\n\nIt’s good to wait a long time for all the facts to become clear and organise themselves. Otherwise the ‘fog of war’ tends to obscure the overall narrative – and individual, caught-up-in-the-moment, witnesses who don’t have the whole story might find their initial reports taken at face value.\n\nOnce they’ve had time to consider their memories in the round and let their perceptions settle down from their initial confused and unclear state, witnesses often retract their initial reports, or anyway say something which has many of the features of a retraction, like: “Well, I wish I hadn’t said that. I didn’t think I would get all this attention, anyway it’s been pointed out that my observation might be taken to imply that [something I have no way of knowing anything about happened], and I didn’t say that, and I don’t think it did happen, and I don’t want my statement to be used to imply that, and my words have been twisted, and I don’t want to talk about it any more”, which is just as good.\n\nAnd anyway, the whole structure, approach, method, motive and er, spelling of your crazed theory is unsound. To see this, preserve the structure, but change, say ’40’ to ‘two milion’, ‘Cheney’ to ‘the Elders of Zion’, ‘Office of the Vice President’ to ‘secret ungerdround alien army’, and â€œ4th branch of [US] governmentâ€ to ‘sepurnatural all-konwing unspeakably evil wolrd-dictatorship’ . In principle, it is exactly the same theory, but you wouldn’t endorse that, would you?\n\nTim Wilkinson:\n\nI think Henri Vieuxtemps nailed an important part of Chomsky’s view, and I don’t quite understand why you took issue with what he contributed.\n\nChomsky’s position, as you describe it, raises some important questions, for me at least. Is it possible that the term “conspiracy theory” as ordinarily used is used incorrectly? When someone is “owned” by the powers-that-be, does he consciously conform his activities to the head honcho’s wishes, or to those of some intermediate person? If I understand him correctly, he not only doesn’t have answers to those questions, he would find the questions themselves misguided.\n\nI’m not entirely clear on how Chomsky’s idea of the “deep structure” of an utterance, at the detailed level of the theory, is supposed to be like the “structure” of structuralism, but I assume the identity of language is significant. I assume as well that the LAD or Language Acquisition Device in the mind of every human being is connected with the idea of structuralism. This structure is not the same as a mental representation, conceived as a computer scientist would conceive of such a thing; a huge issue in cognitive science has been whether mental representations exist or whether they’re an unnecessary hypothesis–the natural way for a computer scientist to think of such a representation can be seen by opening up the source code for WordPress and asking whether the first variable you see “exists”–on a physical level, it can indeed be said to exist, but at the same time, it can be said not to exist in the same way an atom in my laptop’s keyboard exists. Which is just prelude to indicate that Chomsky is probably not thinking in computer science terms (in case there was still any doubt). The question still remains of the relationship between the deep structure and the LAD, which to the best of my knowledge is an issue Chomsky has not ever addressed; he has elaborated and re-elaborated the formal parts of his logical-mathematical theory of language in order to counter particular criticisms and to accomplish new goals that appeared worth taking into account.\n\nWhich is just prelude to say that his linguistic and psychological theories have no evident connection with his views on politics.\n\nbianca steele @132\n\nHenri Vieuxtemps nailed an important part of Chomskyâ€™s view, and I donâ€™t quite understand why you took issue with what he contributed\n\nWell, I didn’t take issue with his description of Chomsky’s (headline) position; I was more saying that it’s not the whole story and doesn’t address my issues with C’s views on the topic of ‘conspiracy theories’, explicitly-so-called, which are really just a very moderate version of the general problems that infest any discussion involving that phrase.\n\nhis linguistic and psychological theories have no evident connection with his views on politics.\n\nI would assume the same. I didn’t – and don’t – intend to go anywhere near such topics if I can possibly avoid it.\n\nChomskyâ€™s position, as you describe it, raises some important questions, for me at least\n\nGood – it’s gratifying and encouraging to hear it.\n\nIs it possible that the term â€œconspiracy theoryâ€ as ordinarily used is used incorrectly?\n\nI think that kind of question might indeed in favourable cases be silly or even senseless, like ‘is everyone out of step?’, but in this case it’s more a case of being totally broken, with usage shifting in the space of a single sentence, laden with (often unacknowledged) evaluative baggage, and with talking at cross-purposes (sometimes disingeniously) the norm.\n\nWhen someone is â€œownedâ€ by the powers-that-be, does he consciously conform his activities to the head honchoâ€™s wishes or to those of some intermediate person?\n\nThat’s a yes-or-no question rather than a choice of two specific alternatives, correct? I don’t think that can (or should) be seen as a senseless question – perhaps slightly stylised, but you got to start somewhere.\n\nThat is my other criticism, a softish one: that Chomsky pays insufficient attention (for my liking) to that kind of issue – and that not dealing with it in more depth means that lots of ‘ordinary’ people won’t even consider his points, because (among other reasons like the constant campaign to keep him outside the pale) it just sounds implausible to them that all those presentable, serious, high-status, professional journalists routinely falsify and twist the news just because they are paid to. In fact such a view presented so baldly and cursorily might be (and is) described as a ‘conspiracy theory’, at which point all is lost and he might as well be talking about shape-shifting reptiles.\n\n[FWIW, a few more baby-steps toward a General Theory of Conspiracy Theories, offered in a spirit of take-it-or-ignore-it]\n\nSubstance McG @137: â€œThe president is a secret Muslimâ€ is popular now.\n\nnugatory conspiracy theories\n\nIndeed, though â€œThe president is a secret Muslimâ€ isn’t much of a conspiracy theory is it – unless he is supposed to have some fiendish Islamic plan going (or if the claim is that he’s a practising, ‘organised’ muslim, which claim would exhibit one of the supposed incidents of ‘conspiracy theories’, viz. positing an implausible secrecy).\n\nA bit like the ‘Birther’ stuff – I mean, it’s a nasty rumour cooked up for political smear purposes and unsupported by any evidence, and that’s what wrong with it – not really that it has some supposed general features shared by all ‘conspiracy theories’ which make it inherently ridiculous or implausible. It isn’t implausible that a parent might falsify her infant son’s birthplace in order to secure him citizenship, nor that the son (possibly, one supposes, in this hypothetical situation, ignorant about the circumstances of his birth) might try and pursue some career, even one which absolutely requires US birth. Politicians may have skeletons in their cupboards like anyone else.\n\nBeing a secret (informal) muslim would be similar – it wouldn’t have been such a very huge issue had the GWOT not come along, and by then what would our imaginary muslim do? Throw in the towel? (More disclaiming, if required – I don’t suggest either thesis merits more than vanishingly small credence – enough to prevent !DIV/0# errors propagating through the notional Bayesian spreadsheet…)\n\nagent-based theories\n\nMaybe a distinguishable species of ‘CT’, which is based primarily on a person or organisation and which doesn’t really get round to specifying what actual nefarious actions are involved or planned. Also an element of ‘mood music’ as in Daniel’s earlier thread (the one predictably dominated by postmodernological disputes).\n\nA small number of examples in the link @ 141 fall into the ‘agent-based’ or (not necessarily the same) ‘mood-music’ category – e.g. the usual underspecified Illumi-bloody-nati, Bohemian Owl, Trilateral comm, Bilderberg etc., and especially the ‘New World Order’ gubbins.\n\nHaving said that, there is perhaps something prima facie slightly suspect in itself about secret/secretive organisations – assuming one starts from a critical perspective. And worth remembering that, for example, Bilderberg’s secrecy was much greater to start with, and has only peeled away gradually, and largely through the activities of ‘conspiracy theorists’: first its existence, then its meetings, then to some extent its membership. But never, of course, exactly what is planned (it surely ain’t about golf), nor the power dynamics of such planning – it remains semi-clandestine and protected in part by general aversion to ‘conspiratorial’ talk.\n\nmood music\n\nBut what might appear to be a ‘mood music’ (subjective) element is sometimes, I think, fairly tractable. The New World Order business, for example, is just the kind of thing that merits Chomsky’s asperity. Hugely vague umbrella term, fixating on vocab, no very specific claims about actual covert activity – certainly not backed with evidence – a big distraction, and quite irritating. It’s a pretty nugatory theory in terms of definite content. Less ‘mood music’; more like a substantial failure – failure to come up with anything substantial.\n\nTaking Bilderberg again, the perceived mood music element may be partly a matter of how plausible it is that there’s something (fairly obviously) dodgy going on, like bankers crowning party leaders – or even election winners – or handing out orders, possibly illegal or murderous ones. Assessing such plausbility is a ‘subjective’ judgement only in the sense that there aren’t very clear criteria, nor much evidence, for adjudicating disagreements. A judgement about how convivial and (superficially) egalitarian or merely discursive the proceedings are doesn’t amount to a constitutive, ineliminably subjective element in the phenomena themselves. It’s an objective matter what is inside the velvet glove.\n\nPace bianca @144, a more subjective kind of mood music – the kind I think Daniel was referring to – would come in where a political, pragmatic or ideological view determines whether certain plots and plans are regarded as sinister or undesirable, i.e. whether the ‘wrongdoing’ element partly constitutive of ‘conspiracy’ (as canvassed above) is satisfied.\n\nThat is as subjective as the relevant conception of a ‘wrongdoing’-like concept, which in turn may not be terribly subjective after all if you take a positivist (e.g. legalistic) view of the relevant concept, or indeed if you are somewhat objectivistic about values, maybe taking a Hume/Wiggins type of position. In any case, even if a contestable concept is involved, the metaphysics of it are less important than the rhetoric, and there’s actually in many cases (e.g. murder) a fair bit of agreement, or at least lip-service, which is nearly as good.\n\nBonus links\n\nBL1: Hitchens, C., writing in next month’s Vanity Fair, gives Gore Vidal the full treatment. Vidal, with his playful postmodern(?) approach, does of course ask for it a bit – though I’m not aware he deserves this, however heavily (but – as CH well knows – vainly) qualified: a very, very minor tendency to bring up the Jewish question in contexts where it didnâ€™t quite belong…\n\nBL2: The undisputed heavyweight champion of the transfigurative conspiratorial genre, Uncle Bill (video link), debunks, with unimpeachable logic, the ‘all-powerful conspiracy’ trope: “Don’t let them see us! Don’t tell them what we are doing!” Are these the words of the all-powerful boards and syndicates?\n\n“But Iâ€™m not going to follow your example and repeat myself, Donald, if I may reciprocally patronise a second time. (This really is heavy patronisation territory isnâ€™t it.)”\n\nEh? What was that about? I take it from the italicizing of my name that there’s something patronizing about first name use.\n\n“Nice use of the â€˜conspiracistâ€™ label by the way.”\n\nMaybe that’s what it was about. Touchy, touchy. I didn’t even enter into this to argue with you–I was irritated by ajay. I was defending Chomsky’s views from the claim he is having it both ways. As I understand him, he thinks Presidents order the CIA to conduct covert ops and they don’t go and do it on their own. His MLK suggestion is a departure for him, unless he thinks LBJ ordered it. (I also think it’s stupid.)\n\nI’m touchy about the conspiracist label myself, when it is applied to things I believe, such as the conspiracy theory that holds the Bush Administration deliberately lied us into the Iraq War and a friend of mine once dismissed the allegation that the US tortured innocent people to death with the response that “Yeah, well, people write books saying Bush did 9/11”. I don’t want my quite reasonable beliefs about powerful people doing bad things tied in with theories that are ridiculous (9/11 Truther notions) or even those that are not crazy AFAIK but have much less evidence supporting them (this or that group killed JFK). It’s useful to have a term that distinguishes between reasonable conspiracy theories with lots of evidence for them and the ones that seem to attract compulsive types who believe in some elaborate version of history that is hidden to most. Unfortunately we don’t have a good word for this.\n\nDonald @148 yes, sorry if that was slightly touchy but it is unusual to see first name interjected or appended rather than used to establish addressee, esp. twice in one thread. Anyway no wounds inflicted, eh.\n\nSame re the ‘conspiracist’ thing – though I’m not saying it’s a huge deal in any given case, nor advertent on your part, it is a problem I think, because it loads the issue with a personal dimension and tends to mean that 1 and 2 are easily assimilated to 3 (and as you say, there is a continuum along that dimension, so by 3 I probably mean the far extreme in that direction). In fact, I would object a bit to saying ‘paranoid’ at all. It’s inaccurate unless the theory is self-centred, and redundant given that the theory, to get into class 3 must surely actually, objectively and independently be categorised as wildly implausible or actually impossible. Basically, more heat than light.\n\nSame with ‘compulsive types who believe in some elaborate version of history that is hidden to most’.\n\nThat’s a bit of a strawman invention of Popper (in his guise as amateur propagandist) taken up by Hofstadter later on, the ‘conspiracy theory of history’, and doesn’t apply, from what I can see, to most (I have no numbers of course) 9/11 inside job types, for example. Those who do talk in a way that is consistent with that conception are, I think, often (not always; all of this is a matter of the percentages – which I freely admit I can’t supply) not very attached to the idea and see it as a hobbyist diversion, somewhat analogous to those who read horoscopes or go to fortune tellers but if pressed will agree it’s basicaly bollocks (or more recently ‘their own truth’). They also tend to have in mind what I’ve called ‘agent-based theories’ that are pretty thin on detail.\n\nIn fact, in a way, it’s the opposite approach that Chomsky objects to – the focus on isolated individual events, rather than the tight fetters of capitalist history and its integral covert action etc.\n\nAnd I still say C’s position is defective – simply because his headline position is (basically) that conspiracy theories in general are always wrong, while his argument consists largely of saying the CIA (no mention of FBI, or more secretive/ad hoc special forces, or any other actors) don’t act without presidential authority, which includes deniable nods and winks. There’s more detail and context above though your searching and wading through it would no doubt be beyond the call. I may do so later.\n\nAnd the issue of getting authorisation is not the same as top-down planning. For example Operation Northwoods, it appears, was agreed by the joint chiefs and CIA before it was offered to Kennedy for sign-off – which disappointingly for them wasn’t forthcoming in the event. And what is more, Chomsky doesn’t even establish that the CIA are under the complete control of the White House. A specific example of his general approach which isn’t interested in intra-class machinations. He thinks, for example, that Nixon was brought down by big finance – is that with or without the assistance of CIA elements?\n\nBut anyway, getting explicit recognition of the scale that includes 1 to 3 was probably the main part of my (self-imposed) brief really. Not that it isn’t obvious (and I don’t say it wasn’t so to you all along), but from previous conversations with fairly clued-up people (I’m not claiming special ablities, just to have taken an interest in the general topic where others haven’t), it’s clear that the distinction is often overlooked, and certainly there is a big interest in – and apologists in the press expend a lot of effort on – assimilating instances of 1 to classes 2 or 3 – as seen in the rhetoric surrounding the Iraq war plot.\n\n2. Not crazy, but far from proven (maybe some JFK theories, but I donâ€™t know)\n\n‘Proven’ is an interesting one. The standard and burden of proof is of great importance. Standardly in cases where a decision has to be made, I suppose one goes on a balance of probabilities: i.e whatever is more likely than not. As far as the burden of proof (i.e. what is the starting assumption), I’m not sure what you do.\n\nDoes the Warren comission’s JFK theory have default status? Does anything else have to be ‘proven’? What about something that is both far from proven and far from proven-false? Are there any useful rules here? How about teh House Committee on assassinations? They found, on (IIRC) a balance of probabilities basis, that there was a conspiracy, but, on a similar basis, that none of the candidate suspects were reponsible. So where does that leave us? Do we say that a generalised JFK conspiracy theory is ‘far from proven’?\n\nIt makes quite a big difference how you assess the burden and standard of proof – and that rather depends on what the consequences of the outcome are going to be. In a criminal prosecution, there is a burden of proof: it’s placed on the state which is trying to punish someone. And along with that goes (nominally at least) a high standard of proof – beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nOne factor (though a minor one among all the noisy bullshit) which skews public deliberation about possible conspiracies in contemporary and recent history is the fear of libel suits. Another is the rhetoric of the defenders of power, who uniformly manipulate burdens and standards of proof – so an official story is given the benefit of every doubt, a competitor of none. It is very easy to miss this unless one is paying evry close attention with this kind of consideration in mind. OK end of."
