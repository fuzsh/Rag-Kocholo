        "text": "2009\n\nAlumna Elinor Ostrom Awarded Nobel Prize in Economics\n\nTags:\n\nThough it is first awarded in 1969, it takes 40 years for a woman to be granted a Nobel Prize in Economics. Dr. Elinor Ostrom, a native Angeleno, holds three degrees from UCLA: a B.A., an M.A. and a PhD, all in political science. Dr. Ostrom research disproved an idea long assumed by economists: Natural resources collectively used by users will be over-exploited and destroyed. By conducting studies on how people in local communities manage shared natural resources, she showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.\n\n1949\n\nThe School of Nursing is Established\n\nTags:\n\nThe Regents of the University of California authorize establishment of the School of Nursing as one of the professional schools of the UCLA Centers for the Health Sciences. The first baccalaureate program begins in 1950 with eight students, and five part-time and five full-time masters students join by the Fall of 1951. Under the guidance of Provost Clarence Dykstra, the School of Nursing grows quickly.\n\n1925\n\nA Community Comes Together\n\nTags:\n\nUCLA's student population quickly outpaces the capacity of its home on Vermont Avenue. In search of a campus to accommodate over 6,000 students, 600 Lab School (then University Elementary School) attendees, and 250 educators, the Regents consider 17 locations ranging from San Diego to Santa Barbara. Angelenos come together to ensure the university stays in Los Angeles.\n\n1932\n\nTags:\n\nThe corridors of Royce Hall are graced by innumerable brilliant minds over its storied life, one of the most notable being Albert Einstein, who delivers a lecture about his Theory of Relativity there in February of 1932.\n\n1926\n\nA New Name and a New Mascot\n\nTags:\n\nIn 1924, students adopt the term 'Grizzlies' as the university monicker. Two years later, a new mascot is adopted to avoid a conflict with the NCAA and the University of Montana Grizzlies. The Regents rename the Southern Branch to University of California at Los Angeles.\n\n1919\n\nThe Southern Branch is Established\n\nTags:\n\nThe Los Angeles State Normal School moves in 1914 from downtown to a new campus on Vermont Avenue, the present-day site of Los Angeles City College, to accomodate a growing student body. Soon after, the Southern Branch of the University of California is established on May 23, 1919, when Governor William D. Stephens signs Assembly Bill 626, which transfers the Los Angeles State Normal School to the University of California. The passage of the bill marks the culmination of an effort by Regent Edward A. Dickson, State Normal School President Ernest Carroll Moore, and others to establish a state university in Los Angeles."
