        "text": "ProSocial for Physicians workshops are an evidence-based solution designed to rapidly improve provider well-being and group performance.\n\nDrawing upon recent insights in evolutionary neuroscience, organizational theory, cognitive behavioral therapy, and mindfulness, ProSocial for Physicians group coaching workshops use proven tools to quickly improve any group’s day-to-day function by:\n\nReducing burnout and attrition while increasing engagement\n\nTeaching skills to help each other act in a more collaborative, team-based manner to face the incredible challenges in modern healthcare\n\nImproving interpersonal communication with colleagues, staff, and patients\n\nCreating a strong group culture with practice norms that reduce internal conflict and disruptive behavior\n\nRecent research clearly shows that psychological safety is the single greatest driver of team performance. When psychological safety within a physician group or multi-disciplinary team is high, members feel valued, bring their best selves to their work, and out-perform by providing efficient and high-quality care to patients. ProSocial is the most comprehensive, evidence-based process for rapidly increasing psychological safety and maintaining these gains long term.\n\nProSocial for Physicians Workshops use a one-day workshop format (or two half-days).\n\nWe begin by assessing your group’s function and major challenges using standardized ProSocial instruments prior to the workshop.\n\nThe workshop itself then builds upon this data to help team members develop new perspectives on their individual and group behaviors. We augment this with learning based on Elinor Ostrom’s Nobel Prize-winning work on the key design principles that allow groups to work effectively.\n\nOnce this framework for understanding what effective teams look like is developed, and how the key design principles can be applied to your team, we turn our focus to implementing real and lasting change. In particular, we introduce ACT which is a derivative of cognitive-behavioral therapy that is particularly suited to helping individuals and teams identify what is getting in the way of them taking valued action. ACT helps each participant change the way they relate to their own experiences and those of others in the group. It helps participants clarify what really matters to them individually, and to integrate those individual needs and interests with those of the group as a whole. In doing so, the natural barriers to positive relationships that exist in physician groups and multi-disciplinary teams are overcome.\n\nThe last stage is to then take this information and insight and creates tangible actions for increasing group excellence over the next year. This phase creates a well-defined plan with explicit accountability to ensure that the momentum generated in the workshop results in enduring changes to your group’s function.\n\nUsing ProSocial, physician groups and multi-disciplinary teams can make the changes needed to improve their experience of their work and their bottom line. It is particularly effective for groups that have high attrition, high burnout, poor satisfaction scores, or simply cannot “get on the same page.”"
