        "meta_description": "Do women receive the same recognition in science as men? Do they have access to the same incentives? A new study found that while women are indeed winning more prizes, they still lag significantly on prize quality: they win fewer prestigious prizes and less money than men, despite comparable quality of work. Researchers documented biomedical research prizes over the past five decades (1968-2017), from the big ones like the Nobel and the Breakthrough Prize to much smaller, lesser-known awards—628 prizes in all. They also considered the financial awards and prestige associated with the prizes, as indicators of their quality. Then they measured the percentage of prizes won by women and the association between gender and prize quality. Their initial results highlighted overall good news: the proportion of biomedical prizes awarded to women has risen steadily. But when they looked at the association between gender and quality of prizes awarded, they observed a major disparity: on average, women scientists win prizes associated with less money and prestige than men do. They found no evidence that the quality or value of women-led research is any lower than that of men, as measured by citations per article, productivity, or breadth of research topics studied. Interestingly, they also found that women are more likely to win prizes for service to biomedicine than awards for research—50% of these awards went to women from 2008 to 2017, suggesting overrepresentation.",
