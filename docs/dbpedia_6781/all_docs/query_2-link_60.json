        "text": "Key findings\n\nThis report sets out our latest long-term global growth projections to 2050 for 32 of the largest economies in the world, accounting for around 85% of world GDP.\n\nKey results of our analysis (as summarised also in the accompanying video) include:\n\nThe world economy could more than double in size by 2050, far outstripping population growth, due to continued technology-driven productivity improvements\n\nEmerging markets (E7) could grow around twice as fast as advanced economies (G7) on average\n\nAs a result, six of the seven largest economies in the world are projected to be emerging economies in 2050 led by China (1st), India (2nd) and Indonesia (4th)\n\nThe US could be down to third place in the global GDP rankings while the EU27’s share of world GDP could fall below 10% by 2050\n\nUK could be down to 10th place by 2050, France out of the top 10 and Italy out of the top 20 as they are overtaken by faster growing emerging economies like Mexico, Turkey and Vietnam respectively\n\nBut emerging economies need to enhance their institutions and their infrastructure significantly if they are to realise their long-term growth potential.\n\nView the infographics below for highlights of our GDP projections and explore the results further using our interactive data tool.\n\nFurther details are provided in our summary report, full report and slide pack.\n\nOpportunities for business – winning in emerging markets\n\nOur report, which can be downloaded in full below, also considers the opportunities for business:\n\nAs emerging markets mature, they will become less attractive as low cost manufacturing bases but more attractive as consumer and business-to-business (B2B) markets\n\nBut international companies need strategies that are flexible enough to adapt to local customer preferences and rapidly evolving local market dynamics\n\nSince emerging markets can be volatile, international investors also need to be patient enough to ride out the short-term economic and political cycles in these countries\n\nPlease also take a look at the research of our Growth Markets Centre for detailed examples of how companies can succeed in emerging markets."
