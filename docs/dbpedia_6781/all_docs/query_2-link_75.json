        "text": "Chapter 2: The State of Households\n\nIt’s all about the households\n\nMalaysia can rightfully be proud of its economic transformation.\n\nOur nominal GDP has grown 17.5x from RM53.3b in 1980 to RM984.5b in 2013, while nominal GDP per person grew 7.8 times from RM3,841 to RM32,984 during the same period.\n\nTable 1: Nominal GDP per person for Middle Income Countries in 2012\n\nChart 1: Growth of Malaysian Nominal GDP and GDP per person 1980-2013\n\nHigh GDP per person does not however always translate into high household incomes and high average income can be distorted by the incomes of the very well-off. The better measure is median household income, the half-way mark. Our median household income, like our GDP per person, is one of the highest in Asia after the developed nations (Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan).\n\nThe data is clear that households have in fact benefited from our rising GDP. As Charts 2 and 3 show, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of median household income from 1995 to 2012 was 5.9%; it grew from RM1,377 to RM3,626, and has grown more than average household income. Incomes of the lower income households have grown the fastest – the average household income of those in the bottom 40% has grown the most, followed by the middle 40% and then the top 20% of households grouped by household income (Chart 4a).\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, Malaysia’s real median household income grew by 19%; in contrast, in the US and the UK real median household income dropped by 4%.\n\nThe latest figures indicate that in real terms (ie after adjusting for inflation) median household income grew slightly faster than the growth of GDP per person (Chart 4b) although in the past, it was the latter that grew faster.\n\nChart 2: Annualised Nominal Growth Rates 1995-2012 (percentage)\n\nChart 3: Average and Median Monthly Household Income 1995-2012 (RM)\n\nChart 4a: Growth of GDP per person and Nominal Average Household Income 1979-2012\n\nChart 4b: Growth of Real Household Income and Real GDP per person 1995-2012\n\nWe have done well but we should, as always, strive for better. Our average monthly household income in 2012 was RM5,000. But our median household income was less, at RM3,626.\n\n23% of households earned less than RM2,000 per month\n\n55% less than RM4,000 per month\n\n74% less than RM6,000 per month.\n\nAt the individual level, the latest data from DoS shows that in 2013 the median monthly salaries and wages was RM1,700. This is consistent with the data from EPF that show that 62% of active EPF members earned less than RM2,000 per month and 96% earned less than RM6,000.\n\nAbout households\n\nBased on the latest available data from DoS, the population of Malaysia in 2010 was 28.6 million. There were 6,341,273 households and an average of 4.3 people per household as of 2010. The following charts tell us where our people live and the composition of their households.\n\nChart 5: Population of Malaysia by State in 2010 (m)\n\nRich and poor states\n\nThere is a wide variation in nominal GDP between states. Kuala Lumpur, the second richest by nominal GDP but the first in GDP per person terms, has a higher nominal GDP per person than Korea. Kelantan, the poorest state by nominal GDP per person and second from the bottom in terms of nominal GDP, lies between richer Indonesia and poorer Sri Lanka in terms of GDP per person.\n\nChart 6: Nominal GDP per person in 2012 (USD)\n\nTable 2: Nominal GDP per person by State in 2013 (RM)\n\nChart 7: Nominal GDP by Malaysian States in 2012 (RM b)\n\nGDP is not household income\n\nHigh GDP, GDP per person and GDP per household do not necessarily translate into high household incomes.\n\nAverage household income also often does not present a true picture of the income of most households as it can be distorted by the incomes of the very well-off. It disguises the fact that the median is actually much lower.\n\nChart 8: Median and Average Monthly Household Income and GDP per Household per Month in 2012 (RM)\n\nSarawak for example has the second highest GDP per household but ranks eighth for average and seventh for median household income. Both Pahang’s and Terengganu’s average household incomes are lower than Sarawak’s, but the median household incomes of all three states are almost the same. Amongst the bottom three states, Perlis has the highest GDP per household and average household income but still has a lower median household income than Kedah.\n\nDeprived households\n\nThe federal government has done its part in providing schools, hospitals and electricity. Except in Sabah and Sarawak, which have remote interiors, most households have electricity and are less than 9km away from a secondary school or a health facility.\n\nChart 9a: Percentage of Households that have Electricity, Schools and Public Health in 2012\n\nWater and sanitation in some states on the other hand have not been as well provided, as the chart below shows. For example, in Kelantan, only 50% of its rural households and 68% of its urban households have pipe water. The majority (57%) of its households have no flush toilets but use ‘tandas curah’.\n\nChart 9b: Percentage of Rural and Urban Households that have Pipe Water and Tandas Curah in 2012\n\nThe states of the north: Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu\n\nChart 10: Characteristics of Households by Median Household Income, Ethnicity, Ownership of Tandas Curah and Strata in 2012\n\nAttention has rightly been focused on the development of our most southern Peninsular states, and Sabah and Sarawak, with their remote interiors. But we must also improve the state of households in the north. We must bring education and employment opportunities, and improve basic amenities like water and sanitation. The corridor initiatives and the double-tracking to Padang Besar will help, but we must do more.\n\nThere is an ethnic, urban-rural and gender divide\n\nOf the three major ethnic groups, Chinese households are on average the richest and Bumiputera ones the least well-off. The average income of households headed by an urban male Chinese is the highest, while those headed by female Indians and Bumiputeras in the rural areas are the lowest.\n\nThe income gap between the ethnic groups is, however, less than the urban-rural income gap, which explains why young people move to towns from their kampung. For example, in the rural areas, the average Bumiputera household income is less than the average Chinese household income, whereas the average urban Bumiputera household income is much higher.\n\nChart 11: Average Household Incomes by Ethnicity, Strata and Gender in 2012 (RM)\n\nUnequal household incomes\n\nIncome disparities vary by ethnic group and there is also an intra-ethnic inequality in income distribution.\n\nThe DoS Household Income Survey puts households in various monthly household income brackets. It starts with households that earn less than RM1,000 a month, then those that earn more than RM1,000 but less than RM2,000, all the way to those that earn RM10,000 a month or more.\n\n‘Others’ and Bumiputeras tend to have higher proportions of households that earn less than RM2,000 a month, whereas the Chinese and Indians have higher proportions of households earning more than RM5,000 per month. The Chinese have proportionately the most households that earn RM10,000 or more per month.\n\nChart 12: Percentage Distribution of Households in Each Income Category in 2012: Malaysia and by ethnicity of the household head\n\nThe distribution of household incomes reflects individual income distribution. Employees Provident Fund (EPF) data on individual incomes, which includes salary or wages, overtime payments, and bonus shows that in 2013:\n\n96% of active EPF members earn less than RM6,000 a month\n\n85% less than RM4,000\n\n62% less than RM2,000.\n\nAs mentioned earlier the median monthly salaries and wages per month for individuals is RM1,700. That means half of all workers get this much or less. The breakdown by ethnicity and strata is as Table 3 below.\n\nTable 3: Individual Wages by Ethnicity and Strata in 2013"
