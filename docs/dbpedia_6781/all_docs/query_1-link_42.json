        "text": "Export Credits Guarantee Department (UK Export Finance) Annual Report and Accounts 2022-23\n\nAnnual Report presented to Parliament pursuant to section 7(5) of the Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991.\n\nAccounts presented to the House of Commons pursuant to section 6(4) of the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000.\n\nAccounts presented to the House of Lords by Command of His Majesty.\n\nOrdered by the House of Commons to be printed on 27 June 2023.\n\nThis is part of a series of departmental publications which, along with the Main Estimates 2023-24 and the document Public Expenditure: Statistical Analyses 2022, present the government’s outturn for 2022-23 and planned expenditure for 2023-24.\n\nHC 1354\n\nMinisters’ foreword\n\nUKEF provides an essential service as the UK’s export credit agency, but its merits become especially prominent in times of uncertainty.\n\nThe department’s support, through the loans, guarantees and insurance it provides, is vital for helping to get businesses trading, so we can deliver the economic growth that is a priority for this government.\n\nThis is why, this year, we increased its maximum capacity from £50 billion to £60 billion, meaning that it can help more British businesses of all sizes to export. This enables the department to support more jobs, fuel growth and lubricate the crucial gears of international trade.\n\nThose gears are driving a lot of trade. I am delighted to report another very successful year for UKEF, in which it has issued £6.5 billion of financial support, supporting 532 businesses, and backed 55,000 jobs around the country. For each of those businesses, UKEF’s support can be a turning point, increasing their scale and transforming their business model.\n\nI am proud that UK exports in 2022-23 increased on the previous year, proving the continued value of British exports to the world in spite of global economic shocks. This is a testament to the resilience and ambition of UK businesses, but it is also the result of government support and collaboration, in which UKEF plays a vital part.\n\nAll this against a difficult economic backdrop, affecting people around the world. UK businesses have felt this acutely, compounded by the continuing recovery from Covid-19 and the economic impact of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis department can help shape the response to these shocks. UKEF’s proactive support for Ukraine will be an important part of the cross-government response.\n\nThe same can be said for the climate crisis. The UK is home to businesses leading the technological changes that will help the world to achieve net zero. UKEF ensures that British innovation is exported to the world, and can help to deliver on the UK’s ambition to be a global leader on climate change.\n\nThose innovations contribute to immense economic and social benefits in the UK. Levelling up and the just transition go hand in hand, delivering job opportunities to communities across our country. As has been the trend in recent years, a significant proportion of exporters UKEF has supported (82% this year) are based outside London. Exporting businesses are more competitive, pay higher wages and are more profitable. Economic growth and our future prosperity lie, in part, in exports, which is why further increasing them is among this government’s highest priorities.\n\nUKEF’s extensive and ambitious approach has facilitated trade, job creation, and community improvement, making a significant contribution to government aims. Even in the face of challenging economic circumstances, UKEF has again shown its unwavering commitment to providing British businesses with the necessary support to thrive in the global marketplace.\n\nLord Offord of Garvel, Minister for Exports\n\n22 June 2023\n\nChair’s statement\n\nIt scarcely seems any time since my first report as Chair back in 2017, yet now I am delivering my final one. And what a year it has been.\n\nUKEF remains ever more flexible, embracing challenges with an appetite for innovation and continuous improvement.\n\nOver the past five years, UKEF has consistently provided record levels of support to UK exports, with a staggering £6.5 billion provided this year. Once more, I am pleased to see that such a high proportion (84%) of our direct customers are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which does not even include all those indirectly supported through the lengthy supply chains behind our exports.\n\nUKEF has paid out on claims this year; that is an inevitable consequence of its role, operating in markets where actuarial risk is greater, yet the commercial sector is hesitant to venture. And UKEF is experienced in managing, mitigating and recovering such claims – just consider its aerospace portfolio.\n\nThis year, UKEF experienced transitions in its leadership, including changes in the role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO). While there were multiple CEO transitions, I want to emphasize that they were managed seamlessly.\n\nI must pay tribute to Louis Taylor, who led UKEF for 7 years following his appointment in 2015. Louis steered UKEF through the uncertainties following the Brexit referendum and the lengthy exit process, and through the pandemic, seeing UKEF achieve record levels of support for exporters against a backdrop of global business challenges. Louis’s insights are sorely missed, and I wish him all the best at the British Business Bank. I am grateful to our new CEO, Tim Reid, who is putting his own stamp on a flourishing department.\n\nDuring the interim period, we were fortunate to have Samir Parkash as the Interim CEO, ensuring a seamless continuation of UKEF’s operations. I extend my sincere appreciation to Samir for his excellent work during this time.\n\nI also thank Lawrence Weiss for his diligent work over 4 and a half years as Chair of the Audit Committee and 6 years as a fellow non-executive director; and welcome Charlotte Morgan, who replaces Lawrence on the Board and the Audit Committee.\n\nWhile the past year involved some changes in senior management and board positions, I am confident that the leadership team, both past and present, has played a pivotal role in guiding UKEF towards success.\n\nWe are grateful for their contributions and are excited about the future as we continue to build on our achievements.\n\nI am proud of UKEF’s achievements during my tenure as its Chair. UKEF continues to expand its product range, including the step change of non-contract-specific guarantees. The Export Development Guarantee and General Export Facility have both had an immense impact, reflecting the innovation that is so characteristic of UKEF’s approach.\n\nThat thirst for innovation is also evident in UKEF’s response to the new government policy over fossil fuel projects, and the need to act urgently on climate change. UKEF has launched its own comprehensive Climate Change Strategy and continues to develop a green finance portfolio and pipeline.\n\nI am delighted that UKEF now employs more women in senior roles than when I became Chair. Achieving equity remains a work in progress, but the department is moving in the right direction and remains committed to addressing the gender pay gap.\n\nI am also heartened by UKEF’s reputation beyond Whitehall. The British Exporters Association (BExA) has long been a critical friend, and it has regularly scored us highly on the range and nature of our products. UKEF scored 9 out of 10 yet again in BExA’s latest report on our range of products and their usability for customers.\n\nI have enjoyed my time as Chair of UKEF, relishing the resilience, enthusiasm and application of its staff, the insight and motivations of its leadership, and the huge support that it continues to render to our exporters.\n\nNoël Harwerth, Chair\n\n22 June 2023\n\nAbout UK Export Finance\n\nWho we are\n\nUK Export Finance (UKEF) is the UK’s export credit agency and a government department, strategically and operationally aligned with the Department for Business and Trade.\n\nUKEF is the operating name of the Export Credits Guarantee Department.\n\nOur mission\n\nWe advance prosperity by ensuring no viable UK export fails for lack of finance or insurance, doing that sustainably and at no net cost to the taxpayer over time. We help UK companies:\n\nwin export contracts by providing attractive financing terms to their buyers\n\nfulfil export contracts by supporting working capital loans and contract bonds\n\nget paid for export contracts by providing insurance against buyer default\n\nHow we do it\n\nWe fulfil our mission by providing insurance, guarantees and loans where the private sector will not, backed by the strength of the government’s balance sheet. We also help companies find support from the private sector. Our work means that:\n\nmore UK companies realise their ambitions for international growth\n\nmore jobs in the UK are supported\n\noverall UK exports are higher\n\nWe complement, rather than compete with, the private sector and work with around 100 private credit insurers and lenders. We help to make exports happen which otherwise might not, helping UK exporters and their supply chains grow their business overseas. In this way, we provide security of support through economic cycles and market disruptions.\n\n2022-23 in figures\n\n£6.5 billion – Financial support issued\n\n£46.3 billion – Maximum annual exposure\n\n£60 billion – Capacity to support exports\n\n532 – Exporters supported\n\n210 SMEs supported\n\n55, 000 UK jobs supported\n\nThis year’s milestones\n\n2023 Best export credit agency\n\n2022\n\nAPRIL:\n\nLaunched a new online sovereign premium rate calculator\n\nBacked hydrogen technologies with an export development guarantee to secure a £400 million loan for Johnson Matthey\n\nMAY:\n\nSigned a cooperation agreement with the Saudi Arabian export credit agency, Saudi Export-Import Bank\n\nHelped Northern Ireland-based Circular Group secure a major £4 million recycling contract\n\nJUNE:\n\nRecognised as the leading export credit agency in sustainable financing by TXF, with 3 Export Finance Deal of the Year awards for Renewables, Healthcare and Rail sectors\n\nProvided an Export Development Guarantee to JDR Cables to support a £100 million loan to fund a new state-of-the-art subsea cable facility in Blyth, Northumberland to serve offshore wind farms\n\nUKEF’s first deal in Jordan supported the construction of 4 new factories and a corporate office in Aqaba using UK construction suppliers\n\nJULY:\n\nIn UKEF’s first direct deal in Senegal, provided a £116.5 million loan using a mix of Buyer Credit and Direct Lending to purchase fire-fighting and other life-saving emergency equipment\n\nAUGUST:\n\nSupported the world’s first all-electric quad bike business as it invests in its supply chain and funds expansion in North America\n\nSEPTEMBER:\n\nSupported the maritime sector with a bond support deal with Middlesbrough shipbuilder Parkol Marine Engineering\n\nLaunched a new online service to obtain quick non-binding quotes for UKEF export insurance\n\nOCTOBER:\n\nSamir Parkash appointed interim Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnnounced 2 landmark finance packages worth a combined £ million for vital construction projects in Benin and Togo\n\nSupported an £89 million loan to Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer to source UK components\n\nNOVEMBER:\n\nProvided export development support for the world’s first hydrogen-powered, zero carbon double decker bus\n\nAnnounced Virgin Money as the latest partner bank for the General Export Facility\n\nAt COP27, announced a new debt solution to help developing countries with climate shocks by introducing Climate Resilient Debt Clauses into loan agreements\n\nLaunched the new Bills & Notes Guarantee to enhance our suite of products for smaller export credit transactions\n\nDECEMBER:\n\nProvided support for export of IT hardware and software services to Kenya, demonstrating ability to support smaller export credit transactions with Apple Bank\n\n2023\n\nJANUARY:\n\nTim Reid appointed Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnnounced support for a 250-bed specialist burns hospital in Angola, to be constructed with UK suppliers in a leading role\n\nIssued a joint statement with G7 Export Credit Agencies expressing support for Ukraine\n\nFEBRUARY:\n\nPublished a new Sustainability Policy Statement on how we will understand and drive the long-term sustainability of transactions and address both current and future sustainability and credit risks\n\nMARCH:\n\nTotal capacity to support exports raised to £60 billion\n\nAnnounced the appointment of the first International Export Finance Executive for South Korea\n\nWelcomed the government’s 2023 Green Finance Strategy alongside the British Business Bank, UK Research and Innovation and the UK Infrastructure Bank\n\nOutlined a £4 billion ambition for closer export ties with Albania through a partnership in economic development and sustainable projects in Albania and the wider Western Balkans\n\nFinancial objectives\n\nThe Treasury agrees a standing consent with UKEF, providing parameters within which we can operate. These parameters embed fiscal responsibility in the way we work. The Treasury sets our financial objectives, which are designed to enable us to support UK exporters while making sure UKEF:\n\nreceives a return that is at least adequate to cover the cost of the risks it is assuming\n\ndoes not expose the taxpayer to the risk of excessive loss\n\ncovers its operating costs\n\nA fuller description of our financial objectives, risk appetite and controls can be found in the Governance Statement.\n\nPerformance against objectives\n\nObjective and description Results Maximum commitment: This measure places a cap on the maximum amount of nominal risk exposure (the total amount of taxpayers’ money that may be put at risk by UKEF). Met: The highest recorded maximum exposure in the year was £46.3 billion, against a maximum permissible level of £50 billion. Risk appetite limit: This limit places a constraint on UKEF’s appetite for risk at the 99.1 percentile of UKEF’s estimated portfolio loss distribution. Met: UKEF’s 99.1 percentile of portfolio loss distribution did not exceed £3.5 billion against a maximum permissible level of £5 billion. Reserve index: This index ensures that UKEF has accumulated, over time, enough revenue to cover possible losses, to a 77.5% level of confidence. Met: The reserve index did not fall below 1.94 in the year, against a target minimum of 1.00. Pricing adequacy index: This index tests whether, over time, UKEF earns enough premium income to cover all its risk and operating costs. It is measured over 3 different periods: (i) past 2 years and present year. Met: This index was 1.68 at 31 March 2023, against a monthly minimum target of 1.00. (ii) previous, present and (forecast) next year. Met: This index did not fall below 1.50, against a monthly target minimum of 1.00. (iii) present year and (forecast) next 2 years. Met: This index did not fall below 1.48, against a monthly target minimum of 1.00. Premium-to-risk ratio: This measure ensures that each year UKEF charges enough premium to cover the cost of risk, together with a sufficient margin to contribute a material amount to administrative costs. Met: This ratio did not fall below 1.57, against a target minimum of 1.35.\n\nThese financial objectives apply to business issued since 1991. There are no specific financial objectives in respect of outstanding exposures on business supported before 1991 other than to recover amounts owed to UKEF, while taking account of the government’s policy on debt forgiveness. As authorised by HM Treasury, the Temporary Covid-19 Support Account is exempt from UKEF’s standard portfolio level financial objectives and risk appetite limit. These financial objectives apply to the Guarantees & Insurance Account and Direct Lending Account. The only exception is the maximum commitment objective, which includes all active accounts.\n\nThe total amount of nominal credit risk exposure that the department may incur (set at £50 billion under the HM Treasury consent for the financial year) is now at £60 billion as of 31 March 2023.\n\nHow to read the performance chapter\n\nThe performance chapter is a comprehensive overview of UKEF’s financial performance over the past year, including our objectives, risks and focus for the year ahead. To make sense of this information, it’s useful to understand UKEF’s purpose and structure.\n\nUKEF is a self-funding, income-generating department with a mandate to support UK exports and overseas investment where support is not available from the private sector alone. We operate under the consent of HM Treasury, which sets UKEF’s financial objectives. These objectives make sure we are financially responsible when taking risks - something we have to do to provide financial support that the private sector cannot.\n\nOur financial performance is best viewed over the business cycle, not just against a single year. This is because our business involves supporting loans that can take more than 10 years to repay, and losses from unrecovered claims can take many years to assess. It provides a more comprehensive view of our financial performance.\n\nAs you read through this chapter, you will also encounter various performance metrics and account descriptions. These include our headline metrics, such as the maximum liability of new business supported in the year and the premium income we’ve earned to protect the department against the risk of loss.\n\nThese metrics have been consistently and reliably reported over time, showing trends in UKEF’s support and providing a measure of our output. You will also find new context and metrics on the broader impacts of our support and its effect on the economies and communities in which we work.\n\nOur accounts\n\nUKEF operates 6 accounts, each defined by the nature of business supported by the department. Three of the 6 accounts are active and 3 are closed, with old exposure running off.\n\nIn previous Annual Reports, we’ve referred to these accounts by number. To make it easier to understand how they are used, we have given the accounts more descriptive names in this report. We will continue to use these new account names in the future to make things clear and easy to understand.\n\nEach of our active accounts plays a crucial role in helping UKEF achieve its financial objectives and fulfil its mission to support UK exports. While our closed accounts are no longer active, they provide important historical context for understanding our department’s evolution over time.\n\nActive accounts\n\nOld account number New account name Account description Account 2 Guarantees & Insurance Account Relates to the credit risk arising from guarantees and insurance issued by UKEF for business since April 1991. Account 3 National Interest Account Relates to guarantees and loans issued for business since April 1991 on the written instruction of ministers, which UKEF’s Accounting Officer had advised did not meet normal underwriting criteria. Account 5 Direct Lending Account Relates to the provision of direct lending (in the normal course of business) since it was introduced in 2014.\n\nClosed accounts\n\nOld account number New account name Account description Account 1 Pre-1991 Guarantees & Insurance Account Relates to guarantees and insurance issued for business before April 1991, and insurance issued by the Insurance Services Group of UKEF (which was privatised on 1 December 1991) for which UKEF retains all contingent liabilities. Account 4 Fixed Rate Export Finance Account Relates to the provision of Fixed Rate Export Finance (FREF) to banks (closed to new business since 31 March 2011), together with arrangements for reducing the funding cost of FREF loans and for certain interest rate derivative arrangements. UKEF has no exposure remaining in this account. Account 6 Temporary Covid-19 Support Account Relates to all business underwritten and booked under the Temporary Covid-19 Risk Framework from opening on 2 April 2020 to when it closed to new business on 31 July 2022.\n\nChief Executive’s report\n\nWe are committed to delivering for our customers and making a real-world impact. Our efforts to serve more customers are paying off and we are now supporting more small-to-medium sized businesses than at any time in the last 30 years.\n\nUKEF’s mission is more critical than ever before. As the newly appointed CEO, I am proud to lead an organisation with such an essential role in driving economic growth and job creation, and such a significant impact on communities in the UK and abroad.\n\nOur flexibility and strong risk management have enabled us to both grow our portfolio, which has doubled in the past 4 years, and continue to self-fund. This has allowed UKEF to take on business rapidly in the national interest on behalf of ministers, whether supporting exports to Ukraine or helping businesses weather the impact of Covid-19.\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed. Our customers say that our support is essential to their export success. We have an 80% customer satisfaction score. Still, we want to do more.\n\nTo continue to grow and diversify our customer base, we are developing new products, investing in technology, expanding our delivery network and building on the success of our general working capital products.\n\nWe are prioritising our support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), core customers for UKEF. This will mean providing better customer service, more accessible products and working with a wider range of lenders. To break new ground and serve SMEs’ needs, we must continue to think differently and try new approaches.\n\nOf course, we must always balance our commitment to growth and innovation with strong risk management and fiscal discipline. This balance is the cornerstone of our structure and mission to protect the UK taxpayer. By carefully managing risk, we can continue to support viable UK exports while safeguarding taxpayers’ money.\n\nThat’s why balancing the financial risks posed by climate change with opportunities to drive low-carbon trade is central to our operations. We help businesses targeting net-zero exports, supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy by financing the development of technologies such as electric vehicles and renewable energy. Management of sustainability is embedded in all our operations and we are continuing to improve our response to the energy transition and wider sustainability trends.\n\nOne of many examples is our support of JDR Cables, a renewable energy specialist based in Blyth, Northumberland. JDR received a £100 million working capital loan backed by UKEF to build a new state-of-the-art subsea cable manufacturing facility. This support will help JDR secure more national and international contracts and create over 170 high quality UK jobs.\n\nAs the world shifts towards net zero, JDR’s exporting potential is significant, with 2,571 offshore wind farms and projects in over 50 countries. By supporting companies like JDR with general working capital, we are contributing to the UK’s clean growth industry and helping to create a more sustainable future.\n\nWe are also making a difference to lives overseas. Six new hospitals are being built across Côte d’Ivoire, providing healthcare to millions of people and creating jobs for thousands, backed by direct lending from UKEF this year. Behind this significant achievement are scores of UK suppliers exporting materials and services. This is just one of the many ways in which UKEF is making a real impact on people’s lives and livelihoods, and contributing to the UK’s reputation as a reliable trading partner.\n\nIn my short time here, I have been inspired by the commitment and dedication of our people to make such powerful impacts. I am focussed on making UKEF the best place to work and grow your career in the Civil Service.\n\nI am proud that UKEF has the most ethnically diverse workforce in the government, with an inclusive culture that values everyone. We have welcomed many exceptional female leaders, with Julia Beck (Director of Strategy & Impact), Esi Eshun (Interim Director of Business Group) and Jayne Whymark (Interim Director of Legal) all appointed to new roles in the executive team this year. I’d also like to express deep gratitude for Louis Taylor’s outstanding contribution to UKEF over the past 7 years. His work has helped make UKEF what it is today. Samir Parkash has also been an invaluable source of support to me, both earlier in the year when stewarding UKEF as Interim CEO, and now in his role as Chief Risk Officer.\n\nI am honoured to be part of a team of dedicated and passionate individuals who are committed to making a positive difference. As we continue to serve our customers better and support more exporters, I am sure that together we can create a better workplace for our people to deliver, ensuring UKEF will continue to make a positive impact on the UK economy – and beyond.\n\n2022-23 in review\n\n2022-23 was a challenging year globally, with inflation and an energy crisis causing difficulties for businesses, restricting liquidity and increasing the cost of debt. However, UKEF has once again provided certainty of support to UK exporters during this challenging period, providing £6.5 billion of financial support to further UK exports – a testament to the strength and diversity of our products and services.\n\nThis has resulted in continued growth in demand for our general working capital products. The Export Development Guarantee accounted for 51% of the £6.5 billion we issued and 70% of customers were supported using the General Export Facility. We are delivering flexible support to exporters to suit their financing needs, making our guarantee more accessible than ever before.\n\nUKEF’s business volumes have been unusually high in recent years due to unprecedented support for businesses during the pandemic using the Temporary Covid-19 Support Account, which closed to new business this year. UKEF remains committed to serving a diverse range of customers and sectors, and our financial performance strongly reflects this commitment.\n\nSuch sustained, record-breaking levels of support have brought UKEF close to its £50 billion commitment limit for the first time this year. The Treasury raised our commitment level to £60 billion for 2023-24, ensuring we can continue to negotiate support for the nearly £10 billion of commitments in our pipeline.\n\nHow we calculate the number of exporters we have directly supported\n\nBy providing insurance, guarantees and loans, and by helping companies find the support they need from the private sector, UKEF makes exports happen which might not happen otherwise.\n\nIn addition to companies we’ve directly supported with a product, our direct support also includes firms that are paid directly by a drawdown from a UKEF facility, where the buyer is sourcing goods and services from the UK as a result of UKEF’s intervention. These are called Tier 2 suppliers.\n\nFor companies to be included in our ‘directly supported’ figure, we require evidence of them securing business on projects we are supporting. This is a condition of our support when we agree on transactions for overseas projects. We also include private market assists when UKEF engagement has had a material contribution to an export receiving support from the private sector.\n\nOur customer base has remained consistently high over the past 3 years when compared to previous business cycles. I am particularly pleased that in this financial year, the number of exporters we supported directly with a product increased significantly to 251 UK exporters, and that 84% of these were SMEs. Such consistent levels of support have not been delivered since the 5 years from 1987 to 1992, when the Export Credit Guarantees Department of the time was 4 times the size of UKEF today, when much of its operations were privatised. While proud of this growth, I recognise that there are still many UK exporters who could benefit from our support. I remain committed to reaching more businesses and helping them achieve their export ambitions.\n\nWhat must underpin our continued and growing support for UK exports is the ability to cover our operating costs and credit losses so we operate at no net cost to the taxpayer over time. It’s why the department charges companies a risk-based premium for its support and has robust portfolio management and recoveries processes in place to offset losses.\n\nThis year, we returned a profit of £303 million for the UK exchequer and earned £313 million of premium income to protect the taxpayer against the risk of business issued this year – staying well within our financial objectives as we seek to break even over the business cycle.\n\nAs an export credit agency, paying out claims is what brings value to UKEF’s guarantee. This year, we paid out £122 million in net claims, largely driven by continuing airline defaults following the pandemic and new claims arising from countries struggling to service their debt thanks to market volatility and rising interest rates. We also received £125 million in recoveries this year from historic claims, as we seek to recoup the cost of claims paid on any defaulted loan we support.\n\nThe commitment of UKEF staff to serving customers, managing risk, acting responsibly and making the greatest possible impact has been invaluable in achieving this consistent level of support over time. UKEF will continue to build on this strong foundation. Retaining and recruiting talented people is at the core of our plan to drive growth in the future.\n\nTim Reid, Chief Executive and Accounting Officer\n\n22 June 2023\n\n5-year summary*\n\nFinancial

This significant achievement empowered us to leverage additional growth opportunities and ensure the long-term sustainability of our operations.\n\nIt enabled us to effectively deliver on our existing priorities while also reinforcing critical areas of the business and adapting to new challenges. These include:\n\ndriving UKEF’s Climate Change Strategy\n\nfulfilling our commitments under the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nimplementing the Financial Reporting Changes Programme\n\nfortifying our cyber security and resilience in alignment with recommendations from the Cabinet Office\n\nexpanding our overseas network in priority markets\n\nBy using the settlement to its fullest extent, we are well positioned to achieve our objectives in the year ahead and continue making a positive impact on UK exporters and the global trade landscape.\n\nOur impact\n\nUKEF’s support helps UK businesses compete more effectively in global markets and take advantage of new opportunities for growth. This helps create jobs, lift wages, and increase productivity across all nations and regions in the UK, all of which help to grow the UK’s economy.\n\nBeyond this direct benefit to UK exporters, UKEF has a much wider positive impact overseas, helping to grow the global economy while promoting sustainable development around the world. Essential projects that improve the lives of people worldwide, such as new hospitals or better access to electricity in rural areas of Africa, can happen because of what we do.\n\nFree and fair trade is what global prosperity and security are based on\n\nKemi Badenoch, Secretary of State for Business and Trade\n\nUKEF is committed to maximising the positive real-world impact of our support. That is why we continually strive to understand and drive the outcomes of our work, using economic, social and environmental indicators to measure our impact. This will lay the foundations for our next business plan, which will be launched in the next financial year.\n\nDelivering the government’s priorities\n\nUKEF plays a critical role in supporting the government’s business, trade and foreign policy priorities. As a government department and a financial institution, we must deliver our mandate in a way that makes our taxpayer-backed support go as far as possible.\n\nThe economic disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and, latterly, Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has focussed scrutiny on UKEF’s public policy impact in recent years.\n\nTo assist UK exporters as rapidly as possible following the outbreak of Covid-19, UKEF established the Temporary Covid-19 Risk Framework (TCRF) in April 2020, under specific approval from ministers and HM Treasury. In 2022-23, an additional £1.1 billion of support was provided under this framework. This framework closed to new business in the year. The total issued since it was launched in April 2020 was nearly £10 billion.\n\nMinisters also directed UKEF to maintain cover for exports to Ukraine and end all cover for Russia and Belarus. In 2022-23, UKEF provided payment risk insurance to cover exports to Ukraine and agreed commitments worth over £50 million to support the Government of Ukraine, working closely with international counterparts.\n\nThe government’s Integrated Review also recognised UKEF’s support as a key financing tool. The review helps to align UKEF’s support with the UK’s efforts to forge new trading relationships around the world, using our accessible product range and on-the-ground support in developing markets.\n\nWe now have 20 International Finance Executives placed in strategic markets worldwide to help win business for UK suppliers, coupled with 27 Export Finance Managers based in regions across the UK to directly finance UK exporters. This in turn allows us to support businesses across the union, including companies in North Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n\nIn 2022-23, UKEF also made significant progress towards fulfilling its commitments to the UK’s Export Strategy. This included making the Export Development Guarantee fully operational, onboarding new financial institutions to the General Export Facility and relaunching our Bills & Notes Guarantee. These developments highlight UKEF’s role as a lever of government to help UK businesses succeed in the global marketplace.\n\nSupporting economic growth\n\nThe value of the loans, guarantees and insurance policies provided in 2022-23 was £6.5 billion. This means that UKEF supports the direct production of goods and delivery of services by UK exporters and also generates indirect benefits through the wider supply chain.\n\nThis translates to support for jobs and economic activity across the UK, which UKEF measures using a gross value added (GVA) figure. So when UKEF supports a transaction, it’s not just about helping a single company, it’s also contributing to the growth of the UK economy as a whole.[footnote 2]\n\nDirect impact: UKEF facilitates exports, which supports jobs and economic activity within the beneficiary company.\n\nIndirect impact (supply chain): the beneficiary company purchases from suppliers who employ staff and support economic activity in the UK.\n\nTotal impact[footnote 3]\n\neconomic activity\n\nwages\n\nprofits\n\njobs\n\n55,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs\n\n29,000 indirect\n\n27000 direct\n\n£4.1 billion – gross value added[footnote 4]\n\n£1.9 billion indirect\n\n£2.2 billion direct\n\n£2.6 billion - in wages[footnote 5]\n\n£1.2 billion indirect\n\n£1.4 billion direct\n\n£1.4 billlion – in profits[footnote 6]\n\n£0.7 billion indirect\n\n£0.8 billion direct\n\nSpotlight on trade finance\n\nUKEF’s trade finance business provides financial support and insurance directly to UK exporters, making sure they get paid for exports and can navigate the risks of international trade. It is designed as targeted support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who export.\n\nThe General Export Facility, a trade finance product launched in December 2020, has quickly become UKEF’s most popular product. This year, Virgin Money and Newable joined the main 5 UK banks in deploying the facility.\n\nOne beneficiary in 2022-23 was Hull-based Paneltex, which produces refrigerated and temperature-controlled vehicles. Established 30 years ago, today it employs nearly 600 people and 25% of its sales are exported. UKEF supported a £4 million General Export Facility through Barclays to support its growing export business.\n\nThe development of UKEF’s trade finance products means smaller companies are better able to access support for their export growth. We have made the process for insurance cover even more accessible by offering online applications and streamlining the process for our customers.\n\nHunter Safety Solutions, which exports health and safety consulting and training services throughout Europe, approached UKEF to highlight the challenge of rising costs linked to its exporting activities. UKEF was able to arrange a £300,000 working capital facility, working with new partner lender Newable.\n\nSpotlight on overseas projects and UK export development\n\nExport credits\n\nUKEF connects overseas project sponsors and buyers with UK exporters. We do this by assisting them with financing major development projects while requiring an agreed minimum UK content.\n\nIn 2022-23, UKEF supported 21 projects in Africa and the Middle East, with £650 million provided in total.\n\nThis included £130 million of support for the construction of a new specialist burns hospital in Angola. UKEF provided a mix of guaranteed finance and direct lending to the Angolan Ministry of Finance, with a proportion of the project to be fulfilled by UK supplies, including building materials, electrical equipment and medical supplies.\n\nUKEF announced further enhancements to its product range for smaller export credit transactions, with a new Bills & Notes Guarantee launched in November 2022. This joined our existing Standard Buyer Loan Guarantee, which supported 5 transactions in 2022-23, including a £900,000 loan guarantee for the export of IT hardware and software by Vesper Technologies to a cloud services provider in Nairobi.\n\nUK export development\n\nLarger corporate exporters have replicated the success of the General Export Facility in supporting SMEs by using UKEF’s Export Development Guarantee. It has allowed UKEF to expand its support beyond its traditional customer base of manufacturers, with support for e-commerce provider The Hut Group, football club Wolverhampton Wanderers and multimedia firm Future Plc. This is in addition to continued support for car manufacturers, with further support for Ford Plc. Total support under Export Development Guarantee facilities was £3.3 billion in 2022-23.\n\nDoing business sustainably\n\nActing sustainably is now an important part of UKEF’s mission, and we are focussed on embedding this across our activities and updating our approach periodically to keep pace with the rapid development of this area. That’s why we published a new Sustainability Policy Statement in February 2023.\n\nUKEF’s 3rd report following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. It details how UKEF identifies and manages climate-related risk and opportunities. We are building on this work to better measure and manage our impacts across a range of sustainability outcomes.\n\nInternational engagement\n\nAs the first Export Credit Agency (ECA) to end new support for overseas fossil fuel projects, in line with UK government policy that prohibits such support other than in certain defined and limited circumstances, we engage with fellow ECAs and other stakeholders to explain and advocate for the adoption of similar approaches across the sector.\n\nWe continue to support the implementation of the COP26 Statement on International Public Support for the Clean Energy Transition, signed by 39 countries and public finance agencies.\n\nThis year we played a leading role in modernising the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits. We advocated for changes to make sure the Arrangement adapts to meet the demands of a competitive global landscape and that ECAs can support the global transition to a net zero economy.\n\nUKEF also became the first ECA to announce that it will offer Climate Resilient Debt Clauses in its direct sovereign lending from 2023-24. The clauses will offer low-income countries and small island developing states the ability to defer debt repayments in the event of a severe climate shock or natural disaster.\n\nFinancing sustainable growth\n\nUKEF has had a positive impact in developing markets as a pillar of British Investment Partnerships. By crowding in finance for important social and economic infrastructure projects, we act as a bridge between Official Development Assistance and concessional and commercial finance. In 2022-23, we supported 8 infrastructure projects overseas worth £2 billion.\n\nBecause of the nature of our activities, UKEF has a significant impact on progress towards the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Under our Focussed Alignment strategy, we identify projects and supply chains with positive SDG-related impacts that we could support. Our approach focusses on changing behaviour, collecting and measuring data, and communicating our impact.\n\nWe work closely with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, the Department for Business and Trade, and British International Investment to support the government’s international development objectives, which was highlighted in the UK’s new Green Finance Strategy in March 2023.\n\nWe continue to develop our approach to sustainability by:\n\nengaging with host countries to better understand their SDG priorities\n\nlearning from other private sector partners about their approach to sustainability\n\nbuilding our understanding of the potential SDG impact of transactions throughout their lifecycle\n\nenhancing how we communicate our impact on the SDGs and how sustainability objectives interact with UKEF’s overall mission\n\nSpotlight on clean growth\n\nAs the world transitions to a greener future, UKEF is committed to supporting clean growth industries through its full range of products. In 2022-23, we backed a £400 million loan for Johnson Matthey, which will support research and development in sustainable technologies and hydrogen. The financing represented the biggest single investment for a UK company researching hydrogen-based energy.\n\nOur support for low-emission vehicles continued with a guarantee on an £18 million Green Trade Loan and an £8 million Green Bank Guarantee for Wrightbus, which aims to manufacture 3,000 zero-emissions buses by 2024 – enough to comprise 10% of the UK’s total fleet. The new UKEF-backed finance, provided by Barclays, will allow Wrightbus to scale up production to meet demand, including for the world’s first hydrogen-powered, zero-emission double decker bus.\n\nOur growing SME customer base included a range of clean growth transactions. We also provided a new facility for SME Eco Charger, maker of the world’s first all-electric quad bike. Based in Ilfracombe, Devon, Eco Charger was able to double its working capital facility from HSBC thanks to a guarantee from UKEF. This funding flexibility allows the company to import bike frames in larger and regular quantities, speeding up production as it seeks to grow its business in North America.\n\nWe have also aligned our global origination network towards the development of clean growth projects, with a target of at least 50% of new business originating from sectors that contribute to clean and green economic development. This commitment to clean growth is continuously evaluated as prospective projects progress into active transactions, while new opportunities are identified across all sectors.\n\nFiscal responsibility\n\nUKEF operates at no net cost to the taxpayer over time, meeting financial objectives set by HM Treasury to ensure fiscal responsibility while supporting UK exports. We take on risk to stimulate UK exports and, when economic conditions change, pay claims on some of our guarantees and insurance policies.\n\nIt is thanks to our ability to rigorously manage financial risk that we can make sure our taxpayer-backed support goes as far as possible to deliver on the government’s wider objectives. Our approach and results are outlined in more detail by our Chief Risk Officer.\n\nWe also carefully manage our operational risks to prevent fraud and error from business activities across all of our accounts. These risks, and how we recover losses, are outlined in more detail by our Chief Risk Officer and in the Governance Statement.\n\nBoth our trading performance and our cash flow have been strongly positive since 1991, enabling UKEF to make a positive contribution to the Treasury. UKEF has recovered the cost of all claims made against it on a portfolio basis and returned over £2 billion to the Treasury.\n\nSpotlight on aerospace\n\nUKEF has a long and proud history of working with the UK aerospace sector, supporting UK manufacturers such as Airbus, Boeing and Rolls-Royce. The sector is critical to the UK economy, contributing billions in GDP each year and directly providing over 200,000 jobs across all regions of the country.\n\nIn 2022-23, UKEF expanded its impact by supporting its first transaction with Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer, the 3rd largest commercial jet manufacturer in the world. This will support UK exporters to supply critical components and technology for Embraer aircraft, which fly 145 million passengers every year.\n\nWorking with JP Morgan as the arranging and lending bank, UKEF provided a guarantee on an £89 million loan to Embraer. Supplies include Martin-Baker ejector seats, designed and manufactured in the UK for the Tucano aircraft.\n\nIn total in 2022-23, we provided £1.5 billion of support for aerospace exports. This included £548 million of support for Airbus deliveries, a £938 million Export Development Guarantee facility for Rolls-Royce and a £5.7 million loan guarantee for the sale of flight simulators made in Crawley.\n\nThe aerospace sector is aware of the need to decarbonise, with emissions inherent in the sector, investing in new sustainable fuels and technologies. Aligned with this, UKEF has set targets to reduce its emissions exposure from the aerospace sector. These targets are outlined in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report.\n\nEconomic context\n\nInflation and war dominated the global economic outlook in 2022-23. The year began with a fragile recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and a new shock from the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCovid-19 became less of a concern as vaccination rates increased and new variants did not have as much impact as feared. Except for China, most of the world fully reopened, dropping restrictions and other containment measures over the year.\n\nBut high inflation – due in part to the aftermath of the pandemic, in part to the supply disruptions caused by the war and continued Covid-driven lockdowns in China – presented a new challenge for policymakers and our customers. Controlling inflation moved to the forefront of government objectives in 2022, with annual global inflation averaging 8.7% (compared to 4.7% in 2021).\n\nSome countries – particularly energy producers – benefitted from the high commodity prices that both resulted from and fuelled global inflation. Brent crude oil prices reached US$127/bbl in March 2022 and remained above US$100/bbl until August 2022. The outlook now depends on global economic growth, ongoing restrictions on Russian energy exports and production measures by the OPEC+ group of oil producers.\n\nBut most countries have also needed to balance their efforts to reduce inflation, to some degree, against the negative effects of higher debt-servicing costs on households and corporates.\n\nRising interest rates\n\nInterest rates rose very rapidly through 2022-23 – faster than any period since 2008 – as central banks around the world shifted from supporting growth to controlling inflation.\n\nEmerging market central banks responded first and more aggressively but in some cases, particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe, have now stopped or paused their tightening cycles. Developed markets responded later but embarked on significantly more interest rate rises than initially anticipated. In the USA, still the world’s largest consumer and source of demand, the Federal Reserve increased the Fund rate from 0.25-0.50% to 4.75-5.00%.\n\nHigher interest rates are slowing inflation, but it is not yet fully under control. There are signs it is becoming embedded in some countries, as higher prices feed into labour disputes. A key source of inflationary pressure – the war in Ukraine – looks likely to continue much longer than first thought.\n\nUS inflation was still 5% in March 2023, well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects global inflation to remain elevated at around 7% in 2023.\n\nThe endpoint for US monetary tightening will be a key factor in the global economic outlook through 2023. In 2022-23, contrary to historical experience, such rapid tightening of monetary policy did not trigger a recession in the advanced economies around the world. But there is still a risk that further interest rate rises are needed and that they contribute to more defaults – in sovereigns, corporates, or households. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in early March 2023 raised concerns that higher interest rates posed a threat to financial stability.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has signalled that it will soon stop raising rates, but this depends on the evolution of domestic and external inflationary pressures.\n\nEmerging markets\n\nHigher interest rates in advanced economies meant significant capital outflows from emerging market bonds in 2022, with investors seeking safer assets amid fears of a global recession. Many emerging markets saw their currency depreciate, fuelling further domestic inflation and increasing pressure on debt servicing costs and sovereign balance sheets.\n\nThis was especially tough on smaller, weaker emerging markets, given their foreign currency borrowing (largely in US$). An increasing number of countries turned to the IMF for assistance. For example, Sri Lanka, Ghana and Egypt sought support from the IMF due to substantial stresses on their balance of payments, and Ghana and Sri Lanka required debt restructuring.\n\nFitch’s number of sovereign downgrades in 2022 was the 2nd worst on record for emerging markets after the Covid-19 pandemic. The predominantly negative rating actions reflect the highly challenging macroeconomic and financial environment and the limited fiscal resources left to sovereigns after the pandemic and global recession.\n\nThere may be more pressure to come for emerging market currencies, if advanced economy inflation persists and interest rates rise further.\n\nInternational tension\n\nAs the war in Ukraine continues into 2023 and tension across regions intensifies, wider geopolitical fragmentation is expected to continue, causing further supply shocks to the global economy.\n\nTension between the USA and China is likely to lead to further economic fragmentation and ‘friend-shoring’. More protectionist measures from the US could increase trade tension between the USA and Europe. And with more than 50% of semiconductors manufactured in Taiwan, the China-Taiwan dispute could pose risks for semiconductor manufacturing, causing further supply chain disruptions in key sectors.\n\nFood security is likely to remain a concern as long as the war in Ukraine continues, given the previously important role both Russia and Ukraine have played in global grain and fertilizer exports. The pressure this has placed on food exports and prices in some African countries adds to the fiscal pressure on struggling sovereigns and is also increasingly impacted by climate change - related effects on growing conditions.\n\nUK outlook\n\nThe UK economy grew by 4.1% in 2022, but the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) now expects a contraction of 0.2% in 2023. The IMF also thinks that the UK economy will shrink in 2023.\n\nAnnual UK inflation is still well above the Bank of England’s 2% target, at 10.1% in March 2023, and the OBR forecasts 6.1% inflation for 2023. In response, the Bank of England increased interest rates for the 10th consecutive time in February 2023, from 3.5% to 4.0%.\n\nAlthough markets expect little further increase, this will add to pressure on households and businesses through higher borrowing costs.\n\nUKEF outlook\n\nWith higher interest rates and elevated inflation, we anticipate greater risk of default for more indebted sovereigns and corporates in 2023-24.\n\nAs financial conditions are expected to remain tight, debt refinancing will become more difficult, and in some cases inaccessible, for sovereigns and corporates at the lower end of the rating scale, eroding longer-term debt sustainability. Interest rates, however, seem close to peaking and could come down a little over the second half of the financial year – albeit likely in tandem with slower economic growth.\n\nThe challenging macroeconomic environment and tight financial conditions will likely lead to more demand for UKEF’s services in the coming year, as businesses try to recover from this recent period of unprecedented shocks.\n\nExport credit agencies, including UKEF, tend to support commercial banks and exporters through financial and economic disruption to keep credit and trade working – as in the 2008 global financial crisis and the pandemic. UKEF remains well placed and ready to support UK exports. Our effective risk management framework will ensure we can manage the risks of a growing portfolio and meet our financial objectives, despite ongoing global uncertainty.\n\nChief Finance and Operating Officer’s report\n\nFinancial results overview\n\nWe achieved another strong financial performance relative to our recent history, surpassing previous years when considering business issued through our regular accounts and continuing to operate with a modest profit. This success is particularly noteworthy as it comes after two years marked by significant volumes issued through the Temporary Covid-19 Support Account, which ceased accepting new business this year.\n\nNet operating gain:\n\n2022-23: £303 million on a foreign exchange-adjusted basis: £213 million\n\n2021-22: £324 million on a foreign exchange-adjusted basis: £279 million\n\nThis change is driven by a combination of a decrease in net investment return (largely increased loan impairments), increased reserving requirements and additional planned operating costs to support the delivery of the business plan. See the Chief Risk Officer’s report for more details of this years impairments and provisions.\n\nCameron Fox, Chief Finance and Operating Officer\n\nSummary of profit and loss 2022-23 £’000 2021-22 £’000 Income Gross premium income 384,930 566,736 Less ceded to reinsurers (72,061) (125,493) Net premium income 312,869 441,243 Net investment return 56,760 65,222 Net foreign exchange gain 90,412 45,124 Total income 460,041 551,589 Expenses Net claims charge for the year (16,080) (10,078) Changes in insurance liabilities (net of reinsurance) (64,195) (151,284) Staff costs (39,708) (34,756) Other administration and operating costs (37,107) (31,506) Total expenses (157,090) (227,624) Net income/(loss) 302,951 323,965 Net income/(loss) (FX-adjusted) 212,539 278,841\n\nStatement of comprehensive net income for 2022-23\n\nGross premium income – 384,930\n\nLess ceded to reinsurers – (72,061)\n\nNet premium income – 312,869\n\nNet investment return – 56,760\n\nNet foreign exchange gain – 90,412\n\nNet claims change for the year – (16,090)\n\nChanges in insurance liabilities (net of reinsurance) – (64,195)\n\nStaff costs – (39,708)\n\nOther administration and operating costs – (37,107)\n\nComparison of statement of comprehensive net income for 2022-23\n\nGross premium income\n\n2022-23 – 385,000\n\n2021-22 – 567,000\n\nChange – (182,000)\n\nLess ceded to insurers\n\n2022-23 – (72,000)\n\n2021-22 – (125,000)\n\nChange – 53,000\n\nNet premium income\n\n2022-23 – 313,000\n\n2021-22 – 441,000\n\nChange – (128,000)\n\nNet investment return\n\n2022-23 – 57,000\n\n2021-22 – 65,000\n\nChange – (8,000)\n\nNet claims credit/(charge) for the year\n\n2022-23 – (16,000)\n\n2021-22 – (10,000)\n\nChange – (6,000)\n\nNet foreign exchange gain\n\n2022-23 – 90,000\n\n2021-22 – 45,000\n\nChange – 45,000\n\nChanges in insurance liabilities (net of reinsurance)\n\n2022-23 – (64,000)\n\n2021-22 – (151,000)\n\nChange – (87,000)\n\nStaff costs\n\n2022-23 – (40,000)\n\n2021-22 – (35,000)\n\nChange – (5,000)\n\nOther administration and operating costs\n\n2022-23 – (37,000)\n\n2021-22 – (32,000)\n\nChange – (6,000)\n\nNet income\n\n2022-23 – 303,000\n\n2021-22 – 324,000\n\nChange – (21,000)\n\nInsurance and underwriting activity (premium income)\n\nNet premium income revenue earned:\n\n2022-23: £313 million\n\n2021-22: £441 million\n\nNet insurance premiums written decreased by £128 million since 2021-22. This was a result of overall lower levels of business supported this year, as the impact of Covid-19 and the associated record levels of support have normalised, but also due to the nature of business underwritten and timing of that.\n\nFor the breakdown of insurance premiums, see note 3 to the financial statements. Also see note 1 for details of the relevant accounting policies.\n\nNet investment return\n\nNet investment return for export credit guarantees and insurance activities:\n\n* 2022-23: £22 million\n\n2021-22: £14 million\n\nNet investment return for export finance activities:\n\n2022-23: £35 million\n\n2021-22: £51 million\n\nNet investment return mainly comprises interest income receivable for the year, impairments and provisions on loans and receivables.\n\nDecreases in provisions in relation to the aerospace portfolio in the current year are largely responsible for the change in return for export credit guarantees and insurance activities. An increase in impairments on the growing direct lending loan portfolio is mainly responsible for the reduction in return for export finance activities.\n\nFor the breakdown of net investment return, see note 4 to the financial statements. Also see note 1 for details of the relevant accounting policy.\n\nNet claims credit (and provisions for likely claims)\n\nNet claims paid:\n\n2022-23: £122 million\n\n2021-22: £103 million\n\nSince the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, UKEF has experienced a significant increase in claims paid, mainly related to the downturn in the airline sector. Other sectors have so far remained materially unaffected.\n\nA number of airlines’ financial positions have now improved and recoveries have been made. During 2022-23, however, a number of sovereigns including Sri Lanka and Ghana experienced significant economic stress, resulting in an increase in claims paid and, therefore, in provision charges.\n\nSee the Chief Risk Officer’s report for more details of UKEF’s claims position.\n\nAlso see notes 1d, 6 and 11 to the financial statements. Note 1d explains the significant uncertainty arising from UKEF’s underwriting activities. Note 6 provides a breakdown of net claims credit and note 11 provides details of recoverable claims and unrecovered interest.\n\nForeign exchange\n\nDuring the year, sterling depreciated by approximately 6% against the US dollar and nearly 4% against the euro.\n\nNet foreign exchange gain:\n\n2022-23: £90 million\n\n2021-22: £45 million\n\nAs a significant proportion of UKEF’s guarantees, insurance policies and loans are written in foreign currencies (mainly the US dollar but also in euro), UKEF is exposed to foreign currency risk and associated volatility in terms of the financial results.\n\nUKEF is not authorised by HM Treasury to hedge exchange rate exposures.\n\nSee notes 7 and 18 to the financial statements, which include details of the currency profile of our insurance assets, financial instruments and capital loan commitments.\n\nReserving for insurance liabilities\n\n(Net) underwriting funds at year end:\n\n2022-23: £1,498 million\n\n2021-22: £1,434 million\n\nUKEF applies the fund basis of accounting for its medium and long-term business. The increase in funds was the result of new business written in-year.\n\nReleases from the funds during the year (arising from business written in 2013 and 2019) amounted to some £47 million in 2022-23, compared with £40 million in 2021-22. This release (which is a surplus of premium written over risk and costs of writing the business) reflects the quality of the underwriting and credit decisions made in 2013 and 2019.\n\nSee note 16 to the financial statements for the detailed movements in the underwriting funds. Also see note 1E for details of the relevant accounting policy, explaining the fund basis of accounting.\n\nOperating costs\n\n2022-23: £77 million\n\n2021-22: £66 million\n\nA planned increase in staff and project costs, both linked to Business Plan objectives and UKEF’s spending review 2021 settlement, were largely responsible for the increase in operating costs. For more details, see the Our People: Remuneration and Staff report section.\n\nLong-term assets and liabilities\n\nDirect lending loans at year end:\n\n2022-23: £3,032 million\n\n2021-22: £2,808 million\n\nGross recoverable claims at year end:\n\n2022-23: £560 million\n\n2021-22: £534 million\n\nGiven the nature of the business that UKEF supports, the department has a significant holding of long-term assets and liabilities. UKEF’s major asset classes are direct lending loans and recoverable claims (both denominated in a range of currencies, predominantly US dollars).\n\nThe direct lending loan book continued to grow this year. Gross recoverable claims increased, owing to an increase in claims paid and foreign exchange movements.\n\nUKEF’s most significant liability relates to insurance reserving.\n\nFinancial results by account\n\nUKEF currently operates 6 accounts.\n\nAccount 1: Pre - 1991 Guarantees & Insurance -* this relates to guarantees and insurance issued for business before April 1991, and insurance issued by the Insurance Services Group of UKEF (which was privatised on 1 December 1991) for which UKEF retains all contingent liabilities.\n\nAccount 2: Guarantees and Insurance -* relates to the credit risk arising from guarantees and insurance issued for business since April 1991.\n\nAccount 3: National Interest -* relates to guarantees and loans issued for business since April 1991 on the written instruction of ministers, which UKEF’s Accounting Officer had advised did not meet normal underwriting criteria.\n\nAccount 4: Fixed Rate Export Finance -* relates to the provision of Fixed Rate Export Finance (FREF) to banks (now closed to new business), together with arrangements for reducing the funding cost of FREF loans and for certain interest rate derivative arrangements. (The scheme closed in 2011 for new business and during the course of 2022-23 all remaining exposure ran off).\n\nAccount 5: Direct Lending -* relates to the provision of direct lending (in the normal course of business) since 2014.\n\nAccount 6: Temporary Covid-19 Support -* relates to all business underwritten and booked under the Temporary Covid-19 Risk Framework (TCRF) – approved by HM Treasury since 2 April 2020 and closed from new business from 31 July 2022.\n\n2022-23 £m 2021-22 £m 2020-21 £m 2019-20 £m 2018-19 £m Overall value of guarantees and insurance policies issued and effective: New business supported – net of reinsurance – Account 2: Guarantees and Insurance 4,950 5,458 3,818 3,499 3,372 New business supported – net of reinsurance – Account 3: National Interest 1 – – – 2,139 New business supported – net of reinsurance – Account 6: Temporary Covid-19 Support 1,114 1,395 6,826 – – Total new business supported – net of reinsurance 6,065 6,853 10,644 3,499 5,511 Amounts at risk – gross of reinsurance - accounts 2, 3, 6 39,244 34,393 28,834 21,838 21,538 Statement of comprehensive net income: Premium income net of reinsurance 313 441 330 177 332 Staff, other administration and operating costs 77 66 49 41 37 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) 90 45 -138 55 46 Net operating income – total 303 324 -217 217 128 - Account 1: Pre 1991 Guarantees & Insurance 30 18 -4 57 35 - Account 2: Guarantees and Insurance 110 157 -104 88 45 - Account 3: National Interest 11 12 4 -1 0 - Account 4: Fixed Rate Export Finance 0 0 0 0 1 - Account 5: Direct Lending 81 59 -114 73 47 - Account 6: Temporary Covid-19 Support 71 78 1 0 0 Net operating income – foreign exchange – adjusted 213 279 -79 162 82 Statement of cash flows: Claims recoveries – total 94 92 70 71 69 - Account 1: Pre 1991 Guarantees & Insurance 33 30 31 38 39 - Account 2: Guarantees and Insurance 61 62 39 33 30 Interest recoveries in the year – total 31 25 19 31 31 - Account 1: Pre 1991 Guarantees & Insurance 28 24 19 29 30 - Account 2: Guarantees and Insurance 3 1 0 2 1 Claims paid – total 122 103 107 8 0 - Account 2: Guarantees and Insurance 122 103 107 8 0 Net cash flow from operating activities – total 312 576 353 321 484 - Account 1: Pre 1991 Guarantees & Insurance 62 53 49 67 69 - Account 2: Guarantees and Insurance 125 428 168 181 241 - Account 3: National Interest 9 10 38 -11 95 - Account 4: Fixed Rate Export Finance 0 0 0 0 1 - Account 5: Direct Lending 61 85 98 84 78 - Account 6: Temporary Covid-19 Support 55 74 23 – – Statement of financial position: Recoverable claims before provisioning 560 534 600 591 647 - Account 1: Pre 1991 Guarantees & Insurance 198 240 350 402 433 - Account 2: Guarantees and Insurance 362 294 250 189 214 Recoverable claims after provisioning 220 184 179 197 247 - Account 1: Pre 1991 Guarantees & Insurance 69 87 110 145 168 - Account 2: Guarantees and Insurance 151 97 69 52 79 Interest on unrecovered claims after provisioning 73 87 98 118 106 - Account 1: Pre 1991 Guarantees & Insurance 73 87 98 117 105 - Account 2: Guarantees and Insurance 0 0 0 1 1 Underwriting funds – net of reinsurance 1,498 1,434 1,283 958 896 - Account 2: Guarantees and Insurance 1,371 1,318 1,182 873 811 - Account 3: National Interest 85 85 85 85 85 - Account 6: Temporary Covid-19 Support 42 31 16 – – Recoverable capital loans before provisioning 3,032 2,808 2,308 1,327 967 - Account 3: National Interest 1,000 1,000 703 – – - Account 4: Fixed Rate Export Finance 0 1 2 5 10 - Account 5: Direct Lending 2,032 1,807 1,603 1,322 957\n\n(All results rounded to the nearest million)\n\nPre - 1991 Guarantees & Insurance Account\n\nThe main activity related to this account is the administration and collection of the claims paid out against guarantees and insurance policies. All exposure on this account relates to historic claims paid out before 1991.\n\nIn accordance with standard accounting practice, UKEF provides prudently against the possible non-recovery of debts. Where the outlook for recovery improves or worsens, we reduce or increase the level of provision accordingly, releasing profit or loss to the statement of comprehensive net income.\n\nAn increase in net interest income – resulting from provision reductions, recoveries and foreign exchange movements – was responsible for the change in net operating income this year.\n\nThe decrease in gross claims this year was due to recoveries. See the Chief Risk Officer’s report for further details.\n\nNet operating income:\n\n2022-23: £30 million\n\n2021-22: £19 million\n\nRecoveries of claims paid:\n\n2022-23: £33 million\n\n2021-22: £30 million\n\nRecoveries of interest on claims paid:\n\n2022-23: £28 million\n\n2021-22: £24 million\n\nBalances for gross claims:\n\n2022-23: £198 million\n\n2021-22: £240 million\n\nBalances for net claims:\n\n2022-23: £69 million\n\n2021-22: £87 million\n\nInterest on net unrecovered claims:\n\n2022-23: £73 million\n\n2021-22: £87 million\n\nGuarantees & Insurance Account\n\nA decrease in net premium income, driven by lower business supported, was largely responsible for the change in the net operating result combined with fund top-ups (increased reserving requirements).\n\nTotal of guarantees and insurance policies (net of reinsurance) issued and effective during the year:\n\n2022-23: £4,950 million\n\n2021-22: £5,458 million\n\nNet premium income:\n\n2022-23: £228 million\n\n2021-22: £343 million\n\nNet operating income:\n\n2022-23: £110 million\n\n2021-22: £157 million\n\nRelease from funds:\n\n2022-23: £47 million\n\n2021-22: £40 million\n\nClaim recoveries:\n\n2022-23: £61 million\n\n2021-22: £62 million\n\nGross claims balances:\n\n2022-23: £362 million\n\n2021-22: £294 million\n\nNet claims balances:\n\n2022-23: £151 million\n\n2021-22: £97 million\n\nNational Interest Account\n\nThere was only one new deal written during the year 2022-23 in relation to support for an export to Ukraine. See the annexes for business supported for further details.\n\nThe significant extant exposure dates back to 2018-19 and relates to support provided for BAE Systems and MBDA UK, for the provision of military aircraft and related equipment to the State of Qatar.\n\nFixed Rate Export Finance Account\n\nFREF has been closed to new business since 2011, with all remaining exposure running off during the course of 2022-23.\n\nDirect Lending Account\n\nThis account relates to direct lending activity issued in the ordinary course of business.\n\nUKEF’s direct lending capacity for the overall facility is £8 billion. There are 51 signed loans, of which 49 are currently effective.\n\nAn additional 2 loans (Ghana) were assessed as impaired in the year ending 31 March 2023. Five loans in total are now impaired.\n\nSee note 1 to the financial statements for details of the relevant accounting policy.\n\nNet operating gain:\n\n2022-23: £81 million\n\n2021-22: £59 million\n\nThe main driving factor behind this change was a foreign exchange gain of £78 million, compared with a gain of £36 million in 2021-22 (as most of the loans originated were in US dollars).\n\nNet investment return:\n\n2022-23: £19 million\n\n2021-22: £36 million\n\nThis difference is largely due to an increase in impairment losses.\n\nNew loans originated (not including facility increases):\n\n2022-23: 5 (signed and effective)\n\n2021-22: 6 (signed and effective)\n\nLoan impairment on the portfolio:\n\n2022-23: £59 million\n\n2021-22: £38 million\n\nTemporary Covid-19 Support Account\n\nThis account relates to UKEF’s Temporary Covid-19 Risk Framework (TCRF), which closed for new business from 31 July 2022. See the Chief Risk Officer’s report for further commentary on the performance of the TCRF.\n\nNet operating gain:\n\n2022-23: £71 million\n\n2021-22: £78 million\n\nThis change was largely the result of reduced levels of business, as the account is now in run-off.\n\nTotal of guarantees and insurance policies (net of reinsurance) issued and effective:\n\n2022-23: £1,114 million\n\n2021-22: £1,395 million\n\nNet premium income:\n\n2022-23: £85 million\n\n2021-22: £99 million\n\nFinancial reporting changes\n\nAs outlined in note 1 to the financial statements, UKEF currently applies International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39: Financial instruments – recognition and measurement.\n\nAlthough this standard has been replaced by International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9: Financial instruments, the standard will be effective for UKEF at the same time when IFRS 17 becomes effective. This is because UKEF has utilised a temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9.\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board has decided to extend, to 2023, the temporary exemption for insurers to apply IFRS 9 so that both IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 can be applied simultaneously. In the public sector, IFRS 17 application has been delayed by 2 years until 2025-26; therefore UKEF, like other central government departments, will adopt this for an annual period beginning on 1 April 2025. Where UKEF applies IAS 39, the ‘incurred loss’ model is in effect for impairments. This leads to different results than applying IFRS 9, which uses the forward-looking ‘expected loss’ model.\n\nBudgeting framework\n\nUKEF’s expenditure is presented in both the Statement of Outturn against Parliamentary Supply and the financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements apply IFRS as adapted and interpreted by the Financial Reporting Manual, which is produced by HM Treasury.\n\nThe Statement of Outturn against Parliamentary Supply, on the other hand, reports the department’s expenditure into different budgetary categories, each with its own control limits that Parliament has voted on.\n\nThe total amount a department spends is referred to as the Total Managed Expenditure (TME). This is split into:\n\nDepartmental Expenditure Limits (DEL), which covers spending that is subject to limits set in the spending review. Departments may not exceed the limits that they have been set in this budgetary category\n\nAnnually Managed Expenditure (AME), which covers spending that is demand- led or exceptionally volatile in a way that could not be controlled by the department\n\nBoth budgetary categories, DEL and AME, can be further split into resource and capital budgets. Resource budgets capture current expenditure while capital budgets capture new investment and financial transactions. The resource budgets further split into admin and programme budgets.\n\nUKEF’s resource DEL admin budget is a token amount (£1,000), with the gross costs covered from the premium income the department receives. The resource DEL programme budget is nil.\n\nThe capital DEL programme budget, resource AME budget and capital AME programme budget are all relevant to UKEF activities and set through the supply estimates process.\n\nExplanation of variances between estimate and outturn summary\n\nParliament sets a limit on the annual amount of resources and capital that UKEF can consume through the supply estimates process.\n\nIn the absence of any operating income outside the ambit of the supply estimate, UKEF’s net resource outturn and net operating cost or income are identical.\n\nUKEF supports export credit loans denominated in foreign currency and, as a result, is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies. Almost all of UKEF’s premium income arises in currencies other than sterling (mostly US dollar) and net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest is US dollars. As UKEF is not authorised by HM Treasury to hedge exchange rate exposures, ensuring its compliance with Parliamentary voted control totals can be a challenge.\n\nFrom January (the last opportunity to adjust voted control totals) to 31 March each year, there is a risk that exchange rates move and reduce net income by more than the headroom agreed with HM Treasury and voted by Parliament.\n\nFor further variance explanations, see the Statement of Outturn against Parliamentary Supply.\n\nUKEF’s supply estimate vs actual outturn for the year 2022-23\n\nSoPS note Outturn £’000 Estimate £’000 Variance £’000m Resource budget spending Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) SoPS1.1 0 2 2 Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) SoPS1.1 (302,951) 1,109,391 1,412,342 Resource total & net operating cost/ (income) (302,951) 1,109,393 1,412,344 Non-budget/resource total SoPS1.1 0 0 0 Net resource outturn & net operating cost/ (income) (302,951) 1,109,393 1,412,344 Capital budget spending Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) SoPS1.2 1,002 2,216 1,214 Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) SoPS1.2 129,317 798,953 669,636 Capital total payments/(receipts) 130,319 801,169 670,850\n\nChief Risk Officer’s report\n\nThe role of risk management at UKEF is to ensure that all risks, including emerging risks, across UKEF are identified, assessed, evaluated and mitigated where appropriate; and ultimately reported and monitored across the organisation.\n\nWe do this by designing, implementing and constantly reviewing the enterprise risk management framework such that all risks can be reviewed in a structured, consistent and logical fashion, to facilitate sound operational and strategic decision-making.\n\nIn addition to strictly defined requirements laid down under the consent from HM Treasury, UKEF has a control environment to help manage and mitigate our risk exposures. Collaboration and risk management go hand in hand here. Our Enterprise Risk & Credit Committee (ERiCC) is made up of representatives from different teams within UKEF, working together to ensure that our primary risks – defined in our risk taxonomy are appropriately managed.\n\nWe also have a suite of policies, procedures and controls which govern our day-to-day operations.\n\nSamir Parkash, Chief Risk Officer\n\nNote: this section provides a review of developments in 2022-23. It should be read in conjunction with the Governance Statement, which describes UKEF’s enterprise risk management framework and control environment.\n\nTreasury consent and risk appetite\n\nParliament sets a limit on the commitments into which UKEF may enter. This limit is expressed in special drawing rights (SDR), an international reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and set at SDR67.7 billion (approximately £74 billion).\n\nUKEF’s powers may only be exercised with the consent of HM Treasury. The Treasury agrees a standing consent with UKEF, providing parameters within which we can operate without needing to seek explicit approval, as well as our financial objectives and reporting requirements.\n\nUKEF’s financial objectives, set by HM Treasury, are designed to enable us to fulfil our mandate of supporting UK exporters at no net cost to the taxpayer over time while ensuring that credit risk and pricing:\n\nare managed on the basis that UKEF should receive a return that is at least adequate to cover the cost of the risks it is assuming\n\ndo not expose the taxpayer to the risk of excessive loss\n\ncover UKEF’s operating costs\n\nFor the outturn against all our financial objectives for the financial year 2022-23.\n\nFinancial objectives\n\nPremium-to-risk ratio (PRR): the premium we charge must reflect the risk taken. Each month, we must show that the premium charged on the overall business issued, or forecast to be issued in the financial year, will be at least 1.35 times greater than an agreed level of expected and unexpected loss measured for each transaction at the time of pricing.\n\nPricing adequacy index (PAI): the premium we charge must be sufficient for us to operate at no net cost to the taxpayer over time. While the PRR is measured only over the current financial year, our PAI considers a 5-year timescale, applied across 3 accounting periods:\n\nthe 2 previous and the present financial years\n\nthe previous, current and next financial years\n\nthe present and the next 2 financial years\n\nFor each period, UKEF must demonstrate that the actual and forecast premium will cover and exceed the cost of doing business- meaning administration costs and an agreed level of possible losses.\n\nBusiness and premium forecasts are based on the judgements of our underwriters, who draw on transaction pipeline information, market intelligence and the likelihood of transactions materialising within the current or future financial years. We also perform regular sensitivity analyses to supplement these central forecasts and test the robustness of forecast financial performance against our PRR and PAI targets.\n\nMaximum commitment: the total amount of nominal credit risk exposure that the department may incur; previously set at £50 billion under the HM Treasury consent and now at £60 billion as of 31 March 2023\n\nRisk appetite limit: a form of economic capital limit of £5 billion, set at £6 billion as of 31 March 2023\n\nReserve index: an index that measures whether UKEF has accumulated enough reserves over time to cover its possible credit losses at the 77.5 percentile on its portfolio loss distribution\n\nThese objectives do not apply to our Temporary Covid-19 Risk Framework portfolio or National Interest Account, business issued on the written direction of ministers.\n\nPricing\n\nWe set risk-based premium rates for all of our products. Our pricing methodologies and parameters are reviewed annually by ERiCC, endorsed by the Board’s Risk Committee and agreed by HM Treasury.\n\nA key principle of our pricing is to maintain a level playing field. We therefore operate within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Arrangement (a framework for the orderly use of officially supported export credits), where it applies. This requires all export credit agencies (ECAs) to charge risk-based premiums sufficient to cover their long-term operating costs and credit losses.\n\nIt mirrors the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, which classifies export credit guarantee programmes that do not cover their long-term operating costs and losses as “prohibited subsidies”.\n\nIt is also our objective to support UK exporters’ competitiveness, and it is our policy to set the lowest possible premium rates. In doing so we take into account:\n\nthe minimum rates set out by the OECD (where applicable – and in practice, the vast majority of our medium/long-term transactions are priced at these rates).\n\nour international obligations, including subsidy rules\n\nno individual premium being below the expected loss of the associated transaction\n\naggregate premiums satisfying our financial objectives\n\nEconomic capital and the risk appetite limit\n\nEconomic capital (often referred to as capital at risk or CaR) is a measure of risk based on potential future losses. It can be considered as a buffer to cover unexpected losses over a defined future period at a specified confidence level.\n\nExpected loss is a calculation of anticipated average loss over a defined period, based on historical experience. Expected losses essentially represent a ‘cost of doing business’, implying that when a financial institution assumes credit risk, it should always seek to charge an amount at least sufficient to cover the expected loss associated with the relevant loan, guarantee or insurance policy.\n\nUnexpected loss accounts for the potential for actual losses to exceed expected losses, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in calculating future losses. Unexpected loss will tend to increase if a portfolio has high risk concentrations and/or the risks in the portfolio are strongly correlated. UKEF defines unexpected loss as the difference between the portfolio expected loss and the 99.1% value of the loss distribution.\n\nThe risk appetite limit set by HM Treasury means that UKEF must manage its credit risk-taking activities such that total losses, as modelled by our portfolio risk management simulation model, will not (with a 99.1% degree of certainty) exceed £5 billion (or £6 billion as of 31 March 2023).\n\nIn other words, at no time should portfolio expected loss, plus provisions against claims already paid, plus portfolio unexpected loss, exceed that limit. (This limit excludes business transacted in our Temporary Covid-19 Support Account or, under ministerial direction, in our National Interest Account, for example in Ukraine.)\n\nRisk taxonomy\n\nThe UKEF enterprise risk management framework sets out how the business consistently manages risk across all primary risk categories and how it maintains oversight of the risks.\n\nIn 2022-23, we completed a number of initiatives to enhance the way we identify, monitor and manage our risks. These include:\n\na fully revised and updated risk taxonomy\n\na prototype to measure our position against the defined risk appetite for each of our primary risks\n\ncontinuing to develop our enterprise risk management reporting\n\nadditional independent oversight of our control environment certificate (CEC)\n\nTo achieve its business objectives, UKEF is exposed to various risks . These risks can be a result of both internal and external factors.\n\nOur risk taxonomy identifies 6 primary risk categories. These provide senior management with a structured approach to managing known and emerging risks across UKEF. Each primary risk is owned by a member of the Executive Committee (or in some cases two members), who has executive oversight of that risk and is responsible for managing it within UKEF’s risk appetite.\n\nSome of the risks UKEF takes support our business plan: credit risk, for example. Other risks are inherent in our business activities, such as operational risk and the risk of fraud or error. However, these risks are managed via the control framework that operates across the department.\n\nWe consider conduct and reputational risks on a transversal basis rather than as a separate risk type, as these risks can crystallise as a cause or consequence of any of the risks in our taxonomy.\n\nPrimary risk Definition Strategic & business risk The risk of direct or indirect loss arising from suboptimal business strategy or failure to respond positively to changes in the business environment Political risk The risk that political decisions, events or conditions will have a significant impact on the department’s strategic objectives and priorities Sustainability risk The risk that UKEF’s activities undermine its sustainability commitments or compromise its current and future license to operate Financial risk (including credit & market risk) The risk of claims being made against UKEF, and of it suffering ultimate loss arising from defaults by counterparties against which UKEF has a financial exposure The risk of financial records not being adequately maintained Compliance & legal risks The risk of being exposed to censure, financial loss, civil or criminal proceedings due to failing to comply with applicable laws, regulations or legal obligations Operational risk (including infrastructure & cyber risk) The risk of direct or indirect financial losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events\n\nThe risks that UKEF manages can change quickly in the environment where we operate. Therefore we actively review and enhance our enterprise risk management framework and policies to make sure they remain dynamic and appropriate for the risks under management. We are proactive about horizon scanning to assess the internal and external risk environments and consider our risks with both a forward view and lessons learned. Each risk type has an appropriate risk monitoring and reporting structure with responsibility to a designated committee.\n\nMore detail on UKEF’s governance and internal control environment, including risks related to the performance of internal controls, can be found in the Governance Statement. And note 18 to the financial statements describes the nature and extent of the risks for UKEF arising from financial instruments and insurance contracts.\n\nRisk Management And Controls\n\nFinancial risk management\n\nCredit risk is the principal source of financial risk for UKEF.\n\nAll material credit risks must be approved by the CEO, ERiCC or a designated member of the Business or Risk Management Groups within appropriate delegated authority. Further, UKEF may not give an individual commitment in excess of £200 million without the agreement of HM Treasury. Once approved, we regularly monitor credit exposures at both the portfolio and individual transaction level. We also meet with our largest corporate and sovereign obligors to discuss any risks.\n\nERiCC oversees portfolio-level monitoring, keeping the weighted average credit rating of the UKEF portfolio firmly in mind. This includes stress testing and scenario analysis every 6 months and a monthly review of portfolio movements, particularly focussing on exposure, expected loss and unexpected loss changes. Monthly management information reports the performance of the credit portfolio against our financial objectives. Detailed portfolio packs are presented to the Risk Committee on a regular basis.\n\nWe regularly update the ratings allocated on the back of meetings with sovereigns and corporates to countries and individual obligors, which feed through to the transactional level.\n\nWhere these ratings become stressed, UKEF maintains watch lists of obligors. If an obligor becomes so stressed that a significant increase in credit risk occurs or is expected – for example, if the credit of a non-sovereign borrower deteriorates such that UKEF might reasonably expect to pay out under a guarantee or insurance policy – then the risk is managed by a dedicated unit within the Risk Management Group.\n\nPortfolio modelling\n\nUKEF uses its own portfolio risk simulation model (PRISM) to model credit risk at the portfolio level and to produce portfolio loss distribution curves. We also use the model:\n\nfor stress testing\n\nto simulate the extent and timing of potential cash outflows as a result of claims payments\n\nto inform cash flow forecasts\n\nfor liquidity management\n\nRisk concentrations\n\nGiven UKEF’s role, it is inevitable that we will have risk concentrations in our portfolio.\n\nOur portfolio modelling quantifies those concentration risks and helps to determine the maximum amount of exposure UKEF might assume on a single obligor or group of related obligors.\n\nERiCC will only consider approving a case or making a positive recommendation to the CEO if it is satisfied that a given level of credit exposure calculated using this modelling will not threaten any of the department’s financial objectives.\n\nPractical means of reducing risk concentration include (re)insurance and counter-guarantees from the private (re)insurance market, as well as from other ECAs. UKEF may seek (re)insurance when it is acting as lead ECA in a transaction where goods or services are sourced both from the UK and from other countries.\n\nModelling assumptions\n\nOu"
