        "text": "Export Credits Guarantee Department (UK Export Finance) Annual Report and Accounts 2021-22\n\nAnnual Report presented to Parliament pursuant to section 7(5) of the Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991.\n\nAccounts presented to the House of Commons pursuant to section 6(4) of the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000.\n\nAccounts presented to the House of Lords by Command of Her Majesty.\n\nOrdered by the House of Commons to be printed on 28 June 2022.\n\nThis is part of a series of departmental publications which, along with the Main Estimates 2021-22, the document Public Expenditure: Statistical Analyses 2021-22, and the Supply Estimates 2021-22: Supplementary Budgetary Information, present the government’s outturn for 2021-22 and planned expenditure for 2021-22.\n\nHC 191\n\nMinisters’ foreword\n\nThe UK is a champion of free trade. We’re an independent trading nation open to markets on every continent. The government has opened the door to the world – now we need to help businesses walk through it. That’s why we provide the finance to make trade happen, and we’re doing it better than ever.\n\nIn the government’s Export Strategy, we fired the starting gun on the race to reach a trillion pounds of UK exports by 2030. The UK is now at the centre of a network of modern Free Trade Agreements, worth nearly £800 billion of UK bilateral trade in 2020. Businesses need to have the right finance in place to capitalise on these deals, which is why UKEF is so important.\n\nDuring the year UKEF underwent radical changes in response to domestic and global challenges, emerging more flexible, more competitive and stronger. It issued more than £7.4 billion worth of finance and insurance for 545 exporters – without a penny for overseas fossil fuel projects.\n\nUKEF has expanded its support with new and upgraded products. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are benefiting from the new General Export Facility with nearly £250 million of working capital loans. The new and expanded Export Development Guarantee is also providing financial security to many of the UK’s biggest exporters, with billions of pounds now provided, and to the thousands of companies in their supply chains.\n\nIt is not just the UK that stands to benefit from our exports. We need a global green industrial revolution that will secure the long-term supply of renewable energy to meet the world’s net zero ambitions.\n\nThe crisis in Ukraine has shown that green energy self-sufficiency is not only good for the planet, but also in our own national interest. As the UK’s export credit agency, UKEF led by example, committing to reaching net zero by 2050 and bringing together 39 of its peers to end support for fossil fuel projects by the end of 2022.\n\nUKEF moved swiftly with the rest of the government to end support for overseas fossil fuel projects and shift its gaze to turning the UK’s green potential into a powerful reality. It provided £3.6 billion for sustainable projects in 2021, the most ever recorded. And there is more to come. Prosperity through sustainability is at the heart of UKEF’s new mission statement, and it now offers improved terms for green economy exporters through its Export Development Guarantee.\n\nUKEF is uniquely placed to help exporters across the country achieve their full potential. Working closely with the Department for Trade and across Whitehall, it will continue to level up opportunities as it has done for the last 102 years. Behind our goal of £1 trillion of exports are countless companies, communities and livelihoods. A UKEF that is energised and enhanced is vital for supporting all 3, ensuring what is made in the UK is sold to the world.\n\nAnne-Marie Trevelyan, Secretary of State for International Trade\n\nMike Freer, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State\n\n28 June 2022\n\nChair’s statement\n\nAfter 2 years of living and working with coronavirus, it’s been a pleasure to see UKEF staff in person again. I’m enjoying the office buzzing again with activity.\n\nUKEF has grown markedly during the pandemic. The department is more flexible and robust than ever before. UKEF issued more than £7.4 billion worth of finance and insurance in the last financial year, with £3.6 billion on sustainable projects in 2021 according to an independent assessment of deals backed by export credit agencies (ECAs).[footnote 1] A truly remarkable set of achievements.\n\nUKEF’s sustainable initiatives involve more than just numbers. The department is fully aligned with the government’s policy on fossil fuels, as shown by our deals, our ambitious Climate Change Strategy and our advocacy for change at COP26. It’s a credit to all those involved from UKEF at COP26 that we inspired 39 other ECAs and multilateral development banks to join us in pledging to end support for fossil fuel projects from the end of 2022.\n\nThe new products we’ve developed have enabled UKEF to widen its support for new sectors, as well as for UK companies seeking to make the transition to cleaner ways of working.\n\nI’d like to pay tribute to the UKEF staff. They continued to show incredible flexibility amid challenging conditions and yet their performance never wavered. Their attitude has been first class, and this can be seen in our 2021 People Survey results, which showed our highest ever engagement score of 74%, far above the Civil Service average score of 66%.\n\nUKEF has historically been a diverse department and I’m proud that it remains the most ethnically diverse department in the Civil Service, with 33.1% of staff from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nI said last year that I was keen for the department to improve its gender balance. It’s a great achievement that the proportion of female staff is higher than ever before, while the percentage of Senior Civil Servants identifying as women has increased to 33%. We must work harder to improve the gender balance further and I welcome the department’s target to have at least 45% female employees by 2024.\n\nI would like to thank my fellow non-executive Board members for their diligence and commitment this year. We are very fortunate to have such a wealth of expertise on the UKEF Board, with senior executive and non-executive experience across the public and private sectors.\n\nOur Board saw Oliver Peterken step down this year: Oliver joined us in 2017 and also served with distinction as Chair of the Risk Committee. On behalf of the Board, I thank him for the dedication, challenge and wise counsel he has brought to his role. The Board has also seen the additions this year of Jacqueline Keogh, a Senior Advisor at the Financial Conduct Authority, and Tim Frost, co-founder of Cairn Capital and a non-executive director of Cairn Capital Group Limited. Welcome!\n\nIt would be remiss of me not to mention another departure this year. After 24 years with UKEF, the Head of Business Group, Gordon Welsh, retired. Gordon will be hugely missed and on behalf of the Board I’d like to thank him for his remarkable service and wish him a very happy retirement. I look forward to working with Tim Reid, who has joined from HSBC as Director of Business Group.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank Louis Taylor and the executive team for their hard work, energy and diligence over the last year – none of the great successes outlined in this report would have been possible without them.\n\nNoël Harwerth\n\nChair\n\n28 June 2022\n\nUK Export Finance performance overview\n\nWho we are\n\nUK Export Finance (UKEF) is the UK’s export credit agency and a government department, strategically and operationally aligned with the Department for International Trade.\n\nUKEF is the operating name of the Export Credits Guarantee Department.\n\nOur mission\n\nWe advance prosperity by ensuring no viable UK export fails for lack of finance or insurance, doing that sustainably and at no net cost to the taxpayer. We help UK companies:\n\nwin export contracts by providing attractive financing terms to their buyers\n\nfulfil export contracts by supporting working capital loans and contract bonds\n\nget paid for export contracts by providing insurance against buyer default\n\nHow we do it\n\nWe provide insurance, guarantees and loans where the private sector will not, backed by the strength of the government’s balance sheet. We also help companies find support from the private sector. Our work means that:\n\nmore UK companies realise their ambitions for international growth\n\nmore jobs in the UK are supported\n\noverall UK exports are higher\n\nWe exist to complement, not compete with, the private sector and work with around 100 private credit insurers and lenders. We help to make exports happen which otherwise might not, helping UK exporters and their supply chains grow their business overseas. In this way, we provide security of support through economic cycles and market disruptions.\n\nPerformance\n\nThis section provides a summary of UK Export Finance, its purpose and structure, its financial performance relating to its objectives, organisational risks and focus for the year ahead. UK Export Finance is a self-funding, income generating department and its work has been guided by its financial objectives, which are outlined below.\n\n2021-22 in figures\n\n£7.4 billion business supported\n\n£4.7 billion for overseas projects\n\nPledged Net Zero by 2050\n\n£3.6 billion for sustainable projects in 2021\n\n£1.4 billion COVID-19 support (TCRF)\n\n545 companies directly supported\n\nAnnual milestones\n\n2021\n\nTrade Finance Global Export Credit Agency of the Year (2021)\n\nApril\n\nEnded support for new overseas fossil fuel projects\n\nMay\n\nIssued our first ever General Export Facility to West Midlands technology business Simworx\n\nWon TXF Renewables Export Finance Deal of the Year for Changhua 1 & 2a Offshore Wind\n\nJune\n\nSigned a green partnership with ORE Catapult to promote the expertise of the UK offshore wind sector\n\nProvided our first Standard Buyer Loan Guarantee to Northern Irish manufacturer CDE Global\n\nPublished our first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report\n\nJuly\n\nProvided bond support to First Subsea Ltd, allowing the Scottish energy firm to transition to renewables and secure £12 million of export orders\n\nWon TXF Healthcare Export Finance Deal of the Year for NMS Hospital Project Côte d’Ivoire\n\nAugust\n\nBacked a landmark £430 million green transition loan for Wood Plc to enhance its clean growth exports and develop green jobs\n\nAnnounced a new partnership with the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) to support projects in the region\n\nSeptember\n\nCommitted to reaching net zero in our first Climate Change Strategy\n\nIssued our first clean growth loan to support completion of Bee’ah’s award-winning green headquarters in Sharjah\n\nOctober\n\nAligned OECD export credit agencies behind new climate initiative to end export credit support for unabated coal-fired power plants\n\nNovember\n\nLaunched new and enhanced products in the Export Strategy\n\nAt COP26, helped secure a commitment by 39 of our peers to join us in ending support for new fossil fuel projects\n\nProvided £217 million in financing for a 1.3GW solar project in Türkiye, one of the largest in the world\n\nDecember\n\nAt our 4th annual customer conference, signed a new partnership with General Electric and accredited the first non-bank lender, Newable, to our General Export Facility\n\nIncreased the cover limit for Ukraine to £3.5 billion to support priority sectors including defence\n\nReceived 9/10 for our product offering from the British Exporters Association\n\n2022\n\nJanuary\n\nAnnounced over £500 million of support in Africa at the Africa Investment Conference\n\nSupported Jaguar Land Rover’s electric vehicle plans with a £500 million Export Development Guarantee\n\nAchieved our highest-ever score for employee engagement in the Civil Service People Survey\n\nFebruary\n\nBoosted the Scottish fishing industry with a £15 million General Export Facility to Peterhead-based Denholm Seafoods\n\nMarch\n\nWon TXF Rail Transport Export Finance Deal of the Year for Ankara-Izmir High-Speed Railway\n\nChief Executive’s report\n\nIn another year of economic uncertainty, UKEF has once again demonstrated its worth – adeptly deploying our expertise to unlock finance, support exporters and promote British businesses while protecting the interests of the taxpayer.\n\nThe global trading landscape is changing. Supply chains are still recovering from pandemic restrictions to the movement of goods and people, while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will have lasting economic and geo-political impacts. In spite of this, global trade is rebounding, reaching a record of $28.5 trillion in 2021 – a 25% increase on the previous year.[footnote 2]\n\nWe have been agile and responsive to the market’s needs, issuing £7.4 billion (£8.8 billion pre-reinsurance) in support to exporters of all sizes in 2021-22. This is a historically large number, especially absent any support for overseas fossil fuel projects, exceeded only by 2020-21 because of the emergency support businesses needed throughout the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe exports we support have been levelling up opportunities across the UK for over 100 years, with our support touching thousands of companies every year, both directly and indirectly. Last year alone, we estimate we supported over 72,000 UK jobs and added a gross value of £4.3 billion to the economy. This means more money in people’s pockets and continued job security for British workers, all in support of the UK’s international ambitions.\n\nFinance makes trade happen, which is why UKEF’s finance offer remains at the heart of the government’s new Export Strategy – including enhancements to our products. In 2019, we revolutionised the way we support exports by offering general working capital support through the Export Development Guarantee (EDG). Since then, this immensely successful product has provided £10.6 billion in support to some of the UK’s largest employers, including British Airways, Rolls-Royce and Nissan – businesses that each account for tens of thousands of UK jobs across the country.\n\nWe have now gone one step further, expanding EDG eligibility to:\n\nUK companies with credible plans to export\n\noverseas firms seeking finance to establish themselves in the UK and export from our shores\n\nInward investment stimulates economic growth and job creation. By backing foreign companies to come to the UK, we can boost the UK supply chain in high-growth sectors. Stimulated to grow, those supply chain businesses may themselves go on to export.\n\nA greener future\n\n2021 was also the year where we led the world of export finance into a greener future. In our new Climate Change Strategy, we committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, becoming one of the first export credit agencies (ECAs) to launch a net zero strategy. Not only is this absolutely vital for our planet, but it is also in the UK’s interest as we develop supply chains in net zero technologies.\n\nOur mandate is to support viable UK exports, but sustainability is increasingly at the heart of the viability assessment. UKEF’s revised mission statement, which I am pleased to announce here, makes explicit the increasing centrality of sustainability to our business.\n\nThis is why we used our platform at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow to bring our peers and private sector institutions along with us. Following our lead, the private market has pledged $130 trillion of capital to transition the global economy to net zero by 2050, while 39 other ECAs and multilateral development banks joined us in pledging to end support for fossil fuel projects from the end of 2022.\n\nWe are particularly focussed on clean growth and renewable energy exports. In 2021, we increased our support for sustainable and clean growth projects to £3.6 billion, according to TXF’s ranking of export credit agency supported deals. A £1.7 billion loan was secured for a high-speed rail line in Türkiye with UKEF backing – our largest ever civil infrastructure deal – which will provide a faster, lower carbon alternative to current air and road routes.\n\nAnd there is more to come. We have a multi-billion-pound pipeline of deals in countries around the world – with significant opportunities across clean growth sectors.\n\nOur revised mission statement\n\nWe advance prosperity by ensuring no viable UK export fails for lack of finance or insurance, doing that sustainably and at no net cost to the taxpayer.\n\nWhat do we mean by “prosperity”?\n\nAs an export credit agency and a government department, delivering prosperity means supporting growth in exports and investment, bringing jobs and better living standards to communities across all nations and regions of the UK and internationally.\n\nBy helping to fill the financing gap in global trade, we open up international opportunities for UK businesses, enable them to scale up and internationalise, and develop supply chains and infrastructure around the world. All this underpins prosperity at home and abroad through the economic cycle.\n\nWhat do we mean by “sustainably”?\n\nFor UKEF, undertaking our business sustainably means taking account of factors beyond the purely financial. This includes relevant laws and regulations, government policies, international agreements which apply to the operations of export credit agencies, good international industry practice and standards relating to – for example – environmental, social and human rights impacts, climate change, debt sustainability and financial crime.\n\nWe recognise that our activities can contribute to financial and non-financial sustainability impacts through the support we provide to UK exporters. UKEF is committed to reducing the negative sustainability impacts associated with our financing activities, promoting high standards of environmental and social performance, and maximising opportunities for positive impacts.\n\nSupporting small businesses\n\nWe support companies of all sizes, but the majority of the companies that we support with a UKEF product are small businesses. 81% of the companies we supported directly with a UKEF product in 2021-22 were for small and medium-sized enterprises, with our General Export Facility (GEF) providing a welcome boost.\n\nSince we made GEF available in March 2021, we have issued over £180 million of support using the scheme to unlock almost £250 million of working capital loans, boosting smaller businesses across the land: from online retail in South Wales and steel manufacturing on Teesside to offshore wind in Aberdeenshire. We have recently onboarded our first non-bank lender to this product – widening access to GEF even further, levelling up opportunity and driving prosperity across the UK.\n\nStrengthening connections\n\nWe are adapting the way we do our business to meet today’s realities and tomorrow’s challenges. Our new Digital, Data and Technology Division is boosting our digital capability, placing the customer at the centre of everything we do. The recently formed Strategy, Policy and Climate Change Directorate is making sure we fully address the risks and opportunities created by climate change and have the right long-term strategy in place to fulfil our mandate, while strengthening our collaboration across government.\n\nWorking with HM Treasury, we extended the use of our Temporary COVID-19 Risk Framework (TCRF) through to July 2022. This boost to our risk appetite limits allows us to support customers whose liquidity and cash flow profiles had been badly affected by the pandemic’s economic fallout. Through TCRF, we have provided £8.2 billion since its inception to help exporters keep trading, protecting jobs at those firms and their suppliers.\n\nWe have connected more closely with our sister financial institutions, the British Business Bank and UK Infrastructure Bank, to gain a deeper understanding of how our offers align and complement one another. Similarly, we have deepened our collaboration with the Department for International Trade (DIT). As sister departments, we work hand-in-hand to present a truly joined-up service for British exporters – cooperation strengthened by the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in March 2021. [footnote 3]\n\nWe are also intensifying our work with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, collaborating effectively to promote Global Britain and UKEF’s finance offer overseas; and working closely with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to support the net zero and decarbonisation agenda.\n\nAs a newly independent member of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, we intensified our cooperation with other ECAs and their guardian authorities to preserve a level playing field globally. We pushed forward the review of the Coal-Fired Power Sector Understanding and worked with the UK government’s COP Unit on the Statement on International Public Support for the Clean Energy Transition to help end the global financing of unabated fossil fuels through public funds, including export credits, by the end of 2022.\n\nHow we calculate the number of exporters we have directly supported\n\nBy providing insurance, guarantees and loans, and by helping companies find the support they need from the private sector, UKEF makes exports happen which might not happen otherwise.\n\nOur direct support therefore includes firms that are paid directly by a drawdown from a UKEF facility, where the buyer is sourcing goods and services from the UK as a result of UKEF’s intervention.\n\nFor companies to be included in our ‘directly supported’ figure, we require evidence of them securing business on projects we are supporting. This is included as a condition of our support when we agree transactions for overseas projects.\n\nWe also include private market assists when UKEF engagement has had a material contribution to an export receiving support from the private sector.\n\nThe way ahead\n\nWe have achieved so much in recent years, but there is much more to come. Our role in government has never been greater. And with the continued expansion of our international network, which now stands at 18, with representatives on every continent, our voice overseas has never been stronger.\n\nThanks to the 20% increase in our budget in the 2021 Spending Review, we have the confidence, capacity and capability to continue to manage sustained higher business volumes and increasing complexity in our work.\n\nWe’re also vigilant about the risks ahead but are confident that we have the controls to manage them. Overall, this year, our performance in managing financial risk was extremely strong as we protect the interests of the UK taxpayer.\n\nWith access to manufacturers, airlines, remarketers, and industry players we have made huge strides on the 115 aircraft in our portfolio which were in insolvency protection in June 2020. Of those, nearly 100 have been successfully restructured. Paying out claims when they are needed while recovering what we are owed brings value to our guarantee. It proves our model works.\n\nAll of this success is underpinned by the hard work, diligence and expertise of UKEF staff. Their commitment to making UKEF the best ECA in the world continues to pay dividends, helping UK companies trade in a volatile landscape, defending our portfolio and adapting our offer to support the technologies of tomorrow.\n\nCase study: Building a high-speed railway in Türkiye\n\nIn 1856, the Ottoman Railway Company opened Türkiye’s first railway to improve trade routes to its ports. One hundred and sixty years later, a new high-speed rail line aims to enhance these vital trade routes once again, with a £1.7 billion loan backed by UKEF through its Buyer Credit Scheme.\n\nThis is a landmark deal with strong green credentials. It is also UKEF’s largest ever civil infrastructure loan guarantee.\n\nThe project is part of Türkiye’s plan to transform its high-speed rail network. The new 503-kilometre electric-powered railway line will connect the capital, Ankara, to the port city of Izmir. When complete, the new line will cut journey times, making it the most convenient option for travellers while helping to fulfil the climate change commitments Türkiye made at COP26.\n\nUKEF’s involvement has secured half a billion pounds’ worth of business for UK suppliers, who will be exporting everything from the rails, points, signalling and communications equipment to vital insurance and freight services.\n\nReinsurance support was sought from international export credit agencies SACE in Italy, SERV in Switzerland and OeKB in Austria, to reduce the risk to the UK taxpayer, making UKEF’s total liability worth close to £1.1 billion.\n\nHow we support jobs and the economy\n\n2021-22\n\nUKEF’s contribution to the UK economy is measured through direct and indirect impacts.\n\nDirect impact relates to the jobs and economic activity (production of goods and services) supported with the direct beneficiaries of UKEF’s loans, guarantees and insurance.\n\nIndirect impact captures the jobs and economic activity supported in the wider UK supply chain. Suppliers to the direct beneficiaries of UKEF’s financial support will employ staff and contribute to gross value added, and will also use suppliers in turn.\n\nDirect impact : UKEF facilitates exports, which supports jobs and economic activity within the beneficiary company.\n\nIndirect impact (supply chain): The beneficiary company purchases inputs from suppliers who employ staff and support economic activity in the UK.\n\nTotal impact:\n\nEconomic activity\n\nWages\n\nProfits\n\nEmployment\n\n72,000 Full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs\n\n32,000 indirect\n\n40,000 direct\n\nUKEF’s economic impact analysis[footnote 4] uses a similar methodology as US EXIM. See the analysis for more about the methodology, definitions and a full breakdown of GVA, including net taxes on production.\n\n£4.3 billion gross value added[footnote 5]\n\n£2.0bn indirect\n\n£2.3bn direct\n\nof which £2.8bn in wages[footnote 6]\n\n£1.24bn indirect\n\n£1.54bn direct\n\nof which £1.4bn in profits[footnote 7]\n\n£0.76bn indirect\n\n£0.68bn direct\n\nUKEF’s support contributed up to £4.3bn to the UK economy in 2021-22, economic output of Darlington and Harrogate combined.\n\nSupporting exports through the trade cycle\n\nNet operating profit:\n\n2021-22: net operating profit of £324 million for the year ended 31 March 2022, compared with a net operating loss of £217 million the previous year\n\nFX-adjusted net operating profit of £279 million\n\nThis change is primarily due to improvements in outlook and performance for UKEF’s existing portfolio, which was hit heavily by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic last year, especially in the aerospace sector. It is set against many years of low claims and operating profits which will cover this cost over the business cycle.\n\nMany of the loans we support by providing guarantees will be repaid over more than 10 years. In the event of defaults, we will seek to make recoveries. This means that final business losses, as a result of unrecovered claims paid, can take many years to assess.\n\nFor this reason, it can be illuminating to assess our performance ‘through the business cycle’. This accounts for the way our business levels and claims rise and fall depending on the impact of market disruptions on UK trade. For example, claims payments and recoveries reported in any single year actually reflect the performance of business exposures written over a longer period of time.\n\nUKEF acts as a guarantor or insurer under its export guarantee and insurance policies, and pays claims in a timely manner to protect its customers from financial loss. UKEF has protected its customers this year – as we have done in previous crises – as both demand for export insurance and claims increased.\n\nPricing of risk\n\nWe support UK exporter competitiveness through charging only the lowest premium rates permissible, subject to meeting our financial objectives and aligning with our international obligations, most notably the minimum rates set out by the OECD. Our pricing methodology is described in more detail in Pricing.\n\nOur accounts\n\nUKEF currently operates 6 accounts (business segments), with each defined by the nature of business supported by the department.\n\nAccount 1 relates to guarantees and insurance issued for business before April 1991, and insurance issued by the Insurance Services Group of UKEF (which was privatised on 1 December 1991) for which UKEF retains all contingent liabilities.\n\nAccount 2 relates to the credit risk arising from guarantees and insurance issued for business since April 1991.\n\nAccount 3 relates to guarantees and loans issued for business since April 1991 on the written instruction of ministers, which UKEF’s Accounting Officer had advised did not meet normal underwriting criteria.\n\nAccount 4 relates to the provision of Fixed Rate Export Finance (FREF) to banks (now closed to new business), together with arrangements for reducing the funding cost of FREF loans and for certain interest rate derivative arrangements.\n\nAccount 5 relates to the provision of direct lending (in the normal course of business) since 2014.\n\nAccount 6 relates to all business underwritten and booked under the Temporary COVID-19 Risk Framework (TCRF – approved by HM Treasury since 2 April 2020).\n\nHistorical financial performance\n\nWe take on risk to stimulate UK exports. So when a crisis hits, claims are made on some of our guarantees and insurance policies.\n\nWe’ve paid out more claims in the last two years than we did in the previous 12 years combined. But through our experience, preparation by collecting premium income when claims were low, and effectively recovering what we’re owed, we still operate at no net cost to the UK taxpayer.\n\nBoth our trading performance and cash flow have been strongly positive since 1991, enabling UKEF to make a positive contribution to the Treasury. UKEF has recovered the cost of every claim made against it on a portfolio basis and returned over £2 billion to the Treasury.\n\nHow we delivered in 2021-22\n\nSupporting a Global Britain\n\nWhat we said we would do\n\nSupport exports from companies of all sizes, enabling them to take advantage of new and existing Free Trade Agreements\n\nBuild our business pipeline through our marketing and communications activities, and through the appointment of new International Export Finance Executives (IEFEs)\n\nRecruit and embed our new stakeholder engagement team to grow relationships with the private sector and other ECAs\n\nWhat we did\n\nProvided £7.4 billion for UK exporters, 81% of which were SMEs\n\nAppointed 5 new IEFEs in the Middle East, Europe and Africa and developed a rich

In line with UKEF’s Spending Review commitments, her 5 main expectations for UKEF in 2022-23 are as follows.\n\n1 - Implementing the Export Strategy: made in the UK, sold to the world\n\nIn 2022-23, we will:\n\nWork closely with other parts of government to develop an innovation-to-export pathway that supports businesses to commercialise quicker\n\nIncrease awareness of UKEF’s product offering\n\nEnsure a joined-up and coherent cross-government proposition that meets the financing needs of British businesses\n\n2 - Maritime, life sciences and clean growth sectors\n\nIn 2022-23, we will:\n\nIncrease focus on maritime and life sciences sectors so that the UK can better support those growing industries to export around the globe\n\nExpand support for clean growth sectors to help build the UK supply chain, accelerating the global green transition\n\nDevelop interim portfolio decarbonisation targets and more robust climate-related financial disclosures\n\n3 - Global Britain\n\nIn 2022-23, we will:\n\nContinue to influence our peers to strengthen the Coal-Fired Power Sector Understanding and modernise the OECD Arrangement to help preserve a level playing field for British businesses abroad\n\nWork across government to actively support and help increase defence sector exports, building relationships with new customers and tailoring our product offering\n\nDeepen collaboration between UKEF’s International Export Finance Executives and other government officials at posts in British Missions to support the UK’s government-to-government and trade offering\n\n4 - Levelling up\n\nIn 2022-23, we will:\n\nContinue to widen availability of the General Export Facility with new delivery partners to reach more SMEs across the UK\n\nUse the Export Finance Manager network and product innovations to reach more SMEs whose turnover is less than £10 million a year\n\nContinue to focus on digitising the customer journey to increase efficiency and improve UKEF’s fintech offering\n\n5 - Trade for good\n\nIn 2022-23, we will:\n\nStrengthen collaboration with British International Investment (formerly CDC) to leverage the government’s debt and equity financing offers in developing countries\n\nWork alongside DIT and the FCDO to promote the developmental benefits of trade through the International Development Strategy\n\nEnhance and report on UKEF’s approach to identify, mitigate and prevent modern slavery in its portfolio\n\nLouis Taylor\n\nChief Executive and Accounting Officer\n\n28 June 2022\n\nPerformance overview\n\nFinancial objectives\n\nObjective and description Results Maximum commitment: This measure places a cap on the maximum amount of nominal risk exposure (the total amount of taxpayers’ money that may be put at risk by UKEF). Met: The highest recorded maximum exposure in the year was £36.5 billion, against a maximum permissible level of £50 billion. Risk appetite limit: This limit places a constraint on UKEF’s appetite for risk at the 99.1 percentile of UKEF’s estimated portfolio loss distribution. Met: UKEF’s 99.1 percentile of portfolio loss distribution did not exceed £3.5 billion against a maximum permissible level of £5 billion. Reserve index: This index ensures that UKEF has accumulated, over time, sufficient revenue to cover possible losses, to a 77.5% level of confidence. Met: The reserve index did not fall below 1.96 in the year, against a target minimum of 1.00. Pricing adequacy index: This index tests whether, over time, UKEF earns sufficient premium income to cover all its risk and operating costs. It is measured over 3 different periods: (i) past 2 years and present year. Met: This index at 31 March 2022 was 1.69, against a monthly minimum target of 1.00. (ii) previous, present and (forecast) next year. Met: This index did not fall below 1.57, against a monthly target minimum of 1.00. (iii) present year and (forecast) next 2 years. Met: This index did not fall below 1.58, against a monthly target minimum of 1.00. Premium-to-risk ratio: This measure ensures that each year UKEF charges enough premium to cover the cost of risk, together with a sufficient margin to contribute a material amount to administrative costs. Met: This ratio did not fall below 2.03, against a target minimum of 1.35.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer’s report sets out more detail on these objectives.\n\nThese financial objectives apply to business issued since 1991. There are no specific financial objectives in respect of outstanding exposures on business supported before 1991 other than to recover amounts owed to UKEF, while taking account of the government’s policy on debt forgiveness. As authorised by HM Treasury, the TCRF is exempt from UKEF’s standard portfolio level financial objectives and risk appetite limit. These financial objectives apply to accounts 2 and 5, the only exception is the maximum commitment objective which includes accounts 2, 3 and 5.\n\nEconomic snapshot\n\nRichard Smith-Morgan, Deputy Chief Risk Officer\n\nDark clouds on the horizon\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces looms large over the global economy.\n\nThe Russian economy is expected to enter a deep recession as far-reaching sanctions take hold, with significant spillovers to Europe and beyond. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised global growth forecasts for 2022 down from 4.4%[footnote 8] in January to 3.6%[footnote 9] in April, and the OECD expects a one percentage point hit to global growth in 2022.[footnote 10]\n\nThe shock has added to inflationary pressures, particularly in the energy markets, where the price of Brent oil reached $139 per barrel on 7 March 2022. These effects will worsen the current cost-of-living squeeze, as higher prices feed into transport costs and energy bills, and then onwards into basic purchases such as food. This in turn puts pressure on governments to support businesses and citizens as they deal with falling purchasing power.\n\nRising energy prices also have ramifications for external balances. While net energy exporters stand to gain from higher prices, net energy importers face worsening terms-of-trade and currency depreciation pressures.\n\nRecovery hits a stumbling block\n\nElsewhere, prices for wheat, metals and other strategic commodities have seen large increases because of the conflict. Globally, Russia and Ukraine account for almost 30% of wheat, 13% of corn and over 60% of sunflower seed oil exports globally.[footnote 11]\n\nThe conflict is highly likely to disrupt agricultural activities, which could seriously escalate food insecurity globally – at a time when international food and input prices are already high. This insecurity may be more acute in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), where a larger share of income is spent on food.\n\nMany European and Central Asian countries also rely on Russia for over 50% of their fertiliser.[footnote 12] Shortages of fertiliser will hamper food production and further squeeze supplies.\n\nBefore the conflict began, the global economy was rebounding strongly from the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. After a 3.1% contraction in 2020, the economy grew 6.1% in 2021.\n\nThe rollout of vaccination programmes helped reduce severe illness, hospitalisations and fatalities from COVID-19. This allowed lockdowns to ease and citizens to resume economic activity.\n\nHowever, the procurement and administration of vaccine doses varied markedly along wealth lines. Higher-income countries could acquire vaccines at a much faster rate, creating divergent paths to economic recovery.\n\nIn 2021, advanced economies grew by 5.2% and EMDEs by 6.8% – but within this group, low-income countries grew by a more modest 4.0%, as their recoveries were pushed back into 2022.[footnote 13]\n\nThe threat of new COVID-19 variants still poses downside risks, particularly for countries with much lower vaccination rates. We saw this in action with the Omicron variant, which led to many travel and mobility restrictions being reintroduced and generated turbulence in financial markets.\n\nReverberations around the world\n\nSeveral significant macroeconomic events accompanied the turn of the year, giving rise to more downside risks.\n\nFor example, concerns have mounted over the health of China’s real estate sector after Evergrande’s default and the potential for its consequential impact on the banking system.\n\nAt the same time, central banks in advanced economies are adopting more hawkish stances as inflation persists. Both the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve have already raised rates. This is likely to have an impact on EMDEs as they face the threat of capital outflows and currency depreciations, which would worsen their external debt burdens. This is somewhat concerning given their recent build-up of sovereign debt, as the recent Sri Lankan default illustrates.\n\nAs a result, governments – particularly those in lower-income countries – have more limited fiscal space to battle these external macroeconomic pressures. Meanwhile, following strong performance in 2021 and buoyed by ultra-loose monetary policy and substantial fiscal stimulus, the financial markets entered 2022 in correction territory.\n\nDeclines were driven by the spread of Omicron, inflation fears and hawkish stances from central banks. The crisis in Ukraine has exacerbated stock market falls and generated significant future uncertainty, driving investors to seek safe-haven assets. The conflict has reverberated across the global financial system as investors try to assess the damage it will cause.\n\nThe outlook at home\n\nThe UK economy grew by 7.5% in 2021.[footnote 14]The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects growth of 3.8% in 2022,[footnote 15] considerably lower than the 6.0% previously forecasted in October 2021,[footnote 16] before the war in Ukraine.\n\nAnnual UK inflation hit 6.2% in February 2022,[footnote 17] well above the Bank of England’s 2% target. The OBR forecasts inflation to average 7.4% for 2022. The increase in energy prices is the main driver of inflation, but supply problems, high shipping costs and staff shortages are also contributing factors. In response, the Bank of England raised rates again in March 2022, for the third time in 4 months, and noted that further rate hikes might be necessary.\n\nLooking further ahead, climate change poses a serious threat to the global economy. COP26 brought about some encouraging collective commitments; now it is time to deliver on them. The world’s increasing focus on climate change, combined with rising wholesale fossil fuel prices, is spurring governments into action. We hope this will catalyse much more investment into adaptation and building resilience, which will help to create more sustainable economies.\n\nAt the time of publication, the Ukraine crisis is the main uncertainty affecting the economic outlook. A peace agreement could support the global economy, but the conflict is still likely to leave long-lasting scars and the fallout from the war in Ukraine, the build-up of sovereign debt and the gloomier growth outlook all pose risks to credit quality. This may increase demand for our support, and we remain well placed and ready to support UK exports, but also highlights the importance of our continued, effective risk management of our portfolio.\n\nOur support for exports\n\nTim Reid, Business Group Director\n\nRichard Simon-Lewis, Business Development, Marketing and Communications Director\n\nBusiness supported\n\n£33.4 billion of business supported over 5 years\n\n£7.4 billion of support provided in 2021-22\n\n545 exporters directly supported\n\n116 General Export Facilities issued (most used product)\n\n61 countries reached by UKEF supported exports\n\nBiggest & smallest deal by value\n\n£1.1 billion Buyer Credit Facility\n\n£448 Export Insurance Policy\n\nOur financial support\n\nFrom the industrial heartlands of Wales and the Midlands to the renewable energy hubs of the North East and Scotland, UKEF helps UK companies access the finance they need to take advantage of international trade. Our financial support helps UK companies win orders, fulfil contracts and get paid by providing guarantees, insurance and loans that support export activities.[footnote 18]\n\nMany businesses are using UKEF-backed working capital\n\nThis year, we delivered 170 working capital facilities to 115 businesses, primarily small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\n116 facilities from our General Export Facility (GEF)\n\n8 facilities from our Export Development Guarantee (EDG)\n\n101 facilities from our Bond Support Scheme\n\n46 facilities from our contract specific Export Working Capital Scheme\n\nEach of these facilities enables a company to access cash flow solutions that support international trade.\n\nThe accessibility, flexibility, and certainty that GEF gives exporters has been a game-changer. The product has become our pre-eminent offering to smaller exporters, with nearly £250 million of funding for UK business issued through the scheme by banks this financial year.\n\nOur EDG offers similar benefits to larger corporates. Since its launch in 2021, we have provided £10.6 billion in backing to some of the UK’s largest employers. Our support has provided essential liquidity to businesses seeking recovery, development and growth so they can meet new and continuing global opportunities head-on, and has also supported the large businesses in their supply chains.\n\nInsurance support is returning to pre-pandemic levels\n\nThe global pandemic also highlighted the value of our Export Insurance Policy (EXIP), which helps exporters manage the risk of non-payment by customers in challenging markets. As the trade finance market begins its recovery from coronavirus (COVID-19), demand for EXIPs has tapered downwards, with 38 customers being directly supported through the scheme compared to 47 in the year 2020-21.\n\nDemand for buyer finance remains strong\n\nWe delivered a significantly increased amount of buyer finance support this year, especially for smaller value export contracts, with 42 transactions issued in the year worth £2.6 billion.\n\nOf these, 11 were provided through our direct lending facility worth £561 million, 18 through our Buyer Credit Facility worth over £2 billion, and 13 through supplier credit facilities, including the newly launched Standard Buyer Loan Guarantee (SBLG), worth £27 million.\n\nThe SBLG provides UK manufacturers and suppliers with support for contracts that involve SME-to-SME trades where the underlying contracts feature high levels of UK content.\n\nOur buyer finance support helps British suppliers win contracts on overseas projects by providing attractive financing terms for their overseas buyers. Of the 545 customers we supported last year, 263 secured business on a UKEF-backed overseas project.\n\nOur impact on the world: sustainable and clean growth deals\n\nTrade is a powerful agent of change, funnelling money and expertise into projects that have a strong clean and sustainable impact. This is why, in September 2021, we announced the formation of a dedicated 20-strong Renewables and Transition underwriting team to focus on securing more deals in these critical sectors.\n\nIt has been a busy first year for the new team. We have helped finance Türkiye’s largest solar plant. Our EDG is supporting Jaguar Land Rover’s next generation of electric vehicles, while facilities provided to British Airways and MACE contained sustainability-related performance clauses, offering improved terms should the companies exceed their emissions reduction targets. We also provided our first Transition EDG to help John Wood Group finance their green ambitions.\n\nThis financial year also saw UKEF once again increase the scale of our sustainable financing, including transactions that have a pronounced social or developmental benefit. These transactions have contributed to UKEF rising to first place in TXF’s Sustainable Financing league table for 2021.\n\nThere is much more to do in these critical areas, of course, and we expect to see ongoing demand for our sustainable financing offer in the next financial year. To accelerate this, we are focussing more of our origination activity on clean growth sectors. In time, we hope to have at least 50% of new business originating from our network of International Export Finance Executives coming from these areas.\n\nOur work around the world, coupled with a proactive focus on clean growth areas, has already helped our department to diversify its portfolio. We have built a pipeline of projects that could benefit from UK financing and exports – not only in renewable energy but also in other low-carbon areas of economic growth.\n\nSustainable deals by numbers\n\n£7.1bn of international sustainable projects supported since 2019○\n\nBacked 1st Transition Export Development Guarantee\n\n18 International Export Finance Executives, putting clean growth at the top of their agenda\n\n1 ranked ECA globally for sustainable deals in 2021○\n\n12 overseas sustainable projects supported in 2021○\n\n20 underwriters dedicated to supporting Renewables and Transition deals\n\n○ According to TXF’s sustainable finance rankings.\n\nCase study: Upholding environmental standards in our largest ever infrastructure deal\n\nWith £1.1 billion of support, we provided our largest ever guarantee for a civil infrastructure project in Türkiye this year. The operational benefits of the project are strongly sustainable. It will ease road traffic congestion and improve the efficiency of the transport system by providing a more sustainable alternative.\n\nBut it is equally important that the project is designed, procured and constructed so that it meets good international industry practice. The project must preserve and account for the existing natural and social environment that surrounds the site.\n\nThe project involves the design, construction and operation of a high-speed rail line over 500km, connecting Ankara to Izmir in Türkiye.\n\nPrevious construction along the rail corridor, changing institutional ownership, historic and future displacement of people, and critical habitats along the route were all challenges that needed to be managed. That’s why we made it a condition of our support that enhanced E&S due diligence was carried out before any UKEF financing was issued.\n\nUKEF worked closely with the exporter and the buyer for all relevant parties to discuss roles, responsibilities and scenario planning for appropriate risk management. By engaging everyone in discussions and scenario planning, UKEF identified and helped to assign roles and responsibilities for each party to manage environmental and social risks. This aligned the project stakeholders on how to achieve international standards and reduce the impact of future environmental and social risk incidents.\n\nOur support for high value exports\n\nSupporting the strategically important UK supply chains and exporters that underpin our country’s international trade is a critical focus of the department. We are driving investment in UK manufacturing hubs across the country, creating and sustaining highly productive jobs at companies that export goods and services worth billions of pounds.\n\nAnother milestone this year was the first sovereign support that UKEF has provided to the government of Serbia. We provided £363 million for Bechtel and Enka’s 5G-ready Morava Corridor motorway project. The road, connecting communities and businesses from Pojate in the east to Preljina in the west, is also the first time we have worked with Bechtel as an applicant for our support. It will create many opportunities for UK suppliers.\n\nThis year UKEF also concluded its first transactions in Côte d’Ivoire, totalling £338 million before reinsurance. This included £200 million of support for NMS Infrastructure Limited to build and equip 6 new hospitals and provide post-completion training and technical support. The project will provide a local population of more than one million people with access to vital healthcare services.\n\nThe aerospace sector remained heavily affected by COVID-19 during the financial year. UKEF provided support for an additional EDG facility to British Airways, guaranteeing 80% of a £1 billion stand-by loan facility.\n\nWe supported the delivery of various Airbus aircraft this financial year, including the final 5 A380 aircraft to be delivered to Emirates and A350 aircraft for Cathay Pacific, Turkish Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines. We also provided support to our Canadian counterparts EDC in respect of the UK content in 12 A220 aircraft.\n\nWe supported 5 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft delivered to Sun Express of Türkiye, making use of an agreement between UKEF and Boeing to provide an element of export credit support based on Boeing’s supply chain spend in the UK. We also provided BAE Systems with support in respect of availability services in Oman.\n\nThe aerospace sector is critical to the UK. It generates turnover of £60.6 billion and supports 961,000 UK jobs, many of them highly skilled and productive roles. Our support for these firms, as well as for companies who rely on doing business with them, is vital to our mission.\n\nInternational Export Finance Executive network\n\nDuring the pandemic, when travel was severely restricted, our International Export Finance Executive (IEFE) network provided crucial on-the-ground coverage to our overseas stakeholders.\n\nNotwithstanding the turbulence of this year, we have successfully expanded this overseas network. Starting with 8 individuals at the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020 and increasing to 12 at the start of the financial year, we now have 18 IEFEs in place and plan to increase this to around 30 over the next year.\n\nHow we bring business to the UK\n\nUKEF markets itself in the UK to a target audience of exporters, overseas buyers of UK supplies and intermediaries such as brokers and lenders. We use a combination of public relations activity, online advertising, social media, events, partnerships, direct marketing and remarketing.\n\nIn 2021-22, we continued to put our export finance managers at the centre of our ‘Exporters’ Edge’ campaign. The campaign exceeded its annual target of 5,000 responses from UK businesses.\n\nNow in its fifth year, the campaign has increased awareness of UKEF: today 1 in 6 companies with over 50% export turnover spontaneously name UKEF as a source of support. At the start of the campaign, it was 1 in 20.\n\nThe campaign has seen UKEF’s customer relationship database grow from around 30,000 contacts to over 100,000. Campaign-influenced new business was responsible for about a third of UKEF’s customers in 2021-22, contributing to a growing customer base.\n\nUKEF successfully held 2 supplier fairs in 2021-22. The events sought UK suppliers for the Arab Construction Company and for the International Center for Innovation and Transfer of Agricultural and Livestock Technology (CIITTA) and FGV Europe, for various sustainable food production projects in Africa.\n\nIn target markets overseas, we held 35 international events to engage high-value buyers with the potential to source significant volumes of new supplies from the UK.\n\nOur growing overseas network and support teams in the UK engage with overseas finance ministries, multilateral agencies and developers to identify projects of mutual interest that could benefit from UKEF financing and the expertise of the UK supply chain – particularly those in the clean growth space.\n\nThese activities help us to stay abreast of opportunities around the world and to insert ourselves into procurement conversations, so that our financing can facilitate the UK supply chain’s entry into export opportunities.\n\nChief Risk Officer’s report\n\nSamir Parkash, Chief Risk Officer\n\nSince last year’s report, through most of the financial year 2021-22, economies, balance sheets and the credit environment have been stabilising as the world recovers from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the largest global recession since the Second World War.\n\nHowever, the war in Ukraine, has had a huge impact on key commodity markets, supply chains, energy prices and food supplies. These risks, alongside the continuing threat of new Covid-19 variants, are triggering another slowdown in global growth and renewing the pressure on markets and businesses we support.\n\nThese stresses could adversely affect UKEF’s portfolios in the short to medium term. We remain alert to emerging risks and, in line with our management of the COVID-19 induced crisis, will adapt our approach and policies as events dictate and as our customers and mandate require.\n\nRisk governance\n\nBy the nature of its mandate, UKEF is subject to a wide range of underlying risks.\n\nThe ultimate responsibility for risk management within UKEF lies with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). As Accounting Officer, the CEO is answerable to ministers and Parliament for all aspects of the department’s operations. A number of committees, principally the Enterprise Risk and Credit Committee (ERiCC), support the CEO with risk management.\n\nUKEF’s risk management activities are also subject to independent oversight and monitoring to help to ensure compliance with financial objectives.\n\nThe Board\n\nThe UKEF Board provides the CEO with independent advice, scrutiny and challenge across a broad range of areas, including strategic risk management. The Board’s Risk Committee separately reviews the adequacy of risk management and controls across the department.\n\nUK Government Investments\n\nUK Government Investments (UKGI) provides advice to the Secretary of State. It also holds an ex-officio position on the UKEF Board. Through this position, UKGI reviews and engages with the department’s risk management function, to help make sure risk and internal controls are effectively managed.\n\nUKGI also leads business review meetings to monitor UKEF’s financial and operating performance and key performance indicators on behalf of UKEF Ministers and alongside HM Treasury.\n\nEnterprise Risk and Credit Committee (ERiCC)\n\nERiCC advises the CEO on the effective management of our enterprise and credit risk exposures. It is scheduled to meet weekly and often convenes on an ad hoc basis to consider urgent business.\n\nIts responsibilities include:\n\nagreeing our enterprise and credit risk policies and procedures\n\nmaking sure enterprise risk is effectively identified, assessed, managed and reported across UKEF\n\nagreeing policies, procedures and methodologies for:\n\ncalculating and charging premium\n\nmonitoring and modelling portfolio risk\n\nmanaging and monitoring credit risk exposures at transaction and portfolio level\n\napproving credit risk exposures above the level of authority delegated by the CEO to senior risk executives\n\nThe standing members of ERiCC are:\n\nCEO\n\nChief Risk Officer (CRO)\n\nChief Finance and Operating Officer (CFOO)\n\nBusiness Group Director\n\nDeputy Chief Risk Officer\n\nHead of Underwriting Policy and Products\n\nHead of Portfolio Management\n\nChief Analyst\n\nOther relevant personnel, including the Director of Legal and Compliance or a nominee, will also attend as appropriate. In the absence of the CEO, any approvals require a unanimous decision of a quorum of standing members.\n\nDelegated authorities\n\nIn addition to ERiCC, the Risk Management Group has a framework of delegated credit authorities.\n\nThe CEO has authorised the CRO to approve various categories of credit risk within pre-determined limits.\n\nIn turn, the CRO has granted authority over certain credit approvals to senior staff within their teams.\n\nCredit approvals that exceed the delegated authority of the CRO must be approved by ERiCC. Larger transactions must also be approved by the CEO and HM Treasury.\n\nOrganisational model\n\nUKEF has a functional organisation structure, which separates business origination from risk, financial control and reporting functions. This basic internal control is designed to avoid potential conflicts of interest. It also provides vital and appropriate checks and balances in the business origination, credit approval and risk management processes.\n\nThe CRO is responsible for the Risk Management Group, which consists of 5 divisions.\n\nEnterprise Risk Division (ERD)\n\nERD works in partnership with all Groups to ensure that sound risk management practices are embedded in day-to-day activities across the department, promoting a culture of openness, collaboration, and constructive challenge.\n\nRisk Approval Division (RAD)\n\nRAD provides a holistic approach to risk approvals in order to minimise the risk of financial loss, in the event that a counterparty to which UKEF has financial exposure fails to meet its contractual obligations.\n\nThe division includes teams assessing country risk, corporate risk, project finance risk and financial institutions risk.\n\nPricing and Risk Analytics Division (PRAD)\n\nPRAD manages portfolio risk and prices deals to make sure UKEF meets the financial objectives set by HM Treasury and can support the success of both current and future exporters. PRAD analysts also provide technical, modelling and operational consultancy to support robust, evidence-based decision making across UKEF.\n\nPortfolio Management Division (PMD)\n\nPMD monitors customers and exporters after approvals and proactively takes expedient actions to mitigate emerging risks.\n\nIt includes teams responsible for post-issue management of medium and long-term cases, active portfolio management, sovereign debt restructuring, distressed assets, and claims and recoveries.\n\nSpecial Situations Division (SSD)\n\nSSD currently manages all stressed cases within UKEF’s aircraft portfolio, but there is scope for expansion into non-aerospace cases when necessary. SSD was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a disproportionate effect on the airline industry and the UKEF aircraft portfolio.\n\nRisk management framework\n\nOur risk management framework represents a consistent structure and a documented approach to identifying, assessing, evaluating and reporting known and emerging risks across UKEF. The framework encourages continuous monitoring, good risk awareness and sound operational and strategic decision making.\n\nIt encompasses a series of detailed policies, procedure, and methodologies. The Risk Management Group regularly reviews these to make sure they remain fit for purpose in a constantly evolving risk environment.\n\nIndustry best practice\n\nWhere appropriate, we aim to align our risk management framework with best practice in the financial services industry. At the same time, as the UK’s export credit agency (ECA), our role, mandate and risk appetite are different to private sector counterparts, making direct comparisons potentially misleading. An ECA’s portfolios will tend to have:\n\na higher risk profile\n\na focus on emerging market risks\n\nlonger risk horizons\n\ngreater risk concentrations (counterparties, sectors and geographic regions)\n\nWithin UKEF the 3 lines of defence model is an integral and critical part of enterprise risk management. Everyone in UKEF has a responsibility to manage risk. Each line of defence has a clear understanding of their responsibility and how they fit into the department’s overall risk and control structure.\n\n3 lines of defence model\n\nFirst Line: Every member of staff manages the processes, procedures, risks and controls on a day-to-day basis\n\nSecond Line: Divisions which are part of the overall management chain but provide independent oversight of management activity\n\nThird Line: Delivered by Internal Audit – Independent and objective assurance of UKEF’s governance, risk management and control\n\nRisk culture\n\nSound risk management at UKEF is underpinned by an effective and robust risk culture. Senior leaders are responsible for embedding risk management as part of their teams’ everyday business activities. It is a continuous cycle of proactively assessing and responding to new information and developments.\n\nWe have recently established a Risk Champion network to promote and embed effective risk management practices across UKEF. Risk Champions enhance our risk culture by being proactive ambassadors and acting as a first point of contact for risk management for each Group.\n\nEnterprise risk management\n\nThe CEO has designated responsibility for leading UKEF’s approach to enterprise risk management to the CRO. This includes ensuring there are appropriately skilled staff to independently influence and challenge governance and decision-making forums.\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Division (ERD) helps everyone embed risk management practices using department-wide communications, knowledge-building events, training and guidance. To support its work, ERD follows an established set of enterprise risk management principles:\n\nproactive, not reactive\n\nownership of risks by the relevant division\n\nrisk management is embedded in day-to-day processes\n\nrobust and responsive to change\n\nassists in the achievement of UKEF’s strategic objectives\n\nMonthly and quarterly enterprise risk reports (which include outcomes and remediating actions from enterprise risk activities) are presented to ERiCC. This enables the committee to monitor and manage the department’s enterprise risk profile and to obtain assurance that its decisions have been acted upon.\n\nEnterprise risk reporting is also provided to the Risk Committee, summarising key risks and the effectiveness of risk management in UKEF.\n\nPolicy and framework\n\nOur enterprise risk policy and framework ensure that effective risk management is integrated into the way UKEF manages and operates its businesses. They set out our best practice approach to managing enterprise risk and are designed to ensure the department has the right processes, procedures, reporting and control mechanisms to identify, assess, monitor, report and remediate risks.\n\nThe policy also sets out the CEO’s high-level requirements and defines the roles and responsibilities for enterprise risk management across the department.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nOur enterprise risk taxonomy identifies 9 primary risk categories. These provide senior management with a structured approach to managing known and emerging risks across UKEF.\n\nEach primary risk is owned by a member of the Executive Committee, who has executive oversight of that risk and is responsible for managing it within UKEF’s risk appetite.\n\nUKEF Risk Taxonomy Environmental Climate change Financial (including credit and market) Strategic and business Political Operational Programme and project External Compliance and legal\n\nWe consider conduct and reputational risks on a pan-UKEF basis rather than as a separate risk type. This enables us to consider these risks strategically, as part of the assessment for all risk categories in the course of doing business.\n\nOperational risk\n\nManaging operational risk is an integral part of UKEF’s overall enterprise risk management activities and must be considered by all staff.\n\nEach group within UKEF maintains a risk and control assessment (RACA), which details the key known and emerging risks it manages. ERD also monitors, analyses and reports actual operational risk incidents to identify key and recurring themes.\n\nFor more discussion of operational risk, see the Governance Statement.\n\nAssurance framework\n\nAssurance testing provides the CEO, Executive Committee, ERiCC and the Risk Committee with independent, reliable evidence that primary enterprise risks are being adequately managed and governed.\n\nAssurance testing is achieved by undertaking ‘deep dive’ reviews, ad hoc sample control testing, quality control checks and new initiative assurance.\n\nControl environment certificate (CEC)\n\nAll group directors use a consistent and comparable rating mechanism to assess and self-certify the management of enterprise risk within their area of responsibility. Twice a year, group directors are required to provide this assessment and self-certification to the CEO.\n\nThe outputs of each CEC inform the assurance testing plan, RACA challenge sessions and enterprise risk reporting.\n\nRisk appetite\n\nWe have developed our risk appetite statement to facilitate strategic discussions about risk – and to support informed decision-making, by making sure the boundaries of risk-taking have been set and understood.\n\nFormally articulating our risk appetite provides the foundation for further development of the wider risk appetite framework.\n\nPolicy management\n\nThe policy management framework governs internal department-wide policies. It is designed to ensure that these policies adequately address the material inherent risks UKEF faces in its business activities, and that we are managing these risks in line with our risk appetite and business strategies.\n\nFinancial risk management\n\nCredit risk is the most significant source of financial risk for UKEF. It is also a core competency for the department. We have a number of financial objectives and a series of detailed risk policies, procedures and individual risk methodologies which determine how we assess, measure, manage and report the categories of credit risk we are exposed to.\n\nAll material credit risks must be approved by the CEO, ERiCC or a designated member of the Risk Management Group with the appropriate delegated authority. Further, UKEF may not give an individual commitment in excess of £200 million without the agreement of HM Treasury. Once approved, credit exposures are regularly monitored and reviewed at both portfolio and individual transaction level.\n\nERiCC oversees portfolio-level monitoring. This includes stress testing and scenario analysis every 6 months and a monthly review of portfolio movements, particularly focussing on exposure, expected loss and unexpected loss changes. Monthly management information reports the performance of the credit portfolio – including detailed limit management reviews – against our financial objectives. On a quarterly basis, detailed portfolio packs are presented to the Risk Committee.\n\nAt a transactional level, we regularly update the ratings allocated to countries and individual counterparties. UKEF maintains ‘watch lists’ of counterparties whose credit risk is materially deteriorating; if the credit of a non-sovereign borrower deteriorates such that UKEF might reasonably expect to pay out under a guarantee or insurance policy, the case will be managed by a dedicated unit within the Portfolio Management Division.\n\nFinancial objectives and risk appetite\n\nParliament sets a limit on the commitments into which UKEF may enter. This limit is expressed in special drawing rights (SDR), an international reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and set at SDR67.7 billion (approximately £70 billion).\n\nUKEF’s powers may only be exercised with the consent of HM Treasury. The Treasury agrees a standing consent with UKEF, providing parameters within which we can operate without needing to seek explicit approval, as well as our financial objectives and reporting requirements.\n\nUKEF’s financial objectives, set by HM Treasury, are designed to enable us to fulfil our mandate of supporting UK exporters while ensuring that credit risk and pricing:\n\nare managed on the basis that UKEF should receive a return that is at least adequate to cover the cost of the risks it is assuming\n\ndo not expose the taxpayer to the risk of excessive loss\n\ncover UKEF’s operating costs\n\nUKEF’s credit risk and pricing structure is governed by 6 financial measures:\n\nmaximum commitment: the total amount of nominal credit risk exposure that the department may incur; set at £50 billion under the HM Treasury consent\n\nrisk appetite limit: a form of economic capital limit of £5 billion1\n\nexposure management framework: a limit to exposure of £5 billion for any individual market, with capacity set inversely to risk\n\nreserve index: an index that measures whether UKEF has accumulated enough reserves over time to cover its possible credit losses at the 77.5 percentile on its portfolio loss distribution2\n\npricing adequacy index\n\npremium-to-risk ratio\n\nFor the outturn against all our financial objectives for the financial year 2021-22.\n\nEconomic capital and the risk appetite limit\n\nEconomic capital (often referred to as capital at risk or CaR) is a measure of risk based on potential future losses. It can be considered as a buffer to cover unexpected losses over a defined future period at a specified confidence level.\n\nExpected loss is a calculation of anticipated average loss over a defined period, based on historical experience. Expected losses essentially represent a ‘cost of doing business’, implying that when a financial institution assumes credit risk, it should always seek to charge an amount at least sufficient to cover the expected loss associated with the relevant loan, guarantee or insurance policy.\n\nUnexpected loss accounts for the potential for actual losses to exceed expected losses, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in calculating future losses. Unexpected loss will tend to increase if a portfolio has high risk concentrations and/or the risks in the portfolio are strongly correlated. UKEF defines unexpected loss as the difference between the portfolio expected loss and the 99.1% value of the loss distribution.\n\nThe risk appetite limit set by HM Treasury means that UKEF must manage its credit risk-taking activities such that total losses, as modelled by our portfolio risk management simulation model, will not (with a 99.1% degree of certainty) exceed £5 billion. In other words, at no time should portfolio expected loss, plus provisions against claims already paid, plus portfolio unexpected loss, exceed £5 billion. (This limit excludes business transacted under our Temporary COVID-19 Risk Framework, Account6 or under ministerial direction, Account 3.)\n\nAssessing credit risk\n\nWe use the following credit risk assessment process to estimate expected loss[footnote 19].\n\n1 - We assign a credit rating (from AAA to D) to all UKEF’s credit risks to estimate the probability of default. These probabilities are updated at least annually, using S&P’s nomenclature.\n\n2 - We estimate the loss given default: how much we stand to lose if the counterparty defaults, expressed as a percentage. Corporate and project finance loss given default assessments are conducted on a case-by-case basis, considering security, priority ranking, recovery prospects by market and likelihood of restructuring, sale or liquidation.\n\nIn the case of sovereign risk, persistence of default is also included in the calculation of potential loss. Based on empirical research, persistence of default (the estimated duration of a country’s default) is calculated as a function of its per capita income, the severity of indebtedness and whether the default is a liquidity event or substantially more material.\n\n3 - We estimate exposure at default: the credit risk exposure we have at the time of default.\n\nWe also closely monitor unexpected loss, which is integral to our assessment of credit risk appetite.\n\nAssessing sovereign risk\n\nWe assess each country in which we have an actual or potential credit exposure and use this assessment to assign a credit rating, from AAA (highest) to D (default, lowest).\n\nOur sovereign risk assessment framework is aligned with the one that Fitch, Moody’s and S&P use – but on top of that, ours is informed by a range of external materials, as well as cross-Whitehall forums, local UK diplomatic representatives, triannual OECD country risk expert meetings and country-specific visits, including meetings with a wide range of stakeholders [footnote 20].\n\nWhere no external credit rating exists, we typically use a World Bank-derived credit rating model supplemented by analyst judgement and peer comparisons. In all instances, credit ratings are reviewed by senior management and approved (as appropriate) by ERiCC.\n\nERiCC systematically reviews UKEF’s country limits and associated cover policies. Those of our economists who focus on sovereign credit also hold in-country meetings with all of our largest sovereign counterparties.\n\nExposure management framework\n\nOur exposure management framework sets individual country limits based on the following principles:\n\ncountries with higher levels of credit risk will have lower limits\n\nthe larger a country’s economy (as measured by its GDP), the higher the potential limit\n\ncountry limits are set relative to UKEF’s notional capital and are consistent with its financial objectives\n\nthe maximum country limit is £5 billion\n\nThe exposure management framework also prescribes a number of counterparty, sector and regional exposure guidelines to help manage concentration risk.\n\nEngagement with the Paris Club and G20\n\nThe Paris Club is an informal group of official creditors (primarily OECD) that cooperates on sovereign risk monitoring and sovereign restructuring operations. Its decisions are not legally binding, but the group and its members are committed to operating in line with principles of solidarity, consensus, fair burden sharing and information sharing; and in partnership with the IMF’s programmes of policy conditionality.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 crisis, the G20 and the Paris Club agreed in April 2020 a temporary net present value-neutral suspension of principal and interest repayments from eligible and requesting low-income developing countries under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) from 1 May 2020. The DSSI concluded on 31 December 2021. In total, the Paris Club deferred approximately US$4.6 billion from 42 requested low-income countries under the DSSI to support their COVID-19 response and recovery strategies. UKEF fully implemented the terms of the DSSI for requesting countries with eligible UKEF exposure. As a member of the Paris Club, the UK does not report on the details of Paris Club operations unilaterally; further details on the implementation of the DSSI can be found on the Paris Club website.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the DSSI, UKEF is working closely with HM Treasury, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and international partners on the G20/Paris Club Common Framework. The Common Framework provides a new institutional structure for sovereign debt restructurings required by low-income countries, enabling emerging official creditors (such as China, India, and Saudi Arabia) and the traditional official creditors of the Paris Club to cooperate during the negotiation of the terms of sovereign restructuring agreements.\n\nSovereign defaults that lead to debt restructuring agreements through the Paris Club or Common Framework are managed by the Risk Management Group, working in conjunction with HM Treasury (which leads the government’s sovereign debt function). Paris Club developments are monitored by the ERiCC, which must approve any provisions or impairments made against this exposure. During the financial year, UKEF received recoveries totalling £66 million from countries which continued to make payments under their UK Paris Club debt agreements.\n\nInformation sharing by creditors is a crucial component of promoting debt sustainability. The UK, as a creditor to other national governments, is committed to adhering to the highest standards of debt transparency. As part of the UK’s commitment to the G20 Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing, UKEF has, since March 2021, published quarterly reports on any new issued and effective sovereign direct lending, sovereign called guarantees or finalised bilateral Paris Club restructuring agreements. The reports capture granular loan-by-loan data, including its use, beneficiary, amount, tenor and type of interest rate. The publications complement HM Treasury’s annual report on the outstanding stocks of debt owed by other countries to the UK (including UKEF and FCDO), aggregated on a country-by-country basis. The UK was the first G7 country to raise our sovereign lending transparency practices to this high standard. Following our lead, in June 2021, all other G7 members committed to publishing their creditor portfolios on a loan-by-loan basis for future sovereign direct lending.\n\nAssessing corporate, SME and project finance risk\n\nRisk assessments for our corporate business (which includes our aircraft financing business) and project finance business are principally based on S&P credit rating methodologies.\n\nFor small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) credit ratings, we have a separate, bespoke methodology.\n\nFor each transaction, we combine rating templates with the relevant analyst’s subjective judgement. The analyst’s judgement is particularly important when it comes to more qualitative factors, such as management, environmental and social factors, climate change and corporate governance.\n\nWhere available, we benchmark the resulting credit ratings against industry peers and other relevant market metrics.\n\nWe continue to refine our underlying credit risk methodologies, particularly with respect to the SME sector, in order to reduce turnaround times. More specifically, we have flexed a number of the key credit criteria for our bond support and working capital facilities, which we risk-share with financial institutions. Similarly, we have streamlined the credit assessment process for our export insurance business, which has allowed us to increase new business volumes. We have also developed a bespoke credit assessment process to handle the payment risks that arise under export insurance, and the credit and political risks covered by bond insurance.\n\nThe continuing effects of COVID-19 throughout the financial year have manifested as increased pressure on corporate and sovereign cash flows and liquidity profiles and, in particular, as significantly increased leverage. As such, the Risk Management Group has increased its focus on analysing cash flow generation and capital structure profiles and adopted a more forward looking, through-the-cycle approach to its fundamental credit analysis. The creation of a discrete credit rating unit within the Risk Management Group was part of this structural refinement and through-the-cycle ratings have become an intrinsic part of the rating process.\n\nAssessing financial counterparty risk\n\nThe Financial Institutions team manages all UKEF’s financial counterparties, including banks, insurance companies, funds, leasing companies and other non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). The unit is embedded firmly into UKEF’s credit risk framework, operating under the same underlying principles as our corporate, SME and project finance teams: utilising specific S&P rating templates where appropriate, supplemented with seasoned analytical judgement.\n\nAll UKEF transactions require a bank or NBFI, whether as direct borrower, guarantor, lending syndicate participant, security trustee or payment and collection agent. We assess all such counterparties to make sure they meet our minimum credit risk standards. They can only be approved under appropriate delegated authority or, where relevant, by ERiCC.\n\nOur portfolio of insurers has been approved to facilitate our active portfolio management programme. This is where UKEF purchases reinsurance from the private market, subject to strict requirements, to reduce portfolio risk concentrations, decrease the likelihood of idiosyncratic losses, and/or free up headroom in country limits to support more UK exporters. We require all insurers, including general insurers and Lloyd’s syndicates, to have a minimum A- equivalent credit rating and to have maintained sound capital and solvency ratios, as well as underwriting disciplines during the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain vigilant to the impact of future events on the industry, particularly climate change.\n\nAircraft operating lessors are a core component of the global aerospace industry; about 50% of all commercial airline fleets are leased. As airlines seek to repair their balance sheets following the pandemic, this proportion is forecast to grow. The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 necessitated closer analysis of UKEF’s aircraft operating lessors, to demonstrate that even in materially reduced revenue scenarios, they had sufficient liquidity sources to meet their financial obligations over the anticipated term of the pandemic.\n\nThe majority of UKEF’s aircraft operating lessors’ risk exposure remained investment-grade, with no rating downgrades and no defaults.\n\nTemporary COVID-19 Risk Framework\n\nTo assist UK exporters as rapidly as possible following the outbreak of COVID-19, UKEF established the Temporary COVID-19 Risk Framework (TCRF) in April 2020, under a specific approval from HM Treasury. This helped support the cash flow and liquidity profiles of both UK exporters and overseas buyers of UK goods.\n\nWhile exempt from UKEF’s normal portfolio-level financial objectives and risk appetite limits, approved TCRF transactions remain firmly within UKEF’s minimum risk appetite requirements from a through-the-cycle perspective. The programme is underpinned by a comprehensive reporting structure, including day-to-day monitoring for our largest counterparties.\n\nThe incremental capacity and flexibility of the programme – which also included doubling the UK country limit to £10 billion and temporarily increasing all other country limits by 50%, to a maximum of £7.5 billion (from the current maximum of £5 billion) – proved to be highly successful throughout the year 2021-22, seeing almost 82% utilisation by the end of the year.\n\nNot surprisingly, the hard-hit UK transportation sector was the major beneficiary, with substantial facilities for Rolls-Royce plc, British Airways and easyJet.\n\nThe programme has been extended as a result of new COVID-19 variants, with a current expiry date for new exposures of July 2022.\n\nFinancial crime compliance\n\nUKEF is committed to deterring fraud, bribery and corruption, and to safeguarding taxpayer funds by taking all precautions that are reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances to avoid loss through becoming involved in export transactions tainted by financial crime.\n\nAs such, UKEF undertakes rigorous due diligence, including checks against fraud, bribery and corruption, before providing any support. UKEF has fully implemented, and abides by, the OECD Recommendation on Bribery and Officially Supported Export Credits, applying these standards before providing financial support.\n\nEnvironmental, social, governance and climate change\n\nUKEF recognises the importance of considering environmental, social, governance (ESG) and climate-related financial risks as part of its risk management processes.\n\nSovereigns and corporates are increasingly exposed to climate-related risks. UKEF has developed, and continues to develop, its approach to assessing the financial implications of these risks on all new and existing risk entities, as appropriate and in proportion to the risk taken by the department.\n\nTo advance and build capacity for managing climate-related financial risks, UKEF follows the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nAcross all of our portfolios, we continue to refine and expand our approach to analysing the credit impact of ESG and climate change. We have introduced bespoke ESG and climate change templates to our corporate business from April 2021.\n\nStrengthening UKEF’s climate-related risk management capabilities\n\nDuring the financial year, the Risk Management Group strengthened its capacity for managing climate-related financial risks in a number of key areas.\n\nAs well as adding a number of subject matter experts – including policy professionals, climate change financial modellers and climate change economists – we have enhanced the processes and policies governing our risk management activities, engaged with industry peers (including credit rating agencies and financial institutions) and, importantly, gained observer status at the UK’s Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF). Led by the Bank of England, the CFRF includes some of the UK’s most important commercial financial institutions.\n\nIntegrating climate-related financial risks in credit risk assessments\n\nSince 1 November 2019, UKEF has been refining its analysis of ESG risks in all new sovereign and non-sovereign credit risk assessments.\n\nFrom April 2021, we have enhanced this approach by using a new non-sovereign ESG and climate-related assessment framework and integrating climate-related financial risk considerations in our credit risk analysis. This approach augments UKEF’s analytical processes by considering risk categories recommended by TCFD, the potential for climate change resilience and adaptation measures to mitigate risk and the resulting potential financial implications.\n\nProject finance transactions, which generally involve single assets with long tenor loans (upwards of 18 years), can be particularly exposed to transition risks. It is therefore imperative that we understand the competitive landscape of these projects over the timescale of the debt. Using advice from independent external consultants, our project finance credit assessments consider relevant ESG and climate-related risks – with a particular focus on transition risks which could impact the economic life of the project, potentially causing the asset to become stranded. Environmental risk assessment includes physical climate risk considerations.\n\nFor corporates and financial institutions, unlike project finance, we do not routinely engage external consultants. The range of ESG and climate-related factors are considered as part of the rating and loss given default process. As this is an evolving discipline, we continue to develop our approach to assessing the credit risk consequences of these factors, utilising external industry analysis as appropriate.\n\nAll our recent sovereign risk reviews explicitly assess the potential impact of ESG and climate-related risk. We are still developing the methodology for incorporating this assessment, but we have drawn on the analyses by the global credit rating agencies, as well as other sources such as the World Risk Index and World Bank. We consider vulnerabilities to physical climate change impacts such as water shortages, droughts and coastal flooding, as well as transition risks such as reliance on fossil fuels – which could see a sharp fall in demand because of changes in government policies, regulations or consumer preferences.\n\nIntegrating climate-related financial risks in portfolio analysis\n\nClimate change considerations already play a key role in our counterparty and portfolio analysis. In addition to analysis at the counterparty level, and in line with the TCFD’s recommendations, since 2019 we have analysed our portfolio’s exposure to both transition and physical climate change risks, with both qualitative and quantitative scenario analysis, as part of a twice-yearly stress testing exercise.\n\nAnalysing transition risk is relevant for our portfolio because historic and current transactions with high greenhouse gas emissions are vulnerable to potential policy, legal, technology and market changes. Assessing physical climate risks is relevant for UKEF because of our geographically dispersed portfolio, which includes countries with increasingly acute risks from severe weather events and chronic risk caused by longer-term shifts of climate patterns.\n\nThe methodology and data sources we use to model these risks are still evolving. We are working with external partners to explore ways to improve the existing process to account for ESG and climate-related risks more holistically.\n\nWhen assessing the robustness and resilience of our operations, we look at stresses aligned with the following Network for Greening the Financial System scenarios.\n\nOrderly scenarios assume climate policies are introduced early and in a coordinated way and become gradually more stringent. Both physical and transition risks are relatively subdued when compared to the other scenarios.\n\nDisorderly scenarios explore higher transition risk caused by transition policies being delayed or divergent across countries and sectors. Given the delayed implementation, these scenarios also include some more limited physical risks.\n\nHot house world scenarios assume that some climate policies are implemented in some jurisdictions in line with commitments today, but global efforts are insufficient to halt significant global warming. Critical temperature thresholds are exceeded, leading to severe physical impacts, some of which are irreversible.\n\nToo little, too late scenarios explore transition risks similar to the disorderly scenario plus additional higher physical climate risks by assuming that climate policies are introduced too late, thereby failing to sufficiently decarbonise the economy. Greenhouse gas emissions would continue and increasing global temperature would fail to contain physical climate risks.\n\nWe have also introduced a new scenario during the semi-annual stress test, hot house world and insurers’ crisis. This is based on the hot house world scenario, but assumes additional stress for the insurance sector as a result of a significant increase in claims – and ultimately potential capital shortfalls – related to more frequent and severe weather events. Given the underlying strength of the sector, this scenario was only marginally more negative. During the year-end stress test we introduced the orderly transition scenario which had only a marginal impact. We explored the too little, too late scenario but did not stress test it this year due to its similarity to the disorderly scenario and due to ongoing global decarbonisation efforts and additional commitments.\n\nSome specific challenges for UKEF include the idiosyncratic characteristics of our portfolio, as well as the limited availability of data for the countries and regions where we have our largest exposures. While we have made progress, we remain committed to developing this area as geospatial data and historic climate change-specific financial data become more available.\n\nOutlook\n\nClimate-related financial risk analysis is an evolving field where methodologies are still maturing. Data providers are constructing models and new products which might eventually feed into default probabilities and credit ratings.\n\nUKEF remains committed to improving the quality and robustness of its processes and analytics in this field. Complemented by a combination of tailored training programmes and recruitment of new subject matter experts, we will further strengthen our climate financial risk assessments, which are becoming integral parts of our credit risk analysis.\n\nTogether, specific counterparty metrics, new and improved portfolio scenarios and stress testing will strengthen our risk management decision-making.\n\nWe will support all these activities by actively engaging with peers, financial institutions and relevant forums to make sure UKEF follows good practice in this developing field.\n\nPortfolio Management Division (PMD)\n\nWhen UKEF’s guarantee, loan or insurance policy is declared effective for every medium or long-term transaction we support and the financial exposure data has been accurately logged on internal management information systems, the transaction is handed over from the Business Group teams to the Risk Management Group’s Post Issue Management (PIM) team, housed within PMD. The PIM team is then responsible for all such transactions (including the ongoing review and monitoring processes) until prepayment, repayment or default.\n\nThe PIM team monitors amendments, waivers and compliance with financial covenants with the help of the agent of the lending banks under the UKEF guarantee. Requests for waivers, amendments and restructures are considered on a case-by-case basis and are reported and approved in line with the PIM Policy, under individual delegated authorities or through ERiCC as appropriate.\n\nIn the past year, we have seen our corporate (non-aerospace) exposures emerge relatively successfully from the crisis. While we restructured certain credits in this portfolio, these restructures are being worked through and no ‘post-restructuring’ defaults have occurred so far. We remain vigilant for these cases in particular as the risk of default is heightened after a restructuring.\n\nDuring 2021-22, a small number of our non-aerospace cases developed stresses. This is expected in the normal course of taking on credit risk. Payments on these cases are current and we are working proactively to avoid and mitigate potential for loss.\n\nSpecial "
