        "text": "GDP of Sri Lanka which was 89 USD Billion in 2019 dropped to 74 USD Billion in 2022 and is expected to reach 76.86 USD Billion by the end of 2024. Do you know how the GDP is calculated? GDP = private consumption + gross private investment + government investment + government spending + (exports â€“ imports). GDP is usually calculated by the national statistical agency of the country following the international standard.\n\nGDP data for 2023 is out and Sri Lanka overall clocked in a 2.3% contraction. However, in the final quarter the economy saw is largest quarterly growth at 4.5% for the 3 months to Decemebr 2023. This was driven by an expanding industrial sector at 7.8%, lower interest rates, and the significant influx of tourists to the island. The December quarter growth is promising for 2024. With my prediction for interest rates to keep dropping from the second quarter onwards to increase investment and interest induced consumption, and the expectation of drawing 4.5mn tourists for the year, we could expect to see Sri Lankaâ€™s economy record a positive GDP growth for 2024 between 1.5%-3% with inflation between 5%-7%.\n\nSri Lanka's GDP grows by 1.6% in Q3, marking a resilient recovery from a challenging economic phase. Stable exchange rates and strategic policies have played a pivotal role. ðŸ‘‰ Agriculture blooms: Rice surges by 23.3%, veggies by 3.2%, fruits by 5.4%. ðŸ‘‰ Industry insights: Textile contracts, but electricity and gas rise by 4.2%. ðŸ‘‰ Services shine: Tourism fuels a 34.9% surge in accommodation, food, and beverages. Let's applaud the diverse sectors contributing to this economic revival. #SriLankaEconomy #GDPGrowth #EconomicResilience https://lnkd.in/ghp7fzhT\n\nðŸ“‰ The GDP growth rate(YoY) for the first quarter of 2024 has been estimated as 5.3% of positive growth rate. ðŸ“‰ The GDP for Sri Lanka for the first quarter of the year 2024 at constant prices (2015) has increased to Rs. 3.3 Tr. from Rs. 3.1 Tr. compared with the same quarter of 2023. ðŸ“‰ Services, Industry and Agriculture have contributed their shares to the GDP at constant prices by 59.7%, 26.9% and 6.9% respectively in the first quarter of 2024. ðŸ“‰ All sectors have positive growth (YoY) in the first quarter of 2024. #cse #srilanka #stockmarket #investing #equityresearch #sentiment #capitalmarkets #investmentresearch #marketanalysis #stockbrokers #marketperform #GDP #growth\n\n#Cambodia's GDP has been revised upwards by a little over 35%, to US$41.9b at the end of 2023. This has a range of follow on impacts, such as Cambodia's public and private sector debt ratios now being 35% lower, and per capita GDP being 35% higher. In this short note, we explain why it has happened, and what it means. https://lnkd.in/guMrTGBz\n\nSri Lankaâ€™s GDP grew at 5.3% during first quarter of 2024... Sri Lankaâ€™s year-on-year GDP growth rate for the first quarter of 2024 has been estimated as 5.3% of positive growth rate, according to the Department of Census and Statistics.
