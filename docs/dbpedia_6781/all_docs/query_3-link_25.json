        "text": "Model Structure\n\nUsing Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) along with a Crystal Ball (Oracle, Redwood City, CA) add-in, we developed a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the economic and health burden of hookworm infection by country (N = 159, all countries where prevalence is reported and transmission is viable), WHO region, and worldwide from the societal perspective. The model converted age-specific hookworm prevalence and population estimates of different locations into hookworm cases by age, determined the intensity level of each hookworm infection, converted each case into health outcomes, and translated health outcomes into productivity losses and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).\n\nThe model starts with age-stratified hookworm prevalence estimates by location, using the following age strata (i): children 0–4 years old, 5–9 years old, 10–14 years old, and adults 15 years and older. We determined the infection intensity level by calculating the mean worm burden (M, average number of worms per person) of the age-stratified population from the prevalence and applied a negative binomial distribution of worms in the community[12] resulting in the probability of an individual harboring a given number of worms. The negative binomial distribution allowed us to represent the over-dispersion of worms, such that a few individuals harbor most of the worms. The model estimated M based on the hookworm prevalence (P) for each age-specific population using the following equation:\n\nMi=-k1-Pi1k-11-Pi-1k\n\nderived from Anderson and May[12], where k is the degree of aggregation of worms within the human population (where the proportion of the human population harboring the majority of hookworms becomes smaller as k approaches 0), and was set at 0.34.[13, 14] We calculated the probability of low (<28 worms), moderate (28–65 worms), and heavy intensity (>65 worms) infection[15] by fitting M to the negative binomial distribution:\n\nPix=1+Mik-k-x*Mikx*Гk+xx!Гx\n\nwhere Г() is a gamma distribution and x is the number of worms. These probabilities multiplied by the total population determined the number of persons in each age group with each infection intensity level (i.e., number of persons with low, moderate, or heavy intensity infections in each age group).\n\nOur model then converted each hookworm infection into health outcomes (i.e., hookworm-associated anemia and cognitive impairment) with accompanying health effects and costs. Each person with a hookworm infection had a probability of having hookworm-associated anemia. We derived the probability of hookworm-associated anemia using the age-stratified, infection intensity-specific probability of anemia and population attributable fraction (PAF). Age- and intensity-specific probabilities of anemia among those with hookworm infection came from the literature ( ). While there is a direct relationship between the intensity of hookworm infection (i.e., number of adult worms inside the host) and host blood loss[16], hookworm is not the only cause of anemia. We used the PAF, or the proportion of anemia in the population that is due to hookworm ( ), to attenuate the probabilities of anemia to determine the probability of hookworm-associated anemia. Each person with anemia then had a probability of having a specific hemoglobin (Hb) level. This probability was pulled from an age- and infection intensity-specific distribution. The distribution of Hb levels for each infection intensity level and age group was custom and created using data extracted from the literature on Hb levels for those with anemia and a hookworm infection.[16–21] As infants and children are particularly vulnerable to developmental and behavioral deficits, most likely due to iron-deficiency anemia[1], only children (0–14 years old) with anemia due to moderate and heavy intensity infections were assumed to have cognitive impairment.\n\nTable 1\n\nParameterAll Infection IntensitiesLow Intensity InfectionModerate Intensity InfectionHeavy Intensity InfectionSourceDisability Weights Anemia (2004 Estimate)0.024[49] Heavy Intensity Infection (2004 Estimate)0.006[49] Cognitive Impairment (2004 Estimate)ǂ0.0240.024[49] Mild Anemia (2010 Estimate)†0.005 (0.002–0.011)[50] Moderate Anemia (2010 Estimate)†0.058 (0.0380–0.086)[50] Severe Anemia (2010 Estimate)†0.164 (0.112–0.228)[50] Symptomatic Intestinal Nematode Infections (2010 Estimate)†^0.03 (0.016–0.048)[50]Duration of Anemia (years)1AssumptionPopulation Attributable Fraction (PAF)*0.28 (0.08)[17, 18, 30, 51]Probability of Anemia Children Low Estimate Study0.1290.1330.143[19] Median Estimate Study0.0880.1820.182[18] High Estimate Study0.6000.7370.797[17] Adults Low Estimate Study0.0410.1000.045[18] Median Estimate Study0.4860.6100.720[30] High Estimate Study0.6970.7400.803[16]\n\nHealth effects were measured in DALYs, which are the sum of the years of life lived with disability (YLD) and the years of life lost (YLL). However, since hookworm rarely causes death directly, our DALY calculation formula did not include YLLs and was therefore:\n\nDALY=YLD=I*DW*L\n\nwhere I is the number of incident cases, DW is the disability weight, and L is the average duration of the outcome ( ). YLDs accrued from anemia, heavy hookworm infection (>65 worms), and cognitive impairment (when included). The DW varied by the level of anemia depending on the scenario. As we aim to estimate the annual burden of hookworm, we assumed the duration of each outcome (i.e., hookworm-associated anemia and cognitive impairment) to be one year. Due to a lack of data on this outcome, we feel this is a conservative estimate given many people with hookworm would not receive treatment that would impact the duration of anemia or intensity of infection (e.g., annual MDA or iron-supplements); additionally, many studies looking at productivity losses evaluated a yearlong period[22].\n\nSince a majority of infected individuals do not seek medical care for hookworm infection, our model did not include direct healthcare costs and instead focused on lost productivity (i.e., societal perspective). We assumed productivity losses accrue for all ages. To account for potential variability in assigning productivity reductions due to anemia, different scenarios explored the impact of using the following methodologies for estimating productivity losses for each person with hookworm-associated anemia (summarized in ). The first method applied the DW for anemia to individual productivity for the duration of anemia (one year):\n\nProductivity Losses=Per Capita Productivity*DW*L\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the DW served as a proxy for the reduction in productivity and varied by the level of anemia, depending on the analysis scenario. Anemia levels were defined as: mild anemia 11–12.5g/dL for adults and 11g/dL for children, moderate anemia 8–10.9g/dL for all ages, and severe anemia <8g/dL for all ages.[23, 24] Productivity losses for individuals with heavy intensity infection and cognitive impairment were also considered using this method, using their respective DW estimates.\n\nTable 2\n\nMethodFormula*AssumptionsSources1Productivity Losses = Per Capita Productivity x Disability Weight x DurationDisability weight serves as a proxy for reductions in productivity.2Productivity Losses = Per Capita Productivity x (1-(Hemoglobin Level/Anemia Threshold)1.5)Reductions in productivity due to anemia are determined from individual’s hemoglobin level relative to those without anemia. Elasticity of 1.5 estimates the change in work capacity or output divided by percent change in hemoglobin.[25]3Productivity Losses = Per Capita Productivity x Loss of ProductivityAdapted from study on economic impact of anemia in a population and modified for an individual, assumes a 5% loss of productivity regardless of age.[26, 27]\n\nThe second method is based on the reduction in productivity due to anemia using methods described by Shastry and Weil.[25] This productivity reduction was calculated from an individual’s Hb level and determined the level of productivity in workers with anemia relative to those without anemia. The following formula calculated productivity losses using this method:\n\nProductivity Losses=Per Capita Productivity*1-Hb LevelAnemia Threshold1.5\n\n(2)\n\nwhere 1.5 is the elasticity of productivity with respect to blood Hb among anemic workers.[25] Elasticity is the percent change in work capacity or output divided by percent change in Hb; thus, for every 1% increase in Hb levels, there will be a 1.5% increase in output. We used anemia thresholds of 12.5g/dL for adults and 11g/dL for children.[24]\n\nThe third method was adapted from a study on the economic impact of anemia in Peru[26] (which is based on a model by Ross and Horton[27]). This method calculates the cost due to productivity losses as:\n\nProductivity Losses=Loss of Productivity*Wage Share*Gross Domestic Product per Capita*Prevalence\n\nwhere loss of productivity is the loss of productivity for an adult with anemia; wage share is the ratio of employee compensation over the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita; and prevalence is the prevalence of anemia in the population. As this formula results in the productivity loss per capita in the population due to anemia, we modified it to calculate the cost for an individual. Wage share and GDP per capita can be simplified to wage per capita; thus we used per capita productivity. Our modified formula is:\n\nProductivity Losses=Loss of Productivity*Per Capita Productivity\n\n(3)\n\nPrevious work has estimated the loss of productivity in adults with anemia doing manual labor that is not highly demanding (e.g., technical staff, salespersons, etc.) to be 5% and those with highly demanding physical work (e.g., laborers or agricultural workers) to be 12–17%.[26] A systematic review estimated the percent of annual productivity loss for anemia due to soil-transmitted helminths ranged from 0.1% to 17%.[22] To remain conservative, we utilized 5% for all ages and did not stratify by work force type.\n\nCosts (Productivity Losses)\n\nalso provides the productivity losses for hookworm-associated anemia in 2016 estimated from the three different calculation methods. Hookworm resulted in $11.0 billion (95% UI: $5.7–17.9 billion) in productivity losses (Method 1, median likelihood of anemia). Method 2, based on Hb levels, resulted in higher productivity losses overall, ranging from $56.8 to $138.9 billion annually, varying with the likelihood of anemia. Method 3 also resulted in higher productivity losses, ranging from $16.9 to 36.3 billion, depending on the likelihood of anemia. As Method 1 is more conservative (i.e., results in the lower economic burden) and more inclusive in health outcomes (i.e., includes infection, anemia, and cognitive impairment), the rest of the results utilized this method.\n\nIncluding the cognitive impairment outcome had little effect on total costs. Inclusion increased global costs by approximately $650,000, $1.2 million, and $4.3 million annually for low, median, and high likelihoods of anemia, respectively. None of these increases resulted in significantly different global cost estimates. Differences were primarily seen in the African region, where more medium and heavy intensity infections occur.\n\nGlobally, total productivity losses were sensitive to the DWs utilized when calculating costs via Method 1 ( ). Although there was some overlap between cost estimates, substantial variability arose when using the 2010 DW values, especially across the different likelihoods of anemia. A 10% increase in the 2010 DW values with a high likelihood of anemia resulted in productivity losses of $38.2 billion annually worldwide. Using the 2010 DW estimates substantially increased the economic burden of hookworm ( ). Assuming a median likelihood of anemia, hookworm cost $20.9 billion (95% UI: $1.8–89.1 billion) worldwide. The low estimate for anemia yielded $11.2 billion (95% UI: $1.6–83.1 billion) in total costs.\n\nUsing minimum wage data as a proxy for per capita productivity, hookworm results in productivity losses totaling $2.5 to $5.4 billion using Method 1 and 2004 DW estimates, $3.4 to $10.5 billion using Method 1 and 2010 DW estimates, $17.5 to $43.9 billion using Method 2, and $5.1 to $11.3 billion using Method 3, varying with the likelihood of anemia (low to high). shows how the burden estimates differ by region, annual wage, and productivity loss method used. In most regions, using the GNI per capita resulted in a burden 1.8 to 2.7 times higher (depending on the region) than when using the minimum wage, regardless of the calculation method, with the exception the Western Pacific, where estimates using GNI per capita were 4.0 fold higher than using minimum wage.\n\nThe cost per hookworm infection with consequent health outcomes (i.e., heavy intensity infection, hookworm-associated anemia, and cognitive impairment) is an estimated $56 (95% UI: $52–59) in Africa, $215 (95% UI: $203–227) in the Americas, $86 (95% UI: $80–94) in the Eastern Mediterranean, $202 (95% UI: $184–216) in Europe, $48 (95% UI: $45–51) in South East Asia, and $183 (95% UI: $178–187) in the Western Pacific (Method 1, median likelihood of anemia, 2004 DW estimates, GNI per capita). Using the 2010 DW estimates, these increased to $120 (95% UI: $24–415) in Africa, $447 (95% UI: $40–1,693) in the Americas, $176 (95% UI: $17–672) in the Eastern Mediterranean, $406 (95% UI: $20–1,595) in Europe, $99 (95% UI: $9–370) in South East Asia, and $375 (95% UI: $30–1,414) in the Western Pacific. Using minimum wage as a proxy for per capita productivity, the cost per hookworm infection is an estimated $24 (95% UI: $23–25) in Africa, $82 (95% UI: $77–89) in the Americas, $47 (95% UI: $45–50) in the Eastern Mediterranean, $80 (95% UI: $71–87) in Europe, $25 (95% UI: $24–26) in South East Asia, and $45 (95% UI: $44–45) in the Western Pacific (using 2004 DW estimates). There is considerable variation in different countries due to per capita productivity proxy assumed (GNI per capita vs. minimum wage), DW estimates used (2004 vs. 2010), and variations in the 2010 DW estimates.\n\nA closer look at individual countries shows that China’s 35,917,360 hookworm infections with consequent health outcomes result in $6.7 billion in productivity losses using GNI per capita, $1.7 billion in productivity losses using minimum wage, and 862,017 DALYs annually. In India, 11,781,041 hookworm-associated health outcomes cost $471 million (GNI per capita; $258 million using minimum wage) with 282,75 DALYs lost. Brazil’s estimated 1,355,874 infections with consequent health outcomes cost $398 million and $80 million in productivity losses using GNI per capita and minimum wage, respectively (and 32,541 DALYs) annually. In Africa, Nigeria harbors the largest hookworm burden with 3,738,750 infections with consequent health outcomes costing $283 million using GNI per capita and $99 million using minimum wage, and accruing 89,730 DALYs.\n\nAgain, results were robust to changes in the infection intensity threshold. Assuming a median likelihood of anemia, 2004 DW estimates, and GNI per capita, 89,765,729 hookworm infections that accrue health outcomes globally resulted in productivity losses totaling $11.1 billion (95% UI: $5.5–18.5 billion) utilizing Method 1, $87.9 billion (95% UI: $1.7–302.3 billion) utilizing Method 2, and $23.1 (95% UI: $11.4–38.4 billion) utilizing Method 3. Using minimum wage, the global burden calculated using Method 1 was $3.3 billion (2004 DW estimates) and $6.5 billion (2010 DW estimates); using Method 2 and 3, productivity losses totaled $25.1 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively."
