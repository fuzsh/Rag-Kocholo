Mary W. Neal

Born January 28, 1926

Returned to the Lord April 6, 2014

Mary W. Neal passed from this life to join her Lord in Heaven early Sunday morning, April 6, 2014, from her Kirkland home.

Born to Dicie and David Caldwell in Wheeling, Arkansas, Mary spent her childhood in the Midwest, moving from Arkansas to Oklahoma and Illinois. She graduated from Altamont High School in Altamont, Illinois in 1944. Following high school she moved to St. Louis, Missouri where she worked as a keypunch/teletype operator. It was during her time there that she met and married Roy E. Neal. Traveling to Washington on their honeymoon, they decided to stay and make Kirkland their home.

Mary is survived by her four children, Dave (Sheree) Neal, Cindy (Frank) McComb, Shelly (Greg) Luerding and Molly Wing; 18 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren. She was a devoted wife and mother who adored her family and cherished her grandchildren, rejoicing in each of their accomplishments. Known for her cheerfulness, thoughtfulness, generosity and deep love for children, she had many friends and never knew a stranger.

Her friends and family will miss her greatly until we meet again.
