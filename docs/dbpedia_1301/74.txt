Mary Lou Neal, known affectionately as Mary, peacefully passed away at Baylor Hospital in Dallas on October 24, 2023. She was born on July 8, 1944, in Dallas, Texas to her loving parents, John A. Gaston and Floy Gaston. Mary's journey through life was marked by the love of her husband, Troy C. Neal, an unwavering dedication to her family, a fulfilling career as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), and a zest for hobbies that brought her immense joy.

Mary's career as a CNA was a testament to her compassionate nature and selflessness. She wholeheartedly dedicated herself to the care of others, providing comfort and support during their most vulnerable moments. Her professionalism and innate ability to connect with patients set her apart, leaving an indelible mark on those whose lives she touched.

Beyond her career, Mary nurtured a deep love for reading. Often staying up until the late hours of the night, she immersed herself in books that transported her to different worlds and ignited her imagination. This passion for literature was an integral part of who she was and added a distinct charm to her character.

Mary's connection with the earth extended beyond the pages of books. Alongside her beloved, Troy, she took pride in being a dairy farmer. Together, they embraced the challenges and rewards that came with tending to their farm. Their commitment to this way of life showcased their resilience and unwavering work ethic.

In moments of leisure, Mary found solace in cheering for her favorite sports teamsâ€”NASCAR races had her on the edge of her seat; Dallas Cowboys football games invoked passionate displays of vocal support, while Texas Rangers baseball games allowed her to revel in the sport's excitement. These hobbies provided a sense of camaraderie and added a lively touch to her vibrant spirit.
