        "text": "Well, its been awhile since I posted on these message boards and a lot of information has come my way. Very different than what I originally thought.\n\nIn January of this year I finally found the marriage record of my great grandparents, Peter O'Neill and Mary Alexander. Not in Ireland as I thought, but in England. They were married in St. George's Catholic Church on 25 Dec 1879 in Southwark, London, England. Peter was listed as Neil on his marriage record, so that threw me off the trail until somone recently suggested I search without using the 'O'. If I would have thought of that sooner I would have saved myself a lot of frustration. Their father's were listed on the marriage record as John Neil and William Alexander (deceased). Peter and Mary's first-born son John was also baptized at the same church, so I now have his birthdate. I then checked the 1881 England/Wales census. Peter, Mary and John were listed as O'Neill. On this census it gave Peter's place of birth as Ireland, but Mary's was London, England. Again different information from what I had. When I checked the 1891 E/W census Mary was listed as Mary Neal, widowed with 4 sons. John 11, Peter 6, Joseph 4, Patrick 2.. The birthplace for all 4 boys was given as London, England. My father had always claimed his father Peter was born in Kings Co. Ireland, (in fact that's what was on his WWI attestation papers), but now it looks like it was his grandfather Peter that was the one born there instead. I'm in the process now of ordering birth records from the GRO in England. I also found a death record for Peter O'Neill in 1890 so that kind of fits this situation, so I'll be ordering it too. So now I know Peter was born in Ireland and probably his father John was too, but I have no idea how I'm going to find the right birth/baptism record for Peter without his mothers name, or a marriage record for his father John. I think there are more John's in Ireland than Peter's. Then Peter and Mary's son John, the oldest of the 4 boys was in Ireland in 1926 when his youngest brother died in Canada. I have no idea whether he got married in England and then went to Ireland or whether he went to Ireland first, then got married there.\n\nThe mystery continues.........It would be wonderful if my information rang a bell for any of John's descendants in Ireland.\n\nUpdate Jul 2016\n\nI searched FamilySearch.org and found a death registration for Peter Neil so I ordered a copy. He died 24 Feb 1890 in St. Olave Southwark, London, England. The widow, Mary Neil, resided at 1 Woolf St. Bermondsey, London, England\n\nIn the 1901 England census I found Joseph Oneill listed as an inmate at St Joseph and St Anne Orphanage, Farnborough, sub-registration district Orpington, Kent, England. He was born at St Saviour, London, England abt 1888. I also found a Patrick Oneill born in London, England abt 1889 in the same orphanage.\n\nGiven the early death of their father in 1890, I assume, but have not proven the four boys were put into St. Joseph and St. Anne Orphanage. By the 1901 Census John and Peter would have both been over 16 and had already left the orphanage.\n\nPeter married in 1909 in Ottawa, Ontario and raised a family of 7 children. Joseph and Patrick eventually ended up living in the South Porcupine area of Ontario and were miners. A few years ago I found an obituary for Paddy in a 1926 South Porcupine, ON newspaper. He was married with a 1 yr old daughter, Mary. Besides Peter and Joseph the obit also included the name of another surviving brother, John in Ireland, so at some point John left England and moved to Ireland. I found a John O'Neill in the British Army WW1 Service Records. He was in the Royal Irish Regiment, born abt 1879, married in Chapelizod Dublin on 5 Feb 1910, his residence was 15 Coombe St. Dublin and had two sons, John & Patrick. Don't know if this is the fourth brother, but dates & names seem right.\n\nWith all the information I had, including the many variants of the name O'Neill I sent for the birth record of Peter (my grandfather) and when it arrived he was listed as Peter Neal, but the parents were the right ones, Peter & Mary Neal, formerly Alexander. He was actually born on 2 Sept 1884 in London, England, not the 8 Sept 1886 in Ireland, as I believed.\n\nNext I ordered the birth record of Joseph. I received it on June 30, 2016. He was listed as Joseph Niel , but the parents were again the right ones, Peter Niel and Mary Ann, formerly Alexander. Joseph was born on 14 Jan 1887, not 9 Feb 1886, as was on his military record.\n\nOn July 02, 2016 I ordered the birth record of Patrick. It has not yet arrived.\n\nOn July 08, 2016 I ordered the birth record of John. It also has not yet arrived, but from the 1881 census I know John was born abt. 1879/1880.\n\nI've made a lot of headway this year, but there is still more to discover, such as finding John O'Neill's descendants in Ireland.\n\nMy previous birth information for John: John Neil, born 27 December 1879, son of Peter Neil and Mary, formerly Alexander.\n\nYesterday I received his birth record from the GRO in England. The information on it was John Neale, born 17 January 1880, son of Peter Neale and Mary Neale, formerly Alexander..\n\nThree boys, three different variants of O'Neill. On the parents marriage record it was spelled Neil. On the 1881 E/W census it was spelled O'Neil. It will be interesting to see how Patrick's name is spelled when his birth record arrives.\n\nIts Aug. 5 and Patrick's birth record arrived yesterday. His name was spelled Neil. His d.o.b. was 26 March 1889, not 25 March 1892 that was on his death record, so he was 37 when he died instead of 34. Still way too young. Now that I have the birth record for all 4 brothers plus the death record for their father Peter in 1890 I guess the next step will be to investigate the fact that on the 1901 E/W census both Joseph O'Neill and Patrick O'Neill were listed as inmates in St. Joseph and St. Anne Orphanage in Farnborough, Co. Kent, England. What happened that they ended up there? Did their mother die or could she not take care of 4 boys after the death of her husband? Where were Peter and John in 1901? I haven't found them yet. John would have been 21 and Peter 17 in September, both too old to still be in an orphanage. Is this when John went to Ireland and Peter to Canada? Hopefully, I can find out.\n\nHello:\n\nThe Chronicles works by your creating a profile. If you click onto the XO Chronicles tab at the top of the page, you will see a new screen for the Chronicles.\n\nThere are three themes: People (Ancestor) Building and Timeline(Event).\n\nYou will probably want to use the People theme. You will see a Discover & Create orange button. Click on that button and you will be directed to a list of People who have been added.\n\nYou can then create your own profile. The only rules for People are that they are over 100 years old and no longer living. It doesn't matter how much/how little information you have. The Chronicles are read widely and very often, there are others out there searching for the same family.\n\nIf you have any difficulties, please get back to me at: jhalloranryan@irelandxo.com. I will be happy to help.\n\nBy the way, you have done really terrific research to get as far as you have with your O'Neills!\n\nKind regards,\n\nJane.\n\nUpdate Jul 23, 2017\n\nLast Sep or Oct I emailed the Diagrama Foundation in England about accessing the case records of my grandfather and his three brothers. This foundation now holds the records for the St. Joseph and St. Anne Orphanage in England. I won't say too much, but after waiting almost 9 mon. the information I received was so very disappointing. The records did show that the two youngest were in the care of the Southwark Local Authority and it was suggested I contact the Practice Manager for Adoption Support which I did yesterday. Now the waiting begins again to see if she will give me any information about my grandfather and his brothers.\n\nThroughout those months of waiting on the Diagrama Foundation I one day got the idea to search for the Baptism record of my great grandfather Peter O'Neill who was born in Ireland, according to his marriage record and the 1881 E/W census. Into the search engine of findmypast.co.uk I put the name Peter O'Neill, born between 1850 and 1860 Ireland with a father named John and got 16 hits. Only one had a father named John O'Neill. The mother was Bridget Quinn. This Peter was baptized in Apr 1860 in Clonallon, Dromore, Co. Down. Two others didn't have parents listed so I looked at the original transcript and although it was hard to read neither name looked like it was John. The balance of the 16 all had different fathers than John. This is becoming more and more confusing. I feel this Peter O'Neill must be my ggrandfather, but have no idea how to prove if this is actually true. If it is true then where did the King's Co. come from that my grandfather listed as his place of birth on his WW1 military records?\n\nHello Dill. You need to bear in mind that keeping of registers in Ireland didn't all start at the same time in each parish. Not all which once existed survived. Some surviving ones may not yet have been transcribed. Some parts of those which have been transcribed may be difficult or even impossible to read. Transcriptions of names may be inaccurate, through no fault of the transcriber. Marriage and baptism registers cover different years in some parishes .\n\nI found the baptism entry for my grandfather in1850s Mayo. None of his elder siblings appeared. Then I learned that there was a gap of several years between the end of one register and start of the next surviving volume. I guess the elder children were all born during the missing years. I searched fruitlessly for baptism of the youngest sister. When I saw an image of later register pages I understood why I couldn't find her name. I was going to say \"it became clear\" but \"clear\" was the exact opposite of what I saw. Some pages were singed as if the book had been rescued from a fire, or a lighted candle had fallen on it. Writing on some pages was almost obliterated. A register in another parish for grandmother's family was fine in parts but at one stage it seemed to me that the priet's eyesight was failing, or he'd had a stroke or some other disability affected his writing. Then a new incumbent filled the subsequent pages in neat handwriting in the correct columns.\n\nHave you checked a list of surviving parish registers for the county? It also has locations of copies and indicates which have been transcribed and indexed.\n\nAs regards your ancestors in the orphanage, do you know that adoption was informal in England until 1920s?"
