        "text": "The NEAL Family Line\n\nCreated 08-Apr-2006\n\nRobert M. Sharp is the fifth lineal descendant of Daniel Neal. This relationship is through his Sharp family. Little is known about Daniel Neal or his ancestry. After his marriage in Stokes Co, NC in 1824 he is found in the 1840 census residing in Green Twsp, Wayne Co, IN. He was buried in Wayne Co, IN in 1845. It is possible that Daniel is related to other Neals residing in the Wayne Co and Randolph Co area. A William Neal is old enough to be Daniel's father.

Other names are William Rudrow who is Joshua's brother-in-law. Also listed is a Nathan Hockett. Joshua's daughter, Mary Jane, married a Nathan Hockett. The one in the census is an earlier genration, maybe father or uncle. Very good chance William Neal is somehow related to our Neals. Land records or wills might have the answer.

IN in the 1850 census. They have two young children, Montraville, age 3, and Ruth A., age 1, living in the household in that census. Joseph is very likely the brother of Benjamin S.

Battey & Co. http://www.iltrails.org/cumber land/neogabios.html\n\nDAVID NEAL, farmer and stock dealer, is a native of North Carolina, born June 27, 1826, son of Daniel and Letitia [Perdue] Neal, is the second oldest in a family of twelve children, and is of French-Irish blood. The parents of Mr. Neal were also natives of North Carolina and early settlers of Indiana, having in 1831 emigrated to Wayne County, that State. His father was one of the most enterprising and prominent of Indianaï¿½s early men. The Democratic Party always had in him a true representative and earnest advocate. His death occurred in Wayne County, Ind., in 1845. The mother of Mr. Neal now resides in Randolph County, of that State. When the twenty-second anniversary of the birth of the subject of this mention came around, it found him out in the sea of life for himself. February 12, 1850, he was by the holy bonds of matrimony united in marriage to Miss Martha Rainier, a native of New Jersey. To this union has been born five children, viz; Sarah E., William R., John C., Benjamin F. and Mary A.. Of these, three are living. In 1865 Mr. Neal came to Cumberland County, and settled in Neoga Township, where he has since resided. Mr. Neal now owns 200 acres of good land. His farm is one of the best improved in Cumberland County, and one of the most productive. He is one of those men that believes in the advancement of science in agriculture as much as anything else, and the condition of his farm warrants such fact. Politically, Mr. Neal has Democratic convictions, and is one of the leaders of his party in the county. In 1880, he was elected Supervisor of Neoga Township, and served one term. Mr. Neal is a man of more than ordinary qualifications, and is well informed on all leading issues of the day. He is worthy of the extensive respect he commands.\n\nCUMBERLAND COUNTY ILLINOIS, \"SOME FOLKS WHO LIVED THERE\" IN 1884 (THIS LIST WAS COPIED FROM FHL FILM #0962163) http://www.iltrails.org/cumber land/1884men.html\n\nNeal, David wife Martha Rainier\n\nNeal, William 1st wife Rebecca C.
