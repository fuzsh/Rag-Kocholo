General Notes: Monongalia County, West Virginia - MARRIAGES 1794 THRU 1800 A courthouse fire resulted in the destruction of the earliest marriage records for Monongalia County.

About ten years ago, the book of marriage bonds for this county was brought from the courthouse basement and photocopied. These bonds may now be ordered from the courthouse. No attempt has been made to coordinate this list with the bonds to ascertain if the bonds for any of these marriages are present. The bonds, if available, have the signatures of the bondsmen and sometimes reveal the parents of the parties involved. Found Marriage Record: Oneal, Joseph, Thompson, Elizabeth, 23 March 1796.
