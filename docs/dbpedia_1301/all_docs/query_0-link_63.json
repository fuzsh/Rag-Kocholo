So that would leave out Jesse, Harvey and John. One son, in the 20-30 age. That son would not be John because he was already married, Jesse is probably already in ARK, he gets married in 1841. It is most likely Harvey, as he would be ca 19 yrs of age.\n\nSo that leaves Jefferson Thomas Roseberry.

He was born Abt. 1795 in VA.\n\nNotes for Abner Hall:\n\nNames and dates and marriage information for children of Abner and Jane Roseberry Hall came from Fauna Mihalko Collection at the Jefferson County Historical Society. Some of this information is not consistent with information found by other researchers.\n\nEthel Cline says that Abner married Marianne Degrooms 2-28-1822 and Nancy Bennett 2-25-1823. this would mean that Jane had probably died by 1822. Abner was on the Jennings Co., IN census from 1820 through 1840 and disappeared from the census by 1850.\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\n1820 Jennings Co.

I'M glad I don't do this for a living!\n\nJames Hazle\n\n***********************************************************\n\nNotes for Abner Hall:\n\nAbner Hall was a minister of God. I do not know of what protestant faith he plied his calling. He preformed several marriages in Jennings County, Indiana.\n\nOn the 1820 Indiana census, Abner is living in Jennings Co., Indiana with his wife and two sons under five years of age. His wife on this census will be Jane Roseberry, whom he married in 1816 in Jefferson County Indiana. Although I have no proof at this time that he was the other son of Jane Roseberry and Abner Hall: I very much suspect that a young Abner Hall, who ran a Sawmill near Deputy, in Graham township of Jefferson Co., adjacent to the Roseberry farm to be their other son. His age is correct to fit the profile of one of the two boys in Abner Hall's household at the time of the 1820 U.S. census. The young Abner's sonship I cannot prove, since only Silas Hall signed the probate records as an heir of Jane Roseberry, when his grandfather, Thomas Roseberry's estate was settled in Jefferson Co., Indiana during 1853. The fact that Silas received only a 'half' share causes me to assume, there was another living heir to that portion of Thomas Roseberry's estate which fell to the children of his deceased daughter, Jane 'Roseberry' Hall, who had died some thirty year earlier. This young Abner Hall, who married Malinda Walton, has been assigned as the son of Isaac Hall and a nephew to the elder Abner by another researcher of the Hall family.\n\nThe elder Abner Hall is a resident of Jennings County at the time of the 1830 U.S. census. He is listed with his wife, one son under five, one son ten to fifteen and two daughters under five years of age. Assuming that Silas was the younger of the two boys and that Abner's oldest son, who should have been about age thirteen, was perhaps living with his Roseberry grandparents: Then Silas Hall's age profile will become a near fit for him being this son listed on the 1830 U.S. census as ten to fifteen years of age. If the elder son is not living away from Abner's household, then he will have died before 1830. Only one child listed on the 1830 census comes close to the age profile of Abner and Jane 'Roseberry' Hall's two sons listed on the 1820 U.S. census. According to the date on Silas Hall's tomb stone in Bates Co., Missouri, he should have still been only nine year old at the time the 1830 census was taken. However, Silas' birth date is not actually stated on this stone; only his age in years, months and days at the time of his death are given, thus opening the possibility for an error to have been made in calculating his age.\n\nVery likely, Abner Hall and his second wife, Marianne Degrooms, had no children; at least none who survived. They were married on Feb. 28, 1822. Abner Hall married for the third time on Feb. 25, 1823. Thus the duration of Abner's second marriage can be calculated as somewhat less than one year. It is my suspicion that Marianne died during childbirth, as was likely the case for Abner's first wife, Jane Roseberry. The 1830 census lists three children in Abner Hall's household under the age of five: one son and two daughters. The ages of these children will cause all three to be the issue of Abner Hall and his third wife, Nancy Bennett, whom he married in 1823. There may have been more children than three born to Abner and Nancy before his death.\n\nAbner Hall family is listed as a resident of Decatur Co., Ind. on the 1840 U.S. census, but is not listed as a resident of Indiana in 1850. Likely he has died prior to that time. A professional genealogist has supposedly traced Abner Hall's ancestry back to 1674 in New York state, and I have that information. However, I have not found, nor seen documentation which will identify Abner Hall's parents, and I suspect a generous amount of creative assumption was used in compiling his ancestry, for the following reasons. Every census report thru 1880, where Silas Hall lists the birth state of his father, he has given it as Virginia. This researcher, gives Abner Hall's birth state as Penn. or New Jersey. This researcher has estimated Abner Hall's birth year as being 1804: An 1804 birth year will cause Abner Hall to have married Jane Roseberry when he was only twelve year old. Until I find proof of Abner Hall's parentage; I make no attempt to document the Hall family beyond him.\n\nChildren of Jane Roseberry and Abner Hall are:\n\n41 i. Thomas3 Hall, born Bef. 1820.\n\nNotes for Thomas Hall:\n\nAccording to information found in a file from the Fauna Mihalko Collection from the Jefferson County Historical Society, Thomas Hall bought land in Decatur co., IN in 1841.

S. census reports, Silas Hall is listed as a resident of Graham Twp., Jefferson County, Indiana. At the time of the 1860 U.S. census, he is a 38 year old cooper (barrel maker), with a wife, two sons and one daughter in his household. Wife, Elizabeth gives her age as 35, and her state of birth as Kentucky. The 1870 U.S. census report for Jefferson Co., Indiana, lists Silas Hall's wife as \"Elizabeth\", but gives her birth state as Indiana. Elizabeth 'Howell' Hall has died shortly after the taking of the 1860 census and Silas has remarried. Scott County, Indiana marriage records reveal that Silas Hall married Elizabeth 'Chastain' Roseberry in May of 1861. She was the widow of Silas Hall's first cousin, Harvey Roseberry. Harvey and Elizabeth Chastain became the parents of six children before his death. At the time of the 1870 U.S. census, Elizabeth 'Roseberry' Hall's thirteen year old son, Calvin is her only Roseberry child still living in her household. Calvin is listed alongside the Hall children in the Silas Hall home, with no note of a different surname than Hall. Calvin will make the migration with the Silas Hall family to Bates Co. in western Missouri: I suspect this migration was made during 1871.\n\nJefferson County Indiana marriage records indicate that Silas Hall and his first wife, Elizabeth Howell were married on August 6, 1844, and had been married about sixteen years at the time of Elizabeth Howell's death, some time after the U.S. census was taken in 1860. It is possible that more than the three known children were born to this couple, but none others lived long enough to be enumerated on any census report.\n\nI believe the westward move of the Silas Hall family likely occurred some time after the 1870 U. S. census was taken in Jefferson County, Indiana, but before December, 1871, when daughter, Eliza Jane, married in Bates County, Missouri. The youngest son, Milton Hall, also moved his family to Missouri, but evidence indicates that he moved at a later date. Children were born to Milton & Permelia Hall in Indiana after 1872; making it unlikely they made the move to Missouri with the rest of the family. There is a possibility, although unproven; that Silas Hall's daughter, Eliza Jane, earlier moved westward with some of the Roseberry kin and married before the arrival of her Hall family. If this be the case, Milton Hall likely made the trip westward with his father.\n\nOn the 1880 U.S. census for Missouri; Silas Hall is listed as a resident of Bates County, Hudson Twp.. He gives his age as 58; his occupation as farmer, and his state of birth as Indiana. Silas Hall states that his father was born in Virginia and his mother was born in Indiana. His wife, Elizabeth, gives her age as 53, and her state of birth as Indiana. Both Thomas and Milton Hall give their mother's place of birth as Indiana on the 1880 and again on the 1900 U.S. census reports. This birth state will not agree with information given by their mother, Elizabeth 'Howell' Hall on the 1860 U.S. census for Jefferson Co., Indiana, where her birth state is shown as Kentucky.\n\nSilas Hall and second wife, Elizabeth 'Roseberry' , were the parents of one child; a daughter, named Lovisa. Lovisa will be a half sister to the three children shown in Silas Hall's household, on the 1860 U.S. census, and a half sister to Elizabeth's six Roseberry children. There are twelve years between the birth of Eliza J. in 1852 and the birth of Lovisa in 1864.\n\nThere is an un-verified story which tells that Elizabeth 'Roseberry' Hall, died near Joplin Missouri in 1897. We have made a thorough search of cemetery records for Newton County, Missouri and did not find an Elizabeth Hall, aged appx. 70, buried in that county, during this time period. I also made a partial search of cemetery records in the adjoining Missouri counties with the same results. What became of her after Silas Hall's death in 1890 is still a mystery.\n\nOn the 1880 U.S. census for Missouri, Silas and Elizabeth Hall have only their sixteen year old, Indiana born daughter, Lovisa, in their household. This is the last U.S. census report on which Silas Hall will appear, as he died on February 3, 1890. Silas Hall was laid to rest in the Gilbreath Cemetery, located near the St. Clair County line, just inside Bates County, Missouri. This cemetery's exact location is: From the present day Hudson School, which is located on Highway # 71, two mile West of Appleton City, Missouri; go 1/4 mile back East to a county road. Go South on this county road for 6/10 of a mile where it intersects with a county road from the West: Proceed West for 3/4 of a mile, the Gilbreath Cem. lies north of this point, about one quarter of a mile in a pasture owned by a man named Johannegmeyer. It is possible that his burial in the Gilbreath Cemetery will have been the last to be made there. This small cemetery, located in Section #2 of Twp 39N / Range 29W, of Bates County, Missouri, has been abandoned for many years. Most of the graves in this cemetery are presently unmarked and overgrazed by cattle. Silas Hall's grave marker owns the latest date of those few in this cemetery which were marked with a dated stone.\n\nMore About Silas Hall:\n\nOccupation: 1850, Cooper\n\n43 iii.

Obviously, Milton and Cemantha had moved before 14 Sept. 1850. Probably other family members, such as Horatio Nelson Lard and his wife Eliza Ann Waldsmith, joined them later. Maybe because of Eliza's relationship with Cemantha? Can you comment on this, Ardath?\n\nBook 9, p. 489 - Milton S. Roseberry and Samantha [sic] Roseberry his wife, of Shelby Co., Indiana sell to C.

He was born in Scott county, Kentucky, in the year 1793.\n\nIn 1834, when the Madison branch of the State Bank of Indiana was organized, General Stapp was appointed its cashier. In a short time he resigned this position, to take the presidency of the Madison Savings Institution, a bank of discount and deposit. He remained at the head of this institution so long as it transacted business.\n\nIn 1850 General Stapp was elected mayor of Madison, the last office he held in Indiana. He made a most excellent mayor, certainly as good a one as the city ever had. He administered the law fearlessly and without favor. He had the intelligence to know his duty and the courage to perform it. He never filled an office with so much honor to himself and with so much acceptability to the people.\n\nIn the spring of 1853 General Stapp bought a half interest in the Madison Daily Banner, and took editorial charge of the paper. He continued to direct its columns until he died.\n\nJust bits and pieces of his Biographical sketch from Jefferson Co, Indiana web site\n\nNancy 6-13-2007\n\nMarriage Notes for Milton Roseberry and Cemantha Buckingham:\n\nMarriage information shows brides name spelled \"Samantha\".\n\nChildren of Milton Roseberry and Cemantha Buckingham are:\n\n109 i.
