        "text": "Mary is a compassionate attorney who knows the importance of her client’s family, time, and money. She strives to keep her clients in control of their outcomes by encouraging settlement outside of the courtroom but does not hesitate to take a case to trial to advocate her clients’ positions.\n\n​\n\nMary has a well-rounded family law practice, having experience in division of estates in the millions with complex business assets and handling both termination of parental rights and adoptions. However, she has found a niche in High Conflict Child Custody Litigation. Through this practice, she assists in bringing the focus back to the best interests of the children by encouraging professional involvement for the whole family to learn and encourage better communication skills, coping mechanisms, parenting and co-parenting skills, and minimizing ongoing conflict.\n\n​\n\nOriginally from Garland, Texas, Mary is a proud sixth-generation Texan and citizen of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with her husband while attacking her bucket list of visiting every state. Mary’s favorite seasons include Texas Rangers baseball and Texas Longhorns football."
