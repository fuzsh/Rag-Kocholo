        "text": "Ken's Brown--Hartley Roots\n\nWritten by Ken Brown (updated in December 2015)\n\nEven though I was born and spent my childhood in southwest Missouri (the City of Ava in Douglas County) and Joy in southeast Missouri (the village of Pascola in Pemiscot County), we both moved to different parts of Kansas when we were teenagers. When a Junior in High School, Joy moved to Kansas City, Kansas, to live with her brother, Wesley, while I moved to Wichita when in the eighth grade. I graduated from Wichita South High School in 1962, attended Wichita's Friends University in 1962-63, and transferred to Emporia State University for the 1963-64 year. Joy graduated from Kansas City's Argentine High School in 1963 and entered Emporia State at the same time as me. I graduated from Wichita State University in 1966.\n\nKen's Parents (Jake and Kiree Brown)\n\nMy parents, James Orville \"Jake\" Brown (b. 1910-d. 1949), and Mildred Kiree Hartley (b. 1911-d.1999), met in Ava around 1930, a time when Kiree (locally pronounced as 'Cree') was attending Ava High School, and Jake was working as a carpenter in Ava and helping on his folks' farm south of Ava. Kiree lived in a rooming house with Jake's sister, Lulu, and Jake asked Lulu to introduce him to the girl with the long black curly hair.\n\nWhile the locals always called him \"Jake\" Kiree preferred to call him \"Orville.\" Orville and Kiree were married on Valentine's Day, 1932, at the Dogwood Church in northwestern Douglas County. Over the next several years, they lived on the Brown place south of Ava or in the Valley, Nebraska, area where Orville worked for a Nebraska farmer.\n\nOrville and Kiree were blessed with five children as follows:\n\nEvelyn Marie (b. 29 Dec 1932 in Douglas County, Missouri)\n\n(Now living at Jordan Valley Nursing & Rehab Center in Springfield, Missouri)\n\nJanalea (b. 12 Feb 1934 in Douglas County, Missouri) (d. 24 Sep 1981 in Kansas City, Missouri).\n\nIris Ann (b. 26 Mar 1939 in Omaha, Nebraska) (Now living in the Kansas City area).\n\nJames Wendell (b. 2 Dec 1942 in Douglas County, Missouri) (d.20 Sep 1966 in Wichita, Kansas)\n\nKenneth Wayne (b. 9 Feb 1945 in Douglas County, Missouri) (Now living in Springfield, MO).\n\nIn the 1940s, Orville contracted tuberculosis, and his failing health caused him to turn from farming to retailing. He founded and operated the Brown Furniture Co. in Ava during the late 1940s until his health forced him to sell it also. The store was located in an old frame building northwest of the Ava Square on the site of the present Ava Drug Co. He died on 12 Mar 1949, in the Tuberculosis Sanatorium at Mt. Vernon, MO.\n\nAfter Orville's death, Kiree attended the local teachers college (now Missouri State University) long enough to qualify for a Missouri teacher's certificate. From 1950 until 1957, she taught in one-room schools around Douglas County, MIssouri (specifically Mt. Tabor, Dogwood, Flat Rock, Hunter, and Frye schools).\n\nIn 1957, Kiree moved to Wichita, Kansas, with her teenage sons James and Kenneth, and began teaching elementary grades in the Sedgwick County and Wichita school systems there. She returned to Ava in 1969 and taught in the Ava Public Schools before her retirement in 1975. Kiree moved to Springfield in 1978 and lived at 320 East Glenwood until 1996 at which time she entered the Manor Care Health Center where she resided until her death on November 8, 1999. She was buried by her husband's side in the Ava Cemetery on November 12, 1999.\n\nMy mother, Kiree Hartley Brown, was a genealogist, and through her work and that of others, I is able to trace the Brown line back to the early 1830s settlement days of Douglas County, MO. and the Hartley ancestors back to the 1840s in neighboring Wright/Webster counties and even earlier to Tennessee.\n\nKen's Paternal Ancestors (Brown and Morris)\n\nMy great-great Grandfather, Elihu/Lyhue Brown (b. ca 1820 in Kentucky) (d. ca 1848 in Douglas County, Missouri), married Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Hall, ca 1836 and immediately moved to Bryant Creek in Douglas County, MO, just a short time after the territorial Indians were vacated from the area. (A manuscript that I've written on \"Betsy\" is available on my Historical Writings Page).\n\nBefore Lyhue's death in ca 1846-49, he and Elizabeth had four children:\n\nGeorge W. (b. ca 1837 in Douglas portion of old Taney County, MO), (d. 19 Mar 1882 in Douglas County, MO)\n\nSarah Ann Stotts Turner (b. ca 1840 in Douglas portion of old Taney County, MO) (d. 12 Jan. 1892 in Douglas County, MO).\n\nJesse G.--Ken's great-grandfather (b. 1842 in Douglas portion of old Taney County, MO) (d. 12 May 1900 in Douglas County, MO).\n\nIsaac (b. 8 Oct 1846 in Douglas portion of old Ozark County, MO), (d. 18 Mar 1909 near Cleveland, OK).\n\nAfter Lyhue's death, Elizabeth \"Betsy\" married Hiram Stout around 1850, but he died in the mid 1850s after they had a son, James Stout (b. 1854). After Hiram's death, Elizabeth moved to north of present-day Ava in Douglas County close to her Hall family. She was living among the Halls during the 1860 Census. Later she moved to south of Ava in the Spring Creek area where her sons had their own places. There, south of Ava, Elizabeth married a third time to John Walker. She died between 1870 and 1880.\n\nMy Great-Grandfather, Jesse G. Brown, owned a farm just east of where Spring Creek crosses Mo. Highway 5 in Douglas County about five miles south of Ava. In ca 1862, Jesse G. married Mary Ann Burton. In her family history book entitled Squire-Brown-Burton, Laura Lee Moncrief said the following: \"After Jesse and Mary Ann were married, they settled on his farm in Spring Creek Township in Douglas County, MO, next to his mother and brother George. According to his granddaughter, Rosa Davis, this original 30-40 acre farm of Jesse's was in Section 1 of Spring Creek Township and was known as the Old Huffman Place. Grandson Sherman Brown said that Jesse got this farm by trading a gun and a hunting dog to a coon hunter. This farm was where Jesse Brown lived with his first wife, Mary Ann, and all their children were born.\"\n\nWhen the Civil War broke out, it was impossible to stay neutral living in the border area of Douglas County, MO. Jesse enrolled in the Mo. Home Guards, Sep. 21, 1864. He was in Company M of the 73rd Enrolled Mo. Militia Infantry [Union forces]. While he served in the militia, Jesse was in the Battle of Fox Creek in Eastern Douglas County. He was captured and held prisoner at Fox Creek. On Mar. 11, 1865, he was discharged from the service at Forsyth, MO. The children of Jesse and Mary were as follows:\n\nLouise E. Turner (b. 29 Jun 1863 in Douglas County, MO) (d. 14 Aug 1933, Craig County, Okla).\n\nGeorge Henry (b. 4 Jul 1866 in Douglas County, MO) (d. 6 Apr. 1884 in Douglas County, MO).\n\nMartha Frances Squire (b. 17 Jun 1868 in Douglas County) (d. 17 Jan 1936 in Los Angeles CA).\n\nIsaac Sherman (b. 17 Dec. 1870 in Douglas County) (d. 22 Feb 1961 in Douglas County, MO).\n\nJames Lihu--Ken's Grandfather (b. 4 Feb 1873 in Douglas County) (d. 17 Nov. 1935 in Douglas County)\n\nWilliam S. (b. 5 Oct 1876 in Douglas County) (d. 9 Oct 1881 in Douglas County)\n\nAccording to Laura Lee Moncrief, my great-grandmother, Mary Ann (Burton) Brown died of some sort of lung trouble which she developed when she went to Fox Creek to get Jesse back while he was held prisoner there during the Civil War. She died on December 16, 1881. Great-grandfather Jesse G. Brown died on 12 May 1900.\n\nMy Grandfather, James Lihu Brown (\"Uncle Jim\" or \"J.L.\" as he was known), married Amanda Melvina Morris (\"Aunt Mel\" as she was called) on 1 Dec 1891 in Ozark County. Amanda Melvina was a daughter of John W. Morris and Caroline Honeycutt. J.L and Mel operated a farm a short distance to the northeast from his father's old Spring Creek farm. There they raised a family of 12 children as follows:\n\nSherman William (b. 15 Feb 1893) (d. 1 Nov 1980 in Springfield, MO)\n\nRosa Mae (Davis) (b. 1 Oct 1895) (d. 22 Mar 1995 in Ava, MO)\n\nBertha Frances (Davis) (b. 8 Feb 1897) (d. 15 Jun 1990 in Ava, MO)\n\nJohn Jesse (b. 15 May 1898) (d. 16 Nov 1966 in Phoenix AZ)\n\nBessie Vivian (Snook) (b. 28 Jul 1901) (d. 1986 in Little Rock AR)\n\nEverett Thomas (b. 15 Jul 1903) (d. 17 Dec 1989 in Tulsa OK)\n\nVernia Allen (b. 14 Aug 1905) (d. 2 Nov 1918 in Douglas County, MO)\n\nLouis Virgil (b. 13 May 1909) (d. 4 Jun 1987 in Bartlesville OK)\n\nJames Orville--Ken's Father (b. 4 Aug 1910) (d. 12 Mar 1949 in Mt. Vernon, MO)\n\nLulu Minerva (Shrum) (b. 12 Feb 1912) (d. Jun 8 2006 in Lowry City, MO)\n\nCharles Woodrow (b. 19 Apr 1916) (d. 14 Aug 1987 in Bartlesville OK)\n\nLeroy R. (b. 16 Oct 1919) (d. 24 Feb 1981 in Bartlesville OK)\n\nKen's Maternal Ancestors (Hartley and Gunnels)\n\nThe Hartley line has been traced back to Laban Hartley, Sr. b. about 1753 in Maryland -- d. 6 Nov 1843 in Williamson County, Tennessee. Laban has many descendants, including Ken, in Douglas County, MO. Laban's father was Richard Hartley, born in 1730 in Worchester County, MD., and died 1781 in Rowan County, N.C.\n\nA son of Laban Hartley, Sr. was Dennis Hartley (b. 1789 in Rowan County, NC, and died 17 Aug, 1852 in Bedford County, TN). Dennis was Ken's gr-gr-gr grandfather. Dennis's first son, Andrew Joseph Hartley, was born 23 Nov 1812 in Rowan County, NCs and died 20 Jan 1884 in Douglas County, MO. Andrew Joseph Hartley is Ken's great-great grandfather. He moved from Tennessee to present-day Webster County, MO in 1839.\n\nAndrew's first child was William Hartley (b. 10 Mar 1840 in present-day Webster County, MO) (d. 14 Apr 1921 in Douglas County MO). William is Ken's great-grandfather. According to his 1921 obituary, William was a veteran of the Civil War serving for awhile under General William T. Sherman. He enrolled in the Union Army Co. H. 24th Regiment, Missouri infantry in the field on November 20, 1861, and discharged on November 28, 1864. He was 5' 5\" tall. He received an honorable discharge at St. Louis.\n\nWilliam married Margaret Syntha Reynolds (b. 24 Oct 1848 in TN) in October 1865. They had a son, James A. (b. 22 Oct 1866 - d. 9 Jun 1869) and Margaret D. (b. 25 Jul 1868 - d. 24 Oct 1880). William's wife, Margaret, died 24 Jun 1869 . On 22 Dec 1872, William married Sarah Lakey at Arno in western Douglas County, MO. To this union, the following 15 children were born (all near Arno, Douglas County, MO):\n\nFrancis Marion \"Marion\" (b. 19 Sep 1873 - d. 4 Feb 1958 in Ava, Douglas County MO)\n\nWilliam L \"Billy\" . (b. 5 Mar 1875 - d. 31 May 1922 in Douglas County MO)\n\n(Infant) (b. 28 Apr 1876 - d. 28 Apr 1876 in Douglas County MO)\n\nRubin A. (b. 6 May 1877 - d. 18 Nov 1896 in Douglas County, MO)\n\n(Infant) (b. 2 Oct 1878 - d. 2 Oct 1878 in Douglas County MO)\n\nSimon L. (b. 24 Oct 1879 - d. Apr 1900 in Oklahoma City, OK)\n\n(Infant) (b. 24 Apr 1880 - d. 24 Apr 1880 in Douglas County MO)\n\n(Infant) (b. Apr 1882 - d. Apr 1882 in Douglas County MO)\n\nAda C. (b. 10 Sep 1883 - d. 6 Jan 1904 in Douglas County MO)\n\nAlbert Lee (b. 22 Mar 1885 - d. 16 Nov 1961 in Ava, Douglas County MO)\n\nVina Lu \"Effie\" (b. 10 Jun 1886 - d. 16 Apr 1910 in Dougals County MO)\n\nJohn M. (b. 29 Dec 1887 - d. unknown -- last seen in 1913)\n\nDavid Ira \"Ira\" Ken's grandfather (b. 22 Aug 1889 in Douglas County, MO - d. 2 Oct 1929 in Douglas County, MO)\n\nSarah Viola \"Ola\" (Adams) (b. 18 Oct 1891 - d. 3 Aug 1985 in Maricopa County, AZ)\n\nJoel Edward \"Ed\" (b. 7 May 1893 - d. 14 Apr 1979 in Douglas County)\n\nKen's grandfather, David\" Ira\" Hartley, married Tessie Armintia Gunnels in November 1910. She was the daughter of William Gunnels and Sarah Johnston. In local Ozark dialect, his name was pronounced as 'Are-ie' and she was called 'Mintie'.\n\nWhile living at Arno initially, they moved to a rental place further north on the side of Pilot Knob mountain north west of Ava. Eventually, they purchased a place northwest of Arno near Arden in \"Williams Holler.\"\n\nIra and Minta's children were as follows:\n\nMildred Kiree (Brown)--Ken's mother (b. 13 Sep, 1911 - d. 8 Nov. 1999)\n\nWilliam Lawrence (b. 10 Mar 1915) (d. 17 Mar 1982 in Sedgwick County, KS).\n\nEldon Leon (b. 19 Jan 1920) (d. 26 Mar 2000 in Wichita, KS).\n\nDocia Levon (Luttrell) (Elenbarger) (b. 19 Aug 1926) (Now living in northeast Oklahoma).\n\nAfter Ira died in 1929, Minta continued to operate the farm on \"Williams Holler\" continuously until November 1952. After Ira's death, Minta married Charlie Breedlove in 1931. Charlie died in 1935 but Minta retained his surname. While all the grandkids called her \"Grandma Hartley\" she was known to most Douglas Countians as 'Mis' Mintie Breedlove.\"\n\nAfter Charlie Breedlove's death, Grandma Minta operated the Williams Holler farm for many more years with the help of her sons, Lawrence and Eldon and then eventually with the help of her faithful hired hand, Grant Hampton. To many of her grandchildren, Grant was just as much a part of the family as she. He, however, didn't ever discipline us like Grandma did. I remember the day he saved me (as an 8-year old kid) from a cow who chased after me for messing with her calf too much! He was a kind old fellow who we all enjoyed very much. He rolled his own cigarettes and had a face and hands that were like tough old leather.\n\nIn 1952, Minta auctioned off all her farm equipment and belongings she would not need for a house she had purchased in Ava. The house was located on the west side of Ava's main north-south street across from the Ava High School. She continued to have a house there until sometime in the 1970s.\n\nGrandma Hartley's Family (The Gunnels Family)\n\nGrandma Hartley was born Tessie Armintia Gunnels on 27 Jan, 1890, in Douglas County, MO. She died 14 May, 1981, at the Maranatha Nursing Home in Springfield, MO. Her parents were William Nicholas Gunnels (b. 20 Nov. 1863 in Macon County, MO) (d. 6 Aug 1941 in Douglas County, MO), and Sarah Johnston (b. 18 Apr 1866 in Camden County, MO) (d. 21 Aug 1943 in Douglas County, MO).\n\nThis Gunnels family line is believed to be that of Joseph Daniel Gunnels (b. 1760) (d. 1829 in Jackson County, Tennessee. Joseph had three sons: William (b. 1785 - d. 1848); Nicholas Gunnels (b. 12 Mar 1793 in Georgia) (d. 17 Oct 1862 in Macon County, MO); and James Gunnels (b. abt 1796 in Georgia).\n\nNicholas was Ken's great-great-great grandfather. Nicholas married Catherine Dillon in 1817 in Tennessee. Their children were:\n\nHenry Curtis Gunnels--Ken's great-great grandfather (b. Aug 1828 in Overton County, TN) (d. 3 Sep 1905 in Carroll County, AR).\n\nEva Gunnels (b. about 1826)\n\nWilliam Gunnels (b. about 1825)\n\nKen's great-great grandfather, Henry Curtis Gunnels, married Elizabeth Jane Huckeby in 1855. She was born in Missouri around 1833 and died 11 Dec 1867 in Macon County, MO. Their children were as follows:\n\nMarildia Catherine (Garrett)--(Ken's Mom called her 'Aunt Cattie') (b. 2 Apr 1859 in Macon County, MO) (d. 1932 in Douglas County).\n\nTennessee Jane (Hamblin)--(Ken's Mom called her 'Aunt Ten') (b. 6 Jan 1861 in Macon County, MO) (d. unknown date in Oklahoma).\n\nWilliam Nicholas--Ken's Great-Grandfather (b. 20 Nov 1863 in Macon County, MO) (d. 6 Aug 1941 in Douglas County, MO).\n\nJames Jackson (b. 17 Apr 1865 in Macon County, MO) (d. 27 Jun 1957 in Cassville, MO).\n\nNancy Elizabeth (b. 6 Dec 1867 in Macon County, MO and d. 13 Dec 1867 two days after the death of her mother in Macon County)\n\nWilliam Nicholas Gunnels, was known to many as 'Nick.' He married Sarah Jane Johnston on 15 Sep 1885 in Camden County, MO. Born on 18 Apr 1866 in Camden County, MO, Sarah was the daughter of Boon Johnston and Ida Johnson. In the late 1880s, \"Uncle Nick\" and \"Aunt Sarah\" acquired a farm between Goodhope and Arno in Douglas County, Missouri. There they raised six children as follows:"
