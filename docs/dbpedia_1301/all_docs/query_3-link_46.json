I contend that there are just as many miracles occurring today, in the lives of ordinary people. But I also assert that most of us don’t look for miracles, don’t recognize them for what they really are, and don’t really believe them to be of divine origin even if their miraculous nature is noticed.”\n\nExcerpted from To Heaven and Back by Mary C. Neal, MD\n\nDaily Reflection: What miraculous things have you seen God do recently, even though they may have been small?\n\nGod’s Time\n\n“Although I felt God was present and holding me, I was still entirely conscious of my predicament and my surroundings.

He held me and loved me when I was pinned in a waterfall and dying. He kept me from feeling pain or worry. The experience of His presence, love, and compassion reassures me that Willie suffered no pain at the end of his life. His spirit probably left his body long before it was broken, and I feel confident that he was greeted by a host of overjoyed and excited witnesses.”\n\nExcerpted from To Heaven and Back by Mary C.

She was always like a beacon of light in that dark and gloomy building, and many of us would wait longer just to ride in her elevator. She was old, wizened and uneducated.
