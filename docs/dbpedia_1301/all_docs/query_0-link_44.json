She was born near Milford, Seward Co, Nebr on Feb 15,1876 and died in Glendora, Calif on the 27th day of March 1911.\n\nWhen about 7 years of age she came with her parents to Holt Co in 1882, where they settled upon a homestead 6 miles northeast of Atkinson. Here she lived until she grew up to womanhood, and married J W Fullerton. They were married Jan 20,1900. Taking up her residence upon Mr Fullerton's farm, 3 and ½ miles north of town, she lived there until about a month ago, when they went to California, intending to spend the season there. 2 children were born to Mr and Mrs Fullerton, Leslie and Elda, who are now left to the care of other hands than those of the gentle mother.\n\nOn the 27th day of last month, Mrs Fullerton was taken ill with acute pneumonia. The wires flashed the news to her friends here, but the doctors there were hopeful of her recovery.\n\nThe news of her death came as a shock to the community that had known her so long. She died April 2,1911. (that's the way the paper had it)\n\nIn her life she was beautiful and respected by all who knew her. She was a member of the M E Church, and a consistant Christian. While her loss will fall heavily upon the community, she will be the most sorely missed by her husband, mother and children. Besides these she leaves to mourn her early death, 2 brothers GL and Dwight, and 2 sisters Bridie and Mrs Daisy Allen. Her many friends and near relatives join in the sorrow.\n\nThe funeral services were held at the Presbyterian church on Sat last, April 8 and she was layed to rest in the Woodlawn Cem.\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFunk, Louis Reese\n\nborn June 18,1853, Grayson Co, Va\n\nmarried Sept 15,1875 Mahala Frances Bourn, Independence, Va -
