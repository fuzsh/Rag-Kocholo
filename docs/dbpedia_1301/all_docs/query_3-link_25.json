        "text": "Board-certified spinal surgeon, Dr. Mary Neal, author of To Heaven and Back, and 7 Lessons from Heaven, is both a scientist and a woman of deep faith and trust in God. The New York Times Bestselling author shares her story of drowning while kayaking on a South American river, and how, during her time under the water, she experienced life after death. She went to heaven, conversed with Jesus, and experienced God’s all-encompassing love. She gained an understanding of God’s presence and of “good” and “bad.” She was returned to Earth with information and expectations regarding some of her undone work, including the sharing of her experience with others and the future death of her young son.\n\nHer experiences transformed her faith into a complete trust that the promises of God are true, underpinning her ability to face challenges and loss with a joyful heart. Her story inspires others to make a similar transformation by seeking God’s presence in their own lives.\n\nShe’s been interviewed on many national talk and television shows and has spoken to audiences throughout the United States, Latin America, and Europe, where her story gives reason to live by faith and trust. It is a story of hope.\n\nDr. Neal was born and raised in Michigan and graduated from the University of Kentucky before attending UCLA medical school. She completed her orthopaedic surgery training at the University of Southern California after which she lived in Sweden, Switzerland, and Los Angeles, while undergoing 1 1/2 years of specialty training in spinal surgery before becoming the director of spine surgery at USC. Five years later, she left the University for private practice.\n\nShe currently lives and works in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where she and her family enjoy everything the outdoor world offers, especially all forms of skiing, bicycling, boating, and hiking.\n\nDrMaryNeal.com"
