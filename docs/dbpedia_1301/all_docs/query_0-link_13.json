        "text": "George O'Neal was born on 16 April 1755 six miles from Winchester, Frederick County, Virginia; If Hugh, George's father, died in 1751, then George must have been born earlier. In fact, I know of no source for this date. There may be other reasons for thinking George was born earlier than 1754. His pension application states that he was 77 on 20 Aug 1832, which would place his birth date somewhere between 21 Aug 1754 and 20 Aug 1755, inclusive. [JO'N]. He was the son of Hugh O'Neall and Anne Cox. George O'Neal changed the spelling of his name to George Neal, although he seems to have reinstated the initial \"O'\" late in life. He was a Baptist. He enlisted in the Colonial Army in 1775 at Pittsburgh, Virginia (now in Pennsylvania). He served in the 12th Regiment of the Virginia line under Colonel James Wood, Captain John Neville and First Lieutenant Andrew Waggoner. He was engaged in the battle at Brandywine in September 1777. He was discharged in April 1778 at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. He was in Captain James Lyle's campaign against the Indians in the fall of 1778 at Tuscarawas County, Ohio. He was in General Clark's campaign against the Indians under Captain Charles Polk in August 1780 at Chilacotha and Pickaway, Ohio. He was in General Clark's campaign against the Indians under Captain John Vantree [or Vantrice] in April 1782 at Chilacotha and New Pickaway. After the war, George O'Neal moved after the War to Jessamine County, Kentucky. He married Elizabeth Singleton, daughter of Manoah Singleton and Sarah Craig, on 15 February 1785 at Bryan Station or Harrods Station, Harrodsburg, Kentucky. George O'Neal applied for a pension under the Act of Congress of 7 June 1832 on 20 August 1832. He was granted a pension \"at the rate of 80 dollars per annum to commence on the 4th day of March, 1831\" on 3 September 1832. He left a will on 5 August 1836 at Jessamine County. He died on 30 October 1836 at Nicholasville, Jessamine County, Kentucky, at age 81. He was buried at the family cemetery on their original farm land off the Harrodsburg road, near Nealton, Jessamine County, Kentucky. The old O'Neal homestead is currently (Nov 2001) located at 6272 Parks Lane, Nicholasville, Kentucky. The cabin has been removed to another site, where it has been restored and is now rented as a Bed & Breakfast. Elizabeth Singleton was also known as Betsy. She was born 3 January 1767, probably in Virginia. She was the daughter of Manoah Singleton and Sarah Craig. Elizabeth Singleton was a Baptist. She married George O'Neal, son of Hugh O'Neall and Anne Cox, on 15 February 1785 at Bryan Station or Harrods Station, Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Elizabeth Singleton made an application for half of her deceased husband's pension under the Act of Congress of 7 July 1838 on 19 November 1838 at Jessamine County. She was granted a pension of $80 per annum under the Act of 2 February 1848 circa 1848. She died on 3 May 1852 at Jessamine County, Kentucky, at age 85. She was buried at the family cemetery on their original farm land off the Harrodsburg road, near Nealton, Jessamine County, Kentucky. The old O'Neal homestead is currently (Nov 2001) located at 6272 Parks Lane, Nicholasville, Kentucky. The cabin has been removed to another site, where it has been restored and is now rented as a Bed & Breakfast. George O'Neal Jr was born on 15 July 1792 at the family cabin, near Nealton, Jessamine County, Kentucky. He was the son of George O'Neal and Elizabeth Singleton. George O'Neal Jr served during the War of 1812 in 1812. He married his cousin, Lucy Singleton, daughter of Mason Singleton, on 26 June 1817 at Jessamine County. George O'Neal Jr is mentioned in the will of George O'Neal on 5 August 1836 at Jessamine County. George O'Neal Jr married Francisana Barkley after 1840. George O'Neal Jr may have married Tracey (?) after 1818 at Jessamine County, Kentucky, although this seems unlikely, given the lifespan of his second wife and the fact that she died after 1900. George O'Neal Jr died on 18 March 1854 at Jessamine County, at age 61. He was buried on the farm of Jessie O'Neal, south of Nealton.
