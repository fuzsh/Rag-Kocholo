        "text": "Some of you know that I enjoy genealogy. Fewer of you know that I do lineage repair work. Even fewer of you know that I got into DNA based genealogy to find out who my unnamed GG grandmother was on my mother’s side. What started with being hushed by my Great Aunt almost 10 years ago, ended … Continue reading →\n\n“Old English Eōstre continues into modern English as Easter and derives from Proto-Germanic *austrōn, itself a descendant of the Proto-Indo-European root *aus-, meaning ‘to shine’ (modern English east also derives from this root).[3] Writing in the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon monk Bede describes Ēostre as the name of an Old English goddess and behind the … Continue reading →\n\nAbout six months ago, after about a full year of a very deep dive into my family’s genealogy…tracing many of my maternal lines back to America’s early colonies…I began to ponder on why these people left. Why did so many British, Scottish, and Irish peasants leave their homeland…risk their lives…to arrive in an unknown and … Continue reading →\n\nI appreciate how my mother gently reminds me each year of our family’s (well, and many, many other Southern folk’s) tradition of eating black eyed peas, cornbread, and boiled greens on new year’s day. This meal is eaten to bring luck, prosperity, and health! Pork is used in the black eyed peas/hoppin’ john dish and … Continue reading →\n\nMy great grandma Ora (born in the year 1900), of the red clay hills in Mississippi, was an impeccable seamstress and skilled in hand-sewing quilts. As far as I know, she never used a sewing machine or, at least, she never did on her quilts. With her legacy of quilt making in my family’s past, … Continue reading →\n\nFor many years, I have been working on ancestral and lineage-based knots or wounds in my family line — opening up the channels of my ancestral energy to flow more freely. What I have noticed this past year is a heightened awareness of the importance of this in our personal lives and family constellations we … Continue reading →\n\nMy Mississippi grandma and her friendshad superpowers.Not the comic strip kind,but the surreal, Southern, storied kind. What made them fantasticalwas how they stood outagainst the sobering backdropof modernity. My grandma taught herself to play the pianoand could play and sing dozens of hymnals by memoryas if the gospel was flowing right through her.Her hands had … Continue reading →\n\nI stepped into the new year (based on the Julian then Gregorian calendars, that is) by taking a hike. I stepped away from motherhood duties and did just that. A hike. With a girlfriend. We talked. We sat on sandstone and gazed at the horizon. We looked at vultures circling in the sky. We saw … Continue reading →\n\nThis book and I found each other about 6-7 years ago. I was in the throws of running an apothecary in Mississippi, my home state. I was seeing clients…and feeling into the living narratives thoughtfully explained in this book. To say the least, it was affirming. I want to share this book with you. It … Continue reading →\n\nI did get a hand cramp. But, it was worth it. Let me back up a bit. Working with my hands has always been healing. And, recently, I had the chance to learn something new…something I had been wanting to learn…basic cordage making. My first imprint of the process was at a Chumash Cultural Day … Continue reading →"
