There's probably some kind of cut off on MCAT and they send it to everyone above that. I wonder why that school feels the need to advertise. Seems to me like every decent med student has heard of Wash U and knows how good it is. Maybe they just have extra money to throw out....\n\nwillthatsall\n\nUnretired\n\nJoined\n\nJan 27, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n2,011\n\nReaction score\n\n8\n\nJul 28, 2005\n\n#12\n\nI think everyone over score X gets the letter. I'm not sure exactly what X is, but I'm guessing 34-35? I've heard horror stories of people getting the letter, deciding to apply, and getting rejected as soon as the check is cashed. So I wouldn't hesitate to apply, but if you don't think the rest of your application (GPA) is competitive, don't think that the letter means they have a soft place in their heart for you.\n\nLJDHC05\n\nFormer Chicken Slayer\n\nJoined\n\nJun 23, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n891\n\nReaction score\n\n5\n\nJul 28, 2005\n\n#13\n\nYeah, I got one last year and had a 34...one of 18 MSTP REJECTIONSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nUegis\n\n1 Down 3 To Go\n\nJoined\n\nAug 15, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n1,161\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nJul 28, 2005\n\n#14\n\nYea, Wash U is notorious for sending out the mail soliciting people to apply. As a top school, they really don't get nearly as much applications as other top tier schoools. So in order to increase their applicant pool AND lower their acceptance rate, they send out those emails. It has been discussed extensively in the boards last year and in previous years. If you have strong numbers, you should still apply.

Or is there some weird stigma or something associated w/ it?\n\nMy guess would be that their numbers are low simply because most of us assume we can't get in there so we just don't apply. A lot of the top schools have lower applicant numbers if you look through the MSAR...and then going along with that, some of the very good schools, but not necessarily top of the top have higher numbers because people view them as realistic reach schools...like georgetown getting about 8000 applicants.\n\nAnd, to respond to the post about the Dear AMCAS Applicant letter...I actually got that letter AND the MCAT letter from WashU, so clearly one hand doesn't know what the other is doing over there. But being in advertising myself, I gotta hand it to them...the marketing they're doing is effective....the form letter about the MCAT sure made me feel special even if only for the tenth of a second beore i realized it was just a marketing tool\n\njc11011\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined\n\nJun 24, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n112\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nJul 29, 2005\n\n#20\n\nStartingLine3 said:\n\nI got one of these, but it was more URM based.

It's up against the top 10 schools - think of your parents reaction to \"I got into WUSTL\" versus \"I got into Yale\" despite the fact that WUSTL is probably stronger. \"Washington State is a very good school, dear.\"\n\nDrBowtie\n\nFinal Countdown\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 24, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n15,463\n\nReaction score\n\n1,908\n\nJul 29, 2005\n\n#24\n\nPeople outside of academia generally have little clue that it is such a top notch school.\n\nkalenakai\n\nFull Member\n\nJoined\n\nJul 18, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n480\n\nReaction score\n\n1\n\nJul 29, 2005\n\n#25\n\nStartingLine3 said:\n\nI got one of these, but it was more URM based.

The letter was also somewhat personal and inviting, and it was signed from the Assoc Dean of the Office of Diversity Programs (I too checked off the Med-MAR and am applying as a URM). Still debating whether or not to add WashU to my list of schools, hmmm... I don't know if I meet their high standards. Then again, I don't think I meet Harvard's either, but I added them to the list... at least I'll get to frame their rejection letter, haha! I'm kidding. They have a very strong Diversity Program at HMS as well, so we'll what happens.\n\nbrowniegirl86\n\nFull Member\n\nJoined\n\nOct 13, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n790\n\nReaction score\n\n2\n\nJul 30, 2005\n\n#26\n\nhumuhumu said:\n\nJust got this in the mail today:\n\n\"Dear Mr. *****,\n\nCongratulations on your strong showing on the April 2005 MCAT.
