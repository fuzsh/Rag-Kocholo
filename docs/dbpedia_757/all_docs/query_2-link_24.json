        "text": "Introduction\n\nAn education at GW Law truly positions students to change the world. From day one, they participate in law not just as it exists in textbooks, but as it operates in the real world, and not just anywhere, but in the most vibrant city for law and policy on earth. GW Law is a premier center of legal scholarship, producing leaders in government, business, the judiciary, and in private legal spheres. Its faculty of experts with extensive real-world experience is committed to teaching, and its staff is dedicated to serving the needs of all students.\n\nEstablished in 1865, the George Washington University Law School is the oldest law school in the District of Columbia and has produced some of the finest minds across the spectrum of legal scholarship. That tradition continues today, as GW Law graduates use the knowledge and skills they gain here to influence the critical legal conversations of our times.\n\nWith a history of more than 150 years in the heart of Washington, DC, life at GW Law is inextricably linked to the life of its surrounding community. Law students have unmatched opportunities to learn from expert faculty and distinguished visitors and to pursue internships, clerkships, and employment, all while enjoying the city’s vibrant cultural, nightlife, and dining scenes.\n\nPhysical Facilities\n\nGW Law’s nine-building complex creates an open, comfortable, collaborative atmosphere and features state-of-the art technologies. The Law School is home to the world-renowned Jacob Burns Law Library, and its students enjoy the resources of a large urban university. The Law School is located across the street from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and four blocks from the White House. The State Department, The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and numerous other governmental and arts organizations are in the immediate vicinity.\n\nLLM Programs/Areas of Specialization\n\nGeorge Washington University LLM candidates may follow a program of general study, which may be individually adapted, or they may concentrate in one of the specialized fields listed below. Graduates who complete their work in one of these specialized areas may have the field of specialization noted on their diplomas.\n\nBusiness and Finance Law\n\nEnergy and Environmental Law\n\nEnvironmental Law\n\nGovernment Procurement Law\n\nGovernment Procurement and Environmental Law\n\nIntellectual Property Law\n\nInternational and Comparative Law\n\nInternational Environmental Law\n\nLitigation and Dispute Resolution\n\nNational Security and US Foreign Relations Law\n\nFor additional information about The George Washington University Law School’s LLM program, please visit the GW Law website, or email igpo@law.gwu.edu.\n\nHousing\n\nThe Columbia Plaza Housing Program provides assistance to GW Law students in securing an apartment (by serving as a reference and guarantor) in a privately owned, multi-building complex at 2400 Virginia Avenue, NW, adjacent to the GW campus. The complex offers spacious unfurnished apartments, with utilities included in the rent.\n\nThe University’s Off-Campus Housing Office posts a variety of housing options for students, including efficiencies, apartments, and group houses. Prices for housing vary considerably and generally match those in other major metropolitan areas. Some students choose to live in the immediate vicinity in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood, while others live in other parts of the city or in nearby suburbs and take advantage of the excellent public transportation system in the metropolitan area, which includes a Metro stop on campus.\n\nStudent Services\n\nStudent Health Service\n\nThe Student Health Service is an outpatient clinic staffed by physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Students can be evaluated and treated for most medical problems. Psychiatrists are on staff to provide evaluation and referrals as well as crisis intervention. Visits should be arranged by appointment at the Student Health Services website; urgent problems may be seen on a walk-in basis if necessary. Additional charges for visits, lab work, and medication may apply. Health education and outreach programs on a variety of topics are provided throughout the year.\n\nFor serious emergencies occurring during hours when the Student Health Service is closed, students may go to the Emergency Room of the University Hospital for treatment. This arrangement is for emergency care only and all fees are the responsibility of the student, and students are urged to bring their insurance information with them.\n\nStudents must be currently enrolled on campus in the University to receive treatment at the Student Health Service. Students enrolled in off-campus programs and the Continuing Legal Education Program are not eligible. Students who so desire may engage physicians and nurses of their own choice, but these students will be responsible for all fees charged. The bills incurred from all services rendered outside the Student Health Service (for example, x-ray work, laboratory work, and referrals to specialists or other outside physicians) are the responsibility of the student.\n\nHealth and Accident Insurance\n\nThe University recommends that all students be covered by health and accident insurance. For information on group health insurance options offered through the University, see the Student Health Services website.\n\nDisability Support Services\n\nDisability Support Services (DSS) provides and coordinates support services for students with a wide variety of disabilities, as well as those temporarily disabled by injury or illness. Accommodations are available through DSS to facilitate academic access for students with disabilities. Services provided without charge to the student may include orientation to campus, registration assistance, readers, interpreters, scribes, learning-disabilities advising, adaptive materials and equipment, assistance with note taking, laboratory assistance, test accommodations, regular advising, and referrals. DSS does not provide content tutoring, although it is available on a fee basis from other campus resources. The University does not provide or pay for transportation services or personal attendant care. Additional information is available at the Disability Support Services website.\n\nCounseling Services\n\nThe University Counseling Center offers a broad range of services to help students with personal issues. Services include short-term individual therapy, group therapy, crisis services, academic skill enhancement, and psycho-educational workshops. All counseling services are confidential and are not part of the student’s academic record. The Center also provides telephone assessment and consultations, and referral assistance. The initial assessment is free. Center counselors are available during business hours to answer student questions about services and campus resources, and for faculty to consult about students of concern or other issues. Counselors are available after hours for urgent consultations. The Center can be reached at 202.994.5300. Additional information is available at the University Counseling Center website.\n\nStudent Organizations\n\nSkills Boards\n\nLawyering skills competitions and programs provide realistic training in client counseling, negotiation, arbitration, trial advocacy, and appellate advocacy. The Law School’s student-managed Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Board, Mock Trial Board, and Moot Court Board are dedicated to the promotion and development of these skills among the student body. The ADR Board administers client counseling, negotiation, and international arbitration competitions at the Law School and sends student teams to interscholastic competitions abroad, including annual competitions in Frankfurt and Hong Kong or Vienna. The Mock Trial Board sponsors civil and criminal intrascholastic trial competitions and sends student teams to interscholastic trial competitions nationwide. The Moot Court Board administers intrascholastic, appellate-level competitions in the fields of constitutional law, international law, government contracts law, and intellectual property law. The Moot Court Board also selects and sponsors students to represent the school at interscholastic competitions around the world and sponsors interscholastic competitions, such as the Harold H. Greene and Joyce Hens Green National Security Law Moot Court, the Philip C. Jessup Mid-Atlantic International Law Super-Regional, and the National Veterans Law Moot Court. In addition, faculty and students at the Law School sponsor interscholastic moot court competitions in the areas of government contracts and religious freedom.\n\nLaw Student Organizations\n\nActive Minds\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union\n\nAmerican Constitution Society\n\nAnarchist Collective\n\nArab Student Law Association\n\nArt and Cultural Heritage Law Society\n\nAsian–Pacific American Law Students Association\n\nBanking Law Society\n\nBlack Law Students Association\n\nChristian Law Society\n\nCorporate and Business Law Society\n\nCriminal Law Society\n\nCyberlaw Student Association\n\nEast Asian Law Society\n\nElection Law Association\n\nEntertainment and Sports Law Association\n\nEnvironmental Law Association\n\nEqual Justice Foundation\n\nEvening Law Students Association\n\nFederalist Society\n\nFeminist Forum\n\nGW Law Association for Women\n\nGW Law Democrats\n\nGW Law Review\n\nGW Law Softball Club\n\nGW Law Student Hurricane Network\n\nHispanic Law Students Association\n\nHuman Rights Law Society\n\nImmigration Law Association\n\nInternational Law Society\n\nItalian–American Law Student Association\n\nJ.
