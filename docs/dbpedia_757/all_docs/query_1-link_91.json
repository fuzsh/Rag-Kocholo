        "text": "I recently wrote here about an American Bar Association survey of law schools that offer AI classes. The survey found that 55% of responding law schools offer such classes. A Reuters news story picked up on that and reported, “More than half of law schools now offer classes on AI.”\n\nThe problem with that Reuters story, as I noted in my blog post, was that only 29 out of 200 law schools responded to the ABA survey. So when the survey said that 55% offered AI classes, that meant just 16 law schools, or just 8% of all law schools.\n\nIn the wake of all that, April Dawson, associate dean of technology and innovation and professor of law at North Carol​ina Central University School of Law​, alerted me to an alternative source of information on law schools that offer AI classes. That source is a list she maintains, together with Daniel W. Linna Jr., senior lecturer and director of law and technology initiatives at Northwestern Law School, of courses related to AI and the law.\n\nTheir list, which is self-reported by the professors who teach the courses, provides descriptions of more than 100 such courses — although not all are at law schools or in the U.S. It also lists 136 professors who are currently teaching AI and law-related courses.\n\nI have gone through that list and found that it contains 62 U.S. law schools with courses related to AI. (That number excludes non-U.S. and non-law schools that are on the list.)\n\nIf we assume that number of 62 is correct, that would mean that 31% of U.S. law schools currently offer courses on AI.\n\nHowever, I know that even this list is incomplete, for the simple reason that I know of other courses on AI and the law that are not listed here. For example, I know that Fastcase founder Ed Walters teaches two such courses at Georgetown Law School and another at Cornell Law School/Cornell Tech. Most likely, there are other courses that are not included on the law profs list. (Anyone teaching such a course can request to join the list.)\n\nOf the schools on the law profs list, several offer multiple courses related to AI. The total number of courses related to AI at U.S. law schools is 99, according to the list.\n\nThe law school with the most courses is Suffolk University School of Law, with seven courses, followed by North Carolina Central University School of Law and the University of Missouri, Kansas City, School of Law, each with four courses.\n\nAlthough the law profs list is not sorted by school, I went through it and compiled the table below. It shows the schools with AI courses and the number of AI-related courses taught at each.\n\nWorth noting is that the courses listed on the AI professors’ site come at the topic of AI from many directions. Some are focused on practical skills while others tackle legal and policy issues. Some appear to be devoted to AI, while others cover AI only as part of a broader tech survey.\n\nHere is the list of law schools I extracted from the AI profs list:"
