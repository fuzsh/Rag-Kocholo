        "text": "Students\n\nAdministration is very good at telling applicants what they want to hear during the admissions process. Unfortunately, there have been a lot of lies, or at least mistruths. WUSTL has a pretty building, but the job market in St. Louis is awful for a lot of us, and those who aren’t in the top 10-15% are really struggling to find jobs elsewhere because we go to school outside of a traditionally strong legal market.\n\n2L\n\nHas academic quality comparable to T14 schools, just hasn’t made it there yet. However, widely known that the administration’s number one goal is to get the school there. They firmly believe that Wash. U. deserves to be a T14 school.\n\n1L\n\nIt’s extremely important to go to school in a geographic area in which you want to work; unless an applicant wants to work in Saint Louis they should think very carefully about committing to Wash U. Also, this school is incredibly cynical and does not care about anything except increasing the prestige of the school itself, which only tangentially benefits students.\n\n3L\n\nSalary info for the entire graduating class, more cutoffs in that data than just 25/50/75% (maybe a breakdown by 10% or 20% instead of 25%)\n\n2L\n\nThat if you want to attend a top notch school that focuses on real life training, Washington University is the place for you.\n\n2L\n\nThe events put on by the CSO, while helpful, become extremely repetitive. It has been my observation, though, that he unfortunate reality of the situation is that they probably need to be doing this more so than anyone realizes. I have been to biglaw networking events in St. Louis where 1Ls (which is all I can really speak to) show up unshaven or sloppily dressed (for the men) or in too revealing or too casual clothes (for the women).\n\n1L\n\nWashington University school of law does not have a “market”. Don’t expect to get a job if your in the top 15% – even if you hustle.\n\n3L"
