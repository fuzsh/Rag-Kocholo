        "text": "Overview 2-3\n\nSince enrolling its first class in 1865, The George Washington University Law School has produced some of the finest minds across the spectrum of legal scholarship.\n\nThat tradition continues today, as GW Law graduates use the knowledge and skills they gain here to influence the critical legal conversations of our times. The school is accredited by the American Bar Association and is a charter member of the Association of American Law Schools. The law school is located on the GW campus in the downtown neighborhood familiarly known as Foggy Bottom.\n\nHis goal was to educate future generations of civil servants and thereby forge a national identity based on \"principles friendly to republican government and to the true and genuine liberties of mankind.\" He left in his will 50 shares of stock in the Potowmack Canal Company for the endowment of a university \"to which the youth of fortune and talents from all parts thereof might be sent for the completion of their Education in all the branches of polite literature-in arts and Sciences-in acquiring knowledge in the principles of Politics & good Government.\"\n\nStudent-Faculty Ratio 4\n\n15.5:1\n\nAdmission Criteria 5\n\nLSAT GPA 25th-75th Percentile 159-166 3.35-3.80 Median 165 3.70\n\nThe above LSAT and GPA data pertain to the 2016 entering class.\n\nDirector of admissions Sophia Sim Application deadline March 1\n\nLaw School Admissions details based on 2016 data.\n\nAdmission Statistics 6\n\nApproximate number of applications 6943 Number accepted 2702 Percentage accepted 38.9%\n\nThe above admission details are based on 2016 data.\n\nLaw School Cost 7\n\nFull-Time JD Part-Time JD Books and Supplies $1,740 $1,300 Personal $3,200 $3,200 Room and Board $20,200 $20,200 Transportation $2,240 $2,240 Tuition and Fees $58,520 $43,260* Total $85,900 $70,200\n\n*Part-time JD students currently pay tuition at the 2017-2018 per-credit hour rate of $2,060.\n\nClass Ranking and Grades 8-9\n\nGrades\n\nLetter grades are given with numerical equivalents as follows:\n\nA+ 4.33 A 4.0 A- 3.66 B+ 3.33 B 3.0 B- 2.66 C+ 2.33 C 2.0 C- 1.66 D 1.0 F 0\n\nCredit toward the J.D. degree is given for all grades between D and A+ (inclusive). A J.D. candidate who receives a grade of F or No Credit (NC) in a required course must retake that course from the same or a different instructor. Any student who retakes a required course and receives a grade of F or NC will be excluded from further study and may not graduate unless the student petitions for and receives the permission of the Academic Scholarship Committee. A J.D. candidate who receives a grade of F or NC in a non-required course may retake the course once, from the same or a different instructor. All failing and NC grades remain on the record. The cumulative average of a student includes all grades earned in courses evaluated on a letter-grade basis and taken at the Law School while a candidate for the degree.\n\nThe majority of courses are graded on a letter-grade basis, but for some courses (primarily those that are clinical or skills-oriented), the grade of Credit (CR) or No Credit (NC) is given or the following grading scale is used: Honors (H), Pass (P), Low Pass (LP), and No Credit (NC). For Honors, a student must do work of excellent quality, and no more than 25 percent of the class may earn this grade. For courses graded on a Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) or Honors, Pass, Low Pass, or No Credit (H/P/LP/NC) basis, NC is given for work that would receive a grade below C- were evaluation to be made using the letter grade scale.\n\nA student who has been excused from taking a regularly scheduled examination or has been granted an extension of the deadline for a research paper is given the grade of I, Incomplete. (See Failure to Take an Examination, and Deadlines for Courses Graded on the Basis of Methods of Evaluation Other than In-Class Examinations, below.)\n\nIn the event of any inconsistency between statements by a course instructor or in an individual course syllabus, the deadlines, rules, and statements set forth in this Bulletin will govern.\n\nNo grade may be changed by an instructor after it has been posted or disclosed to a student unless there has been an arithmetic or administrative error that has been certified in writing as such by the instructor. A student has the right of faculty peer review of complaints of “prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation” under the regulations outlined in The George Washington University Guide to Students’ Rights and Responsibilities. To initiate such a review, the student must submit a letter and supporting documentation to the dean of students office by the last day of classes of the semester following the semester or summer session in which the grade for an examination, paper, or other work product was awarded. The student has the burden of making a prima facie case, with appropriate documentation, that the grade was prejudiced or capricious. Mere disagreement with the grade is not a sufficient basis for initiating a faculty peer review.\n\nThe Grade-Point Average\n\nAcademic achievement is computed in terms of the grade-point average, obtained by dividing the number of quality points by the number of credit hours for which the student has registered, both based on his or her record in this University.\n\nThe grade-point average is computed as follows: A+, 4.33; A, 4.0; A-, 3.66; B+, 3.33; B, 3.0; B-, 2.66; C+, 2.33; C, 2.0; C-, 1.66; D+, 1.3; D, 1.0; D-, .7; F, 0, for each credit hour for which the student has registered as a degree-seeking student. Although credit value for a course in which a grade of F is earned appears on the transcript for the purpose of calculating the grade-point average, no academic credit is awarded. In the case of a student who is allowed to repeat a course, the first grade received remains on the student’s record and is included in the grade-point average. Courses marked AU, CR, I, IPG, P, NP, R, W, or Z are not considered in determining the average, except courses marked with an I, which will be considered when a final grade is recorded. With the exception of Consortium courses, grades in courses taken at other institutions are not considered in computing the grade-point average.\n\nAcademic Recognition\n\nStudents of The George Washington University Law School are not supplied with individual class rankings. However, in lieu of specific rankings, students’ relative academic accomplishments are represented through two scholar designations.\n\nStudents in the top 1% to 15% of the class (based on cumulative GPA at the end of each semester) are designated “George Washington Scholars,” and students in the top 16% to 35% of the class (based on cumulative GPA at the end of each semester) are designated “Thurgood Marshall Scholars.”\n\nGrade Representation Policy\n\nThere is no requirement that grades be included on student resumes. Students who wish to represent grades on their resumes, however, must do so in one or more of the following ways. These three formats are the only acceptable means of grade representation on a resume.\n\nThe distinction of “George Washington Scholar” is bestowed upon those students whose cumulative grade-point average at the end of any semester places them among the top 1% to 15% of their class. The distinction of “Thurgood Marshall Scholar” is bestowed upon those students, excluding those designated George Washington Scholars, whose cumulative grade-point average at the end of the semester places them among the top 16% to 35% of their class;\n\nGrade Normalization (Curve)10\n\nMINIMUM GRADE REQUIRED TO ATTAIN (Based on May 2015 graduating class) Top 10% 714 Top 25% 3.582 Top 33% 3.486 Top 50% 3.357 Top 75% 3.163 Median GPA 3.362 Minimum grade required for graduation 1.667\n\nHonors 11\n\nHonor Criteria Order of the Coif The Order of the Coif, a national legal honor society, aims “to foster a spirit of careful study and to mark in a fitting manner those who have attained a high grade of scholarship.” The George Washington University chapter was established in 1926. Members are elected each year from the highest-ranking 10 percent of the graduating Juris Doctor candidates. Highest Honors The degree of Juris Doctor “With Highest Honors” is awarded to those students, not exceeding three percent of the graduating class, who have obtained the highest cumulative averages of at least 3.67. High Honors The degree of Juris Doctor “With High Honors” is awarded to those students with the highest cumulative averages of 3.33 or better. The number of students receiving degrees “With High Honors,” when added to the total number of students receiving degrees “With Highest Honors,” may not exceed 10 percent of the graduating class. Honors The degree of Juris Doctor “With Honors” is awarded to those students with the highest cumulative averages of 3.0 or better. The number of students receiving degrees “With Honors,” when added to the total number of students receiving degrees “With High Honors” and “With Highest Honors,” may not exceed 40 percent of the graduating class.\n\nAwards 12\n\nNAME OF AWARD BASIS OF AWARD Finnegan Prize in IP Best publishable article in IP Law George Washington Scholar Top 1% to 15% of class each semester Thurgood Marshall Scholar Top 16% to 35% of class each semester American Bankruptcy Institute Award Excellence in debtor/creditor law ABA Bureau of Nat'l Affairs Awards Excellence in various areas of the law Henry R.
