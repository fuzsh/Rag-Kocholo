        "text": "Scholars workshop their works in progress before a group of experienced peer reviewers and commentators. Each author’s work in progress accepted for the Health Law Scholars Workshop will be read in advance by several faculty members in relevant fields. During the workshop weekend, each author presents their paper to the entire group. After extensive oral feedback from the readers, the floor is opened for a sustained exchange between the presenter and the full group.\n\nThe workshop draws health law and bioethics scholars from across the country, inviting senior faculty from a variety of law schools and disciplines to review the works in progress and participate in the weekend. The workshop also draws on the expertise of faculty from the Saint Louis University Center for Health Law Studies, School of Medicine, College for Public Health and Social Justice, Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing, and Center for Health Care Ethics.\n\nA nominating committee selects the papers to be presented at the workshop. The committee looks for papers with an original thesis that will contribute to the scholarly literature. The workshop is designed primarily to provide feedback on articles intended for spring submission to law review journals. The workshop is not intended to review published work or papers already accepted for publication.\n\nThe workshop is designed for those new to law journal scholarship as they navigate the challenges of the promotion and tenure process. While the workshop welcomes abstracts from fellows, visiting professors and post-docs, the nominating committee gives priority to authors in tenure-track and long-term contract positions at the pre-tenure and pre-full professor levels. An important goal of this workshop is to connect those new to academia with mid-level and senior scholars who can provide valuable mentoring. We also seek to promote an inclusive and equitable environment in the workshop and within the academy.\n\nThose interested in presenting a health law or bioethics work-in-progress at the Health Law Scholars Workshop should submit a 500-word abstract and a CV to Abigail Allred, abigail.allred@slu.edu, at Saint Louis University School of Law by Monday, April 15, 2024. Because a blind selection process is used, please do not include the author’s name, institutional affiliation or other identifying information in the abstract.\n\nThe CV is used to share anonymized information about the author’s degrees, academic appointments and prior publications with the selection committee. We seek to welcome a diverse group of junior scholars into the health law community and encourage you to apply. If you have a diversity statement and would like to include it with your CV, please do.\n\nPlease send questions about the submission process to Professor Sidney D. Watson at sidney.watson@slu.edu or 314-807-4792 (mobile).\n\nSubmit abstracts and CVs by e-mail to:\n\nAbigail Allred\n\nProgram Coordinator\n\nCenter for Health Law Studies\n\nabigail.allred@slu.edu\n\nDeadline: Monday, April 15, 2024\n\nIf you do not receive an email confirmation within two business days, please let us know.\n\nThe Nominating Committee selects the papers to be presented at Health Law Scholars Workshop based on the strength and promise of a 500-word abstract.\n\nThe nominating committee looks for abstracts that promise a paper with an original thesis that will contribute to the scholarly literature. These elements strengthen an abstract:\n\nTitle\n\nClear thesis statement\n\nOverview of the arguments in support of the thesis\n\nA policy and law recommendation, solution, or legal theory component to the paper.\n\nThe original contribution the paper makes to the literature.\n\nRemember, the selection process is blinded, and the Nominating Committee does want to be able to identify the authors. Do not disclose yourself in your abstract with information like, “This piece follows my first article, Law of the Horse.”\n\nHealth Law Scholars Workshop is not intended to review published work or papers already accepted for publication. Please do not submit an abstract for a paper that has already been submitted for publication or that will be submitted for publication in the summer law review cycle before the workshop.\n\nHealth Law Scholars is designed to help junior faculty navigate the challenges of the promotion and tenure process, primarily in the law school setting. Thus, the Nominating Committee looks for abstracts that promise a substantial, solo-authored law journal article, which most law schools require as part of the tenure and promotion process.\n\nWe have and do select Health Law Scholars with appointments in other schools, like public health, medicine, and business. Still, our expertise is the solo-authored law journal article format. If that kind of article will help you in your promotion and tenure process, we welcome your abstract.\n\nThe workshop is not for student authors, those yet to enter academia, or faculty who have already reached full professor status.\n\nWe confirm receipt of the abstract within two business days. Please let us know if you do not receive timely confirmation. We will also confirm that the article will not be submitted for publication before the workshop weekend."
