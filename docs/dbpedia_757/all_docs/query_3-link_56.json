        "text": "Georgetown University\n\n1 of 1\n\nAn Education for the Mind & Heart\n\nIntellectual rigor. Social justice. Self-reflection. They’re knitted together in every facet of your Georgetown experience – in your studies, your research, your interactions with faculty and the career decisions you make.\n\nDC: The World at Your Doorstep\n\nWashington is the epicenter of global politics. It’s also your hotspot for art, activism, entrepreneurship and public service. Think of the city as an extension of campus. Whether you intern on Capitol Hill, conduct research for an NGO or take time out at an embassy party, it’s your DC.\n\n1 of 4\n\nA Sense of Belonging\n\nThe Hilltop: It’s a community that’s bursting with energy and ideas. You feel it in residences built around shared passions and in graduate co-living spaces. You see it in the way we own our many differences. At Georgetown, you belong.\n\nAll News\n\nSynchronized swimming was first performed in flooded Roman amphitheaters, but it wasn’t until 1984 that it became an official Olympic sport. Dive into its history and the Olympics this year.\n\nGeorgetown students journeyed to Cat Island, a small island in the Caribbean, to find out how enslaved people and their descendants remained resilient through their food and cultural traditions.\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nThis event is entirely virtual.\n\n12:00pm – 1:00pm\n\nGeorgetown University School of Continuing Studies 640 Massachusetts Avenue Northwest Washington, DC 20001\n\n12:00pm – 1:30pm\n\nRegent’s Hall – Fourth Floor Patio\n\n4:00pm – 6:00pm\n\n@GeorgetownUniversity"
