        "text": "Washington residents pay less for college\n\nStudents who are Washington residents:\n\nPay resident (in-state) tuition and fees at all public colleges and universities.\n\nAre eligible for state financial aid at participating institutions.\n\nBoth U.S. citizens and non-citizens can be Washington residents, including undocumented students. In most cases, a Washington resident is someone who lives in the state for one year immediately prior to starting their college or program.\n\nBut there are other ways to be a resident. The state has rules for how certain groups of people—such as tribal members or military veterans, service members, and families—can get residency.\n\nInformation for students and families\n\nFind out how being a Washington resident student makes college more affordable.\n\nTuition\n\nTuition\n\nWashington resident students pay resident tuition and fees at public colleges and universities. Resident tuition is less expensive than out-of-state rates.\n\nState financial aid\n\nState financial aid\n\nThe Washington College Grant, College Bound Scholarship, and other state financial aid programs are only for Washington resident students. Each state aid program has different program requirements. It is possible to get resident tuition at public institutions but not get state financial aid. Students should apply for financial aid to find out if they qualify.\n\nRequirements\n\nRequirements\n\nThere are several ways to be a Washington resident student. Students’ residency options depend on their citizenship or immigration status. See the sections below for more information.\n\nHow to apply for residency\n\nHow to apply for residency\n\nIn most cases, students don't need to apply for residency. This is because colleges and universities determine residency based on a student’s college and financial aid applications. The only students who should apply for residency are those who are told they are a nonresident but think they are a resident. These students should contact their college or university to find out how to apply for residency. The residency process depends on the student’s individual situation and whether they are attending a public or private institution. Some students may also be asked for documentation such as identification, student/parent tax returns, pay stubs, and rental agreements.\n\nPublic institutions\n\nAt public colleges and universities, a student’s acceptance letter will say if the student is admitted as a resident or nonresident. Students who are admitted as nonresidents, but think they meet student residency requirements, should contact their school’s residency officer.\n\nPrivate institutions that participate in state financial aid programs\n\nAt private colleges and universities, students who apply for financial aid will be told if they qualify for state financial aid programs. Students who do not get state financial aid due to residency, but think they meet student residency requirements, should contact their school’s financial aid office.\n\nResidency questions\n\nResidency questions\n\nAnswers to student residency questions often depend on the student’s college or university. Because of this, students should contact their school if they have residency questions after reviewing this webpage. Public and private institutions have different residency contacts.\n\nPublic institutions\n\nStudents with residency questions should contact the school’s residency officer. Residency officers are usually located in the registrar’s or admissions office.\n\nPrivate institutions that participate in state financial aid programs\n\nStudents with residency questions should contact their school’s financial aid office.\n\nRequirements for students with any citizenship or immigration status\n\nThis option is open to all Washingtonians, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. It is the only option available to undocumented people who have never had DACA or to people who are pending asylum without an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). Students who qualify:\n\nPay resident tuition and fees at all public colleges and universities, and\n\nMeet residency requirements for all state financial aid programs, including Washington College Grant. Students must also meet program requirements.\n\nRequirements\n\nRequirements\n\nTo qualify, students must meet all of the following requirements:\n\nEarn a high school diploma, GED, or diploma equivalent before their first term at the college determining residency.\n\nMaintain a primary residence in Washington for at least 12 consecutive months immediately before their first term at the college determining residency.\n\nThe Washington residence must be for purposes other than college. If a student takes any courses at another Washington college during the prior 12 months, they cannot have taken more than six credits in any given term. Students exceeding that limit must prove that they have a Washington residence for non-college reasons.\n\nSign an affidavit saying they meet the above requirements and that one of the following is true:\n\nThey will file an application to become a permanent resident of the United States (green card) as soon as they are eligible to apply. And that they are willing to engage in activities designed to prepare them for citizenship, including citizenship or civics review courses or\n\nThey are a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. permanent resident.\n\nThe first two requirements can be done at the same time or at different times, as long as they are both completed before starting at the college determining residency.\n\nHow to meet requirements\n\nHow to meet requirements\n\nHigh school diploma, GED, or diploma equivalent requirement\n\nAny U.S. high school diploma, GED, or diploma equivalent meets the requirements of this law, regardless of where it was earned or whether it was earned before the student lived in Washington.\n\nHigh school diplomas earned outside of the U.S.\n\nStudents with a high school diploma earned outside of the U.S. should contact their school’s residency officer (public colleges and universities) or financial aid office (private colleges and universities) to see if their diploma is equivalent to a U.S. high school diploma. WSAC has encouraged colleges to use the U.S. Department of Education's guidance when making a determination.\n\nPeople without a high school diploma or GED\n\nPeople without a high school diploma or GED must have an equivalent of a high school diploma. Students who are unsure if they have a diploma equivalent should contact their school’s residency officer (public colleges and universities) or financial aid office (private colleges and universities). WSAC has encouraged colleges to use the U.S. Department of Education's guidance when making a determination.\n\nMaintaining a primary Washington residence for 12 consecutive months\n\nStarting June 9, 2022, the 12 months of residency must be for purposes other than college\n\nStudents who live in Washington for 12 consecutive months before their first term at the college determining residency meet this requirement.\n\nStarting June 9, 2022, students must be in Washington mainly for non-college purposes. This means that students who take college credits during those 12 months must meet one of the following:\n\nThey can only take six or fewer college credits (not including Running Start or College in the High School classes) each term at another Washington college during the 12 months, or\n\nIf they do take more than six credits in any term during the 12 months, they must prove they lived in Washington for the 12 months primarily for purposes other than college. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\nStudents who earned a high school diploma in Washington and continued living in Washington before their first term at the college determining residency.\n\nStudents who moved to Washington due to a job for themselves or a family member.\n\nStudents who moved to Washington to take care of a family member.\n\nStudents who spend temporary periods of time outside of Washington during the 12 months also meet this requirement, as long as they maintain their primary Washington address.\n\nStudents who are not sure if they meet this requirement should contact their school’s residency officer (public colleges and universities) or financial aid office (private colleges and universities).\n\nParent/legal guardian residency\n\nThis law only depends on where the student lives. It does not require that a student’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) live in Washington.\n\nAffidavit\n\nAffidavit\n\nThe affidavit is a signed promise between the student and the institution determining residency. Students who sign the affidavit are promising the institution that they meet the requirements for this student residency option. Students do not need to disclose their legal status to sign the affidavit. They can sign even if there is no pathway to a green card under their current immigration status.\n\nHow to submit the affidavit\n\nThere are two ways to submit the affidavit. Students should only choose one based on the financial aid application they use:\n\nOption 1: Individuals who applied/will apply for state financial aid using the Washington Application for State Financial Aid (WASFA): WASFA-filers submitted/will submit the affidavit as part of the WASFA. The WASFA is for undocumented students, students who are not eligible for federal aid, and students who do not want to apply for federal aid. Students who are unsure if the WASFA is for them can fill out the WASFA questionnaire.\n\nOption 2: Individuals who applied/will apply for federal and state financial aid using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or who are not applying for aid. FAFSA-filers or people not applying for aid will submit a form to their school.\n\nIf a student signs the affidavit, schools should not ask for the following:\n\nProof of a high school diploma, GED, or equivalent (unless the student’s other paperwork shows the student does not have a diploma or equivalent)\n\nProof of maintaining a primary residence in Washington for 12 consecutive months for purposes other than college (unless the student’s other paperwork shows otherwise).\n\nProof that the student has applied for permanent residency (green card) or engaged in activities designed to prepare them for citizenship.\n\nStudents who have questions about how signing the affidavit may affect their immigration status should consult an immigration attorney.\n\nDigital and print resources\n\nDigital and print resources\n\nOne-Page PDF\n\nThis PDF is for undocumented communities and others who may be newly eligible. The PDF is currently available in:\n\nEnglish\n\nChinese\n\nHindi\n\nSpanish\n\nTagalog\n\nPowerPoint Slides\n\nThese slides explain how residency impacts college affordability. They also describe the new residency law. The slides are currently available in:\n\nEnglish\n\nChinese\n\nHindi\n\nSpanish\n\nTagalog\n\nRequirements for students with a qualifying immigration status\n\nThere are two common ways to be a Washington resident for students who are U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, U.S. permanent residents, or who have a qualifying immigration status. Students who meet one of these options:\n\nPay resident tuition and fees at all public colleges and universities, and\n\nMeet residency requirements for all state financial aid programs, including Washington College Grant. Students must also meet program requirements.\n\nRequirements\n\nRequirements\n\nOption 1: Financially independent students\n\nDefinition: Financially independent students are students who meet all of the following for the current and previous calendar years (calendar year means January–December):\n\nThey were not claimed as a dependent exemption on a tax return, regardless of age.\n\nThey did not receive significant financial assistance from parents, relatives, legal guardians, or others (except for a spouse), regardless of age and marital status.\n\nThey used their own income—or financial aid awarded in their name—to pay their living and tuition expenses.\n\nPersonal loans, Parent PLUS loans, gifts, and cash earnings are not income.\n\nOption 1 requirements: Financially independent students must do two things to be a Washington resident:\n\n1. They must have a domicile in Washington for at least one year immediately before the term they apply for residency. “Domicile” is a legal term used to describe a person’s true, fixed, and permanent home. A person can only have one legal domicile in the U.S. at a time. To establish a domicile in Washington, a person must prove physical presence in the state plus intent to permanently remain in the state. There are different ways to show proof of Washington domicile. Typical forms of proof include, but are not limited to:\n\nWashington driver’s license\n\nWashington vehicle registration\n\nWashington voter registration\n\nLease, rental agreement, or mortgage in Washington\n\nW2 or paystubs for Washington employer\n\n2. They must show that the domicile is primarily for purposes other than college. This means that students who take college credits during the previous year must meet one of the following:\n\nThey can only take six or fewer college credits (not including Running Start or College in the High School classes) each term at any Washington college during the previous year (including the college determining residency) or\n\nIf they do take more than six credits in any term during the previous year, they must prove they have a domicile in Washington for purposes other than college. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\nStudents who graduated high school in Washington and continued maintaining a domicile in Washington before attending a Washington college.\n\nStudents who moved to Washington due to a job for themselves or a family member.\n\nStudents who moved to Washington to take care of a family member.\n\nOption 2: Financially dependent students\n\nDefinition: Students who do not meet all of the requirements for financially independent students are dependent students.\n\nOption 2 requirements: For financially dependent students, at least one parent or legal guardian must have a domicile in Washington. They must have the domicile for at least one year immediately before the term the student applies for residency.\n\nSome parents or legal guardians cannot have a Washington domicile because of their visa status. Parents or legal guardians with B, C, D, F, H-1B1, H-2, H-3, J, M, P, TD, TN, WB, or WT visa status cannot have a Washington domicile. But, parents or legal guardians with another immigration status, including those who are undocumented, can typically establish a domicile in Washington.\n\nQualifying immigration statuses\n\nQualifying immigration statuses\n\nThese two options are available to students with the following citizenship or immigration statuses:\n\nCurrent or expired Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status\n\nA current Employment Authorization Document (EAD)\n\nTemporary Protected Status (TPS)\n\nRefugee\n\nAsylee\n\nPending Adjustment of Status (applied for green card)\n\nOne of the following visa statuses: A, DV, E, G, H-1B, H4, I, K, L1, L2, N, NATO, O, Q, R, S, T, U, or V\n\nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status or Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) status\n\nWithholding of Removal status or Withholding of Deportation status\n\nCitizen of the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Palau\n\nViolence Against Women Act (VAWA) status\n\nCanadians who qualify for permanent residence under the Jay Treaty\n\nCuban-Haitian Entrants, Conditional Entrants, and Parolees\n\nUS citizen, US national, or US permanent resident (green card)\n\nOther non-citizens may be in this group.

These students:\n\nPay resident tuition and fees at all public colleges and universities.\n\nMeet residency requirements for Passport to Careers, State Work Study, the American Indian Endowed Scholarship, and the National Guard Postsecondary Education Grant.
