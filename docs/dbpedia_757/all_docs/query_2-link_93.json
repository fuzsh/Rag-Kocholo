        "text": "Credit\n\nThrough our established transfer partnerships, you can seamlessly transfer to a four-year college or university, while our certificate programs can prepare you with the credentials needed to head straight into the workforce.\n\nEarly College\n\nStill in high school? Our Early College program allows students to enroll in college-level courses, reducing both the time and the money needed to earn a college degree.\n\nExplore all of our offerings in the City Colleges of Chicago catalog and our funding opportunities.\n\nAdult Education (ESL, GED)\n\nAdvance your career by learning English or completing your high school education for free. Our English as a Second Language (ESL) and high school equivalency courses welcome students from all backgrounds and are offered at various times throughout the day. Additionally, we offer pathways that can help you transition into college credit or job credential programs.\n\nContinuing Education (Professional Development, Personal Development)\n\nWhether you want to round out your resume or find a new hobby, we offer a variety of affordable learning opportunities for students of all ages. Our personal and professional development courses can improve both your job prospects and your quality of life.\n\nExplore all of our Continuing Education offerings here.\n\nEach City College is a comprehensive community college with a Center of Excellence in a growing field: healthcare, transportation, distribution, and logistics (TDL), business, advanced manufacturing, information technology, engineering and computer science, education, and culinary arts and hospitality. Additionally, all of our colleges offer a wide range of general education courses that you can use to transfer and earn a bachelor’s degree.\n\nCCC students enjoy the option of taking classes at any of our colleges – no new applications or transferring required. You can see descriptions of all our credit programs and classes in our Course Catalog.\n\nCity Colleges is an open-access institution, so we welcome all students, no matter what interests and goals you have. There are separate application processes for students who want to take English or high school equivalency courses, first-year college credit students, and returning college credit students.\n\nFirst-year students need to apply, complete testing, attend new student orientation, and then enroll in courses. ACT/SAT scores are used to determine if you need to take a placement test – not for acceptance.\n\nReturning students with prior college credit need to apply, submit previous college transcripts, and then enroll in courses.\n\nStudents who are interested in taking English as a Second Language or GED/HiSET prep classes should start here.\n\nAt City Colleges, we’re working to make college more affordable for students by offering payment plans and other financial support opportunities. For example, you can pay your tuition in full, set up a monthly payment plan, or use financial aid, grants, and scholarships. Visit www.ccc.edu/payforcollege to learn more."
