        "text": "This optional essay prompt is similar to those that many colleges introduced this year in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling restricting race-conscious admissions practices. (Here’s a running list of colleges that changed their prompts.) These “diversity/community” essays get at the question of what you as an individual with a unique constellation of identities and influences will add to the WashU mix. In brief, schools are interested in bringing together a diverse group of students in order to enhance learning and the institution’s ultimate outputs.\n\nFAQ: Do I have to write this essay? Strictly speaking no, it’s optional. But we recommend writing most optional prompts—they’re another chance to help a college see who you are and how you fit together with the school.\n\nFor a full discussion of this year’s varied crop of diversity essays, see our guide: How to Answer the Diversity (and Other Related Supplemental Essay Prompts). For an abbreviated version, read on:\n\nFirst, build a list of your “identities and experiences.” Think broadly. This can include race, ethnicity, culture, heritage, family, language, religion, national origin, beliefs, and geography. It also encompasses the various communities you’re a part of that may or may not relate to these categories, such as online communities, arts and service organizations, school clubs. Also activities and interests you’re into, and life experiences you’ve had that others haven’t. Explore this “If You Really, Really Knew Me” exercise for ideas.\n\nPerusing your list, consider which of these aspects feel most central to you, and which allow you to stand out from other students. What are the particular contours of your unique fingerprint? These are the elements Wash U is seeking to learn about.\n\nThen decide which prompt option can illuminate that aspect with a concrete example or examples from your life:\n\nChoice #1 focuses on ideas you’ve exchanged while in a collaborative environment.\n\nChoice #2 inquires about your role in a particular community.\n\nChoice #3 examines your identity in the context of community.\n\nWhichever you choose, come back to the prompt: “Wash U… values a diversity of perspectives.” Your task is to demonstrate how your experiences have shaped your perspectives differently than the other people you’ll study with. You can use this mini-outline to shape your essay:\n\nIdentity or community I’m a part of\n\nHow that has shaped my perspective\n\nHow that perspective will shape the way I contribute to the Wash U community.\n\nHere are a few different examples (written for similar prompts from other colleges) with brief analysis, so you can see the range of possibilities here:\n\nExample:\n\nA large aspect of my identity is my low-income family of eight. As one of the eldest siblings, I was expected to financially contribute as soon as I could work. The majority of my summers were spent shelving products, filing papers, and answering customers’ questions. I quickly discovered the difficulty in earning a paycheck and appreciated my parents more. My family has been my rock—ever since we faced homelessness. Homelessness allowed me to understand my family’s financial situation, but most importantly, it resulted in bonding emotionally. At that moment, family was the one thing I knew I could call home.\n\nOver time, the comforting feeling of my family began to disappear. As my parents are devoted missionaries and pastors, I regularly hear their conservative perspectives of Christianity. Throughout my life, I’ve shared similar personal values with my family, denying my bisexuality up until last year. This identity realization impacted me emotionally and physically. I was afraid to come out to anyone, worried that my faith would be questioned and I’d be treated differently. I felt powerless and miserable; mental struggles sometimes limited my motivation. One day, I sought professional help and found solace with my school counselor. After spending endless nights contemplating coming out, I told my close friends. I found acceptance from some and learned who were my real friends, the support system that I’m grateful for. My true identity hasn’t changed. Rather, coming out allowed me to be more open-minded, inclusive, and taught me to value conversations where I can bring a fresh perspective.\n\nAbove all, I’ve learned that my experiences shape me into the multifaceted person I am today. They propel me to openly contribute to my Entry, the Gender and Sexuality Resource Center, and most importantly, the everyday interactions with my Williams peers and faculty members.\n\n— — —\n\nTips + Analysis\n\nThis student writes that coming from a large, low-income family that experienced homelessness meant they bonded with their family and took on financial responsibility early, and also that coming out as bisexual from within a religious family ultimately led them to self-acceptance and open-mindedness. They conclude by sharing how they’ll bring their multifaceted self and openness to a resource center aligned with their identity, as well as the campus community more broadly. With this approach, the student shares a few important core aspects of identity and experience that helps the reader understand what they bring to a campus and community that other applicants might not.\n\nExample:\n\nAt the Student Diversity Leadership Conference in Seattle, I joined a mixed-race affinity group where I articulated how liberating it felt to discuss intersectional issues I hadn’t felt I could share as a mixed woman of color in a predominantly white school. With support from group leaders, I realized that my labels don’t restrict me, but can be an opportunity to foster conversations about aspects of my identity that make me unique.\n\nI manifested my new approach towards dialogue in Actualizing Beloved Community, a group that addresses social justice challenges and facilitates student programs to include diverse perspectives. I found peers who share my ideals, and I learned to appreciate views of those who don’t. These lessons culminated when I interviewed a panel of queer women of color for Women’s History Month on an episode of The Refresh, a series that engages St. Andrew's community in socio-political conversations. Students reflected how listening to these women’s experiences opened their minds beyond our school’s former echochamber.\n\nI hope to facilitate similar programs to include diverse voices through Columbia’s Women of Color Collective and Mixed Heritage Society, in which I and my peers can learn from the experiences of those from different backgrounds.\n\n— — —\n\nTips + Analysis\n\nThis student focuses on the liberating experience of dialoguing with other mixed people of color in a conference affinity group after attending a predominantly white school, and how she went on to create further opportunities for rich conversations centering diverse voices. She sums up with proposals for how she’ll take this work to campus. Through this, she does a nice job illustrating how she has been an active community member and advocate, and how she’ll continue doing so in her college community.\n\nExample:\n\nMy martial arts dojo is where I have primarily contributed to diverse, collaborative communities since third grade. I continued for so many years because I loved the community and the skills I was learning. I especially loved showing younger students my abilities as I moved up in ranks, as well as being a role model for them. I also helped my fellow older students persevere through tough workouts, and sparred with other students to show them how to improve their skills. By doing this, I engaged with people of many different ages, sexes, and skill levels, helping them persevere or improve their competency.\n\nThrough these experiences, I learned how to teach without being overbearing, how to stick with a commitment and never give up, and how to communicate better with students during sparring, as communication is key when fists are being thrown around. Outside of the studio, I used my teaching skills to help the younger kids in my school's mentoring program. By serving many different types of people in my community, I collaborate and guide them both in their martial arts journey and in other aspects of life.\n\n— — —\n\nTips + Analysis\n\nThis essay names a martial arts dojo as a community where the author gained teaching skills, persistence and communication by collaborating with people of different ages, sexes and skill levels. They then translated the skills and perspective gained there to mentoring younger students at their school. Notice that instead of the values we’d typically expect of an essay focusing on martial arts, this author includes some values (diversity, collaboration, communication) that might surprise us a bit, leading to a stronger piece of writing.\n\nExample: (Trigger warning: this essay discusses suicide)\n\nDuring the winter of 2018, one of my classmates took his own life. This loss destroyed my town. My classmate was friendly to just about every person he met, and lit up any room he entered.\n\nHis death motivated me to volunteer with a mental health organization, where I coordinated and publicized fundraising events at my school to increase funding for mental health resources. I also acted as a spokesperson for the organization when dealing with my school’s administrators, and I raised awareness of mental health tools, like my school’s Hope Squad.\n\nAt the organization, I frequently heard stories from teens within my community about how the foundation saved their lives and provided them with a fresh start. This experience gave me a new sense of the value of community. I learned how to listen empathetically to boost a person’s spirits and make them feel heard, and how even a small gesture on my part can give someone a transformative feeling of support and belonging. I also gained the ability to communicate effectively and organize efficiently in order to maximize the foundation’s reach and impact.\n\nThrough our efforts, my school has increased its mental health awareness. It now provides resources to help students’ manage their stress, providing therapy dogs, additional counselors, and spirit week before exam period. I hope to continue to participate in mental health efforts within Duke’s National Alliance on Mental Illness by organizing meaningful events focused on overcoming the stigma associated with mental illness.\n\n— — —\n\nTips + Analysis\n\nThis student shares the deeply personal and likely devastating life experience of losing a classmate to suicide, and how that catalyzed them to organize within the community around mental health issues. They do a nice job of sharing specific details that illustrate core values and skills (e.g. compassion, listening, creating space for others to feel supported) that show how they’ll be a valuable addition to the college community, continuing to create support for others while hopefully changing perceptions and stigmas around mental health.\n\nSpecial thanks to Shira for writing this post."
