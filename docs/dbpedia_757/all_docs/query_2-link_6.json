        "text": "Overview 2\n\nA Washington University Law education will introduce you to all facets of the law, while also empowering you to personalize your curriculum and further investigate your areas of interest. Our program is designed to educate well-rounded, thoughtful attorneys. You will be well-prepared to make a difference for your clients, with a solid foundation in the history of the law and the skills to respond to new challenges.\n\nStudent-Faculty Ratio 3\n\n7.5:1\n\nAdmission Criteria 4\n\nLSAT GPA 25th-75th Percentile 160-169 3.15-3.81 Median 170 3.67\n\nThe above LSAT and GPA data pertain to the 2016 entering class.\n\nDirector of admissions Mary Ann Clifford Application deadline August 15\n\nLaw School Admissions details based on 2016 data.\n\nAdmission Statistics 4\n\nApproximate number of applications 4113 Number accepted 1311 Percentage accepted 31.9%\n\nThe above admission details are based on 2016 data.\n\nLaw School Cost 5\n\nTuition and fees Full-time: $53,506 per year Room and board $14,400 Books $2,000 Miscellaneous expenses $7,211\n\nLaw School Cost details based on 2016 data.\n\nClass Ranking and Grades 6\n\nEffective with the class of 2013, the Washington University School of Law changed the grading system from number grades (70- 100) to letter grades (A, B, etc.), along with changing the GPAs to a 4.0 scale (based on 31 number grades separated by .06, ranging from 2.50-4.30) that continue to allow the Faculty to distinguish between students’ scores to a greater degree than the systems at most other Law Schools. The conversion scale is:\n\nLetter Grades Values A+ 4.00-4.30 A 3.76-3.94 A- 3.58-3.70 B+ 3.34-3.52 B 3.16-3.28 B- 3.04-3.10 C+ 2.92-2.98 C 2.80-2.86 D 2.74 F 2.50-2.68\n\nEffective with the class of 2004 and ending with the class of 2013, the Washington University School of Law instituted a grading system with a scale of 70 - 100. Effective with that graduating class, the middle score in the scale was changed from an 83 to an 87. With this new scale, a grade of 74 or better was necessary to earn credit in a course. A 79 average was necessary to remain in good standing each year and overall in the new scale. The conversion of number grades to letter grades (updated in 2013) is:\n\nA+ 95-100 A 91-94 A- 88-90 B+ 84-87 B 81-83 B- 79-80 C+ 77-78 C 75-76 D 74 F 70-73\n\nAdditional Grades Codes:\n\nThe law school offers following additional grade codes:\n\nAUD Audit CR# or CR Credit CIP Course In Progress N Grade Not Recorded HP High Pass NCR# or NCR No credit I – Incomplete Incomplete IP In Progress P Pass PW Permitted to withdraw RX Reexamined in course LP Low Pass RW Required to withdraw R Course repeated\n\nHonors 7\n\nBoston College Law School does not rank its students. An approximation of grade distributions is issued for the 2L and 3L classes at the end of each semester, and for the 1L class at the end of the Academic Year.\n\nLatin Honors are awarded at graduation as follows:\n\nHonor Criteria Order of the Coif The Order of the Coif is an honorary scholastic society (http://www.orderofthecoif.org) the purpose of which is to encourage excellence in legal education by fostering a spirit of careful study, recognizing those who as law students attained a high grade of scholarship, and honoring those who as lawyers, judges and teachers attained high distinction for their scholarly or professional accomplishments. J.D. students who rank in the top ten per cent of their class are selected, barring any disciplinary or honor issues. Based on Order of the Coif rules, in order to be eligible a student must have taken 75% of his/her credits \"graded.\" If a student plans to graduate with the 86 minimum credits required for the J.D, this means s/he must take at least 64 credits graded, and no more than 22 credits non-graded. According to the Order of the Coif, \"'Graded courses' are those for which academic accomplishment is recorded on the basis of educational measurement involving four or more discriminators.\" WUSL's modified pass/fail courses (HP94, P, LP78, F70), such as Pretrial and Trial, count as graded courses per this definition. Credit bearing activities such as publications, competitions (participants and board members), supervised research, Judicial Clerkship, Negotiation, and Non-Law courses do not count as graded courses because there are only two grade discriminators - Credit or No Credit. Students vying for the top 10% should keep this information in mind, especially if considering applying for a semester abroad (which would likely involve at least 12 non-graded credits) or doing an externship (the Congressional/Administrative Law externship has 8 non-graded credits, and other externships usually have 12 non-graded credits). Initiates receive certificates and the honor appears on the transcript. Dean’s List This honor is bestowed upon J.D. students at the end of the fall and spring semesters and is based on the semester grade point average.

J.D. students who rank in the top 10% of their class according to their yearly GPAs are designated as Honor Scholars.

Our staff selects and edits articles from legal scholars, practitioners, and students, and we welcome submissions on any legal topic.\n\nWashington University Journal of Law and Policy\n\nThe Journal of Law and Policy is committed to generating a symposium-based publication that brings together communities of scholars, through a mutual and collaborative student and faculty process, emphasizing existing and emerging visions of the law in relation to interdisciplinary and multicultural perspectives, the implications of technology, and the consequences of economic globalization for the purpose of influencing law and social policy. In furtherance of this mission, the Journal of Law and Policy, unlike most law reviews, centers each volume around a pertinent theme or issue. The articles therein are authored by professors of law, legal practitioners, judges, and distinguished scholars from a variety of academic disciplines.\n\nWashington University Global Studies Law Review\n\nWelcome to the internet home of Washington University Global Studies Law Review. Building on Washington University's distinguished reputation, Global Studies presents outstanding articles, book reviews, essays, and notes from prestigious academics, practitioners and prominent students to expand the global community's knowledge and understanding of real-world issues. Global Studies Law Review publishes quarterly.\n\nWashington University Jurisprudence Review\n\nWashington University Jurisprudence Review is the only student-edited, in-print journal of jurisprudence in the United States. The Jurisprudence Review promotes academic discussion and scholarship at the nexus of law and legal theory by publishing two issues per year with works that contribute to analytic, normative, and comparative jurisprudence from scholars both within and without the legal academy. We also seek to enrich the law school experience by fostering critical analysis of the suppositions and theories that underpin the law school curriculum.\n\nMoot Court 13\n\nThe School offers a rich program of lawyering skills competitions to the curricula. Both first-year and upper-class students are encouraged to refine their lawyering techniques through our various lawyer advocacy competitions.
