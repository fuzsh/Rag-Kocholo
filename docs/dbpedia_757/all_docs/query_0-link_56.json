        "text": "Washington is one of the best states at attracting and retaining top legal talent. Approximately 47 percent of lawyers in Washington attended one of the three programs on this list. The state is home to some of the finest universities in the country and known for its forward-thinking approach.\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the importance of picking a law school. Your program will provide the structural foundation necessary to pass the bar and practice law effectively. It can also shape the way you see and experience the field based on clinics, externships, and study abroad opportunities.\n\nOur goal is to make picking a law school more manageable. We’ve researched and ranked the most prestigious programs in Washington, so you can understand what each university has to offer.\n\nHere are our rankings in terms of top law schools in Washington:\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nGonzaga University\n\nSeattle University\n\n1) University of Washington\n\nNational Ranking1: 44\n\nBar Passage Rate: 85.7 percent\n\nCost of Tuition: $35,988 in-state, $47,190 out-of-state\n\nAcceptance Rate: 26.4 percent\n\nLSAT2: 158 – 165\n\nGPA: 3.44 – 3.8\n\nThe University of Washington School of Law is the highest-ranked law school in the Pacific Northwest. The ranking is based on data from U.S. News and World Report. The program currently enrolls 492 students and offers a student-faculty ratio of 5.4 to 1.\n\nJ.D. students can focus their education in one of several tracks, including Asian, global business, comparative, environmental, and public service law.\n\nUW School of Law also provides opportunities for dual-degrees, including J.D./M.B.A., a J.D./M.B.A. in Health Administration, and a J.D./Master of Public Administration. Other degrees include an LL.M., M.J., and Ph.D.\n\nWashington University School of Law emphasizes public service before graduation which makes the program unique. Students must complete 60 hours at clinics or externships. Some opportunities include the Innocence Project Northwest, Street Law, and Tribal Court Public Defense.\n\nThe university excels when it comes to the library and research opportunities, too. The Marian Gould Gallagher Law Library has more than 650,000 volumes along with 38 facilities for legal information. U.S. News and World Report ranked the law librarianship program first in the nation for three consecutive years (2017-2019).\n\nUW School of Law also has forty student organizations that enrich the academic experience.

However, the university also has one of the most prestigious law schools in the region. Gonzaga Law dates back to 1912 with an inaugural class of 13 students.\n\nGonzaga Law has grown since then and currently has alumni practicing in all 50 states, as well as abroad. The program enrolls approximately 336 students with 117 faculty members. Students can opt for a Juris Doctor, Accelerated Two-Year Juris Doctor, or one of the four dual-degree tracks.\n\nAdditionally, the school has a strong academic record, with more than 96 percent of graduates passing the bar in March 2018. The National Jurist ranked Gonzaga Law highly when it came to practical training and small law opportunities. It was the publication’s “#3 Top School of Latter-Day Saints” in 2013 and 2017, and “#6 Most Devout School for Catholics” in 2017.\n\n3) Seattle University\n\nNational Ranking: 122\n\nBar Passage Rate: 72 percent\n\nCost of Tuition: $46,586 full-time, $29,514 part-time\n\nAcceptance Rate: 64.2 percent\n\nLSAT: 152 – 156\n\nGPA: 3.09 – 3.58\n\nSeattle University School of Law was formerly known as the University of Puget Sound School of Law.
