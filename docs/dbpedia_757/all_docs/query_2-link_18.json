        "text": "The Inter-University Exchange program is a consortium agreement between Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis University (SLU) and the University of Missouri-St. Louis (UMSL).\n\nThe IE program began in 1976 as an exchange agreement between these three institutions encouraging greater inter-institutional cooperation at the graduate level. Over time, this program has evolved to include undergraduate education; however, the basic provisions of the original agreement are still in place today, and participation continues to be at the discretion of each academic department or unit.\n\nAt Washington University, there are several schools which DO NOT PARTICIPATE in this program (i.e., degree-seeking students in these schools are not eligible to participate in the IE program, and courses offered in these schools are not open to SLU and UMSL students attending WashU through the IE program). They are the Washington University School of Law, the Washington University School of Medicine, the McKelvey School of Engineering, the School of Continuing & Professional Studies, and the Arts & Sciences Summer School. The WashU schools that are open to participation in the Inter-University Exchange program may have specific limitations or requirements on participation; details are available in those offices.\n\nNote: the UMSL/WashU Joint Undergraduate Engineering Program is separate from the Inter-University Exchange Program.\n\nProvisions\n\nThe following provisions apply to all coursework taken by Washington University students at Saint Louis University (SLU) or the University of Missouri-St. Louis (UMSL) through the Inter-University Exchange program:\n\nSuch courses will be used in the fulfillment of degree requirements but schools vary in policy as to whether they will apply to GPA, units or major requirements.\n\nSuch courses are not regularly offered at Washington University.\n\nRegistration for such courses requires preliminary approval of the student’s major/department advisor, the student’s division office or dean, and the academic department of the host university.\n\nStudents at the home institution have first claim on course enrollment (i.e., a desired course at SLU or UMSL may be fully subscribed and unable to accept WashU students).\n\nAcademic credit earned in such courses will be considered as resident credit, not transfer credit.\n\nTuition for such courses will be paid to Washington University at the prevailing WashU rates; there is no additional tuition cost to the student who enrolls in IE coursework on another campus. However, students are responsible for any/all fees charged by the other school.\n\nLibrary privileges attendant on enrolling in a course on a host campus will be made available in the manner prescribed by the host campus.\n\nEnrollment Instructions\n\nWashington University students must be enrolled full-time in order to participate in the IE program and have no Holds, financial or otherwise, on their academic record at WashU or at the host institution.\n\nThe student must complete the Inter-University Exchange application form (pdf). Forms are also available from the Office of the University Registrar in the Women’s Building, Suite 10.\n\nThe student must provide all information requested in the top portion of the form and indicate the course in which he or she wishes to enroll.\n\nThe student must obtain the approval signature of the professor teaching the class (or department chair) at SLU or UMSL, preferably in person.\n\nThe student must also obtain approval signatures of his or her major advisor at WashU and the appropriate individual in his or her dean’s office.\n\nCompleted forms must be submitted to the Office of the University Registrar in the Women’s Building a minimum of one week before the start of the term.\n\nCourse enrollment is handled administratively by the registrars of the home and host institutions. WashU students registered for IE coursework will see these courses on their class schedule and academic record at WebSTAC under departments I97 (SLU) and I98 (UMSL).\n\nFinal grades are recorded when received from the host institution. The student does not need to obtain an official transcript from SLU or UMSL to receive academic credit for IE coursework at WashU."
