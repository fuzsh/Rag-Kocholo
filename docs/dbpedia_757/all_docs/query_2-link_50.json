The ABA Standards may be found at americanbar.org. Any student at the law school who wishes to bring a formal complaint to the administration of the law school of a significant problem that directly implicates the school’s program of legal education and its compliance with the ABA Standards should do the following:\n\nSubmit the complaint in writing to the Associate Dean, Student Life. If the Associate Dean is not available, then submit the complaint to the Assistant Director of Student Life. The writing may consist of email, U.S. mail, or fax.\n\nThe writing should describe in detail the behavior, program, process, or other matter that is the subject of the complaint, and should explain how the matter implicates the law school’s program of legal education and its compliance with a specific, identified ABA Standard(s).\n\nThe writing must provide the name, official law school email address, and a street address of the complaining student, for further communication about the complaint.\n\nThe Associate Dean will acknowledge the complaint within three business days of receipt of the written complaint. Acknowledgment may be made by email, U.S. mail, or by personal delivery, at the option of the Associate Dean.\n\nWithin two weeks of acknowledgment of the complaint, the administrator, or the administrator’s designee, shall either meet with the complaining student, or respond to the substance of the complaint in writing. In this meeting or in this writing, the student should either receive a substantive response to the complaint, or information about what steps are being taken by the law school to address the complaint or further investigate the complaint. If further investigation is needed, when the investigation is completed, the student shall be provided either a substantive response to the complaint or information about what steps are being taken by the law school to address the complaint within two weeks after completion of the investigation.\n\nAppeals regarding decisions on complaints may be taken to the Dean of the law school. Any decision made on appeal by the Dean shall be final.\n\nA copy of the complaint and a summary of the process and resolution of the complaint shall be kept in the office of the Associate Dean, Student Life for a period of ten years from the date of final resolution of the complaint.\n\nABA Standard 310\n\nABA Standard 310 requires at least 42.5 hours of in-class and out-of-class work for each credit hour awarded. Each course at the school is designed to meet this requirement. All existing courses meet this requirement, and all new course proposals must include a statement demonstrating that the number of units of credit to be awarded is consistent with the requirements of ABA Standard 310.
