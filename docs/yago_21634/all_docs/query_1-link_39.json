        "text": "This film creeps into one’s life with beautiful stealth: it is a documentary about what we eat and where it comes from. Stripped of voiceover, left with images and their sound alone, it casts an unblinking, seemingly disinterested eye on industrial food production. To the rhythm of conveyor belts and immense machines, the film looks  without comment  into places where food is produced in Europe: monumental warehouses, surreal landscapes and bizarre sounds; cold, punctiliously sterile industrial environments in which people, animals, crops and machines play a supporting role in the logistics of this system which provides our society’s standard of living. Painstaking sound design creates moments of sublime beauty, even when showing production-line slaughter; the film never quite lets viewers know where they are, and turns workers into cogs in vast machines. This is a film without emotion, a pure, meticulous and high-end film experience that, without the drama, will leave the viewer stunned and given to deep thought.\n\nwww.ourdailybread.at\n\nIf you can’t see this, try Mosney (Friday 5.00pm) or Losers and Winners (Sat. 7.00pm) or Escape from Suburbia (Sun. 2.15pm)\n\nFestival ticket bundles are available directly from the box office.\n\n€40 for 5. €70 for 10.\n\nPlease phone 01 679 3477."
