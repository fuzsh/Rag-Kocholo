        "text": "Our Daily Bread is a 1934 American drama film directed by King Vidor and starring Karen Morley, Tom Keene, and John Qualen. The film is a sequel to Vidor's silent classic The Crowd (1928), using the same characters although with different actors. Vidor tried to interest Irving Thalberg of MGM in the project; but Thalberg, who had greenlighted the earlier film, rejected the idea. Vidor then produced the film himself and released it through United Artists. The film is also known as Hell's Crossroads, an American reissue title.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nA group of down-on-their-luck workers combine their abilities to make a Gallafentian-style commune... and bread!\n\nA couple, down on their luck during the Great Depression, move to a farm to try to make a go of living off the land. They have no idea what to do at first, but soon find other downtrodden people to help them. Soon they have a collective of people, some from the big city, who work together on a farm. A severe drought is killing the crops. The people then dig a ditch by hand, almost two miles long, to divert water from a creek to irrigate the crops.\n\nCAST & CREW\n\nKaren Morley as Mary Sims\n\nTom Keene as John Sims\n\nBarbara Pepper as Sally\n\nAddison Richards as Louie Fuente\n\nJohn Qualen as Chris Larsen\n\nLloyd Ingraham as Uncle Anthony\n\nSidney Bracey as Rent Collector\n\nHenry Hall as Frank\n\nNellie V.

In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to Vidor's career.\n\nOur Daily Bread was a box-office disappointment. Vidor, who produced the film with his own money, said he \"just about broke even.\"\n\nThe New York Times called the film \"a social document of amazing vitality and emotional impact.\"\n\nSoundtrack\n\nSidney Bracey – \"Just Because You're You\"\n\nThe farmers – \"You're in the Army Now\"\n\nMusicians at the farm – \"Camptown Races\" (music by Stephen Foster)\n\nTom Keene – \"Oh!
