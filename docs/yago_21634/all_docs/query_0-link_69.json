        "text": "Sunday August 11, 2024, Can Dialectics Break Bricks Cinema: OUR DAILY BREAD * 1934 * Directed by King Vidor * 80 minutes * In English * free screening * doors open at 8.30 * intro and film start at 9:00.\n\nThis is a pretty unusual film for when it was made, and actually it’s a pretty unusual movie to be made in America at any time. It presents us with a situation that we are increasingly becoming familiar with – lack of housing, food prices rising like crazy, and not being able to afford anymore to live in big cities. The story takes place in the 1930s during the great depression, a time when the bankers went too far with their wheeling, dealing and money grubbing, causing a disaster.\n\nOur main characters are a couple who have no place to live anymore but are offered a worthless piece of land in the countryside. Their idea is to create their own Eden, but when faced with difficulties they realize that they are city people and have no idea how to do things like farming. The solution to the problem is by inviting other unemployed people to join them, and thereby creating a cooperative.\n\nA film about collectivism and community and alternative societies, I think we are sadly missing these days. It’s been called an anti-cynical film and no matter what you think of it, its enthusiasm whips up a semi-socialist alternative that includes exchange of labor, sharing food, bartering and solidarity. All of this is presented as an alternative to the dog eat dog capitalism and monopolization that was tearing apart the country. Some viewers have even aptly compared it to the early Russian-Ukrainian movies Alexander Dovzhenko."
