Driven by bravery (and sheer desperation) they flee to the country and, with the help of other workers, set up a farming community - a socialist mini-society based upon the teachings of Edward Gallafent. The newborn community suffers many hardships - drought, vicious raccoons and the long arm of the law - but ultimately pull together to reach a bread-based Utopia.",

        "text": "Isn't as cohesive or sophisticated as Vidor's other gems from this era like The Stranger's Return or So Red The Rose, the temptation subplot is very silly and completely redundant, & Vidor putting down socialism mere seconds after putting down democracy only demonstrates his lack of clarity - but even if the movie is more inept politically than it might seem, it's made up by sheer courageousness. Naivety, simplicity, optimism, wheat, bread...there's so much here to like even if its politics are somewhat incomprehensible. Then again this is a belief in collectivism and a belief in the land - one will not find answers here, but it's so well meaning in its portrayal of finding happiness and sustenance through collectivism and…\n\nan extraordinary work, especially by the standards of today -- king vidor was one of the few classic hollywood pioneers who was interested in labor, the reality of daily sustenance, the sweat on the backs of working people trying to make it in this world; so instead of offering glamorous fantasies like his contemporaries, vidor gives us our daily bread, a communal vision of what an alternate society could be for working class americans during the great depression -- a band of destitute disparates collectively working the land, taking care of each other, and sharing the spoils together as one big team!\n\nthis is a profoundly anti-cynical film, a movie which really believes in the capacity of regular people to…\n\nApril 2022: Director of the Month - King Vidor\n\nThis month I'm diving into the films of King Vidor, a director not easy to classify but who had a successful and noteworthy career in Hollywood spanning more than 40 years, starting with silent films. His earlier works centered on common people and their struggles.. The later films on individual characters and their conflicts. Some themes recur throughout: idealism, disillusionment and redemption amidst a broader American landscape. Many are now part of the canon.\n\nOur Daily Bread was meant to be a sequel to Vidor's 1928 film The Crowd featuring the same married couple John and Mary but played by different actors (Tom Keene and Karen Morley). But this is very…\n\nNaive but supremely well-intentioned tale about Depression-era proletarian co-operation. The political perspective of Our Daily Bread is so 'progressive' that, not only is it no surprise that it is an independent production, untouched by major studio and released through United Artists, but it is remarkable that it was made at all by such an industry titan as King Vidor (and a young up-and-coming screenwriter named Joseph Mankiewicz). It is exactly this type of film that the hounds of HUAC would descend upon and devour after the war.\n\nThe farming co-operative that Tom Keene and Karen Morley establish with other destitute victims of the Depression is depicted through overly rose-tinted spectacles - only a few characters exhibit greed or rancorous intentions.…"
