        "text": "Coming Sunday, 7/5: 'The Big Parade' (1925)\n\nin 35mm at the Somerville Theatre\n\nAn original poster for MGM's blockbuster 'The Big Parade' (1925).\n\nLooking for something different to mark Independence Day?\n\nThen march on over to the Somerville Theatre in Somerville, Mass., where I'm doing live music for a screening of 'The Big Parade' (1925) in 35mm on Sunday, July 5 at 2 p.m.\n\nDespite now being 90 years old, this amazing movie—all about American soldiers who ship off to Europe to join in World War I—has lost none of its emotional impact.\n\nDirected by a very young King Vidor, the film set new standards for realism in the then-still-new medium of cinema. It was the 'Saving Private Ryan' of its time, as mentioned in the press release below.\n\nThe result was an enormous blockbuster for MGM, which had just been created by a recent merger. 'The Big Parade' caused a sensation, becoming the studio's highest-grossing picture up until 'Gone With the Wind' hit the screen in 1939.\n\nWhat I like most about 'The Big Parade,' and what I think still works just as intended, is its very simple but powerful structure.\n\nVidor directed the first half of the film in the style of a light romantic lark. We follow the GIs into the French countryside, where they bunk together in barns and get to know one another—and we get to know them. Plenty of hijinks ensue, including flirting with the local women, with no shortage of humor. It's kind of like a Sad Sack comic book story come to life.\n\nThat's John Gilbert under the barrel, getting to know a French village gal played by Renée Adorée.\n\nBut then the men get called up to the front, and everything changes. Vidor takes the men we've gotten to know and marches them into the trenches, and we can't help but be pulled along with them. We're suddenly in a world of darkness and mud and giant explosions and shrapnel and death everywhere.\n\nIn the trenches: John Gilbert surrounded by comrades Tom O'Brien (left) and Karl Dane.\n\nWho will make it? Who will not?\n\nI've accompanied this film many times now, and the structure never fails. You get to know these characters, and then you're tossed into the trenches with them. Everything is suddenly more intense, more vivid, more urgent, and more real. It's as if you wake from a dream but then get caught up in a nightmare.\n\nVidor not only brought you visually into places most audiences had never been taken, but his structure helped mimic the emotional landscape of battle. His structure helps us feel at least a little bit of what it's like to be part of a group now facing danger in a strange land for a cause that may or may not be worth fighting for, despite your duty.\n\nWith this in mind, it's a great film for music. To help underline the contrast, I've found it works well to score the whole first half as if it's one of those Sigmund Romberg operettas—a fanciful European fairytale.\n\nThen, in the second half, I shift to an entirely different and much more aggressive style of accompaniment to communicate how things have changed. To me, the point where there's no turning back is the scene when the soldiers emerge from a forest and move out onto a blasted battlefield that's under continuous shellfire. No more Romberg from then on, folks.\n\n'The Big Parade' is sometimes called the first \"anti-war\" film, but I think that's overemphasizing one aspect of it and putting it into a box in which it doesn't fit.\n\nRather, I think it celebrates the whole complex experience of being an American and serving one's country. And I can't think of a more satisfying way to finish a weekend of fireworks celebrating our nation's birth.\n\nSo come see 'The Big Parade.' More info about the screening is in the press release below. Hope to see you there!\n\nP.S. Interesting trivia about 'The Big Parade'...renowned painter Andrew Wyeth first saw the film with his father in 1925, sparking a life-long interest. In a 1975 letter to director King Vidor, Wyeth claimed to have seen the film more than 200 times! For more info, check out info on this lecture at the Farnsworth Museum in Maine, where I've been trying to program 'The Big Parade' for some time now. How about it, guys?\n\n* * *\n\nThe classic shot: John Gilbert and Renée Adorée in 'The Big Parade' (1925).\n\nJUNE 24, 2015 / FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContact Jeff Rapsis at (603) 236-9237 • e-mail jrapsis@gmail.com\n\nEpic war movie 'The Big Parade' to be screened in 35mm on Sunday, 7/5 at Somerville Theatre\n\nTo be shown with live music; blockbuster silent film drama\n\nchanged the way Hollywood depicted battle on the screen\n\nSOMERVILLE, Mass. — It was the 'Saving Private Ryan' of its time — a movie that showed audiences combat as experienced by a soldier whose life is changed forever by the horrors of war.\n\nIt was 'The Big Parade' (1925), a sprawling World War I epic and a box office sensation that made MGM into a powerhouse studio in Hollywood's golden years. It's the latest installment of 'Silents, Please!,' a monthly silent film series with live music at the Somerville Theatre.\n\n'The Big Parade' will be screened in 35mm one time only at the Somerville Theatre on Sunday, July 5 at 2 p.m. General admission is $15; seniors/students $12.\n\nThe show will feature live accompaniment by silent film musician Jeff Rapsis.\n\n'The Big Parade,' released just a few years after World War I ended, was hailed by critics as the first Hollywood film to depict the harsh reality of combat and its impact of troops in the trenches and foxholes. Its hellish battle scenes were staged on a massive scale and still retain their ability to shock audiences.\n\nThe picture, based on the best-selling novel \"What Price Glory?\", follows the story of a young man (John Gilbert) who rebels against a privileged background by enlisting in the army just before the U.S. enters World War I.\n\nHe is shipped out to France, where he falls in love with a local French woman before being transferred to the front. There, he and his squadmates face the German war machine, where they must endure the ultimate tests of duty and honor in a battle they come to see as meaningless.\n\nIn addition to vivid war scenes, the film contains a famous dramatic sequence in which the French woman (Renée Adorée) realizes her love for the soldier, and tries to find him to say goodbye as the massive convoy of troops pulls out for the front. Another celebrated sequence depicts the light-hearted first meeting of the soldier and the girl, in which he teaches her how to chew gum.\n\n'The Big Parade' went on to become the top-grossing movie of the entire silent film era, earning $6.4 million domestically and making director King Vidor into the Steven Spielberg of his day. It stood as MGM's biggest single box office hit until the release of 'Gone With the Wind' in 1939.\n\nRapsis will improvise a musical score to the film in real time. In creating accompaniment for the 'The Big Parade' and other vintage classics, Rapsis tries to bridge the gap between silent film and modern audiences.\n\n\"Live music adds an element of energy to a silent film screening that's really crucial to the experience,\" Rapsis said. \" 'The Big Parade' is filled with great scenes that lend themselves well to music. It's a real privilege to create a score to help this great picture come back to life,\" Rapsis said.\n\nOther upcoming features in the Somerville's silent film schedule include:\n\n• Sunday, Aug. 2, 2 p.m.: 'Speedy' (1928) starring Harold Lloyd. Can Harold New York City's last horsedrawn streetcar line from the clutches of a greedy transport tycoon? The Big Apple co-stars in one of Harold's great silent comic masterpieces. Plus an extended cameo appearance from none other than Babe Ruth!\n\n• Sunday, Sept. 13, 2 p.m.: 'The Matrimaniac' (1916) starring Douglas Fairbanks Sr. An unusual program that contrasts this early Fairbanks marital farce with another picture released by the same studio after Fairbanks had moved on, but which uses material from the Fairbanks film to support an entirely different story.\n\n• Sunday, Oct. 4, 2 p.m.: 'Tramp Tramp Tramp' (1926) starring Harry Langdon, Joan Crawford. The great silent film comedian Harry Langdon returns to the Somerville's big screen, this time with a very young Joan Crawford playing his love interest! His debut feature finds Harry entering a cross-country walking race to save the family business and impress the girl of his dreams.\n\nAll entries in the Somerville's silent film series are shown using 35mm prints, the native film format that few theaters are now equipped to run following Hollywood's transition to digital formats.\n\nMGM's silent blockbuster ‘The Big Parade’ will be shown in 35mm and with live music on Sunday, July 5 at 2 p.m. at Somerville Theatre, 55 Davis Square, Somerville, Mass.\n\nAdmission to the screening is $15 or $12 seniors/students; general admission seating.

The year before that, sailing ships.\n\nBut this summer, our silent film series at the marvelous Wilton (N.H.) Town Hall Theatre will focus on trains.\n\nSo all you foamers, mark those calendars: the series starts on Sunday, June 28 at 4:30 p.m. with 'The Arizona Express' (1924), a rip-roaring saga of the rails with enough mainline action to please any railroad fan.\n\n(\"Foamer\" is a derisive term used by railroad employees for people who love trains, so used because such folks foam at the mouth when one goes by.)\n\nThere's a press release below with more info about 'The Arizona Express' and other films we're showing in the series.\n\nBut for now, I'm just coming off a busy weekend of accompaniment adventures that included:\n\n• A well-attended screening of 'Wings' (1927) on Thursday, June 18 at the Leavitt Theatre in Ogunquit, Maine.\n\n• A lively response to 'The Lost World' (1925) on Saturday, June 20 at Brandon Town Hall in Brandon, Vt.\n\n• An unusual screening of 'The General' (1926) on Sunday, June 21 at the Aeronaut Brewing Co. in Somerville, Mass.\n\nThe last one was scheduled as part of the first anniversary celebration of the Aeronaut, a sprawling craft brewery set up in a big old industrial space on a Somerville side street.\n\nIt's quite a place. The brewery's symbol is the iconic image of a lawn chair with balloons attached to it; because of that, the warehouse space is festooned with lawnchairs with clusters of balloons hanging from the ceiling.\n\nBut it's not just about the beer. (Which is great, by the way.) Owners Ben and Christine Holmes are developing the Aeronaut's cavernous home into a public art and performance space that features an ever-changing roster of musical acts, interpretive dance, and anything else that seems worth trying. Even silent films with live music!\n\nAnd that's where I come in. Alas, before I came in, city inspectors came in, making a surprise visit to the Aeronaut, and ruled that if the film was shown where we'd planned to (an alcove off to one side), we'd be in violation of the Aeronaut's permit.\n\nA music group performing with the trapeze above.\n\nWhat to do? No problem: just show the film in the main room. Well, actually, one problem: the screen high above was obscured by a full-size trapeze and aerial silks hung from the steel girders high above.\n\nWould this be the first silent film presentation to be cancelled due to a trapeze?\n\nWell, nope—as it turned out, Ben had access to one of those mobile scissor lifting platforms that could be used to reach the ceiling. He piloted it from the loading dock down a narrow corridor, then raised it up to stow the trapeze and hanging silks in the rafters.\n\nThis piece of equipment saved the day. I wonder what Buster Keaton could have done with one of these.\n\nAnd so the show went on: Ben introduced me as \"the improvisational composer,\" which I kind of liked. Good reaction to 'The General.' and there's talk of another show later this summer. We'll see.\n\nFor now, I'm looking forward to our summer series of train movies in Wilton, N.H. For more information, please read on!\n\n* * *\n\nTom Mix and Tony the Wonder Horse star in 'The Great K & A Train Robbery' (1926).\n\nWEDNESDAY, JUNE 10, 2015 / FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContact Jeff Rapsis • (603) 236-9237 • jeffrapsis@gmail.com\n\nAll aboard! Wilton (N.H.) Town Hall Theatre\n\nto launch series of vintage railroad dramas\n\nFull steam ahead with summer line-up of train-themed silent films; all screened with live musical accompaniment\n\nWILTON, N.H.—If you like trains, get ready to climb aboard.\n\nA series of vintage big screen railroad dramas highlights this summer's silent film schedule at the Wilton Town Hall Theatre.\n\nThe train-themed movies, all accompanied by live music, are fast-paced silent-era melodramas set in the world of big-time railroading.\n\n\"These movies were made at a time when cars and trucks were rare, and railroads were a part of everyday life across the nation,\" said Jeff Rapsis, a New Hampshire-based silent film accompanist who will provide live music for each movie.\n\n\"So the early studios capitalized on the public's close relationship with trains by churning out all kinds of railroad-themed pictures. In the silent era, it was a popular sub-genre,\" Rapsis said.\n\nThe Town Hall Theatre's railroad series opens on Sunday, June 28 at 4:30 p.m. with 'The Arizona Express' (1924), a rip-roaring melodrama rarely screened since its original release.\n\nOther films in the series include silent cowboy star Tom Mix in 'The Great K & A Train Robbery' (1926) on Sunday, July 12; and the railroad crime story 'Red Signals' (1927) on Sunday, Aug. 9.\n\nThe series concludes on Sunday, Aug. 30 with 'The Iron Horse' (1924), John Ford's epic drama about building of the transcontinental railroad in the 1860s.\n\nA scene from John Ford's 'The Iron Horse' (1924).\n\nAll shows in the series start at 4:30 p.m. The Town Hall Theatre's screenings are free and open to the public; a donation of $5 per person is suggested to help defray expenses.\n\nSilent-era railroad dramas are of particular interest to train buffs because they're filled with scenes of working railroads in action about 100 years ago, at a time the nation's reliance on the rail network reached its peak.\n\nEach film in the series has been selected for its overall story quality and lasting audience appeal.\n\n\"Even if you're not a railfan, each of these movies offers a great story told at a fast pace,\" Rapsis said. \"These films were designed to be crowd-pleasers, and they still work today. They're the films that caused audiences to first fall in love with the movies.\"\n\nThe Wilton Town Hall Theatre has been showing films since 1912. In addition to running the best current releases on its two screens, the theater remains committed to alternative programming such as its ongoing series of silent films with live music.\n\nThe silent series gives local audiences to experience great work of early cinema as it was intended to be seen: on the big screen, with live music, and with an audience.\n\nAn original poster for John Ford's epic 'The Iron Horse' (1924).\n\nThe complete roster of films in this summer's railroad series includes:\n\n• Sunday, June 28 at 4:30 p.m.: 'The Arizona Express' (1924). We launch a summer series of train films with rip-roaring melodrama. When David Keith is sent to prison for allegedly killing his uncle, his sister Katherine must prove his innocence and get the information to the governor's office in time to save him.\n\n• Sunday, July 12 at 4:30 p.m.: 'The Great K & A Train Robbery' (1926) starring Tom Mix. Treachery on the rails as our hero goes undercover to learn who is tipping the bandits. One of the best Tom Mix films, with plenty of action and some fantastic stunt work.\n\n• Sunday, Aug. 9 at 4:30 p.m.: 'Red Signals' (1927). After a series of train accidents in which the wrecks were looted, the railroad's top brass bring in \"Sure Fire\" Frank Bennett to set things right.\n\n• Sunday, Aug. 30 at 4:30 p.m.: 'The Iron Horse' (1924). Director John Ford's sprawling epic tale about the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad. Highlighted by spectacular location filming in the wide open spaces of the Old West.\n\nThe Summer Train Film Series will begin with a screening of 'The Arizona Express' (1924) on Sunday, June 28 at 4:30 p.m. at the Wilton Town Hall Theatre, 60 Main St., Wilton, N.H.\n\nAdmission to the screenings is free; a donation of $5 per person is suggested.\n\nFor more info, call (603) 654-3456 or visit www.wiltontownhalltheatre.com.

This one is borrowed from accompanist Ben Model.\n\nWhat happens when you assemble dozens and dozens of unidentified film clips, and then run them in a theater full of vintage movie experts armed with Internet access?\n\nYou get 'Mostly Lost,' a unique classic movie gathering—unique in that it actually encourages audience members to talk (the louder the better), check their laptops, and generally raise a ruckus, all while a film is running.\n\nThe idea is that someone might be able to identify something on screen: an actress, a location, a detail that fixes a year or date. And often, that's enough for everyone else to start calling out suggestions or mining the Internet for more info to nail down the film's title.\n\nThe thing is, it works! More often than not, a film is identified thanks to the collective brain power of some of the film community's biggest nerds—er, leading aficionados.\n\nAnd I've seen it in action, having just returned from attending the most recent edition of \"Mostly Lost,\" now in its fourth year at the Packard Center of the Library of Congress down in Culpeper, Virginia.\n\nThe full \"Mostly Lost\" is three days of film screenings and other events. But a tight schedule meant I could only make it down for the final day on Saturday, June 13.\n\nEven so, a visit to the Packard Center earlier this year (thanks, Rob Stone!) had me eager to see \"Mostly Lost\" in action.\n\nThat, and a $59 round-trip airfare (that's no misprint) on JetBlue out of Hartford was enough for me get down there. And I'm glad I did.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how interactive the whole process is. Once the films start running, one after another, everyone joins in. And I mean everyone—not just the big-name experts on hand, but just plain folks of all ages. They all throw out suggestions, comments, corny jokes, and anything else that comes to mind.\n\nIt's surprisingly refreshing—because, I think, we're so used to experiencing cinema as a passive art form. We sit, we watch. But at \"Mostly Lost,\" we engage with the screen in a way that transforms movie-going into a collaborative effort.\n\nThe view from my seat on Saturday during 'Mostly Lost.' That's Phil Carli at the keyboard at lower right.\n\nI think it's a close cousin to what an accompanist does in creating a live score for a silent film. The real-time involvement with the motion picture is engrossing, absorbing, and satisfying in a way that transcends cinema as a passive activity.\n\nAt Mostly Lost, the screenings take place in the Packard Center's comfy and well-appointed theater. No conference room atmosphere here, folks—it's one case in which I can see my federal tax dollars put to good use. (Actually, the whole Packard Center is like that. We'll see how I feel next April 15, though.)\n\nSessions are broken into chunks of roughly 90 minutes each, and follow a definite pattern.\n\nAt first, we all stare at whatever footage comes up. Then invariably, someone recognizes something—often a performer, with a comment such as \"that's the guy who played the orphanage director in Chaplin's 'The Kid,' but I don't remember his name.\n\nThen someone else remembers the guy's name, and soon the cross-referencing begins, checking cast lists against plot summaries against studio production lists, all online in various places.\n\nSo it's like a crossword puzzle. Often, if you get one solid answer, you can fill in many other things based on that. And before you know it, the formerly unknown film now is now reconnected with its name, production date, studio, cast, and so much else.\n\nChief organizers Rob Stone and Rachel Parker.\n\nAt this year's Mostly Lost, selections ran the gamut from \"Unidentified Auto Comedy\" to \"1917 Crime Melodrama.\" The Saturday session I attended included American films in prints from the Netherlands that sported Dutch intertitles that no one could really translate in real time. \"GOUD IS LOKKEND EN MACHTIG,\" anyone?\n\nStill, almost all the films were positively identified via records of their original U.S. release.\n\nAnd even if what's on screen isn't entertaining, usually the commentary is. Few things are funnier than a room full of film experts watching footage of an unidentified travelogue from Verona, Italy that consists entirely of long sustained shots in which absolutely nothing moves.\n\n\"I think I can see the ivy growing!\" shouts accompanist Phil Carli, part of a chorus of increasingly irate comments.\n\nSpeaking of which: nearly all the fragments are from the silent era, meaning the festival's three accompanists were kept busy. Carli was joined at the keyboard by Ben Model and Andrew Simpson, who took turns, swapping out for each film. They're among the best in the field, and one of the delights of the festival is hearing them create accompaniment for fragments of film they've never seen before, sometimes while also shouting out their own suggestions.\n\nPhil, it seems, has an encyclopedic knowledge of vintage autos, which comes in handy. Absent other clues, the shape of a car's running board can sometimes pinpoint when a film was (or was not) produced.\n\nIf someone has a lot to say about something on-screen, the person is handed one of the wireless microphones and allowed to talk freely. That happened to me during another travelogue, which came to us identified only as scenes from Switzerland.\n\nWhen the footage screened, I was surprised to recognize scenes of the Landwasser Viaduct, a landmark structure on the mountain railway that links Chur with St. Moritz high in the Alps. Just last year, I had ridden on and photographed this line, and immediately knew what it was.\n\nThe iconic stone viaduct soars over a deep gorge before plunging into a tunnel in the side of a vertiginous cliff face. The line as a whole is famous because of how it loops around and on top of itself several times to gain altitude as it climbs up the narrow valley. It looks a model railroad layout, but in real life!\n\nAccompanist Ben Model snapped this pic of the Swiss travelogue during Mostly Lost.\n\nSo I started spouting off—and the next thing I know, I'm holding one of the wireless microphones and I'm narrating a vintage travelogue about Switzerland, drawing upon my arcane fixation with railroads as well as my half-assed knowledge of the mountain culture of my wife's people.\n\nAnd when that failed me, I resorted to stand-up, even though I was sitting down.\n\n\"Here we see scenes of an Alpine logging operation,\" I remarked. \"If this had been a sound film, right now you would undoubtedly be hearing plenty of yodeling.\"\n\nAccompanist Phil Carli immediately obliged by shifting the music into a bumptious folk idiom, topping it off with a scrap of melody from the well-known theme song to the \"Swedish Chef\" of Muppets fame, for which he apologized even before he'd finished playing the phrase. Wow!\n\n'Mostly Lost' is a chance to catch up with folks such as film experts Bruce Lawton and Eric Grayson, seen here enjoying mostly lunch.\n\nAs the day progressed, I expected to get a little antsy as the grind of fragments wore on. But that never happened. Instead, time flew, with each piece of film bringing the possibly of discovering something special or unknown.\n\nThe atmosphere was buoyed, I think, by the energy of all that film nerd power in one place, and all focused on a single shared task. Think of it: Some of these people had been preparing 40 years or more for this moment!\n\nPlus, special presentations throughout the event broke things up. The day I was there, film buff Jim Kerkoff presented \"Visiting Roach Royalty,\" a delightful account of his efforts to track down living ex-employees of Hal Roach studios during visits to the Los Angeles area back in the 1980s.\n\nThings were taken up a notch for public events in the evenings, for which \"Mostly Lost\" moved from the Packard to the marvelous State Theatre in downtown Culpeper.\n\nThe night I was there saw the U.S. East Coast premiere of the newly discovered and restored 'Sherlock Holmes' feature film from 1916.\n\nThe audience gathers prior to the 'Sherlock' screening.\n\nRestoration lead Robert Byrne (president of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival) delivered a well-illustrated presentation of what it took to rehab the single print discovered last year in the archives of the Cinémathèque Française.\n\nThen the lights went down, and we watched the film, with great live piano accompaniment from Phil Carli.\n\nA scene from the long-lost 1916 feature film 'Sherlock Holmes,' in which actor William Gillette played the role he made famous on the stage.\n\nAnd as it played out on the screen before us, I found myself marveling at how fortunate we were to be able to see a film considered lost for nearly a century. And yet here it was, with nary a scene missing and looking pretty darn good for a 1916 Essanay feature.\n\nSo if I had to comment on anything, it might be the festival's name. With so much footage being identified, and with marquee attractions such as the newly restored 'Sherlock,' maybe it should really be called something else: 'Mostly FOUND.'\n\nComing up: two chances to see 'Wings' (1927)\n\non the big screen, in a theater, with live music\n\nWarplanes menace the apparently enormous head of Clara Bow in this vintage movie poster.\n\n'Wings' is all about biplanes, so perhaps it's fitting that in the next two weeks, I'll be accompanying two separate screenings in two different states.\n\nWhaddaya know? A pair of 'Wings!'\n\nFirst up: the Flying Monkey Theatre in Plymouth, N.H. on Thursday, June 11. Then, a week later, it's the Leavitt Theatre in Ogunquit, Maine.\n\nBoth venues have movie theater roots dating back to the silent era, so it's possible 'Wings' played at either (or both) in its original release.\n\nBut if you missed it in 1927, you have two chances to catch it this month. Hope to see you there!\n\nIf you'd like more info, below is the press release that went out for the Flying Monkey show this week. I'll update it with the Leavitt's press release info after the Plymouth show.\n\nKeep 'em flying!\n\nAn original poster for 'Wings' (1927).\n\n* * *\n\nMONDAY, MAY 25, 2015 / FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContact Jeff Rapsis • (603) 236-9237 • jeffrapsis@gmail.com\n\nEpic silent film 'Wings' (1927) to be shown on Thursday, June 11 at Flying Monkey\n\nSprawling story of U.S. aviators in World War I won first-ever 'Best Picture'; to be screened with live musical accompaniment\n\nPLYMOUTH, N.H.—Silent film with live music returns to the Flying Monkey with 'Wings' (1927), an epic adventure set in World War I that won 'Best Picture' honors at the very first Academy Awards ceremony. 'Wings' will be revived for one showing only on Thursday, June 11 at 6:30 p.m.\n\nThe screening will allow audiences to experience silent film the way its makers originally intended: on the big screen, with live music, and with an audience.\n\n'Wings,' a blockbuster hit in its original release, recounts the adventures of U.S. pilots flying combat missions behind enemy lines at the height of World War I in Europe. 'Wings' stunned audiences with its aerial dogfight footage, vivid and realistic battle scenes, and dramatic love-triangle plot.\n\nThe screening of 'Wings' will feature live accompaniment by Jeff Rapsis, a New England-based composer who specializes in creating music for silent film presentations. Admission is $10 per person.\n\nBuddy Rogers and Clara Bow in 'Wings' (1927).\n\n'Wings' stars Clara Bow, Charles 'Buddy' Rogers, and Richard Arlen. The rarely-seen film also marked one of the first screen appearances of Gary Cooper, who plays a supporting role. Directed by William Wellman, 'Wings' was lauded by critics for its gripping story, superb photography, and technical innovations.\n\n'Wings' is notable as one of the first Hollywood films to take audiences directly into battlefield trenches and vividly depict combat action. Aviation buffs will also enjoy 'Wings' as the film is filled with scenes of vintage aircraft from the early days of flight.\n\nSeen today, the film also allows contemporary audiences a window into the era of World War I, which was underway in Europe a century ago. The U.S. entered the war in 1917.\n\n\" 'Wings' is not only a terrific movie, but seeing it on the big screen is also a great chance to appreciate what earlier generations of servicemen and women endured,\" accompanist Jeff Rapsis said. \"It's a war that has faded somewhat from our collective consciousness, but it defined life in the United States for a big chunk of the 20th century. This film captures how World War I affected the nation, and also shows in detail what it was like to serve one's country a century ago.\"\n\nRapsis, a composer who specializes in film music, will create a score for 'Wings' on the spot, improvising the music as the movie unfolds to enhance the on-screen action as well as respond to audience reactions. Rapsis performs the music on a digital synthesizer, which is capable of producing a wide range of theatre organ and orchestral textures.\n\n\"Live music was an integral part of the silent film experience,\" Rapsis said. \"At the time, most films weren't released with sheet music or scores. Studios relied on local musicians to come up with an effective score that was different in every theater. At its best, this approach created an energy and a connection that added a great deal to a film's impact. That's what I try to recreate,\" Rapsis said.\n\n'Wings' is about 2½ hours long and will be shown with an intermission. The film is a family-friendly drama but not suitable for very young children due to its length and intense wartime battle scenes.\n\nThe Flying Monkey originally opened as a silent film moviehouse in the 1920s, and showed first-run Hollywood films to generations of area residents until closing several years ago. The theater has since been renovated by Alex Ray, owner of the Common Man restaurants, who created a performance space that hosts a wide range of music acts.\n\nMovies of all types, however, are still a big part of the Flying Monkey's offerings, and the silent film series is a way for the theater to remain connected to its roots.\n\nThe Flying Monkey's silent film series will continue in 2015 with these upcoming titles:\n\n• Thursday, July 9, 2015, 6:30 p.m.: 'A Dog Double Feature' spotlighting silent-era canine stars Peter the Great and Rin Tin Tin. In 'The Sign of the Claw,' a police dog helps solve a crime wave. The only surviving film of Peter the Great, a popular German shepherd performer. 'The Night Cry' (1926) finds iconic dog superstar Rin Tin Tin accused of killing sheep. Can he find the real bandit and clear his name?\n\n• Thursday, Aug. 13, 2015, 6:30 p.m.: 'Grandma's Boy' (1922) starring Harold Lloyd. A ccowardly young man must learn to conquer his fears before dealing with a larger menace to his community. Riotous small town comedy that helped propel Harold Lloyd into the most popular movie comedian of the 1920s.\n\n‘Wings’ will be shown on Thursday, June 11 at 6:30 p.m. at the Flying Monkey Moviehouse and Performing Arts Center, 39 Main St., Plymouth, N.H. Admission $10 per person. For more info, call (603) 536-2551 or visit www.flyingmonkeynh.com."
