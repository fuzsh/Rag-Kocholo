        "text": "King Vidor, who gave us \"The Crowd\" and \"Hallelujah,\" has plunged his camera boldly into vital American materials in \"Our Daily Bread,\" which opened at the Rialto last night. His new work, which he wrote, produced and financed himself, is a brilliant declaration of faith in the importance of the cinema as a social instrument. In richness of conception alone, Mr. Vidor's attempt to dramatize the history of a subsistence farm for hungry and desperate men from the cities of America would deserve the attention and encouragement of intelligent film-goers. But \"Our Daily Bread\" is much more than an idea. Standing in the first rank of American film directors, Mr. Vidor has brought the full power of a fine technique and imagination to his theme. \"Our Daily Bread\" dips into profound and basic problems of our everyday life for its drama, and it emerges as a social document of amazing vitality and emotional impact.The effect of the photoplay is to bring the cinema squarely into the modern stream of socially-minded art and to lay bare for the inquisitive cameras the same fundamental dramatie themes which the young proletarian novelists like Albert Halper, Robert Cantwell and William Rollins are exploiting in the new American literature. For that reason alone it is impossible to over-estimate the significance of the new work.You may quarrel with the sentimental idealism of the ex-convict who voluntarily surrenders himself to the authorities so that his fellows may obtain the reward and save the crops from the drought. This theme, incidentally, was suggested to Mr. Vidor by Charlie Chaplin. You may quarrel with the theme of the blond-headed siren who almost wrecks the collectivist farm in her gratuitous efforts to lure the leader to destruction. This department applauds the Chaplinesque note and deplores the Theda Barish element. But \"Our Daily Bread\" is too important as a canvas to be chastised for its debatable taste in minor details of Mr. Vidor's brushwork.In its conception the drama of the collective farm and its growth as a community of the unemployed is a drama of idealism. To begin with, there are Mary and John Sims, a city couple who are crushed by the unending futility of earning a living in these sorrowful times. A Swede farmer and his family turn up in a rattletrap flivver and put the farm on its feet. Then in a steady procession come the end products of the industrial collapse—plumber, carpenter, blacksmith, stone mason, barber, merchant, shoemaker, undertaker. Yes, and ex-convict, lawyer, politician, cigar salesman, violinist, professor. It is a microcosm, a city in miniature, a skeleton society. They put up shelters and they till the land. When the Sheriff attempts to sell the farm at public auction, the community saves the day by excluding outside bidding and obtaining title to the lands for a few cents, in the manner of the Dakota farmers.It is when the drought casts its shadow of thirst and famine across the corn fields that Mr. Vidor brings his film to a triumphant climax. For here he succeeds to an unusual degree in personalizing the dread and impersonal enemy. The feverish attempt of the men to build a two-mile irrigation ditch is pictured so skillfully as to exalt the spectator and, finally, to leave him exhausted and emotionally depleted. Mr. Vidor heightens the excitement of these scenes by his employment of visual rhythm as the desperate workers, with shovel and pickaxe, dig their irrigation canal in the dry and unyielding earth. When the brackish water is at last released into the channel, it races along like a wonderful nectar. Men women and children become delirious and throw themselves into the mud, rolling in it, burying their faces in the life-giving ooze. It is a superbly managed scene and it reveals Mr. Vidor at his best.For his actors Mr. Vidor has gone to nature. Many of them he selected from the unemployed in the streets of Los Angeles, and there are excellent types among them. Karen Morley, the only well-known player in the group, acts the part of the leader's wife with fine sincerity and feeling. Tom Keene, best known to the film public as a cowboy hero, plays the leading rôle. His performance is an expression of the undying optimism of youth, and it gains in effectiveness from its apparent absence of theatrical artifice. But the actors in \"Our Human Bread\" are submerged in Mr. Vidor's theme, like the actors in the best products of the Russian cinema, which has obviously influenced this profoundly moving photoplay.\n\nOUR DAILY BREAD, written, directed and produced by King Vidor; released by United Artists.
