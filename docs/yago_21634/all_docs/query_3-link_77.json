The film stars Karen Morley, Tom Keene, Barbara Pepper, Addison Richards, Lloyd Ingraham and John Qualen. Regarded as a masterpiece, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry. The movie was essentially a sequel to an earlier film of Vidor's, THE CROWD (1928). One of the most important films from the years of the Great Depression, the film concerns a couple who leave the city and move to the country where they hope to live off the land. They find out that it's very hard indeed, but are helped by people who are their neighbors. The screenplay was written by Elizabeth Hill, and features some very early dialogue work by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. With a score by Alfred Newman. MovieArt Original Film Posters in Austin, Texas guarantees that this poster is an authentic American one-sheet poster - vintage, original. MovieArt Austin does not sell reproductions.\n\nKING VIDOR - Director\n\nKaren Morley - Actor\n\nTom Keene - Actor\n\nBarbara Pepper - Actor\n\nAddison Richards - Actor\n\nLLOYD INGRAHAM - Actor\n\nJohn Qualen - Actor"
