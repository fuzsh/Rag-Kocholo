        "text": "Welcome to the world of industrial food production and high-tech farming! To the rhythm of conveyor belts and immense machines, the film looks without commenting into the places where food is produced in Europe: monumental spaces, surreal landscapes and bizarre sounds - a cool, industrial environment which leaves little space for individualism. People, animals, crops and machines play a supporting role in the logistics of this system which provides our society’s standard of living. OUR DAILY BREAD is a wide-screen tableau of a feast which isn’t always easy to digest - and in which we all take part. A pure, meticulous and high-end film experience that enables the audience to form their own ideas.\n\nNikolaus Geyrhalter was born in Vienna, Austria in 1972. Twenty-two years later he formed his own production company: Nikolaus Geyrhalter Filmproduktion. He made his first film, EISENERZ, in 1992. Two years later, he shot his first documentary, WASHED ASHORE (1994) it is telling a story about the river Danube and often strange idiosyncrasies of the people who live along its banks. Geyrhalter’s static-camera, well-paced observational films tackle their subjects head-on, whether it’s exploring the terrain in Chernobyl, Ukraine (PRIPYAT - 1998), tracing the route of the Dakar Rally (7915 KM - 2008), or investigating the production of processed foods (OUR DAILY BREAD - 2005). In 2003 he received Austrian State Award for Film Art and in 2008 his film OUR DAILY BREAD won the Grimme Prize."
