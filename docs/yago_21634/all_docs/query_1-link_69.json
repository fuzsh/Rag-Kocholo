This experimental filmmaker also heads the production company and digital film festival called .MOV. He is the author of rock operas, novels, and poems, and he plays the piano and sings in a band called The Brockas.\n\nThe film Our Daily Bread takes place in the slums and captures a day in the life of one family that makes a living collecting garbage in the streets. Poverty is the highest degree of futility, the consummate absence of freedom."
