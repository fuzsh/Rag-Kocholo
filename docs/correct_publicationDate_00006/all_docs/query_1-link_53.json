A Near Fine copy in like dust jacket. Book with some foxing to the outer edge of the closed text block, otherwise appearing unread. Jacket with a sticker indicating that the book was autographed for University Book Store in Seattle/Bellvue.\n\nWilliam Gibson’s sci-fi classic. Not only would Neuromancer be the first book to win all three of the Nebula, Hugo, and Philip K. Dick awards, but the book is also responsible for helping to popularize the cyberpunk genre. Indeed, when Gibson saw Blade Runner—in the middle of the novel’s composition—he thought Neuromancer would receive lukewarm reviews and be viewed as a kind of rip-off, instead of the revelation it was. Much of the dialogue and cant that the work is famous for was adapted by Gibson from the street slang of the Toronto underworld, which Gibson became familiar with when he moved to Canada in the late 1960s. Neuromancer is on Time magazine’s list of the 100 best English language novels since 1923, and has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide to date. A contemporary review hailed GIbson's first novel as “[A]n amazing, virtuoso performance. Kaleidoscopic, picaresque, flashy and decadent” (Washington Post). Near Fine in Near Fine dust jacket.
