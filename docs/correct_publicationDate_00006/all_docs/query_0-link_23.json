        "text": "Item #4578\n\nNew York: Ace Science Fiction Books, 1984. 8vo, 271 pp, perfect bound in wraps. Gibson's personal\n\ncopy, with his ownership signature and ex libris designation at title page, his library blindstamp,\n\nand note in his hand which reads \"Author's personal copy June 1984\". Laid in is a folded publication\n\nannouncement. Housed in a gray cloth clamshell box with leather title label to spine.\n\nThe author's own copy of the uncorrected proof of his first novel, the cornerstone work of\n\ncyberpunk, and the first novel to win the Philip K. Dick, Hugo, and Nebula awards. An eerily\n\nprescient high point of post-war literature which each passing day becomes more relevant to our\n\nage and perhaps the next.\n\nThere are two brief numeric annotations to the foreword in Gibson's hand, and within the text\n\nthere are 16 marks in red ink, mostly vertical margin links, but also one instance of a word being\n\ncircled and one passage underlined. A comparison with the regularly published edition shows no\n\ndifferences in these annotated portions of the text when compared to the published edition, and the\n\nmeaning of these highlighted passages is unknown to us.\n\nUnique.\n\nProvenance available upon request."
