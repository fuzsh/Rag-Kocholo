        "text": "I'll have to confess that I read Neuromancer only a couple of years ago, and at the time, didn't understand what all the fuss was about. It was a book about computers, written before computers were really a thing. The strange thing about William Gibson's fantastic novel is it's staying power and how it's positively brimming with fresh ideas in a genre gone stale by the early 1980s. Going back to re-read Gibson's works (especially in Burning Chrome), I'm shocked at how vibrant and raw his writing is.\n\nNeuromancer is one of the more important books to enter the genre, and as it celebrates its third decade in print, it's an interesting one to go back and look upon and to understand just how revolutionary the title was at the time.\n\nGo read 30 Years of William Gibson's Neuromancer over on Kirkus Reviews.\n\nSources:\n\nAcross the Wounded Galaxies: Interviews with Contemporary American Science Fiction Authors, Larry McCaffrey. There's a fantastic interview with Gibson in this book, which provided some keen insights into the development of Neuromancer. It's also online here.\n\nThe History of Science Fiction, Adam Roberts. Roberts devotes several pages to Neuromancer and Gibson's influence, providing some key insights into how Neuromancer came together.\n\nModern Masters of Science Fiction: William Gibson, Gary Westfahl. This short book came out last year and is part of the fantastic Modern Masters series from the University of Illinois Press. This particular volume is excellent: it's a detailed look at Gibson's works, and a bit about his life\n\nFittingly, a number of sources came from the internet, through interviews or blog posts from Gibson:"
