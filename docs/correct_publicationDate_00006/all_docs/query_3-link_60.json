        "text": "Â\n\nOne of the most intriguing forms of technology you can find in science fiction is virtual reality. Of course, VR headsets now exist in the real world, but fiction allows authors to unleash their imaginations in the virtual realm. They can create worlds upon worlds where their characters can fight battles, build lifelong friendships, and fall in love.\n\nÂ\n\nVirtual reality uses computer-generated imagery and hardware to trick someoneâs brain into believing what they see is real, even though it isnât. Some versions of virtual reality also involve sensors that can make characters feel the virtual world as well as see and hear it.\n\nÂ\n\nThere are several books that delve into the idea of virtual reality and how it might affect society as a whole. Here are ten fantastic books that feature virtual reality.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n1) Neuromancerby William Gibson\n\nÂ\n\nCase was once the most brilliant data-thief in the matrix until he messed with the wrong people and they crippled his nervous system, banishing him from cyberspace. Now heâs been recruited by a mysterious new employer for one last jobâa run at an incredibly powerful artificial intelligence. With a dead man and Molly, a mirror-eyed street-samurai, along for the ride, Case is ready for this adventure.\n\nÂ\n\nThis 1984 book is the only novel to win the Nebula Award, the Philip K. Dick Award, and the Hugo Award. Even more impressively, it was sci-fi master William Gibsonâs debut novel and one of the first to tackle virtual reality. He created a virtual reality dataspace called the âmatrixâ years before most people had even heard of the Internet. Neuromancer is the first entry in the authorâs SprawlÂ trilogy.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n2) Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson\n\nÂ\n\nIn Los Angeles, Hiro delivers pizza to mansions for a living, defending the pies from marauders with a matched set of samurai swords when necessary. He spends most of his time goggled into the Metaverse, where he is a warrior prince. But in the club The Black Sun, his fellow hackers are being taken down by a strange new drug called Snow Crash that reduces them to a jittering cloud of bad digital karma (and a vegetative state in real life). Hiroâs investigation into the Infocalypse leads him back to the beginning of language itself, with roots in an ancient Sumerian priesthood. Y.T., a brave teenaged skateboard courier, will join him on his quest. Together, they must race to stop a malevolent virtual villain bent on world domination.\n\nÂ\n\nLike Neuromancer, this 1992 novelâs spot-on take on virtual reality is incredibly impressive. It is credited with inspiring generations of Silicon Valley innovators who still marvel at the bookâs prescient vision of what todayâs tech landscape would look like. Snow CrashÂ thins the line between virtual and physical reality in a fascinating way.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n3) Ready Player OneÂ by Ernest ClineÂ\n\nÂ\n\nBy the year 2045, reality has become a bleak place. So most people, including Wade Watts, choose to spend the vast majority of their time jacked into OASIS, an expansive virtual world. When the eccentric creator of the OASIS dies, he leaves behind a series of puzzles based on his obsession with the pop culture of the past. Whoever solves them will inherit his immense fortune and control of the OASIS itself. When Wade cracks the first clue, heâs suddenly surrounded by rivals who would kill for this prize. The only way to survive is to win.\n\nÂ\n\nThis book takes place almost entirely in the vibrant virtual world of the OASIS. The many different planets and games of the OASIS are incredibly imaginative and well-drawn. The technology used in the book is not too much further along than the VR technology we already have and makes one wonder how close we might be to this sort of future.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n4) Daemonby Daniel Suarez\n\nÂ\n\nDaemons are computer programs that run in the background and wait for a particular event or time to execute. They power almost every service and make the networked world work, but they also make it vulnerable. A previously dormant daemon activates when legendary computer game architect Matthew Sobolâs obituary appears online, which sparks a chain of events that begins to unravel the interconnected world. This daemon reads news headlines, recruits human followers, and orders assassinations. With Sobolâs secrets buried with him, itâs up to Detective Peter Sebeck to stop a self-replicating virtual killer before it realizes its ultimate purpose.\n\nÂ\n\nThis New York Times bestselling high-tech thriller paints a very frightening picture of our future. Itâs a chillingly plausible vision of what could happen if technology went awry. In the novel, there is a great deal of computer gameplay in virtual reality. The virtual world is fascinating and vividly detailed.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n5) The Three-Body ProblemÂ by Liu Cixin\n\nÂ\n\nDuring Chinaâs Cultural Revolution, someone involved with a secret military project sends signals into space and ends up making contact with aliens. These aliens are on the brink of destruction and make plans to invade Earth. Back on Earth, people form into different campsâthose who plan to welcome the superior beings and help them take over, and those who will fight against the invasion.\n\nÂ\n\nThe Three-Body ProblemÂ recently came up in our list of the best alien-centric stories as well. This Hugo Award-winning book is just such a fantastic story, with an all-encompassing view of how such an impending invasion would affect society. In the novel, a virtual reality game plays a pivotal role in explaining the nature of the aliensâ planet and how certain members of society feel about them. This is the first novel in the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy, but the whole series is frequently referred to as Three-Body.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n6) Surface DetailÂ by Iain M. Banks\n\nÂ\n\nOne of the Intagliated, Lededje Yâbreq has a marked body bearing witness to a family shame and belongs to a man with a great lust for power. Sheâs prepared to risk everything for her freedom but her release comes at a price. To put things right, she will have to help the Culture. Lededje finds herself heading into a combat zone without being sure which side the Culture is really on. A war is already raging within the digital realms that store the souls of the dead, and itâs about to erupt into reality.Â\n\nÂ\n\nSurface DetailÂ is the eighth book in Iain Banksâ CultureÂ series, but each book in the series is self-contained with new characters. This book features artificial afterlives (Heavens and Hells) that people are capable of creating with technology. There are some great virtual reality battle sequences and gut-wrenching depictions of the torment in the virtual Hells.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n7) Heir Apparent by Vivian Vande Velde\n\nÂ\n\nThere are a ton of ways to get killed in the virtual reality game Heir Apparent, and Giannine seems to be finding them all. But sheâs got to figure out a way to surviveâbecause if she dies in the game, sheâll die for real.\n\nÂ\n\nThis book is the second novel in the authorâs Rasmussem Corporation series, but as with Surface Detail, this book stands on its own. The medieval fantasy atmosphere of Heir ApparentÂ is delightful and Giannineâs race against the clock to win the game makes the story exciting. Itâs also fun to watch Giannine improve her gameplay as the story goes on.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n8) Enderâs GameÂ by Orson Scott Card\n\nÂ\n\nGovernment agencies have started to breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers in order to defend the earth from a hostile alien raceâs next attack. A brilliant young boy, Andrew âEnderâ Wiggin, is drafted into the orbiting Battle School for military training. His skills make him a leader in school and earn him respect in the Battle Room, where the children engage in mock battles in zero gravity. But still, he suffers from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from adult teachers, and fear of the alien invaders. Could Ender be the perfect general Earth needs?\n\nÂ\n\nThis novel won the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Like The Three-Body Problem, it is another novel that was also included in our list of alien-centric novels. It seems that when sci-fi writers are considering what the future might bring, quite a few think of both aliens and virtual reality technology. In Enderâs Game, the children at the Battle School run battle simulations in a shared virtual reality experience. With this 1985 novel, Orson Scott Card was able to predict how our current military uses virtual reality to train.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n9) Permutation CityÂ by Greg Egan\n\nÂ\n\nPaul Durham keeps making Copies of himselfâsoftware simulations of his brain and body that can be run in virtual reality. He wants to use them as guinea pigs for a set of experiments but they keep changing their minds and shutting themselves down. Maria Deluca is an Autoverse addict whoâs unemployed and almost out of money, but she canât stop wasting her time playing around in this virtual world. Paul asks Maria to design a seed for an entire virtual biosphere able to exist inside the Autoverse, modeled down to the molecular level. The job will pay well and will allow her to indulge her obsession. But there has to be a catch since the seed would be useless without a simulation of the Autoverse large enough to allow the resulting biosphere to growâa feat far beyond the capacity of all the computers in the world.\n\nÂ\n\nThis novel takes place in the not-too-distant future and while we probably wonât achieve the level of VR displayed here by then, if we do, I hope those involved will use Greg Eganâs work as a guidebook to implementation. He has such a clear understanding of the technology he is writing about, itâs astounding. Permutation CityÂ also tackles some ethical questions we will have to consider as we spend more and more time in virtual reality.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n10) Havenby Kate Seger\n\nÂ\n\nWhen the apocalypse happens, Lola Lovecraft is lucky enough to be able to escape into Haven, a virtual reality realm built for the purpose of saving humanity. But when Lola arrives, Haven doesnât exactly seem like the perfect world that was promised. And if Lola wants to survive in this harsh world, sheâll have to go on a quest to find and defeat the ghost in the machine.\n\nÂ\n\nIâve mentioned this story in a few of our other lists (like the ones of books and series with inventive magic systems and literary quests). Itâs just too great not to include a list it was tailor-made forâone about books featuring virtual reality. HavenÂ takes place on a virtual planeâone that, in a unique twist, is providing a literal haven for survivors of the apocalypse. This means that Lola canât just quit the game when the going gets rough. You can read the first three chapters of this story for free on Fictionate, and the entire thing for just $0.99.\n\nÂ\n\nSoak Yourself in Fiction\n\nÂ\n\nFollow us onâ¯Facebookâ¯|â¯Instagramâ¯|â¯TwitterÂ |Â Discord\n\nÂ"
