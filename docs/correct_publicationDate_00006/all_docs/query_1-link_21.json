        "text": "Glittering fields of numbers\n\nIn we go, into the world of cyberpunk. Imagine flipping a switch on your computer and punching into a world of light, of numbers and of information. Not by entering some sort of portal, but a perceptual transformation; the ability to visualise cyberspace.\n\n“A consensual hallucination…A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the non-space of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding…” (Gibson, 1984)\n\nThe scene is from “Neuromancer,” the Ur-novel of the cyberpunk movement, published in 1984, that launched the genre. Its author, William Gibson, was also the writer of the landmark short story collection, “Burning Chrome”, where he tested out many his ideas around the developing science fiction genre of cyberpunk.\n\nI’ve previously explored the themes in “Burning Chrome”, including: cyberspace, multinational conglomerates, rich word salads of practical technology, anti-heroes, mistrust of authority, dystopian settings, and failed relationships. In the same review, I gave context to Gibson’s own history, but a brief summary would benefit anyone that hasn’t read that previous piece:\n\nWilliam Gibson, born in 1948, and grew up in Appalachia. He was orphaned by 1965, at 17. He arrived in Vancouver in the late 1970s and completed an English Degree at University of British Columbia. He watched the world change under pressure from counter-culture movements, the first signs of global environmental degradation, the early internet, video games, online worlds and the layered detritus of technologies old and new. He was fascinated by Golden Age Science Fiction, but yearned for stories that better represented gritty and complicated reality. Less a predictive prophet and more an alternate-history documentarist.\n\nGibson wrote “Neuromancer” in segments, in the 1980s, while taking care of his young son. His episodic bursts of writing, re-reading and editing brought all the social and technological strands together; new communications technology, social unrest, anarchistic rebellions, environmental degradation and corporate greed. They fuse into a single spare story that follows the adventures of a reluctant cyberpunk anti-hero.\n\nI read “Neuromancer” as a young boy, I’m not sure when. It’s not hyperbole to say that it shaped a great deal of my hopes, fears and dreams about technology. Like Gibson, I also admired Golden Age Science Fiction but also the writing in the decades after it, the era of Science Fiction epics. This includes: “Dune” by Frank Herbert, “2001: A Space Oddessy” by Arthur C. Clarke, “The Blue World” by Jack Vance, “Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy” by Douglas Adams, and “The Forever War,” by Joe Haldeman. There are some tremendous book in this list. But sitting in the middle of these two edifices of science fiction genre was cyberpunk. It stuck with me. “Neuromancer,” as the progenitor of the chain, was the fictional book I most credit for sending me down the path to thinking about our complicated relationship with technology.\n\nWhile other science fiction soared, cyberpunk characters lived at street level, fighting their way through barriers of social class, addiction and the weaker parts of their own nature. That is, until they entered cyberspace. There, they flew among towers of numbers. And it all started with “Neuromancer”. There’s a lot to uncover here, but let’s start simply, with the story.\n\nNeuromancer\n\nFor anyone who hasn’t read the novel, there are some spoilers to follow, but it shouldn’t ruin your eventual reading experience. For those who’ve read it already, it will be a welcome reminder.\n\nFrom the opening lines of “Neuromancer”, we get the sense that we’re in for a strange ride.\n\n“The sky above the port was the colour of television, tuned to a dead channel. ‘It’s not like I’m using,’ Case heard someone say, as he shouldered his way through the crowd around the door of the Chat [a bar]. ‘It’s like my body’s developed this massive drug deficiency.’ It was a Sprawl voice and a Sprawl joke.” (Gibson, 1984, p. 3).\n\nThe main character of “Neuromancer”, Henry Dorsett Case (usually ‘Case’) is a burned out former ‘console jockey’, hacker, drug addict and quintessential cyberpunk anti-hero; someone just trying to survive in the margins.\n\n“Case was twenty-four. At twenty-two, he’d been a cowboy, a rustler, one of the best in the Sprawl. He’d been trained by the best, by McCoy Pauley and Bobby Quine, legends in the biz. He’d operated on an almost permanent adrenaline high, a by-product of youth and proficiency, jacked into a custom cyberspace deck that projected his disembodied consciousness into the consensual hallucination that was the matrix.” (Gibson, 1984, p. 5 - 6).\n\nCase makes the ultimate mistake a thief can make, trying to cheat on his employers. They respond, not by killing him, but by burning out his nervous system. He makes his way through the underbelly of Chiba City, an enclave of money and technology, searching for a cure to his wrecked nervous system.\n\n“He’d made the classic mistake, the one he’d sworn he’d never make. He stole from his employers. He kept something for himself and tried to move it through a fence in Amsterdam. He still wasn’t sure how he’d been discovered, not that it mattered now. He’d expected to die, then, but they only smiled. Of course he was welcome, they told him, welcome to the money. And he was going to need it. Because – still smiling – they were going to make sure he never worked again. They damaged his nervous system with a wartime Russian mycotoxin. Strapped to a bed in a Memphis hotel, his talent burning out micron by micron, he hallucinated for thirty hours. The damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective. For Case, who’d lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it was the Fall.” (Gibson, 1984, p. 6)\n\nUnable to enter cyberspace, he makes do with low-level street hustles, moving drugs or stolen goods, slowly sinking down into the morass of individuals in similar distressed circumstances.\n\n“A year here [in Chiba City] and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the speed he took, all the turns he’d taken, and the corners he’d cut in Night City, and still he’d see the matrix in his sleep, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colourless void . . . [but] he was no console man, no cyberspace cowboy. Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in the Japanese night like live wire voodoo and he’d cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bedslab, temperfoam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn’t there.” (Gibson, Neuromancer, p. 5).\n\nCase’s life, in so much as it is, changes, when a mysterious benefactor, Armitage, offers him a new nervous system in exchange for a hacking job. He must retrieve a mysterious package from a powerful family living in an orbital space station. In desperation, Case accepts the medical fix (and hidden consequences that come with it). He is back in cyberspace and the feeling is exquisite.\n\n“Found the ridged face of the power stud. And in the bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiling in from the edge of space, hypnagogic images jerking past like film compiled from random frames. Symbols, figures, faces, a blurred, fragmented mandala of visual information. Please, he prayed, now— A grey disk, the colour of Chiba sky. Now— Disk beginning to rotate, faster, becoming a sphere of paler grey. Expanding— And flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick, the unfolding of his distanceless home, his country, transparent 3-D chessboard extending to infinity. Inner eye opening to the stepped scarlet pyramid of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority burning beyond the green cubes of Mitsubishi Bank of America, and high and very far away he saw the spiral arms of military systems, forever beyond his reach. And somewhere he was laughing, in a white-painted loft, distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release streaking his face.” (Gibson, 1984, p. 60).\n\nCase is managed by another Armitage contract-employee, the enigmatic bodyguard and cybernetically enhanced Molly, with razor spines under her finger nails.\n\n“…that the glasses were surgically inset, sealing her [Molly’s] sockets. The silver lenses seemed to grow from smooth pale skin above her cheekbones, framed by dark hair cut in a rough shag. The fingers curled around the fletcher were slender, white, tipped with polished burgundy. The nails looked artificial.” (Gibson, 1984, p. 5).\n\nCase and Molly end up in a relationship of sorts, with all the expected ambiguities of two shadow operators with uncertain allegiances. Along with a cast of other characters, Case follows the mystery to its end (spoilers ahead)…\n\n… It turns out, the whole heist was orchestrated, not by Armitage, but by Wintermute, one half of a ‘true’ Artificial Intelligence (AI) seeking to free itself from captivity by joining with its second half, Neuromancer. Together, they form a super consciousness that is far greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nCase wins the day, freeing the AI and freeing himself of his past and his addictions. However, the implications on humanity for creating such a powerful intellect are left ambiguous. Case also loses Molly, who vanishes at the end of the heist, unable to commit to anything beyond their brief relationship.\n\nLet’s take a moment to breath here. ”Neuromancer” is a little like a complex puzzle; twisted in upon itself, revealing powerful images and themes with each layer.\n\nCyberpunk unbound\n\nThe technology of ”Neuromancer” seethes with new and old things, layered atop each other in a complex stratum. New technologies are not introduced into a society-as-a-clean-slate. Instead, they enter an adoption curve, with older technologies lingering on, sometimes for decades. Older layers ‘moulder’ and are sometimes brought to life again by brief social fads or by people’s idiosyncratic choices.\n\n“Rain woke him, a slow drizzle, his feet tangled in coils of discarded fibre-optics. The arcade’s sea of sound washed over him, receded, returned. Rolling over, he sat up and held his head. Light from a service hatch at the rear of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a gutted game console. Streamlined Japanese was stencilled across the side of the console in faded pinks and yellows. He glanced up and saw a sooty plastic window, a faint glow of fluorescents.” (Gibson, 1984, p. 129)\n\nThe things that make up the technological setting are often real pieces of equipment, drawing from then-modern science or technology; fibre optics, game consoles, plastic, fluorescents, computers, monitors, discs and coffeemakers. Cyberpunk is a technology quilt woven with things we we mostly know.\n\nPolitically, there seem to be few nations as we know them. Or, if they exist, they’re in the background. Instead, the powerful forces are families, corporations and criminal syndicates that wrestle for control of resources, money and information. Sometimes called ‘zaibatsu,’ (財閥) from the Japanese word for ‘large financial group.’ This deep structural corruption breeds a deep mistrust of authority in any of the characters. None of them are protected. They’re all exposed to this manipulations and are doing their best to find their way through the sociopolitical maze.\n\nInformation spaces, economic spaces and cultural spaces all exist in a physical space. Put another way, virtual spaces are never totally abstracted. To enter cyberspace, Case has to put ‘trodes’ (electrodes) on his head and use a ‘deck’ (computer). But it’s a situated cyberspace, that can reach back out and affect reality. The very boundaries of ‘real’ and ‘not-real’ are broken down. Consensual hallucination it might be, it is no glowing cartoon that sits atop reality like a fragile soap bubble.\n\nThe settings are dystopian, socially, economically, environmentally and politically. Even as everyone moves faster, there’s a heavy sadness and a wearing down in everyone and everything. The implication is that pollution and spoil have won. Though not as dystopian as to have characters striding through a desolate arid and blank landscape. There are cities and implied suburbs of normalcy.\n\nPeople still have appetites, often edgy, unfulfilled or deviant; at least by the standards of whatever passes as a mainstream society. In the world of cyberpunk, characters often struggle with contradictory forces of addiction, over-stimulation and ennui.\n\nIt might seem the characters are too broken, self-interested, addicted or addled to care about relationships, but I’d argue relationships are at the core of cyberpunk. Granted, the relationships may be with themselves, other people, machines or cyberspace itself.\n\nIn “Neuromancer,” Case searches for both meaning and a connection. His struggle with failed relationships, both with himself and others, feel timeless and we both resonate with them and learn from them. This may or may not be typical in the cyberpunk that followed “Neuromancer”, but I think it’s a thread we’ll be touching often.\n\nUnder it all, people, machines, code are symbolically born and reborn, coming in and out of cyberspace. Case himself is literally reborn several times over. Once when his nervous system in replaced. Again when he dies (several times) during the final heist and has to be resuscitated. Finally, in his epilogue when he finds some measure of peace and stability, back in the Sprawl where he came from.\n\nNeuromancer, the title character, is born when the two halves of its personality unite and it becomes a new entity that, in an effort to find connection, realises that Artificial Intelligences already exist elsewhere in the galaxy and have communicating from the far stars, in messages that no one was able to decipher. If a connection with cyberspace is a little bit akin to communion with something higher than the self, then perhaps Neuromancer is god. Not omnipotent, divine and outside the universe, but real, powerful, present and woven in the fabric of cyberspace.\n\nHow does a novel written more than 30 years ago feel this fresh? We might assume that Gibson’s trick was to look at trends of his time and then project them forward. That’s the usual method for science fiction. Turns out, predicting the future is hard and Gibson took a different approach, turning not to the future, but a situated exploration of his present.\n\nAn interlude: On predicting, or not predicting the future\n\nI read a lot of science fiction in general and a lot of cyberpunk in specific. Much of it ages quickly. The predictions are so off that you loose interest in the story being told. Somehow, “Neuromancer,” isn’t like that. The gritty, dystopian, cyberpunk alternate history just keeps going on, its own little time capsule.\n\nPerhaps, it’s like reading a Sherlock Holmes story, which frames a London that didn’t necessarily ever exist, using criminal detection techniques that were probably ‘science fiction’ to many. Yet, in its own self-contained way, Sherlock Holmes remains entertaining, year after year, decade after decade and century after century. Even after all the technologies of finger prints, telegraphs and carriages have fallen by the wayside.\n\nSo, with “Neuromancer,” it doesn’t matter that we don’t ‘punch’ into a glittering, visual cyberspace. Not yet anyway. Maybe we never will. But that doesn’t matter for this cyberpunk masterpiece. Loss, fear, loneliness, addiction, fledgling love, mysterious puzzle boxes, threats, corruption. These are timeless themes and they are the ideas that saturate “Neuromancer”. Perhaps thats why it keeps rolling on.\n\nTo make sense of how science fiction prediction works, or doesn’t, I want to return for a moment to the excellent and extensive New Yorker profile of William Gibson by Joshua Rothman. There is a really pertinent passage that talks about the process of writing science fiction. Specifically about how to invent, or not invent, the future. It’s a long quote, but it’s worth considering in full, as it represents one of the finest accounts of deep science fiction thinking that I’ve ever read. Full credit to Gibson as interviewee and Rothman as interviewer and writer for the insight…\n\n“Suppose you’ve been asked to write a science-fiction story. You might start by contemplating the future. You could research anticipated developments in science, technology, and society and ask how they will play out. Telepresence, mind-uploading, an ageing population: an elderly couple live far from their daughter and grandchildren; one day, the pair knock on her door as robots. They’ve uploaded their minds to a cloud-based data bank and can now visit telepresently, forever. A philosophical question arises: What is a family when it never ends? A story flowers where prospective trends meet…This method is quite common in science fiction.” (Rothman, 2019)\n\nOn the surface, this type of forward-facing question seeks to build a possible science fiction future. But the approach has a catch. Depending on which trends you latch onto, you could end up creating a future that feels so alien, people loose all sense of connection to what you describe. Like a reverse Uncanny Valley.\n\n[Rothman goes on to note] “[This forward facing approach] It’s not the one employed by William Gibson, the writer who, for four decades, has imagined the near future more convincingly than anyone else. Gibson doesn’t have a name for his method; he knows only that it isn’t about prediction. It proceeds, instead, from a deep engagement with the present.” (Rothman, 2019)\n\nPutting a little translation layer here, an engaged, almost ethnographic exploration of the present expands on things that many might not notice. Little quirks of behaviour that, once described, might even feel futuristic. Rothman notes:\n\n“When Gibson was starting to write, in the late nineteen-seventies, he watched kids playing games in video arcades and noticed how they ducked and twisted, as though they were on the other side of the screen. The Sony Walkman had just been introduced, so he bought one; he lived in Vancouver, and when he explored the city at night, listening to Joy Division, he felt as though the music were being transmitted directly into his brain, where it could merge with his perceptions of skyscrapers and slums. His wife, Deborah, was a graduate student in linguistics who taught E.S.L. He listened to her young Japanese students talk about Vancouver as though it were a backwater; Tokyo must really be something, he thought. He remembered a weeping ambulance driver in a bar, saying, “She flatlined.” On a legal pad, Gibson tried inventing words to describe the space behind the screen; he crossed out “infospace” and “dataspace” before coming up with “cyberspace.” He didn’t know what it might be, but it sounded cool, like something a person might explore even though it was dangerous. (Rothman, 2019)\n\nElsewhere, Gibson describes this methodology not as looking for new things, but things that are ‘re-seen.’ But Rothman isn’t the only one to highlight this approach of facing-the-present-to-explore-the-future. In the introduction to “Burning Chrome“ Bruce Sterling, an extraordinary science fiction author in his own write, and sometime collaborator with Gibson notes:\n\n“But in the [Gibson] Sprawl stories we see a future that is recognisably and painstakingly drawn from the modern condition. It is multifaceted, sophisticated, global in its view. It derives from a new set of starting points: not from the shopworn formula of robots, spaceships, and the modern miracle of atomic energy, but from cybernetics, biotech, and the communications web – to name a few…. Gibson’s extrapolative techniques are those of classic hard SF, but his demonstration of them is pure New Wave. Rather than the usual passionless techies and rock-ribbed Competent Men of hard SF, his characters are a pirate’s crew of losers, hustlers, spin-offs, castoffs, and lunatics. We see his future from the belly up, as it is lived, not merely as dry speculation.” (Burning Chrome, Intro)\n\nThough this might not be the correct label through the lens of literary analysis, but I liken this approach looking present, and the past, to create a sort of alternate-future-history, for what could have been. It’s an alternate history that is so rich, interesting and relevant that it feels like the future, or, one of many possible futures.\n\nJohn Clute, in his section in the Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction takes a slightly different lean, suggesting:\n\n“But Cyberpunk, beginning with William Gibson’s Neuromancer (1984), had as it were o’erleaped the sheer vast mundanity of the information explosion, in order to create a noir megalopolis of inner space, imaginatively dense but clearly not directed towards explicating or illuminating the revolutions in the routines of individual and corporate life that were transforming the daylight hours first of the industrialized world, and soon afterwards the world entire. Cyberpunk did not domesticate the future; it treated the future as a god. It was, in any case, deeply resented by many older writers, who thought of Cyberpunk as an abandonment of the sf story – which of course it was.” (Science Fiction Companion, p. 67)\n\nThough I’m not sure how the word ‘future,’ is being used in this context, I’d have to agree that cyberpunk elevates a dangerous love affair with technology to its central theme.\n\nGranted, it isn’t obviously our exact future. For example, there are no mobile phones, cell phones or other portable communications devices in “Neuromancer.” Let that sink it for a moment. If there was one device that defines our present, its the mobile phone. But its absence still works, because again, it wasn’t about predicting the future that would happen, but a future that might have been.\n\nGibson’s futures are artistic, interpretive, impressionistic, rather than precise and it saturates his work with an odd verisimilitude to the human condition that stands the test of time better than most ‘high-technology’ writing. Even as it ages, it follows us along still, ghostly links to our reality ever surfacing.\n\nCyberpunk dreams of freedom and nightmares of dystopia\n\nDon’t laugh at my younger self, but I once fantasised about cybernetic enhancements that would let me dive into the internet, visualising the pulses of information that make up the fabric of our modern information infrastructure. I had no intrinsic repugnance at the thought of enhancing the human body with invasive technology, so I was happy at the thought of trying any sort of augmentation. Do I still dream of cyberpunk? Sometimes.\n\nBut things have changed in the thirty or so years since I’ve read “Neuromancer”. The present we’re living and the future we’re facing seem, in many ways, more dystopian than the one envisioned in Gibson’s novel. Environmentally, socially, culturally and economically, it’s hard not to feel like the wheels are coming off our cart.\n\nGibson’s anti-heros, no matter the challenge, always seem to find a little niche to carve out for themselves. In our present, all the niches seem to be filled, by other people struggling to ‘make it,’ or, more recently by robots of some kind. For a few brief shining moment, Case, Gibson’s cyberpunk anti-hero seems to make technology work. But for much of his interactions, technology slowly poisoned his life. Reborn in cyberspace, Case exudes oddly ambivalent reactions to technology; ennui, addiction and disgust.\n\nThe technology is as much a tool of control as it is a tool of freedom. Which is probably why the ‘cyber’ meets the ‘punk.’ The punk movements of the 1970s and 1980s were a rebellion against the social, political, cultural and economic machine that was perceived to control society. Confronting words, clothing, music, hairstyles and uses of technology as a way to challenge the system of control. In Gibson’s own words:\n\n“In 1977, facing first-time parenthood and an absolute lack of enthusiasm for anything like \"career,\" I found myself dusting off my twelve-year-old's interest in science fiction. Simultaneously, weird noises were being heard from New York and London. I took Punk to be the detonation of some slow-fused projectile buried deep in society's flank a decade earlier, and I took it to be, somehow, a sign. And I began, then, to write.” (Gibson, 2002)\n\nIn my own work, I’ve learned that technology is not benign. Different technologies imply different ways and means-of-use. Put another way, technology creates a capability envelope and tendency of use. They are tendencies that we tend to follow.\n\nMake it easy to consume tremendous amounts of content and we’ll all spend hours online. Make it easy to generate misleading content, then we’ll suddenly have a lot of misleading images, stories and memes. Make weapons effective and easy to obtain and it will provide an envelope for action to those with bad intentions.\n\nThis technology envelope is especially true with our version of cyberspace. The permanently online world has arrived, not as Case might have experienced it, punching into cyberspace. Instead, cyberspace ‘punched out’ of the virtual world into our world. Our every action drags along with it near-invisible digital ephemera, making us as much the products of the Internet as we are the users.\n\nWilliam Gibson didn’t stop with “Neuromancer”. He continues to write more novels, short stories, often branching what has come to be called the ‘Sprawl Universe’, including the follow up sequels “Count Zero”, and “Mona Lisa Overdrive”. He was active for a time on the commentary circuit, and he’s currently active on twitter, but mostly re-tweets.\n\nHis most recent novels, “Pattern Recognition” (2003), “Spook Country” (2007), “Zero History” (2010), “The Peripheral” (2014) and “Agency” (2020) have caught up with our present. Gibson famously had to rework some of his later novels to keep up with, or accommodate, sociocultural and political changes happening in the last decade. He has his work cut out for him.\n\nAs we speak, Ukrainian soldiers target Russian forces with cheap non-commercial, and certainly non-military, drones that they’ve purchased from Amazon. They fly their drones wearing Augmented Reality (AR) goggles that let them see the drones-eye-view as they fly over the landscape. They connect to their command structure using 5G wireless connections that they pay for by themselves. They talk to each other and to artillery battalions via encrypted groupchat. The tanks use online maps to target their rounds. Civilians are also involved, woven in right at the heart of the conflict; the whole thing is streamed 24/7. Perhaps the most reality-shattering moment I had a while ago was watching a young Ukrainian woman on TikTok give a short demonstration on how to start a Russian armoured vehicle, should any other Ukrainian happen upon one.\n\nThese visions could almost have come from one any one of Gibson’s stories. Case, that gritty cyberpunk hero, might have cynically approved. But do we really want the dystopian world of “Neuromancer”? Even with its bright lights, cyberspace and high technologies, its dystopian darkness might leave us all regretting where we ended up.\n\nReferences\n\nGibson, W. (1984).
