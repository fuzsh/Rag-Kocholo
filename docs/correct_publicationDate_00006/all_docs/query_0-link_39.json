        "text": "Are you you?\n\nListening to this 40 years after its conception makes your eyebrows raise from time to time thinking ah there Sims comes from or how did he predict this was coming about. I guess when you are connected to the one you know…\n\nWorth getting\n\nI’ve always wanted to read this book but I didn’t know if I would enjoy it, but I’m happy to say that I did like it, and it’s worth getting\n\nFor all cyberpunk and Blade Runner fans\n\nI really enjoyed listening to this book even though l rarely listen to fiction. After recently re-watching Blade Runner ( my absolute favorite film ), l decided to give fiction a chance and first listened to Phillip K. Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ( essential for all Blade Runner fans and highly recommended ), followed by this fantastic book. I look forward to listening to this again. I will also be listening to the other two books in Gibson's Sprawl trilogy. The narration on this is perfect for the story. Nice work Jason Flemyng!\n\nDifficult book to get through but good atmosphere\n\nThe story: I loved the cyberpunk setting, the grimy atmosphere is brilliant but I frequently found myself confused and struggling to follow that's going on. There are tons of things happening and you're presented with dermadisks here and simstims there and the book does not hold your hand very much in terms of explaining the plot. I was almost tempted to give the story three stars but I'm upgrading it to a four because I guess being dumped into a sci-fi world and left to figure it out yourself is part of the experience. Also, I bet I would get more out of it if I were to do a re-listen sometime down the line.\n\nThe narration: The narrator did an ok job, however I would have liked more variety in between the different characters. Sometimes I lost track of which character was speaking which of course might be just me and my attention span's problem. I found the narrator a little boring and dull to listen to. Also, a few times throughout the book it sounds like certain words have been overdubbed. I have no clue why that's necessary but it was distracting the few times it happened.\n\nGood AB\n\nThe voice acting was amazing.\n\nBut for some reason, found myself relistening the same chapter over and over again, even decide to go a few chapters to re read from the novle.\n\nGreat Story, a bit hard to follow at times.\n\nby the time I got to the end I didn't know if I should have been happy or depressed. But I definitely loved the book. I look forward to listening to the Jonathan Davis narrated sequels. I loved the characters here, particularly Molly. the way the book is written is a bit hard to follow, with good reason. Gibson is describing things far ahead of his time and it shows. I would skip backward 15sec pretty frequently to get a better understanding. but I really enjoyed my time with the book. I look forward to the next one.\n\nUnsuitable Audio\n\nThe audio may be unsuitable for commuters or people that can't listen to the book in complete silence.\n\nThe narrator tends to mumble a lot which is a great artistic choice and adds to the neon noir atmosphere of the book. The problem is that if you are listening to this book in any other setting than that of a quiet room you will miss most of it. If you commute on a train or in a car for example, this will be very hard to listen to.\n\nI lost track of the story many times and I finally gave up at the 2 hour mark. Maybe I will pick up this title in the future (in print so that I can enjoy it in a quiet room)."
