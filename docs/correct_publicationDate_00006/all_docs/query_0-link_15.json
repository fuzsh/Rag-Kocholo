        "text": "London: Victor Gollancz Ltd, 1984. First edition. The first hardcover edition and the first UK edition of Gibson's breakout science fiction novel, signed by the author on the title page. A Fine copy of the book, clean and unread, likely only opened once for the signing, in a Fine dust jacket with just a faint bend at the top of the front panel.\n\nWilliam Gibson’s sci-fi classic. Not only would Neuromancer be the first book to win all three of the Nebula, Hugo, and Philip K. Dick awards, but the book is also responsible for help popularizing the cyberpunk genre. (Indeed, when Gibson saw Blade Runner – in the middle of the novel’s composition – he thought Neuromancer would receive lukewarm reviews and be viewed as a kind of rip-off, instead of the revelation it was.) Much of the dialogue and cant the work is famous for was adapted by Gibson from the street slang of the Toronto underworld, which Gibson became familiar with when he moved to Canada in the late 1960s. Neuromancer is listed on Time magazine’s list of the 100 best English language novels since 1923, and has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide to date. It was Gibson's first novel. “[A]n amazing, virtuoso performance. Kaleidoscopic, picaresque, flashy and decadent…” (Contemporary Washington Post Book Review) Fine in Fine dust jacket. (Item #1665)"
