Written on a mechanical typewriter, and released in the same month the Apple Macintosh was first introduced to the general public, Neuromancer is the 1984 classic cyberpunk masterpiece by science fiction author, William Gibson.

An award-winning novel that, along with Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World, ranks as one of the twentieth centuryâs most potent visions of the future.

Think about it â two decades before things like myspace, youtube and instagram were invented â Gibson was talking about digitalization of media, digital influencers and internet celebrities, ai, corporations versus kids in bedrooms, and how decentralized media would counter the power of traditional "top-down" mainstream media.

The term "cyberspace", originally coined by Gibson himself in his 1982 short story "Burning Chrome", gets first popularized in this 1984 novel as a fusion between cybernetics and space, becoming part of today's mainstream language and culture.

The novel is currently being adapted to a 10-episode TV series streaming soon on Apple TV+, consolidating the importance and significance of Neuromancer as the absolute ground zero that paved the way for everything cyberpunk that came after it.

Directed by Graham Roland (Lost, Prison Break) and JD Dillard (Utopia), the upcoming streaming series "will follow a super-hacker named Case and with his partner Molly, a razor-girl assassin with mirrored eyes, aiming to pull a heist on a corporate dynasty with untold secrets.â

William Gibson's first novel, Neuromancer was the first fully-realized glimpse of humankindâs digital futureâa shocking vision that has challenged our assumptions about our technology and ourselves, reinvented the way we speak and think, and forever altered the landscape of our imagination.

Gibson is also the author of many other bestsellers such as Count Zero, Burning Chrome, Mona Lisa Overdrive, among other science fiction and cyberpunk literature classics.
