        "text": "Named a most-anticipated book of 2024 by NPR.org, Oprah Daily, Town & Country, The Millions, Financial Times, and more.\n\nA gripping memoir of one woman’s self-discovery inside a top Wall Street firm, and an urgent indictment of privilege, extreme wealth, and work culture\n\nWhen we meet Carrie Sun, she can’t shake the feeling that she’s wasting her life. The daughter of Chinese immigrants, Carrie excelled in school, graduated early from MIT, and climbed the corporate ladder, all in pursuit of the American dream. But at twenty-nine, she’s left her analyst job, dropped out of an MBA program, and is trapped in an unhappy engagement. So when she gets the rare opportunity to work at one of the most prestigious hedge funds in the world, she knows she can’t say no. Fourteen interviews later, she’s in.\n\nCarrie is the sole assistant to the firm’s billionaire founder. She manages his work life, becoming the right hand to an investor who can move mountains and markets with a single phone call. Eager to impress, she dives headfirst into the firm’s culture, which values return on time above all else. A luxury-laden world opens up for her, and Carrie learns that money can solve nearly everything.\n\nPlaying the game at the highest levels, amid the ultimate winners in our winner-take-all economy, Carrie soon finds her identity swallowed whole by work. With her physical and mental health deteriorating, she begins to rethink what it actually means to waste one’s life. A searing examination of our relationship to work, Carrie’s story illuminates the struggle for balance in a world of extremes: efficiency and excess, status and aspiration, power and fortune. Private Equity is a universal tale of self-invention from a dazzling new voice, daring to ask what we’re willing to sacrifice to get to the top—and what it might take to break free and leave it all behind.\n\nPrivate Equity is available now from Penguin Press in the US.\n\nIt is available now from Bloomsbury in the UK.\n\n“It’s a smart structure, and well-executed: just as Sun’s self-abnegation becomes unsustainable, her writing breaks loose. The maneuver is unusually stylish for a memoir.” —Anna Wiener, The New Yorker\n\n“A riveting, thoughtful memoir delving into questions around the psychological and physical cost of burnout and coming of age in the workplace. [Private Equity] surfaces deeper questions around what it means to be successful in America—and whether it’s actually worth it.” —Fortune\n\n“[Sun’s] awakening feels hard-won, and she captures the hollow cultishness that crept over white-collar New York in the Obama years, when Gordon Gekko types started going to SoulCycle. Indeed, the same qualities that nearly reduced her to an automaton have made her an astute, punctilious narrator.” —Harper’s Magazine\n\n“The world of private equity, as described in Carrie Sun’s memoir, brings to mind less the muscular jockeying of HBO’s Succession, and instead the quiet intensity of a Sofia Coppola film: all glittering surfaces and cagey alienation.” —The Guardian\n\n“Delicate and introspective” —The Times Literary Supplement\n\n“Sun writes clearly about the demands and privileges of the job, though this isn’t a tell-all about abuses in the industry, rather a more probing inquiry into what we deem success and the values underpinning it.” —Vogue, Best Books of 2024 So Far\n\n“If you enjoyed Succession or Industry, you’ll probably devour this memoir.” —Sunday Times\n\n“The work memoir of the year” —Harper’s Bazaar\n\n“Private Equity does for finance what The Devil Wears Prada did for fashion.” —The Times\n\n“In addition to the work culture of Wall Street, the target of its criticism is mostly what [Sun] sees as a system of inequality perpetuated by the billionaire class.” —New York Times, DealBook\n\n“There's a moment in Carrie Sun's memoir, Private Equity, when she remembers trying to answer a text for her high-pressure hedge fund job while running on the treadmill. It ended poorly . . . a good metaphor for the toll her career was taking on her life.” —NPR, Book of the Day\n\n“An enthralling memoir about self-discovery, and a look at the dark side of extreme wealth and today's work culture” —Cosmopolitan\n\n“Well-written, compelling, perceptive” —The Telegraph\n\n“The point [of Sun’s book] is to tell her story, not to teach the reader about the inner workings of a successful hedge fund. That said, she ends up doing both extremely well.” —Felix Salmon, Axios\n\n“Carrie Sun’s elegiac and eviscerating memoir, Private Equity, is a must-read . . . Her account of life inside a high-profile hedge fund makes Industry look like an episode of Paw Patrol.” —Dua Lipa’s Service95\n\n“[Sun’s] book is about career burnout and the hollowness of pursuing money, but it is also a satisfying story about a brilliant woman moving from self-doubt to self-confidence.” —Minneapolis Star Tribune\n\n“Carrie Sun’s memoir . . . might read like fiction, but it all happened to her. It’s not only a funny, revealing, and exciting read, it’s also a fascinating look inside one of the world’s most secretive and powerful industries.” —Town & Country\n\n“A penetrating but all the more necessary critique of extreme wealth and toxic work culture as [Sun] questions what it really means to waste one’s life.” —Oprah Daily\n\n“A memoir so gripping and propulsive that it reads like a thriller” —iNews\n\n“Wonderful . . . If you’re a fan of everything from Ishiguro to Michael Lewis, this book is worth checking out.” —Jay Caspian Kang, Time To Say Goodbye\n\n“Those who are in high-pressure careers or in the financial industry will find this book insightful.” —Booklist\n\n“A riveting memoir that pulls back the curtain on a world of extreme wealth . . . An insightful look at our relationship to work and what we sacrifice to get to the top” —Stylist\n\n“A superb memoir writer” —Daily Mail\n\n“Sun didn’t write the book for boardroom voyeurs. Instead, she intends it as a warning, and she hopes anyone experiencing workday burnout will read it.” —The Information\n\n“Sun’s candid memoir is at once an introspective look at one woman’s experience working for the billionaire founder of a well-known hedge fund and a frank depiction of the corporate financial industry that often favors those who are already part of the entrenched culture of wealth.” —The Washington Post\n\n“An incisive, sharp, and utterly compelling examination of her time working in one of the most prestigious hedge funds in the world” —Zibby Owens, Moms Don’t Have Time to Read Books\n\n“Though Sun’s story is personal, it’s possible to see her as a stand-in for the wider hoi polloi: whose life isn’t, in one way or another, spent in the grueling service of those with deeper pockets?” —The Rumpus"
