        "text": "Date Read:\n\nOctober 25th, 2017 – October 31th, 2017\n\nRating:\n\nFormat:\n\nAudiobook, Physical Paperback\n\nSummary:\n\nCarrie knew she should not use the terrifying power she possessed… But one night at her senior prom, Carrie was scorned and humiliated just one time too many, and in a fit of uncontrollable fury she turned her clandestine game into a weapon of horror and destruction…\n\nReview (Minor Spoilers):\n\nNow I understand why so many people love Stephen King novels. His writing is phenomenal. Granted, there were some confusing moments, especially during Sue’s daydreams and sometimes when the dated 70’s slang was used. The interjected parenthetical paragraphs often broke up trains of thought as well. However, his poetic writing style appeals to all the reader’s senses.\n\nI must warn you that this book is for ages eighteen and up only. Stephen King uses multiple racial slurs for the sake of realism. There are also instances of underaged characters’ exploring their sexualities either alone or with each other. These scenes are either purely action based and brief without any mention of physical or emotional response, or contain poetic innuendoes. There are at least three instances where Stephen King uses the exact terms of the actions. Most, if not all, of these scenes, made me slightly uncomfortable, seeing that they were written by a man, but from the female perspective. They seemed borderline pedophilic. However, I realize that he was aiming for realism. At least the scenes weren’t explicit.\n\nTrigger warnings for use of the n-word, brief antisemitism, use of a homophobic slur, bullying, sexual assault and mentions of rape, domestic violence, child abuse, and abusive zealous depictions of religion.\n\nCalling the relationships these characters form “toxic” is an understatement. Chris and Billy’s relationship was probably the worst, next to Carrie and Margaret’s. Billy slaps Chris around and treats her worse than the dirt he walks on. And yet she still stays with him! She had such high standards for the boys she dated in the past. With them, she gained status, but with Billy, her benefits are purely physical and brief. Even though Billy does her dirty work, he’s only going to bring her down and have her end up in jail.\n\nI’m glad Stephen King makes the distinction between Margaret White’s religious beliefs and other Christian denominations. This prevents readers from assuming all Christians are like her. She focuses on the negatives of the Bible, taking many things out of context. I doubt she’s ever read it all the way through, considering how much she misinterpreted. She ignores the Bible’s encouragement of congregational worship and acceptance of marital relations. Her beliefs go against the natural order of things, especially with puberty and reproduction. How could she not conclude that her “cancer of the womanly parts” was a baby, especially since it was her second pregnancy? Who filled her head with this deranged, abusive, and condemning form of “Christianity”?\n\nWhy doesn’t anyone call the police on Margaret? They all know that woman is crazy. If they can’t have her arrested for calling a teenager wearing a bikini in her own backyard “the devil’s whore”, they can lock her up for child abuse. Her parenting skills are on par with Claude Frollo.\n\nThe citizens of Chamberlain could have prevented the massacre of Prom Night. It could have ended the day the stones fell, the day Carrie got her first menstrual cycle, even the day of the prom itself. But no, those selfish idiots decided to turn the other cheek or continue to abuse the poor girl. And they paid the price for it.\n\nThis story is told through many editorial, autobiographic, and omniscient perspectives, providing a well-rounded view on Prom Night. I like the scientific approach to dissecting the telekinetic power. Stephen King takes the time to let Carrie exercise her ability and provides physical repercussions for using the telekinetic power. He also adds a side effect of the power that I only thought was possible with characters from The Lunar Chronicles: telekinesis can impose thought. Many interrogated witnesses during the White Commission reported innately knowing who Carrie was without having met her before or knowing her thoughts and feelings just by looking at her. That is incredibly creative and prevents this power from being completely one-note.\n\nI think it’s strange that the events and documents are dated five to fourteen years after the book was published. It even mentioned the original movie. Maybe the rights were sold before publishing.\n\nThis wasn’t scary to me (I cringed more at the gore in Scarlet by Marissa Meyer). Maybe I’m desensitized or sadistic. Maybe it was the poetic writing. Either way, I’m glad I got the chance to read Carrie this October."
