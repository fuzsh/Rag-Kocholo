        "text": "Stephen King: Who’s the 'King of Horror'?\n\nKnown as one of the most influential authors of all time, Stephen King , the author of \" The Shining ,\" \" The Stand ,\" \"Misery,\" and \"The Green Mile ,\" is described as the 'King of Horror' for his popular terrifying novels. With blockbuster book-to-movie adaptations like Carrie (1976), Pet Sematary (2019), and It (2017), King’s work floats among the most prestigious of literary critics.\n\nInterestingly, Stephen King has also published a number of works under the pen name Richard Bachman. This alter ego allowed King to explore different aspects of his writing style and tackle genres beyond his usual horror domain. Titles like \"The Running Man\" and \"Thinner\" showcase a different facet of King’s storytelling prowess, offering readers a broader perspective on his capabilities as a writer.\n\nKing may be a successful author with over fifty bestsellers, but he also believes all writers start out the same way: reading for inspiration. While not all of the books on his recommendation list are horror, King asserts that many of his reading choices have inspired some of his greatest works. According to King, ‘If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that.’\n\nWhether you’re a fan of King’s work , his short stories , horror stories, fantasy novels , or you’re looking for books to help inspire your own reading endeavors, take a look at the horror author’s most note-worthy book recommendations .\n\nKey points:\n\nStephen King is a notable author in the horror genre and is well-known for his out-of-the-box storylines and iconic characters. The successful writer has also expressed his fondness for reading and how making it a daily activity has proved to have a tremendous impact on his writing career.\n\nAs a horror author, Stephen King ’s favorite books are mostly fiction. They range in genres from thrillers and mysteries to political dramas and historical fiction. Some of his top book recommendations include To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, 1984 by George Orwell, Lord of the Flies by William Golding , and Ghost Story by Peter Straub .\n\nSome people have trouble finding books that appeal to their specific interests and tastes. If this sounds like you, we recommend downloading the Headway app! It is a great solution that will give you access to a broad library of book summaries from your favorite authors.\n\nWhy does Stephen King read so much?\n\nStephen King has said that he reads around 80 books every year. Think about it — that’s around two books a week! Although, that many books is considered pretty low-standard to King. Even though he claims to be capable of breezing through a book in a day or two, he still classifies himself as a slow reader. If you’re trying to catch up to the master of horror’s level of prestige, start by increasing your reading speed (WPM).\n\nIf you want to read as many (or even more!) books as Stephen King but don’t have that much free time, there’s an easy solution. Instead of reading full books, you can go for 15-minute summaries that convey the main ideas of a book. The Headway app offers thousands of book summaries to help you read more even if you don’t have a lot of free time. Try Headway today!\n\nThe Gerald’s Game author’s reading speed is almost as fast as his writing speed. With over 70 published books, Stephen King has written almost as many books as the number of years he’s been alive. More than 30 of these works have become bestsellers, and a few of them have even been created into hit films. However, with all these successful books of his own, why does Stephen King continue to read so much?\n\nWhile King is a strong believer in reading for sole enjoyment, he also finds reading to be a worthwhile activity that helps to strengthen mental tools and inspire creativity. Stephen King reads because he believes it helps him with his writing and career. As a matter of fact, one of the major pieces of advice that King offers to new writers is to read for inspiration. In his own words, ‘If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.’\n\nTo King, reading is the number one key to success in the writing field. Not only does reading provide you with key insights into what works and what doesn’t, but it also helps you become more comfortable with the process of writing. For someone who reads as much as Stephen King, it’s a wonder that he’s able to keep picking up a pen to write!\n\nStephen King’s top recommended books\n\nKing has stated, in his own words, that it would be nearly impossible to narrow down his favorite books to one list. Regardless, here are some — but certainly not all — of Stephen King’s top book recommendations.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee\n\nPublished during the Civil Rights movement, To Kill a Mockingbird has satisfied generations of readers and is considered a classic work of fiction for its outspoken values and ideas. Following the seemingly-ordinary life of a young girl named Scout in a sleepy Southern town during the Great Depression, this coming-of-age novel tells a much more brooding tale of the effects of racism and prejudice. As such, Scout and her brother Jem explore their neighborhood filled with eccentric neighbors and discover the hidden social hierarchy that exists within its corridors.\n\nAlthough the focus of the novel is on Scout, many characters in the book take large precedence in the storyline and outcome. Namely, Scout’s father, Atticus Finch, is a widowed lawyer newly appointed to represent an African-American man named Tom Robinson, who is accused of harming a Caucasian woman. As Scout and Jem watch the trial unfold, they learn dark truths about the society they live in and the people they once viewed as friendly, including teachers and fellow children at school.\n\nDuring her father’s ill-favored trial, Scout and Jem receive backlash and taunts from people who look down on Atticus for taking on an African-American individual as a defendant. Moreover, tomboy Scout must navigate a world that constantly tells her to be a lady while her brother mocks her ruthlessly for acting like a girl. Packed with insightful concepts regarding the deep-seated racism and sexism in 1930s America and beyond, Harper Lee’s debut novel is viewed as a literary masterpiece by many people who enjoy intellectual works of fiction.\n\n1984 by George Orwell\n\nDo you remember this book from your high school English class? Perhaps you even read this book as part of your middle school summer reading list. Although 1984 is a dystopian fiction novella that is popularly read by teenagers in the American school system, Stephen King finds the concepts in this book to be rich enough to satisfy his horror-loving mind. It may not deal with gore and terrifying creatures, but there’s enough suspense and frightening depictions of power and political rule in this book to classify it as horror-approved.\n\nGeorge Orwell’s written work follows the life of Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of the party which governs one of three totalitarian states, Oceania. Set in the year — you guessed it — 1984, Winston lives in a society where a menacing ruler, Big Brother, controls people’s lives in every form, right down to the way they speak, act, and think. To avoid rebellion, if anyone dares disobey the rules of the party, they must face dreadful consequences and punishment. However, Winston is frustrated by the control and lack of freedom and proposes a subtle rebellion with his lover, Julia.\n\nIn a world where freedom is abolished, thoughts are monitored, and every breath and move is analyzed, Winston must find his voice and stand up to the leaders of an oppressive state while everyone else watches. The main purpose of this book is to warn readers against the precariousness of being under the rule of a totalitarian regime. In fact, not only does it detail what could happen, it suggests that a totalitarian society is entirely possible in real life. Readers can therefore learn the importance of freedom and resisting oppression."
