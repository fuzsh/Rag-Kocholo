        "text": "Carrie is a horror novel written by Stephen King in 1974. It tells the story of Carrie White, a mousy misfit in her school, who is picked on mercilessly by classmates and ostracized for her eccentric background (her mother is a religious fanatic). Some of the students are punished, and one shows her sympathy, asking her boyfriend to take her to the prom instead; but other students want revenge and hatch a plan to humiliate her. What none of the students realize is that Carrie has the power of telekinesis. When she gets mad, she transforms from an innocent girl into a rage-filled monster, making it a prom no one will forget.\n\nIn Lost[]\n\n* Members of the Others' book club were sitting around discussing the novel when the plane crashed. Juliet stated it as her \"all-time favorite book.\" Another member of the club, Adam, disagreed, saying that it was \"by-the-numbers religious hokum-pokum\" and that Ben didn't like it. (\"A Tale of Two Cities\")\n\nA different edition of the book (not the same cover) was seen in Juliet's flashback, on Rachel's nightstand. (\"Not in Portland\") See the image here.\n\nBen read Carrie in his library for the forthcoming book club discussion and complained that he found it depressing. (\"One of Us\") This was again a different edition, the paperback edition.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nCarrie White, the eponymous heroine, attends Ewen High School. The principal of that school is named Henry Grayle (similar name to Henry Gale).\n\nIn the made-for-television version of Carrie, the role of villainous Chris Hargensen was played by Emilie de Ravin, who plays Claire in Lost.\n\nSee also[]\n\nAppearances of literary works\n\nParapsychology\n\nGothic fiction"
