        "text": "My name is Carrie Firestone and I'm a writer, teacher, and community leader. As a child, I spent a lot of time worrying about things like poverty, environmental destruction, and war. I eventually learned to channel that worry into action through teaching, storytelling, civic engagement, and project-based service work.\n\nI live in Connecticut with my husband Michael, my teen daughters, and our pit bull, Roxie. I love connecting with the world through travel, researching little pieces of fascinating history, and finding ways to inspire environmental stewardship and social justice work at the local level. I also love The Office, conga lines, hummingbirds, cold coffee, Iceland, the activist Inez Milholland, and BOOKS!\n\nFollow me:"
