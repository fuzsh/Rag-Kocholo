        "text": "GWEN IFILL:\n\nHe is the author of \"Carrie,\" \"The Shining, \"Misery,\" and so many more classic and frightening tales.\n\nIn the latest addition to the \"NewsHour\" Bookshelf, Stephen King, master of the supernatural and suspense, reflects on the art of writing and his latest novel, \"End of Watch.\"\n\nHe spoke with Jeffrey Brown recently at the National Book Festival here in Washington\n\nSTEPHEN KING:\n\nThat's a very good question.\n\nActually, no. I thought that the first book in the trilogy, \"Mr. Mercedes,\" would be the only book. And I kind of didn't want to let the characters go, the main characters. So I had an idea for another book, and realized when I was working on that that I had unfinished business from the first book. So I had a nice rounded quality, the three of them.\n\nSTEPHEN KING:\n\nThere is a novelist called Thomas Williams, who's passed on now, and he said that the idea for a novel is like a little tiny fire in a dark night. And, one by one, the characters come and stand around it and warm their hands.\n\nAnd I have always thought that's the perfect metaphor for how it works.\n\nSTEPHEN KING:\n\nIt is.\n\nHere's an example of that. There's a character in \"Mr. Mercedes,\" the first book of the Hodges Trilogy, a woman named Holly Gibney. And as far as I was concerned, she was just going to be a walk-on character. She's going to come on. She's going to be a little neurotic, and there is going to be some discussion with him. And then she was going to disappear from view, a minor character.\n\nAnd, instead, she came in and took over the whole book. And I let her because that's what needed to happen. The worst thing you can try to do is to steer the story once it gets going. You just kind of follow along and see where it goes. That's the fun.\n\nSTEPHEN KING:\n\nNot every day, but most days, it is, yes.\n\nI go where the story leads. And, sometimes, it is a little bit outrageous. And I relish that. I sort of want to be as much on the edge as I can. And I want to engage the reader. I'm an emotional writer, in the sense that I would be happy if you re-read a book for the intellectual or the mental part of it, but, the first time, I just like to reach out and grab you, pull you in.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN:\n\nYou know, another thing that struck me, again going back to the book on writing, you say: \"Let's get one thing clear right now, shall we? There is no idea dump, no central story, no island of buried bestsellers,\" which is to say that stories almost come from just out there, right? And your job is to, what, find them?\n\nSTEPHEN KING:\n\nI don't think you find them, exactly.\n\nI think what you do is, you keep your sensors open. And it's — the more that you do the job, the more you come to understand in a kind of intuitive way that you're always — you know, your radar is on. And the thing is going around and around and around. And it's not picking up any blips.\n\nAnd then something will happen, and it will click, and you will say, this is an idea for a story. And, for me, I'm usually working on something, so that's kind of got to go to the end of the line. And the best thing about that is, is that the bad ideas kind of just drop out of the mix. You forget about them. The good ones stick around. So…\n\nSTEPHEN KING:\n\nIt can be learned, but I'm not sure it can be taught.\n\nIt's a self-taught kind of thing. I think the best writers are voracious readers who pick up the cadences and the feel of narration through a number of different books. And you begin by maybe copying the style of writers that really knocked you out.\n\nI mean, as a teenager, I read a lot of H.P. Lovecraft, so I wrote like H.P. Lovecraft. And in my 20s, I read a lot of Ross Macdonald and Raymond Chandler, so I wrote like those guys. But, little by little, you develop your own style.\n\nSTEPHEN KING:\n\nYes. There's a kind of self-hypnosis involved with it, too.\n\nIf you start at the same time every day — most writers have little routines they go through. I like to always stop with a couple of pages that I haven't — that are just raw copy, where I haven't touched it, I haven't tried to revise it, I haven't tried to polish it.\n\nIt's like having a little bit of a runway. The next day when you sit down, you have the comfort of saying, well, I have got a little bit here, used to be in the typewriter. Now it's in the magic box, the computer.\n\nSTEPHEN KING:\n\nYes.\n\nI say, what really scares me is Alzheimer's or premature senility, losing that ability to read and enjoy and to write. And you do it, and some days maybe aren't so good, and then some days, you really catch a wave, and it's as good as it ever was.\n\nSo, it's tough to imagine giving it up."
