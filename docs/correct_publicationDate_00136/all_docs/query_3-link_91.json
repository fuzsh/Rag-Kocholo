        "text": "Additionally, King builds his credibility with the utilization of ethos in his text in order to convince them of his argument. By appealing to the readers’ ethics, they can see how trustworthy King’s words are and then can let themselves be persuaded by his matter-of fact tone and professionalism in writing. King is a realist, which means that he almost always represents things as they really are, which profoundly helps establish his honest persona. Most of Stephen King’s writing represents more than one tenet, as his stories that he tells about his childhood and road to recovery from drug addiction and alcoholism can be seen as not only pathos, but and etho as well, as these stories help the readers to understand what kind of person he is, and how he accomplished all of his success despite a couple of major roadblocks. This is why it can be seen that King uses pathos most heavily in his writing, by telling vivid stories, etc. in order to touch upon human emotion towards human experiences/traits, while also creating a strong voice in his writing as well. The overlapping of these appeals help support the ethics and sensibility of King’s work. There are scores of times where it can be clearly identified where ethos have been used in his writing. For example, King says “I’m a slow reader, but i usually get through seventy or eighty books a year, mostly fiction. I don't read in order to study the craft; i read because i like to read.- Similarly, I don't read to study the art of fiction, but simply because I like stories-Every book you pick up has its own lesson or lessons, and quite often the bad books have more to teach than the good ones” (King, pg 145) This helps to support the idea that writing is learned through reading, and also is learned through the mistakes of other writers. There is no better way to learn than to look at a piece of writing that has some minor or even major flaws and to analyze the piece to see what the issue is, and learn from their mistake to better your own writing in the future. Another one of King’s main arguments is that no writer is perfect. There are always things that you can do to make your writing even better, no matter how small the adjustment may be. It’s a learning process\n\nThe television is a box packed with much entertainment for just about any individual. Stephen King, a graduate from the University of Maine in 1970, has written many popular novels during his life time that have, over time, been turned into motion pictures. For those who want to be writers, King bluntly states that one must read as well as write a lot. He shares that he prefers reading books, as opposed to staring at “the quacking box.” King believes and expresses that picking up a book is far more beneficial to one rather than watching television shows and does his best to try and show that. Stephen King’s rejection of the television is a step in the right direction and can lead to many discovering a passion of theirs without the distraction\n\nStephen King’s, “What Writing Is”, demonstrates his narrow-minded views on how telepathic messages are the purest aspects of reading and writing. King displays his favorite places to concentrate on his work as we all may have the one particular place to think. King compared others views by sending them a telepathic message of a rabbit with the numeral 8 on his back written in blue ink. As the group did not see the exact same characteristics everyone noticed the numeral eight for this purpose. King is trying to come across an act of telepathic messages with people who see different views but yet still notice that numeral eight. Writing is the same technique, having a nice quiet place to read and write as well as pushing imagination to the fullest\n\nThe book On writing by Stephen King talks all about King’s experiences and journeys as a writer. King let’s the reader in on his personal life to explain why he writes the way he does. The book shows his idea and style about writing. King gives much advice throughout the text to the reader, but the purpose of the novel is not so much about advice on writing. The purpose is that anyone can become successful not only in writing, but anything you put your mind to and focus on, can sculpt you to become better at the thing you want to become better at. Also that life is random and so are the ideas that are given to a writer so be patient.\n\nAmerican Author, Stephen King writes about fiction as well as horror. However “On Writing” focuses on the key tools to writing. It can be applied to writing a letter, writing a letter, an essay, a novel, a short story etc. “On Writing” is a very versatile book. King as a writer is very daring. He isn't afraid to state his opinions or be blunt. I admire King for this trait. King really sticks to his writing tips, especially the one where he says you should always write for yourself first. “When you write a story, you're telling yourself the story,” he said. “ When you rewrite your main job is taking out all the things that are not in the story” (King 57). “On Writing” can really help amateur writers to improve their writing pieces. Before\n\nThe prosperity of the publishing in late Ming China not only increased the number of imprint copies as well as created a more competitive book market, but also attracted a wider, even more broad readership. The publishers and the literati became more aware of the needs of the diverse readers, and tried to attract the late Ming readership to their fictions and stories. As one of the most influential literary works in late imperial China, Three Words Collection (三言) ,which includes three story anthologies complied by Feng Menglong, undoubtedly draws a large number of readers’ attention. Many scholars study the content of Feng Menglong’s stories, and they pay more attention to the iconoclastic views involving in the Three Words Collection (三言). Nevertheless, the literary technique that Feng Menglong used in his stories is also of great importance, and it is worthy of further examination. Through creatively utilizing a poem, lyric or quatrain as the opening, or the prologue of each story, Feng Menglong deployed aesthetic as well as material features successfully, and thus the rhetorical feature contributed to the art and uniqueness of his stories. In the following text, I will examine the significance of this literary feature, which is Feng Menglong’s special utilization of the poem or lyric as the prologue in the Three Words"
