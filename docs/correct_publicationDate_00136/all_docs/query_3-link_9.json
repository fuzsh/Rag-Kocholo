        "text": "Stephen King\n\nFind books by Stephen King (click here)\n\nFind eBooks by Stephen King (click here)\n\nFind eAudiobooks by Stephen King (click here)\n\nBest known for his horror novels, Stephen King (also using the pseudonym Richard Bachman, a more gruesome voice) writes in many genres: dark fantasy, science fiction, psychological suspense, and others. No matter the genre, his fast-paced, character-driven stories are told in conversational language and feature well-developed characters. His appealing heroes and terrible villains arise from our innermost fears into the everyday world, which becomes increasingly twisted. Whether focused on the real-world horrors of abuse or on supernatural terrors, good-vs.-evil is King‘s most common theme: The protagonist must rise to meet the challenge of the horrific. Start with: The Shining (Horror); The Gunslinger (Fantasy).\n\nGenre:Fantasy fiction; Horror\n\nCharacter:Large cast of characters; Well-developed\n\nStoryline:Character-driven; Intricately plotted\n\nPace:Fast-paced\n\nTone:Atmospheric; Creepy; Menacing; Suspenseful\n\nWriting Style:Compelling\n\nIf you like Stephen King, then here is a list of similar authors\n\n(To go to the full list in NoveList Plus, click here)\n\n1. Bachman, Richard\n\nReason: Richard Bachman is the pseudonym of Steven King, generally associated with a more gruesome narrative voice. — Jessica Zellers\n\n2. Koontz, Dean R.\n\nReason: Stephen King’s and Dean R. Koontz’s names are frequently linked as they both write in multiple, often blended genres. Like King, Koontz’s stories feature a cast of personable characters involved in fast-paced, deadly battles between good and evil. Koontz, too, writes in a variety of genres, including Horror, Fantasy, and Psychological Suspense. — Krista Biggs\n\n3. Gaiman, Neil\n\nReason: Stephen King’s fans may want to try Neil Gaiman, a fellow fantasy and horror writer who excels at the can’t-put-it-down story. Gaiman often places likeable characters in nasty situations leavened by liberal doses of humor and optimism, always with a positive slant. Gaiman also writes fantasy with very little horror. — Katherine Johnson\n\n4. Saul, John\n\nReason: Stephen King writes fast-paced stories that keep readers turning the pages as the suspense builds. Similarly, the works of John Saul are atmospheric and invoke a disturbed, creepy feeling in the reader. — Nanci Milone Hill\n\n5. Hill, Joe\n\nReason: Like father, like son. Both King and Hill blend genres, writing mostly horror that often incorporates suspense and dark fantasy tropes. Both tend to feature story lines with flawed but likable protagonists who confront their dark sides as they battle an evil supernatural being. — Becky Spratford\n\n6. Cronin, Justin\n\nReason: The compelling, descriptive prose of these authors can be disturbing, creepy, menacing, and suspenseful. Their intricately plotted tales are violent (even gruesome) and center on well-developed protagonists caught by horrifying circumstances in atmospheric American settings. Besides thrilling, they reveal thought-provoking insight into human values and follies, hopes and fears. — Matthew Ransom\n\n7. Gemmell, David\n\nReason: David Gemmell and Stephen King share a love of genre-bending fantasy starring gunslinging warrior-heroes fighting their way through an ugly future. Their worlds are action-packed, violent, and horrifying, places where bravery is everything and honor is often a luxury. — Mike Nilsson\n\n8. Auerbach, Dathan Kahn\n\nReason: Readers who appreciate Stephen King’s snappy dialogue, small-town settings, and tendency to portray childhood as a very dangerous time will savor the work of Dathan Auerbach, a King acolyte who got his start writing short-form horror on the Creepypasta website. — Autumn Winters\n\n9. Malerman, Josh\n\nReason: Known for their atmospheric yet understated prose, authors Josh Malerman and Stephen King write pulse-pounding speculative fiction novels featuring well-developed characters, unsettling violence, and gloomy suspense. Their compelling works frequently blend disturbing elements of horror, supernatural thriller, and apocalyptic fiction. — Kaitlin Conner\n\nSeries by Stephen King"
