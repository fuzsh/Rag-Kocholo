        "text": "Favorite Book to Listen to\n\nLove this book. The story is about a girl who gets even with those who have tortured her since grade school. While the punishment is excessive, it does show that all actions have consequences, even if you're a teenager. King tells the story so well, it makes me wonder if he was ever on the receiving end of the bullying. The book is read by Sissy Spacek, who some will recognize as the first actress to play Carrie. She has a great voice and is easy to listen to.\n\nWonderful and yet...\n\nI picked up this book after reading the back story of when Steven King wrote this Novel. I am not a horror fan, but this wasn't quite the needless butchering I usually hate. I am now a fan of Steven King writing. Amazing writing skill. The only grievance is the news reports. He would jump back and forth between the story and almost a panel of investigators. It made the final events anti climatic. I grunted every time the story would stop to hear a after article or police report in the middle of a scene. I didn't mind them in the beginning but they were like commercials: a few in the beginning but a ton at the end because they know you won't stop now. I would recommend it. Wonderful book. I felt a real connection to characters and events, truly a good read.\n\nGreat Thriller/Horror\n\nWould you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?\n\nYes, to all my friends who enjoy this type of book. The narrator kept things interesting, and intriguing. He absolutely kept me on my toes\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of Carrie?\n\nThe narrators infliction in telling the story. Every moment was memorable because the narrator left a lasting imprint in my mind.\n\nWhat does Sissy Spacek bring to the story that you wouldn’t experience if you just read the book?\n\nIt felt like I was listening to a thrilling story around a campfire, with infliction in tone and excitement. This would have never have been the same if I had read the book\n\nIf you could rename Carrie, what would you call it?\n\nI would not re-name Carrie, since the book is all about her and the life she led, and how she became the crazed girl in the end.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nCarrie is a girl with telekinetic powers who has been isolated from her community due to the crazy reputation of her mother. Her mother has kept her sheltered and taught her extreme religions views and opinions.\n\nAll of this made going to high school a traumatic experience for her. Especially when the torture and traumatic times seem to occur on a daily basis.\n\nEverything comes together and she finally explodes with rage, taking it out on anyone and everyone who has ever caused her pain.\n\nIt just so happens that the whole town has bullied her, so Carrie has a vendetta against a large amount of people.\n\nI'd give this book 5/5 for an classic original King horror book."
