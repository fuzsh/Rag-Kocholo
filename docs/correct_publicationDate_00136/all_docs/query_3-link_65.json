        "text": "If you’ve never heard the name Stephen King, then you must be living under a very large rock. Even if you’ve never read any of his books, you should know his name.\n\nHe’s the mastermind behind “It,” “Carrie,” “The Shining” and “Under the Dome.” No, I’ve not read any of those aforementioned books, but I plan to at some point in time.\n\nNow, I’m reading his books that make me happy, one in which spark my interest and keep me reading.\n\nDoing so has helped me realize he’s one of my favorite writers in the world. Here’s why he’s one of my favorite writers:\n\nHe Writes What He Pleases\n\nKing is mostly known for penning horror novels. He has also written a slew of other genres too. These include:\n\nFantasy: The Dark Tower\n\nHistory: 11/22/63\n\nCrime: The Outsider\n\nShort Stories: Just After Sunset\n\nWhen King writes, he follows his muse. He writes whatever he wants to write or is thinking about at any given time. This then has allowed him to reach audiences of all kinds, not just in the horror genre."
