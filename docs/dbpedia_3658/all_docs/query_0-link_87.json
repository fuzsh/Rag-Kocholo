        "text": "On his way to work, he calls to see his bank manager, Roberts, who listens to his promotion story, but warns not to count on anything and meanwhile practise some economies.\n\nAt the factory, foreman and local shop secretary Ron Banks demands some guarantees from Max that the forthcoming takeover will not mean redundancies and Max promises to take this up with Henry Somes.\n\nSomes is discussing the takeover with his son David, an army friend of Max's who had arranged Max's job here. Garlands, the takeover firm, are actually demanding Max should go, but David defends Max, adding that it was Max himself who had introduced Garlands to them. Somes promises to do his best, but a takeover that benefits everybody cannot be jeopardised for one man's sake.\n\nOver a pub lunch Max tries unsuccessfully to pump David over his future, but back in his office Max telephones Muriel to say that there's a meeting at 5.30 after which she can expect good news. Muriel has to phone back with the bad news that Lucy has had an accident in the school gym, can he come home at once? Afraid to miss Somes, Max puts Muriel off, and her icy response confirms his fear that he has made the wrong decision.\n\nDavid has been trying without much success, to land a job for Max among his friends. At the 5.30 meeting, Max explains Ron's fears regarding the future under the new dispensation and receives guarded assurances from Somes. As to Max's own future, there's only prevarication and David is forced to admit Garlands want him out. Max is shocked and outraged, the more so when he is offered a job as manager of a subsidiary firm in Perth Australia. There's no common ground, and Max ends up reproaching David for not warning him in advance. Consider the Perth job seriously, is David's recommendation.\n\nMax meets Ron in the pub and is surprised by the universally enthusiastic reaction to the Perth offer.\n\nWhen he gets home, Muriel is incensed by his lack of concern for Lucy, had she been his child... He offers to accompany her to hospital to see Lucy. But when she is told of the Perth job, she rebuffs him at once. If he won't travel thirty miles on her behalf, she will certainly won't go half way round the world for him.\n\n2. The Two-Legged Chameleon (Jan 11th 1968) also with Diana Beevers as Gwen, Norman Rossington, Douglas Livingstone, Richard Leech, Michael Graham-Cox, Timothy Carlton, Anne de Vigier, Zuleika Robson, Frank Dracott, Maurice Quick and Alan Casley. Script: Julian Bond. Director: Michael Lindsay-Hogg.\n\nFollowing her accident, Lucy has been a hospital outpatient. Max and Muriel meet her when she is discharged, and Max promises to celebrate by taking them both to Chessington Zoo at half term. After Lucy has caught her bus, Max and Muriel revert to their customary strained relationship. She's not prepared to let him forget his faux pas and accuses him of trying to con Lucy.\n\nAt the factory, Max notices two of the men from Garlands snooping around. He and his secretary Gwen settle down to an unaccustomed sandwich lunch in their office. He tries to explain the complexities of his long standing affair with Muriel and the fact that he is still married to Sally. He feels he could not possibly go to Australia to take up his new job without Muriel or Lucy. But the enterprising Gwen has been checking up on other possible vacancies for her boss, one for a personnel officer.\n\nAt home that evening, there's a letter waiting for Max from Sally, the constant barrier between Max and Muriel. Max admits he'll be unable to take them to Chessington tomorrow, that brings on a fresh complaint from Muriel that she and Lucy are always last on his list of priorities. When she tells Lucy, she's disconcerted by her daughter's disenchanted assessment of them.\n\nMax can't go as he's got an interview with a Mayfair management consultant. Interviewers Bellamy, Feathers and Hoare expose Max's weaknesses thus confirming him in his pessimism.\n\nMuriel has phoned the office and discovered Max hadn't come clean over cancelling the Chessington trip. She goes there alone with Lucy. Max goes to join them there, surprised he has been shortlisted for the post. He tells all and Muriel apologises for her earlier suspicions. After an enjoyable time, the day ends happily. Back home, Muriel shows Max the birthday present for Sally that he invariably would otherwise forget.\n\nNext day Max gets behind and is going to be late for his next interview. Gwen offers to drive him, making it clear she'd be prepared to come with him to Australia if he fails to land this job. Max meets his prospective employer Dick Bush on the roof of his building. This man is ruthless and direct, deliberately provoking Max, but the job is Max's. When Gwen is informed, she is dismayed, having lost the chance to go down under, and feeling a fool for betraying her emotions. Max feels embarrassed and clumsy over the incident.\n\nLater he tells Muriel he has accepted Bush's offer of a job at a lower figure than his current income and with limited prospects, for her sake. Muriel insists he turns the offer down. She also tells him he ought to have squashed Gwen's hopes, of being incapable of seeing one relationship through, of playing one against the other. Lucy breaks into their row, making an intense appeal on her own behalf. It ends with Muriel agreeing to go to Australia, but on her terms. He must divorce Sally and put an end to his blurred relationships with \"suffering secretaries.\" It's an ultimatum. He reflects on whatever happened to love\n\n3.

Director: Alan Clarke.\n\nMax buys a birthday present for Sally hoping that will persuade her to give him a divorce. Muriel is certain it'll fail. A young man named Simon Houlder prevents Max from going in to Sally's house. The impasse is only broken when Sally drives up, accompanied by her ex-nursemaid Edie.\n\nWhen she takes Max inside, he finds his gift compares very poorly with her other presents. One is from admirer Simon, she admits she enjoys his attentions. Already aware of his unpropitious start, Max invites himself to dinner, hoping for a chance to prove his case. Also present will be his children, Clare who is met at the station, she has a special affection for her father, as exclusive of that between son Michael and his mother.\n\nVainly Max tries to re-establish himself as head of the family over lunch. He is also unsuccessful in getting on more friendly terms with Michael, and, an afternoon out rejected, Max takes an afternoon nap. As he searches Sally's room, he is shocked to find evidence of her relationship with an Oliver Anson. When he returns downstairs, he finds Sally flirting with Simon. Max is put in his place, she says she has every right to do what she likes in her own home. That's just what ruined the marriage in the first place, retorts Max.\n\nEjected, Max lands in the local churchyard and reviews what has happened. He has achieved nothing of what he had intended. He decides to pocket his pride and go back to Sally's. She does accept his apology, but also rejects his invitation to dinner. But she changes her mind when she finds that Oliver has let her down.\n\nThe meal begins well since the head waiter recognises Max. Sally meets Max half way and they dance, enjoying an unfamiliar intimacy. The ice is really broken when they see the comic side of their situation. So when he sees Sally home, Max claims he has missed his last train home, and is invited to stay, sleeping in Michael's bed. He decides not to phone Muriel. But he does see Sally in her room, to discuss the divorce. The entire Australia question depends on her. Softened, she believes Max is inviting her to accompany him down under. Max hasn't the heart to disillusion her, and takes the line of least resistance. They make love.\n\nIn the morning, he returns to Muriel, with his courage screwed up to explain his absence. But he is astonished to discover Muriel has cleared her things out and gone. There's a note, but guessing its contents, Max doesn't bother to read it\n\n4 Got Yourself Sorted Out At All? (Jan 25th 1968) also with Jean Harvey, Charles Tingwell, Clive Morton, Maxine Audley, Maurice Hedley, Nora Swinburne, Diana Beevers, Gabrielle Blunt, Penny Darrell, Athene Fielding, and Richard Cornish. Script: Julian Bond. Director: Alan Clarke.\n\nSomes resents what he sees as Max's equivocal attitude to the Australia offer and he suspects him of disloyalty. But David defends him, disapproving of his father's scheming to make use of Max if he should take the job.\n\nSally's parents, Mr and Mrs Prentice urge Sally to have nothing more to do with Max, alarmed when they hear about Max's offer to take her down under.\n\nIn the pub, Max describes to Shirley his difficulties in persuading his family to agree to go to Australia. David joins them and apologises again for what has happened with Max's current job. Max fills David in on his current personal problems, Muriel's ultimatum and disappearance, and Sally misunderstanding, thinking he wants her to accompany him.\n\nIn the office, Gwen holds Sally off, as per her boss' orders, and locates Muriel. Against her friend Miss Cardew's advice, Muriel meets Max in a teashop. Make your mind up about Sally and the job, then she'll consider coming back to him. But is Max finding he quite likes the unaccustomed freedom?\n\nMax is offered a job by a Mrs Alcon, which he turns down, but as she is in the same furniture business, she asks him for a quotation for some furniture. Another job is mooted to him, but why this sudden interest in him? Gwen suggests it's down to David, the least he can do in the circumstances.\n\nSomes wants to know Max's decision. But he won't be rushed into accepting the Australia job as Somes wants. But then taken off guard, when Sally phones, he accepts a dinner date with her. He castigates Gwen for not protecting him from her, and that upsets Gwen. Mrs Alcon accepts Max's quote, and Max apologises to Gwen and she joins David and him in the pub for a celebratory drink. But David makes it clear he's not behind these job offers.\n\nThe meeting with Sally also includes her parents, there for moral support. The whole thing is a disaster, the Prentices united in their mutual detestation of Max. Max retorts by claiming they had tried to buy him for Sally when she was \"on the shelf.\" It turns out Prentice is behind those offers, bent on trying to keep Sally in England. Max comes clean and tells them that he never wanted her to go to Australia, all he wants is divorce. He is disconcerted to see Sally is relieved rather than shocked, she'd never really wanted to go to Australia at all. But she refuses point blank to consider divorce, she cannot face a public humiliation on top of her private grief. Since there is no point arguing further, Max leaves empty handed\n\n5 It All Looks Different Through a Custard Cream (Feb 1st 1968) also with Wilfred Pickles, Michael Turner, Daphne Slater, David Bird, Diana Beevers, Michael Lees, Christopher Witty, Brian Anderson and Ronald Falk. Script: Douglas Livingstone. Director: Alastair Reid.\n\nBill Harlow is an important customer whom Max entertains in the pub. He's also Australian, and urges Max to join him for a weekend's drinking. But Max can't as he has to attend his father's retirement party in Dorset. He is Sam Osborne, a widower, who retired four weeks ago, and is resentful that his employers the Wessex Cider Company have held the party over to coincide with the retirement of Richard Parker, his brother in law and managing director. Max's sister Anthea, a widow, keeps house for Sam, and the pair have settled into a joyless routine.\n\nOn the way down Max meets Ted Harvey, the firm's sales manager, who's making for the same party. The two conceal their mutual dislike, but Max is shocked to learn that Ted is staying at Sam's, since he happens to be friendly with Anthea. When they get there, Sam cuts through Anthea's plans and assures Ted that he'd be more comfortable in a local hotel. Anthea is hardly pleased and she urges Max to take their father with him to Australia: she's been looking after him for the past eighteen years, now it's his turn.\n\nAt the party at the Wessex Company, Parker is discussing the firm's future with his successor Minton. Anthea has to apologise for Max's disruptive appearance and Sam is getting steadily drunker. Thus when Parker announces Sam is to make a speech, there's only an incoherent mumbling and he leaves. Max follows him to Sam's old office. Sam says he'd always hated this job, the Parkers had forced him into it when they'd found their daughter was expecting Anthea. Though astonished at first, he gladly accepts Max's offer to go with him to Australia.\n\nMax meets his son Michael at a restaurant. He wants to go to university at Cambridge and has no desire to join them.\n\nAnthea and Ted attempt to revive their former intimacy, but just as he is persuading her to come to his hotel, Max interrupts. When Ted leaves, Anthea refuses to fall in with the trip to Australia. She doesn't want to be housekeeper again. She meets Ted at the hotel, but soon realises he's more concerned with safeguarding his own position with his employers than with her. Anthea tries him out over whether she ought to go down under, and when he is enthusiastic, her fears are confirmed. So she tells Sam and Max she will go with them\n\n6 Uncle Richard Knows Better Than You (Feb 8th 1968) also with Wilfred Pickles, Michael Turner, Daphne Slater, David Bird, Diana Beevers, Lucy Appleby, Roger Brierley, Malcolm Douglas and George Betton. Script: Douglas Livingstone. Director: Alastair Reid.\n\nSam and Anthea see Max off at the station. He feels rushed by Sam's single-minded enthusiasm for the whole venture, and nagged by Anthea's exuberance. Sam has already arranged for house agent Harman to sell his house, even though Anthea is more cautious, urging to wait until plans have been finalised.\n\nBack at work, Max is upset that the firm have refused to pay for his family's fares to Australia, and anticipating this, Gwen has some information on assisted passages. Anyway, Sam offers to help with the money.\n\nClare is Max's daughter. She attends a convent school. She's keen to go with them until she hears Sam and Anthea will be looking after her. After all, she hasn't seen them for eight years. So Max sets up a meeting in a London fish restaurant. Sam forces the pace with some jokes, and when Anthea and Clare discover a mutual interest in tennis, it seems the ice is breaking. However Sam is getting drunk and Clare becomes embarrassed, especially when Max tries to establish a close relationship with her. It's an unsatisfactory time and as Max and Anthea bid farewell to Sam at Waterloo station, they try to lift the gloom. For Clare has already left them, saying she has a headache. Sam has insisted Anthea stay in town to check their plans at Australia House. When the train has departed, she demands Max give a definite decision about Australia. On the train, Sam gets drunk and steps out of the train thinking it has stopped at a station. He suffers a heart attack and ends up in a coma.\n\nWhen Max gets down to Sam in Dorset, his uncle Richard Parker and Ted are already there. They visit him in hospital, he's not likely to recover. Ted takes his chance and urges Anthea to stay in England, that annoys Max who tells Ted to leave Anthea alone. Max is furious everyone is assuming the worst for Sam. He berates Parker for forcing his father into a job he did not like. Parker points out the Sam is no better than a drunkard, no use at his job and should have been sacked years ago. Max storms out.\n\nSam does die. Anthea thinks it was suicide, blaming Max on his unthinking optimism and his assumption they'd all love Australia. That meeting with Clare, Sam knew had been doomed to failure. Anthea says she hates Max, all his life he's always taken, and given nothing in return but disappointment. She's going back to Ted.\n\nMax phones Clare but can't bring himself to tell her of Sam's death\n\n7 The Dream Time (Feb 15th 1968) also with Thorley Waters, Maurice Hedley, Terence Brady, June Jago, Noel Hood, Carmen Munro, Harry Hutchinson, Tom Criddle, Gabrielle Drake, David Dandas and Frederick Shrecker.

Wilfred sympathises, he's living on a legacy that lasts as long as he remains a bachelor. The pair visit the shop, Max horrified to find Rose is still there, a middleaged slattern. Disconcerted by the grotesque anti-climax, he determines to find Lydia again.\n\nOver tea, Max relates how he had been forced into marrying Sally, somehow he'd never got round to marrying Lydia. Prompted by Wilfred, Max goes to the office where Lydia used to work, but a Miss Waller is uncooperative, even claiming noone by the name of Lydia had ever worked here. So he leaves frustrated, and encounters Anna, an African student, whose idealistic hopes contrast sharply with his own sense of failure. She is proud of the fact that she's the first woman from her country to study in England. She plans to start a hospital for women in her country and Max wishes her luck. It recalls his own time at university when he'd been \"free.\" That was more important than the actual degree he took, he reflects. Now money is all important, but then it had mattered very little. Wilfred holds a party for his Oxford cronies, who all seem to be middle aged and seedy. One is called Robin, who has a young man Roy in tow and when he talks to him, Max is shocked to find Roy brackets him with Wilfred's generation and age group. Roy is in fact the son of his former friend Garland. It's also clear Max is quite out of fashion with pop music these days. Roy's girl friend Penny has found out that Lydia is now living in London.\n\nThe party over, Max is despondent over the fact that he is middle aged and hasn't achieved anything. The dream time in Oxford had been his only happy time, but now he wonders whether even this was an illusion, the entire experience remembered as a fantasy, no relation to the truth\n\n8 Which Side Are You On? (Feb 22nd 1968) also with Charles Tingwell, Clive Morton, Frederick Jaeger, Douglas Livingstone, Aubrey Richards, Denise Buckley, Mary Hignett, Gabrielle Blunt, Godfrey James, Henry Stamper and Shivendra Sinha. Script: Roy Russell. Director: Gareth Davies.\n\nSomes and David fear a Go Slow at the factory could ruin the firm, but Ron Banks the shop steward is convinced all will be well when the rich company Garlands take them over. Ron proposes leaving negotiations in Max's hands, but by now Somes is doubting Max's reliability.\n\nMax is now back at back after Sam's funeral. He has a temporary secretary in Sandie Turner, who is most efficient. He blames the dispute on Somes who has arbitrarily moved six men without any consultation, as four are Pakistanis there's some suggestion of colour prejudice. Max meets with Ron Banks and they do agree on the principle of joint consultation. But Max strenuously denies Ron's insinuation that because Max is leaving he is only interested in himself. He's always kept his word in the past, Max claims.\n\nIn the pub, David lets Max understand that if the dispute could be resolved quickly, it would be noticed by Garlands, to mutual benefit, but resenting what sounds like a bribe, Max insists he always does the best he can anyway.\n\nWhen Max probes the causes of the dispute with Ron Banks further, he discovers that the fear of victimisation is the root. When Garlands take over, the men will not have Max there to protect them. The representative of Garlands, Noel Smedley, aged 48, is of the view that Max can have no love for Garlands and David too believes Max is taking the men's side. Max however claims his past negotiation successes have always depended on his being utterly impartial.\n\nSmedley affirms to Somes and David that Garlands will not countenance taking over an unprofitable firm, and that the transfer of all six men must stand. Max puts the men's side, that they fear Garlands might tear down the factory and erect a new office block. The men down tools. Max proposes that the local union officer Wilkinson be brought in, but the men refuse. Alongside the sympathetic Sandie, Max watches Smedley and Somes failing to attract the attention of the strikers, and he tells Sandie to put Wilkinson in the picture.\n\nMax is asked to quieten the noisy rabble, and does so. Smedley interprets this as a sign of Max's one sided sympathies, but takes his chance and continues addressing the men, only to be met by more resentment and heckling. Wilkinson sends Gregson, not a conciliator at all and Somes blames Max for introducing him into the dispute. But the men go back to work, Gregson however demanding that the six men be reinstated within fifteen minutes or there will be a walk out. He sees the issue as a test case against the big business interests for which Garlands stands. Poor Max can see that his old friendly methods of negotiating no longer apply. When he relays Gregson's ultimatum, Max finds himself blamed for bringing Gregson in. Inefficient and disployal Max is. Outside the factory Max meets one of the six, Askew, who feels guilty about it all. Max admits the affair is out of his hands and drowns his sorrows in the pub with Sandie\n\n9 You Know Who Your Friends Are (Feb 29th 1968). Cast as well as George Cole were Charles Tingwell, Clive Morton, Frederick Jaeger, Douglas Livingstone, Aubrey Richards, Denise Buckley, Mary Hignett, Gabrielle Blunt, Godfrey James, Henry Stamper and Shivendra Sinha. Script: Roy Russell. Director: Gareth Davies.\n\nDeadlock at the factory after a week of dispute. Banks and Gregson blames Max, believing him to be concerned only with his own future. Somes and David have agreed to call on Smedley at Garlands' luxurious city offices, blaming them for the firm's verge of collapse. Smedley offers a way out, that the takeover should be accepted at a lower price. This Somes and David flatly reject.\n\nAt the local working men's club Gregson warns the men they could be in for a hard time. One, Ken Bartlett, believes Max ought to have been given a better chance to act.\n\nBanks fails to persuade David to reinstate Max, thinking he is not really interested in solving the dispute. David is evidently attracted to Sandie and arranges a weekend in Brighton with her.\n\nMax holds a clandestine meeting in the pub with Jim Askew, one of the six sacked workers. Max bravely asks Jim to risk abuse from his fellow workers and reapply for his job. Next morning Jim runs the gauntlet of the picket line, and is met at the gates by Max. To everyone Max announces he will sign Jim on when the strike is over. Gregson and Banks question Jim closely over his change of heart.\n\nSomes and David blame Garlands for sacking the men in Max's absence. With Smedley, they consider ways out of the impasse. It is agreed to give Max a free hand for twenty four hours, and Smedley gracefully agrees to keep out of his way.\n\nThe status quo is restored. At a meeting scheduled for 4pm, Gregson warns Banks not to let his distrust of Max jeopardise negotiations. The meeting takes place in Somes' office. Max tells everyone that the key figure in the dispute Jim Askew, is on a week's leave, and that another man is willing to take on the job he had refused to do. Both sides accept this, and to joint consultation in the future. Further the factory will remain a factory.\n\nSandie congratulates Max on success, in turn he thanks her for her encouragement. She doesn't tell him about David and he is bewildered by her lack of warmth.\n\nSmedley thanks Max, coolly, for his efforts. Max finds that by settling the strike he has ruined himself. Had it continued the take over would have failed and he would still be in a job.\n\nMax meets with Gregson who is bleakly contemptuous of his shattered illusions. Neither side is grateful to Max, who now learns that the men are even blaming him for their wages lost during the strike\n\n10 Someone I Knew (Mar 7th 1968) also with Isabel Dean, Hugh Cross, John Hallam, Margot Boyd, Rosemary Rogers, Ernest Hare and Michael Sheard. Script: Julian Bond. Director: Bill Bain.\n\n\"Max drives to Southend in a hired car and joins a funeral party in the local cemetery. Among the mourners are Lydia Laing, 40, and Frank Meredith, 45. Although utterly unprepared for Max's visit, Lydia turns to him instinctively afterwards, allowing him to drive her away from her well intentioned friends and relations. Sitting in the car near the beach, she tells Max how she has spent the past eighteen years looking after her mother, until her death, so fulfilling a promise to her father on his deathbed. Lydia had always disliked her mother for the way she had subtly punished her father for being a failure during his lifetime, and afterwards had hypocritically pretended he had been perfect. Lydia is astonished at the ease with which she is confiding in Max, and in a pub he admits his journey here had been prompted by reading about her mother's death. He now gives her a partial picture of his own life, his marriage and family and his limited success as a personnel officer.\n\nLydia has forgotten her friends, who may be anxious on her behalf. It is twenty years since she and Max last met and she eagerly accepts his invitation to lunch. Max, pleasantly excited, wonders how long it will be before this relationship goes sour too.\n\nIn the restaurant they nostalgically recall the intimacies, delights and disasters, of their youth shared at Oxford twenty years ago. A picnic expedition to the Perch Inn which had begun romantically but ended in Max's falling in the water, a symbol of his later life. An occasion when Lydia had felt at one with Max, but he had failed to respond to her mood. Max's short lived venture into business on his own when he had invested and lost his little capital. They agree that reality had tarnished the brilliance of many of their contemporaries, that they are failures themselves.\n\nBreaking the mood, they make an absurd show of enjoying themselves by going to the pier amusement arcade, trying all its attractions and ending in hysterical laughter. They speculate on their possible fate had they got married, as Max had wanted. Lydia consoles herself with the idea that she has been engaged for five years to Frank, but it is not a passionate relationship. Lydia invites him home to tea.\n\nAt Lydia's Victorian home they share tea and toast like students and re-enact their first meeting. Lydia is suddenly distressed by regret for the past, but refuses to let Max comfort her. She insists they are too late and too old and she does not want a further meeting. He now tells her the truth about himself: that he and Sally are separated and only married because she refuses a divorce. Max insists that he and Lydia were genuinely in love once before and they have a chance now to put the mistakes of the past right. Insisting he needs her, Max enlarges on his own troubles with Sally, Muriel and his job. He is unprepared for Lydia's outraged response. She points out she would have welcomed him at any other time but now, when he is merely looking for a support. She believes he sees her as his last resort and accuses him of tricking her with his nostalgic talk about the past. Now, as she is asking Max to go, Frank calls. He greets Max warmly and thanks him for taking care of Lydia at a critical moment. After Max has left, she dismisses him to Frank as 'someone she knew,' but Frank guesses there had been a special relationship.\n\nAccepting the end of another dream, Max sets off home in the hired car.\"\n\n11 Never Mind How We Got Here- Where Are We? (Mar 14th 1968) also with Jean Harvey, Peter Barkworth, Basil Henson, Shelagh Fraser, Christopher Witty, Lucy Appleby, Bruce Robinson, Reg Peters and Ralph Ball. Script: Julian Bond. Director: Alan Clarke.\n\n\"When Max goes to his bank to cash a cheque, he is asked to see the manager Mr Roberts, who is anxious to know what economies Max is preparing to make. Max tells him about the Australia offer and immediately Roberts becomes more affable and promises considerable financial help if Max takes the job. Max thanks him, explains that if he can get a divorce from his wife, he will certainly take the job, and promises to look in the following day and discuss details.\n\nMax meets Sally in Cambridge, where she has gone with Michael, who is having interviews for a place at the university. Max is horrified when he discovers that Oliver Manson, whom he knows to be a close friend of Sally's is staying at the same hotel. That evening Sally comes to Max's room with a bottle of champagne and tells him she is prepared to give him a divorce. Max is furious that she has got himself and Manson under the same roof to discuss the matter and refuses to agree to a divorce.\n\nOver breakfast the following morning, Max and Sally continue to row and she finally storms out of the dining room closely followed by Manson. A moment later, Michael comes in and Max tells him that he is not prepared to divorce Sally and let another man look after his children. Michael seems unperturbed and announces at the end of the meal that he passed his interview.\n\nMax returns to the bank and tells Roberts that he is unlikely to go to Australia after all. Roberts' attitude changes abruptly and he warns Max that he will have to straighten his affairs quickly. Max goes to see Clare, and tells her that he has decided to go to Australia without her. She is surprised as mother had written to her saying that she had finished with Oliver Manson. Max is equally surprised to hear this, and wonders what the devil Sally is playing at.\n\nMax goes to Manson's house and receives a chilly reception. Finally Manson admits that he had just been away on holiday with Sally and at the end of it she told him that she did not want after all to marry him. Max goes to Sally's house and tells her that he knows that she is finished with Manson and so why does she want a divorce? Sally explains that she feels that at last she has grown up and can stand on her own two feet. She has not given Max a divorce before, in case she needed him back. Now she feels that she can live happily alone. Max agrees that they should do the decent thing. He agrees to the divorce and they part for ever.\"\n\n12 If Only Wishing Could End As Loving (Mar 21st 1968) also with Norman Rossington, Garfield Morgan, Andree Evans, Ann Rye, George Tovey, Jean Driant, Gilles Milinaire, Colin Maitland, Robert Sessions, Harry Tierney, David Billa, Maria Gray, Billy McComb, Gilles Dattas, Sylvie Dattas, Jacques Cey, Michael Faure and Ann Heffernan. Script: Julian Bond. Director: Michael Lindsay-Hogg.\n\n\"In the street, Max is intercepted by Bush, who would like to employ him. Bush admits he had underrated Max before, but that he had been impressed by his handling of the Garland crisis. Now he would like an early response to his offer, but Max insists he must first resolve his personal domestic problems.\n\nHe calls for Muriel at Dawson's flat, but hears she has gone to attend Lucy's school play. After hearing that Sally has offered Max a divorce at last, and admitting their mutual dislike, Dawson urges Max to make a special gesture now towards Muriel at this critical time.\n\nMuriel has arrived at Victoria to board The Golden Arrow and is joined by Max at the last minute. He refuses to be drawn, claiming that the surprise expedition is purely for pleasure, and Muriel is satisfied. She is further pleased by their hotel at the Pas de Calais, but outside the cold wind disperses some of their romantic feelings. That evening, as they are coming down for dinner, Muriel is dismayed to meet a fellow teacher, Heather, who is staying at the same hotel with her friend Ian. There is no room for dissembling. Both couples are engaged in illicit affairs. Recognising the risk to their vulnerable new relationships, Max rushes Muriel out to a restaurant, rather than make up a foursome suggested by Ian.\n\nThe restaurant proves disappointing and Max is disgusted with the food, wine and service, and further irritated by a boisterous wedding party. Muriel agrees that the meeting with Heather has ruined the occasion for them. Max erupts at the waiter, refusing to tip him, and then marches over to the wedding party who are amusing themselves at his expense. He relents at the last moment, seeing the pathetic young bride, and leaves abruptly. He and Muriel go to an amusement arcade, but fail to lift the feeling of gloom. Forced into a corner, Max explains his motive in coming here, that Sally is offering a divorce. He had taken Dawson's advice that he should make a big splash, and he has spent the whole evening trying to establish the right moment to ask Muriel to marry him. Muriel is touched by his confession, and a new tender mood is generated.\n\nGoing on to a nightclub, they are put out by the arrival of Ian and Heather, but now Muriel feels herself secure enough to cope with them. All four agree that the dinners served at both hotel and restaurant had been bad. Heather, clearly anxious and inexperienced, begs Muriel not to desert her. Ian, self appointed 'life and soul of the party,' embarks on a series of dirty stories. Both Ian and Max are agreed on an evening of hard drinking. Muriel persuades Max to act as the cabaret conjuror's stooge, but afterwards, with his suit ruined, he recalls bitterly how Sally too used to enjoy making him appear a buffoon.\n\nLater at the club, Max and Ian are getting on well together, reminiscing and establishing mutual acquaintances, and ignoring the women. In a drunken schoolboy mood, they decide to help the cabaret stripper take her clothes off. They are forced to beat a retreat from the restive French audience, leaving the embarrassed Muriel and Heather to pay the bill.\n\nHaving got back to the hotel, Max passes out, leaving Muriel hurt and angry. He wakes in the morning, at a disadvantage, to find Muriel dressed and packing. Defending his last night's conduct, he points out that he was coerced into stooging for the conjuror, but Muriel suggests it was really the shock of having his marriage proposal accepted that had made him get drunk. Muriel insists that they both face the truth: that the only thing they have in common is sexual attraction, and their affair only continued because Sally had happened to find it out. Max, realising how he has cheated everybody, ascribes his character defect to his public school upbringing. Piying him, and seeing him as a baby, Muriel knows their marriage would certainly fail. Miserable and desperate they return to London on The Golden Arrow and part on the platform making a clean break.\""
