The meeting was, I believe,\n\na success. We got some good work\n\ndone, as you can see from the minutes\n\npublished on pages 10-14 in this edition\n\nof Mechanical Music.\n\nThe real star of this experience was\n\nthe setting for our meeting. It was held\n\nat the Musical Instruments Museum in\n\nPhoenix, in conjunction with a meeting\n\nof our Southern California Chapter.\n\nMBSI has had an association with\n\nthe MIM almost since the museumÕs\n\nbeginnings. We provided a modest\n\nmonetary contribution at that time.\n\nThus, our name appears on the large\n\nwall plaque seen in the accompanying\n\npictures. We have had instruments\n\nfrom our collection on display in their\n\nMechanical Music gallery for several\n\nyears. Hundreds of people are introduced\n\nto mechanical music in that\n\ngallery every week. The instrument\n\nloan agreement was just extended,\n\nas Trustee Wayne Finger notes in his\n\narticle in this issue on pages 16-17.\n\nI donÕt think it is hyperbole to say\n\nthat the MIM is just spectacular. There\n\nare about 4,000 musical instruments\n\nfrom the simplest to the most complex\n\nfrom all around the world on display in\n\nthe public galleries. Some were used\n\nby celebrities we would all recognize.\n\nSome are sophisticated, but many\n\nare humble instruments people have\n\nmade out of whatever was at hand\n\nwherever they were just to have music\n\nin their lives over the years. They are\n\ndisplayed in a very professional way\n\nin a number of galleries devoted to\n\ndifferent parts of the world; Europe,\n\nAfrica, Asia, North America, Canada,\n\nLatin America, etc. Visitors are\n\nprovided with a headset to wear and\n\nwhen they walk up to display tableaus\n\nthey begin to hear music being played\n\non the instruments by the people who\n\nused them. Many instrument displays\n\nMBSI Vice President Tom Kuehn (left) and MBSI President Clay Witt point out the\n\nsocietyÕs name on the Musical Instrument MuseumÕs wall of major contributors\n\nA close up of the societyÕs name on display on the MIMÕs wall.\n\nalso have accompanying video kiosks\n\nshowing the instruments in use. I\n\nwould urge you to put a visit to MIM\n\non your Òbucket listÓ and set aside at\n\nleast two days to do it justice.\n\nI suspect many of our members\n\ndo not realize it, but one of the more\n\nimportant things we do is loan instruments\n\nto museums like the MIM and\n\nsimilar institutions to display. This\n\nis an important public service and\n\nit is a way to spread the word about\n\nmechanical music. This is one way\n\nto keep the passion for our beloved\n\nhobby alive. New people cannot come\n\nto know and love mechanical music\n\nunless they are exposed to it.\n\nThis gives me a segue into another\n\ntopic. Did you know that MBSI has an\n\nEndowment Fund? Its stated purpose\n\nis: Òto financially assist MBSI projects\n\nand/or programs which will have a\n\nlasting impact on the preservation and/\n\nor presentation of automatic musical\n\nPRESIDENT | See Page 6\n\nEndowment Committee Report Endowment Committee Report\n\nWhat is the MBSI Endowment Fund?\n\nBy Ed Kozak\n\nThe Trustees of The Musical Box\n\nSociety International (MBSI) established\n\nan endowment fund to be used\n\nexclusively for the benefit of special\n\nprojects or programs approved by the\n\nMBSI Board of Trustees.\n\nNo part of this fund is to be distributed\n\nfor the general operation of\n\nMBSI. The Trustees may distribute\n\nmoney from the fund in the form of\n\ngrants or loans to MBSI chapters for\n\nprojects and/or programs which will\n\nhave a lasting impact on the preservation\n\nand/or presentation of automatic\n\nmusical instruments; projects and/or\n\nprograms of historical or scholarly\n\nmerit; and other projects and/or\n\nPRESIDENT | From Page 5\n\ninstruments; projects and/or programs\n\nof particular historical or scholarly\n\nmerit; and other projects and/or programs\n\nas approved by the MBSI Board\n\nof Trustees.Ó One example is the large\n\npublic exhibit that MBSI mounted at\n\nthe Orlando Science Center several\n\nyears ago. Small projects that get\n\nprograms as approved by the MBSI\n\nBoard of Trustees.\n\nThe Endowment Fund is held separate\n\nand apart from other MBSI funds.\n\nUp to 67 percent of the accrued interest\n\nearned on the fundÕs principal can\n\nbe distributed for projects or programs\n\nbut the remaining 33 percent interest\n\nand the original principal amount of\n\nthe fund cannot be spent, thus ensuring\n\ncontinued growth of the fund.\n\nLoans of available accumulated\n\nincome must be secured, with a promissory\n\nnote drafted that establishes a\n\nreasonable interest rate and payment\n\nschedule.\n\nApplicable programs or projects can\n\nbe submitted to the Board of Trustees\n\nfor consideration.\n\nmechanical music before the public\n\ncan be good too, like the recent efforts\n\nof an individual society member who\n\ntook some instruments to demonstrate\n\nfor a school class. Projects can be\n\nlarge or mall or anywhere inbetween.\n\nYou often see good examples here in\n\nMechanical Music in reports from our\n\nSpecial Exhibits Committee.\n\nIf your chapter has ideas for projects\n\nThe Musical Box Society International\n\nis a 501(c)(3) non-profit\n\norganization, which means all donations\n\nto the Endowment Fund are\n\ntax deductible. Gifts of any size are\n\nwelcome. Outright gifts in the form of\n\ncash, appreciated real estate or securities,\n\nautomatic musical instruments\n\nor other real property, art objects,\n\nbequests, life insurance, and individual\n\nretirement accounts are just some\n\nof the many ways in which you may\n\ncontribute. A gift of long term appreciated\n\nproperty could have beneficial\n\ntax implications for the donor, possibly\n\nmore tax advantageous than cash.\n\nWhen renewing your membership\n\nplease consider making a contribution\n\nto the Endowment Fund.\n\nthat need a bit of funding, all you need\n\nto do is write up a proposal telling us\n\na little about what you have in mind\n\nand the funding you need and send it to\n\nEd Kozak, our Endowment Committee\n\nchair.\n\nThe committee will evaluate the\n\nproject and send its recommendations\n\nto our trustees, who are very open to\n\ngood projects.\n\nA Lasting Legacy In order for anything\n\nonce alive to have\n\nmeaning, its effect\n\nmust remain alive in\n\neternity in some way\n\nÐ Ernest Becker, Philosopher\n\nThroughout its history, MBSI has fostered an interest in and\n\npreservation of automatic musical instruments.

ItÕs refreshing\n\nto be part of an organization made up\n\nof such intelligent, committed people\n\npursuing their passion and looking for\n\nways to preserve this hobby and share\n\nit with a younger generation.\n\nAs this issue goes to the printer, IÕm\n\nglad to report that MBSI is now part of\n\nanother program that gives something\n\nback to the world, a cleaner environment.\n\nEach time MBSI prints an issue\n\nof this magazine, an organization\n\ncalled PrintReLeaf will plant trees\n\nto replace the paper we consumed\n\ngetting these pages to you.\n\nLast issue, we printed a total of\n\n66,437 pieces of paper and PrintRe-\n\nLeaf calculated that to replace it, they\n\nwould need to plant 7.97 trees. Of\n\ncourse, you canÕt plant 0.97th of a tree,\n\nbut our fraction of a tree gets added to\n\nthe fractions of other companies doing\n\nthis same thing and ultimately enough\n\ntrees are planted to cover our paper\n\nusage. This, to me, is a great way to\n\nguarantee that we have a sustainable,\n\nlong-term supply of paper to keep\n\nprinting with. ItÕs also a great way for\n\nour organization to give back to this\n\nworld in a positive manner.\n\nYou can find the PrintReLeaf logo\n\non Page 3 of this issue. Occasionally,\n\nIÕll provide periodic updates on the\n\nnumber of trees we have planted.\n\nThe program costs the society only\n\n$90 a year, or $15 per issue to participate\n\nin, which seems to me a pretty\n\ngood value.\n\nSo, just let me say to all of you,\n\ngood job being part of an organization\n\nthat does so much to make this world\n\nsound better, look better, smell better\n\nand generally remain a great place to\n\nlive. Keep it up, and donÕt forget to\n\nsend in your stories of how mechanical\n\nmusic makes your world a better\n\nplace to be.\n\nMAILING ADDRESS\n\nMBSI Editorial/Advertising\n\n130 Coral Court\n\nPismo Beach, CA 93449\n\nEMAIL ADDRESS\n\neditor@mbsi.org\n\nPHONE\n\n(253) 228-1634\n\nWelcome new members!\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nTerri Coppens & Chris Deneau\n\nChesterfield, MI\n\nKent Williams & Romona Williams\n\nKenosha, WI\n\nGene & Monica Mock\n\nWaterford, VA\n\nGary & Marva Rasmussen\n\nMason, Ohio\n\nAlan & Kirsten Recce\n\nCarlsbad, CA\n\nRandy Donley\n\nUnion, IL\n\nMarch 2018\n\nLinda & Douglas Weidner\n\nAllentown, PA\n\nKristi & Albert Loverde\n\nSandy Springs, GA\n\nCecil Dover\n\nLos angeles, CA\n\nAndrew Coleman\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nKurt Morrison\n\nTacoma, WA\n\nSponsor: William Wineburgh\n\nTimothy Johnson\n\nKnoxville, TN\n\nWilliam & Janet Bird\n\nElyria, OH\n\nDale Koehn\n\nNorth Fort Myers, Florida\n\nTimothy Pitts & Kathleen Winkler\n\nHouston, TX\n\nRobert & Vivian Schmitt\n\nMaricopa, AZ\n\nJames Harrington\n\nMinneapolis, MN\n\nHave a suggestion?\n\nSend it in via email to editor@mbsi.org or drop us a note to the MBSI Editorial Offices at 130 Coral Court, Pismo Beach, CA 93449.\n\n8 MECHANICAL MUSIC May/June 2018\n\nSave the Date\n\nThe 2018 MBSI\n\nAnnual Meeting\n\nis coming\n\nAug. 28 – Sept. 1\n\nMAKE PLANS NOW TO JOIN US IN\n\nMeeting Sponsored by the Mid-America Chapter\n\nDETROIT\n\nMI\n\n2018 Mid-Year Trustee Meeting Minutes\n\nMBSI officers and trustees at the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, AZ. Back row, left to right: Trustee Wayne Finger, Vice\n\nPresident Tom Kuehn, President Clay Witt, Recording Secretary David Corkrum, Trustee John Bryant. Front row, left to right:\n\nTrustee Sally Craig, Trustee Mary Ann Myers, Immediate Past President Judy Caletti.\n\nPhoenix, AZ Ð Mar. 16, 2018\n\nThese minutes will be official when\n\napproved and voted on during the\n\nannual trusteeÕs meeting in 2018.\n\nThe meeting was convened at 9:07\n\na.m. Present: Clay Witt, President presiding;\n\nJudy Caletti, Tom Kuehn, Sally\n\nCraig, John Bryant, Wayne Finger, and\n\nMary Ellen Myers. (seven present of\n\nnine, a quorum). Also present: David\n\nCorkrum, recording secretary.\n\n1. The minutes of the Aug. 29, 2017\n\nTrustees meeting, held in Whippany,\n\nNJ, were published in Volume 63, issue\n\n#6 of Mechanical Music. There were\n\nno corrections, additions or deletions.\n\nTrustee Finger moved, seconded by\n\nTrustee Caletti, to approve the minutes.\n\nThe motion passed.\n\n2. President Witt presented old\n\nbusiness which is the support of\n\nthe English language version of the\n\nbook, ÒMusical Boxes of Prague and\n\nVienna.Ó In a previous meeting the\n\nboard had pledged the sum of $1,000\n\nas a contribution to the project. The\n\nMusical Box Society of Great Britain\n\n(MBSGB) had pledged 500£ (pounds).\n\nThe publisher returned with a total\n\ncost of 9,000Û (euros) of which 4,000Û\n\nwould be paid by them to cover the\n\ncost of translation. President Witt\n\nalso discussed this with the president\n\nof the Automatic Musical Instrument\n\nCollectorsÕ Association (AMICA) who\n\nindicated that he would talk to his\n\nboard about this. There has been no\n\nfurther response from AMICA.\n\nPresident Witt asked whether\n\nMBSI should increase the amount of\n\nits pledge. There was considerable\n\ndiscussion about this possible\n\nincrease.\n\nMary Pollock and Ed Cooley joined\n\nthe meeting via teleconference.\n\nThere is $6,932 in the Heintz Publication\n\nfund. Trustee Keuhn moved,\n\nseconded by Trustee Finger, to\n\nincrease the pledge amount to 2,000Û.\n\nTrustee Craig moved, seconded by\n\nTrustee Myers to amend the motion to\n\nmake the pledge amount $2,000. The\n\nmotion to amend passed.\n\nThe original motion, as amended,\n\nto increase the pledge amount to\n\n$2,000 for the English translation of\n\nthe book, ÒMusical Boxes of Prague\n\nand ViennaÓ with a further provision\n\nthat the donation be acknowledged\n\nin the translated version. The motion\n\npassed.\n\n10 MECHANICAL MUSIC May/June 2018\n\n3. The recording secretary presented\n\nthe current board actions for review.\n\n4. Trustee Kuehn presented the vice\n\npresidentÕs report. The vice president\n\noversees the awards process. The Marketing\n\nand Nominating committees did\n\nnot submit nominations for the Roehl\n\nor Mirijanian awards respectively. The\n\nPresidentÕs Award is still ongoing.\n\nThere were two nominations for the\n\nTrusteesÕ Award, one nomination for\n\nthe Bowers Publication Award from\n\nthe Publications Committee and three\n\nnominations for the Unsung Hero\n\nAward. The vice presidentÕs report\n\nwas received.\n\n5. President Witt presented the\n\nadministratorÕs report. The current\n\nmembership as of Feb. 28, 2018 is\n\n1,289. Memberships as of Dec. 31, 2017\n\nwere 1,191. For the 2017 calendar year,\n\nthere were 110 new memberships, 54\n\nof which came from the website (49\n\npercent).\n\nBecause of the voucher program,\n\nMBSI gained 13 new memberships\n\nin 2017. New member lists are sent\n\neach month to the chapter chairs,\n\ntrustees, and Membership Committee\n\ncoordinators and to the Membership\n\nCommittee chair. The gift/sponsor\n\nprogram was initiated in July 2008,\n\nresulting in 123 new members through\n\nDec. 31, 2017. Each sponsor receives\n\na ÒThank YouÓ post card and is added\n\nto the $5 discount program. Also,\n\nquestionnaires were sent to those\n\nmembers who are on the 90-days-past-\n\ndue non-renewal list. The report was\n\nreceived.\n\n6. Trustee Cooley presented the\n\nAudit Committee report.\n\nThere was discussion about goods\n\nand services. No inventory was taken\n\nlast year, and this yearÕs report gave\n\na vague indication of the amounts\n\nin some instances. This must be\n\nimproved.\n\nThe committee was tasked with\n\ncomparing the amount of money\n\nreceived from membership dues to the\n\nestimated revenue received in 2017.\n\nThe actual 2017 membership revenue\n\nwas $81,013. The estimated 2017\n\nmembership revenue was $72,039.\n\nThe difference was $8,974 or 11 percent.\n\nIt is doubtful that these numbers\n\nwould ever be the same due to when\n\nmembers pay their dues. Recommendations\n\nwere made by the committee\n\nthat would help to improve next yearÕs\n\ncomparison. Trustee Finger moved,\n\nseconded by Trustee Craig, to adopt\n\nthe recommendations by the Audit\n\nCommittee (items one through three)\n\nand include their requirements in the\n\nappropriate sections of the Policies\n\nand Procedures (P&P) to be presented\n\nfor approval at the fall meeting. The\n\nmotion passed.\n\nRob Pollock joined the meeting via\n\nteleconference.\n\n7. Marketing Committee Chair Rob\n\nPollock presented his report.\n\nProgram One: Auction Certificates.\n\nAs of 2016, there were 11 new members\n\nwith only three renewing for the\n\nfollowing years. This may lead us to\n\nreconsider the effectiveness of this\n\nprogram.\n\nProgram Two: Dealer/Restorer Certificates.\n\nNine dealers/restorers were\n\nselected from across the U.S. A total\n\nof 115 certificates were issued and\n\nonly two were redeemed.\n\nProgram Three: Advertisements\n\nfor museums. Five advertisements of\n\nvarying size have been prepared and\n\nare available in electronic form,\n\nThe committee recommends a continuation\n\nof the three programs with a\n\nfull reconsideration at the next annual\n\nmeeting.\n\nTrustee Myers asked whether it was\n\npossible to produce a brochure that\n\nwould be placed in hotels advertising\n\nthe American Treasure Tour (ATT)\n\nmuseum. She also asked whether the\n\nnumbers of visitors to the museum\n\ncould be obtained. Chair Pollock\n\nstated that this could be done, but he\n\nwould have to obtain approval from\n\nthe board for the brochure and would\n\nhave to contact the managers of ATT\n\nfor the visitor information.\n\nTrustee Craig stated that ATT did\n\nhave, at one time, advertising about\n\nMBSI on their brochure. This is no\n\nlonger being done. Perhaps they\n\ncould be approached to allow MBSI to\n\nadvertise on their brochure and MBSI\n\nwould do the same for ATT. Trustee\n\nCraig suggested that the Publications,\n\nMarketing and Museum committees\n\ncollaborate on this idea of producing\n\nan advertising brochure which incorporates\n\nadvertising for ATT or any\n\nother museum where our instruments\n\nare displayed.\n\nThe marketing report was received.\n\n8. Membership Committee Chair\n\nRob Pollock presented his report. The\n\nmembership level increased slightly\n\nfrom 2016 and 2017 counts. The number\n\nvaries by about 5 percent up and\n\ndown throughout the year. About 60\n\npercent of our lost members was due\n\nto non-renewal.\n\nSince last September, the committee\n\nhas posted nine articles, linking to\n\n10 different mechanical music videos\n\nand advertised chapter and national\n\nmeetings events on social media.\n\nThe new Student Membership level\n\nwas published on the MBSI website\n\nand will appear in future journals.\n\nA chapter leadership workshop was\n\nheld in September and the package\n\nwas requested by and shared with\n\nour sister organizations in the UK and\n\nFrance.\n\nThe Membership Committee has\n\naccepted the Marketing CommitteeÕs\n\nrecommendation to completely overhaul\n\nour welcome package and chapter\n\nwelcome procedures. The committee\n\nrecommends that our existing member\n\nbenefits should be increased by making\n\nthe Regina Certificate program free to\n\nour members (one free certificate per\n\nmembership).\n\nTrustee Finger moved, seconded\n\nby Trustee Craig to provide one free\n\nRegina Certificate for each membership.\n\nThe motion passed.\n\nPresident Witt will contact the\n\nadministrator, the editor and the party\n\nresponsible for the certificate. The\n\nmembership report was received.\n\n9. Meetings Committee Chair Tom\n\nKuehn presented his report. The\n\nAnnual Meeting schedule is as follows:\n\n¥ 2018-Mid America Chapter\n\n¥ 2019-National Capital Chapter\n\n¥ 2020-Golden Gate Chapter (joint\n\nmeeting with AMICA)\n\nMay/June 2018 MECHANICAL MUSIC 11\n\n¥ 2021-Southeast Chapter (tentative\n\njoint meeting with AMICA)\n\n¥ 2022-Lake Michigan Chapter\n\n(tentative)\n\nChair Kuehn reported that the\n\nreview and update of the Meetings\n\nManual is in progress. The goal is to\n\nhave four hard copy manuals along\n\nwith a web version and ensure that\n\neach manual is returned at the end of\n\nan annual meeting.\n\nThe 2020 joint meeting is hopefully\n\nthe first of a long-term initiative to\n\npartner with sister societies in planning\n\nand conducting annual meetings.\n\nA bi-society subcommittee has been\n\nformed and includes three members\n\neach from AMICA and MBSI. It is\n\nbelieved that this collaboration will\n\nbenefit both societies.\n\nThe video recording of workshops\n\nrequires a different approach in planning\n\nand recording these sessions.\n\nBuzz Rosa has some equipment which\n\nis owned by MBSI. Additional equipment\n\nmay need to be purchased. Chair\n\nKuehn has talked with Rich Poppe and\n\nhe has agreed to work with Buzz Rosa\n\nand one or two others to draft a plan\n\nwith the intent of implementing it at\n\nthe Detroit annual meeting.\n\nSecretary Corkrum requested\n\nthat there be an addition to the P&P\n\nregarding the trustees meeting. The\n\nrequest is that the meeting table be\n\neither round, oval or rectangular and\n\nbe able to seat 12 persons. President\n\nWitt felt that this should go in the\n\nmeetings manual and Chair Kuehn has\n\nnoted this for the manual. The report\n\nis received.\n\n10. Museum Chair Sally Craig\n\npresented her report. The Roy Beltz\n\ncollection of MBSI table favors is on\n\ndisplay at ATT as are the post cards\n\nfrom the Ralph Heintz collection.\n\nThe donation from last year is also\n\non display except for some smaller\n\npieces. Many of these pieces are good\n\ncandidates for new loans to museums.\n\nAll instruments from the Lockwood\n\nMathews Mansion museum (LMMM)\n\nhave been returned. LMMM would like\n\nto revisit a new loan from MBSI once\n\nthey have their new curator. This item\n\nremains open.\n\nChair Craig stated that the museums\n\nwhere MBSI instruments are on display\n\ninclude, Lake County Historical\n\nSociety, the Packard Museum and the\n\nCase Barlow museum, all in Ohio and\n\nthe ATT museum in Pennsylvania.\n\nChair Craig requested the following\n\nincreases in the budget; transportation\n\nto increase to $4,000; and restoration\n\nto increase to $5,000. These requests\n\nwill be presented when the treasurer\n\nmakes his report. Chair Craig stated\n\nthat the committee is always looking\n\nfor more members to join, especially\n\nthose who are in areas where MBSI\n\ncollections are on display.\n\nThe Guitarophone is still awaiting\n\nrestoration.\n\nThe report was received.\n\n11. Trustee Caletti presented the\n\nNominating Committee report of chair\n\nDan Wilson. The slate of nominations\n\nfor 2018 MBSI officers and trustees,\n\npending approval are as follows:\n\n¥ Vice President: Tom Kuehn to\n\nserve a second year of a two-year\n\nterm.\n\n¥ Trustees: John Bryant to serve a\n\nsecond four-year term.\n\n¥ Treasurer: Ed Kozak to serve\n\nanother one-year term.\n\n¥ Recording Secretary: David\n\nCorkrum to serve another\n\none-year term.\n\nAll nominees have confirmed that\n\nthey are willing to accept these positions.\n\nPer the bylaws, Clay Witt will\n\nautomatically serve a second four-year\n\nterm as trustee and Judy Caletti will\n\ncontinue as trustee until 2019.\n\nChair Wilson stated that the committee\n\nis not functioning as stated in\n\nthe bylaws. He recommends committee\n\nmembers come from four of the\n\nchapters. The members would serve\n\na two-year term with two members\n\nappointed in even years and two in\n\nodd years. The two trustees serving\n\nwould compliment the representative\n\nmembers. A rotational schedule was\n\nincluded with his report but is too\n\nlong to be printed here. President Witt\n\nmoved, seconded by Trustee Finger\n\nto approve the committeeÕs recommendation\n\nfor future make-up of the\n\ncommittee, in compliance with the\n\nbylaws and to include the Japanese\n\nchapter in the rotation. The motion\n\npassed.\n\nSecretary Corkrum stated that he\n\nwould not accept any further appointment\n\nas of the 2020 annual meeting.\n\n12. Trustee Caletti presented the\n\nPublication Committee report from\n\nchair Bob Caletti. MBSI continues to\n\nsell the books, ÒThe Music Box MakersÓ\n\nand the ÒGolden AnniversaryÓ at\n\nannual meetings. The MBSI inventory\n\nincludes 327 ÒThe Music Box MakersÓ\n\nbooks, 16 ÒGolden AnniversaryÓ\n\nbooks, several lapel pins and 100\n\nMBSI seals.\n\nChair Caletti has asked each of the\n\nPublications Committee members\n\nto write two articles per year and\n\nencourages all other society members\n\nto write articles for the journal. Even if\n\nyou donÕt think you can write one but\n\nhave some ideas, send it to the editor,\n\nbecause he can help you make it a very\n\ninteresting article, chair Caletti said.\n\nThe printer for the journal has a new\n\nprogram which MBSI will participate\n\nin. It is called PrintReLeaf. Its aim is\n\nto replant enough trees to cover our\n\nfuture printing needs. The cost is $90\n\nper year and our first print run is free.\n\nPrintReLeaf will plant eight trees in\n\nNorth Dakota for every print run and\n\nMBSI will include the PrintReLeaf\n\nlogo in its publication stating MBSI is\n\na certified participant.\n\nBecause of the large number of\n\nÒThe Music Box MakerÓ books left in\n\ninventory, Chair Caletti made a recommendation\n\nto distribute the books\n\nto chapters, museums, auction houses\n\nand even members at the Detroit\n\nannual meeting. Museums and auction\n\nhouses could sell the books and keep\n\nthe profit. Chapters could sell the\n\nbooks also. In this manner, it is hoped\n\nthat the inventory will be depleted.\n\nTrustee Finger moved, seconded by\n\nTrustee Kuehn to have the Publication\n\nCommittee dispose of this book in an\n\neconomical manner using their best\n\njudgment. The motion passed.\n\n13. Trustee Caletti presented the\n\nWeb Subcommittee report from chair\n\nRick Swaney. The student membership\n\n12 MECHANICAL MUSIC May/June 2018\n\noption has been added to the website.\n\nStudent members will receive the\n\njournal in electronic format.\n\nThe index of journal articles has\n\nbeen added to the archives section of\n\nthe website up through 2015. It will\n\nbe brought up-to-date before the 2018\n\nannual meeting. Also, the instrument\n\ngallery has doubled in size due to\n\nrecent additions, but more is needed\n\nespecially to showcase tabletop\n\ninstruments.\n\nThe website can be slow to respond\n\nto users requesting journal information.\n\nSince the server we use is shared\n\nby other websites, the committee\n\nhas decided to move the website to\n\nDreamhost. The cost is $230 over\n\nour current cost but would allow our\n\nusers a faster response time.\n\nThe website had 43,328 views in\n\n2017, averaging 600 views per month.\n\nThe committee has also created a\n\nFacebook group named Musical Box\n\nSociety Forum. It is open to everyone.\n\nThe forum will be reviewed for any\n\nunwanted content, which will be\n\nremoved. We encourage our members\n\nto use this forum, much like what they\n\ndo with MMD.\n\nThe report was received.\n\n14. Trustee Caletti presented editor\n\nRussell KasselmanÕs report. Advertising\n\nrevenue remains steady although\n\nlower than desired. Efforts are in\n\neffect to reach out to insurance agencies,\n\nmoving companies and other\n\nindustries tangential to music boxes.\n\nPrint costs remain low and MBSI is\n\nreceiving the best pricing available in\n\nthe market.\n\nContent submitted for publication\n\ncontinues to be outstanding in terms\n\nof quality. Contributors who have not\n\npublished before seem consistently\n\nhappy with their experience and often\n\nstart looking for additional pieces to\n\nwrite about. The search for new writers\n\nis always ongoing. Also, updates\n\nabout committee activities and chapter\n\nreports are also well received.\n\nThe report was received.\n\n15. Trustee Myers presented the Special\n\nExhibits report from chair Wayne\n\nMyers. The committee continues to\n\nbe active, especially in the southeast.\n\nThe Southeast and Piedmont chapters\n\nhave had events in conjunction with\n\nthe Circus ÒShow FolksÓ of Sarasota,\n\nFL, demonstrations at the Orlando\n\nScience Center, and Music Box Making\n\nfor Grandchildren held at The\n\nVillages, FL summer camp.\n\nChapters are encouraged to report\n\nabout displays or demonstrations held\n\nin their area to the Special Exhibits\n\nCommittee.\n\nThe report was received.\n\n16. President Witt reported that\n\nthe MIM has requested ÒThe Marvels\n\nof Mechanical MusicÓ DVDs from us.\n\nThe Publication Committee stated\n\nthat these can be reproduced at a cost\n\nof $5 per disc. President Witt moved,\n\nseconded by Trustee Myers, to have 50\n\ncopies of the ÒMarvels of Mechanical\n\nMusicÓ DVD reproduced at a cost not\n\nto exceed $300. The motion passed.\n\nMBSI Treasurer Ed Kozak joined the\n\nmeeting by teleconference.\n\n17. Finance Committee Chair Ed\n\nKozak presented the finance report.\n\nThe financial report received at the\n\nend of the year indicated that total\n\nfund balances increased by $6,128.\n\nMBSI fund balance is $714,443. There\n\nwas a dues revenue decline of $4,697.\n\nConvention net income was $1,580.\n\nPublishing revenue was $18,217 and\n\nexpense was $65,090. Accounting,\n\ntax preparation and administrative\n\nexpense totaled $28,771.\n\nIt was determined that the cost in\n\nexcess of par value on investments\n\npurchased was not being amortized,\n\nas an adjustment of yield on the investments.\n\nAn adjustment took place on\n\nJune 30 with appropriate monthly\n\nadjustments to follow going forward.\n\nAlso, a more accurate definition of\n\ncash equivalents is now being used.\n\nLine items will now show cash and\n\ncash equivalents, operating investments\n\nand restricted investments. The\n\nformat of the financial statements has\n\nnow been updated to include a table\n\nof contents with expanded notes to\n\nthe financial statements and supplementary\n\ninformation.\n\nTwo non-endowment certificates of\n\ndeposit (CD) matured in 2017. Funds\n\nthat were placed in money market\n\naccounts were reinvested into CDs\n\nthat continued to follow the societyÕs\n\ninvestment laddering philosophy. One\n\nCD with a maturity date of 2036 was\n\nsold because it did not follow this philosophy.\n\nA loss of $3,600 was incurred.\n\nNon-endowment CDs and money\n\nmarket deposits totaled $450,378 and\n\n$69,918 respectively as of the end of\n\nthe year. After the 2017 annual meeting,\n\nminor adjustments were made to\n\nthe 2018 budget.\n\nAn investment proposal from the\n\nsocietyÕs broker called for the purchase\n\nof a high dividend value equity\n\nfund to become a part of the societyÕs\n\nportfolio. The finance committee\n\nconsidered the proposal but did not\n\naccept it.\n\nTemporarily restricted assets total\n\n$154,985. The total of restricted cash\n\nassets and the ÒcontingencyÓ amount\n\nto $199,985. The amount of interest\n\navailable from the Endowment Fund\n\nnow stands at $30,200.\n\nPresident Witt presented some\n\nadjustments to the budget for the\n\nMuseum Committee. Treasurer Kozak\n\nnoted these adjustments and will\n\nforward a revised budget to the board.\n\nPresident Witt moved, seconded by\n\nTrustee Bryant to approve the amendments\n\nto the budget. The motion\n\npassed.\n\n18. President Witt presented an\n\namendment to clarify the meaning\n\nof the first sentence of subsection c\n\nof Article XIV, Standing Committees,\n\nSection 12. The amendment would add\n\nthe word ÒchapterÓ before the word\n\nÒchairÓ in the phrase Òtwo currently\n\nserving trustees and the chair.Ó The\n\nsentence, as amended, would read:\n\nThe members of the committee shall\n\ninclude a committee chair, the immediate\n\npast-president of the society,\n\ntwo currently serving trustees and the\n\nchapter chair, or a chapter-designated\n\nalternate, from four separate chapters.\n\nPresident Witt moved, seconded by\n\nTrustee Craig, to adopt the amendment.\n\nThe motion passed.\n\n19. President Witt presented a proposal\n\nto consolidate and update our\n\ndatabase of instruments owned by the\n\nMay/June 2018 MECHANICAL MUSIC 13\n\nsociety. This database would be kept\n\non our main server.\n\nTrustee Finger moved, seconded\n\nby Trustee Kuehn to consolidate and\n\nupdate our database of instruments\n\nat a cost of not more than $2,500. The\n\nmotion passed.\n\n20. President Witt stated that he and\n\nTrustee Craig talked with the curator\n\nof the MIM about extending the\n\ncontract with the MIM for two years.\n\nPresident Witt moved, seconded by\n\nTrustee Kuehn to extend the contract\n\nwith MIM for an additional two years.\n\nThe motion passed.\n\n21. President Witt reported that a\n\njoint MBSI/AMICA cooperation project\n\ncommittee has been formed with three\n\nmembers from each society. Their goal\n\nis to explore ways in which the two\n\norganizations can better cooperate\n\nwith each other. This would include, for\n\nexample, helping with the coordination\n\nof future joint meetings and to ensure\n\nthat separate meetings do not occur in\n\nthe same areas sequentially.\n\n22. President Witt reported that a\n\nsection of the P&P is misplaced and\n\nneeds to be moved to its proper place.\n\nSection IV, Treasurer, paragraph 4,\n\nsubsection F reads: ÒA physical inventory\n\nof sales inventory items such\n\nas books, seals, pins, etc. should be\n\nmade by the Publications Committee\n\nin early January of each year and\n\nsubmitted to the Audit Committee.\n\n(Trustees 3/04/94, Trustees Revised\n\n3/28/14, Trustees 8/29/17)Ó\n\nThis section will be moved and\n\nbecome Section XIX, Publications,\n\nsubsection I. Trustee Caletti moved,\n\nseconded by Trustee Craig to move\n\nthis section to the publications section\n\nof the P&P. The motion passed.\n\n23. Trustee Caletti moved, seconded\n\nby Trustee Myers, to adjourn the\n\nmeeting. The motion passed. Meeting\n\nadjourned at 2:30 p.m.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nDavid W.

Robert and Sharon GilsonÕs\n\ncollection is in Wisconsin. In the\n\nChicago area, there is the collection\n\nof Jasper and Marian Sanfilippo, and\n\nthen the Jim and Sherrie Krughoff\n\ncollection. I am sad to report that Jim\n\nKrughoff passed away on Feb. 20th,\n\n2018. Jim was one of those people that\n\nyou always remembered after meeting\n\nhim and a person everyone seemed\n\nto always like and respect. The hospitality\n\nof Jim and Sherrie was truly\n\nextraordinary. Jim had a great sense of\n\nhumor and an infectious enthusiasm\n\nand he will be surely missed.\n\nIn this issue of Nickel Notes IÕll\n\nprovide details of a visit I made to Jim\n\nand SherrieÕs home in Downers Grove,\n\nIL, as a way of honoring JimÕs memory.\n\nWhenever there was an MBSI or Automatic\n\nMusical Instrument CollectorsÕ\n\nAssociation (AMICA) convention\n\nin the Chicago area, the Krughoff\n\nSherrie Krughoff\n\ncollection was always on the tour. In\n\nfact, the three collections mentioned\n\nearlier were the reason so many\n\nmechanical music conventions ended\n\nup being held in the area.\n\nIn addition to having a wonderful\n\ncollection, Jim was the nicest person\n\nyou could ever meet. I have traveled\n\nwith the Krughoffs on two Bumbling\n\nBruder Tours and they were always\n\ngreat people to spend time with. The\n\nBumbling Bruder Tours are travel\n\nevents organized by Ron and Mary Jo\n\nBopp to visit important mechanical\n\nmusic sites in Europe and the tours\n\nalways coincide with the Waldkirch\n\nOrgan Festival held every three years\n\nin June.\n\nThe Krughoffs once collected early\n\ncast iron slot machines and Corvette\n\ncars. They had one of the largest and\n\nmost important collections of both,\n\nbut they decided to liquidate these\n\ncollections because the slot machines\n\ndidnÕt do much and they couldnÕt put\n\nmileage on the valuable cars without\n\nreducing the value of the collection.\n\nJim had once seen a player piano at\n\na ShakeyÕs Pizza Parlor and knew a\n\ndeep interest had been born. Jim first\n\nacquired a Seeburg KT Special, then\n\nwent home and told Sherrie he had\n\nbought a nickelodeon and it would\n\nbe delivered the next day. Sherrie\n\nasked ÒWhatÕs a nickelodeon?Ó Jim\n\nexplained, ÒIt is a wooden box that has\n\nmusical instruments inside.Ó She said\n\nit sounded like a Òpiece of junkÓ and\n\nshe wouldnÕt want one in their home.\n\nUpon seeing and hearing it, however,\n\nshe fell in love with mechanical music\n\nand since then the couple has shared\n\nan obsession with the hobby.\n\nAround the same time they bought\n\ntheir first nickelodeon, they also\n\ndiscovered the MBSI (1983) and met\n\nother area collectors. While visiting\n\nDave Ramey to see an available\n\nmachine, Dave remarked that since\n\nthey liked mechanical music and\n\n18 MECHANICAL MUSIC May/June 2018\n\nThe De Grote Steenput Concert Fairground Organ mounted on a trailer so that it could travel to organ rallies and provide enjoyment\n\nfor many people.\n\nhad collected slot machines, they\n\nmust know Jasper Sanfilippo. Jim\n\nand Sherrie asked, ÒWhatÕs a Jasper\n\nSanfilippo?Ó Jim and Sherrie soon\n\nacquired a Regina changer, some cylinder\n\nboxes, a Seeburg H and finally a\n\nWeber Unika, restored by Dave Ramey.\n\nWhile Jim and Sherrie both liked the\n\nAmerican machines, their visits to the\n\nSanfilippo and Gilson collections and\n\ntheir purchase of the Unika, marked a\n\ntransition to European machines that\n\ncould play more sophisticated music.\n\nThe Krughoffs joined AMICA in 1986.\n\nThe Krughoffs were in the real\n\nestate development business and built\n\nmore than 3,000 homes in the Chicago\n\nsuburban area. Jim and SherrieÕs son,\n\nDan, his wife, Nikole, and their two\n\ngrandchildren, Gavin and Gillian, live\n\nnext door and assist with hosting\n\nmusical events. Dan has a major role\n\nin the operation of the family music\n\ncollection. They are members of both\n\nAMICA and MBSI.\n\nIn 2009 and 2013 Jim and Sherrie\n\nwere presented the AMICA\n\nInternational Award. Also in 2013,\n\nthey received the Roehl Ambassador\n\nAward at the MBSI convention in Chicago.\n\nThe Roehl Ambassador Award\n\nis given to Òan individual, group, or\n\ncouple for promoting interest in and\n\nappreciation of automatic musical\n\ninstruments.Ó Additionally, Jim and\n\nSherrie Krughoff founded the Lake\n\nMichigan Chapter of the MBSI.\n\nFor those who have not been to Jim\n\nand SherrieÕs home, I would like to\n\ngive you a look at some of the instruments\n\nin their remarkable collection.\n\nDe Grote Steenput Concert\n\nFairground Organ\n\nThe Steenput Frres Company of\n\nPuurs, Belgium, built this wonderful\n\norgan in 1928. ItÕs a 97-key instrument\n\nwith 786 pipes and 14 automatic registers.\n\nIn 1963, the large Steenput was\n\npurchased and preserved by Herman\n\nA shot of the detailed carving and paint-\n\ning found on the figurines adorning the\n\nfront of the Steenput organ.\n\nMay/June 2018 MECHANICAL MUSIC 19\n\nWind who also obtained a large library\n\nof music from Carl Frei. The organ\n\nwas rebuilt by the Perlee Company in\n\nAmsterdam. This was the only organ\n\ndescribed as phenomenal by the\n\nmechanical organ preservation group\n\nin Holland.\n\nIn 1992, the organ became available\n\nand was recommended to the\n\nKrughoffs by Tim Trager. They purchased\n\nthe instrument after hearing\n\nTom MeijerÕs superb arrangement\n\nof LisztÕs Hungarian Rhapsody No.\n\n2 performed on the organ via an old\n\n78 rpm recording. Johnny Verbeeck\n\nand his staff completely restored the\n\norgan in 1993. The Krughoffs bought\n\nan extensive library of music from\n\nthe only other Steenput concert organ\n\n(destroyed in a World War II bombing\n\nraid).\n\nOne exciting note Ð The Steenput\n\norgan was on the list of the National\n\nTreasures of Holland and could not\n\nbe exported from Holland. However,\n\nthe law restricting the export did not\n\ngo into effect until a month after the\n\nKrughoffs received the shipment.\n\nThe Krughoffs had the Steenput\n\nmounted on a trailer and would take\n\nit to various organ rallies pulled by a\n\nFord F-350 dual-rear-wheel truck. It\n\nmade its American public debut at the\n\nMBSI Mid-Am Organ Rally in Musca-\n\ntine, IA, during the Mississippi River\n\nflooding in July 1993, only hours after\n\nbeing delivered to the Krughoffs from\n\nits restoration in Belgium. Johnny\n\nand Jeffrey Verbeeck accompanied\n\nthe Krughoffs and their organ on\n\nthis journey. (Some readers might\n\nremember the impromptu meeting of\n\nthe ÒSteenput Concert Organ ClubÓ at\n\nthat rally). It was certainly AmericaÕs\n\nlargest traveling concert fairground\n\norgan. There are two wonderful CD\n\nrecordings of the organ, one with\n\nlight classical overtures (including the\n\nHungarian Rhapsody) and the other\n\nwith favorite popular selections.\n\nThe machine is now permanently on\n\ndisplay in KrughoffÕs music building.\n\nThe Ruth 38er Keyless Concert\n\nFairground Organ\n\nThe Ruth & Sohn model 38 (96\n\nkeyless) organ was built in Waldkirch,\n\nGermany, for a showman from Berlin\n\nJim purchased the Ruth & Sohn model 38 because of its authenticity and original\n\ncondition.

These books were cut on a\n\ntraditional foot-operated punching\n\nmachine while the restoration of the\n\norgan progressed.\n\nAfter the restoration Jim and\n\nSherrie ordered an additional 1375.5\n\nmeters of music, making a total of\n\n2,675.5 meters, or a total of 11.5 hours\n\nof music for the Ruth!\n\nOn one of the Bumbling Bruder\n\ntours, I heard the Cappriccio Italien\n\nplayed on a Ruth 38.

It was\n\nretailed by Ernst Bšcker in New York\n\nCity. The Krughoffs had it restored in\n\n1989 by Dave Ramey. They later sold it\n\nto J Douglas Cusick.\n\nThe Krughoffs also acquired a Model\n\nA Phonoliszt, which was restored by\n\nSiegfried Wendel in 1993. The story\n\nwas that it was taken out of Eastern\n\nEurope by gypsies.\n\nTim Trager asked Siegfried if he\n\ncould construct a machine with six\n\nviolins (instead of the usual three).\n\nThough they no longer existed, six-violin\n\nmachines had appeared in the\n\nliterature, so Siegfried Wendel experimented\n\nwith playing two machines\n\nwith two rolls at the same time to see\n\nhow multiple violins sounded. Jim\n\nhad agreed to buy one if it could be\n\nmade. So, Siegfried and his son Jens\n\ndesigned a bigger pneumatic system\n\nand built the machine. The result is\n\ncurrently in JimÕs music room.\n\nThe Wurlitzer 4/33 Theatre\n\nPipe Organ\n\nThe beautiful theatre organ, known\n\nas the Ò7th Street OrganÓ came from\n\nthe Organ Stop Pizza Restaurant in\n\nPhoenix, AZ. The restaurant currently\n\nhas a location in Mesa, AZ, with\n\nanother organ. According to their\n\nwebsite:\n\nIn 1984, Bill Brown decided to\n\nretire from the restaurant business.\n\nThe Phoenix Organ Stop was sold\n\nto a real estate developer, who sold\n\nthe pipe organ and demolished the\n\nbuilding in favor of an office complex.\n\nIncidentally, that instrument was\n\nsold to a couple in Downers Grove, IL,\n\nfor installation in their home!\n\nThe couple, of course, is none other\n\nthan Jim and Sherrie Krughoff! The\n\nincredibly talented David L. Junchen\n\nwas hired to move the organ and install\n\nit. It took Dave and two organ technicians\n\napproximately nine months to\n\ndo this. There were two semi-trailers\n\nfull of parts. The organ console originally\n\ncame from the Missouri Theatre\n\nin St. Louis, MO. According to the\n\nblog ÒCinema TreasuresÓ in a string of\n\ncommentary:\n\nThe first console of the Missouri\n\ndied in a fire due to a careless smoker.\n\nThe 2nd console along with a new\n\nexpanded unification relay took its\n\nplace and made the organ noteworthy.\n\nIn 1954 the console was purchased\n\nby Harvey Heck who made it part\n\nof the GraumanÕs Egyptian Theatre\n\n22 MECHANICAL MUSIC May/June 2018\n\nThis organ console once graced the stage at the Missouri Theatre in St. Louis, MO. It\n\nwas installed in GrummanÕs Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, CA, and also spent time\n\nas part of a pizza restaurant in Phoenix, AZ. It is now part of the Krughoff collection.\n\nWurlitzer that he owned. In 1972 it\n\nbecame part of Bill BrownÕs Wurlitzer\n\nin the first ÒOrgan Stop Pizza.Ó In\n\n1987, the restaurant closed, the organ\n\nwas removed and was sold to Jim and\n\nSherrie Krughoff in Downers Grove,\n\nIL. Dave Junchen restored it and it is\n\nnow part of the Krughoff Residence\n\nWurlitzer since Aug. 5, 1989 when\n\nit was formally dedicated with three\n\nconcerts played by Walt Sorony.\n\nMore history on the organ\n\nTo be clear, Harvey Heck did not\n\nown GraumanÕs Egyptian Theater, he\n\nonly purchased the Wurlizter organ\n\nfrom that location in 1956. He had\n\nthe organ installed in his home in\n\nTarzana, CA, and then later added the\n\nfour-manual Wurlitzer console from\n\nthe Missouri Theatre in St. Louis, MI.\n\nHarvey sold the organ, along with the\n\nconsole, to Bill Brown who installed\n\nit in his Organ Stop Pizza restaurant.\n\nDuring its pizza parlor days, the organ\n\nwas a testing ground for determining\n\nwhat were the best sounds for a public\n\nvenue restaurant theatre organ. Today,\n\nthe organ is still controlled by the\n\nsame console from the Missouri Theatre\n\n(minus the layers of grease from\n\nits pizza parlor days). Jim and Sherrie\n\nexpanded the organ to its current 4/33\n\nconfiguration.\n\nThe Seeburg H Orchestrion\n\nJim and Sherrie acquired their\n\nSeeburg H orchestrion in 1985 from\n\nBob Brown. Before that, it belonged\n\nto Sam Robins (Play it Again SamÕs,\n\nChicago, IL). Before that, it belonged\n\nto Steve Hecht (Chicago) and before\n\nthat, the salvage yard (Paris, IL). It was\n\nrestored by Dave Ramey around 1977.\n\nThe elaborate facade to the Philipps\n\nMonstre Paganini Orchestrion is imposing\n\nand has a stately beauty.\n\nAfter enjoying it for several years, the\n\nSeeburg H was sold to Glenn Thomas,\n\neditor of The AMICA Bulletin.\n\nThere is an interesting story about\n\nthe acquisition of rolls for this particular\n\nmachine. Apparently, someone\n\nfamiliar with mechanical music saw a\n\ntruck hauling rolls from a flood-damaged\n\ntheater. They turned out to be 60\n\nuntouched original Seeburg H rolls on\n\ntheir way to the dump! Fortunately,\n\nthese were saved and are now also\n\nsafely in the Thomas collection.\n\nThe Philipps Monstre Paganini\n\nOrchestrion\n\nThis is one of the most stunning\n\nmachines you will ever see. It was\n\nrestored from many original parts\n\nand a gorgeous reproduction cabinet\n\nwas made by Siegfried Wendel\n\nand his Mechanische Musikwerke\n\nManufaktur. ItÕs one of the largest\n\norchestrions ever made. Philipps said\n\nit represents a string orchestra of 40 to\n\n50 musicians. Siegfried discovered the\n\nmachine in Budapest and describes\n\nhis adventures in his book, Datenspeicher-\n\nMusikinstrumente (Data Storage\n\nMusical Instruments).

Why, you might\n\nask, were so many limbs removed?\n\nMainly it had to do with the fact that\n\nthere were vast numbers of men\n\nseverely wounded in battle, and it was\n\nimpossible for the limited number of\n\nsurgeons to undertake more delicate\n\nand time-consuming procedures such\n\nas building splints or removing only\n\npart of the bone or flesh damaged by\n\nbullets. Add to that a lack of operating\n\nrooms and other battlefield challenges\n\nof the time, and it was a situation\n\nwhere drastic surgery was the best\n\noption for most patients. An amputation\n\nwould often be performed to\n\nprevent deadly complications such as\n\ngangrene.1\n\nThose veterans who survived an\n\namputation faced their next challenge\n\nas they returned to civilian life in an\n\nera where most employment required\n\nphysical labor, and options for legless\n\nor armless men were extremely\n\nlimited.\n\nMany amputee veterans seeking to\n\nearn a living opted for a profession\n\npioneered by veterans of earlier European\n\nconflicts, in particular the Seven\n\nYears War (1756-1763) where disabled\n\nwarriors were taught to play barrel\n\norgans on their return from battle.\n\nThis was especially encouraged in the\n\nGerman-speaking regions of Europe.\n\nEmpress Maria Theresa of Austria\n\nwas the first to authorize permits to\n\ncrank a Leierkasten (barrel organ) in\n\npublic.

In 1810,\n\nPrussia copied Austria and issued\n\npermits as well.2 This practice continued\n\nin Germany until after World\n\nWar I. Joseph RothÕs ÒRebellion: A\n\nNovelÓ describes a German World War\n\nI amputee vet who becomes a street\n\norgan grinder and then\n\nends up losing his license\n\nand which leads to him\n\nexperiencing many more\n\nmisfortunes.3\n\nAccording to Terry\n\nBender, who wrote an\n\narticle titled ÒA Short History\n\nof Organ Grinders,Ó\n\nEuropean organ grinders\n\nwere often despised or\n\neven feared. The authorities\n\nin 17th and 18th century\n\nEurope were often afraid\n\nof itinerant musicians\n\nbecause they carried\n\ninformation and news\n\nfrom place to place, and\n\nthey sometimes stirred\n\nup trouble. It was one\n\nreason organ grinders\n\nhad to obtain licenses in\n\norder to play. Other times,\n\nthe licenses were simply\n\ngranted to disabled soldiers\n\nin lieu of pensions or\n\nmedical care.4\n\nBarrel organs, also\n\nknown as hand organs or\n\nÒgrind organs,Ó were first\n\nimported to the United\n\nStates during the mid\n\n19th century by European\n\nimmigrants. German\n\ninstrument builder Franz\n\nRudolph Wurlitzer set up\n\nshop in Cincinnati, OH, in\n\n1856 and helped establish a domestic\n\nbarrel organ trade based in the northern\n\nstates.5\n\nDrawn to the instrumentÕs portability\n\nand the ease of operating\n\nits simple hand crank mechanism,\n\nItalian, Irish, and German immigrants\n\ncontinued the old-world practice of\n\nplaying the barrel organ as urban\n\nstreet performers. These buskers,\n\nor those who entertained in public\n\nplaces for donations,6 were already\n\nknown in cities throughout the north\n\nprior to the outbreak of the Civil War\n\nin 1861. This ready audience made the\n\nbarrel organs especially attractive to\n\ndisabled veterans. The organs could\n\nbe carried on the chest thanks to a\n\nshoulder strap and supported by a\n\nstand which meant they acted almost\n\nlike a crutch for men who had lost a\n\nleg. The carved ornamental frontages\n\ncharmed passers-by, who would marvel\n\nat the instrument while the crank\n\nturner took a rest.7 Antique hand\n\norgans decorated with symbols of\n\nAmerica are often traced to disabled\n\nnorthern veterans of the Civil War.\n\nMichael Accinno, in ÒThe Oxford\n\nHandbook of Music and Disability\n\nStudies,Ó explains how some amputees\n\noperated an instrument colloquially\n\nreferred to as a Òhand organÓ without\n\nthe use of a hand. In these cases a\n\nyoung boy would often accompany\n\nthe veteran supplying youthful arms\n\nand hands to turn the crank of the\n\ninstrument while the veteran talked\n\nwith the public and collected coins.\n\nThese able-bodied young assistants\n\nhelped transport the barrel organs,\n\nand sometimes the disabled men too.\n\nThe young boys might also wear a\n\nblue uniform that matched those worn\n\nby the veterans.8\n\nAccording to Accinno, the number\n\nof disabled veteran organ buskers\n\npeaked during the 1870s. It is difficult\n\nto establish an exact number of\n\namputee veteran performers, but in an\n\narticle in the New York Times (March\n\n20, 1895), one writer estimated that\n\nÒthousands of invalid and wounded\n\nveterans purchased organsÓ after the\n\nwar. Newspapers and periodicals\n\nin California, the Midwest, and the\n\nEastern seaboard expressed alarm in\n\ndocumenting the presence of injured\n\nsoldiers performing in public spaces.9\n\nWriting in the New York Herald, one\n\nreporter captured much of the shock\n\nthat crowds felt at witnessing the\n\nsight and sound of disabled Civil War\n\nveteran buskers:\n\nAs we pass at the various corners of\n\nthe streets the organ grinders, who are\n\ndisabled soldiers, we cannot but think\n\nthat some other provision should be\n\nmade for these armless or legless men,\n\nwho have suffered for the perpetuity\n\nof the nation.

The influx of veterans\n\ninto the once immigrant-dominated\n\nprofession was so pronounced that\n\nwhen a reporter for the New York Sun\n\nasked a proprietor of barrel organs\n\nin 1874 about his clientele, he could\n\nreadily reply that they were Ònearly\n\nall Italians and old American soldiersÓ\n\n(reprinted in Scientific American, Jul.\n\n15,1874).11\n\nYet, it is likely that many of the\n\nimmigrants were actually disabled\n\nveterans of the northÕs Army of the\n\nRepublic. According to Bladek, as\n\nmany as 200,000 German-Americans\n\nand 150,000 Irish-Americans served in\n\nthe Union Army and Navy.12 Between\n\n5,000 and 10,000 Italian-Americans\n\nalso served in the Union and the\n\nConfederate armies.13 However, for\n\nmany of the writers of the times, an\n\nimmigrant organ grinder, whether an\n\namputee or not, was scorned while\n\nAmerican-born street performers\n\nwere not.\n\nA prime example of this attitude is\n\nrepresented in the 1868 book by John\n\nMc Cabe, ÒThe Secrets of the Great\n\nCity: A Work Descriptive of the Virtues\n\nand the Vices, The Mysteries, Miseries,\n\nand Crimes of New York City.Ó14 He\n\nexudes nothing but scorn for immigrant\n\norgan grinders actually calling\n\nMay/June 2018 MECHANICAL MUSIC 31\n\nThis depiction of an organ grinder from 1873 shows him as bearded and a bit disheveled.

He narrates\n\nthe story of John Williams, a gallant\n\nprivate in the Army of the Potomac\n\nwho lost both an arm and a leg during\n\nthe course of the war.

Lacking family ties\n\nin the United States, the man later\n\nreceived a barrel organ that he claimed\n\nwas financed personally by the editor\n\nof the La Crosse Democrat, Marcus\n\nPomeroy (Jan. 2, 1884).16\n\nA particularly disturbing story of\n\na one-armed German veteran in Milwaukee\n\nwas recounted in a series of\n\noutraged letters written by readers of\n\nthe Chicago Tribune. According to eyewitness\n\naccounts, the veteran arrived\n\noutside of the offices of the Wisconsin\n\nState Register and started playing a\n\nhand organ, only to have a pail of dirty\n\nwater dumped on him from the window\n\nof the office by the newspaperÕs editor,\n\nJack Turner (Chicago Tribune, Jul. 11,\n\n1872). A corroborating account by a\n\ndifferent witness indicates that Turner\n\ncontinued to berate the man and may\n\nhave even kicked him down a flight of\n\nstairs (Chicago Tribune, Jul. 15, 1872).\n\nThese accounts suggest that immigrant\n\nveterans may have had particular difficulties\n\nin navigating postwar benefit\n\nand employment networks. 17\n\nIdentifying himself only as\n\nÒOtsdama,Ó an indignant veteran\n\norgan grinder wrote to the editor\n\nof the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1869\n\nto protest against the onslaught\n\nof critiques that had been leveled\n\nagainst the performers by the newspaperÕs\n\nreaders in recent weeks. His\n\nanonymous remarks, employing a\n\nmixture of humor, sarcasm, guilt, and\n\nwit to silence and shame his critics,\n\ndemonstrate the power of disabled\n\nself-representation:\n\nÒAs a member in good standing\n\n(on one leg) of that much abused\n\nclass of musical purveyors, I beg the\n\nprivilege of giving to the public a few\n\nof the reasons which govern us in the\n\nchoice of this profession.

Do\n\nthey not consider that while they were\n\nenjoying their ease at home, we who\n\nare now maimed and crippled for\n\nlife, were fighting the battles of our\n\ncountry? And when we are unfit for\n\nactive labor, we must do something\n\nto support ourselves and those dependent\n\nupon us, for a living. Give us\n\nsomething else to do, we will gladly\n\ndo it.

Among the\n\nhighlights from these photos are shots\n\nof J. Lawrence Cook, famed piano\n\nroll producer for QRS Music Roll\n\nCompany listening to his rolls on a\n\n7-foot Steinway Duo-Art Grand piano.\n\nPeople gathered to hear the tunes\n\nand get CookÕs autograph, and Nuss\n\nsaid Cook appeared to be having a\n\nwonderful time talking with everyone\n\nwho had enjoyed his rolls so much.\n\nNuss remembers Cook not having a\n\nride home to Mount Vernon, NY, that\n\nnight and volunteering to give the legendary\n\npiano player a lift. A few wrong\n\nturns took the duo on a tour around\n\nalmost all of New York City, says Nuss,\n\nduring which time Cook shared some\n\nentertaining stories. Nuss says Cook\n\nshared stories from his early start in\n\nthe music roll business at US Music\n\nRoll Company and then his transition\n\nto QRS. Nuss even includes a copy\n\nof the letter sent from QRS to Cook\n\noffering him a sum of $200 a month to\n\nproduce music rolls (Page 33).\n\nMore on Cook\n\nMichael Meddings, on his website\n\nwww.doctorjazz.co.uk/page11.html,\n\nprovides an extensive history of\n\nCookÕs life and work, including copies\n\nof correspondence between Cook and\n\nhimself over the years. According to\n\nMeddings, Cook was orphaned at age\n\n4 after his father, a traveling minister,\n\ndied on the road. Raised by relatives\n\nwho introduced him to music, Cook\n\ntook some time to break into the\n\nindustry. He washed and unloaded\n\ncars, and worked as a candy maker in\n\nIllinois before getting freelance work\n\nfor the Bradford Song Roll Company,\n\nAeolian, Republic, and, as mentioned\n\nbefore, the US Music Roll Company. In\n\none of the letters from Cook to Med-\n\ndings, Cook estimates he produced\n\nbetween 10,000 and 20,000 piano roll\n\nmasters in his lifetime.\n\nWho are these folks?\n\nDo you know any of the people in\n\nthe photos on pages 36-37 taken at the\n\n25th Anniversary MBSI Annual Meeting?\n\nSend an email to editor@mbsi.org\n\nand help us put names to faces.\n\nRemember these?\n\nPhotos from the 25th Anniversary MBSI Annual Meeting in 1974, Saddlebrook, NJ\n\nRemember these?\n\nPhotos from the 25th Anniversary MBSI Annual Meeting in 1974, Saddlebrook, NJ\n\nThe Organino\n\nLuuk GoldhoornÕs last article\n\nLuuk was "
