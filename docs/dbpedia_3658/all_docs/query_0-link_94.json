Standard histories of the cinema tend to emphasize “quality” ﬁlms and major directors, skipping over “entertainment” genres like detective and mystery movies. And yet these ﬁlms were among the most popular of the silent era with large audiences around the world. It is not always easy to ﬁnd information about these ﬁlms. Silent cinema enthusiasts may be aware of early American and British Sherlock Holmes movies but are less likely to know of the Danish and German versions. They may know America’s Boston Blackie ﬁlms but are less likely to know European series detectives like Nick Carter, Nat Pinkerton and Miss Nobody. Silent Mystery and Detective Movies is a comprehensive encyclopedic guide to the famous and the little-known mystery and detective ﬁlms of the silent cinema, a signpost to a vast and relatively unexplored territory. Most of the ﬁlms in the guide are American and English but there are also many from Australia, Austria, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and Spain. There are entries on series, serials, detectives, villains and rogues (there were quite a few) and more than 1500 ﬁlms. Thrill-a-minute cliffhanger serials are included as they often feature detectives, but most western and espionage ﬁlms are excluded as they belong to separate genres. There are also illustrations showing scenes from the ﬁlms, postcards portraits of stars, posters advertising the movies and, when available, the DVD and VHS covers of the ﬁlms that are on video. Mystery and detective ﬁction authors whose work was ﬁlmed in the silent era are described in an appendix with cross-references to their movies and illustrations of some of their books. The book has been designed as a user-friendly guide with entries in alphabetical order and many cross-references. Information about archival prints and DVDs and videos of ﬁlms is included, though, sadly, fewer than ten percent of these ﬁlms seem to have survived. I have seen most of the surviving ﬁlms and, by and large, they are still enjoyable to view. Some are even masterpieces. As I also collect detective ﬁction and write mysteries (three have been published), I have a lot of empathy for the genre. Note: Famous sleuths, villains and rogues have entries by last name, e.g., “Holmes, Sherlock.” Entries on series and novels that were ﬁlmed more than once have an omnibus entry as well as a regular direct entry for each of them.\n\n1\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nThe Films Aa mujô—Dai ippen: Hôrô no maki\n\nBorodin and Hans Mierendorff.
