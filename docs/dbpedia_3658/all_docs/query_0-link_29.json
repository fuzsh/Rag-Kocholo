Junior Women Initiate New Members Tues. the parbies for nine row offices: three County Commissioners, District Attorney, Recorder of Deeds, Prothonotary, County Surveyor, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and Judge of the Orphans Court. There is, we repeat, an election on Tuesday. And BorÂ­ough Democrats have flung down a gauntlet. \"Even SwarthÂ­more,\" they say, \"needs a strong two-party system.\" Their statement bears consideration. Republicans in Swarthmore outregister the DemoÂ­crats by three or more to one. Should it be said that they win by sheer numbers? Perhaps the Republican party of Swarthmore, looking over the smaller group of its DemoÂ­cratic neighbors, sees no point in working-the Republicans have the greater number-of course they'll win. But, it was the tortoise who won over the hare; even dear old Maine has, in its time, gone Democratic. Republicans probably will win here, yet it is enUrely possible that the Democrats could. In the olden days a handful of Greeks fought against the armies of Xerxes at Thermopylae and stemmed the tide. Three defended the bridge at Rome against the Etruscans and won. And it has been said that while the battles of yore are more dramatic, and been asked what fight at the polls has stirred the souls of men. But no ~me yet will be quoted as saying, \"Don't bother to fight at all.\" The Swarthmore an, by no happenstance, and with good reason, is a Republican paper, and is proud of it. It sincerely hppes that Swarthmore will go Republican and that the counÂ­- uv will go Republican. But whoever you are, and whether in Swarthmore or the state of Washington, go out and vote! \"Who wants to win a ho~key game 10 to 0, or a,football game 56 to 3; a chest game over a brilliant scie!lt~t who never played the' game before, or a political contest because there simply wasn't number enough?

Mrs. Francis Forsythe, senior advisor to the Junior Club, pinÂ­ned an autumn corsage of golden chrysanthemums and amber color_ ed leaves to each new member as she accepted a small lighted taper indicating her desire to join the club. Mrs. James Steele, president of (Continued on Page 6) Local Teachers Receive Recognition of Service Harry E. Oppenlander of BenÂ­jamin West avenue and Elizabeth Barten of Media, both teachers at Swarthmore High School, were the recipients last Thursday eveÂ­ning ~f citations from the Drexel Institute of Technology. Presented at the Science Convocation dediÂ­cation of the Drexel Basic Science Center, the awards were in recogÂ­nition of their 25 years of service in the teaching of the basic sciÂ­ences. Several residents of the BorÂ­ough also received recognition. They include Katherine B.

Besides Mr. Franck, survivors include two grandsons, Clarence, Jr., and George Martin Franck, both of Cornell avenue. Services will be held Friday afternoon in Baltimore and inÂ­terment will follow, also in BaltiÂ­more. Mrs. Franck, a frequent visitor to Swarthmore, had spent a long weekend with her son and his family at Buck Hill last week. She returned from a two month tour of Europe shortly before that. Reminder to Needlework Guild Members, Oiredors Needlework Guild members are reminded that contributions of garments or money should' be turned in to directors promptly. Directors, in their tum, will be expected to bring all garments to the Ingathering at the Woman's Club next Tuesday morning beÂ­tween 9 and 10 a.m. A tea for members of the guild and their friends will follow the Ann Dodge Trio of the Matinee Musical that afternoon.
