(The Dodgers lost that game. The\n\nnext day Koufax pitched, and they lost again. But the\n\nDodgers went on to win the series, with Koufax as the\n\nlead pitcher for two of the four winning games â and\n\nKoufax picked up that seasonâs Cy Young award, as\n\nhe had in 1963 and would again in 1966.)\n\nBut while Yom Kippur was his thing, graven images,\n\nit turns out â not so much.\n\nOn the afternoon of Shabbat, June 18, Dodgers Stadium will unveil a statue of Sandy Koufax, shortly before the team faces the recently renamed Cleveland\n\nGuardians. The first 40,000 fans to get to the 56,000\n\nseat stadium for the game will get miniature replicas\n\nof the statue.\n\nThe Koufax statue is being crafted by artist Branly\n\nCadet, whose statue of Koufaxâs trailblazing teammate\n\nJackie Robinson was erected at the stadium in 2017.\n\nThe Dodgers first announced the Koufax statue in\n\n2019, with its unveiling originally planned for the summer of 2020.\n\nDodgers President and CEO Stan Kasten announced the new date this week. He said fans entering the centerfield gates now would be greeted by\n\nRobinson and Koufax.\n\nâNot only are both of these Hall of Famers part of\n\nour rich Dodger history, they are also continuously\n\ninspiring sports fans everywhere,â Kasten said in his\n\nstatement.\n\nKoufax, now 86, became the youngest player to\n\nenter baseballâs Hall of Fame when he was inducted in\n\n1972, at 36. That same year, the Dodgers retired Koufaxâs jersey number, 32, alongside Robinsonâs iconic\n\n42, which is retired across the sport.\n\nOne of the best pitchers in baseball history, Koufax was a member of four World Series championship teams, winning two World Series Most Valuable\n\nPlayer awards. Koufax also won a National League\n\nMVP during his 12-year career with the Dodgers.\n\nKoufax posted a career record of 165-87 with a 2.76\n\nearned run average, 2,396 strikeouts, 137 complete\n\ngames and 40 shutouts. He was the first pitcher to\n\nthrow four no-hitters.\n\nJACOB GURVIS/JEWISH TELEGRAPHIC AGENCY\n\nNOSHES.........................................................4\n\nAROUND THE COMMUNITY.... ..............18\n\nCOVER STORY...........................................24\n\nDâVAR TORAH ...........................................36\n\nTHE FRAZZLED HOUSEWIFE..............37\n\nCROSSWORD PUZZLE...........................37\n\nOBITUARIES...............................................38\n\nOPINION.....................................................40\n\nJEWISH WORLD.......................................45\n\nCLASSIFIED ADS..................................... 46\n\nNOTEWORTHY......................................... 48\n\nREAL ESTATE............................................ 49\n\nCONTENTS\n\nON THE COVER: This little girl\n\nhas just escaped from Ukraine\n\nwith her mother.

Weâre more than just matzo!â\n\nIn the companyâs sporadic posts to its 5,163 Twitter\n\nfollowers, Manischewitz adopts a light-hearted approach, presumably hoping to seem more with-it and\n\nalso, perhaps, of going viral.\n\nWhich would explain the two images posted on Tuesday of packages of Manischewitz-brand macaroons\n\nwith horseradish and charoset flavors.\n\nThey were posted in response to a Manischewitz\n\ntweet earlier this month, which suggested: âThinking we\n\nshould shake things up a bit. Whatcha think?â\n\nResponses ranged from âI wish this was realâ to âWhy\n\ndo you hate us Jews, Manischewitz?â\n\nNeither horseradish nor charoset currently are listed\n\nas available on Masnischewitz.com, which lists 17 flavors of canned macaroons, including âRed Velvetâ and\n\nâRocky Road.â LARRY YUDELSON\n\nSandy Koufax grins after striking out 14 batters in a\n\ngame in 1955.BETTMANN/GETTY IMAGES\n\nNew Passover\n\nflavor sensations?\n\nPage 3\n\nP:04\n\nJS-4\n\nNoshes\n\ncame famous as the\n\nadolescent star of the\n\nâHarry Potterâ movies.\n\nHis adult film career\n\nhasnât been stellar, but\n\nheâs worked steadily,\n\nand he is doing much\n\nbetter than many actors who become stars\n\nwhen they are children\n\nor teens and then fade\n\naway. Plus, Radcliffe\n\nis sitting on a gelt\n\npile. His huge Potter\n\npaydays left him with\n\na personal fortune of\n\nabout $100M.\n\nAs I have noted\n\nbefore, Radcliffe is\n\nthe son of an English\n\nJewish mother and\n\nan Irish Protestant\n\nfather. He identifies as\n\nJewish, although he\n\nwas raised secular and\n\nremains so.\n\nAs you probably\n\nheard, 2022 is the\n\n50th anniversary of\n\nthe release of first of\n\nthe three âGodfatherâ\n\nfilms. On March 22, a\n\nboxed set of the trilogy\n\nwas released on Bluish actors who played\n\nItalians in âThe Godfatherâ: JAMES CAAN,\n\nnow 81, co-starred\n\nas Sonny Corleone.\n\nBy the way, Caan\n\nad-libbed the words\n\nâbada-bingâ as he, as\n\nSonny, talked about\n\nshooting someone.\n\nâSopranosâ fans know\n\nthat Bada Bing was the\n\nname of a strip club\n\nrun by the Soprano\n\ncrime family. The late\n\nABE VIGODA played\n\nTessio, one of the Godfatherâs two main lieutenants; the late RUDY\n\nBOND played Cuneo, a\n\ncrime family head; and\n\nthe late LOUIS GUSS\n\n(who played Cherâs\n\nItalian uncle in âMoonstruckâ), played a Mafia leader who memorably proclaimed, at a\n\nMafia big-wig meeting,\n\nthat he would keep\n\nthe drug trade in black\n\nneighborhoods. Two\n\nothers of note: the\n\nlate Alex Rocco, an\n\nItalian, played Jewish\n\ngangster Moe Greene,\n\nand the late JOHN\n\nMARLEY, who was\n\nJewish, played the\n\n(possibly Jewish) movie executive who woke\n\nup with a horseâs head\n\nin his bed. âN.B.\n\nRay discs (Ultra-HD,\n\n4K). If you have a 4k\n\nTV set, you might consider buying it. Also,\n\nlate in April, a mini-series about the making\n\nof the first âGodfatherâ\n\nmovie will stream on\n\nParamount+.\n\nBelow is a list of\n\nJewish actors in the\n\nfirst âGodfatherâ film.\n\nIâll cover âThe Godfather: Part IIâ in another column. Readers\n\nof this column know\n\nthat I kvetch about\n\nnon-Jews playing very\n\nJewish parts â thatâs\n\nso true that Jewish actors say they rarely, if\n\never, get a Jewish part.\n\nThat said, I think Italian\n\n(not Jewish) actors\n\nand Jewish actors have\n\na special relationship.\n\nThere is something\n\nabout the look, culture,\n\nand body language of\n\nthese groups that is\n\nso similar that members of one group can\n\ncredibly play the other.\n\nPlus, there seems to\n\nbe a fair exchange â if\n\nyou survey all major\n\nand movie roles, you\n\nsee that the number of\n\nJews playing Italians is\n\nroughly equal to Italians playing Jews.\n\nHere are the JewScott Wolf\n\nFamily movie;\n\nRadcliffe kidnaps\n\nBullock; Godfather\n\nDaniel Radcliffe\n\nJames Caan Abe Vigoda\n\nâRescued By\n\nRuby,â an\n\noriginal Netflix\n\nfilm that was released\n\non March 17, is a\n\nfeel-good movie for\n\nthe whole family thatâs\n\nbased on a true story.\n\nThe real Ruby was a\n\nwayward puppy, an\n\nAustralian shepherd\n\nand border collie mix\n\nwho ended up in a\n\nRhode Island animal\n\nshelter because of\n\nbehavior problems.\n\nFive families adopted\n\nher and then returned\n\nher. Then Dan OâNeill, a\n\nstate police corporal,\n\ncame to the shelter\n\nlooking for a free\n\nsearch-and-rescue\n\ndog. He was taken\n\nwith Rubyâs intelligence and energy. He\n\nadopted Ruby, then a\n\n8-month-old pup, in\n\n2011, and trained her.\n\nWell, you can guess\n\nthat Ruby did something special to merit\n\na lot of press â and\n\nthen a movie about\n\nher. I wonât spoil your\n\nviewing by telling you\n\nwhat she did. Grant\n\nGustin , TVâs âFlash,â\n\nplays Dan. SCOTT\n\nWOLF, 43, has a big\n\nrole as Danâs commanding officer.\n\nWolf, who was\n\nraised in a Reform\n\nJewish home, became\n\nwell known playing\n\nstar character Bailey\n\nSalinger on the hit\n\nseries âParty of Fiveâ\n\nfrom 1994 to 2000.\n\nWolf didnât become\n\na big star after âParty\n\nof Fiveâ ended, but he\n\nhas worked steadily.\n\nHe was a series regular\n\non âThe Night Shift,â\n\nan NBC medical show\n\nfrom 2014 to 17, and he\n\nis a regular on âNancy Drew,â a CW series\n\nthat now is airing its\n\nthird season.\n\nâThe Lost City,â\n\nwhich opens in theaters on the 25th, stars\n\nSandra Bullock as Loretta, a romance novelist who is kidnapped\n\nby Fairfax, an eccentric billionaire.

(See box.) The expo\n\nis sponored on by Nefesh bâNefesh, the\n\norganization devoted to helping Jews\n\nfrom North America and the United\n\nKingdom make aliyah to Israel. The\n\nexpo is designed to help medical professionals explore career options in Israel\n\nâ and to help those who have decided\n\nto make aliyah take care of some of their\n\nprofessional paperwork before crossing\n\nthe ocean.\n\nDoctors, nurses, therapists, and other\n\nmedical professionals hoping to practice\n\nin Israel have to be relicensed by Israeli\n\nauthorities. To be issued that license, the\n\napplicant must present diplomas, certifications, and other American professional documents, and an Israeli notary\n\nmust authenticate them.\n\nSo Nefesh bâNefesh is bringing two\n\nIsraeli notaries to the Glenpointe to certify those documents â along with representatives of many Israeli government\n\noffices.\n\nThe goal is âto get everything under\n\nyour belt pre-aliyah, so after you make\n\naliyah all youâll need is your Israeli identity card to be issued a license,â Ronen\n\nFuxman said. Mr. Fuxman is responsible for government advocacy and the\n\nemployment division of Nefesh BâNefesh\n\nand he is one of the organizers of the\n\nMedEx program.\n\nâSomeone who is coming to the event\n\ncan do paperwork in three to four hours\n\nthat would take four to six months if it\n\nhad to be done one by one,â he saidÂ â\n\nin large part because officials who normally occupy separate buildings, if not\n\nseparate cities, will be gathered in one\n\nhotel ballroom.\n\nIn addition to government representatives â including half a dozen from the\n\nMinistry of Health â Nefesh BâNefesh\n\nalso is bringing representatives of the\n\nIsraeli medical association and officials\n\nfrom hospitals, health maintenance\n\norganizations, and medical technology\n\ncompanies looking to hire soon-to-be\n\nIsraelis with American medical training.\n\nMore than 150 people already have\n\nbooked slots with licensing professionals, and another 200 have expressed\n\ninterest in attending, Mr. Fuxman said.\n\nItâs a âtwo-step processâ for American\n\ndoctors to qualify to practice in Israel,\n\nhe explained. First they must get their\n\nIsraeli license, and then they need Israeli\n\nboard certification. For that, âsomeone\n\nneeds to review your credentials, your\n\nresidencies, your work experience, your\n\npublications. So weâre bringing two\n\nrepresentatives of the Israeli medical\n\nassociation who will sit near the representatives of the Ministry of Health. Doctors will move to that table after being\n\ninstructed and helped by our team.â\n\nHis advice to attendees: âBring as many\n\ndocuments as possible: your license, your\n\nemployment documents, your school\n\ntranscripts. If youâre a surgeon, you need\n\nto bring your surgery log.â\n\nMr. Fuxman said that most of the time\n\nslots to meet with licensing officials on\n\nSunday already are filled, but there are\n\nplenty available on Monday.\n\nâI would recommend coming on\n\nSunday and see what you have to do,\n\nand come back on Monday with all the\n\nrequired documents,â he said.\n\nWhile medical professionals other\n\nthan doctors, such as occupational and\n\nphysical therapists, have fewer licensing requirements, the hoops they must\n\njump through are higher. Unlike physicians, they will have to take Israeli\n\nlicensing exams.\n\nâItâs kind of an obstacle,â Mr. Fuxman\n\nadmitted. âWeâre doing our best to help\n\nby connecting the new olimâ â immigrants â âwith old olim who already\n\ntook the exam and can offer advice.â\n\nThe MedEx event also will provide a\n\nvenue for job interviews.\n\nâItâs a great opportunity to see what\n\nthe country has to offer in terms of the\n\nmedical landscape, whether you are 21\n\nyears old and fresh out of nursing with\n\nno idea of what to do with your life, or\n\nare a doctor and thinking of shifting\n\ndirections,â Mr. Fuxman said. âYou can\n\ntalk to people who can tell you how to\n\ncombine work in a hospital and an HMO\n\nto get a nice salary.â\n\nThis will be the first MedEx event\n\nsince 2019; one scheduled for March 15,\n\n2020 was cancelled at the beginning of\n\nthe pandemic.\n\nMr. Fuxman said the Israeli government sees recruiting immigrant doctors\n\nas an urgent task.\n\nâWe are very low on the charts in\n\nterms of doctors per one thousand residents,â he said. âThe further you go\n\nfrom the center of the country to the\n\nperiphery, the situation becomes even\n\nmore critical.â\n\nOded Forer, a former Knesset member\n\nwho heads the Ministry for the Development of the Periphery, the Negev and the\n\nGalilee, will be at the Glenpointe, along\n\nwith the ministryâs deputy director.\n\nâTheyâre trying to lure more doctors\n\nto the periphery as the shortage in those\n\nareas is really critical,â Mr. Fuxman said.\n\nBut the shortage of medical professionals stretches across the entire country and is expected to get much worse\n\nsoon. âA huge chunk of current Israeli\n\ndoctors are the olim who immigrated\n\nfrom the former Soviet Union in the\n\n1990,â he said. âThat chunk is now retiring and exiting the work force in bulk.â\n\nWhat: MedEx pre-aliyah fair for\n\npotential immigrants in medical\n\nprofessions\n\nWhere: Teaneck Marriott at\n\nGlenpointe, 100 Frank W Burr Blvd,\n\nTeaneck\n\nWhen: Sunday, March 27, and\n\nMonday, March 28, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nFor more information and advance\n\nregistration: http://bit.ly/medex22\n\nAmerican medical professionals meet with Israeli HMO recruiters at the 2019 Aliyah MedEx.

If the 150 professionals who have registered make aliyah\n\nthis year, that would be âa huge, huge\n\ncontribution.â\n\nIn 2021, 94 North American doctors\n\nwere relicensed in Israel â but only 38 of\n\nthem were under 70. âThatâs not a good\n\nnumber,â Mr. Fuxman said. âThis year\n\nthe average age is going down.â\n\nIsrael recently instituted a major policy shift to encourage more young doctors to make aliyah.\n\nâTogether with the Israel Defense\n\nForce and the Ministry of Absorption, we\n\nwere able to renegotiate the mandatory\n\ndraft age for doctors,â Mr. Fuxman said.\n\nâUntil recently, the age was 35 or 36; a\n\ndoctor coming to Israel, whether a psychiatrist or an emergency medical specialist, would be drafted for two full years\n\nas an army doctor.\n\nâIf you were married and lived up\n\nnorth, you could still be assigned to\n\nserve in Beersheba and only be able to\n\ngo home every other weekend. This was\n\na big no-go for many of our olim who\n\nwanted to come at the beginning of their\n\ncareers. If Iâm an orthopedic surgeon and\n\nIâm not in surgery two days a week, Iâm\n\nlosing my skills.\n\nâWe got it down to 30. Thatâs a big\n\ndeal. We donât have a lot of doctors trying to come below that age â usually\n\ntheyâre coming at age 31 and up, after\n\ntheir residency and working a bit to pay\n\noff student loans.â\n\nNefesh BâNefesh and government\n\nministers are working together to create\n\na program to help pay off immigrantsâ\n\nstudent loans, Mr. Fuxman added. âThe\n\naverage current student loans for doctors is about $180,000,â he said. âYoung\n\nAmerican doctors know our salaries are\n\nlower compared to the U.S. and so are\n\nkind of afraid to move to Israel.â\n\nWhile itâs not final, âeveryone in the\n\ngovernmentâ â that includes the ministries of health and finance â âis really\n\nthrilled about this program and we hope\n\nto get the green light soon,â he said.\n\nThe upcoming MedEx fair, like this one in 2019, offers potential olim a chance to meet with Israeli employers. SHAHAR AZRAN\n\nJENNA BASCOM\n\nP:08\n\nLocal\n\nJS-8\n\n8 JEWISH STANDARD MARCH 25, 2022\n\nRemembering Akiva Wulkan\n\nJOANNE PALMER\n\nWhen you walk up\n\nto the front door\n\nof the Wulkansâ\n\nhouse in Englewood, you suspect that youâre visiting a place where big personalities live. When you walk through\n\nthe door into the front hall, you\n\nknow it.\n\nDr. I. Akiva Wulkan â Kevi to\n\nhis family and friends â died in\n\nNovember; the aftereffects of a life\n\nwell and thoroughly lived remain,\n\nas his wife, Reba Wertentheil\n\nWulkan, makes clear.\n\nThe door is purple, and a purple tie dangles from the knocker;\n\nthe very high entryway, also purple, is covered with art, some of it\n\nJewish, some of it not, all of it clear\n\nevidence of two people with complementary and bold taste.\n\nDr. Wulkan collected things; his\n\ncollections â of guitars, of fountain pens, of art â reflected his passions.\n\nHe was a radiologist, and for years he\n\nheaded the radiology department at\n\nBrookdale Hospital in Brooklyn. He told\n\nstories. He sang â sometimes cantorial\n\nmusic, sometimes American folk music,\n\nsometimes Irish folk music, sometimes\n\nmusic from some other time or place\n\nthat he found evocative, soulful, or otherwise appealing. He was active in his\n\nshul, Congregation Ahavath Torah in\n\nEnglewood, which he served in many\n\nvolunteer capacities, including as president. âHe prided himself on his nusach,â\n\nthe liturgical melodies he sang, Ms. Wulkan said. âHe loved the honor of being\n\nasked to daven from the amud,â to lead\n\na service from the front of the\n\nsynagogue, as the voice of the\n\ncommunity.\n\nHe was beloved.\n\nHis story began in 1949, in\n\nBrooklyn, where he was born as\n\nthe only child of Aaron, who was\n\nborn in OÅwiÄcim, Poland (the\n\ntownâs name in German, infamously, is Auschwitz), but was\n\nable to leave well before World\n\nWar II, and Mildred, who was\n\nAmerican born. They were modern Orthodox and sent their son\n\nto BTA â thatâs Yeshiva Universityâs now-defunct Brooklyn Talmudic Academy. When he was a\n\nchild, he sang in Moshe Koussevitzkyâs choir at Young Israel-Beth\n\nEl of Borough Park.\n\nBut Dr. Wulkanâs mother died\n\nwhen he was 15, and his father,\n\nwho quickly remarried, lived for\n\nonly another three years. Kevi lived with\n\nan aunt and uncle. It was a hard part of\n\nhis life. âHe always told me that he had\n\nall those collections because he always\n\nfelt shuffled from place to place after his\n\nmother died, and he never felt like he\n\nhad anything of his own,â Ms. Wulkan\n\nsaid. But he made up for it. âHe loved\n\nshopping â for his children, for his\n\ngrandchildren, for me,â she said.\n\nDr. Wulkan went to YU, where he was\n\npremed, and then went on to Lenox Hill.\n\nâWe met at Grossingerâs, at Sukkot,â\n\nMs. Wulkan said; it was a singles weekend. That was in 1973; they got engaged\n\non New Yearâs Eve as the calendar\n\nturned to 1974, again at Grossingerâs,\n\nand they got married just a few\n\nmonths later. âHe always used\n\nto sing to me while we were\n\ndating,â Ms. Wulkan said. The\n\nwedding was the night after Dr.\n\nWulkan graduated from medical\n\nschool.\n\nThe young couple first lived\n\nin Westchester County, but soon\n\nmoved to Englewood, drawn\n\nthere by one of Ms. Wulkanâs\n\nbrothers, Dr. Alvin Wertentheil,\n\nan internist who practiced in Fort\n\nLee, beloved like his brother-inlaw, who died in 2012. âWe fell in\n\nlove with it,â Ms. Wulkan said.\n\nDr. Wulkan found cantors for\n\nthe familyâs shul, Ahavath Torah\n\nâ often big-name cantors â who\n\nled the davening on the high holidays. âHis approach to davening had such religious depths,â\n\nMs. Wulkan said. âIt wasnât just\n\nabout melodies,â although it\n\nalso was about melodies. âIt was\n\nabout connecting to God.â\n\nHe also knew a great deal about technology from his work as a radiologist;\n\nhe helped keep Brookdaleâs department\n\nkeep up to date, she added.\n\nDr. Wulkan told stories; his motherin-law, Miriam, another large personality who lived in Brooklyn and summered in Long Beach, often was both\n\nthe audience and the subject of those\n\nstories. (Miriam Wertentheilâs husband,\n\nIsrael, had died years earlier.) One of\n\nhis favorite stories, told with gusto and\n\nmuch body language, involved a watermelon that had been stored in a spare\n\nrefrigerator that hadnât been plugged\n\nin. When the whole family had gathered\n\nfor Shabbat dinner and the watermelon\n\nhad been lugged in, Miriam took the\n\nchallah knife and plunged it into the\n\nmelonâs green rind. âThe whole thing\n\nexploded all over the kitchen,â Ms. Wulkan said, retelling her husbandâs story.\n\nEven the grandchildren tell that story\n\nnow, she added.\n\nâI found a black-and-white composition notebook where Kevi started writing all these stories down,â she said.\n\nâBut he wrote down only the titles, not\n\nthe whole stories. There are about 20 of\n\nthem.â She knows the stories; she could\n\nrecreate them, she said, but even just\n\nthe titles have life.\n\nDr. Wulkan suffered from health\n\nproblems for much of his life; he developed something called fatty liver syndrome â itâs also called hepatic steatosis, and as Ms. Wulkan stressed, it has\n\nabsolutely nothing to do with alcoholic\n\nconsumption. As a result of the extra\n\nwear on his kidneys, they also started\n\nto fail. In 2015, after waiting on lists for\n\na long time, he was able to get a liver\n\nand kidney transplant, from the same\n\ncadaveric donor.\n\nThe Wulkansâ house is filled with art.\n\nMs. Wulkan is an artist and curator â\n\nsheâs retired from the Yeshiva University\n\nMuseum â with a curious eye and a passion for purple. Her husband loved Judaica. He also hung all of the very many\n\npieces of art displayed throughout their\n\nhouse; he was a perfectionist, making\n\nsure that everything hung exactly right.\n\nBetween the two of them, what could\n\nhave been discordant pieces of art sit\n\ntogether in a house that is both comfortable and stimulating.\n\nâHe was a full-service do-gooder,â Ms.\n\nWulkan quotes her sister-in-law, Susan\n\nWertentheil, as saying.\n\nAnd she has her own one-word\n\ndescription of her husband. âSoulful,â\n\nshe said. âHe was soulful.â\n\nDr. Akiva Wulkanâs survivors include\n\nhis wife; his children, Ahuva Winslow,\n\nRachael Platt, and Ahron Wulkan; several grandchildren, sisters- and brothers-in-law, nieces, nephews, and many\n\nother people, family and friends, who\n\nloved him.\n\nDr. I.

We donât want a Second Avenue Yiddish production. We want a film for everybody.â\n\nAnd that marks the genesis of one of the most popular musical film adaptations of what is arguably the\n\nmost popular Broadway musicals ever.\n\nIt is also one of many fascinating tidbits in âFiddlerâs\n\nJourney to the Big Screen,â which area residents will be\n\nable to screen as part of the 19th annual JCC Rockland\n\nInternational Film Festival. In fact, it will be available\n\non April 7; thatâs three weeks before its theatrical debut\n\nin New York.\n\nThe festival, which runs from March 27 through May\n\n3 (with a Passover break) features 13 films of Jewish\n\ninterest.\n\nAccording to Rachel Appell, the JCCâs special projects\n\ncoordinator, this yearâs events mark the festivalâs return\n\nto live theater, at least in part, after a two-year pandemic-related pause. While all the movies will be available\n\nonline, the last four productions â âOur Sons,â âValiant\n\nHearts,â âPlan A,â and the closing night film,\n\nâThe Levys of Monticelloâ âalso will be shown\n\nat the Regal Nanuet.\n\nAs usual, the festival offers a wide range of\n\ngenres; films range from serious documentaries\n\nto light-hearted fare. The opening night presentation, âA Tree of Life,â obviously is on the serious side. It is about the horrendous antisemitic\n\nrampage at the Pittsburgh synagogue complex\n\nin 2018. Eleven congregants, ranging in age\n\nfrom 54 to 97, were murdered. Director Trish\n\nAdlesic talks to the survivors and family members of the victims in this moving documentary,\n\nwhich brings into focus how our very social fabric is deteriorating. A prerecorded Zoom interview with the filmmaker follows the screening.\n\nOn a lighter note, the chances are that anyone who grew up in the metropolitan area and\n\nis of a certain age (and willing to admit it) has\n\nbeen to an automat. (On a personal note, that\n\nwas my familyâs Big Meal Out, every Saturday, at the\n\nHorn & Hardardt on 181st Street in Washington Heights.\n\nYou know, next to Wertheimersâs Department Store.)\n\nThe film, appropriately titled âThe Automat,â\n\nreceived ecstatic reviews when it was released last fall,\n\nduring the pandemic, when most folks rarely ventured\n\nto the cinema. It features interviews with New Yorkers\n\nwho deposited their nickels to open up the windows to\n\nsandwiches and desserts. Among them is Mel Brooks,\n\nwho was so excited about remembering the automat\n\nthat he wrote and performed a song for the film.\n\nâDoughâ is listed as the senior film, perhaps because\n\nit is the oldest. Originally released in 2015, it has aged\n\nwell. Or, since it largely takes place in a bakery, can I\n\nsay that âDoughâ has risen to the occasion. Nat Dyson\n\n( Jonathan Price) reluctantly hires a Muslim teen to\n\nwork in his kosher bakery. There are two things he\n\ndoesnât realize at first: that the teen has a side business\n\nselling weed, and why his business suddenly picked up\n\n(after the teen accidentally drops some product in the\n\ndough).\n\nBut back to âFiddlerâ. I will watch anything Fiddler-related, unless it features Harvey Fierstein as\n\nTevye. Jewison (âHeat of the Night,â âMoonstruckâ) was\n\na perfect choice as director. He says heâs been the subject of antisemitic abuse from people who assumed he\n\nwas Jewish, so he understood the film. Also, he\n\nhad musical experience in television, where he\n\ndirected both Harry Belafonte and Judy Garland.\n\nWhen word got out about the film, everyone\n\nwanted to play Tevye, he said, including Danny\n\nKaye and Frank Sinatra. Jewison nixed the obvious choice, Zero Mostel, who originated the role\n\non Broadway. He felt, correctly, that Mostelâs\n\nperformance featured too much schtick. Mostel\n\nthought he was bigger than the play and was ânot\n\nwhat Sholem Aleichem had in mind.â He found\n\nhis Tevye in Topol, the Israeli actor who was playing that role in the London production.\n\nThe film includes interviews with John Williams, the filmâs musical director; Sheldon Harnick, the scoreâs lyricist; the actresses cast to play\n\nTevyeâs daughters; members of the crew and\n\nnoted film critic Kenneth Turan.\n\nThe film ends on two interesting notes. Jewison somehow â perhaps during the filming â became\n\ninfused with Jewish spirit. He remarried Lynn St. David\n\nand arranged for a rabbi to perform the ceremony\n\nunder a chuppah.\n\nPerhaps it was a conversation heâd had years earlier, after screening âFiddlerâ for David Ben Gurion.\n\nHe asked the prime minister who he thought could be\n\nconsidered to be Jewish. Ben Gurion replied: âAnyone\n\nwho is crazy enough to want to be Jewish is Jewish.â\n\nTicket prices are $12 for virtual screenings, $14 for\n\nin-person tickets, and $100 for a full subscription.\n\nThereâs more information and a link to order tickets at\n\njccrock-land.eventive.org.\n\nAbove and below, scenes from the meta movie âFiddlerâs Journey to the Big Screen.â\n\nP:11\n\nLocal\n\nJS-11\n\nJEWISH STANDARD MARCH 25, 2022 11\n\n*Annual Percentage Yield (APY) disclosed is effective as of February 15, 2022 and may be changed by the Bank at any time, including after account\n\nopening.

He faces counts\n\nof first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, and third-degree\n\nendangering the welfare of a child.\n\nIn November, the Rabbinical Council of Bergen County, which provides\n\nkosher supervision for Mr. Yehudielâs\n\nrestaurants, the Humble Toast and La\n\nCucina Di Nava, barred him from the\n\nestablishments in the wake of two civil\n\nlawsuits alleging sexual abuse of minors.\n\nThe criminal charges against Mr.\n\nYehudiel reflect complaints from a third\n\nalleged victim, who was an employee\n\nof his. According to the charges, Mr.\n\nYehudiel committed multiple sexual\n\nassaults against the employee last September, October, and November. The\n\nassaults allegedly took place in Teaneck.\n\nAccording to the complaint filed by\n\nthe Bergen County prosecutor, the\n\nemployee turned 16 during that period.\n\n(Sexual assaults of 16- and 17-year-old\n\nminors are treated less severely under\n\nNew Jersey law than those on 13- through\n\n15-year-olds; assaults on younger children are treated more severely still.)\n\nBefore the accusations, Mr. Yehudiel\n\nhad maintained a high profile in the\n\nworld of North Jersey kosher food. He\n\nhad been featured on the Food Channelâs âChoppedâ show in 2020, and in\n\nMay 2021 he was a featured participant\n\nin a virtual breakfast fundraiser held by\n\nProject Sarah, a Jewish organization dedicated to supporting victims of domestic\n\nviolence and sexual abuse.\n\nAccording to the prosecutorâs office,\n\nMr. Yehudielâs alleged crimes against his\n\nemployee were reported to the Federal\n\nBureau of Investigations in November,\n\nand the FBI passed the report on to the\n\nprosecutorâs office for investigation.\n\nThe earlier civil suits allege abuse of\n\ntwo other victims, one an employee and\n\nthe other a fellow congregant at a Fair\n\nLawn synagogue. In at least one of those\n\ncases, the allegations had been reported\n\nto the prosecutorâs office, which had\n\ndeclined to prosecute.\n\nThe report to the FBI came not long\n\nafter Zaâakah, an organization devoted\n\nto fighting sexual abuse in the Jewish\n\ncommunity and advocating for its victims, began a social media campaign\n\nhighlighting the civil suits against Mr.\n\nYehudiel. According to Ariella Kay,\n\nZaâakahâs social media manager, the\n\norganization chose that time to post\n\nabout the cases because a window for\n\nretrospective lawsuits against child\n\nabusers created by the New Jersey Child\n\nVictims Act was closing.\n\nZaâakah led a protest at one of Shalom Yehudielâs restaurants in November.\n\nSEE CRIMINAL PAGE 44\n\nP:12\n\nLocal\n\nJS-12\n\n12 JEWISH STANDARD MARCH 25, 2022\n\nPenguin Rep reopens\n\nNew offerings to include âFar From the Home I Loveâ â yup, itâs from âFiddlerâ\n\nCURT SCHLEIER\n\nâEverybody thought it\n\nwas going to be three\n\nmonths, four months,\n\nfive,â Joe Brancato said.\n\nâBut now itâs two years.â\n\nMr. Brancato is the artistic director of\n\nthe Penguin Rep in Stoney Point, N.Y.,\n\nwhich for more than four decades has\n\nbeen a beacon for theater lovers in Rockland and Bergen counties. And of course,\n\nhe was referring to the forced closing of\n\ntheaters everywhere. The good news is\n\nthat after the pandemic hiatus, Penguin\n\nis back with an expanded season and\n\nâ hereâs the better news â lower ticket\n\nprices than in 2019.\n\nAnd there is no bad news.\n\nThe 2022 season includes six productions rather than the usual four, including the world premiere of âFar From\n\nthe Home I Love: Eight concert performances of the songs from Fiddler on the\n\nRoof,â reimagined by Paul Shapiro and\n\nscheduled for April 2 to April 10.\n\nMr. Brancato and Andrew Horn, the\n\ntheaterâs executive director, obviously\n\nare looking forward to the season with\n\nhigh hopes â but also a bit of trepidation.\n\nThe world situation âmakes it very\n\ndifficult time to rejoice,â Mr. Brancato\n\nsaid. âHopefully what we do in the theater will remind people of the beauty of\n\nlistening to someone elseâs story,\n\nengaging in the story, perhaps\n\nlaughing or giving them something to think about.â\n\nThe Penguin was luckier than\n\nsome other regional companies.\n\nWhen the theater world closed\n\ndown in March 2020, Penguin\n\nhadnât finalized its summer season. So there were no contracts\n\nto break or revise, no refunds\n\nto hand out to patrons. Instead,\n\nPenguinâs leaders spent the first\n\nyear off upgrading the safety\n\nmeasures in the theater â a converted barn.\n\nâWe then tried to figure out\n\nwhat we can do to let people\n\nknow weâre still here,â Mr. Horn said.\n\nâSo starting last summer we did concerts\n\noutside the theater that were incredibly\n\nwell attended. It created a community of\n\npeople who wanted to get together but\n\nin a safe way.â\n\nAs theater returned to live performances, the Penguin concerts transitioned inside. All the while, Mr. Horn\n\ncontinued, âwe were planning to resume\n\ntheatrical production, and trying to\n\nfigure out how we do that. How do you\n\ntry to reengage an audience? And how\n\ndo you provide employment and opportunities for artists to create?â\n\nPenguin came up with an eclectic\n\nseries of shows, starting with a one-person performance by Robert Montano.\n\nThe autobiographical play, âSmall,â\n\nwhich will run through March 27, details\n\nMontanoâs rise from Belmont Park\n\njockey to actor who has worked with\n\neveryone from Chita Rivera to\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones.\n\nMr. Brancato, who knows\n\nhis audience â and his reporters â notes: âThe next show is\n\nright up your alley.â He goes on\n\nto describe a video Mr. Shapiro\n\nshowed him that convinced him\n\nto stage âFar From the Home I\n\nLove.â It showed Mr. Shapiro playing âFiddlerâ songs to\n\nenthusiastic crowds in the middle of a Warsaw square. âThey\n\nwent through the roof with joy.\n\nâWe said, why donât we take\n\nthe score and give it some universality? Letâs span it out.\n\nMaybe someoneâs Anatevka is in South\n\nAmerica. Maybe someoneâs Anatevka is\n\nanother foreign country. So we assembled three amazing singers from all parts\n\nof the globe and Paul Shapiro is going to\n\nbe presenting it as a concert.â\n\nMr. Brancatoâs hope is that these two\n\nshowsâ he calls them soft openings\n\nbecause their runs are shorter than the\n\ntypical three-weeks at Penguin â will act\n\nas theatrical magnets, âpulling people\n\nback, getting them used to coming in\n\nagain.â\n\nWhat awaits then are shows such as\n\nâNow Comes the Fun Part,â about what\n\nhappens when you turn 50 and that first\n\nAARP card comes in the mail.\n\nAnother is the comedy romp, âThe Virtuous Life of Joseph Andrews,â inspired\n\nby the bawdy work of Henry Fielding. Itâs\n\nby Gary Gitter, a Penguin favorite, who\n\nwrote âThe Sabbath Girl,â the sold-out\n\n2019 Brancato-directed production that\n\nPenguin moved to an off-Broadway run.\n\nIn mid-description, Mr. Brancato\n\nputs on his best âFront Pageâ voice and\n\nshouts: âWanna scoop? I have a scoop\n\nfor you! This is a scoop. Nobody knows\n\nthis. The playwrightâ â thatâs Mr. Gitter\n\nâ âis working with Neil Berg adapting\n\nâSabbath Girlâ into a musical. And weâre\n\nhoping to stage that next season.â\n\nMr. Horn then chips in with more\n\nnews: Two two additional concerts, tributes to Stephen Sondheim and Carole\n\nKing, also are planned for this season.\n\nThe biggest worry the voluble Mr. Brancato has now is how will he greet returning friends. Hugs are out. Or are they?\n\nJoe Brancato talks to the audience inside Penguin Repâs theater, which is a converted barn.\n\nJoe Brancato, left, and Andrew Horn\n\nPENGUIN REP\n\nPENGUIN REP\n\nP:13\n\nJS-13\n\nJEWISH STANDARD MARCH 25, 2022 13\n\nThe Yeshiva University Center for Israel Studies\n\nYU Israelite Samaritans Project\n\nA Special First Viewing of our Documentary Film!\n\nFilmmaker Moshe Alafi and Prof. Steven Fine\n\nin Conversation with Prof. Erica Brown\n\nCelebration of: The Samaritans: A Biblical People (Brill and YU Press, 2022)\n\nThe Samaritan Cookbook (Wipf and Stock, 2021)\n\nView Jewish Artists Encounter Samaritan Culture, a joint project with the Jewish Art Salon\n\nSunday, March 27, 2â6 p.m.\n\nYU Museum at the Center for Jewish History | 15 West 16th Street, New York, NY 10011\n\nReservations: $10.00, Students and Faculty: $5.00\n\nRegister at: yu.edu/samaritans\n\nP:14\n\nLocal\n\nJS-14\n\n14 JEWISH STANDARD MARCH 25, 2022\n\nFIRST PERSON\n\nGoing from one bubble to another\n\nOur correspondent writes about illness during covid\n\nJONATHAN E. LAZARUS\n\nTransitions are a continuing part of our lives.\n\nSome are seamless, others jarring, many\n\npositive, a few heartbreaking. Recently, as\n\nIâve come to the cusp of 80, Iâve been forced\n\nto contend with a transition not of my own making,\n\nbut one imposed by health challenges. Thatâs hardly\n\nunusual for a person my age, although itâs a bit more\n\ncomplicated facing it during the pandemic, even one\n\nthatâs seemingly winding down.\n\nIn the months ahead, I will continue to mask and\n\nmaintain social distancing as those about me are shedding their protection and cozying up to friends and\n\nloved ones. While restaurants, concert venues, and congregations begin to re-acquire the trappings\n\nof the old normal, I will be maintaining my\n\ndistance â no, itâs something more than that,\n\na measured apartness â as my immune system copes with chemotherapy treatments for\n\nlymphoma of the spleen. The only relatively\n\nclose contact with others will occur during\n\nappointments for infusions and assessments\n\nat Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in\n\nLivingston. When Iâm at the supermarket,\n\nI practice defensive cart-wheeling in every\n\naisle. And although Iâve returned to the JCC\n\nMetroWest for light workouts, gingerly trying\n\nto coax back some muscle tone, Iâve made\n\nsure to exercise in wide-open spaces.\n\nFor the past two years, my wife and I adjusted to\n\ncovid restrictions as they unspooled, often ambiguously, always in flux, sometimes in contradiction. Both\n\nof us are vaccine and science advocates, and have been\n\never since we queued up for polio shots as youngsters\n\nin our Newark school playgrounds decades ago. And\n\nwe are fully vaxxed and boosted. As delta and omicron variants intruded, our family canceled a vacation\n\nand several holiday gatherings out of an abundance\n\nof caution â just like millions of others. Because we\n\nare retired empty nesters and mutual caregivers, our\n\nstress factors during the pandemic were considerably\n\nless than couples working remotely while their children\n\nsat (or roughhoused) in the next room during virtual\n\nclasses, or those dealing with elderly loved ones living\n\nwith them or sequestered in a nursing home.\n\nAs a result of my chemotherapy, I recently received\n\ntwo doses of Evusheld to strengthen my covid resistance. The new drug has been authorized by the FDA\n\non an emergency basis, but the process hasnât gone\n\nsmoothly. According to a recent New York Times article, some doctors and patients didnât know the medication existed while other physicians were unfamiliar\n\nwith the two-shot, twice-repeated regimen and didnât\n\nadvocate for it. The government has yet to provide\n\nguidelines on who gets Evusheld, with most hospitals\n\nreserving it for cancer and transplant patients, while\n\nothers are using first-come first-served lotteries. And\n\nadding to the confusion, the treatment is offered as prophylaxis for recipients without covid, not as a curative\n\nfor those whoâve already contracted it.\n\nThe Evusheld uncertainty also\n\nconfronted me with a painful reality. My stepson Michael was diagnosed with MS nearly 20 years ago. The autoimmune\n\ndisease affects neural transmissions and requires him\n\nto take twice-a-year infusions. Mike is a model patient\n\nand an activist in the MS community who exhibits a\n\nsteely determination not to let the condition dominate\n\nhis life. But the pandemic presented him with an additional hurdle. Although he received both vaccine shots\n\nand the booster, he could not develop sufficient antibodies against covid. For the past two years, Mike has\n\nrarely ventured from his home at the Shore. He works\n\nremotely, fulfills his parental duties as creatively as\n\nhe can, and maintains an even, optimistic disposition\n\ndespite the extra burdens.\n\nAs of this writing, Mike had spent two months\n\nattempting to obtain Evusheld through contacts in his\n\nmedical and MS networks, but to no avail. I reached\n\nout to my Barnabas treatment center and the MS office\n\nand was told that only cancer or transplant patients\n\nwere receiving the shots. Finally, Mikeâs proactive persistence paid off. After using a website and contacting\n\narea hospitals again, he was able to have the necessary\n\npreclearance paperwork faxed to his doctorâs office\n\nand now has a date-certain appointment to receive the\n\nshots at Jersey Shore Medical Center. According to the\n\nTimes report, the federal government has bought hundreds of thousands of Evusheld doses from AstraZeneca that sit in warehouses awaiting distribution. The\n\ndisconnect feels doubly frustrating when a family member is involved and is forced to go to such great lengths\n\nto obtain the drug.\n\nMeanwhile, my treatment for lymphoma proceeds\n\nalong a well-ordered schedule. Like all cancer patients,\n\nI have a personal narrative, and itâs one that I choose to\n\nshare beyond family and friends in this public space.\n\nSymptoms began presenting late last year with a rapid\n\ndrop in weight, extreme fatigue, loss of appetite, night\n\nsweats, and balance issues. After confounding my GP\n\nand two specialists for weeks, my wife and I went to the\n\nemergency room at Cooperman Barnabas, where my\n\noncologist (observing me for several years for a much\n\nless acute lymphoma) immediately ordered a battery of\n\ntests and scans. After a spleen biopsy confirmed cancer\n\nin that organ, I began chemotherapy and remained in\n\nthe hospital for 13 days.\n\nThe most difficult part of my stay was not being able\n\nto see my wife or have visitors as part of the covid protocols. Fortunately, Gail and I and Dr. Robert Grossman had an early, three-way phone call where the\n\ndiagnosis and course of treatment were discussed in\n\ndetail and unanimity. Although the void of not being\n\nable to interact with loved ones can be terrible at\n\ntimes, let me offer unstinting praise to the professionals and support staff at Cooperman Barnabas for trying to cushion their absence.\n\nFrom the custodians to the food servers to the gurney\n\ntransporters, to the chaplaincy representatives (a rabbi\n\nwith a Shabbat kit, a Catholic layman with empathy), to\n\nthe nurses and on up to the physicians, an atmosphere\n\nof caring and concern predominated. I was fortunate\n\nenough to have a single, freshly remodeled room in the\n\noncology unit. While the medical regime was sometimes\n\ngrueling, the human interactions were always pleasant\n\nand often uplifting. As a patient, I never felt ignored or\n\nhad a request denied. All the praise directed at these\n\nfront-line responders, especially during the pandemic,\n\nstill doesnât do justice to their demanding tasks.\n\nFor the next several months, the rhythm and choices\n\nof my life will be dictated by my outpatient chemotherapy every three weeks. Each session lasts about\n\nsix hours when a mix of drugs is dripped or injected\n\ninto my body through a port implanted in my upper\n\nright chest. I will feel a bit queasy for three or four days\n\nbefore a normal feeling returns and lasts until it is time\n\nfor the next round. Three infusions completed, three\n\nto go. Since starting treatment, Iâve gained back weight\n\nand lost hair. For someone extremely proud of his full\n\nhead of gray matter (quite literally), the experience\n\nwas slightly disconcerting until I told my wife to take\n\nthe clippers and remove what little remained. Samson\n\nshorn? Hardly. But Iâve escaped baldness for so long that\n\nthe Daddy Warbucks look takes some getting used to.\n\nI feel fortunate and blessed for many reasons during\n\nthis transition, including family love and support,\n\nexcellent medical care and coverage, and encouragement of friends. I also feel a kinship with other cancer\n\npatients that bonds us in ways real and mystical that\n\nwere unimaginable just a few months ago. My doctors\n\nexpect an excellent outcome and Iâm going to hang my\n\nhat (which I now wear constantly) on that.\n\nJonathan E.

The main battle is\n\naround Mariupol,â where indiscriminate,\n\nunspeakably cruel attacks against civilians seem unending. âThe city is a key\n\nstrategic point. It is surrounded by the\n\nRussians, and heavily bombarded. The\n\nRussians are claiming that theyâve taken\n\nthe city, but the Ukrainians are saying\n\nthatâs not true. I think the Russians probably are lying; they show it on their news\n\nchannels, but in a way so that you see\n\nonly part of the city. That probably means\n\nthat they control only part of the city.â\n\nHeâs talking about television, which\n\nnow serves Russians some images of the\n\nwar. At the beginning, it showed nothing.\n\nNow, âthey show more and more pictures\n\nof destruction, the result of what they,â\n\nthe Russians, âare calling a special operation. They still donât use the word âwar.â\n\nThey show the destruction, but they say\n\nthat itâs the Ukrainian nationalists and\n\nneo-Nazis who are causing it.\n\nâBut at the same time, they talk about\n\nhow precisely they are operating.â\n\nWait. What?\n\nâAs it is well known by now, during\n\nthe last few days the Russians used\n\ntheir hypersonic, very modern missiles\n\ntwice.â Those are the Kinzhal missiles â\n\ndagger in English. âOn the news stations,\n\nthey said that âWe have to use these very\n\nexpensive but very precise weapons to\n\nprotect the civilians. We donât want to\n\nhurt them.ââ\n\nIn fact, Mr. Smukler said, Dmitry\n\nKiselev, one of Russiaâs premiere news\n\nanchors, used his Sunday night show,\n\nVesti Nedeli â thatâs News of the Week,\n\na much-watched Sunday night roundup\n\nâ to say, âI can show you examples of\n\nhow precisely our army is conducting\n\nspecial operations, by using these very\n\nexpensive, very precise weapons, these\n\nhypersonic missiles, to destroy military\n\nobjectives but not touch civilians.â\n\nThis is a change from what Russians\n\nhad been told. Until now, theyâd heard\n\nRefugees are greeted with\n\nhelp from around the world\n\nonce they leave Ukraine.\n\nP:25\n\nthat a quick special operation was going to liberate\n\nUkrainians from the tyranny of the drug-addled, corrupt neo-Nazis who were leading them. It would be\n\nover quickly and would be no big deal.\n\nThey canât say that anymore. Even though the government has forbidden any discussion of the war, there\n\nare too many ways for its people to find out about it â\n\ntoo many connections between Russians and Ukrainians, too many phone calls, too many dead soldiers â to\n\npretend that nothing at all is going on.\n\nThey also know that the truth â that the government\n\nis trying to bomb civilians into submission through\n\nwhat are basically brutal acts of state terrorism â would\n\nbe too much to bear. So they alter the truth.\n\nâNow Russians understand what âspecial operationsâ\n\nmeans,â Mr. Smukler said. âNow Russian TV shows\n\ntanks and missiles and helicopters and aircraft. But it\n\nkeeps saying âWe are liberating the civilian population,\n\nwhich was surrounded by Ukrainian nationalists.â\n\nâThey keep saying that Ukrainian nationalists are\n\nusing civilians as a shield, because we cannot hurt the\n\ncivilian population. That is why we have to start using\n\nthese very precise weapons, which are very expensive.\n\nWe use them to save lives.â\n\nâThe propaganda is so completely twisted from the\n\ntruth. They lie with every word. It is brainwashing.â\n\nThatâs not why the Russians are using those weapons,\n\nMr. Smukler said. âPutin wants to demonstrate to the\n\nworld, and to NATO, that he has these missiles. That he\n\ncan use them.\n\nâThere was no need to use them except to demonstrate to the Western world that he has them, and that\n\npotentially they could carry nuclear warheads.â\n\nThese missiles â the Daggers â âare Russiaâs newest\n\ninvention,â he continued. âThey first used them in Syria\n\nabout a year and a half ago, when Putin showed the\n\nworld that he had that kind of technology. As far as I\n\nknow, no one else in the world except the Chinese have\n\nthese kind of missiles â and there is zero protection\n\nagainst them.\n\nâThe United States already announced that they will\n\nhave similar missiles â but only by the end of 2023.\n\nâThis is a very important sign that the conflict is escalating during the last few days.â\n\nMr. Smukler gave some other examples of Russian\n\ntruth-twisting.\n\nâThey showed a picture of a destroyed apartment building in Mariupol. They say that nationalists\n\nexploded it from the inside. You see elderly women\n\ncoming out of the bomb shelter and show Russians\n\ngiving them water. But you can see that the building\n\nhasnât been exploded. Itâs still standing, and thereâs a\n\nhole in the middle of it.â It wasnât exploded by anyone\n\ninside the building. It was hit from the outside, by Russian missiles.\n\nâThey showed a large group of people in Ukrainian\n\nuniforms, who Russian soldiers were taking as prisoners. They showed a Russian journalist giving them a\n\nmicrophone, and some of them saying, âWe are here.\n\nWe are alive. They arenât beating us. They arenât torturing us.â\n\nâBut they are 17-, 18-year-old boys and 60-year-old\n\nmen. Men with gray hair and gray beards. They are 60\n\nyears old or older. They are my age, or older. They are\n\nnot the regular army.\n\nâThis is not the army. These are civiliansâ â too\n\nyoung or too old to be in the army â âwho are protecting their homes, their country, their land.\n\nâThese are grandfathers standing with their grandsons. They are wearing the uniforms of what is called\n\nterritorial defense. They basically took machine guns\n\nto protect their towns and their land, and the Russians made the big mistake of showing them as war\n\nprisoners.\n\nâIt means that everyone who could is fighting against\n\nthe invasion. These people are civilians who have been\n\ndefending their houses and their towns and their country. They were presented as captured warriors, but they\n\nare just regular citizens.\n\nâThrough the propaganda, you can see the face of\n\nthe real war.â\n\nMr. Smukler described the dilemma facing the Russians. âThey canât say nothing anymore. Itâs already\n\nbeen a month; itâs the longest military operation that\n\nRussia has had since the war in Chechnya.â\n\nJS-25\n\nJEWISH STANDARD MARCH 25, 2022 25\n\nCover Story\n\nDov Ben-Shimon, the executive vice president\n\nand CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater\n\nMetroWest NJ, also went on one of the JFNA\n\nmissions, and he drew what he saw.

We have\n\nnever had that before in our history.\n\nâThe church is one of the most\n\nimportant pillars holding up Putinâs\n\npower, and the church is playing such a\n\nsignificant role in Russian society today\n\nthat this is putting me in shock. They did\n\nnot raise their voices to support those\n\nwho are dying beneath Russian artillery and missiles. Those are the kids of\n\ntheir church. And they never raised their\n\nvoices to condemn it.\n\nâThis conflict is unusual. Usually, itâs\n\nSunnis against Shias, Christians against\n\nMuslims, Protestants against Catholics.\n\nYes, most of western Ukraine is Catholic, but right now most of the battles are\n\nin eastern Ukraine, and the people dying\n\nare mostly Russian Orthodox.\n\nâI keep expecting the church to say\n\nâGuys, stop this. We need to stop this.\n\nThese are the children of our church.â\n\nâBut they are never raising their\n\nvoices to say that. What kind of church\n\nis this?â\n\nMr. Smukler also talked about the refugee crisis Russiaâs war on Ukraine has\n\ncaused; his passion about it is not theoretical but comes from his own experiences as a refugee.\n\nâThis is the biggest and deepest refugee crisis in the world since World War\n\nII,â he said. âAbout 3.4 million people\n\nhave crossed Ukraineâs borders as refugees, and almost 14 million have been\n\ndisplaced â that means that they have\n\nhad to leave their homes and their towns\n\nand migrate to different parts of the\n\ncountry. Theyâre moving from the east\n\nto western Ukraine.\n\nâWe know that European countries\n\nare doing everything possible to accommodate these refugees and give them\n\ntemporary or permanent homes or\n\nplaces to stay.\n\nMost of them cross the border at three\n\nplaces, he explained.
