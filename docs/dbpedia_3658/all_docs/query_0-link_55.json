Like Ellery Queen an early follower of S.S. Van Dine, Abbot's books are distinguished by a wonderful plot complexity. Abbot is good at misdirection. The reader is encouraged to view subplots as having a certain significance, when in reality they point in an entirely different direction, one that is only revealed at the end of the story. This is perhaps related to the plotting technique sometimes used by pulp writers, in which so many actors are doing so many things that the reader is constantly misled about the real origins of every startling, new plot twist. (Please see my discussion of A Pulp Style of Plotting.)\n\nAbbot seems to have a natural liking for the complex plot. Even when he does a tongue-in-cheek short story that consciously combines humor and mystery, such as \"About the Perfect Crime of Mr. Digberry\", there is a delightful, well constructed mystery plot full of unexpected turns and complexity. Abbot's work also has the quality of \"readability\": they carry one along, and one can enjoy one of his books in a single sitting.\n\nAbbot's interest in misdirection can lead to vivid evocations of the difference between illusion and reality. Although Abbot does not conspicuously underline any philosophical implications of this theme, the strong plots cause this theme to emerge anyway. Abbot's fiction has a haunting quality. Both humans' ability to understand reality, and human life itself, seem frail and fragile. There is a note of pathos in his work, that seems autumnal, in contrast with Ellery Queen's springtime vigor. There is a sense of a last look at things, before they disappear into the mist.\n\nAnother contributor to this effect is Abbot's emphasis on the investigation of murder scenes. Described gently, and with delicate but powerful mise-en-scène, Abbot's vivid descriptions of houses, rooms, streets and yards show an architectural imagination at work.\n\nAbbot was deep into what might be called \"WASP Macho\". There is tremendous emphasis on his series hero Thatcher Colt's power and prestige as head of the police. He is also big on intimidating criminals. Abbot has really bought into ideas about leadership of social institutions equaling manhood and masculinity. Of course, this leadership was a privilege reserved in his day to WASPs, and one that they valued very highly. While there is no sign of prejudice against immigrants or other ethnic groups in Abbot, it is clear that he was deep into the social ideals of his own ethnic group, and felt that his hero should be a leader of men. Colt is the literary equivalent of the sympathetic, jut-jawed, well tailored men seated at big desks in big offices that showed up in so many 1930's movies (think of Walter Huston as the factory owner in Dodsworth).\n\nA Van Dine School Writer\n\nAbbot's detectival setup offers an intriguing variation on Van Dine's formula. In Van Dine, and in Ellery Queen as well, a genius amateur detective works closely with the New York Police as an unofficial, but highly respected, consultant. Each has a personal connection with officialdom: Van Dine's Philo Vance is a personal friend of the DA, and Ellery Queen is Police Inspector Richard Queen's son. In Abbot's books, the genius detective Thatcher Colt is himself the Police Commissioner, and his connection with the New York Police come about naturally as the head of police.\n\nThere is still a bit of \"amateur detective\" status about Colt: like Philo Vance, he is from a higher social stratum than most of the police, and the Police Commissioner's job is usually considered administrative and political, so Colt's involvement in solving actual cases is unusual, and the result of his rare personal abilities.\n\nJust as Vance is an art expert and connoisseur, Colt is an expert on literature, collecting rare books and writing poetry in his spare time. See About the Murder of Geraldine Foster (beginning of Chapter 2).\n\nAbbott wrote four Thatcher Colt detective novels in 1930 - 1932. They are especially Van Dine like in their tone, and in their detectival approach. He then paused for three years, without publishing any more Colts. During 1935 - 1943, he published four more Colt novels, at long intervals. These later novels are much less Van Dine like in tone, perhaps not surprising, in that Van Dine was no longer anywhere near as popular as in the early 1930's. They also contain much more about an Abbot enthusiasm of those years, psychic phenomena. (Mediums are also mentioned briefly in his first book About the Murder of Geraldine Foster (Chapter 1).)\n\nAbout the Murder of the Circus Queen\n\nAbout the Murder of the Circus Queen (1932) shows good storytelling and detail throughout its length, but its solution is routine. It is an interesting book, most notable for its elaborate Golden Age style description of the characters and their circus milieu, two bizarre murders, and the detailed investigation that follows, one that keeps bringing to light more and more clues, and more and more interrelationships among the characters' past lives. This fan of Golden Age fiction enjoyed reading it, but was disconcerted by its lack of a clever finale. The investigation forms an infinitely detailed design that is beautiful in its unfolding patterns. Circus is remarkably rich in visual imagery. It is almost as if Abbot had planned it as a movie; it was in fact made into one in the next year. Color is especially used to describe men's clothes and circus makeup. Abbot is much better at picking up on men's clothes, than on women's. Many of the men in the story also have brilliantly colored hair, such as the DA's red, and the scientist's yellow.\n\nAlthough it is not pointed out in the story, further reflection suggests that the novel's characters exist in doubles. The hero and heroine, a pair of married aerialists, employ a second couple of aerialists to assist them; they have even had this second couple change their stage names to match the husband's. Another pair of similar characters includes the circus' manager, and the circus' millionaire backer; both are older businessmen. The heroine employs both a personal maid, and a male assistant to help her with her act. Both the hero and heroine had a previous spouse. The District Attorney, a none too intelligent blunderer who is always wrong in the story, is accompanied by his two nephews, who seem to be miniature copies of himself.\n\nPerhaps the most striking pair of doubles in the book includes Thatcher Colt, and the witch doctor Keblia. Keblia is the leader of a tribe of Ubangis that have been imported to form an exhibit at the circus. Both Keblia and the Ubangis are sympathetic characters in the story. Just like Colt, Keblia plays the role of detective in the story. With the aid of his tribe, Keblia tracks down the real killer, and tries to intervene to protect the heroine. In fact, he finds the real killer long before Colt. Just as Colt is assisted by his \"tribe\" of policemen, Keblia is assisted by the tribe of Ubangis - another set of doubles in the story. Keblia is dressed in a fashionable suit in the story - a costume that in other Abbot works is strongly associated with the elegant Colt. The sophisticated Colt treats the Ubangis with the greatest respect. One striking scene shows a pact between Colt and the Ubangis to share information about clues to the mystery. Abbot's novel contrasts the respect with which his hero Colt treats the tribe, with the racist dismissal they are given by the low brow District Attorney in the book. The book's narrator falls somewhere between these two extremes in his attitude. While not sharing in the DA's contempt, he finds the Ubangis to be eerie and frightening. He clearly finds the strange and exotic to be threatening. The narrator is not supposed to be as intelligent and knowledgeable as Colt.\n\nThe treatment of the African Ubangis is progressive, especially for its day. They are depicted as both intelligent and kind hearted. Their religious ceremonies are depicted with dignity, although they are also milked for maximum eerie effect, like all the other events of the novel. The books portrayal of the Ubangis' social organization is in the \"tribal\" tradition, one that has roots in Jack London, and other turn of the century authors. Just as in London, the tribe is shown to be dominated by a witch doctor, and devoted to a set of superstitious rituals and beliefs. This portrayal of tribal life was very popular from 1900 through the 1940's. Today it seems old fashioned and out dated, having been replaced by more sophisticated anthropological ideas about tribal culture. Still, it seems to be the \"best\" model of tribal life available to literary authors of its day. Also dated today is the constant emphasis on how \"eerie\" the narrator finds the Ubangis. Despite this dated portrait of tribal life, Abbot's treatment of the Ubangis is clearly in the anti-racist tradition of Van Dine and other authors of his school. Please see my list of Civil Rights in Mystery Fiction, which includes a section on Van Dine School Writers.\n\nThe Ubangis are associated in the story with enclosed spaces: trunks and underground chambers. They are chthonic, and associated with the earth. The aerialists, by contrast, have there domain high in the air, on their trapeze wires, and in a high apartment. They have glittering clothing, and are associated with powder and greasepaint and gasses. The aerialists have a circle, a circus ring, under their domain, whereas both the Ubangis and Colt seem associated with rectilinear geometry. Colt keeps discovering boxes associated with the murder, the trunk and the box like room of the flood light chamber. Colt also seems to have a special affinity with Madison Square Garden itself, a building considered in the book as the last word in progressive modern accomplishment. It is made of concrete over a steel frame, and such hard construction seems symbolic of Colt. The trunk and the bunker like flood light chamber also seem rock hard constructions. Colt also owns Police Headquarters and his apartment. Colt's association with both modern buildings and modern organizations such as the police department and science are seen as emblems of a splendid masculinity.\n\nColt never actually climbs into the aerialists' trapeze area, whereas he has no trouble penetrating to the Ubangis' regions. He is the opener and discoverer of the Ubangis; he is always opening up their domains. He also brings in the professor who understands their language and customs, and serves as the professor's sponsor throughout the story.\n\nUnlike buildings, guns, bullets and shooting are associated not with the police in the novel, but with the older male authority figures of the circus: the animal trainer, the millionaire backer, and the circus owner. Such guns are seen only negatively as emblems of destruction, never of accomplishment. Colt instead works to outlaw guns; he is an enthusiastic advocate of gun control, as part of his role as Police Commissioner, and chief preventer of crime in New York City. The Ubangis also have the role of protectors of people and preventers of trouble, another affinity between Colt and the Ubangis.\n\nInstead of fighting, Colt's ability to see and perceive everything is emphasized. He is unusually good at sight, hearing, smell and the other senses. Colt is the one who hears the changes in the drum beat, for example. His senses are almost as heightened as the hero of the TV series, the Sentinel. He also has the brain power to interpret what he sees as clues. Colt also has a magnificent physique, as do the aerialists in the story.\n\nUnlike private eyes, Colt is rarely stonewalled by witnesses in the story. P I's are always spending hours grilling witnesses who refuse to talk, or who lie to them. By contrast, Colt, like the other detectives of the Van Dine school, has little trouble acquiring mountains of information. The Van Dine school sleuths have a number of techniques: they use the exhaustive search of both victims' rooms and crime scenes; they query disinterested passerby who have tons of information to share; and they institute resourceful police inquiries for information. Because of this, they are always purposively filling in their picture of the crime. It is only the murder itself that is an obstacle to the Van Dine school detective: it is always \"a carefully planned crime\" perpetrated by \"one of the most fiendish brains that it has ever been the misfortune of\" the narrator to encounter. Despite this satire, the Van Dine school's approach is plainly a lot more fun to read. Their detectives go right in and detect, and this is the way it should be.\n\nThe Shudders\n\nAbbot's The Shudders (1943) seems more like a horror novel than a mystery book. It has some plot twists, but they are not imaginative enough to make the book fascinate the average mystery fan. The book does show plot complexity. Many of the scenes display considerable mise-en-scène as well.\n\nImages of ruination recur throughout the novel:\n\nMalaria on a tropical expedition.\n\nA visit to the fleabags of 42nd Street.\n\nMost remarkable is the ruined greenhouse (end of Chapter 3, Chapter 4).\n\nThe Shudders repeats imagery from Abbot's About the Murder of the Circus Queen (1932):\n\nThe death that results from a drop from a high place.\n\nExplorers who travel in the tropics, looking for rare chemical knowledge: in The Shudders, New Guinea; in Circus, Equatorial Africa.\n\nBoth encounter an extremely colorful group of aboriginal people: the Dyaks in Shudders, the Ubangi in Circus.\n\nThe possibility of killing someone at a distance, without leaving any traces.\n\nHome movies, that are projected in a private dwelling.\n\nMen dressed up in white tie and tails. (White tie is also worn by Thatcher Colt in About the Murder of the Night Club Lady. And please see my list of characters in white tie and tails.)\n\nBoth open on a rainy night of Friday the Thirteenth, and both contain much horror imagery.\n\nBoth describe Colt's army of police recurring characters in detail, making them part of the plot. These recurring police characters are part of the Van Dine tradition.\n\nLife histories of the suspects, exploring their professional and romantic lives in great detail.\n\nA background of the chemical industry. And references to Germany's involvement with the same.\n\nAn apartment, which people enter and leave through a high window.\n\nA romantic triangle of sorts, with a younger couple, and an older man of considerable wealth, and dubious morals.\n\nImages of death are often linked to those of rebirth, both in the body in the trunk in the opening of Chapter 10 of Circus, and in the solution of Shudders.\n\nMany of the male characters seem to be in trouble in Abbot's books; this emotional mood probably subconsciously reflects the real life general vulnerability of men during the Depression, who were often unemployed and lacking in prospects.\n\nSPOILERS. One villain in The Shudders is a Uriah Heep type. He worms his way into a position as confidential secretary to a millionaire banker, takes over his life, and promptly murders him for his money. Although the author does not point this out, this seems to exaggerate and parody the relationship between Thatcher Colt and his secretary, the Watson-like narrator of the Colt novels. The narrator is a born number two, who owes his entire existence to being Colt's secretary.\n\nWhy does Abbot include scenes of home movies in his books? This is hard to say. He is certainly not sneaking clues into the stories with them, as John Dickson Carr would be. One reason is that Abbot is a writer interested in high technology and scientific detection, and during the 1930's such movies partook of high tech. Also, it allows him to show highlights of his characters' past lives, always an Abbot interest. Most importantly, however, is the structural role these scenes play in Abbot's architecture. Abbot's books are marked off into distinct episodes, like movements in a piece of classical music. Introducing an episode narrated in a distinct fashion, through film, allows Abbot to build a fence around one part of the narrative. Each episode plays its own unique role in the design of the book. They add to the beauty of the overall pattern. Similarly, in Circus, there is a stretch in Chapter 16 in which Colt reports on the results of his officer Inspector Flynn's investigations into the characters' backgrounds. This forms a deeply satisfying extension of the book's plot to date, offering a formal conclusion to several plot threads in the book. Its position in the story seems like a sort of coda in music, or other part of a formal pattern.\n\nAbout the Disappearance of Agatha King: a short story\n\n\"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" (1932) is a well-done short story. It was reprinted in a 1939 anthology, The Mystery Book. This story cries out for reprinting today.\n\n\"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" looks as it it got its basic framework from the Sherlock Holmes tale \"The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor\" (1892) by Doyle. Abbot has added to this framework a wealth of original ideas.\n\nMystery Plot. Even in this short story, Abbot keeps to his traditions by having both life histories for his characters, and a detailed look at their complex relationships. Part of the mystery plot grows out of these relationships.\n\nPro-Civil Rights. \"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" has a pro-Civil Rights theme. Like About the Murder of the Circus Queen it takes a positive look related to black people. SPOILERS. \"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" criticizes bigoted police for beating up blacks, and the justice system for condoning this. Please see my list of Civil Rights in Mystery Fiction, which includes a section on Van Dine School Writers.\n\n\"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" also has a white man suspect, who is described as loving a male friend. This might well be a gay reference. The story certainly sees the love as positive.\n\nImagery. Imagery in \"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" recalls About the Murder of the Night Club Lady:\n\nBoth have heroines guarded, in a building, by a group of policemen, against a threat.\n\nBoth have women elegantly dressed in white. Agatha King is in her white wedding gown.\n\nBoth contrast this with men in formal wear. In \"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" these are daytime cutaways.\n\nBoth have policemen undercover in fancy clothes.\n\nThe hotel room in \"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" and the penthouse in About the Murder of the Night Club Lady are linked to women characters.\n\nAbout the Murder of the Night Club Lady\n\nImpossible Crime: Killing at a Distance. About the Murder of the Night Club Lady (1931) has an original impossible crime. This impossibility is the best part of this work. The impossible crime has aspects of the \"how-done-it\": it asks the detective and reader to figure out a method by which a seemingly impossible murder occurred. Such how-done-its were also a staple in Van Dine and Stuart Palmer.\n\nThe how-done-it crime is another example of \"killing someone at a distance, without leaving any traces\": an Abbot tradition. This is also found in About the Murder of the Circus Queen and The Shudders, two Abbot novels that share much imagery with Night Club Lady, and which are often close to it in approach.\n\nAbbot's how-done-it solution brings the novel into the realm of the scientific detective story. So do some other aspects of police lab work. Several of Abbot's tales involve such scientific and technological details - it is a running strand throughout his fiction.\n\nThe impossible crime is framed within a situation derived from Edgar Wallace's The Four Just Men (1905) - a ploy that has been much used in films and comics ever since Wallace invented it. Abbot's explanation of the impossible crime is different from Wallace's, however. There is also little in About the Murder of the Night Club Lady of anything political, while Wallace's book is soaked in social commentary.\n\nImpossible Appearance. The final quarter of the book, after the explanation of the how-done-it three quarters way through (Chapter 13), is anticlimactic, and not as successful as the previous three quarters of the novel. Its plot elements are mainly less interesting than those that went before.\n\nWe do get a solution to a second impossible mystery: where was someone hiding in the penthouse, despite not turning up during a very through search by Thatcher Colt? (posed end of Chapter 7, solved last part of Chapter 19). This sort of mystery can be dubbed an Impossible Appearance: somebody or something appears where it cannot possibly be, the way this person turns up in the penthouse.\n\nErle Stanley Gardner's The Bigger They Come (1939) has the Impossible Appearance of a guest inside a watched hotel: a similar problem to Abbot's impossible appearance inside a penthouse. Its solution is quite different, however. In Gardner's The Case of the Singing Skirt (1959) (Chapters 5 - 6), Perry Mason engineers the Impossible Appearance of a gun.\n\nThe \"impossible\" appearance of the character in About the Murder of the Night Club Lady (end of Chapter 7) has elements of the Surrealism that runs through Abbot and many other detective writers.\n\nImpossible crimes aside, About the Murder of the Night Club Lady shows less colorful storytelling, and less imagination its plotting, characters and setting, than the best of Abbot's writing.\n\nImagery. Its night-club opening scene, and the Night Club Lady's penthouse apartment where most of the action occurs, while well described, are hardly novel settings for crime fiction. Both seem like female settings, elaborate ornate boxes that contain entire lives of the heroine and her female relatives and friends. These womb symbols are constantly contrasted with the male police officers and their masculine and phallic symbols, with Thatcher Colt in top hat and tails, uniformed officers on motorcycles, a policeman undercover in doorman's uniform recalling a 19th Century \"chausseur\", etc. The women are in white, with occasional flashes of red, while the men are in dark colors such as Colt's black tail coat or blue police uniforms. White tie and tails are a tradition in Abbot books.\n\nThe glittering night-club is full of mirrors, crystals and jewels. The night-club is a real-life location of the era: The Mayfair Club and Crystal Room inside the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Manhattan. The novel says it was filled with show biz celebrities.\n\nHeights and Underground. The night-club is underground; the penthouse is high in the sky: two extremes that will re-appear in About the Murder of the Circus Queen. The penthouse has a high window playing a role in the plot, not unlike other Abbot books.\n\nThe penthouse's address on East 58th street places it in or near the Manhattan neighborhood Sutton Place. Sutton Place is explored in depth in About the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress.\n\nHelen Reilly explores a Manhattan penthouse in McKee of Centre Street (1933) (Chapter 7). Reilly is more interested in the rooftop outside the penthouse, while Abbot emphasizes the interior. Colt does do a thorough exploration of the roof. however.\n\nThe sleuths briefly meet at the club room at the very top of the real-life Chrysler Building skyscraper (start of Chapter 15). The narrator gives a negative review, saying the views have been ruined by obstructions. Other real-life New York skyscrapers appear in Abbot: the RCA building in Rockefeller Center in About the Murder of a Man Afraid of Women, Tudor City in About the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress.\n\nPolicewoman. Policewoman Dorothy Lox appears and is treated respectfully (Chapters 3, 14). Lox is mentioned again in About the Murder of a Man Afraid of Women (Chapter 2.1), as part of a description of New York City's policewomen as a whole. And she appears in person in that book (Chapter 9.2). Today's readers would likely welcome an Abbot tale with a policewoman protagonist, but I don't know of one.\n\nEarlier (Chapter 1) when Colt is cornered by some women and asked questions, one is \"whether women were of any account as detectives.\" We don't get his response. But clearly the Dorothy Lox sections are answering the question in the affirmative. This scene shows Abbot was conscious of the public's interest in women detectives. And specifically the female part of the public.\n\nDoubles. The two young women in Night Club Lady have plot-lines that move in parallel: they are perhaps examples of the doubling characters that will appear more systematically in About the Murder of the Circus Queen.\n\nAbbot Subjects. Abbot once more features life histories of the characters, that play a role in the solution.\n\nWhile other Abbot books such as About the Murder of the Circus Queen and The Shudders, open on Friday the Thirteenth in a rain storm, this one is set on New Year's Eve in a snow storm. The male characters are once again in deep trouble. While those books refer to the chemical industry, and have ties to Germany, this one is set against the medical supply business, and refers to the characters' past lives in France.\n\nThe Men Higher-Up. About the Murder of the Night Club Lady depicts a jewel theft ring and secretly being controlled by well-to-do, apparently respectable men (first part of Chapter 1). They are referred to as the \"men higher-up\". Similarly About the Murder of a Man Afraid of Women depicts a sinister drug pushing syndicate that is controlled by such wealthy higher-ups (Chapter 1.1). The book makes it clear that there is moral rot in at least some members of the upper classes.\n\nLong before this William MacHarg & Edwin Balmer's \"The Man Higher Up\" (1909) posited finding such higher-ups as a key goal of detective work.\n\nAbout the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress\n\nAbout the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress (1931) is perhaps a bit over praised among Abbot's work. The book is readable throughout. It is at its vivid best in its opening (Chapters 1-4), in which Colt identifies the unknown corpses, and reconstructs the murder events at the crime scenes. These sections show good detective work, much of it based in scientific detection by the police. They also display Abbot's gift for architectural writing, and his command of atmosphere and mise-en-scène.\n\nThe later stages of the novel do show Abbot's ability to handle a complex plot, and the final revelations about the crime do surprise.\n\nTrue Crime. The novel's second paragraph points out its resemblance to two famous real-life cases: the Hall-Mills murders (1922) and the Clarence Richeson case (1911). In fact, the novel's main plot (which emerges after the opening chapters) can be seen as a mildly ingenious fusing of these two cases. SPOILERS:\n\nThe book's murder mystery resembles the Hall-Mills case.\n\nThe novel uses the Richeson case to help provide an unexpected solution to the mystery. This solution (Chapter 17) also has elements of ingenuity that come out of Abbot's head, rather than deriving from true crime cases.\n\nThe part of the novel that draws on these two murder cases the least is the opening (Chapters 1-4). This opening is the most creative part of the novel.\n\nI tend to be skeptical about using real-life murder cases as a basis for mystery fiction. I think mystery fiction tends to be better when writers use their own imagination, rather than drawing on \"true crime\". The best aspects of About the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress occur when Abbot uses his imagination rather than true crime, as in the opening, and in the ingenious aspects of the solution.\n\nSutton Place. Sangster Terrace, a fictitious setting for a scene of the crime, is explicitly said to resemble the famous real life Manhattan neighborhood Sutton Place (Chapter 3). Sangster Terrace is said to be adjacent to Sutton Place. Essentially, Sangster Terrace is simply an imaginary addition to the real life Sutton Place.\n\nThe book notes that the Sangster Terrace / Sutton Place neighborhood joins the extremes of wealth and poverty. Precisely this same characteristic of contrasting wealth and poverty would soon make Sidney Kingsley choose Sutton Place as the setting for his famous play Dead End (1935). Dead End made Sutton Place the archetypical setting that symbolizes Inequality. About the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress made the same observation four years before Dead End.\n\nSutton Place symbolizes privilege in Mr. Smith's Hat (1936) and Dead Man Control (1936) by Helen Reilly, where it contains police \"Commissioner Carey's tall narrow house\". And in Murder in a Hurry (1950) by the Lockridges, with its wealthy family's home.\n\nTudor City. Tudor City, where the bodies are first found (Chapters 1, 3), is a real residential complex in Manhattan. It was brand new in 1931. It is upscale, like the fictitious Sangster Terrace.\n\nColor. Sangster Terrace has doors painted in bright colors, \"in the new manner\" as the book calls it. The murder house in Sangster Terrace has a red door: something repeatedly referred to in the book, including its last line. These anticipates the green Manhattan doors in Murder in the Mews (1931) and Murder in Shinbone Alley (1940) by Helen Reilly.\n\nOther pieces of color imagery in About the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress:\n\nThe boat is newly painted green. Later, traces of green paint show where the boat was painted. Green is the color of life, and the boat contains both a cat and a tree leaf as clues.\n\nThe morgue room is in white and blue tile (Chapter 2).\n\nHeight and Underground. Two rooms are contrasted in the Sangster Terrace house. One is upstairs; the the other is at ground level. These are not quite the high in the sky / underground chambers found in other Abbot books - but they approach this effect.\n\nTwo different underground tunnels play a role in the opening. Since they are near real places, the morgue and Tudor City, these tunnels might be real-life places.\n\nTudor City consists of skyscraper apartments, in fact the world's first skyscraper apartments. It is very much \"high in the sky\". However, we do not go inside Tudor City in the book.\n\nSurrealism: The Boat. There is a surrealistic feel to Colt's having the entire boat picked up and moved inside the morgue. Boats are supposed to be outside - not indoors.\n\nThis fate of the boat is soon echoed by it origin. We learn that the boat was built inside a fancy house in Sangster Terrace. Once again, the boat does not belong indoors such a house.\n\nOn both occasions, the boat with the corpses inside, was carried by men. Such a \"carting of a container with a body\" also appears in \"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" and About the Murder of a Startled Lady.\n\nCurrents. Colt does some detective reasoning based on water currents (Chapter 3). Please see my list of detection involving Currents in mystery fiction.\n\nDoubles. Abbot books sometimes have characters whose lives parallel each other. In Clergyman's Mistress such \"doubles\" include Bessie Struber and murder victim Evelyn Saunders.\n\nAlternatives to Capitalism. Most locales in the opening stand outside of the capitalist system and market economy:\n\nThe river where the bodies are found is public property.\n\nThe police drive past an expansion under construction of Bellevue Hospital.\n\nThe rectories being searched belong to churches.\n\nThe morgue dock, tunnel, building and old Morgue are city property.\n\nWelfare Island, the city-owned home of hospitals, is mentioned. (It is now Roosevelt Island).\n\nThe Arsenal is now a police station, and is the office of the City Forrester.\n\nSutton Place has new co-op apartments, mentioned in its description.\n\nThe \"communal lawn\" at Sangster Terrace is cooperatively run by all the tenants, and they employ watchmen (last part of Chapter 3).\n\nWe hear about the New York State Association of Police Chiefs, presumably a nonprofit.\n\nMost of the people met in the opening are either police, other city employees, or the collectively-employed night watchman. There is also the clergyman victim, who works for a church. All of these men are employed outside of the capitalist system.\n\nBy contrast the actual murder house in Sangster Terrace is very much private property. This house is part of the market economy: it has been rented out. And Tudor City is also capitalistic: we hear briefly about the ballyhoo used to promote it.\n\nPlease see my list of Cooperatives and Worker-owned Businesses in mystery and science fiction.\n\nThe Church. Abbot will return to a setting of this novel, the (fictitious) Church of St. Michael and All Angels in New York, for his fine short story, \"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" (1932). There are many real-life Anglican / Episcopalian churches named St. Michael and All Angels, especially in England - but none of them are in New York City.\n\nAbout the Murder of a Startled Lady\n\nStructure. About the Murder of a Startled Lady (1935) shows relationships with Abbot's earlier novels, especially About the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress (1931). Both books begin with the discovery of an unidentified corpse under mysterious circumstances. Several chapters of virtuosic detective work follow, during which Colt and nearly the entire New York City police force identify the victim. In both of these novels the opening chapters are sinister, even spooky in tone, with a macabre feel. The macabre quality is pushed to an extreme in Startled Lady.\n\nAfter these excellent opening sections in Clergyman's Mistress and Startled Lady, virtually a whole new novel begins. For the first time we meet the characters of the mystery story. Up till that time we had been dealing with a discovered body, vividly described murder locations, and the police. Now we are introduced to the suspects, and a whole, conventional murder mystery ensues, with most of the focus on the motives of the suspects and their personal relationships with the victim. These later chapters in both novels are far more routine. There is much less actual detection, and what revelations ensue tend to be the result of routine police inquiries: realistic, but not very imaginative. Towards the end of both stories Colt builds a straw case against each of the characters in turn. Both books also come to a similar kind of solution to their puzzle plot, although to say more about this would spoil the reader's interest in the mystery.\n\nSubjects. The opening of About the Murder of a Startled Lady also shows subject matter links to Clergyman's Mistress. Both:\n\nOpen with Colt at or near his office at police headquarters in Centre Street.\n\nOpen at night: a hot June evening in Clergyman's Mistress, an icy winter in Startled Lady.\n\nHave a similar plan for disposal of the body: hacking it up and dumping it offshore. This plan is interrupted in Clergyman's Mistress, carried out in Startled Lady.\n\nInclude a fictitious place: Sangster Terrace in Clergyman's Mistress, Fairland Beach in Long Island in Startled Lady.\n\nReference unusual trees: Ailanthus altissima, the Tree of Heaven has a big role in Clergyman's Mistress, Aquilaria which produces aloes wood is mentioned briefly in Startled Lady.\n\nMention Colt's small ivory statue of the head of Homer, that he keeps in his office.\n\nHigh and Low. The diving for the body has a chthonic feel (Book One: Chapter 2). It is underwater, although not underground.\n\nThe medium's room in the rooming house is high on the third floor (Book Two: Chapter 4).\n\nCharacters. The opening chapters of Startled Lady are full of people with a show business background: the sort of cheap entertainers that might hang around carnivals or fair grounds. There are the medium and her husband in the first chapter, then the artist with a waxworks and amusement park life history in Chapter 3. These people's colorful life stories recall the circus performers in Circus Queen (1932). The professor in Chapter 1 of Startled Lady also recalls the savant Colt meets in Circus Queen.\n\nAbbot likes to include a whole \"life history\" for the characters in his novels. While it is not likely in real life that the police would have thumb nail biographies for everyone they meet, one tends to accept this as a bit of poetic license. It does add to the storytelling charm of the book, as well as making the characters more rounded.\n\nUnfortunately, after its early sections, Startled Lady declines into a far more ordinary novel. Most of the suspects in the later part of the book are unpleasant, even psychologically abnormal. Much of the book is taken up with descriptions of their emotionally disturbed personalities. There is also a consistent tone of sordidness struck throughout, something that is not typical of Abbot, and not consistent with the personality shown in his other works.\n\nMystery Plot. The best section in the later part of the novel is Book Two: Chapter 4. This resolves the medium subplot of the opening chapter. Abbot shows a flair for one type of impossible crime, the apparent supernatural event. Abbot does not describe the kind of physical impossibility we associate with G.K. Chesterton, John Dickson Carr and their successors. Instead, this tale is in the same genre as Craig Rice's \"Beyond the Shadow of a Dream\" (1956), a case of apparently supernatural knowledge that eventually is explained in realistic terms. Please see my list of Dreams and Premonitions: Impossible Crimes.\n\nThis section is architectural, something also found elsewhere in Abbot.\n\nAbout the Murder of Geraldine Foster\n\nAbout the Murder of Geraldine Foster (1930) is Abbot's first Thatcher Colt book.\n\nParadoxically, while Abbot idolized men in leadership positions, his fiction is more rooted in middle class life than are most other authors of the Golden Age. This is especially true of the non-police characters in his tales. The investigation into the death of Geraldine Foster reveals a poignant look at the stresses and strains in the life of a young, middle class woman of the period. Similarly, \"ordinary man\" Mr. Digberry's survival and even triumph in \"About the Perfect Crime of Mr. Digberry\" suggests an allegory of the survival and triumph of the middle classes.\n\nIf Abbot's work reflects contemporary pulp techniques of the 1920's and 1930's, it looks backward to the scientific detectives of 1905-1914. About the Murder of Geraldine Foster (1930) digresses from its main mystery to offer a full portrait of \"high tech\" police techniques. These seem oddly similar to those of Cleveland L. Moffett and Arthur B. Reeve of twenty years earlier.\n\nCrime Scenes. About the Murder of Geraldine Foster shares crime scene settings and clues with the later About the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress. SPOILERS. Both have:\n\nBlood-stained animals near the crime scene, who got that way through contact with the victims.\n\nAn informative note by the victim.\n\nFinding the Manhattan house where the murder took place is a simple matter of following up a note found at a crime scene in About the Murder of Geraldine Foster. It involves sophisticated Scientific Detection in About the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress.\n\nThe house is rented in both books, from its older woman owner.\n\nThe house served as a love nest, and is otherwise deserted.\n\nThe house is in an interesting Manhattan neighborhood.\n\nAlmost no one is actually in residence nearby the murder house.\n\nBoth novels open at Thatcher Colt's office.\n\nThe visits to the murder houses are among the best scenes in both novels.\n\nMinorities and Leftists. This first book in the series About the Murder of Geraldine Foster is also the debut of some continuing supporting characters. Police Captain Israel Henry is in charge of the Commissioner's office suite, and serves as what we now call a \"gatekeeper\" (Chapter 1). Does his first name Israel signify he is Jewish? I am not sure. He is certainly a sympathetic character, always depicted positively in the Colt books.\n\nA passage (first part of Chapter 2) mentions Manhattan's Lower East Side, and cites real-life novelists Fannie Hurst and Nat Ferber as depicting its Jewish inhabitants. Fannie Hurst is still well-known, but Nat J. Ferber has sunk into obscurity. Reviews of the era suggest Nat Ferber was an example of \"Naturalism\", and downbeat. He was also a journalist, and married to the left-wing labour organizer Marie Ganz.\n\nA fictional character in About the Murder of Geraldine Foster is a radical left-wing lawyer, George Maskell (Chapter 1). He is described as having worked with famous real-life left-wing lawyers Clarence Darrow and Arthur Garfield Hays.\n\nThatcher Colt himself is compared to Teddy Roosevelt (start of Chapter 1). Although the book does not say so, Roosevelt was famous as a champion of the Progressive movement.\n\nLeft-of-center writers Theodore Dreiser and W. Adolphe Roberts get a positive mention in About the Murder of a Man Afraid of Women (start of Chapter 4.1). However, the book cites them for their accomplishments as writers, and does not mention their political activities.\n\nThe Creeps\n\nThe Creeps (1939) seems written in a different style from several of Abbot's earlier books, and critic Francis M. Nevins has speculated that it may have been ghost written by a different author. That may be true. However, it has a \"supernatural\" scene where a medium claims to be in contact with a dead person. The ghostly message is very similar in content to the one in About the Murder of a Startled Lady, a book that everyone has always considered as Abbot's own. The two novels share a similar fascination with psychical research as well. The tone of both novels mix skepticism with enthusiasm. Abbot considers many practitioners of such studies frauds, yet seems enthused about the long term prospect of honest researchers in these fields. I cannot agree with him. I think the evidence sixty years later suggests that this is all a bunch of hooey. Be that as it may, this material suggests a continuity of authorship.\n\nThe book has some sordid imagery, which recalls the also sleazy Startled Lady.\n\nThe country house setting of The Creeps differs from the Manhattan locales emphasized in previous Colt novels.\n\nThe Creeps lacks all ingenuity. The explanation of the medium's message shows none of the cleverness of the earlier novel. None of the murders in the books show any cleverness either. The story is labored and dull.\n\nAbout the Murder of a Man Afraid of Women\n\nAbout the Murder of a Man Afraid of Women (1937) is Abbot's least known Thatcher Colt book, rarely reprinted. And with good reason. The plot is largely reworked from a well-known tale by Doyle. And the book relentlessly flaunts racial stereotypes, in a way that is thankfully absent from Abbot's other books, which usually present positive pictures of racial minorities.\n\nGood Parts. This unsuccessful book does have some good features:\n\nPortraits of police organization in New York City are well-done, and extend the depictions in previous Colt novels (Chapters 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.3). These accounts are sometimes almost documentary or non-fiction in form, embedded in the otherwise fictional novel. They include descriptions of technology used by the police.\n\nThe readable storytelling, with Abbot's pleasing profusion of detail.\n\nThe subplot about Tad Wing is not bad (Chapters 1.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.8, 14.4). SPOILERS. Like \"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" this involves an Impossible Disappearance from a watched building. However, the solution is simpler and much less creative than \"Agatha King\". Both tales also have mysteries about what clothes the person is wearing when they disappeared.\n\nThe police organization sections (36 pages) and the Tad Wing episodes (29 pages) make up a relatively small part of the book as a whole (293 pages). One wishes that Abbot had published them as a separate novella. The Tad Wing episodes, in particular, have little to do with the rest of the novel.\n\nSecretary. The heroine Carol Burgess is a secretary, like the title character in About the Murder of Geraldine Foster. In both cases their employers are dubious people, who may or may not be involved in crime.\n\nGun Control. Colt speaks out in favor of what we now call gun control (Chapter 1.1).\n\nDoubles. Abbot books sometimes have characters whose lives parallel each other. SPOILERS. In About the Murder of a Man Afraid of Women, first Tad Wing disappears. Then Thatcher Colt disappears too (Chapter 3.5, 3.6). The parallels are emphasized in the narration.\n\nHeight. Abbot likes settings high up in architecture.\n\nThe victim has offices on the forty-first floor of the RCA building in Rockefeller Center (start of Chapter 2.3). Like Tudor City in About the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress this is a famous real-life skyscraper, that was new at the time of writing.\n\nThe Tad Wing subplot takes place on the top floor of a six-story walkup apartment building. This recalls the rooming house in About the Murder of a Startled Lady (Book Two: Chapter 4).\n\nA real-life landmark, the Jefferson Market Police Court with its clock tower, is mentioned (start of Chapter 4.1).\n\nThe murder scene is on the third floor of another apartment building (Chapter 4.1). Once again a high window of the apartment, plays a role in the plot.\n\nGreenwich Village Back Streets. This murder scene is on Nightcourt Lane in Greenwich Village. Nightcourt Lane is a fictitious back street which the book says resembles a nearby real-life one, Patchin Place (start of Chapter 4.1). This mixture of reality and fiction recalls About the Murder of the Clergyman's Mistress, with its fictitious Sangster Terrace resembling and nearby the real Sutton Place.\n\nPatchin Place has ten buildings. Its street numbers simply range from 1 to 10. Similarly the murder scene building in Nightcourt Lane is Number Ten (start of Chapter 4.1). The buildings in Patchin Place have three stories; those in fictional Nightcourt Lane have three stories plus an attic (Chapters 4.1, 9.5).\n\nThe visit to Greenwich Village brings back nostalgic memories for the narrator Tony, who recalls knowing Theodore Dreiser and Harold Hersey there (start of Chapter 4.1). In real life these writers lived in Patchin Place, according to the Wikipedia. Harold Hersey knew Anthony Abbot and Theodore Dreiser.\n\nGreenwich Village back streets are featured in Helen Reilly novels: Murder in the Mews (1931), All Concerned Notified (1939), Murder in Shinbone Alley (1940). Such tiny back streets, almost concealed from public view, are fascinating. Reilly's treatment is more elaborate that Abbot's.\n\nC. Daly King\n\nC. Daly King's work is clearly aligned to the S.S. Van Dine school. He published six novels and a story collection from 1932 - 1940. After World War II, he published two new stories in EQMM; in the intro to one of them, Ellery Queen mentioned that a new King novel had been finished and would soon be appearing. This book was never published; it is another evidence of the deliberate suppression of the traditional detective story after 1945 by publishers. Mary Roberts Rinehart could not get her detective tales published in the Saturday Evening Post, nor could T.S. Stribling; Milton M. Propper could not get his books published, and eventually wound up in an insane asylum; Hake Talbot's third novel was not published, apparently leading him to write no more; Norbert Davis had publishing difficulties; Dorothy Sayers and Anthony Boucher largely chose not to write any more detective stories; John Dickson Carr turned to a series of anemic historical novels. Recently, in Twentieth Century Mystery Writers, Helen McCloy regretted that she had written fewer mystery novels and more suspense novels after World War II.\n\nCommentary on C. Daly King:\n\nWilliam F. Deeck's article on Obelists at Sea is at Mystery*File.\n\nPietro De Palma's articles on King are at Death Can Read.\n\nMartin Edwards' articles on King are at Do You Write Under Your Own Name?.\n\nNoah Stewart's article on Obelists at Sea is at Noah's Archives.\n\nA bibliography can be found at the Golden Age of Detection Wiki.\n\nThe Curious Mr. Tarrant\n\nThe Curious Mr. Tarrant is a collection of stories, most of which deal with impossible crimes. They star detective Trevis Tarrant, who appeared mainly in King's short stories; Michael Lord was the series detective in many King novels. Tarrant would later appear in The Episode of the Demoiselle D'Ys (1946), the above mentioned unpublished novel. I have no idea if the manuscript survives; the manuscript of Hake Talbot's third book seems permanently lost, for example.\n\nImagery and Settings. King's work is full of horror. He likes to depict bizarre religious rituals as part of his horror atmosphere. These rituals often seem to involve cycles of time: the Aztec cycles in \"The Codex' Curse\", the repetitions of the Requiem in \"The Nail and the Requiem\", the nightly events on the highway in \"The Headless Horrors\". Light and darkness, and their alteration are also important elements in King's storytelling, adding both drama, and contributions to the puzzle plots.\n\nKing's impossible crime technique seems to focus on hidden places and hidden spaces. Although presided over by images of women, never living women, men seem to emerge from these spaces, or be swallowed up by them. The images of women are naked, and emphasize their sexuality. Perhaps these hidden spaces are womb symbols. They also seem to have a magic or ritual quality to them.\n\nThere is also a theme of \"policemen in jeopardy\", that seems to involve their uniforms. King seemed to have a special sympathy for these \"hard young men\", as he put it, and their lives seem to be in danger in his tales.\n\nAnother set of perennial characters in King are the mild mannered, ineffectual authority figures of various institutions where the horror is taking place, who have clearly lost control of their turf. These include the museum director in \"Codex\", the apartment manager in \"Nail\", and the police chief in \"Headless Horrors\".\n\nInfluences. One of the best locked room tales in The Curious Mr. Tarrant, \"The Episode of the Nail and the Requiem\" (1935), oddly anticipates The Silence of the Lambs, of all things. The mad killer's escape from the box-like penthouse in King, seems oddly similar to Hannibal's escape from his box-like cage toward the end of the movie (I've never read the book).\n\nKing's tale, in turn, bears a family resemblance to MacKinlay Kantor's \"The Light at Three O'Clock\" (1930). Other possible influences on King's fiction are discussed in the articles on Stuart Palmer and Sax Rohmer.\n\nCharacters: Golden Age Standard. Several of the characters are fairly standard types in Golden Age mystery fiction.\n\nKing's horror motif contrasts oddly with the country club, fun young couples background of his Watson, Jerry Phelan. Phelan, his girlfriend, and his sister, who winds up dating detective Tarrant, seem right out of the world later to be occupied by such Bright Young Couples as seen in the works of Patrick Quentin, or The Norths, by the Lockridges. \"The Episode of the Tangible Illusion\" (1935) does much to characterize Phelan and his family, and has some pleasant romance. It is set in a small town in New Jersey; King himself lived in Summit, New Jersey, and frequently set his works either in that state, or in nearby New York City.\n\nNot all of King is horror based. \"The Episode of the Vanishing Harp\" is a country house, Golden Age style mystery, complete with a wealthy couple, the family secretary, the family banker, and the family physician. This is a standard Golden Age cast of characters. \"Harp\" is a pleasant enough piece of storytelling. But its locked room problem's solution, while fair and believable, is easily guessed. This tale is well-liked by a number of mystery fans, so perhaps I'm underestimating it a little.\n\nA early section of \"The Episode of the Vanishing Harp\" details Tarrant's interests in science and the arts. This seems modeled, broadly speaking, on Philo Vance's intellectual interests in S.S. Van Dine novels. Both men are presented as genius sleuths with a wide range of deep intellectual passions. Tarrant's readings in modern physics recall the Vance novel The Bishop Murder Case (1928). Please see my list of mysteries about Energy, Oil, Power and Physics.\n\nStrengths and Weaknesses. King is far from being my favorite author. Just as in Clayton Rawson, there is something distasteful about King. King's strongest suit is his ability to create suspense. His better tales sweep one along as a reader, and show some real excitement, as well as some creepiness in the horror department.\n\nBut they often turn upon clichés, sometimes including the disagreeable ethnic stereotypes of their era: \"The Headless Horrors\" and \"The Man with Three Eyes\" both suffer from racism. This racism is especially unfortunate in the case of \"The Headless Horrors\", spoiling a tale which otherwise has interesting aspects.\n\nSeveral of the tales' mystery plots are obvious, and easily figured out. There is often only one real suspect, and sure enough, at the end he did it - not much of a use of the whodunit potential of the mystery tale. \"The Episode of the Nail and the Requiem\", however, succeeds as a puzzle plot tale - it is a significant contribution to the locked room story.\n\nBy contrast, King's version of the Mary Celeste, \"Torment IV\", is ridiculous, one of the all time dumb mystery tales. Caveat lector! (Which could mean either \"Let the reader beware\"; or \"Beware of Hannibal Lector\" - not bad advice either way. This is my first Latin pun.)\n\nThe Later Trevis Tarrant tales\n\nAfter 1944, King began a second series of Tarrant tales, three of which eventually appeared in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.\n\nCrippen & Landru has republished the Tarrant stories, together with four additional tales not in the first collection, as The Complete Curious Mr. Tarrant (2003). Three of these later tales add considerably to the mystery value of the series as a whole.\n\nLittle Girl Who Wasn't There. \"The Episode of the Little Girl Who Wasn't There\" (1944) is a locked room story. It is full of ingenious ideas. It keeps proposing different solutions to its central riddle, in the tradition of E.C. Bentley's Trent's Last Case (1913), Anthony Berkeley's The Poisoned Chocolates Case (1929), and other Golden Age multi-solutioned tales. The story is hard to read, and lacks gracefulness. It is perhaps more intriguing than fun. But still, it shows lots of thinking.\n\nAspects hearken back to \"The Episode of the Nail and the Requiem\", and can be considered as a development of the ideas in that tale.\n\nSinister Invention. \"The Episode of the Sinister Invention\" (1946) is a minor pastiche of Sherlock Holmes. Aside from the zany inventions mentioned in the tale, the main interest here is some of Tarrant's use of deductive reasoning. Both this tale and the previous one show Tarrant functioning as an armchair detective.\n\nThe hall where the murder takes place is another of King's rooms. King deduces some architectural features of the hall from the story told him about the killing there by his policeman friend. Once again, King shows an interest in the engineering and construction of a room. And here, these features are made the center of logical deduction, an interesting extension of King's ideas.\n\nPerilous Talisman. \"The Episode of the Perilous Talisman\" (1951) is a combination fantasy and mystery story. Such hybrid works are fairly common in the sf world. This tale is nicely done, with some clever ideas, and King's patented ability to create suspense. This seems to be King's final work of fiction published during his lifetime.\n\nAlthough the plot deals with a small box, the ideas in the story seem oddly architectural. The box is of the oblong dimensions favored by King for his locked rooms, and is a similar complex engineering construction. The box also has features that recall \"The Episode of the Tangible Illusion\" (1935). King's interest in light and dark is also present. King's interest in optical devices recalls R. Austin Freeman. In general, King's concern with engineering and mechanical constructs is in the tradition of Scientific Detection.\n\nThe Egyptian box is \"a foot long by about eight inches wide\". This means the box is roughly in the Golden Ratio. There is much discussion today if ancient Egyptian architects consciously used the Golden Ratio in their work.\n\nAbsent Fish. \"The Episode of the Absent Fish\" was not published till long after King's death (EQMM April 1979). It is an imaginative story, in the tradition of \"The Nail and the Requiem\". Like that earlier story, it is a locked room problem, which takes place in an architecturally complex penthouse apartment. King's \"The Episode of the Tangible Illusion\" is also architectural in subject. King was fascinated with architecture, and many of his most creative works deal with it. Even when it plays little role in the mystery plot, such as the New Jersey highway landscapes in \"The Headless Horrors\" and Obelists Fly High, it is a fascinating part of the tale. King likes the engineering aspects of architecture, such as the infrastructure of the buildings, machinery in them, such as elevators or gas stations, and their industrial construction. King's creative use of architecture is part of Golden Age mystery tradition, while his interest in their engineering aspects is relatively personal and unique.\n\nObelists Fly High\n\nObelists Fly High (1935) is the most admired of King's six published mystery novels.\n\nStrengths and Weaknesses. It has a clever impossible crime plot, and surprises in its murder mystery that completely fooled me. And it has an enjoyable look at airplanes and airports of the era, in its early sections. So maybe I should be recommending it - or at least its plot.\n\nHowever, the book has some real problems. The storytelling drags interminably, especially in the second half where King explores an all too obvious alibi subplot. The characters are nasty. There is endless propagandizing for King's controversial views on psychology, religion and science. It continues King's vicious stereotyping of minority groups, this time of gays. It is not a pleasant reading experience at all. King has been overpraised by mystery critics. While his works have too much plot creativity to ignore, they have too many other problems to be actually good.\n\nOne might also point out that Obelists Fly High lacks the fabulous plot complexity of Ellery Queen or John Dickson Carr. Its story could be compressed to novella length without any harm.\n\nImagery and Settings. Obelists Fly High has some common imagery with other King works. Much of it takes place in an enclosed area, the airplane. This is similar to the penthouse of \"Nail\", the museum room of \"Harp\" and the basement room of \"Codex\". Common aspects:\n\nMost of these areas seem to be mechanical constructs. They are not the simple rooms of much Golden Age fiction. Instead the story emphasizes their constructed nature, the materials and the properties of the walls.\n\nThey sometimes have slightly irregular geometry.\n\nThese areas tend to be over twice as long as they are wide.\n\nThey tend to be associated with wealth and property: the 1935 airplane is the domain of the wealthy, as are the museums in the short stories.\n\nThe early sections (pp. 33 - 70) of Obelists Fly High depict Newark Airport. This is embedded in a New Jersey landscape similar to \"The Headless Horrors\". Both landscapes feature, not nature or traditional vistas, but modern highways centered around technological buildings: the gas station of \"Horrors\" and the hangars of Obelists.\n\nPlanes: Illustration. The vivid illustration that accompanies Philip Wylie's \"Death Flies East\", showing the interior of the plane's cabin, would make an excellent cover for King's book as well. It helped me visualize the setting of King's novel. Wylie's novella and its illustration are reprinted in the anthology American Murders (1986), edited by Jon L. Breen and Rita A. Breen.\n\nThe illustration emphasizes that pilots of the era were armed, a fact made much of by King. Ostensibly, this was because they carried mail, and hence were officials of the US Government. But in reality, it seems to be contrived to make them authority figures during flight, and for the sake of image, along with their uniforms.\n\nIdeologues. Obelists Fly High also has the fanatic ideologues of King's short stories. These extremely creepy characters generate horror from their participation in monstrous rituals and activities. But whereas the characters in Mr. Tarrant are members of fringe cults, those in Obelists Fly High are supporters of mainstream American belief systems: scientists. This gives the novel much more topicality and social punch, as well as controversy.\n\nThe Detective. Michael Lord, King's series sleuth in his novels, has some features in common with other Van Dine School detectives. Like them he is New York City based. In many ways, he is related to the \"genius amateur with personal connection to the police\" of Van Dine's Philo Vance and EQ's Ellery Queen. He is a young policeman, not an amateur, but he owes his association with the police to his friendship with the Police Commissioner, just as Vance has a friendship with the DA, and Ellery is the son of Inspector Richard Queen. He is a wealthy, sophisticated young man whose father was the Commissioner's best friend. The Commissioner made him a Lieutenant, but his genius detective skills made him rise rapidly to the rank of Captain. He is a Special Officer attached to the staff of the Police Commissioner.\n\nAs a social sophisticate attached to the police, he resembles Anthony Abbot's detective Thatcher Colt. Like Thatcher Colt, he is concerned with his leadership position. Lord's \"I am in charge here\" routine on the airplane in Obelists Fly High would make Al Haig blush. The Commissioner in King also resembles Colt in his insistence on saluting and other forms of discipline.\n\nHowever, like other authority figures in King, Lord manages to completely lose control of his turf. The novel opens with an Epilogue, showing how Lord has botched his case, and lost control of the airplane to an armed criminal. In fact his performance here is one of the least effective of all Golden Age detectives. King has presumably been reading E.C. Bentley's Trent's Last Case (1913). Shared features:\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the detective hero.\n\nLord falls in love with his chief suspect, just like Trent.\n\nObelists Fly High explores multiple solutions, in the tradition of Bentley's novel.\n\nLord's physical vulnerability is also related to the fact that he is a policeman: young men in uniform are always in the greatest danger in King's works. The young Army pilot in the novel also collapses.\n\nOne wonders if the name Michael Lord was inspired by young good-guy Christopher \"Kit\" Lord in Ellery Queen's The Tragedy of X (1932).\n\nMystery Traditions. Obelists Fly High occasionally echoes earlier mystery authors:\n\nThe novel proper (after the opening section) opens in the New York Police Commissioner's office. So do a number of Anthony Abbot tales.\n\nThe villain sends an anonymous warning to the police threatening that a victim will die at an announced time. This recalls a much-imitated gambit in The Four Just Men (1905) by Edgar Wallace. As usual in such tales, the police prove completely ineffectual at guarding the victim, despite elaborate precautions. Just once, I'd like to see a story in which the police prevent the killing and arrest the crook!\n\nThe tailing episode forms the conclusion of the opening meeting with the commissioner. The police employ quite a few officers in elaborate disguises, recalling Frederick Irving Anderson. This brief episode adds some welcome comedy to an otherwise grim book.\n\nMysteries on Planes\n\nThe vivid background description of airports and air travel Way Back When is one of the most appealing features of C. Daly King's Obelists Fly High. There was much interest in mysteries set on planes during this period:\n\nDarwin L. Teilhet's Murder in the Air (1931).\n\nStuart Palmer's The Puzzle of the Pepper Tree (1933).\n\nLebbeus Mitchell's The Parachute Murder (1933).\n\nPhilip Wylie's novella \"Death Flies East\" (1934).\n\nWilliam Sutherland's Death Rides the Air Line (1934).\n\nFreeman Wills Crofts' The 12.30 from Croydon (1934). Agatha Christie's Death in the Air (1935).\n\nC. Daly King's Obelists Fly High (1935).\n\nFranco Vailati's Il mistero dell'idrovolante (1935). Available in English translation as The Flying Boat Mystery (2019). Ellery Queen's The Four of Hearts (1938).\n\nIn addition, some tales have plane elements, but are not really a \"mystery on a plane\":\n\nChristopher St. John Sprigg's Death of an Airman (1934). Leslie Ford's novella \"The Clock Strikes\" (1935). Anthony Wynne's Murder in Thin Air (1936?).\n\nI learned about some authors on the above list from other scholars. Thanks!:\n\nFranco Vailati from Pietro De Palma's Death Can Read. Pietro De Palma is the author of an excellent impossible crime short story \"The Barese Mystery\", included in the anthology The Realm of the Impossible (2017) edited by John Pugmire and Brian Skupin.\n\nWilliam Sutherland from Curtis Evans' The Passing Tramp.\n\nRex Stout\n\nCommentary on Rex Stout:\n\nBob Schneider's analysis of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe Novellas.\n\nDavid Bordwell's long essay Rex Stout: Logomachizing. and its Preface.\n\nEssay by Ethan Iverson: Comfort Food (Rex Stout, Nero Wolfe, Archie Goodwin).\n\nRex Stout's novels have a common basic pattern. There is some fairly upper class business, such as cooking, cattle breeding, or radio, in which most of the characters are employed. The characters are involved in a complex dispute, which leads to much negotiation and deal making. The deals are often changed and renegotiated, often with the help of detective Nero Wolfe. Interspersed with all of this is a mystery. The mystery plot has some simple trick solution, hopefully fairly clever. Starting in 1940, Stout also became a prolific author of mystery novellas, most of which were published in the slick American Magazine, or, after 1956, in the Saturday Evening Post.\n\nStout's strongest feature as a writer is his superb dialogue. This dialogue shows the influence of that in the S.S. Van Dine books. Both authors indulged in complex, point-counter-point dialogues. Behind both authors is the stichomythia in Greek drama - the ingenious line by line counterpointing dialog that is so brilliant in Aeschylus and other writers. Stout's storytelling can also be superb. Like Van Dine, he knows how to make a really interesting tale unfold.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some more idiosyncratic factors at work. All the fierce, unfriendly deal making in Stout's books is a big turn-off to me. I dislike purchasing something in an antique shop, or being involved in any situation where I have to negotiate a price with an antagonist out to get me. I just don't like adversarial situations. I never play combat-based computer games either. Adversarial negotiations have little to do with today's business world. Corporations are looking for people who are good at working with and supporting others on their team. Business negotiations center on trying to move toward win-win situations, coming up with creative ideas that benefit all parties. Antagonism is out, problem solving is in.\n\nStout's Mystery Plotting\n\nStout's weakest feature in many of his novels is his puzzle plotting. His novellas are often well plotted, but his novels seem much weaker. The best Wolfe novel I have yet read with a good mystery plot is Some Buried Caesar. This book also has some of Stout's best humor and characterization, as well as some of Stout's most resonant symbolism, as discussed above. It is universally admired as one of its author's finest works. So we can all agree on something... Stout's fiction has been much praised by top critics of the 1940's (Ellery Queen, John Dickson Carr), and the 90's (Jon L. Breen, William L. DeAndrea). The 1990's paperback release of Stout contains glowing introductory tributes from dozens of mystery writers. So why can't I enjoy much of it? Stout's bad plotting drives me crazy. I work my way through many of his novels, and get nothing in return. The Tecumseh Fox novels, Double For Death (1939) and The Broken Vase (1941) are especially disappointing in this regard, as is And Be a Villain (1948).\n\nSo far, the Stout novels I have most actively enjoyed on all levels, puzzle plot and storytelling, are Too Many Cooks, Some Buried Caesar, The Silent Speaker, Might As Well Be Dead, Champagne for One, Plot It Yourself. Also, some novels have good opening sections: The Red Box, Murder by the Book, The Final Deduction, The Mother Hunt.\n\nAnthony Boucher thought Stout's novellas were better than his novels. I agree, with the exception of the novels listed above.\n\nHistorically, much of the best mystery fiction by all authors is in short forms: short stories, novellas, radio plays. Ignoring these leads to a woefully incomplete knowledge of the mystery genre.\n\nIf you have never read Stout, a good place to start is some of his novella collections, especially Three Men Out, Three Witnesses, Three For the Chair. If you prefer to begin with a novel, the novels just recommended are the best.\n\nHow-Done-It\n\nA \"how-done-it\" is a mystery, where the goal is for the detective and reader to figure out the actual physical method of a murder. How-done-its have been written by a broad variety of mystery writers, including S.S. Van Dine: see Van Dine's The Bishop Murder Case (1928), The Casino Murder Case (1934).\n\nHow-done-its by Rex Stout:\n\nFer-de-Lance. The Hand in the Glove. Some Buried Caesar.\n\n\"Black Orchids\".\n\n\"Cordially Invited to Meet Death\".\n\n\"Booby Trap\".\n\n\"Invitation to Murder\".\n\n\"A Window for Death\".\n\n\"Poison à la Carte\".\n\nHidden Object\n\nSome Stout mysteries involve the whereabouts of hidden objects:\n\n\"Secrets\".\n\nThe Hand in the Glove. The Mountain Cat Murders. Alphabet Hicks. The Silent Speaker.\n\n\"This Won't Kill You\" (Chapter 7).\n\n\"Blood Will Tell\" (Chapter 8).\n\nThe Silent Speaker is a Nero Wolfe tale. But many others on this list are not.\n\n\"Booby Trap\" has a \"vanishing object\" mystery, somewhat related to the above \"hidden object\" mysteries.\n\nArchitecture Mysteries\n\nGolden Age mystery writers often liked to base events in architecture. This is occasionally found in Stout:\n\nThe Rubber Band (Chapters 2, 3).\n\n\"Bitter End\".\n\n\"Booby Trap\".\n\n\"The Squirt and the Monkey\" (murder house)\n\n\"This Won't Kill You\" (Chapter 2).\n\n\"Christmas Party\".\n\n\"Method Three for Murder\".\n\n\"The Rodeo Murder\".\n\n\"Kill Now - Pay Later\" (Chapter 8).\n\nStout often stresses the layout of Wolfe's brownstone. This is always enjoyable to read about. But it only occasionally plays a role in the mystery plot, per se.\n\nSome Buried Caesar has aspects that deal with the practice of architecture:\n\nAn architect is a character: young Jimmy Pratt (Chapter 2).\n\nHis uncle Thomas Pratt talks briefly about how poor financial prospects are for architects. This is in the middle of the Depression (Chapter 2).\n\nA barbecue pit is being constructed (middle of Chapter 3).\n\nLandscape Mysteries\n\nGolden Age mystery writers also often liked to base events in landscapes. This is sometimes found in Stout:\n\nThe Hand in the Glove. Too Many Cooks. Some Buried Caesar (the fenced pasture with the bull). Alphabet Hicks.\n\n\"Bullet for One\".\n\n\"Immune to Murder\".\n\nPlot It Yourself (the Ogilvy yard, Chapters 5, 11)\n\n\"Method Three for Murder\".\n\nStout and the Van Dine School\n\nStout's basic paradigm is fairly similar to that of S. S. Van Dine's Philo Vance books. One difference is that Wolfe and Archie are private detectives, whereas most Van Dine school sleuths are either genius amateurs who work with the police as unofficial consultants, or genius amateurs who have gone to work for the police. Wolfe is certainly an eccentric genius, in the full Van Dine tradition, but he is not an amateur. And his relations with the police, while close and sometimes collaborative, are also much less friendly than most Van Dine school detectives.\n\nThe Intelligentsia. Van Dine often included collectors and enthusiasts in his tales. Examples are the ceramics collectors and dog lovers in The Kennel Murder Case (1932), the tropical fish lovers of The Dragon Murder Case (1933), the Egyptologists of The Scarab Murder Case (1929). Ellery Queen followed suit with the rare book lovers of many of his tales, and the stamp collectors of The Chinese Orange Mystery (1934). Stuart Palmer had the museum setting of \"The Riddle of the Dangling Pearl\" (1933), and the dog show setting of \"The Riddle of the Blueblood Murders\" (1934).\n\nRex Stout followed this Van Dine School tradition by using an orchid grower and/or flower show background for several of his works, including Some Buried Caesar (1938-1939), \"Black Orchids\" (1941), \"Door to Death\" (1948), and \"Easter Parade\" (1957). There are also the expert chefs and gourmets of Too Many Cooks (1938) and \"Poison à la Carte\" (1958), and the fishing expedition of \"Immune to Murder\" (1955). See the chess-players of Gambit (1962). The classical music composers in \"Invitation to Murder\" (1953) and \"Blood Will Tell\" (1963). The design world in The Red Box (1936 - 1937), Red Threads (1939), Alphabet Hicks (1941), \"Bullet for One\" (1948), Prisoner's Base (1952), \"Christmas Party\" (1957). The painter in \"Die Like a Dog\" (1954), the photographers in \"Easter Parade\" (1957), the artists in \"Method Three for Murder\" (1960). The radio workers in And Be a Villain (1948), magazine employee in Before Midnight (1955), theater people in \"Counterfeit for Murder\" (1961), television producers in The Father Hunt (1968).\n\nMurder Methods. Van Dine often included bizarre, ingenious murder methods in his work. These occur frequently in Stout as well. The opening sections of a Stout mystery often depict a mystery against a colorful background. How the crime was committed is completely unclear. Eventually, Nero and Archie figure out the details of the bizarre murder method used. The solution to this problem is revealed almost at once, often around half way through the story, or even earlier. Throughout the rest of the tale, the focus is figuring out whodunit, the actual killer. This is revealed at the end of the story. This two part construction, figuring out the method of the murder in the first half, the identity of the killer in the second, occurs in such works as Some Buried Caesar (1938-1939), \"Black Orchids\" (1941), \"Cordially Invited to Meet Death\" (1942) and \"Poison à la Carte\" (1958). Stout often put his greatest creativity into the first half of these tales. Both the colorful background, and the mystery puzzle surrounding the hidden method of murder, are often brilliantly done. By contrast, the actual whodunit section in the second half tends to be much less ingenious.\n\nCivil Rights. The Van Dine School often emphasized positive portraits of minority characters, and attacks on racism. This is true of Stout as well, especially in his looks at black characters and Civil Rights in Too Many Cooks and A Right to Die. Please see my list of Civil Rights in Mystery Fiction, which includes a section on Van Dine School Writers. One also suspects from his name that top operative & key series character Saul Panzer is Jewish, although this is not discussed explicitly.\n\nPsychology. Van Dine's work emphasized the individual psychology of the characters; their diverse psychological profiles served as identifications of the killer. Some of Stout's novels focus especially on individual attributes, especially tastes and preferences:\n\nIn the first half of The Red Box (1936 - 1937), the varying tastes of the individuals for different kinds of candy serves Wolfe as a window into the crime's mechanism.\n\nIn And Be a Villain (1948), Wolfe looks at approaches to soft drinks.\n\nThe main clue to the killer's identity, is linked to the victim's attitudes in \"Kill Now - Pay Later\".\n\nSeries Characters: Police. Van Dine included a sizable cast of police detectives, who appeared in book after book. The even bigger cast of series characters in the Nero Wolfe perhaps was inspired by this. Stout's series supporting characters are developed in greater depth than Van Dine's.\n\nVan Dine-inspired groups of series police characters also show up in Ellery Queen, Helen Reilly.\n\nStout: Not Hard-Boiled\n\nIt has become a truism of criticism that Stout's work is halfway between Golden Age writers like Van Dine, and hard-boiled writers like Hammett. According to this view, Wolfe is in the Van Dine tradition, whereas Archie is a hard-boiled detective like Hammett's Sam Spade. I cannot agree with this point of view at all, however, and find little to support it. Differences between Stout and hard-boiled fiction:\n\nThe social setting of Stout's fiction is consistently among the upper middle classes, as in the Van Dine school. We rarely if ever see the mobsters and toughs of the hard-boiled writers, nor are there underworld-run settings of nightclubs or casinos.\n\nThere are few scenes of violence or brutality in Stout's fiction. Exceptions: Archie on rare occasions indulges in fisticuffs (see \"Bitter End\", or \"Death of a Demon\"). \"This Won't Kill You\" (1952) and The Golden Spiders (1953) have some genuine rough stuff, unlike most of Stout's work.\n\nStout's prose also has little in common with the hard-boiled writers. It has few metaphors or wisecracks, although Archie lets off some startling similes in \"Black Orchids\" (1941). Nor does Stout indulge in the ornate descriptive passages of the hard-boileds.\n\nOne might also point out that Stout was not an alumnus of Black Mask magazine, unlike many hard-boiled authors. His Wolfe stories appeared in books and slick magazines right from the start.\n\nOne can also question whether Archie really relates to the hard-boiled dicks of his era. He talks in a direct way, and has few pretensions as an All-American kind of guy. But he also seems much fresher and less cynical and hard-bitten than Sam Spade, for instance.\n\nArchie has some of the characteristics of the \"sophisticated New Yorker\", a popular type in books, films and comics. He's well-dressed, eats three gourmet meals a day, knows about orchids, regularly attends the theater and goes dancing in night clubs. His work with Wolfe has also brought him into contact with a huge range of New York sophisticated humanity.\n\nStout and Scientific Detection\n\nStout might have been influenced by earlier writers of Scientific Detection:\n\nThe British writer R. Austin Freeman.\n\nThe American Scientific School, such as Arthur B. Reeve, Clinton H. Stagg, Jacques Futrelle.\n\nR. Austin Freeman. A possible precursor to Stout, is R. Austin Freeman's Dr. Thorndyke detective series. Similarities:\n\nThe quarters shared by Thorndyke, Jarvis and Polton. Thorndyke's establishment is one of the largest in detective fiction before Wolfe's brownstone.\n\nThorndyke and Wolfe are private detectives whose clients come to call. Both do a lot of realistic negotiation with their clients.\n\nPolton is almost as good at cooking as Wolfe's Fritz Brenner.\n\nAmerican Scientific School. Stout's work has similarities to the American Scientific School:\n\nHis detective Nero Wolfe is a genius, like Futrelle's detective the Thinking Machine and Arthur B. Reeve's scientist-sleuth Craig Kennedy.\n\nWolfe has some interest in science, as an orchid grower. Science sometimes plays a role in the Wolfe stories, especially animals (Some Buried Caesar, \"Die Like a Dog\", \"The Squirt and the Monkey\") and mathematics like probability (\"The Zero Clue\") and permutation theory (\"Poison à la Carte\", Too Many Cooks). See also the technical study of prose style in Plot It Yourself.\n\nSome Wolfe tales are full-fledged Scientific Detection stories, especially \"Cordially Invited to Meet Death\", \"Booby Trap\", \"The Zero Clue\", \"A Window for Death\".\n\nThe use of individual psychology in Stout's novels recalls the word association tests favored by the Scientific school.\n\nWolfe works as a private detective on a consulting basis, just like the Thinking Machine, Craig Kennedy, Thornley Colton, and other of the school's detectives.\n\nHe tends to deal with crimes that center around business, and less around the personal lives of his characters. The characters represent the upper levels of finance, industry, and public life, just as in Arthur B. Reeve and the others.\n\nAnd some Stout features specifically recall Arthur B. Reeve:\n\nStout's technique of having Archie gather all the suspects together for the big finale derives from Reeve, who is the earliest writer known to me systematically using this device. It is regularly used in Reeve's first collection of Craig Kennedy tales, The Silent Bullet (1911).\n\nThe way Wolfe listens in on conversations, reminding one of Reeve tales with listening devices.\n\nAn episode in Fer-de-Lance (1934), the first Nero Wolfe novel, recalls the plot of Reeve's \"The Black Diamond\".\n\nStout had an early writing career in the 1910's, long before Nero Wolfe debuted in 1934. The collection Target Practice (1998) reprinted his short fiction from All-Story, a pioneer pulp magazine. A few of these are crime stories. \"Secrets\" (1914), which the book's back cover describes as Stout's first crime short story, deals with a lawyer. The crime in the tale is embezzlement from a bank. Bank embezzlement is a favorite subject of the early American Scientific school. It occurs in:\n\nJacques Futrelle's \"The Man Who Was Lost\" (circa 1906). Mary Roberts Rinehart's The Circular Staircase (1907). Clinton H. Stagg's \"The Keyboard of Silence\" (collected in book form in 1915).\n\nThe use of a painter as a character in \"Secrets\", also recalls Futrelle.\n\nStout's Antecedents: More Possibilities\n\nVincent Starrett. In the 1920's Vincent Starrett wrote a series about bookstore owner and armchair detective George Washington Troxell, who solves problems brought to him by police reporter Frederick \"Fred\" Dellabough. The article on Starrett describes how these tales might have served as a prototype for Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin.\n\nElmer Rice. The article on Elmer Rice describes how his play Counsellor-at-Law (1931) might have influenced Nero Wolfe. The law office in Counsellor-at-Law anticipates business aspects of Nero Wolfe's private investigator establishment.\n\nAn Extra Woman\n\nA few Stout stories employ a plot construction:\n\nThe suspects are limited to a specific, closed group of men. This is clear immediately after the crime. For example in \"Die Like a Dog\" it is clear early on that the killer must be one of four men who are tenants in the apartment building where the crime occurred.\n\nBut a woman who is NOT part of this group of male suspects becomes prominent in the tale.\n\nAs the story goes on, the woman is involved in several interesting plot developments - even though she is not a suspect.\n\nThe woman can be mysterious in her behavior, in some of these stories.\n\nSPOILERS. Ultimately, the woman becomes a sympathetic character.\n\nThis woman is something \"extra\" in the plot. She extends the story beyond the men who are the actual suspects.\n\nExamples of these women include:\n\nSgt. Dorothy Bruce in \"Booby Trap\".\n\nJewel Jones in \"Die Like a Dog\".\n\nLawyer Ann Paige in \"Eeny Meeny Murder Mo\".\n\nSusan Maturo in \"The Zero Clue\" is a related character.\n\nThese women are all strikingly different from each other, and so are the overall plots of the tales. These tales have a common structural \"building block\" in the plot - but otherwise are quite varied.\n\nRitual Sacrifice\n\nA persistent theme in Rex Stout's stories is the ritualistic sacrifice. This ritual has associations with ancient fertility rites such as the Dionysius cult. For example:\n\nSome Buried Caesar (1938-1939) opens with the bull Caesar about to undergo the equivalent of being ritually sacrificed, and eaten.\n\nIn \"Help Wanted, Male\", Nero Wolfe himself is to be assassinated, and he hires a double, no less, to stand in for him, as the target of assassination attempts. The story makes a good deal of macabre comedy out of the situation. But it still involves someone who is deliberately chosen to be the target of a sacrificial death.\n\nIn \"Curtain Line\", an actor playing a famous detective is killed. He is in fact being murdered in an attempt to symbolically kill the fictional detective he portrays.\n\nPrisoner's Base (1952) also deals disturbingly in sending someone to be killed. The League of Frightened Men involves a student injured during a fraternity hazing ritual - another example of the invocation of ritual in these killings.\n\nIn \"Cordially Invited to Meet Death\" a party-giver wants Wolfe to be the detective in a \"murder game\". This is perhaps a comic version of such ritual killings.\n\nThere is another element in many of these stories of ritual sacrifice. It is an emphasis on the large number of people who will participate:\n\nIn Some Buried Caesar, the bull's flesh will be symbolically fed to the masses at a chain of cheap eateries, with the experience amplified by all that modern publicity can do.\n\n\"Curtain Line\" stresses that the fictional detective has 40 million fans.\n\nIn And Be A Villain (1948) the victim is killed in front of a nationwide radio audience.\n\nAs in the Dionysius story, and other ancient myths, the sacrifice is participated in, and benefits, the entire nation. The people as a whole take part in it.\n\n\"The Squirt and the Monkey\" does not have ritual killings. But it shares features with some of the above tales with ritual murders. SPOILERS:\n\nLike Some Buried Caesar it has an animal being killed: the monkey.\n\nLike \"Curtain Line\", it has a \"fictional character\" that is highly popular: the comic strip hero Dazzle Dan.\n\nPerformance\n\nOccasionally Stout stories have aspects of \"performance\": people playing roles. These are not on stage or for film. Instead they are at parties or gatherings or public events:\n\nThe young couple pretending to have a picnic, as part of a display at a Flower Show in \"Black Orchids\".\n\nThe professional party giver in \"Cordially Invited to Meet Death\" regularly hires people to appear at her parties in various roles.\n\nThe mysterious man playing Santa Claus at an office party in \"Christmas Party\".\n\nThe actress in \"Murder Is No Joke\".\n\nThe actresses hired to play \"Hebes\" (servers) at the dinner party in \"Poison à la Carte\". (Hebe was a cupbearer in Greek mythology.)\n\nThe actors in the scheme in The Doorbell Rang (Chapters 11, 12).\n\nArchie Godwin and the phony \"search\" he is supposed to execute in front of a group of suspects in \"The Squirt and the Monkey\" (last part of Chapter 1).\n\nThe rodeo stars put on a contest at a party in \"The Rodeo Murder\", but they are appearing as themselves, not acting roles.\n\nNonprofits\n\nStout often depicted businesses. But nonprofit organizations also appear:\n\nThe National Guernsey League, the North Atlantic Exposition in Some Buried Caesar.\n\nThe National Industrial Association in The Silent Speaker.\n\nThe Association for the Aid of Displaced Persons in The Golden Spiders.\n\nThe Women's Nature League of America in Before Midnight (Chapter 4).\n\nThe Bynoe Rehabilitation Fund in \"Easter Parade\".\n\nThe home for unwed mothers in Champagne for One.\n\nThe National Association of Authors and Dramatists, the Book Publishers of America in Plot It Yourself.\n\nThe Civil Rights organization The Rights of Citizens Committee in A Right to Die.\n\nWoman Workplaces\n\nThe \"typing services\" in Murder by the Book are all businesses run by women, as the book points out (Chapter 4). This anticipates the answering phone business in \"The Next Witness\". Both works show women as the backbone of communication industries. Both show women working in cramped office spaces. And presumably none of these women workers are well paid.\n\nSee:\n\nThe design business in Red Threads.\n\nThe women-run food factory in \"Bitter End\".\n\nThe home for unwed mothers in Champagne for One.\n\nFar more glamorous are the women models in The Red Box.\n\nThe party-arranging firm in \"Cordially Invited to Meet Death\".\n\nThe typing services in Murder by the Book.\n\nThe textile manufacturing firm is run for a period by a woman in Prisoner's Base.\n\nWomen's Nature League of America in Before Midnight.\n\nThe answering phone business in \"The Next Witness\".\n\nWealthy Mrs. Bynoe is especially interested in the Bynoe Rehabilitation Fund, a charity group in \"Easter Parade\". The Fund does have a male top employee.\n\nThe couture business in \"Murder Is No Joke\" is male-owned, but we mainly see female employees.\n\nCollander House is a rooming house for women, run by Mrs. Ruth Garvin in Plot It Yourself.\n\nBruner Corporation in The Doorbell Rang probably has employees of both genders, but we see owner Rachel Bruner and her assistant, both women.\n\nDorothy Sebor runs the Sebor Shopping Service in The Father Hunt (last part of Chapter 12). We don't see its employees, though.\n\nThe mansion in \"Invitation to Murder\" is not a business, strictly speaking - but all five people we see working there are women.\n\nThe lower middle class sisters in The Mountain Cat Murders have jobs that play roles in the story: schoolteacher, secretary-bookkeeper.\n\nFemale-run places regularly appear in films directed by Robert Siodmak and Lamont Johnson.\n\nThe large engineering firm in Too Many Women has 500 woman employees. But it is not woman-run.\n\nCaroline Pratt is a businesswoman turned full-time champion golfer in Some Buried Caesar. However, the business she worked for was male-run; we learn little about the business side of golf.\n\nToo Many Cooks takes place at a spa where the cooks and waiters are all black: something that plays a major role in this pro Civil Rights novel. Like the Wolfe looks at all-female places of employment, this examines a business that depends on the work of The Other.\n\nWomen's Issues\n\nWomen's issues are central to:\n\n\"Die Like a Dog\".\n\n\"A Window for Death\".\n\n\"Too Many Detectives\".\n\n\"Death of a Demon\".\n\n\"Kill Now - Pay Later\".\n\nWomen Accused of Theft at Work\n\nStout sometimes showed women accused of theft at work. It is usually unclear at the outset of these plots, who actually committed the theft:\n\nThe Rubber Band.\n\n\"Bullet for One\".\n\n\"Santa Claus Beat\".\n\nInformation: Newspaper Morgues\n\nA newspaper \"morgue\" is a huge collection of old newspapers and/or clippings. People would use them to research nearly any topic.\n\nToday, morgues seem like a predecessor to today's Internet websites and their mountain of information. Americans valued information tools in older eras, even if they unfortunately didn't have modern technology.\n\nExamples in Rex Stout:\n\nA "
