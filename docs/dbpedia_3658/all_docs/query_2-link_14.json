        "text": "It is. It’s a lot of competition. A lot of people want to be Directors. In fact, a lot of people go to film school, and they say they’re going because they want to be a Director, and then, ultimately, in film school, they practice another position, and they realize, “Wow! What I really like is editing,” or “I really like cinematography,” or “I really like costumes,” you know? They end up branching out.\n\nBut it is tough to be a Director, not only because of the competition and so many people want to do it, but it’s how do we get to that professional grade? You can be a Director and make little movies, and little YouTube things, and stuff—and you’re a Director. You’re telling stories.\n\nBut in terms of making a living as a Director, that’s where it becomes tough because there’s a lot of competition, and also you’re only as good as your last film. So if your last film or TV episode wasn’t good, it’s harder to get that next chance.\n\nSo a Director’s constantly proving himself because you could have directed 110 episodes and if your 111th is not good, they’ll remember you for that 111th. They won’t remember you for the 110 that you did that were great. I had a famous Producer once tell me, “When you make it, know that staying up there is tougher than making it.” I tend to think both are tough: getting that first opportunity, and then branching out and continuing.\n\nThere are so many different paths to becoming a Director. You may have started in another position. For example, I know Script Supervisors who have become Directors, I know Cinematographers who’ve become Directors, I know Assistant Directors who have become Directors, I know Actors who have become Directors.\n\nMy journey [is that] I always wanted to be a Director, I started by writing a short film and I directed the short film. I screened that film, I put it in film festivals and that allowed me to get my first feature film. That got me my second film, and then on and on. That doesn’t happen often. I lucked out in many ways.\n\nAnother way is you write your own script. You write a script—feature or short film—and you go ahead and do it. Now, everyone’s able to do it; even with this little thing [referring to iPhone] you can make your own film. There’s no excuse for not telling a story if you want to tell a story. When I was coming up, we didn’t have these things.\n\nOne of the reasons I went to film school was because it afforded me the opportunity to have access to film cameras and film…and that allowed me to make film. But nowadays, anyone can grab a phone and make a film. Whole features have been made on an iPhone.\n\nTo be a Director, you have to be an observer of the world, of people, of the life around you. When you work on a story, you’re gonna tap into your sensibilities, into who you are to tell that story. That’s why if you see a movie, you’re seeing something that was created by somebody who has tapped into his or her life experience to tell that story.\n\nSo it’s important to be honest with oneself and to observe the world. When I was in film school and I needed to work, I was a Taxi Driver in New York City. I would carry a journal with me and any interesting person that I would meet, I would write it down. I kind of created a catalog of characters and people and I observed people because we ultimately, as storytellers, are telling human stories.\n\nWe need to tap into humanity. We need to have a connection with people, characters, locations, settings, history, and art. I think that’s an exciting thing if you approach it from that way.\n\nNobody knows. On the real though, I would say that how you become a Director is by doing it. That’s really the most annoying but accurate way to do it. It also makes it easier when you’re already doing it, which sounds strange because shouldn’t you already be doing it in order to get the job?\n\nBut it’s not necessarily that easy. When I say, “Just do it,” people think, “Oh, I don’t have money for a big camera and crew,” but that’s not what I’m talking about. We live in the age of technology; you can shoot anything on your phone, and you can cut it together and see what story it makes.\n\nPeople are doing that every day on TikTok and Instagram. They’re Directors in their own right. They may be considered “content creators” nowadays, but they’re telling a story and making people feel something, and that’s what we do. If you’re finding opportunities to tell a quick story: beginning, middle, and end, in any way possible without getting paid, you’re directing.\n\nThat’s the other thing that people don’t understand. When you want to do something like this, a high-profile job, you’re gonna start with internships. You might not be getting paid to direct. If there’s a friend who’s got a script that you like, ask that friend if you can direct it. They’ll probably say, “Cool! Someone wants to shoot my thing? Yes, let’s do it!”\n\nJust go ahead and do it that way. Keep making stuff, because people are gonna have a hard time hiring you if they don’t know what your eye looks like. When you shoot something, you’re telling us how your eyes see the world. If people are interested and gravitate and connect to what you’re saying, those are your people. “That’s your circus,” is what I say. Everybody’s crazy. The more we can be okay with that and embrace that, the more we understand. It’s just about finding your crazy.\n\nThat’s how you become a Director. I did this Rebel Without a Crew series. I hate plugging, but it’s really helpful. Robert [Rodriguez] has a book and a YouTube series. It’s like his own film school with all these behind-the-scenes tips on how to shoot stuff for cheap.\n\nYouTube is a really great tool. I watch so many film critique channels like The Closer Look, Lessons from the Screenplay, Wisecrack, and StudioBinder. It’s basically free film school. Go do it. You don’t have to pay tuition. You don’t even need to pay the Masterclass fee. It’s all online now, so there’s no excuse. Take the desire of what you want to do and put it into action.\n\nI sometimes spend hours watching [YouTube], and then I rewatch things later because something else clicks. When I’m in a different place in my life, when I’ve been thinking about different things, I’m gonna see something different.\n\nI started The Water Phoenix in 2015, and it took a long time to finish. But when I was making it, nobody gave a shit about mermaids. (I’m sorry I cussed.) I thought, “Everybody’s obsessed with vampires and werewolves, and they just keep recycling that stuff.” So I said, “What if we did mermaids in that way instead? What if they were in our real world? What would that look like? How would we treat them?” So I was doing it for that reason.\n\nSiren came two years later. At first, I was like, “Oh man, I have a mermaid short, guys!” It wasn’t finished at that time, but I said, “I have a mermaid short! Clearly I can do this. Hire me! Hire me!” but nobody cared. I did get to meet some of the execs at Freeform, but I was just too new for them to hire me at that moment, or even think of me and pass me on to the creators. But me having that short and me growing as a Director made it easier for them to hire me when they did, because they already knew me. They’d already met me, and then they’d seen me grow.\n\nSo then they thought, this is a no-brainer because she’s already done it. What’s funny is while I was on set, the lead (Eline, who plays the mermaid) was like, “You’re the first mermaid Director. You’re the first Director who’s actually done this, and I’m really excited about that.”\n\nSee? She was excited because I knew what it’s like to be underwater and to try to hold your breath, and try to look beautiful, and move well. That’s a very specific skill. Now I have that skillset, and it makes me valuable to shows that do underwater work.\n\nThat is a really, really, really, really difficult question. There are so many different paths you can take. I took the writing path. I joined the BBC and the BBC trained me. I started radio, then from radio, I graduated to TV, and I did documentaries, and then from documentaries I wanted to do more long form [projects], and I started to write scripts. I knew that the one thing I could do that no one else could give me permission for was to write.\n\nThat’s the first thing I would say to kids. If you can write–even if you can’t write–start doing it because it’s the one thing that you can do yourself. When I shoot something, I need 350 people to help me realize what I’m gonna shoot, right? It’s very hard to get that break.\n\nBut writing, you can just do. If you’re disciplined and you can kick out two pages a day — or five pages a day — and you can write a good script, you can get attention. And if you get attention, you’re in. So that’s one way to go in.\n\nThe other way to go in is to get a job in the crew and get a craftsman job–a Grip, a Gaffer, Electrician, Camera. If you get in any of those departments, you’re learning a real craft.\n\nSay you manage to get a job as a Camera Trainee. It’s an incredibly brilliant job to get because it’s really hard work but you’ll learn a craft. Soon enough, you’re pulling focus, after three or four years. You get to work, and you get to work in the field. A lot of Directors have gone through that route. Barry Sonnenfeld started off in camera. He was a DP and then became a Director, so that’s another route.\n\nThe problem is a lot of kids when they get into that route, they’re making so much money — because you’re making $2,000 or $3,000 a week, even if you’re quite low down the ladder — and they’re so tired from the hours that we work that they forget that they need to film on weekends, or get together with some of the crew and film this short film.\n\nThat’s what tends to happen; a lot of people forget about their dream because they’re suddenly making money and they’re so tired. That’s why I talk about being tenacious and knowing exactly what you want. Continue to go for it.\n\nThe third route is through programs. Warner Bros. do an amazing scheme that I was on about ten years ago where they take young filmmakers and you do a twelve-week program with a woman called Bethany Rooney, who’s a wonderful Director. And after that, they guarantee you a TV job.\n\nIt’s very hard to get a TV job, but Warner Bros. do something, NBC do something. They’re very, very, very competitive, and they’re very, very, very difficult to get on. I know people that have tried for seven, eight years, and they haven’t got on. But, like I said, I got on and it changed my whole career because it made me accessible to TV. Now I do TV and film and I’m pretty fortunate to be able to do that.\n\nI had what I have found to be kind of a non-traditional start in the film industry. I was lucky to get an academic scholarship to USC, and I came to study entrepreneurship. USC Film School is the institution that introduced me to filmmaking.\n\nThe biggest thing that I got from USC was an exposure to the idea that being a filmmaker was both being an artist and being an entrepreneur. That was so compelling to me because I had always felt like those were two aspects of my character. My dream was to find a career that allowed me to exercise both. I just didn’t really know before going to USC what that was because I was starting businesses, and that was cool, but it wasn’t really creatively satisfying.\n\nI graduated from USC in 2014. I got there in 2011. (I ended up graduating in three years.) And I started working in the film industry, doing script coverage. I worked for a Lit Agent at ICF, who represented these amazing Directors like Antoine Fuqua, the Director of Training Day. I was like the first line of defense for all these screenplays that came in that were seeking directorial attachments. It gave me an appreciation for how difficult screenwriting was as a craft because if most of the screenplays I’m reading from established Screenwriters are bad, then it’s definitely not an easy thing to do well, you know?\n\nI was continuing to work in making my first short films and developing my skillset as a filmmaker, making all the amateurish mistakes that a lot of my classmates at USC made when they were ten years old on their parents’ VHS camera. But as I was working in the industry, specifically in production, I was gaining really good experience as a Line Producer and as an AD. I was learning how to budget and schedule commercials, music videos, and short films, and at the same time, I was also editing everything that I was writing and directing.\n\nOne of the really big takeaways for me in the early part of my film journey was the importance of throwing myself into every aspect of filmmaking because at the outset, who else is going to do that stuff for you? You can’t use the excuse of “Oh, I never produce anything,” or “I’m not an Editor,” or whatever.\n\nYou can’t use that excuse to not continue creating and growing as a filmmaker. Especially at the beginning of your career, there’s so many sort of mistakes and trial lessons. You just have to make those mistakes and get through those early projects to get to a point where you have a fluency in the film language so that you can actually start communicating what you want to communicate through your short films.\n\nWith gaining experience budgeting and scheduling, that gave me the ability where I felt, “Okay, I’m definitely ready to make my first feature film.” It gave me the ability and the insight to understand how to design my first feature film in such a way that I could actually make it and design it in such a way that no one could prevent me from making it.\n\nI had already written several other features, several television pilots. I had spent all this time going through the process of meeting with production companies who liked my screenplay. I had been a finalist for the Sundance Screenwriters Lab with that script. I made a proof of concept out of that script. It got me a lot of meetings, and there was interest, but there was always something that held it back. This was like a $1M to $1.5M movie, and what I realized was I’m just asking for too much for my first feature film.\n\nAs a Writer/Director, one of the biggest hurdles you’re gonna face is making your first feature. Until you’ve done it, you’re not really considered a real Director. But to do it, people need to believe that you can do it. But if you haven’t done it, why would they believe it?\n\nSo, there’s like this crazy catch-22, and what I realized was I just need to make my first movie…and if I have to do it with no budget, I’m gonna have to do it with no budget. If I have to wear a bunch of hats, even if I just wanna focus on the directing — which for me is the thing that I enjoy the most about filmmaking — then I’m gonna have to wear other hats, like I have throughout all these early years of just starting as a filmmaker.\n\nThe really critical thing for me was making the decision that no matter what the outcome was gonna be for this movie, I was ready to make my first feature film, and if it resulted in an embarrassing failure — which was such a possibility at all points throughout the process, and only increased exponentially when I decided, as we were casting that I had to play the lead role in the movie without any real acting experience before.\n\nIt was coming to terms with that risk and saying, “I am willing to risk that failure and that embarrassment because I know no matter what happens from a results standpoint with the movie, I will have directed my first feature film, and I will have learned everything that went into that, and I will be better positioned to make my next movie.” That was definitely the turning point for me as a filmmaker."
