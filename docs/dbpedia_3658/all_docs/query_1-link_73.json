        "text": "Vacancies\n\nAre you curious about life and its surprises, trained in the hospitality/ tourism industry and are from the tough side of life? You are interested in friendships and acquaintances (in the team and with guests), you prefer flowing and flexibility to norms and customs? Yet, you are professional and quick-witted? If all this applies to you, Superbude probably is a perfect match for your career!\n\nBENEFITS\n\nThe greatest gift we get in the hotel industry is the free time of those who check in as guests. No matter from which position you work, it must be your highest priority to make this free time of the guests to an unforgettable one and to contribute with your tasks to the fact that only good memories of Superbude are taken home.\n\nWe make sure that you always have everything you need to make this Spirit your own.\n\nHere you can get an overview of the benefits you will receive as a crew member.\n\nJörn - General Manager\n\nSuperbude - this is where I meet friends and colleagues with whom I like to work. I can laugh with my colleagues but also be sad sometimes. Create ideas and make plans, work on our shared visions and think about how we can put them into practice. We can live, lead and shape our Superbude as if we were our own guests. I am firmly convinced that this feeling is also transferred to the guests. This philosophy and the smile of the employees and guests drive me.\n\nDanilo - Property Manager\n\nAt Superbude we don’t roll out the red carpet when our guests arrive, but we welcome them with a warm and honest “Moin” – because that is what you say in Hamburg. Both, with our guests and with our colleagues we are honest, straightforward, human and respectful. Nobody needs to put on a mask here. Everyone should stay golden and true to themselves. The many characters in the house make Superbude a colourful and lovely place. Both for our neighbours, and for our guests.\n\nMichael - Managing Director Superbude Vienna Prater\n\nFinally, arrived at Superbude! In my career, I’ve seen and worked for quite some hotels and nothing compares to what I found here with Superbude. Simply being yourself in front of the team and even with guests, this is exactly what makes me so enthusiastic about this type of concept. Hope you guys enjoy our hotels as much as I do – see you soon during your next stay in Vienna!\n\nFenja - Events & Marketing\n\nFor a long time, I have been looking for an employer with whom I can identify 100%. I have definitely found one with Superbude. Unbelievably great people, a concept that works based on trust and then even more spectacular areas and rooms where I can create and make really cool events happen. I have to say, I am absolutely happy here and can be myself. This is the feeling we want to convey to all our guests, except stupid Nazis, they get no room here. That is how I like it!\n\nDiana - E-Commerce\n\nRight from the start, Superbude allows you to participate in many exciting projects and contribute your ideas. Every day is different and there is definitely no boredom here. Appreciation is the be-all and end-all for us. No matter what area you work in, all Superbude employees are a team and pull together. It's a lot of fun to work here because every day is like meeting friends.\n\nKimi - Operations (Elternzeit)\n\nSuperbude means professionalism and coolness at once.\n\nIn addition, the trust base is still really cool here. Both, from boss to co-worker and from co-workers to guest. Could perhaps change as we grow, but so far it is definitely working and good to have. Sometimes it is the little things in life that make life so great especially when working at the reception. When guests realize little DIY things and are happy about it or when they read about the tips we give for hot days in summer. Or they would like to thank you for making a telephone booking so uncomplicated & fast.\n\nKlaas - Sales, Marketing & Events\n\nI was always curious to work in the tourism industry because the people we work for (our guests) trust us with their precious free time. To “sell” a product that is not only authentic and emotional but also worthy lets me work with a clear conscience. We know that our guests leave this place happy and satisfied. Working on this nice product together with a cool crew at Superbude makes me happy!\n\nXenia - Reservierung\n\nWorking at Superbude is never boring because there is no day like another. Surely, some oft he tasks are regular but still, there are different people and different sitiations every day. It is so colourful with all the different guests and the place itself leaves room for creativity. When you arrive you might be a stranger but when you leave you will be a friend. I like that!\n\nChristian\n\nFinally… Superbude! After many years of working abroad, I finally returned to Vienna to create Superbude Prater together with my partners and friends. This time, we wanted to create the hotel of our dreams in one of the most vibrant places in Vienna. In case you always felt the need to sleep next to your four friends in one big bed, or spend the night in a birdhouse – stay with us. If you see me in the hotel, let’s have a chat about life and your stay. I’m curious, always!\n\nLooking forward to seeing you soon at Superbude,\n\nChristian\n\nFlo - Front Office Manager\n\nI started in the high-end sector of the industry and am more than happy, that I am finally at a company like Superbude.\n\nTo work with and for people who are like-minded and embrace personality and the idea of modern hotels is great.\n\nSometimes we have way too much to do but when you can work with friends it's fun to perform together.\n\nOh Superbude, you are wonderful!\n\nPatrick - Sales & Events\n\nHotel, Hostel, Home! Even though I have seen a lot as a travel-crazy exile \"Schwabe\", I found this combination rarely so strongly implemented as by the Superbude! The Superbude represent their values and each location has a unique character, far from the mainstream. Our superguests that we welcome to this great city bring a breath of fresh air every day, which is why no two days are the same. This variety is fun, and it also transfers to our insanely cool team. The concept of our rooms corresponds exactly to my way of traveling and welcoming guests. Long story short - the Superbude is like a second home!\n\nDanilo - Property Manager\n\nNow I'm back for the second time and have returned to the Superbude St. Pauli. For me, working as the manager of the place means keeping the house and yard and the whole team together. As an old hand, I've known the place for a few days, and it's exciting to see how everything keeps changing and yet the spirit remains the same. Of course, I'm thrilled about that, especially when you always have such a motivated team around the hotel(s). Sometimes it happens that a beer after work turns into a fun evening... And yet we can work professionally and well as colleagues again the next morning. Just the right mix of colleague and concentration, hotel & hostel, SUPER & BUDE!\n\nAdéla - Sales Vienna\n\nAfter my excursion into the tour operator industry, I was drawn back to the hotel industry...back to the roots. But not in the boring, stiff Viennese star hotel business, wit had to be something very special. It had to be a product that I was completely standing behind. Otherwise, sales is no fun, and fun is a must. And then it came - the SUPERBUDE. A house that Vienna has never seen before. I feel very comfortable here, really like at home with friends, and that's how it should be here.\n\nCome by and say hi - you have to see this place with your own eyes. See you soon, bussi, baba"
