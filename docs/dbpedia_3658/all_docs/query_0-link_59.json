        "text": "Ok, I admit it. One of my guilty pleasures is getting lost on YouTube. While I hear most of America zeros in on cats doing funny things or the latest teenager doing something stupid, I find myself drawn to old TV shows. How could you not watch Salvador Dali on What's My Line? These clips give us a window into a different time and culture and there’s plenty about classical music to watch.\n\nI was spellbound in discovering John Cage on I've Got a Secret. They don’t even play the game or try to guess his \"secret\"; they just let him play his music in a studio full of props. It is very early performance art. I loved seeing a very young Seiji Ozawa on What's My Line with Woody Allen on the panel and an extremely funny Van Cliburn on the same show. We hardly see classical music on prime-time TV anymore.\n\nRecently some of the many talent shows have included pianists and singers, which is great. But there was a time when classical musicians were on all the time, particularly The Ed Sullivan Show. Click below to see Itzhak Perlman at 19, or Anne Akiko Meyers at 11with Johnny Carson. I had a TV show on A&E for more than 12 years featuring some of the best in classical music. One viewer posted an episode featuring Lang Lang’s first time on American television. Let’s just say we were both younger then.\n\nI knew the music from Lieutenant Kije, but have you seen the Russian movie from 1934? Well truth be told, I have not sat through the whole thing either, but you could, because it is online.\n\nBelow are some of my favorite online video links. What are yours? Please share your favorites, guilty pleasures, rarities and surprises.\n\nJohn Cage on I’ve Got a Secret:\n\nMarilyn Horne on the TV Show The Odd Couple:\n\nVan Cliburn playing at the Tchaikovsky Competition:\n\nVan Cliburn on What's My Line:\n\nItzhak Perlman at 19 on The Ed Sullivan Show:\n\nLang Lang on Breakfast with the Arts:\n\nSalvador Dali on What's My Line:\n\nWhen the Barclay’s Center opened last fall, we theorized about the kind of classical music that would be best suited for 18,000-seat Brooklyn arena: Some Mahler, perhaps, or a night of Wagner. To date, only Andrea Bocelli has materialized – he of the crossover singing fame.\n\nBut on Feb. 28, the classical void will be filled – partly, anyhow – with a visit from the violinist Itzhak Perlman.\n\nPerlman will give a concert with Yitzchak Meir Helfgot, the cantor from the Park East Synagogue in Manhattan, who has been a leader in the revival of Jewish liturgical music. The two will be joined by several Klezmer musicians and an 18-piece chamber orchestra that includes members of the Perlman Music Program, a music camp on Shelter Island, NY.\n\nThe concert, which was first reported Tuesday by the New York Times, is the result of an unlikely friendship between Perlman and Bruce Ratner, the majority owner of the Barclay’s Center.\n\nRatner, who is also a minority owner of the Brooklyn Nets and a controversial real estate developer, is a longtime friend of Perlman’s. Their daughters attended the Brearley School in Manhattan together and the two men were spotted together in court-side seats at a Nets-Knicks game last month. Ratner sang cantorial music in a synagogue while growing up in Cleveland.\n\nPerlman approached Ratner with the idea for the concert, which grew out of a recording he made with Helfgot last year called “Eternal Echoes: Songs and Dances for the Soul.” It features an assortment of Yiddish folk songs, Hassidic prayers and klezmer music. The show will repeat at the Tilles Center in Greenvale, NY on March 10.\n\nThe Times reports that there will be a section of the Barclay’s Center with separate seating for men and women, in accordance with the customs of ultra-Orthodox Jews. Also planned is extra catering from Avenue K, a kosher restaurant in Manhattan.\n\nThursday night at the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn, a couple dozen men in dark suits were seen praying in a corridor near the food court. These weren’t Brooklyn Nets fans desperately searching for some divine intervention for their team. They were patrons at a sold-out concert of Jewish liturgical music featuring the violinist Itzhak Perlman and the star Hasidic singer Yitzchak Meir Helfgot.\n\nThe concert was a showcase for what Perlman calls “Jewish comfort music” – Yiddish folk tunes, Hasidic prayers and rousing klezmer standards. A Klezmer band and an 18-piece chamber orchestra supplied the accompaniment.\n\nThe Barclays performance followed an album of Jewish music that Perlman and Helfgot released last August called “Eternal Echoes.” Seeking to take the show on the road, Perlman approached his daughter’s childhood friend for a favor from her dad – Barclays owner Bruce Ratner. The two men shared court-side seats at a Nets-Knicks game in December.\n\n\"Then afterwards they invited me to do the National Anthem for one of the Nets games,\" said Perlman. \"You could call it my first sound check. I knew how the hall sounded. Now I know what kind of feedback to expect from the miking and so on.”\n\nOnly about a third of Barclays’ 18,000 seats were made available for the Perlman-Helfgot show, with prices ranging from $80 to $250. That included certain sections for gender-segregated seating, in accordance with the customs of ultra-Orthodox Jews, though the vast majority seemed to opt for mixed seating last night. A kosher restaurant supplied extra pastrami and corned beef sandwiches.\n\nWhile the concert was aimed primarily at Jewish New York, the age range was striking. Among the younger patrons was Laibel Gerson, who was there with a group of his friends in their 20s.\n\n\"I’ve actually seen him in Israel once, Cantor Helfgott, along with several other cantors,\" said Gerson. \"Then, Itzhak Perlman is a big plus. So it’s my first time with Itzhak Perlman and the Klezmer band as well. It’s kind of nice… My father’s actually a big classical buff I would say. He’s very big into the Bach and the Mozart kind of stuff.”\n\nTo reach the Jewish community, the Barclays officials made a big marketing push. There were ads in Jewish media outlets, signs in communities like Borough Park, and group sales outreach. A number of audience members said they were drawn by the chance to hear Helfgott, a cantor at the Park East Synagogue in Manhattan with a piercing operatic tenor.\n\n\"I’ve seen him perform live and I’ve heard his recordings,\" said patron Robert Lichtenstein. He said he admired \"the strength, the depth, the emotions, the feelings, the vibrancy” in the music.\n\nPerlman and Cantor Helfgot will repeat their show at the Tilles Center in Greenvale, New York on March 10.\n\nAudio: Perlman on playing with \"schmaltz\"\n\nThe springtime Jewish holiday of Passover is about liberation from slavery in ancient Egypt. In this one-hour special, violinist Itzhak Perlman shares Passover music from many traditions, plus songs and memories from his childhood in Israel. The program draws its shape from the Passover seder and, like that ancient family ritual, the music gets progressively giddier as the show moves along.\n\nSelections include music from familiar classical works (Handel’s Israel in Egypt), and from lesser-known classical pieces such as Halévy’s opera La Juive, with Jan Peerce; Dessau’s 1934 German setting of the Haggadah; Korngold’s glorious Passover Psalm.\n\nPerlman’s playing is represented by a duet with Cantor Yitzchak Meir Helfgot, as well as the beloved theme from \"Schindler’s List.\" Other recordings include unusual takes on traditional tunes, like a swing “Dayenu,” “Who Knows One?” in Ladino, the zany Moishe Oysher treatment of “Chad Gadya,” and “Go Down, Moses” sung by Paul Robeson.\n\nPlaylist:\n\nDayenu Variations\n\nArr.

According to the violinist, he was traveling with an Air Canada employee between his arrival gate and passport control when the staff member became argumentative and refused to assist in carrying his carry-on luggage. He then left Perlman in a corridor by a bank of elevators.\n\nWith three bags to carry, as well as his multi-million-dollar violin, the 68-year-old Perlman loaded up his mobility scooter and wheeled his way to customs authorities. Perlman suffered polio as a child and uses crutches and a scooter to get around. The incident drew dozens of messages of sympathy on Perlman's Facebook page.\n\nAir Canada said in a statement that it has donated 500,000 Aeroplan miles to Chai Lifeline Canada, the charity Perlman was in Toronto to support. Company spokesman Marc-Andre Hotte also wrote to Perlman's assistant to say, \"I would like to extend my personal apologies for the inconvenience we caused Mr. Perlman in Toronto but especially for the unacceptable service we extend him with.\"\n\nChai Lifeline, which offers support services to families of children stricken with serious illness, said in a statement, “the miles donated to the organization will no doubt do a great deal of good for ill children and their families in Toronto and the GTA.\"\n\nThe violinist returned to New York early Tuesday morning, with no reported travel difficulties.\n\nJoin violinist Itzhak Perlman at 8 pm on Dec. 16, and 9 pm on Dec. 22, as he tells the story of the Jewish festival of lights and shares his favorite recordings for the holiday — some serious, some silly. This special features music from Perlman’s radio-addicted childhood in Israel, including evocative songs in Yiddish and Ladino, classical music that revolves around the Maccabee heroes of the Chanukah story and gems by American folk singers.\n\nPerlman also shares jokes and memories, plus tales of three classic Chanukah symbols: the menorah, the latke and, of course, the dreidel.\n\nProgram playlist:\n\nMaoz Tsur (Rock of Ages)\n\nTraditional\n\nKristen Gygi, flute\n\nHava Narimah (Let’s Raise the Banner and Torch)\n\nMusic by George Frideric Handel, words by Levin Kipnis\n\nCindy Paley, singer\n\nChanukah: A Singing Celebration\n\nSee the Conquering Hero Comes\n\nfrom “Judas Maccabaeus” by George Frideric Handel\n\nThe King’s Consort, Choir of New College, Oxford\n\nRobert King, conductor\n\nHandel: Judas Maccabaeus\n\nHyperion\n\nSound an Alarm\n\nfrom “Judas Maccabaeus” by George Frideric Handel\n\nRichard Tucker, tenor\n\nChanukiah Li-Yesh (I Have a Chanukiah)\n\nHannah Aharoni, singer\n\nHed Arzi\n\nChanukah Blessings\n\nIlene Safyan, singer\n\nJust in Time for Chanukah\n\nAvi Hidlik (My Father Lit the Candles)\n\nGeula Gill with Dov Seltzer and Group\n\nHoliday Songs of Israel\n\nRounder\n\nThe Latke Song\n\nWritten and performed by Debbie Friedman\n\nDebbie Friedman: Live At The Del\n\nSounds Write Productions\n\nLevivot (Pancakes)\n\nGeula Gill with Dov Seltzer and Group\n\nHoliday Songs of Israel\n\nRounder\n\nHazeremos Una Merenda (Let’s Make a Meal)\n\nPhillis Elaine Clark and Cheryl Bensman Rowe, singers\n\nThe Western Wind Vocal Ensemble\n\nThe Chanukkah Story\n\nWestern Wind Records\n\nOcho Kandelikas (Eight Little Candles)\n\nWritten and performed by Flory Jagoda\n\nKantikas Di Mi Nona\n\nAltaras Recordings\n\nI Have a Little Dreydle\n\nBy Michael Gelbart\n\nTheme played on recorder\n\nThe Chanukkah Story\n\nWestern Wind Records\n\nVariations on a theme from Handel’s oratorio “Judas Maccabeus” Variations 10, 11 (partial)\n\nBy Ludwig van Beethoven\n\nMischa Maisky, cello and Martha Argerich, piano\n\nBeethoven: Cello Sonatas\n\nDGG\n\nAl Hanisim (For the Miracles) from “Hanukkah Cantata”\n\nBy David Ludwig\n\nTune by Dov Frimer\n\nChoral Arts Society of Philadelphia\n\nMatthew Glandorf, conductor\n\nChoral Music of David Ludwig\n\nAl Hanisim (For the Miracles)\n\nMusic by Dov Frimer, arranged by Hankus Netsky\n\nCantor Yitzchak Meir Helfgot, singer\n\nItzhak Perlman, violin\n\nHankus Netsky, piano\n\nRecorded live at the National Menorah Lighting, 2010\n\nCourtesy of American Friends of Lubavitch (Chabad)\n\nMi Yimalel (Who Can Retell)\n\nTraditional\n\nKol Yisrael Choir\n\nChanukah, Oh, Chanukah from “To Celebrate a Miracle”\n\nby Samuel Adler\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music Wind Symphony\n\nRodney Winther, conductor\n\nA Hanukka Celebration\n\nMilken Archive of American Jewish Music, Naxos\n\nChanukah, Oh, Chanukah\n\nPete Seeger, singer and banjo\n\nWith Voices Together We Sing\n\nFolkways\n\nO Ir Kleyne Likhtelekh (O You Little Lights)\n\nMusic by Zavel Zilberts, words by Morris Rosenfeld;

In addition to Perlman and Benedetti, she has signed two other IMG clients to Primo Artists, the noted French violinist Arnaud Sussmann and the Philadelphia-based conductor Cristian Măcelaru. Lee's new offices are located in Manhattan's Flatiron District.\n\nIMG Artists did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the moves. The company underwent a dramatic restructuring in September, in which several senior staffers left. A year earlier, its longtime managing director, Elizabeth Sobol, quit to run Universal Music Group.\n\n(LinkedIn)\n\n\"After nearly 17 years at IMG Artists and with the company's recent restructuring in September, it felt like the right time and a natural next step for me to go out on my own,\" said Lee in an e-mail. \"I am very grateful for all the opportunities I've had there and am looking forward to focusing my energies on further developing my artists' careers with more autonomy.\"\n\nThe 69-year-old Perlman made a similar move in 1986 when he left his longtime management at ICM Artists for then-upstart IMG. Benedetti, 27, signed to IMG in 2005 and has been with Lee since (another firm, Emblem Artists, handles her general management; Lee oversees her North and South American dates). In many ways, both moves reflect the personal nature and close loyalties of the artist management business.\n\nThe launch of Primo Artists was first reported on the Slipped Disc blog.\n\nIn 2013, Lee appeared on WQXR's Conducting Business podcast to talk about the role of women conductors in the orchestra world.\n\n• Gig Alert: Nicola Benedetti appears at Subculture, Thursday 1/29\n\nA top manager at IMG Artists has left the management agency after 17 years and brought two of its biggest stars with her.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the violinist Itzhak Perlman became one of a handful of artists whose name carried weight with people who otherwise knew little about classical music. He gained recognition through his solos in “Schindler's List,” his stints on “Sesame Street” and PBS’s “Great Performances,” or his appearance at President Obama’s 2009 inauguration. Some may have encountered his forays into klezmer music. Perlman also won 15 Grammy Awards, including for his now-definitive accounts of Beethoven’s Violin Concerto and Mozart’s Sinfonia Concertante (with Pinchas Zukerman).\n\nPerlman's 70th birthday on Monday, Aug. 31 has brought fresh appraisals of a violinist who has been a media fixture almost since he came to New York from his native Tel Aviv in his early teens. WQXR on Monday (9 pm) will air a one-hour special exploring the violinist’s history of collaborations; there will also be chances to hear from three new recordings just out: an $85, 25-CD box set from Deutsche Grammophon containing performances from Bach to Berg; a three-CD set of select recordings from the EMI archives; and a new album of sonatas by Strauss and Fauré with pianist Emanuel Ax, also on DG.\n\nThe former set focuses on the violinist’s prime years as a virtuoso soloist — between 1968 and 2001 — with an emphasis on 18th and 19th century repertory (although Perlman has put little focus on modern music, the collection does include his landmark 1996 recording of the Stravinsky and Berg violin concertos). The EMI set (Warner Classics), called “The Perlman Sound,” focuses on concerto excerpts and short encore pieces (a 77-CD set is also due out in late September). In an accompanying essay, Yehuda Shapiro describes the Perlman sound as being “lustrous, warm and generous,” and with an ability to make technically difficult music seem easy.\n\nOther commentators have used terms like \"honeyed\" and \"golden\" to describe Perlman's approach. But as younger generations have put forward fresh approaches, there’s also a sense that Perlman is not as revered by these listeners and performers, who often prefer a more incisive, modernist approach. In a recent Los Angeles Times piece, violinist and writer Adam Baer offered this view:\n\n“Perlman has gotten a bad rap from some music aficionados, who've complained for years of his populist bent: that his vibrato is always on, an unchanging, wide-oscillating espressivo machine, or that he's been too concerned with connecting with audiences to be an innovative interpreter.”\n\nBaer continues: “Today, Perlman may sound too romantic, even schmaltzy, to on-trend listeners. But it's the intelligently emotive playing and virtuosity of violinists like Perlman, to say nothing of his specific voice and ability to serve as a generous leader, that has helped push these intriguing players to love great music and develop new approaches…It's his character, more than how much vibrato he uses in Bach, that should endure.”\n\nThe question of Perlman’s influence on the future of violin playing – especially among Jewish violinists – is the focus of a recent piece in the Jewish newspaper Forward: “Who Will Be the Next Itzhak Perlman?” \"Despite the enduring nostalgia of ‘Fiddler on the Roof,’ the fact remains that a majority of today’s greatest solo violinists are not Jewish,” writes author Benjamin Ivry. “Still, most of today’s violinists have assimilated lessons from great Jewish teachers and colleagues.”\n\nIvry submits his own list of inheritors of the Perlman mantle, a multi-national group that includes Cho-Liang Lin, Bracha Malkin, Vadim Repin, Lisa Batiashvili, Vadim Gluzman, Baiba Skride, Rachel Barton Pine, Jennifer Koh, Sarah Chang, Joel Link, Julia Fischer, Christian Tetzlaff, Karen Gomyo and Janine Jansen.\n\nOf course, considerations of Perlman's influence are not confined to the concert stage alone. He has taught violin since the mid-1970s, when he took a faculty post at Brooklyn College. In the last 15 years, he has taught at Juilliard, and in 1995, he and his wife Toby Perlman co-founded the Perlman Music Program, which offers training to young string players. He recently told Listen magazine, \"I always tell my kids and my students that they should never miss an opportunity to teach because it helps their own ability to play, and the same is true with me.\"\n\n(Getty Images Sport/Al Bello)\n\nPerlman has also been an advocate for rights of the disabled, having contracted polio at the age of four, which left his legs permanently paralyzed and requires him to get around on crutches or a motorized scooter (last year, he made headlines of a notorious sort when an Air Canada employee left him stranded at Toronto Pearson International Airport).\n\nYet Perlman has dismissed any nods to his perseverance in the face of his handicap as “baloney” and he has often said, with characteristic wit, that it is his large hands have been a bigger impediment to his career. “My hands are rather big for a violinist so my big, fat fingers have to struggle the further I move up the instrument,” he said in an early interview. He goes on to demonstrate sections of Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto finale, showing little evidence of strain.\n\nItzhak Perlman was supposed to have been en route to North Carolina Tuesday night, but the eminent violinist canceled his plans and remained in New York, speaking of his outrage against the state's House Bill 2.\n\n\"The proverbial whatever it is hit the fan,\" Perlman told WQXR, hours after he made the decision.\n\nThe legislation, which has been colloquially called the \"Bathroom Bill,\" has rolled back protections of discrimination again gay and transgender people. With his cancellation, Perlman has joined artists including Ringo Star and Bruce Springsteen in standing up against the law.\n\nAs of Monday, the virtuoso violinist had planned to perform the Bruch Violin Concerto No. 1, a concert that had been scheduled more than a year ago. \"The main reason that I was going was because I was concerned of the effect it would have on the orchestra financially and so on.\" He had even sent out a statement saying he would donate his fee for the concert to Equity North Carolina, an organization fighting to repeal HB2.\n\nPerlman also wanted to make his stance on the law known, \"So I asked them make an insert into the program with a statement as to how I feel about that, and this morning I found out they were not allowed,\" he said Tuesday afternoon, adding, \"that was the final straw.\"\n\nOver his career, Perlman, who was stricken with polio when he was 4, has crusaded for rights for people with disabilities, and he's also been an outspoken advocate for gay marriage. But Tuesday, he couldn't recall having previously cancelled a program because of his politics.\n\n\"My first inclination was to go and play because I was thinking of the musicians,\" he said. \"I was not feeling comfortable being told that I can't voice my opinion.\" He said that he would be happy to return to the state if the law is repealed. \"If I'm invited. Maybe I'll never be invited again,\" he joked.\n\nThe North Carolina Symphony announced that it would cancel the concert and contact ticket holders. It also posted the following statement: \"The North Carolina Symphony welcomes all people with our hearts and minds open and we are honored to share our music-making with everyone.\"\n\nLISTEN:\n\n9 pm — The Young Artists Showcase meets the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in Saratoga for an evening of Mendelssohn, Schumann and Strauss.

But there are some confirmed names, including Jackie Evancho, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and — most recently — the Piano Guys. Two of these acts wade into classical crossover territory and one has been doing choral arrangements for the president for decades.\n\nAhead of Friday's swearing-in, let's look back at the classical presence during some more recent inaugural events (plus one precedent-setting honorable mention).\n\nUnited States Marine Band (1801)\n\nDuring his tenure as president, Thomas Jefferson also assumed the role of music lover in chief. An amateur violinist and cellist, Jefferson once called music \"the favorite passion of my soul.\" So it should come as no surprise that Jefferson needed music to be front and center at his inauguration. Joseph Haydn was among Jefferson's favorite composers, so we'd like to think that Joe was just too busy to journey to D.C. to conduct for one of his biggest fans. Instead, Jefferson was the first president to have the Marine Band play at the inauguration and gave it the nickname of \"the President's own.\" The band has been the longest running inaugural performer since.\n\nMarian Anderson (1957)\n\nMarian Anderson had a long relationship with performances in the capital. A fitting place to start is April 9, 1939. That month, as Hitler’s armies were preparing to invade Poland, Howard University invited Marian Anderson to Washington in order to sing for its concert series. Such an immense talent was bound to attract an equally great crowd, but the most fitting venue — the Daughters of the American Revolution’s Constitution Hall — rejected Anderson’s presence in the concert hall. The nearby segregated Central High School also denied the presence of an international opera star for the same reason. Instead, she performed on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, for a crowd of 75,000 people.\n\nAdvances in the tenacious struggle for social justice and equality were reflected 18 years later, when Anderson was invited back to Washington to sing the national anthem at the second inauguration ceremony of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Four years later, she graced the Capitol again to perform at the Kennedy inauguration.\n\nMormon Tabernacle Choir (1965)\n\nThe Mormon Tabernacle Choir is no stranger to a presidential audience. It has performed for the chief executive 11 times in its history, the first being at the Taft White House in 1911. The first of their five inaugural performances took place in 1965, at the inaugural ceremony for a recently elected Lyndon B. Johnson. The choir’s selection for that day was “This is my Country,” with Richard P. Condie conducting. Since Johnson, it has performed at the inaugural ceremonies for Presidents Nixon, Reagan and George H.W. Bush and his son. With a scheduled performance at the swearing-in of Trump, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir will chalk up a inaugural sixth performance in its storied history.\n\n(“This is My Country” can be heard during the first two minutes of the inauguration video below.)\n\nJessye Norman (1985)\n\nRonald Reagan’s second inauguration was the coldest on record — as if a 7 degree noon temperature wasn't frigid enough, wind temperatures dipped as low as negative 20 degrees that afternoon. Luckily, the inauguration particulars are flexible, so the public ceremony was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda. Soprano Jessye Norman must have been delighted, as the decision meant she could focus on her voice instead of her internal temperature. After Georgetown University President Rev. Timothy Healy’s invocation, Norman took to the podium with the audience huddled around her and sang an Aaron Copland arrangement of the Shaker folk song “Simple Gifts.”\n\n(Skip to 8:55 for Norman’s performance.)\n\nMarilyn Horne (1993)\n\nEight years after Reagan’s second inauguration, “Simple Gifts” was sung again, this time under more favorable weather conditions. This time, it was Marilyn Horne who was given the honor. She followed that performance with that of another song, Portia Nelson’s “Make a Rainbow.\"\n\nSusan Graham and Denyce Graves (2005)\n\nWhen George W. Bush won a second term in office, inauguration organizers must have decided to double down on the event’s operatic presence. They requested the talents of mezzo-sopranos Susan Graham and Denyce Graves, who sang “God Bless this House” and “American Anthem,” respectively. The duo shared their voices on a huge stage, literally — Bush’s second ceremony saw the largest inauguration platform that has ever been created.\n\nYo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman, Anthony McGill and Gabriela Montero (2009)\n\nIn 2008, “change” was one of Barack Obama’s campaign buzzwords. His first inauguration committee took that to heart and broke from the previous operatic trend by opting for a chamber performance. The quartet of Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman, Anthony McGill and Gabriela Montero premiered a new piece from composer John Williams titled “Air and Simple Gifts,” making Obama the third of the last five presidents to incorporate that old Shaker folk tune into the inaugural festivities. This time, the performance was actually recorded before the ceremony — the day’s freezing temperatures would have proven just too much for the live instruments.\n\nIf you were a young violinist in the 1980s, there’s almost no doubt that your dream teacher would have been Dorothy DeLay. Her unorthodox teaching style broke with the stereotypical rigidity of older, European teachers. She connected with her students on a fundamental level, and in the process developed the talents of some of music’s most notable violinists. As Allan Kozinn noted in his obituary for the violinist, DeLay was the first American “to be regarded as a master violin teacher in the tradition of Galamian and Leopold Auer.”\n\nDeLay had the magic touch; looking at a list of some of her notable former students, it’s clear that DeLay was basically the closest thing the violin world had to a true-to-life Gandalf.\n\nAnne Akiko Meyers\n\nHer classical bonafides — she’s performed with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, the National Symphony and the London Symphony Orchestra, among others — are without question. But she’s also notable for taking her violin beyond classical, collaborating with composers such as Wynton Marsalis, Chris Botti and Michael Bolton.\n\nSarah Chang\n\nAt just 8-years-old, she made her debut with the New York Philharmonic. In 1999, music critic Bernard Holland praised the young violinist’s skill, capping his adulation by writing “the ancients would certainly have had Ms. Chang emerging fully formed from some Botticellian scallop shell.” Since then, she’s traveled the world performing with major orchestras; her international presence makes it all the more fitting that she even carried the Olympic torch back in 2004.\n\nItzhak Perlman\n\nBy far the oldest student on this list, and (so far) the only one with a New York City street named after him. As a student, Perlman studied under both DeLay and Galamian. But when the two teachers split over widely differing approaches to the violin, Perlman took DeLay’s side — a further testament to how much she meant to her students.\n\nMidori\n\nIn 1982, an 11-year-old Midori moved to the United States to begin studying violin with DeLay. Her already admirable skills must have further improved; by the end of the year, Zubin Mehta had invited her to perform with the New York Philharmonic for its New Year’s Eve concert. Like DeLay, education is an important factor in Midori’s musical mission — she’s a professor of violin and holds the Jascha Heifetz Chair at USC’s Thornton School of Music.\n\nCho-Liang Lin\n\nAfter meeting Itzhak Perlman, a young Cho-Liang Lin decided to audition for an education at Juilliard, where he would be able to study with the same teacher as the renowned violinist. Lin made his New York debut at Lincoln Center’s 1979 Mostly Mozart Festival and just over 10 years later he joined the Juilliard faculty. In 2001, he assumed the directorship of the La Jolla Music Society’s Summerfest.\n\nIn 2022, this program airs at 5 pm on Dec. 18 on WQXR.\n\nKick off your Chanukah festivities with an evening of music hosted by violinist Itzhak Perlman.
