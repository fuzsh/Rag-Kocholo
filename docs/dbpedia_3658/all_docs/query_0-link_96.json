While both halves of the city remembered the event in their own fashions, emphasizing their particular ideologies and philosophies and in some ways competing with each other, this 750th anniversary became a cultural event of the first order. There were dozens of exhibitions, many citywide and others focusing on districts and neighborhoods; there were symposia, literary evenings, concerts, restoration projects —all designed to revive public consciousness of Berlin's history and culture. It was a major event of urban self-reflection. The Berlin anniversary also was the impetus for two international, interdisciplinary conferences in North America: at the Universite de Montreal and the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, both in October 1987. The organizers of the Minneapolis conference, Charles W. Haxthausen, Heidrun Suhr, and myself, selected as the conference theme (and title) \"Culture and Metropolis: Production and Reception of Culture and the Arts in Berlin, 1900 to the Present.\" The participants found that the interdisciplinary perspectives offered through the fifty-five papers presented by speakers representing a variety of disciplines greatly enriched their own understanding of Berlin and stimulated new approaches to questions about urban culture in general. Encouraged by the success of this undertaking, we, the conference organizers, have put together this volume of essays on twentieth-century cultural responses to Berlin, in the hope that it will be of interest to a broader readership. Charles Haxthausen and Heidrun Suhr have edited the twelve essays in the present collection, and have shaped it, not as the usual \"conference proceedings,\" but as a coherent compilation of contributions to the study of metropolitan culture, using Berlin in a paradigmatic sense. These essays have in most cases been substantially revised and significantly expanded beyond the papers presented at the conference. IX\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nThe essay by Peter Jelavich is an expanded version of a paper presented in Montreal but not in Minneapolis, included here because of its appropriateness. We are grateful to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Washington, D. C., which holds the copyright on the essay, for permission to include it here. While there was considerable enthusiasm for this publication, there were no funds to translate concept into reality until the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) generously offered its support. We are deeply grateful for their generosity, not only because it made the book's publication financially feasible, but also because it reflects a basic interest in a part of German studies that centers on the urban scene, one that is particularly conducive to interdisciplinary inquiry. Thanks are also due to the Max Kade Foundation of New York for its financial assistance. The foundation is well known in the United States for its support of research and scholarship with a German focus. We hope that the present volume will further the goal to which the Max Kade Foundation, the German Academic Exchange Service, and the contributors to this volume all subscribe: a critical and, therefore, better understanding of German culture, politics, and society in this century. Gerhard Weiss\n\nIntroduction Charles W. Haxthausen and Heidrun Suhr\n\nThere are cities that one can describe only insofar as one proceeds from what is common and typical in their origins, then there are others for which their peculiar determinants are more important. The former are almost always true capitals and centers of a country, are rich and beautiful cities, harmoniously developed organisms of history; the latter are, on the other hand, as a rule cities that had to develop artificially, under all kinds of difficulties, and had to adapt to unfavorable circumstances. If those of thejlrst type resemble happy persons with nobly developed talents, the others resemble characters who let themselves be soured by life and, because of the hardships of existence they have endured, become surly and problematic. Berlin belongs to the cities of this latter type. Karl Scheffler, Berlin: Ein Stadtschicksal\n\nThe purpose of this volume is not to document yet again Berlin's contribution to modern German and international culture. The theme \"Culture and Metropolis\" is not intended as a celebration of Berlin as a cultural capital, according to the Wunschbild of an \"Athens on the Spree,\" or as the German equivalent of Paris, London, or New York. Nor is this book intended as a representative survey of Berlin's cultural history, although its twelve essays touch nearly every decade of this century. Some of the cultural phenomena treated here are little known outside the German-speaking world, and, conversely, this volume has little to say about some of Berlin's most celebrated cultural personalities. These studies have another focus: the often uneasy relationship between twentieth-century Berlin and the culture produced there —in literature, poetry, film, cabaret, and the visual arts. In short, they explore the cultural mediation of a city in which such mediation has always been problematic. The novelist Georg Hermann once remarked that the relationship of most Berliners to their city is an ambivalent one, \"neither fish nor fowl: they cannot do without it, but neither can they come to terms with it. And least of all can they comprehend Berlin. Between the old and the new there is no harmony, as there is in Paris. And no art knows how to span a bridge xi\n\nxii\n\nCharles W. Haxthausen and Heidrun Suhr\n\nacross this gaping crevice.\" This statement vividly evokes the experience of living in Berlin today. It clearly applies to the city that was divided by a •wall for twenty-eight years, and despite the rapid, dramatic, and unexpected changes set in motion on November 9, 1989, it is arguably still as hard to come to terms with Berlin as ever. Yes, the flow of traffic between the eastern and western halves of the city has been restored, and the Zusammenwachsen, or growing together, of the divided city has occurred at a pace exceeding the boldest predictions, but these historic developments have if anything only dramatized the disharmony, the abnormality, the incomprehensibility of Berlin. The idiosyncratic character of this city might seem to be merely the most enduring, most palpable consequence of a war that ended nearly half a century ago, leaving a \"gaping crevice\" between past and present. Gazing at the ruins of the Anhalt Railway Station, or standing on the once hectic Potsdamer Platz, where the restored stream of traffic only exacerbates the emptiness of the surrounding grassy spaces, it is tempting to sentimentalize \"lost Berlin,\" the rupture with the past is so painfully apparent here.1 Blaming Hitler and the cold war for Berlin's present condition is of course partly justified, but the experience of discontinuity is not peculiar to postwar Berlin —Georg Hermann's observation on Berlin was not inspired by the city of today, but by the Berlin of 1912, and it could have been written at almost any time during the past two centuries.2 To idealize Berlin as if it had once been a German Paris or Vienna is profoundly to misunderstand its history and its unique ethos. The year before the Machtergreifung and more than a decade before the first Allied bombs rained down on the city, Siegfried Kracauer was already writing of Berlin's streets \"without memory.\" This city, he wrote, seemed to have \"a magical means of eradicating all memories. . . . Only in Berlin are the transformations of the past so radically stripped from memory.\"3 In a book published the same year, Wilhelm Hausenstein described Berlin as seemingly a city without history, without origins, without foundation. \"It is as if Berlin were built on nothing. . . . One feels no ground, and precisely this is the location of the city.\"4 In Berlin the present overwhelmed the past, unrelenting change assaulted the sense of continuity and stability. For Carl Einstein, Berlin was a place \"destined to dissolve and to overcome every tradition . . . and daily prepared for any change. \"5 This characterization, dating from the Weimar era, has been resoundingly confirmed since November 9, 1989, but even before World War I, Karl Scheffler was saying the same thing: it was the tragic fate of Berlin \"always to be in the process of becoming and never to be.\"6 Even before Berlin was transformed by Germany's political unification and late industrialization into a modern metropolis, there was considerable testimony concerning its otherness, its anomalous character among Euro-\n\nIntroduction\n\nxiii\n\npean cities. Early in the nineteenth century, when Berlin was still essentially a Hof- und Residenzstadt, Madame de Stae'l described it as a \"quite modern city\" seemingly without a past, in which one had \"no sense of the history of the land or the character of its inhabitants.\" This might be fine for an American city, she conceded, \"but in our ancient part of the world one has need of the past.\"7 In characterizations of the city, this trait of a relentlessly self-renewing modernity, unchecked by any ballast of tradition, is complemented by other qualities that seem to be equally part of the Berlin ethos. It has long been decried as an artificial city, configured by pecuniary or political ambition rather than by an urbane architectural vision, a city without organic relationship to the surrounding land. It has, at least since the immigration of 6,000 Huguenots in the seventeenth century, had an ethnically heterogeneous population —it has been a melting pot somewhat in the American fashion, and yet a capital whose population did not constitute a cross-section of the German nation. Berlin has also been noted for its hard-nosed practical-minded materialism and a caustic skepticism toward the lyrical and metaphysical. Such observations have constituted a recurrent litany for over two centuries. From today's perspective, however, what earlier critics saw as anomalous about Berlin has made it, uniquely among European cities, a paradigm of modernity. If one accepts Marshall Berman's broad definition of modernism \"as a struggle to make ourselves at home in a constantly changing world,\"8 then Berlin is and has been for more than a century the European capital of modernism. Moreover, Berlin's history in the last hundred years is uniquely a microcosm of the major upheavals of the modern era. It has been successively an imperial capital, the site of violent political revolution, and the capital city of a fragile, ill-fated democracy and subsequently of the fascist Third Reich, after which it was reduced to rubble. Following the war it became a divided city, reflecting the major geopolitical division of the world. And even now, as the once rigid political blocs of the Cold War are breaking up, Berlin has been by far the European city most profoundly affected by this dramatic development. It appears that in the foreseeable future it will be uniquely a microcosm of a Europe in which \"east\" and \"west\" have again become primarily geographical designations. All of this makes the cultural response to Berlin a matter of more than parochial significance, and an issue that transcends the agenda of German studies. Through all these changes Berlin has experienced another significant genesis. While it has retained its most characteristic traits through two centuries of continual transformation, the city's raison d'etre has changed. First it evolved from a royal residence and garrison city to an industrial center whose primary business, to borrow Calvin Coolidge's famous phrase, was\n\nXIV\n\nCharles W. Haxthausen and Heidrun Suhr\n\nbusiness. \"Noisy, matter-of-fact Berlin,\" Walter Benjamin called it, \"the city of work and the metropolis of business.\"9 Then Hitler dreamed of remaking the city into a latter-day imperial Rome. After 1949 the eastern half of the city insistently presented itself as \"Berlin, capital of the GDR,\" thereby seeking to underline its legitimacy and its continuity -with the historical Berlin; but the western half of Berlin, geographically and demographically the larger of the two, developed into a city whose business was culture, not only through the creative activity that flourished there, but also through its festivals, theaters, and orchestras and its rapidly proliferating museums. At the end of the 1980s, the annual culture budget of West Berlin was over 550 million marks, well more than half the federal outlays for culture in the entire United States.10 This statistic, however, must be interpreted in light of another: over half of West Berlin's income budget came from federal subsidies.11 These two figures are intimately connected, for during the era of the wall, West Berlin's vibrant cultural life was no spontaneous flowering of the human spirit. However authentic its individual components, in its totality this was a cultural program that served political ends. As the wall became a seemingly permanent and accepted feature of Berlin life, culture became indispensable to the successful functioning of the city's life-support system. Otherwise, as Jane Kramer wrote, nothing was asked of West Berlin \"beyond its own complicity in surviving.\" Hence, it could be said that for the western half of the city, \"the real business of Berlin [was] Berlin.\"12 After the opening of the borders, however, West Berlin suddenly rediscovered business of a more conventional kind: it became a marketplace for the GDR. This glittering enclave of Western consumer culture soon proved to exacerbate the impatience of East Germans with the dream of a \"third way\" between capitalism and communism, a radical democratic socialism that would be a viable alternative to the social market economy of the Federal Republic. Those GDR citizens who remained sober in the face of West Berlin's seductions proved, by the beginning of 1990, to be in the minority. But whatever happens, Berlin has clearly entered a new era whose shape remains as yet uncertain, but which seems likely to restore the city's former status as a major European metropolis. It is today, perhaps more dramatically than ever, in that \"process of becoming\" that Scheffler saw as its fate among cities. The abruptness of the drastic changes Berlin has undergone over the past century and a half has meant that the relationship between the city and its inhabitants has not evolved gradually, but has had to be repeatedly renegotiated with each generation. Culture has been both an agent and a product of these negotiations, and it is this function of culture that the present collection addresses.\n\nIntroduction\n\nXV\n\nThe first four essays in this volume deal with early twentieth-century attempts to come to terms with the reality of a city that had undergone a rapid metamorphosis. In 1871 Berlin had become the capital of a united Germany, but prior to this it had begun a period of rapid growth as a consequence of industrialization, which had begun in the 1830s and subsequently attracted an ever-increasing flow of immigrants, mostly from the east. Between 1800 and 1900, Berlin's population increased from 170,000 to nearly 2 million; at the peak of the city's growth, between 1871 and 1919, the population of Greater Berlin quadrupled, from 915,000 to 3.7 million.13 This phenomenal tempo of development and the surge of construction it generated made Berlin the most modern city in Europe—a decidedly mixed blessing. John Czaplicka's essay, \"Pictures of a City at Work, circa 1890-1933,\" examines selected images of Berlin as reflections of \"how the city functioned, how precisely it was reconstituting itself\" during this period of runaway growth, intense social flux, and industrial expansion. Central within this process was the subdivision of the city according to functions and social classes, and it is this phenomenon that is the primary focus of Czaplicka's essay. Drawing on specific works by Hans Baluschek, Franz Skarbina, Heinrich Zille, George Grosz, and Karl Hubbuch, Czaplicka examines how the visual signification of the functioning city in specific images both reflected and reinforced class consciousness. He sees the visual arts not as a passive mirror of the city as it was configured by other discourses, but as an active contributor to the conceptualization and interpretation of urban experience. Lothar Miiller's essay, \"The Beauty of the Metropolis: Toward an Aesthetic Urbanism in Turn-of-the-Century Berlin,\" examines the critique of modern Berlin as the \"Capital of all modern ugliness,\" the \"Chicago on the Spree,\" and the attempt to develop an aestheticized relationship to this urban reality, so offensive to the cultivated eye. In 1908 August Endell, the Jugendstil designer and architect,14 published a book, Die Schonheit der groften Stadt (The beauty of the metropolis), which constituted a pioneering effort to redeem the uncongenial urban landscape of Berlin as a domain conducive to aesthetic experience. Endell's book introduced into German discourse on the city the Parisian concept of the flaneur.15 For Endell, however, the aesthetic experience of Berlin did not arise from a discovery of aesthetic virtue in the architecture, alternately drearily prosaic and eclectically pompous, which made any comparison to the more established European capitals an embarrassment. Rather, the beauty Endell discovered in Berlin could, Miiller explains, \"peacefully co-exist with the architectural ugliness and shapelessness\" of the city, for it was a beauty centered not in the object but in the mode of seeing, in a cultivated responsiveness to the fugitive charms of accidental tableaux. These were born of the interaction of the artificial and the natural, by the transfiguration of the ugly, graceless cityscape by the in-\n\nxviCharles W. Haxthausen and Heidrun Suhr\n\ntervention of nature, by light, and by atmosphere —creating a beauty that took form in the eyes of the aesthetically sensitized flaneur. In this manner, Endell approached the city with the emergent formalist aesthetic articulated by the Munich sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand in his highly influential book Das Problem der Form in der bildenden Kunst. There Hildebrand wrote that in the visual arts the \"true poetic effect\" arises from \"the manner of seeing,\" from how the object is transfigured by representation, not in any significance that it may have in itself.16 However, Endell's manner of seeing, of representing the city to himself and to his readers, was shaped by French impressionism, a late import to Germany, a movement that had itself discovered modern, Haussmannized Paris as subject matter in the 1860s and 1870s. There is irony in the fact that Endell offered an impressionistic verbal painting of Berlin that found no equivalent among the city's best impressionist artists —Liebermann, Corinth, and Slevogt. At the peak of their careers in these years, they shunned the urban landscape of the city in which they lived and worked. It was left to the expressionist generation, in both literature and art, to embrace the city passionately, if no less ambivalently, and to exalt its very artificiality. Georg Hermann, no expressionist himself, spoke for this new sensibility when he declared that \"this strange phenomenon the metropolis stands outside of all laws known to the earth. . . . All the laws of space, the laws of light of the countryside—of the plain as well as the mountains, of the forest and even of the villages —are violated here.\"17 In general, for the Berlin expressionist artists and writers, their relationship to the city was a tortured love-hate affair. There was an intensification of feeling toward the city; that \"blase indifference\" that Georg Simmel thought necessary for the mental balance of the urbanite was shed as a stultifying bourgeois defense. Now the extremes of Berlin were celebrated in a liberation of feeling and instinct. For the avant-garde the city, widely viewed from the provinces as the \"Whore Babylon,\" became an ally in the attack on bourgeois values.18 Yet, for the first time there also appeared an overtly apocalyptic tone in the verbal and visual images of Berlin: verses such as Georg Heym's \"Umbra vitae\" and Jakob van Hoddis's \"Weltende\" are classic poetic examples, as are the painter Ludwig Meidner's frenzied apocalyptic cityscapes of 1913. This foreboding aspect, however, has perhaps been overemphasized, leading many commentators to caricature and oversimplify the relationship of the expressionist generation to Berlin as a wholly negative one. In his essay, Charles W. Haxthausen reexamines the Berlin imagery of Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, who during the Weimar era came to be viewed as the painter of prewar Berlin, as the artist who more than any other found an effective plastic expression for the daily life of the capital. Since World War II, however, Kirchner's images of the city have increasingly come to be\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\nviewed as images of urban alienation and anxiety. Haxthausen, returning to the source material, reaffirms the original critical view of Kirchner as a celebrant of the city, who discovered within its hectic flux and saturation of the senses a manifestation of vitalist energies and the basis of a new aesthetic. The largest component of Kirchner's Berlin imagery consists of subjects drawn from popular culture —the circus, revues, and variety shows — subject matter that was largely new to German art. For this reason, Peter Jelavich's essay on vaudeville, cabaret, and revue in Berlin forms an interesting complement to Haxthausen's, for Jelavich shows that these modern, popular art forms were themselves important to Berliners as representations, as mediations, of the modern city they inhabited. Such entertainments, he argues, contributed to the molding of an urban identity for an expanding immigrant population. \"In the face of a large body of literature (and not merely 'provincial' literature) condemning the 'German Chicago,' \" writes Jelavich, these shows exhorted Berliners \"to be proud of their modernity.\" The very form of the revue, with its short acts and abrupt contrasts, was seen as especially suited to the altered urban psyche: \"The fragmentation and intensification of sense experience in everyday metropolitan life transformed the perceptual apparatus of modern urbanites to such an extent that they were no longer capable of the type of continuous reflection demanded by conventional drama. Stage presentations thus had to become as multiform and disjunct as the presentation of everyday life in the streets, the shops and the offices of the modern metropolis.\" After Germany's defeat in the war, the tone of these entertainments changed: instead of celebrating Berlin's modernity, the shows were now permeated with nostalgia for prewar Berlin, when they dealt with the city at all. And where modernity was celebrated, the United States rather than contemporary Berlin was its paradigm. Beth Lewis's essay examines the artistic appropriation of a darker side of popular culture, the theme of sexual violence, which had enjoyed enormous popularity in the dime novels of the Wilhelmine era and which during the war and its aftermath became, for the first time, a common subject in the visual arts. If Holofernes and John the Baptist were the victims of sexual violence in the symbolist art of the fin de siecle, the tables were now turned: artists such as George Grosz and Otto Dix seemed to exact revenge; the theme of the femme fatale, Lewis writes, gave way to the Lustmord or sex murder. George Grosz, a native Berliner and an avid reader of this literary colportage, was the first German visual artist to focus on this type of urban theme. Here, Grosz offers an interesting contrast with prewar attempts to view the city aesthetically. Adopting the posture that the very concept of art was an invention of the hated bourgeoisie, Grosz made no attempt to aestheticize the city as had Kirchner and Endell. For him its ugliness was not merely visual, but above all moral. Although Kirchner's eroticism bordered\n\nxviii\n\nCharles W. Haxthausen and Heidrun Suhr\n\non the kinky, it manifested an innocent, quasi-religious belief in sexual instinct as inherently good —a kind of redemption would ostensibly come from its liberation and fulfillment. For Grosz, sexuality again became linked with vice and with brutality, with the darkest, most sordid human impulses. And if Kirchner celebrated the public Berlin —the streets and popular entertainments — Grosz, in his Lustmord images, at least, presented a brutal expose of the horrors that went on behind closed doors in the metropolis. One of the ironies of this is that, in spite of his radical political position of those years, Grosz's vision of urban depravity coincided with the view of the reactionary \"volkisch\" elements that would triumph in 1933. The essays by Harald Jahner and David Frisby are concerned with the literary responses to Berlin by two of the major German writers of the Weimar Republic—Alfred Doblin and Siegfried Kracauer. Doblin's Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929) is the most celebrated Groftstadtroman, or big city novel, in German literature. Because of its formal innovation and its subject matter —it traces the odyssey of its protagonist, Franz Biberkopf, through contemporary Berlin —it has been compared to Joyce's Ulysses, published seven years earlier. In Harald Jahner's essay, \"The City as Megaphone in Alfred Doblin's Berlin Alexanderplatz,\" we encounter once more a brutal and alienating Berlin —the city functions as the antagonist of Franz Biberkopf, just released from prison in the northern suburb of Tegel. But the root of this antagonism is here not presented as a flaw of the \"dehumanizing\" city but of Biberkopf himself, who persists in clinging to a mode of subjectivity, to an illusion of personal autonomy that the city has rendered anachronistic. Similarly, as Jahner formulates it, Doblin felt that \"the city had so profoundly altered the relationship of individuals to their environment and to the apparatus of their own consciousness that it was no longer possible to write about its inhabitants in classical narrative forms.\" Accordingly, Doblin mixed conventional narrative with montage. Line (narration, or the movements and actions of Biberkopf) penetrates plane (a montage of disparate depersonalized texts out of which the city is constructed, making it, as Jahner evocatively characterizes it, \"a speaking fabric of texts\"). These two devices represent the mutually antagonistic principles of textual construction in the novel. Siegfried Kracauer, the subject of David Frisby's essay, belongs in an altogether different category from Doblin. Best known in this country for his classic study of early German film, From Caligari to Hitler, Kracauer served as Berlin review editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung from 1930 to 1933, and much of his writing on the city was originally published on its Feuilleton page. He approached his task as a critical one: to decipher the deeper social reality behind the city's epiphenomena, to deconstruct urban experience — or, as Frisby puts it, \"to reveal what lies beneath the surface of the world taken for granted.\" There is much in this enterprise that is reminiscent of\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nBenjamin's writings on Paris. Yet, if Kracauer's characterization of the fugitive character of Berlin's modernity continues a tradition of urban discourse, the nature of his view of the city is a product of Weimar Berlin. There is here a greater concern with the inner workings of the city; this is an attempt to understand Berlin rather than merely to represent or aestheticize its distinctive brand of urban experience. During the New York fiscal crisis of the 1970s Ronald Reagan, not yet president, reportedly expressed his opposition to federal bail-out proposals with the remark that \"true Americans don't love New York.\" This opposition between patriotism and gesundes Volksempfmden (wholesome popular sentiment) on the one hand and the \"decadent\" cosmopolitan culture of the metropolis on the other was a favorite theme of the Nazis. In her essay, Linda Schulte-Sasse explores the fascinating subject of the treatment of Berlin in Nazi films. Initially, the city was often dealt with retrospectively, serving as a metaphor for the negative memories of the Weimar Republic — communism, capitalism, fragmentation, moral decadence, the subversion of national identity and German tradition through internationalism. The importance of Berlin in early Nazi films, Schulte-Sasse explains, lay in its function as a corrupted Heimat of the past, which needed to be retrieved, restored to its proper status as the heart of \"Germany\" —a redemption that could be achieved only by forces that had remained incorruptibly German. If the films made before 1940 tended to deal with Berlin retrospectively, culminating in the triumph of National Socialism, those made after 1940 usually presented the city as a locus of German Gemeinschaft, or community, thus illustrating a boast made by Joseph Goebbels: \"In barely ten years we have succeeded in making of this, the reddest city in the world after Moscow, a truly German city.'''' After 1945, Berlin remained a uniquely German city, although hardly in the way that Goebbels meant. Berlin became a conspicuous scar of German history. Far from being a city that eradicated memories, as Kracauer described it in the last days of the Weimar Republic, the Berlin of the postwar era compelled remembrance. Harald Hartung's essay, \"Lyric Poetry in Berlin since 1961,\" addresses the evolving but always tense relationship between lyric poetry and this obtrusive political reality. The year 1961 marked, of course, the erection of the wall, which consolidated, with concrete and barbed wire, the political division of the city. \"To be sure,\" Hartung states, \"the erection of the wall . . . has nothing to do with lyric poetry, yet in a special way it brought to a head the problem of writing poems, of writing poems in this city. . . . Lyric poetry in Berlin is different from lyric poetry in Munich, Cologne, Heidelberg, or in the Bavarian Forest.\" Now it was no longer Berlin's modernity and urban complexity that challenged the poet's powers of representation, but its unique political status. It was a reality that colored the simplest experiences, altered one's sense\n\nXX\n\nCharles W. Haxthausen and Heidrun Suhr\n\nof space and, at times, called into question the value, the legitimacy even, of the lyric enterprise. Completed shortly before the opening of the wall, Hartung's essay can be valued as a survey of lyric poetry in a period that has since come to an end. Dorothy Rosenberg's essay also addresses literature in Berlin during the era of the wall, not the insular city in the west, but the one that remained a capital, \"Berlin, capital of the German Democratic Republic.\" Rosenberg argues that for Westerners, \"the cultural history of the city tends to follow a relatively straight line of development and then suddenly shifts to a cultural history of its western half,\" reflecting an assumption \"that there is no postwar cultural history in its eastern half.\" Her essay is an antidote to this cultural myopia: she surveys the representation of the city in recent East German fiction, in the works of Christa Wolf, Giinter Kunert, Ulrich Plenzdorf, Helga Schubert, and others. Rosenberg is concerned both with the experience of East Berlin as reflected in that literature and with the perception of the city on \"the other side,\" which from the perspective of the East was not an island but, in Helga Schubert's inspired conceit, \"the forbidden room.\" As was pointed out earlier, Berlin has for centuries attracted large numbers of Fremde, outsiders either from the provinces or from foreign countries, who have immigrated there and settled, or have stayed for shorter periods. Most have come in search of economic well-being, but significant numbers have come for political freedom, for artistic and intellectual stimulation, or in quest of a freer and more adventurous style of living. This pattern has not changed. By the mid-1980s, approximately 250,000 of West Berlin's 2 million inhabitants were foreigners, not to mention the large numbers who have moved there from West Germany. If this sounds American, the analogy was not lost on commentators on Berlin: Suhr quotes Herwarth Walden's remark, \"Berlin is America as microcosm,\" and she also takes a critical look at this metaphor, which concealed important differences. After briefly surveying the patterns of immigration to Berlin, Suhr examines two current genres of writing relating to the experience of Fremde in Berlin: literature by foreign nationals, mostly Turkish writers, about their experience and that of the Gastarbeiter (\"guest workers\"); and literature —the often trendy so-called Szeneliteratur—which deals with West Germans who forsake the provinces to partake of the \"Berlin scene.\" Although these two categories of literature are written from vastly different sociological perspectives and present radically different experiences of the city, to a striking degree both revolve around a single district of Berlin — Kreuzberg. This district, where the first neighborhoods designed to house the urban poor were built, is today the site of a \"Turkish ghetto,\" a \"little Istanbul,\" and is also the center of Berlin's \"alternative culture\" —an\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxi\n\nalternative culture that is nurtured in part by the city's generous federal subsidies. Our volume concludes with an essay by Gerhard Weiss on yet another form of urban representation, the festivals commemorating Berlin's anniversaries. Cultural festivals have themselves become a contemporary art form, a form of mediation and representation. As Weiss observes: \"Anniversary celebrations tend to have their own agendas, for which history simply offers a convenient forum. They become happenings that reflect, amplify, and popularize the ideologies dominant in a society at a given time.\" Although Berlin has existed for 750 years, it has only twice marked the anniversary of its founding: in 1937, when the celebration became a \"Nazi festival\"; and in 1987, when it was celebrated on both sides of the wall, with two discrete festivals. Weiss's account of the 1937 celebration is interesting to read in relation to Linda Schulte-Sasse's essay on the image of Berlin in Nazi film, in which the city had been the focus of most of the evils Nazism was supposed to cure. The message of the 1937 celebration was that Berlin had become Nazified: It was the \"capital of the Third Reich, . . . aware of its German-Aryan heritage and of its Prussian military tradition. Its history had been reinterpreted to fit the National Socialist mold.\" For the 1987 celebration, early efforts at cooperation between the two halves of the city broke down. Each half had its own agenda: for East Berlin, the festival became a means by which the German Democratic Republic could assert its legitimacy by stressing East Berlin's role as a capital, and therefore as the locus of historical continuity, a message to which the massive architectural restorations of recent years lent support. In West Berlin, on the other hand, the stress was on such issues as the city's internationalism, the Jewish contribution to Berlin's history and culture, and of course, the continuity of West Berlin's culture with that of the city's past. In the divided festival that marked its 750th anniversary, Berlin, without intending to, remained true to the origins that it celebrated. \"From the beginning,\" Karl Scheffler wrote in 1910, \"Berlin has been a victim of its dualism.\"20 However, the dualism Scheffler was referring to was the dualism of the medieval nuclei of the present city, Berlin and Colin. Despite their proximity, for most of their history until 1709, there had been two cities and two administrations. \"The cities were at once divided and bound together in all things.\"21 Now, what was unthinkable in 1987 appears, less than three years later, to be imminent: Berlin will again become a single city, under a single administration. But it is likely to remain as problematic, as much the insistent, intrusive protagonist in the cultural artifacts produced there as ever. February 1990\n\nxxii\n\nCharles W.

Though sociologists, philosophers, and historians such as Ferdinand Tonnies, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, and Oswald Spengler described Berlin with quite different emphases and biases, each of them drew a picture of how the city functioned, how precisely it was reconstituting itself, and each took a political or moral stance toward the effects of this functioning and reconstitution. These discussants of urban transformation recognized new patterns emerging in the social, economic, and political relationships, and they saw that as a result of these changes the city was taking on a new gestalt. Accordingly, they tended to view the city as a system contingent on the modernizing forces of social, economic, and technological change. To a degree, one can propose that recognition of the city as a functioning system generated a discourse that extended to its pictorial imagery as well. This recognition led certain artists to configure Berlin not only in terms of its appearance, but also in terms of its workings, while it led others to devise ways to obscure the workings of the city. In the following analyses of selected Berlin images from the late Wilhelmine and early Weimar periods, my main concern is the pictorial configuration of this city as a functioning system with regard to its social and technological components. I also suggest the artists' active engagement in the contemporary discourse about the constitution of the modern city, and at least cursorily delineate their posi-\n\nFor Tadashi and Reiko\n\n3\n\n4\n\nJohn Czaplicka\n\ntions in regard to major issues such as social and technological progress. I discuss only those Berlin artists who subscribed to a naturalistic portrayal of those urban workings, but delved beneath the naturalistic surfaces to the concepts and abstractions that seemed to govern the particular imaging of the modern big city. I begin by discussing an allegorical and anecdotal work by Hans Baluschek, to demonstrate the concepts underlying his \"staging\" of an urban scene. I concentrate then on paintings by Franz Skarbina, raising questions about how the image of the functioning city was determined by social class and by attitudes toward social and technological progress. In a third section, \"The Rhythm of Man's Work,\" I look at several artists who represent the compulsive patterns of modern urban functioning. Finally, I examine a work by Neue Sachlichkeit artist Karl Hubbuch: a view of Berlin that reveals the contradictions and effects of that modern city at work.\n\n1. Staging an Urban Allegory circa 1900: The Functional Signs in Place Circa 1900 Hans Baluschek (1870-1935), an artist who had earned the titles of \"proletarian painter\" and \"painter of poor people\" for his \"naturalistic\" representation of urban life, l composed an allegory of modern workingclass life entitled Berlin Landscape (figure 1). In this unassuming cityscape Baluschek arranges some telling if still standard city props around a lone urban denizen making her way through the streets of Berlin. Using a montagelike method similar to one employed by several other late Wilhelmine and early Weimar artists,2 Baluschek constructs an urban environment from a few set pieces that, in their arrangement and relationships, manifest the artist's broader understanding of the functioning city and its operative signs and signals. This understanding enables the artist effectively to combine those signs with a more conventional iconography drawn from landscape painting in order to compose a compelling picture of proletarian existence in Berlin. It is an image that goes beyond the merely anecdotal. To characterize the appropriate milieu for his working-class figure, Baluschek sets the mood with subdued color and light, blue undertones —visible where the artist has scratched away the surface—earth colors, and the reflections from wet pavement. The dark, dank, enclosed space of the city contrasts with a clearing sky after a downpour. Color, light, and the atmospheric conditions temper the setting, suggesting the emotional disposition of its sole occupant. This mood and the signal props that Baluschek employs characterize and configure the generic image of a big, modern, industrial city while typifying certain highly industrialized working-class districts\n\nPictures of a City at Work\n\nFigure 1. Hans Baluschek. Berlin Landscape, c. 1900. Mixed media on cardboard, 96 x 63 cm. Brohan Museum,- Berlin.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nJohn Czaplicka\n\nof Berlin such as Wedding, Neukolln, Kreuzberg, Moabit, or parts of Schoneberg, where Baluschek himself lived. For as is often the case with the artist's Berlin imagery, while the specific location is left indeterminate, the character of a specific type of district in Berlin is evoked. Taking careful inventory of the scenic elements selected by the artist, the attentive beholder notes an exemplary \"one of each\" in the composition. In the left foreground a wooden barrier hung with a red warning sign closes off a street under construction; sand lies on the ground beside it. These temporary props convey the constant transformation within Berlin during this period, suggesting a process of modernization.3 A gas lantern on the curb next to the street, no longer modern in a city lighted in part by electricity (but maintained for its economy of operation), was a fixture of the less prosperous areas of the German capital. The arched red-brick viaducts together with the iron-and-glass station of the Berliner Municipal Railway (Stadtbahn) landmarked certain areas of the central city. The more immediate proximity of such stations to tenements (Mietskasernen) forms an iconographic constellation of mass housing and mass transportation that typified the modern metropolis. By inserting a proportionally smaller figure into this urban staging, Baluschek projects a human story that appears contingent upon a particular urban milieu. But, before interpreting this relationship that allegorizes the fate and purpose of an individual who stands as emblematic for a class, a structural reading of the artist's urban construct can offer insight into how he conceived the city in terms of its larger functioning. Baluschek's image evinces a typical state for most big and modern cities: every square meter of the urban surface is shown fenced-in and parceledoff—i. e., taken possession of. This partitioned surface is further subdivided by the arteries of road and rail and by the walkways of pedestrians. With an eye to these divisions and away from any of the symbolic or allegorical meanings, reference need be made to a central aspect of cities in general, their compartmentalization. For the compartmentalization of the city establishes frames of reference for the interpretation of its various signs. Exemplified lucidly in Baluschek's painting are the multifarious urban enclosures demarcated along functional and property lines. The street separated from the sidewalk by a curb conducts wagons; the sidewalk, pedestrians; trains run along the elevated tracks supported by a viaduct that allows for underpassage. The firewall that closes off the background thoroughly hinders the spread of fires, and the fence dividing the lot not only demarcates property, it also reserves and protects this parcel of remnant nature. The signature of laws, ordinances, and deeds is evident in this setting. This is a view of the city often given in Heimatbucher4 of the nineteenth century, a view meant to inform the German burgher about the modern and highly systematized functioning of the city.5\n\nPictures of a City at Work\n\n7\n\nEach of the functional compartments demarcated in the cityscape has a set of distinct signs related to a relatively closed system of communications. A red lantern warns vehicular traffic of danger. The sign on the fence may prohibit the entry of pedestrians; the movable signal high on the tracks directs commuter trains. By pairing such artificial signs with those found in nature, Baluschek seems to draw an analogy between reading the cityscape and reading the landscape. The flowers on the tree signify spring, and the clouds in the sky warn of rain or tell of its passing. The signs of the city, of course, belong specifically to its nature, which is maintained in a systematic and smooth functioning. From a broader perspective Baluschek appears to have conceived his urban construct as a system of such signs operative in their distinct functional contexts. One reads this city of functions. One heeds its signs. Beginning with the woman, the tree, and the Mietskasernen aligned in the center of the image, a second, more speculative and allegorical reading of the image presents little difficulty. In an enclave between the viaduct, the sidewalk, and the tenement, a remnant of nature in this landscape remains inaccessible to the urban denizen whose movements are guided by fence and railing. Clothed modestly in a blue apron over her plain dark dress, with a peaked hat adorned by a single red blossom, this working-class woman blends into her environment socially and chromatically (i.e., through corresponding blue undertones in her apron, in the back court of the tenement, and in various other places throughout the image). Only the red of the flowers in the wreath she holds sets her apart and has a symbolic function. The red blossoms arranged in a wreath to honor the dead have a vital counterpart in the blossoming of a chestnut tree in the spring. Correlating the colors of the wreath and the warning lantern, one might surmise that the woman is on the way to a demonstration. Given the season, the reds of a working woman free from work, and taking into account Baluschek's Social Democratic inclinations, one might suppose this landscape represents a first of May, and that the season and the raised semaphore signaling free passage are meant to imply progress. The season and the urban condition are meant to be understood in a state of transition, one motivated by political and technological change. Whether or not one agrees with this particular reading, Baluschek's urban composite does cross signs to suggest a relationship between the working class, the modern structure of the city, and technological and political progress while implying the artist's own commitment to them. In modern fashion, this image conceives the city as a pattern of operative signs, as a heterogeneous field of communication. Traditionally, it appropriates the modern signs from the more strictly functional urban gestalt to construct an allegory and to tell an anecdote. Within this complex construct, Baluschek correlates the social situation with the forces of techno-\n\n8\n\nJohn Czaplicka\n\nlogical and political progress. These forces of modernization were thematized in an urban imagery that had a part in the larger discourse about the city at the turn of the century in Germany.\n\n2. Perspectives on the Forces of Change in a City at Work Kaum will das erste, matte Tageslicht Mit seinem Strahl die Gegend rings erhellen, Da stehn sie schon bereit zu ihrer Pflicht, Der harten Arbeit riistige Gesellen; Es gilt in Reih', geordnet Schicht auf Schicht, Heut' schwere Felsenquadern aufzustellen Am hohen Danim, wo unten auf den Schienen Die Dampfkraft keucht, dem Menschengeist zu dienen. Jakob Audorf6\n\nJacob Audorfs poetic image of dawn in a modern urban environment at the end of the nineteenth century admits two contrary perspectives on the industrial city current in Wilhelmine Germany. Reinforced by the rhyme and rhythm of the verse, the transition from night to day coincides with the beginning of a new shift to imply a temporal consonance between the movements of nature and those of the laborers. First light finds dutiful workers well-ordered and ready to execute their tasks high above a backdrop colored by the \"panting power of steam.\" The workers, though integrated rhythmically into the modern urban pattern, are set off dramatically against a modern and animate technology. Seen together these phenomena offer a syncretic image of a city working, one whose near and far serve to frame an important aporia in the contemporary discourse about the city in turn-ofthe-century Germany. For though the power of advanced technology appears here to serve the spirit of humanity, masses of people are yet pictured engaged in a routine of hard physical labor. The instrument of humanity, modern technology, figures against humanity's own instrumentalization in the urban construct.7 Humans act mechanically8 and the machines appear animate; this configures an image that evaluates those two phenomena most responsible for restructuring the nineteenth-century city. It was this evaluation of new technology and mass labor in an industrial situation that was central to contemporary debates about modernity and progress in Germany.9 In such debates during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, these constitutive elements were sometimes pitted one against the other and sometimes coordinated as\n\nPictures of a City at Work\n\n9\n\ntwo complementary aspects of progress (as in the Berlin cityscape by Baluschek described earlier). Liberal bourgeois praise engendered by pride in the advance of civilization through modern technology was countered by a reproach conditioned by a view of people massed, caught, and debased in the compulsions of an urban-industrial system;10 or, depending on whether reform or revolution was on the agenda, a socialist might have bet either on those volatile masses gathered in the industrial city, seeing them as means to social and political progress, or on the new technologies, viewing them as a means to better the worker's material condition. Suspicious of both the technological and social formulations of progress,11 conservative critics such as Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl and Oswald Spengler would oppose progress by any means, associating it with the decline of traditional cultural and moral values and the eventual debasement of humankind. For these critics the locus of such decline and debasement was the modern industrial city,12 where the effects of the forces of progress were most apparent. In the context of these debates about progress and decline, one reconfigured the image of the city. In painting and graphic art of Berlin in the second half of the nineteenth century such refiguration began to supplant the traditional vedute and the simple urban genre scene. These conventional modes of urban representation composed an image of the city either in grand and beautiful vistas displaying historical and monumental-representative edifices,13 or in quaint domestic interiors and street scenes populated by artisans and street callers.14 One pictorial tradition projected a city in grandiloquent facades and vast public spaces, giving expression to civic pride and projecting the presence of great beauty, wealth, and power as well as a long history. This form of pictorial praise often served to affirm the urban status quo. The other pictorial tradition, the urban genre image, tended to reduce the city to an aggregate of private spaces or city interiors that espoused a myth of eternal return to a preindustrial state, in which the city had offered refuge to the \"community\" of its inhabitants. By the end of the nineteenth century this retrospective image was simply one of nostalgic longing and an implicit protest against modernity. In contrast to these conventions of pictorial praise and nostalgia, the more modern images of the city began to attend to patterns of its current constitution and functioning. This was perhaps most clearly —if partially and tendentiously —expressed with the metaphors of the giant capitalist, the Herculean proletarian, and the steaming locomotive,15 those modern icons of exploitation or social and technological progress found in the political caricatures and illustrations scattered through German magazines and newspapers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The proletarian, the capitalist, and the locomotive embodied the modern forces with a role in\n\n10\n\nJohn Czaplicka\n\nthe city's functioning and in the establishment of a modern urban-industrial system. Formally, that which corresponded to these more symbolic figurations of modern urban workings was the nonfigurative projection of a new urban gestalt. This type of imagery tended toward abstraction as it responded to the larger patterns of the functioning city and dealt less with its individual monumental-representative structures, with anecdotal views of its human population, or even with the particular signs and signals indigenous to the modern, functioning city. One might understand this imagery as one corresponding more closely to a changing conceptualization of the city that is no longer simply an object, no longer merely a collection of buildings and people, but an integral system whose functioning is governed by abstract laws and abstracting forces such as money and commercialization.16 The new and more abstract image of the city shines through the allegorical and topical aspects of Baluschek's cityscape to reveal functional divisions of the urban surface or, in the poem by Audorf, a rhythmic and temporal pattern of work apparently underlies the pictures of men at work and trains passing. And these images already begin to reconfigure the city as a system and to frame questions about the nature of men at work in that system, about its social composition, and about the city's modern reconstitution as a system under the banners of technological and social progress. Through an exacting interpretation of the urban-industrial nocturne, Railways in the North of Berlin (figure 2), by Berlin Secessionist and academy professor Franz Skarbina (1895), one may relate traditional pictorial genres and contemporary artistic styles to propositions concerning the role of social class in the functioning of a modern city. The style of the painting evinces the influence of both the contemporary German Naturalismus17 and an impressionistic tonalism that may be attributed to various international influences. In its eclectic style and its choice of subject, it is an uncertain and, for the artist, peculiar picture, which relates two perspectives of the industrial city: the city near at hand as the milieu of the worker and the city distant and \"landscaped\" by the formative powers of industry and new technology.18 Interpreted with regard to contemporary discussions about the constitution of the modern city, this dichotomy would seem to respond to divergent ideological positions taken toward the processes of modernization in turn-of-the-century Germany and even seems to suggest partial views of the city as experienced by different classes. Somewhere in the industrial north of Berlin on the elevation of a bridge or platform of the Ringbahn,19 a proletarian couple makes its way above an extensive industrial plain of rail lines and passing trains.20 This cityscape, blanketed in a murky monochrome of blue-black tones, is illuminated by artificial lights that cluster in the distance like stars to delineate the horizon. Darkness, vacuity in the homogeneity of color and tones, the vastness of the\n\nPictures of a City at Work\n\n11\n\nFigure 2. Franz Skarbina. Railways in the North of Berlin, 1895. Tempera on paper, 72 x 91 cm. Berlin Museum.\n\nindustrial plain, and the solitude of the foreground couple crossing high above that expanse render the setting sublime.21 In a manner reminiscent of Whistler,22 the painterly effects of artificial light and atmospheric veils of smoke and steam articulate that setting in a way that lends it color and drama, making it into a spectacle. Beyond the sober ironwork railing that abruptly separates near and far, a gasometer and smokestacks —the conventional icons of industry —loom large, pitch black, but barely discernible; before them freight and commuter trains trace their routes in light while emitting smoke and steam that unify the surface of the painting and signify a city technologically advanced and at work. In the glow of artificial illumination and behind the veils of active industry, the physical presence of the city almost dissolves in a guise meant to evoke mood and perhaps to connote \"naturalness.\" This dissolution in the painterly effects, which suggests energy being expended and gives the time of day, transforms the city from a disparate sum of structural details into a moody, atmospheric scene that simulates landscape.23 It was in Wilhelmine Germany that the modern city first became bildwiirdig, worthy of representation; it was viewed as a landscape and seen for the spectacle it\n\n12\n\nJohn Czaplicka\n\npresents.24 And it is in this pictorial guise, a Stimmungsbild25 consistent with a turn-of-the-century aesthetic, that the technologically and industrially modern city is first projected as an object of artistic appreciation and contemplation. In Skarbina's painting, what transgresses the simply appreciative gaze and intrudes on the contemplative point of view are two figures crossing from right to left. They are proletarian types drawn from districts of Berlin that were seldom visited, rarely represented, and only vaguely charted in the illustrated newspapers and magazines or other popular media; for the life in such districts existed only on the margins of the larger public consciousness.26 To those curious about and foreign to this \"other\" Berlin, contemporary guidebooks recommended a tour on the Ringbahn, the commuter railway that girded the inner city.27 For from that elevated train one had a view that allowed the visitor to keep one's distance while taking in the sights. Essentially, Skarbina offers us the same perspective, except that by introducing those who work this landscape he shifts the focus from the distant object, from an aesthetically pleasing and auratic city, to the workaday experience of those whose motions were inscribed into the surface of the city and who were a part of its functioning. The manners and motions of this proletarian couple define the subliminal and evocative cityscape, objectify it in a way that makes it less an indefinite space open to subjective projection. The drably clothed railroad yardman and his well-bundled wife tread their way to or from work. Sullied snow lines their route, adding a seasonal note to a routine dramatized by atmospheric effects of smoke and steam, the conventional pictorial signs of an active industrial city. Trudging bentshouldered down an asphalt path and along an iron railing that runs strictly parallel to the picture plane, the couple ignores the urban panorama and does not see the available spectacle of the cityscape below. In passing across the picture plane they appear very much the urban nomads later decried by Oswald Spengler as the rootless denizens of the big city.28 The movement of these modern urban types is calibrated by the intervals in the railing beside them and channeled between the edge of the walkway and line of the horizon. They are profiled against and contained within an industrial setting that is their place of work. Their execution in broken contours, loose brush strokes, and earth colors blend them into that workscape and make them appear indigenous to it, inseparable from it. Only a sideward glance by the woman suggests any other awareness and separation from the routines of urban and industrial time and place. Her look askance catches the beholder's eye and is reinforced by the orthogonals of the railway marking the cityscape beyond, which, though leading into the distance, almost seem to converge in the working woman's head. Thus the viewer's gaze, though open to the distant cityscape, is at once en-\n\nPictures of a City at Work\n\n13\n\ngaged and refocused on the proximate. From this composition cleaved into near and far, a tension arises between proletarian genre—or naturalism, as it is sometimes called —and the contemporary tendency to aestheticize the city, to dramatize its work, and effectively to propagate its modernity. At the point of intersection between these two disparate perspectives lies humankind at work and the workings of the city. Skarbina's pendant painting of 1901, View of the Seine and Paris at Night (figure 3), shows a well-heeled holiday couple viewing the illumination of Paris and provides a telling contrast to his depiction of proletarian gyrations in the north of Berlin. The couple in the Paris painting lean at ease against a sturdy marble balustrade, looking from a building near the Eiffel Tower on the Quai Branly and toward the Trocadero and the World Exposition of 1900. They engage themselves with things distant and appreciate the spectacle of the Parisian night. They fix their gaze and span their attention in seeing. Thoroughly aware of their surroundings and detached from the city in their position and pose, fascination marks their regard, directed toward an aestheticized and landscaped city.29 There is a cleft of consciousness between this holiday pair and Skarbina's proletarians, one evident in their different bearing, in their affectations. The presence of proletarians following their workaday routine and subsumed instrumentally in the city opposes that disinterested and disengaged appreciation of the nocturnal beauty of the metropolis. Each distinct type of urban experience results from predispositions of the beholders. For that disinvolved and appreciative gaze there are prerequisites. First, there is the factor of time, a question of whether one is or is not subject to the temporal patterns of the functioning city. For an aesthetic perspective presupposes disengagement from the uniform and measured flow of public time in the urban system.30 Second, to gain a perspective from which to fix and observe that environment demands a distancing that cannot be achieved by one engaged instrumentally in its functioning. Disengagement and distancing are prerogatives of the privileged gaze, a gaze contingent largely on social class. Subject to the functioning city, the workers appear part of it and remain indigenous in and subject to it. Theirs is not the gaze that surveys the city out of time and removed, leisurely and disinterestedly partaking of its beauty as if it were a natural and subliminal landscape.31 Referring to such parameters of time and distance, one can simply map out those experiential paradigms proposed by Skarbina's paintings. One paradigm, seen in the relationship of the workers to the city, suggests a practical and realistic viewpoint, which is set against the experience of the beholder whose view of the city is more aesthetic and romantic. Both viewpoints suggest a degree of alienation conditioned by, on one hand, a more purely functional relationship to the city and, on the other, a more purely aesthetic one.\n\nFigure 3. Franz Skarbina. View of the Seine and Paris at Night, 1901. Oil on canvas, 92 x 62.5 cm. Berlin Museum.\n\nIn granting the beholder distance and evoking a mood, Skarbina invites him or her to project subjectively. That distance, which is separation and absence, composes an image perhaps of yearning, and certainly one meant\n\nPictures of a City at Work\n\n15\n\nto cause reverie or stir the imagination. Distant and separated from the viewer, the object of contemplation assumes an aura, the aura of that of which one cannot avail oneself. This auratic city is one of the imagination and for the imagination. For such visible indistinction in the imaging of the city invites not so much reason as the imagination to configure the city in the mind. Such evocative views are called Stimmungsbilder in German; they are images of mood or paintings of disposition. They call forth the subjective disposition of the beholder and activate the imagination. The city pictured in this manner suggests a strategy for subjectively overcoming objective circumstance; it also suggests a comprehension of the modern urban complex in its great expanse, complexity, and heterogeneity through an empathetic seeing. The experience of place —and experience is the key concept here —is more emotional than rational. One might say it is as if ratio had not yet learned to comprehend the city or accept it when it is represented only as mood evoking. The totally subjective premise suggests that the city can in its complexity, heterogeneity, and expanse be reduced to a mood of the beholder. Such reduction is to impermanence. The constancy and concreteness of the object are denied both in the transitory condition of the atmosphere and in the subjective response of the beholder; the city-object is literally dematerialized in its effects. In Stimmungsbilder the identity of the particular place is secondary. There is a loss of topicality and a lack of emphasis on the monumental facades and the relationship of the city to its setting, which had been the focus of urban view painting. Those traditional paintings (vedute) were souvenirs that also indicated and reminded the beholder of the actual hierarchy of power within the city, and they generally transcribed place to lend it a certain significance. In the Stimmungsbild, signification of place is decidedly subordinate to evocation of atmosphere. Pictorial effect takes precedence over material, objective, or historical presence. The historical, bound to particular place and time, is subsumed in the painterly representation of changing seasons, weather, and time of day, so that the history of human accomplishment and picture of human labor and its products is subverted by the immutable cycles of natural history and by the daily transitions in the quality of light and conditions of the atmosphere. The effects of artificial light and of energy, smoke, and steam (i.e., of the city's functioning) are pictured blended into this natural spectacle, or as a simulation of it, so as to appear indistinct in nature. There is a subtle denial of the city as artifice, a making natural of the city's functioning, and a subtle relinquishing of humanity's responsibility for having made this environment. In such projections of the urban spectacle and landscape, the subjective predominates in a way that reminds us of those landscaped vistas the German romantics veiled in fog or rain, or colored in the changing hues of\n\n16\n\nJohn Czaplicka\n\ndawn or dusk. And in their composition these two Skarbina urban views seem to refer particularly to the Sollerbilder of the German romantics, which presented the city or a landscape from an elevated viewpoint, a promontory, balcony, bridge, or tower. Such paintings by Carl Gustav Carus or Caspar David Friedrich32 composed a similar view of near and far without abridging middle ground; they were also paintings of mood, depending on what Carus called Luftschleier\"3 for their effect. Given this, it is not surprising to find Skarbina's contemporary, the architect August Endell, referring exactly to these \"atmospheric veils,\" or Luftschleier, in his book, Die Schonheit der groflen Stadt (1908); he even proposed such pictorial means as a way to redeem the city from ugliness.34 In his book Endell recommends specific times of the day and especially dawn, dusk, or the night for seeing the city. If the day produces a thousand colorful veils, the night does more. If the star-filled sky and the moon hardly ever shine fully in the city, artificial light still compensates in its endless play of hues. Twilight already brings this light into play. One is delighted by the glimmering blue street under the fading rose sky in the chiaroscuro that mutes color as the long rows of greenish gaslights emerge. At first these are hardly visible, they form colored points, and finally with a life of their own they emerge brightly in sinking darkness.35\n\nHe proposed the effects of artificial illumination on the surface of the city not merely as a simulation of natural light, but as an extension of it. Referring to this play of light elsewhere in the text, Endell writes: \"[It is] a picture of the most delicate charm, completely 'unnatural,' but still Nature, and above all beauty.\"36 \"But still Nature\" is the relevant phrase; for Endell sees the big city as Nature, and furthermore as landscape. This nature lies, as he writes, in the power of the artist's imagination to naturalize and to beautify the city by seeing it as one sees nature —the forest, the mountains, and the sea. The solution to the seeming paradox of \"unnatural\" Nature lies then in the seeing, in the willed assumption of the point of view and an empathetic projection of self into the object perceived. This strategy for redeeming the urban-industrial complex for aesthetic appreciation managed to coalesce its disjunct \"fragments of modernity\"37 into a single picture that could serve as an image of praise as well as one of fascination. Considering that until this time the \"city beautiful\" had been largely one of grand and impressive monuments or one situated advantageously in the landscape, Endell's aesthetic of effects, which proposed no hierarchy of subject matter, had the advantage of including all aspects of the city's modernity in the canon of painting. There are many questions to ask about this strategy of aestheticizing and naturalizing the modern urban construct. What did this reconstitution of the modern city in the language of romantic landscape painting mean? Why did\n\nPictures of a City at Work\n\n17\n\nit coincide with a revival of the fortunes of the Grqflburgertum after a longer recession in the 1890s? Was it merely the adaptation of fashionable stylistic elements taken from the vocabularies of impressionist and tonalist painting? Certain intent can be seen simply in the project of making the modern city worthy of depiction and finding a pictorial manner to appraise its modernity. Another reason lies in the attempt to be contemporary in subject as well as style. Still, it seems one is always seeing the city as an \"other\" place in such paintings. There is a will not to be taken up in but to see oneself apart from the city and to hold it distant in the fixed and intent gaze. Although a certain avoidance of the new physical and material structure of the city is indicated, which suggests a discrepancy between style and motif, still in this style —which might be called a new romanticism —the modern city was for the first time consistently represented in German painting. And with this style the dissolution of the urban surface and the kinetic involved in the play of forces across that surface was first vividly suggested.38 There is, of course, the purely painterly aspect affecting this choice of style, in that the homogeneity of tones and color lends unity to the surface of a variegated motif. And the facile employment of color to suggest the new hues of gas and electric lights (preferably on wet pavement) became the urban artist's touchstone for a demonstration of skill in the representation of the modern, artificial environment; critic after critic would, for example, praise Skarbina and his contemporaries for their skills in rendering the hues called forth by artificial illumination.39 Finally, this type of urban imagery provided a vehicle for the expression of the psychological. Its emphasis on sense impressions, emotional states, and radically personal viewpoint subordinated the subject of the city more and more to what one might call an \"urban state of mind.\" Thus in this style the image of the city seemed to become increasingly dependent on the personal urban experience of the artist, a turn of mind that prefigures the expressionist city. There was an opposite side to this more subjective vision of the city that is also evident in Skarbina's painting of the north of Berlin.\n\n3. The Rhythm of Man's Work Skarbina foregrounds the landscaped and naturalized city presented in his Railways (figure 2) with a \"going to work\" that typified the modern metropolis in its separation of place of work from place of habitation. This pictorial referent points toward the rationalized work process geared to mass production, industrial work schedules, and the division of labor that had begun to condition such daily peregrinations of the working population in the nineteenth century. The surface of the modern city was structured more and more to accommodate this process and those ordered motions until the city\n\n18\n\nJohn Czaplicka\n\ntook on the aspect of an urban system.40 And the rhythmic movements of energy, people, and goods within this structured superficies (the so-called tides of the city ) were recognized and \"well described by observers of the urban phenomena such as Skarbina's contemporary Karl Buecher.42 This evident organization of the urban-industrial complex had its pictorial precedent in representations of factory interiors early in the nineteenth century; but only in the mid-1890s did modern patterning in the structure and workings of the city affect the urban imagery of German artists, photographers, and illustrators. Similar patterning of structure and movement is, for instance, evident in a photograph taken by the artist Heinrich Zille, circa 1902 (figure 4).43 Three workers are shown proceeding with a measured stride on the sidewalk along a wooden fence and before a row of tenements. \"On the way to work,\" that everyday urban motion, would even seem the subject of this photograph, for though viewed from a pedestrian perspective and up close, the photograph does not suggest the workers' individuality. On the contrary, with their backs turned, clothed uniformly, and coordinated in their motion they more closely resemble that modern and anonymous genre type, \"the worker\" or \"the proletarian,\" who bore individuality neither in person nor in profession. This modern urban-industrial type, whose image in Berlin derives from certain Volkstypen44 associated with the city, appeared without the attributes of a particular trade, uniformed in simple clothing, and often grouped in masses. His appearance is impersonal and interchangeable. As the working- and lower-class inhabitant of cities, this more generic type succeeded the collections of individual types —of artisans and street vendors45 — who had represented the big city populace in pictorial and literary compendiums during the first half of the nineteenth century. According to political persuasion, this contemporary type was rendered to embody the debilitating circumstance of people in the modern and industrial city (social Darwinism) or, conversely, the prospective vanguard of social progress (socialism and Marxism). Either the agent of change or its victim, this worker was identified as the \"native\" of the city. In reviewing the painting and the photograph one notes that neither Skarbina nor Zille chose to cast the worker in the potential revolutionary role.46 The heroic gesture that other contemporary artists like Steinlen or Meunier lent their workers is absent, as is the potent massing.47 Their naturalistic figures have little relation to the classic proletarian Hercules or banner carriers set against and dominating an industrial-urban skyline in the socialist iconography of progress. Their workers conform to the ebb and flow of the modern industrial city and appear caught at a moment of transience between home and place of work. It is exactly this elemental transience, called rootlessness by some, that would pose an apparent threat\n\nPictures of a City at Work\n\n19\n\nFigure 4. Heinrich Zille. Workers on the Way Home, Charlottenburg, SophieCharlotten-StraBe, ca. 1902. Photograph, 9 x 12 cm. Landesbildstille Berlin.\n\nto the conservative critics of the city; and this transience coupled with the massing of the working classes that would also inspire Marx and Engels to coin the metaphors of the \"giant proletariat\" and \"grand machinery\" to suggest the potential of this unbound social force.48 That metaphor of the\n\n20\n\nJohn Czaplicka\n\nmachine, however, was ambivalent in its connotations, for it suggests both organization and control. Hans Baluschek, George Grosz, Karl Holtz, Hugo Krayn, Franz M. Jansen, Ludwig Meidner, Otto Nagel, Karl Volker, and other artists who worked in Berlin during the period 1890—1920 would variously configure this machinery of the modern city. They described either the disciplined coming and going to work or the uprisings of those masses and the many shades of meaning in between. Hans Baluschek, influenced by literary naturalism and the politics of the Social Democratic Party, would confront the viewer with the working-class types pouring out of factories and mass transportation into the city and out of the picture frame. However, this confrontation would, for the most part, be mitigated by the exhausted faces of the types or even stereotypes composing a working-class crowd. The worn and weary faces and a child here or there were meant to elicit the beholder's sympathy for the condition of the working classes.49 These pitiable proletarian crowds took no strident pose and exhibited little unity. They were unified only in their common channeling and containment by the evident structures of the urban surface. Baluschek did not lend his working-class crowds the motive force of the masses that was so evident in graphic series such as Ka'the Kollwitz's Bauernkrieg (1903-8) or her graphic cycle Ein Weber Aufstand (1893). Baluschek's configuration appeared more conformative than formative in its gestalt. Their conformity was with the functioning city.50 Contrasting with this imagery of the well-disciplined urban masses and their consummate integration into the urban system was the imagery of the unruly and revolutionary masses whose motions through the city were pictured as disruptive of the reigning authority and the urban system itself. At least since Alfred Rethel's presentation of the Revolution of 1848, showing an unruly citizenship behind the barricade confronting an advancing phalanx of soldiers, such images were conventional for representing violent social and political confrontation within the city.51 Order and disorder in the city is projected with regard to social classes, for besides having their distinct ways of experiencing the city, each class would be pictured with a distinct gestalt and manner of moving through the city. Caricatures appearing in satirical magazines such as Simplicissimus and Kladderadatsch provide a rudimentary guide to these forms of movement. \"Der —Die —Das,\" a caricature by Bruno Paul that appeared in 1898 in Simplicissimus (figure 5), draws satirical distinctions between the mob (politically active, but disordered rioting workers), the crowd (observant bystanders of various classes behind a police cordon), and the people (a representative view of the urban oligarchy in Berlin), thereby delimiting the radius of activities allotted to various social groups within Wilhelmine society. In each of the three\n\nFigure 5. Bruno Paul. \"Der—Die — Das\" (subscript: Der Pobel/ Die Menge/ Das Volk).

Posing an alternative view, another caricature by Erich Schilling taken from the 1911 Simplicissimus (figure 6) sets the free play of an equestrian bourgeois in the Tiergarten against the movements of the working masses being funneled through the city by mass transit. The atomistic and individualistic configuration of a leisure class contrasts the mass configuration of the other. The proposed removal of one class from the compulsions of the city, as well as the supposed complete subjection of another to them, is of course illusory. The exaggeration on both counts here points to the artist's recognition of stereotypical class configurations as well as to his negative conceptualization of the city as a place to escape and a locus of control. An otherwise politically engaged artist like Karl Holtz might turn his perception around by showing the proletarians as actors in the city, while designing the bourgeoisie (white-collar workers and businesspeople) as those driven by their engagement in the city (figures 7 and 8). Important in the contrast is the concern of both artists with the inherent compulsions of the urban environment.\n\n24\n\nJohn Czaplicka\n\nFigure 8. Karl Holtz. Berlin Street Scene, ca. 1932. Gouache on cardboard, 29.5 x 49 cm. Markisches Museum, Berlin.\n\nConsidering the expressionists generally within this framework of the urban gestalt and patterning of the working city, one notes their related viewpoint. However, with the exception of painter Ludwig Meidner and a very limited number of paintings by other artists, their city view reverted to the monumental vista (albeit in a new style) and tended to concentrate on certain street types and scenes restricted to the more familiar fashionable outlying districts in the west and the southwest of Berlin, where they lived. Kirchner positioned his consuming and consumed urban types —the gentlemen and ladies of fashion —in the pedestrian traffic on the Biirgersteig, the sidewalk, between the traffic in goods in the shop windows and vehicular traffic on the street. The manner of their presence in this circulation of the city was in attitude and dress more akin to the flaneurs and promenaders of the nineteenth century. Their positioning and fashionable clothing signified their active participation in the flow of people, money, and goods on the urban surface, and their representation in broken contours and through an emphatic repetition of forms (a futurist device) suggestive of speed integrated them into the larger rhythms of the city. Still, and despite all speculations about alienation and the subjective experience of the metropolis, this choice of subject did not vary greatly from the standard impressionist renderings of the nineteenth century, nor can it be considered an innovative configuration of the city. In examining the imagery of urban movement and compulsion in the\n\nPictures of a City at Work\n\n25\n\nwork of George Grosz, one notes how this politically engaged artist retains the conventional figure of the weary worker in profile, and how he configures such workers in dissolute crowds rather than resolute masses, so that although the social circumstance is evident, the political potential is not. In the division of such scenes as \"Early Morning at 5\" in his graphic series Das Gesicht der herrschenden Klasse (The face of the ruling class) of 1921 (figure 9), the social configuration of the city is represented through the bipartite division of the picture into a scene satirizing the debauchery of the bourgeoisie in the early morning hours while the workers march to work.52 The pictorial device of composite scenes is a conventional nineteenth-century device to represent the social divisions within a city, and the pictorially implied confrontation and apparent discrepancy between those classes has a history going back at least to the 1820s in Berlin. What is important in this configuration of the city is the emphasis on the temporal aspect that points out the coincidence of distinct \"occupations\" for each social class at a certain time of day.53 These contrasting schedules of the urban classes are well described in \"The Armies of Work,\" which appeared in the Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung in 1912. Whoever wants to get to know Berlin as an industrial and a worker's city must get up early. As the last night owls are being driven home to the west, the new day begins in the northern, eastern, and southern districts of the city. Day has hardly dawned, when the legions of workers from the outlying districts begin their march to the shops and factories. At Gesundbrunnen, in Wedding, along the Frankfurter Alice . . . the masses make their way to the commuter stations. People, people and more people as far as the eye can see . . . wander to the train stations. At the most crowded stations . . . it is always the same routine. In no time at all the special trains for the workers, which only have a third class, are overfilled. . . . Though the trains follow one another in short intervals, the crowding does not let up until seven in the morning. Then the huge army of whitecollar workers marches out. They only have different faces and are better dressed, but en masse they have the same effect.54\n\nThe military terminology used to describe this regimented mass migration reverberates in Heinrich Kley's drawings, which accompany the article. The point of reference in such description is less the individual worker (although certain aspects of that type of urban resident are described) than a more abstract concept, the idea of traffic. Time, flow, volume, mass, and capacity are the underlying parameters in this discussion of the urban tides. Management of the masses, not individual fates, is the concern. The individual urban denizen, whether blue-collar or white-collar worker, is subsumed into a larger motion of the city. This image of the tact and tempo in urban life in Berlin differs greatly from the imagery of the fashionable urban promenad-\n\nFigure 9.

The visible patterning of the human component that had begun to change in the Berlin scenes by artists such as Lesser Ury and Franz Skarbina came to resemble more what Siegfried Kracauer would call the \"ornament\n\nPictures of a City at Work\n\n27\n\nFigure 10.

Composite Analysis Less anecdotal and more analytic is a composite urban image constructed by Karl Hubbuch from fragments of the cityscape gathered at the historical center of Berlin. His drypoint, By the Old Savings Bank, 1922 (figure 10), can be understood as one in a long series of such representations by other artists, who also sought to represent the modern metropolis Berlin in relation to its\n\n28\n\nJohn Czaplicka\n\nFigure 11.

In a preparatory sketch of the same location (figure 11), Hubbuch presents the view from across the river toward an incomplete city silhouette. Workboats and barges line up before monumental structures to form the center of the city. Read from left to right, the silhouette includes: the savings bank, and, rising behind it, the palace dome; the old Stadtvogtei (the city prison); the cathedral dome; and the oldest church in Berlin, the Nicolaikirche. These buildings and monuments compose a representative historical view of the city seen in relation to the river that flows through its center. In the change from the drawing to the drypoint Hubbuch eliminates both the landscape and the monumental-representative aspect of the scene to concentrate on a few elements, to concentrate meaning in a way that goes beyond Baluschek and Skarbina. To gain some impression of the extreme point of view assumed by Hubbuch in this scenic reduction, one need only compare the same site represented panoramically by the view painter Julius Jacob in 1885 (figure 12). Hubbuch's disowning of the view's scenic potential can be attributed to his keen awareness of the social-political contradictions inherent in the modern urban construct and its workings. His representation of that construct is analytical and revelatory; or, to paraphrase Carl Einstein in reference to\n\nPictures of a City at Work\n\n29\n\nFigure 12. Julius Jacob.

Through a careful selection and recombination of signs easily understood by an informed viewer, Hubbuch is able to define the city through its evident contradictions. This process of evidential deposition characterizes many of the Berlin etchings he executed between 1920 and 1922. Their drawing is finely transcriptive, almost academic, but in the selection and recombination of those finely drawn elements, Hubbuch analyzes and is not given to artistic speculation or stylistic experimentation. His mode is satirical. To understand this pictorial analysis and its satirical bent, however, one must examine and be able to interpret these prints in all their meaningful detail. Yet any attempt at detailed interpretation is necessarily limited "
