        "text": "December 1943 was a low point in the life of Alfred Hitchcock. “I was alone and I didn’t know what to do,” the director recalled. Despite the pleasure he took in scaring his audiences, Hitchcock himself was “a shuddering, shivering human being”, in Peter Ackroyd’s words. During this unhappy period, at the age of 44, he had returned home to England to discuss making propaganda shorts for the Ministry of Information. His wife and collaborator, Alma, on whom he depended, was not with him; he huddled alone in a hotel room, nervously listening to the bombs drop.\n\nIn Hollywood, meanwhile, Hitchcock’s film, Lifeboat, which had taken twice as long as planned to film, was being savaged by the critics. Lifeboat was an anomalous project for the “Master of Suspense”, a largely static film about an ill-assorted group of American survivors who end up unwittingly sharing a boat with the Nazi officer who torpedoed their liner. The script, by John Steinbeck, was botched and needed extensive rewrites. It was an arduous shoot, with many of the cast getting ill from spending so much time drenched by the water tank on which the boat floated. The biggest star, Tallulah Bankhead, caught pneumonia. When it was finally released, at this critical moment of the war, some reviews condemned Hitchcock – unfairly – for not making the Nazi character seem vicious enough. One reviewer gave the movie “10 days to get out of town”.\n\n“Yet,” writes Ackroyd, “Hitchcock did have work at hand.” That is an understatement. As well as creating those propaganda shorts – which ended up being shown in liberated France in 1944 – Hitchcock was in talks with the great Hollywood producer David Selznick about a new “psychological story”. This would end up as Spellbound (1945) starring Gregory Peck as an amnesiac and Ingrid Bergman as the beautiful psychiatrist who unlocks his troubled mind. Although far from being Hitchcock’s finest psychodrama – it lacks the haunting depth of Vertigo – Spellbound was a huge hit and was nominated for seven Oscars. But without drawing breath, Hitchcock was on to his next project, again with Bergman. This was the thriller Notorious, about as perfect a film as he ever made, in which an American agent played by Cary Grant persuades Bergman’s character to marry a Nazi, even though he is really in love with her himself. Notorious is soaringly romantic and impossibly tense, with possibly the best kiss in screen history. Once again, however, Hitchcock did not dwell on his achievement. He moved straight on to The Paradine Case, a courtroom drama. When he didn’t know what to do, what he did was work.\n\nIt is a cliche that biographers make their subjects in their own image. But reading this superb, insightful short life, it is hard to resist comparing Hitchcock’s prodigious appetite for work with Ackroyd’s own. The list of Ackroyd’s works includes substantial lives of Dickens and Eliot, numerous shorter lives and other non-fiction such as London: The Biography. By the same token, Hitchcock directed more than 60 films, and though not all were as good as Rear Window or North by Northwest, even the flops had magic in them.\n\nAckroyd does not seem the most obvious person to write about Hitchcock. His presiding obsessions have been with places (London, Venice, Albion) and writers (Milton, Dickens, Blake, Eliot) rather than film. For film fanatics, Ackroyd’s slim volume will offer no replacement for the more comprehensive treatment by Patrick McGilligan (Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light). Yet Ackroyd’s deft and moving biography proves that there is a fresh story to be told, and that he is the person to do it. Hitchcock grew up in a London that was recognisably still the city of Dickens. The director’s ability to mix “threat with pantomime” was a “cockney vision”, says Ackroyd. His imagination, too, was similar to that of Dickens. “They were both fantasists who insisted upon meticulous detail in the unravelling of their plots; they were both poised between art and commerce, with a keen taste for the making of money.”\n\nHitchcock was born in the final year of the 19th century above his father’s greengrocer’s shop in Leytonstone, but the family moved to a fishmonger’s in Limehouse when Alfred was six or seven. Ackroyd describes Limehouse at that time as a grimy neighbourhood of “small shops and houses standing a few feet back from the pavement, little plots of impoverished humanity”. As a boy, Hitchcock escaped from his surroundings by fantasising about travel. “He collected maps and timetables, tickets and schedules, and all the other paraphernalia of journeying”. He claimed that when he was eight, he had travelled on every single London Omnibus route.\n\nAccording to Ackroyd’s account, perhaps the most important aspect of Hitchcock’s working-class upbringing was that his family was deeply Catholic, which instilled in “Alfie” (he became known as “Hitch” as an adult) a squeamishness about bodies and a “tremulous sense of guilt”. His Catholic education gave him a sense of “mystery and miracle”. What, after all, is “suspense”, but a riff on the Catholic sense of awe at the unknown forces of the universe? Hitchcock’s religious sensibility informed films such as Vertigo, which, to Ackroyd, is “a reverie and a lament, a threnody and a hymn”. The final, chilling line is spoken by a nun: “God have mercy.”\n\nThe young Hitchcock had a “preternatural fear of authority of every kind” and complicated feelings about sex. After the conception of their daughter, Pat, it is thought that his relationship with Alma was celibate. One of his screenwriters, Arthur Laurents, said “he thought everyone was doing something physical and nasty behind every closed door – except himself”. But his Jesuit schooling at St Ignatius College in Stamford Hill also left him with an extraordinary work ethic. From the silent era to talkies, from England to Hollywood, from black and white to glorious Technicolor, from drama to horror, he was always toiling, and it is this aspect of Hitchcock’s personality that Ackroyd brings out most strongly.\n\nWe have been given many previous versions of Hitchcock. For François Truffaut, one of his earliest and most passionate fans, he was an auteur: the consummate artist. For biographer Donald Spoto in The Dark Side of Genius (1983), he was a creepy and deeply troubled man who acted out his inner demons on screen and was abusive towards his leading ladies. Ackroyd, far more convincingly, gives us Hitchcock the industrious craftsman. His work was a solace from his horrors and hang-ups rather than a straightforward depiction of them.\n\nAckroyd does not deny that the director often behaved controllingly towards the succession of untouchable blondes who starred in his films. Yet for most of his career, this dominating behaviour was a function of the work. On the set of Rebecca, for example, Hitchcock decided that Joan Fontaine’s performance as the nameless wife would be more convincing if he could make her think that the rest of the cast disliked her. On North by Northwest, he told Eva Marie Saint off for drinking coffee from a disposable cup. “You are wearing a $3,000 dress, and I don’t want the extras to see you quaffing from a Styrofoam cup.” It was only while shooting The Birds with Tippi Hedren that these personal demands tipped over from the behaviour of a perfectionist to that of a stalker. “I controlled every movement on her face,” he boasted. As well as making her suffer excessive violence from the birds during filming, he started telling her what she should wear, and even eat, in her spare time.\n\nBut in Ackroyd’s telling, it was work and not blondes that dominated Hitchcock’s life. “I finished To Catch a Thief one afternoon at 5.30, and by 7.30 [The Trouble with] Harry was under way,” he boasted. The advantage of this relentless schedule was that there was little time for introspection. When actors asked him what their character’s “motivation” should be, he liked to reply “your salary”. The downside was that he was always so much in the thick of his work – cutting, revising – that he could not appreciate what he had achieved. After shooting Psycho, he talked with Bernard Herrmann, who composed the score, including its jabbing music for the shower scene. Herrmann recalled him pacing up and down, saying how bad it was and that he would have to “cut it down for his television show. He was crazy. He didn’t know what he had.”\n\nWhen Psycho was released in the summer of 1960 to unprecedented success, making Hitchcock the richest film director in the world, he was so shocked that his incessant work urge was momentarily put on hold. “What will you do for an encore?” asked his agent, by telegram. “Hitchcock did not know,” writes Ackroyd.\n\nAnd then he made The Birds."
