        "text": "Goodbye, Farewell and Amen, Part Three\n\nEskişehir, Turkey, Wednesday 23 December 2021\n\nI have friends and family who occasionally ask me:\n\nWhere is the novel we know you can write?\n\nI stutter and stammer my response, for the answer is never as easy to express as the question, so let me begin to explain myself by first referring to other glorious writers who have come before me as I emerge blinking and blind into the light of day.\n\n“There are three rules for writing the novel.\n\nUnfortunately, no one knows what they are.”\n\n(W. Somerset Maugham)\n\nThis is true.\n\nFor it is not so much as the way a writer writes, for I think I can on occasion string words together as crudely as a garland of popcorn on a Yuletide tree.\n\n“What’s writing really about?\n\nIt’s about trying to take fuller possession of your life.”\n\n(Ted Hughes)\n\nHow I write is significant, certainly, but the why I write matters more.\n\n“You are miming the real thing until one day the chain draws unexpectedly tight and you have dipped into the waters that will continue to entice you back.\n\nYou have broken the skin on the pool of yourself.”\n\n(Seamus Heaney)\n\nWriting, for me, is an intimate act, privately created for public perusal.\n\nIt is closely intertwined with notions of perception, personality, morality and possibility.\n\nWriting is akin to serendipity.\n\nI never know what wonderful and/or terrible thing I will accidentally discover about myself and the humanity that binds me to others.\n\nWriting is a choice to examine the choices I have made in my life.\n\nAnd this revelation leaves me as exposed as a stripper inside a congregation of the righteous.\n\nBut this is an exposure far more intimate than that of an overweight scarred aging man’s body, but rather it is the cross-sectional microscopic examination of the contents of my heart, my mind, my soul.\n\n“There are strange tales told beneath the Arctic sun by the men who moil for gold,\n\nThe Arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold,\n\nThe Northern Lights have seen queer sights but the strangest they ever did see….“\n\n(Robert W. Service)\n\n….was the night in the room of shadows of gloom when I revealed the real me.\n\nThe winds of opinion can be as cold as a “three dog night” in Tuktoyaktuk.\n\nAnd so an exposed psyche feels hesitant at times.\n\nSentences sentence me as the testimony of the sum and signature of my person, the deepest reflection of an identity undefined and undefinable crawling haltingly from the cocoon of my consciousness, is read against me.\n\nEach word is made of Roman characters chiselled from the frozen fortress that protects me from myself.\n\nMy mind is relentless with endless discussion, examination, testing, moulding and learning.\n\nLayers of tone and texture make a man and could, should make a solid story.\n\nWhat’s going to happen?\n\nTo whom?\n\nWhen?\n\nWhere?\n\nWhy?\n\nHow?\n\nWhat’s the story?\n\nMy novel is much like my life.\n\nMuch, God willing, left to be written.\n\nLandschlacht, Switzerland, Sunday 28 February 2021\n\nReading and writing are two sides of the same coin, but it is not only what you read that is important, it is how you read as well.\n\nAs to what I read, this is a combination of serendipity for new literature (at least new for me) and a nostalgic return to old previously read works.\n\nIt has been suggested that when starting to read a novel for the first time or re-reading an old favourite that the reading writer should try to view it as an editor would, looking “through” the text in X-ray fashion.\n\nReading books in this way allows you to examine a narrative closely, locating and identifying dee p structure and embedded themes.\n\nHow does the writer bring their themes to life?\n\nWhat most appealed to you about the story?\n\nHow was that dramatized in the narrative?\n\nIt has been suggested that we should try to begin reading not just for pleasure, but also for ideas.\n\nReading in this way can be a great source of inspiration.\n\nYou should not hesitate to use all the stimulation and motivation to kickstart your own work.\n\n“A work is eternal, not because it imposes a single meaning on different men, but because it suggests different meanings to a single man.”\n\n(Roland Barthes)\n\nIt is good to read as widely as possible – especially outside your race, class and gender.\n\nThe reading of other writers and noting how they write is one of the least expensive and gentlest schools of learning of all.\n\nThat exploration of extensive reading is done through the search of each calendar date and the subsequent revelation of authors who have lived, published or died on that date.\n\nWhich, on this day of days, has led me to Stephen Spender…..\n\nHistory is the ship carrying living memories to the future.\n\n(Stephen Spender)\n\nStephen Spender was a member of the generation of British poets who came to prominence in the 1930s, a group—sometimes referred to as the Oxford Poets — that included W.H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, C. Day Lewis, and Louis MacNeice.\n\nIn an essay on Spender’s work in Chicago Tribune Book World, Gerald Nicosia wrote:\n\n“While preserving a reverence for traditional values and a high standard of craftsmanship, these poets turned away from the esotericism of T.S. Eliot, insisting that the writer stay in touch with the urgent political issues of the day and that he speak in a voice whose clarity can be understood by all.”\n\nSpender’s numerous books of poetry include:\n\nDolphins (1994)\n\nCollected Poems, 1928 – 1985\n\nThe Generous Days (1971)\n\nPoems of Dedication (1946)\n\nThe Still Centre (1939)\n\nStephen Spender was born on 28 February 1909 in Kensington, London, to journalist Harold Spender and Violet Hilda Schuster, a painter and poet, of German Jewish heritage.\n\nWhen a child, my dreams rode on your wishes,\n\nI was your son, high on your horse,\n\nMy mind a top whipped by the lashes\n\nOf your rhetoric, windy of course.\n\nOn his father in “The Public Son of a Public Man“, as quoted in Time magazine, 20 January 1986\n\nMy Parents\n\nMy parents kept me from children who were rough\n\nWho threw words like stones and wore torn clothes\n\nTheir thighs showed through rags they ran in the street\n\nAnd climbed cliffs and stripped by the country streams.\n\nI feared more than tigers their muscles like iron\n\nTheir jerking hands and their knees tight on my arms\n\nI feared the salt coarse pointing of those boys\n\nWho copied my lisp behind me on the road.\n\nThey were lithe they sprang out behind hedges\n\nLike dogs to bark at my world. They threw mud\n\nWhile I looked the other way, pretending to smile.\n\nI longed to forgive them but they never smiled.\n\nHe went first to Hall School in Hampstead and then at 13 to Gresham’s School, Holt, and later Charlecote School in Worthing, but he was unhappy there.\n\nAn Elementary School Classroom in a Slum\n\nFar far from gusty waves these children’s faces.\n\nLike rootless weeds, the hair torn round their pallor:\n\nThe tall girl with her weighed-down head. The paper-\n\nseeming boy, with rat’s eyes. The stunted, unlucky heir\n\nOf twisted bones, reciting a father’s gnarled disease,\n\nHis lesson, from his desk. At back of the dim class\n\nOne unnoted, sweet and young. His eyes live in a dream\n\nOf squirrel’s game, in tree room, other than this.\n\nOn sour cream walls, donations. Shakespeare’s head,\n\nCloudless at dawn, civilized dome riding all cities.\n\nBelled, flowery, Tyrolese valley. Open-handed map\n\nAwarding the world its world. And yet, for these\n\nChildren, these windows, not this map, their world,\n\nWhere all their future’s painted with a fog,\n\nA narrow street sealed in with a lead sky\n\nFar far from rivers, capes, and stars of words.\n\nSurely, Shakespeare is wicked, the map a bad example.\n\nWith ships and sun and love tempting them to steal —\n\nFor lives that slyly turn in their cramped holes\n\nFrom fog to endless night? On their slag heap, these children\n\nWear skins peeped through by bones and spectacles of steel\n\nWith mended glass, like bottle bits on stones.\n\nAll of their time and space are foggy slum.\n\nSo blot their maps with slums as big as doom.\n\nUnless, governor, inspector, visitor,\n\nThis map becomes their window and these windows\n\nThat shut upon their lives like catacombs,\n\nBreak O break open till they break the town\n\nAnd show the children to green fields, and make their world\n\nRun azure on gold sands, and let their tongues\n\nRun naked into books the white and green leaves open\n\nHistory theirs whose language is the sun.\n\nOn the face of it, Stephen’s childhood in Hampstead and Norfolk couldn’t have been more privileged.\n\nHis mother, Violet, came from a wealthy Anglo-German Jewish family called Schuster.\n\nHis father, Harold, was a tireless campaigning journalist whose friends numbered Henry James and Lloyd George.\n\n(Visiting the latter in Downing Street, Harold took so long about it that young Stephen, waiting in a taxi outside, was forced to relieve himself out of the back window).\n\nDenied contact with poorer children, in case they were carrying diseases, the Spender children were brought up largely by servants – though once a day, tidied up, they would be brought to Violet and allowed to play with her jewel-box.\n\nThe three younger children – Stephen, Humphrey and Christine – lived in the shadow of the oldest, Michael, whose infant beauty prompted a cringe-making poem from Violet (“rosy cheeks, eyes blue and tender! / Neighbours, have you such a one? / All the neighbours answer, ‘None!’“).\n\nStephen’s allotted family role was that of namby-pamby.\n\nThings got worse when he went to boarding school.\n\nAs well as being flogged for stupidity and persecuted for his Hunnish origins, he was flung down the kipper hole at the back of the school dining-room, along with meal scraps intended for pigs.\n\nHis piano teacher consolingly prophesied that he’d be happy once an adult.\n\nIn the shorter term he was rescued by his mother, who died when he was 12, after which he was allowed home again as a day boy.\n\nThe death left him guiltily unmoved and “longing to be stricken again in order to prove that next time I would be really tragic“.\n\nOn the death of his mother, he was transferred to University College School (Hampstead), which he later described as “that gentlest of schools“.\n\nTeen age brought further embarrassments.\n\nThe widowed Harold was possessive of his charges and studiously monitored their bowel movements to ensure they “did their little duty“.\n\nThe children were also enlisted as canvassers when Harold stood (and lost) as a Liberal MP, which meant being dispatched round the streets of Bath in a cart pulled by a donkey with “VOTE FOR DADDY” round its neck.\n\nFor the hyper-sensitive Stephen, who felt “skewered on the gaze of everyone” even when unobtrusively walking down the street, nothing could have been more humiliating.\n\n“I had the most tormented adolescence anyone has ever had in the whole of history,” he later wrote.\n\nLuckily, Harold outlived Violet by less than five years, suffering a heart attack after an operation on his spleen, after which Stephen had “a very happy last year” at school.\n\nSpender left for Nantes and Lausanne and then went up to University College, Oxford.\n\n(Much later, in 1973, he was made an Honorary Fellow).\n\nAcademically, he was still a laggard.\n\nIn fact he failed every exam he took apart from his driving test.\n\n(And terrified passengers doubted the wisdom of that result).\n\nBut poetically and politically he had found his niche, and won a place at Oxford, where, after much angling for an introduction, he met Auden, already a legend at 21.\n\nIn the many different accounts Spender gave of that meeting, the word “clinical” is unvarying, pinpointing what the master has and what his acolyte lacks.\n\nAuden wields a surgeon’s knife.\n\nSpender is woozier.\n\nPerhaps his closest friend and the man who had the biggest influence on him was W. H. Auden, who introduced him to Christopher Isherwood.\n\nSpender handprinted the earliest version of Auden’s Poems.\n\n“But do you really think I’m any good?” a nervous Stephen Spender asked WH Auden, some six weeks after they’d met.\n\n“Of course,” Auden said. “Because you are so infinitely capable of being humiliated.”\n\nHumiliation was Spender’s lifetime companion.\n\nFew poets have been more savagely reviewed.\n\nAnd none has nurtured a greater sense of inadequacy.\n\nThis is the man who, having dismissed John Lehmann as a potential lover because he was a “failed version of myself“, adds: “but I also regarded myself as a failed version of myself.”\n\nWith Spender, self-deprecation reaches comic extremes of self-abasement.\n\nHe left Oxford without taking a degree and in 1929 moved to Hamburg.\n\nIsherwood invited him to Berlin.\n\nEvery six months, Spender went back to England.\n\nBy now Spender was a strikingly handsome young man.\n\nIn the German gay-arcadia of 1930, every Hans, Helmut and Harry was a willing bedfellow.\n\nBut it was Tony Hyndman, a sandy-haired Welsh ex-soldier, who consumed Spender’s emotional life for several years.\n\nFew friends saw the point of Tony.\n\nFeckless, drunk and pilfering, he could also be wildly possessive, and in his later career as a stage manager took revenge on his former lover Michael Redgrave by sprinkling tacks on a couch on to which the actor was obliged to throw himself.\n\nIf Spender escaped more lightly, that’s because he remained oddly loyal to Tony.\n\nThe embarrassing struggle to extricate him from Spain, where he was fighting for the Republicans, was the extent of Spender’s Spanish Civil War – and the beginning of his disillusion with Communism.\n\nSpender was acquainted with fellow Auden Group members:\n\nLouis MacNeice\n\nEdward Upward\n\nCecil Day-Lewis\n\nHe was friendly with David Jones.\n\nHe later came to know:\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats\n\nAllen Ginsberg\n\nTed Hughes\n\nJoseph Brodsky\n\nIsaiah Berlin\n\nMary McCarthy\n\nRoy Campbell\n\nRaymond Chandler\n\nDylan Thomas\n\nJean-Paul Sartre\n\nColin Wilson\n\nAleister Crowley\n\nF. T. Prince\n\nT. S. Eliot\n\nVirginia Woolf\n\nParis Review interview, May 1978:\n\nI knew Dylan from very early on.\n\nIn fact, I was the first literary person he met in London.\n\nEdith Sitwell made the absurd claim that she’d discovered Dylan Thomas, which is rubbish.\n\nAll she did was write a favorable review of his first book.\n\nThere was a Sunday newspaper called Reynolds News at that time, and it had a poetry column which was edited by a man called Victor Neuberg.\n\nHe would publish poems sent in by readers.\n\nI always read this column, being very sympathetic with the idea of ordinary people writing poetry.\n\nAnd then in one issue I saw a poem which I thought was absolutely marvelous —\n\nIt was about a train going through a valley.\n\nI was very moved by this poem, so I wrote to the writer in care of the column, and the writer wrote back.\n\nIt was Dylan Thomas, and in his letter he said first of all that he admired my work, something that he never said again.\n\nThen he said he wanted to come up to London and that he wanted to make money —\n\nHe was always rather obsessed by money.\n\nSo I invited him to London, and may have sent him his fare.\n\nI felt nervous about meeting him alone, which is what I should have done, so I invited my good friend William Plomer to have lunch with us.\n\nWe took him to a restaurant in Soho.\n\nHe was very pale and intense and nervous, and Plomer and I talked a lot of London gossip to prevent the meal from going in complete silence.\n\nI think he probably stayed in London —\n\nHe was a friend of Pamela Hansford Johnson, who became Lady Snow.\n\nThen, right at the end of his life, Dylan wrote me a letter saying he’d never forgotten that I was the first poet of my generation who met him.\n\nHe was thanking me for some review I’d written —\n\nThis was the most appreciative review he’d had in his life, I think he said, something like that.\n\nMind you, he probably wrote a dozen letters like that to people every day.\n\nAnd he certainly said extremely mean things behind my back, of that I’m quite sure.\n\nI don’t hold that against him at all —\n\nIt was just his style.\n\nWe all enjoy doing things like that.\n\nAfter those very early days I didn’t see Dylan often.\n\nOne reason is that I never get on well with alcoholics.\n\nAlso he liked to surround himself with a kind of court that moved from pub to pub.\n\nAnd Dylan was expected to pay for everyone, which he always did, and he was expected to be “Dylan”.\n\nOf course when I was at Horizon with Cyril Connolly, Dylan was always coming in, usually to borrow money.\n\nRichard Burton was funny telling me about Dylan.\n\nHe was a young actor and absolutely without money.\n\nHe would be playing somewhere and Dylan would turn up to borrow a pound.\n\nWhen he left, Burton would always hear a taxi carrying the pauper away.\n\nSpender began work on a novel in 1929, which was not published until 1988, under the title The Temple.\n\nThe novel is about a young man who travels to Germany and finds a culture at once more open than England’s, particularly about relationships between men, and shows frightening harbingers of Nazism that are confusingly related to the very openness the man admires.\n\nSpender wrote in his 1988 introduction:\n\nIn the late Twenties young English writers were more concerned with censorship than with politics…. 1929 was the last year of that strange Indian Summer—the Weimar Republic.\n\nFor many of my friends and for myself, Germany seemed a paradise where there was no censorship and young Germans enjoyed extraordinary freedom in their lives.\n\nThe Temple is a semi-autobiographical novel written by Stephen Spender, sometimes labelled a Bildungsroman because of its explorations of youth and first love.\n\nIt was written after Spender spent his summer vacation in Germany in 1929 and recounts his experiences there.\n\nDuring the holiday in 1929 on which The Temple is based, Spender formed friendships with Herbert List (photographer) and Ernst Robert Curtius (German critic), the latter of which introduced him to and cultivated his passion for Rilke, Hölderlin, Schiller and Goethe.\n\nSpender had a particularly significant relationship with German culture which he found heavily conflicted with his Jewish roots.\n\nHis taste for German society sets him apart from some of his contemporaries.\n\nHowever, even after contemplating suicide if the Nazis were to invade England due to his abhorrence of their regime, he still maintained a love of Germany, returning to it after the war and writing a book about its ruins.\n\nIt was not completed until the early 1930s (after Spender had failed his finals at Oxford University in 1930 and moved to Hamburg).\n\nBecause of its frank depictions of homosexuality, it was not published in the UK until 1988.\n\n(Does a person’s sexual orientation have anyone to do with creativity?\n\nI don’t believe so.\n\nFrankly, what an author’s private life is (or isn’t) should not affect my ability to enjoy their public creations.)\n\nThe Temple begins in Oxford, where Paul Schoner meets Simon Wilmot and William Bradshaw, caricatures of the young W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood respectively.\n\nThey encourage him to visit Germany, hinting that Paul might prefer Germany to Britain because of Germany’s liberal attitudes towards sex and the body.\n\nDuring this section, Paul is introduced to Ernst Stockmann, a fan of his poetry who later invites him to visit his family home in Hamburg.\n\nPaul visits Ernst Stockmann, meeting his wealthy mother and friends, Joachim Lenz and Willy Lassel.\n\nDuring his time at the Stockmann household, Paul experiences the liberality of German youth culture first-hand, attending a party at which he drinks too much and meets Irmi, his later love affair.\n\nPaul, Ernst, Joachim and Willy also visit Hamburg’s notorious quarter Sankt Pauli.\n\nIn Sankt Pauli, at a bar named The Three Stars, Paul meets some young male prostitutes who claim to be destitute.\n\nIt is on this evening, while he is drunk, that Paul agrees to go on holiday to the Baltic with Ernst despite being uncomfortable in Ernst’s company.\n\nWhen Paul and Ernst arrive at the hotel by the Baltic where they will be staying, Paul is distressed to find that Ernst has booked them into a shared room.\n\nPaul feels suffocated by Ernst’s clear affection for him and tries to deter Ernst by telling him that he is not interested.\n\nAfterward, Paul ponders Stephen Wilmot’s quasi-Freudian premise that it is kindest to offer love in return to those who love you, especially if you do not find them attractive.\n\nAs a result, when Ernst comes on to Paul in the hotel room, Paul accepts his attention and they have an uncomfortable sexual encounter.\n\nIn the morning, Paul is keen to escape the hotel room, and runs down to a beach, where he meets Irmi again.\n\nThey have a more satisfying sexual experience on the beach.\n\nIn the next chapter, Paul goes on a trip with Joachim Lenz to the Rhine.\n\nOn this trip, Joachim makes it clear that he intends to fall in love, but there is little indication that he and Paul could be lovers.\n\nNevertheless, Paul is distressed when Joachim books him an adjacent hotel room so that he can stay with a young man named Heinrich who he had met on the beach.\n\nIn Part Two, “Towards the Dark“, Paul returns to Germany in the winter of 1932.\n\nSpender admits in his introduction to the 1988 edition that both parts had taken place in 1929 in reality, but that he moved this part forward to winter 1932 to increase the sense of foreboding (as Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany later that winter).\n\nIn this section, Paul visits several of his friends again, most notably Willy Lassel, who is now engaged to a Nazi woman, and Joachim Lenz, whose relationship with Heinrich is struggling.\n\nHeinrich has made friends with Erich, a fascist man.\n\nPaul meets him and is disgusted and disturbed by his ideology.\n\nSoon after, Paul visits Joachim again and finds him with a cut on his face, staying in a trashed flat.\n\nJoachim tells Paul how one of Heinrich’s Nazi friends had threatened him and destroyed his possessions after Joachim defiled a Nazi party uniform belonging to Heinrich.\n\nThis discussion about their former acquaintances is the end of the novel.\n\nSpender was discovered by T. S. Eliot, an editor at Faber & Faber, in 1933.\n\nHis early poetry, notably Poems (1933), was often inspired by social protest.\n\nLiving in Vienna, he further expressed his convictions in Forward from Liberalism, in Vienna (1934), a long poem in praise of the 1934 uprising of Austrian socialists, and in Trial of a Judge (1938), an antifascist drama in verse.\n\nThe 1930s were marked by turbulent events that would shape the course of history: the worldwide economic depression, the Spanish Civil War, and the beginnings of World War II.\n\nSeeing the established world crumbling around them, the writers of the period sought to create a new reality to replace the old, which, in their minds, had become obsolete.\n\nFor a time, Spender, like many young intellectuals of the era, was a member of the Communist Party.\n\nSpender believed that Communism offered the only workable analysis and solution of complex world problems, that it was sure eventually to win, and that for significance and relevance the artist must somehow link his art to the Communist diagnosis.\n\nSpender’s poem, “The Funeral” (included in Collected Poems: 1928 – 1953, published in 1955, but omitted from the 1985 revision of the same work), has been described as “a Communist elegy”.\n\nAuden’s Funeral\n\nOne among friends who stood above your grave\n\nI cast a clod of earth from those heaped there\n\nDown on the great brass-handled coffin lid.\n\nIt rattled on the oak like a door knocker\n\nAnd at that sound I saw your face beneath\n\nWedged in an oblong shadow under ground.\n\nFlesh creased, eyes shut, jaw jutting\n\nAnd on the mouth a grin: triumph of one\n\nWho has escaped from life-long colleagues roaring\n\nFor him to join their throng. He’s still half with us\n\nConniving slyly, yet he knows he’s gone\n\nInto that cellar where they’ll never find him,\n\nHappy to be alone, his last work done,\n\nWord freed from world, into a different wood.\n\nBut we, with feet on grass, feeling the wind\n\nWhip blood up in our cheeks, walk back along\n\nThe hillside road we earlier climbed today\n\nFollowing the hearse and tinkling village band.\n\nThe white October sun circles Kirchstetten\n\nWith colours of chrysanthemums in gardens,\n\nAnd bronze and golden under wiry boughs,\n\nA few last apples gleam like jewels.\n\nBack in the village inn, we sit on benches\n\nFor the last toast to you, the honoured ghost\n\nWhose absence now becomes incarnate in us.\n\nTasting the meats, we imitate your voice\n\nSpeaking in flat benign objective tones\n\nThe night before you died. In the packed hall\n\nYou are your words. Your listeners see\n\nWritten on your face the poems they hear\n\nLike letters carved in a tree’s bark\n\nThe sight and sound of solitudes endured.\n\nAnd looking down on them, you see\n\nYour image echoed in their eyes\n\nEnchanted by your language to be theirs.\n\nAnd then, your last word said, halloing hands\n\nHold up above their heads your farewell bow.\n\nThen many stomp the platform, entreating\n\nEach for his horde, your still warm signing hand.\n\nBut you have hidden away in your hotel\n\nAnd locked the door and lain down on the bed\n\nAnd fallen from their praise, dead on the floor.\n\n(Ghost of a ghost, of you when young, you waken\n\nIn me my ghost when young, us both at Oxford.\n\nYou, the tow-haired undergraduate\n\nWith jaunty liftings of the head.\n\nAngular forward stride, cross-questioning glance,\n\nA Buster Keaton-faced pale gravitas.\n\nSaying aloud your poems whose letters bit\n\nInk-deep into my fingers when I set\n\nThem up upon my five-pound printing press:\n\n‘An evening like a coloured photograph\n\nA music stultified across the water\n\nThe heel upon the finishing blade of grass.’)\n\nBack to your room still growing memories –\n\nHandwriting, bottles half-drunk, and us – drunk –\n\nChester, in prayers, still prayed for your ‘dear C.’,\n\nHunched as Rigoletto, spluttering\n\nEcstatic sobs, already slanted\n\nDown towards you, his ten-months-hence\n\nGrave in Athens – remembers\n\nOpera, your camped-on heaven, odourless\n\nResurrection of your bodies singing\n\nPassionate duets whose chords resolve\n\nYour rows in harmonies. Remembers\n\nSome tragi-jesting wish of yours and puts\n\n‘Siegfried’s Funeral March’ on the machine.\n\nWagner who drives out every thought but tears –\n\nDown-crashing drums and cymbals cataclysmic\n\nEnd-of-world brass exalt on drunken waves\n\nThe poet’s corpse borne on a bier beyond\n\nThe foundering finalities, his world,\n\nTo that Valhalla where the imaginings\n\nOf the dead makers are their lives.\n\nThe dreamer sleeps forever with the dreamed.\n\nIt has been observed that much of Spender’s other works from the same early period—including his play, Trial of a Judge: A Tragedy in Five Acts (1938), his poems in Vienna (1934), and his essays in The Destructive Element: A Study of Modern Writers and Beliefs (1935) and Forward from Liberalism (1935)—address Communism.\n\nIn Poets of the Thirties, D.E.S. Maxwell commented:\n\n“The imaginative writing of the thirties created an unusual milieu of urban squalor and political intrigue.\n\nThis kind of statement — a suggestion of decay producing violence and leading to change — as much as any absolute and unanimous political partisanship gave this poetry its Marxist reputation.\n\nCommunism and ‘the Communist’ (a poster-type stock figure) were frequently invoked.”\n\nThe attitudes Spender developed in the 1930s continued to influence him throughout his life.\n\nAs Peter Stansky pointed out in the New Republic:\n\n“The 1930s were a shaping time for Spender, casting a long shadow over all that came after.\n\nIt would seem that the rest of his life, even more than he may realize, has been a matter of coming to terms with the 1930s, and the conflicting claims of literature and politics as he knew them in that decade of achievement, fame and disillusion.”\n\nFrom Stephen Spender’s The Destructive Element (1935):\n\nI have taken Henry James as a great writer who developed an inner world of his own through his art.\n\nI have also tried to show that his attitude to our civilization forced him to that development.\n\nThe process had two stages:\n\nThe first was his conviction that European society – and particularly English society – was decadent, combined with his own despair of fulfilling any creative or critical function in civilization as a whole.\n\nSecondly, he discovered, in the strength of his own individuality, immense resources of respect for the past and for civilization.\n\nHe fulfilled his capacity to live and watch and judge by his own standards, to the utmost.\n\nHis characters have the virtues of people who are living into the past: an extreme sensibility, consideration for and curiosity about each other’s conduct, an aestheticism of behaviour.\n\nIn some ways their lives are a pastiche, but this pastiche is an elaboration of traditional moral values.\n\nThe life that James is, on the surface, describing, may be false.\n\nThe life that he is all the time inventing is true.\n\nJames, Joyce, Yeats, Ezra Pound and Eliot have all fortified their works by creating some legend or by consciously going back into a tradition that seemed and seems to be dying.\n\nThey are all conscious of the present as chaotic (though they are not all without their remedies) and of the past as an altogether more solid ground.\n\n“In the destructive element immerse.\n\nThat is the way.”\n\n(Joseph Conrad)\n\n“Things fall apart. The centre cannot hold.\n\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world.\n\nThe blood dammed tide is loosed and everywhere.\n\nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned.”\n\n(Yeats)\n\nParis Review interview, May 1978:\n\nI met Yeats, I think probably in 1935 or 1936, at Lady Ottoline Morrell’s.\n\nOttoline asked me to tea alone with Yeats.\n\nHe was very blind and I don’t know whether he was deaf, but he was very sort of remote, he seemed tremendously old.\n\nHe was only about the age I am now, but he seemed tremendously old and remote.\n\nHe looked at me and then he said:\n\n“Young man, what do you think of the Sayers?”\n\nI hadn’t the faintest idea what he was talking about — I thought perhaps he meant Dorothy Sayers’s crime stories or something — I became flustered.\n\nWhat he meant was a group of young ladies who chanted poems in chorus.\n\nOttoline got very alarmed and rushed out of the room and telephoned to Virginia Woolf, who was just around the corner, and asked her to come save the situation.\n\nVirginia arrived in about ten minutes’ time, tremendously amused, and Yeats was very pleased to meet her because he’d just been reading The Waves.\n\nHe also read quite a lot of science — I think he read Eddington and Rutherford and all those kinds of things — and so he told her that The Waves was a marvelous novel, that it was entirely up to date in scientific theory because light moved in waves, and time, and so on.\n\nOf course Virginia, who hadn’t thought of all this, was terribly pleased and flattered.\n\nAnd then I remember he started telling her a story in which he said:\n\n“And as I went down the stairs there was a marble statue of a baby and it started talking in Greek to me.”—\n\nThat sort of thing.\n\nVirginia adored it all, of course.\n\nOttoline had what she called her Thursday parties, at which you met a lot of writers.\n\nYeats was often there.\n\nHe loosened up a great deal if he could tell malicious stories, and so he talked about George Moore.\n\nYeats particularly disliked George Moore because of what he wrote in his book Hail and Farewell, which is in three volumes, and which describes Yeats in a rather absurd way.\n\nMoore thought Yeats looked very much like a black crow or a rook as he walked by the lake on Lady Gregory’s estate at Coole.\n\nHe also told how Yeats would spend the whole morning writing five lines of poetry and then he’d be sent up strawberries and cream by Lady Gregory, and so Yeats would have to get his own back on George Moore.\n\nAnother thing that amused Yeats very much for some reason was Robert Graves and the whole saga of his life with Laura Riding.\n\nHe told how Laura Riding threw herself out of a window without breaking her spine, or breaking it but being cured very rapidly.\n\nAll that pleased Yeats tremendously.\n\nI remember his telling the story of his trip to Rapallo to show the manuscript of The Tower to Ezra Pound.\n\nHe stayed at the hotel and then went around and left the manuscript in a packet for Pound, accompanied by a letter saying:\n\nI am an old man, this may be the last poetry I’ll ever write, it is very different from my other work?—\n\nAll that kind of thing — and:\n\nWhat do you think of it?\n\nNext day he received a postcard from Ezra Pound with one word on it putrid.\n\nYeats was rather amused by that.\n\nApparently Pound had a tremendous collection of cats, and Yeats used to say that Pound couldn’t possibly be a nasty man because he fed all the cats of Rapallo.\n\nI once asked him how he came to be a modern poet, and he told me that it took him 30 years to modernize his style.\n\nHe said he didn’t really like the modern poetry of Eliot and Pound.\n\nHe thought it was static, that it didn’t have any movement, and for him poetry had always to have the romantic movement.\n\nHe said:\n\n“For me poetry always means:\n\n‘Yet we’ll go no more a-roving / By the light of the moon.’”\n\nSo the problem was how to keep the movement of the Byron lines but at the same time enlarge it so that it could include the kind of material that he was interested in, which was to do with everyday life —politics, quarrels between people, sexual love, and not just the frustrated love he had with Maud Gonne.\n\nThe idea for a book on James gradually resolved itself, then, in my mind, into that of a book about modern writers and beliefs or unbeliefs.\n\nThe difficulty of a book about contemporaries is that one is dealing in a literature of few accepted values.\n\nAt best, one can offer opinions or one can try to prove that one living writer is, for certain reasons, better than another.\n\nAt worst, such criticism degenerates into a kind of bookmaking or stockbroking.\n\nA living writer does not diminish in accordance with rules laid down by donnish minds.\n\nImpertinent criticism means that the critic is projecting on to writing some fantasy of his own as to how poems should be written.\n\nD.H. Lawrence is a kind of traveller to uncharted lands.\n\nAs a psychologist, in his poems, and in Fantasia of the Unknown, he is unique and has no follower.\n\nAll these writers seem to me faced by the destructive element, the experience of an all-pervading present which is a world without belief.\n\nOn the one hand, there are the writers who search for some unifying belief in the past or in some personal legend.\n\nOn the other, those who look forward to a world of new beliefs in the future.\n\nBoth of these attitudes are explained by the consciousness of a void in the present.\n\nWhat interests me is what writers write about, the subjects of literature today.\n\nI am not defending the young writers from the old writers.\n\nI am defending what is, in the widest sense, the political or moral subject in writing.\n\nLawrence’s own books are descriptions of his experience.\n\nHis writing is so inextricably bound up with the value he set on living, that it seems a part of the experience.\n\nIt does not seem at all cut off from his life.\n\nThe organ of life, the moral life of human beings, is the subject, the consistent pattern.\n\nTo write a poetry which represents the modern moral life, which is yet not isolated from tradition.\n\nIn Yeats I see a fundamental division of the realist from the practical politician and mystic, the reporter attending séances.\n\nI see Eliot as an extremely isolated artist of great sensibility, a deaf and neurotic sensibility that produced great quartets.\n\nJames believed that the only values which mattered at all were those cultivated by individuals who had escaped from the general decadence.\n\nBefore everything else, the individual must be agonizingly aware of his isolated situation.\n\nNor is he to be selfish.\n\nHe is still occupied in building up the little nucleus of a real civilization possible for himself and for others possessing the same awareness as himself.\n\nMore recently, however, the situation seems to have profoundly altered, because the moral life of the individual has become comparatively insignificant.\n\nIn times of revolution or war, there is a divorce between the kind of morality that affects individuals and the morality of the state, of politics.\n\nIn time of war, the immoral purpose invented by the state is to beat the enemy and the usual taboos affecting individuals are almost suspended.\n\nThose taboos which serve to make an individual conform to a strict family code may become regarded as ludicrous.\n\nIn revolutionary times it is questions of social justice, of liberty, of war or peace, of election, that become really important.\n\nQuestions of private morality, of theft, of adultery, become almost insignificant.\n\nIn private life there remain few great saints and absolutely no great sinners.\n\nThe old question of free will, of whether the individual is free to choose between two courses of action, becomes superseded by another question:\n\nIs a society able to determine the course of its history?\n\nSociety is, of course, made up of individuals, and the choice, if there is any, lies finally with individuals.\n\nBut there is a difference between public acts and private acts of individuals.\n\nThere is a difference between the man who considers that he is a great and exciting sinner because he leads a promiscuous sexual life, and the man who decides not to live too promiscuously because to do so embarrasses and complicates his revolutionary activities.\n\nTo the second man the question of a morality in his private life becomes a matter of convenience, whereas his political conscience governs his actions.\n\nIn times of rest, of slow evolution and peace, society is an image of the individual quietly living his life and obeying the laws.\n\nIn violent times the moral acts of the individual seem quite unrelated to the immense social changes going on all around him.\n\nHe looks at civilization and does not see his own quiet image reflected there at all, but the face of something fierce and threatening that may destroy him.\n\nIt may seem foreign and yet resemble his own face.\n\nHe knows that if he is not to be destroyed, he must somehow connect his life again with this political life and influence it.\n\nThe extraordinary public events of the last few years, the war, revolutions, the economic crisis, are bound eventually into the tradition of literature, the organ of life.\n\nIt is not true to say that poetry is about nothing.\n\nPoetry is about history, but not history in the sense of school books.\n\nPoetry is a history which is the moral life, which is always contemporary.\n\nThe pattern, the technique, is the organ of life.\n\nI find myself opposed to the distinguished critic who says that art is, or should be, non-moral and non-political, but external and satiric, as much as I am bound also to oppose those who say that literature should become an instrument of propaganda.\n\nThe greatest art is moral, even when the artist has no particular moral or political axe to grind.\n\nConversely, that having a particular moral or political axe to grind does destroy art if the writer:\n\nsuspends his own judgments and substitutes the system of judging established by a political creed\n\nassumes knowledge of men and the future course of history, which he may passionately believe, but which, as an artist, he simply hasn’t got\n\nThe poet is not dealing in purely esthetic values, but he is communicating an experience of life which is outside his own personal experience.\n\nHe may communicate his own experience yet he is not bound by this, but by his own understanding.\n\nPure poetry does communicate a kind of experience and this is the experience of a void.\n\nFor the sense of a void is a very important kind of experience.\n\nAll theories of art for art’s sake and of pure art are the attempt to state the theory of a kind of art based on no political, religious or moral creed.\n\n“The old gang to be forgotten in the spring\n\nThe hard bitch and the riding master\n\nStiff underground; deep in clear lake\n\nThe lolling bridegroom, beautiful, there“\n\n(W.H. Auden)\n\nI am not stating how writers should write or even what they should write about.\n\nThat is their business, not mine.\n\nAt some time in his life an artist has got to come to grips with the objective, factual life around him.\n\nHe cannot spin indefinitely from himself unless he learned how to establish contact with his audience by the use of symbols which represent reality to his contemporaries.\n\nIf he does not learn this lesson, he ceases to be.\n\nHe needs to be islanded with imagery, which is derived from realistic observation.\n\nJust as dreams express the desires censored by our waking thoughts figure those desires in pictures which are actual to us.\n\nThus we find a museum full of the symbols which were at first observed as conditions in real life are used as symbols for different states of mind.\n\n“I have not the least hesitation in saying that I aspire to write in such a way that it would be impossible for an outsider to say whether I am at a given moment an American writing about England or an Englishman writing about America, and far from being ashamed of such an ambiguity I should be exceedingly proud of it, for it would be highly civilized.”\n\n(Henry James)\n\nThe most limited theme is capable of the greatest development and variation.\n\nJames is the spectator at the edge of life always refusing to enter into it.\n\nHis characters all listen and talk and comment and do not act.\n\nThe Beast in the Jungle is the study of a man in whose life nothing happens, it is all spent in waiting for the beast to spring.\n\nA life of leisured and comfortable journeys to frequented and beautiful cities or parts of the country is, in the majority of cases, the most uneventful life our society has to offer.\n\nIf it provides excitement, it provides excitement with the least possible amount of friction.\n\nThe personal conflict is a conflict between the desire to plunge too deeply into experience and the prudent resolution to remain a spectator, to absorb the tradition without losing own individuality, to choose between two kinds of isolation:\n\nthe isolation of a person so deeply involved in experiencing the sensations of a world foreign to him that he fails to affirm himself as a part of its unity\n\nto be isolated in the manner of absolutely refusing to be an actor in the play which so impressed him\n\n“What, then, have you dreamed of?“\n\n“A man whom I can have the luxury of respecting!\n\nA man whom I can admire enough to make me know I am doing it, whom I fondly believe to be cast in a bigger mould than most of the vulgar breed – large in character, great in talent, strong in will.\n\nIn such a man as that, one’s weary imagination at last may rest or may wander if it will, but with the sense of coming home again a greater adventure than any other.”\n\n(Henry James)\n\nThe tragic muse is a book in which all the conflicting aspects of life are represented:\n\nThe life of political action, the aesthetic life, and the drama.\n\nIntelligently responsive critical interest in an artist’s work is an almost necessary stimulus to creation.\n\n“It was as if he had said to me on seeing me:\n\nLay hands on the weak little relics of our common youth:\n\nOh, but you are not going to give me away, to hand me over in my raggedness and my poor accidents, quite helpless, friendless.\n\nYou are going to do the best for me you can, aren’t you?\n\nAnd since you are going to let me seem to justify them as I possibly can?”\n\n(Henry James)\n\nAt the Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris, which published the first edition of James Joyce’s Ulysses, historic figures made rare appearances to read their work:\n\nPaul Valéry, André Gide and Eliot.\n\nHemingway even broke his rule of not reading in public if Spender would read with him.\n\nSince Spender agreed, Hemingway appeared for a rare reading in public with him.\n\nParis Review interview, May 1978:\n\nHemingway I knew during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nHe often turned up in Valencia and Madrid and other places where I happened to be.\n\nWe would go for walks together and then he would talk about literature.\n\nHe was marvelous as long as he didn’t realize that he was talking about literature —\n\nI mean he’d say how the opening chapter of Stendhal’s La Chartreuse de Parme was the best description of war in literature, when Fabrizio gets lost, doesn’t know where he is at all in the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nThen I’d say:\n\n“Well, what do you think about Henry IV?\n\nDo you think Shakespeare writes well about war?”\n\n“Oh, I’ve never read Shakespeare,” he would say.\n\n“What are you talking about?\n\nYou seem to imagine I’m a professor or something.\n\nI don’t read literature.\n\nI’m not a literary man.”—\n\nThat kind of thing.\n\nIn Chicago, Hemingway worked as an associate editor of the monthly journal Cooperative Commonwealth, where he met novelist Sherwood Anderson.\n\nIt is believed that Anderson suggested Paris to Hemingway because “the monetary exchange rate” made it an inexpensive place to live, more importantly it was where “the most interesting people in the world” lived.\n\nIn Paris, Hemingway met American writer and art collector Gertrude Stein, Irish novelist James Joyce, American poet Ezra Pound (who “could help a young writer up the rungs of a career“) and other writers.\n\nThe Hemingway of the early Paris years was a “tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man.”\n\nHe and Hadley lived in a small walk-up at 74 rue du Cardinal Lemoine in the Latin Quarter, and he worked in a rented room in a nearby building.\n\nStein, who was the bastion of modernism in Paris, became Hemingway’s mentor and godmother to his son Jack.\n\nShe introduced him to the expatriate artists and writers of the Montparnasse Quarter, whom she referred to as the “Lost Generation“—a term Hemingway popularized with the publication of The Sun Also Rises.\n\nA regular at Stein’s salon, Hemingway met influential painters such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró and Juan Gris.\n\nHe eventually withdrew from Stein’s influence, and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades.\n\nEzra Pound met Hemingway by chance at Sylvia Beach’s bookshop Shakespeare and Company in 1922.\n\nThe two toured Italy in 1923 and lived on the same street in 1924.\n\nThey forged a strong friendship, and in Hemingway, Pound recognized and fostered a young talent.\n\nPound introduced Hemingway to James Joyce, with whom Hemingway frequently embarked on “alcoholic sprees“.\n\nDuring his first 20 months in Paris, Hemingway filed 88 stories for the Toronto Star newspaper.\n\nIn September 1923, the Hemingways returned to Toronto, where their son John was born on 10 October.\n\nHe missed Paris, considered Toronto boring, and wanted to return to the life of a writer, rather than live the life of a journalist.\n\nHemingway, Hadley and their son (nicknamed Bumby) returned to Paris in January 1924 and moved into a new apartment at 113 rue Notre-Dame des Champs.\n\nHemingway helped Ford Madox Ford edit The Transatlantic Review, which published works by Pound, John Dos Passos, Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, and Stein, as well as some of Hemingway’s own early stories, such as “Indian Camp“.\n\nWhen In Our Time was published in 1925, the dust jacket bore comments from Ford.\n\n“Indian Camp” received considerable praise.\n\nFord saw it as an important early story by a young writer.\n\nCritics in the United States praised Hemingway for reinvigorating the short story genre with his crisp style and use of declarative sentences.\n\nSix months earlier, Hemingway had met F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nThe pair formed a friendship of “admiration and hostility“.\n\nFitzgerald had published The Great Gatsby the same year:\n\nHemingway read it, liked it, and decided his next work had to be a novel.\n\nHe was very nice when one was alone with him, but the public Hemingway could be troublesome.\n\nOn one occasion, I remember we went into a bar where there were girls.\n\nHemingway immediately took up a guitar and started strumming, being “Hemingway”.\n\nOne of the girls standing with him pointed at me and said, “Tu amigo es muy guapo.”—\n\nYour friend is very handsome.\n\nHemingway became absolutely furious, bashed down the guitar and left in a rage.\n\nHe was very like that.\n\nAnother time, my first wife and I met him and Marty Gellhorn in Paris.\n\nThey invited us to lunch, someplace where there were steaks and chips, things like that, but my wife ordered sweetbread.\n\nAlso she wouldn’t drink.\n\nSo Hemingway said:\n\n“Your wife is yellow, that’s what she is, she’s yellow.\n\nMarty was like that, and do you know what I did?\n\nI used to take her to the morgue in Madrid every morning before breakfast.”\n\nWell, the morgue in Madrid before breakfast really must have been something.\n\nAbove: Ernest Hemingway with Lady Duff Twysden, his wife Hadley, and friends, July 1925 trip to Spain\n\nHemingway always said of me:\n\n“You’re okay.\n\nAll that’s wrong with you is you’re too squeamish.”\n\nSo he would describe modern war.\n\nHe’d say:\n\n“If you think of modern war from the point of view of a pilot, the city that he’s bombing isn’t all these people whom you like to worry about, people who are going to suffer —\n\nIt’s just a mathematical problem.\n\nIt’s like shading in a circle with dark areas where you drop your bombs.\n\nYou mustn’t think of it in a sentimental way at all.”\n\nAt that same meeting in Paris, he told me again I was squeamish, and then he said:\n\n“This is something you ought to look at, it will do you good.”\n\nHe produced a packet of about 30 photographs of the most horrible murders, which he carried around in his pockets.\n\nThis toughened one up in some way.\n\nHe told me that what motivated him really, while he was in Spain, wasn’t so much enthusiasm about the Republic, but to test his own courage.\n\nHe said:\n\n“Only if you actually go into battle and bullets are screeching all around you, can you know whether you’re a coward or not.”\n\nHe had to prove to himself that he wasn’t a coward.\n\nAnd he said:\n\n“Mind, you shit in your pants with fear.\n\nEveryone does that, but that isn’t what counts.”\n\nI don’t remember quite what it is that counts —\n\nBut he always wanted to test his own courage.\n\nPhysical courage to him was a kind of absolute value.\n\nIn 1936, Spender became a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain.\n\n(The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was the largest Communist party in Great Britain between 1920 and 1991.\n\nFounded in 1920 through a merger of several smaller Marxist parties, the CPGB gained the support of many socialist organisations and trade unions following the political fallout of the First World War and the Russian October Revolution.\n\nIdeologically the CPGB was a socialist party organised upon Marxism-Leninist ideology, strongly opposed to British colonialism, sexual discrimination and racial segregation.\n\nThese beliefs led many leading anti-colonial revolutionaries, feminists, and anti-fascist figures, to become closely associated with the Party.\n\nMany prominent CPGB members became leaders of Britain’s trade union movements.)\n\nHarry Pollitt, its head, invited him to write for the Daily Worker on the Moscow Trials.\n\n(The Moscow Trials were a series of show trials held in the Soviet Union between 1936 and 1938 at the instigation of Joseph Stalin.\n\nThey were nominally directed against “Trotskyists” and members of the “Right Opposition” of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nAt the time the three Moscow Trials were given extravagant titles:\n\nthe “Case of the Trotskyite-Zinovievite Terrorist Center” (or the Zinoviev-Kamenev Trial, also known as the ‘Trial of the Sixteen‘, August 1936)\n\nthe “Case of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center” (or the Pyatakov-Radek Trial, January 1937)\n\nthe “Case of the Anti-Soviet ‘Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites’” (or the Bukharin-Rykov Trial, also known as the ‘Trial of the Twenty-One‘, March 1938)\n\nThe defendants were Old Bolshevik Party (“old party guard“) leaders and top officials of the Soviet Secret Police (KGB).\n\nMost were charged under Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code with conspiring with the Western powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union, and restore capitalism.\n\nSeveral prominent figures were sentenced to death during this period outside these trials.\n\nThe Moscow Trials led to the execution of many of the defendants.\n\nThe trials are generally seen as part of Stalin’s Great Purge, a campaign to rid the party of current or prior opposition, including Trotskyists and leading Bolshevik cadre members from the time of the Russian Revolution or earlier, who might even potentially become a figurehead for the growing discontent in the Soviet populace resulting from Stalin’s mismanagement of the economy.\n\nStalin’s rapid industrialization during the period of the First Five Year Plan and the brutality of the forced agricultural collectivization had led to an acute economic and political crisis (1928 – 1933), made worse by the global Great Depression, which led to enormous suffering on the part of the Soviet workers and peasants.\n\nStalin was acutely conscious of this fact and took steps to prevent it taking the form of an opposition inside the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to his increasingly totalitarian rule.)\n\nIn late 1936, Spender married Inez Pearn, whom he had recently met at an Aid to Spain meeting.\n\nShe is described as ‘small and rather ironic‘ and ‘strikingly good-looking‘.\n\nSpender was married to his first wife, Inez, having been part-converted to heterosexuality through an affair with an American, Muriel Gardiner.\n\nSleeping with a woman, he told Isherwood, was “more satisfactory, more terrible, more disgusting, and, in fact, more everything“.\n\nOne of his poems speaks of having “a third mouth of the dark to kiss“.\n\nThe marriage to Inez ended as the Second World War began.\n\nIn 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, the Daily Worker sent him to Spain on a mission to observe and report on the Soviet ship Komsomol, which had sunk while carrying Soviet weapons to the Second Spanish Republic.\n\nSpender travelled to Tangier and tried to enter Spain via Cadiz, but was sent back.\n\nHe then travelled to Valencia, where he met Ernest Hemingway and Manuel Altolaguirre.\n\nYou stared out of the window on the emptiness\n\nOf a world exploding:\n\nStones and rubble thrown upwards in a fountain\n\nBlasted sideways by the wind.\n\nEvery sensation except loneliness\n\nWas drained out of your mind\n\nBy the lack of any motionless object the eye could\n\nfind.\n\nYou were a child again\n\nWho sees for the first time things happen.\n\nWhen you smiled,\n\nEverything in the room was shattered;\n\nOnly you remained whole\n\nIn frozen wonder, as though you stared\n\nAt your image in the broken mirror\n\nWhere it had always been silverly carried.\n\n“To A Spanish Poet” (for Manuel Altolaguirre), The Still Centre, 1939\n\n(Tony Hyndman, alias Jimmy Younger, had joined the International Brigades, which were fighting against Francisco Franco’s forces in the Battle of Guadalajara.)\n\nThe guns spell money’s ultimate reason\n\nIn letters of lead on the spring hillside.\n\nBut the boy lying dead under the olive trees\n\nWas too young and too silly\n\nTo have been notable to their important eye.\n\nHe was a better target for a kiss.\n\nHis name never appeared in the papers.\n\nThe world maintained its traditional wall\n\nRound the dead with their gold sunk deep as a well,\n\nWhilst his life, intangible as a Stock Exchange\n\nrumour, drifted outside.\n\nConsider his life which was valueless\n\nIn terms of employment, hotel ledgers, news files.\n\nConsider. One bullet in ten thousand kills a man.\n\nAsk. Was so much expenditure justified\n\nOn the death of one so young and so silly\n\nLying under the olive tree, O world, O death?\n\n“Ultima Ratio Regum“, The Still Centre, 1939\n\nIn July 1937, Spender attended the Second International Writers’ Congress, the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war, held in Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid, and attended by many writers, including Ernest Hemingway, André Malraux and Pablo Neruda.\n\nPollitt told Spender “to go and get killed.\n\nWe need a Byron in the movement.”\n\nDeep in the winter plain, two armies\n\nDig their machinery, to destroy each other.\n\nMen freeze and hunger. No one is given leave\n\nOn either side, except the dead, and wounded.\n\nAll have become so nervous and so cold\n\nThat each man hates the cause and distant words\n\nWhich brought him here, more terribly than bullets.\n\n“Two Armies“, The Still Centre, 1939\n\nSpender was imprisoned for a while in Albacete.\n\nIn Madrid, he met André Malraux.\n\nThey discussed André Gide’s Retour de l’U.R.S.S..\n\nBecause of medical problems, Spender went back to England and bought a house in Lavenham.\n\nIn 1939, he divorced.\n\nHis 1938 translations of works by Bertolt Brecht and Miguel Hernández appeared in John Lehmann’s New Writing.\n\nSpender felt close to the Jewish people.\n\nHis mother, Violet Hilda Schuster, was half-Jewish.\n\n(Her father’s family were German Jews who converted to Christianity, and her mother came from an upper-class family of Catholic German, Lutheran Danish and distant Italian descent).\n\nSpender’s second wife, Natasha, whom he married in 1941, was also Jewish.\n\nIn 1941, he married Natasha Litvin, 10 years his junior.\n\nThe end of the War coincided with the birth of their first child.\n\nSpender continued to write poetry throughout his life, but it came to consume less of his literary output in later years than it did in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nCritics praised his work as an autobiographer and critic.\n\nIn a Times Literary Supplement review, Julian Symons noted “the candor of the ceaseless critical self-examination Spender has conducted for more than half a century in autobiography, journals, criticism, poems.”\n\nSpender was at his best when he was writing autobiography.\n\nThe poet himself pointed echoed this assertion in the postscript to The Thirties and After: Poetry, Politics, People, 1933 – 1970 (1978):\n\n“I myself am, it is only too clear, an autobiographer.\n\nAutobiography provides the line of continuity in my work. I am not someone who can shed or disclaim his past.”\n\nIn 1942, he joined the fire brigade of Cricklewood and Maresfield Gardens as a volunteer.\n\nSpender met several times with the poet Edwin Muir.\n\nAfter he was no longer left-wing, he was one of those who wrote of their disillusionment with Communism in the essay collection The God that Failed (1949), along with Arthur Koestler and others.\n\n(The God that Failed is a 1949 collection of six essays by Louis Fischer, André Gide, Arthur Koestler, Ignazio Silone, Stephen Spender and Richard Wright.\n\nThe common theme of the essays is the authors’ disillusionment with and abandonment of Communism.)\n\nIt is thought that one of the big areas of disappointment was the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, which many leftists saw as a betrayal.\n\nLike Auden, Isherwood and several other outspoken opponents of fascism in the 1930s, Spender did not see active military service in World War II.\n\nHe was initially graded “C” upon examination because of his earlier colitis, poor eyesight, varicose veins and the long-term effects of a tapeworm in 1934.\n\nBut he pulled strings to be re-examined and was upgraded to “B“, which meant that he could serve in the London Auxiliary Fire Service.\n\nSpender spent the winter of 1940 teaching at Blundell’s School.\n\nAfter the War, Spender was a member of the Allied Control Commission, restoring civil authority in Germany.\n\nAll the posters on the walls\n\nAll the leaflets in the streets\n\nAre mutilated, destroyed or run in rain,\n\nTheir words blotted out with tears,\n\nSkins peeling from their bodies\n\nIn the victorious hurricane.\n\nAll the lessons learned, unlearned;\n\nThe young, who learned to read, now blind\n\nTheir eyes with an archaic film;\n\nThe peasant relapses to a stumbling tune\n\nFollowing the donkey`s bray;\n\nThese only remember to forget.\n\nBut somewhere some word presses\n\nOn the high door of a skull and in some corner\n\nOf an irrefrangible eye\n\nSome old man memory jumps to a child\n\n— Spark from the days of energy.\n\nAnd the child hoards it like a bitter toy.\n\n“Fall of a City“, Selected Poems, 1941\n\nWith Cyril Connolly and Peter Watson, Spender co-founded Horizon magazine and served as its editor from 1939 to 1941.\n\nA poet can only write about what is true to his own experience, not about what he would like to be true to his experience.\n\nPoetry does not state truth.\n\nIt states the conditions within which something felt is true.\n\nEven while he is writing about the little portion of reality which is part of his experience, the poet may be conscious of a different reality outside.\n\nHis problem is to relate the small truth to the sense of a wider, perhaps theoretically known, truth outside his experience.\n\n“Foreword“, The Still Centre (1939)\n\nFrom 1947 to 1949, he went to the US several times and saw Auden and Isherwood.\n\nSince we are what we are, what shall we be\n\nBut what we are? We are, we have\n\nSix feet and seventy years, to see\n\nThe light, and then resign it for the grave.\n\n“Spiritual Explorations” from Poems of Dedication (1947)\n\nHe was the editor of Encounter magazine from 1953 to 1966, but resigned after it emerged that the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which published it, was covertly funded by the CIA.\n\nSpender insisted that he was unaware of the ultimate source of the magazine’s funds.\n\nHe taught at various American institutions and accepted the Elliston Chair of Poetry at the University of Cincinnati in 1954.\n\nIn 1961, he became professor of rhetoric at Gresham College, London.\n\nSpender helped found the magazine Index on Censorship, was involved in the founding of the Poetry Book Society and did work for UNESCO.\n\n(Index on Censorship is an organization campaigning for freedom of expression, which produces a quarterly magazine of the same name from London.\n\nIt is directed by the non-profit-making Writers and Scholars International, Ltd. (WSI) in association with the UK-registered charity Index on Censorship (founded as the Writers and Scholars Educational Trust), which are both chaired by the British television broadcaster, writer and former politician Trevor Phillips.\n\nIndex is based at 1 Rivington Place in central London.\n\nWSI was created by poet Stephen Spender, Oxford philosopher Stuart Hampshire, the publisher and editor of The Observer David Astor, and the writer and expert on the Soviet Union Edward Crankshaw.\n\nThe founding editor of Index on Censorship was the critic and translator Michael Scammell, who still serves as a patron of the organization.\n\nThe original impetus for the creation of Index on Censorship came from an open letter addressed “To World Public Opinion” by two Soviet dissenters, Pavel Litvinov and Larisa Bogoraz.\n\nIn the words of the samizdat periodical A Chronicle of Current Events, they described “the atmosphere of illegality” surrounding the January 1968 trial of Ginzburg and Galanskov and called for “public condemnation of this disgraceful trial, for the punishment of those responsible, the release of the accused from detention and a retrial which would fully conform with the legal regulations and be held in the presence of international observers.“\n\n(Alexander Ginzburg resumed his dissident activities on release from the camps, until expelled from the USSR in 1979.\n\nThe writer Yuri Galanskov died in a camp in November 1972.)\n\nThe Times (London) published a translation of the open letter and in reply the English poet Stephen Spender composed a brief telegram:\n\n“We, a group of friends representing no organisation, support your statement, admire your courage, think of you and will help in any way possible.”\n\nAmong the other 15 British and US signatories were:\n\nthe poet W. H. Auden\n\nEnglish philosopher A. J. Ayer\n\nAmerican-British musician Yehudi Menuhin\n\nEnglish man of letters J. B. Priestley\n\nEnglish actor Paul Scofield\n\nEnglish sculptor Henry Moore\n\nBritish philosopher Bertrand Russell\n\nAmerican writer Mary McCarthy\n\nRussian-French-American composer Igor Stravinsky\n\nLater that year, on 25 August, Bogoraz, Litvinov and five others demonstrated on Red Square against the invasion of Czechoslovakia.\n\nA few weeks before, Litvinov sent Spender a letter (translated and published several years later in the first May 1972 issue of Index).\n\nHe suggested that a regular publication might be set up in the West “to provide information to world public opinion about the real state of affairs in the USSR“.\n\nSpender and his colleagues, Stuart Hampshire, David Astor, Edward Crankshaw and founding editor Michael Scammell decided, like Amnesty International, to cast their net wider.\n\nThey wished to document patterns of censorship in right-wing dictatorships — the military regimes of Latin America and the dictatorships in Greece, Spain and Portugal — as well as the Soviet Union and its satellites.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1971, Amnesty International began to publish English translations of each new issue of A Chronicle of Current Events, which documented human rights abuses in the USSR and included a regular “Samizdat Update“.\n\nIn a recent interview, Michael Scammell explains the informal division of labour between the two London-based organizations:\n\n“When we received human rights material we forwarded it to Amnesty and when Amnesty received a report of censorship they passed it on to us.”\n\nOriginally, as suggested by Scammell, the magazine was to be called Index, a reference to the lists or indices of banned works that are central to the history of censorship: the Roman Catholic Church’s Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Index of Forbidden Books), the Soviet Union’s Censor’s Index, and apartheid South Africa’s Jacobsens Index of Objectionable Literature.\n\nScammell later admitted that the words “on censorship” were added as an afterthought when it was realised that the reference would not be clear to many readers.\n\n“Panicking, we hastily added the words ‘on Censorship’ as a subtitle“, wrote Scammell in the December 1981 issue of the magazine, “and this it has remained ever since, nagging me with its ungrammaticality (Index of Censorship, surely) and a standing apology for the opacity of its title.”\n\nDescribing the organization’s objectives at its inception, Stuart Hampshire said:\n\n“The tyrant’s concealments of oppression and of absolute cruelty should always be challenged.\n\nThere should be noise of publicity outside every detention centre and concentration camp and a published record of every tyrannical denial of free expression.”\n\nIndex on Censorship magazine was founded by Michael Scammell in 1972.\n\nIt supports free expression, publishing distinguished writers from around the world, exposing suppressed stories, initiating debate, and providing an international record of censorship.\n\nThe quarterly editions of the magazine usually focus on a country or region or a recurring theme in the global free expression debate.\n\nIndex on Censorship also publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers.\n\nIndex Index, a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, was published in the magazine until December 2008.\n\nWhile the original inspiration to create Index came from Soviet dissidents, from its outset the magazine covered censorship in right-wing dictatorships then ruling Greece and Portugal, the military regimes of Latin America, and the Soviet Union and its satellites.\n\nThe magazine has covered other challenges facing free expression, including religious extremism, the rise of nationalism, and Internet censorship.\n\nIn the first issue of May 1972, Stephen Spender wrote:\n\n“Obviously there is the risk of a magazine of this kind becoming a bulletin of frustration.\n\nHowever, the material by writers which is censored in Eastern Europe, Greece, South Africa and other countries is among the most exciting that is being written today.\n\nMoreover, the question of censorship has become a matter of impassioned debate and it is one which does not only concern totalitarian societies.“\n\nIssues are usually organised by theme and contain a country-by-country list of recent cases involving censorship, restrictions on freedom of the press and other free speech violations.\n\nOccasionally, Index on Censorship publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers as well as censored ones.\n\nOver the half century it has been in existence, Index on Censorship has presented works by some of the world’s most distinguished writers and thinkers, including:\n\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn\n\nMilan Kundera\n\nVáclav Havel\n\nNadine Gordimer\n\nSalman Rushdie\n\nDoris Lessing\n\nArthur Miller\n\nNoam Chomsky\n\nUmberto Eco\n\nIssues under the editorship of Rachael Jolley have covered taboos, the legacy of the Magna Carta and William Shakespeare’s enduring legacy in protest.\n\nThere have been special issues on China, reporting from the Middle East, and on Internet censorship.\n\nThe Russia issue (January 2008) won an Amnesty International Media Award 2008 for features by Russian journalists Fatima Tlisova and Sergei Bachinin, and veteran Russian free speech campaigner Alexei Simonov, founder of the Glasnost Defence Foundation.\n\nOther landmark publications include Ken Saro-Wiwa’s writings from prison (Issue 3/1997) and a translation of the Czechoslovak Charter 77 manifesto drafted by Václav Havel and others in Issue 3/1977.\n\nIndex published the first English translation of Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s Nobel Prize acceptance speech.\n\nIndex on Censorship published the stories of the “disappeared” in Argentina and the work of banned poets in Cuba, the work of Chinese poets who escaped the massacres that ended the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.\n\n(The Tiananmen Square protests were student-led demonstrations held in Tiananmen Square, Beijing during 1989.\n\nIn what is known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops armed with assault rifles and accompanied by tanks fired at the demonstrators and those trying to block the military’s advance into Tiananmen Square.\n\nThe protests started on 15 April and were forcibly suppressed on 4 June when the government declared martial law and sent the People’s Liberation Army to occupy parts of central Beijing.\n\nEstimates of the death toll vary from several hundred to several thousand, with thousands more wounded.\n\nThe popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests is sometimes called the ’89 Democracy Movement or the Tiananmen Square Incident.\n\nThe protests were precipitated by the death of pro-reform Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Hu Yaobang in April 1989 amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social change in post-Mao China, reflecting anxieties among the people and political elite about the country’s future.\n\nThe reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy that benefited some people but seriously disadvantaged others.\n\nThe one-party political system also faced a challenge to its legitimacy.\n\nCommon grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy, and restrictions on political participation.\n\nAlthough they were highly disorganized and their goals varied, the students called for greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech.\n\nAt the height of the protests, about one million people assembled in the Square.\n\nAs the protests developed, the authorities responded with both conciliatory and hardline tactics, exposing deep divisions within the party leadership.\n\nBy May, a student-led hunger strike galvanized support around the country for the demonstrators.\n\nThe protests spread to some 400 cities.\n\nAmong the CCP top leadership, Premier Li Peng and Party Elders Li Xiannian and Wang Zhen called for decisive action through violent suppression of the protesters, and ultimately managed to win over Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping and President Yang Shangkun to their side.\n\nOn 20 May, the State Council declared martial law.\n\nThey mobilized as many as 300,000 troops to Beijing.\n\nThe troops advanced into central parts of Beijing on the city’s major thoroughfares in the early morning hours of 4 June, killing both demonstrators and bystanders in the process.\n\nThe military operations were under the overall command of General Baibing, half-brother of President Yang Shangkun.\n\nThe international community, human rights organizations, and political analysts condemned the Chinese government for the massacre.\n\nWestern countries imposed arms embargoes on China.\n\nThe Chinese government made widespread arrests of protesters and their supporters, suppressed other protests around China, expelled foreign journalists, strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic press, strengthened the police and internal security forces, and demoted or purged officials it deemed sympathetic to the protests.\n\nMore broadly, the suppression ended the political reforms begun in 1986 and halted the policies of liberalization of the 1980s, which were only partly resumed after Deng Xiaoping’s Southern Tour in 1992.\n\nConsidered a watershed event, reaction to the protests set limits on political expression in China, limits that have lasted up to the present day.\n\nRemembering the protests is widely associated with questioning the legitimacy of CCP rule and remains one of the most sensitive and most widely censored topics in China.)\n\nIndex on Censorship has a long history of publishing writers in translation, including Bernard Henri Lévy, Ivan Klima, Ma Jian and Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, and news reports including Anna Politkovskaia’s coverage of the war in Chechnya (Issue 2/2002).\n\nTom Stoppard’s play Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1977) is set in a Soviet mental institution and was inspired by the personal account of former detainee Victor Fainberg and Clayton Yeo’s expose of the use of psychiatric abuse in the USSR, were published in Index on Censorship (Issue 2, 1975).\n\nThe play was first performed with the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nStoppard became a member of the advisory board of Index on Censorship in 1978 and remains connected to the publication as a patron of Index.\n\nIndex on Censorship published the World Statement by the International Committee for the Defence of Salman Rushdie in support of “the right of all people to express their ideas and beliefs and to discuss them with their critics on the basis of mutual tolerance, free from censorship, intimidation and violence“.\n\n(As much as I advocate freedom of expression, I feel that this power to express one’s opinions needs to be balanced by a sense of responsibility.\n\nThose who were surprised by the trouble caused by Rushdie’s book failed to understand that in questioning the singularity of God the Satanic Verses ignored or subverted the supreme importance that all Muslims bestow on God’s unity – in addition to being disrespectful to the Prophet.\n\nRushdie’s sin was to give credence to a pre-Islamic belief that Allah had three daughters, each of whom held divine power.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad’s teaching holds that God had neither wife nor children, and this would have been incompatible with His role as the Creator and the Almighty.\n\nTo believe that God is not omnipotent (all and solely powerful) is to commit shirk.\n\nIn strict Muslim societies, shirk is so serious that the only appropriate punishment is death.\n\nThe West regarded the outcry over the Verses as an affront to freedom of speech.\n\nHowever, the important lesson to be learned from the Rushdie incident is that, to strict Muslims, the central tenets of Islam are so powerful that they can transcend all other considerations.\n\nPersonally, I think that God, should He exist, can defend Himself and does not need Man to defend His honour for Him.\n\nThat being said, Rushdie is a fool who should have known better, considering he came from an Islamist background and is a highly-educated man.)\n\nSix months later, Index published the Hunger Strike Declaration from four student leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Liu Xiaobo, Zhou Duo, Hou Dejian and Gao Xin.\n\nIndex Index, a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, continued to be published in each edition of the magazine until December 2008, when this function was transferred to the website.\n\nThe offences against free expression documented in that first issue’s Index Index listing included censorship in Greece and Spain, then dictatorships, and Brazil, which had just banned the film Zabriskie Point on the grounds that it “insulted a friendly power” – the United States, where it had been made and freely shown.\n\n(Zabriskie Point is a 1970 American drama film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni (1912 – 2007) and starring Mark Frechette (1947 – 1975), Daria Halprin and Rod Taylor (1930 – 2015).\n\nIt was widely noted at the time for its setting in the counterculture of the United States.\n\nSome of the film’s scenes were shot on location at Zabriskie Point in Death Valley.\n\nThe film was an overwhelming commercial failure and was panned by most critics upon release.\n\nIts critical standing has increased, however, in the decades since.\n\nIt has to some extent achieved cult status and is noted for its cinematography, use of music, and direction.)\n\nIndex on Censorship paid special attention to the situation in then Czechoslovakia between the Soviet invasion of 1968 and the Velvet Revolution of 1989, devoting an entire issue to the country eight years after the Prague Spring (Issue 3/1976).\n\nIt included several pieces by Václav Havel, including a first translation of his one act play Conversation, and a letter to Czech officials on police censorship of his December 1975 production of The Beggar’s Opera by John Gay.\n\nThe magazine also carried articles on the state of the Czech theatre and a list of the so-called Padlock Publications, 50 banned books that circulated only in typescript.\n\nIndex also published an English version of Havel’s play Mistake, dedicated to Samuel Beckett in gratitude for Beckett’s own dedication of his play Catastrophe to Havel.\n\nBoth short plays were performed at the Free Word Centre to mark the launch of Index‘s special issue looking back at the changes of 1989 (Issue 4, 2009).\n\nFree Speech is not For Sale, a joint campaign report by Index on Censorship and English PEN highlighted the problem of so-called libel tourism (actively searching for reasons to sue) and the English law of defamation’s chilling effect on free speech.\n\nAfter much debate surrounding the report’s ten key recommendations, the UK Justice Secretary Jack Straw pledged to make English defamation laws fairer.\n\n“A free press can’t operate or be effective unless it can offer readers comment as well as news.\n\nWhat concerns me is that the current arrangements are being used by big corporations to restrict fair comment, not always by journalists but also by academics.”\n\nHe added:\n\n“The very high levels of remuneration for defamation lawyers in Britain seem to be incentivising libel tourism.”\n\nThese campaigns and others were illustrative of then CEO John Kampfner’s strategy, supported by then chair Jonathan Dimbleby, to boost Index‘s public advocacy profile in the UK and abroad beginning in 2008.\n\nUntil then the organization did not regard itself as “a campaigning organisation in the mould of Article 19 or Amnesty International“, as former news editor Sarah Smith noted in 2001, preferring to use its “understanding of what is newsworthy and politically significant” to maintain pressure on oppressive regimes (such as China, from 1989) through extensive coverage.\n\nIndex on Censorship also runs a programme of UK based and international projects that put the organization’s philosophy into practice.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, Index on Censorship worked in Afghanistan, Burma, Iraq, Tunisia and many other countries, in support of journalists, broadcasters, artists and writers who work against a backdrop of intimidation, repression, and censorship.\n\nThe organization’s arts programmes investigate the impact of current and recent social and political change on arts practitioners, assessing the degree and depth of self-censorship.\n\nIt uses the arts to engage young people directly into the freedom of expression debate.\n\nIt works with marginalised communities in UK, creating new platforms, on line and actual for creative expression.\n\nIndex on Censorship works internationally to commission new work, not only articles for print and online, but also new photography, film & video, visual arts and performance.\n\nExamples have included an exhibition of photo stories produced by women in Iraq, Open Shutters, and programme involving artists from refugee and migrant communities in UK, linking with artists from their country of origin, imagine art after, exhibited at Tate Britain in 2007.\n\nIndex has also worked with Burmese exiled artists and publishers on creating a programme in support of the collective efforts of Myanmar’s creative community.\n\nIndex also commissioned a new play by Actors for Human Rights, Seven Years With Hard Labour, weaving together four accounts from former Burmese political prisoners now living in the UK.\n\nIndex also co-published a book of poetry by homeless people in London and St. Petersburg.\n\nIn December 2002, Index on Censorship faced calls to cancel a charity performance of the John Malkovich film The Dancer Upstairs at London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA).\n\nSpeaking to students the previous May, Malkovich had been asked whom – as the star of Dangerous Liaisons – he would like to fight a duel with.\n\nHe picked Robert Fisk, The Independent newspaper’s Middle East correspondent, and George Galloway, at the time a Glasgow Labour MP, adding that rather than duel them, he would “rather just shoot them“.\n\nFisk wrote an article saying that Malkovich’s comment was one of many threats he now received and that “almost anyone who criticizes US or Israeli policy in the Middle East is now in this free-fire zone“.\n\nThe media rights group Reporters sans Frontieres (RSF) (Reporters without Borders) condemned Malkovich, but in an online article Index‘s then Associate Editor (now deputy CEO) Rohan Jayasekera, dismissed the actor’s comments as “flippant” in an article on the organization’s site.\n\nIn November 2004, Index on Censorship attracted further controversy over another indexonline.org blog post by Jayasekera that, to many readers, seemed to condone or justify the murder of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh.\n\nThe blog described Van Gogh was a “free speech fundamentalist” on a “martyrdom operation, roaring his Muslim critics into silence with obscenities” in an “abuse of his right to free speech“.\n\nDescribing Van Gogh’s film Submission as “furiously provocative“, Jayasekera concluded by describing his death as:\n\n“A sensational climax to a lifetime’s public performance, stabbed and shot by a bearded fundamentalist, a message from the killer pinned by a dagger to his chest, Theo Van Gogh became a martyr to free expression.\n\nHis passing was marked by a magnificent barrage of noise as Amsterdam hit the streets to celebrate him in the way the man himself would have truly appreciated.\n\nAnd what timing!\n\nJust as his long-awaited biographical film of Pim Fortuyn’s life is ready to screen.\n\nBravo, Theo!\n\nBravo!”\n\nSubmission is a 2004 English-language Dutch short drama film produced and directed by Theo van Gogh, and written by Ayaan Hirsi Ali (a former member of the Dutch House of Representatives for the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy).\n\nIt was shown on the Dutch public broadcasting network (VPRO) on 29 August 2004.\n\nThe film’s title is one of the possible translations of the Arabic word “Islam“.\n\nThe film tells the story of four fictional characters played by a single actress wearing a veil, but clad in a see-through Hijab, her naked body painted with verses from the Quran.\n\nThe characters are Muslim women who have been abused in various ways.\n\nThe film contains monologues of these women and dramatically highlights three verses of the Koran, by showing them painted on women’s bodies.\n\nWriter Hirsi Ali has said:\n\n“It is written in the Koran a woman may be slapped if she is disobedient.\n\nThis is one of the evils I wish to point out in the film“.\n\nIn an answer to a question about whether the film would offend Muslims, Hirsi Ali said that:\n\n“If you’re a Muslim woman and you read the Koran, and you read in there that you should be raped if you say ‘no’ to your husband, that is offensive.\n\nAnd that is insulting.“\n\nDirector of the film, Theo Van Gogh, who was known as a controversial and provocative personality, called the film a “political pamphlet“.\n\nThe film drew praise for portraying the ways in which women are abused in accordance with fundamentalist Islamic law, as well as anger for criticizing Islamic canon itself.\n\nIt drew the following comment from movie critic Phil Hall:\n\n“Submission was bold in openly questioning misogyny and a culture of violence against women because of Koranic interpretations.\n\nThe questions raised in the film deserve to be asked:\n\nIs it divine will to assault or kill women?\n\nIs there holiness in holding women at substandard levels, denying them the right to free will and independent thought?\n\nAnd ultimately, how can such a mind frame exist in the 21st century?“\n\nFilm critic Dennis Lim, on the other hand, stated that:\n\n“It’s depressing to think that this morsel of glib effrontery could pass as a serious critique of conservative Islam.“\n\nAnother critic referred to the stories told in the film as “simplistic, even caricatures“.\n\nAfter the film’s broadcast on Dutch television, newspaper De Volkskrant reported claims of plagiarism against Hirsi Ali and Van Gogh, made by Internet journalist Francisco van Jole.\n\nVan Jole said the duo had “aped” the ideas of Iranian American video artist Shirin Neshat.\n\nNeshat’s work, which made abundant use of Persian calligraphy projected onto bodies, had been shown in the Netherlands in 1997 and 2000.\n\nOn 2 November 2004, Van Gogh was assassinated in public by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Dutch-Moroccan Muslim with a Dutch passport.\n\nA letter, stabbed through and affixed to the body by a dagger, linked the murder to Van Gogh’s film and his views regarding Islam.\n\nIt was addressed to Ayaan Hirsi Ali and called for a jihad (holy war) against kafir (unbelievers or infidels), against America, Europe, the Netherlands, and Hirsi Ali herself.\n\nBouyeri was jailed for life, for which in the Netherlands there is no possibility of parole, and pardons are rarely granted.\n\nFollowing the murder of Van Gogh, tens of thousands gathered in the center of Amsterdam to mourn Van Gogh’s death.\n\nThe murder widened and polarized the debate in the Netherlands about the social position of its more than one million Muslim residents.\n\nIt also put the country’s liberal tradition further into question, coming only two years after Pim Fortuyn’s murder.\n\n(Pim Fortuyn was a Dutch politician, author, civil servant, businessman, sociologist and academic who founded the party Pim Fortuyn List (Lijst Pim Fortuyn or LPF) in 2002.\n\nFortuyn criticized multiculturism, immigration and Islam in the Netherlands.\n\nHe called Islam “a backward culture“, and was quoted as saying that if it were legally possible, he would close the borders for Muslim immigrants.\n\nFortuyn was assassinated during the 2002 Dutch national election campaign by Volkert van der Graaf, a left-wing environmentalist and animal rights activist.\n\nIn court at his trial, van der Graaf said he murdered Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as “scapegoats” and targeting “the weak members of society” in seeking political power.\n\nThe assassination shocked many residents of the Netherlands and highlighted the cultural clashes within the country. )\n\nIn an apparent reaction against controversial statements about the Islamic, Christian and Jewish religions— such as those Van Gogh had made — the Dutch Minister of Justice, Christian Democrat Piet Hein Donner, suggested Dutch blasphemy laws should either be applied more stringently or made more strict.\n\nThe liberal D66 party suggested scrapping the blasphemy laws altogether.)\n\nThere were many protests from both left- and right-wing commentators regarding Rohan Jayasekera’s comments.\n\nNick Cohen of The Observer newspaper wrote in December 2004, that:\n\n“When I asked Jayasekera if he had any regrets, he said he had none.\n\nHe told me that, like many other readers, I shouldn’t have made the mistake of believing that Index on Censorship was against censorship, even murderous censorship, on principle – in the same way as Amnesty International is opposed to torture, including murderous torture, on principle.\n\nIt may have been so its radical youth, but was now as concerned with fighting ‘hate speech’ as protecting free speech.“\n\nUrsula Owen, the chief executive of Index on Censorship, while agreeing that the blog post’s “tone was not right” contradicted Cohen’s account of his conversation with Jayasekera in a letter to The Observer.\n\nIn December 2009, the magazine published an interview with Jytte Klausen about a refusal of Yale University Press to include the Mohammed cartoons in Klausen’s book The Cartoons that Shook the World.\n\nThe magazine declined to include the cartoons alongside the interview.)\n\nAcross this dazzling\n\nMediterranean\n\nAugust morning\n\nThe dolphins write such\n\nIdeograms:\n\nWith power to wake\n\nMe prisoned in\n\nMy human speech\n\nThey sign: ‘I AM!’\n\n“Dolphins“, Stephen Spender\n\nSpender was appointed the 17th Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1965.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Spender frequently visited the University of Connecticut, which he declared had the “most congenial teaching faculty” he had encountered in the United States.\n\nGreat poetry is always written by somebody straining to go beyond what he can do.\n\nAs quoted in The New York Times (26 March 1961)\n\nSpender was Professor of English at University College London (UCL) from 1970 to 1977 and then became Professor Emeritus.\n\nHe was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) at the 1962 Queen’s Birthday Honours, and knighted in the 1983 Queen’s Birthday Honours.\n\nAt a ceremony commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Normandy Invasion on 6 June 1984, US President Ronald Reagan (1911 – 2004) quoted from Spender’s poem “The Truly Great” in his remarks:\n\nGentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender’s poem.\n\nYou are men who in your “lives fought for life and left the vivid air signed with your honour”.\n\nThe Truly Great\n\nI think continually of those who were truly great.\n\nWho, from the womb, remembered the soul’s history\n\nThrough corridors of light, where the hours are suns,\n\nEndless and singing. Whose lovely ambition\n\nWas that their lips, still touched with fire,\n\nShould tell of the Spirit, clothed from head to foot in song.\n\nAnd who hoarded from the Spring branches\n\nThe desires falling across their bodies like blossoms.\n\nWhat is precious, is never to forget\n\nThe essential delight of the blood drawn from ageless springs\n\nBreaking through rocks in worlds before our earth.\n\nNever to deny its pleasure in the morning simple light\n\nNor its grave evening demand for love.\n\nNever to allow gradually the traffic to smother\n\nWith noise and fog, the flowering of the spirit.\n\nNear the snow, near the sun, in the highest fields,\n\nSee how these names are fêted by the waving grass\n\nAnd by the streamers of white cloud\n\nAnd whispers of wind in the listening sky.\n\nThe names of those who in their lives fought for life,\n\nWho wore at their hearts the fire’s centre.\n\nBorn of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun\n\nAnd left the vivid air signed with their honour.\n\nSpender also had profound intellectual workings with the world of art, including Pablo Picasso.\n\nThe artist Henry Moore did etchings and lithographs conceived to accompany the work of writers, including Charles Baudelaire and Spender.\n\nMoore’s work in that regard also included illustrations of the literature of Dante Alighieri, André Gide and William Shakespeare.\n\nThe exhibition was held at The Henry Moore Foundation.\n\nSpender collected and befriended artists such as:\n\nJean Arp\n\nFrank Auerbach\n\nFrancis Bacon\n\nLucian Freud\n\nAlberto Giacometti\n\nArshile Gorky\n\nPhilip Guston\n\nDavid Hockney\n\nGiorgio Morandi\n\nand others.\n\nIn The Worlds of Stephen Spender, the artist Frank Auerbach selected art work by those masters to accompany Spender’s poems.\n\nSpender wrote China Diary with David Hockney in 1982, published by Thames and Hudson art publishers in London.\n\nThe Soviet artist Wassily Kandinsky created an etching for Spender, Fraternity, in 1939.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 1933, Spender fell in love with Tony Hyndman, and they lived together from 1935 to 1936.\n\nIn 1934, Spender had an affair with Muriel Gardiner.\n\nIn December 1936, shortly after the end of his relationship with Hyndman, Spender fell in love with and married Inez Pearn after an engagement of only three weeks.\n\nThe marriage broke down in 1939.\n\nIn 1941, Spender married Natasha Litvin, a concert pianist.\n\nThe marriage lasted until his death.\n\nSpender’s sexuality has been the subject of debate.\n\nSpender’s seemingly changing attitudes have caused him to be labelled bisexual, repressed, latently homophobic or simply something complex that resists easy labelling.\n\nMany of his friends in his earlier years were gay.\n\nSpender had many affairs with men in his earlier years, most notably with Hyndman, who was called “Jimmy Younger” in his memoir World Within World.\n\nAfter his affair with Muriel Gardiner, he shifted his focus to heterosexuality, but his relationship with Hyndman complicated both that relationship and his short-lived marriage to Inez Pearn.\n\nHis marriage to Natasha Litvin in 1941 seemed to have marked the end of his romantic relationships with men but not the end of all homosexual activity, as his unexpurgated diaries have revealed.\n\nSubsequently, he toned down homosexual allusions in later editions of his poetry.\n\nNevertheless, he was a founding member of the Homosexual Law Reform Society, which lobbied for the repeal of British sodomy laws.\n\nSpender sued author David Leavitt for allegedly using his relationship with “Jimmy Younger” in Leavitt’s While England Sleeps in 1994.\n\nThe case was settled out of court with Leavitt removing certain portions from his text.\n\nI am not really sure what I should say in regards to Spender’s proclivities.\n\nFrankly, what happens in the bedroom in my opinion should remain in the bedroom.\n\nDo I really need to know about Spender’s extracurricular affairs to enjoy (or not) his poetry?\n\nIn the 1980s, Spender’s writing — The Journals of Stephen Spender, 1939-1983, Collected Poems, 1928-1985, and Letters to Christopher: Stephen Spender’s Letters to Christopher Isherwood, 1929-1939, in particular—placed a special emphasis on autobiographical material.\n\nI’m struggling at the end to get out of the valley of hectoring youth, journalistic middle age, imposture, moneymaking, public relations, bad writing, mental confusion.\n\nOn turning 70 in Journals 1939 – 1983 (1986), as quoted in Time magazine (20 January 1986)\n\nWhat I had not foreseen\n\nWas the gradual day\n\nWeakening the will\n\nLeaking the brightness away\n\nFor I had expected always\n\nSome brightness to hold in trust,\n\nSome final innocence\n\nTo save from dust\n\n“What I Expected Was“, Stephen Spender\n\nOne, a poet, went babbling like a fountain\n\nThrough parks. All were jokes to children.\n\nAll had the pale unshaven stare of shuttered plants\n\nExposed to a too violent sun.\n\n“Exiles From Their Land, History Their Domicile“, The Still Centre, 1939\n\nIn the New York Times Book Review, critic Samuel Hynes commented that:\n\n“The person who emerges from Spender’s letters is neither a madman nor a fool, but an honest, intelligent, troubled young man, groping toward maturity in a troubled time.\n\nAnd the author of the journals is something more.\n\nHe is a writer of sensitivity and power.”\n\nOn 16 July 1995, Spender died of a heart attack in Westminster, London, aged 86.\n\nHe was buried in the graveyard of St Mary on Paddington Green Church in London.\n\nDeath is another milestone on their way.\n\nWith laughter on their lips and with winds blowing round them\n\nThey record simply\n\nHow this one excelled all others in making driving belts.\n\n“The Funeral“\n\nSpender’s name was most frequently associated with that of W.H. Auden, perhaps the most famous poet of the 1930s.\n\nHowever, some critics found the two poets dissimilar in many ways.\n\nIn the New Yorker, for example, Vendler observed that:\n\n“At first Spender imitated Auden’s self-possessed ironies, his determined use of technological objects. … But no two poets can have been more different.\n\nAuden’s rigid, brilliant, peremptory, categorizing, allegorical mind demanded forms altogether different from Spender’s dreamy, liquid, guilty, hovering sensibility.\n\nAuden is a poet of firmly historical time, Spender of timeless nostalgic space.”\n\nIn the New York Times Book Review, Kazin similarly concluded that Spender “was mistakenly identified with Auden.\n\nAlthough they were virtual opposites in personality and in the direction of their talents, they became famous at the same time as ‘pylon poets’— among the first to put England’s gritty industrial landscape of the 1930s into poetry.”\n\nThe term “pylon poets” refers to “The Pylons” a poem by Spender that many critics described as typical of the Auden generation.\n\nThe much-anthologized work, included in one of Spender’s earliest collections, Poems (1933), as well as in his Collected Poems, 1928 – 1985, includes imagery characteristic of the group’s style and reflects the political and social concerns of its members.\n\nIn The Angry Young Men of the Thirties (1976), Elton Edward Smith recognized that in such a poem:\n\n“The poet, instead of closing his eyes to the hideous steel towers of a rural electrification system and concentrating on the soft green fields, glorifies the pylons and grants to them the future.\n\nAnd the nonhuman structure proves to be of the very highest social value, for rural electrification programs help create a new world of human equality.”\n\nThe Pylons\n\nThe secret of these hills was stone, and cottages\n\nOf that stone made,\n\nAnd crumbling roads\n\nThat turned on sudden hidden villages\n\nNow over these small hills, they have built the concrete\n\nThat trails black wire\n\nPylons, those pillars\n\nBare like nude giant girls that have no secret.\n\nThe valley with its gilt and evening look\n\nAnd the green chestnut\n\nOf customary root,\n\nAre mocked dry like the parched bed of a brook.\n\nBut far above and far as sight endures\n\nLike whips of anger\n\nWith lightning’s danger\n\nThere runs the quick perspective of the future.\n\nThis dwarfs our emerald country by its trek\n\nSo tall with prophecy\n\nDreaming of cities\n\nWhere often clouds shall lean their swan-white neck.\n\nOver a 65-year career, Stephen Spender wrote scores of poems, hundreds of reviews and essays, and arguably one of the finer memoirs of the 20th century.\n\nAnd yet he may end up better remembered for a cab ride.\n\nIn 1980, Spender battled a lost wallet, an octogenarian driver, and 287 miles of dismal weather to taxi from a lecture in Oneonta, NY, to a dinner date with Jacqueline Onassis in Manhattan.\n\n(“I simply had to get there” is the breathless quote detractors are happy to supply.)\n\nFairly or unfairly, Spender’s reputation as a toady has steadily consolidated, while his reputation as a poet has steadily declined.\n\nHis most recent defender, John Sutherland, over 600 pages of an otherwise reverent biography, makes only the meekest case for Spender the literary artist.\n\n“They never stopped trying”, Sutherland writes on Page 1 of Stephen Spender: A Literary Life, alluding cryptically to unidentified enemies.\n\n“But somehow his quality (and I would a"
