        "text": "Munich 1856 : four maps that will change your view of the city\n\na mental asylum , where today young people are said to meet .\n\na crypt chapel , where they are now digging tunnels for the S-Bahn .\n\nallotment holders cultivate the soil of former farmers .\n\nthe oldest official map of Munich brings captivating stories to light .\n\nit is annoying when geographical maps are not up-to-date .\n\nanyone who has ever got worked up because the car 's sat-nav is showing a green field instead of a bypass knows that .\n\nthe historical maps of the digital BayernAtlas , an offering from the State Government 's Geoportal Bayern , are anything but up-to-date - and yet it is precisely for this reason that they are so informative .\n\nespecially when one compares them with current online maps .\n\nthen it becomes clear how the towns and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich 's Merkur newspaper have changed since the 19th century .\n\nthe digital BayernAtlas is a patchwork quilt that one does not quite recognise for what it is at first .\n\nwithin the large overview map , were worked in detailed maps for towns and municipalities , so-called original-lay-of-the-land sheets .\n\naccording to information from the Bavarian Surveying and Mapping Authority , these came into being between 1810 and 1864 and arise out of the first survey of Bavaria .\n\ntheir commissioner : Napoleon .\n\nthe French army commander had occupied Bavaria since the spring in 1800 , during the War of the Second Coalition with Austria .\n\nNapoleon wanted to gain an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical survey - naturally for military purposes .\n\neven if the French troops finally retreated with the Treaty of Lunéville from 9th February 1801 : it was the current neighbours who had the idea to create a comprehensive map of Bavaria .\n\nelector Max IV . Joseph propelled the project further forward , founding the \" Topographical Bureau \" - and with that , the Bavarian Surveying and Mapping Authority .\n\nthe original lay-of-the-land sheet for Munich originates from 1856 and , like all the others , can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .\n\nthe comparison of past / present is most impressive taking the example of the state capital .\n\nthe city has stretched out in all directions and coalesced .\n\nan example of this is Untersendling , which still appears relatively isolated on the map from 1856 .\n\nSendling was incorporated as an urban district of Munich 21 years after the map was created .\n\ntoday , Untersendling lies in the middle of the city .\n\naround 1856 , Untersendling 's houses are concentrated along what is today Plinganserstraße , which was first named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser , a ringleader of the Bavarian farmers ' revolt against Austria in 1705 .\n\nwhere the West Park is today , one sees nothing but field - at first sight : upon zooming in , a more detailed small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand-numbered plots from the so-called \" original record , \" from which the property tax was derived .\n\ntoday , it is no longer farmers who occupy small parcels there - rather , it is allotment holders of the \" Land in Sonne \" facility .\n\na large green area is apparent to the north of Untersendling .\n\nTheresienwiese , since 1810 the scene of Oktoberfest , was in the 19th century still actually a \" Wiese \" - a meadow - and not a concrete wasteland .\n\non the other side of the Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .\n\nin the original lay-of-the-land sheet , in the area where today the borough of Au-Haidhausen is , one can make out not only the street name \" am Gasteig \" or the elevation \" Auf der Lüften \" - but can actually read in large letters \" mental asylum . \"\n\nyes , here on Auerfeldstraße , they once imprisoned people with delusions .\n\nthe Munich district mental asylum \" Auf der Auer Lüften \" had come to life there in 1858 / 59 .\n\nfrom 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .\n\n\" he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the practice of chaining up the so-called mad men .\n\nwhat is more , he forbade the staff from using violence against the inmates , \" says Hermann Wilhelm , leader of the Haidhausen Museum , which has been busying itself for an exhibition with the establishment .\n\noriginally there was place for 280 patients ; later this was expanded to 500 places .\n\nat some point even this capacity was no longer enough - the reason why the district mental asylum in Haar was constructed in 1905 .\n\nthe Isar Amper Clinic , East Munich , has been located there since 2006 , one of the largest psychiatric units in Germany .\n\non the plot of the former Auer institution , young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum .\n\nthe order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth centre with training programmes .\n\nto the west lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost , and to the east , residential houses from the 1980s .\n\nin 2015 , the \" Casa Don Bosco \" nursery was built - in the architectural style of the original mental asylum building , which had been destroyed in the Second World War in bomb attacks .\n\nMarienplatz was recorded as the \" main square \" in around 1856 , and Kaufingerstraße was called \" Kaufinger Gasse . \"\n\nthe Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich .\n\nthe bombs of the Allies tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .\n\none big one remains up to this day - at the Marienhof .\n\nthe English Institute , small commercial premises and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood in the Marienhof , where these days , preparations for the second S-Bahn main line are underway , with first digging to follow on 5th April 2017 .\n\nyou can use the slider control to compare the old Munich map with the aerial view from today - and to fill in the hole at the Marienhof .\n\ncivil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri\n\nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state 's discriminatory policies and racist attacks .\n\n\" the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , effective through August 28th , 2017 , calls for African American travelers , visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable , race-based incidents occurring statewide recently , and noted therein , \" the group 's statement reads .\n\na recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits , as well as the state 's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert , the NAACP said .\n\n\" you have violations of civil rights that are happening to people .\n\nthey are being pulled over because of their skin color , they are being beaten up or killed , \" the president of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , told The Kansas City Star .\n\n\" we are hearing complaints at a rate we have not heard before . \"\n\nit is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .\n\nthe group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .\n\nSanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state , and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime .\n\nthe advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General 's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites .\n\n\" the advisory is for people to be aware , and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri , \" Chapel said .\n\n\" people need to be ready , whether it is bringing bail money with them , or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state . \"\n\nMissouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI 's hate crime reporting program , ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations .\n\nthe travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination .\n\npreviously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling .\n\ntravel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately , advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US .\n\npasture fence project is fundamental\n\nthe Fischerbach pasture fence project is a successful project and will be continued next year .\n\nmembers of the Bundestag for the CDU Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a first-hand view .\n\nrepresentatives from the Fischerbach local CDU group met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives at Rechtgrabenhof farm , belonging to the Schwendemann family .\n\nto start with , Markus Schwendemann gave insights into his business , in which he cultivates 55 hectares of pasture and 40 hectares of woodland , keeps 40 milk cows and just as many young stock , and accommodates five apartments of holiday makers .\n\nSchwendemann says that , for him , there is no alternative to the \" Black Forest milk \" marketing channel he uses for the milk from his cows .\n\nonly regional produce is served to the holiday-makers .\n\nsince he is also BLHV chairman for Fischerbach , he described the pasture fence project as \" fundamentally important . \"\n\nI cannot make a profit on that kind of steep-sloping ground .\n\ngrassland areas make for a lot of work , a lot has to be done with the string trimmer .\n\n\" we have to grapple with the conditions and with the topography here , \" stressed Schwendemann .\n\nin 2003 , he took over his parents ' business and he manages this without chemical crop protection and fertilisers , even if it is not an organic farm that he is running .\n\nfor Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that \" the community has recognised the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy to have the Leader funding . \"\n\nthe farmers need support to the tune of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare .\n\none hopes that with that , afforestation of the area could then be drawn out for a long while .\n\n\" the biggest asset that we have are the people who work in agriculture and who give thought to how to bring their businesses forward , \" stressed the mayor .\n\nthe farmers are often the target of criticism thanks to the funding .\n\nusing the pasture fence funding , a total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced off in 2013 .\n\nthe areas kept open with these amount to 40 hectares , which may not be afforested until at least 2023 .\n\nof the total costs , to the tune of 71,500 euros , half was funded via Leader , and a quarter was borne by the community of Fischerbach .\n\nthe farmers were thus left with 12,610 euros , which they had to invest in the 16.2-kilometre pasture fence .\n\n\" the great advantage is the longevity of the fences , \" explained Schwendemann .\n\nKordula Kovac stressed : \" you 're doing a really good job . without farmers we would not be able to function . \"\n\nPeter Weiß is also standing firm : \" first-class foodstuffs are produced here . \"\n\nthe Baden-Württemberg directive on countryside conservation ( LPR ) makes the government funding of pasture fences possible .\n\nits goal is to keep the Black Forest open .\n\na prerequisite is the existence of one of the funding scenarios as outlined by the LPR .\n\nin addition , the fenced-off area is not allowed to be farmable with a tractor ( gradient of over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation .\n\nfor the 2018 Fischerbach pasture fence project , an application is currently underway from eight participants with 24 plots who would like to build just shy of 16 kilometres of fence .\n\nthe areas of land to be kept open equate to 35 hectares ; the calculated costs amount to more than 112,000 euros .\n\nis nothing sacred ?\n\nnow Trump 's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty\n\nthe surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues .\n\nAmericans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003 .\n\nStephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN 's Jim Acosta over the president 's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration .\n\nin fairness , Miller did not attack the statue itself .\n\na horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did .\n\nbut he did attack its meaning , and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus 's famous poem was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the monument itself was completed .\n\nas Miller scolded Acosta : \" I do not want to get off into a whole thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world .\n\nthe poem that you are referring to , that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . \"\n\nMiller is factually correct , but as he put it himself , this is not really about history .\n\nit is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus 's startling words , the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : \" your tired , your poor , / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore . \"\n\nthere has never been a time when the \" wretched refuse \" has been more visible on our screens .\n\nMiller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump 's USA .\n\nthis conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war : it is really a conflict about the meaning of America .\n\nLazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act .\n\nthe sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope , the female embodiment of Liberty .\n\nLazarus changed that meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice .\n\nand she gives herself a very different name : mother of Exiles .\n\nthe marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .\n\nand just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , rightwingers have long wanted to change it back .\n\nthe great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in , but is rather an early neocon , taking the American flame out to the benighted world : \" lady Liberty is stepping forward .\n\nshe is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world .\n\nthe torch is not to light the way to the United States . \"\n\nrather unusually , Limbaugh actually hit on something .\n\nthe meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception .\n\nLazarus 's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted , wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys .\n\nit is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives .\n\nher statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear .\n\nand of course , this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise .\n\ntheir torch is meant not to light the way , but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power .\n\nworld Championships 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB\n\nEilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team\n\nUK Athletics ' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make \" a massive contribution to the team . \"\n\na record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .\n\nblack believes \" there is something special evolving \" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that .\n\n\" we embrace it and we are trying to understand it and we will push on that until we work it out , \" Black said .\n\n\" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it is something to do with what they 've done .\n\nScottish Athletics think it is something to do with what they 've done .\n\nBritish athletics : it is something to do with what they 've done .\n\nand the guy on the corner street , too .\n\nwhatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . \"\n\nseveral of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m , while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain .\n\n\" Eilidh is slightly modest .\n\nher captain 's speech was incredible , \" says Black .\n\n\" a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated .\n\nthe passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great . \"\n\nthe Commonwealth silver medallist , who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships , says it is \" incredible \" 16 Scots are in the British team .\n\nScotland 's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .\n\nmiddle-distance runner Muir is leading the way , having set five British and two European records in the past year .\n\nshe will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m .\n\nChris O 'Hare , who runs in the 1500m , is another Scot to watch , following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games .\n\nDoyle remembers her first world championships , when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell .\n\nthe team captain says she is \" hugely proud \" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team , but , in some cases , will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals .\n\n\" the special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team , so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me , \" she added .\n\n\" obviously , I am very proud of all the Scots who 've made the team .\n\nit just shows how far we have come .\n\nand they are here as well-established athletes , athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums .\n\nas for my captain 's speech ?\n\nyeah , I think it went well .\n\nI just drew on the fact that we are very lucky in this situation in that we have got a home World Championships .\n\nso it is really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium .\n\nI am getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it is just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there . \"\n\nblocking critics from Facebook : don 't run for public office , if you cannot take heat from voters\n\nthe father of our country knew something about bad press .\n\nAmericans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles .\n\nhe chafed at the criticism , sure .\n\nbut he did not silence his critics .\n\nbecause back in 1783 , Washington said , \" the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and , dumb & silent we may be led , like sheep , to the Slaughter . \"\n\nthat brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan , who needs to work on being more like Washington .\n\nHogan 's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page .\n\nand the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week .\n\nthe governor 's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous , and the online commentary was rich with a \" who cares ? \" backlash .\n\n\" it is only Facebook , \" plenty of folks said .\n\nbut it matters .\n\nand it especially matters when it is a guy like Hogan .\n\nthis is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular .\n\nhe has the second-highest approval rating of the nation 's 50 governors .\n\nHogan is not a reactionary hothead .\n\nhe is shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles .\n\nhe is also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents , playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page .\n\nso blocking people who come to the governor 's page - which is a public forum , labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .\n\nin an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor 's actions , arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them .\n\nbut it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online .\n\nthe Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .\n\nand they are just that - real people talking to their elected leaders : a teacher , a business owner and a pastor , not trolls .\n\nthey all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .\n\nthe pastor quoted the Bible in his post , appealing to Hogan 's Catholic faith .\n\nattorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .\n\n\" I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items , \" she wrote in the comment section of The Post 's news story .\n\n\" I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic , they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort , rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens . \"\n\nwhat the governor 's staff called a \" concentrated spam attack \" others would probably call \" advocacy . \"\n\nthe Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .\n\nit is a lot cleaner than the old days , when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters .\n\nbut that is exactly what 's happening , only digitally .\n\nHogan is not the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media .\n\nPresident Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed .\n\none of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia .\n\nthe chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page .\n\nand in Kentucky , Gov. Matt Bevin ( R ) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter .\n\nthis shouldn 't be so hard .\n\nin Washington 's time , the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet .\n\nthe number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership .\n\nand even back then , Washington had anonymous trolls .\n\npeople using the pseudonyms \" Juricola , \" \" Valerius , \" \" Belisarius , \" and \" Portius \" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington 's decisions .\n\npetitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity , Commerce , and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project .\n\nbut he did not silence them .\n\nfreedom of speech , dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation .\n\nand true leadership means accepting that .\n\nRonan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club\n\nformer European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .\n\nthe Northern Irishman , who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales , is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club 's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi .\n\n\" I watched Renaissance Club being built , and we are seeing it come to its glory with this event , \" said Rafferty
