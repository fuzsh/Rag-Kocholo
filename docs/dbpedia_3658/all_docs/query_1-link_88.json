He began running casually in college and after a season of triathlon training transitioned to a distance running focus. He started his run streak (at least two miles every day) in April 2018 and averages around 50 miles per week. Jacob runs a mix of roads and trails; most recently, he qualified for the 2021 Boston Marathon (2:51) and has been getting into the trail running scene. Jacob often places in the top 10 finishers in local races around the Portland, Maine area. In addition to running, he surfs, bikes (both mountain and road), and nordic skis. You can check out Jacob’s recent activities on Strava here.\n\nJohn Tribbia\n\nJohn is mountain runner who lives, works, and trains in the Boulder, Colorado Area and has an enthusiastic penchant to ascend mountains as fast as possible. He has won races such as America's Uphill, Imogene Pass Run, and the US Skyrunner Vertical Kilometer Series; he's placed atop the podium at the Red Bull 400 (twice), US Trail Marathon Championships (twice), and the Catalina Island Marathon; and he was the first person to ever ascend Grandeur Peak in Salt Lake City in under 40 minutes. Even though many of his racing accomplishments have been on the off-beaten path, you can also find him running on roads, running in snowshoes, and bike commuting with his son in tow on a cargo e-bike. If you follow him on Strava (https://www.strava.com/athletes/1044838), you'll notice he runs before the break of dawn almost everyday. His favorite food is Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches.\n\nRyan Eller\n\nRenee is a former U. S. Marine journalist, which is when her enjoyment of running and writing started. She isn’t that awesome of a runner, but she tries really hard. Most of her weekly 50-60 miles take place on rural country roads in Nebraska, meaning mud, gravel, dirt, hills, and the occasional field.She has PR’s of 1:30:59 for the half marathon and 3:26:45 for the marathon.\n\nJamie Hershfang\n\nJamie is 29 years old and currently running 100+ miles per week. She has run many marathons, with a PR of 2:49 and has recently moved up to the ultra distances. She completed a solo 100k in 7:36:40 and set the Chicago Lakefront Trail FKT. In 2021 she was the fastest US woman on road for 50 miles with a time of 6:07:11. She is training to qualify to represent team USA at a world championship. Outside of training, she is the store manager at Fleet Feet Lakeview in Chicago.\n\nNils Scharff\n\nI am 30 years old, located in Heilbronn – Germany and married to my beautiful wife since last year. I’ve done all sorts of sports for all my life, often 5-7 times a week. But my young running career just started 3 years ago with a company run which I joined together with some colleagues in 2017. From there I never let go. I ran roughly 1000km in my first year, doubled and then trippled that number in 2018 and 2019. I've run 4 marathons to date with a PR of 2:54. My other PRs are 17:32 for the 5k, 37:33 for 10k and 1:22 for the half. But besides chasing PRs and dreams on roads and trails, especially getting outside and escaping my desk is what makes my love for running (and other outdoor sports like hiking or climbing).\n\nJoost de Raeymaeker\n\nJoost is a Belgian in his 50s living in Luanda, Angola, Africa, where he faces the heat, humidity and general chaos to run anything between 60-100 miles per week. He’s on a mission to win in his age group in the 6 Marathon Majors and has completed half of his project, with a 2:26:10 PB in Berlin in 2019 at 51. He ran in primary school, but then thought it would be a lot cooler to be a guitar player in a hard rock band, only picking up running again in 2012, gradually improving his results. His Strava is here: https://www.strava.com/athletes/reimaka\n\nJohannes Klein\n\nJohannes joined the RTR crew in everyone's favorite year 2020, as a long-time follower turned contributor.\n\nHe's a 28-year-old recreational runner living near Karlsruhe, Germany, where he fittingly ran his first 14K 'race' as part of a marathon relay team. Realizing that trying to run a certain pace was quite fun, he became hooked and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nCurrently, he is trying to get his legs back on track (or rather on the road) to tackle a sub-40-minute 10K.\n\nIn general, Johannes can be found outside most of the time, doing the occasional hike, strolling along the river or playing some streetball. His favorite inside activities are blogging, cooking and comparing running shoes online, which, to be honest, he's kind of addicted to, since working in a running store triggered his shoe obsession.\n\nYou can find Johannes on Instagram (@running_joe92) and Strava\n\n(https://www.strava.com/athletes/30454954).\n\nShannon Payne\n\nShannon is a Colorado native currently residing in Northern California. NorCal is nice, but Colorado has her heart. Having run competitively for around 20 years, she was a 7x All American at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, was a 2x member of the U.S. Mountain Running Team, 2x winner of the Mt. Washington Road Race, and was 3rd at the 2014 World Mountain Running Long Distance Championship. Her favorite shoes currently include the Hoka Torrent, Saucony Kinvara, and Brooks Launch, and her favorite runs include anything that goes uphill."
