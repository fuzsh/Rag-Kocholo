The cultural anthropologist did his doctorate at the University of Heidelberg and was a founding member of the Zentrum für Mittelmeerstudien at the RUB. He carried out long term anthropological fieldwork in Seville (1985/86), Gibraltar (1995/96), Texas (2003/05) and Tangier (since 2013), as well as on Brexit (2019/20). His research focuses on ethnology, corruption, cosmopolitism, possession, and borderlands.\n\nDieter Haller\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City An Ethnography\n\nBibliographic information published by the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek The Deutsche Nationalbibliothek lists this publication in the Deutsche Nationalbibliografie; detailed bibliographic data are available in the Internet at http:// dnb.d-nb.de © 2021 transcript Verlag, Bielefeld All rights reserved.

I owe him too much to mention at this point. He was the first to open doors to TanGib for me. Even more: He was a human being. A second dedication – If one is allowed to do something like that in a scientific publication – goes to my friend Ahmed Halimi (†), who passed away on April 30, 2020. A great soul. I am also particularly grateful to Philip Saunders, who helped to put the German text into an understandable English version! My thanks also go to Stefanie Hof, Seda Sönmeztürk and Emre Ünal – without their help the final version of the book could not have been completed. Joshua Marrache, Christian September, Pepe Fuentes Reyes and Abdellatif Bousseta, my main interlocutors in the fields, cannot be thanked enough. Steffen Wippel, Nino Aivashizvili-Gehne, Hafid Zghouli, Lutz Jablonowsky, Ralf Ullrich and Christoph Sandmann gave me helpful feedback on different versions of the work. I also thank my friends and guarantors in Tangier, Gibraltar and Seville from the bottom of my heart: Tamara Dragadze, John Carreras, Corinne Senior Marrache, Mohammed Stitou Zhare and the Ḥamādša of Tangier, Tarik Dervish, Rachid Tafersiti Zarouila, Moumen Smihi, Rica Assayag and her sisters Perla and Fortuna, Hamza Ben Rabah, Benaissa Msiid, Ahmed Mellak, Barbara Ritchie, Annette and Paul Tunbridge, Estrella Abudarham, Lina Searle and her family, Alice Mascarenhas, Dizzy Buckingham, Priscilla and Henry Sacramento, Steve Marin and Brahim Krikaz, the Khemlichi family, Manolo Batista Nieto, Jacques Vignet Zunz, Michel Peraldi, Gil Podesta, Guy Povedano, Kevin Lane, Charles Trico, Joseph Berllaque, Sam Benady, Olga and Ahmed Benchekroun, Trino Cruz Seruya, Jimmy Imossi, Lydia Mifsud, David Weber, Maxine Torrent del Prat, Father Danny Hernandez, Keith Tonna, Tito Benady, Dorothy Victory, Younes Mubarak, Alegria Benaim, Ernest Wiley, Alegria Benarosh, Mustafa Ben Amar, Abdellah Sghir, Ana Gabriela da Silva Araujo Bonnet, Anna Rossi and Paolo Businelli, Abdelghani Aoufi, Mr. Shakkara, Mr. Jamal, Youssef Mribti and Paco Parado. I also thank the members of various online platforms, as well as Johanna Rolshoven. Unusual for\n\n8\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nan acknowledement is also an ingratitude: At various points in the production and dissemination of knowledge, sometimes people did everything possible to ensure that my research would fail. I was assured of courtesies in the friendliest way but denied access to crucial institutions – especially in Gibraltar. I could write an ethnography on knowledge and power, but I do not want to do so yet, so as not to poison my heart. It is worth mentioning, however, because even in Gibraltar, access to knowledge does not always follow British fair play but denial of access to archives, resources and free research. Names do not need to be mentioned; they are all too familiar to those involved.\n\nTanGib – Two Places, One City? Ethnological Views of the Strait\n\nSoor el Maâgazine on the Boulevard in Tangier – the view pours out over the port and the Bay of Tangier. Similar to the famous Café Hafa on the cliffs of Mershan, if the weather is good, one can see not only the opposite coast of southern Spain but also the Rock of Gibraltar in the far right background. From there, from the southernmost point again, Europa Point, the view extends to the south with a view of Ceuta, Jebel Musa, Parsley Island, the harbor of Ksar es Sghir and, in good weather, of the lighthouse of Malabata and the Corniche of Tangier.\n\nIllustration 1: View of the Straits from Gibraltar, 02.04.2019\n\nTwo continents, two countries, two perspectives, two places – but one single city? Up to now, the relationship of the two cities to each other has been narrated and examined primarily from the viewpoint of separation, difference and the drawing of boundaries: Orient vs. Occident, Islam vs. Catholicism, South vs. North, Atlantic vs. Mediterranean. This was influenced to a considerable extent by the integration of Tangier into Morocco (1956) and the creation of the European Union (EU) external border (1991). In this book, I will explain what this traditional focus on divisive\n\n10\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nelements obscures, namely, the similarities between the two cities, which, at times and in many ways, allow us to speak of a single city. The aim is to salvage these buried relationships both cultural-historically and ethnographically, and to present and relate them to other findings. I am an ethnologist and my research region is the Strait of Gibraltar. What may sound strange to an English speaking audience is the self description as an ethnologist: in Germany post 1945 it refers to what elsewhere is called social or/and cultural anthropology. But different to Anglosaxon and French traditions focusing predominantly on contemporary cultures, it retains also a cultural historical perspective. Ethnology therefore researches the cultural meaning of social institutions and agency in contemporary and historical perspective. The present book is based on my field research in Tangier and Gibraltar on transborder, transboughaz (Boughaz = Strait) relations in the context not only of Brexit (2019–20) but also on previous field research in Seville (1985/86), Gibraltar (1995/96) and Tangier (2013–14, and since 2014). In this way, I attempt to connect the separation between ethnographic research presently dominating anthropology in the German-speaking world and the cultural-historical approach that has disappeared or been ceded to other disciplines, and, thus, to correspond to truly ethnological research. In contrast to other disciplines, ethnology is less interested in official discourses or institutional and structural practices but rather on the informal side of life and coping with existence: worlds and wisdom of so-called simple people. Ethnologists want to make the voices of the unheard audible – this was an important concern, especially in colonialism, and it still remains important today. Therefore, it is important to document things, practices and voices meticulously and sustainably in order to contribute to an archive that will provide future generations with testimony about the past. The North of Morocco and Andalusia have often been studied by ethnologists. Andalusia has even prompted the establishment of a subdiscipline, Mediterranean ethnology, through the research of Julian Pitt-Rivers (1961). At that time, ethnologists were researching mainly in villages, small towns and rural areas. Few colleagues turned their attention to cities at all; Tangier and Gibraltar fell almost completely out of the researchers’ field of vision. At the same time, various ethnologists lived in Tangier, including Edward Westermarck (1909, 1920, 1933, 1968), Karl Emil Schabinger von Schowingen (1967; Guessous 1977), Elisa Chimenti (1935, 1964, 2003), Carleton S. Coon (1933, 1980), Jacques Vignet-Zunz (2016), Tamara Dragadze (1965) and Michel Peraldi (2007b). The city itself, however, was seldom a subject of their work. Hardly any ethnologists lived in Gibraltar, on the other hand, although Gareth Stanton published several texts about the city (1991, 1994, 2009).\n\nTanGib – Two Places, One City?\n\nIllustration 2a: Antroplogists from Tangier: Edward Westermarck (left) and Karl Schabinger von Schowingen (right)\n\nIllustration 2b: Antroplogists from Tangier: Elisa Chimenti (left), Carleton Coon (middle) and Jacques Vignet-Zunz (right)\n\nIllustration 2c: Antroplogists from Tangier: Tamara Dragadze (left), Michel Peraldi (middle) and Abdelmajid Hannoum (right)\n\n11\n\n12\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nTanGib? What seems strange at first sight turns out to be not quite so absurd on closer inspection, because Tangier and Gibraltar have been connected in many different ways for a long time: Mythical–geographical, rhythmic–sensual, architectural–urbanistic and human–cultural. The list of similarities is not complete, but the message is clear. Practically until the end of Tangier's internationality, this city maintained special links with Gibraltar for decades, not only socially but also culturally and economically. A considerable part of the smuggled goods leaving Tangier reached Spain via Gibraltar. (Ceballos López 2009: 330; translation by the author) Their stories have not yet been told. I would like to tackle these in this book under the following guiding questions: • • •\n\nWhat findings allow us to speak of a common city of TanGib over the last 200 years? Which epochs of consolidation, stabilization and disentanglement of relations can be identified? What approaches are there in the context of Brexit to tie in with old bonds and revitalize them or to establish new ones?\n\nChapter one will offer a first access to the field of myths of commonality in rhythm and sensuality. Different concepts of time and experiences of movement on the water in the face of the other side will play a role and the materiality of urban space, forms of living and relationship of the cities to their topography. In chapter two, I present theoretical approaches that determine my work in this book. Inevitably, approaches of earlier research are also included. The present work, however, is decisively characterized by a new definition of the concept of the cultural circle, which is capable of thinking both of persistent structures of a longue durée and of process-related and actor-centered procedures. The term definition itself comes from latin de and fines: From the border. Usually a definition is thought to be separated by other domains by sharp and linear borders. However, this is a limited notion itself, for borders can be thought as lines or as zones. I do prefer the latter. The zonal character of my understanding of a definition is basic to the concept of Boughazidad (boughaz = Strait in Arabic, -idad = -ity/ship in Spanish), i.e. a ‘sea community,’ which denotes the habitualization and internalization of the spatial relationship between port and sea, can be used to describe a resource that is used by various actors in times of need. Here, I also tie in with the concept of neighborliness of Moroccan thinker Rachid Boutayeb. He understands neighborhood thinking “as an ethic of compassion […], of ambiguity tolerance, whose discourse is not afraid to articulate itself in the language of spontaneity, empathy and cooperation.” Boutayeb distinguishes this thinking from thematic thinking,\n\nTanGib – Two Places, One City?\n\nwhich he regards as an irrational answer understands the coldness of pure reason when it remains trapped in a “logic of exclusion” (2017: 12). It is precisely this kind of neighborliness that I have in mind when I write about Boughazidad. It follows seamlessly on the assumption of Franz Boas, who regarded science as meaningless without a heart: “[S]o that one can recognize the humanity of other people” (King 2020: 43). This humanity of other people is usually framed in terms such as “society”, which differentiates between a humane “us” from an in/sub/non humane ”other”. Eric Wolf (1988) has carved out masterfully the european understanding of society linked to polity and history. Boughazidad with its focuss on neighborliness, social practice and territoriality could be added to the examples from China and the Muslim World, where other understandings of the social such as loyalty and faith dominate. The third chapter presents the methodological approaches of my research, both of preliminary work in Seville, Gibraltar and Tangier, and of recent research on Brexit. Chapters four and five are devoted to the history of the political–economic and demographic interdependence of Tangier and Gibraltar, with chapter five beginning where chapter four ends: In 1956, a crucial year for the relationship between the two cities, since it was then that the International Zone of Tangier not only lost its political status when being incorporated into a newly created Kingdom of Morocco but also marked the demographic break with Gibraltar. The sixth chapter introduces the reader to networks between Tangier and Gibraltar. As a result of years of research in the region, I have been able to uncover many personal ties between the two cities, family relationships and networks of friendship, neighborhood and working relationships that transcend religious, ethnic and political boundaries. We will jump across the Strait into the other city, so don’t forget to hold on to your hat, you might get dizzy when you meet street vendors, multi-billionaires, spies, waiters and smugglers, rabbis and tourists, tailors and dawdlers. At the beginning of the New Millennium, both cities experienced new dynamizations. Gibraltar developed into an online gambling paradise and Tangier was purposefully promoted by King Mohammed VI, something that had not happened in previous decades since independence. New companies settled and both cities expanded spatially – Tangier in width, Gibraltar in height and out to sea. Chapter seven will look at the dynamism of both cities. The last chapter, number eight, is largely built on chapters six and seven. Here, I deal with Brexit and its consequences for Gibraltar, as well as Gibraltar’s relationship with Morocco in general and Tangier in particular. Informal networks (chapter six) and structural dynamism of previous years (chapter seven) are fundaments on which Gibraltar can build its future after leaving the EU. Chapter eight, however, does not only deal with the hopeful side of a renewed dense cross-border interde-\n\n13\n\n14\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\npendence, for Brexit has unsettled the community deeply and, in some cases, led to agony. In many respects, the high song of a new future is just a whistling in the woods. One does not know yet; the future is open. How the Corona crisis will affect TanGib cannot be foreseen. What is certain, however, is that in Gibraltar, the interest in reestablishing ties with TanGib is much more vital than on the other side: TanGib’s margins do not depend on Gibraltar, they are oriented more toward the EU and other regions of Morocco, as well as global world trade. Finally, chapter nine deals with two questions: What is the next step with TanGib, and what conclusions can be drawn from the material regarding the theoretical approaches. At this point, I will refrain from suggesting answers to these questions. You better read it yourself. A few remarks on the language used in this book: In Tangier, due to its international character, one often uses different names for one and the same locality. I have tried to reproduce the terms in the local language Darija. This sometimes leads to tricky situations. The external market, for example, is called Soq Barra. The foreign terms Zoco, Soco, Socco, Souk are only used if an informant uses these terms or if they are taken from a text source where the market is called soq barra. It becomes even more complicated with the inner market. Spaniards call it Zoco Chico, for the French, it is the Petit Soco, but for the Tanjawis of today, it is the Soq Dahkel. Again, I generally refer to the native term Soq Dahkel, unless vendors (or authors) use one of the other terms, which are of course retained. Quotations from English have been retained; quotations from other languages have been translated into English. Street names in Tangier were Arabized or Moroccanized after independence. I have tried to mark this in the text where appropriate, for example, when I speak of Avenue Hassan II and notice its former name, Avenue de Alejandria.\n\n1. Myths, rhythms, senses\n\n1.1.\n\nGeography and power\n\nTalking about myths, the most famous is probably the ancient legend of the Pillars of Hercules, which “border the Strait of Gibraltar (lat. Gaditanum Fretum), the most famous being the Rock of Gibraltar (lat. Calpe) in the south of the Iberian Peninsula and the mountain Jebel Musa in Morocco,” 1 east of Tangier. “According to the Greek poet Pindar, Heracles placed the inscription ‘No further’ at the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea to mark the end of the world.”2 This was the Mediterranean world of the Phoenicians, whose graves are located both in Tangier and on the Iberian side. A monument commemorates one of the columns in Gibraltar. The Mayor of Tangier wanted to erect the other column in his city in 2017 but, in doing so, he received a fatwa (Zamane Online 2019). The myth about the origin of the famous Berber macaques of Gibraltar is also known outside the region: it is said they came from the opposite Jebel Musa through an underground tunnel with dry feet to the partner rock. Myths, symbols and maps are parts of the performative discourse in which agents try to define social worlds and make their view of it appear as a natural perspective, whereby opposing perspectives often experience a denaturalization (Bourdieu 1991). This applies both to the Spanish perspective on Gibraltar and to the perspective of Gibraltarian nationalists. For Spain, Gibraltar is already geographically a ‘natural’ part of Spanish territory. This argumentation from the time of fascist caudillo Francisco Franco is still relevant today in Spain’s political discourse. The political narrative that dominates in Gibraltar, in turn, also draws on geology. The following argument is made in the video The Gibraltar Story – Jurassic Rock, produced by Knightsfield Ltd. in 1994, which we will read about later and can be purchased in Gibraltar’s souvenir shops and in the Gibraltar Museum: In the Jurassic period of the Earth’s age, Europe was separated from Africa by the Thetysocean. The mortal remains of tiny creatures became limestone. ‘This\n\n1 2\n\nWikipedia (n.d.b.) Ibid.\n\n16\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nIllustration 3 (left) : El Boughaz; Illustration 4 (right) : Limestone Gibraltar\n\nlimestone lay about 100 kilometers West of where Gibraltar is today.’ The shifting of the Earth’s plates 16 or 20 million years ago caused Africa to drift towards Europe, leading to the formation of the Alps, the Sierra Nevada and the Pyrenees. ‘Our limestone plate drifted West and attached itself to the other rock.’ The video shows a red African continent moving West, a green Iberian Peninsula that rests within itself, and a white limestone in the outline of Gibraltar that breaks away from North Africa and moves northward toward the Iberian Peninsula, where it eventually docks. So, different nationalists use geology to substantiate their claims. However, as has already been mentioned, the references to geology, topography and myths around the two places and the ‘alleyway’ in between – as the Arabs call the Strait – are not the only ones.\n\n1.2.\n\nRhythm and Senses\n\nIt is often said that there is a Mediterranean rhythm of life. What is meant by this? Does the Mediterranean have a common rhythm that makes Mediterranean places resemble each other and, at the same time, distinguishes them from places in other regions? Does a typical Mediterranean rhythm exist at all? Instinctively, when we ask this question, most Europeans invoke images and experiences they had as travelers in the countries of the Mediterranean region: Rhythms of movement of people, things, stars, sounds, winds and waves. But how do we approach this question scientifically? How can we say something comprehensible and find\n\n1. Myths, rhythms, senses\n\nout about it? In their rhythm analysis, Lefebvre and Régulier develop a possible approach. Rhythm reunites quantitative aspects and elements, which mark time and distinguish moments in it – and qualitative aspects and elements, which link them together, found the unities and result from them. Rhythm appears as regulated time, governed by rational laws, but in contact with what is least rational in human being: the lived, the carnal, the body. Rational, numerical, quantitative and qualitative rhythms superimpose themselves on the multiple natural rhythms of the body (respiration, the heart, hunger and thirst, etc.), though not without changing them. The bundle of natural rhythms wraps itself in rhythms of social or mental function. (Lefebvre/Régulier 2004: 8-9) Lefebvre and Régulier describe the Mediterranean city as a stage, as a “theatrical city” (Ibid: 96), the concept of the person does not go back to the Mediterranean concept of the mask (lat. persona) without reason. But for whom is this city a stage? American ethnologist David Schneider, for example, compared every culture with a theatrical stage on which the individual moves. Norms serve as script instructions for the players (cf. Keesing 1981; Ortner 1984), and the front-stage–backstage analogy comes from Erving Goffman’s (1963) stigma analysis, which, in his case, also does not seem to be culture-specific. But what distinguishes the stage of the Mediterranean city from that of other cultures? The theatrical aspect is considered an expression of falsity in German Protestantism, in which inside and outside are supposed to fall into one, which is why the inside has to be carried to the outside in order to be identical. Foucault recognizes it as a central characteristic of modernity in such an emphasis on inner truth through confessional techniques. From this perspective, the theory of Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset, who describes the character of Andalusians as narcissistic and inclined towards theatrical selfstaging, could be described as premodern3 . But to whom is the theatricalization directed? For the ethnologists who have worked on Andalusian masculinity, the other men in the context of the bar are the audience for such self-dramatization (Ingham 1964: 97; Aramoni 1972; Giraldo 1972; Gilmore/Gilmore 1978; Brandes 1981: 217; Driessen 1983; Santamaría 1985; Gilmore 1986: 126, 1987: 129f; Corbin/Corbin 1988: 151f). But who judges whether it is a theater, something staged? For whom is the theater a vain game and for whom is it an unreflected matter of course? Lefebvre and Régulier claim that tourism enhances the stage-like nature of the Mediterranean rhythm of cities: “[T]ourism is added to the traditional and customary use of space and time, of monumentality and rhythms ‘of the other’ without\n\n3\n\n“The Andalusian has a vegetable sense of existence and lives with preference in his skin” (Zambrano/Ortega y Gasset 1984: 243).\n\n17\n\n18\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nmaking it disappear” (2004: 97f). But if this is so, then the stagecraft must have been there before. Lefebvre and Régulier do not present findings in this regard, but that is precisely what would be exciting: Wasn’t life in premodern Northern Europe just as public and close to the senses as life in the Mediterranean?4 In any case, the polished cleansing of the ambivalent, the face, the physical contact, the loud conversation, the body odor in modern public space, all point to this. Above all, and this would be of particular interest to the ethnologist, do the inhabitants of the cities even notice these rhythms? And do they perceive them as translocal, i.e. as Mediterranean? If so, what do they mean to them? It is telling that Lefebvre and Régulier have an unspecified “enigmatic individual” roaming the Mediterranean city as rhythm analysts, as if he were Walter Benjamin’s flaneur: It is thus that we can try and draw the portrait of an enigmatic individual who strolls with his thoughts and his emotions, his impressions and his wonder, through the streets of large Mediterranean towns, and whom we shall call the ‘rhythmanalyst’. More sensitive to times than to spaces, to moods than to images, to the atmosphere than to particular events, he is strictly speaking neither psychologist, nor sociologist, nor anthropologist, nor economist; however he borders on each of these fields in turn and is able to draw on the instruments that the specialists use. He therefore adopts a transdisciplinary approach in relation to these different sciences. He is always ‘listening out’, but he does not only hear words, discourses, noises and sounds; he is capable of listening to a house, a street, a town as one listens to a symphony, an opera. Of course, he seeks to know how this music is composed, who plays it and for whom. (Lefebvre/Régulier 2004: 87) It can be assumed that the enigmatic individual is neither a local fishwife nor a hotel employee or schoolchild but a stranger from outside, a traveler, a tourist, an artist or a scientist. References to the orientalist discourse on the South are obvious. As an ethnologist, I can approach this primarily through field research based on participatory observation. Let us look at local experiences in Tangier and Gibraltar. It is the fact that the other side can be seen that strengthens a longing for the other. Soor el Maâgazine and Café Hafa in Tangier are not the only places in the region where the other is so incredibly close: From here you can see Spain and\n\n4\n\n“The entire process of modernisation is aimed at creating a sensual distance and individualising the individual: To muffle noise and minimise shouting in the streets; to whitewash natural odors with artificial ones and thereby standardise them; to regulate looks and gestures; to criminalise touch; to unify the taste inherent in food through industrial mass products.” (Cf. Haller 2007: 175ff, translated by the author.)\n\n1. Myths, rhythms, senses\n\nIllustration 5: View from Dar Baroud (Tangier) across the Strait\n\nGibraltar, at night and on a clear day, you can even see the headlights of the cars on the other side. Here too, a common ground between Tanjawis and Gibraltarians comes to the fore: When the border between Gibraltar and Spain was closed, Gibraltarians were enclosed in an area of 6.8 square kilometers near the Spanish town of La Línea within sight and hearing distance of their friends and relatives. ‘I was born a few years before the closure of the border between Spain and Gibraltar [1969-1982/85],’ says Gibraltarian ethnologist Andrew Canessa. ‘My entire childhood and youth was limited to 6.8 km, and I was not allowed to travel in Spain for the first time until I was 16 or 17 years old. I did not cross the border to go to La Línea, but went to Madrid via London. I could practically see Spain from my nursery – and yet it was beyond my reach – it was very strange.’ (Bayerischer Rundfunk 2018) It was similar for the inhabitants of La Línea (Linenses) between 1969 and 1982, perhaps even a little more painful because the inaccessible Rock of Gibraltar sat before their faces like a huge monster. We are dealing with socially closely connected societies on the Strait that cannot escape the gaze of the other. Access to visible space has also changed for Tanjawis: While before 1991, they could cross over to Europe without a visa, today, they can only do so under difficult conditions.\n\n19\n\n20\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nIllustration 6: Closed border between Gibraltar and La Línea\n\nGibraltarians have been able to travel directly to Spain again since 1982, but even here, the conditions are still unpredictable, as border controls can sometimes take several hours. Thus, the three cities share the experience of people not being able to move freely in the immediate and visible vicinity but at different times.5 Another approach to rhythm research is provided by ethnomusicologist Steven Feld (1984), who measures the world and its cultures acoustically. He has dedicated an entire research life to the question of what sound reveals about our world. Or, to put it another way: how human beings and the natural and technical sounds of the world they live in influence each other. [...] He listens to the people [the Kaluli of New Guinea] and realizes that they use the sounds of the rainforest to orient themselves in time and space. Thus, the Kaluli compose songs by singing at and with watercourses. The splashing gives the rhythm and the musical intervals. The lyrics of the songs in turn describe places along streams and forest paths: Water music as a map. The songs of the jungle birds also serve as spatial orientation - and act as an ecological clock. The sounds of birds set the pace for many seasonal and everyday activities. (Feld 1984: 394ff, cit. in Pyritz 2019) Questions that can be applied to the two cities concern the influence of waves, wind, weather, the cries of seagulls and other soundscapes related to art, performance, habitus and rhythm. Are there commonalities? Were there similarities in the past? 5\n\nBeyond the view across the Strait, a visual presence of both cities on the respective other side has been evident at least since 1910. Gibraltarian postcard photographer Benzaquén owned a branch in Tangier and produced images of both cities. Cf. Chipulina (2016).\n\n1. Myths, rhythms, senses\n\nFor “the soundscape of a place can [...] also serve as an indicator of upheavals and disturbances” (Pyritz 2019): In Tangier today – as far as religious expression is concerned – you no longer hear the chimes of the churches or the chants in the synagogues but only the calls to prayer of the muezzin. From time to time, one also hears the music of Sufi groups like Ḥamādša, which, since about 2015, have been able to move increasingly in public space again, after they were previously not able to do so due to Salafi threats. In some places, an acoustic cultural battle is taking place, such as at the Soq Barra, where both the Sidi Bouabid mosque and the Cinema Rif art house are located, the entrance to the medina and tourist venues. Restaurant Art y Gourmet at Soq Barra: The muezzin of the mosque calls for prayer and on the roof terrace of the noble restaurant for tourists and local intellectuals sings Judy Garland Somewhere over the Rainbow. Sometimes a boy pushes a cart with prayer CDs across the square, which he loudly fills with the same recordings.6 Today you no longer hear the foghorns of the ships in the harbor, which is subject to so many film shots7 . Nor can the noisy bustle of the port of Tangier, of which Andersen (1863a, 1863b), Lenz (1884) and Savory (1903) gave testimony, be observed in this way any longer. In any case, it is already evident that the ferries between Gibraltar/Tarifa and Tangier are dominated by soundscapes that cannot be assigned to either side but have their own rhythm: The chugging of the engines, the sounds of the wind and sea currents, the strangely muffled sounds that the passengers make. Small, short conversations, no loud roaring like in Tangier, hardly any laughter and only strained silence before crossing over into the other world. When I fly over from Tangier to the other side, to Europe, one of my guarantors says that I am now, like Alice, going behind the other side of the mirror again. One can transfer Feld’s findings to other senses. For it is not only about the sense of hearing and the sense of sight, the other senses are also formative in this corner of the world. You smell the same sea salt in the air, taste the same spices on your tongue and feel the same winds on your skin: The warm levanter (the Chergui in Tangier) from the east and northeast, the cooler Poniente (Moroccan: Gharbi) from the Atlantic west. People are exposed to the same atmospheric pressure, common weather conditions, such as the great hailstorm of April 14, 2020, and you feel the same humid cold in your bones. Annette Tunbridge, pharmacist and political activist from Gibraltar, points to such common realities: When the wind comes from one direction, Gibraltarians and Tanjawis know exactly which door they have to close to prevent it from slamming shut. Women also know exactly when they should not be styled at the hairdresser’s if the weather is such\n\n6 7\n\nField research diary Tangier, July 17, 2013. The soundscapes of Gibraltar and Tangier still need to be explored in more detail.\n\n21\n\n22\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nthat every hairstyle is immediately destroyed. You just know that. If there is a strong wind, the connection with the ferries is interrupted, which then cannot drive. And if the weather permits, they can see each other clearly. It’s the same on both sides, we have similarities that show up in practical handling.8 And Estrella Abudarham can hardly find words for the transboughaz commonality: Tangier gives her good vibrations. I ask her to be more specific. She does not know how to explain it. I ask if it is the weather, which is similar to Gibraltar, or the air or the light. She says, no, it is not that [...] it is rather an emotional closeness. She would feel at home there, even if she then talked to people and realized that she was British after all. She mentions her mother, who lived in Tangier for a while.9 Two other sensual similarities, which will not be discussed in detail here but which underpin the idea of a common cultural area, are music10 and local cuisine.11\n\n1.3.\n\nOn the sea: Boughaz – Straits – Estrecho\n\nDuring the research sabbatical in WS 2019/2020, I devoted myself to the relationship between the two places, or rather, the entanglements of TanGib. I could not only rely on my field material collected previously in Gibraltar and Tangier or on the evaluation of chat forums, newspapers and magazines but also on field trips to both localities since the decision for a Brexit in 2016. Several research stays in 2019 and 2020 especially broadened my knowledge.\n\n8 9 10\n\n11\n\nField research diary TanGib, April 1, 2019. Field research diary TanGib, March 5, 2020. Singer Pepe Caserni (Insight Magazine, October 2001), for example, performed at the Inter Police Ball. The band “The Terriers were invited to perform their first ever concert in Tangier. Some members of the band and the major part of the instruments, were transported by boat (the Mons Calpe), while Sergio Olivera and I had to fly over to Tangier. It was the first time we had ever flown – we had nightmares during the flight from Gibraltar to Tangier!” (Insight Magazine, September 2001). Gibraltarian artists, such as Pepe Palmero (Insight Magazine, November 2003) and Maleni King (Insight Magazine, December 2001), performed not only in Tangier but also in La Línea. The entertainers John Charvetto and Felipe Rodriguez performed not only in Gibraltar but also on Radio Algeciras, Radio La Línea and Radio Tangier (The Gibraltar Chronicle, May 10, 1957). The Gibraltarian Bill Sanguinetti was a comedian and actor and worked for the International Administration of Tangier (Vaidon 1977: 271). These artistic connections no longer exist today. The Gibraltarian national dish Calentita is still sold by street vendors in Tangier, also in many other cities of the Mediterranean Sea, for example, in Malta (where it is called paloma), in Western Algeria (there they say karane) or in Italy (where it is called farinata). https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gibraltarian_cuisine.\n\n1. Myths, rhythms, senses\n\nIllustration 7: Proyects of fixed railway connections\n\nWhat could be more obvious than to start an approach to the Strait with descriptions of the journey from Gibraltar to Tangier? In theory, there are other possibilities than crossing the Strait by ship: By plane, bridge or tunnel. The former has been used many times in the history of the Strait, the latter has been considered time and again; economist Steffen Wippel (2000) has described the projects in this regard. Time and again, they have inspired fantasies of architects, politicians, economists and artists. None of these approaches to realizing a lieu fixe, however, has been able to assert itself so far. Thus, crossings by means of ships or airplanes remain.12 If you traveled from Gibraltar to Tangier before 1860, you had to take the feluccas. These had cabins, but these probably did not deserve their name. A traveler wrote in 1857: “There was not in it one single article of furniture of any kind, except a few narrow, thin mattresses, which were spread out in the floor, without sheets, pillows or blankets (Fort 1857: 48ff).” Passengers often preferred to remain on deck during the crossing, which could last between 12 and 30 hours (Vaidon 1977: 71). Let us look at reports of those who took on this crossing. Unfortunately, these are only reports from people who are not from the region itself – neither from Tangier nor from Gibraltar, Ceuta, Tarifa or Algeciras – but rather reports from strangers from the north, whose accounts are perhaps more indicative of the differences, especially when they hope to find in Tangier a promise they think they will not find in Europe. But do they also notice any similarities?\n\n12\n\nFor flight connections, see chapter 7.\n\n23\n\n24\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nThe English officers returned to Gibraltar in an open boat. Such a journey across this Strait can sometimes be very dangerous. Once two English officers of the evening left Tangier for Cadiz with good winds, where they planned to arrive the following morning. In the night, however, a violent storm broke out, and the boat was considered lost. [...] It was a cloudburst which fell in the Strait between Tarifa and Tangier in the form of a thick and large column on which a thick wave of great circumference seemed to rest [...] That water column seemed to me to be like a pillar on which the vault of heaven rested. The water seemed to fall with such force that it could have crushed a ship, and the sea around it was in violent motion. The weather was beautiful, by the way. A rainbow seemed to surround the column, but after a few minutes it faded and disappeared, write Swedish traveler Olof Agrell and British doctor William Lempriere (1798: 306-307). Spanish explorer Domingo Badía y Leblich (pseudonym: Ali Bey) describes the arrival in the port of Tangier as a dream and an entry into an absolutely new world, which is as different from Gibraltar as France is from China, as if you were on another planet (Bey 1814: 3). American author G. Fort (1859: 64) was positively surprised by Tangier when he arrived there from Gibraltar: He thought the city was “cheerful and bright.” Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen arrived in Tangier by ship from Gibraltar on November 2, 1862, where he remained as a guest of Sir John Drummond Hay in Villa Ravensrock13 until his departure on November 9th . He writes about the crossing: The crew aboard the steamer was all Moors. The ship was one of the very small ones and leaned heavily on the moving sea; we sailed across the bay to Algeciras and then along the Spanish coast, which was naked and rocky, to Tarifa. Black, dark stone - sea surf breaks over us. Europe’s entire southern tip is a wild mountainous region, burnt and deserted; the city of Tarifa hid behind naked black boulders; only an old, grey-black lighthouse stood out, amidst screaming birds. Africa, which we headed for from Tarifa, towards Tangier, lay smiling and fertile before us. Behind Ceuta, the country rose enormously, with three mountain ranges in a row, one higher than the other, and one of them as jagged as Montserrat near Barcelona; but now, as the coast stretches towards Tangier, from the Strait to the\n\n13\n\n“The room you had given me had the most beautiful view; to the right, over the garden and the green coast, behind the mandarins, one could see the high, blazing mountains of Ceuta and beyond the open Strait towards the Mediterranean Sea, where sailing ships and steamers came and went. Shortly before, from the cliffs of Gibraltar, the Spanish coastal country laid the entire wild coast with Tarifa, Trafalgar Bay and the mountains towards Cadiz. The Atlantic Ocean stretched Westward in its infinity.” (Andersen 1863b)\n\n1. Myths, rhythms, senses\n\nAtlantic, it becomes flatter and greener, like the hills on Själland’s North coast. Now, with white walls, flat-roofed houses and above them a lime-white fortress, Tangier. Behind the town there seemed to be a small glimpse of the desert, vast yellow sand, over which a chain of loaded camels moves. There is no harbour, no protection against the rolling of the sea, even the long, strong breakwater was destroyed by the Europeans when they left their possessions in Tangier. The steamer stopped quite far out and dropped anchor. A few boats with halfnaked, sunburned Moors [...] came towards us, screaming and waving they entered the stairs of the ship. (Andersen 1863b) In 1879, Gibraltar was connected daily (except Fridays) with Tangier by three small ships, Hercules, Lion Belge and Jakal, writes Austrian Africa researcher Oskar Lenz (1884: 7ff). He focuses decidedly on the passage itself. The ships sometimes leave later because the captains make a “little business” of serving sailing ships as barges. When the weather is bad, the boats are “thrown around,” so that one thinks “it must burst apart at any moment.” The waves burst in through the “damaged” cabin windows, where they evenly drench the “effects of the passengers.” Jewish travelers “moan loudly,” Arabs “shout resignedly Allah Kebir” and the Europeans are in an “indescribable state of paralysis.” The view of Tangier from the ship seems “quite friendly,” Lenz describes landscape and city benevolently. Some hotels are quite bearable and the city has a functioning street-cleaning system. Nowhere, however, does he explicitly compare the two cities. Spanish Arabist Antonio Almagro Cárdenas imagines himself still in Spain during his visit in 1881, Tangier appears to him like the Albaicín quarter of Granada (López García 2012: 4). Charles Augustus Stoddard (1892: 210), editor of the New York Observer, said that one got into “another sphere” when one crossed the Strait of Gibraltar. Italian writer De Amicis writes about the passage, but not so much about the thoughts and feelings that overwhelm him during the passage as about his observation of the passengers: The more noticeable on the outward trip from Gibraltar. Here still ferments the noisy, feverish, brilliant life of a European city, and the traveller, from whatever quarter of Europe he may hail, yet feels himself at home in numberless familiar customs and aspects of life. Three hours later, and the very name of our Continent sounds strange; Christian signifies enemy, and our civilization is unknown, or feared, or scoffed at. Everything, from the very foundations of society to the most trifling details of private life, is metamorphosed, and all indication of the close proximity of Europe has completely disappeared. We suddenly find ourselves in an unknown land, without ties of any kind, and with everything to learn. To be sure the European coast is still visible from the shore, but in our hearts there is\n\n25\n\n26\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\na consciousness of immeasurable distance, as though that narrow strip of water were an ocean, those blue, distant hills a delusion. (De Amicis 1897: 3–4).\n\nIllustration 8: Travels of Oscar Lenz\n\n“Like many newcomers, [Frech diplomat Maximilien de la] Martinière must have been unable to distinguish this Jewish and Moorish archetype from Andalusians who made the journey for work or trade. They would have a slight difference in appearance - even dress - and would tend to communicate in the lingua franca, a mixture of Spanish, Arabic and Riffian that they spoke effortlessly. In any case, the chaos of his arrival would quickly upset the Frenchman's arrogant gaze. The ferry dropped anchor very close to the main pier, from where a flotilla of boats full of Moroccans \"descendants of ancient pirates\" approached, grabbing the ladders to \"climb, agile as monkeys, and invade the deck.” (Pack 2015: 54) An English woman, Isabel Savory, reports at the turn of the century: About six weeks before 1902 was due, Rose A. Bainbridge and myself left behind us the last outpost of England – Gibraltar – with its cluster of civilization round the bottom of the great Rock. Four hours brought us across the Straits; and seen from the deck of the dirty little Gibel Musa, on to which we had changed from a S. & O. at Gibraltar, Morocco shaped itself into a rugged country, ridge behind ridge of low hills and jagged mountains cutting the sky-line. A long white sand-bank lying back\n\n1. Myths, rhythms, senses\n\nin a bay on the African shore, broken at one end by irregular vegetation, gradually developed upon its slopes a yellowish-white, fantastic city, which resolved itself into Tangier. Landing at Tangier among vociferating Moors has been described often enough, and needs no further enlargement. (Savory 1903) French traveler Du Taillis (1905) describes Gibraltar and Tangier as antitheses. “All here laid out, prepared in the barrenness of the rock for the futile work of battle. And there, on this virgin and already fertile soil, the golden sheaves and green meadows inviting to peaceful labour the energies of our century and our race.” But one commonality: Gibraltar is not Europa and Tangier is not Africa. “Gibraltar and Tangier is the Strait, the road of the worlds. Only a few miles away, they are the two points on the globe that are equally well placed to dominate the universe” (Du Taillis 1905: 122). Finally, Mark Twain writes “[W]e have had enough of Spain and Gibraltar for the present. Tangier is the spot we have been looking for all the time. […] We wanted something thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign [...] And lo! In Tangier we have found it. […] Tangier is a foreign land if ever there was one” (Twain 1920: 64). In addition to the crossing itself, the question of the first impression of Tangier (Cit. Jebrouni 2019) is less important than the comparison that the travelers make with Gibraltar. Ali Bey, Fort, Andersen, Stoddard, Du Taillis and Twain focus on Tangier and Gibraltar (Europe), only Lenz and de Amicis write about the passage itself. It seems as if the passage itself recedes behind the need to describe the other as different. In comparing here and there, orientalist fantasies of Europeans who do not come from the region become manifest: Ali Bey, Fort, Andersen, Lenz, Stoddard, de Amicis, Du Taillis, Twain ... one could add the names of painters and writers, the beat generation, the hippies and also one or the other researcher. For most travelers quoted here, both cities represent antitheses (Stoddard), foreign (Ali Bey, Twain) or unknown (de Amicis) countries.14 Mainly in the 19th century, Moroccan visitors to Europe were overwhelmed again and again by the technological development of the Europeans. If you be14\n\nWe find similar things for Spanish travelers. While Ramón Martínez García compares the abysmal differences between Tangier and his country: “At a distance of twenty kilometres there is a difference of twenty centuries” (Martínez García 1989: 25), other travelers speak of a Spanish Tangier. Until the beginning of the 20th century, in 1903, Vicente Vera tells the story of his journey under the title of the Spanish Tangier and describes the work that Spaniards did in the city. What prevails is the value of what is written. The ambitious desire to legitimize the Spanish presence in Tangier is based on mere number games. Pío Baroja, the writer of the ’98 generation who traveled to Tangier in 1903 as a journalist for El Globo, sees that the majority of the population speaks Spanish after Arabic, “the Spanish are the most influential, although they are the ones with less authority over French and other European powers” (Baroja, 1989) cit. in. Jebrouni 2019, pg. 50. Translation by the author.\n\n27\n\n28\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nIllustration 9: Ferry between Tarifa and Tangier 2013\n\nlieve Ghouirgate, then Tangier was a transition area for Moroccans, because “the technical and technological progress of Europe can already be felt in Tangier on Moroccan soil. Tangier is already a different world, a strange and wonderful ‘elsewhere’” (Ghouirgate 1994: 157). Lenz and Almagro Cárdenas describe Tangier as not so different, and de Taillis is the only one who points out that Tangier is neither African nor Gibraltar European. Since he does not explain what that “neither – nor” would consist of, it is open whether he sees two different transition zones or even a common transition zone. My own first crossing15 in February 2013 was not via Gibraltar (there was no direct ferry connection at that time) but via Tarifa. However, my diary notes something connecting between Tangier and Gibraltar: On the ferry [...] just a handful of guests, maybe 20 Moroccans and 5 Europeans, thus, almost deserted across the Strait of Gibraltar, a truly lonely journey on this mythical route. We had to queue up at the counter, behind which an official sat in a thickly lined coat, stamped the passports and took entry forms. The ferry had probably been bought from a Greek company or at least it chugged in the Aegean earlier: Behind the official no map of the Strait but of the Aegean Sea. Everywhere also inscriptions in Greek. Especially apart: A complaint box with inscriptions in\n\n15\n\nPreviously, I had entered Morocco by ferry from Algeciras via Ceuta or by plane.\n\n1. Myths, rhythms, senses\n\nthis language, English, French and German. In the queue behind me, a loudly telephoning young woman with an adventurous language: She jumped back and forth in her sentence between deepest Andalusian and Arabic, so perfect and normal that I could not guess where she probably came from. She swerved between English and Spanish, much like the Yanitos do, but without their accent.16 Three weeks later came the second crossing, also via Tarifa. Gibraltar is not in my head, but the passage itself is in my bowels: On the ferry of the FRS line. Rarely have I sat in such uncomfortable seats. The ship looks more modern than the Greek island hopper of the other company that brought me to Tangier 3 weeks ago. We are still lying in the harbor – I drove my car onto the ferry and they told me to stop on a sloping ramp, although there was still space in front of me. Strange. Then I immediately stood at the entry queue, they stamped my passport without any problems and put down my entry form, on which I indicated as destination Tangier, Hotel El Minzah and as the reason for my journey “tourism,” without paying attention to it. Now I am sitting on the bobbing barge in the harbor, outside it is raining harder again and already now it is swaying heavily. I will probably not be able to write much longer, nausea is already announcing itself. At the neighboring table, an older Moroccan sets his watch back one hour. So now it’s off to the other world, and when I get out of the car belly of the ferry and into the passenger deck, I have this feeling: Now it’s getting serious. Oh dear! Horizons blur. I’m not relaxed at all: Hopefully, the crossing goes well and the entry; hopefully, there is internet in the apartment; hopefully, it’s not too cold [...]. Hopefully, I can find something to eat; hopefully, I dare to go by car; hopefully, hopefully, hopefully [...] My goodness, how can one be so worried. Everything’s going to be fine. It’s chugging out of the belly of the ship and it’s 5:05. Are we leaving slowly? Still in port, and I feel faint. Nice words are hard to find there. The announcements are hard to understand or not at all. Only the word “pleasant journey” gets through to me. The ship is turning in the harbor basin and I have to change my position. Otherwise I’ll go backwards! Now once again I have to change my position. I hear Spanish and French all around me. The Moroccans are quiet. Still in the harbor, how long does the damn thing keep on turning (5:15 pm)? Now 5:17 pm, we drive out of the basin into the restless Strait of Gibraltar. It is swaying quite a bit. I feel sick.”17 Further remarks about the Strait, Gibraltar, Tangier and the crossing fall victim to seasickness.\n\n16 17\n\nField research diary Tangier, February 14, 2013.

Thoughts are rooted in what we see, not in our stomachs. In Gibraltar, I make a note: I walk up to the top floor of the university building where a café is located. From there you should have a wonderful view over the Strait. And indeed: It is breathtaking. Opposite Jebel Musa, then Algeciras, then the bay and The Rock. It almost makes me howl. It’s so beautiful here. The weather is great too.18 On the other side of the Strait, Café Makina is the place where my mind opened up during my research. The two oceans, the coast, Spain and Gibraltar opposite ... Yes, El Boughaz opens the senses. That is peace.\n\nIllustration 10: Cafe Makina, 2018\n\nBefore Café Makina, in the course of the urbanistic redesign of Tangier, fell to the modernist sandblasting, so to speak, in order to commodify the cultural heritage of the city, I could let my thoughts fly there. But what is this, cultural heritage? We had organized a conference on the subject (“Patrimoine, tourisme et changements politiques dans la région MENA”)19 at the Hotel El Minzah on February 15 and 16, 2015. There, we no longer understood Heritage as a set of objects, artifacts or customs that can be easily collected and classified in a purely empirical sense. Rather, we understood 18 19\n\nField research diary TanGib, April 2, 2019. https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/archaelogie/mam/content/programm_-_tagung__marokko.pdf.\n\n1. Myths, rhythms, senses\n\nHeritage – with Hall (2005: 25, cit. in Nic Craith 2007: 6) – as a discursive practice by which a community creates its own kind of collective social memory.20 In contrast to Heritage, Tradition refers to lived collective practices. Or as Ullrich Kockel (2007) puts it: Heritage begins when a cultural tradition has ended. Café Makina was then for me a living cultural tradition in a niche that – In my view – had been forgotten and overlooked by neoliberal modernization. I must admit that a good ethnologist would have asked what the visitors thought about the changes of the Makina ... I did not do that. For me, I needed the Makina, an enclave beyond the reach of the market, where one could play tabla in peace and with a little money, watch football and escape the demands of research. Faded photographs of the old Tangier and wooden boats on consoles hang in the main room. The tea costs 5 Dirham. The name of the café comes from the small tables with round milled holes in which the hot glasses could be perfectly placed. Small tables on which Singer sewing machines used to stand. So it was: Heritage? Old and young men among themselves – and now? Café Makina had become a magical and meditative place for me, so I often came here to take walks and excursions into the city. This was promised to me by the experiences that many found in the much better known Café Hafa in Mershan. This was founded in 1921, made famous by the writer Paul Bowles, by Mick Jagger and the inevitable German hippie icon Uschi Obermaier – Hafa can be found in every travel guide. Today, young middle-class people sit on its beautiful terraces with breathtaking views over the Strait of Gibraltar. Much has been written about Café Hafa, expat writers have immortalized the café and the rock upon which it is built, as mythical places of nostalgia where you can let your mind go with a glass of mint tea and a Kif pipe. Moroccans themselves especially, who are only 14 kilometers from the promised land, experience their burning desire here: One is within reach of the longed-for other side (but only nearby), which remains inaccessible. In the years around 2016, Café Makina was renovated in the course of exposing the city walls and its temporary terraces were removed. However, the audience has not changed. So: Tradition and Heritage? Now let us look at a difference in the rhythms.\n\n1.4.\n\nTime\n\nTangier and Gibraltar are now subject to different time regimes that structure the daily rhythm. In Gibraltar, the European linear time regime prevails, whereas in Morocco, different time concepts coexist side by side (Abu-Shams/Gonzales 20\n\nOne example is the distancing of Jews from Tangier in Israel from the other Jews of Morocco (Moreno 2012).\n\n31\n\n32\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nVasquez 2014: 36). The most obvious difference is that European time is more oriented towards the visibility of the clock. Moroccan time, on the other hand, is mainly structured by the audible fivefold call to prayer, which structures daily routine and physical practices, such as pausing. But of course, Tangier is also partly subject to the time regime of the clock and has been for a long time. Thus, the first clock in Morocco was installed in the Catholic Church Purísima Concepción in Calle Siaghin on January 6, 1894 (Marco 1913: 18).21 Anselmo Ravella was the only Christian who had been allowed to enter the Great Mosque. In 1938, the mosque officials were looking for a trustworthy Muslim watchmaker who could coordinate the clocks in the mosque. But they found none. Opposite the mosque watchmaker Ravella worked in his shop, having had been based in Tangier for already 40 years. Since the watches were too big to bring into his shop and he, as a Christian, was not allowed to enter the floor of the mosque, four strong Muslims carried him on a chair into the mosque. From this chair he repaired the clocks. Because this was too impractical in the long run, he was later granted the right to enter the mosque barefoot. (Martínez Antonio 2010–2011: 290) Despite the orientation towards linear time, the practice of dealing with time is highly problematic in both cities in some contexts. In Tangier, for example, many people are excited about the question of when, where and in what way one could cross the border into Europe. It is a subcutaneous nervousness that rests dormant in many – and sometimes bursts out. In Gibraltar, too, there is a subliminal nervousness that is connected with the border. But in Gibraltar, it is the crossing of the border into Spain. As this is an old problem and in Gibraltar you can live well – you do not necessarily have to cross to the other side. Spain is not a hope for Gibraltarians, at best a possibility, but mostly a threat: One has to deal with the other side in some pragmatic way. It is impossible, for example, to estimate when the land border with Spain would be open or how long it would take to cross it. Psychologically stressful is especially the fact that the measures are not always in force and it cannot be estimated by the individual when they will be applied. However, there are various indications that the measures are being reinforced at weekends, during political negotiations between the UK and Spain and in the month leading up to elections in Gibraltar, as well as on the day after the celebration of Gibraltar National Day. In the weeks leading up to the Feria de La Línea (Autumn Festival of La Línea), border harassment is unlikely. This is the case every year, explains Mary-Clare Russo (*1955), “so that we can go back over there and spend our money. And every year, after the Feria ends, the harassment is reinstated” (Haller 2000a: 75). In Tangier, however, the other side is not just a place of pragmatic and problematic everyday planning but a land of hope for the future. 21\n\nC. Marco: Historia de la comisión de higiene, pg. 18.\n\n1. Myths, rhythms, senses\n\nSpace also organizes the daily rhythm. Gibraltar is a small, hardly growing community, which at the time of my field research in the 1990s, extended significantly along a single artery – Main Street down to the southern tip, to Europa Point. Here, Gibraltarians often meet several times a day. For one specific strategy, a native term has even been coined: “the Hi-Bye Syndrome.” On Main Street, distance is created by missing the street with a quick foot and heading purposefully towards the destination, without exchanging with acquaintances except for the ritual avoidance greeting. If you greet an acquaintance with “Hi,” you will receive a “Bye” from him. Sometimes you greet with a simple “Bye.” (Ibid.: 122) Gibraltar also has a few side streets like Irish Town or Line Wall Road, which stretch from north to south. If one wanted to escape the narrow space, one had to go to Spain. But today, due to the land reclamation in the former harbor area, new quarters have been added. Tangier, on the other hand, is a city that is constantly expanding toward the south and east. There is a symbolic boulevard in the city center but no artery that dominates the traffic, instead there is a high volume of traffic throughout the city. Larger distances than in Gibraltar have to be overcome. Social structure is another factor that influences the rhythm of people’s lives. Gibraltar has long been a military colony, a military or militaroid, at least a British habitus was necessary for civilians to rise socially (ibid.: 157). Today, Gibraltar is a service society with a high density of banks, law firms and offices of the gaming industry. Clothing and habitus are more British, not only because of these trades, but also because most young people have received higher education in Britain since the 1970s. Tangier, on the other hand, experienced an exchange of the majority of its population after Morocco’s independence in 1956. Christians, Jews and many old resident Muslims left the city, which experienced a large influx from the rural hinterlands. I have heard the complaints of the old-established many times about these peasants who did not know how to live in a city; I have also heard the complaints of the newcomers many times about these arrogant lazy people who did not work all day and cheated people. These complaints conceal a central reference to rhythm: An urban Mediterranean art of living (or, turned to the negative: A windy mendacity) is juxtaposed with a rural inland rudeness (turned to the positive: Honest downto-earthness). Mustafa says: “We Tanjawis are like this: We work to have something and then again not because we like to sleep and enjoy the day. These people from the South have changed everything: They come here to earn money and they work a lot, but\n\n33\n\n34\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\ncheaply. They spoil wages and mentality.22 “We have to go slowly, bit by bit. Tanjawis don’t like to work. Once we have money, we spend it in the café. People from the South, on the other hand, only want money, money, money, not quality of life. Tanjawis say: ‘Work? No men do, only the donkeys do. Country donkeys who come here.’”23 Khaled from Essaouira and Abdelladim from Casablanca say: “Tanjawis are lazy and sleep until they fall asleep, while we from the south (= Arobia) work hard.” The24 other day, Zak from Casablanca said, “Tanjawis are racist. They don’t like us from the South because we come here to work, and Tanjawis are all lazy or crooks.”25 Typical for the rhythm of the city, which is perceived by outsiders, especially by Europeans, is the fact that male Tanjawis stay in the café for hours without any obvious reason: They sit and comment, drink tea or coffee and look, observe. Or stare and gaze. But this is what the foreigners experience above all in the Medina and on Boulevard Pasteur, i.e. in certain areas that they rarely leave. At the beginning of my research, I did not know that it was part of the Tanjawis’ self-image to take speed out of the process, to wait and comment and look.26 “What is the first thing that all these men do in the sidewalk cafes, Mohammed asks? They look. And comment. There is a whole science of the gaze, he quotes a French friend who once called it shufology (shuf = look): the culture of the eyes and the gaze; but I also think that this is a good part of my research methods so far: Shufology – the art of looking. In fact, people always looked into your eyes, they looked closely, as if they wanted to see what was inside. Many look closely at who bought what and brought it home in their plastic bags.”27 “At Café Cristina, I tell [an informant] that he and his brother would have no problem getting the Shufology diploma because they are trained gawpers and look up every woman's behind. They laugh.”28 Only a few years later, in 2019, the shuffeurs’ gaze is still directed at women, but less at the people passing by than at their mo-\n\n22 23 24 25 26\n\n27 28\n\nField research diary Tangier, December 10, 2013.

In Gibraltar, people also sit in cafés, and to the visitor from the North, this may seem to be a typical Mediterranean way of life: Staying in pubs, bars and cafés until well into the night and letting the Lord God be a good man. But I made this observation for the first time in 2017, while in my field research records from the 1990s, I find my complaints about the fact that public life in the city dies out at 6 pm, thinned-out street lighting prevails, hardly any pedestrians are visible and pubs – if they were open at all – breathed the flair of the crown glassy gloom of English military pubs. There were hardly any restaurants and cafés in streets and alleys, life was predominantly domestic. This was always explained to me with reference to military tradition: For over 200 years it had not been customary for civilians to be outside after dark (Haller 2000a: 111). That has changed in the meantime – in t times before Corona. Gender is a key factor in distinguishing the rhythms of Tangier and Gibraltar. Tangier is anything but an Arab city where women would be restricted to the domestic sphere – the women of Tangier are well represented in public and have been considered strong and self-confident since ancient times. Men and women are copresent but they are not co-communicative, as is the case in Gibraltar. They do not sit – except in a family environment – in mixed-gender groups at tables in cafés nor do they speak loudly, as is customary in Gibraltar. Men are also less audible in the cafés than their male counterparts in Gibraltar. All this indicates that there are hardly any rhythmic similarities between Gibraltar and Tangier on many sensual levels, which have become habitualized in the bodies. I am tempted to say that this is not merely a different time management but a fundamentally ontological difference. Contemplation and idleness are not wasted in Tangier or Gibraltar but are the meaning and purpose of existence, while work is a mere necessity.\n\n1.5.\n\nUrban planning and architecture\n\nA sensual commonality, which is rooted in the urban planning of Tangier and Gibraltar, is the ascent and descent from the hills to the sea. There is an upper and a lower town in Gibraltar and in Tangier.29 Steep alleys, narrow passages, stairs 29\n\n“[A]round the Mediterranean and irrespective of the country, many towns have been constructed on escarpments that dominate the sea. In these towns, a distinction is drawn between the lower town and the upper town: steps play a very important role. Generally, there is right around the Mediterranean a remarkable architecture of the stairway. A link between spaces, the stairway also ensures a link between times: between the time of architecture (the\n\n35\n\n36\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nand staircases connect up and down; one may assume that this has a similar effect on the handling of narrow space, the posture when carrying bags and containers, the line of sight when walking and on the musculature of the locomotor system. However, there are no reliable findings on this yet. My assumption that the diagnosis “lumbago” would be just as common in Gibraltar as in Tangier was contradicted by the pharmacist Annette Tunbridge, who said that in cold winds there are no more lumbago or back strain in Gibraltar than in warm weather or when there is no wind. But this is exactly what I think I notice in Tangier through the many complaints of my informants. The three Mediterranean cities of my research – Seville, Gibraltar and Tangier – share an urbanistic particularity, the so-called Patios de Vecinos. These patios are residential buildings arranged around a courtyard. They are usually two-storey buildings where poorer sections of society lived, sharing the courtyard and a water pump that supplied the neighborhood. Such patios are, of course, not only urbanistic formations but also special forms of living together.30\n\nIllustration 11 (left): Patio Schott, 1996; Illustration 12 (right): Patio Laredo, 2019\n\nIn Gibraltar, many civilians of all religions lived in such patios, because the land that did not belong to the military was scarce and housing conditions limited. The aim of many Gibraltarians was to escape the narrowness of the patios and\n\n30\n\nhouse, the enclosure) and urban time (the street, the open space, the square and the monuments)” (Lefebvre/Régulier 2004: 97). Press (1979) has masterfully documented one of these Patios de Vecinos in his monograph. For La Línea, see Díaz (2018) and del Manzano Pratts (2019).\n\n1. Myths, rhythms, senses\n\ncontrol by the neighbors as fast as possible. With the exodus of the locals from the patios to their new apartment blocks, which had been built mainly since the 1970s on land that had been wrested from the sea, the patios remained as housing for Moroccan workers. In the 1990s, they were nostalgically elevated to the birthplaces of a Gibraltarian national identity, where Spaniards and British, Maltese and Jews, Sindhis and Portuguese lived together in harmony (Haller 2000b). In Tangier, on the other hand, we find patios mainly in the former poorer Spanish and Jewish neighborhoods, in Brâmil, Jossafat, Hasnona and neighboring areas. Here, too, the patios were places where people of different religions and nationalities – who, however, belonged to the same poorer or lower middle-class – lived peacefully together. Until recently, Moroccan workers lived in the patios of Gibraltar (today, these forms of housing have been gentrified), in Tangier, poorer Muslims still live there today.\n\nIllustration 13: Cafe Gibraltar, Tangier\n\nThe spread of patios as a form of living on both sides of the Strait can be explained as a heritage of the Andalusian-influenced inhabitants. However, the doubling of the names of streets and hotels is worthwhile considering. In Gibraltar, there is a Lovers Lane, in Tangier a Calle de los Enamorados. Both cities have (or had) a Hotel Bristol, a Bar called Hole in the Wall, a Café Roxy and a large natural dune. In Gibraltar one speaks of The Mount, in Tangier as well (or of Jebel Kebir or La Vieille Montagne). In Tangier we find a Café Gibraltar and a British York Castle and in Gibraltar a Tangier’s Take Away and a Moorish Castle. In both cities there is a Royal Yacht Club, in both places horse races were held on the beach and similar hunting parties existed\n\n37\n\n38\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\n(the pig hunt in the Forêt Diplomatique near Tangier and the Royal Calpe Hunt in the hinterland of Gibraltar).31 Gorhams Cave is as important in Gibraltar as the Gruta de Hercules in Tangier. An old town quarter in Tangier’s medina is called Bni Ider; in Gibraltar lived a Jewish family Benider (Benady 1989: 151; Babas/Benargane 2018).32 In Tangier, there was not only the election of a Miss Tangier (Andrè 2003) but also a rosary of female beauty contests, just like in Gibraltar (Haller 2000c). In both Gibraltar and Tangier, architecture is an important marker within the identity discourse. And this changes in both cities. In Gibraltar, for several years now, more and more land has been reclaimed from the sea and built up with highrises, which have a disturbing effect on older inhabitants. On my way to the Yacht Club, which is no longer where it used to be because it has been moved, I meet Connie Rossi, 84-year-old sprightly widow. I say to her that the area looks very different from the 1990s. Connie Rossi says that from the Rock you cannot see the sea for all the high-rises. Later, her best friend Heidi Viñas Coreggio adds that even from below, you cannot see the Rock for all the high-rises.33 In addition, from most houses of the old town one can hardly see the sea and the view to Morocco is, meanwhile, to a large extent, blocked.34\n\nIllustration 14: View from Reclaimed Land onto the Rock of Gibraltar\n\nRock and sea have been the dominant reference points in the Gibraltarian landscape until now when they are being disempowered by the new architecture.\n\n31\n\n32 33 34\n\nSir John Drummond Hay justified the pig-sticking in the Forêt Diplomatique. Sometimes simple soldiers from Gibraltar were sent to Tangier to make the number of participants in the hunt appear more impressive (Finlayson 1992: 44). The family came from Tetuán (Chipulina 2017).

Myths, rhythms, senses\n\nIn Tangier, the influx from Arobia, especially from its rural areas, led to a ruralization of the once cosmopolitan city in the perception of the Tanjawis. This is also reflected in the way the city’s architectural heritage is treated. “These people,” says the local historian Rashid Tafersiti Zarouila, “moved into the old quarters of the medina, but before that they had lived in huts and barracks in the countryside. They have no relationship to the city.”35 Tafersiti Zarouila, who describes himself as a nostalgic and dominates the current book market with nostalgic publications about old Tangier, thus, explains the fact that the old buildings are slowly decaying in many parts. Large parts of the old town, for example, are dominated by European and, even more so, Mediterranean architecture that may seem unusual in other cities in the country: Balconies and windows with grilles or shutters facing the street, stucco and classicist set pieces. However, all this is now threatened not only by the mafia of speculators but also by the careless exploitation of the hicks who have moved in. * * * Back to my place of dreams, not to Café Hafa but to the less hypertrophic Café Makina, which attracted rather undemanding visitors, dock workers and fishermen. I free myself from my tensions and look out over “the alley.” This is what Tanjawis call the Strait of Gibraltar. During my year in Tangier – 2013–14 – my thoughts made my inner hoopoe fly off. Because “within us [...] there is a hoopoe” that reminds us “that the search, whether metaphysical or specific, for a home is our destiny, that we are not at home at all, that we are perhaps only trapped in what we love, and that there is something within us that drives us out – be it into the big, wide and strange world or into higher spheres: But inside us is a hoopoe.” (Weidner 2018: 33) The importance of the hoopoe is deeply rooted in the popular beliefs, traditional medicine and magic of Morocco (Chimenti 1950). A whole drawer with fascinating contents was opened for me in a herbal pharmacy. The employee Bachir Lahsini explained to me that they do not use parts of the bird as medicine, but as magical substances: The bellows themselves are worth almost nothing. In a way, it is given as a bonus for the really important component, the eye. The eye costs 80 Dirham (about 8 Euro) and is often bought by women who put it into a leather amulet and wear it on their heart: This attracts the attention of the beloved. Dried chameleons and scorpions are sold for the same purpose. The bellows are burned to make the love spell work better. But in reality, only the eye works. The hoopoe “is considered a special bird endowed with magical powers. Its extraordinary qualities can be harnessed because they cling unaltered not only to the living animal, but to the dead as well” (Ventzlaff 2018: 75).\n\n35\n\nField research diary Tangier, April 19, 2013.\n\n39\n\n40\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nIllustration 15: Hoopoe as medicine\n\nIllustration 16: Hoopoe, Alameda Gardens\n\nAt home? Perhaps in the flight of the hoopoe. In any case, home is not necessarily a place, a house. It is more of an existential place: In Islam, man is considered a stranger on earth in this world. Weidner speaks of “the world as a foreign place or exile, gurba” and “strangeness as a human condition” (Weidner 2018). I have lived in Germany, Spain, Gibraltar, the US and in Tangier. My hoopoe flies across the Strait, in spring it nests in Gibraltar’s Alameda Gardens.\n\n2. Theoretical accesses Gibraltar would love you more than its neighbor, its sister (Martinez 1953)\n\nIn this line of poetry, Tangier and Gibraltar are not referred to as mere neighbors, but as kin. I go one step further because the focus of this book is on the one city that I strategically call TanGib.1 However, if one concentrates only on the ties between the two cities, two aspects are lost from view: • •\n\nFirstly, one must remind oneself not to neglect those cultural aspects that do not have anything in common. Secondly, the regional and transregional embeddings of TanGib must not be disregarded because these are also connected to the two cities and to each other in many ways: Cadiz, Seville, La Línea de la Concepción, San Roque and the Campo de Gibraltar, Malaga, Oran, Nador, Ksar el Kebir, Tetuán, Arcila and Laraich.\n\nThe Anthropology of the City has always dealt with the question of the specifically urban. Cities are “large settlements with an artificially constructed living environment, in which many and various inhabitants interact with each other, but for the most part remain permanently alien to each other” (Antweiler 2004: 286). ”Nowhere is the heterogeneity of cultural milieus and social fragmentation greater than in cities. Many city dwellers hardly know large parts of their city themselves, many use urban infrastructure only very selectively and communicate to a limited extent. The city is polyphonic, but many of the voices are barely heard by most residents (ibid.: 289) “[O]nly the principle of inconspicuousness allows for close coexistence in a divided public space. One leaves oneself alone; whoever wants to may remain a stranger; distance is a matter of course” (ibid.: 295).. A problem arises for the two cities and their relationships to each other: Gibraltar and Tangier are undoubtedly cities, but Gibraltar is neither large nor are its inhabitants strangers to each other – on the contrary: The fact that the individual is recognizable at all times is a social 1\n\nThe object was once calledTan-Gib (but with a hyphen) (Loftus 2013).\n\n42\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nproblem. Tangier is also a city, but until the 1960s, the majority of Tanjawis were also either personally known or easily identifiable. This was due to the dense network of civil organizations – schools, hospitals, shops, amusement parks, markets – which the groups shared. Since the 1960s, the population of around 150.000 has grown considerably, and today, a good two million people are said to live in and around the city. “Old” Tanjawis complain about this new confusion. As late as 2018, Antweiler noted that urban anthropology in general is very undertheorized. At the turn of the millennium, only a few urban anthropologists are still interested in the lively controversies of the 1970s and 1980s about focus vs. locus and anthropology in vs. anthropology of cities. [...] In recent years the number of application-oriented urban anthropologists has risen sharply, especially in the USA (Cohen/Fukui 1993). But there are also clear continuities. Urban anthropology is still predominantly an ethnology of large cities, and in most cases even very large cities. Special groups or categories, such as minorities, migrants or the poor, continue to be the focus of attention, less frequently also elites. (Antweiler 2018: 2) The phenomena I am dealing with are also very much under-theorized: We are dealing with two cities that are clearly distinguishable geographically and administratively but which would not have existed for many decades and centuries without each other: Demographic, cultural, social, economic, political, military and symbolic interdependencies between the two are so close that they would not be covered by the conventional approaches of urban anthropology. When social or political scientists today talk and write about global networks, the local background in which people live often fades into the background. Ethnologists have always known that great political and sociological narratives about globalization and the networking of the world are embedded in local contexts and that it is not everywhere as it is imagined in Western science: People still live in their worlds and not in those we imagine based on sociological macro data (Sahlins 2013). When we talk about relationships between Tangier and Gibraltar and treat them as if they were primarily those of commodity flows, political networks and ideological interdependence, we are wrong. Because specific living environments, local, regional and topographical, are still decisive for how people locate themselves, where they organize their existence and what they orient themselves by. Perhaps it is precisely this globalization-discursive hubris that assumes that individuals express themselves primarily in virtual, non-face-to-face contacts. Yet, the two cities particularly not only have a past of close interdependence but also a present. In this respect, it is appropriate to treat both cities as if they were a single city in certain eras, two closely connected sub-cities at other times and two units turned away from each other at still other times. Thus, for example, social, fami-\n\n2. Theoretical accesses\n\nly, economic and other networks and orientations of a cultural nature continue to exist in the age of globalization; they have loosened, but not suddenly dissolved. They continue to exist, albeit in a different form than before, sometimes not quite as significant; but they have not disappeared. It is simply that we, as social scientists, no longer turn our attention to these interdependencies and look at the cities precisely in terms of globalization. In this respect, the informal local interdependencies often escape our field of vision. But we look at them in this book. It is important to bring them back into the field of scientific interest. Certainly, the approach I am advocating here – namely to focus less on the two cities individually than on the relationships between them – is not so easily transferable to the relationships of other cities. I could imagine that there are not many such cases, and in individual cases, it would have to be examined whether the model can be transferred to, for example, Algiers and Marseilles, Berlin and Potsdam, Frankfurt/Oder and Słubice, Buda and Pest, Alexandria and Ismailiya, Bremen and Bremerhaven, Dover and Calais, El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, Malmö and Copenhagen or Athens and Piraeus.\n\n2.1.\n\nStructures: Cosmopolitanism, networks, diasporas, cultural areas\n\nTanGib has never been administratively a single city, so that the interrelationships and separations are different from those between West and East Berlin after 1945, between North and South Nicosia or between the individual parts of Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War. Approaches from cosmopolitanism and network and diaspora studies can be used instead, whereby the networks between the individual diasporic localities of a community play a central role. Beyond these approaches, I fall back on the theories of cultural circles and on various internalization theories. My research on cosmopolitanism (Haller 2015, 2016) is a critique of the current, often inflationary use of the term cosmopolitan in the political and philosophical sciences, which are based on either a social set of rules or an ethical stance. There, cosmopolitanism is often treated as specifically deprived of cultural and historical causes (e.g. Kleingeld/Brown 2002), as an ethical attitude (cf. Römhild/Westrich 2013), for example, in the sense of moral philosophy.2 Thus, once again, an idea rooted in the West is discussed as a universal model for social forms of society. From an ethnological perspective, I would like to argue that it would be misleading to view TanGib (and other cosmopolitan places) from such a deculturalized perspective as that of a Kantian world citizenship (Harvey 2000). Rather, TanGib’s\n\n2\n\nFuhrmann argues similarly (2007: 13).\n\n43\n\n44\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\ncosmopolitanism is the result of diverse social practices: Political context, multilingualism, mixed residency, everyday social relations across ethnic and religious categories and common institutions (such as associations or courts, police and administration).3\n\nIllustration 17: Cosmopolis\n\nThe high praise for being Tanjawi and the values associated with is exemplarily expressed in the following poem by Ouahhab Merzoughi Benshimon. 4 Mensaje di corazón a mis paisanos y hijos di mi alta tierra mi perla tanger.

It is not without irony that the wife of the English writer Lawrence Durrell, Claude-Marie Vincendon, is buried in the cemetery of the Anglican church of Saint Andrews (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankt-Andreas-Kirche_(Tanger)). Durrell is best known for his series of novels Alexandria Quartet, in which he describes the cosmopolitan life in this Egyptian city, which was not unlike that of Tangier during the period of the International Zone.

Theoretical accesses\n\nY por ti mi tierra mi quedo siempre alto como tu....ALTA TÁNGER A mis paisanos y hijos di mi tierra cantan con migo ANA TANJAWI con un comentario. Con respeto y amor Patience, tolerance, equilibrium, respect and love between people are these central values, and they can be acquired. “One can become Tanjawi,” I was told several times. It is not an exclusive but an inclusive, soft category. Lineage and purity are not part of being Tanjawi. Rather, it is a category that focuses on society and location. Sociality is especially important in being a Tanjawi: Everyday practical participation in the exchange with other Tanjawis. In this respect, being Tanjawi is not a question of identity, but rather the practice of mutual identification and, thus, corresponds roughly to the ethnicity approach of Fredrik Barth (1969) and the Imagined Communities of Benedict Anderson (1983). But with one crucial difference. In Barth’s case, ethnic groups refer to a believed common ancestry or ancestor, just as the nations in Anderson refer to a believed common, long-lasting essentiality. Not time but space plays the decisive role in being Tanjawi. Not only those who were born or grew up locally are part of it, but also those who identify with the place and whose identification is recognized by others. Location-relatedness can mean different things, which Driss Fikri points out to me: For some, the fact that you were born in Tangier and have a Tanjawi accent is already a Tanjawi. Others, even if you were born in Tangier but your parents were born in the Rif and speak Riffi at home, you will be considered Rif or Susi or Fasi or Aroubi if you are from Beni Mellal, for example. For some Muslim Tanjawi, descendants of old city families who lived in the medina, Dradeb or Merchán, the residents of the popular neighborhoods who grew up with the wave of the rural exodus of the 60s, 70s and 80s are not considered Tanjawis. For some, Tanjawi is the Muslim Moroccan who was born or adopted in Tangier, whereas the Indian or Spaniard is a Hindawi or Nesrani. Still others have a very broad idea: Not only those who were born or grew up locally are part of it but also those who identify with the place and whose identification is recognized by others. This probably goes back to a diplomatic practice: “As an indicator of this ambiguity, European consuls registered as \"residents\" anyone who stayed in the city for at least two months; a group that included some 2,000 British tourists who came each year to enjoy the mild winter.” (Pack 2015: 50) What all approaches have in common, however, is the location-relatedness. Being recognized by Muslims who had remained in Tangier is one of the emotional moments in which Tanjawis’ common reference to place comes to light. I’ve heard many stories like that of Maurice Elbaz, who has lived in the United States\n\n45\n\n46\n\nTangier/Gibraltar – A Tale of One City\n\nfor 40 years. He tells the story of a visit (around 2012) to Tangier with his second wife and son. He rented a car with a driver to show them around the city. When they passed a certain site, Mr. Elbaz said that his father was the owner. Thereupon the driver stepped on the brakes and asked äre you the son of Albertito?”Mr. Elbaz affirmed and the man burst into tears: he himself had got his first job as a young man with Albertito. 5 The researched online forums are excellent arenas in which people profess to be Tanjawis and mutually assure each other their Tanjawiness. “Me siento orgulloso de ser de una ciudad tan especial y peculiar como Tanger, y la llevo en mi corazón y en mi sangre, siempre la echo de menos, y este es mi barrio donde he nacido plaza de toros. Tanjawi/tangerino.”6 I met Daniel Benaross (* 1940) on one of the online platforms and we exchanged our Whattsapp numbers. So it came to a phone call with Daniel in Carácas/Venezuela. In order to convey the typical convivencia between the groups in Tangier, he told me that in his youth the religious background of the families was known, but that this was not important: “You didn’t say ’el judío’ or ’el moro’. It didn’t matter. We were just friends. At school, of course, you spoke depending on which school you attended - for example the French Lycée Regnault. At home we spoke Spanish. Amongts each other, we might have started in Spanish and then switched to French, and then back and forth during our conversation. When I started going out with friends at the age of 15 - back then, 007 and Whiskey a Gogo were ’in’. At Whiskey a Go Go there were once four English guys at the bar and they turned out to be the famous Rolling Stones. For us it was just four famous English musicians, they visited Tangier like others, because here famous people could move around quite normally apart from the great attention. It was a ’golden youth’. This is the only way to understand why the old participants at the online platforms are so euphoric about that time and the city. The only differences that were actually made were that no one from Tangier was a domestic worker or a gardener: one had hired about maids from the Rif Mountains.”7 Direct self / external designations (Ana Tanjawi = I am Tanjawi, ntina / eres Tanjawia = you are a Tanjawja, verdadera tangerine = true Tangerina, Tanjawi de adopción = adoptierter Tanjawi) or the friendly attribution of characteristics that Tanjawis ascribe to themselves (Comme un vrai Tanjawi, tu veilles tard).8 Here, however, some further restrictions are necessary, because I am referring here to the current and contextless use of the term.

Tanjawi comes from Arabic and has displaced the variety of earlier terms from other languages. Of course, Spanish words in Tangier’s Arabic language are losing ground, especially among the young Tanjawis born after 1990. “The most shocking thing for me is,” says Driss Fikri, “when young Tanjawis communicate in English with the waiters and hoteliers during their holidays on the Costa del Sol. Tanjawis are increasingly similar to the Filipinos, who have lost the use of Spanish, although they have Spanish surnames.” Thus, Spanish has largely fallen out of use in Tangier, as has French, and the previously widespread terms Tangerino and Tangerois are hardly ever used by the inhabitants. However, they are often used in conversations with Europeans, as most of them do not speak Arabic. When a Muslim "
