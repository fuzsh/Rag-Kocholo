They also have 10 suicide v ests to\n\nbe used during suicide attacks. The organization has a plan to make 40\n\nsuch suicide vests. The JMB extremists have acquired the technology to\n\nproduce rocket launchers too. They have already produced three rocket\n\nlaunchers, and a successful test of the device was held in Barguna\n\nDistrict adjacent to the Sundarbans.\n\nReliable sources have said that arrested JMB chief Saidur Rahman divulged\n\nthis information to the law-enforcement agencies during interrogation. The\n\nsources said that the JMB chief said that his organization had 25 trained\n\ncadres to carry out suicide attacks. He said that the JMB had 50\n\n\"technicians\" to produce bombs and waist belts. They reportedly received\n\nthe training from a person called \"bomber Mizan.\"\n\nThe law enforcers recently recovered bombs attached to suicide vests from\n\na JMB den at Siddhirganj. The recovery of the bombs with such technologies\n\nis the first of its kind in Bangladesh. Local bomb experts, who receive d\n\ntraining in the United States, have said that the Tamil guerrillas used\n\nsuch devices to carry out suicide attacks.\n\nThe detective branch (DB) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) have\n\ntaken Saidur into police remand for more two days on 6 June after 11 days\n\nof his remand in two phases. During interrogation in the first phases, JMB\n\nchief Saidur Rahman did not say anything. Later, he was taken to the\n\nTaskforce Interrogation Center (TFI) and was grilled there for two days.\n\nDuring the quizzing at the center, he divulged much information about the\n\norganizational structure of the JMB.\n\nA source related to the interrogation said that the JMB chief told the\n\ninvestigators that his organization was now giving preference to acquire\n\nnewer technologies using local ingredients, producing easily potable\n\nbombs, and maximum use of explosives that can be procured locally. They\n\nare collecting ammonium nitrated, potassium chloride, manganese dioxide,\n\nand sulfur from the local ma rkets.\n\nIn addition, as substitute to the explosives they have acquired a strategy\n\nto produce alternative of some ingredients by burning urea fertilizer,\n\ncricket bats, and crusts of indigenous 'akand' tree. Earlier, the\n\naforementioned explosives had been recovered from different extremist\n\nhideouts; but, the police and RAB (Rapid Action Battalion) first came to\n\nknow about the use of urea fertilizer only in 2008.\n\nIn the night of 24 May, a special branch team of the police headquarters\n\nunearthed a big hideout of the extremist at Pinadi of Siddhirganj after\n\narresting three persons, including JMB chief Saidur Rahman from East\n\nDhania of capital Dhaka.\n\nThe special branch team conducted raid on that hideout and arrested two\n\nmore extremists. They recovered huge bomb-making materials from the den,\n\nincluding 10 waist belts suitable for carrying out suicide attacks.\n\nAmir Hossain, alias Sharif, one of the militants arrested from that\n\nhideout, told the police du ring interrogation that the JMB chief had\n\nordered them to produce 40 suicide vests and that Sharif himself had made\n\n10 of the vests. However, the explosive technicians had made the bombs\n\nused in the vests.\n\nAdditional Police Super Jannatul Hasan, who led these drives, told the\n\ndaily Prothom Alo that in the beginning, they could not think of how\n\npowerful were the bombs fitted with the vests. The DB bomb specialists on\n\n30 May neutralized the vest through conducting a minor explosion.\n\nOne DB bomb disposal official, who was trained in foreign countries, told\n\nthe Prothom Alo that the bomb, made of plastic explosives with a steel\n\ncase, was highly powerful. The detonator used inside the device was\n\nlocally made. Eight pencil batteries were fitted with the detonator to\n\nactivate it. Each of the bombs recovered earlier had only two pencil\n\nbatteries. This official said that during his training in foreign\n\ncountries, he came to k now that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam\n\n(LTTE) guerrillas of Sri Lanka had used such type of bombs and vests for\n\ncarrying out suicide attacks.\n\nThe police sources said that Saidur Rahman had issued order for producing\n\n40 \"suicide vests,\" but did not give any clear information about when and\n\nwhere the devices were to be used. He claimed that the vests were made\n\nwith a plan to use those to avoid militants being arrested alive.\n\nConcerned officials, however, have claimed that Saidur's statement in this\n\nregard was not reliable.\n\nMeanwhile, more nine live bombs were recovered from the residence one\n\nShiblu, coordinator of the military wing of the JMB, at South Dhania of\n\ncapital Dhaka on 24 May. Sanowar Hossain, assistant commission (AC) of the\n\nDB and an official of the bomb disposal unit, recovered and defused the\n\ndevices. He said that although the bombs were small in size, they were\n\nheavily powerful.\n\nSanowar said that during his training in the United States, he came to\n\nknow that the militan ts of Pakistan and Afghanistan were now producing\n\nbombs using this technology. As a result, he believed that someone in the\n\nJMB might have gone to those countries recently to take training on\n\nbomb-making technology or someone from there might have come here to\n\nimpart the training.\n\nHowever, despite recovering the new-technology bombs, the investigators\n\nare yet to dig out the technologists or their training mode. When asked,\n\nMonirul Islam, deputy commissioner of the DB, told the Prothom Alo that\n\nmore information about the technology of new bombs and sources of the\n\nexplosives could be known if the JMB military wing coordinator Shiblu was\n\ninterrogated.\n\n(Description of Source: Dhaka Prothom Alo in Bengali  The largest\n\ncirculated daily in Bangladesh known for objective reporting.

According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crimes (UNODC),\n\nBolivia supplies close to 30% of the almost 100,000 metric tons of cocaine\n\nthat enter Brazil per year. Fausto writes about the political, the social,\n\nand the traditional role of coca in Bolivia, as well as President Evo\n\nMorales' stance on coca and his close link to coca growers. Coca is an\n\nessential element in a political stance that seeks ethnic origins in the\n\npre-Columbian past to allow the re-foundation of Bolivia as a pluriethnic\n\nstate with an indigenous majority. Bolivia's main antagonist is no longer\n\nthe Spanish crown, argues Fausto, it is the United States, the country\n\nidentified with criminalization of the coca leaf and efforts to eradicate\n\ncoca plantations in the 1990s. Morales failed to avail coca growers\n\neconomically viable alternatives and in late 2008 expelled DEA agents. The\n\nissue at hand is now whether it is or not possible to deal with cocaine\n\ntrafficking in view of the coca production that exceeds the demand for\n\nlegal products, and in the absence of the DEA or an effective European\n\nsubstitute for the US agency. The answer must consider drug running\n\nprofitability and the power of organized crime that outweigh the desire\n\nfor coca leaf manufactured goods. Brazil, Fausto concludes, cannot remain\n\nindifferent to the conundrum in view of the ease with which Bolivian\n\ncocaine flows over the border into Brazil and the damage the narcotic as\n\nwell as crack do to Brazilian society. Fausto praises the announced intent\n\nto set up a Brazil-Bolivia effort to curb drug trafficking but qualifies\n\nthe initiative timid. The country would do better to extend the Amazon\n\nRegion Surveillance System (Sivam) to cover the Bolivia-Brazil border, a\n\nmeasure , he argues, far more important that the purchase of state of the\n\nart jet fighters. It is also high time for Brazilian diplomacy to question\n\nMorales' policies related to an issue that transcends Bolivia's borders.\n\nFausto criticizes President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for displaying a\n\ncoca leaf around his neck when he visited the Chapare region of Bolivia in\n\n2009 on the eve of Morales' reelection.

He will\n\nthen travel to Sharm al-Shaykh for talks with Egyptian President Husni\n\nMubarak. As in Washington and Madrid, Abu-Mazin's talks at a working lunch\n\nwith French President Nicolas Sarkozy focused on the Israeli assault on\n\nthe \"Freedom Flotilla\" and its aftermath, particularly the ideas that the\n\nEuropean countries proposed to lift the blockade on the Gaza Strip and set\n\nup a fact-finding committee in accordance with the UN Security Council's\n\nrequest in this respect. He earlier conferred with French Foreign Minister\n\nBernard Couchner who hosted him at dinner at the Ministry of Foreign\n\nAffairs on 13 June.\n\nAlthough both the French and Palestinian parties avoided mentioning\n\ndifferences in the talks, differences in views emerged over the issue of\n\nthe fact-finding committee the formation of which Israel announced in the\n\nmorning of 14 June. Abu-Mazin seized the opportunity of speaking to the\n\npress after meeting with Sarkozy to declare that he did not see in \"what\n\nis being proposed anything that meets the provisions of the UN Security\n\nCouncil's resolution on this issue.\"\n\nAbu-Mazin emphasized that what the Palestinians want is the formation of a\n\nfact-finding committee as the UN Security Council requested in the\n\nstatement it released after its meeting, which was devoted to debating the\n\nIsraeli raid on the Freedom Flotilla. Against this Palestinian position,\n\nthe French stand seems to show \"understanding\" of the committee as it has\n\nbeen formed. At the news conference, the French Ministry of Foreign\n\nAffairs said that \"the presence of international observers in the\n\ncommittee, which was formed by the Israeli authorities, is a positive\n\nelement.\" It added that it hoped that the committee \"would be able to\n\ndisplay that its efforts would reflect credibility, transparency, and\n\nneutrality in keeping with international standards.\"\n\nDiscussing the impression with which the Palestinian delegation emerged\n\nafter the two meetings with President Sarkozy and Foreign Minister\n\nCouchner, Palestinian sources said that there was some \"vagueness\" about\n\nthe concept of the mechanism proposed by France and the EU for lifting th\n\ne blockade on the Gaza strip. In addition, France and the Europeans, on\n\nthe one hand, and the Palestinians on the other, did not express the same\n\nviews on this issue. While the Palestinians call for lifting the blockade\n\non Gaza, the Europeans talk of \"easing\" it, as the working paper discussed\n\nby the EU ministers in Luxembourg yesterday demonstrated. Israel is\n\nopposed to the European proposal, which provides for inspection of the\n\nships headed for Gaza, or for the return of the European supervisors to\n\nman the Rafah crossing. France and the EU are seeking to make Israel\n\ndeclare a list of the materials that will be banned entry to Gaza, which\n\nwill mean that anything that is not on the list will be allowed.\n\nPresident Abu-Mazin said that his talks with President Sarkozy were \"good'\n\nand that they first discussed the Gaza issue and then the current indirect\n\nnegotiations with Israel through US envoy George Mitchell. Regarding the\n\nindirect negotiations, Presiden t Abu-Mazin said that in the event no\n\nprogress is made in these negotiations, and if the Palestinians fail to\n\nget anything from Israel by the fall, we must \"pause to reconsider what\n\ncan happen.\" He stressed that he and Sarkozy are \"in agreement\" on this\n\nissue. He noted that he and Sarkozy discussed an \"initiative\" that the\n\nEuropeans and the Americans may put forward in this fall, as the French\n\npresident had previously stressed. Paris had previously proposed holding\n\nan international summit for this purpose, and expressed his readiness to\n\ncooperate with Moscow.\n\nPalesti nian officials who accompanied President Abu-Mazin to Washington\n\ntold Al-Sharq al-Awsat that the Palestinians did not hear President Obama\n\nor Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mention a new US plan. These sources\n\nadded: \"Rather than having a new plan, we believe that it will be more\n\nuseful to see compliance with the road map plan, which the Quartet\n\ncommittee drafted and of which the United States is a member.\" These\n\nsources revealed that the Palestinian delegation \"did not receive promises\n\nor commitments from the US Administration, but sensed the administration's\n\nunderstanding of the Palestinian position.\" President Abu-Mazin emphasized\n\nthat \"without progress in the two issues of border and security, we will\n\nnot move on to direct negotiations.\" Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin\n\nNetanyahu is pressuring (the Palestinians} to move to direct negotiations\n\nas quickly as possible.\n\nIn a private meeting with Nabil Abu-Rudaynah, spokesman for the\n\nPalestinian Presidency, on the sidelines of Abu-Mazin's visit, he told\n\nAl-Sharq al-Awsat that \"the main success the visit to Washington made lay\n\nin the fact that the Palestinian party did not come under pressure to\n\nagree to direct negotiations without the achievement of the necessary and\n\ninescapable progress in the issue of border. The Palestinian delegation\n\nwas not held responsible for this, contrary to what happened in the past.\n\nThe second success was receiving US support for the PA's policy, and the\n\nthird was the financial subsidy of $400 million to establish\n\ninfrastructure projects.\"\n\nAs for the alternatives that the Palestinian party has in the event that\n\nthe indirect negotiations made no progress, Abu-Rudaynah said that the\n\nPalestinians will go back to the Arab Follow-up committee, which gave the\n\nPalestinians the green light to take part in the indirect negotiations for\n\nfour months. We will refer this issue to the Arab Follow-up Committee\n\nwhich will meet in New York in September. This committee will decide in\n\nlight of the outcome of the indirect negotiations whether or not to allow\n\nthe Palestinians to move to direct negotiations.\n\nAbu-Rudaynah refused to speculate in advance on the progress of the\n\nindirect negotiations which have so far ended three rounds. However, he\n\nreferred to US assertions that the US Administratio n will continue to\n\nexert active efforts. He hinted that US officials of various levels will\n\npay several visits to the region. He warned that Netanyahu is marking\n\ntime, is fabricating problems, and has not yet seriously accepted the idea\n\nof the creation of a Palestinian state. According to Abu-Rudaynah, what\n\nthe Palestinians are asking for is \"Israeli commitments and US\n\nclarifications and guarantees to compel Israel to implement (any\n\nagreement) on which understanding is reached.\" He warned that this summer\n\n\"will be an important crossroads for the peace process or for the fate of\n\nthe region and of some regional countries.\" He questioned the \"meaning\" of\n\nnegotiations if no understanding is reached over the border of a\n\nPalestinian state which, from the Palestinian viewpoint, includes Gaza,\n\nthe West Bank, Jerusalem, the valley (west of the Jordan River), and the\n\nDead Sea. He added that the Palestinian party pointed out to the US\n\nAdministration its re jection of any state with provisional border, which\n\nis basically an Israeli idea, \"but which Israel found a party that sought\n\nto sell it,\" or to discuss it with.\n\nRegarding the visit that Amr Musa paid to Gaza, Abu-Rudaynah said that the\n\nvisit \"did not disturb\" the PA. He noted that Musa contacted Abu-Mazin\n\nbefore he paid the visit. He said that Musa affirmed that understanding on\n\nany discussion of a mechanism for lifting the blockade on Gaza will be\n\nreached with the PA, not with any other party.\n\n(Description of Source: London Al-Sharq al-Awsat Online in Arabic --\n\nWebsite of influential London-based pan-Arab Saudi daily; editorial line\n\nreflects Saudi official stance.

This\n\nmeans opening all the Israeli crossings,\" Abbas said.Abbas called for an\n\nimpartial fact-finding committee to investigate the Israeli attack on the\n\nFreedom Flotilla, which killed nine pro-Palestinian activists.\"This\n\ninvestigation committee has to be in accordance with the presidential\n\nstatement issued by the (UN) Security Council,\" he added.The UN Security\n\nCouncil, in its presidential statement of May 31, called for an impartial\n\ninvestigation into the Israeli attack on the flotilla carrying\n\nhumanitarian aid to Gaza.It is important to make use of these political\n\nactivities cau sed by the Israeli attack on the flotilla to lift the siege\n\non Gaza, Emad Gad, an expert from Al-Ahram Center for Political and\n\nStrategic Studies told Xinhua.Gad said the strip has six crossings\n\nbordered on Israel and one on Egypt, and the international community\n\nshould not allow this unjustified blockade exist.He added that a marine\n\nforce from Europe or other countries can be formed to search the ships\n\nheading to Gaza, to make sure that they don't carry any weapon. And it is\n\nalso important that the European Union (EU) and UN send supervisors to\n\nRafah crossing to make sure it will be opened permanently.As for the\n\ninter-Palestinian reconciliation, Gad said it is necessary to be\n\naccomplished, which will remove the reasons of the blockade, as the siege\n\nwas imposed after Hamas controlled the Gaza Strip.Gad said it is important\n\nto make use of the current condition to push the peace process forward,\n\nreferring to the meeting between Abbas and Mubarak and the former's tour\n\nin Turkey , the U.S. , Spain and France.Abbas discussed last week with\n\nObama the \"disastrous attack by Israeli forces\" on a Gaza-bound aid\n\nflotilla, the necessary mechanism of lifting the siege imposed on Gaza\n\nthree yeas ago and the indirect negotiations between Palestinians and\n\nIsraelis.The proximity talks, supposed to handle security issues and the\n\nborders of the future Palestinian state, have not yet made progress since\n\nit kicked off in May.Earlier, Azzam al-Ahmad, a Fatah official, said the\n\nPalestinian president has assured Hamas that the Islamic movement's\n\nreservation on an Egyptian proposal for Palestinian unity would be\n\nconsidered after Hamas signs the Egyptian plan.Al-Ahmad said that Fatah\n\nagrees on conducting the presidential and parliament elections supervised\n\nby Turkey and other foreign countries and international institutions from\n\nall over the world.\"We are working on lifting the siege, not just to ease\n\nit through talking about a visit or entering some goods ,\" al-Ahmad\n\nadded.He asserted the reconciliation as the only way to revive the\n\nnational cause through gathering hands to found a law to face the Israeli\n\ncriminals and the European and American hesitation.(Description of Source:\n\nBeijing Xinhua in English -- China's official news service for\n\nEnglish-language audiences (New China News Agency))\n\nMaterial in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the\n\nsource cited.

Exchanging views with the Center for\n\nStrategic and International Studies (CSIS), Washington-based think-tank,\n\nUS Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake said that considerable\n\nprogress was made in talks betw een India and Pakistan between 2004 and\n\n2007 and that both countries had advanced much on the especially on the\n\nKashmir issue. He said that Kashmir was an extremely important issue\n\nbetween India and Pakistan, and it was expected that this dialogue process\n\nbetween both countries would make progress.\n\nAnswering a question during a media briefing in Washington on 11 June, US\n\nDeputy Secretary of State Phillip Crowley claimed that peace talks between\n\nPakistan and India were about to be started, and it was expected that both\n\ncountries would broaden the talks. He said that the next two months were\n\nvery important for Pakistan and India on the issue of Kashmir. Terming the\n\nvisit of the Indian prime minister to Srinagar successful, he said that it\n\nwould yield positive results in the coming days.\n\nAlthough the Indian authorities had time and again said that no talks\n\nwould be held on matters like Kashmir in any dialogue process with\n\nPakistan, and talks would now be held only on confidence building, but the\n\nway in which the US deputy secretary of state termed the next two months\n\nvery important for Pakistan and India vis-a-vis Kashmir issue, and the way\n\nin which the assistant secretary of state asserted on resumption of talks\n\nfrom the 2007 position clearly showed that parleys had started between\n\nPakistan and India on the Kashmir issue. The formula of former dictator\n\nGeneral Musharraf is also being referred to in this context.\n\nThe optimism expressed by the Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh\n\nafter his one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and\n\nthen formal meeting that lasted for one and a half hour in the Bhutanese\n\ncapital Thimpu, on the sidelines of the SAARC Summit, and his willingness\n\nfor talks with Pakistan on all the issues, including the Kashmir issue,\n\nand Prime Minister Gilani's expression of satisfaction indicates that our\n\nrulers have given a green signal to India for the resolution of the\n\nKashmir issue accord ing to its (India's) wishes. On this basis, the\n\nIndian prime minister would have found it easy to announce dialogue with\n\nPakistan on all issues, including Kashmir, otherwise, he had to face\n\nstrict criticism by the opposition as well as his own party in the lower\n\nhouse of parliament regarding his assurance about investigation into the\n\nIndian involvement in Balochistan. In this situation, he could not have\n\nrun the risk of announcing holding of dialogue with Pakistan on all\n\nissues, including Kashmir. On his return to the country, he did not face\n\nany criticism for making this announcement.\n\nThe government had faced a similar situation during Musharraf's period,\n\nwhen he presented the four-point formula on Kashmir under which an\n\nindication was given that Pakistan might abandon its claim on Kashmir, and\n\nshowing more flexibility, such formula for the solution of Kashmir issue\n\nwas put forward, which not only weakened the long standing stance of\n\nPakistan on Kashmir but it also s eemed as if Kashmir was being offered to\n\nIndia in a plate. Because of this, the Indian prime minister fell under a\n\nmisperception about accomplishment of greater Indian plan. On this, he was\n\noverjoyed and expressed his desire, \"I want to have breakfast in Amritsar,\n\nlunch at Lahore, and dinner in Peshawar.\"\n\nDespite creation of such conductive environment for India on the Kashmir\n\nissue by Musharraf, the cunning Hindu usurer did not abandon its\n\nintransigence of terming Kashmir its inseparable part, which clearly\n\nshowed that only such formula for the resolution of Kashmir issue could be\n\nacceptable for India under which Kashmir fell into its lap. If it had been\n\nsincere in resolving the Kashmir issue in acco rdance with the aspirations\n\nof the Kashmiris, first Indian Prime Minister Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru\n\nwould have resolved it when he had first taken the issue to the United\n\nNations by making it a dispute (as published).\n\nHowever, when the UN General Assembly directed for holding plebiscite in\n\nKashmir at his request, India pushed its troops into Kashmir and\n\nestablished its domination. This domination continues to date, and the\n\nKashmiris have offered the sacrifices of thousands of lives during their\n\nstruggle for liberation. Despite this, their resolve has not wavered. At\n\nthis stage, when their struggle appears to be succeeding, which the Indian\n\nprime minister also felt during his visit to Srinagar, if the present\n\ngovernment shows the same flexibility as was shown during the Musharraf\n\nregime, which provided an opportunity to India to accomplish its design,\n\nthis situation will disappoint the Kashmiris, and our jugular vein will\n\nfall into the clutches of the enemy. Therefore, the nation has a right to\n\nask the rulers that whether they have struck a deal on Kashmir or going to\n\nsit on the negotiating table with India for the sake of \"hope for peace?\"\n\nIt is an irony that Indian Foreign Minister S. M. Krishna is confirmi ng\n\nhis visit to Pakistan in July, while during his visit to New York last\n\nweek, he announced that his country would not sit on negotiating table\n\nwith Pakistan until it fully eliminated terrorists from its soil. If India\n\nholds talks with Pakistan, these are either aimed at holding Pakistan\n\nfully responsible for terrorism or to bracket jihad in Kashmir with\n\nterrorism.\n\nAfter expression of this inner malice by India, how can it be expected\n\nthat India will stop terming Kashmir its inseparable part and become\n\nwilling to resolve it in the light of the UN resolutions. Therefore, if\n\nthe United States is so optimistic about the resolution of the Kashmir\n\nissue in the next two months, there is certainly something wrong at the\n\nbottom. However, our rulers should not forget that the Kashmiris and\n\nPakistanis will not accept any solution of the Kashmir issue, except as\n\nenvisaged in the UN resolutions, and they will not allow the government to\n\ndo so either. The nation had already rejec ted Musharraf's formula for the\n\nresolution of the Kashmir issue, and if the government tries to sit on\n\nnegotiating table with India on the basis of Musharraf's formula, it will\n\nhave to face strict resistance from the nation.\n\nTherefore, it will be better to take the nation and parliament into\n\nconfidence before sitting on negotiating table with India, and it should\n\nclearly be told that what are the issues on which talks will be held with\n\nIndia. The nation will not allow any compromise on Kashmir.\n\n(Description of Source: Rawalpindi Nawa-e Waqt in Urdu -- Privately owned,\n\nwidely read, conservative Islamic daily, with circulation around 125,000.\n\nHarshly critical of the US and India.)\n\nMaterial in the World News Connection is generally copyrighted by the\n\nsource cited.

First paragraph is\n\nan introduction. - Spiegel Online\n\nTuesday June 15, 2010 18:02:58 GMT\n\n(Thorbjorn Jagland) It is true that the Court is overloaded, for the very\n\nreason of its own success. As every year sees more and more complaints\n\nbeing submitted, a reform is now scheduled for June, aimed at making the\n\nCourt more efficient... (Spiegel Online)\n\n...even though this has long been blocked by Russia.\n\n(Jagland) Yes, one of my first official acts on taking office was to\n\ntravel to Moscow and get President Medvedev to go along with this reform,\n\nwhich Russia has just done last spring. But a whole lot more still has to\n\nbe done, so as to move the Court of Human Rights forward. (Spiegel Online)\n\nSuch as?\n\n(Jagland) We need a better filtering mechanism. Today, any citizen can\n\nturn to the Court, by submitting their concerns in writing. Yet more than\n\n90 percent of cases end up being rejected by the Court as inadmissible.\n\nThe judges should be able to focus right from the outset on the most\n\nimportant cases. (Spiegel Online)\n\nThis alone isn't going to stem the flood of complaints.\n\n(Jagland) I know. Many cases come in particular from those countries whose\n\ncitizens do not trust their own judicial systems. For these, the court is\n\nnot the final scope for appeal, but often a kind of first instance. For\n\nthis reason, we have to ensure that many states reform their own judicial\n\nsystems. Since 30 percent of complaints presently emanate from Russia\n\nalone, we are going to help the Court if the Russian Federation reforms\n\nits legal system - this is what makes it so important that Russia has now\n\nrecognized the importance of the Court. (Spiegel Online)\n\nIs Turkey also one of your more problematic members? The German media\n\nrecently reported that more than 250 children and young people, mostly of\n\nKurdish origin, are serving jail terms, often of many years' duration, for\n\nalleged terrorist activities. Are you aware of this?\n\n(Jagland) Yes, and I am concerned about it. This example shows the need\n\nfor Turkey to make further reforms to its constitution and its\n\nlegislation. I had a long talk with Prime Minister Erdogan about this two\n\nmonths ago, constitutional reform is at least being discussed right now in\n\nthe Turkish Parliament, so as to enable Turkey to measure up better to the\n\nrulings of the European Court of Human Rights. Of course, Turkey must also\n\ndo more for its Kurdish population. Having said that, the Erdogan\n\ngovernment is the first one to have done anything at all on this, and this\n\nfact does also need to be recognized. (Spiegel Online)\n\nGiven these conditions, is Turkey ready for negotiations on joining the\n\nEuropean Union?\n\n(Jagland) This is not a decision for me to make. But I can see that Turkey\n\nis moving well toward European standards, and that it is working hard to\n\nbecome a European nation. If Turkey does become successfully and\n\ncompletely integrated into the European community, then this would have a\n\nmajor influence upon Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and many other Muslim countries.\n\n(Spiegel Online)\n\nReligious issues are also playing an ever-greater role in the Council of\n\nEurope. Italy was recently condemned by the Strasbourg court for the\n\npresence of crucifixes on the walls of Italian classrooms. What is going\n\nto happen if Italy is unwilling to make any changes?\n\n(Jagland) Well now, Italy has filed an appeal with the Court's Grand\n\nChamber against this ruling, and we now have to await its verdict. But\n\nobviously the question that arises here is that of the extent to which the\n\nCourt should interfere in national issues. (Spiegel Online)\n\nAnd? Should it?\n\n(Jagland) It's a matter of the Court's defending the fundamental, the most\n\nimportant human rights. In the process, our conception of human rights is\n\nchanging, albeit in an ongoing way; just think of the rights of\n\nhomosexuals - ten years ago, it was still by no means taken for granted\n\nthat these fell under the aegis of protecting human rights. But some\n\nissues can lose some of their importance, too; the Court must remain\n\nfocused on these changes. (Spiegel Online)\n\nLet's stick to the case of crucifixes in schools: Many Germans have the\n\nsame problem with this Catholic tradition. If it were to be forbidden for\n\nItaly, then the immediate result would be German plaintiffs turning to\n\nStrasbourg too.\n\n(Jagland) Yes, I can see that, the question that now arises is this:\n\nShould the crucifix really be such a big issue? Or t o put it another way:\n\nIs it really the job of politician"
