        "text": "JULY 12, 2001\n\nQuestions Over West Bank Newborn Death\n\nBy MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH\n\nAssociated Press Writer\n\nBARDALA, West Bank (AP) -- Israeli soldiers did not bar a Palestinian woman in labor from passing an Israeli checkpoint, her relatives said Thursday, contradicting initial claims by two Palestinian doctors who blamed a checkpoint delay for the newborn's death. The baby boy was born in a taxi at the checkpoint Tuesday, and was dead on arrival at a nearby Palestinian clinic, the family said. A doctor said the boy suffocated because the family members assisting in the birth did not know how to keep his airway open. The Israeli army had said in an initial response that the doctors' claims were unfounded, but that it was investigating the case. The army reiterated Thursday that soldiers did not bar the woman from passing the checkpoint.\n\nThe events began Tuesday afternoon at a remote Bedouin encampment in the hills of the northern West Bank. Firial Dais, a resident of the encampment, went into labor and her father-in-law, Ali, went to the nearest highway, about 10 minutes away, to flag down a taxi.\n\nAli Dais, speaking to The Associated Press on Thursday, said it took him about 30 minutes to find a taxi. He said he, his wife and daughter-in-law got into the taxi and drove toward the village of Tubas which has a medical clinic.\n\nEn route, they came upon an Israeli army checkpoint which was closed to Palestinian traffic at the time. Dais, 50, said he did not alert soldiers at the checkpoint to the fact that his daughter-in-law was in labor, and, when pressed, had no explanation.\n\nDais also said he did not remember how many cars, if any, were waiting at the checkpoint, adding that he was flustered by the situation. The taxi had been waiting for about 15 minutes at the checkpoint when the woman gave birth, said Dais, who was herding his flock of sheep Thursday close to the village of Bardala, several miles from his encampment.\n\nAfter the birth, the taxi driver walked up to the soldiers and explained the situation to them. \"They (the soldiers) asked whether it was a boy or a girl. They allowed us to pass, and we did,\" Dais said.\n\nThe shepherd said that by the time they reached the Tubas clinic, the boy was dead.\n\nThe director of the clinic, Dr. Abdel Hassan Daraghmeh, told the AP on Wednesday that the taxi had been held up at the roadblock for an hour.\n\nAsked to explain the discrepancy, Dr. Daraghmeh said Thursday that it was the driver, not the woman's relatives, who informed him there had been a considerable delay at the checkpoint.\n\nThe family's physician, Dr. Ghassan Hamdan, said initially that he delivered the baby at the checkpoint after soldiers prevented the mother from traveling to a hospital. But he later said he was not present for the birth and only heard of the case second-hand.\n\n© The Associated Press\n\n[Note: This story is just the tip of the iceberg. That \"Palestinian\" Arabs, even respected professionals -- such as doctors, lawyers and \"government\" ministers -- continually lie and otherwise distort reality as part of their propaganda war against Israel is not surprising. That the Associated Press subsequently bothered to fact-check the two major lies appearing in its initial reportage of this story and then published the truth is surprising (and refreshing). Of course, the fact that the father-in-law and the taxi driver of the pregnant women revealed the truth is also to be commended. However, the real problem with The Associated Press and other syndicated media is that this corrective story is the exception that proves the rule, namely, that the constant and unerring repetition of the Big Lie -- as perfected by Nazi propaganda minister Paul Josef Goebbels during the Holocaust -- eventually and alchemically converts such tales from patently outrageous mendacities into unchallengeable truisms. When such media organizations -- as is their routine practice -- initially publish these \"Palestinian\" lies without prior fact-checking, the media thereby become a midwife to these blood libels. Subsequent fact-checking and post-publication corrective reports by the media are a poor substitute for what should be the media's initial refusal to publish such falsehoods. Please remember this story and the other articles in this Compendium the next time that you read a news report by an international media service in which a \"Palestinian\" Arab -- even a respected professional -- has accused the Jewish State of the basest atrocities. Of course, not all of these lies are motivated by Ideology; some are motivated by Fear (e.g., the concern that, by refusing to corroborate anti-Israel calumnies, the uncooperative person thereby endangers himself and/or his family). -- Mark Rosenblit]\n\n[Note: An additional installment of the Big Lie was disseminated worldwide by means of a movie -- \"Jenin, Jenin\" -- which was made by an \"Israeli\" Arab actor about the fictitious massacre of \"defenseless\" Arabs by the Israeli Defense Forces in Jenin in Spring 2002. Read on!]\n\n(Jerusalem Post, November 22, 2002) WEIN ON-LINE, BY BEREL WEIN: Hebron, Hebron\n\nThe merciless slaughter of Jews in Hebron last Shabbat [as a result of an Arab terror atrocity] has cast a further pall over all of us. The murders at Kibbutz Metzer the previous week are now pushed back by the blood of these new victims of Arab terror. The killings are all without strategic purpose any longer. The Arabs realize that their cause for Palestinian statehood has been badly impaired, if not completely destroyed, by their murderous terror. So, they are now killing just to kill, without true cause or practical purpose.\n\nThis is the harvest of hatred and propaganda foisted on the current Arab generation by 50 years of corrupt, cynical, and tyrannical leadership. As long as Arab schoolchildren are taught to hate Jews, as long as all of the ills of the Arab world are always blamed on the Zionists, as long as they are still told that eventually there will be no State of Israel, chances for peace and accommodation are absolutely nil. No \"Peace Now\" slogans can change this reality. That is really the lesson of the last decade of Arab-Israeli relations. Delusional haters are not partners for any type of peace.\n\nNo Israeli filmmaker is going to make a movie about Kibbutz Metzer or about Hebron. No, the movie that is made and shown in Israel to the intellectual avant garde is \"Jenin, Jenin\". In an article that recently appeared here in the Hebrew press, Dr. David Zangan, who was present during the fighting at Jenin, described the movie and the Jewish audience attending its showing. The movie is riddled with outright lies, misstatements, half-truths, and Palestinian propaganda.\n\nThe Palestinian doctor that was the head of a hospital in Jenin claims on camera that Israeli troops totally destroyed its newly built west wing. The truth is that there was never any west wing. The movie could not show the rubble of the destroyed west wing. It merely blithely accepted the lie, although the movie makers should have been aware, with a little investigation on their part, of the true situation.\n\nThe movie claims that electricity and water supplies to the hospital were cut off during the fight. Zangan states that the hospital was not damaged and that the IDF was careful to make certain that electricity, oxygen, and water were supplied to the hospital on a normal basis. When Zangan confronted the filmmaker on this, his only response was that a shard of broken glass, dramatically highlighted in the film, must have come from the imaginary west wing.\n\nA 75-year-old Palestinian interviewed in the movie told how he was roused from bed in the middle of the night and was shot in the hand and leg by soldiers. He neglected to say that he had never been shot in the leg, that his hand wound was superficial, and that he was treated by army medics on the spot. Zangan and other Israeli doctors, upon examining him, saw that he had a chronic heart problem and he was then taken to Ha'emek Hospital in Afula and treated for three days for his heart problem and anemia.\n\nThe movie claims that a baby was shot dead and that medical attention was denied him by the Israelis. The body of such a baby was never found, nor was the child's name ever told to anyone. Where did he disappear to?\n\nStories about tanks crushing people, mass graves, air strikes, were all solemnly and mournfully detailed. The fact that no tanks crushed anyone, that there were no air strikes on Jenin, and that no mass graves exist in Jenin meant nothing to the filmmaker, who certainly had an agenda of his own, unrelated to the facts. The movie was shot in Jenin two weeks after the fact and the Palestinians \"prepared\" the sets in a most manipulative and distorted fashion.\n\nThe most disturbing thing to me is that when Zangan attempted to present these facts to the audience that saw the movie, he was hissed and booed off the stage. \"Murderer\" and \"war criminal\" were two of the milder epithets hurled at him. The Israelis present at the screening were so blinded by their disappointment at having been wrong about Yasser Arafat and the whole sorry \"peace\" mess that they turn their frustration inward at Jews who are trying to save their very lives.\n\nOf course, they will say that the Hebron massacre is all the fault of the \"settlers\" and that Jews have no rights to pray at the Cave of the Patriarchs. Jenin, Jenin will undoubtedly have a long and successful series of showings worldwide. After all, it is not anti-Israeli because it was made by Israelis. But us \"old Jews\" know better. We have seen this all before in every age and every struggle. Eventually, Hebron with all of its difficulties and sacrifices will survive, while Jenin, Jenin will be cast in the dust bin of all other false histories.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n(c) 2002 The Jerusalem Post\n\n[Note: Here is Dr. Zangan's eye-witness account of the Jenin \"massacre\" and his recounting of his futile attempt to present the true facts to a Jewish audience in Jerusalem who had just watched the Big Lie movie \"Jenin, Jenin\". Read on!]\n\nSEVEN LIES ABOUT JENIN\n\n(Article by Dr. David Zangen, Ma'ariv, November 8, 2002, Weekend Supplement)\n\nI watched Muhammad Bakri's film Jenin, Jenin in a limited forum, with Jerusalem Cinematheque Director Leah Van Leer and several journalists. After the private screening, I responded and indicated each lie and lack of credibility. One of those present at the screening was outraged: \"If you don't accept the facts in the film, you apparently don't understand anything; how can you be a doctor?\"\n\nFor a moment, I forgot that I had been in Jenin last April, serving as a regional brigade doctor, while this viewer had, at best, been fed on rumors. Bakri expertly weaves together lies and half-truths until it becomes very difficult not to be seduced by the distorted picture he creates.\n\nI did not succeed in convincing the Cinematheque management to cancel the screening. I was told that the pictures of destroyed homes were authentic and that there was, therefore, truth in the film, and that the film would be shown around the world in any case. Even so, I was invited to its premiere screening in Jerusalem and I arrived in order to explain my position to the audience. Following are several points that I wished to raise to the audience:\n\n1. Dr. Abu Riali, director of the hospital in Jenin, claims in the film that the western wing of the hospital was shelled and destroyed and that the IDF knowingly hit the hospital's water and power supplies. There never was any such wing and in any case, no part of the hospital was either shelled or blown up. IDF soldiers took care not to enter its grounds even though we knew that it was serving as a refuge for several wanted fugitives. We guarded the water, electricity and oxygen supplies to the hospital all throughout the fighting and assisted in setting up an emergency generator after the city's electrical system was damaged. Bakri himself is seen in the film wandering the hospital's clean and well-kept corridors, but not in the blown up wing. I met him outside the theater and asked him if he had visited the western wing. At first he said no, then he corrected himself and said, \"You remember one moment in the film with shattered glass -- it was from there.\" It is important to point out that this Abu Riali is one of the \"authorized sources\" for the claim of a \"massacre.\" At the beginning of the operation, he was interviewed on Al-Jazeera television and spoke of, \"thousands of victims.\"\n\n2. Another impressive part of the film is the interview with a male 75-year-old Jenin resident who mumbles and cries and tells how he was taken out of his bed in the middle of the night, shot in the hand, and after he failed to obey the soldiers' command to get up, was shot again in the foot. I met this very same old man as he was brought to me after an operation to clear one of the Hamas cells' houses in the refugee camp. He had indeed been lightly injured in the hand and was suffering from a minor scratch on the foot, but certainly not as the result of a bullet. IDF soldiers transferred him to a secure station that had been set up to treat wounded and there he was treated by me, among others. One of the military doctors identified diagnosed a heart problem. We suggested that he be transferred immediately to Haemek Hospital in Afula for treatment. He asked to be treated at the hospital in Jenin since he did not speak Hebrew. After the hospital refused to admit him, we transferred him to Afula and he stayed there for three days in the internal medicine department for treatment of his heart problems and the anemia that he suffered from as a result of another chronic illness.\n\n3. Another person who was interviewed spoke about a baby who suffered a chest wound from a bullet that entered through his chest and exited his body, creating a hole in his back. According to the film the baby died after IDF soldiers prevented his evacuation to hospital. A baby's body with this type of injury has never been found. Moreover, such an injury would have been fatal, and evacuation would not have saved his life. What is this baby's name? Where did his body disappear to?\n\n4. The same person interviewed also told how, using his finger, he opened the baby's airway in his neck after he was injured. Again, a complete lie. Such an action cannot be carried out with a finger. This \"witness\" adds that tanks ran over living people many times until they were completely crushed -- this never happened and is imaginary.\n\n5. The film mentions a mass gravesite that IDF soldiers dug for Palestinian dead. Every international organization that investigated the matter concur that there were 52 Palestinian dead in Jenin, and that all the bodies were returned to the Palestinians for burial. Bakri does not bother to show the supposed location of this mass gravesite.\n\n6. Israeli planes that supposedly bombed the city are mentioned in the film. There were no such planes. In order to prevent civilian casualties, only focused helicopter fire was used.\n\n7. It is interesting to note that Bakri was not present in Jenin at the time of the operation, and only arrived two weeks after it was completed. In pictures shot at the site in the center of Jenin, the damage appears much larger than it was in actual fact, and the martyrs' [suicide bombers'] pictures and jihad slogans -- which had been present at the time of the IDF military operation -- had disappeared from the walls of houses. The film systematically and repeatedly uses manipulative pictures of tanks taken in other locations, artificially placing them next to pictures of Palestinian children.\n\nIn general, this is a vulgar, but extremely well done, work of manipulation. At the conclusion of the film, hundreds of viewers gave Bakri and the film's editor a standing ovation. Bakri asked the audience if there were any questions. I presented myself, I went up to the stage and began to systematically list the lies and inaccuracies in the film.\n\nAt first there were whispers in the audience, and later scornful calls, and I was labeled a \"murderer,\" \"war criminal\" etc. I had barely succeeded in finishing my second point when a man in the audience aggressively came up on stage and tried to take the microphone out of my hand. I decided not to be dragged into violence. I allowed him to take the microphone and left the stage. I was surprised that only a few people stood up for my right to free speech and free expression. I was shocked that the audience was unwilling to hear the facts from someone who had physically been there.\n\nIt was difficult for me as a person, as a father and a doctor to hear calls of \"murderer\" from my people. I said that I did not kill anyone. But the calls became more heated, immense hatred was directed towards me. It left me with a hard feeling that has not subsided. I am not sorry that I went to the Cinematheque that evening. I am certain that in any case there were people who heard my doubts, and that this changed a small amount of their feelings towards the \"facts\" they saw. I am sure there were other people who were shocked at the intolerance demonstrated by the audience, but even so, it is hard for me [to accept] that they were the silent minority.\n\nAllow me to say what I was unable to say to those people that evening. I am proud that I was part of this excellent and ethical force that operated in Jenin, regular army soldiers and reservists with motivation and a fighting spirit, who went to destroy the terrorist infrastructure in its capital. Many suicide-bombers came from Jenin, and were responsible for the murder of the elderly, women and children on our streets. I am proud that we were there, that we fought, and I also am proud of the morality of the battle. The camp was not bombed from the air in order to prevent innocent civilian casualties, and artillery was not used even though we knew about specific areas in the [refugee] camp where terrorists were holing up. IDF soldiers fought against terrorists, and terrorists only. Before destroying a building where terrorist fire against our soldiers had originated from, as many warnings as could be allowed, were given, so that the people could leave without injury. The medical team administered medical aid to all casualties, even if they had Hamas tattoos on their hands. At no point was any person refused medical treatment.\n\nThis battle, heroic on one hand and ethical on the other, took a heavy toll from the best of our fighters! We who had to be there -- the soldiers that fell there, their families and the IDF -- do not deserve that Muhammad Bakri should incite the world to murder and hatred at our expense.\n\n[Note: Here are the true facts about the Spring 2002 assault on Jenin, launched in response to the horrific suicide bombing which murdered and maimed scores of innocents at a Passover seder in Netanya. Read on!]\n\nWhat happened in Jenin?\n\n[State of Israel] Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nhttp://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH0i9o0#jenin\n\nWhen the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) entered the refugee camp in the West Bank city of Jenin during Operation Defensive Shield, they encountered dozens of heavily armed terrorists shielding themselves behind Palestinian civilians. 23 Israeli soldiers, who risked their lives to avoid harming non-combatants, died in the fierce battle which ensued, while Palestinian casualties amounted to 56 (the vast majority of them armed terrorists). There were not hundreds or even thousands of civilian casualties, as the PA had originally claimed, and the Palestinian allegations of a 'massacre' were found to be completely baseless.\n\nJenin's terror industry -- with its command centers, explosives laboratories and arms caches -- has produced over two dozen suicide bombers and countless other armed terrorists. Prior to Operation Defensive Shield, the IDF had avoided entering Jenin's refugee camp, a small yet densely population section of the city. However, the appalling increase in attacks in March 2002 left Israel with no option but to strike at the terrorist infrastructure sheltered within the camp.\n\nJenin's refugee camp was not only a staging area of Palestinian suicide terrorism, it was also the site chosen by the armed terrorists to serve as a battleground against Israeli forces. These terrorists had prepared the field well, extensively booby-trapping houses and streets, and setting up sniper positions within civilian homes and structures. They acted with no regard for the safety of the camp's inhabitants or their property, and encouraged residents, including children, to take an active role in the fighting.\n\nShortly after the battle began, PA spokespersons proclaimed worldwide that Israeli forces had committed a \"massacre\" in Jenin. The Palestinians originally said that 3,000 civilians had been killed, but gradually reduced their claim to about 500. A few weeks later, after questions began to be raised in the international media, a high-ranking Fatah official was forced to admit that the death toll numbered only in the dozens. Kadoura Mousa Kadoura, the Director of the northern West Bank for Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, told reporters that his own investigation showed that 56 Palestinians had died in Jenin during the operation. These were largely armed fighters, killed during combat. The subsequent report by the UN Secretary General, which found no evidence of a massacre, could only verify 52 Palestinian casualties.\n\nThe \"Jenin massacre\" myth is particularly galling since the IDF took great care to avoid harming innocent non-combatants, even though this increased the exposure of its own soldiers to risk. The IDF chose to employ infantry in house-to-house sweeps rather than using heavier weapons which, while providing Israeli troops with greater security, would also increase the risk to the civilian Palestinian population. Israel paid a heavy price for this decision -- 23 Israeli soldiers were killed and dozens more were injured in the fierce close combat that ensued.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority's unfounded allegations of a massacre combined with misrepresentative television pictures of heavy damage -- which in actuality was confined to a limited section of the refugee camp -- persuaded the international community to embark upon a UN investigation of events in Jenin. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan then initiated the formation of a fact-finding team to develop accurate information regarding the events in Jenin. Due to its high regard for the UN Secretary General, Israel immediately announced its support for UN Security Council Resolution 1405,which welcomed the Secretary General's initiative.\n\nHowever, Israel believed that a number of points had to be clarified prior to the arrival of the team in order to safeguard the impartiality of the team's work. Israel believed that the team's mandate had to include an examination of Palestinian terrorism in the camp that created the necessity for Israel's military actions there. The right to self-defense, and the obligation to combat terrorism, could not be ignored. Israel expected that the Security Council definition of the mission as a \"fact-finding\" team would be preserved and that the practices of previous UN fact-finding efforts be maintained, including with regard to respect for the identity and rights of individuals providing information. While Israel had every intention of sharing information with the team, in the fight against terrorism, some information must remain classified and it would have been unreasonable to expect Israel to expose all of its security and operational secrets upon demand.\n\nAs satisfactory terms of reference could not be agreed upon, Secretary General Kofi Annan decided to disband the fact-finding team. By this time, respectable news outlets the world over and human rights organization finally confirmed what Israel had stated from the beginning -- that there had been no massacre in Jenin.\n\nUnfortunately, the Palestinians continue their attempts to perpetuate the Jenin massacre myth, often adding unfounded allegations regarding the denial of vital humanitarian aid. In clear contradiction to their own claims, the Palestinians often spread these lies in the same breath that they refer to the refugee camp as \"Jeningrad\", a modern Stalingrad-like last stand, and the site of a great and heroic battle.\n\n[Note: The Big Lie continues to prosper. This time its subject is Arab olive trees, cruelly hacked by Jewish settlers. Or were they merely zealously pruned by their Arab owners? Read on!]\n\n500 Palestinian olive trees destroyed; hack down olive groves\n\nBy Matthew Gutman\n\n(Jerusalem Post, November 3, 2003) It looked as if a lumberjack had run amok in the olive groves of the Palestinian village of Ein Abus, just south of Nablus.\n\nSome 500 olive trees on dozens of dunams of land had been hacked limbless over the weekend and last week, and on Sunday the Palestinian farmers unanimously pointed an accusatory finger at their neighbors on the hilltop: the settlers of Yitzhar.\n\nThis is the latest installment of an annual struggle between the fringes of the settlement movement and Palestinian olive harvesters across the West Bank. The IDF proudly stated that, as opposed to last year, it has managed to limit settler vandalism of Palestinian olive groves to only two or three incidents.\n\nBut that was not enough for Fauzi Hussein. Settlers from the unauthorized outpost of Mitzpe Yitzhar -- dismantled in July but since repopulated -- swooped down from their hilltop perch and hacked apart 255 of his olive trees, he says. The villagers only dare approach the hilltops near the settlements when accompanied by human rights groups and an IDF escort.\n\n\"I staked everything I had in those trees,\" pleaded Hussein, who had worked in Tel Aviv's tourist hot spot of Kikar Atarim for 23 years before the onset of the intifada. Hopping down from one of the mountain's ragged terraces to talk to a reporter, the 53-year-old Hussein said he had supported his entire family by his olive harvest, the bulk of which he sold to Saudi Arabia.\n\nStanding nearby, former deputy defense minister MK Ephraim Sneh (Labor), who hiked up to see the damage, said: \"This is the sort of crime that every Jew must condemn in the strongest terms. This is the only source of income for the destitute peasants of this village.\"\n\nSneh called for the immediate evacuation of Hill 725 and Mitzpe Yitzhar, both of which had been dismantled in the last five years, only to pop back up. The two outposts crown the hills surrounding the fertile valley where most of the villagers live.\n\nThe olive harvest lasts about a month and a half during the fall, and this year, said IDF Central Command spokesman Maj. Yoni Shenfeld, only a few incidents were registered. In the Hebron Hills, farmers accused settlers of stealing their crops and in the village of A-Sawiya settlers hacked down another 300 olive trees.\n\nShenfeld added that, despite the \"shocking uprooting and chopping of trees here,\" the villagers have been able to farm their 20,000 dumans of groves that sweep into the valley below largely undisturbed. About 50 dunams of trees were destroyed.\n\nFor their part, the settlers were unmoved by the incident. \"We don't know who did it. But what I do know is that when the Arabs creep close to the community for the harvest it becomes a security problem. We are very happy that from now on they will not be able to approach too close.\n\n\"Anyway, the trees grow back, and ultimately we hope to harvest them in the place of the unwanted inhabitants of the area,\" said Yitzhar community spokesman Yosi Peli in a telephone interview. When asked if they heard the chain saws on previous nights, the soldiers guarding Hill 725, just 100 meters up the hill from the olive groves, shrugged. They said they had heard nothing. The Judea and Samaria police expressed shock over the damaged trees and wondered how no one heard the chainsaws lopping them down.\n\nAs Hussein passionately highlighted the absurdity of the IDF declaring his plot of land a closed military area, but allowing settlers to live there, Capt. A, one of the soldiers guarding the harvesters burst out: \"Why doesn't Fauzi [Hussein] tell you about the five men in the village who planned to blow themselves up in Tel Aviv. Or that the last suicide bomber [who detonated himself at a Tulkarm checkpoint on October 9] was from the neighboring village of Uriff? Why doesn't he tell you about the posters of the shahids [martyrs] plastered in the elementary school classroom down there in the valley?\"\n\nDumbstruck, Hussein had no ready answer.\n\nRabbi Arik Ascherman, the chairman of Rabbis for Human Rights, tried to explain to the three soldiers that Palestinian violence does not justify the settlers' vandalism, and in fact only breeds more hatred.\n\nPicking up a lifeless branch from his grove, Nabil, 24, was sapped of hope. \"No olives, no money,\" he said in English. Later he explained that men of his generation \"do anything to get some work. When there is no work in the village, we walk across the border to Israel. When we cannot do that, some steal from Arabs and Jews. They also get themselves into other problems [by joining terrorist groups].\"\n\nA few members of the controversial International Solidarity Movement milled around chatting with the olive pickers, but they refused to be interviewed by anyone affiliated with The Jerusalem Post, they said.\n\nNabil's claim effectively sums up Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Moshe Ya'alon's misgivings about Israel's policy regarding the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. In messages leaked to the press, he argued that Israel was forging a generation of hatred through partially unnecessary closures and sieges which would eventually backfire.\n\nMore than 60% of Palestinians live on less than a $2 per day, according to most recent World Bank report. Human rights activists note that with the collapse of the Palestinian economy many villages have reverted to subsistence farming.\n\n\"Although many of these people in the [Jewish] settlements claim to be religious, apparently many verses found in my Torah are missing from theirs,\" said Ascherman.\n\n(©) The Jerusalem Post\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYESHA RESIDENTS DENY CUTTING TREES; ACCUSERS REFUSE LIE-DETECTOR TEST\n\n(Arutz Sheva, November 10, 2003) It led to anti-settler headlines, international embarrassment for the State of Israel, condemnations, and apologetics -- and yet it all may have been one big bluff, or worse.\n\nOn Nov. 3, the branches of hundreds of Arab-owned olive trees were found to have been cut down near the small Jewish community of Mitzpeh Yitzhar in the Shomron. Suspicions were immediately focused on the Jewish residents living nearby, and media reports and public officials took it for granted that they were responsible. The Jerusalem Post internet site reported on Nov. 7, \"Last week, settlers from settlements in northern Samaria hacked approximately 500 olive trees belonging to Palestinians,\" and on the same day, a Voice of America report by Iris Makler went even further by opening, \"Israeli settlers in the West Bank have destroyed olive trees belonging to Palestinian farmers in several areas in recent weeks...\"\n\nIsraeli officials, too, were quick to respond. President Katzav issued a sharp condemnation, saying that the \"struggle with the Palestinians ... must be conducted with good sense and integrity.\" Prime Minister Sharon said he views the matter with \"great gravity,\" adding that he had ordered the security establishment to \"take all possible measures\" to catch those responsible for uprooting the trees. A headline in Ynet quoted Labor MK Ephraim Sneh as saying, \"The Palestinians whose olive trees were cut down by settlers must be compensated.\" Even the Yesha Council of Rabbis fell into the trap, stating that that acts of vengeance carried out by individuals are forbidden and condemnable, and that the tree-cutting had \"defamed the entire sector of Jews living in Judea, Samaria and Gaza.\"\n\nThe story has taken a dramatic turn, however, though the mass media have largely ignored it. Police now feel that left-wing Israelis and the Arab tree-owners may have manufactured the entire incident as a provocation and a way to besmirch the Jewish population. The police have requested that Rabbi Arik Asherman of the Reform Movement and an Arab who both filed charges against Jewish Yesha residents submit to lie-detector tests -- but the two have, thus far, refused to do so.\n\nThe investigation began its about-face when a Jewish National Fund expert brought in by the police concluded that no lasting damage was done to the trees, and that the tree-cutters did not \"cut down\" the trees, but rather \"pruned\" them. The severed branches, he said, will begin growing back within 2-3 months. The police thereupon requested that those who filed the accusations against the Jews take lie-detector tests.\n\n\"If it is determined that we are speaking about a provocation in which someone cut these branches and then filed a false accusation with the police, then we are dealing with false testimony, which is a serious infraction,\" police superintendent Doron Ben-Ami said.\n\nResidents of the village of Yitzhar in Northern Shomron and environs have published a statement denying any connection to the cutting of the olive trees. In response to MK Ephraim Sneh and others, the residents wrote, \"There is not one bit of truth in these accusations, which are simply baseless slander.\"\n\nIt appears that one need not be a policeman to suspect that the entire story was nothing more than another form of anti-Jewish libel. Rabbi Elyakim Levanon of Elon Moreh said that he was told by \"official sources\" that the pruning involved \"dozens of hours of electric sawing.\" How is it, he asks, \"that no one heard? I heard that one of the Arabs said something like, 'we heard something, but we didn't pay attention.' This is a total put-on: how could it be that throughout hours and even days of work, an entire village heard nothing?! [It's possible] that the Arabs did it themselves, in the course of regular pruning, after which someone had the brilliant idea of blaming it on the Jews...\"\n\nAt the same time, Rabbi Levanon said that there are instances in which Jews would be permitted to cut down Arab trees. Asked what he thinks about Arabs harvesting their olives in proximity to Jewish communities during times of terrorist dangers, he said, \"It definitely should not be enabled, but the question is who must stop them. It's obvious that not every individual is permitted to make these decisions on his own. The general guidelines are that in a perimeter of 300 meters around each community, Arabs are simply not allowed to enter. If they do so, it becomes a matter of immediate self-defense, and in such a case, individuals are allowed to take action. They may even take action against the property -- i.e., olive trees -- of those who endanger them in this way... Not long ago, Arab olive harvesters reconnoitered a community in the Shomron and identified a break in the fence, through which terrorists infiltrated and murdered three precious Jews.\"\n\nAviad Vissuly, of the Haifa-area Land of Israel Movement, stated, \"It is incumbent upon Central Command O.C. Maj.-Gen. Moshe Kaplinsky to issue clear directives with regard to the [Arab] harvesting of olives on state-owned lands in areas adjacent to Jewish towns. This will eliminate the friction, misunderstandings, and vilification of Israel across the globe. For some unknown reason, Kaplinsky refuses to do so, and as a result, Jewish residents, the IDF and the State of Israel are vilified regularly by the press corps.\"\n\n[Note: The false report of olive tree hacking received worldwide publicity.

The papers claimed that settlers and IDF soldiers were seen setting loose many wild pigs near Palestinian villages as part of a campaign designed to destroy the Palestinian economy.\n\nA senior official in the Prime Minister's Office [of Israel] said that with these types of allegations, the PA was resorting \"to the same types of lies Yasser Arafat used to spread.\"\n\nAccording to this official, the allegations represented a pandering to the radical elements on the Palestinian street and not much attention should be paid to them.\n\nAt the same time, he said that if the PA was being dragged along by the radical elements, then \"the Palestinians are not on the way to a state, but rather to another intifada.\"\n\nAsked if he was not concerned about the frequency of these types of remarks recently, he said it was not clear whether they represented \"an ominous trend\" or were part of intra-Palestinian politics.\n\nBut, he said, as PA officials stray from reconciliation to comments of this type, \"there will be greater objection inside Israel about being able to move forward with the PA\" on a diplomatic track.\n\nComments such as these, as well as PA Foreign Minister Nasser al-Kidwa's remarks last week that the PA had no intention of dismantling the terror organizations, would not halt disengagement, the official said, but would raise questions about moving forward with any type of diplomatic process with the PA after the disengagement.\n\nThe latest charge was made by Dr. Youssef Abu Safiyeh, chairman of the PA's Environment Authority, who told Palestinian legislators in Ramallah that the PA security forces had recently seized a number of shipments from Israel that included canned juice containing a carcinogenic substance.\n\n\"These drinks are specifically produced for Palestinian consumers in the Gaza Strip,\" Abu Safiyeh said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Egyptian authorities last March intercepted two Israeli trucks carrying children's toys that included carcinogenic and radioactive substances. The trucks were seized at the Rafah border crossing, he added.\n\nAbu Safiyeh criticized the PA's law enforcement authorities for failing to prevent the import of second-hand Israeli commodities, including computers and other electrical appliances. He claimed that more than 200 computers previously used by the Defense Ministry had found their way to the markets of the Gaza Strip.\n\nOver the past few years, PA officials have repeatedly claimed that Israel was distributing corrupt food in Palestinian cities. They were quoted in the Palestinian media as saying that the Israeli government was selling expired food products to Palestinians with the intention of spreading various diseases among them.\n\nIn 2001, the PA claimed that Israel was responsible for poisoned chocolates and explosive toys, pens and radios that appeared in markets in the Gaza Strip.\n\nDoctors at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City said then that they had treated several children who were allegedly poisoned after touching candy bars.\n\nOther doctors have blamed Israel for a reported rise in cases of cancerous diseases, heart disorders, paralysis and blindness.\n\n(©) The Jerusalem Post\n\n[Note: Apparently, it is not enough that Israel is poisoning the People.

The Israeli government will keep the Karni [commercial] crossing working as it is now but with introducing some advanced technologies,\" Dahlan claimed.\n\nHe also claimed that Israel was not interested in having contiguity between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank because it prefers the current situation to remain as it is after the withdrawal. \"The Israeli government doesn't understand the issue of the airport and they don't want us to use it or fix it or even reopen it after the withdrawal,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the smuggling operations across the Egyptian border, Dahlan suggested that a third party should be involved in this issue to make sure that no weapons are smuggled into the Gaza Strip.\n\nHe described the recent meeting in Jerusalem between PA chairman Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as \"bad,\" adding that it had increased Palestinians' fears that Israel was planning to renege on the understandings reached earlier this year at the Sharm e-Sheikh summit.\n\nDahlan urged all Palestinian factions to coordinate with the PA their moves ahead of the withdrawal.\n\n\"These factions have not given responses yet as to whether they want to work with us,\" Dahlan said, adding that the \"window of opportunity\" was still open for all the groups.\n\nDahlan also called on Hamas and Islamic Jihad to consider joining a PA \"national unity\" cabinet.\n\n(©) The Jerusalem Post\n\n[Note: Again with the poisoning?

He did not specify the type of toxins, but claimed that they were placed in large barrels underground.\n\n\"They want to destroy the land to prevent the Palestinians from using it after it's handed over to the Palestinian Authority,\" he said. \"We call on all those who support our people to expose this matter and to help us deal with it.\"\n\nQadih also claimed that Israel was stealing water and sand from Gush Katif.\n\n\"This won't deter us from abiding by our rights and lands,\" he cautioned.

Yet, if Israel has really poisoned the Land, then it stands to reason that the sand and water which Israel has allegedly stolen is also poisoned and, consequently, unusable. So, why would Israel want to steal toxic sand and water from Gaza? Furthermore, since more than 60% of Israel is desert, why would Israel need (or want) to steal any sand (whether clean or toxic) from Gaza? Moreover, since Gaza suffers from a chronic shortage of potable water, how would Israel manage to steal any of it?

Shlomi Sagi, spokesman for the Judea and Samaria Police Department, after police investigators responded to claims from the village that settlers hacked down trees. 'We are investigating the claims of both sides.'\n\nPolice have no evidence of foul play by either the settlers or the Palestinians in this incident. However, several factors stumped investigators, according to Sagi. Police wondered why the settlers would trek to the far side of the orchard, the side nearest the Palestinians, to chop down the trees. They also wondered why chainsaw-wielding settlers would give the trees 'a grave pruning' rather than cut through the tree trunks.\n\n[Note: There have been several opinion articles in Israels secular press which uncritically accept the claim that Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria have destroyed thousands of Palestinian olive trees and assert that such vandalism constitutes a violation of Gods Commandment prohibiting the destruction in time of War of trees which produce fruit or contain other edible components. The Divine Prohibition reads, in full, as follows: When you besiege a city for many days to wage war against it to seize it, do not destroy its trees by swinging an axe against them, for from it you will eat, and you shall not cut it down -- is the tree of the field [equivalent to] a man that it should enter the siege before you? Only a tree that you know is not a food tree, it you may destroy and cut down, and build a bulwark against the city that makes war with you, until it is conquered. (Deut. 20:19-20). A careful reading of these passages shows that the Prohibition is against destroying such trees only during purely offensive operations, meaning that fruit trees may be destroyed in order to protect and defend Jewish life, but not in order to take Gentile life (unless the former can only be accomplished by the latter). So, for example, when, from time to time, Arab terrorists have used olive tree groves as cover for surveilling and/or attacking adjacent Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria, these aggressors have created a situation where the Torah (and its Author) would permit the destruction of strategic portions of those groves in order to protect and defend Jewish lives. -- Mark Rosenblit]\n\n[Even Israel -- to the delight of its many enemies -- sometimes promotes the Big Lie. Read on!]\n\nColumn One: 'Cool' anti-Semitism\n\nBy Caroline Glick\n\n(Jerusalem Post, January 22, 2006) It's official: Anti-Semitism is \"in.\" The decision to award the Palestinian film Paradise Now the Golden Globes Award for best foreign film tells us that Palestinian terror against Israelis has become so acceptable that it is now Hollywood kitsch. The sight of the Jewish American diva Sarah Jessica Parker, of Sex in the City [TV series] fame, excitedly announcing that a film which glorifies the mass murder of Jews in Israel was the big winner for 2005 only served to demonstrate how deep this trivialization of evil now runs.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was reported that the Jordanian border police have adopted a new policy regarding the entry of Israeli tourists into the Hashemite Kingdom. Any Israeli trying to enter Jordan will be turned away at the border if he is wearing or carrying any Jewish religious paraphernalia. This anti-Semitic policy, the Jordanian authorities explain, stems from security concerns. Jews, after all, are prized targets for terrorists. By this reasoning, stopping people with overtly Jewish appearances, or who have Jewish ritual articles in their luggage, is a friendly gesture.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry is not pleased with this newest Jordanian move. Israeli officials are reportedly trying to reverse the new orders. The Israeli protest is ironic because the government itself uses similar justifications for its policy of prohibiting Jews from praying on the Temple Mount. The government claims that Jews are forbidden from worshipping at Judaism's holiest site because allowing Jewish worship entails security risks.\n\nIt is hard to muster much righteous wrath towards the Golden Globes gang for granting their prize to a movie that extols the virtues of mass murderers of Jews. Today the official policy of the Israeli government regarding the status and rights of Jews in Judea and Samaria is itself based on anti-Semitic foundations.\n\nCase in point is the government's handling of the Jewish \"squatters\" in the former marketplace in Hebron. The property in dispute is owned by a Jewish trust -- the Magen Avot Sephardic Community -- which purchased the land 199 years ago. Today, the Magen Avot Sephardic Community is headed by former Sephardic chief rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu. The Community wants the property to be used to house Jews.\n\nOn the face of it, it all seems rather cut and dried. The area is directly adjacent to the Jewish Avraham Avinu neighborhood. It is owned by Jews who want its current Jewish residents to remain in place. Why would the government have a problem with eight Jewish families living in the former shops in full accord with the expressed wishes of the property's owner?\n\nOn Tuesday morning I asked Lieutenant Assaf Azoulay, the spokesman for the Judea and Samaria Division, this question during a visit to Hebron. Azoulay responded angrily, \"It's an issue of the supremacy of law!\" He then proceeded to shout that the Supreme Court ordered that the Jews be expelled from the former shops and the IDF's job is to implement the high court's ruling.\n\nThe problem is that the Supreme Court never held a hearing on the issue and certainly never made a decision on the matter. Palestinians did petition the court some five years ago, asking that the Jews who had \"squatted\" in the stores -- that have been empty since 1994 and since replaced by new shops built by the Hebron municipality -- be expelled. The issue was argued before the appeals committee of the Civil Administration in Judea and Samaria two years ago.\n\nIn their ruling, the military judges tended to accept the recommendation to allow the Jews to rent the property in accordance with the wishes of the property's owners. But the judges' common sense clashed with the state prosecution's world view. Last October, for no apparent reason, Attorney-General Menachem Mazuz decided that the Jewish families must be removed from the shops no later than February 15.\n\nAnd here we arrive at the main issue. In 1949, after conquering Judea and Samaria, the Jordanian regime seized all Jewish owned lands and placed them under the control of the Jordanian Custodian for Enemy Property. Jews were, by law, prohibited from entering the areas. In 1967, after Israel took control of Judea and Samaria, the government transferred control over the seized Jewish lands to the Custodian for Absentee Lands in the Civil Administration.\n\nThe question arises, why did the government not simply allow the Jewish land owners to reassert their rights over their lands? Israel's refusal to enable Jewish landowners in Judea and Samaria to exercise their rights over their private property constitutes an Israeli adoption of the anti-Semitic Jordanian legal regime which denied all Jewish property rights in Judea and Samaria.\n\nON THE face of it, this past Monday those who believe that Jewish civil and property rights in Judea and Samaria should be defended scored a major victory at the district courthouse in Kfar Saba. There on Monday afternoon, District Court Judge Navah Bechor acquitted Mr. Avri Ran of charges of aggravated assault against an Arab who trespassed onto his clover field on March 20, 2005.\n\nRan, the owner of the \"Eternal Hills\" organic ranch in Samaria, was indicted last spring on charges of aggravated assault of an Arab named Hader Masalam Abu Haniyeh from the village of Hirbat Yanoun. Since the altercation 10 months ago, Ran has been prohibited from entering Judea and Samaria. For the past five months he has been jailed pending the conclusion of his trial due to the prosecution's claim that his \"ideological zeal\" rendered him a danger to the public.\n\nRan asserted that, abetted by [Jewish] extremist leftist activists, Abu Haniyeh and his associate Amar Abu Shehadeh trespassed on his field with a tractor with the purpose of destroying his crop two months before the harvest. He maintained that he and three of his employees had gone to the field on the morning of March 20 to prevent the two men from harming his crop. Disturbingly, both the police and the state prosecutors refused to investigate Ran's version of events. They adamantly insisted that Ran and his men had brutally assaulted the two Arabs, and accepted the Arabs' statement that Ran and his men had a history of abusing their Arab neighbors, who never caused them any harm.\n\nDuring Ran's three month trial, the police and prosecution's claims against Ran and his three employees completely unraveled. At a hearing on December 1, Ran's attorney presented a film produced in November by a French television crew where the Abu Haniyeh and Abu Shehadeh gave a candid version of the events of March 20. On film, to a sympathetic reporter, they explained that extremist leftist activists from Israel and abroad had distributed photographs of Ran to Arab villagers and asked them to provoke Ran by trespassing on his field and by filing complaints against him with the police. In his court testimony, under cross examination, Abu Haniyeh admitted that accompanied by these leftist activists, Arabs from Yanoun routinely entered Ran's field with the aim of destroying his crop. Abu Haniyeh further admitted that not only had Ran \"not assaulted him,\" but that \"I was instructed that anytime that Avri was in the area, I had to exaggerate what happened and get Avri in trouble.\"\n\nIn her ruling, Judge Bechor noted that in his testimony before the court, Bentzi Kessler, the Civil Administration's land supervisor for the Nablus district, \"stated that [Ran] has cultivated the clover field at least since 2000 and that his ownership of the area stems from his proprietorship of the area, and that land sellers to Jews are afraid to admit that he owns the land for fear that they will be killed.\" The judge further noted that the police knew that Ran owned the field because Kessler \"had stated his opinion on the matter in the past to two police investigators who questioned him on the issue.\"\n\nJudge Bechor issued stinging criticism of the police in the Samaria and Judea district for their \"tendentious\" conduct of the investigation. In her closing paragraph the judge warned, \"It would be hoped that in the future, the police will conduct its investigations of similar instances without being locked into preconceived notions and by truly clarifying all the sides' versions of the events.\"\n\nAlthough, Bechor's ruling shows that there are judges in Israel who believe that the law should be enforced without prejudice, no solace can be taken from this fact. Over the past 10 months, at the insistence of the state prosecution and the police, two Supreme Court justices -- Edna Arbel and Esther Hayut -- saw fit to jail Ran pending the conclusion of his trial. They based their decisions on the prosecution's claim that Ran's ideological beliefs rendered him a danger to society.\n\nYet, the protocols of his trial and Judge Bechor's judgment expose an opposite reality. Extremist leftist activists, together with local Arabs, with the backing of the police and the state prosecutors, staged a provocation with the intent of criminalizing Ran and his men who had done nothing but exert their legal right to defend their private property from trespass and destruction. The fact of the matter is that Ran, who was innocent of any wrongdoing, was jailed for five months and kept from his family and his land for 10 months.\n\nTHE REALITY that is exposed both by the Ran trial and the current dispute over Jewish property rights in Hebron is that the question of whether Jews do or do not have rights to their property is a question of policy and politics, not a question of law. Is Israeli society ready to change the current policy? Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is betting that the answer is no. He thinks that just as anti-Semitism is \"in\" in Hollywood, so too it is \"in\" in Israel.\n\nAnd so it is that as terror groups ratchet up their activities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza and exact their toll in Jewish blood in Tel Aviv, Olmert is fashioning his political campaign around a war against \"Jewish hooligans.\" On Wednesday, Olmert angrily ordered the police and the IDF to take \"all necessary measures\" to, not only eject the Jews from the disputed shops in Hebron, but to stop attempting to reach an agreement with them. He further instructed the military and police brass to make plans to expel Jews from eight communities that are considered \"unauthorized\" because the current government refuses to acknowledge the rights of Jews to build in Judea and Samaria. At the same time, Olmert has announced his intention to waive the road map's requirement for the Palestinians to destroy terror groups by expressing his willingness to open negotiations with the Palestinians even as they prepare to convene a parliament packed with terrorists.\n\nIs Israel about to adopt a policy of fighting Jews rather than defending them against Palestinian terrorists? We'll know the answer to that question on March 28 when Israelis go to the polls and elect their next government.\n\n(©) The Jerusalem Post\n\n[The Big Lie never dies; it only gets reinvented! Read on!]\n\nON LINE opinion -- Australia's e-journal of social and political debate\n\nGaza beach -- when politics trumps human rights\n\nBy Gerald Steinberg\n\nFriday, 23 June 2006\n\nThe debate over the cause of the explosion on a Gaza beach, on June 9 which killed eight Palestinian civilians, has become a cause célèbre among human rights groups, journalists and politicians. In Cairo, London, Moscow, New York and Sydney, activists and politicians have condemned Israels excessive and brutal military tactics. The UN secretary-general, the British Foreign Secretary and other foreign leaders immediately joined the Palestinians in blaming Israel for the explosion and tragic deaths, and the movement for another anti-Israel UN resolution began.\n\nThese condemnations have been magnified by the efforts of human rights organisations, particularly a group known as Human Rights Watch (HRW).\n\nWithin a few hours of the Palestinian reports, HRW announced its own investigation of the incident, and within a week, had issued three press releases.\n\nThe first left no room for doubt -- the Palestinians had been killed by an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) 155 mm artillery shell fired in response to Palestinian missile attacks. These findings were widely quoted by the international media and have had significant impact in shaping the public perception of the incident.\n\nHowever, the Israeli military launched its own investigation, producing detailed evidence that the evidence presented by the Palestinians and HRW was doctored.\n\nThe shrapnel wounds from two gravely injured Palestinian victims taken to Israeli hospitals for treatment (notably omitted in all of HRW's reports) were not from 155mm shells. (Doctors reported that before they arrived in Israel [for free medical treatment], the victims had undergone extensive surgery apparently in a failed effort to remove these metal pieces [in order to prevent Israel from examining these pieces and consequently proving that they did not come from Israeli shells].)\n\nQuestions were also raised about the evidence allegedly presented by the Palestinian police and independent journalists which provided the basis for the condemnation of Israel. A Palestinian video, allegedly showing Israeli naval ships firing at Gaza, was exposed as a fake and led to confusion on the alleged source of the explosion. Others suggested that the [completely uninjured] girl shown in the video frantically calling for her father was acting: the cameraman claimed she had been in the water at the time of the explosion, however her clothes were completely dry.\n\nFaced with this evidence and the contradictions, HRW's self-proclaimed \"military expert\" backtracked, now claiming \"the most likely cause [of the blast] was unexploded Israeli ordinance\". The more likely explanation -- that the explosion was the result of a Palestinian mine -- was politically unacceptable for HRW's officials.\n\nWhile the details of the Gaza beach incident remain subject to debate, the political agenda that has distorted human rights around the world is clear.\n\nAfter the Gaza beach incident on June 9, 68 civilians on a bus were killed by a land mine reportedly planted by the Tamil Tigers in northern Sri Lanka, 30 civilians were killed by the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, and tribesman in the restive Pakistani province of Balochistan claimed that Pakistani forces had killed 17 civilians in an ongoing military operation in the region. These have not received even a cursory report by groups such as Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International. HRW also failed to call for independent investigations in these cases -- such treatment is apparently reserved for Israel.\n\nThis incident has also exposed the power of the human rights organizations to influence public opinion. As a result of the \"halo effect\", journalists rarely question the credibility of NGOs. Enjoying Special Consultative status at the UN, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are able to parlay their huge budgets directly into political influence. If these and other human rights organizations are to retain their credibility, political campaigns on behalf of Palestinians or any other groups must end.\n\nRelated links:\n\nBBC website article, where Israel was blamed;\n\nBBC video clip where the El Wattan material was shown;\n\na technical analysis of the original video from Palestinian Media Watch;\n\nhere are links to various other early reports, where Israel was blamed: Sky, Reuters, Independent, Telegraph, Times, Times, Guardian; and\n\nother articles from around the world.\n\nGerald Steinberg is a Professor of Political Studies at Bar Ilan University, directs the Interdisciplinary Program on Conflict Management and Negotiation, heads NGO Monitor and is a Senior Research Associate at the BESA Center for Strategic Studies.\n\n© The National Forum and contributors 1999-2006.

Read on!]\n\nReutersgate strikes other news outlets\n\nBy Sheera Claire Frenkel\n\n(Jerusalem Post, August 11, 2006) At first everyone thought they were just blowing smoke, but the debunking of a Reuters photograph by a group of Web sites has launched a fiery online war in which bloggers have taken on the mainstream media.\n\nBloggers, or writers on web logs, were the first to reveal that a Reuters photograph depicting plumes of black smoke rising over Beirut was doctored to enhance smoke above the city. The Web site www.LittleGreenFootballs.com is credited with first revealing the scandal, which has been dubbed Reutersgate, but the affair has spread far wider than the Reuters News Agency and into several of the most esteemed media outlets.\n\nMore than a dozen accusations of staged or doctored photographs have made their way through various Web sites in the past several weeks. None has been treated by the news outlets as seriously as the original Reuters incident, which saw the photographer Adnin Hajj fired and over 900 of his photos removed from the Reuters wire list. But numerous other outlets -- including the BBC, The New York Times and AP -- have been forced to recall photos or change captions following inaccuracies pointed out in online forums.\n\nThe fact that the online community rather than fellow mainstream media has become a watchdog of accuracy has surprised many who originally derided blogs as being \"devoid of accuracy.\"\n\n\"In a blog you don't have to be accurate to anyone but yourself and your readers,\" said Laya Millman from the Jewlicious.com blog. \"There is a great deal of accountability because, if you get anything wrong, the readers will quickly, very quickly, point it out.\"\n\nAs was demonstrated in the case with the Reuters photograph, blogs come with their own teams of investigators: the thousands of readers who stream through the site. Within hours of Charles Johnson's posting on Little Green Footballs, readers of the Web site had gone to work uncovering an array of damning evidence against Hajj, the most serious of which -- a second doctored photograph, an Israeli plane altered to make it look as though it was dropping a series of bombs -- may have pushed Reuters to fire Hajj after initially announcing that the freelance photographer would be suspended. That photograph, which was discovered by blogger Rusty Shackleford of The Jawa Report, included an illustrated account of how the photos had been doctored.\n\nPhotographs whose veracity has been questioned by blogs in the past few weeks since Reutersgate began include:\n\nTwo pictures used by The Associated Press and Reuters, in which the same woman appeared to be crying over the destruction of her Beirut home. Distinguished by a red-checkered scarf and scar on her right cheek, the woman was pictured crying in front of two different locations two weeks apart.\n\nSeveral photographs of a bombed bridge in Beirut which appear on Reuters and AFP with the different captions stating that the bridge had been bombed on July 18, July 24 and August 5. Bloggers claim that the striking image was photographed to look like several different bombings in order to make destruction in Beirut appear more severe.\n\nIn The New York Times photo essay \"Attack on Tyre,\" a photograph of a man who appears dead is accompanied with the caption reading \"bodies were still buried under the rubble.\" However, in a later photograph in the same series, the same man appears to be walking in the foreground of a photo. The Times issued a correction for the first photograph, stating that the man was injured.\n\nSome claim that the online controversy over the photos has gotten out of hand, with many blogs now launching investigations and hurling accusations at a variety of news sources.\n\n\"These accusations can be very damning, and need to be handled with care and not thrown out by any angry blogger,\" said one anonymous poster on Little Green Footballs.\n\nIn the meantime, however, Little Green Footballs -- along with many other online forums -- has been flooded with investigations into mainstream media, with the entire army of its hundreds of thousands of readers eagerly at hand.\n\n(©) The Jerusalem Post\n\n[More on fabricated claims of olive grove destructions.

At times even IDF soldiers and police had to protect the Palestinians farmers in the territories during the olive harvest season. But the police suspect now that in some cases the Palestinians themselves are those cutting the trees and then blamed the settlers and demanded compensation from the Civil Authority.\n\nForesters of the JNF patrolling the Shaar Efraim area today noticed to their surprise a number of Palestinians cutting olive trees in violation of the law as they were damaging scores of olive trees. The foresters hurried to call the police who arrived and held four of them for questioning.\n\nThe four were transferred to the police station in Kedumim and in their interrogation they said that the owner of the property invited them to cut the trees for firewood. A police spokesman for the Judea-Samaria District, Superintendent Pintzi Mor, told Maariv NRG that the owner of the area would be called in for questioning.\n\nSources in the police said that over the years the police have experienced a phenomenon of the filing of complaints to the Civil Authority regarding the destruction of olive trees, along with a claim for financial compensation. In the last year alone the Palestinians in the area of Judea and Samaria filed claims for 350 thousand shekels for the destruction of olive trees.\n\nThe police now intend to check the complaints in detail. A senior source in the police told Maariv NRG that \"most of the complaints for damage to olive trees were filed in recent years at the end of the harvest season or towards the end, something that increase the suspicion that this is a cooked deal.\"\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIMRA - Independent Media Review and Analysis\n\nWebsite: www.imra.org.il\n\n[Note: The Big Lie that demonized Israel at the very beginning of the so-called Second Intifada was finally unmasked by a courageous journalist who challenged the French media giant that created and broadcast the hateful mendacity. Read on!]\n\nPalestinian Propaganda Coup\n\nBy NATAN SHARANSKY\n\nOctober 2, 2007\n\nLast month, a French court heard an appeals case whose forthcoming verdict will have far-reaching ramifications for all who value truth and accuracy in Middle East news reporting. The case involves Philippe Karsenty, a French journalist and media commentator, who was found guilty of defamation after he called for the firing of two France 2 Television journalists responsible for the Sept. 30, 2000, news report on the alleged killing of a 12-year-old Palestinian boy, Mohammed al-Dura, by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\n\nIt has been seven years since France 2 Television broadcast the excruciating footage of Mohammed and his father Jamal crouching in terror behind a barrel in Gaza's Netzarim Junction while, according to the report, under relentless fire from IDF soldiers. The 59-second clip, which ends with the boy apparently shot dead, was presented around the world as an unambiguous case of Israeli savagery.\n\nThe tape fanned the flames of what became known as the second intifada. The boy Mohammed was the iconic martyr, his name and face gracing streets, parks and postage stamps across the Arab world. His memory was invoked by Osama bin Laden in a jihadist screed against America, and in the ghastly video of the beheading of American Jewish journalist, Daniel Pearl.\n\nShortly following the al-Dura incident, however, a series of inquiries cast grave doubt on the accuracy of the original France 2 report. The official IDF investigation concluded that, based on the position of IDF forces vis-à-vis the Duras, it was highly improbable, if not impossible, that an Israeli bullet hit the boy. Research by the Atlantic Monthly, the New Republic and Commentary magazine concurred. Then a German documentary revealed inconsistencies and probable manipulations in the account of France 2's lone journalist on the scene that day, Palestinian cameraman Talal Abu Rahmeh.\n\nAnd yet France 2 refused to release Abu Rahmeh's full 27 minutes of raw footage. It did, however, agree to let three prominent French journalists view the footage. All three concluded that it comprised blatantly staged scenes of Palestinians being shot by Israeli forces, and that France 2's Jerusalem Bureau Chief Charles Enderlin had lied to conceal that fact.\n\nSubsequently, alleging gross malfeasance, Mr. Karsenty called for the firings of Mr. Enderlin and France 2 News Director Arlette Chabot. But France 2 stood defiant, suing Mr. Karsenty for defamation.\n\nThe defamation trial passed almost unnoticed in Israel, to the apparent detriment of Mr. Karsenty's case. In his ruling in favor of France 2, judge Joël Boyer five times cited the absence of any official Israeli support for Mr. Karsenty's claims as indication of their speciousness.\n\nIsrael's decision to stay on the sidelines was unfortunate because the truth always matters. The al-Dura incident wasn't the only media report to inflame passions against Israel in recent years, but it was the one with the highest profile. Moreover, if, as Mr. Karsenty and others have claimed persuasively, the al-Dura incident is part of the insidious trend in which Western media outlets allow themselves to be manipulated by dishonest and politically motivated sources (recall the Jenin \"massacre\" that never was, or the doctored Reuters photos from Israel's war against Hezbollah in 2006), then France 2 must be held accountable.\n\nIt is important to note that the al-Dura news report profoundly influenced Western public opinion. When I served in the Israeli government as minister of Diaspora Affairs from 2003 to 2005, I traveled frequently to North American college campuses. I heard first hand how Mohammed al-Dura had shaped the perceptions of young people just beginning to follow events in the Middle East. For many Jewish students, the incident was a stain of dishonor that called into question their support for Israel. For anti-Israel students, the story reaffirmed their sense of Zionism's innately \"racist\" nature and became a tool for recruiting campus peers to the cause.\n\nTo its credit, Israel has come to recognize that it must play an active role in uncovering the truth. The IDF recently sent a letter to France 2 demanding the release of Talal Abu Rahmeh's 27 minutes of raw footage, asserting the implausibility of IDF guilt for the death of Mohammad al-Dura, and raising the possibility that the entire affair may have been staged.\n\nTragically, there is no way to repair the damage inflicted on Israel's international image by the France 2 report, much less restore the Israeli and Jewish victims whose lives were exacted as vengeance. It is possible, however, to deter slanderous news reporting -- and the violence that often accompanies it -- by setting a precedent for media accountability via the handover of Talal Abu Rahmeh's full 27 minutes of raw footage. Encouragingly, the judge presiding over Mr. Karsenty's appeal has now requested the tapes. France 2 must make a full public disclosure. If there is nothing to hide, why should it refuse?\n\nMr. Sharansky is chairman of the Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies at the Shalem Center in Jerusalem.\n\nCopyright 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Read on!]\n\nMyth & Muhammad al-Dura\n\nLast week, a surprising decision handed down by the French Court of Appeals shed rare light on how both news and myths are made in this part of the world.\n\nOn September 30, 2000, two days after prime minister Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy, Muhammad al-Dura, was filmed cowering with his father, Jalal, at the Gaza Strip's Netzarim junction during an apparent gun battle between Palestinians and IDF troops.\n\nThe video, taken by Palestinian cameraman and France 2 stringer Talal Abu Rahma, shows al-Dura hiding, and then cuts to footage of him lying, apparently dead, in the arms of his distraught father. Although he was not in Gaza that day, France 2's correspondent Charles Enderlin (a French Jew who became an Israeli citizen some 20 years ago) added a voice-over narration, ascribing the boy's death to \"gunfire from the direction of the Israeli positions,\" and released his report to the World.\n\nThe effect of the image of wounded father and murdered son, a kind of modern pieta taken as a potent symbol of Israeli brutality, was electrifying. Al-Dura's death, a cause celebre of the second intifada, provoked worldwide outrage. Streets, public squares, and schools in Muslim cities bore his name. He was featured on a Tunisian stamp, a poem by Mahmoud Darwish, and an al-Qaida recruitment video. \"In killing this boy the Israelis killed every child in the world,\" Osama bin Laden said. In June 2005, Wafa Samir al-Bis, an aspiring 21-year-old \"martyr,\" after being apprehended by Israeli guards at the Erez checkpoint in Gaza with 20 pounds of explosives in her underwear, said that she intended to carry out a suicide attack to retaliate for al-Dura's death.\n\nBUT THE video report -- 55 seconds of footage out of some 18 minutes that were shown in court -- also aroused doubts. It does not show the boy being killed. No bullets are seen hitting the alleged victims. No blood is visible on their clothes, on the wall, or on the ground. It never shows Israeli soldiers aiming at the al-Duras. More than a dozen cameramen filmed the junction that day. Reuters, AP, and France-2 outtakes show apparently staged scenes and faked ambulance runs.\n\nThe IDF, which initially apologized for the death of al-Dura, concluded that the boy could not have been hit by Israeli bullets. Citing the findings of the army's probe into the incident, ordered by then-OC Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Yom Tov Samia, the deputy commander of the IDF Spokesman's Office, Col. Shlomi Am-Shalom wrote, \"we can rule out with the greatest certainty the possibility that the gunfire that apparently harmed the boy and his father was fired by IDF soldiers.\"\n\nFrance 2 stuck to its story. On October 3, 2000, testifying under oath before the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, Talal Abu Rahmeh alleged that Israeli soldiers had intentionally murdered the boy. The station also initiated libel suits against several writers and Web sites who challenged the veracity of its story.\n\nOne of the defendants was Philippe Karsenty, director of the Media-Ratings watchdog site, who had called the report \"a hoax.\" France 2 won three out of four judgments, including against Karsenty, who was convicted of libel in 2006. Last week, to bring matters around full circle, the appellate court overturned that decision.\n\nTHE RECENT verdict, besides usefully underscoring the right to criticize the press and its sometimes dangerously hasty product, also calls much-needed attention to the ways in which world opinion is shaped by perceptions that are themselves shaped by a not infallible media. The al-Dura affair, like the myth of a massacre in Jenin in April 2002, has been so fervently seized by those who seek confirmation for their belief in Israeli culpability, that it is likely never to be erased from international consciousness. It by now stands well beyond the reach of refutation.\n\nThat fact ought to give pause to Israeli officials, like Israeli ambassador to Paris Danny Sheck, who criticized Karsenty for so doggedly pursuing the matter. As for the rest of us, the sordid affair teaches a valuable lesson about the dangerous enthusiasms, especially in Muslim societies, and especially among those who claim to speak for an awakened conscience, for modern myths of Jewish evil.\n\nCopyright 1995- 2008 The Jerusalem Post\n\n[Note: The foregoing Editorial touches upon, but inadequately analyzes, the crucial distinction between those who support the Palestinian Arab Cause (i.e., its maximalist demands, the main ones being: (1) Israels withdrawal to its 1949 armistice demarcation lines, (2) the expulsion of almost 500,000 Jews from their homes in Judea, Samaria and the eastern portion of Jerusalem, and (3) and the admittance of over 4,000,000 hostile Arabs into a shrunken Israel) and those who support Israels continued existence as a Jewish nation-state within internationally-recognized borders. Advocates of the Palestinian Arab Cause, whether they be nations, non-governmental organizations (e.g., Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, Oxfam, etc.), various trade unions, various academic unions or influential personalities, support this Cause unconditionally, that is: irrespective of the nature or frequency of the terroristic atrocities that the Palestinian Arabs have perpetuated -- and will continue to perpetuate -- against Israels civilian population centers. In practical terms, this means that the Palestinian Arabs can murder Jews by any means available to them (including by suicide bomber, mortar fire, rocket fire and sniper fire) without fear of being condemned by the vast majority of their allies -- let alone being abandoned by any of their allies; and the Palestinian Arabs, being well aware of this circumstance, consequently do not feel any need to reduce -- let alone to cease -- such atrocities. In contrast, the vast majority of the advocates of the Jewish States Cause (and all national advocates thereof) support this Cause conditionally, that is: only if Israel conforms to ethereal standards of restrained behavior. In practical terms, this means that Israel would be publicly excoriated, if not abandoned, by the vast majority of its allies (and all of its national allies) if it actually responded in kind to the continuous stream of Palestinian Arab crimes being perpetuated against it; and Israel, being well aware of this asymmetry, consequently attempts to limit its retaliation against the Palestinian Arabs to that level of counterforce that it believes -- often mistakenly -- will not cause an avalanche of public condemnation from its national and other allies. That is precisely why, between the time that Israel is falsely accused of an atrocity and the time that Israel is able to disprove such accusation, Israel is nevertheless condemned for it, not only by those allies of the Palestinian Arabs who seek Israels destruction, but also by those allies of the Palestinian Arabs (e.g., the United States and Europe) who also identify themselves as allies of the Jewish State. In contrast, the Palestinian Arabs can always rely upon their advocates to treat their atrocities -- of which they publicly boast and which they publicly celebrate -- as being justifiable (or, for those who support both the Palestinian Arabs and Israel, at least being understandable). Moreover, the Palestinian Arabs can also rely upon Israels national allies (who, of course, are also the Palestinian Arabs national allies) not to ever treat Palestinian Arab atrocities as a reason for reducing -- let alone severing -- their diplomatic relations with, and generous economic assistance to, the Palestinian Arabs. The motivational distinction between Israels national allies (all of whom support both parties) and the vast majority of the Palestinian Arabs national allies (who support only the latter party) may be essentially described as follows: The goal motivating all of Israels national allies is Peace (although this goal can be imagined by these nations only because they habitually ignore the Palestinian Arabs malevolent intentions towards Israel even as they harshly pressure the latter to make suicidal territorial concessions to the former), while the goal motivating the vast majority of the Palestinian Arabs national allies is Victory (i.e., Israels destruction). -- Mark Rosenblit]\n\nMohammed al-Dura - Israel's greatest PR failure\n\nBy Reuven Pedatzur - Haaretz - October 24, 2010\n\nThe photograph of Mohammed and Jamal al-Dura crouching behind a cement-filled barrel in a fruitless effort to avoid being hit by the bullets of Israeli soldiers became a symbol of the cruelty and brutality of Israel. It established the image of the Israel Defense Forces as a bloodthirsty army, operating on the basis of unacceptable norms. At the end of the 55-second footage aired by the France 2 television station, reporter Charles Enderlin declared that \"Mohammed is dead,\" opening \"the floodgates to a torrent of vengeance,\" as Amos Harel and Avi Issacharoff wrote in their book \"The Seventh War.\"\n\nMohammed al-Dura became a martyr, a symbol of the struggle of the Palestinian people against a ruthless occupier. Postage stamps bearing an image of the father and son were issued throughout the Arab world, and streets were named after the boy.\n\nThe story of Mohammed al-Dura was a tremendous propaganda victory for the Palestinians. But it was also Israel's biggest public relations failure, and it is unclear why. There is plenty of evidence showing that the story about the boy's death was a show skillfully orchestrated by the Palestinians.\n\nWhat is troubling in this affair is that official Israel ignored the testimonies and investigations that began piling up immediately after the incident. The documentary by the German journalist Esther Shapira, and the investigation by French businessman Philippe Karsenty, raise suspicions that Palestinian cameraman Talal Abu Rahma who shot the footage that was delivered to France 2 meddled with the story. And many others were party to this effort.\n\nThe cameraman's testimony is full of contradictions. He says that \"the soldiers shot the two in cold blood for 45 minutes.\" However, if the IDF soldiers wanted to hit Mohammed and his father in \"cold blood\" they could have killed them in less than a minute. Regarding the question of how many bullets were fired toward the two, Abu Rahma said \"at least 400.\" The wall at the site of the incident clearly shows eight holes.\n\nKarsenty managed to acquire the raw footage of Abu Rahma, including the 10 seconds of film after Enderlin declares that \"Mohammed is dead,\" which shows the child raising his hand and peering toward the camera. Nowhere in the footage are bullets seen hitting the bodies of father and son, even though the father claims he was hit by 12 bullets and his son by three. No blood was found at the site of the incident.\n\nMohammed al-Dura was buried in a funeral attended by masses. However, the child who was buried was brought to Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip at 10 A.M., according to the testimony of a doctor who admitted him. The shots at the Netzarim junction began only at 2 P.M., and Mohammed was taken away from the site at 3 P.M. In the photographs shown by a Gaza pathologist, a child who had been hit by bullets is seen, but his injuries are not the sort that Jamal spoke of. While the father says that Mohammed was hit in his right leg, the boy at Shifa was hit in his left leg. A biometric identification expert compared the photograph of the child who was buried and the child at the Netzarim junction, and found that they are different.\n\nThe father, Jamal, claims that 12 bullets hit his body, and he proudly shows off the scars on his arms. However, Shapira found Dr. Yehuda David, who says that he operated on him six years before the incident and that the scars are the result of knife wounds.\n\nNonetheless, official Israel is silent. A golden opportunity to challenge the credibility of the Palestinian version on one of the most formative events in the history of the conflict is being missed, and it is hard to understand why. The IDF, more than once, has sinned in the excessive use of military force, which leads to the death of innocents. But when it turns out that in the Dura affair IDF soldiers did not hit a child and his father, those responsible for public relations at the IDF are silent, as is the Foreign Ministry. Thus Israel relinquishes the media front to the Palestinians, who are taking advantage of it with sophistication while using television stations that sympathize with their cause such as France 2.\n\n[Note: Although debunking the Big Lie has intrinsic worth, it is naïve to believe that the World would stop believing it if only this or that particular portion of it were to be disproven in a timely manner. The World, which is so ready to demonize Israel for merely defending itself, would have found a justification to do so even without the Lie of Mohammed al-Dura. -- Mark Rosenblit]\n\n[Note: It seems that during the Palestinian olive harvest, it is not Palestinian olive trees which are endangered by Jewish settlers, but rather Jewish synagogues and vineyards which are endangered by Palestinian settlers.

Samaria and Judea Police said that they were awaiting the official opinion of a fire inspector before judging whether or not arson had been committed.\n\nInvestigators discovered tracks of two people leading away from the scene of the blaze toward Ramallah.\n\nPolice said that there were prayer books in the trailer, but that no Torah scrolls had been inside at the time of the fire.\n\nLater Friday afternoon, the security director of the settlement of Neriya reported that he saw a large group of people descending from a nearby Palestinian village and entering a nearby vineyard operated by Dolev resident Shlomi Cohen.\n\n\"In light of past experience with such events in the vineyard, a small group under the command of the security chief arrived at the scene,\" said Samaria and Judea Police spokesman Dani Falk.\n\nThree British women were detained at the scene by the security team, who called police and IDF. The additional forces en route to the scene said that they encountered barriers of stones which they believe were placed in the road to delay security forces from reaching the vineyard.\n\nPolice said that there was damage to the irrigation system in the vineyard and that some plants had been uprooted.\n\nRepresentatives of the Council of Jewish Communities of Judea, Samaria and Gaza said that over 5,000 grapevines had been uprooted.\n\n\"This is the third time in the last two months in which an incident such as this one occurred in the same place,\" said Yesha spokesman Yishai Hollander.\n\n\"This incident comes following the burning of the synagogue in Yad Yair this morning, which is located in the same area.\"\n\nHollander emphasized the gravity of the situation in light of the shmita (sabbatical) year, which means the plants could not be replanted until next year.\n\n\"The local residents are upset that the security forces once again did not succeed in preventing the vandalism, and demand the expanding of security and, as a response, forbidding the residents of the neighboring Palestinian village, Mizra'a a-Kabaliya, from harvesting their olives,\" wrote Hollander.\n\n(©) The Jerusalem Post\n\n[Note: Perhaps the biggest lie of all is the diplomatic truism that the Arabs have finally accepted Israels existence as a Jewish nation-state, and that, consequently, Israels existential conflict with the Arabs is, in reality, merely a territorial dispute. Read on!]\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Editorial**\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Recognition Sham\n\n(Jerusalem Post, November 15, 2007) [Former Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman] Yasser Arafat recognized Israel's right to exist in 1988. He shook hands with [former Israel Prime Minister] Yitzhak Rabin and signed the Oslo Accords in 1993. The PLO later ostensibly amended its Covenant, as [former United States President] Bill Clinton visited Gaza, to eliminate calls for Israel's destruction. Most recently, the Palestinians approved the [U.S. Administration's] Road Map, which again was based upon recognition of Israel's right to exist.\n\nSo the Palestinians accept Israel's existence, right? Well, perhaps not. Now, on the eve of [the] Annapolis [peace conference convened by U.S. President George W. Bush], we discover that all of these claims of recognition may have been a giant sham.\n\nOn Monday, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said, \"The problem of the content of the document [setting out joint principles for peacemaking post-Annapolis] has not been resolved... One of the more pressing problems is the Zionist regime's insistence on being recognized as a Jewish state.\n\n\"We will not agree to recognize Israel as a Jewish state,\" Erekat said. \"There is no country in the world where religious and national identities are intertwined.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, another prominent Palestinian negotiator, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said, \"It is only a Zionist party that deals with Israel as a Jewish state, and we did not request to be a member of the international Zionism movement.\"\n\nYesterday, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salaam Fayad joined in these statements. And Erekat chimed in again on Al-Arabiya TV: \"Israel can define itself however it sees fit; and if it wishes to call itself a Jewish state, so be it. But the Palestinians will never acknowledge Israel's Jewish identity.\"\n\nAll this is mind-boggling from an Israeli perspective. To Jews and Israelis, it is obvious that if Israel is not a Jewish state, meaning (at least) a state with an overwhelming Jewish majority, than it would simply become the 22nd Arab state. Israel would cease to exist.\n\nThe Palestinian refusal to accept Israel as a Jewish state suggests that all their solemn and myriad expressions of Israel's right to exist did not mean anything. They did not mean that the Palestinians accepted the Jews as a people (as Palestinians expect to be accepted), or that Israel is the legitimate expression of the Jewish people's right to self-determination.\n\nErekat's claim that the \"intertwining\" of religious and national identity is unusual, let alone unique, is nonsense. Perhaps he has not heard of the Islamic Conference, a group of 55 states, or the Church of England. While Arab states, such as Saudi Arabia, will officially not let Jews set foot in their country, Israel has never seen a contradiction between its Jewishness and the need to respect and protect non-Jewish minorities.\n\n[Israeli] Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stated this week that Israel would not participate in any post-Annapolis negotiations except on the basis of Palestinian acceptance of Israel as a Jewish state. In essence, Israel is demanding that the Palestinians end their double game.\n\nIf Israel is not a Jewish state, it is Palestine, which is exactly the point. So long as they hold to their positions, Fayad, Erekat and Abed Rabbo, representing Palestinian \"moderates,\" are not espousing a two-state solution but a \"Greater Palestine\" ideology.\n\nThere is no way for Israelis to understand the refusal to accept Israel as a Jewish state other than as a rejection of the two-state solution and the embrace of the \"strategy of stages,\" whereby a Palestinian state is not an end of claims against Israel, but a down-payment toward Israel's destruction.\n\nAs Olmert says, there is no point in entering a \"peace process\" on this basis. Every conception of the two-state vision has assumed a foundation of genuine mutual recognition. The first point of the first phase of the road map, for example, begins: \"Palestinian leadership issues unequivocal statement reiterating Israel's right to exist in peace and security....\"\n\nOslo's Statement of Principles begins, \"[Israel and the PLO] agree that it is time to... recognize their mutual legitimate and political rights....\"\n\nThe 1947 UN Partition Plan called for dividing Mandatory Palestine \"into Jewish and Arab states.\"\n\nWithout mutual recognition, there is no basis for negotiation. The Palestinians expect Israel to accept their existence and rights as a people. The Jewish people expects no less.\n\n(©) The Jerusalem Post\n\n[Note: Moderate Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas helps the Palestinians to perpetuate their misbegotten collective halo of Victimhood by falsely accusing Israel of expelling Palestinian Arabs from Jerusalem.
