        "text": "The eighth seminar by the Muslim Council of Elders at the Cairo International Book Fair took place at the Council’s stand at the Egypt International Exhibition Center. The seminar was titled ‘Tips for Arabic Students’ and presented by Ivorian scholar and Al-Azhar graduate Shaykh Faozi Konate. The seminar explored the importance of the Arabic language for researchers and students in academia.\n\nDuring the seminar, Shaykh Konate remarked that the Arabic language is a means of knowledge and comprehension that affords a person the ability to grasp both his own language and that of others. Additionally, he highlighted how crucial it is for scholars and students of Arabic to study the 12 sciences of the language.\n\nThe Ivorian scholar also noted that academics unanimously agree that learning and absorbing any academic field should begin with research in the Arabic language before moving on to the field itself. He also referenced a number of intellectuals, like Al-Baqalani, Al-Ramani, and Al-Khattabi, who wrote about Arabic before writing about their respective fields of expertise. He concluded by emphasizing the significance of Arabic language studies and specializations for students and researchers.\n\nThe Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair comes as part of His Eminence the Grand Imam’s vision of promoting dialogue and spreading tolerance and peace globally as well as building bridges of cooperation with people of all backgrounds. The Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair is located in Hall 4 next to the Al-Azhar stand at the Egypt International Exhibition Center.\n\nThe seventh seminar by the Muslim Council of Elders at the Cairo International Book Fair took place at the Council’s stand at the Egypt International Exhibition Center. The seminar was titled ‘Towards an inter-Islamic dialogue’ and presented by the Vice-president of Al-Azhar University Dr. Mohamed Abdul Malek. The seminar explored the calls by His Eminence Dr. Ahmed Al-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar and Chairman of the Muslim Council of Elders for an inter-Islamic dialogue.\n\nDuring the seminar, Dr. Abdul Malek remarked that through the Document on Human Fraternity, which aspires to foster coexistence and tolerance among people of different races, colours, religions, and sects, the Grand Imam worked to connect people both internally and externally. Externally, this was done by reaching out to people of different backgrounds while internally, the Grand Imam urged a dialogue between Sunnis and Shiites to bring all Muslims together. Abdul Malek also pointed out that this occurred at a pivotal moment when Muslims needed to band together in the face of mounting difficulties.\n\nAbdul Malek added, “Since all Muslims believe in the same God and Messenger (PBUH), the Islamic nation has many things in common that should bring it together rather than divide it. The Qur’an, which is acknowledged as the message of God Almighty, is regarded as the sacred book by all Muslims of varying backgrounds.”\n\nThe Vice-president of Al-Azhar University also emphasized the significance of removing various barriers that impede inter-Islamic dialogue, one of which being the insulting of prominent historical Islamic figures.\n\nThe Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair comes as part of His Eminence the Grand Imam’s vision of promoting dialogue and spreading tolerance and peace globally as well as building bridges of cooperation with people of all backgrounds. The Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair is located in Hall 4 next to the Al-Azhar stand at the Egypt International Exhibition Center.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Elders under the Chairmanship of the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar His Eminence Dr. Ahmed Al-Tayeb strongly condemns the terrorist attacks targeting a mosque in the city of Peshawar in Pakistan which resulted in the deaths and injuries of scores of innocent civilians.\n\nThe Council reiterates its categorical rejection of such terrorist attacks and violence, which contradict the teachings of all religions as well as international laws and norms protecting freedom of religion and prohibiting the targeting of places of worship. This is something that has been reiterated within the Document on Human Fraternity, which was co-signed by His Eminence Dr. Ahmed Al-Tayeb the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar and Chairman of the Muslim Council of Elders and His Holiness Pope Francis, Pontiff of the Catholic Church which called on people to refrain from using the name of God to justify acts of murder, exile and terrorism.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Elders calls for united international efforts to uproot all forms of violence, extremism, hate and terrorism. It also extends its utmost condolences to the families of the victims of the attack while praying for a speedy recovery for the wounded.\n\n’Basis of Understanding from Thought and Language’ by His Eminence Dr. Mustapha Benhamza on display at the Muslim Council of Elders’ stand at the Cairo International Book Fair 2023\n\n’Great demand for the publication by visitors to the Cairo International Book Fair’\n\nThe book ’Basis of Understanding from Thought and Language’ by His Eminence Dr. Mustapha Benhamza, member of the Higher Scientific Council of Al-Azhar and the Muslim Council of Elders and President of the Ulema Council of Oujda in Morocco is available to visitors of the Muslim Council of Elders’ stand at the 54th Cairo International Book Fair. The book discusses the significance of focusing on the discrepancy between general awareness and understanding among people in the Islamic world.\n\nLikewise, the publication also explores the effects of misunderstanding spreading throughout society and the hate and hostility that arises from it. Additionally, it covers how to deal with misunderstandings by using a methodical strategy that ensures accurate reading and understanding of scientific and intellectual concerns.\n\nThe author mentioned that his inspiration for this work was the current state of miscommunication and understanding among Muslims which troubles him greatly since he is witnessing first-hand how miscommunication is growing, escalating, and ultimately fueling Muslim people’s overwhelming hatred for one another. The result of all this is to ignite a fierce competition and a violent conflict which is prevalent in many Muslim countries.\n\nThe author appeals to those considering the future of the Muslim world to make an intellectual contribution to understanding, eliminating, and eradicating miscommunication. Additionally, he calls on those with influence to educate people about the gravity and magnitude miscommunication and to persuade them that the Muslim world’s future depends on its ability to uphold both its diverse and divisive elements.\n\nThe three main topics covered in ’Basis of Understanding from Thought and Language’ are; ‘Scientific Fundamentals of Understanding’, ‘Obstacles to Understanding among Muslims’ and ‘Dysfunctions in reading texts’.\n\nThe Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair comes as part of His Eminence the Grand Imam’s vision of promoting dialogue and spreading tolerance and peace globally as well as building bridges of cooperation with people of all backgrounds. The Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair is located in Hall 4 next to the Al-Azhar stand at the Egypt International Exhibition Center.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Elders’ stand at the Cairo International Book Fair is exhibiting one of the Council’s latest translated publications ‘Countering Islamophobia in Europe’ by Ian Law, Amina Easat-Daas, Arzu Merali and Salman Sayyid.\n\nFollowing the publishing of the cartoons insulting the Prophet of Islam, Muhammed (PBUH) the inspiration to publish the book arose. The Muslim Council of Elders convened to discuss these unfortunate incidents and potential solutions to the problems it had caused. The Grand Imam of Al-Azhar and Chairman of the Muslim Council of Elders, His Eminence Dr. Ahmed Al-Tayeb queried about voices of reason in the West, specifically academic intellectuals who oppose ongoing provocations that defame Islam and its messenger. Al Hokama Publishing chose to translate and distribute ‘Countering Islamophobia in Europe’ for Arab readers in an effort to emphasize the contributions of Western rationalists and thinkers in stemming the growth of hate speech and Islamophobia in Europe. This despicable phenomenon is frequently encouraged by global media outlets and political parties who put their interests and electoral success ahead of fostering a coexistent society.\n\n‘Countering Islamophobia in Europe’ draws on new evidence from eight national contexts to provide an innovative kit of counter-narratives, which were presented and well received at the European Parliament in September 2018, and subsequently launched across Europe in national workshops in selected states.\n\nThe book discusses Islamophobia and possible ways to counter it in various European states including; the United Kingdom, Greece, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Portugal, France, Belgium and Germany. It also provides a “New Counter-Islamophobia Kit” for readers, intellectuals and organizations looking to counter this discriminatory phenomenon.\n\nThe Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair comes as part of His Eminence the Grand Imam’s vision of promoting dialogue and spreading tolerance and peace globally as well as building bridges of cooperation with people of all backgrounds. The Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair is located in Hall 4 next to the Al-Azhar stand at the Egypt International Exhibition Center.\n\nThe Emerging Peacemakers Forum organized an interactive workshop titled ‘Peace and Love’ at the Muslim Council of Elders’ stand at the Cairo International Book Fair which was presented by forum member Meera Al Mheiri from the United Arab Emirates. The workshop discussed various topics including promoting inter-cultural relations, peace and human fraternity.\n\nDuring the workshop, four groups of males and females of various ethnicities who had never met before were formed. This was done to assist them meet new people, form new connections, and receive training in how to put a set of human principles into practice in order to spread and advance the values of coexistence and peace in their societies.\n\n“How do you define peace?” was a key question in the interactive workshop. This was done so that each participant can share a personal experience with their fellow group members. Participants would then comment on this based on their observations in order to learn and build on the scenario.\n\nDuring the workshop, each group also presented their respective projects and ideas for promoting peace as well as intercultural harmony and human fraternity in society.\n\nThe Emerging Peacemakers Forum is considered one of the most prominent initiatives by the Muslim Council of Elders in partnership with Al-Azhar and the Church of England. It features young people from the East and West brought together to discuss their respective roles in creating peace and justice as well as spreading the values of tolerance and coexistence.\n\nThe Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair comes as part of His Eminence the Grand Imam’s vision of promoting dialogue and spreading tolerance and peace globally as well as building bridges of cooperation with people of all backgrounds. The Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair is located in Hall 4 next to the Al-Azhar stand at the Egypt International Exhibition Center.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Elders has hosted the fourth seminar at its stand at the Cairo International Book Fair 2023. Titled ‘A step towards promoting Human Fraternity’, the seminar was presented by Dr. Nahla Al Saidi, advisor to the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar for International Student Affairs, who discussed ways to promote coexistence and human fraternity.\n\nDuring the seminar, Al Saidi remarked, “Achieving human fraternity entails working to create societies free of wars and conflicts as well as having peaceful individuals who live in harmony with one another. It also involves recognizing that the only way to bring about global peace and human fraternity is to uphold the lofty ideals of Islam and its divine law, which call for mercy and interdependence. I call for Humanity to unite to disseminate those ideals and values among people, and to aid those attempting to doing so.”\n\nThe advisor to the Grand Imam for International Student Affairs added, “The Document on Human Fraternity which was co-signed on the 4th of February 2019 by His Eminence Dr. Ahmed Al-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar and Chairman of the Muslim Council of Elders along with His Holiness Pope Francis, Pontiff of the Catholic Church in Abu Dhabi is filled with ideals that can guide humanity towards achieving world peace and happiness for individuals and societies alike, to go with reawakening religious conviction within people.”\n\nAl Saidi continued, “The Document on Human Fraternity urged people to adopt the values of mercy, justice, and tolerance and warned us that the world we live in is not a place for conflict, disharmony, and war but for cooperation and acquaintance. For the document to become a reality in our lives, the entire world must adopt it wholeheartedly.”\n\nShe concluded by emphasizing the important role of religious and cultural institutions as well as thinkers and academics in spreading coexistence and promoting human fraternity for the sake of global peace. She also thanked Al-Azhar and the Muslim Council of Elders for their efforts in making human fraternity a global reality.\n\nThe Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair comes as part of His Eminence the Grand Imam’s vision of promoting dialogue and spreading tolerance and peace globally as well as building bridges of cooperation with people of all backgrounds. The Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair is located in Hall 4 next to the Al-Azhar stand at the Egypt International Exhibition Center.\n\nThe book ‘Concepts that need to be rectified in conduct, mind, and belief’ by Sheikh Muhammad Abu Zahra, one of the senior scholars of Al-Azhar, is available to visitors of the Muslim Council of Elders’ pavilion at the 54th Cairo International Book Fair.\n\nSheikh Muhammad Abu Zahra’s essays as well as previously released pieces from magazines and newspapers are all included in the book. The majority of these writings center on extremism and other vague ideas that sparked divisions among the Muslim world.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Elders hopes that by publishing this book, it will help to dispel many current misconceptions and uphold the moral principles of the Noble Qur’an and Sunnah. In order to arrive to truth and certainty, the book also serves as a manual for the purification of the mind, soul, and conduct.\n\nThe book includes many topics, the most prominent of which; the correct faith, faith and exaggeration in religion, reform and admiration for opinion, chaos of thought and opinion, integrity of the science of religion, treatment of deviation, fanaticism in understanding religion and delusion in understanding religion.\n\nThe Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair comes as part of His Eminence the Grand Imam’s vision of promoting dialogue and spreading tolerance and peace globally as well as building bridges of cooperation with people of all backgrounds. The Council’s participation at the Cairo International Book Fair can be located in Hall 4 next to the Al-Azhar stand at the Egypt International Exhibition Center.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Elders is set to launch its stand at the Cairo International Book Fair which opens its doors to the general public on Thursday 26 January until Monday 6 February 2023.

Almighty Allah said, “Allah will elevate those of you who are faithful, and raise those gifted with knowledge in rank. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.” (Al-Mujadila:11) as well as “Are those who know equal to those who do not know? None will be mindful of this except people of reason” (Al Zumar: 9). Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) also said, “Whoever takes a path upon which to obtain knowledge, Allah makes the path to Paradise easy for him” (Sahih Muslim).\n\nThe Muslim Council of Elders is focused on supporting educational opportunities and initiatives. It strives to promote and encourage education through its publications, worldwide initiatives, events, and projects. In order to safeguard young people from extremism and radicalization and to advance their understanding of the ideals of righteousness, peace, and tolerance, the Muslim Council of Elders and its members across the world have made significant efforts in this regard in their capacities as scholars and educators.\n\nThe Document on Human Fraternity’s noble ideals and values were promoted through several educational curricula by the Muslim Council of Elders. Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Italy, America, Timor-Leste, and other nations have adopted these values to spread the principles of peace and coexistence inside their respective educational curricula.\n\nThe Council calls on individuals, international organizations, and institutions to unite in order to spread awareness of the value of learning and to increase collaborative efforts to end illiteracy. This will enable future generations to learn more, particularly about the principles of human fraternity and peace as well as dispelling misconceptions, and battling hate speech, intolerance, and discrimination."
