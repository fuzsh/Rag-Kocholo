        "text": "Israel is at war with journalism. Following the horrific killing of Shireen Abu Akleh which sent reverberations around the world, it is vital we examine some of the less obvious ways in which the temporary Zionist entity fights against the exposure of the facts.\n\nShireen Abu Akleh is a name that will echo through the ages but she is merely the latest in a long list of clearly identified journalists whose lives were cut short by the Israeli regime.\n\nNames like Yasser Murtaja, Ahmed Abu Hussein, Basil Faraj, Fadel Shana, Imad Abu Zahra, Issam Tillawi, James Miller, Khaled Reyadh Hamad, Mahmoud al-Kumi, and Nazih Darwazeh should also be remembered.\n\nAll wore clothing identifying them as reporters and all were killed by the temporary entity.\n\nThe Palestinian JournalistsÂ’ Union says 55 journalists have been killed by the Zionists since 2000.\n\nSince 2018, at least 144 Palestinian journalists have been wounded by Zionist forces across the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East al-Quds, hurt by live fire and rubber bullets, as well as stun grenades, teargas, and beatings with batons, according to Reporters Without Borders.\n\nAnother way in which the Israeli regime expresses its disdain for the reporting of the truth is through its insistence on prosecuting Palestinian journalists on the charge of incitement.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018, almost 500 Palestinians were arrested by the Israeli regime for the crime of incitement for things they posted online.\n\nMany were journalists and some were children. Currently, there are more than 15 Palestinian journalists languishing in occupation jails for so-called incitement. Some are being held under administrative detention which can last up to a year and a half.\n\nThe Israeli NSO group has exported its Pegasus spyware around the world, hacking into the phones of thousands of activists and journalists in many different countries.\n\nThe organization claimed that it had no access to the information its spyware was hacking for other regimes.\n\nHowever, that would fail to explain how NSO advisory board member Cherie Blair was able to inform the ex-wife of Dubai's ruler that she was a target of her former husband.\n\nIf the NSO group does not have access to this information, how could Cherie Blair possibly know?\n\nThe shocking Zionist police attack on the funeral of Shireen Abu Akleh's funeral reminds us that none of this behavior is new to Zionist occupation forces.\n\nApartheid troops shot dead Shawkat Khalil Awad at the funeral of Mohammed al-Alaama, a 12-year-old child they shot dead the night before in 2021, and there have been many other examples of Palestinian funerals coming under violent assault.\n\nSo, here we have a pariah regime rejected by much of the world which engages in constant covert and overt war against any journalist seeking to reveal the truth about its actions.\n\nLong live the martyr Shireen Abu Akleh, long live adversarial journalism."
