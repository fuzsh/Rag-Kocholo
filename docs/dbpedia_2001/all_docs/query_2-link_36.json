to which Islamic conferences and councils in recent years, particularly the European Council for Fatwa and Research, have contributed important Islamic teachings. These have made it, to an extent, better understood. This epistemological research is specifically centred on Muslims’ coexistence in Ireland. This research fundamentally embraces the study of Islamic theology and Muslims’ discourse, which gives rise to a number of research questions. The main question addressed is that of whether Muslims should live in non-Muslim lands. This prompts the philosophical question of a Muslim’s right to the acquisition of local citizenship. There is a wide range of jurists’ opinions on the latter, which indicates the paramount importance of considering the context in which each of these opinions originated. The definition of the term citizenship and the rights and responsibilities that emanate from it have led to important discourses among Muslim and non-Muslim scholars. The teaching of the Qur’an and other Islamic texts, such as the rights to world lands by Adam and Eve, are discussed in this regard, along with the concept of Muwatanah signifying the action of belonging to Watan (home land) and confirming the reciprocal rights and responsibilities between human beings and the Watan wherein they reside. Scholars of the concept of the legality and illegality of holding citizenship of a non-Muslim land are reviewed and the consequences of their writings are explored for an interpretation of civic duties and responsibilities. The theological concepts of Wala’ and Bara’, which are of paramount importance in the philosophical development of the arguments of Muslims’ coexistence in non-Muslim lands, are explored, inclusive of the well-being of the Muslim community’s coexistence in Ireland and their practical interpretation of these concepts. This leads to a discussion of the concept of civic loyalty and the associated Islamic doctrine related to it as documented by Islamic scholars such as Ibn Taymiyya, Abdelqader, Maulawi and Al-Qaradawi. Another aspect of civic loyalty with profound\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nrepercussions is the concept of Taqseem Al-Dar. A wide range of issues, which require particular Fiqh resolutions such as personal problems, economic, family and social issues, are explored. The research explores the limited literature on the concept of Fiqh of minorities – not a contemporary Islamic innovation – which originates from a realistic Islamic and religious comprehension of problems confronting Muslim minorities. Fiqh of Minorities is researched as a typical example of changes of Fatwa related to our changing notions of the time and place in which people find themselves. Muslim scholars have elucidated a number of foundational issues, which are discussed in this thesis, so that such Fiqh remains Islamic. The basis of successful peaceful coexistence is researched, particularly in the case of Muslims living in Ireland. I demonstrate that commonalities and Islamic perception of others are both a fundamental basis for successful coexistence and, above all, an important argument that in order to maintain and further successful coexistence, Muslims should hold fast to Islamic values. The thesis promotes both the prophet Joseph as an example of a successful sojourner in a non-Muslim land and, likewise, Muslim immigrants to Abyssinia.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nPraise be to Allah and may Allah’s peace, blessings and mercy be upon all His prophets commencing with the Prophet Adam and ending with the Prophet Muhammad.

The contemporary discussions of integration in today’s Europe are mainly focused on Muslim integration and Muslim identity. When the question of Muslim integration is raised the issue of coexistence becomes contentious as most Muslims perceive Islam as a way of life.1 Shari’ahh is deemed to be the ultimate authority for the Muslim majority. Although interpreted differently, according to different schools of thought, Shari’ahh regulates a Muslim’s relationship with Allah, MuslimíMuslim relationships and Muslimínon-Muslim relationships. In other words, relationships between a Muslim and the entire universe around him/her are regulated by Shari’ahh. For instance, regarding financial affairs the following is stated in the Qur’an: O ye who believe! When ye contract a debt for a fixed term, record it in writing. Let a scribe record it in writing between you in (terms of) equity. No scribe should refuse to write as Allah hath taught him, so let him write, and let him who incurreth the debt dictate, and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord, and diminish naught thereof. But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding, or weak, or unable himself to dictate, then let the guardian of his interests dictate in (terms of) equity. And call to witness, from among your men, two witnesses. And if two men be not (at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses, so that if the one erreth (through forgetfulness) the other will remember. And the witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. Be not averse to writing down (the contract) whether it be small or great, with (record of) the term thereof. That is more equitable in the sight of Allah and more sure for testimony, and the best way of avoiding doubt between you; save only in the case when it is actual merchandise which ye transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is no sin for you if ye write it not. And have witnesses when ye sell one to another, and let no harm be done to scribe or witness. If ye do (harm to them) lo! It is a sin in you. Observe your duty to Allah. Allah is teaching you. And Allah is knower of all things. (Trans. 2:282, Pickthall)\n\n2\n\nChapter One\n\nIn the above verse Muslims have clear financial instructions, in minute details, with regard to regulating certain types of financial affairs. Other verses of the Qur’an regulate financial transactions even further; for example, according to verse 2:275: “Allah permits trading and forbids usury.” The Qur’an also organises relations among people in a broader sense; for example, the verse below is a regulation on criminal behaviour: O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the murdered; the freeman for the freeman, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. And for him who is forgiven somewhat by his (injured) brother, prosecution according to usage and payment unto him in kindness. This is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. He who transgresseth after this will have a painful doom. (Trans. 2:178)\n\nIn this verse the Qur’an explains the Islamic regulations that should be applied in the case of criminal behaviour. In another example it is stated: “When ye are greeted with a greeting, greet ye with a better than it or return it. Lo! Allah taketh count of all things.” (Trans. 4:86, Pickthall) Given the sheer number of textual regulations pertaining to the daily lives of most Muslims, it is essential that one conducts a Muslim theological study on the issue of coexistence. Furthermore, this type of faith-based study has thus far not yet been presented. Scholars such as Bérengère Massignon argue that researchers have tackled the issue of the Europeanisation of Islam at the grass-roots level, i.e. recomposition of Islamic beliefs, interethnic and mixed marriages, internet-based Muslim networks, European large gatherings and the rule of religious leaders.2 Bérengère Massignon himself also deals with the issue of Europeanisation of Islam at an institutional level, focusing on transnational Muslim organisations in relation to European institutions.3 His study is a sociological one, and not theological, as is the case in this book. The part played by Muslims in the social texture of their respective locations is elaborated on in the book The Infidel Within by Humayum Ansari, and likewise by Ala Al-Hamarneh and Joern Thielmann in their book Islam and Muslims in Germany. Again, however, these scholars do not address the theological debates. Until now the issue of Muslim positive coexistence, especially in Ireland, has been elucidated from historical and sociological points of view. In 2004, Kieran Flynn submitted his MPhil book on the Muslim\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\ncommunity in Ireland. He highlights briefly the history of Muslims in Europe, explaining some pertinent Islamic terms such as Dar-al-Harb (the land of war). In 2007, The Irish Hospice Foundation Programme in partnership with the Health Service Executive published a booklet entitled Caring for a Muslim Patient. In this booklet they elaborate on health issues and Muslim practices. When it comes to studying a person’s identity, the factor of being a Muslim has been considered unworthy of a detailed analysis, Jocelyne Cesari argues, by European sociologists who specialise in immigration.4 Cesari adds that scholars of Islam and certain sociologists and anthropologists of the Muslim world stress the significance of Islam as a system of norms and values. Nevertheless, Cesari states that due to the increased visibility of Muslim action and activities, the study of religious factors occupy a prominent position in integration. This study became more relevant in the post-9/11 context.5 Cesari elaborates on Muslim identity in Europe as influenced by a number of factors, for example, meta-narratives about Islam and ethnicity versus Islam, but not Islamic theology, which profoundly affects Muslims’ coexistence in Europe. In his book, To be a European Muslim, Tariq Ramadan6 elaborates on Islamic teachings such as Tawheed (oneness and unity of God), shedding light on the typology of the Islamic sciences such as the sciences of the Qur’an. In this book Ramadan makes a very significant statement: As it is the last Revelation, the Qur’an represents the last guidance, the last frame of reference whose teachings are suitable, henceforth, for all places and times to come until the end of human history. Thus the Qur’an, the very Word of God, conveyed by the Angel Gabriel, is the first and essential source for Muslims in both religious and juridical fields. Nine-tenths of it deal with spirituality in the widest sense of the term: the presence of God, creation, faith, worship, morality, the Hereafter, etc. We also find general rulings concerning social affairs: in its last Revelation, God fixed a global frame within which believers have to exert themselves in order to find the most appropriate law which is both faithful to the Qur’an and which also fits their context.7\n\nThis statement confirms the relevance of the study of theology for the question of coexistence. Ramadan explains a number of Arabic terms such as Al-Maslahah ΔΤϠμϤϟ΍ (consideration of public interest). Nevertheless, the theological aspects of coexistence have not been fully explored yet.\n\n4\n\nChapter One\n\nOther studies, such as those conducted by Tarek Mitri, elaborate on the issue of Muslim and Christian relations. Mitri argues that integration and uniformity are encouraged by economic, technological and ecological factors. Nevertheless, he perceives that MuslimíChristian relations are caught between advocates of homogenisation and supporters of selfaffirmation, where the former favours relativism but the latter encourages fanaticism.8 He states that tension between Muslims and Christians is due to a complex history of rivalry and wars. In addition, he states that it is also due to the perception of the other and the depiction of today’s conflicts as religious wars and manifestations of ancestral hatred.9 Although Mitre states in his study, “it is often admitted that changes in one’s theology and perceptions of the other, on the whole, linger behind the dynamics of life”,10 he does not present a theological discourse. Given the clear paucity in the literature in regards to a faith-based study of Muslim coexistence, this book proposes to elaborate on the theological aspect of Muslim coexistence in non-Muslim lands and presents a number of theological questions, arguments and counterarguments pertinent to this issue. Is it permissible for Muslims to live in a non-Muslim country? Is it permissible for Muslims to acquire non-Muslim citizenship? What are the obstacles? How do Muslims perceive civic duties in non-Muslim countries? Are Muslims obliged to fulfil them? Some Muslim scholars such as Salah Sultan11 argue that to be a citizen or to live in a non-Muslim country is a contentious issue that is urgently in need of critical study by Muslim scholars and researchers in order to provide a Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) that is neither justificatory nor phobic but rather is a Fiqh distinguished in its reformative and initiative approach.12 Faysal Maulawi13 states that the fact that Muslims living in non-Muslim countries are estimated to be approximately fifty million,14 enjoying more rights than the diminishing rights of Muslims living in Muslim countries – such as freedom of expression – makes the issue more urgent and more complicated. For instance, as stated in interviews I conducted with some Libyans residing in Ireland, under Muammar Gaddafi’s regime commencing on 1 September 1969, Muslims who had beards and established their five daily prayers in the mosque were under surveillance in Libya, where the level of religious freedom and human rights was undermined. Libya’s violation of human rights affected Libyans as well as non-Libyans residing in the country. Even refugees and asylum seekers were not free from persecution:\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nThere are indefinite detentions and abuses of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers as well as the legacy of unresolved cases of enforced disappearances of dissidents. Meanwhile, the security forces remain immune from the consequences of their actions.15\n\nThe dilemma is that violations of human rights in Libya were perpetrated by state agencies under Gaddafi’s regime. In other words, to live in Libya meant that one had to accept either to be a victim of the regime or face intolerable difficulties. Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Deputy Director at Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa programme, said: Violations continue to be committed by the security forces, particularly the Internal Security Agency (ISA), who appear to have unchecked powers to arrest, detain and interrogate individuals suspected of dissent or of terrorism-related activities. Individuals can be held incommunicado for long periods, tortured and denied access to lawyers. If Libya is to have any international credibility, the authorities must ensure that no one is above the law and that everyone, including the most vulnerable and marginalized, is protected by the law. The repression of dissent must end.16\n\nThis was the situtation in Libya during Gaddafi’s rule, when it was classified as one of the twenty-six countries in which there were some of the most serious wide-ranging human rights concerns.17 Libya’s poor human rights record went against the fact that it had ratified most of the major human rights treaties.18 In addition to the UN Conventions, on 30 May 1985, Libya signed the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights and ratified it on 19 July 1986, which binds it by some international and regional human rights standards.19 In light of the current revolution human rights continue to stall on reform in Libya. Assessment of the current human rights situation in Libya is outside the scope of this chapter. Nonetheless, human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch have already stated their concerns in regards to some human rights abuses such as arbitrary detentions by militia groups, which the National Transitional Council should work to stop.20\n\nTunisia, another country in transition, has also ratified most core UN human rights treaties as well as the above-mentioned African Charter on 16 March 1983.21 Despite its international and regional obligations to human rights, and in this particular example, the right to religious expression and freedom under Ben Ali’s regime, the hijab, an Islamic code\n\n6\n\nChapter One\n\nof modest dressing was banned. According to a report by Amnesty International: The Tunisian authorities also undermine freedom of expression of religious belief. Harassment of women wearing the hijab (Islamic headscarf) and men wearing beards and the qamis (knee-length shirts) is on the increase following the authorities’ calls for a strict implementation of a 1980s ministerial decree banning women from wearing the hijab at educational institutions and when working in government. Women often suffer disproportionately in this regard. Some women have been taken to police stations and forced to sign statements to say they will stop wearing the hijab. Others have reportedly had their hijab stripped off them in the street by police officers in plain clothes. Some women have been ordered to remove their hijab before being allowed into schools, universities, or workplaces and others forced to remove them in the street.22\n\nIn this example of a Muslim majority country, as certain Muslims believe, Muslims were denied their basic rights to certain religious practices in governmental and educational institutions. To wear the hijab or the qamis was against the law. By law, people’s religious rights were restricted. As well as religious freedom, in Tunisia, freedom of expression under Ben Ali’s regime was undermined, as believed by a number of Muslims. The situation has not improved yet. In Tunisia, it is almost impossible to register an independent non-governmental organisation (NGO) and, if it succeeds in being registered, it will not function, since for every public meeting an official authorisation is needed. In addition, human rights activists are usually subjected to harassment. Human rights organisations continue to experience increasingly repressive actions. The government routinely blocks the legal registration of new independent NGOs by preventing them from submitting their applications to register or by refusing to provide them with receipts to prove that they have submitted an application.23 Turkey is another example. It is a secular state, yet Muslims constitute the majority there. Nonetheless, they do not enjoy full religious freedom, as believed by a number of Muslims. On 29 June 2004, Leyla ùahin submitted an application to the European Court of Human Rights. When she was a student in a medical school in Istanbul, she was denied access to a written examination and lectures, and she was not allowed to enrol in a scientific department of the school as she wore a hijab, which she believed to be an Islamic obligation. Her claim was based on a violation of religious freedom. The then state party contested this claim, arguing that secularism\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nwas a crucial matter for Turkey’s practice of democracy. The European Court of Human Rights issued a sentence supporting the state’s decision.24 This is the situation in Turkey, despite the fact that on 15 August 2000,25 it signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.26 In Turkey a secular atmosphere has been achieved at a great cost to individual freedoms. As believed by a number of Muslims, Islamic practices have been restricted, paving the way for secularists to occupy state positions. In such an atmosphere, how can Muslims be called to live in Turkey, while in the countries where they currently live they are able enjoy their human rights? This deterioration of human rights could be one of the repercussions of political corruption. In an interview with Abdullahi An-Na’im27 conducted by Lisa Hajjar28 on 7 January 2000, An-Na’im stated that when the Arab world achieved liberation after many decades of colonisation, oppressive civil and political conditions were created by the leadership there during the 1950s and 1960s. Hence, human rights activism, deemed to be the current manifestation of an historic struggle for human rights, emerged in the 1970s.29 The tsunami of revolutions striking Tunisia, Egypt and Libya was, to a large extent, motivated by a deterioration of human rights in these countries. Opposers to the Tunisian and Egyptian government demand an immediate review of their constitutions, which they perceive to be the foundation of legalised violations of civil and political rights. AnNa’im argues that if the Egyptians and Syrians enjoy a certain level of human rights, it is due to the pressure applied by the West. He calls it human rights dependency. He adds that Egypt listens to the West because of aid but had Egypt been independent it would not have responded to this pressure. Nevertheless, An-Na’im perceives this pressure as a fundamental violation of human rights as it exploits the dependency of others.30 Ann Elizabeth Mayer31 argues that debates around the relationship between legal Islamic traditions and human rights became significant in the wake of the Islamic resurgence that began after the ArabíIsraeli war in 1967. Prior to this, the movement towards secularisation had been very consistent, leaving very little room for Islamic substantive rules.32 The discourse of human rights and Islam in Muslim countries has been ongoing for some time. Mashood A. Baderin33 argues that in the states where Islam is deemed to be the state religion or where Islamic law or Islamic principles are applied, Islam could be a significant factor in improving poor human rights. Baderin states:\n\n8\n\nChapter One Pragmatically therefore, efforts for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Muslim world must necessarily take the impact and role of Islam into account, be it positively or negatively. Islam generally, and Islamic law specifically, cannot simply be disregarded as irrelevant in any of such endeavours.34\n\nMuslims, constituting 20 per cent of the world’s population, have lived and thrived in greatly diverse Islamic societies, both historically and contemporarily.35 An-Na’im argues that human rights can have an impact on the law through social commitments influenced by Shari’ahh, as well as many other factors. He adds that Islamic societies, or the societies where Muslims constitute the majority, should not be perceived as coincidental with a fidelity to Shari’ahh.36 So, on the one hand, we have the state dynamic and, on the other, we have the social dimension. In between we have human rights, which are supposed to be negotiated through notions of morality. Hence, human rights are shaped by a number of factors in Islamic society. So, whose morality is it that is used as a foundation for this negotiation? How is this to be articulated? This is subject to political, economic and social factors.37 The issue of human rights in Muslim countries is a book topic in its own right. Nevertheless, no further elaboration on this point is provided as it is not a central concern of this book.38 However, the fundamental importance of human rights and the serious concerns in Muslim lands highlighted above make it an immediate and incumbent duty on Muslim scholars to facilitate an Islamic understanding of Muslim coexistence in non-Muslim lands based on ‘Ijtihad39 (reasoning), taking into consideration the difficulties confronting Muslims in Muslim countries and the Islamic rule of “Dar’ Al-Mafasid Wa Jalab Ul-Manafi’” ϊϓΎϨϤϟ΍ ΐϠΟϭ ΪγΎϔϤϟ΍ ˯έΩ (facilitating interests and warding off evils). According to Yusuf Al-Qaradawi,40 Muslims living in non-Muslim countries should lead a stable life that enables the viability of the seven phases: preserving their Muslim identity; raising their awareness; unity; embarking on activities; contribution; citizenship; and integration. This stable life should allow Muslims to fulfil their five fundamental duties: protecting and promoting themselves; shielding their families against assimilation; uniting with their Muslim brethren in the West; reflecting the true Islamic image; and being concerned with and supporting Muslim issues worldwide.41\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nVarious Muslim scholars argue for and against maintaining the purity of Muslims living in non-Muslim countries. These arguments raise questions pertinent to the concept of Muslims and citizenship of nonMuslim countries. How important is the question of citizenship to the issue of coexistence? What restrictions in the way of coexistence are there? What support is lent by scholarly arguments around the concept of legal citizenship in the case of Muslims living in non-Muslim countries? Considering the reality of Muslims living in non-Muslim societies, one can easily perceive excess and remiss. In other words, some who have been assimilated indulge in whatever is of worldly interest to them, regardless of its motivation and heedless of their religion. They do not differentiate between what is Halal (religiously permissible) and what is Haram (religiously forbidden). The second category is rare and not wellconnected in the Muslim community. They sever all types of relations with their society and they always feel alienated at home and among their countrymen. There is also a third category, one that presents a different argument. This is where Muslims perceive themselves as citizens in non-Muslim countries. In fact, millions of Muslims migrated from their homes and resided in non-Muslim countries as a result of pressures felt due to repression, backwardness and poverty in their respective homes. Hence, they raise the following questions: Is it permissible to live in non-Muslim countries? In fact, there is not a single Islamic country that meets all the conditions stipulated to be classified as an Islamic society, as will be explained in the coming chapters. Had there been an Islamic country,42 would it have been able to accommodate all these millions of Muslims? Had it accommodated all these millions, would the Muslim nation have been the best nation as described in the Qur’an43 or would it have been an isolated nation? Should the Fiqh of authority44 that the Muslim nation enjoyed for many centuries remain unalterable even though the current context is utterly different? Currently, the Muslim nation is weak and divided into many countries, and, is subjected politically, socially and intellectually to external and internal factors. Most of the Muslim countries are not Shari’ahh (Islamic law) compliant countries. Many nonreligious ideologies are in effect there. Non-Islamic norms penetrated Islamic societies through satellite television and the internet and, prior to the digital age, through colonisation and trade. In light of this situation should Muslim scholars turn a blind eye and apply the inherited Fiqh,45 overlooking the objectives of Islamic Shari’ahh,46 or should Muslim\n\n10\n\nChapter One\n\nscholars turn a deaf ear to the inherited Fiqh and take into consideration the objectives of Islamic Shari’ahh and the contemporary Muslim context? There is an argument and a counter-argument regarding the permissibility of Muslims’ coexistence in non-Muslim lands presented by a number of contemporary scholars such as Hasan Al-Bana, Al-Qaradawi and Al-Buti, 47 as well as scholars of earlier times such as Al-Sarkhasi48 and Ibn Al-Qayyim.49 In this book, illustrations of both arguments supported by citations will be elucidated providing answers to the questions above. In the second chapter, both Muslim and non-Muslim perceptions of citizenship is elaborated upon. Light is shed on similarities as well as differences. In this chapter it is made clear how the perceptions of citizenship of some non-Muslims present a challenge for Muslims. On the other hand, this chapter highlights new dimensions of citizenship added by Muslim scholars. It also shows the value of land from an Islamic point of view. In the third chapter the argument of Muslim scholars, who perceive living in a non-Muslim country and acquiring non-Muslim citizenship as being prohibited by Islam, is presented along with the Islamic scriptural quotations they cite in support of their arguments. Afterwards, a deliberation on their views and a different understanding of the Islamic scriptural quotations they cite in support of their arguments is explored in detail. This is vitally important, as it explains the opinions of these scholars and why and on what basis they formed them. An elaboration on their context is also presented since, when explaining Fiqh Al-Aqaliyyat (Fiqh of minorities) ΕΎϴϠϗϷ΍ ϪϘϓ, it has a profound impact on the Islamic law. Moreover, this gives one a better understanding of these opinions. In the fourth chapter, the arguments of Muslim scholars, who perceive living in a non-Muslim country and acquiring non-Muslim citizenship as islamically permissible, are presented, along with the Islamic scriptural quotations they cite in support of their arguments. This is vitally important as it explains the opinions of these scholars and why and on what basis they formed them. An elaboration on their context is also presented since, when talking about Fiqh Al-Aqaliyyat (Fiqh of minorities)ΕΎϴϠϗϷ΍ ϪϘϓ, it has a profound impact on Islamic law. Moreover, this gives a better understanding of these opinions.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nAs I conclude this chapter by stressing the Islamic permissibility of living in non-Muslim countries and acquiring non-Muslim citizenships, in the fifth chapter, light is shed on one of the frequently mentioned terms in the old Islamic books: Wala’ and Bara’ ˯΍ήΒϟ΍ϭ ˯ϻϮϟ΍ (sincerity and disassociation). The focus is on this concept and its serious implications on Muslimínon-Muslim relations. As the concept of Wala’ and Bara’ is based on love and hatred expressed in sincerity, friendship, disassociation and hostility, not only does it seriously impact on Muslimínon-Muslim relations, it also has a great influence on the attitudes of Muslims towards non-Muslim countries and states. Muslim scholars present a wide range of interpretations in this regard. A detailed elaboration on the opinions perceiving it as a divisive term and, the opinions perceiving it as a uniting term, is presented in this chapter. As I conclude stating that the terms Wala’ and Bara’ ˯΍ήΒϟ΍ϭ ˯ϻϮϟ΍ (sincerity and disassociation) cannot be perceived as an obstacle in the way of coexistence, in the sixth chapter, I elaborate on the issue of civic duties. Is it islamically permissible for Muslims to fulfil civic duties when living in non-Muslim countries? What should Muslims do if there is a contradiction between their Islamic duties and civic duties? In the sixth chapter these questions are tackled from an Islamic point of view. As I conclude stating that Muslims should fulfil their civic duty, in the seventh chapter another Islamic term, Taqseem Al-Dar έ΍Ϊϟ΍ ϢϴδϘΗ (classification of the world), is explained. This term has a profound impact on the perception of land. Hence, it affects the fulfilment of civic duties and also the issue of coexistence. In this chapter an explanation of all types of lands is presented. This includes the impact of the current circumstances on the typology of the lands. Upon reaching this point and out of the paramount importance of the issue of Fiqh, a detailed study is presented on Fiqh Al-Aqalliyat ΕΎϴϠϗϷ΍ ϪϘϓ (Fiqh of minorities). In this chapter a number of points including the impact of circumstances, place and time on Fatwa are raised. Also an elaboration on Da’wah as one of the characteristics of Fiqh Al-Aqalliyat ϪϘϓ ΕΎϴϠϗϷ΍ (Fiqh of minorities) is presented. A comparison of Da’wah in a Muslim country and a non-Muslim country is presented, stressing that even Da’wah varies from one place to another. In the eleventh chapter a detailed explanation on the foundation of Fiqh Al-Aqalliyat is presented. According to the foundation, one discerns that it is not a fabricated Fiqh and that it is not open to individuals’ desires.\n\n12\n\nChapter One\n\nAs it is permissible for Muslims to live in a non-Muslim country and acquire non-Muslim citizenship, and, there is a Fiqh on the basis of which their affairs can be organised, in the twelfth chapter an elaboration on responsible Islamic coexistence is presented. In support of this argument examples of coexistence in the Qur’an and Sunnah are cited.\n\n1.1 Methodology This study presents an Islamic theological legal discourse on the issue of living in non-Muslim countries and acquiring non-Muslim citizenship. Outlined in this study are opinions expressed by a wide range of Muslim jurists, who lived in different historical eras and belonged to various geographical locations. In other words, they were related to different contexts. In this study, their arguments are quoted with the logical and scriptural proofs supporting them. This is followed by a deliberation, highlighting critical points in arguments presented by each group of Muslim jurists. Part of the scriptural proofs is represented by a citation of a number of Qur’anic verses. To translate these verses I depended largely, with minor and sometimes major amendments, on the translations provided by Abdullah Yusouf Ali, Ahmad Ali and Pickthall. This book aims to achieve three main contributions. First, it aims to present certain Islamic concepts in English, which are available only in Arabic. It also aims to collect and elaborate on the main opinions and issues pertaining to the coexistence of Muslims in non-Muslim countries and, to present these in one book. Finally, it presents the rich literature of the European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) pertaining to the issue of MuslimínonMuslim relations. This literature is available in Arabic only. Hence, this is the first time to present it in English. Moreover, the atmosphere of the discussions held in the ECFR’s sessions could be discerned in this study, since the author of this book has attended most of these sessions and translated most of their final statements. This book aims to present a Muslim inward vision of the status of the coexistence of Muslims in nonMuslim countries. In order to develop the book, it is proposed to anchor it in a number of Research Questions, which, in turn, will set specific Research Objectives and suggest a research process to explore the present pertinent concepts related to the coexistence of Muslims in non-Muslim countries, the associated concept of Muslims acquiring non-Muslim citizenship in these countries, and the emergent theological and sociological consequences related thereto. The following Research Questions are proposed:\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\n1- What is the present status of Muslim theology on the concept of coexistence of Muslims in non-Muslim countries? 2- What is the present status of Muslim theology on the concept of Muslims acquiring non-Muslim citizenship in non-Muslim countries, where there is a peaceful coexistence? 3- How can the theological consequences relating to the coexistence of Muslims in non-Muslim countries be contextualised at the present time? 4- How can the sociological consequences relating to the coexistence of Muslims in non-Muslim countries be contextualised at the present time? 5- What is the ideal theological teaching on coexistence of Muslims in non-Muslim countries in the twenty-first century? 6- What is the ideal theological teaching on Muslims acquiring nonMuslim citizenship in non-Muslim countries, where there is peaceful coexistence? These Research Questions set the Research Objectives of the book which are as follows:1- To explore the present status of Muslim theology on the concept of coexistence of Muslims in non-Muslim countries. 2- To explore the present status of Muslim theology on the concept of Muslims acquiring non-Muslim citizenship in non-Muslim countries, where there is peaceful coexistence. 3- To put into context the present-day theological consequences relating to the coexistence of Muslims in non-Muslim countries. 4- To put into context the present-day sociological consequences relating to the coexistence of Muslims in non-Muslim countries. 5- To suggest the ideal theological teaching on coexistence of Muslims in non-Muslim countries in the twenty-first century.\n\n14\n\nChapter One\n\n6- To suggest the ideal theological teaching on Muslims acquiring non-Muslim citizenship in non-Muslim countries, where there is peaceful coexistence. The book develops an academic exposé of the questions indicated and utilises the continuous forum meetings of European Imams as a major source of information and knowledge.\n\nNotes 1\n\nMuslims tend to have consensus on certain issues but also many Islamic issues are subject to various interpretations. 2 Bérengère Massignon “Islam in the European Commission’s System of Regulation of Religion”, Islam in Europe Diversity, Identity, and Influence, Aziz Al-Azmeh and Effie Fokas, eds (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 125. 3 Ibid. 4 Jocelyne Cesari, “Muslim Identities in Europe: the Snare of Exceptionalism”, Islam in Europe Diversity, Identity, and Influence, Aziz Al-Azmeh and Effie Fokas, eds (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 50í1. 5 Ibid. 6 Tariq Ramadan, born in 1962, is an Egyptian Swiss national who was born in Geneva.

Describing it as one of the Islamic legislative sources, which the Muslim nation should abide by regarding new issues, Al-Ghazali called this analogical reasoning.

He migrated to Damascus with his father, Mulla Ramadan, when he was four years old. He acquired his Alamiya degree in Al-Azhar University. He also acquired an educational diploma in the faculty of Arabic, Al-Azhar University. In 1960 he was appointed as dean in the faculty of religion at Damascus University and in 1965 as instructor in the college of law of Damascus University and the dean. At present, he is a member in the Royal Society of the Islamic Civilization Researches in Amman, Jordan. He is also member in the High Council of Oxford Academy in England. Al-Buti wrote about forty books on the sciences of religion, literature, philosophy and sociology, the problems of civilization and others. Among his books are Manhaj Al-Hadarah Al-Islamiya Fi Al-Qura’n and Huriyat Al-Insan Fi Dhil ‘Ubudiyathu Lilah. 48 Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Ibn Ibn Abu Salih Ibn Abu Bakr Al-Sarakhsi was a famous Hanafi jurist who died around 1096. He had a remarkable memory. AlSarakhsi’s opinions on law have been widely cited and he has been thought of as a distinctive writer. He spent around fifteen years in prison, during which he wrote his famous book Al-Mabsut and some other books. His books include Usul alFiqh, the Kitab al-Mabsut, and the Sharh al-Siyar al-Kabir. 49 Shams Al-Din Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr, Ibn Al-Qayyim al-Jawziyya was born in a small farming village near Damascus, Syria in 1292. He was educated by his father and renowned scholars. He also was taught by Ibn Taimiyyah who kept him in his company as his closest student and disciple; later, he became his successor. Because of his opinions, he was imprisoned. Ibn Jawziyya taught Islamic Jurisprudence at al-Sadriyya school in Damascus, before he held the position of the Imam of the Jawziyya School for a long period. Most of his writings were compilations. But he also authored several books and manuscripts preserved today in the central Library of Damascus. His books include Tahthib Sunan Abi Dawoud, Al-Kalam al-Tayyib wa-al-‘Amal al-Salih, Zad al-Ma‘ad etc. Ibn Al-Qayyim died in Damascus in 1350 at the age of sixty.\n\nCHAPTER TWO THE CONCEPT OF CITIZENSHIP\n\n2.1 Introduction Muslim and non-Muslim thinkers such as Al-Qaradawi, Ben Bayiah,1 John J Patrick,2 Joseph Carens3 and Derek Heater4 exerted great efforts to reach a recognised definition of citizenship. Nevertheless, none of these definitions appear to be universally applicable. However, the fact that in various historical periods a great number of scholars deliberated on the issue of citizenship indicates clearly the paramount importance of this matter. The notion of citizenship is pertinent to the question of Muslimnon-Muslim coexistence that is addressed in this book. It is therefore important to elaborate on various definitions and perceptions of citizenship, especially as some relate to reciprocal rights and responsibilities, which bring forth a number of questions. An elaboration on these questions will be presented in the fourth chapter. In this chapter, answers to the following questions will be investigated: What is the significance of citizenship? What rights and responsibilities does citizenship entail? Does citizenship show a level of flexibility that allows a broader concept of social identity? How do Muslim thinkers understand this term? What are the significant contributions by Muslim thinkers to the perception of citizenship? Does the land have Islamic significance?\n\n2.2 Citizenship: Definitions and Perceptions Birte Siim5 and Judith Squires6 argue that citizenship is a contested concept, which is at the centre of policy debate. Citizenship has different meanings, institutional designs and patterns, cross-nationally. The definition includes three different dimensions: individual rights and obligations; political participation including the right to vote; and belonging to nation states.7 This definition seems to be inclusive, yet it is general in a sense that it states rights and obligations in broad terms. It leaves room for a wide\n\n20\n\nChapter Two\n\nrange of interpretation. For instance, today’s issue of freedom of expression represented by the Danish cartoon controversies caused tension and counter-tensions worldwide. Some described the publishing of the Danish cartoons by Jyllands-Posten as an exercise of freedom of expression, while others perceived it as an insult. The publication of these cartoons was sanctioned by Carsten Juste, the paper’s editor, as no one agreed to publish a book about Muhammad. Juste refused to apologise and argued that this publication was to test whether Islamic terrorist threats could limit freedom of expression or not. This publication caused outrage among Muslims.8 If these rights and obligations are limited to legal rights and obligations, it will ease such a conflict. For instance, if it was banned by law to jest at religious values, such a conflict would not exist. According to Humphrey Marshall,9 citizenship refers to a status bestowed on those who are full members of a community.10 This is a very brief description, when compared to the description given by others such as Will Kymlicka,11 who defines citizenship as a matter of treating people with equal rights under the law.12 C. Lynn Smith13 states that in Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Ltd case,14 the Supreme Court decided that citizenship is defined as membership in a state where citizens are entitled to rights and responsibilities relevant to allegiance and protection.15 Again, allegiance and protection are flexible terms. Is this allegiance the be-all and end-all allegiance to the state or does it allow other aspects of social identity? If it is the former, then it creates a level of difficulty for multicultural and multifaith societies as well. What are the limits of protection that the state provides? Is it the protection Paul claimed in the time of the Roman Empire, which stated that citizens were protected against scourging as punishment for crimes? If the answer is yes, then it contradicts democracy based on equality perceived as the cornerstone of citizenship by other scholars, such as Derek Heater. The concept of citizenship comprises three main dimensions. The first dimension is that citizenship is a legal status, which is defined by civil, political and social rights. The citizen is the legal person, free to act according to the law and, is entitled to claim the law’s protection. It does not mean that the citizen will necessarily take part in the law’s formulation, nor does it require that rights be uniform for all the citizens. The second dimension is that citizens are perceived as political agents, actively participating in political institutions. The third dimension is that\n\nThe Concept of Citizenship\n\n21\n\ncitizenship is described as having a membership in a political community that furnishes a distinct source of identity.16 Joseph H. Carens also argues that citizenship has three dimensions, namely the legal, the psychological and the political.17 He adds that these dimensions interact with each other in a complicated way. The legal dimension of citizenship refers to the formal rights and duties, which a citizen, as a member of a political community, possesses. The psychological dimension of citizenship refers to a citizen’s sense of identification with the political community to which he/she belongs. The political dimension refers to a citizen’s sense of representational legitimacy of those who have the authority to act on behalf of the political community. Dominique Leydet defines a citizen as a member of a political community who enjoys the rights and assumes the duties of membership.18 Leydet elaborates that, for Aristotle, the citizen is the one capable of ruling and being ruled in turn. Citizens are, first and foremost, “those who share in the holding of office”.19 John Patrick agrees with Aristotle’s perception of citizenship but, he is more specific and he also provides a new dimension.20 Patrick argues that citizenship is the legal link between individuals and their political community. He states that citizens are entitled to certain rights and responsibilities that, if not fulfilled, can be detrimental to the cause of democracy. Patrick mentions that citizenship entails certain duties such as paying taxes, serving in the country’s armed forces when called upon, abiding by laws, demonstrating commitment and loyalty to the democratic political community and state, constructively criticising the conditions of political and civic life, and participating to improve the quality of political and civic life. In spite of the fact that John Patrick perceives that citizenship and democracy are intertwined and interrelated, he believes that the fulfilment of certain duties, such as military service, is essential for the establishment of citizenship. For one reason or another, a citizen might choose not to take part in a military action. According to John Patrick, this curtails his/her right of citizenship. But in a democratic society, alternatives should be provided and values chosen by citizens should be taken into positive consideration. Andrew F. March21 states that the attributes of citizenship include affirmation of the legitimacy of the political community, and constitute\n\n22\n\nChapter Two\n\none’s contribution to its welfare and to that of fellow citizens, resulting from social co-operation and willingness of political participation.22 According to Virginia Leary,23 the concept of citizenship has defined rights and obligations in the Western world since the time of the Greek and Roman civilizations. Leary argues that, in addition to certain rights in the state, Roman citizens were protected against scourging as punishment for crimes. Leary adds that the concept of citizenship acquired a bundle of rights such as the rights of political participation. Leary states that during the French Revolution, the concept of citizenship implied the rejection of certain privileges claimed by the nobility and the belief that all men were equal.24 Derek Heater argues that citizenship is a form of socio-political identity, which sometimes lives in harmony with other forms, competes with them, becomes dominant, is submerged or subdued by others, and sometimes it is a distinct form from others.25 Heater argues that initially citizenship evolved as the relationship of the individual to the state, which, if weakened, also weakened citizenship.26 Heater mentions that three ways forward should be identified: first, institutions should encourage citizens to take part in their society; second, an acceptance that citizenship is not the be-all and end-all of one’s social identity; and third, citizens should be taught about their multiple identities. Although Heater states that citizenship, in its basic sense, means living and being committed to a nation-state that involves entitlement to certain rights and fulfilment of given duties, he believes that all should be tolerant of the different religions, social habits and political beliefs, i.e. a recognition of horizontal citizenship.27 Such flexible understanding of citizenship accommodates and recognises people’s right to different forms of social identity that can coexist harmoniously. This perception is vitally important since the issue of coexistence and integration currently occupies a major part of the public concern in every country. Liberal citizenship gives a different dimension to the concept of citizenship. According to Walzer,28 the liberal model of citizenship can be traced back to the Roman Empire. The Empire’s expansion led to the expansion of citizenship rights. Hence, citizenship meant being protected by the law rather than participating in its formulation or execution. It became an important but occasional identity, a legal status, rather than a fact of everyday life.29 The Roman experience shows that the legal\n\nThe Concept of Citizenship\n\n23\n\ndimension of citizenship is potentially inclusive and indefinitely extensible. According to the liberal tradition, which developed from the seventh century onwards, citizenship is a legal status. Political liberty is essential as a means of protecting individual freedoms against interference by other individuals or the authorities. But citizens exercise these freedoms in private associations and attachments, rather than in the political domain.30 In light of the above-mentioned arguments, there are two different models: the liberal approach presents citizenship as eligibility for political office and the traditional approach presents citizenship as a legal status.\n\n2.3 Muslim Citizenship Muslim scholars also present a wide range of rich Islamic literature on citizenship. Sultan argues that in many countries there is no difference between citizenship and nationality. Nevertheless, each country has different sets of regulations organising rights and responsibilities that vary from one country to another.31 All citizens should have equal rights and duties. The equivalent Arabic term to citizenship is Muwatanah ΔϨρ΍Ϯϣ. It has the following derivatives: Ϧρϭ Watan: home Ϧρϭ΃ϭ ϪΑ Ϧρϭ Watana Bih and ‘Utana: to reside ϦρϮΘγ΍ Istautana: to make a place or a country home. Ϧρ΍Ϯϣ Muwatin: citizen It is very significant here to state that the term Ϧρ΍ϭWatana, meaning to coexist, is not included as one of the derivatives of Muwatanah. Nevertheless, it is mentioned in the Al-Mu’jam Al-Waseet dictionary as follows: Ϧρ΍ϭ Watana: to coexist with others in one country (new derivative).32 Bin Baiyah argues that the concept of citizenship has recently been changed. According to Bin Baiyah, it is now defined as reciprocal relations among a number of individuals living on a piece of land not\n\n24\n\nChapter Two\n\nnecessarily descending from the same lineage or sharing the same historical memories or religion, but rather being subjected to the same constitution that specifies all rights and responsibilities.33 Bin Bayiah perceives citizenship as an institution that people optionally choose to join. Once they join, they enjoy the same rights that all members enjoy. The values of such a group, unlike the situations in the past, are not based on a common religion, race or history, but rather on the presumption that diversity itself is a great value that gives room for the accomplishment of harmony through integrating various distinctive elements to attain public interests in a way that does not recognise superiority of some strata nor impose inferiority on others.34 In his perception of citizenship, Bin Bayiah describes citizenship as a vehicle for integration and bridging gaps among members of one and the same society, bringing about a homogeneous society that recognises differences. This perception is practical as we are living in an era of globalisation where people of different races share one and the same society. Nevertheless, it raises a number of theological questions for Muslims: Can a Muslim acquire non-Muslim citizenship? Can a Muslim have loyalty to the non-Muslim land, the citizenship of which he/she holds? What does Islam say about coexistence? An elaboration on these questions will be provided in the fourth chapter. The issue of non-Muslim minorities in Muslim lands is significant, yet it is not an issue planned to be covered in this book. Hence, no elaboration on it will be provided. Nevertheless, as an example, the Egyptian situation is briefly discussed. The second article in the Egyptian constitution stated: “Islam is the religion of the state, and the Arabic language is its official language. The principles of Islamic law are the chief source of legislation”. The Egyptian understanding of the principles of Islamic law has not deprived the Egyptian Christian minority from occupying towing positions in the state. For instance, Mr Boutros-Ghali, a Christian Egyptian, served as a Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from October 1977 until 1991. In May 1991 he was promoted to deputy prime minister for international affairs by President Hosni Mubarak. Yusuf Wahbah, a Christian Egyptian, born in Cairo in 1852, worked as a judge in the appeal court in 1914 and as Minister for Finance and, in 1999, as the Prime Minister. Muhammad Imarah argues that Islam is one of the main sources of legislation in Egypt, where non-Muslim minorities live and flourish under the Islamic principle: “They enjoy equal rights to the rights we enjoy and have equal responsibilities to the responsibilities we have”. It is\n\nThe Concept of Citizenship\n\n25\n\nclear that the Egyptian constitution has been formed in light of the Charter of Medina (for more details see Appendix 4). In fact the rights of the Egyptian Christians are secured by Shari’ah. The High Egyptian Administrative Court issued a sentence on the basis of which Pope Shenouda III, who was the 117th Pope of Alexandria and the Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Apostolic Seat of Saint Mark the Evangelist of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, was supposed to permit divorced Christians to marry. Pope Shenouda appealed the sentence arguing that since the principles of Islamic law are the chief source of legislation for the Egyptian constitution, the Church has the right to run the Christian family issues according to their belief as in the Qur’an it is stated: “Let the People of the Gospel judge by that which Allah hath revealed therein. Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are evil-livers” (Trans. 116:47). On 7 July 2010, the High Egyptian Administrative Court issued a sentence giving the Church the right of settling Christian family issues according to their faith. Nevertheless, in various historical eras, non-Muslim minorities suffered discrimination due to religious misinterpretation. For instance, as stated by Mr A. (anonymous for the purposes of privacy) in an interview I had with him, in Libya currently there is a Coptic community that the government refuses to recognise and denies its existence.\n\n2.4 A New Dimension of Muwatanah is Love According to Faysal Maulawi, Muwatanah signifies the action of belonging to Watan. It is an interaction between people and place resulting in love for the Watan and leading to reciprocal rights and responsibilities between human beings and the Watan wherein they reside. This description is similar to some of the above-mentioned descriptions. Nonetheless, it adds a new dimension. It states that the relationship between people and the place they reside is based on love. This is a new dimension added to the concept of citizenship.35 Maulawi adds that according to Ibn Khaldun, people commonly residing in a place naturally have multiple links. They essentially set up authorities to run their affairs and lead them against others. People usually submit themselves to these authorities.36 According to the definition given by Faysal Maulawi, another dimension is added to the concept of citizenship. Muwatanah is no longer\n\n26\n\nChapter Two\n\na mere belonging to a place. It also involves belonging to the people sharing the place and the regime ruling their relations and affairs. Maulawi adds that Muwatanah also constitutes, in effect, a certain type of support for authority. It actually organises a set of integrated rights and responsibilities between citizens and their Watan. When responsibilities are not duly fulfilled, then citizens will not be fully entitled to their rights and vice versa.37 Maulawi establishes a reciprocal link between rights and responsibilities, which is originally an Islamic concept. This is manifested in Islamic legislation organising relations among people, for example, that children owe their mother more than their father, since she accepts more responsibilities towards them than their father. It seems that Maulawi’s view is a manifestation of his Islamic education. When a human being migrates he/she misses his/her relatives and friends and the land where he/she forms these relations. This is a normal feeling. Animals, birds and fish cover long distances in their journeys of migration and then they return to their homes to which they have a strong feeling of belonging. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, when leaving Mecca, said: “O Mecca! What a good town you are! What a dear town you are! Had not your people led me to leave I would have never lived elsewhere.”38\n\n2.5 The First Watan in Islam The first Islamic Watan was established in Medina as declared by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, when he announced in 627 the Constitution of Medina (ΔϨϳΪϤϟ΍ ΔϔϴΤλ), also known as the Charter of Medina, constituting the first Islamic multicultural and multi-religious society in history made up of Muslims, Jews and Christians.39 The document was drawn up with the objective of bringing to an end the bitter intertribal fighting between the clans of the Aws and the Khazrah í two Arab tribes dwelling in Medina. It also included non-Muslims living in Medina, forming a cohesive society. To this effect it instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish and pagan communities of Medina, bringing them within the fold of one community. The Constitution established security for the entire community. It also guaranteed religious freedom to all individuals living in Medina. It enabled all tribes to enjoy stable tribal relations within\n\nThe Concept of Citizenship\n\n27\n\nMedina. It imposed a tax system for supporting the community in times of conflict, establishing parameters for exogenous political alliances.40 This means that the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, understood citizenship in terms of a set of reciprocal rights to which citizens were equally entitled to, and responsibilities that citizens should have fulfilled. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, also perceived citizenship as allegiance and protection. By virtue of citizenship, citizens in the Medinite society, on the one hand, had to have allegiance to the state of Medina and protect Medina and were, on the other hand, entitled to protection against all types of aggression. All citizens enjoyed equality and freedom of belief and religious practices.41\n\n2.6 An Islamic Comprehensive Perception of Watan John Patrick argues that in some countries citizenship is based on the place where one is born, whereas in other countries it is based on parents’ citizenship, and other countries use both bases for granting citizenship.42 He adds that in most democratic countries there are procedures of naturalisation. There is an Islamic theory of Watan, which is more comprehensive than Patrick’s argument and states that the issue of Watan dates back to the time of Adam and Eve. The creation of Adam and Eve, in Islam as in other monotheistic religions, marked the beginning of all human beings. The story of the original parents is the origin of a huge number of generations over many millennia. It is stated clearly in the Qur’an that Adam and Eve were the first human beings to appear on earth. It stated: “And when thy Lord said to the angels: Verily, I am placing a viceregent on earth” (Trans. 2:30). Then the verses portray the story of sending Adam and Eve to earth. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: “You all come from Adam and Adam was created from dust. There is no superiority of an Arab over a non-Arab, nor is there a superiority of a white over a black except for piety.”43 Hence, according to Islam, Adam is the father and origin of all mankind and Eve was created from Adam. The earth is the origin of all human beings and it is the place where they reside. Muhammad Kamali44 states that some Muslim scholars argue that both Adam and Eve are the origin of all human beings. In the Qur’an it is stated: “O! Mankind observe your duty towards Allah who created you from a single soul and created its mate of the same kind and created from them countless of men and women” (Trans. 4:1). The phrase Khalaqakum\n\n28\n\nChapter Two\n\nMin Nafsin Wahidatin ΓΪΣ΍ϭ βϔϧ Ϧϣ ϢϜϘϠΧ , “He created you from a single soul”, indicates that Eve was not created from Adam’s rib but rather in the same way Adam was created í God breathed into both of them their souls.45 According to Sayyid Qutb,46 the phrase “and created its mate of the same kind” reveals a fact that had people comprehended it, it would have saved them serious errors such as the perception that woman is the source of impurity, adversity and evil. Eve was created from Adam. Hence, they had the same nature and disposition.47\n\n2.6.1 The Phases of Adam and Eve’s Creation Dust:48 When Allah willed to create Adam, He commanded the angels to bring dust of different colours from all over the earth. This dust was the origin of Adam. Mud:49 Water was poured over the dust, converting it into sticking mud. In this stage Adam remained for forty years. That period was so long that the mud became hard to the extent that if one had knocked at it, it would have produced a sound like clay. In the Qur’an it is stated: “He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of pottery” (Trans. 55:14). Fashion:50 Allah fashioned Adam in the form of a human being and bestowed upon him many faculties such as hearing and sight. Adam remained in this phase for forty years, and then the soul was breathed into him. For a certain time Adam lived in paradise on his own. While he was sleeping, Allah created Eve from Adam’s rib without any pain. When Adam woke up he saw a woman next to his head. It was Eve. Both of them lived in paradise and Allah permitted them to eat from all the trees therein, except for one tree, and warned them against Satan. He, Satan, insinuated, tempted and deceived them. He swore to them that if they ate from the forbidden tree they would be imperishable. In the Qur’an it is stated: Then We said: O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not get you both out of paradise, so that you will be distressed. Verily, you have (a promise from Us) that you will never be hungry therein or naked. And you will suffer not from thirst therein nor from the sun’s heat. Then Satan whispered to him, saying: “Shall I lead you to the tree of\n\nThe Concept of Citizenship\n\n29\n\neternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away?” Consequently, they did eat from it and as a result the divine command, to go down to the earth to be tested, was issued. Allah promised to send revelation and whoever abides thereby will go to paradise. This sketch is portrayed in various verses in the Qur’an. In the Qur’an it is stated: “And we said: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be the wrong-doers. Then Satan made them slip therefrom (paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time. Then Adam received from his lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him. Verily, He is the One who forgives, the Most Merciful. We said: Get down all of you from this place (paradise), then whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, whoever follows My Guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve. (Trans. 2:35-38)\n\n2.6.2 The Earth is Watan for Adam’s Children On the basis of the above-mentioned story of the creation of Adam and Eve and their descent to earth, it is self-evident that Allah gave the whole of the earth to Adam and Eve as a home. Nobody disputed with them regarding any part of it. All human beings are the children of Adam and Eve. Hence, they, and all of them, are the heirs of the inheritance of Adam and Eve, i.e. the entire earth. Consequently, to purportedly state that this land belongs to a certain race is not a valid claim, since Adam and Eve did not write a will. The common parents left behind a common property. Moreover, certain areas have natural resources. By virtue of the abovementioned argument, all human beings hold a share in the earth. This concept of commonality and shareholding, if established, will lead to a revolution in the concept of coexistence. It will establish justice and equality. It will make all human beings share and care as they all will feel that the earth is theirs. Al-Qaradawi highlights that when the children of Adam increased in huge numbers, they spread all over the world and, by virtue of man’s social inclinations, they gathered together in certain locations forming cities, towns and villages. The inhabitants of these cities, towns and villages formed links with each other by means of marriages, colleagueship, friendship, kinship, etc. As a result of the increasing numbers of cities, towns and villages, the concept of Watan, i.e. citizenship has been formed.51\n\n30\n\nChapter Two\n\nAccording to Al-Qaradawi’s perception as outlined above, Watan is formed of a number of regions in which people are united by religious, social or political factors. The concept of Watan, i.e. citizenship, is based on a human being’s need for a place in which citizens belong. In addition, Al-Qaradawi’s perception is pluralistic, yet limited to religious, social and political factors. He also agreed with Maulawi’s foundation of citizenship, which is love for the place and people. In his explanation of the link between Islam and the concept of citizenship, ‘Imarah52 states that the viability of establishing a religion is entirely dependent on finding a geographical location, reality and citizenship. Hence, belonging to a country is deemed an essential component in establishing a religion.53\n\n2.7 The Significance of Watan in Islam Al-Qaradawi stresses that, in spite of the fact that some might argue to the contrary, under the pretext that it is a material issue and Islam focuses on spiritualities, land is of paramount insignificance in Islam. The perception is that Islam is concerned solely with human beings who walk on the land. According to Al-Qardawi this is a fatal error.54 Al-Qaradawi adds that Islam perceives human beings as an amalgamation of both material and spiritual aspects. They are made of dust and the soul that Allah breathed in them. In the Qur’an it is stated: “Behold! Thy Lord said to the angels: ‘I am about to create man, from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape; when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My spirit, fall ye down in obeisance unto him’” (Trans. 15:38-39). Then Allah commanded Adam and Eve to descend to the earth that Allah had prepared for their life. In the Qur’an it is stated: “It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth” (Trans. 15:39). Among the fundamental missions that Allah assigned to humans on earth is being Allah’s viceregents and accomplishing prosperity. In the Qur’an it is stated: “Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: ‘I will create a viceregent on earth’” (Trans. 2:30). And in another place He said: “To the Thamud People (We sent) Salih, one of their own brethren. He said: ‘O my People! Worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. It is He Who hath produced you from the earth and settled you therein: then ask forgiveness of Him, and turn to Him (in repentance): for my Lord is (always) near, ready to answer’” (Trans. 11:61). Human beings have been assigned certain responsibilities towards the whole earth in general. These\n\nThe Concept of Citizenship\n\n31\n\nresponsibilities become more definite when it comes to the land where they have been born or taught or brought up. The concept of viceregency has comprehensive implications. It provides a number of values for shaping social life and clarifies the status of human beings and their position and responsibilities towards the rest of the creatures. Allah is the real owner of the earth. Human beings are not the owner of the earth but rather trustees and stewards.55 This Islamic concept can be compared to the Christian concept of dominion: “And God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the Cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth’” (Gen 1:26). The biblical term “dominion”, which derived from the Hebrew verb radah, grants humans the right to rule over all the other creatures. It positions the human race above the rest of the world’s components. Such a conclusion is confirmed by the use of radah elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, where it refers to the rule of the head of the house over household servants (Lev 25:43) and of Solomon’s officers over his conscripted labour force (1 Kgs 5:16 [Heb; 1 Kgs 5:30]). Radah signifies the power, control and authority of one individual or race over another. The concept of dominion agrees with the Islamic concept of viceregency in terms of the belief that God created human beings and created the entire universe for their interest. Nevertheless, Islam intertwines this honour with the responsibility of caring for this universe. In the Qur’an it is stated: “He created you from the earth and Ista’marakum ϢϛήϤόΘγ΍ hath made you husband it” (Trans. 11:60). When referring to Watan, “home”, the Qur’an applies a very significant term, i.e. Diyar “homes”. The Qur’an recognises the emotional relationship between the people and their Watan. Moreover, it ranks the displacing of people as a major sin and mentions it in the same context of committing suicide. In the Qur’an it is stated: “If We had ordered them to sacrifice their lives or to leave their homes, very few of them would have done it” (Trans. 4:66). In the context of the stories of the previous nations, the Qur’an highlights the vital importance of Diyar, by stating that it is a duty incumbent upon people to defend their Watan (land) even if it involves\n\n32\n\nChapter Two\n\nfighting. In the Qur’an it is stated: “Hast thou not turned thy vision to the Chiefs of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Musa? They said to a Prophet (that was) among them: ‘Appoint for us a king that we may fight in the cause of Allah.’ He said: ‘Is it not possible, if ye were commanded to fight, that ye will not fight?’ They said: ‘How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, seeing that we were turned out of our homes and our families?’” (Trans. 2:246) The fact that the terms Watan, Dar and Diyar have been mentioned many times in the Qur’an reflects its paramount importance in Islam: it is mentioned that “Allah hath given you victory on many fields (Autan)” (Trans. 9:25). Again, it is stated: “Bethink thee of those of old, who went forth from their Diyar in their thousands, fearing death”, and in the Qur’an it is stated unto them: “Die; and then He brought them back to life. Lo! Allah is a Lord of Kindness to mankind, but most of mankind gives not thanks” (Trans. 2:23). In this verse the Qur’an applies the same term, i.e. Diyar referring to habitations. The only reason for people being driven out of their Diyar is fear of death. In other words, love for Diyar comes after love for life. The Qur’an stresses: “And when We made with you a covenant: Shed not the blood of your people nor turn (a group of) your people out of your Diyar. Then ye ratified (Our covenant) and ye were witnesses (thereto). Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from their homes” (Trans. 2:84-85). In this verse the term Diyar is applied to refer to dwellings. Displacing people is listed as one of the prohibitions along with shedding blood. To be mentioned in such a context reflects how evil it is in Islam to displace people. In an indirect way this is recognition of the deep emotional relationship between people and their Diyar. In the Qur’an it is stated: “And their Lord hath heard them: Lo! I cause not the work of any worker, male or female, to be lost. You precede one from another. So those who fled and were driven forth from their Diyar and suffered for My cause, and fought and were slain, verily I shall remit their evil deeds for them and verily I shall bring them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow í A reward from Allah. And with Allah is the fairest of rewards” (Trans. 3:195). Here the term Diyar is applied to people’s homes. Another indication of its importance is that Allah promised paradise for those who suffer displacement for His sake.\n\nThe Concept of Citizenship\n\n33\n\nThe Qur’an clarifies: “So when the time for the first of the two came, We roused against you slaves of Ours of great might who ravaged (your) Diyar, and it was a threat performed” (Trans. 17:05). In this verse the Qur’an applies the term Diyar to countries. Allah describes ravaging Diyar as a punishment. In the Qur’an it is stated: “And He caused you to inherit their land and their Diyar and their wealth, and land ye have not trodden. Allah is ever able to do all things” (Trans. 33:27). In this verse the Qur’an again applies the term Diyar in reference to homes. Giving Diyar to the believers is mentioned as a reward and this shows the value of Diyar in Islam. The Qur’an explains: “And (it is) for the poor fugitives who have been driven out from their Diyar, who seek bounty from Allah and help Allah and His messenger. They are the loyal” (Trans. 59:08). Here the Qur’an applies the term Diyar to homes. Allah states that leaving the Diyar for the sake of Allah is evidence of loyalty and this is an indication of the paramount importance of Diyar. In the Qur’an it is stated: “Allah forbiddeth you not regarding those who warred not against you on account of religion and drove you not out from your Diyar that ye should show them kindness and deal justly with them. Lo! Allah loveth the just dealers. Allah forbiddeth you only those who warred against you on account of religion and have driven you out from your homes and helped to drive you out, that ye make friends of them. Whosoever maketh friends of them í (All) such are wrong-doers” (Trans. 60:08-09). This verse applies the term Diyar to homes. Another indication of the paramount importance of Diyar is that according to Islam, Muslims are permitted to be on good terms with non-Muslims provided they do not fight against Muslims on account of their religion, nor drive them out of their homes. The Qur’an also states: “But they denied him, and the dreadful earthquake took them, and morning found them prostrate in their Diyar” (Trans. 29:37). In this the Qur’an applies the term Diyar to dwellings. It states that punishment was afflicted on them in the dearest place to them, i.e. their Diyar, and this is another indication of the importance of Diyar in Islam.56 Based on the above-mentioned verses it can be easily discerned that Watan, “home, land, country, citizenship”, is not limited to one’s place of birth, but rather it includes the place where one lives and the place that one\n\n34\n\nChapter Two\n\nhas taken as a home. The above-mentioned verses clearly describe a congregational ownership of the watan and not an individual ownership.\n\n2.8 The Legitimacy of Changing Watan Al-Qaradawi states that human beings do not choose their homes. It is part of their destiny, just as one’s parents are his/her destiny. Whoever is born in Egypt is destined to be Egyptian and whoever is born in Ireland is destined to be Irish. Nevertheless, many people, whether willingly or unwillingly, have changed their homes. They have migrated to another place and made it their home, wherein they are settled.57 Al-Qaradawi himself, for instance, is an Egyptian citizen, but he migrated and settled in Qatar and acquired Qatari citizenship.\n\n2.9 Conclusion By and large the aforementioned arguments and counter-arguments present citizenship as eligibility for political office and legal status. Citizenship is a contested concept. Nevertheless, there is a kind of consensus with regard to establishing the concept of citizenship on reciprocal rights and responsibilities. This is clearly expressed by Muslim and non-Muslim thinkers. We can also see this clearly in the Code of Medina accepted by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and the non-Muslim communities residing in Medina. In my opinion this reciprocity is a system adapted to organise congregational and individual affairs. Nonetheless, some thinkers expressed these rights and responsibilities in an inclusive way. For instance, John Patrick, whose perception is that citizenship and democracy are intertwined and interrelated, believes that a fulfilment of certain duties, such as military service, is essential for the establishment of citizenship. However, other thinkers present citizenship in more accommodating terms. For instance, Derek Heater argues that citizenship is not the totality of one’s social identity and that citizens should be taught about their multiple identities. Although Heater states that citizenship, in its basic sense, means living and being committed to a nation-state that involves entitlement to certain rights and fulfilment of given duties, he believes that all should be tolerant of different religions, social habits and political beliefs. Muslim thinkers add a new dimension to the concept of citizenship. For instance, Maulawi perceives love as one of the main foundations of citizenship. Moreover, they have a universal concept of citizenship that describes all the children of Adam as brothers and sisters and the entire earth as a Watan for all of\n\nThe Concept of Citizenship\n\n35\n\nthem. These arguments indicate clearly the paramount importance of citizenship throughout various historical periods. In light of this understanding of citizenship, is it islamically legitimate for Muslims to live in a non-Muslim Watan? Is it islamically legitimate for Muslims to acquire or hold non-Muslim citizenship? How important is the question of legitimacy of citizenship in the development of the concept of coexistence of Muslims living in non-Muslim countries? These questions bring us to the next stage of our research: the issue of the legality or illegality of citizenship in non-Muslim countries as evidenced in the literature.\n\nNotes 1\n\nAbdullah Ben Bayiah is a contemporary Muslim scholar and a member of the European Council for Fatwa and Research.
