        "text": "This paper will explore one of Conflict Resolution perspective’s theory which is called as Human Needs Theory in the context of Turkey’s Kurdish question. For decades, Turkey’s Kurds have had conflicts with the Republic of Turkish State for their identity needs, and Turkey has had same conflicts in the context of nation-building and security. Human Needs Theory (HNT) claims that unmet needs cause conflicts, and to solve conflicts needs must be satisfied. This paper will assert that resources of conflict between Kurds and Turkey are unmet needs of two side, in this respect HNT argues that needs are not zero-sum and instead of ‘this or that’ perspective with perspective of ‘both of’ conflicts can be solved. Moreover, HNT claims that there is no hierarchy between needs and needs of both side can be satisfied together. Turkey has seen Kurdish question as security problem, therefore has applied security-based policies. Accordingly, Turkey’s Kurdish questions has not solved for decades. Especially, after the revolution of PKK(Kurdish Worker Party), conflict has been worst and Kurdish problem has seen as terrorism. There is need for alternative perspective for resolving that conflict and HNT is an alternative perspective for such conflicts. When applied HNT, it has seen that the conflict’s resources are Kurdish side’s identity need and Turkish side’s security need. Furthermore, theory claims that both sides’ needs can be satisfied together. This paper will discuss how Kurdish conflict can be solved in the context of Kurds’ identity need and Turks’ security need; after HNT will examine as an alternative conflict resolution theory.\n\nIn analyzing women’s roles in democratization processes, the gender and transition literature focuses on women’s activism before and during the transition of an authoritarian regime towards a democratic one. When it comes to the post-transitional phase; i.e. the consolidation of democracy, the literature usually shifts its focus on the participation of women in formal political institutions to see if the goals of women’s activism have been realized in the newly democratized regime. Although the participation of women in the formal political arena is important for influencing the laws, regulations and policies regarding women’s rights and gender equality, substantial changes in women’s rights regime depend heavily on the vitality of women’s civil societal organizations (CSOs) who can monitor state’s policies on women, point to shortcomings in laws, pressure for gender-sensitive institutional changes and continue to raise public awareness on women’s rights. Employing the case of Turkey’s democratic consolidation process, the paper examines the agency of organized women under the rule of the Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP). Drawing upon the information gathered from in-depth interviews, document analysis and academic surveys on violence against women, women’s rights and discrimination against women, the paper first presents the activities of four groups of women’s CSOs in Turkey- feminist, Kurdish, Islamist and Kemalist women’s CSOs. It then outlines their participation in political decision making processes regarding the aforementioned three issue areas and how the AKP government responds to the demands of women’s CSOs. Thereby, the paper discusses the challenges and barriers women’s CSOs confront in policy making processes. Drawing on findings, the paper critically discusses the role of women’s CSOs in the democratic consolidation process in Turkey. It concludes that increased civic and political participation of organized women have engendered Turkish democracy.\n\nBuildings have what materialist Jane Bennett identifies as a thing-power: they can inspire, provoke and generate emotions among attentive audiences who look at or visit them. But can these emotions really be considered a universal (biological) phenomenon that everybody would feel? The short answer is no. In this paper, I shall demonstrate how the early modern Ottoman elite formed a joint emotional community, whose members were encouraged to practice a unique sense of bewilderment at Ottoman architecture. The early modern Ottoman elite translated bewilderment as wonder. A theory dealing with this emotion was first introduced to the elite in different medieval Islamic treatises written on Wonders-of-Creation. These treatises aimed to examine both the mental and physical nature of wonder. Readers were expected to experience this when they were unable to understand the cause of a thing or how it was supposed to influence them when they saw it for the first time. As such, cosmographies encourage their potential readers to turn sights of aesthetics experiences into an insightful experience of bewilderment/wonder. In early modern Ottoman chronicles, treatises on architecture (e.g., Mimar Sinan's autobiographies), and travelogues (e.g., Evliya Çelebi's Book of Travels), this notion of bewilderment is mentioned in the context of imperial Ottoman monuments. Members of the elite were advised to contemplate imperial complexes like the Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul for instance, or the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, and turn their sights into an insightful experience of wonder. However, this kind of wonder cannot be considered a universal phenomenon; not all who visit these imperial buildings are automatically bound to be bewildered in the same way. Rather, the aforementioned emotional experience of wonder is exclusive to the potential readers who shared a joint early modern Ottoman mentality. Furthermore, this mentality did not continue among the Ottoman elite beyond the seventeenth century. At this point in history, with the influence of modern European studies on architecture, members of the elite abandoned the cosmographic theory of wonder and adopted the European perception of the aesthetics of the structures without the need for contemplation.\n\n\"Voyage to Tomorrow: Futurism and Science Fiction in Middle Eastern Art & Design\", MESA 53rd Annual Meeting, November 14-17, 2019, Sheraton, New Orleans. Organized by Elizabeth Rauh. Sponsored by the Association for Modern and Contemporary Art of the Arab World, Iran and Turkey (AMCA). Chair: Elizabeth Rauh, U Michigan. Discussant: Nasser O. Rabbat, MIT American-Qatari artist, writer, and filmmaker Sophia al-Maria coined the term Gulf Futurism together with Kuwaiti artist-musician Fatima al-Qadiri. As they explained in a Dazed Digital magazine interview: Over the last fifty years, the Arabian Gulf has given birth to a very particular brand of futurism. It is a phenomena marked by a deranged optimism about the sustainability of both oil reserves and late capitalism. Similar to early 20th century Euro-Futurism and mid-century American kitch and retro-futurism, Gulf Futurism is evident in a dominant class concerned with master-planning and world-building, while the youth culture preoccupied with fast cars, fast tech and viddying a bit of ultra-violence. (Al-Qadiri and al-Maria, November 2012) Gulf Futurism explains an existing phenomenon both artists have observed in architecture, urban planning, art, aesthetics and popular culture in the post-oil Persian Gulf. It is a premonition of our global future imbued with science fiction views and technological pessimism. In the last two decades, science fictional art productions together with futurist aesthetics have provided new keys to understanding the present, to critically analyze the past, and to open on utopian or dystopian visions of the future. Giving free way to the unthinkable, the unutterable, science fiction constitutes a main avenue in approaching the complex realities of the Arab Geocultural Space. These representations together with the diasporic condition of many artists, have led to a deep reflection on the notion of ‘uruba (Arabness), searching for new narratives of the autochthonous, as ethnic futurist aesthetics did elsewhere: Finno-Ugrian Ethno-futurism appeared in the 1980s; then came Afrofuturism in the 1990s; Sinofuturism, Indofutusism, Desifuturism, Latin@futurism, and, most recently, Gulf Futurism. This presentation will examine the Gulf Futurism movement through art historical perspectives in Sophia al-Maria and Fatima al-Qadiri’s contemporary projects in order to explore insight into their visual apparitions. Then, we will analyze the different definitions and references attributed to Gulf Futurism in order to understand how this phenomenon became a “starkly avant-garde culture of the Middle East” (Al-Qadiri and al-Maria 2012). Altogether, Gulf Futurism should be understood as a tool used to question and criticize past historical narratives and to formulate new ones that allow to open the horizon to more promising times and to go beyond presentism (Hartog 2003) in the post-oil Arabian Gulf."
