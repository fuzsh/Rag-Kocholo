He deemed this Arab Spring as a rare, difficult, popular step towards freedom.\n\n\"The Arab Spring has not yet ended. It actually just started, and I believe it would last for long years in some countries, so as to finally reach stability in the Arab world overall,\" Geagea estimated.\n\nHe described the Arab unrest as a conflict between two currents, the first eager to equality between citizens in rights and duties, and the second less open and just.\n\nWhen asked about the situation in Egypt and to what extent was it similar to the Lebanese conditions in the mid-70s, Geagea reassured listeners that Egypt did not seem to be heading toward civil war as its circumstances were much different from Lebanon's at the time.\n\nAs for the Syrian crisis, Geagea confirmed that \"sooner or later, Assad's regime will no longer be able to persist.\"\n\n\"It's just a matter of time as the international community is still a bit inconclusive, unlike its stances vis-a-vis Egypt, Tunisia and Libya,\" the LF leader noted.\n\n\"Elections in Syria were not serious regardless of their date. They're just a maneuver by President Assad,\" he considered as well.\n\nEventually, Geagea was asked about his assassination attempt whereby he confirmed that it only aimed at changing the balance of power at the internal scene.\n\nD.K.\n\n© NNA 2012 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Abdul Karim Ali: Mansour keen on Lebanon's effective role in borders' control\n\nWed 2/05/2012 14:28\n\nNNA - 2/5/2012 Syrian Ambassador conveyed Wednesday Minister Adnan Mansour's keenness on Lebanon's effective and positive role in controlling borders and preventing security chaos.\n\nFollowing their meeting, Abdul Karim Ali said that messing with borders' security might negatively reflect on Lebanese-Syrian ties.\n\nAsked about the decision of military interference in Syria and whether it has become certain, the Ambassador said Syria is keen on the success of Annan's peace plan as it deems all weapons smuggling operations as attempts to abort Kofi Annan's plan.\n\n\"These attempts are doomed to failure due to the internal Syrian cohesion as to the Syrian command on carrying out reforms,\" he noted.\n\nPertaining to the vessel \"Lutfallah II\", Abdul Karim said the ship was heading for the Syrian opposition for it was under the patronage of accomplices with opposition members.\n\nThe Lebanese Navy seized Friday a cargo ship suspected of carrying a large cache of weapons headed to Syria, security sources told The Daily Star.\n\nThe vessel \"Lutfallah II\", which bears the Egyptian flag and had been headed to one of Syria's ports, was forced to dock at Selaata port, 50 kilometers north of Beirut, where its cargo is being inspected, the sources said. Members of the crew have been put under arrest.\n\n\"Qatari and Saudi Arabia political and security leaders were also behind this operation and all other operations targeting Lebanese and Syrian security,\" he remarked.\n\nAt another level, Mansour met with Ambassador Ahmed Ragheb, assistant to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Egyptian Expatriates, in presence of Egypt's Ambassador in Lebanon Ahmed Toufic.\n\nRagheb stressed the importance of Lebanese-Egyptian ties and said that respecting both countries' interests is a red line that ought not to be crossed.\n\nBoth men also went over the issue of visa cancellation between the countries whereby Ragheb said he has invited the committee tasked with this issue to visit Egypt so as to follow up on the matter.\n\nL.W.\n\n© NNA 2012 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics -

It was negotiated in Taef, Saudi Arabia.\n\nSleiman held a private meeting with Maronite Patriarch Beshara Rahi on the sidelines of Easter mass in Bkirky.\n\nRahi has come under criticism due to stances supportive of Syrian regime against a year-long popular uprising demanding ousting of President Bashar Assad.\n\n\"The Patriarch represents the principles of Bkirky,\" Sleiman said in Rahi's defense.\n\nCommenting on recent assassination attempt on head of Lebanese Forces, Samir Geagea, the President hoped culprits would soon be brought to justice. He categorically refused to allow instability to reign over Lebanon.\n\nUpcoming parliamentary elections, due in 2013, stirred heated squabble between different political factions, namely March 8 Camp and the Progressive Socialist Party, with the former opting for an electoral law based on proportional representation, while the latter claiming this limited Druze political influence.\n\n\"We live in a democratic country, and I hope we do not return to 1960 electoral law which all factions agree does not suit our day and age.\"\n\nThe President wished all Lebanese happy holidays.\n\n© NNA 2012 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Geagea's assassination attempt premeditated - Zahra\n\nThu 5/04/2012 12:10\n\nNNA - 05/04/2012 - Member of Parliament Antoine Zahra affirmed on Thursday that the assassination attempt which had targeted LF Leader Samir Geagea yesterday was grim and premeditated.\n\nYesterday, Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea escaped an assassination attempt when shots were fired at his residence in Meerab.\n\nAlthough Geagea said he would not accuse any party in the case, he warned that the political assassinations of the last decade had not ended.\n\n\"As if the perpetrators bear the intention, as Dr. Geagea said yesterday, to have this incident as their final massage,\" the Lebanese Forces MP told \"Free Lebanon\" radio station.\n\nBut Zahra ruled out attempts at rushing to conclusions, preferring to wait instead for the outcome of investigations.\n\n\"Reaching investigations' outcome doesn't require a lot of time, but rather more a bit of serious technical work, sweeping operations, the use of high tech apparatuses, which all together will lead us to the perpetrators,\" he added.\n\nHowever, Zahra said the assassination attempt had nothing to do with the 2013 Parliamentary elections, but rather more with the state building project.\n\n\"March 14 insists on projects aiming at building the state and opponents see Geagea standing at the forefront of this team because. He never hesitates to continuously voice his stances [at different levels],\" Zahra added.\n\nAs for March 14 request to refer this incident to the International Tribunal, Zahra linked the assassination attempt to the series of attacks which had targeted March 14 pillars back in 2004.\n\nMarch 14 General Secretariat requested of Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Justice Minister Shakib Cortbawi to adopt necessary measures to warrant the assassination attempt of Lebanese Forces Leader Samir Geagea a referral to the International Tribunal for further investigations, a statement issued by March 14 members said following a meeting on Meerab shooting.\n\n\"I think that the same sides and the same political project are behind the assassination attempt of Samir Geagea yesterday.\"\n\n\"It was not a mere attempt to tamper with security (...) but an definite assassination crime,\" Zahra added, thanking God that Geagea safely survived this incident.\n\nR.H.\n\n© NNA 2012 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Geagea: Shooting incident aims to 'finish everything'\n\nWed 4/04/2012 18:28\n\nNNA - 4/4/2012 Lebanese Forces (LF) Leader Samir Geagea considered that the shooting on Meerab residence was not a sheer message but rather aimed to \"finish everything\".\n\nThe LF leader was speaking during a press conference he held at his Meerab residence on Wednesday, to speak about the gunfire incident.\n\nEarlier today, gunfire was shot toward the residence of LF Leader, Samir Geagea, in Meerab. Security members tasked to ensure the residence's security said they discovered blank cartridges of a sniper rifle, type 12.7.\n\nGeagea disclosed during the press conference that preliminary information showed the probability that the gunfire came from one sniper or more.\n\n\"The side that has undertaken the assassination attempt is professional per excellence,\" Geagea said, saying he awaits the outcome of investigations specially that the shooting incident required strict long distance observation and via up-to-date technological means.\n\n\"Meerab security has not been penetrated and the observation occurred from a remote area,\" the LF leader noted.\n\nGeagea also indicated that a Lebanese Army helicopter is currently prosecuting the culprits in the vast woodlands.\n\nGeagea also refrained from accusing any specific side, saying the perpetrators want Lebanon to turn an exploited arena.\n\n\"We are facing a series of criminality... Some thought that the assassination episode has come to a halt in Lebanon after the Doha Agreement.... But this does not hold true,\" Geagea said.\n\n------------------L.Y\n\n© NNA 2012 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - UNIFIL marks International Day of Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action\n\nWed 4/04/2012 15:29\n\nNNA - 4/4/2012 - The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) today observed the International Day of Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action. A ceremony at the UNIFIL Headquarters in Naqoura marked the 200th point de-mined on the Blue Line, and the head of the UN Mine Action Support Team (UNMAST) roller-skied on the road from Tyre to Naqoura on this occasion.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander Major-General Paolo Serra underlined the importance of visibly marking the Line of Withdrawal (Blue Line) as \"an essential task of our mandate.\" He added: \"Completing the process will reduce the potential for incidents and tensions in the area.\"\n\nThe primary operational task for UNIFIL de-mining teams is to clear paths through minefields for the Blue Line marking process. Currently, UNIFIL has 11 combat engineering teams from its Belgian, Cambodian, Chinese, French, Italian and Spanish contingents.\n\nThe Force Commander honoured the UNIFIL de-mining teams and paid tribute to the de-miners and Lebanese civilians who lost their lives or were injured by mines and unexploded ordnance.\n\nThe Programme Manager of UNMAST, Michael Hands, marked the day by roller-skiing from the city of Tyre to UNIFIL Headquarters, where he was received by the Force Commander.\n\nThis initiative is part of the UN- led \"Lend-your-Leg\" global campaign to stop the damage landmines still cause while showing solidarity with all survivors of landmines and other explosive remnants of war.\n\nDuring 2002-2008, mine clearance in southern Lebanon was coordinated by UN Mine Action Coordination Centre of Southern Lebanon (UNMACC-SL) as a partnership between the UN and Lebanese Armed Forces. With the transition of coordination authority to the Lebanon Mine Action Centre (LMAC) since January 2009, experts from UNMACC-SL - since renamed UNMAST - now operate as an integral part of UNIFIL's de-mining efforts.\n\nAs part of this coordinated effort, UNIFIL de-mining teams have since the 2006 conflict contributed to de-mining around 4.8 million square metres of affected land and destroyed more than 34,000 unexploded ordnance and mines in southern Lebanon. However, mine infestation remains a challenge in southern Lebanon as explosive remnants of war continue to claim innocent victims.\n\n© NNA 2012 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Daouk at AUST: For legal media frames\n\nMon 2/04/2012 19:44\n\nNNA - 2/4/2012 - Information Minister Walid Daouk underlined the necessity of determining legal frames for all media means in accordance with scientific and modern criteria, especially the electronic media.\n\nMinister Daouk was speaking during a gathering with mediamen, organized by American University of Science and Technology (AUST) on Monday, attended by the University's administrative board and students.\n\nDaouk noted that the modern media revolution introduced into the media world a new unusual pattern, citing the example of the world of the internet, Facebook, Twitter and other social communication media that gave the public the opportunity to express its opinion and future projects.\n\n\"This transformation in communication means contributed in accelerating the operation of consecrating new concepts in more than one Arab country (...) that led to popular movements calling for freedom and democracy reaching radical changes, notably acknowledging the necessity of introducing requisite reforms,\" Daouk said.\n\nAs such, the Minister underscored the necessity to set legal frames for social communication media.\n\nDaouk also shone light on the importance of safeguarding media liberties in Lebanon and media work credibility based on set criteria and principles that ensure supreme national interest on one hand, and secure media profession on the other.\n\n\"The right to freedom of expression and critique is amongst basic liberties that contribute to defending democracy and diversity,\" he stressed.\n\nThe Minister also highlighted journalists' freedom in carrying out their press profession while abiding by their duties and rights, especially in specifying information source and avoiding unethical means in search of news and information.\n\nDaouk duly called for the establishment of a supreme council for press profession ethics, made up of journalists themselves to implement profession's rules and principles. The Minister also hoped that a collective agreement would be soon crystallized to ensure immunity for all.\n\n---------------L.Y\n\n© NNA 2012 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - (UPDATE) Local, regional affairs top Mansour-Gafo talks\n\nMon 2/04/2012 16:46\n\nNNA - 2/4/2012 - Foreign Minister, Adnan Mansour, met Monday with the Spanish Ambassador to Lebanon, Juan Carlos Gafo, over a spectrum of political affairs in Lebanon and the broader Arab region.\n\nSpeaking to reporters following the meeting, the Spanish diplomat said talks shone light on the current situation of the Lebanese government, the crisis in Syria, and the outcome of the recent visit to Lebanon by the Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir Abdullahian.\n\nThe meeting also featured high on the Lebanese-Spanish bilateral ties and the means to bolster them on all levels.\n\nOn the yearlong bickering in Syria, the diplomat said he was upbeat over the six-point plan of UN peace envoy, Kofi Annan.\n\n\"We must give a chance to Annan's plan (...) we always encourage dialogue, ceasing violence, and organized transition,\" he said.\n\nGafo's three-year diplomatic mission in Beirut ends in July.\n\nOn the other hand, Minister Mansour met with a European delegation comprised of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats at the European Parliament.\n\nAfterwards, Mansour met with Brazil's Special Envoy to the Middle East, Cesario Melantonio.\n\n\"Brazil is a great economic state and highly concerned with the Middle East affairs as well as with boosting relations on all economic, political, and cultural levels.

He implored them to confront incidents, changes and dangers with courage and to interact with their environment, adopting and defending all just humane causes.\n\nReferring to the situation in Syria, Geagea considered that the real solution lies not in maintaining silence towards the Syrian regime nor in practicing forgiveness towards it, but in actually calling for a true popular referendum, patronized by the Arab League and United Nations, over the regime's persistence. Hence, he considered that the true solution in Syria lies in democracy, in the sense that whoever gets to the rule democratically would govern.\n\nOn the internal Lebanese scene, Geagea moved on to state that the \"Reform and Change\" practices in Lebanon have began threatening the quality of political work and dealing with public matters at a time when people in the region are struggling and dying each day to cross over to a \"green spring\".

But Mikati had voiced reservations over Bassil's proposal, which he saw too costly, and presented on offer from a foreign company to build a power-generating plan within a year.\n\nDaouk depicted the deal as lacking transparence and clarity, and said it was not made at best prices.\n\n\"We did not carry out tenders for the ships but rather an undue prices survey; there was [hence] a consensual agreement instead of tenders and [prices] survey,\" he said.\n\n\"Norms provide that two dossiers be presented, one technical and another financial, and that prices remain concealed,\" he added.\n\nThe Minister made it clear that Premier Mikati's major concern was to provide 24-hour power supply and protect public funds.\n\nHe said that the 20-year-long electricity crisis could not be solved in three months.\n\nHe reminded that during the past government's seniority, nearly 60 companies have skimmed through this dossier, while only nine companies have done as such during the current government's term. \"Where is the book of conditions?\" he wondered.\n\nThe Minister did not fail to quote the reservations of the Environment Minister, Nazem Khoury, over the disagreeable upshot of ships rental on the environment.\n\nOn the possibility that the Ministers of the Change and Reform bloc present their resignation, Daouk said that the government was trying its best to fulfill people's needs and that every party to this government was entitled to have its own viewpoint. \"I believe that the interest of the Lebanese currently provides that the government be preserved, albeit all surrounding tensions.\"\n\nPertaining to the relation between the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, Mohammad Safadi, Daouk said \"what happened was nothing but a summer's cloud.\"\n\nMinister Safadi has publicly supported Bassil's plan for leasing power-generating ships.\n\nBesides, as pointing out respect-based relations with a number of Future Movement's leaderships, Minister Daouk highlighted the obligation to respect ranks and statuses, particularly the position of the premiership.\n\nOn the legalization of the much-heated issue of extra-budgetary 11-billion-dollar public spending, he said that yesterday's session put matters on the right track.\n\nThe cabinet approved five draft laws to conduct an audit on public spending between the years 2006 and 2010 inclusively.\n\nMoreover, the Minister capitalized the importance to appoint a head for the Higher Judicial Council to sidestep any vacuum.\n\nHe also indicated a proposal to change the members of Tele Liban's administration board, noting that the chairperson shall be from the Catholic community.\n\n\"Tele Liban embodies Lebanon's heritage and I do have a plan, not to compete with private televisions, but to enable it [TL] to address the situation of the regions and to [broadcast] guidance programs,\" he said.\n\nMoreover, the Minister underscored the reactivation of the work of the National News Agency, which constitutes \"a producer of news for all the media means.\"\n\nTurning to Baghdad, currently hosting the 23rd Arab Summit Conference, Daouk said that the President of the Republic would shed light, during the summit, on Lebanon's democracy and coexistence and that he would express his viewpoint on the means to have a unified Arab League.\n\nHe considered that talks over the Syrian dossier would stem from the initiative of Kofi Annan, the United Nations peace envoy to Damascus.\n\nSeparately, the Minister met today at his office in the headquarters of Tele Liban in Tallet el-Khayat, the Director General of the Turkish Radio and Television, Ibrahim Chahine, in presence of Tele Liban's Director General Ibrahim Khoury.\n\nTalks reportedly featured high on the means to bolster cooperation between the two institutions and to develop the Lebanese state-run television.\n\nDaouk and Chahine later toured the television's departments.\n\n© NNA 2012 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics -
