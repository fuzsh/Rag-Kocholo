        "text": "The first international symposium on Ibn Ḥazm ever convened, to the best of our knowledge, was held in Spain in 1963 with twenty-five participants. The second such symposium was hosted by the Faculty of Theology, Uludağ University and the Muftiship of Bursa on 26-28 October 2007, in Bursa, Turkey. At the latter symposium, which comprised five sessions, twenty-eight papers and eighteen discourses were presented. The proceedings were published in book form after a delay of three years. Three of the contributions were in English, one was in Arabic, and others were in Turkish. The contributions that were not written in Turkish were published in their original language with a Turkish translation. The work is the fruit of a meticulous editorship and promises to become a significant reference work on Ibn Ḥazm. The proceedings are introduced under the headings of philosophy, kalām, fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), the history of religions, and other fields.\n\nThis contribution presents and discusses the section on different types of knowledge from an epistle by the Muslim polymath Ibn Hazm of Cordoba (d. 456/1064) entitled Risālat al-Talkhīṣ li-wujūh al-takhlīṣ (“Concise epistle on the ways towards deliverance”). Presumably addressed to Ibn Hazm’s fellow-Zahiris, the epistle emphasizes the importance of cultivating the sciences conducive to a proper understanding of the Qur’an and the ḥadīth, while warning against deviating from these two revealed sources and relying on the unverified opinions (raʾy) of individual Muslim scholars. While in other tracts of his work Ibn Hazm also discusses the Greek sciences and the partial usefulness of some of them, what he presents here is a purely Islamic curriculum.\n\nIbn Hazm is one of the most profound thinkers the Muslim ummah ever produced. Despite his preeminence, he has been comparatively neglected in the mainstream scholarship. Ibn Hazm is a multi-talented scholar whose influence transcends knowledge boundaries. In fact, he is a renowned traditionist, historian of religion, theologian, philosopher, great theoretician of the Zahiri School and so forth. Further, he is claimed to have written four hundred volumes on various disciplines. This article provides a historical analysis of the life and times of Ibn Hazm. It discusses the biography, religio-intellectual milieus of al-Andalus during Ibn Hazm's lifetime, the salient aspects of Ibn Hazm's ideas and his views on ethics. Ibn Hazm's views on ethics reject the use of analogical reasoning as a source of religious truth and denial of inspiration (Ilham) as a legitimate means of the ethical knowledge. Ibn Hazm strongly believes in the autonomy of God as the sole source of value judgment, against the rationalist approach of the Mu'tazilah. This study primarily adopts the methods of textual analysis. As ideas do not develop in isolation from the larger contexts, the textual analysis method is aided by the method of historical research.\n\nAbstract: Ibn Hazm al-Zahiri stood out as a critical analyst of Christian scriptures, however without giving any justification (ta'lil). Thus, his analysis methodology is known as the al-Zahiri's Methodology. This paper seeks to introduce his methodology, analyze the approaches, his objections and critiques adopted by him in his study of Christianity. The interaction between Muslims and Christians in al-Andalus (Spain) stimulated Ibn Hazm to master Christianity and its scriptures."
