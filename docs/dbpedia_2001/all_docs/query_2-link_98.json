        "text": "Outcomes of Spinal Fusion\n\nWhat is a Spinal Fusion and how does it work?\n\nSpinal fusion is a surgical procedure in which two or more vertebrae in the spine are fused. It is performed to stabilize the spine, reduce pain, and improve overall spinal function. During the procedure, the surgeon uses bone grafts or artificial materials to create a solid bridge between the vertebrae to be fused. Metal implants such as screws, rods, or plates may also be used to provide additional support and stability during the healing process.\n\nWhat medical conditions can be treated through Spinal Fusion?\n\nSpinal fusion can be used to treat various medical conditions affecting the spine, including degenerative disc disease, herniated discs, spinal fractures, spinal deformities (such as scoliosis or kyphosis), spinal infections, and spinal tumors. It is also commonly performed as part of the surgical treatment for spinal instability, spinal stenosis, and spondylolisthesis.\n\nWhat is the recovery process after a Spinal Fusion?\n\nRecovery after spinal fusion surgery involves a period of immobilization and gradual rehabilitation. Patients may need to wear a brace or undergo physical therapy to support the spine and promote healing. Pain medication and activity modifications may be necessary during the initial stages of recovery. The length of the recovery process can vary depending on the individual, the extent of the surgery, and the specific condition being treated. It is important to attend follow-up appointments and undergo rehabilitation exercises to improve the pace of healing and restore function. Complete recovery can take several months."
