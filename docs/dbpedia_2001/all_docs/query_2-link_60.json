Along the way several individuals and institutions supported me and deserve recognition. Much of the material from the book was located in the Library of Congress, where I spent a great deal of time as a graduate student. I would like to thank the Middle East librarian in the law library, George Sfeir, who helped me and shared his own scholarly work. The library had a vast array of juridical materials (fiqh, fatwas, and commentaries) that I would like to encourage researchers to use more often than they do. The Middle East Reading Room of the Library of Congress was also extremely helpful during the course of this project.\n\nAs for my research in Syria, the majority of my time was spent in the Center for Historical Documents (Markaz al-Watha’iq al-Tarikhiyya). Both the late Dr. Da‘d Hakim, former director of the center, and the current director, Dr. Ghassan Obeid, did much to facilitate this research. The center’s staff has become my friends and family away from home. I would like to also thank the French Institute of Damascus (Institut Français d’Études Arabes de Damas–IFEAD/IFPO) which has been a source of great help for me. The staff, in particular Issam Chehadat and Ali al-Ali, was willing to help even when my book requests fell far into the recesses of the collection, including a far-away storage facility. Jen Johnson of Penrose Library at Whitman College is a miracle worker and has gone out of her way to find material for me to use in remote Walla Walla, Washington.\n\nI also thank Fulbright, which provided me with a grant to conduct the core of this research in Syria from 1999 to 2001. The Ford Arab-American Chamber of Commerce provided me with a scholarship in 2002 that paid for my final semester of tuition at Georgetown University, for which I am eternally grateful. I also thank the Syrian Studies Association for awarding me the Syrian Studies Association Best Dissertation Prize in 2003, for which I am truly humbled.\n\nSeveral professors helped me along the way, and without their help and guidance I would have never completed the project. I would like to thank Müge Göçek for introducing me to the world of Ottoman studies and, in particular, the shari‘a court records. Salim Khaldieh, instructor of Arabic at the University of Michigan in the early 1990s, was an amazing spirit who died much too young and is truly missed. I do not know how to thank Denise Spellberg for her mentoring that eventually led to me to Georgetown University. John Esposito, the director of the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, and the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown provided me with teaching assistantships that kept me out of Washington, D.C.’s soup kitchens. I would like to thank my adviser, John Voll, for his guidance throughout the years. Special thanks to Amira Sonbol, who became my mentor at Georgetown and saw me through to the end. Her Arabic Sources course was one of a kind and produced some of the early research in my dissertation. Course work offered by Judith Tucker, the late Hisham Sharabi, and Yvonne Seng provided further inspiration for some of the ideas contained within the book. I would like to thank my Ottoman language instructors: the late James Stewart Robinson of the University of Michigan and Yvonne Seng and Gábor Ágoston of Georgetown University. I add the disclaimer that any mistakes made in translation are my very own.\n\nI would also like to thank friends who have been a sounding board for my ideas, read some chapters of this book, and been a source of moral support throughout the years: Theresa Alfaro-Velcamp, Faedah Totah, and Hibba Abugideri. The bond I share with these Arab women inspired me to finish this book and turn a new page in my career. A special thanks to my longtime friend Kathleen LaTosch, who edited an earlier version of this work. Abdul Karim Rafeq has lent crucial advice and expertise throughout the years for which I am grateful. Peter Sluglett read a few chapters and offered amazing comments that helped immensely. I would like to thank Charles Wilkins, my comrade in the archives, who held a common interest in Aleppo that developed into a friendship during some very cold days huddled around the sobiya in bayt Khalid al-‘Azm.\n\nI am most grateful to Mary Selden Evans for her early interest in my work, which has resulted in a working relationship with her and Syracuse University Press, and Annette Wenda, my copy editor, whose amazing pen caught many inconsistencies prior to publication. My colleagues in the History Department at Whitman College have read and commented on chapters during our First Friday research meetings. I am very thankful to Nina Lerman, David Schmitz, Lynn Sharp, Julie Charlip, Brian Dott, Kyra Nourse, Mike Bottoms, and Trey Proctor for the insights and comments about my project along the way. Damascene lawyer Thaier Mourad read and discussed documents with me, offering his perspective on the cases. The Dean of Faculty’s office at Whitman College along with the History Department have always been generous in funding some of my trips back to Syria over the past few years that were crucial to accessing important sources in Damascus. I would like to thank Bryan Lubbers for listening to my ideas and lending his computer expertise that aided the construction of a database containing all of my court records. Cartographer Joseph Stoll of Syracuse University created beautiful maps for the book for which I am grateful.\n\nI would like to thank my family and friends in ‘Aziziya, Aleppo, including my aunt, tantig Elyse Semerdjian, and our close family friend and neighbor, former Aleppo municipality chief and head of the Ministry of Awqaf, Sulayman Nasr (Abu Imad), who passed away in 2006; Abu Imad personally escorted me to various government agencies in my pursuit of missing documents; he was an Aleppo icon and is missed by all.\n\nFinally, my best thanks to Nerses and Sandra Semerdjian, my parents, who came to my rescue with a bag of groceries when I was down to my last pita in graduate school.\n\nA Note on Transliteration\n\nTransliterations are based on a modified version of the system used in the International Journal of Middle East Studies. All Ottoman Turkish terms are transliterated into their contemporary Turkish equivalents. To avoid confusion and to offer more uniformity in the text the Arabic term fatwa (Ottoman Turkish fetva) is used throughout. Ottoman transliteration is used in Ottoman texts. Names of plaintiffs and defendants are transliterated exactly as they appeared in the court record. For clarification, an example of a woman’s name is Fatima bint Muhammad, which literally means Fatima the daughter of Muhammad. Similarly, a man’s name such as Taha ibn Husayn literally means Taha the son of Husayn. The father’s name is provided in the lineage, as last names were not widely used until the nineteenth century. Only prominent notable families such as the Amirzade and Kawakabi families had recognizable last names in earlier periods.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn September 26, 1660, a woman named Zahra from the neighborhood of Jami‘ ‘Ubays on Aleppo’s southern wall was brought to court by her neighbors, including the local imam, Hajj Ahmad ibn Bashar. The residents of the quarter accused Zahra of being mischievous, an evildoer, a fallen woman who had veered off the straight path of Islam. She brings strange men into her home, the residents informed the judge, using a common euphemism for prostitution frequently found in the Aleppo court records. The residents requested that Zahra be removed from their neighborhood, and the court granted their request.¹\n\nThis case of illicit sexual intercourse is one of several that appeared before shari‘a court judges in early modern Aleppo. The verdict against Zahra was consistent with that reached in other cases, namely, removal from the city quarter. However, many Islamists today would promote more severe punishments for illicit sexual intercourse, the crime of zina in Islamic law. Violent punishments for this crime, such as death by stoning, have been advocated by contemporary Islamic movements and incorporated into the legal codes of some Muslim countries as punishment for breaches of sexual morality in the name of a return to a more authentic Islamic law.² Of course, the basis for stoning is not completely unfounded; it is a tradition that can be found in the hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad and the caliph ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (634–44) who apparently encouraged the practice after the Prophet’s death. Later juridical writings gave the practice more support, but the sentences handed down by the courts in the Ottoman period tell another story. In Ottoman Aleppo, the shari‘a court regularly recorded nonviolent, noncorporal punishments in cases like Zahra’s. Not a single documented case of stoning was found in more than three hundred years of shari‘a court records studied.³ So, how is it possible that the punishments handed down by the shari‘a courts in Aleppo are so radically different both from the precedents established in the early Islamic period and from the punishments prescribed by later Islamic legal theorists? How did jurists reconcile the contradictions between the theoretical, doctrinal law that they were trained in as students and the law they practiced in the shari‘a courts?\n\nAccording to the shari‘a, Zahra’s crime was zina, which Joseph Schacht has defined as fornication or any sexual intercourse between persons who are not in a state of legal matrimony or concubinage.⁴ Many discussions of Islamic law seek a normative definition for crimes in an attempt to create parallels with legal concepts that Western readers would find familiar. However, in the end they fail to flesh out all the dimensions of crimes that have been discussed and debated in a vibrant Islamic juridical discourse over many centuries. Zina, as defined through the volumes of juridical writings produced by Muslim scholars, encompasses a wide range of sexual violations: it is an umbrella category for several offenses found in modern Western codes of law, including adultery, prostitution, procurement, abduction, incest, bestiality, sodomy, and rape. To redefine our concept of the crime demands an examination of some of these complex juridical conversations; hence, I have conducted an archaeology of zina crime beginning with its earliest references in the Qur’an. Later, criminal cases of zina will be tested in one locality, Aleppo, Syria, in order to better understand, as much as can be done given the limitations of the sources, the way in which zina-related cases were treated in the court of law.⁵ Furthermore, zina is discussed within the larger context of public morality in a specific geographical setting, in order to understand the way that a local court and its surrounding community defined the boundaries between permissible and forbidden behaviors.\n\nSeveral studies of law and society have been produced in recent years, but Aleppo has not been part of that conversation. Historians have been engaged in various kinds of study with court records, using them to reconstruct the social and political history of Aleppo, such as the works of Abraham Marcus and Margaret Meriwether. Aleppo’s economic history and its non-Muslim communities have been discussed in two carefully crafted monographs by Bruce Masters, but for Syria as a whole, no one has contributed as much as Abdul Karim Rafeq, who has used court records from four major cities in the Syrian archives, including Aleppo, and has written on numerous political, economic, and social issues.⁶ One study in particular focuses on public morality in eighteenth-century Damascus and raises important questions of gender and morality. Rafeq argues that the century marked an increase in various forms of moral breaches, including prostitution, suicide, and troublemaking. Importantly, for this study, he argued that quarter solidarity provided the vehicle for adjudication of crimes against the moral order. Many of the arguments advanced in this important article are tested in this study.⁷\n\nAll the cases used in this study were found in the shari‘a court records (sijillat al-mahakam shar‘iyya) of Aleppo, an invaluable source for our understanding of the practice of Islamic law. Aleppo’s court records illustrate the workings of the Ottoman administration in the period under study. Almost all the records are in Arabic, although a few are in Ottoman Turkish. I have also consulted collections of Ottoman kanunnames and Ottoman fatwas, which present the perspective of imperial law, in an attempt to give a holistic approach and to cover some historical and legal material pertaining to the practice of the central Ottoman state. A combination of materials, including selections from the vast amount of fiqh documents available in Arabic, particularly those from the Hanafi school of law, have been used in an attempt to compare legal theory with court practice. The virtual absence of secondary studies dealing with zina and Islamic law has led me to rely predominately on primary sources from Syria, namely, the records in the Syrian National Archives (Markaz al-Watha’iq al-Tarikhiyya) and juridical literature (fiqh and fatwas). As a result, the scope of the Islamic legal literature was quite large, so I selected volumes that would have influenced a Hanafi jurist in the period under study.\n\nThe methodology I have chosen has been influenced by several fields; comparative studies in Islamic law and society have been particularly influential.⁸ Several studies in the past decade have chosen to compare the shari‘a court records to juridical writings found in fiqh and fatwas in order to compare doctrine with the actual practice of the court. This has been the methodology of Amira Sonbol, who has cross-referenced Egyptian court cases with juridical texts. Judith Tucker has compared fatwa literature with court records in her study of gender discourses in Ottoman Syria and Palestine. Leslie Peirce’s microhistory of Ottoman ‘Aintab also compares and contrasts the body of juridical literature with an examination of practice as shown in the court records.⁹ I have chosen to borrow this comparative model of analysis in my examination of Aleppo court records, with two exceptions.\n\nFirst, after examining the state of the archives in Damascus, including the manuscripts now housed in the Asad Library, I discovered that there were only a few fragments of fatwa collections from Aleppo; however, none of the ones with a discussion of zina were from Aleppine jurists, which made it impossible to compare Aleppine fatwas with the local court records in a systematic way. That being said, a few fatwas are used from those collections and other fatwas that were cited within the court records themselves, composed by the hand of the court scribe. Hence, I have used the imperial fatwas of Ebu’s Su‘ud Efendi, supreme religious leader (sheikhul-islam of the Ottoman Empire from 1545 to 1574) during the reign of Süleyman I in order to understand better the imperial discourse on gender and sexual criminality. These fatwas are examined in chapter 2 in conjunction with the imperial law codes, the kanunnames.\n\nThe second way that I depart from some of the models I have chosen is that I do not engage in a microhistory of Aleppo based on the court records. Microhistory has been popular in the field in recent years, but there are a number of reasons for my not having chosen that approach.¹⁰ To begin with, the court records found in Aleppo, as will be demonstrated, are quite formulaic and rarely provide the lengthy narratives and richness of detail of, for example, the Inquisition cases that have formed the microhistories of other parts of the world.¹¹ Furthermore, the nature of the sources and the way in which the material is recorded make it difficult to understand the underlying motivations of the individual participants. Any attempt to understand those motivations is quite speculative.¹² Therefore, I have chosen to analyze only the bits of data I found useful from the sijills—names of defendants and plaintiffs, neighborhoods, social titles, narrative choices—and use this information to understand the adjudication process.\n\nMy method of digging through the layers of zina discourse in order to understand the history of this crime and the way it was treated in court is intended as an attack on the pervasive discourse of Muslim sexuality that has real effects on the way shari‘a is interpreted today. By systematically documenting a legal discourse on illicit sexuality, I seek to fill in a crucial gap in both academic and lay understanding of the shari‘a and to continue a conversation initiated by Fatima Mernissi in the late 1980s, when she broke down a centuries-old barrier to female interpretation of Muslim traditions.¹³ Her original critique published twenty years ago is just as important today as it was then.\n\nCurrent Islamist discourse often looks to the doctrinal prescriptions of the law and takes them at face value, ignoring the ways that Islam allowed for flexibility of interpretation. In many ways, the Islamist understanding of Islamic law is similar to that of the Orientalist tradition: timeless, stagnant, and rigid in its interpretation of law.¹⁴ Even historical precedents are often taken out of context in order to suit political agendas. Feminists like Mernissi, who discusses this preoccupation with the past and the way that it has been used to advance the patriarchal interests of contemporary politicians, call it the misuse of memory.¹⁵ This problem is by no means exclusive to the postcolonial Muslim world; rather, it is a cross-cultural phenomenon. The misuse of memory can be seen in various aspects of twentieth-century Islamic revivalism, in which crimes against the moral order, specifically zina, have often been punished with the death penalty, ignoring the larger legal process established by jurists as well as the way in which such cases have been treated historically. Hence, the process of resuscitating draconian punishments found in Islamic doctrine but not in judicial practice has been in many ways ahistorical, an example of the all too familiar process of the invention of tradition to shore up a supposedly failing moral order. Advocates have selected some passages of hadith to support the implementation of stoning, since it is suspiciously absent from the Qur’an, yet have simultaneously disregarded hadiths that provide strict criteria for conviction. This revivalism has also been encouraged through the republication of several classic treatises on the law that advocate corporal punishment for zina. Browsing through bookstores in the Arab world reveals a flood of newly (re)published works on women and morality in Islam, most of which, it should be emphasized, were originally written during the first five Muslim centuries. These publications, coupled with a dynamic contemporary Islamic discourse on morality and gender, have resulted in a particular convergence of the past and the present—the use of history to justify an authoritarian political agenda concerning women and morality. Therefore, exploring the actual historical position of women, gender, and morality becomes even more pressing as it stakes out the ground upon which the battle over morality in Islamic law will be fought.\n\nThis project is also part of an ongoing conversation about the theories and practice of Islamic law. Much of our understanding of Islamic law has been shaped by Western theories, such as those of Max Weber, who embraced the Oriental despotism model originally formulated by Marx and Engels (and elaborated further by Karl Wittfogel in the 1950s) to describe the political development of Asia.¹⁶ In this theory, the court of law is a microcosm of the despotic state, in which the judge (qadi) sits as the patriarch of his courthouse. Weber, and others, on the basis of no particular body of evidence, argued that the judge arbitrarily meted out punishments as he saw fit, without rhyme or reason. The system, called kadijustiz, has been described as one in which judges never refer to a settled group of norms or rules but are simply licensed to decide each case according to what they see as its individual merits.¹⁷ Weber argued that the reason kadijustiz was prominent in Islamic society was owing to the legal structure in which outside forces wielded little influence on the decisions of the judge, a position that parallels the stance of the sultan vis-à-vis the state. The judge administered justice alone, his decision was final, there was no appeal system, and justice was swift and immediate. Hence, there were no lawyers to influence judicial decisions, nor did the Islamic world have a commercial class that could influence legislation and check the powers of the polity. For Weber, this situation marked a departure from the Western legal system, making Islamic law exceptional.¹⁸ Orientalists long held that Islamic law was practiced arbitrarily and its legal tradition was stagnant, although such fundamentally inaccurate notions have been challenged by recent scholarship.¹⁹ A revisionist approach to Islamic law and society has developed over the past two decades in the work of Brinkley Messick, David Powers, Muhammad Khaled Masud, Judith Tucker, Wael Hallaq, and others, who have demonstrated convincingly that Islamic law developed as positive law, based on historical precedent and as part of a rational body of legal thought.²⁰\n\nA major part of the debate has been centered on the history of Islamic law and its development throughout the centuries. Scholars have claimed that (Sunni) Islamic law was stagnant because of a process called \"the closing of the gates of ijtihad (legal reasoning)\" in the ninth century. It was in that century that after two centuries of debate jurists began to view the corpus of work developed as exhaustive and complete. It was indeed a real debate, discussed by both foreigners and Arabs, including the travel narrative of Mouradgea D’Ohsson and the writings of Syrian jurist Husayn al-Jisr, respectively.²¹ Whereas Orientalist scholars argued that the gate was closed, new scholarship has argued to the contrary. This revisionist school in the field of Islamic law and society developed after 1984, when an important article by Wael Hallaq entitled \"Was the Gate of Ijtihad Closed?\" was published. Hallaq demonstrated that although Orientalist scholars argued that ijtihad had been stifled, jurists continued to refer to the process in their writings. Soon after Hallaq opened the debate, several books were published that focused on the consistent use of ijtihad in the formulation of fatwas. Authors such as Messick, Powers, and Tucker have worked extensively with fatwa literature that existed after the alleged disappearance of ijtihad to in fact show that it was a vibrant, ongoing tradition in Islamic law.²² Later, Hallaq published an article that connected the process of issuing fatwas (ifta’) to legal manuals to demonstrate the connection between doctrinal law found in juridical writings and fatwas, both of which use legal reasoning but also have a basis in the living law in Muslim communities.²³\n\nOne of the overarching goals of this study is to determine the way Islamic law was practiced in the courts of early modern Aleppo. The examination of multiple sources reveals a discrepancy between the theoretical prescriptions of the law found in legal manuals, that is, what could be called doctrine, and the practice of law in the courts.²⁴ Doctrine produces what could be called a symbolic construction of gender relations that can be found in the writings of Muslim jurists versus the sometimes complicated social relationship of gender that is, to quote Judith Tucker, the product of the historical development of human experience, a relationship that changes, evolves, and adapts in rhythm with a changing society.²⁵ Does this adaptation mean that law was practiced arbitrarily as kadijustiz? The answer to that question is an unequivocal no. Despite the disparity between the theory and the practice of law in Aleppo, there is a consistency in the verdicts that judges issued in matters of public morality and the crime of zina. In fact, it is quite difficult to find much change in the way these crimes were punished throughout the 359 years of court cases used in this study.²⁶ I argue that this lack of change in punishment is a result of the consistent application of the local interpretations of law by the numerous judges who entered the court. It was customary for judges to take traditions of law into consideration so long as it did not overtly contradict the shari‘a. This consistency should not be mistaken for stagnation or lack of development. The cases themselves vary in frequency and type within various periods, marking social and political changes in Aleppine society. Through these changes, societal norms for treating deviancy, rather than regulations laid down by the state, were consistently upheld by the courts.\n\nThis study of moral deviancy is useful for challenging the dominant paradigms found in Orientalist scholarship about law and society for several reasons. First, the study of morality and deviancy forces us to throw out Orientalist misconceptions about sexuality and law in the Islamic world. The fact that an active, illegal flesh trade existed in Aleppo demonstrates that an underground economy functioned there, as in many other places, and opens the door to possible comparative histories of gender and morality in the future. Second, it forces us to look at the way in which law functioned in society, rather than isolated solely as a text. Textual analysis alone simply does not get at the agency of local actors shaping the practice of law in their own communities. This book will demonstrate that communities defined deviant behavior outside the Islamic juridical framework, yet the courts adapted to"
