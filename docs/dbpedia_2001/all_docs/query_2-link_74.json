This document provides an introduction and overview of the book \"Me & Rumi\" which contains translated excerpts from \"The Discourses of Shams-i Tabrizi\". It summarizes that the book presents first-hand accounts of Shams, Rumi's spiritual companion, which provide insight into his vivid personality and role in transforming Rumi from a scholar to a Sufi poet. This counters previous stereotypes created through secondary sources that mythologized Shams. The introduction aims to bring Shams to life through his own words for the first time.",
