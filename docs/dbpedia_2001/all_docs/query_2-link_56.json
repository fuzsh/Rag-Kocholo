Gemayel and the NDU incident\n\nSat 5/11/2011 14:52\n\nNNA - 05/11/2011 - Kataeb Party Boss, Amine Gemayel, criticized what he termed as a \"new law designed for punishing merry-making and celebration.\" He however, regarded the electoral outcome at NDU as a model for democracy and not just a triumph for the Kataeb Party rather than for March 14 as a whole.\n\nAddressing a group of NDU students who visited him today, Gemayel spoke highly of the new generation of Kataeb youth and condemned the \"new law\" designed to punish any celebratory gesture. He vowed to carry on with the mission of a free and dignified Lebanon.\n\nGemayel traced back Kataeb experience far reaching to the student revolt in the 1990s dubbed as the Cedar Revolution and stressed that the Kataeb shall never henceforth bow to any beating.\n\nHe concluded that Lebanon of the Future shall be under the law and the constitution.\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Hariri warns against attempts to circumvent Arab initiative\n\nFri 4/11/2011 16:00\n\nNNA - 04/11/2011 - Press Office of Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri issued Friday the following statement: \"Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri congratulated the Lebanese in general and the Muslims in particular on the occasion of Eid Al-Adha, hoping that this occasion would be a good opportunity for all Lebanese parties to reflect on the situation the country is in, because of the attitude of those who use illegal weapons to intimidate others, and because of the attempts to forcefully anchor Lebanon to foreign axes in order to divide the Lebanese people. Such behavior may have a serious impact that threatens the unity of the state, entity and institutions.\n\nHariri called on all loyal citizens to unite their efforts to consolidate national unity and consecrate the state's sovereignty and power over all the Lebanese territories; a state that would respond to the aspirations of the Lebanese to preserve their free democratic system and the formula of coexistence among all Lebanese parties.\n\nHe underlined the importance of solidarity with the Arab peoples calling for freedom, particularly the Syrian people bravely confronting the military repression machine, and seeking to move into a free democratic system. He also warned against the attempts to circumvent the Arab initiative through devious methods which totally contradict the provisions of the initiative that calls for the end of the cycle of violence and of the killing of demonstrators. He also warned against evading the obligations to release the political detainees, under week pretexts that will not fool the Syrian people.\n\nHariri also congratulated the Libyan people on the occasion of Eid Al-Adha, praising the progress they achieved to get rid of the previous regime and their quest to establish a new phase that meets the ambitions and aspirations of all Libyans.\"\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - US decision to cut off UNESCO funding earns Siniora's rebuke\n\nFri 4/11/2011 15:15\n\nNNA - 4/11/2011 - Head of Future parliamentary bloc, MP Fouad Siniora, on Friday said the decision by the US and Israel to cut off their share in UNESCO funding dealt a blow to both Arab and world public opinion.\n\nThe US said last Monday it would cut off funding for the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, shortly after the group voted 107 to 14 to accept Palestine as a full member herein.\n\nThe cutoff deprives UNESCO of 22% of its funding.\n\nSidon Deputy saw that the US had best reconsider this decision as it flouts values claimed by the American people and constitutes a barefaced bias towards Israel.\n\n\"It is a clear message to the Palestinians that the US is against people's right to freedom and independence and that it is still unable to assume the honest mediator role,\" he said.\n\nHe called the Arab League, Arab and Islamic leaders, and friendly western states to collect amounts due on Israel and the US, in a step which he deemed as likely to foil US and Israeli pressures and intransigence.\n\nR.A.H.\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Hezbollah weapons to be merely defensive, says Shehayeb\n\nThu 3/11/2011 16:49\n\nNNA - 3/1/2011 - Member of Parliament Akram Shehayeb told Voice of Lebanon radio station on Thursday that [Southern] borders must be demarcated and that Hezbollah's weapons should be merely defensive.\n\nHe stressed that the Special Tribunal for Lebanon would be eventually funded and that Lebanon cannot shrug off its international commitments.\n\nOn the proposed electoral law, Mountain's Deputy said proportionality aimed at eliminating a segment of the Lebanese. \"They had best lower the voting age and allow expatriates to cast ballots before venturing into an electoral law,\" he said.\n\nTurning to Syria, PSP Deputy underlined \"we have put a road map with the Syrian regime and we did not conciliate with the authority, yet with both the authority and people.\"\n\n\"We do not meddle into Syrian affairs, but we express our opinion in what is happening in Syria,\" he added.\n\nHe refused that Lebanon be, in any way whatsoever, a ground for any security action.\n\nHe saw that ISF Chief, Major General Ashraf Rifi, was a brave and responsible man.\n\nR.A.H.-L.Y.R.\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Wehbe: Syria's approval of Arab plan aims at gaining time\n\nThu 3/11/2011 10:59\n\nNNA - 3/2/2011 MP Amine Wehbe said Thursday that Syria's approval of Arab plan to end security chaos is nothing but an attempt to gain time.\n\nFuture bloc member told Voice of Lebanon radio that a decision to cease fire would have been taken if ever the Syrian initiative were to be true.\n\nThe Syrian government has accepted several measures suggested by the Arab League aimed at halting the violence in the country, including the removal of tanks and armored vehicles from the streets, the Arab League said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nPertaining to yesterday's legislative session Wehbe prescribed the government as being unconscious for Finance Minister did not provide clear answers for proposed projects.\n\n\"Majority speeches were marked with leniency with collaborators and justification for Syrian oppression,\" he said.\n\nThe MP added that confronting Israel is not restricted with a sole military dimension.\n\nWehbe deemed other party's practices, planting schism in the society and demolishing constitution, to be in favor of Israel.\n\nL.W.\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Syrian transgressions mere underestimation to Lebanese authority: Zahra\n\nWed 2/11/2011 13:39\n\nNNA - 2/11/2011 - Parliament member Antoine Zahra said the Syrian transgressions to the Lebanese sovereignty mirror Syria's underestimation to the Lebanese authority.\n\nThe Deputy told Free Lebanon radio station Wednesday that giving no excuse to these violations is humiliating as it reflects the Syrian embassy's disrespect to Lebanon's sovereignty and the superiority prevailing over Syria's relation with Lebanon.\n\n\"The Syrian embassy's presence in Lebanon should've by now settled the sovereignty issue between the two country, putting terms to all sorts of breaches and interference in the Lebanese internal affairs,\" he accused, adding that what surprises him the most is the Lebanese authority's silence over these violations which are reoccurring daily.\n\nAs for the towering rate of tension between Aoun and Jumblatt, Zahra said the main reason is the former's middle position as well as his non-readiness to make things easier for Aoun to fulfill all his aspirations.\n\nZahra accused Aoun of willing to take over the administrative appointments affair by choosing whoever fits his ambitions.\n\nSeparately the Deputy said all the Lebanese know Samir Geagea's and the Lebanese Forces' mission is to put down all sorts of strives that Aoun and his allies are working hard to flare up along the Lebanese territories.\n\nD.K.\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Toursarkissian: Stability in electoral law important\n\nWed 2/11/2011 09:33\n\nNNA - 2/11/2011 - Future Parliamentary bloc member Serge Toursarkissian told Voice of Lebanon on Wednesday that it is illogical that the electoral law in Lebanon keeps changing all the time, stressing that stability in electoral laws is important for the people and constituents.\n\n\"Every time a political team comes to office, it quickly changes the rules of elections and seek to change the political crew in district where it suffered a loss in the last election,\" the MP argued.\n\nToursarkissian added that the political team which reaches office also tries to implement the proportional representation in elections just to check the rise of the rival political camp.\n\nThe MP noticed that there are several views on proportional law, reminding that any decision regarding election law must enjoy two third of votes in the Cabinet before sending it to the parliament for approval.\n\nToursarkissian said that some ministers apparently did not grasp yet how proportional electoral law is calculated and this illustrates the difficulty of implementing such a system in complicated country like Lebanon.\n\nO.H\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Gemayel after his visit to the Serail: We cling to STL\n\nTue 1/11/2011 17:45\n\nNNA - 1/11/2011 Kataeb Party Head Amine Gemayel voiced adherence to the principle of Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), saying reaching the truth and achieving justice in the Country constitute the main gateway for national unity and reconciliation.\n\nGemayel was speaking following his visit to Prime Minister Najib Mikati at the Grand Serail on Tuesday, where they deliberated over an array of matters, including the issue of international tribunal.\n\nGemayel highlighted the Lebanese distinguished role in spreading the culture of dialogue, peace and communication among all segments of society, the basis for the Lebanese formula and coexistence.\n\nOn the other hand, Premier Mikati met with former Prime Minister Selim Hoss where they saw eye to eye over current hour issues.\n\nMikati then met with British Ambassador to Lebanon Tom Fletcher where they discussed preparations underway for Mikati's forthcoming visit to London.\n\nFletcher stressed on emerging on the necessity of respecting Lebanon's sovereignty by all countries.\n\nInformation Minister Walid Daouk also visited Premier Mikati at the Serail, where they discussed relevant media issues and proposed projects especially with regards to electronic information law.\n\nMikati also met respectively with Ukrainian Ambassador to Lebanon Vladimir kuval, and UNICEF Representative in Lebanon Ana Maria Lorini.\n\nOn the other hand, a delegation of Army Command handed Mikati an invitation to attend the military parade marking Independence Day at Chafic Wazzan Boulevard in Beirut.\n\n---------------L.Y\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics -

We hope that you continue this path, and achieve the historic dream of the Palestinians and Arabs, which is the establishment of the full Palestinian state, as soon as possible.\"\n\nAl-Qeeb\n\nThe message addressed to the new interim Prime minister of Libya Libya Abdel Rahim Al-Qeeb is the following:\n\n\"We received with great satisfaction the news of your election as head the National Transitional Council's executive council, an election that puts you directly in charge of Libya's transition to a new political stage that folds previous tragic and bitter experiences, and lays the foundations of a democratic constitutional State that meets the aspirations of the Libyan people for freedom, progress and justice.\n\nThe role played by the NTC, headed by Mustafa Abdul Jalil, constituted the focal point in liberating Libya from the era of tyranny, and it is up to you to pursue the work in the same path, and succeed in the formation of an executive council that draws a road map for Libya's future.\n\nOn behalf of all the Lebanese who expressed their solidarity with the Libyan people and its free uprising, I offer you my heartfelt congratulations, asking God Almighty to guide your path and help you with your brothers in the Transitional Council and the coming executive council to lead Libya towards progress, prosperity, stability and freedom.\"\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Rahi leaves to Iraq on a solidarity visit\n\nMon 31/10/2011 17:14\n\nNNA - 13/10/2011 Maronite Patriarch Mar Bechara Boutros Rahi said his visit to Iraq comes to express solidarity with Iraqi people and Christian brethrens, stressing that the Maronite Church is always against violence and war.\n\nPatriarch Rahi left Beirut on Monday afternoon heading to Iraq, to partake in the first commemoration of Notre Dame Church explosion in Baghdad that left 48 victims of worshippers a year ago inside the said church.

All decisions to raise the minimum wage should be in accordance with the rise of consumer prices,\" the minister said.\n\nNahhas stressed that the natural course is through the price index committee without stopping on the behavior of the General Labor Confederation.\n\nThe minister suggested that any attempt to find a solution without the consent of the price index committee is considered as an attack on the prerogatives of the minister.\n\n\"The judicial opinion has put things in perspective and has justified the state as a sponsor for social relations in the country.\"\n\nNahhas explained that the Cabinet will base its new decision to increase salaries on the average cost of living which is issued by the price index committee, adding that the increase should be a lump sum and this will be applied to all salary scales.\n\nThe minister refused the unjustified rise in prices every time there is a salary adjustment.\n\n\"The Cabinet will take a decision on salary increase in five to 10 days.\"\n\nO.H\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - DAS Jake Walles Visits Lebanon\n\nWed 26/10/2011 15:30\n\nNNA - 26/10/2011 - U.S. embassy in Lebanon issued on Wednesday the following press release: \"Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, Jake Walles, completed his visit to Lebanon during which he met with senior officials to discuss the political, security, and economic situation in Lebanon, as well as the current situation in Syria.
