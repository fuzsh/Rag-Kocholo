Itâs about how entire ecosystems evolve and converge together to serve common consumer objectives.â\n\nFor Tamanna Padhi, digital transformation for consumer and retail companies isnât just a one-time event, itâs a continuous processâand sheâs constantly seeking out new ways to transform businesses across food and beverage, beauty, e-commerce, and other sectors.\n\nâTransformation really goes beyond technology because it needs to be a fundamentally different way you are thinking about your business,â she says. âItâs not about just a few tools. Itâs about the whole culture of leadership in thinking digital-first.âÂ Â\n\nAnd she loves nothing more than equipping teams with the process and tools they need to head off on their own digital journey. Sheâs particularly proud of one food and beverage company her team recently supported. âDigital is now part of their DNA,â she says, âwhich fundamentally changes the direction of their growth, as well as the culture from within.âÂ Â\n\nTamanna has worked in six different Kearney offices around the world, and she says they all have three factors in common: their problem-solving methods, dedication to their clients, and a friendly atmosphere. âA common theme that has been seen across all Kearney teams and Kearney partners is they really put themselves in the shoes of the client and try to answer what is best for them, not just the best intellectual answer,â she says.Â\n\nâThey really want to answer the question in essential rightness,â she says. âAnd not just find an answer, but also get to the bottom of how that answer is going to manifest itself. That really makes your work impactful.âÂ Â\n\nâI fundamentally believe that an idea is as good as how well you can describe it and implement it.â\n\nMohammed is always open to new opportunitiesâfrom solving existing problems to business development.\n\nAnd as a partner in Kearneyâs consumer and retail team in the Middle East and Africa, he has the opportunity to drive transformational change across a diverse set of geographies, industries, and markets.\n\nâItâs a lot of different moving parts, which keeps it very interesting,â he says. âAnd we have so many opportunities to do deep content and impact work, which is what keeps me in this business.â\n\nMeeting with new clients, working with them to understand their problems, and creating steps to solve them through deep collaboration is the part of the process Mohammed loves best.\n\nâWeâre sharing our experience, but also our time,â he says. âThat comfort is required.â And sometimes the problems turn out to be different from what the client originally thought they would be. âI enjoy serving as that thought partner and trusted advisor, helping them get clarity on what the real issues are,â he says.\n\nMohammed worked at Kearney early in his career before moving on to explore other opportunities in the consumer goods industry. When an opportunity arose for him to return, he took it. âRather than following a brand or following a specific industry, itâs about following people you can learn and grow from, which Iâve always had at Kearney,â Mohammed says.\n\nCEO, PJP Investments Group (Papa Johns United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan & Iraq)\n\nBSc in Mathematics from St. Xavierâs College & a Business Diploma from NMIMS, Mumbai, India, Tapan started working in restaurants from his University days â loved his work so much, he never left the industry.\n\nNow a veteran in the industry & on Caterer Middle East Power 50 List 2020 & 2021; RetailME ICONS awardee for 2021; Tapan is currently CEO of PJP Investments Group, owner-operators of Papa Johns in the UAE, KSA, Jordan & Iraq.
