Kyriazi Freres (also spelled Kyriazi Fr√®res) was a cigarette manufacturing company established in 1873 in Egypt. The company was founded by Ioannis Kyriazis, together with his brothers Efstathios and Epaminondas, although his other two brothers, George and Dimitris also played an active role in the company.

The company was formally established in 1873, as advertised on all its products. In 1897 the brothers constructed a purpose-built factory in the Cairo district of Tewfikieh and they employed over 500 workers to manufacture hand-made cigarettes. The company expanded due to a successful advertising campaign and their brands became known across Europe and the Middle East.

They had an outlet at 20 Cheapside, London, as well as agents in Austria, Hungary, and Switzerland. By 1901, Kyriazi Freres was exporting over 103 million cigarettes a year. Some years later the sons of Ioannis (Damianos and Constantinos b.1891-d.1962) opened custom-built factories in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1922), and in Hamburg, Germany (1925).

Their most well-known brands were Aris, Astra, Conqueror Extra, Egyptian, Emir, Ferik, Finas, Ideal, Imperatore, Neptune, Special, and Zenith. These brands were awarded several quality awards at exhibitions and trade fairs.
