        "text": "Response to reply letter\n\n15 December 2023\n\nDear Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Defence and Attorney General\n\nWe sent you an Open Letter on 8 November 2023, signed by over 1,400 Australian lawyers (https://lawyersletter.au). The letter called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to escalating violence in the West Bank. We explained the relevant laws and how they applied to the facts reported by independent organisations, including the United Nations. We concluded that the violence had gone beyond what was permissible under international law and that there was evidence of atrocity crimes.\n\nA reply was published on 3 December 2023, which we believe was also sent to you (https://www.lawyersreply.au). The reply included flawed legal arguments that do not reflect the majority legal opinion. The argument rejected the facts reported by independent international organisations and called into question their credibility. We are disappointed that Australian lawyers would sign such a letter. We have attached our response to the 3 December 2023 letter of reply.\n\nWe request that the Australian Government provide the legal advice it has received regarding the conduct of the actors in this conflict and explain how it is meeting its legal obligations.\n\nWe have not received a response to the original Open Letter from any of your offices other than an acknowledgement of receipt.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSimon Miller, Lizzie O’Shea, Greg Barns SC, Benedict Coyne, Dr Rachel Coghlan, Rawan Arraf, Rita Jabri Markwell, Dr Melanie O’Brien\n\nResponse to Reply Letter\n\n“Sadly, I feel compelled to state that Palestinian lives are not worth less than British, Australian or Israeli. Yes, this is war and people die in war, but even wars have laws. They are essential to minimise human suffering. What we are witnessing is an Israeli military operation that is clearly getting the proportionality calculation wrong,”\n\nHector Sharp, a lawyer in Gaza employed by the United Nations and signatory of the Open Letter\n\nIn one of the largest shows of solidarity by the Australian legal profession, nearly 1,400 Australian lawyers signed an open letter (Open Letter) in early November calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to escalating violence in the West Bank.\n\nThe Open Letter sets out the relevant law and then applies that law to the facts as reported by UN agencies and other independent bodies. It concluded that the well-accepted limits of international law, human rights law and the law of armed conflict had been exceeded, and that there was mounting evidence that atrocity crimes had been committed.\n\nA letter of reply was published in Australia on 3 December 2023 (Reply Letter). The Reply Letter includes a combination of novel and fundamentally flawed legal arguments to claim a proportionate response on the part of the State of Israel. This reasoning is in stark contrast to the preponderance of legal opinion globally from experts in the field. The Reply Letter’s analysis rests on a rejection of the facts as reported and observed by international organisations on the ground and as seen in news reports and on video feeds before our eyes.\n\nThe President of the International Committee of the Red Cross – the independent body charged with stewardship for international humanitarian law – stated, “The level of human suffering is intolerable. It is unacceptable that civilians have no safe place to go in Gaza, and with a military siege in place, there is also no adequate humanitarian response currently possible.”\n\nOn 6 December, the UN’s Emergency Relief Coordinator described the Israeli military operation as creating an “apocalyptic” situation in Gaza. The Director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza, Thomas White, tweeted last Friday: “Civil order is breaking down in Gaza – the streets feel wild, particularly after dark – some aid convoys are being looted and UN vehicles stoned. Society is on the brink of full-blown collapse.”\n\nThe independent UN Special Procedures experts have warned that “the failure to urgently implement a ceasefire risks this situation spiralling towards a genocide conducted with 21st century means and methods of warfare.”\n\nBy contrast, the signatories to the Reply Letter offer that “such suffering is a regrettable but unavoidable consequence of an armed conflict”. To suggest that what has been and is being inflicted upon the civilian population has been “unavoidable” is extraordinary.\n\nThe Financial Times has reported that the level of damage from the bombing of northern Gaza surpasses the bombing of Dresden in World War II, which is often used as a benchmark for massive urban destruction. The bombing of Dresden took place prior to the adoption of the Fourth Geneva Convention in 1949 which stipulates that warring parties have an obligation to protect civilians, however it is often cited as one of the examples of the horrors from World War II, which inspired the drafting of the Fourth Geneva Convention in response.\n\nWithin one month after 7 October the Israeli military had already dropped the equivalent level of explosives of two nuclear bombs on the Gaza Strip. Israeli news agency Haaretz has published an analysis that describes “unprecedented killing” by Israeli forces in Gaza, with the ratio of civilians killed significantly higher than the average civilian toll in all the conflicts around the world during the 20th century. The Israeli military has killed more children in just two months than all conflicts combined in the world for the entire year of 2022. It is difficult to accept that such a high number of casualties was “unavoidable” by one of the world’s most advanced and well-equipped military forces, especially when investigative journalism shows their military was aware of children’s presence in targets before launching and that alleged precautions to protect civilians are not being taken.\n\nNot even the US – which acts as the Israel government’s persistent shield from accountability for transgressions of international law – can stretch this far. The US Vice President, Kamala Harris, has stated that “too many innocent Palestinians have been killed” and the US Secretary of State on 8 December stated that “almost a week into this campaign in the south after the end of the humanitarian pause, it is imperative that Israel put a premium on civilian protection, and there does remain a gap between the intent to protect civilians, and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground.”\n\nThe Reply Letter seeks to excuse civilian suffering in pursuit of military tactics and strategy. Military strategy does not sit above Israel’s legal obligations, including adherence to the Geneva Conventions.\n\nHowever, multiple widely-publicised comments by Israeli officials and politicians make plain that the military operation in Gaza is being undertaken with what could be described as, at best, a reckless disregard for international law and, at worst, genocidal intent. This includes statements by the Israeli President, Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.\n\nOn 7 October 2023, in a televised address, Mr Netanyahu said, “We will take mighty vengeance for this black day. We will take revenge for all the young people who lost their lives. We will target all of Hamas’s positions. We will turn Gaza into a deserted island. To the citizens of Gaza, I say. You must leave now. We will target each and every corner of the strip.”\n\nOn 8 October 2023, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said, “The price the Gaza Strip will pay will be a very heavy one that will change reality for generations.”\n\nThe same day, Ariel Kallner, a member of the Israeli parliament for Prime Minister Netanyahu’s Likud party, demanded a repeat of the mass expulsion and murder of Arabs in 1948, known to Palestinians as the Nakba or Catastrophe. “Right now, one goal: Nakba! A Nakba that will overshadow the Nakba of 1948,” he said.\n\nOn 9 October 2023, Israel’s Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, ordered a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip with “no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.” He said: “We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.” The same evinces an intent to ‘deliberately inflict [on Palestinian residents of Gaza] conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part.’\n\nOn 9 October 2023, another ruling party member Tally Gotliv, posted, “It’s time to kiss doomsday. Shooting powerful missiles without limit. Not flattening a neighborhood. Crushing and flattening Gaza. Otherwise we did nothing.”\n\nOn 10 October 2023, Major General Ghassan Alian, Coordinator of the Government in the Territories (COGAT), proclaimed that “… the citizens of Gaza are celebrating. Human beasts are dealt with accordingly… Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza, no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell.”\n\nOn the same day, IDF spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari said “hundreds of tons of bombs” had already been dropped on the tiny strip, adding that “the emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy.”\n\nOn 11 October 2023, Major General Giora Eiland told Israeli media, “Creating a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a necessary means to achieve the goal [of eliminating Hamas and their support base]. Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist.”\n\nOn 13 October 2023, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said: “It is an entire nation out there that is responsible. It’s not true, this rhetoric about civilians [being] not aware, not involved. It’s absolutely not true. They could have risen up. They could have fought against that evil regime which took over Gaza in a coup d’etat.”\n\nThis evidence has implications for the Australian Government. Dr Melanie O’Brien, President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars and signatory to the Open Letter, has stated: “Treaty obligations such as those under the Genocide Convention mean that Australia must act to prevent and punish genocide.” It is not enough for Australia to sit by and watch events unfold in Gaza while not taking all means available to it to discourage such action. The Australian Government is on further notice of its obligation under the Genocide Convention, the ICC Statute and the UN Charter as well a numerous other conventions.\n\nThat Gaza remains under Israeli occupation is the position of the: International Court of Justice; International Criminal Court; UN General Assembly and Security Council; all UN bodies and agencies; and even the Australian Government. The Reply Letter’s position that Gaza is not occupied is deliberate obfuscation of actual legal fact. As the Occupying Power, Israel has an obligation to provide for the basic needs of the protected civilian populations in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and to facilitate humanitarian aid by third party actors.\n\nThe Reply Letter places a heavy emphasis on comments from politicians casting doubt about the accuracy of reporting of fatalities by the Gaza Ministry of Health. The Lancet has reported no evidence of any inflated mortality reporting. It pointedly warns that “public scepticism of the current reports by the Gaza Ministry of Health might undermine the efforts to reduce civilian harm and provide life-saving assistance.”\n\nUnlike signatories to the Reply Letter who dangerously and irresponsibly allege an ‘institutional bias’ on the part of the United Nations against Israel, we hold respect for the legitimacy and credibility of international humanitarian organisations and their representatives. The position put in the Reply Letter echoes the frankly preposterous statement by Prime Minister Netanyahu that investigations of war crimes by Israel are antisemitic. The claim that accountability mechanisms constitute anti-semitism undermines the fundamentals of universal application of human rights. The ICC has announced its intention to investigate possible war crimes committed in both Israel and Gaza, through its prosecutor. The International Court of Justice has also been requested to provide an advisory opinion about events in the region prior to October 7, specifically the ‘ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.’ Such initiatives are necessary and appropriate if international law is to have any meaning or weight.\n\nWe urge the Australian Government to reverse its previous position of opposing such ICC investigations into Israel and Hamas. Palestinian and Israeli victims groups have the right to justice, accountability and redress and the ICC provides one such avenue.\n\nA key objective of the original Open Letter was to make clear that a priority of the international humanitarian law framework is the protection of civilians, and this is not conditional or optional. The events of 7 October, which were heinous, do not excuse the scale of the destruction and Israel’s conduct since. The position put in the Open Letter is consistent with the statement from Philippe Lazzarini, Commissioner General of UNWRA: “Calling for an end to the decimation of Gaza and its people is not a denial of the atrocities of 7 October. It is the opposite. It is recognition of the equal rights of all people – recognition that is essential to the future of Palestinians and Israelis alike.” We concur with the sentiment expressed in the joint statement from leaders of the world’s largest humanitarian organisations that “the harrowing events unfolding before us are shaping a global narrative that, if unchanged, will reveal a legacy of indifference in the face of unspeakable suffering, bias in the application of the laws of conflict and impunity for actors that violate international humanitarian law.”\n\nWe do not resile from any statement of law or its application to the facts as published in the Open Letter. To our sadness, the further suffering and destruction since the publication of the Open Letter only serves to reinforce and strengthen the position at law.\n\nWe are pleased to see that Australia voted in favour of the recent resolution of the UN General Assembly calling for an immediate ceasefire. We support the comments made in a joint statement by leaders of Australia, New Zealand and Canada that:\n\nIsrael must respect international humanitarian law. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected. We are alarmed at the diminishing safe space for civilians in Gaza…\n\nWe remain deeply concerned by the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and ongoing risks to all Palestinian civilians…\n\nWe support Palestinians’ right to self-determination. We oppose the forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, the re-occupation of Gaza, any reduction in territory, and any use of siege or blockade. We reaffirm that settlements are illegal under international law. Settlements and settler violence are serious obstacles to a negotiated two-state solution.\n\nWe request that the Australian Government do all it can to advocate for the UN resolution to be operationalised with urgency and enact consequences where parties do not comply.\n\nWe request that the Australian Government publish the legal advice it has received with regard to the conduct of the actors in this conflict and outline the steps undertaken to meet its legal obligations.\n\nOriginal Open Letter\n\n8 November 2023\n\nDear Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Defence and Attorney General\n\nWe the undersigned, legal practitioners and legal academics, in Australia, dedicated to upholding the rule of law both domestically and internationally, call on the Australian Government to act without delay to fulfil its international legal obligations in relation to the ever-escalating and horrific conflict in the Middle East.\n\nThe death, trauma and other harm visited on individuals, families and whole communities in the last month has been devastating. The well-accepted limits of international law, human rights law, and the law of armed conflict have been exceeded. There is mounting evidence that atrocity crimes have been committed.\n\nAtrocity crimes are considered to be the most serious crimes against humankind. Their status as international crimes is based on the belief that the acts associated with them affect the core dignity of human beings.\n\nInternational law is not being upheld.\n\nWe call on the Australian Government to uphold international law by:\n\nExerting its influence to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and the West Bank, and to ensure urgently the adequate provision of food, fuel, medicine and other humanitarian assistance to Gaza, and the unconditional restoration of water and electricity;\n\nActing urgently to ensure that international law is complied with and fundamental human rights are protected;\n\nAdvocating for an end to the occupation of Palestine and a just peace for all people in the region based on equal rights; and\n\nHalting defence exports to Israel, confirming what military-specific goods have been provided with the 322 export permits granted between 1 January 2017 and 31 March 2023 and whether these defence goods are being used in accordance with international law.\n\nTo add your name, please fill out this form: https://forms.gle/upM6FFsthZWSapVE8\n\n*The views and opinions expressed in this letter are those of the signatories and are not intended to reflect the official policy or position of their employers, or the organisations of which they are members or otherwise represent.\n\n**This letter remains open for signature by lawyers and legal academics in Australia.\n\n***The signatories are grateful for the assistance of the drafters of the UK letter in preparing this correspondence.\n\nAll facts and figures were correct as at the date of drafting (3 November 2023).\n\nNames are alphabetised to 1000, after which, listed in order of signing.\n\nSignatories:"
