        "text": "NICOLE NACCARATO\n\nMaster of Business Administration & Master of Public Health Co-op\n\nCo-op Student of the Year Award – Graduate\n\nEWO Co-op Student of the Year Award\n\nNicole completed her Spring 2023 work-term alongside the President and CEO of Grand River Hospital (GRH). In her short time at GRH, she not only shattered expectations but made substantial contributions to projects across multiple areas of administration including finance, operations, business development, nursing, and the KW4 Ontario Health Team. Some of her proudest accomplishments include: presenting her work and recommendations on the future strategic directions of world-class hospitals to the senior leadership team; meeting the Ontario Minister of Health; contributing to the development of a new neurosurgery program, having worked as a neurosurgery nurse herself; and her well-received community engagement strategies for the inaugural KW4 OHT Strategic Plan. She is looking forward to returning to GRH this fall to continue her work with the KW4 OHT. Nicole is a dedicated member of her community, relying on her creativity and talents to make a positive impact on the lives of others.\n\nBrock News – Excellence in co-op and experiential education to be showcased online\n\nTRENTON CAMPBELL\n\nHonours Bachelor of Business Administration Co-op\n\nUpon completing his co-op with Hydro One Trent is grateful to announce some of the many accomplishments that he has made. With a return to office initiative in 2022 he was able to take on the responsibility of facility coordinator for the office, while completing facility services for 200+ employees, and was given great exposure to other lines of business. Additionally, Trent had the opportunity to develop new financial tracking processes and forms that will continue to be used in the future at Hydro One, leaving behind a legacy. Doing this work was the key contributor in developing his technical skills with Excel, SAP and Power BI, expanding on his knowledge of formulas, charting and data analysis. Trent’s proudest accomplishment over the term was the role that he played in the success of a 4.5-million-dollar work program focusing on hydro pole maintenance and inspection.\n\nJustin Dilgert\n\nHonours Bachelor of Business Administration Co-op\n\nJustin completed four Co-op work terms with three different organizations successfully through his entire degree at Brock University. Though each experience was very different, Justin developed important skills and lessons from each role. Participating in the Co-op program allowed him to narrow down his interests and helped him find an employer in his third Co-op work term that he hopes to work with post-graduation. Co-op also helped him develop as a person to become more confident in himself. By being placed in new situations with little knowledge, he learned how to stand out and make lasting impressions. On top of these career and personal developments, Justin was able to focus on academic classes that were relevant to his career path post-graduation to help assist and supplement skills needed or learned on the job. Being supported by the Co-op department allowed him to have the skills and knowledge to take advantage of all the opportunities that came his way.\n\nJoel Gritter\n\nBrock University Co-op Student of the Year – Undergraduate 2020\n\nBSc Computer Science Honours Co-op with a Minor in Business\n\n“The co-op program has allowed meto develop myself as a person and build a professional network to set me up for success in the workforce.
