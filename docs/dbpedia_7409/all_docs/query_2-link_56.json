        "text": "Tarcisio Celestino was previously ITA President (2016-19) and President of the Brazilian Tunnelling Committee. He was the Animateur of the ITA Working Group 12 on Sprayed Concrete Use (2005-10). He earned his doctorate degree in Civil Engineering (Rock Mechanics) from the University of California, Berkeley (1981).\n\nHe is currently Professor at the University of Sao Paulo and employed by Themag Engenharia Ltda., Sao Paulo (Brazil), where he leads the Geotechnical Engineering, Engineering Geology &Transportation Engineering Design Groups. He is also responsible for the geotechnical designs of several hydroelectric power plants, subways, highways etc., including major underground works (since 1990). He has also acted as consultant.\n\nProfessor Celestino continues to contribute his knowledge for the graduate courses & research areas on Rock Mechanics & Underground Works, at the São Carlos Engineering School, University of São Paulo and for the ITACET Foundation.\n\nOur destination is the exploitation galleys of one of the largest underground mines of Attica. The chambers of metal extraction, rich in recognisable minerals, combine the mystery of ancient drifts with the beauty of caves. We will wander underground for up to 3 hours and explore the maize of drifts, the chambers supported by natural as well as carved-out pillars and the stalactites decoration reminiscent of natural caves. Each of the routes we follow hides surprises waiting to be discovered!\n\nAfter we will visit the great “Chaos” sinkhole, a heart-shaped sinkhole formation 150m in diameter and 55m deep. This chiasm may have been formed by the collapse of a cave roof as many of the area’s mining tunnels end there.\n\nScientific theme: Underground mining activity in Lavrio\n\nDuration: 6 hours inclusive\n\nDetailed program\n\n9.30-10.30 Athens-Lavrio\n\n10.30-13.30 Underground mines\n\n14.00-14.30 Stop at dolin “Chaos” and return to Athens\n\n14.30 – 15.30 Lavrio-Athens\n\nCost per person: 40,00 €\n\n*limited participation on a first come first served basis. In case participants are less than 20, the respective event will be cancelled and a refund wil be given.\n\nHow many surprises can the Athens underground have in store for its visitors? The stroll will start from underground shelters and detention areas of the German Kommandatur, remnants of the 2nd World War in Athens. Then, we will take the steps that start off under a timeworn trap door on the side of a road or hidden away in a sidewalk flower–bed, that will lead us in a different, forgotten underground area of the city! For hundreds of years, underground pathways have been used for various and mysterious purposes. Some say that all underground pathways are interconnected although there is no proof of this. Nevertheless, the allure of an unknown world is always there, beneath the ground we walk on. We lift up the antiquated hatch and descend the stone steps. In the catacomb, we come across tunnels of ancient aqueducts, roman baths and byzantine crypts. The Athens river is also found hidden below the ground, running in old galleys under the most central streets of Athens – we can hear the cars passing over our heads!\n\nWe invite you to discover together the hidden secrets of our city!\n\nScientific theme: underground constructions of the 19th and 20th century.\n\nDuration: Maximum of 4 hours.\n\nDetailed program:\n\n11.00 Meeting outside Metro Station Panepistimio\n\n11.30 Memorial Site (Korai Street). Two-level underground shelter below the Mansion of Ethniki Insurance Company.\n\n13.00 Catacombs of the Russian Church (Filellinon Street). Inside the catacombs a tunnel and a shaft from ancient Peisistratus aqueduct, ruins from roman baths and crypts of the Byzantine order of Likodimos -11th century.\n\n14.00 Ilissos River (area of Panathenaic Stadium). The buried riverbed of Athens river Ilissos.\n\nCost per person : 35,00 €\n\n*limited participation on a first come first served basis. In case participants are less than 20, the respective event will be cancelled and a refund wil be given.\n\nProfessor Kyriazis Pitilakis has more than forty years of intensive academic, research and professional experience in civil, earthquake and geotechnical engineering.
