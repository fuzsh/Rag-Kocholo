        "text": "He just can’t help but catch the hearts and minds of the sport watching public, can he?\n\nIn the face of (understandable) concern from Milwaukee Bucks fans about his participation in Olympic qualifiers for the Greek National Team, Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Greeks found a way to punch their tickets. To suit up and risk your health for your nation in what might be an also-ran competition is one thing. To do so and to find a way to get your national team back into the Olympics for the first time in 16 years — and the first time in Giannis’s career — is another.\n\nAnd, of course, once the whistle blows we get more visceral evidence of just how much all of this means to Giannis. Beneath the often brash and goofy exterior there lurks a very sensitive and loyal individual. We’ve gotten familiar with his softer side often during his time as a Buck between miraculously winning a title for the city, accepting his first MVP award, and also in defeat. There have been fewer opportunities for him to feel that same vindication on the international stage, though, so Sunday’s emotional outpouring was the first we’ve seen how meaningful success both with the Bucks and with Greece is to him.\n\nBoth halves of his playing identity mirror one another. They’re both rarely labeled out-and-out favorites to win it all in every competition they enter. He’s at the center of the roster, but the build and play around him is just as, if not more important, than the raw stats he can produce. Importantly, he quite genuinely feels that both places are home for him.\n\nGreece has a long way to go and a group of death to navigate in Paris, but when the Greek contingent arrives for the opening ceremony, Milwaukee, Wisconsin will have its heart and soul at the very front. Congratulations to him, to Greece, and our Greek compatriots here at the site. We’ll be pulling for you later this summer!\n\nLet’s roundup!\n\nMilwaukee Bucks Links\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo named TISSOT MVP at FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament 2024 Greece (FIBA.com)\n\nThe most encouraging part of Giannis’s performances from a Bucks fan’s POV: He’s doing a little bit of everything without overexerting himself. That and playing with a decent level of control to avoid the traps of yesteryear where his tendencies can be played on by opposing coaches and teams. No such thing as bad reps in other playing systems, in my opinion.\n\nDon’t sleep on the Bucks, folks (USA Today)\n\nI agree, but I also don’t fault national or even social media for overlooking a team whose first season with Damian Lillard was a letdown, to put it mildly. The additions of Delon Wright and Taurean Prince are very interesting in terms of better possible fit next to Dame (Wright) and small ball groupings (Prince). If the team stands pat from here on out, though, they’ll be firmly in “prove it” territory before anyone puts the shine back on them.\n\nGiannis seeks ‘something special’ with Greece in the Olympic Games (Eurohoops)\n\nCouple of extra quotes from Giannis here in the wake of the victory over Croatia. As far as naming former players as head coaches go — especially when they’re still relatively young as Vassilis Spanoulis who is just 41 — Greece seems to have hit on something. This roster had done okay in previous international competition, but put it together with a largely unchanged group to get to Paris. Impressive.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo Is the Only Person on Earth With This Outrageously Sick Watch (GQ)\n\n1) MOAR WATCH CONTENT\n\n2) The green is all sorts of wrong as far as referencing the Bucks goes. I think a proper hunter green would’ve been a tough match with that rose gold, but still\n\n3) With all due respect, the watch is expensive, not “outrageously sick”\n\nMilwaukee Bucks win the race to sign Nigeria’s Devine Eke for NBA Summer League (ESPN)\n\nI’ll be putting together a piece this week that tries to round up at least a little footage and background info on all the Bucks Summer League invites. Congrats to Eke for his success in the BAL and I look forward to watching him play in Vegas later this week!\n\nThe Social Media Section\n\nUh, same to you guys and whoever else was asking for this\n\nYoung Antetokounmpo’s Vans game on point already. Respect\n\nConsider me subscribed\n\nActual photographic proof that Dame is bothering to work out this summer. That’s awesome\n\nI’ll take 10 even though I’m sure the price is “outrageously sick”\n\nGo all out, just this once, AJ\n\nReferencing yourself in the third person (by your initials) is a choice\n\nArt\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks (in some form) are back this week as the team hits the road to Las Vegas and Summer League! Things begin in Vegas on Friday, but Milwaukee will take the floor for the first time on Saturday against the Chicago Bulls. Following that, they’ll play on Sunday against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Both games look like they’ll be on NBATV, maybe YouTube, and definitely Bally Sports WI.\n\nOnce we know more about the coaching staff that is going with and the full roster, we’ll get some pieces up to provide further coverage. What matters most is that our long basketball drought is coming to an end. Rejoice!\n\nHappy Monday!"
