The transaction involves Beltone acquiring 5,000 shares at EGP 1,000 each, along with an additional payment of EGP 1 million, bringing the total transaction value to EGP 6 million. This acquisition will enable Beltone to securitize the portfolios of its growing number of non-banking financial services firms more easily. It also opens up new business opportunities for Beltone to lead transactions for third parties. Acquiring an already-licensed securitization company offers Beltone a quicker route to market, bypassing the need to establish a new firm and apply for a license from the FRA. Mostafa Al Azab, Beltoneâ€™s Chief Legal Officer, and Marwa El Khodary, SODICâ€™s General Counsel, are expected to have significant roles in this transition.

All of the issues are in its agency and advisory business, it said, where the number of transactions brokered has slowed. Dan Prickett, chief executive, said the loss for the half year to end June of Â£1.86 million (Â£1.73 million profit) was a \"disappointing\" performance but aside from the transactions arm other parts of the business performed encouragingly. Deal levels have also picked up recently, he said, but the outcome for the year will depend on how many of these complete in the next four months. #Shares fell 12.5p to 97.5p.

As such it is important that changes are made to the rules to complement the IRDA and to support the restructuring of listed companies as well as Singaporeâ€™s efforts to be a restructuring hub. To this end, the Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) has recently issued its consultation paper to seek market feedback for its proposals to enhance the corporate restructuring and trading resumption framework under the SGX-ST Listing Manual. This article examines the key amendments and provides some practical insights.

It allows for an orderly realisation of the companyâ€™s assets, investigations into the companyâ€™s failure and distribution of the companyâ€™s assets amongst Creditors. Once the Liquidation has commenced, the Liquidator takes control of the companyâ€™s assets and affairs and is the only one with the power to bind the company. In general, the Liquidator will: ðŸ”· Identify, secure and realise the companyâ€™s assets ðŸ”· Investigate the failure of the company ðŸ”· Identify any voidable transactions ðŸ”· Report to creditors and hold meetings ðŸ”· Report to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on any offences committed by company officers ðŸ”· Distribute any company assets to Creditors ðŸ”· Apply to ASIC to deregister the company For more information visit svpartners.com.au or call us today on 1800 246 801 #svpartners #insolvency #court #liquidation"
