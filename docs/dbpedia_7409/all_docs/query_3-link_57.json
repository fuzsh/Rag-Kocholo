        "text": "Heterodox Economics Newsletter\n\nIssue 252 web pdf Heterodox Economics Directory\n\nLast week I visited the Warsaw School of Economics in Poland at the occasion of the annual conference of the European Association of Evolutionary Political Economy (EAEPE). This was fascinating for at least three reasons: First, the Warsaw School of Economics is a truly historical place, which hosted intellectual giants of heterodox economics such as Michael Kalecki, Oskar Lange or Kasimir Laski in the past, and tries to keep this heritage visible and alive till today. Second, EAEPE is presumably the largest and most diverse heterodox association in Europe and features a strongly pluralist and interdisciplinary agenda, which is, as you might guess, much to my liking. As a regular participant of EAEPE conferences I have recognized that the quality of contributions increases every year and so I had the opportunity to listen to a series of interesting and engaging talks (you can have a glimpse at the program here). By the way, all non-European readers should notice that EAEPE's annual conference is open for submissions from all over the world and not restricted in any way to European residents. Finally, I was extremely honored to give a lecture on Philosophy and Economics during the pre-conference workshop, which proved to me an extremely motivating experience (in case you are interested, what I told them, you can obtain the outline of my workshop as well as my slides from the Newsletter's website. However, it is probably even better to inspect Claudius GrÃ¤bner's pre-conference material on the Economic Complexity Index, which has been extremely well received by the students...).\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the next question on my mind is, whether the enthusiasm instilled by visiting the EAEPE conference will survive my next conference trip, which is leading me to Leipzig, where the annual meeting of the German Economic Association is taking place. Hm. Last time I had been there, it proved helpful not to speak about heterodoxy or criticizing econ textbooks as this quickly led other participants to minimize the time spent with me. However, I did not recognize this straight from the beginning and at day three I felt a little isolated - just as if I would have had no shower over the course of the past week ;-)\n\nBut let's wait, see and hope. Maybe my fellow German colleagues follow the example of Larry Summers, who recently admitted on Twitter that effective demand matters and, most probably, Post-Keynesians have been right on this all along. That's indeed courageous and I hope some of this intellectual openness and courage will trickle down to the debate on economic policy in Germany.\n\nAll the best,\n\nJakob\n\nPS: Be sure to inspect this Newsletter's podcast section, which contains quite cool stuff (submissions for this are always welcome, btw).\n\nPPS: I mentioned the probably less well-known Kasimir Laski above in conjunction with Kalecki and Lange not only because he was a great economist, but also because he proved to be very important for my own biography. He was a Professor emeritus at the Johannes Kepler University Linz, where I did my undergraduate studies. Back then, the study program was 97% mainstream and I met Kaszik - as his friends would call him - in the course of a dinner organized by the Econ department, which I joined more or less accidentally. During this dinner he explained to me forcefully the central tenets of Post-Keynesian economics - something I never had heard before, but which made a lot of sense to me intuitively. Retrospectively, I think this was one of the major events that motivated me to go beyond criticizing the standard textbook approach and to try to excavate and study theoretical alternatives to the mainstream. Regrettably, Kaszik has left us about four years ago at the age of 93.\n\nÂ© public domain\n\nTable of contents\n\nCall for Papers\n\n13th HISRECO Conference (Lausanne, March 2020)38th International Labour Process Conference on âCritical Differences at Workâ (Newcastle, April 2020)46th Eastern Economics Association Annual Conference (Boston, Feb. 2020)84th Annual Conference of the Japanese Society for the History of Economic Thought (Sapporo, May 2020) Business Ethics Quarterly: Special Issue on \"The Challenges and Prospects of Deliberative Democracy for Corporate Sustainability and Responsibility\"Cambridge Journal of Economics 2020 Conference (Cambridge, Sep. 2020)Development Days 2020: \"Financialisation and Inequalities: Housing in the Global South\" (Helsinki, Feb. 2020)Journal of Institutional Economics: Special Issue on: âInstitutions and Culture in Economic ContextsâMinsky at 100: Revisiting Financial Instability (Milan, Dec. 2019) Papers in Political Economy: Special Issue on \"Economics and the environment since the 1950s\" Research in Political Economy: Special Issue on âCapital Accumulation and the Commodification of AnimalsâThe Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics: Special Issue on \"Austrian Entrepreneurship Theory\"Workshop on \"Teaching Ethics To Economists: Challenges And Benefits\" (London, March 2020)Workshop on \"The Role of Economic Experts in Crisis-Prone Societies\" (Naples, April 2020)\n\nCall for Participants\n\nWorkshop on \"Economic Development and Income Distribution in Small Open Economies\" (Rome, Dec. 2019)Forum for Institutional Thought: \"Institutions and Survival: Social Order for the 21st Century\" (KrakÃ³w, Feb 2020)\n\nConference Papers, Reports, and Podcasts\n\nSchool of Political EconomyUniversal Basic Income in Alaska: A podcast story\n\nJob Postings\n\nYork University, CanadaHobart and William Smith Colleges, USThe European Trade Union Institute, BelgiumThe Open University, UKUniversity of Helsinki, FinlandUniversity of Massachusetts Boston, US\n\nJournals\n\nCapital & Class, 43 (3)Capitalism Nature Socialism, 30 (3)Competition & Change 23 (5)Ecological Economics, 166Forum for Social Economics 48 (4)Industrial and Corporate Change 28 (5)Journal of Agrarian Change, 19 (4)Journal of Institutional Economics, 15 (5)New Political Economy, 24 (6)Problemas del Desarrollo 50 (198) Review of International Political Economy, 26 (5)Science & Society, 83 (4)\n\nBooks and Book Series\n\nClass History and Class Practices in the Periphery of CapitalismLeft Radicalism and Populism in EuropePaper Dragons: China and the Next CrashThe Power of Standards: Hybrid Authority and the Globalisation of ServicesThe Responsibility of Intellectuals: Reflections by Noam Chomsky and others after 50 years The State of the European Union: Fault Lines in European IntegrationThe Unknowers: How Strategic Ignorance Rules the WorldThreatening Property: Race, Class, and Campaigns to Legislate Jim Crow Neighborhoods\n\nHeterodox Graduate Programs, Scholarships and Grants\n\nInternational Doctoral School in \"Law, Ethics and Economics for Sustainable Development\"\n\nCall for Papers\n\n13th HISRECO Conference (Lausanne, March 2020)\n\n20-21 March, 2020 | Lausanne, Swiss\n\nThe thirteenth History of Recent Economics Conference (HISRECO) will be held at the University of Lausanne, Centre Walras Pareto, on March 20-21, 2020. Since 2007, HISRECO has brought together researchers from various backgrounds to study the history of economics in the postwar period. The increasing availability of archival materials, along with the development of new perspectives inherited from the larger history and sociology of knowledge, has helped to provide insightful histories of the development of recent economic practices, ideas, and techniques. In particular, this area of research offers good opportunities to young scholars who are interested in interdisciplinary approaches to the history of economics.\n\nWe invite researchers in the history of postwar economics and related fields to submit a paper proposal of no more than 800 words. Paper proposals that use approaches from the history and sociology of science, or cultural and science studies will be particularly appreciated. Successful applicants will be informed by October 25 1, 2019.\n\nWe aim to provide financial support to selected participants, but as yet cannot make any firm commitments on this. Preference will be given to young scholars. Scholars who are interested in such funding should include in their proposal a CV of no more than two pages, including current affiliation and year of thesis defense (if applicable) and a list of publications.\n\nFor those who want to know more about HISRECO, a list of past conferences and contributors can be found at http://www.hisreco.org.\n\nProposals should be sent electronically (as a pdf file) to FranÃ§ois Allisson.\n\nSubmission Deadline: 11 October 2019\n\n38th International Labour Process Conference on âCritical Differences at Workâ (Newcastle, April 2020)\n\n15-17 April 2020 | Newcastle, UK\n\nEach year the ILPC brings together researchers from a variety of countries with the objective of enhancing our understanding of contemporary developments relating to work and employment within the broader political economy. The conference organisers welcome papers on any issue concerning the analysis of labour processes, labour markets, labour organising and labour reproduction. As ever, we always encourage papers that seek to develop inter-disciplinary linkages through their empirical, conceptual or theoretical content.\n\nIndicative traditional and recent topics include:\n\nLabour process theory and other critical perspectives of work relations\n\nLabour agency and changing forms of resistance; Industrial relations, representation and trade union strategies\n\nNew forms of workforce flexibility, insecurity and intensification\n\nInequality at work: gender, ethnicity, and class\n\nChanging skills, knowledge and occupations\n\nThe politics of production, productivity and performance management\n\nStructural imbalances in the global economy and the consequences for labour\n\nWork and Employment in the Global South\n\nGlobal value chains and âdimensionsâ of labour (e.g. unfree/forced labour, informal work)\n\nFinance capital and âfinancialisationâ\n\nForms of employment and cleavages and solidarities between groups of workers\n\nAusterity, welfare regimes and the workplace,\n\nMigrant labour, labour markets and the organization of production\n\nProductive and reproductive labour in the global economy\n\nTechnology, ârobotisationâ, artificial intelligence and the digital economy\n\nTime, space, place and the labour process\n\nAs we welcome your contributions within these broad areas, we also invite you to reflect on the conference theme - âcritical divisions at workâ - which will inform key elements of the conference programme. With increasingly polarised labour markets, it becomes ever more important for critical scholars to explore divisions that have become heightened in recent years. This includes critical divisions that lead to work-related inequality between individuals on the basis of class, gender, ethnicity, age, sexuality and other dimensions. It also includes the division between the mainstream managerial perspectives that advocate the possibility of good working conditions, and the reality of an increasingly precarious and insecure labour market. It includes critical divisions that emerging and are reproduced in relation to skills, production, financialisation, migration, geographical location and technology. Finally, we are interested in responses and resistance to divisions at work, both in terms of practical action in the workplace and industrial relations and from diverse types of critical theories.\n\nSpecial Streams\n\nWhilst most of the papers for the conference are submitted to the General Stream, ILPC also runs special streams. These streams are intended to expand our community of scholars and stimulate debate in new areas relevant to analysis of labour processes, labour markets, labour organising and labour reproduction.\n\nThe 2020 conference will run the following special streams:\n\nGender, diversity and precarity\n\nValue and the labour process â revisited\n\nYounger and older workers in the contemporary labour market\n\nAbstract Information\n\nAll abstracts are externally reviewed. Papers must not have been previously published or presented elsewhere. The abstract should contain clear information about the topic, how it is being investigated and the intended contribution to knowledge. Abstracts relating to new empirical research should contain information about theoretical orientation, findings, methodology and the stage of the research (if appropriate). Abstracts of papers that are concerned solely with theoretical or conceptual matters should provide clear information on how they address and advance relevant debates. Abstracts should be between 350-500 words. Key words should be given that indicate the focus of research and the methods used. The conference is also open to a small number of proposals for symposia. These differ from standard paper sessions in that they focus on s single theme and roundtable discussion. Abstracts should be submitted in the normal way, but should specify topic, rationale and contributing speakers.\n\nFind further information here.\n\nSubmission Deadline: 31 October 2019\n\n46th Eastern Economics Association Annual Conference (Boston, Feb. 2020)\n\n27 February - 1 March 2020 | Boston, USA\n\nURPE members are invited to submit entire organized sessions or individual papers to URPE for our participation in this year's 46 Eastern Economics Association Annual Conference to be held in Boston, February 27 - March 1, 2020. In its fourteenth year, URPE @ EEA is continuing to provide a forum for URPE members and economists across the heterodox spectrum to meet and engage each other, and continue to develop the frontiers of radical economic theory. Submissions for panels or individual papers need be made through the URPE Web site, under âURPE at the Easterns, Call for Papers,â which is under CONFERENCES & EVENTS at www.urpe.org. The electronic forms for making submissions will be active as of October 8, 2019. Please make all inquiries about submissions to Al Campbell at al@economics.utah.edu or Scott Carter at scott-carter@utulsa.edu.\n\nRules and Notes for submissions to URPE @ EEA:\n\nAll presenters must be dues-paying URPE members by the time of the deadline (November 15, 2019). Please email urpe@urpe.org if you have questions about membership.\n\nURPE membership is not a requirement for discussants but is strongly encouraged because of our good working relation with the EEA.\n\nFor a proposal to be considered for acceptance it must clearly indicate the full names, email addresses, and institutional affiliations of the participants (including the discussants). The titles of the papers, detailed abstracts, and -- if available -- working drafts and/or completed papers, as well as suggested names for the sessions (in the case of complete panel proposals) must also be submitted. All this is indicated on the Electronic Proposal Form.\n\nSubmit your proposal for participation in the URPE at EEA panels for a paper or panel to the location on the URPE Web site indicated above. Do not submit a proposal for a paper to the EEA. If you do that then the paper will get double listed, on the URPE@EEA panels and on another panel designated by the EEA.\n\nRegister for attendance at the conference at the EEA Web site. This is the second step listed there for submitting a paper proposal (again, do not submit a paper proposal directly to the EEA), and one can go directly to this second step without submitting a paper proposal to the EEA. The direct address for registering (or getting EEA membership) is http://eeaorg.myshopify.com/collections/conference-registration-and-event-tickets.\n\nNote membership in the EEA is not necessary, but like many groups, they give a lower conference registration rate to members to motivate conference presenters to join the EEA. It cost $60 more to register if not a member, and $65 for the standard membership with journal delivered on-line and $70 for print journal delivery (and less for graduate students or retired people). URPE encourages participants to join the EEA. There has always in the past been a slightly reduced registration rate for URPE members offered as one of the registration options. Note in regards to saving money that while the registration rate is only marginally lower, by submitting your proposal to URPE for the URPE panels one saves the fee the EEA charges for submitting a paper, which is a separate charge from the registration fee (they waive this fee for us because we in URPE organize all our papers into panels and submit panels, saving them a lot of work). Of course the reason to submit to an URPE panel is not for the monetary savings, but rather to hopefully end up with the other papers on the panel being more similar in their approach to economics, and hence making for better interaction and feedback, but there is a slight monetary savings.\n\nNote the conference registration fee is lower if you register with the EEA for the conference by the âearly birdâ conference registration deadline of October 15, but one can register (again, at a higher rate) any time up to and including on arrival at the conference (onsite registration). Again, registering to attend (done to the EEA on their site) and submitting a proposal for a paper (done to URPE on the URPE Web site) are two separate actions.\n\nFind further information here.\n\nApplication Deadline: 15 November 2019\n\n84th Annual Conference of the Japanese Society for the History of Economic Thought (Sapporo, May 2020)\n\n30-31 May 2020 | Sapporo, Japan\n\nThe 84th Annual Conference of the Japanese Society for the History of Economic Thought (JSHET) will be held at Hokkaido University, Sapporo on May 30th and 31st, 2020.

However, the theoretical discussions remained limited to open up financialisation of housing in emerging economies, where the historical structure of housing provision and financialisation experienced differently. In the emerging economies, where there is an absence of welfare state housing provision, there is a significant number of self-help housing, which in some cases remain âinformalâ or under an ambiguous land/homeownership. While the empirical and theoretical research on the global south is a growing literature, there is still a need to make an analysis of the emerging economy countriesâ experiences of housing provision for different classes under a new set of financial tools.\n\nThis panel welcomes analysis of financialisation of housing in the Global South which discusses some potential venues theoretically and empirically:\n\naccess to affordable housing revisited under the expansion of securitisation and mortgage lending\n\nforms of displacement in different geographical contexts\n\nglobal real estate investment (residential and commercial) and its impacts on the urban fabric, including uneven development, gentrification and segregation\n\nmass housing and housing development as a part of financialisation of housing\n\nrevisiting the right to housing: the role of housing movements and struggles in the financialisation of housing process\n\nthe housing precariat, bankable slums\n\nthe role of the state in housing provision\n\nPlease find more Information here.\n\nIf you are interested in presenting a paper, please submit an abstract (max 150 words)by email to ozlem.celik@helsinki.fi\n\nSubmission Deadline: 14 September 2019\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics: Special Issue on: âInstitutions and Culture in Economic Contextsâ\n\nThis call aims to bring together papers to improve the theoretical, empirical and methodological understanding of the role of institutions and culture in different geopolitical and socio-economic contexts as well as the role of economics in different institutional and cultural contexts. Particularly, we focus on how institutions and cultural aspects may provide contributions towards better understanding of economic outcomes. Contributions which can derive from individuals and social attitudes towards rent-seeking behaviours, corruption, tax evasion, and institutional trust, among others. We are also interested in studies investigating how cultural traits and institutions relate to different forms of economic and institutional performance. Hence, we invite contributions addressing issues including but not limited to:\n\nLink between Culture, Formal and Informal Institutions\n\nSocial Norms, Trust, and Social Attitudes Towards Rent-Seeking Behaviours\n\nMeasures of Culture and Cultural Dimensions\n\nCulture, Corruption, Tax Evasion, and Tax Morale\n\nLegal Institutions, Cultural Traits, and Governance\n\nReligiosity, Cultural Differences, and Institutions\n\nCulture, Institutional Performance, and Institutional Trust\n\nCultural Differences, Social Capital, and Social Attitudes\n\nCulture and Economic and/or Organisational Performance\n\nAbstract Submission\n\nWe invite to submit an abstract of max 300 words by the 27 of January 2020 to luca.andriani@bbk.ac.uk.

Some economists had focused on these issues before, but it was not until then that the environment became an autonomous subject of economic study. During this period of strong demographic and economic growth in industrialized countries, this progressive recognition of environmental issues by economists was caused by natural resources depletion, ecosystems degradation, and pollution and its harmful effects, such as the first smog in Los Angeles or the chemical contamination of Minamata Bay.\n\nThis special issue is devoted to the contemporary history of environmental economic thought, and to the transition from the marginal specialization of a few pioneers to an established academic field. This new field has however branched into separate theoretical approaches: environmental economics, which partly grew out of the new welfare economics and distinguished itself from the economics of natural resources; and ecological economics which has been inspired by ecology while trying to develop new analytical tools. This evolution thus raises important issues from different perspectives: economic theory (e.g., the concepts and analytical frameworks used), philosophy (e.g., the status given to nature, the weight given to future generations) and policy (e.g., the way new environmental policies finally prevail).\n\nContributions to the special issue could focus on the following topics and questions:\n\nHow has environmental economics emerged since the 1950s as a field separate from natural resources economics? What has been the role of American economists, whether they were specialized in this field (Ayres, Kneese, DâArge) or not (Galbraith)? How has ecological economics been driven by both ecologists (Commoner, Odum) and economists (Fisher, Dasgupta, MÃ¤ler, Boulding, Georgescu-Roegen, Daly)? How have Marxist, post-Keynesian and institutional schools of economics addressed these issues?\n\nFrom a methodological point of view, how have these new issues been managed by existing theoretical frameworks? Environmental economics has adapted the neoclassical framework and concepts, notably those borrowed from the new welfare economics (market failure, externality, collective good, cost-benefit analysis, natural capital) to new environmental issues. By contrast, ecological economics has sought to find new analytical approaches while being at the same time affected by the same epistemological controversies that one can observe outside this field.\n\nFrom a policy point of view, how have these methodological propositions and different policy recommendations been institutionalized? When it was decided to design environmental policies, what were the policy demands addressed to economists? Inversely, by what means have recommendations by economists been treated by government or agencies? What has been, for example, the influence of institutions like Resources for the Future in the USA and the OECD, or different agencies whose role has been to manage environmental issues at a national level?\n\nWhat have been the philosophical issues in terms of intra- or intergenerational justice (for example concerning the choice of discount rates), or in terms of the commodification of nature and more widely its monetization (through the valuation of damages or more recently of ecosystem services, or through allowance or permit markets)?\n\nPapers, in French or English, that focus on these issues from a historical perspective, from the 1950s onwards, are welcome. The special issue will be published by the French journal Cahiers dâÃ©conomie politique / Papers in Political Economy (Hermann ed.) at the end of 2020.\n\nAnonymous papers (maximum 10,000 words) need to be sent to wscep2019@gmail.com, with name, institution, abstract (maximum 700 words) and three keywords on a separate page.\n\nSubmission Deadline: 1 November 2019\n\nResearch in Political Economy: Special Issue on âCapital Accumulation and the Commodification of Animalsâ\n\nAlthough vast amounts of scholarly writing have been produced concerning the dynamics of capitalism and environmental devastation, less attention has been paid to the depredation and exploitation of animals related to profit-making.\n\nIt is a truism to say that, capitalism commodifies anything it can in order to make a profit. That includes all aspects of nature and life (including human life). Non-human animals have been commodified in many ways including as livestock of various types (cows, pigs, chickens) on factory farms. Throughout the history of the spread of the world capitalist system, their exploitation and commodification has been intensified: some species have been hunted to extinction or near extinction for their fur (beaver, otter), for their ivory (elephants, rhinoceros), for their purported medicinal properties (pangolins). They have been used as work animals in a type of slave-like situation, including elephants in India, donkeys and horses throughout the world, camels in the Mid-East and dogs for pulling sleds. They are hunted as trophies and are part of the international trade in exotic animals, such as parrots, tigers, and bears. Although the exploitation of animals occurred in the ancient world, and most especially during the period of early states, the depredations accelerated after the beginning of what Jason W. Moore called the âCapitaloceneâ, i.e. since the 16h century, which Immanuel Wallerstein identified as the beginning of agrarian capitalism and the birth of the world capitalist system.\n\nThis special issue calls for papers that address one or more of the following topics:\n\n1. How hunters, in the interests of profit-making, decimated fur-bearing animals over historical time, both in Europe and in the Americas over historical time.\n\n2. How hunters, also in the interests of profit-making, have led to the extinction of certain species of rhinoceros and to the immense decline of other species of rhinoceros and elephants in Africa since at least colonial times.And how bison in North America were hunted to near extinction in order to deprive Native Americans of their livelihood and make it easier to separate them from the lands on which they lived.\n\n3. How trafficking in exotic animals (parrots, tigers, etc.) is related to the degradation of ecosystems and systematic cruelty toward living beings.\n\n4. How the cruelty on factory farms is based on the commodification of animals and a lack of sensitivity to their well-being.\n\n5. How mining and deforestation caused by factory farming has and is destroying the habitat for many non-human animals.\n\n6. How cruel experiments on animals feed into the profit-making of pharmaceutical and other corporations.\n\n7. How the animal entertainment industry, from circuses to sea worlds and beyond, produces mega-profits for various companies.\n\n8. How these phenomena are related to efforts at capital accumulation, and related as well to the dehumanization and commodification of everything.\n\nSubmissions of full manuscripts to either editor are double-blind, peer-reviewed, and can be made up to December 15, 2019.

Indeed, entrepreneurship theory attempts to understand the entrepreneurial opportunity, following the works by Venkataraman (1997), Shane and Venkataraman (2000), and Shane (2003). This so-called individual-opportunity nexus builds on the theories of Israel Kirzner (1973, 1997, 2009), an Austrian economist, and Joseph Schumpeter (1934, [1942] 1947), trained by prominent Austrian economists. It has generated a vast literature that is focused on discussing the nature of opportunities, whether they are discovered (as per Kirzner and Shane) or created through an enactment process (Alvarez & Barney, 2007). More recently, the âAustrianâ influence continues as one of the challengers to entrepreneurial opportunity theory is the so-called judgment-based approach (Foss & Klein, 2012; 2015; Foss, Klein & BjÃ¸rnskov, 2019; McMullen, 2015), inspired by Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises (1998) and âproto-Austrianâ Richard Cantillon ([1755] 1931). Without exaggerating, therefore, the Austrian school of economics has provided fertile theoretical ground to plant seeds for the burgeoning and growing field of entrepreneurship. Despite this common ground, Austrian economists have done little to learn from and integrate entrepreneurship scholarship, and entrepreneurship scholars have likewise refrained from considering the fuller Austrian theory as framework for their research. This special issue is intended to support further mutual learning and theory development, if not integration of theories, by facilitating scholarly discourse where Austrian economics and entrepreneurship theory intersect and overlap.\n\nBackground\n\nBoth the field of entrepreneurship and the Austrian school of economics are presently at âcritical juncturesâ. In entrepreneurship, after some three decades of theorizing on the entrepreneurial opportunity, scholars have started considering alternative approaches such as studying judgment through uncertain investments (Klein, 2008) and new venture ideas (Davidsson, 2015). At the same time, the influence of alternative theories such as effectuation theory (Sarasvathy, 2001) have been growing, leaving the field without an obvious way forward.\n\nSimilarly, Austrian economics has, after decades of decline and marginalization, regained some of its former influence and â following the financial crisis â its attractiveness among the public as well as scholars out of the economics mainstream. Yet for the school to again become a major influence in economics and beyond, it needs to meet the new challenges and questions with new theory development (e.g., Bylund, 2016). While overlapping with respect to both subject matter and theory, entrepreneurship scholars have been hesitant to enter Austrian discourse and Austrian economists have largely refrained from contributing to the entrepreneurship literature. There is much to gain from addressing this overlap: entrepreneurship theory could overcome many theoretical problems by considering Austrian economic theory for asking new questions, answering hitherto seemingly unanswerable questions, and solving disagreements and disputes regarding theoretical explanations; and Austrian economists could draw from the entrepreneurship literature to further strengthen and elaborate on the microfoundations for entrepreneurship and the market process. The timing is thus right for pursuing Austrian themes and further leveraging Austrian theory in entrepreneurship, and for extending and elaborating on Austrian entrepreneurship theory.\n\nSubmission Process and Deadlines\n\nPapers will be reviewed according to the QJAE double-blind review process.\n\nManuscripts should be submitted through the QJAE online submission process.

If Adam Smith has established the discipline of political economy as a moral science, the subsequent developments in economics such as the marginal revolution, the emergence of neoclassical economics, etc, have transformed the discipline into a neutral and non-values/non-judgements science. The debate on the role of ethics and morality in economics by economists such as James Buchanan or Amartya Sen has exerted notable influences in the direction of a change in economics. Amartya Sen, in On Ethics and Economics (1987: 7) stated that the ânature of modern economic theory has been substantially impoverished by the distance that has grown between economics and ethicsâ.\n\nDuring the last 30 years, the conversation between economic theory and philosophy and ethics has been restarted, after a period of interruption, generated by the positivist era in economics. We cannot ignore, in this revival, the role of the recent financial crisis that has brought an interest in economistsâ applied ethics. We would like to emphasize also the recent deontological calls for a professional economic ethics by DeMartino (2011) and DeMartino and McCloskey (2016) and their efforts to build a sub-discipline in economics such as Professional economics ethics.\n\nAgainst the popular idea amongst the economists - that ethics has no place in economics, Dolfsma and Negru (2019) have argued recently for a distinction between ethics in economics, ethics of economics and ethics of economists and challenged the idea that utilitarianism can be the dominant ethical position in economics. The agenda of the book gravitates around the ethical formation of economists through teaching, research, policy-making, media, etc. Taking this book as a point of departure, we pose the question: Is Ethics important for the study of the economy?\n\nThe workshop calls for contributions addressing the following themes:\n\nhow is ethics taught to economists (based on their specialisms: accountants, managers, marketing, finance economists, etc);\n\nis ethics needed in the economics curriculum at undergraduate and postgraduate level and should ethics be taught differently?\n\nhow do we teach economists various ethical theories such as utilitarianism, deontology or virtue-ethics?\n\ncan ethics be trained or learned?\n\nwhat would an ethics course for economists look like?\n\ncan economists practice alternative visions of ethics?\n\ncan we dialogue with mainstream economists regarding the teaching of ethics?\n\nPlease send a maximum 500 words abstract to Ioana Negru at ioana.negru@ulbsibiu.ro and the notification of acceptance will be received by participants by 15 of November. The workshop will take place on the premises of the University of Ulster, London, on Friday 20 March 2020. A book or a special issue, based on received contributions, will be the outcome of this project.\n\nSubmission Deadline: 1 November 2019\n\nWorkshop on \"The Role of Economic Experts in Crisis-Prone Societies\" (Naples, April 2020)\n\n15-18 April 2020 | Naples, Italy\n\nThe economic and financial crisis is still a critical issue in many European countries. Economic experts and economic expertise play an important role in framing, analysing and influencing these processes. In order to understand this impact, an analytical perspective on economists and economic expertise takes into account the diverse channels of influence as well as the professional and institutional backgrounds of economists. Papers are welcome that address the complexity and diversity of economic expertise. The âplaygroundâ of economists in crisis-prone societies stretches across many areas. Economists occupy positions at different levels of institutional hierarchy in different sectors, such as banks and firms, the state and media as well as within academia. They serve as consultants and advisors in several policy fields ranging from fiscal to health and social security policy. Economists are appointed to boards of big corporations, as governance experts, high civil servants and central bankers. Economists are also part of consulting teams for newspapers and other media, regularly publish op-eds and lead articles and thus exert influence on public debates.\n\nAdditionally, economists have become a dominant professional group, compared to traditional professions and other social science disciplines. At the international level, economists work in influential organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO and the ECB. They have also been able to constitute one of the most advanced examples of an international scientific field, resulting from a long process of standardization of practices, careers andcurricula, as well as an adoption of external technical tools from mathematics and physics.\n\nYet, economists do not form a homogeneous group and their power is unequally distributed amongst members of the profession. Strong hierarchies and strong ties, compared to other academic disciplines and professions, characterize the field of economics. Economists are clearly under-feminised and it can also be hypothesized that for the most part they come from higher middle class social backgrounds. Women, individuals with a working class background and individuals with a particularly local profile are more or less excluded from resources in terms of chairs, research funds, grants and editorial board positions. Nonetheless, such individuals are sometimes able to oppose real challenges to the dominant actors of the field.\n\nThe goal of our workshop is to get a better understanding of the social construction and perception of the debt crisis by analysing the relationship between economics and economic expert knowledge as a complex phenomenon that is involved in many different scientific, professional, political and public contexts. We welcome contributions that address this complexity of economic expert knowledge production through single case studies, general overviews or critical interventions.\n\nPlease submit your proposals (200-300 words) to Gerardo C. Nicoletta and Jens Maesse.\n\nSubmission Deadline: 10 December 2019\n\nCall for Participants\n\nWorkshop on \"Economic Development and Income Distribution in Small Open Economies\" (Rome, Dec. 2019)\n\n2-5 December 2019, Rome, Italy\n\nEconomic Development in general has always been associated with the traditional theories of economic thought, which, between 1870 and 1930, and from 1970 until today have dominated scientific thought. With rare exceptions in particular countries, the analysis of economic development has not been separate from these roots. Even taking into account certain exceptions, such as, for example, the Latin American structuralist school, some years during Keynesianism, Dependency theory, none has been able to develop a theory consistent enough to carry out the messianic task of opposing the principles of factorial substitution that prevail in traditional analysis.\n\nEven after certain very critical works in open economies like Mainwaring (1974, 1986), Steedman (1979a; 1979b), Metcalfe & Steedman (1979); the analysis of this type of economic analysis was losing weight in the theoretical sphere, leaving an empty space in the construction of an alternative theory. It is for this reason that the workshop attempts to relaunch, or accompany the relaunch of a research project on open economies that can be observed in recent works such as Senga, Fujimoto, & Tabuchi (2017); Ruffin (2002); Maneschi (2004); and Bhering (2017), and another strand has tried to link it with some Latin American Structuralist Thought, i.e., Crespo & Lazzarini (2015), Dvoskin & Feldman (2015, 2018a, 2018b), Dvoskin, Feldman & Ianni (2018), among others.\n\nWithin the project \"Towards a theory of Economic Development\", the groups of Complexity, Economic Development, Latin America, Political Economy of Europe and States and Markets of Young Scholars Initiative, hosted by Roma Tre Economic Department and Centro Sraffa, are very happy to organize this first workshop in small and open economies that will be held at Rome Tre University between December 2 and 5, 2019.\n\nThe Workshop will be divided into several blocks among which the following topics will be dealt with:\n\nPrices and distribution in the open economy (price-maker open economy, small open economy with and without rent)\n\nExogenous profit rates and the monetary theory of distribution in open economies\n\nAbsolute and Comparative Advantages\n\nPurchasing Power Parity vs. Law of One Price\n\nTraditional Latin American Structuralist view, technological and financial dependencies\n\nExchange rate policy, output growth and the pattern of specialization of peripheral economies\n\nUnequal Exchange and terms of trade\n\nThere will also be a special session devoted to the reality of Europe and the euro area.\n\nTargeted young scholars:\n\nPhD and master students that are writing their masters or PhD-thesis on topics that could benefit from the approaches that will be discussed in the workshop. No accommodation will be provided. We will provide only partial or full travel stipends to selected young scholars from all over the world. Diversity (in terms of gender, nationalities, affiliations, ideas) will be specifically taken into account as a criteria for the selection process. The workshop will be open to every young scholar aiming to attend, even if they do not present their work.\n\nHow to apply:\n\nYoung scholars will be invited to present a brief version of their papers. To do so, they will apply by sending a 2000 words extended abstract or research project describing their topic and research interests and questions (it could be a paper or chapter thesis, but we will also consider projects at an earlier stage, such as research questions or proposals) and why (and how) they think this workshop could help them with that research. Selected young scholars will have 30 minutes to present their projects and receive personal feedback. There will be also partial or full travel stipends for students not selected to present (within Europe and outside the region).\n\nFind further information here and for application here.\n\nApplication Deadline: 30 September 2019\n\nForum for Institutional Thought: \"Institutions and Survival: Social Order for the 21st Century\" (KrakÃ³w, Feb 2020)\n\nThe conference provides a platform for discussion about economic, legal and philosophical challenges and threats concerning the design and implementation of institutional solutions aimed at achieving better life standards in the 21st century.

Standard problems include intellectual suppression by the ignorant and the more general challenge of working within a system that just has a lot of 'issues'. In response to such constraints, we have established the School of Political Economy (SPE). The purpose of the school is to offer university-level instruction in political economy/heterodox economics that is free from many of the problems and constraints of the contemporary university. The courses offered are high-quality, innovative and pluralist. Students can study in either face-to-face or online mode. Fees are reasonably priced. The inaugural course will be âAn Introduction to Political Economy and Economicsâ commencing Oct 8th 2019. There is a suite of other courses planned for 2020, including subjects in economic history, comparative economics and upper level subjects in political economy.\n\nYou can register an expression of interest for these courses and I will contact you when 2020 enrolments open.\n\nInterested parties can find out more about the course and register here.\n\nUniversal Basic Income in Alaska: A podcast story\n\nIn his Autobiography John Stuart Mill wrote:\n\n\"[The main question is] how to unite the greatest individual liberty of action, with a common ownership in the raw material of the globe, and an equal participation of all in the benefits of combined labour.â\n\nSome part of the quote above is in Bold as it relates directly to universal basic income schemes based on the distribution of resource-based rents as lump-sum payments to citizens. Such schemes are becoming more important in the context of organizing carbon-taxation in a way that avoids negative distributional side-effects. In this context, I found the following podcast of interest, which shortly explains that such a system exists in Alaska since some decades.

The Changing Dynamics of Innovation in Technoscientific Capitalismâ. The project will examine the extent to which contemporary capitalism is characterized by destructive, predatory, captured, monopolistic, and unequal forms of rentiership. It is motivated by the increasing unease expressed by academics, politicians, business people, and activists from across the political spectrum with the problematic effects emerging in contemporary, technoscientific capitalism, especially the growing trend towards rentiership as opposed to entrepreneurship. Rentiership implies a shift from the construction of value through the sale of products and services to the capture of value from the ownership of and control over the conditions of production (e.g. land, money, knowledge, natural resources, etc.). In the former, profits come from competing to sell products and services; while in the latter, rents come from the ability to charge fees for access to productive assets like land, money, networks, personal property, knowledge, etc. The projectâs objectives are: (1) explore the prevalence of and differences in rentiership in contemporary technoscientific capitalism; (2) examine the empirical manifestations of different forms of rentiership (e.g. government fiat, monopoly, market control) in technoscientific capitalism; (3) unpack the implications of rentiership for innovation and financial strategies in technoscientific capitalism; and (4) outline the impacts of rentiership on research and innovation policy and policymaking in technoscientific capitalist countries.\n\nOverall Purpose of Postdoctoral Position\n\nAs a researcher with the project, in collaboration and with the guidance of the supervisor, and within the bounds of the project mandate, the Postdoctoral Fellow will undertake research leading to publication in leading international journals.

Immanuel Wallerstein's World Systems approach has been particularly important and led the term periphery into common scholarly parlance. Not surprisingly, much work remains to be done to untangle the extreme diversity and complexity of the political economies and resistances against the multidimensional cruelties perpetrated in the worldâs many, very different peripheral contexts.\n\nClass History and Class Practices in the Periphery of Capitalism addresses this need head-on. A first chapter lays a theoretical groundwork by showing that Marx, in his later life, became aware that historical developments are much more complicated than he originally conceived them to be, and he was not as far away from calling for site-specific analyses. Contributions here carry out just such analyses: they describe specificities for Russia, Portugal, Argentina, and Mexico, offer broader perspectives on post-hegemonic Latin America and Asia, provide detailed analyses of resistances across Africa, and reflect on the deeper meaning of neozapatismo for promoting a shift in the entire terrain of discussion.\n\nRich in theoretical depth and empirical rigor, and supplemented by an out-of-the-archive translation of Karl Katusky's theory of crises, this book is essential reading for students and scholars of political economy and international political economy, and it is of keen interest to anyone working to resist specific capitalist exploitations in their own place and time.\n\nPlease find a link to the book here.\n\nLeft Radicalism and Populism in Europe\n\nWhile there has been much focus in recent times on the rise of right-wing populism in Europe, there has been surprisingly little material on the phenomenon of left-wing populism. This edited collection seeks to fill that gap with an investigation of the relationship between the radical left and populism. Featuring a broad range of historical and contemporary case studies from across Europe, this is a much-needed empirical account of this phenomenon.\n\nThis book will be of considerable interest to researchers, scholars and students of left radicalism, European politics and the politics of social movements. It will also appeal to appeal to non-academic audiences, especially party and social movement activists because of its politically salient topic and its historical and comparative focus.\n\nPlease find a link to the book here.\n\nPaper Dragons: China and the Next Crash\n\nby Walden Bello | 2019, Zedbooks\n\nEmerging relatively unscathed from the banking crisis of 2008, China has been viewed as a model of both rampant success and fiscal stability. But beneath the surface lies a network of fissures that look likely to erupt into the next big financial crash. A bloated real-estate sector, roller-coaster stock market, and rapidly growing shadow-banking sector have all coalesced to create a perfect storm: one that is in danger of taking the rest of the worldâs economy with it.\n\nWalden Bello traces our recent history of financial crises â from the bursting of Japanâs âbubble economyâ in 1990 to Wall Street in 2008 â taking in their political and human ramifications such as rising inequality and environmental degradation. He not only predicts that China might be the site of the next crash, but that under neoliberalism this will simply keep happening. The only way that we can stop this cycle, Bello argues, is through a fundamental change in the ways that we organise: a shift to cooperative enterprise, respectful of the environment, and which fractures the twin legacies of imperialism and capitalism.\n\nPlease find a link to the book here.\n\nThe Power of Standards: Hybrid Authority and the Globalisation of Services\n\nby Jean-Christophe Graz | 2019, Cambridge University Press\n\nStandards often remain unseen, yet they play a fundamental part in the organisation of contemporary capitalism and society at large. What form of power do they epitomise? Why have they become so prominent? Are they set to be as important for the globalisation of services as for manufactured goods? Graz draws on international political economy and cognate fields to present strong theoretical arguments, compelling research and surprising evidence on the role of standards in the global expansion of services, with in-depth studies of their institutional environment and cases including the insurance industry and business process outsourcing in India. The power of standards resembles a form of transnational hybrid authority, in which ambiguity should be seen as a generic attribute, defining not only the status of public and private actors involved in standardisation and regulation, but also the scope of issues concerned and the space in which such authority is recognised when complying to standards.\n\nPlease find a link to the book here.\n\nThe Responsibility of Intellectuals: Reflections by Noam Chomsky and others after 50 years\n\nEdited by Nicholas Allott, Chris Knight and Neil Smith | 2019, UCL Press\n\nThis book revisits âThe Responsibility of Intellectualsâ half a century on and celebrates Chomskyâs life of activism. It includes six new essays written to celebrate Chomskyâs famous intervention. The authors were all inspired by the theme of the responsibility of intellectuals but their contributions are very varied. Some have been studying Chomskyâs thought for years, others write about their own personal experiences of the price paid for speaking out. The book has three contributions from Chomsky. He briefly explains the background to the original publication of âThe Responsibility Preface xi of Intellectualsâ. He also provides replies to the other contributors, with extensive commentary on issues that they raise. Finally, there is wideranging discussion from a question-and-answer session he conducted in February 2017 on the 50th anniversary of the publication of his essay.\n\nPlease find a link to the book here.\n\nThe State of the European Union: Fault Lines in European Integration\n\nby Stefanie WÃ¶hl, Elisabeth Springler, Martin Pachel, Bernhard Zeilinger | 2019, VS Verlag fÃ¼r Sozialwissenschaften\n\nAgainst the backdrop of combating the financial and economic crisis in the European Union for the past decade, this volume strives to explore the manifold impacts the prevailing crisis management has on the further alignment of European Integration. The efforts targeted at overcoming the financial and economic crisis evoked far-reaching consequences on the societal, economic, and political level within European member states, which in turn challenge the institutional alignment, democratic legitimacy and economic coherence of the European Union. Taking into account current developments in the EU, the contributions presented in this volume focus on the âfault linesâ in the integration process, i.e. questions of policy coherence, democratic accountability, financialization, militarization, migration, gendered social and economic asymmetries as well as the rise of populist and extreme right-wing parties. The volume focuses on how these different developments come together by relating aspects of transdisciplinary research to uncover the fault lines in the European integration project in the subsequent chapters.\n\nPlease find a link to the book here.\n\nThe Unknowers: How Strategic Ignorance Rules the World\n\nby Lindsey McGoey | 2019, ZedBooks\n\nDeliberate ignorance has been known as the âOstrich Instructionâ in law courts since the 1860s. It illustrates a recurring pattern in history in which figureheads for major companies, political leaders and industry bigwigs plead ignorance to avoid culpability. So why do so many figures at the top still get away with it when disasters on their watch damage so many peopleâs lives?\n\nWhen the phone hacking scandal rocked the United Kingdom in 2011, Rupert Murdoch, CEO of News International, knew nothing of the criminal goings-on. After a fire swept through the Grenfell Tower, it soon came to light that the tragedy was a result of the wilful ignorance of experts. Does the idea that knowledge is power still apply in todayâs post-truth world?\n\nEncompassing the building of industrial empires in 19th century America to the legal defences of today, The Unknowers shows that ignorance has not only long been an inherent part big business, but also that true power lies in the ability to convince others of where the boundary between ignorance and knowledge lies.\n\nPlease find a link to the book here.\n\nThreatening Property: Race, Class, and Campaigns to Legislate Jim Crow Neighborhoods\n\nby Elizabeth A. Herbin-Triant | 2019, Columbia University Press\n\nWhite supremacists determined what African Americans could do and where they could go in the Jim Crow South, but they were less successful in deciding where black people could live because different groups of white supremacists did not agree on the question of residential segregation. In Threatening Property, Elizabeth A. Herbin-Triant investigates early-twentieth-century campaigns for residential segregation laws in North Carolina to show how the version of white supremacy supported by middle-class white people differed from that supported by the elites. Class divides prevented Jim Crow from expanding to the extent that it would require separate neighborhoods for black and white southerners as in apartheid South Africa.\n\nHerbin-Triant details the backlash against the economic successes of African Americans among middle-class whites, who claimed that they wished to protect property values and so campaigned for residential segregation laws both in the city and the countryside, where their actions were modeled on South Africaâs Natives Land Act. White elites blocked these efforts, primarily because it was against their financial interest to remove the black workers that they employed in their homes, farms, and factories. Herbin-Triant explores what the split over residential segregation laws reveals about competing versions of white supremacy and about the position of middling whites in a region dominated by elite planters and businessmen. An illuminating work of social and political history, Threatening Property puts class front and center in explaining conflict over the expansion of segregation laws into private property.\n\nPlease find a link to the book here.\n\nHeterodox Graduate Programs, Scholarships and Grants\n\nInternational Doctoral School in \"Law, Ethics and Economics for Sustainable Development\"\n\nJob title: Doctoral Research Positions in Law, Ethics and Economics for Sustainable Development\n\nThe Universities of Milan, Rijeka and Maastricht are seeking six outstanding and committed students to carry out a three-year multidisciplinary research project, based at more than one participating university. The three universities are launching LEES, a new doctoral programme in International and Public Law, Ethics and Economics for Sustainable Development. With courses, seminars and scientific research activities entirely in English, it addresses the complexities involved in sustainable development, and uses an innovative multidisciplinary approach that combines the contributions of law, ethics, and economics. The broad interdisciplinary view that inspires the PhD programme is here attached. The programme is managed by a highly qualified international doctoral board and supervised by an international scientific council composed by top scholars in the relevant fields of law ethics and economics (see attachment), which will advise the board on the development of research lines and the programme of the yearly international workshops and summer schools.\n\nThe first year of the programme will be based in Milan, where the PhD students will attend courses and seminars, and participate in the activities and events of the academic community of the Department. The second and third years will mainly be dedicated to studentsâ own personal research projects and to participating in the large-scale joint project by working with one of our partner universities, and with the cooperation of their advisors. To enable their participation in the joint project, students will have access to additional funding and will have the opportunity to carry out part of their research either in one of the other leading universities â Rijeka or Maastricht â or in another partner university (see full list attached) depending"
