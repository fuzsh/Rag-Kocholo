For over seven years, the DHNB conferences have brought together academics, researchers, students, librarians, archivists, curators and museum professionals interested in creating and using digitised and born-digital collections as research data in the humanities, social sciences and arts. The DHNB has matured both as an organisation and as a community, something which is evident in the extensive compilation of outputs (https://dhnb.eu/publications/). Our annual gatherings have consistently served as a forum to showcase digital research, methodologies, technology, pedagogy and practice at the intersection that exists between academic disciplines and cultural heritage institutions. With its present level of maturity, the DHNB is now offering an opportunity to reflect on the development of these approaches and share insights that have been gained along the way.\n\nSPECIAL THEME\n\nOne unique aspect of the DHNB community is the active involvement of professionals from libraries, archives, and museums alongside digital humanities researchers. In the DHNB 2024 call for papers, we would particularly like to place emphasis on sharing lessons learned from collaborative initiatives between academic and cultural heritage communities, something that is exemplified by the work of our conference host, the Icelandic Centre for Digital Humanities and Arts.\n\nTopics of interest for the theme of DHNB2024 include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nCROSS-INSTITUTIONAL AND INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIONS\n\nLessons learned from collaborative projects across disciplines (DHSS: Digital Humanities and the Social Sciences, DHCH: Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage), across GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) institutions, Digital Humanities and Arts infrastructures and programmes\n\nCollaborative graduate programs and internships\n\nThe role of DH support units in facilitating the use of digital collections and tools\n\nBest practices in developing, maintaining and sustaining national and transnational research infrastructures\n\nStrategies for learning from failures in collaborative initiatives\n\nEDUCATION AND ADVOCACY\n\nLessons learned from creating and running DH programs in higher education, arts and cultural organisations\n\nAdvances in approaches to teaching digital tools and methods, including opportunities to embed such initiatives into academic programs\n\nThe role of GLAM and DH Labs in innovation and outreach initiatives\n\nLessons learned from organising educational and outreach events such as workshops, hackathons, interactive exhibitions, show-and-tells\n\nGuidelines and best practices for effectively managing open educational resources for digital humanities and arts\n\nTHE LIFE CYCLE OF DIGITAL HUMANITIES AND ARTS PROJECTS\n\nCreating and using cultural heritage collections as data: workflows, checklists, tools\n\nThe reproducibility and repurposing of data, workflows, and lessons learned\n\nThe challenges involved in managing complex DH projects\n\nApproaches to long-term sustainability and the longevity of digital humanities and arts projects, including digital preservation\n\nBest practices in tailoring Research Data Management (RDM) policies to the needs of the digital humanities and cultural heritage communities\n\nThe DHNB encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including the humanities, arts, the social sciences, and related fields. Professionals working in various sectors, such as cultural heritage, information and communications technology, and research software engineering, are encouraged to contribute and share their perspectives on working in an institutional setting within the digital humanities framework. The Program Committee welcomes and encourages submissions from early career researchers, new cultural heritage professionals and individuals who will be attending or presenting for the first time.\n\nTIMELINE\n\nSUBMISSION GUIDELINES\n\nAs an interdisciplinary conference between traditions, the conference welcomes both abstract as well as full-text submissions in the following three categories:\n\nLong papers | 20-minute presentations with a 10-minute Q&A\n\nMust be submitted as either:\n\nAbstract of 1000–2000 words excluding references, or\n\nFull-text of 8–16 pages, including references\n\nMust include 3-5 keywords.\n\nShort papers | 10-minute presentations with a 5-minute Q&A\n\nAbstract of 500–1000 words excluding references, or\n\nFull-text of 4–8 pages, including references\n\nMust include 3-5 keywords.\n\nPosters and demos with accompanying a 1-minute lightning talk\n\nAbstract of 250-500 words excluding references, or\n\nFull-text of 2–4 pages, including references\n\nMust include 3-5 keywords.\n\nBetween the proposal categories, the following conceptual divisions apply: for long papers, the work is expected to be substantial and robust, while short papers can also report on preliminary or tentative results, or on work that is still in progress. Poster papers can either be small self-contained works, or also general project descriptions. The programme committee also reserves the right to accept submissions in a category different from the one submitted in, so e.g. a long paper can be accepted to be presented as a short paper or as a poster in the poster session.\n\nAll full-text submissions must be formatted according to the DHNB PUB template, as they will be published in a citable conference proceedings collection (https://journals.uio.no/dhnbpub/index). The abstracts, on the other hand, will be gathered into a book of abstracts. After the conference, a separate call for post-proceedings will be issued, with its own deadlines for submissions, reviews and revisions. Additional information and instructions can be found on the DHNB website: https://dhnb.eu/publications/.\n\nApart from the individual paper submissions, the conference also accepts proposals for:\n\n60 to 90-minute panels\n\nMust be submitted as an abstract of between 1000 and 2000 words (excluding references)\n\nThis must include outlines of individual contributions of 200-400 words\n\nIt must also include 200-word introduction outlining the panel’s overarching theme\n\nMust include: title and panel description\n\nThe name(s), contact details and organisational affiliation(s) of the panel proposer(s)\n\nThe name(s) of the panellists involved during the live session, and the moderator\n\nExamples of the questions that will be discussed by the panellists\n\nAt least 25 minutes should be allocated to the discussion.\n\nHalf-day or full-day conference-themed workshops\n\nMust be submitted as an abstract of between 500 and 1500 words\n\nThis must include information about the coordinator(s), format, target audience, anticipated number of participants, ideal length, and technical requirements\n\nIt must also include details about expected learning outcome(s)\n\nWorkshops can take many forms, from community hacking sessions to thematically focused mini-conferences attached to the main one, whose presentations are either pre-selected, or sourced through separate calls for proposals solicited by the workshop coordinators.\n\nHalf-day or full-day tutorials\n\nThese should focus on tools, technologies, or practical exercises\n\nMust be submitted as an abstract of between 500 and 1500 words\n\nThis must include information about the coordinator(s), format, target audience, anticipated number of participants, ideal length, and technical requirements\n\nIt must also include details about expected learning outcome(s).\n\nHOW TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL\n\nAll proposals should be submitted in English via the ConfTool conference management system. In addition to following the submission-specific requirements outlined above, proposals should clearly state how they contribute to the advancement of topics related to the conference themes, how they relate to previous work (if applicable), and the potential impact they may have on the advancement of the field. All proposals should be accompanied by three to five keywords.\n\nWithin the appropriate fields (author details and affiliations), submissions should include: name(s), contact details and the organisational affiliation of the author(s) along with the name(s) of presenters. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper. Participants can only be the first author (= presenter) of one paper at the conference and the second author/contributor of one additional paper (long paper, panel, or show-and-tell presentation).\n\nAnyone interested in submitting a proposal for the ad-hoc program, such as drop-in talks, lean coffee, or show-and-tell, can contact us at DHNB2024@hi.is.\n\nTHE DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS IS 21 JANUARY (AOE / UTC-12) 2024.\n\nHTTPS://WWW.CONFTOOL.ORG/DHNB2024/\n\nSubmitted proposals will undergo a single-blind peer-review process whereby the reviewers know the names/affiliations of the abstract authors and co-authors. Authors may be asked to make revisions before publication. The program committee will review all submissions and send out notifications of acceptance/rejection by 15 February.\n\nAuthors will be asked to review their submissions before the publication.\n\nFor questions, please send an email to DHNB2024@hi.is\n\nOfficial event website: http://www.digitalhumanities.lv/baltic-dh-forum-2024\n\nDigital humanities have become a solid part of the research landscapes in the Baltic countries. Certainly, over the past decades, this transformation has been evident through the vibrant and enthusiastic DH communities, the emergence of new research groups and centers, and the increasing presence of digital humanities courses and programs in higher education. This marks the right time for the digital humanities communities of the three Baltic States to come together, to look at how and in what directions DH has developed in our countries, to reflect on what is relevant today and to project what lies ahead in the near future.\n\nThe Baltic DH Forum will take place for two days. The initial day will comprise three sessions featuring invited speakers from the Baltic DH research communities, Ministries, and prominent European digital humanities infrastructures, including CLARIN ERIC and DARIAH-EU. The second day is designed as a networking platform providing an opportunity to present DH projects, showcase developed digital resources and tools, and introduce educational initiatives. Additionally, the afternoon of the second day will host a series of workshops covering successful practices in collaborative projects, fundraising opportunities, and other relevant topics.\n\nParticipation in the forum with presentation is free of charge with coffee breaks, lunches, and a dinner provided.\n\nTo apply for participation in the Baltic DH Forum “Demonstration and Networking Session” (2nd Day), you are invited to submit an abstract of your presentation (200–250 words) in one of the following categories:\n\nDH resource or tool\n\nProject\n\nEducational initiative, including training materials\n\nSubmissions are encouraged in diverse areas within digital humanities, including, but not limited to:\n\nComputational linguistics and language technologies\n\nComputational literature studies\n\nDigital history and archaeology studies\n\nDigital folklore studies and ethnography\n\nDigital cultural heritage\n\nDigital musicology\n\nDH and endangered cultures and languages\n\nDigital environmental humanities\n\nGame studies and digital humanities\n\nCitizen science and crowdsourcing\n\nSubmit your proposals here by January 25, 2024.\n\nApplications will be peer-reviewed by the programme committee, with the main criterion being relevance to the field of digital humanities.\n\nDuring the “Demonstration and Networking Session” each presenter is expected to give a brief pitch talk (approximately 5–7 minutes) to the plenary audience, followed by discussions at the poster hall.\n\nAfter the Baltic DH Forum, participants will be offered an opportunity to prepare a peer-reviewed publication for a special issue of The Baltic Journal of Modern Computing, Scopus-indexed.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact us at dh@lulfmi.lv or sanita.reinsone@lulfmi.lv.\n\nProgramme committee:\n\nLV: Sanita Reinsone (ILFA*), Haralds Matulis (ILFA), Inguna Skadiņa (IMCS), Anda Baklāne (NLL), Ilze Auziņa (IMCS), Normunds Grūzītis (IMCS), Antra Kļavinska (RTA), Jānis Daugavietis (ILFA), Valts Ernštreits (UL LI)\n\nLT: Andrius Utka (VDU), Costis Dallas (VU)\n\nEE: Joshua Wilbur (UT)\n\nAdministrative support:\n\nViktorija Piščikova (NLL), Līva Ostupe (ILFA), Māris Bušs (UL DF), Māra Bičevska (UL DF), Elvīra Žvarte (ILFA), Ilze Ļaksa-Timinska (ILFA)\n\nInstitutions*\n\nILFA: Institute of Literature, Folklore and Art of the University of Latvia\n\nIMCS: Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Latvia\n\nNLL: National Library of Latvia\n\nRTA: Rēzekne Technology Academy\n\nUL DF: University of Latvia Faculty of Computing\n\nUL LI: University of Latvia Livonian Institute\n\nUT: University of Tartu\n\nVDU: Vytautas Magnus University\n\nVU: Vilnius University\n\nSupporters\n\nLanguage Technology Initiative, funded by the European Union and the National Development Plan. https://www.vti.lu.lv/en\n\n\"Towards Development of Open and FAIR Digital Humanities Ecosystem in Latvia,” implemented within the framework of the National Research Programme “Digital Humanities”.

Inspired by initial large gatherings of the cultural analytics community, including UCLA/IPAM 2016, and multidisciplinary conferences such as NetSci, IC2S2, or CCS, we aim to bring together researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders using methods of cultural data analytics to understand cultures and cultural production. This particularly includes multidisciplinary combinations of quantification, qualitative inquiry, computational analysis, and visualization to make sense of large cultural datasets, including visual, audiovisual, linguistic, and other genres of socio-cultural materials. The conference is scheduled to happen in Tallinn, Estonia from December 13 to 16, 2023, including a number of leading invited practitioners, peer-reviewed talks, and poster contributions from the community.\n\nAbstracts due: July 24, 2023 (23:59 CET)\n\nNotification of acceptance: September 14, 2023\n\nConference: December 13-16, 2023\n\nPre-conference workshops: December 13, 2023\n\nMain conference: December 14-16, 2023\n\nWinter morning in Tallinn.

We accept contributed talks, lightning talks, and posters (please indicate your preference). We strive for an in-person event to maximize community interaction, yet we will offer a limited amount of remote presentation slots. Review is single-blind.\n\nIn the spirit of multidisciplinary abstract conferences and idea conferences, we encourage submissions which aim to present entirely novel work, and also recently published contributions which would benefit from broader multidisciplinary discussion. In the latter case, please make sure to cite the original publication venue.\n\nSUBMIT HERE: https://openreview.net/group?id=CUDAN.tlu.ee/2023/Conference\n\nConference scope\n\nCultures and cultural production are multifaceted phenomena, which, like other complex systems, cannot be fully understood from the perspective of a single specific discipline. This is why the core mission of cultural data analytics is to join forces and make headway across disciplines and domains of expertise. Feeding into this mission, we welcome both multidisciplinary submissions, and contributions from specific disciplines, which aim to benefit from discussion in a multidisciplinary forum.\n\nWe encourage discussion towards a deeper understanding of cultures and cultural production including aspects, methods, and intersections of the following fields:\n\n– cultural analytics, culturomics, and socio-cultural data science;\n\n– digital humanities and computational humanities;\n\n– cultural evolution, including experimental and observational approaches;\n\n– cultural complexity science, network science, computational social science, and social physics;\n\n– computational linguistics, quantitative aesthetics, critical computer vision, and machine learning;\n\n– art history, cultural history, cultural semiotics, film studies, musicology, and urbanism;\n\n– artistic research, algorithmic curation, and AI art (including aspects of cultural data analysis);\n\n– creative industries research, media economics, and policy studies;\n\n– data journalism, data science, and information visualization.\n\nContributions ideally address at least one of the following subject domains (in line with state-of-the-art conceptual reference models for cultural data):\n\n– material aspects, including artworks, architecture, texts, images, sound, film, digital media, databases, and other forms of tangible cultural heritage;\n\n– conceptual aspects, including cultural practices, rituals, theories, policies, data models, narratives, imagined communities, and other forms of intangible cultural heritage;\n\n– social aspects, including human behaviour, human mobility, social networks, and social media;\n\n– temporal aspects, from slow historical processes to turbulence in today’s economy of attention;\n\n– spatial aspects of historical topography, cultural geography, and urban dynamics;\n\n– event aspects, which combine the above aspects in cultural co-production, event series, tourism, etc.;\n\n– network aspects of socio-cultural interaction, including the inherent ecology of complex networks as documented in the structure and dynamics of large cultural knowledge graphs or blockchains associated with the crypto-art-market, for example.\n\nConference program\n\nThe CUDAN 2023 main conference programme (December 14-16, 2023) will include six keynotes covering the spectrum of relevant disciplines, a lightning talk session in the plenary, parallel sessions, and a poster section. The latter will run throughout the whole conference in the coffee and lunch area that is collocated with the plenum. The conference will close with a best poster and best paper award ceremony.\n\nThe pre-conference day (December 13, 2023) will feature introductory workshops by CUDAN senior fellows, covering aspects of cultural data analysis and visualization using Python, R, Tableau, and the Collection Space Navigator.\n\nBefore and after the main conference, we will offer sightseeing tours, including the medieval Tallinn old town and Christmas market (among many reasons to visit Estonia).\n\nWe are further planning a meet the publisher’s session and other opportunities for relevant stakeholders, including exhibition booths.\n\nIf you or your institution/company is interested in participation, please contact us via email to cudan@tlu.ee, ideally before September 14, 2023.\n\nRegistration & Accommodation\n\nAs we are fully funded through the European Commission, there will be no conference fee for accepted participants, with the exception of the conference dinner. Accepted participants are required to register and confirm their attendance.

The workshop will bring together for the second time a group of people associated with both CLARIN (or other research infrastructures) and libraries. Whereas the first CLARIN and Libraries workshop was particularly concerned with digital content delivery for researchers, the main theme of the second workshop will be large language models and library collections, e.g. technical challenges in building such models and legal implications of model training and use.\n\nThe host, the National Library of Norway (NLN), has since 2005 digitised its entire text collections, amounting at present to a large corpus of 160 billion words for Norwegian and has built large language models for text (BERT, GPT-2, T5) and speech (wav2vec, Whisper) on these collections. There will be keynotes from the National Libraries of Norway and Germany on the technical aspects of building such models in a library setting, as well as a keynote on the legal aspects of building large language models from the Swedish National Library.\n\nParticipation in the workshop is by invitation. If you are interested in attending, please contact your national coordinator or clarin@clarin.eu. The venue (National Library of Norway, Henrik Ibsens gate 110, Oslo) is located very close to the train station Nationaltheatret. Descriptions for getting to the venue can be found here.\n\nProgramme\n\nTuesday 5 December 2023\n\nWednesday 6 December 2023\n\nAddress\n\nNational Library of Norway\n\nHenrik Ibsens gate 110\n\n0255 Oslo\n\nNorway"
