        "text": "Professor Rogoff has a very good intuition/point here: any program that is not an emanation of national consensus on the need to reform will not succeed. That is why the self-imposed structural reforms – read sacrifices – of Finland and the Baltic countries were successful. Most of the Greeks see themselves as victims. If they are victims, then they are the victims of their own political, economic, social and moral choices.\n\nA legacy of 400 years of Ottoman rule is still there: the addiction to tax avoidance, corruption, clientelism, mismanagement. While Greece is geographically part of Europe- the rest is not.\n\nThe referendum was a travesty of democracy – ask your people if they would like not to pay back their debt and guess what you get. How about Luxemburg organizing a referendum with the question: ’Should Europe give us 200 billion in loans that we have no intention of paying back?’. Of course, Europe will have to respect the democratic decision of an independent nation.\n\nIt is true that most of the recent bailouts went to pay back the’institutions’ that gradually replaced the private debt-holders.\n\nBut, let us take few steps back in the past: where are the hundreds of billions of euros that Greece borrowed in the first place on the financial markets (that Goldman Sachs helped the Greek government to hide from Bruxelles)? As an independent state, Greece did not feel obliged to respect the EU rule – maximum 60% debt to GDP -, a rule that very few European countries are actually respecting, including Germany and France. No European authority raised a warning finger, on the contrary, Greece benefited of generous assistance to the tune of hundreds of billions or euros since the country joined EU(1979) and later , more incredible, the Eurozone (2002)\n\nSo Mr. Juncker should publish the full amounts of all structural, agricultural, development funds, etc. that Greece benefited from in the past 35 years, without any obligation to pay back or at least to show some tangible results in terms of economic progress? Do you know where that money is? Geneva is not far away from Athens.\n\nWhat we get from the EU institutions and politicians are nothing but misguided historic and philosophical references about the cradle of democracy. Well, no Plato or Aristotle were born the past 2000 years, and the Greek finance ministers do not seem to be aware or bothered much about the free rider and moral hazard concepts. But the other European tax payers do very much, in a union that looks like a transfer union out of control and out of governance.\n\nWhy the reforms failed? The reforms failed for two reasons, a) because the previous Greek government was reluctant to enforce them and the new government is unwilling to do so. and b) because they were the wrong reforms.\n\nWhat is wrong with Greece? A) An unbelievably huge bureaucracy that eats away close to 1/3 of Greece’s annual budget. One in eight Greeks work for the government. In Germany 3.3% of the population work for the government, in Austria 1.1% and in Belgium .8%. In Greece 8% of the population works for the government. B) Illegal immigration. Last year 50 billion Euros were sent to foreign countries by the illegals who live in Greece. With an average 15% sales tax, every time a Euro is spent in Greece the government collects 15% sales tax. With an average life span of three years, a Euro will return to the government coffers in the form of sales tax and income tax in three years from the time it is released in the market place. Therefore, the 50 billion that leaves Greece annually creates an annual haircut on the GDP of the same amount. A country collects on the average 30 to 40% of its GDP in revenues annually. When that fifty billion leaves Greece, that means the Greek government will not collect any taxes on that money, therefore the direct impact will be as if that money were removed directly from the GDP.\n\nThen Greece pays the Illegal immigrants welfare checks and provides for them free healthcare, free education, and other free services. That is estimated between 11 and 15 Billion annually. Greece can’t afford the illegal immigration, period.\n\nGreece aging population. Around 25% of the Greek population is on pension.\n\nThe Europeans tried to address the Greek bureaucracy and the Greek pension system but they found an unwilling government to make such reforms. At that point their focus should have been turned to growth. But even in that area they would find the Greek government unwilling to accept reforms, because of Greece’s unaccountable syndicalism. Greece’s labor laws are an impediment to industrial growth. The Samara’s government made a decent attempt to reform labor law put the new government destroyed all market reforms Samara’s government had done.\n\nSo in conclusion those are the areas that could fix Greece and since the Greek system doesn’t allow for any innovation, then the Europeans may need to focus on how to fix the Greek government first before they can make a dent on debt reform.\n\nFRIDAY JULY 3, 2015\n\nBETA\n\n•Greek Edition\n\n•classifieds\n\n•subscriptions\n\nFAVORITES No favorites\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nTerm\n\nNavigation\n\nNEWS\n\nBUSINESS\n\nCOMMENT\n\nLIFE\n\nWHAT’S ON\n\nSPORTS\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nSURVIVAL GUIDE\n\nMULTIMEDIA\n\nNEWS 02.07.2015 : 14:16\n\nDeclaration of Professors of Economics at Greek Universities on the Referendum\n\nSource: ekathimerini.com\n\nTAGS: Referendum, Euro\n\nThe following declaration is signed by 246 professors at Economics Schools and Universities in Greece. By this declaration, we want to express our great distress about the latest developments in our country. We strongly believe that, at this crucial point, it is of paramount importance to avoid excesses, to show national cohesion, to preserve our position in the Eurozone and the EU, and to regain our credibility in the international community. Further, the fiscal consolidation program, drawn jointly with our EU partners and other creditors like the IMF, should be characterized by the lowest possible recessionary consequences and the highest possible level of social protection, aiming at growth and job creation in the private sector as soon as possible. The prolonged political uncertainty has led the economy to a renewed recession, has reversed the decline in unemployment, has lowered tax revenue and has widened the fiscal gap.\n\nTaking into account that the proposals of our creditors and the Greek government were converging until last Friday, we believe that what is really at stake in the coming Referendum, irrespective of the precise formulation of the question, is whether Greece will remain, or not, in the Eurozone and, possibly, whether it will remain in the EU itself.\n\nThe funding of the Greek economy by Eurozone countries was suspended last weekend after the Greek government abandoned the negotiations at a time when no alternative funding opportunities seem to be available. We are already at the first stage of a very slippery process that, if not urgently reversed, will lead to a chaotic debt default and exit from the Eurozone. Bank closures and capital controls (that had been so far avoided throughout the deep crisis) constitute only the first rupture from the Eurozone and the EU itself\n\nWe believe that the recessionary consequences of debt default and exit from the Eurozone, especially in such a chaotic and superficial way, will be much worse than the effects of a painful compromise with our EU partners and the IMF. A disorderly break of our country from the core of Europe will have disastrous economic, social, political and geopolitical consequences.\n\nShort-run consequences: Bank closures, cut in the value of deposits, sharp decline in tourism, shortages of basic consumer goods and raw materials, black market, hyperinflation, firm bankruptcies and a big rise in unemployment, rapid fall in real wages and the real value of pensions, deep recession and serious problems in the functioning of public health care and defense, social unrest.\n\nMedium-term consequences: international isolation of the country, no access to international capital markets for several years, low growth and anemic investment, high unemployment combined with high inflation rates, suspension of the flow of EU structural funds, significant decline in the standard of living, poor provision of basic public goods and services.\n\nAll these developments should not have happened after 5 years of big sacrifices by the Greek people, and a tremendous fiscal adjustment, right at the time when the economy was starting to recover, with favourable expectations for further easing in the terms of our public debt obligations. They should not have happened in a period when the European economy is returning to positive growth rates and other peripheral euro countries start growing and reducing unemployment. They should not have happened in a favorable time for further EU integration that will benefit the South and when the ECB facilitates growth with excess liquidity and zero interest rates.\n\nLeaving the Eurozone, especially with this chaotic and superficial way, would likely lead to a process of leaving the EU too, with unpredictable and disastrous consequences for the national security and the democratic stability of our country.\n\nFor all these reasons, Greece must remain in the core of the EU, which is the Eurozone.\n\nFor all these reasons, our unequivocal answer to the real question of the referendum is: YES. Yes, to Europe.\n\n1. Adam Αntonis University of Ioannina\n\n2. Aggelidis Timotheos University of Peloponnese\n\n3. Alexakis Christos University of Pireaus\n\n4.

Lets assume that Greece would have to pay the full 106 billion in these 3 years. Mr Rogoff may be a good accountant (rumours on a recent publication of his even deny this), but he is definitely not an economist. He suggests that the total of the *private* (see PSI) debt write-down was a (net) inflow, even though ***it was announced*** as a transient default. I will remind to Mr Rogoff that a failed debt contract has three parties responsible. It is totally arbitrary on his part to expect a full payment from the Greek side and account non-payment as a net inflow. I will also remind Mr Rogoff and like-minded neo-liberals that Greece could have defaulted on its own to get these \"European inflows\".\n\nThen, Mr Rogoff attempts to make clumsy arguments:\n\n__ \"Breaking down dual labor markets that are excluding young workers [...] is very different from making it easier to fire all workers.\"\n\n__ \"Making pension systems sustainable does not amount to making them stingier.\"\n\n__ \" Making tax systems simpler and fairer is not the same as raising all taxes.\"\n\nAll these arguments are made, at best, from a comfortable office that shields him from any relation to Greek reality, or, at worst, is fully detached from what are the actual demands raised by the IMF.\n\nDespite false neoliberal pretence of the author that it's just that the public sector must be meritocratic, the IMF has both required shrinking down the state and not taxing the rich, as well as not reversing the already imposed abolition of collective bargaining rights (which SYRIZA has promised). So, this argument is a complete hypocrisy, or the author is detached from reality (because he is otherwise very well informed, so as to manipulate the data).\n\nRegarding the pension system, the author, comfortably, forgets that pension funds have gigantic loses from PSI, which are being disregarded, to reduce the officially accepted loses of the banking system. But, it is not the pensioners fault that the state had to use their reserves --and save the lenders of more bailout funds for the banks--, so, now, it is the Greek state's responsibility not to put the pressure on the the pensioners but on the rich benefiting from the banking system. This is not allowed --it is reversed in SYYRIZA government proposals-- supposedly by the IMF. In other words, the \"fairer tax system\" is only after the IMF and the author conveniently forget that all the costs of the crisis are being born by the weak and the indefensible, since the government is defused by the IMF!\n\nProductive capital has always been the name of game. The only variations on it come from what portion of the value which is created goes to the capital owner, the worker, and the state: capitalism, socialism, communism, ... in all their various nuances.\n\nThe ability for a community to develop productivity gains is entirely incumbent on their relationship to property - man's relationship with property, to be exact - within the context of their belief system.\n\nIn Europe, there is a noticeable demarkation between north and south along the lines of Protestantism and Catholicism. Not a new story. Greece follows the Orthodox Christian tradition making it an outlier to the other two. However, since 1989, with the fall of communism, the Protestant approach to capitalism has washed over the world in the form of Globalization causing innumerable conflicts large and small. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Italy had to impose an autocratic government, represented by Mario Monti and his ministers, to force a change toward this dominant economic paradigm. Since then, I don't think any of the successive Italian governments has been elected. The Italian experience has been anything but joyous for the Italian people even as they continue to make their way toward this reality. For Greece, once again, it is more challenging given its belief system and the bargaining power brought about by its relative size.\n\nThis brings me back to productivity gains. First of all, the country requires a legislative framework which can define various asset classes and their transferability, amongst other rights and obligations. Second, the economic system needs to provide a framework by which those assets can be exploited and the value derived so that it can be decided who gets what portion: capital owner, labor, and state.\n\nAmerica is able to make an asset class out of just about anything. And, derivative products follow close behind. But not all countries can for the very simple reason that man's relationship to property is different. As we move from West to East, relationships are much important for survival than property.\n\nThe bailout failed because the structural changes addressed the institutions that kept the system working in specific way but did little to put in place new mechanism which ultimately might fail because they are based on an alien concept of man and property.\n\nWhy did the Greek bailout fail? The Greek bailout failed because IMF economists had been advising the EU officials based on a static analysis that took only economics into consideration. Whereas a dynamic interplay between law and economics has been going on all the while:\n\nThe treaties that constitute the European Union, that were signed into law, between 1950 and 2000, were based on the expectations and assurances provided by certain economic models. These economic models advocated balanced budgets among the member states, with specific limits on their budget deficits. Continuing these same expectations, when the Euro currency was designed and introduced in the late 90s, sound money policy was the basis for the economic models that were used for policy analysis. From there on, the EU institutions believed that they had codified these economic models into a legal framework through treaty obligations, rules and regulations binding the member states.\n\nThis legal framework is what the EU institutions adopt as the basis of their policies. They do not go by the preferences expressed by elected governments, nor do they allow for any changes in the economic models. Policies/treaties that were already committed by the member governments forms the basis of any discussions that these EU institutions undertake. Thus in the case of Greece, the baseline scenario that the so-called Troika [ECB, EC, IMF] would consider earlier commitments made by previous governments -- a steady state of 4.5% primary surplus, cuts in pensions, raising retirement ages, tax raises, etc. Any self-righteous protestations by the newly elected Syriza government that the GDP has contracted 25% since the time the austerity program began five years ago, would be acknowledged respectfully, but the Troika officials would not know what to do with that information. The economic models that were frozen into a legal framework between the 18 Eurozone countries does not deal with these situations. Starting with the baseline, the current phase of negotiations from February to June of 2015 would have only allowed for minor deviations from the baseline. Thus, the Greek government had little chance from the beginning.\n\nHowever, the situation with the economic models changed drastically after the economic crisis of 2008. Following the unconventional monetary policy experiments tried by the Federal Reserve in America, the ECB realized that it would have to abandon its sound money policy. Instead, it would have to do QE. At this point, the institutional inertia of the Troika still did not allow for any recognition that the original economic models based on so-called market fundamentalism were proven terribly inadequate after the economic crisis of 2008.\n\nAs a result, even while all the goodies of QE that were obtained by unlimited money printing were to be shared among the EU Core countries, the Troika continued to insist on austerity for the peripheral countries. This post-2008 disconnect between law and economics ended up undermining the credibility of the Troika. This is the main reason why no matter how much the Greek government would have bought into the reform program proposed by the Troika, it would not have succeeded."
