        "text": "She’s got charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent; the legendary Queen of Drag, RuPaul, makes herstory with their new Madame Tussauds London figure, featuring a bespoke look created by Zaldy, Emmy Award winning designer and Ru’s long-time collaborator.\n\nMichelle Visage - RuPaul’s right-hand woman known for sharing her fierce opinions as a fellow judge on the iconic TV series RuPaul’s Drag Race - visited the Baker Street attraction to give her seal of approval on the new figure before it launches to guests.\n\nRuPaul – TV personality, singer, producer, actor and author – has been a cultural staple for more than 30 years. A trailblazer and beacon for the queer industry, the beloved Queen of Drag has inspired millions to be proud to be your authentic self, showing that we’re all ‘born naked, and the rest is drag’. The phenomenal success of TV series RuPaul’s Drag Race has credited Mama Ru with popularising drag to the masses. Airing in over 15 countries, with each episode often pulling in more than a million viewers, the show has received several accolades since it first aired in 2009, including 14 Primetime Emmy Awards, three GLAAD Media Awards, and a Tony Award.\n\nOn first sight of Ru’s figure at Madame Tussauds London, Michelle Visage said, “It’s GORGEOUS! The teeth, the lips, the nails. It’s like I’m at home and with Ru! Fans and guests will love this figure, the artists have made this so beautifully and I see Ru. Everything drag stands for – authenticity, being daring and not afraid to be who you truly are – is reflected in this gorgeous figure.\n\nI also love that I’ve made it on the dress!! Zaldy, Ru’s longtime designer, who exclusively made this beautiful dress for Madame Tussauds London, has put me in the favours as one of the most important women in Ru’s life. What an honour. I’m so excited for the world to see how gorgeous this is”.\n\nRuPaul’s dazzling figure launches in the attraction’s new Fashion Runway experience, opening as London Fashion Week celebrates 40 momentous years. This is RuPaul’s fourth figure across Madame Tussauds globally, and marks Madame Tussaud London’s first figure in drag.\n\nIn true glamazon fashion, the statuesque figure is dressed in a bespoke look created by Ru’s long-term collaborator and go-to designer, Zaldy. Responsible for the incredible looks RuPaul serves on every Drag Race episode, Zaldy took inspiration from British Royal fashion to design the exclusive look for the figure. The dress’s silhouette nods to Royal sashes, while the embellished ‘R’ earrings put a modern twist on one of the most recognised items of jewellery worn by a British monarch, Anne Boleyn’s famous ‘B’ initial pearl necklace. The look is completed with a set of Royal Orders, featuring Zaldy’s selection of the three most iconic women in RuPaul’s life: Michelle Visage, Diana Ross and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nOn creating the exclusive dress for Madame Tussaud London’s RuPaul figure, fashion and costume designer Zaldy Goco said, “I was delighted with the chance to create RuPaul’s exclusive dress for Madame Tussauds London. Straight away, my thought process was that it should be in true style to how we produce RuPaul’s outfits for Drag Race. I wanted it to be an authentic representation of what Ru wears, to make it this glamorous statement, and make it big. Each piece I do with Ru is built for a moment, it’s permanent and resonates with the person. This bespoke creation for Madame Tussauds London, for Ru, and for the fashion zone, is full of all the emotions that you feel when working with Ru: fun, joy and happiness.”\n\nMadame Tussauds London’s Studio Manager, Jo Kinsey, speaking on the figure’s arrival said, “It feels fitting that the original Queen of Drag should arrive at the original Madame Tussauds here in London. RuPaul stands for being fearlessly fabulous and their culture-defining show, Drag Race, preaches an important message of authenticity, expression and unity to millions of people from all walks of life across the globe.\n\n“It’s been a privilege to work with Zaldy on this simply gorgeous design that truly captures RuPaul’s style with a fun play on British royal themes, to create a look that can only be seen at Madame Tussauds London. We adore Queens supporting Queens, so Michelle Visage was the perfect judge to give the figure its final seal of approval before it launches to fans. Michelle has supported Ru on each step of their iconic journey, and it’s been wonderful to have her join us in our celebration of the daring, courageous and fierce Queen of Drag.”"
