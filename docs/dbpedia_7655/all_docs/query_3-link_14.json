        "text": "Meet different types of drag artists and learn about their signature features!\n\nSince drag is a multi-disciplinary performance art form - the artist's unique signature is his character and charisma. ‚ú® The second most important distinction among drag performers is their performance style - the type of Queen they represent. üòé\n\nDrag is not just about makeup, wig, or dressing. It‚Äôs about performing, and it‚Äôs about art. The art of illusion, shapeshifting and genderbending transformation. It‚Äôs a fabulous voice that needs to be heard and seen. To be experienced, in a word.\n\nNow, even if you look through binary gender eyes, you can see so many different ways to be feminine or masculine. Some are soft, some are catty, some are quiet, and others are loud extroverts. And when Drag Queens wanted to show off, there were exciting choices to choose from, and pick one that best suited their persona.\n\nBack in the day, Drag Queens could only be seen in unique places and on special occasions. Praise the Lord, we‚Äôve finally reached the point to appreciate their contribution to the world. As time passed, a few styles were singled out as often chosen and popular. So, what are all the different types of drag out there?\n\n1. Fish Queen\n\nFish queens enjoy looking as close to a traditionally perceived female as possible. They are very feminine and sophisticated Queens - which is why you might find them to sometimes be judgy to other types of Queens that do not represent them.\n\n2. Club Queen\n\nThe NYC club scene back in the 80s and 90s was so colorful and inspiring it has its own followers. A club queen doesn‚Äôt need a contest to slay with bold fashion choices and unique makeup styles. As expected, many of them are inspired by music icons, from Club Kids to Boy George. Some look so amazing! Their fabulousness is chargeable, as they get paid to simply ‚Äì hang around in the club.\n\n3. Goth Queen\n\nBlack is not the favorite color of goth queens; it‚Äôs their only color (it‚Äôs their The color). Ok, they‚Äôll throw in a shade of grey and red lips on a special occasion. Goth Queens chose dark-themed makeup that stands out on white-painted face to complement the gloomy appearances we often see in old horror movies.\n\n4. Pageant Queen\n\nMaybe some toddlers had issues with tiaras, but for pageant queens, it‚Äôs a lifestyle. They are very committed to drag, as they invest much time and resources to nail every aspect of their appearance. Gowns, jewelry, and capes are everyday accessories for a Pageant Queen, as they upscale Fish style drag with big looks and even bigger hair.\n\n5. Faux Queen\n\nFaux Queen sounds like pleonasm to the uneducated but let's face it - many biological women enjoy Drag Queen aesthetic. Also known as Hyper Queens or Diva Queens, female drag performers can often be seen playing gender norms and gender roles at drag shows. Even with that rude and narrow definition of drag as ‚Äúfemale impersonation,‚Äù why couldn‚Äôt a woman express another woman's persona inside her? Because let's face it again, there is rarely only one.\n\n6. Androgyny or Genderfuck Queen\n\nArtistic in nature, an androgyny/genderfuck is a Drag Queen that mixes masculine and feminine characteristics. They are blurring the lines between gender boundaries in their performances, causing some to call them anti-queens‚Ä¶ as if they‚Äôll stop them!\n\n7. Comedy or Camp Queen\n\nCamp queens might be having the most fun! They are the best party guests as they keep everyone entertained and up on their feet with viciously honest comments wrapped in some damn-good humor. Comedy queens do not hide their ethics; they nurture exaggeration and satire along with screaming, clown-inspired looks.\n\n8. Transdrag Queen\n\nQueens that are on their transitioning way from male to female and still performing in drag shows are known as Transdrag Queens. Some choose to go all the way, and others opt for breast implants and esthetic surgery to enhance their accomplishment. Most of them present as women in their daily lives. And at night, they glam up and become even more gorgeous.\n\n9. Tranimal Queen\n\nA tranimal (aka a terrorist drag) queens are eccentric and engaged with social issues, punk rock, and performance art. They are ‚Äúthe messiest‚Äù kind of Drag Queens. They can be seen in shabby clothes and wigs, not necessarily shaved, depicting their animalistic persona. Their focus is not only to make you look but also to make you think and question things. These queens are known for a relentless push and pull between gender boundaries.\n\n10. Activessle Queen\n\nThe LGBT community needs all the help they can get, and activessle Drag Queens took it upon themselves to unite for a charitable act. They raise funds to support the cause and make lives better. Not all activessles are LGBT-focused since basic civil rights are there for all!\n\n11. Mother Queen or Queen Mamas\n\nSomewhere between a small cult leader and a kindergarten teacher lives Queen Mama. They are community superstars and do not need to perform anymore ‚Äì only if it pleases them. They‚Äôve proved their value long ago and now have a bunch of children to guide them on the appropriate ethics of the scene. Always there to assist with a hairstyle tip or a pair of shoes that just completes the outfit.\n\n12. Baby Queen\n\nWith beginners‚Äô enthusiasm in their eyes, Baby Drags stay near their Drag Mama. There is much to learn: from makeup to outfits, stage tricks, and sass. Sometimes they will have brilliant fresh moments as they are not too much in the game yet. Always keeping an eye on Baby Queens is good advice!\n\n13. Drag King\n\nNot all drag artists wear dresses! This is why we're adding Drag Kings to the list! Drag Kings are into boosting masculine features by experimenting with symbols of aggression and authority. And just like men, they love to compete.\n\nAnd more...\n\nOver the years, just like in any art - many niches and creative directions appeared in drag. We covered only the most prominent 13, but there are many, many more and this is why there's a perfect type of drag for anyone and everyone! ü•≥\n\nBut that's a story for another day. üòâ\n\nKeep shining bright,"
