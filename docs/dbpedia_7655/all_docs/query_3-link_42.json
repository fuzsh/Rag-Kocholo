        "text": "In 2024 so far, we’ve had 10 Asian drag performers on our television screens, including two winners—Taiwanese drag queen, Nymphia Wind, who won season 16 of RuPaul’s Drag Race, and Chinese drag performer, Niohuru X, who won season 5 of The Boulet Brothers’ Dragula.\n\nAlso included in that group of 10 are three queens that made it to the top four: Aurora Matrix of Canada’s Drag Race, Marina Summers of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK vs The World and Plastique Tiara of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars. Melinda Verga and Kiki Coe of Canada’s Drag Race, Keta Minaj of RuPaul's Drag Race UK vs The World, Le Fil of Canada’s Drag Race vs The World, and Madame Yoko of Drag Race Belgique round out the list, with all their slaysian prowess placing fifth through eighth.\n\nHowever, we’re just getting started, as we’ll be seeing even more Asian drag artists on television this year with Drag Race Philippines season three airing on Aug. 7, and Drag Race Thailand season three slated to air in late 2024.\n\nWith this golden era of Asian drag representation packed with winners, robbed queens, fan favorites and trailblazers on our television screens, it may be hard to imagine how it can get any better than this—but it can.\n\nBackstage at the Made In Asia drag festival in West Hollywood, California, last month, we chatted with a number of fan-favorite Asian drag performers from Drag Race franchises across the world, as well as incredible performers in Southern California’s drag scene, about how being Asian has influenced their drag and what they hope to see next.\n\nAurora Matrix of Canada’s Drag Race, season four\n\nAurora Matrix was a finalist on Canada’s Drag Race season four who constantly brought her culture to the runway. From the time she walked into the werkroom with an outfit inspired by the Terracotta Army of Ancient China’s Qin Dynasty to the finale episode where she dressed in an ornate empress gown, Aurora had gotten two challenge wins and a reputation as one of her season’s lip sync assassins—ultimately showcasing that Asian drag is a force to be reckoned with.\n\n“I have so much culture mixed into my drag. Even in my package on Canada’s Drag Race, so many of my looks had so much inspiration from my culture and what I learned from my parents. It’s my way of honoring them and giving a nod to them, even if no one else knows the reference. It’s for me and I love that!\n\nI would love to hear even more stories and life experiences of Asians in drag. No matter how niche and specific it is, I’m sure there is someone out there who would love to hear someone else’s advice, or their experiences on what they have gone through. It’s so helpful and it’s something I’ve always wanted growing up, and now I’m being put in a position where I can share my experiences and people can learn something from it. And that’s my purpose in life, and my purpose in drag, is to share that.”\n\nJoella\n\nIf you ask anyone in the Los Angeles queer scene to name their favorite Asian drag queen, you’ll hear them say this queen’s name. Joella is a Chinese American drag queen based in Southern California who is known for her high energy numbers at every show. From taking the stage with Jojo Siwa and Katy Perry to starring in a music video with Baby Tate, she’s a superstar on the rise and a pivotal figure in the Los Angeles Asian drag scene.\n\n“My whole life, it’s been a hard time for me to embrace my culture. I grew up in a very white-washed society that made me feel ashamed for being Asian, and recently, I’ve been more proud of where I am from and I have been embracing it much more. Being Asian makes me feel so much more powerful and I’m so happy about that.\n\nI feel like right now we’re in the era, the dynasty, of Asian drag excellence. Look at all the winners of these TV shows! It’s all these Asian girls. They’re going viral, they’re all doing good! So I’m hoping to see more slaysian divas on television taking over the world soon.”\n\nMatilduh of Drag Race Philippines, season two\n\nMatilduh captivated fans on the second season of Drag Race Philippines with her big energy, winning three mini challenges in her season as the self-titled “Mini Challenge Slayer.” It’s hard not to be enamored when watching Matilduh perform with the way she commands a stage, leaving every person who watched her overcome with the power of Filipino drag excellence.\n\n“Filipinos are world class, mama! Having inspirations and standards so high pressures me to do better every time I perform and go on stage. Also, Filipinos have lots of love, and I love my work and it just inspires me to push even harder every time.”\n\nMinty Fresh of Drag Race Philippines, season one\n\nMinty Fresh made her mark on season one of Drag Race Philippines, winning both the talent show and the fashion ball challenges. On many fans' wish lists for a future All Stars season, she’s a breakout star from her franchise who stuns with her beauty and talent, strutting onto every stage with the confidence and aura of a supermodel fresh off the runway.\n\n“Being Filipino inspires me a lot. Filipinos are known for being very hardworking, and it’s the same in the drag scene in the Philippines. And the drag scene in the Philippines is also very colorful, actually, and it’s really inspiring to me as well and it makes me a really hard worker.”\n\nMiss Shu Mai\n\nMiss Shu Mai is a Taiwanese drag queen who is a staple in the Los Angeles drag scene and a pivotal figure in creating community spaces for queer Asian people. Miss Shu Mai co-produces a party called Send Noodz, which is LA’s only monthly Asian drag show. As a trained dancer, you can always expect a Miss Shu Mai number to include a reference of Asian culture complete with a dance break like none other.\n\n“My drag is a love letter to my Asian American experience. Performing things that are near and dear to my experience, things that make me feel seen as an Asian femme, it makes me feel validated. I hope that it resonates with people and allows people to feel at home with me as a performer.\n\nI hope to see that we get paid more, that we unionize because it’s very hard out here, and I hope to see that Asian drag continues to have spaces to celebrate Asian drag—but not out of necessity but from celebration!”\n\nØV Cünt of Drag Race Philippines, season two\n\nØV Cünt is the enigmatic provocateur of season two of Drag Race Philippines. Known for her fierce one-liners and her drag style that is one of the future, ØV Cünt is a standout from her franchise. Her elimination on her season shocked fans considering she had won one challenge and placed high in the majority of her season before she was sent home. The show however was just the first step for this global superstar.\n\n“I love referencing in my fashion some traditional Filipino things. Other than the fashions though, there’s something about Tagalog songs that gives me more emotion, that gives more punch to it, especially when you perform love songs or songs about heartbreak. Mama, I’d be crying! [Laughs] There’s something about Filipino drag and our authenticity of emotion while performing.”\n\nShia Ho\n\nShia Ho is a Japanese American drag queen based in New York City and is the founder of Made in Asia Festival. She is a leading figure in creating Asian community spaces on the East Coast, producing Asian drag showcases like Club East and SaSHEmi. No stranger to the stage or mic, Shia Ho is a shining example of how powerful Asian drag can be for the community.\n\n“As a Japanese American, I try to marry my Japanese and American background into my drag. Whether that is creating and/or wearing outfits influenced by Japanese silhouettes and design or performing songs by Japanese artists.\n\nMy hope is to see more Asian drag represented in the mainstream! I want to see more Asian drag artists headline venues and events without having to suppress our Asian culture in order to assimilate to American/Eurocentric ‘norms.’\n\nI believe there should be more spaces for queer Asian art. For a long time, we’ve seen a lack of Asian representation in drag shows and when we are being booked we are tokenized and used to meet some kind of diversity hire or to fulfill a specific ‘role’ in shows. I founded Made in Asia to showcase and celebrate the diversity of queer Asian drag. I wanted to create a space for queer API folks to display their art without any boundaries or expectations and a place for local and global Asian artists to share the same space and celebrate Asian excellence.”\n\nSkirt Cocaine\n\nSkirt Cocaine is a Filipino drag king based in Los Angeles. They embody what it means to use drag as an artform of cultural resistance, unafraid to use Pinoy Pop (P-Pop) songs in their numbers that can serve as a catalyst of knowledge for both themselves and the audience watching. Skirt is an important part of the Asian drag community in Los Angeles, especially as the trailblazing figure they are for Asian drag kings, always pushing and encouraging for more drag kings to enter the scene.\n\n“My Filipino culture inspires my drag. I try to do songs that are either in Tagalog or have a significance to Filipino American culture and the thing that I found surprising is that every time I do, I discover something new about my culture that I wouldn't have known before I delved into the performance aspect. So, I end up learning either the history of the song, or the artist, or the cultural story behind the song. The culture informs me. It’s integral to my drag now. So, perform more cultural music, drag performers!"
