        "text": "After ten seasons of the now herstory-making RuPaul’s Drag Race, four All Stars seasons, as well as one recent holiday flop-a-thon, Drag Race is crossing the pond for a second time after it’s first overseas version: Drag Race Thailand.\n\nNews came earlier this month straight from Mutha’s mouth that RuPaul’s Drag Race UK is in development and currently casting its first season, which leaves all of us queers wondering: which UK queens will we see on the runway and kiki-ing in the workroom?\n\nIf you’re hoping that Drag Race UK stands to be a whole lot more inclusive than it has been the last ten seasons, you’re not alone. After the backlash Ru faced for his comments regarding trans exclusion, he hopefully got the memo that drag is not just something enjoyed and performed by cis men. In fact, if you’ve been following Sasha Velour’s smart ass or know your proper drag herstory, you know that there is more to drag than what we see on Drag Race, even if it did bring the art form to a mainstream audience.\n\nRegardless, a new season of Drag Race is my even-gayer Oscar season, and I’m giddy at the thought of an entirely new round of non-American queens. Can you imagine the Scottish reading that might go on? The tea and the t that will be inevitably spilt? The reckless abandon at which c--nt will be thrown around? God save these prospective queens and kings.\n\nFreida Slaves (@freidaslaves)\n\nNot seeing TAYCE on Drag Race this season seems close to impossible. The London (originally Welsh) queen has been sweeping the balls. Inspired by Grace Jones, Disney villains, and Prince, TAYCE has the lewks the judges are looking for and the drama and drive to put her easily into the top six, if not higher.\n\n*Honorable mention for her drag sister and fellow performer, Cara Melle (an American queen based in London) who could just join her this season as a way for producers to create a fierce team of allies, or to turn one on the other (it will never be RuPaul’s Best Friends Race). Let’s hope it’s the latter.\n\nChiyo Gomes (@chiyogomes)\n\nWe need a big girl to win this thing. The children are thirsty for it. Lewis G. Burton, a performance artist and dj drag queen who is serving us “Divine as your mom in the murder house of American Horror Story before throwing a deep house techno party in the basement” fantasy could bring us the horror we haven’t seen since Sharon Needles.\n\n*Honorable mention for horror queens would be the fabulous Felix Le Freak, who in addition to her horror-inspired looks (and other less horrific ones) is a comedy queen and original songwriter, as well as the absolutely terrifying and innovative Charity Kase. The looks she creates are actually works of art.\n\nMeth (@methedragqueen)\n\nIt might be preemptive, but Rujazzle has what it takes not just to be a successful queen, but an iconic one. Based in Glasgow, she would be the thrower of the Scottish shade we so need in the workroom. No one insults better than the Scottish. That’s not to say she doesn’t seem nice. Quite the contrary. With a degree in art history, Rujazzle’s latest masterpiece was recreating herself as exemplary classical paintings. The photo series was aptly titled, “28 Days of Art Herstory.”\n\nWe’ll be waiting with bated breath for the lineup of queens that exemplify Charisma Uniqueness Nerve and Talent and a full English attitude. They’ll just have to remember one more thing: don’t fuck it up.\n\n—\n\nDakota is a poet, journalist, and right in the damn center of the Kinsey scale. Follow her on Twitter: @Likethestates."
