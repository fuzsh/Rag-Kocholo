        "text": "Drag is high art, and to be a successful drag artist is to be a true renaissance artist, toggling adeptly between singer, writer, actor, dancer, comedian, fashion designer, make-up artist, master marketer, and show-person. For the past 12 seasons, RuPaul’s Drag Race has drawn a global spotlight to this art form, turning what was once considered by some to be subversive nightclub entertainment into a juggernaut of an industry, counting women among its biggest fans.\n\nPerhaps it has something to do with how drag is such a powerful representation of femininity with a wink and some humor. Speaking of which, Michelle Visage, RuPaul’s best friend and female co-host on Drag Race, is a defining presence and perspective — and she recently told Logo she identifies as a drag queen.\n\nDrag is such a powerful representation of femininity with a wink and some humor.\n\nRecent episodes of Secret Celebrity Drag Race and We’re Here, an HBO show where three Drag Race alums travel across middle America to forge connections with both isolated LGBTQ+ citizens and their conservative neighbors, gave women a taste of the true drag experience. It’s a concept RuPaul has entertained before. Ten years ago, RuPaul’s Drag U set out to give cis women drag makeovers.\n\n“RuPaul’s Drag Race has given access to people who don’t have a local drag bar or don’t know any queer people — now they’ve seen drag in their living room for three-and-a-half hours every Friday night,” says Monét X Change, a Drag Race alum, Drag Race All Stars winner, actor and singer. “Because more people are seeing what it’s really about, and discovering that it’s not this scary thing that only happens after midnight in seedy clubs in New York City. They’re seeing that drag is a viable, beautiful art form. Biological women are seeing that, it’s percolating their curiosity, and they’re diving into drag.”\n\nX Change says, in her experience, having women on the show helps promote tolerance among heteronormative people. “When they see black women like Vanessa Williams and Loni Love embrace drag culture, it speaks volumes. I think that’s how we promote change, and change minds and hearts,” she says. After all, as RuPaul says on Secret Celebrity Drag Race, “Drag doesn’t change who you are, it actually reveals who you are.”\n\n“To do drag requires a willingness, or even a desire, to challenge gender norms, challenge the patriarchy, look like a fool in a dress and a wig, potentially fail, and embrace the LGBT community,” says Peppermint, an actress, singer, trans female drag performer, and former contestant on Drag Race, who went on to star in Head Over Heels on Broadway. “Every celebrity is not made to do all those things. There’s only a few who can and I think most of those people are women.”\n\nWomen have always revered and connected with drag, says Peppermint: “I remember working at Lips (a New York City drag-themed restaurant) and women were our main clientele.” She says it’s only natural for female-identifying fans of drag to imagine having a drag experience themselves. “If most of your audience, and most of the consumers, and most of the people showing up to purchase your album, and who are tuning in to see your show, or flying across the country to go to Drag Con and get your autograph are women, eventually, they’re going to start emulating the people they admire,” says Peppermint.\n\nTwenty-plus years ago, drag was considered a sacred space where queer men played with gender norms. No matter how much a woman might worship the world of drag, they were largely content to remain fans, or labeled as burlesque performers or “club kids.”\n\n“Certainly, in the early '90s New York East Village scene, where I started, it was gay men,” says Sherry Vine, an actress, musician, and legendary drag queen with over 30 years in the business. “Drag was kind of defined as gay men wearing women’s clothing for entertainment purposes. You weren’t a cross dresser, you weren’t trans, you were identified as a gay man who did this for entertainment. We weren’t running around dressing up at home and it wasn’t secretly wearing lacy underwear at work like a cross dresser. The lines were bold, and you drew within the lines.”\n\nToday, the lines are slowly starting to blur, with bio-queens (like Crème Fatale, Crimson Kitty and Vicky DeVille ) making names for themselves. “Because it involves makeup, and feathers and sequins, people tend to forget that drag itself is a political statement,” X Change says. “When you step out of your apartment in the Bronx, or in Hell’s Kitchen, or Tulsa, Oklahoma in drag, you’re saying f—k the patriarchy and gender norms. Drag is innately political. When bio-queens do drag, even though they are women, by getting in drag they’re making that statement.”\n\nCould a bio-queen be cast on Drag Race one day? It remains to be seen, but these forays into female participation could be perceived as encouraging. In a 2018 interview with The Guardian, RuPaul answered this question by saying, “Drag loses its sense of danger and its sense of irony once it’s not men doing it, because at its core it’s a social statement and a big f-you to male-dominated culture.” When asked if he would accept a transitioning contestant (Peppermint revealed she was trans on the show), he said: “You can identify as a woman and say you’re transitioning, but it changes once you start changing your body. It takes on a different thing; it changes the whole concept of what we’re doing.” (Peppermint had gender-affirming surgery after the show).\n\nYet, in the 1990s pageant scene where she came up, Peppermint says the winners and finalists were most often trans women. “If there were 10 queens at a club, one always had some kind of surgical enhancement,” she explains. “But how she talked about herself might be different than how she talked about herself today. She would say, ‘I’m a man with breast implants’ under the guise of sacrificing her body for the art form of drag. ‘I’ll get my nose, and cheek implants and hips done.’ Girl, you know you’re very happy that you had all that stuff done!”\n\nPeppermint seems encouraged by the increased visibility of women on Drag Race. “I think it was a coincidence, but I’m hopeful it’s a coincidence we can take advantage of and use as evidence to say, ‘See? This is good.’ But we’ll have to wait and see. I think the fan base is probably very happy about it,” she says.\n\nX Change is also hopeful. “Hopefully, we’ll have some [women] on the show soon. I think that women are just discovering, especially in the makeover episodes, if it can allow a man to tap into his femininity and lend himself to the experience, I think bio-women are like, 'Hey, I can have that same journey and result, too.' When they put on drag, they realize that drag is not just something for men. It’s something anyone can use to kind of transform and tap into something within themselves.”\n\n“I don’t know if we’ll ever see a bio-queen on Drag Race,’” says Vine. “I felt like with Drag U and We’re Here, none of those people are going to pursue a career performing in drag. It’s more like a makeover — let’s play dress up and have fun. Maybe Celebrity Drag Race is kind of their way of opening that up a little bit.”\n\nIn drag, especially with the girls in your club scene or in your community, you build a family bond.\n\nRegardless of who performs or where, Vine says they better be good. “Just because you can paint your face and it looks gorgeous doesn’t mean you can do an hour show,” says Vine. “A costume change is not an act. If you are good and you’re entertaining, I don’t care how you identify. I’d rather see a really talented, amazing bio-queen on stage who is giving it to me than a gay man in a wig who is not.”\n\nThat said, when entering into a new space, it helps to lead with respect. “When you’re a bio-queen, you’re not just showing up to the club in drag, doing a number in drag, then peace out and leave. In drag, especially with the girls in your club scene or in your community, you build a family bond,” says X Change. “We go to clubs together, stay there all night until 4 o’clock in the morning and go to the same diner and eat together. These are queens who eat, sleep and breathe the same air as us. They’re coming to the club and paying their dues and doing the same thing just like any other queen.”\n\nAfter all, as RuPaul says, “You’re born naked and the rest is drag.” And, regardless of the gender we’re assigned at birth, we all put our lashes on one eye at a time.\n\nVivian Manning-Schaffel is a multifaceted storyteller whose work has been featured in The Cut, NBC News BETTER, Time Out New York, Medium and The Week.
