        "text": "As his song Freaky Money goes, “All up in the club, I’m making money. Even when I sleep, I’m making money.” And he wasn’t joking!\n\nHere’s how Ru makes and spends his cash.\n\nEntertainment mogul\n\nRu might be a commercial success now, but much like the queens on his show, he had to hustle his way to the top with hard work, determination and a whole lot of contouring make-up.\n\nStarting off in music, RuPaul recorded the dance/house album “Supermodel of the World” in 1993 and has since released numerous records, including 2011’s “Glamazon” and 2016’s “Butch Queen” (expect more autotune than lip-synching).\n\nIn 1996 Ru made his TV debut with his own talk show on VH1, The RuPaul Show, before finally launching RuPaul’s Drag Race in 2009.\n\nIn 2013, TV Guide reported that Ru was earning US$50,000 per episode of Drag Race and, considering the show is currently on it’s 13th and most successful season yet, that pay cheque has undoubtedly been significantly increased since.\n\nFracking and farming\n\nGeorges LeBar has been married to Ru since 1994, sticking with him through thick and thin. But you’d be forgiven for not knowing about him, because throughout the years he’s opted to remain out of the spotlight, running their ranch in Wyoming instead.\n\nThe couple recently raised eyebrows when Ru admitted in an interview with NPR’s Fresh Air that he leases the mineral and water rights of his 60,000-acre (28,300-hectare) Wyoming ranch to oil companies. In short, fracking.\n\nFracking is defined by the Oxford dictionary as “the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into subterranean rocks, boreholes, etc so as to force open existing fissures and extract oil or gas”. The practice is known for damaging surrounding areas where the waste from the sites are dumped. And as you can imagine, it’s a hotly debated environmental and political issue.\n\n“Well, a modern ranch, 21st-century ranch, is really land management,” RuPaul told Fresh Air. “You lease the mineral rights to oil companies and you sell water to oil companies. And then you lease the grazing rights to different ranchers.”\n\nA brand new home in 90210\n\nThe European mansion has six bedrooms and eight bathrooms, according to its listing. It also boasts a formal dining room, high-ceilinged living rooms, fireplaces and French parquet floors.\n\nOf course, the master bedroom is fit for a kween with an outdoor terrace, and downstairs rooms include a media room, a wine cellar, a gym and a four-car garage. Imagine the opulence, gurl!\n\nProperty investor\n\nA farm and a mansion aren’t the only properties under Ru’s sparkly belt. Since the start of his career he has owned a flat in New York that he bought for US$350,000 back in the early 90s. In 2007, he added a West Hollywood condo to his property portfolio for around US$600,000.\n\nIt’s turned out to be a rather lucrative exercise. Before purchasing his Beverly Hills mansion, Ru put on the market a home he bought for US$2.5 million for twice its original value.\n\nAnd, of course, couture!\n\nWhat is a successful drag queen without a wardrobe of designer outfits?\n\nWhen asked by Money.com how much he has spent on designer gowns for his show, Ru admitted he is willing to drop US$10,000 on a gown, but doesn’t keep count.\n\n“Oh, I don’t know. I’ve lost count. Our show has been on the air for 10 years, and there are – I don’t know – 14 gowns per season? So … [a lot].”"
