        "text": "So who are the wealthiest queens to have ever shantayed (and sashayed) down the show’s famous catwalk? Here are five of them …\n\n1. Trixie Mattel: US$10 million\n\nWhen it comes to capitalising on the show’s potential for prosperity, no queen can top Trixie Mattel. Besides winning over the fandom with her natural charm and quick-witted humour, Mattel has seized opportunities with idiosyncratic style and iconic make-up.\n\nFrom launching a music career to starring in TV shows and bagging endorsement deals, Mattel has seen her personal wealth skyrocket to an estimated US$10 million.\n\nIn addition to these revenue-boosting endeavours, the All Stars 3 champion founded her own cosmetics company. Mattel has done so well for herself that she recently saved the oldest gay bar in Milwaukee, This Is It!, from shutting down and is now its co-owner.\n\n2. Courtney Act: US$5 million\n\nLong before there was Drag Race Down Under (the Australian/New Zealand version of the show currently on air) there was Courtney Act. Thanks to her impressive vocals on Australian Idol, the drag queen from down under had already attained a certain degree of popularity and success before entering the season six Werk Room.\n\nSince her Drag Race journey ended, Act has been very busy. From being part of the American Apparel Ad Girls campaign to starring in sold out shows and tours around the world, Act has racked up a reported US$5 million. She also went on to win Celebrity Big Brother UK and scored a gig hosting the UK’s first bisexual reality dating show, The Bi Life.\n\n3. Bianca Del Rio: US$4 million\n\nAnother season six veteran and the ultimate winner of that year’s race, Bianca Del Rio is often considered one of the franchise’s all-time favourites – and funniest.\n\nThe comedic genius has made the most of her time on the show … and an estimated US$4 million. She’s toured the world with a string of successful sold out comedy shows performing wherever drag race fans congregate, from South Africa to Singapore.\n\nShe’s also published her own book and appeared in a West End musical, Everybody’s Talking About Jamie.\n\n4. Alyssa Edwards: US$3 million\n\nAnother fan favourite who’s enjoyed glitzy success after appearing on the show is dancing diva Alyssa Edwards.\n\nBesides being the drag mother to an impressive line-up of queens, including the show’s former contestants Shangela, Laganja Estranja and Plastique Tiara, Edwards is the buoyant boss and outspoken owner of Beyond Belief Dance Company.\n\nShe has also starred in her own Netflix docuseries Dancing Queen and snagged some snazzy sponsorship deals.\n\n5. Raven: US$2 million\n\nFamous for coming in second place not once but twice (on season two and in the first instalment of All Stars) Raven has gone on to be one of the most successful and popular queens to ever enter and leave the Werk Room.\n\nLanding the job of RuPaul’s personal make-up artist has translated to big earnings for this fan favourite queen – and now she’s slated to host her own upcoming competition show."
