        "text": "Two drag queens from Upstate New York are coming back to reality TV on “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars.”\n\nDarienne Lake and Mrs. Kasha Davis, who are both from the Rochester area, will appear on “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars 8″ along with ten other returning cast members. Lake was best known for her lip-sync skills on season 6 of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and Davis appeared on season 7.\n\nLake and Davis may be facing each other for Mama Ru’s “AS8″ crown, but are longtime friends and collaborators. They’ve co-starred in the stage show “Bosom Buddies” and perform together frequently in Rochester with Pandora Boxx; all three were named among the 100 most powerful drag queens in America by New York Magazine.\n\n“Darienne Lake” is the stage name of Gregory Meyer, who was born in Long Island and moved to Rochester at age 11. The name is partly inspired by talk show host and “Hairspray” star Ricki Lake, but also the popular Darien Lake amusement park near Buffalo. Darienne Lake released a standup comedy special this month as part of a new collaboration between “RuPaul’s Drag Race” alumni, Comedy Dynamics and Tribeca.\n\n“Mrs. Kasha Davis” is the stage name of Edward P. Popil, Jr., who grew up in Scranton but is now based in Rochester. “MKD” has performed globally as the self-proclaimed International Celebrity Housewife and appeared in films like “Hurricane Bianca: From Russia with Hate” and “Workhorse Queen.” More recently she’s focused on drag queen story hour events through “Imagination Station.”\n\n“What we are expressing when we are doing our story hour is that word: Kindness. Treat yourself with kindness and if you happen to see somebody else different in the world, treat them with kindness,” Davis told Spectrum News earlier this month. “Drag is not a crime... Some of my fashion choices are criminal, but that’s a whole other story.”\n\nSeason 8 of “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars” will also feature Alexis Michelle (season 9), Heidi N Closet (season 12), Jaymes Mansfield (season 9), Jimbo (”Canada’s Drag Race”), Kahanna Montrese (season 11), Kandy Muse (season 13), Lala Ri (season 13), Monica Beverly Hillz (season 5), Jessica Wild (season 2, “All Stars 6″) and Miss Continental winner Naysha Lopez (season 8).\n\nThe winner will receive a $200,000 prize and bragging rights.\n\n“RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars” season 8 will premiere May 12 on Paramount+."
