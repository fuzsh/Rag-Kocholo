        "text": "By Elaina Patton, Jillian Eugenios, Ellie Rudy, Brooke Sopelsa and Jay Valle\n\nJune 1, 2023\n\nNow that the centuries-old art of drag has become a preferred target in the current culture warfare, we chose to dedicate this yearâs annual NBC Out Pride 30 list to the performers who have put this art form on the map.\n\nFrom a formerly enslaved person who first donned drag in the late 1800s to the stars of âRuPaulâs Drag Race,â this performance art â typically characterized by gender impersonation and exaggerated forms of gender expression â has a long and lasting legacy. It also has undeniably strong ties to the LGBTQ community, with the lionâs share of drag queens and kings identifying as part of the community.\n\nWhile drag is not new, what is new is the tidal wave of state legislation seeking to restrict where and in front of whom drag shows can be performed. So far this year, lawmakers in at least 16 states have introduced such measures, with the governors of Tennessee, Florida and Montana signing bills intended to restrict drag performances.\n\nWithout further ado, here are 30 drag performers who have had the most impact on the glamorous and increasingly controversial art form.\n\nPrincess Seraphina (1700s)\n\nAlthough she predated the modern usage of the term \"drag,\" which is said to be a product of late-19th century British theater, Princess Seraphina is widely regarded as the first English drag queen. The female persona of 18th-century Englishman John Cooper, Princess Seraphina dared to roam the streets of London when homosexuality was a capital offense. And she was reportedly as familiar to her neighbors as she was to the regulars of the underground bars and clubs known as molly houses, which hosted London's thriving gay subculture of the 1700s. Much of what is known about Princess Seraphina comes from court records from a remarkable trial in which Cooper â who exposed himself to legal scrutiny amid the era's \"sodomy laws\" â brought charges against a man who robbed him at knife-point and threatened to expose his sexuality.\n\nMadam Pattirini (1854-1931)\n\nMadam Pattirini (above), the drag alter ego of Brigham Morris Young, was one of the 57 children of Brigham Young, the founder of Salt Lake City, Utah, and the second president of the the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (commonly known as the Mormon church). An article published in 1901 in the Deseret News, the paper owned by the LDS church, noted that Morris Young performed in drag as Madam Pattirini, an âItalian prima donna,â at the birthday celebration of the churchâs then-president, Lorenzo Snow. The article said Morris Young showed himself to be a âprime entertainerâ and praised him for his âgood falsetto voice and the ability to sustain a female character.â For those looking to honor Morris Youngâs most well-known act, a Utah distiller introduced a gin named after the drag diva in 2017.\n\nWilliam Dorsey Swann (1860-1925)\n\nWilliam Dorsey Swann, who was born into slavery in Georgia, went on to make history as the first self-identified drag queen and the first American activist to lead a queer resistance group, according to historian Channing Joseph. On New Yearâs Day in 1896, Swann was charged in Washington, D.C., with âkeeping a disorderly house,â which was typically a euphemism for running a brothel. But what he was actually running, according to newspaper accounts at the time, was a drag ball (or, as the judge characterized it, a âhell of iniquityâ). Swann, who had previously been arrested for âfemale impersonation,â was quickly convicted and sentenced to 10 months in jail. Swann requested a pardon from President Grover Cleveland, and, while the request was denied, it was reportedly the first time an American used legal and political action to fight for the right of LGBTQ people to gather.\n\nJulian Eltinge (1880s-1941)\n\nJulian Eltinge was the âking of (drag) queensâ in his day, and his fame as a female impersonator ârivaled that of superstar performer RuPaulâs status today,â according to a biography of Eltinge published on the Los Angeles Public Libraryâs website. He reportedly started performing drag at saloons in Montana as a teenager before finding his way to the vaudeville circuit, Broadway and, eventually, Hollywood. In 1912, the Eltinge Theater on New Yorkâs iconic 42nd Street was named in his honor, and during this time he was said to be one of the highest-paid actors in America. His drag performances were known for their convincing portrayals of women, and he would remove his wig at the end of his performances, shocking the audience with the reveal. According to his New York Times obituary, Eltinge performed for King Edward VII of England as a young actor, and the monarch was so impressed that he gifted him a white bulldog.\n\nJulian Eltinge (1880s-1941)\n\nJulian Eltinge was the âking of (drag) queensâ in his day, and his fame as a female impersonator ârivaled that of superstar performer RuPaulâs status today,â according to a biography of Eltinge published on the Los Angeles Public Libraryâs website.

According to his New York Times obituary, Eltinge performed for King Edward VII of England as a young actor, and the monarch was so impressed that he gifted him a white bulldog.\n\nGladys Bentley (1907-1960)\n\nGladys Bentley was a singer, piano player and entertainer who performed in the 1920s and 1930s, in the era that came to be known as the Harlem Renaissance. Bentley was known for her top hat, tailored white tuxedos and risque lyrics. During her heyday, she did not conceal her sexuality but celebrated it, flirting with women in the crowd and incorporating a more masculine identity into her performances. She became one of the best-known Black entertainers of the time, and at the height of her fame she moved from Harlem to Park Avenue and had a team of servants. Bentley left New York in the late 1930s and performed throughout California, most notably at Monaâs 440 Club, the first lesbian bar in San Francisco.\n\nCrystal LaBeija (1930s-1990s)\n\nWhen Crystal LaBeija, a Black drag queen and trans woman, was announced as the third runner-up at the 1967 Miss All-America Camp Beauty Contest, she was having none of it. Before the winner, a white queen named Rachel Harlow, could even be announced, LaBeija stormed off the stage to protest against the competition, which â she and other queens alleged â favored white beauty standards. Frustrated by the apparent racism in drag pageant culture, LaBeija founded her own drag ball exclusively for Black queens in 1972. To promote the event, she and fellow Harlem queen Lottie founded the House of LaBeija, leading other Black and Latina queens to do the same â and thus, ball culture had arrived. For those still doubting LaBeijaâs drag icon status, the queen of queens, RuPaul, revealed in a 2018 New York Times article that the first drag performance she saw was LaBeija singing a Donna Summer song in black fishnets and a bustier.\n\nDorian Corey (1937-1993)\n\nAlthough during her life, Dorian Corey was known as one of the great queens of the Harlem drag balls â as seen in 1968's \"The Queen\" and 1990's \"Paris Is Burning\" â her story became overshadowed by a morbid secret unearthed after her death. Corey moved to New York to study at Parsons School of Design, which led her to a successful career on the city's drag scene and as a member of the touring Pearl Box Revue. After she succumbed to AIDS in 1993, a mummified body was found in her apartment, leading to speculation that she had shot an abusive lover, and had hidden his body for 25 years. While the gruesome discovery shocked those who had known the generous mother of the House of Corey, many also chalked it up to the widespread mistrust of police that pervaded queens' lives throughout the 20th century.\n\nDorian Corey (1937-1993)\n\nAlthough during her life, Dorian Corey was known as one of the great queens of the Harlem drag balls â as seen in 1968's \"The Queen\" and 1990's \"Paris Is Burning\" â her story became overshadowed by a morbid secret unearthed after her death.

Cross-dressing was illegal at the time, and Sabrina â or Jack Doroshow out of makeup â estimated that she had been arrested over 100 times. The most famous pageant she presided over, the 1967 Miss All-America Camp Beauty Pageant in New York City, was documented in the film âThe Queen,â which was screened at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1968 and is regarded as a seminal film of queer culture. After spending much of the 1980s in Europe, Flawless Sabrina returned to New York City, where she spent her final decades holding court in her Upper East Side apartment, hosting salons and displaying the work of young artists, according to her New York Times obituary.\n\nHeklina (1966-2023)\n\nA San Francisco drag icon, Heklina, whose name was inspired by Mount Hekla, one of Icelandâs active volcanoes, has been called âa beaconâ and a legend. She was best known for a long-running drag show she started in 1996 â originally called Trannyshack and then rebranded as Mother â which continued until 2020, though it changed venues several times over the years. A fierce defender of drag, Heklina co-founded Oasis, a San Francisco nightclub that opened in 2015 and is known for its cabaret and drag performances. Remembered as an inspiration to younger drag queens, she was committed to creating safe spaces for expression and was open about both her sobriety and her HIV status. Heklina died while touring âMommie Queerest,â a parody of the 1981 Joan Crawford biopic âMommie Dearest.â She has been described as a âtrailblazing community iconâ who âmade drag what it is today.â\n\nPabllo Vittar (Born 1993)\n\nBrazilian drag star Pabllo Vittar did not become famous by accident. After posting dozens of videos on YouTube and singing at clubs and bars for several years, in hopes of being noticed, she got a break. In 2017, she went viral after singing Whitney Houstonâs âI Have Nothingâ on local television, hitting the high notes with apparent ease. Since then, she has collaborated with A-list musicians such as Fergie, Charli XCX and Diplo, and in 2018, she became the first drag queen to be nominated for a Latin Grammy (or any Grammy, for that matter). She boasts more than 12 million followers on Instagram, the most of any drag queen, even surpassing RuPaul. In short, she is doing the most.\n\nArt Director:\n\nChelsea Stahl\n\nDesigners:\n\nJustine Goode and Leila Register\n\nPhotos courtesy of:\n\nGetty Images, Netflix, Associated Press, Smithsonian Institute, Janus Films, New York Public Library\n\nPabllo Vittar (Born 1993)\n\nBrazilian drag star Pabllo Vittar did not become famous by accident.
