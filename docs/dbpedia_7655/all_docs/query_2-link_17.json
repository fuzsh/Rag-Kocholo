        "text": "RuPaul Andre Charles (1960-), better known as RuPaul, is perhaps the world’s most famous drag queen. RuPaul rose to stardom with the release of his debut single “Supermodel (You Better Work).” In 1996 RuPaul became the first drag queen to work as a spokesperson for a major cosmetics company, M.A.C. Cosmetics. Recently, RuPaul has gained massive success with his reality competition series RuPaul’s Drag Race, which received Primetime Emmy awards in 2016 and 2017. The Grinnell College student group QPOC (Queer People of Color) raises money for charity by hosting their Drag Show biannually.\n\nTo return to the cover image on the home page, click here."
