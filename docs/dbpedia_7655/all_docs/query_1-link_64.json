        "text": "What do drag queens do?\n\n17 things top Drag Queens do.\n\n1. Performing at clubs and events\n\nDrag queens are performers who dress in flamboyant costumes and often exaggerate feminine traits such as makeup and mannerisms.\n\nThey often lip-sync or sing while performing, and they may also dance or do comedy routines. Drag queens typically perform at clubs or events that cater to LGBTQ+ audiences, but they can also be found at mainstream venues such as hotels and nightclubs.\n\nSome drag queens are famous for their outrageous costumes and outrageous personalities, while others are known for their impressive singing or dancing skills. Whatever their style, drag queens add excitement and glamour to any event.\n\n2. Selling merchandise\n\nOne of the things that drag queens do to make money is to sell merchandise. This can include anything from t-shirts to makeup brushes to jewelry. Some products that they use and endorse are hip pads, butt pads and products such as Pals Breast Forms.\n\nAny successful drag queen knows that one of the most important elements of their look is a good set of breast forms. Not only do they help to create the desired silhouette, but they also provide support and shape.\n\nDrag queens have a variety of brands to choose from, but one of the most popular is Pals Breast Forms.\n\nWhat makes Pals Breast Forms so popular with drag queens is the fact that they are so realistic and comfortable. They also come in a variety of sizes to suit every queen.\n\nDrag queens will often set up a table at their shows and invite people to browse their wares. They may also sell merchandise online through their website or social media platforms. Drag queens typically take a percentage of the sale, so the more they sell, the more money they make.\n\nIn addition to making money, selling merchandise also helps to raise awareness of the drag queen's brand and increase their fan base.\n\n3. Creating a more loving world for all!\n\nAt its core, drag is about celebrating individuality and promoting acceptance. By embracing their own uniqueness, drag queens help others to do the same.\n\nIn a world where so much emphasis is placed on conformity, they remind us that it's OK to be different. And when we're confident in who we are, we can achieve anything we set our minds to.\n\nSo the next time you see a drag queen sashaying down the street, remember that she's not just there to look fabulous - she's also there to remind you that you are fabulous too. And together, we can create a more loving world for all.\n\n4. Doing regular day jobs to support their drag career\n\nIn addition to performing, many drag queens also work regular day jobs to support their drag careers. This can include a wide range of different occupations, from waitressing and bartending to graphic design and event planning.\n\nWhile some queens may only work part-time jobs, others may work full-time in their chosen field and only perform on nights and weekends. No matter what type of job they have, working a regular day job helps drag queens to finance their performances and costumes, as well as paying for any makeup, hair, and beauty supplies they need.\n\nIn some cases, queens may even work with fellow drag performers or designers to create their looks. Whether they're serving drinks or designing fliers, working a day job is an important part\n\n5. Getting involved in activism and charity work\n\nDrag queens have always been at the forefront of the LGBTQIA+ rights movement, using their platform to fight for equality and visibility.\n\nIn recent years, many drag queens have also become involved in activism and charity work outside of the LGBTQIA+ community. For example, many drag queens have worked with organizations that support refugees and undocumented immigrants. They have also been active in the fight for racial justice, partnering with organizations that work to promote diversity and inclusion.\n\nDrag queens use their unique position to make a difference in the world, and their involvement in activism and charity work is one of the many ways they are making a positive impact.\n\n6. Using their platform to raise awareness for important causes\n\nDrag queens are often known for their outrageous sense of style and their over-the-top performances. However, there is more to being a drag queen than just looking glamorous and putting on a show.\n\nMany drag queens use their platform to raise awareness for important causes. For example, RuPaul's Drag Race contestant Gia Gunn came out as transgender during the show's sixth season. In doing so, she helped to increase visibility for the transgender community and break down stereotypes about what it means to be transgender.\n\nSimilarly, drag queen Miz Cracker is an outspoken advocate for mental health awareness. She has been open about her own struggles with anxiety and depression, and she uses her platform to encourage others to seek help if they are struggling. Drag queens like G\n\n7. Staying true to themselves and their artistry\n\nBeing a drag queen is about more than just putting on a dress and a wig; it's about becoming a character that is larger than life. To do this, drag queens must stay true to themselves and their artistry.\n\nThis means being authentic to who they are and what they want to portray. It also means perfecting their craft to ensure that they are always putting their best foot forward. From choosing the right outfit to applying makeup, every detail must be carefully considered.\n\nOf course, staying true to oneself is not always easy, but it is essential if one wants to be a successful drag queen. By staying true to their vision and never compromising, drag queens can amaze audiences with their artistry and create unforgettable moments.\n\n8. Finding creative ways to make money\n\nDrag queens are creative people who often have to find creative ways to make money. One way they do this is through performance art.\n\nDrag queens often perform in clubs, bars, and other venues. They may also perform at private parties, corporate events, and other special occasions. In addition to performing, drag queens may also sell merchandise such as t-shirts, CDs, and DVDs.\n\nSome queenstown even offer private consultations where they help people with hair, makeup, and wardrobe. Whatever the case, drag queens are always finding new and innovative ways to make money.\n\n9. Making sure they are always prepared for gigs\n\nBeing a drag queen is not just about putting on a fabulous outfit and hitting the stage. It's also about being prepared for anything that might come up during a gig.\n\nIf you're new to the world of drag, you might be wondering what kinds of things you need to get started. Of course, you'll need some basic makeup supplies and a good wig, but there are also some items that are specific to drag queens.\n\nFor example, many queens like to use Pals Breast Forms to create a more feminine silhouette. These forms can be attached directly to the skin or worn under a bra, and they come in a variety of sizes to suit different body types.\n\nIn addition to breast forms, queens also often use padded panties or butt pads to achieve the ideal figure. With the right accessories, any queen can create a stunning look that will wow her audience.\n\nFinally, they bring along a few personal items, like their favorite perfume or a photo of their family, to help them feel comfortable and confident while performing. By being prepared for anything, drag queens can focus on giving their best performance and entertaining their fans.\n\n10. Constantly networking\n\nWhile the drag queen community may seem insular, it's actually quite tight-knit. Second only to performing, drag queens are constantly networking.\n\nWhether it's online or in person, queens are always making connections and building relationships. After all, networking is essential for any performer looking to book gigs and build a following. By connecting with other queens, a drag queen can learn about new opportunities, get advice on makeup and costuming, and find potential collaborators.\n\nIn a community as competitive as drag, it pays to have a strong network of support. So if you're ever feeling lonely as a queen, just remember that there are plenty of other queens out there who are more than willing to connect.\n\n11. Pursuing their dreams relentlessly\n\nDrag queens are often known for their over-the-top looks and performances, but there's more to being a drag queen than just putting on a show.\n\nPursuing your dreams relentlessly is one of the key things that drag queens do. They set their sights on what they want and refuse to give up until they get it. This tenacity is what helps them stand out from the crowd and achieve their goals.\n\nWhether it's landing a coveted performance spot or snatching the crown at a pageant, drag queens go after what they want with a fierce determination. So if you're ever feeling lost or like you can't achieve your dreams, remember that drag queens never give up. They pursue their dreams relentlessly until they make them a reality.\n\n12. Living their life to the fullest\n\nWhile drag queens are often known for their outrageous costumes and performances, there is much more to the art form than meets the eye.\n\nFor many queens, drag is a way of life that allows them to express themselves in ways they never could before. It is a form of self-expression that is unapologetically bold and beautiful. In a world where conformity is often the norm, drag queens celebrate individuality and creativity.\n\nFor these reasons, living one's life to the fullest is an important part of being a drag queen.
