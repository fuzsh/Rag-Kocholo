The first-ever “RuPaul’s Drag Race Global All Stars” is coming to Paramount+ on Aug. 16, featuring 12 queens from around the world competing for a grand prize of $200,000 and a spot in the international pavilion at the Drag Race Hall of Fame.\n\nHost RuPaul Charles will lead the panel of judges, alongside resident judge Michelle Visage and choreographer Jamal Sims. Joining them will be a rotation of stars from across the show’s international franchise.\n\n“The world is not ready for ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race Global All Stars‘,” Charles said in a statement. “Twelve queens representing their home countries raises the stakes to a whole new level. Plus, the international mix of charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent will, pardon my French, blow your f***ing minds.”\n\nMTV and the show’s production company World of Wonder have partnered with All Out — an international organization that fights for LGBTQ+ rights around the world — making a $100,000 donation to start the new Drag Saves the World fund.\n\n“We are thrilled to collaborate with ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race Global All Stars’ on the ‘Drag Saves the World’ fund,” said Matt Beard, executive director of All Out. “This partnership is not only a celebration of drag culture; it’s also a powerful statement of love, solidarity and support for LGBTQ+ people around the world who are facing violence and bigotry. The funds raised will directly transform and protect lives, supporting safe houses, evacuation, emergency support and more to those bravely defending human rights in the most challenging environments. Together, we can ensure that everyone, regardless of who they are or who they love, can live with dignity, safety and pride.”\n\nThe series will premiere with two brand new episodes on Aug. 16.
