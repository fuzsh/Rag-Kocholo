        "text": "Charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent are great assets to have but what every Drag Race fan really wants is drama! While no season is completely without antics, there are a few moments in the show’s herstory that are really memorable.\n\nPutting the bold lip syncs and runway looks aside, here are the top 15 RuPaul’s Drag Race fights and feuds featured on the show!\n\nJiggly Caliente vs Lashauwn Beyond | Season 4, Episode 1\n\n“This is not RuPaul’s Best Friend Race!” Who knew one of the show’s most iconic lines in drag race herstory would be born from a fight between two amazing queens? After Lashauwn Beyond calls Jiggly Caliente out for her lack of sew skills, Jiggly was hurt that Lashauwn never told her how she felt about her look. Lashauwn clapped back that she wasn’t here to “make best buddies, bitch” or “to be your friend.”\n\nYvie Oddly vs Silky Ganache and Vanessa Vanjie Mateo | Season 11\n\nSilky Nutmeg Ganashe’s feud with Yvie Oddly lasted the entirety of Season 11, with their fights basically taking over every episode of Untucked. Throughout the season, Yvie made her critiques of her fellow contestants’ looks and performances very clear, which rubbed Silky the wrong way. Eventually, their feud even dragged in other queens, like Silky’s Dreamgirl sister Vanessa Vanjie Mateo, who got into a screaming match with Yvie after a particularly tense judging\n\nHeidi N Closet vs Everyone | Season 12, Episode\n\nAfter getting tired of hearing the girls ganging up on Aiden Zhane, Heidi decided to chime in on the conversation. \"At the end of the day it doesn't fucking matter, the bitch is safe — leave her alone,\" Closet said after having previously removed herself from the conversation to focus on preparing for her lip sync performance.\n\n\"I'mma worry about Heidi. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you.\" She points to a few of the queens feuding.\n\nLaganja Estranja vs Everyone | Season 6, Episode 8\n\nAs the season progressed, Laganja had been quickly getting on everyone's nerves — even their best friend Adore Delano. During her time on the show, Laganja continuously adopted catchphrases like “Okurrr!”and “Yes, Mama!” And when Bianca Del Rio pointed out the change in personality, Laganja became defensive and said they felt “very attacked!”\n\nAja vs Valentina | Season 9, Episode 3\n\nWe think its safe to say that Aja took sarcasm to a whole other level during this fan favorite scene. “You’re perfect, you’re beautiful, you look like Linda Evangelista, you’re a model, everything about you is perfect,” Aja mocked. Even more, fans would see the tension between the two erupt again during the season reunion, when Aja demanded Valentina’s Miss Congeniality title be changed to “Fan Favorite.”\n\nTatianna vs Tyra Sanchez | Season 2, Episode 5\n\nIt was no secret that all the Season 2 queens hated Tyra. Although Tatianna, the most vocal of the bunch, was the one to confront her. Tatianna told RuPaul in front of everyone on the main stage: “I don’t think you’re seeing that Tyra is a complete bitch.”\n\nSerena Cha Cha vs Everyone | Season 5, Episode 2\n\nIn this epic roast, all of season 5 got to speak their peace…”except for Serena.” Here, her lack of polish made her the butt of a playful joke about being of a different level. However, after she requested the floor to defend herself, things took a turn when she claimed that Detox deliberately overshadowed other queens.\n\nThen, she problematically claimed that other queens are using “ghetto lexicon language” that was preventing them from communicating effectively. At this point, all the queens were done with the then 21 year old, including Detox who stood up and delivered her now-iconic statement: “I have had it… officially!”\n\nPhi Phi O’Hara vs Alyssa Edwards | All Stars 2, Episode 5\n\nPhi Phi pops up on our list again for her feud with Alyssa Edwards during AS2. After Alyssa was eliminated, the remaining girls discussed why Edwards was sent home, with Phi Phi interjecting with reads and a bit of shade. But what they didn’t know was that Alyssa along with the other eliminated girls were listening in on the entire conversation. Talk about the face-crack of the century.\n\nAlyssa Edwards vs Jade Jolie | Season 5, Episode 5\n\nHistory was made with just two words: Back Rolls. This fight features epic liners from both sides. “If I was quick to judge you, I’d judge you on that makeup or I could judge you on your lack of talent,” Alyssa says to Jade Jolie, who then replies, “If I was gonna judge anyone, I’d judge you on that body where them shoulders should match them hips, but they don’t, so…”\n\nAlyssa Edwards vs Coco Montrese | Season 2\n\nTalk about a duo with beef. From the moment Montese walked through the door, viewers knew it was going to be an amazing season. The two pageant divas gave each other the cold shoulder from the get-go, largely centering around Alyssa winning Miss Gay America in 2010, but having to give her crown to her runner-up, Coco.\n\nAlyssa and Coco were both brought back for All Stars Season 2, where they revealed that they had both buried the hatchet and were on friendly terms.\n\nKandy Muse vs Tamisha Iman | Season 13\n\nDespite fan complaints of a boring season, this Untucked episode proved drama is around every corner of the RuPaul’s Drag Race set. After Iman admitted she didn’t care for some of the “arrogant” girls in the competition, Kandy Muse immediately became defensive, asking if the other queens felt she was arrogant. The fight was so bad, it even looked like the altercation was going to get physical.Thought, it did spawned a number of catchphrases, such as Tamisha’s “I said what I said.”\n\nMimi Imfurst vs Everyone | All Stars 1, Episode 1\n\nThe Untucked Lounge proves that not everything in the past, stays in the past. As Mimi was defending her decision to the other contestants, nearly everyone had something to say about it. Ultimately, it was Raven who finally dealt the final blow after Mimi said she didn’t want to talk about events from outside the competition.\n\n“Well, guess what Mimi. We did,” Raven seethed. “You, Mimi Imfurst. Mimi Imfurst was number third in the voting? I could not believe it.” To which Mimi exclaimed, “Do not attack my fans, b*tch.” However, Raven was quick to troll back, “From the sh*t that I’ve seen, you don’t have that many.”\n\nMystique vs Morgan McMichaels | Season 6, Episode 8\n\nDuring the first ever episode of Untucked, Season 2 queens Mystique and Morgan McMichaels got into it and it seems like it almost got physical! After Morgan accused Mystique of having “no class and no manners” and telling her to “go fix your hair, fix your mug,” Mystique shot back with a threat that is now an iconic quote in Drag Race herstory: “I will whoop your f*ckin' ass, b*tch! I am from Chicago!” This arguably set the tone or future Untucked episodes to come!\n\nPhi Phi O’Hara vs Sharon Needles | Season 6, Episode 8\n\nTruly one for the books is the season-long feud between Phi Phi and Sharon. When Sharon tried to tell Phi Phi that she felt pushed into doing a spooky look, Phi Phi screamed across the room, “Sharon, you are not even on the same level as me, so get the fu*k out of my face,” which led to Sharon labelling Phi Phi a “tired-ass showgirl.”\n\nThis comment triggered one of the most iconic lines, in not just Drag Race but pop culture as a whole, as Phi Phi snapped: “At least I am a showgirl, bitch! Go back to Party City where you belong!”\n\nShangela vs Mimi Imfurst | Season 3, Episode 3\n\nArguably one of the most iconic fights in RPDR herstory is the altercation between Shangea and Mimi. Shangela really came for Mimi, telling her she could “never be glam.” In response, Mimi accused Shangela of having a “sugar daddy.” Shangela then served one of the greatest comebacks of all time.\n\nBetween the drinks flying, witty insults and utter chaos, this moment goes down as one of the most “sickening” fights in the show’s run.\n\nCheck out Drag Society's latest curations, made by queens for queens!"
