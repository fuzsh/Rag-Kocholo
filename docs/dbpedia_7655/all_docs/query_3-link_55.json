        "text": "In the pages of AD’s June issue, the world’s most famous drag performer, RuPaul Charles, shows off his two enormous closets designed (like the rest of his home) by AD100 talent Martyn Lawrence Bullard. One closet is home to colorful suits, boots, and other menswear, while the other (which features an adjoining glam room) houses sculptural gowns displayed on mannequins and rows and rows of candy-colored high heels. Both have black-and-white patterned floors and sparkling chandeliers, allowing the clothing to take center stage.\n\nGlitter, glamour, and luxury are all words that come to mind to describe these rooms, which aren’t merely closets but an archive of the long career of the Emmy-winning executive producer and host of the mega popular reality show RuPaul’s Drag Race. But in his Open Door video, RuPaul explains why his space represents much more than just excess: “This house is the manifestation of my drag ideal where it’s color and expansive and fun, disco, all the things that make life worth living,” he said. “You have to find the joy. You have to create the joy. Honestly the hardest part is focusing on the joy in your life because we all know there are so many awful things that are around. Why not make your home a beautiful, joyous place to live in?”\n\nDuring a time when lawmakers in numerous US states are proposing bills that would ban drag performances—not to mention other bills targeting LGBTQ+ people like Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill, or bans on gender-affirming care for trans people—finding joy is an essential part of pushing back against hate. Below, in honor of Pride Month, six drag performers who proudly spread joy all year round show off the spaces where their looks come to life.\n\nSince winning the first season of Canada’s Drag Race in 2020, Toronto-based Priyanka (Mark “Suki” Suknanan) performs all over North America and is “planning global domination,” she says, with the release of an album in October. “My message for queer people this Pride is to never let anyone tell you your dreams can’t be realized,” she says. This is the sentiment behind her new single “Bad Bitches Don’t Cry (feat. Ralph),” which was inspired by “the moment my high school guidance counselor told me I’d never be a star.” It’s safe to say she proved him wrong.\n\nDrag must-have: “The most crucial element in my drag look is eyelashes. I know it’s shocking, but whenever you put your eyelashes on your look comes together.”\n\nDrag persona: “My drag persona is me! There isn’t a persona I put on when I’m in drag. I truly am myself in and out of drag. I’m very chaotic.”\n\nYears before competing on RuPaul’s Drag Race season seven and RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars season eight (airing now), Mrs. Kasha Davis (Edward P. Popil, Jr.) was honing her drag persona in her mother’s closet. “I believe I started drag in 1973 when I put on my mom’s padded bra and slapped on some sample Avon lipstick and a wig coiffed out of bath towels,” she says. These days, her look is much more refined, and fans can find her performing cabaret, hosting Bingo nights, leading Drag Story Hour, and speaking out against its critics.\n\n“Each of these performance appearances provide me the opportunity to share my story with the world, be fabulously entertaining, and hopefully show audience members of all ages how very similar we all are in a world that is attempting to shun, ban or criminalize this art form,” says the Rochester, New York-based star. “Drag for me is an expression of all of me and most especially the feminine aspects of who I am that were forcefully suppressed.”\n\nDrag must-have: “Big hair! I’m a husky fella and I come equipped with broad shoulders, so in order to attain that curvy figure, I require big hair, boobs out, and padded hips and derriere. After that it’s just a whisper of makeup and a light lip gloss and I’m ready to go.”\n\nDrag persona: “Mrs. Kasha Davis is a campy, sober, and kind ‘married lady.’ She is everyone’s favorite Auntie and is the ultimate Workhorse Queen.”\n\nYou can currently catch LaLa Ri (LaRico Demetrius Potts) strutting her stuff on RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars season eight, where she’s still in the running to earn her place in the Drag Race Hall of Fame. “Drag allows me the space to be free artistically. Also, I have a passion for entertaining,” says the performer, who has released four singles.\n\nDrag must-have: “I’m a dancer and the majority of my performances are choreography-heavy, so having the right shoes is very important. I’m an addict of Burju Shoes.”\n\nDrag persona: “Sexy, glamorous, sometimes simple yet effective, elegant, and a tad bit banjee.”\n\nTexas-based drag queen Kristi Waters left behind a career as a teacher to perform full-time, and today is at the center of San Antonio’s LGBTQ+ scene, despite the proposed bills in the state threatening to restrict drag. “At the bar I manage and perform at, Paramour, we’ll be hosting a few events along with our regular Drag Brunches throughout the month. I will also be working with the Pride Center in San Antonio to perform at our city’s Pride festival and parade, and I’ll also be attending on my own to celebrate with the community,” she says.\n\nDrag must-have: “The most crucial thing is the audience. What makes it the best is having an audience that’s super engaged with the show. Without that, you don’t have a show.”\n\nDrag persona: “Fun, loud, funny, irreverent.”\n\nAlso still in the running to win the current season of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars, 20-year drag veteran Alexis Michelle (Alexander J. Michaels) says her goal when it comes to drag is to “emulate the great stars of stage and screen. They were my heroines—Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli, Julie Andrews, Carol Burnett and more. I’d always been playing dress up so it was a natural transition.” Look for her at San Francisco Pride this year, but in reality, “I will celebrate Pride 365 days a year as I always aim to,” says the native New Yorker.\n\nDrag must-have: “Makeup is extremely transformative for me, but there’s nothing like putting on the hair! My personal favorite elements though are nails and jewelry.”\n\nDrag persona: “Theatrical, naughty, and gorgeous.”\n\nYou may have seen New York City–based drag queen Pixie Aventura (Cesar Villavicencio) on the recent Hulu cooking competition show Drag Me to Dinner, in which Neil Patrick Harris, David Burtka, and other judges declared her and teammate Merrie Cherry victorious. If not, those who are out and about in New York City during Pride Month are sure to run into Pixie somewhere. “For the most part, Pride Month for us drag queens is Hell Month. We are extremely busy, sometimes double or triple booked in a day with Pride events. It is sometimes hard to plan something just for fun because of the time; if I have a day I use it to rest,” she says.\n\nDrag must-have: “I would have to say makeup is the most crucial point of my drag. I can wear the cheapest off-the-rack outfit to the most expensive but if the illusion and transformation are not there, then nothing else matters.”\n\nDrag persona: “I am known as the Latin Dancing Lip Sync Assassin of NYC. I think that’s a pretty good picture of what I can do, but overall I think I’m a multifaceted entertainer that just wants the audience to go on a journey with me.”"
