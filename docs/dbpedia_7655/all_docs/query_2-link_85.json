        "text": "We’re gonna let you in on a little secret. Some of the best seasons of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” are not appearing on MTV or Paramount+ or screening. And while Season 16 was utterly superb and we stan the runways of some of the current “All Stars” queens, there has been some shockingly good “Drag Race” occurring outside of American television. International franchises such as “Drag Race France” (the new gold standard), “Drag Race Mexico” (an impressive second season), “Drag Race España” (consistently excellent), “Drag Race U.K.” (full of stars crossing over the Atlantic), and “Drag Race Phillippines” (the current definition of “that’s wild”) are just a few of the reasons why. That’s why the long-awaited announcement that “RuPaul’s Drag Race Global All Stars” is arriving on Paramount+ on is something to seriously celebrate.\n\nOh, and did we mention that none other than Alyssa Edwards is part of the cast? That might perk your interest. Plus, it’s completely in English. You no longer have that “I don’t watch subtitled” program excuse.\n\nREAD MORE: Michelle Visage on the “Evolution” of ‘Drag Race’ and embracing one month’s notice to host ‘Drag Race Down Under’ [Interview]\n\nThe new season will feature 12 queens representing almost every major “Drag Race” franchise from around the world (why “España” didn’t make it is strange) and is hosted by none other than RuPaul herself. Mama Ru will be joined by mainstay Michelle Visage, acclaimed choreographer Jamal Sims, and rotating stars from across the international franchise. The season will also feature celebrity judges from across the globe (at least those willing to fly to Colombia where production was based).\n\nThe winner will be crowned “Queen of the Mothertucking World,” win a grand prize of $200,000 and a spot in the international pavilion at the Drag Race Hall of Fame. The series debuts on Paramount+ on August 16 with two all-new episodes. The season will also air overseas on linear MTV channels including Brazil, Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, France, Italy, and Spain. The series will also be available on Paramount+ in Latin America, Brazil, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria on Tuesday, September 20, and in France the following day, with Japan to follow later this year.\n\nIt should be noted, that unlike the current “All Stars” season, queens will actually be eliminated from the competition.\n\nIn a statement from Paramount, RuPaul noted, “The world is not ready for RuPaul’s Drag Race Global All-Stars. Twelve queens representing their home countries raises the stakes to a whole new level. Plus, the international mix of charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent will, pardon my French, blow your f***ing minds.”\n\nAdditionally, MTV, home of the flagship series, and “Drag Race” production entity World of Wonder have partnered with All Out – an international organization that fights for LGBTQ+ rights around the world – in making a $100,000 donation to start the new fund. To find out more and make a donation, look for the “Drag Saves the World” QR code at the end of every episode.\n\nMatt Beard, Executive Director of All Out noted, “We are thrilled to collaborate with ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race Global All Stars’ for the ‘Drag Saves the World’ fund. This partnership is not only a celebration of drag culture; it’s also a powerful statement of love, solidarity and support for LGBTQ+ people around the world who are facing violence and bigotry. The funds raised will directly transform and protect lives, supporting safe houses, evacuation, emergency support and more to those bravely defending human rights in the most challenging environments. Together, we can ensure that everyone, regardless of who they are or who they love, can live with dignity, safety, and pride.”\n\nHere’s a rundown of the 12 queens competing in the “once in a lifetime” global drag competition as well as some notable tea.\n\nAlyssa Edwards (United States)\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race Season 5; RUPAUL’S DRAG RACE ALL STARS Season 2\n\nParamount bio: Alyssa Edwards is a legendary drag queen from Texas with 23 years of experience. Alyssa is famous for her candid chat, tongue-pops, quirky personality, and a bold, grand and over-the-top drag aesthetic embodying the Texas spirit. Owner of Beyond Belief Dance Company showcased in the series “Dancing Queen,” Alyssa’s aim is on the title of “Queen of the Mothertucking World.”\n\nPlaylist Lowdown: An icon, a meme legend, a brand, Edwards is arguably one of the most popular queens in the history of the franchise. She finished top 6 on “Drag Race” season 5 and “a lovely fifth alternate” on “All Stars” season 2.\n\nAthena Likis (Belgium)\n\nDrag Race Belgique Season 1\n\nAthena Likis is a Belgian drag queen and finalist from Drag Race Belgique Season 1. Performing for five years, her aesthetic is conceptual and edgy, drawing inspiration from fashion, sci-fi and mythology. Athena is vocal about sharing her story of overcoming a strict Christian upbringing and is ready to compete on the global stage, showcasing her improved skills and confidence.\n\nPlaylist Lowdown: Arguably “robbed” from winning the first Belgium season, she won both the talent show and makeover challenges. She was the runway queen of her season.\n\nEva Le Queen (Philippines)\n\nDrag Race Philippines Season 1\n\nEva Le Queen hails from Manila, Philippines. Having recently finished in the top three of her season, Eva is known for her elegance and poise, blending Filipino culture with her unique drag style. She is excited to represent her country and hopes to continue inspiring others through her drag.\n\nPlaylist Lowdown: Eva is the epitome of a “safe” queen. She didn’t win a challenge and was safe for eight of nine episodes until the finale. She placed in the bottom once in her season in a three-way lip sync for your life. Can she live up to the stellar heights of her season 1 sister Marina Summers who has become an international star after slaying the latest season of “UK vs. the World”? Ponder.\n\nGala Varo (Mexico)\n\nDrag Race Mexico Season 1\n\nGala Varo from Morelia, Mexico, has over 15 years of performing experience, most recently finishing in the top four during her season. Originally a model, acrobat, and dancer, Gala later became a full-time drag performer. Inspired by artists like Salvador Dali, she is ready to represent Latin America on the global stage.\n\nPlaylist Lowdown: A fantastic performer, Varo was expected to be the lip sync assassin of her season. Instead, she ended up only in the bottom twice, taking both lip syncs, and won one other challenge. She was the runner-up of the season and has regularly performed all across Latin and South America, Southern California, and Texas since.\n\nKitty Scott-Claus (United Kingdom)\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race UK Season 3\n\nKitty Scott-Claus, a fun-loving queen from London known for her humor and camp style, was the runner-up on RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Season 3. Kitty’s background in musical theater and pantomime adds to her entertaining performances, and she is excited to compete on a global stage, bringing her vibrant personality and improved fashion sense.\n\nPlaylist Lowdown: Many could argue with two wins and no bottoms, Scott-Claus could have easily been crowned the winner of her season. Known as a comedy queen, Scott-Claus won an acting challenge but surprised the field by winning a design challenge as well. She’s one of the most multi-faceted queens in this particular competition.\n\nKween Kong (Australia)\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race Down Under Season 2\n\nKween Kong from Adelaide, Australia, is known for her powerhouse performances and Tongan-Samoan heritage. A finalist during her season of RuPaul’s Drag Race Down Under, Kween is also a professional dancer and choreographer. Leader of the Haus of Kong, she is passionate about activism and aims to use that passion to win the crown.\n\nPlaylist Lowdown: Kween won the girls’ group and makeover challenges on her season. She also impressed winning two lip-syncs (yes, she does the splits). She is also the third “Down Under” queen to appear in an international season after her season two sister Hannah Conda and Anita Wigl’it. Can she pull off the first Aussie overseas win?\n\nMiranda Lebrão (Brazil)\n\nDrag Race Brazil Season 1\n\nMiranda Lebrão is an actress and visual artist from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, finishing in the top 4 during her season. With a background in acting and naval engineering, Miranda brings drama and transformism to her drag and is eager to showcase her talents to a global audience.\n\nPlaylist Lowdown: Fun fact: Lebrão filmed “Global All Stars” while her initial season was airing and wasn’t able to appear at her own season’s live crowning (when RuPaul calls, you answer!). She won only one episode on Brazil, a multiple runway challenge, but was also only in the bottom once.\n\nNehellenia (Italy)\n\nDrag Race Italia Season 2\n\nNehellenia from Rome, Italy, was the runner-up and Miss Congeniality on her season of Drag Race Italia. With 11 years of drag experience, Nehellenia is known for her emotional yet strong personality. Having grown significantly since last seen, she is ready to compete on the global stage, bringing her mature and refined drag to the competition.\n\nPlaylist Lowdown: Hilarious and emotional (she had numerous crying moments on her season, Nehellenia is likely the confessional queen of “Global All-Stars” (assuming anyone can take that crown from Alyssa Edwards). She is also part of the House of Kant, led by season one finalist Farida Kant, and their runways are always utterly exquisite. Nehellenia was top two for the Lady Gaga Rusical and won the makeover challenge. Don’t sleep on her.\n\nPythia (Canada)\n\nDrag Race Canada Season 2\n\nPythia is a queen who blends historical and mythical elements into her drag, creating a unique and captivating style. Known for her creativity and attention to detail, she brings a fresh perspective to the competition. Pythia aims to impress the global audience with her innovative approach to drag.\n\nPlaylist Lowdown: Like a number of her “Global All Stars” competitors, Pythia won two challenges, the Rusical and the makeover. She never lip-synced for her life and is viewed by many as the runner-up for season (technically there were two). Expect super creative runways with a French-Canadian twist.\n\nSoa de Muse (France) Drag Race France Season 1\n\nSoa de Muse, from Paris, France, finished in the top 3 on Drag Race France. Moving to Martinique at 15, Soa discovered a love for theater and returned to France at 20 to pursue performance. After finding drag through RuPaul’s Drag Race, Soa became a well-rounded artist in singing, dancing, comedy and cabaret. They have performed across France, including at iconic Parisian venues and co-founded the cabaret La Bouche. Soa’s drag is inspired by their Afro-Martinican culture, aiming to highlight the West Indian community. Identifying as non-binary, Soa seeks to represent universal diversity.\n\nPlaylist Lowdown: Soa had a very dramatic run on her season winning the first episode (the talent show), then lip-syncing for her life the following two, before finally settling down for a finalist run. She also won the franchise’s first girl group challenge and won a lip sync to make it to the final. Soa’s performance skills have never been questioned, but her makeup was. Will she arrive with an “All Stars” glow up?\n\nTessa Testicle (Switzerland)\n\nDrag Race Germany Season 1\n\nTessa Testicle, from Basel, Switzerland, is known for her stunt queen performances and legendary lip-syncs. Tessa’s drag name originated from a testicular torsion incident during her first performance in 2016. Bullied in school, she found acceptance in drag after discovering RuPaul’s Drag Race. A fashion design student, she created all her looks for Drag Race Germany and blends glamor with gender identity exploration, constantly surprising her audience.\n\nPlaylist Lowdown: The most surprising selection for “Global All Stars” until you realize how much RuPaul will love saying her name and you hear how fantastic her English is (which does matter). That being said, Tessa lip-synced for her life in four out of the first five episodes of the season, obviously winning her first three. She will be looking to dramatically improve that shaky track record this time around.\n\nVanity Vain (Sweden)\n\nDrag Race Sweden Season 1\n\nVanity Vain, from Linköping, Sweden, finished third on Drag Race Sweden. Based in Stockholm, Vanity has been doing drag for eight years and describes her aesthetic as “very rock and roll, 80s, sex on legs.” Drag saved her mental health, giving her confidence and Drag Race Sweden enabled her to pursue drag full time. Vanity loves performing and singing but dreads comedy challenges. Known for her excellent makeup skills, she is ready for the competition with sharpened claws and polished shoes."
