        "text": "RuPaul’s DragCon is taking over Los Angeles this weekend, and while we can’t wait to meet our favorite queens from the last 10 seasons of Drag Race, they’re just the tip of the iceberg. Drag Con brings together the most iconic drag queens performing today, whether they’ve been on Drag Race or not. Some of these queens have been doing drag for decades, have established and run famous queer and drag parties across the globe, and are known, beloved, and respected by queens on and off the screen.\n\nAnd while these are all queens who’ve built their careers without appearing on the show, they also recognize the positive way Drag Race and DragCon have impacted their work and the public perception of drag. As legendary San Francisco queen Peaches Christ puts it, “I think one of my favorite memories was the first year it happened. I was walking around the floor with Coco Peru and we both looked at each other and said ‘Could you ever have imagined something like this could happen?’ It was just so surreal for us because we've been performing in drag for decades, and the idea that drag would ever have become popular enough that it could support a convention that big was just unbelievable to us.”\n\nCheck out this list of amazing queens to meet at DragCon LA this year, and get a dose of fabulous from the sisters doing it for themselves.\n\nCoco Peru\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThere are drag queens, and there are legends. Miss Coco Peru happens to be both. With the ends of her red wig perfectly flipped upward, the revered performer first wowed audiences with cabaret shows in New York in the 1990s, but her career has taken her across a multitude of artistic platforms, from film (To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar and trick, for starters) to television (Will & Grace, How I Met Your Mother, and Arrested Development include a few) to theatre (for which she won a GLAAD Award in 2004) and even a web series (her video “Coco Goes to KMart,” in which she famously searches the store for Celestial Seasonings’ Tension Tamer tea, has over 1.4 million views). Coco still hosts events and performs her cabarets around the country, too.\n\n“When I created Coco Peru (before there was Internet and cell phones) I would’ve never imagined that an event like DragCon would exist,” Coco says via email. “I’m just thrilled that I am around to see the evolution of drag and to see so many people being self-expressed and inspired by drag queens. I feel like a proud Grandma of drag!”\n\nHorrorchata\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nOne of the reigning queens of Brooklyn’s wild and delightfully artsy-quirky drag scene, Horrorchata’s drag is inspired by her life as a Latinx punk growing up in San Antonio, Texas. Or, as she says “Brooklyn freaky clown Latina drag.” A co-founder of the now-iconic Bushwig festival in Brooklyn, which celebrates all things fabulously genderfuck in the borough’s scene, she has taken the festival everywhere from Berlin to Mexico and everywhere in between. She’s also the founder of Be Cute, a huge underground queer dance party in Brooklyn, and has been featured in The New York Times, Vogue Hommes, Paper, and countless others for her drag achievements.\n\nPeaches Christ\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nPeaches Christ first made her name in San Francisco in 1998 hosting the event Midnight Mass, a pre-midnight film variety show that grew so popular it eventually welcomed guests like John Waters and Cloris Leachman and became a six-part special on the HDnet Movie Channel. Peaches is also a filmmaker and further solidified her cult status with her 2010 horror film All About Evil, which stars Natasha Lyonne and Cassandra Peterson, aka Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. It has gained a cult following large enough that she’s also regularly invited to horror conventions. “While I love the horror conventions, I must say that they're very hetero. So I really love how queer and weirdo DragCon is. It's such a celebration of flamboyant creativity and is very about supporting a world full of self-expression,” Peaches said via email.\n\nPeaches is currently known for producing drag stage show reimaginings of cult and popular films (two recent performances include Steel Dragnolias with Alaska Thunderfuck and Drag Becomes Her with BenDeLaCreme and Jinkx Monsoon). The subject of the 2016 documentary “A Wig and A Prayer,” Peaches is so beloved that in 2007 San Francisco’s de Young Museum produced an exhibition inspired entirely by her and she was the face of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art’s 75th Anniversary.\n\nHot Chocolate\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nHot Chocolate, aka Larry Edwards, is a renowned Tina Turner impersonator. He appeared in Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (impersonating Patti LaBelle) as well as What’s Love Got to Do With It, the biopic of Tina Turner. A former Miss Gay Florida and Miss Gay America, throughout his career Edwards also appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Entertainment Tonight, and The Oprah Winfrey Show. Edwards is currently a staple in the Las Vegas drag scene, starring in Frank Marino’s timeless Divas Las Vegas show, which in the past has also starred Drag Race alum Derrick Barry as Britney Spears.\n\nBoulet Brothers\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nHorror-inspired nightlife producers and performers the Boulet Brothers — aka Dracmorda and Swanthula Boulet — are best known as the founders of horror drag competition Dragula: Search for the World’s Next Drag Supermonster, which you can watch on Amazon Prime. Their show, the touring version of Dragula and their (in)famous L.A. party “Queen Kong” all seek to challenge the boundaries of what drag, identity, and masculinity can be.\n\nThe Boulets have been involved with DragCon since it started. “One of the best things about DragCon is that the event brings together queens from all over the world for one weekend under the same roof,” they tell them. “We’re all very busy and usually just pass each other in airports or at clubs, so this is really our only chance to Sersi Lannister / Red Wedding the competition.”\n\nHeklina\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nSan Francisco drag icon Heklina — named after the Icelandic volcano Hekla — became known for her notorious drag shows in the city, now known as Mother. Including “everything from lowbrow trash to highbrow performance art,” Heklina has taken her shows around the world. She has been the subject of three documentaries, appeared on E!, The Daily Show, and Good Morning America, among others, as well as in the Scissor Sisters music video for “Filthy Gorgeous.” Heklina co-owns the Oasis cabaret in San Francisco, which regularly features drag performers from Drag Race and beyond. She and Peaches Christ regularly work together, and you can see them in “Mommie Queerest,” a stage play of the film Mommie Dearest, at the Oasis later this month.\n\nBibleGirl\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nSelf-described “internet reality trash” and “Kween of Meme,” raconteur and drag queen BibleGirl is also the founder of DragQueenMerch.com. Inspired by the internet culture that developed in the days of MySpace, she founded the site after leveraging her online fame, and now partners with Hot Topic to sell merch from your favorite queens (Ru Girls and not) in their stores. BibleGirl created a video game, “BibleGirl’s Big Apple” to promote her work as well, and she stars in the lyric video for pop singer Allie X’s “Casanova.”\n\nDragQueenMerch.com has been a regular presence at DragCon, and BibleGirl keeps coming back because “you just can't keep a good business bitch down!” she says. Not to mention it thrills her to meet parents who bring their children to the event. “Being able to level with adults who may not be familiar with or even sure how to react towards drag is really important to me, as is hearing a broad range of journey-to-acceptance stories for families who have queer kids. I personally feel that any amount of conversation with adults who are new to the drag lifestyle can help grant perspective and normalize the craft, or help set the stage for dialogue down the road for parents and kids at the very least.”\n\nElyssa Goodman is a New York-based writer and photographer. Her work has appeared in VICE, Billboard, Vogue, Vanity Fair, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, ELLE, and now, very happily, them. If you’re in New York, feel free to visit her monthly Miss Manhattan Non-Fiction Reading Series.\n\nGet the best of what's queer. Sign up for our weekly newsletter here."
