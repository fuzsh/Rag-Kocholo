        "text": "There’s a famous picture of RuPaul Charles holding a baby Frances Bean Cobain backstage at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards. In the image, she’s crying, and RuPaul, dressed in full drag, is looking at her like a concerned nanny; her father, Kurt Cobain, is gently holding on to her ankle, smiling, as if his tiny daughter is not having a meltdown. Cobain, now 26 years old, was a guest last week on What’s the Tee, the podcast that RuPaul hosts with fellow RuPaul’s Drag Race judge Michelle Visage.\n\nCobain then informed the hosts that RuPaul was not the only drag queen in her life as a toddler. “I firmly believe that that photo captures my personality being made,” she said of the image. “You are the reason I am the way I am . . . You were not my only drag queen in my life from a very young age. I had drag nannies. I remember waking up next to a nanny of mine who used to do Miss Piggy-type drag in a red sequin dress and snout askew.”\n\nRuPaul immediately identified that nanny as drag queen “Loretta Pig from New York.” This choice of caregiver was in keeping with the habits of Cobain’s father and and her mother, Courtney Love; RuPaul referred to them as “drag lovers.” As a result, Cobain said she has “the deepest appreciation for drag culture.”\n\nShe said, too, that her love of drag is just one similarity between her and her parents. When she posts her own music on Instagram, commenters often compare her to her dad, she said.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n“If people need that outlet in order to look at my music, or look at my art, and say, ‘It’s just like your dad’—if they need that, that’s O.K.,” she said. “If that’s the association they make, that’s a pretty damn good association; there are worse things to be called.”\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n— Marriage and the mellowing of Prince Harry\n\n— Here’s our critic’s favorite film out of Sundance\n\n— How Brandi Carlile became the 2019 Grammys’ most-nominated woman\n\n— A visual depiction of Donald and Melania’s unique commitment to one another\n\nLooking for more?
