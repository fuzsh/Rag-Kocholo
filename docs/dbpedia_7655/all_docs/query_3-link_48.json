        "text": "01 of 62\n\nBeBe Zahara Benet: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 1\n\nOG champion BeBe Zahara Benet had all the essential elements that carried her across the first Drag Race finish line back in 2009. The only problem is the relative brevity of her original season's run, meaning less Benet to go around as the show skyrocketed in popularity and all but eclipsed season 1's shine in subsequent years. Thankfully, RuPaul made the right decision to cast her on 2018's All Stars 3, repositioning her for contemporary audiences. But as far as her reach as America's Drag Superstar goes, Benet still has a long way to go to catch up to her sisters, and it's not entirely her fault. Drag Race rose to prominence after she had been crowned, with the original season even being affectionately referred to as \"The Lost Season\" by Mama Ru. In the end, Benet got her footing on the right stage at the wrong time, but All-Stars 3 reintroduced her to a new audience. Here's to getting to see more of what she can milk out of the original title now that Lady Camerooooooon is on equal ground.\n\n02 of 62\n\nJames Ross/Tyra Sanchez: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 2\n\nIt's difficult to deny the talents of James Ross — formerly known as Tyra Sanchez — as a drag queen, at least the way he presented them across the show's second season. Back when RuPaul's Drag Race was still a fledgling, niche program finding its way through the pop cultural landscape, Sanchez appeared to have the perfect blend of hard-edged candor and showstopping, glamorous sensibilities to make a wider audience take note. Unfortunately, after receiving a wave of racist vitriol from the fandom, Ross has since become a pariah among other Drag Race fans (and contestants) for his controversial behavior. He seemingly called for violence against his fellow series alums on social media, and was reportedly investigated by the FBI and banned from DragCon for making threatening posts ahead of the 2018 event. Still, Ross has since apologized, though he recently clashed with All Stars 8 queen Naysha Lopez online, and was arrested twice in 2023 — once for allegedly resisting arrest, and again after he protested that arrest while wearing a dildo in public.\n\n\"A drag queen is wrongfully arrested, the drag queen protests, the charges are dropped,\" Ross told EW when reached for comment. \"Drag queen is cleared and now a week later new charges of 'exposure of sexual organs' because the drag queen protested in drag? Get real.\"\n\n03 of 62\n\nRaja: RuPaul's Drag Race season 3\n\nRaja stepped into the Werk Room with a small dose of fame already coursing through her veins (fans of America's Next Top Model will remember her as Sutan, the adorably sassy makeup artist who worked on the show between 2005 and 2009), but she took RuPaul's Drag Race to the next level as the show's third—and, up to that point, most accomplished—champion. Each week, she delivered mind-blowing look after mind-blowing look and has since blossomed into one of the show's most beloved winners thanks to her frankness (her recap series on YouTube, Fashion Photo RuView, is a fine showcase for this) and bold honesty (she served piping hot reads to Drag Race girls on social media long before Bianca Del Rio came into the fold). She's also a savvy writer, often enlightening her Facebook followers with brilliantly candid essays, all while cranking out dance-pop singles on her own terms (and appearing in fashion campaigns plus a Blondie music video) since taking the title, which be vied for a second time on the fan-favorite All Stars 7 season in 2022. Though she didn't win AS7 overall, she did take the honorary Queen of She Done Already Done Had Herses title and a $50,000 cash prize at the end of her run.\n\n04 of 62\n\nSharon Needles: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 4\n\nDrag Race's resident queen of macabre marvels introduced the show's fandom to a fresh approach to the craft after three seasons filled with more conventionally appealing (but no less exciting) ladies. Needles' appeal stretched beyond her ability to turn every runway into a haunted house of haute couture. As her performance as Michelle Visage during Snatch Game proved, Needles had the acting skills (and comedic mastery) to hold her own against some of the show's most formidable comediennes. Her staying power to back it up became clear in the months after her win, as she released Billboard-charting music and appeared on several non-Drag Race TV shows (Watch What Happens Live, Good Behavior) since taking the crown.\n\nHowever, a side of Needles reportedly darker than the aesthetic she popularized on the show emerged amid her reign, as she was accused in a Daily Beast exposé of using racist language and verbally abusing a minor. Through a legal representative, the entertainer \"vehemently denied the allegations against her,\" as outlined in the piece.\n\n05 of 62\n\nJinkx Monsoon: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 5\n\nA relatable success story for every theater nerd who thought they'd never find their place in the world, season 5 victor Jinkx Monsoon brought a distinct flair to Drag Race unlike anything the show had seen before. Never one to conform to expectations, Monsoon proudly blazed a trail via her distinct blend of divine old-school inspirations with DIY authenticity, creating an aesthetic that was at once refreshing and new yet altogether accessible. She became the first queen to win Drag Race twice, when her oddball fashion and all-time-great Snatch Game performance as Judy Garland earned her a second crown and $200,000 at the end of the series' first-ever all-winners edition on 2022's All Stars 7. In addition, she had a supporting role in Clea DuVall's lesbian rom-com Happiest Season, broke boundaries as the first drag artist to portray Mama Morton in Chicago on Broadway, and landed a lead role on Doctor Who.\n\n06 of 62\n\nBianca Del Rio: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 6\n\nWhen someone mentions RuPaul's Drag Race, you think of the wigs, the lewks, Snatch Game drama, or the shady reads spewed with love and affection each time Mama Ru opens the library—but some personalities are big enough to break through the superficial mold of expectation with a unique mastery of all the talents Drag Race asks of its contestants (and more). From the moment she clicked her stilettos into the Werk Room for the first time, it was clear that season 6 champion Bianca Del Rio had the confidence and talent to push her through to the end of the competition. Quick on her feet, witty, and classically glamorous (for a painted circus clown, that is), Del Rio embodies everything the Drag Race brand is, and her post-show success has only proven she was the right choice for this show's audience. Several sold-out stand-up comedy tours, two Hurricane Bianca movies centered around her, and one book from a major publisher later, Bianca Del Rio hasn't just carried the Drag Race torch, she's proudly burning a new one all on her own.\n\n07 of 62\n\nViolet Chachki: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 7\n\nViolet Chachki introduced several iconic looks into the Drag Race canon across season 7 (don't even get us started on that couture reveal) and, since her victory, she has worked fashion-forward runway shows (Moschino, anyone?) and music videos for others (peep Allie X's fierce \"All the Rage\" visual), as well as fronting eye-popping clips for songs of her own—all while balancing a career as a lingerie model, a burlesque dancer and No Gorge podcast cohost alongside fellow Drag Race alum Gottmik.\n\n08 of 62\n\nBob the Drag Queen: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 8\n\nBob's reign might've come in the middle of Drag Race's legacy on one of the shortest regular seasons to date, but you know that the purse always comes first, honey. She marched into the season 8 fold much like Bianca Del Rio did in season 6: a clear champion, effortlessly strutting her talent as she patiently awaited the inevitable crown. Early on, Bob connected with Ru and the audience with her comedic skills as well as her infectious personality, winning three challenges and the title (and the hearts of the Drag Race nation in the process). She's since made a name for herself outside the show's umbrella, helping Shangela and Eureka lead the HBO series We're Here to Emmy-nominated heights, teaming with her BOMO Beauty co-founder Monét X Change for their beloved Sibling Rivalry podcast, and even joining Madonna for her Celebration tour as the concert series' supporting act.\n\n09 of 62\n\nSasha Velour: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 9\n\nMany of the queens on RuPaul's Drag Race talk about affecting social change through their art, but Sasha Velour puts her money where her slicked lips are. She tackled her post-show career with the idea that \"drag is a form of activism,\" and subsequently used her platform to highlight the talents of lesser-known drag queens that don't have the luxury of the spotlight on national TV. From the stages of NightGowns — her monthly variety showcase of underground talent from around the world—to her self-published zine Velour and her Big Reveal book, the season 9 champion uses her voice to lift up other queer artists at a time when visibility is of utmost importance. And she's a vital piece of the Drag Race family for reaching outside the tribe to share the glory with others as a prime shepherd of community sisterhood.\n\n10 of 62\n\nAquaria: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 10\n\nAquaria is the youngest winner in the history of the show thus far, but took the title after clearly trumping her season 10 sisters in nearly every runway challenge (followed by two epic lip-syncs during the finale) with a poise well beyond her years. She's proven her chops in the couture department by introducing some of the most cutting-edge looks Drag Race has ever seen, and even won Snatch Game (something no one saw coming) with her skills as an improv performer. She's as well-rounded and committed to her craft as many of the previous Drag Race winners. Plus, she has her finger on the pulse of fashion and is tapped into queer youth culture, as many of her fans are teens and young people who see a great deal of themselves in Aquaria's success story. Ru likely wanted to crown a queen who could not only hold her own against seasoned veterans of the global drag stage but also mold something new from the slice of fame she had carved out during her time on the show, and Aquaria has proven she's up to the task. Her technical talents are undeniable, innovative, relevant, and vitally forward-thinking for a show that so desperately wants to break out of the realm of niche appeal, and she has rightly helped push drag into the future for the next generation under the Age of Aquaria.\n\n11 of 62\n\nYvie Oddly: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 11\n\nThe oddest oddity of them all, Yvie Oddly unapologetically injected the strongest hit of trippy absurdity into the world's foremost drag pageant. Her jaw-dropping versatility on the runway was matched only by her ability to contort and contour her body into the most incredible shapes in the most epic sync in Drag Race history against Brooke Lynn Hytes. She might've literally bent over backward to gag us throughout the season, but she took her path to the crown with a confident stride. Since then, she returned to compete as one of the fashion queens on the All Stars 7 all-winners edition, released several earworm music singles, and helped shepherd her drag sister, Willow Pill, to the season 14 throne in 2022.\n\n12 of 62\n\nJaida Essence Hall: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 12\n\nA pandemic and a fellow cast member's preseason controversy couldn't derail Jaida Essence Hall's rightful ascent to the throne of superstardom. With classic fashion sense mixed with progressive performance spirit, Hall made taking the title in a notoriously cutthroat competition look easy with her signature comedic chops, unique runways, and commitment to representing—and honoring—Black excellence across the board. Look over there, henny, there's an icon in our midst — as she proved when she dropped jaws and major fashion upgrades on All Stars 7 (the show's first-ever all-winners edition) in 2022, which, despite a stellar performance throughout the show, saw her miss out on a top-four placement much to the chagrin of fans watching at home. Luckily, she also struck comic gold by teaming up with her season 12 sister Heidi N Closet for their hilarious Hall & Closet podcast.\n\n13 of 62\n\nSymone: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 13\n\nSymone sashayed to victory after steamrolling most of the season 13 competition with incredible looks (her entire package was dedicated to Black excellence, with a poignant Black Lives Matter-inspired gown stopping the show) and good, old-fashioned star power (raise the flags at the fec-treh in her honor!).\n\n\"I want to break some ceilings, molds, and boundaries. I want to be the Naomi Campbell of drag. I want to be the Rihanna of the world,\" she told EW in her coronation interview, months before she'd stun on the Met Gala carpet and land a supporting role in Billy Eichner's Universal-backed 2022 rom-com Bros. \"I want to be a business. I want to go out into the world and say, yes, I can do these things. I'm a drag queen, so what? I want to rule the world, in the simplest way possible! I want to spread the hope, the dream, and the love.\"\n\n14 of 62\n\nWillow Pill: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 14\n\nThe drag sister of season 11 champion Yvie Oddly kept twisted in the family across season 14, with Willow Pill winning over fans—and RuPaul, judging by the look on her face as she watched the Denver queen spill spaghetti into a bathtub soundtracked by Enya—within the first few minutes of the premiere episode.\n\nAfter donning three molds of her own head (including one between her legs) and the world's largest pair of pants for her flawless finale lip-syncs, Willow—the first out trans winner of a non-All Stars season of American Drag Race—also promised that her art would only get more grotesque as she entered her reigning era.\n\n\"I would love to phase a little bit out of drag, I'd love to get more into acting and into absurd sketches and music. I kind of want my art to get more disgusting and dirty and more fun,\" she exclusively told EW after her victory. \"For this year right now, I want to travel all over the world and meet people that have made me have the career that I have now.\"\n\n15 of 62\n\nSasha Colby: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 15\n\nFans have willed few other queens to Drag Race as much as they called for the show to cast Sasha Colby — pageant legend, Miss Continental winner, world-renowned lip-sync icon, and drag mother to Kerri Colby — for a season. Drag Race answered by letting Sasha lead season 15, including an acting challenge that mimicked real life by featuring her as God and a Grand Finale performance where she made her-story by stripping down to a nearly nude state in protest of anti-trans legislation sweeping the country.\n\n\"It was a specific choice to be naked in these times. I wanted them to see what they're trying to eradicate,\" Sasha told EW in an exclusive coronation interview, later adding: \"I get the reward of having my life goal accomplished, but this has been bigger than me at this point, in this political climate. I told myself, while doing the finale, that this wasn't trying to win, this was me showing these people that want to silence us and put us down and — for lack of better words — say 'f--- you' to all of them.\"\n\nShortly after winning season 15, Sasha continued to work on behalf of the community, even speaking at the White House in June 2023 after an invitation from Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n16 of 62\n\nNymphia Wind: RuPaul's Drag Race, season 16\n\nNymphia Wind, the banana queen of season 16, peeled herself to reveal a winner on the Drag Race finale after a stunning, boba tea-inspired lip-sync (complete with the release of balloon pearls from under her coat!) against runner-up Sapphira Cristál. In doing so, the Taiwan-raised Nymphia became the American edition's first-ever East Asian winner, and only the second queen of Asian descent to take the title 13 years after Raja won season 3 back in 2011.\n\n\"You have to remember to acknowledge the good and the bad and see it as a whole,\" Nymphia told EW in her exclusive coronation interview, when asked how she hopes her victory impacts other Asian kids struggling with self-confidence issues like she did. \"When you have those bad days, remember the good days are going to come. The bad days aren't forever. Be graceful, and know that people are out there just like you, even if they may seem confident in themselves.\"\n\n17 of 62\n\nChad Michaels: RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, season 1\n\nWhen it comes to picturing a good, old-fashioned drag queen, someone like Chad Michaels immediately comes to mind—at least on the surface. But once you peel back the 47-year-old's layers, you find an old soul with the chutzpah of fellow competitors half her age. She made a name for herself among the Drag Race clan thanks to her impeccable Cher impersonation, but her legacy carries on thanks to her ability to transcend the realm of mimicry and make each performance—as Cher or otherwise—unique to herself.\n\n18 of 62\n\nAlaska Thunderf---: RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, season 2\n\nAlaska entered the competition in the shadow of her former lover, season 4 winner Sharon Needles. At every turn, Alaska faced comparisons to her ex-companion, but she emerged unscathed as arguably the funniest queen to ever grace the Drag Race stage. She didn't take the season 5 title, but she earned her rightful place atop the throne on the second edition of All Stars three years later. And she roared back with a vengeance, stepping up her runway game with a refined mix of camp and glamour missing from her earlier work. She has since gone on to star in other reality shows (she was the highlight of VH1's spectacularly ridiculous Scared Famous), release a few iconic singles (hello, \"Your Makeup Is Terrible\"), and even landed a role in the final Sharknado film. As her post-show career reflects, Alaska is a refreshing mix of street and elite — and one of the crown jewel of All Stars champions to date, whom you can celebrate every week as she recaps Drag Race with fellow alum Willam on their popular Race Chaser podcast.\n\n19 of 62\n\nTrixie Mattel: RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, season 3\n\nMiss Mattel certainly didn't have the best track record across the third All Stars edition of Drag Race (she won two challenges but was never singled out for owning a lip-sync for her legacy), but RuPaul clearly valued her charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent on display outside the confines of the show enough to crown her the season's champion anyway. And it's easy to see why. Though she was eliminated prematurely on her original season, Mattel has since grown her personal brand to the size of Lady Bunny's wig: She has released four successful albums, a sold-out worldwide tour, and even fronted her own popular talk show, The Trixie & Katya Show, on Viceland. In turn, the comedy queen has become a flattering model of Drag Race excellence (and a royal among fans and alums alike) that's helped shape the identity of the show in pop culture at large as one of the most celebrated personalities the show has ever seen, from her pair of best-selling books, monolithic beauty empire Trixie Cosmetics, and Trixie Motel docuseries, to her regular nationwide tours and ongoing, wildly popular variety web series — UNHhhh and I Like to Watch — with Katya.\n\n20 of 62\n\nMonét X Change + Trinity The Tuck: RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, season 4\n\nFor the first time in franchise herstory, RuPaul crowned two queens in one season, anointing Trinity The Tuck and Monét X Change as the only co-winning pair to snatch the title. And it's not unjustifiable in the slightest. X Change fronted a monumental glow-up from season 10 to her coronation, acing narration of the season with her undeniable star wattage, while Trinity turned it out on the runway. Both queens represent vastly different drag styles, but together their power is, collectively, the single strongest entity Drag Race has ever produced. They each returned to compete on All Stars 7 in 2022 to prove they could hold their own. Both won multiple challenges and courted fan appreciation before Monét ultimately finished as runner-up to Jinkx.\n\n21 of 62\n\nShea Coulee: RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, season 5\n\nJujubee might've turned the heat of the competition up to a sensible 74, and Miz Cracker buried her inner saboteur for good, but All Stars 5 was never anything but The Shea Coulee Show. From the moment she stepped her crystal-crusted foot onto the Main Stage in her nude-illusion bodysuit, the race was this season 9 alum's to lose, and for good reason: From her spot-on impression of a male celebrity for Snatch Game (the image of Coulee with a Flavor Flav clock around her neck will be burned into our memory for ages) to her complete slayage of the runway challenges and sustained activism in the community throughout the Black Lives Matter movement, Coulee became not only a shining example of Drag Race excellence, but a beacon of good for the entire community. After she reminded the world why she deserved a crown in the first place after competing again on All Stars 7, Shea landed a major role in Marvel's upcoming Ironheart Disney+ series in a groundbreaking role for drag artists on the mainstream TV platform.\n\n22 of 62\n\nKylie Sonique Love: RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, season 6\n\nIt took 11 years for season 2 alum Kylie Sonique Love to snatch the Drag Race crown, and it was a hard-fought battle for a well-earned title that concluded with a storybook ending. Kylie became the American series' first transgender winner (Thailand's Angele Anang remains the franchise's first-ever trans champion) for her incredible lip-sync to a Lady Gaga song, after a Snatch Game impression of the Oscar-winning pop icon sent her home back on season 2.\n\n\"I've been working hard at this, not expecting anything. I grew as a person and an entertainer. There have been so many times that I sacrificed a lot because I love drag so much. Drag doesn't always pay the bills, but you do it because you love it. You have to enjoy and take the good with the bad,\" Kylie told EW in her coronation interview. \"Win or lose, I was going to be the same. As long as you're following your heart, you'll never go wrong.\"\n\n23 of 62\n\nJinkx Monsoon: RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, season 7\n\nBreak out the paté and giblets for the cats: Season 5 champion Jinkx Monsoon officially became the first queen to win twice on RuPaul's Drag Race when Mama Ru deemed her the crowned queen of All Stars 7. Across the season, Jinkx performed one of the best Snatch Game characters of all time as Judy Garland and made peanut butter sandwiches the sexiest accessories on the dance floor, maintaining her signature wit, charm, and comedic timing both in the challenges and in the Werk Room (we're looking at you, tiny ukulele).\n\n\"This could possibly be the very last time I walk this runway for the rest of my life—unless we do a 20-year reunion with all the winners of the winners of the winners,\" Jinkx said after taking the crown. \"I just want to take mental pictures—let it all imprint on me—so whenever I'm having a hard moment later in life, I can remember I already did one of the most challenging things ever and totally accomplished my mission as a drag sentinel. So, whatever life wants to throw at me next, I already done had mineses.\"\n\n24 of 62\n\nJimbo: RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, season 8\n\nJuly 21, 2023 will forever be known as Jimbo's Special Day. The Canadian queen became the first-ever international star to win a season of All Stars, having graduated from Canada's Drag Race to RuPaul's Drag Race UK vs. the World and, finally, to the American Main Stage, where she handily won All Stars 8 with ace comedy skills, laugh-out-loud performances in comedy challenges, and an absolute decimation of the Snatch Game as a bonkers interpretation of Shirley Temple.\n\n\"At one time, my feminine side, my gayness, my weirdness, was perceived to be my worst enemy, it was the thing that people saw that made me different and knew I wasn't straight or an average boy — all those things I was trying to be, but wasn't. It's crazy that what was once my weakness is now my greatest strength,\" Jimbo told EW after her victory. \"I've been able to lean into that and it's given people around the world permission to lean into their weirdness.\"\n\n25 of 62\n\nNatalia Pliacam: Drag Race Thailand, season 1\n\nWith its bonkers challenges, super specific cultural references, and deliciously energetic panel of hosts, Drag Race Thailand feels like a surreal, dreamworld version of the American series it's based on. But someone like Natalia Pliacam represents the best of both worlds, embodying the right amount of classic drag glamour with distinct approaches to humor and performance that make her the ideal candidate to serve as the franchise's first global ambassador outside North America.\n\n26 of 62\n\nAngele Anang: Drag Race Thailand, season 2\n\nAngele Anang continued Thailand's boundary-pushing precedent by becoming the franchise's first transgender winner in herstory, proudly blazing a trail with top-notch showgirl vibes (she's known locally as \"the Beyoncé of Thailand\") and killer looks that allowed her to skate through a season filled with campy queens and fashionistas nipping at her sky-high heels.\n\n27 of 62\n\nLuz Violeta: The Switch Drag Race, season 1\n\nLoosely based on RuPaul's Drag Race, The Switch stretches its monolithic queen contest out over twice as many episodes (season 1 boasted 24) for a supersized crop of contestants (17 on the inaugural batch of episodes), meaning season 1 champion Luz Violeta had to claw her way through an even feistier pool of cutthroat queens to claim her title. She would later return for the second season, but withdrew during the middle of the competition.\n\n28 of 62\n\nMiss Leona: The Switch Drag Race, season 2\n\nAgainst seasoned Drag Race alums like Kandy Ho and Gia Gunn, French beauty Miss Leona handily took The Switch's second-ever crown after a 12-week run. She's also an accomplished singer, having competed on the French edition of The Voice, where she reached the semifinals under the name Leona Winter.\n\n29 of 62\n\nThe Vivienne: RuPaul's Drag Race UK, season 1\n\nIt's a monumental task to represent the most prominent international spin-off in the Drag Race franchise, but The Vivienne's reign had Queen Elizabeth shaking in the deepest corners of Buckingham Palace. On the surface, she might look like a pageant stunner, but her approach to comedy is so much more than skin-deep. Her intuitive wit, timing, and genuinely kind heart (you haven't lived until you've seen her adorable interactions with fans and sisters alike on WOW Presents Plus' God Shave the Queens are palpable in every performance. There's no denying you're in the presence of the Royal Court when The Vivienne commands a stage, but she's not afraid to serve greasy, gritty fish and chips out the back door, either — something she stressed once again as she became the first queen from an international series to compete on American All Stars among the AS7 cast of former winners.\n\n30 of 62\n\nLawrence Chaney: RuPaul's Drag Race UK, season 2\n\nMore iconic than the British Royal Family, Lawrence Chaney's penchant for comedy, quick wit, and undeniably unique fashion made her the crown jewel of the U.K.'s second Drag Race contest.\n\n31 of 62\n\nKrystal Versace: RuPaul's Drag Race UK, season 3\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race UK season 3 champ Krystal Versace dropped jaws with her stunning fashions and (sometimes controversial) attitude, but her real legacy lies in the fact that she made herstory as the first queen under the age of 12 to win a Drag Race title. All jokes aside, the 20-year-old started doing drag at age 13, so she's a well-seasoned vet at this point. And she paid dutiful tribute to those around her following her victory.\n\n\"First of all thank YOU ALL for always supporting me and being my inspiration to keep being a better artist and person. Thank you to my family for supporting me throughout and loving me endlessly,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Here's to a brilliant season and an exciting journey ahead for all of us. I can't wait to keep growing and sharing my drag with the world.\"\n\n32 of 62\n\n​​Danny Beard: RuPaul's Drag Race UK, season 4\n\nLiving up to their name, Danny Beard became the first-ever bearded queen to win a season of RuPaul's Drag Race, doing so with ease after winning four maxi challenges and never once landing in the bottom throughout the competition.\n\n33 of 62\n\nGinger Johnson: RuPaul's Drag Race UK, season 5\n\nIt's hard to believe RuPaul's Drag Race UK has already cycled through five seasons, and to commemorate its quintuple edition, the show sprinkled a little spice — Ginger Johnson, to be exact — atop its sweet Bakewell tart of excellence. Ginger never landed in the bottom once throughout season 5, and even notched an astonishing three consecutive challenge wins throughout her run on the show.\n\n\"Thank you for everything. I've had the time of my life and I'm not only leaving here with this shiny little stick, but also with the most amazing crowd of sisters,\" the Lanchester native said in her victory speech. \"I'm not often lost for words, but I'm astounded. There is nothing bigger than this, in drag, and to win is just everything. This is the perfect end to the perfect dream.\"\n\n34 of 62\n\nBlu Hydrangea: RuPaul's Drag Race UK vs. the World, season 1\n\nBelfast's finest—also affectionately known by her sisters as the \"horniest\" and \"shadiest\" of the season—proudly claimed the first international all-star title in franchise herstory on the debut installment of RuPaul's Drag Race UK vs. the World. Besting U.S. legends like Mo Heart and Jujubee, as well as her Drag Race UK season 1 sisters Baga Chipz and Cheryl Hole, Blu navigated a series of shocking eliminations and wowed the judges with her incredible Austin Powers Snatch Game performance, quick wit in the Werk Room, and stunning looks that elevated her from Northern Ireland to the biggest stage in the world.\n\n35 of 62\n\nTia Kofi: RuPaul's Drag Race UK vs. the World, season 2\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race UK season 2 now has a pair of crowns for two global rulers. After Lawrence Chaney scored the installment's first title, seventh-place finisher Tia Kofi returned for UK vs. the World to snatch the crown — and the world's hearts in the process.\n\n\"This means the absolute world to me,\" Tia said upon taking the scepter, after placing in the top-two four times throughout the season. \"To go from Baroness Basic to Queen of the Mother Tucking World is wild, but it proves that you can do anything that you set your mind to. So, everyone, make sure you do your homework and pay your taxes.\"\n\n36 of 62\n\nPriyanka: Canada's Drag Race, season 1\n\nWhat's her name? As if anyone could possibly forget, Priyanka's signature catchphrase isn't as much of a genuine question as it is an assertion of dominance after Canada's inaugural champion stole hearts, the crown, and Miss Cleo's ghost's sanity over her franchise debut. She might not be able to tour her addictive personality around the continent just yet, but her delightfully chaotic social media feeds have been a quarantine joy for those perpetually glued to their screens indoors, running the gamut from legitimate post-show work (peep her in the Anjulie music video for \"Do Better\") to hilarious exchanges with her platonic lover, Lemon.\n\n37 of 62\n\nIcesis Couture: Canada's Drag Race, season 2\n\nAll of the cast's jokes about Icesis Couture's cracking, injured, thirtysomething-aged knees aside, the Canadian queen pried the second Queen of the North title away from Priyanka's vice grip with mighty ease thanks to her ingenious approach to self-made runways and classic showgirl sensibilities. The only knee you should be concerned about now is the one you're kneeling on in Icesis Couture's presence — which fans got to do again when she returned to compete on the inaugural season of Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World in 2022.\n\n38 of 62\n\nGisèle Lullaby: Canada's Drag Race, season 3\n\nSaboteurs, redemption arcs, telepathic judges, and Miss Congeniality chaos abound on Canada's Drag Race season 3, but Gisèle Lullaby's victory provided a soothing (French Canadian!) balm to a particularly wild season.\n\n39 of 62\n\nVenus: Canada's Drag Race, season 4\n\nAfter one of the best seasons in recent Drag Race her-story (dominated largely by budding icon Melinda Verga's legendary drama), Venus became the first indigenous queen to win the Canadian crown, and accepted her prize through an emotional bevy of tears.\n\n\"I’m taking this title with so much pride. As the first indigenous queen to win, on indigenous land, this is such a monumental moment,\" Venus said, crying in a confessional. She added on the Main Stage: \"I have gotten to prove to myself that I am a superstar. Baby, this is just the beginning.\"\n\n40 of 62\n\nEnvy Peru: Drag Race Holland, season 1\n\nThis South American-born beauty handily won the Netherlands' fiercest drag contest, taking four of eight challenge wins over the first season's run. Her win came at a tumultuous time in Peruvian politics, and she used her new platform to raise awareness about political unrest and LGBTQIA+ rights in her homeland. On top of that, she can really turn a look on the runway, and that's the kind of royal power we can all bow down to.\n\n41 of 62\n\nVanessa Van Cartier: Drag Race Holland, season 2\n\nDrag Race Holland season 2 kept it in the family, as Vanessa Van Cartier—drag legend, trans icon, and mother to season 1 winner Envy Peru—took the crown one year after her dazzling daughter became the first Dutch Drag Superstar.\n\n\"Words can not describe how proud I am [of] you,\" Envy wrote on Instagram following her mama's victory. \"You proved in that final lip-sync why you are an absolute star and the one who can carry this crown with grace!\"\n\n42 of 62\n\nKita Mean: Drag Race Down Under, season 1\n\nWith blessings from guest judges Kylie Minogue, the Veronicas, and Taika Waititi, Kita Mean sashayed the franchise to new global territory across Drag Race Down Under season 1. With her progressive looks that fused classic glamour with futuristic flair—shout-out to that stunning Chromatica space enchantress—Kita Mean proved she's a fitting pioneer for mainstream drag in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n43 of 62\n\nSpankie Jackzon: RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under, season 2\n\nIn a hilariously specific twist of fate, New Zealand drag legend Spankie Jackzon received a crown from fellow Kiwi queen Kita Mean twice: When she won the reality TV competition House of Drag (on which Kita was a judge) back in 2020, and on RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under season 2, when season 1 winner Kita Mean returned to the stage to pass the crown to her successor.\n\n44 of 62\n\nIsis Avis Loren: RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under, season 3\n\nThe fandom loves to read Down Under for its seemingly minimal production value, but season 3 winner Isis Avis Loren is a priceless addition to the global winners' circle. Falling in line with a recurring theme among recent winners of the show, the Melbourne native didn't place in the bottom at all during her run, and scored a trio of challenge wins before taking the crown over fierce competitors Flor and Gabriella Labucci.\n\n45 of 62\n\nCarmen Farala: Drag Race España, season 1\n\nFrom the start, it was clear Carmen Farala wouldn't miss throughout Drag Race España's inaugural season. With her showstopping runway looks (that cobra number is still burned into our collective brain) and monumental slayage in the challenges (she won three maxi contests across eight total episodes), Carmen never landed in the bottom two, and now rests comfortably at the top of the Spanish drag game.\n\n46 of 62\n\nSharonne: Drag Race España, season 2\n\nSharonne joined an elite club among Drag Race royalty when she became one of only a handful of queens to have never landed in the bottom before taking the Drag Race España season 2 crown. She also racked up three challenge victories and quickly became a favorite of the judging panel for her comedy skills and daring looks—and she did it all while pacing to become the oldest winner in global Drag Race herstory at age 45.\n\n47 of 62\n\nPitita: Drag Race España, season 3\n\nWith four challenge wins — double the amount of her closest competitor — and a hungry determination to win, Pitita easily bested the Drag Race España contest on the spin-off's most-watched edition to date.\n\n\"It's impossible to explain what it feels like to be here. Thank you to everyone who has followed me, everyone who believed in me, everyone who invested so much of their time so that this would all go well,\" the Barcelona queen said after accepting her crown. \"I'd like to give thanks to all my colleagues. Without them I wouldn't have been able to survive such a challenging experience. This is a dream come true.\"\n\n48 of 62\n\nDrag Sethlas: Drag Race España All Stars, season 1\n\nDrag Race España season 2 star Drag Sethlas forged new territory for the Drag Race franchise, becoming the first-ever winner of an international season bearing the official All Stars title.\n\n\"To be honest, it’s super complicated to give a nice speech right now. The only thing I can bring myself to do is say thank you to all the people who have supported Sethlas,\" the first inductee into the Drag Race España Hall of Fame said. \"You’ve managed to get this scepter and this crown to go to the Canary Islands, for that drag style is so unique and with so much personality. I want to thank the others for giving me their friendship, their care, their love. This is not the end. This just started!\"\n\n49 of 62\n\nPaloma: Drag Race France, season 1\n\nEscargot-she-betta-do, Miss Paloma laced the Drag Race France stage with decadent style sweeter than the trimmings on a Ladurée pastry. Season 12 alum Nicky Doll presided over season 1 of the latest European franchise edition, and previously told EW that the final three—including Paloma, Soa de Muse, and La Grande Dame—was \"extremely strong\" all the way through.\n\n\"[We have] a Drag Race winner that actually is French,\" Nicky joked. \"That did not happen yet because I did not win!\"\n\n50 of 62\n\nKeiona: Drag Race France, season 2\n\nWhen one Legendary door closes, another Werk Room entrance opens. Such was the case for Drag Race France season 2 winner Keiona, who previously competed on — and was ultimately eliminated from — season 3 of Max's ballroom-centered competition series Legendary, before finding her high-heeled footing on Drag Race's French spin-off. Keiona finished season 2 with a stellar track record, with two overall challenge wins and high placements on every other episode.\n\n51 of 62\n\nRa'Jah O'Hara: Canada's Drag Race: Canada vs. the World\n\nRa'Jah O'Hara is the glistening embodiment of an ultimate Drag Race glow-up, after wowing fans (and the judges) with runway-ready fashion and royally comedic chops during her All Stars 6 return. After a lively lip-sync against her fellow season 11 sister (and close friend) Silky Nutmeg Ganache, Ra'Jah took her rightful crown on the international stage, becoming Canada vs. the World's first global all-star winner. But, this might not be the last stop on the Ra'Jah and Silky Express. When EW asked if they'd ever return to compete in the long-rumored RuPaul's Best Friends Race, Ra'Jah responded: \"Hell yeah.\"\n\n52 of 62\n\nElecktra Bionic: Drag Race Italia, season 1\n\nFierce drama and ferocious queens ensured that Drag Race Italia's launch season lived up to the region's signature vibrant palette, and the stretch ended with another shock: Elecktra took the crown without winning a single maxi challenge.\n\n53 of 62\n\nLa Diamond: Drag Race Italia, season 2\n\nOn the flipside of her predecessor's track record, Drag Race Italia season 2 champion La Diamond won the most maxi challenges out of anyone on her season, having earned four overall wins paired with zero bottom-two placements to finish with one of the best track records in worldwide Drag Race her-story.\n\n54 of 62\n\nLina Galore: Drag Race Italia, season 3\n\nIn a hard-fought battle against runner-up Melissa Bianchini, Lina Galore triumphed over Drag Race Italia's third season — and vowed to help fight growing anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiment in Italy.\n\n\"I hope, from the bottom of my heart, that this power is not only helpful to me, but to all the people who look to me from home [who] may have felt for a second represented, protected, but above all, seen,\" she said in her acceptance speech, adding in a confessional: \"I feel the responsibility of having to speak for more people because so many more people can listen to me. That’s why it’s an honor to win Drag Race Italia.\"\n\n55 of 62\n\nDrag Couenne: Drag Race Belgique, season 1\n\nBrussels-based entertainer Drag Couenne staked her claim on new territory amid Drag Race's ongoing European expansion, with zero bottom placements and three maxi challenge victories which ascended her to the throne under the watch of head judge and Canada's Drag Race alum Rita Baga.\n\n57 of 62\n\nPrecious Paula Nicole: Drag Race Philppines, season 1\n\nThe Philippines came in hot to the global Drag Race stage, with season 1 of the Filipino spin-off garnering some of the best fan reactions of any season worldwide. Though Marina Summers traversed the season as a fan-favorite contestant, Precious Paula Nicole emerged victorious after stunning the judges on the runway and the Rusical.\n\n58 of 62\n\nCaptivating Katkat: Drag Race Philippines, season 2\n\nDrag Race Philippines' second season crowned Captivating Katkat as the international edition's first trans winner — and she paid tribute to her fellow trans performers in a dress bearing the colors of the trans pride flag and a declaration that \"trans women are women\" stitched to the front.\n\n\"Holy crap! S---!\" Katkat said after taking the crown. \"Don’t ever give up reaching for your dreams. Go! Fight, trans!\"\n\n59 of 62\n\nAdmira Thunderpussy: Drag Race Sweden, season 1\n\nSweden has a firm chokehold on global pop music, and thanks to Admira Thunderpussy, it's tightening its grasp on worldwide entertainment through drag excellence as well. The Stockholm native amassed a trio of challenge victories and zero bottom placements across Drag Race Svierge's inaugural run — a stellar track record that continued as the queen made her way through Swedish pop culture, having released music and presented at the iconic Grammis awards show in 2023.\n\n\"I was right,\" Admira said during her coronation speech. \"That voice inside that's been saying, 'This is what you should be doing, Adam. F--- what everyone else thinks and tells you to do. If this is what you want to do with your life, do it.'\"\n\n60 of 62\n\nCristian Peralta: Drag Race Mexico, season 1\n\nDespite being one of the newest spin-offs in the franchise, Drag Race Mexico set the bar high for seasons to come, from its endlessly glamorous cohosts Valentina and Lolita Banana to its winner lodging one of the all-time best track records of any queen among the series' 14-year herstory. With five overall challenge wins and no bottom placements, winner Cristian Peralta dominated the competition from episode 1, but also secured a unique place among the Drag Race family as a pansexual performer who's married to a woman — and even has a daughter.\n\n61 of 62\n\nPandora Nox: Drag Race Germany, season 1\n\nAfter nearly 15 years on the air, the Drag Race franchise made her-story after crowning Pandora Nox as the first cis woman to win any of the show's multiple global iterations. The Drag Race Germany star followed in the high-heeled footsteps of RuPaul's Drag Race UK's Victoria Scone and Drag Race España's Clover Bish, paving the way for more cis women to sashay into global Werk Rooms in the future. \"To everybody out there, I think this is the best example that, even if something seems impossible, you can still dream, and dreams sometimes do come true,\" Pandora said in her victory speech. \"So, go for it!\"\n\n62 of 62\n\nOrganzza: Drag Race Brasil, season 1\n\nOrganzza celebrated \"Black on top\" with her soaring triumph over Drag Race Brasil's inaugural season — hosted by Queen of the Universe winner Grag Queen.\n\n\"I was born into this world as a Black person, poor, from the hood, a gay child, so here I leave my plea,\" Organzza said after taking the crown. \"For all the Black kids, all the gay kids, may you be happy, and may it be Carnival all year round for everyone. And last, but not least, the slum won!\""
