        "text": "Start your jet engines, racers, because RuPaul’s Drag Race is going global.\n\nAfter announcing a Global All Stars spin off in December 2022, the cast for the much-anticipated spinoff of the beloved reality competition franchise was announced Monday afternoon on the show’s official YouTube channel. While there are other Ru-verse shows in that feature international casts of queens — specifically UK vs. the World and Canada vs. the World — this latest iteration features a single queen from most of the countries that currently have a Drag Race program.\n\nThe announced queens for RuPaul’s Drag Race Global All Stars include, alphabetically:\n\nAlyssa Edwards, RuPaul’s Drag Race season 5 (6th place) and All Stars season 2 (5th place)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAthena Likis, Drag Race Belgique season 1 (runner-up)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nEva Le Queen, Drag Race Philippines season 1 (3rd place)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nGala Varo, Drag Race Mexico season 1 (runner-up)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nKitty Scott-Claus, Drag Race U.K. season 3 (runner-up)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nKween Kong, Drag Race Down Under season 2 (runner-up)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMiranda Lebrão, Drag Race Brasil season 1 (runner-up)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nNehellenia, Drag Race Italia season 1 (runner-up)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nPythia, Canada’s Drag Race season 2 (runner-up)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nSoa de Muse, Drag Race France season 1 (runner-up)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nTessa Testicle, Drag Race Germany season 1 (8th place)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nVanity Vain, Drag Race Svierge season 1 (3rd place)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like queens from beloved franchises such as Holland, Thailand and Spain did not get a spot in this round but, if this franchise ends up being like any other iteration of a Drag Race show, there are surely more installments around the corner.\n\nThe season will debut with two episodes on Friday, August 16 and will find the queens competing for the title of “Queen of the Mothertucking World,” as well as $200,000. Perennial judges RuPaul and Michelle Visage will return to judge the competition, alongside choreographer Jamal Sims, who has been featured on several seasons of the show as a guest panelist.\n\nThe format of the season is still under wraps. Fans are especially curious to know whether the season will feature eliminations or — much like All Stars 7 and the currently running All Stars 9 — will be a cumulative competition with no eliminations and some sort of badge or star system to track progress. We’ll have to wait until later this summer to find out for sure!\n\nGet the best of what’s queer. Sign up for Them’s weekly newsletter here."
