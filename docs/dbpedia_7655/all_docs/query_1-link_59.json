        "text": "This article not only outlines the 20 most powerful drag queens in the US but also delves into the broader image of drag queens and the historical roots of this movement.\n\nCommonly, there’s a stereotypical perception of gay individuals dressed in flamboyant feminine attire, adorned with oversized wigs and heavy makeup. While this portrayal is often accurate, the true origins of drag culture are multifaceted. “Drag” encompasses both the commanding stage presence of a performer belting out a power ballad or disco classic and the underground allure, like one of the most famous drag queens from the 80s, as amplified in Madonna’s “Papa Don’t Preach” video.\n\nWhile contemporary Emmy-winning shows like RuPaul’s Drag Race showcase the evolution of drag, the early days of the movement had a distinct character. Drag finds its roots in two realms: the performances of female actors in silent films (although those movies will never be on the list of the 50 Best Movies of all Time) and the vibrant LGBTQ culture of underground drag balls in the early twentieth century. Unfortunately, stereotypes and stigma have obscured many lesser-known facts about this segment of culture.\n\nLooking for the most famous drag queens in history, we found that the origins of drag trace back to ancient Greece and Rome, where men portrayed female characters. According to Lady J, a drag performer and musicology doctor specializing in drag history, the term “drag” was first used in the 1860s in Victorian England by Ernest Boulton, one of the most famous drag queens in history and of the duo Boulton and Park. The 1880s witnessed popular performers depicting glamorous white women with slim waists and elegant makeup. However, the United States saw the emergence of a drag ball subculture in the early twentieth century, with the term “queen of drag” being coined. The first individuals fitting into this category were Black and Latino performers, marking the beginning of their journey in competitions and artistic growth.\n\nThere are a lot of famous drag queens in history, but undoubtedly, William Dorsey Swann, a figure from the late 1800s and early 1900s, stands as the first drag queen in the US. His dance parties gained immense popularity and are believed to be the first drag shows in the country. Despite referring to himself as the “queen of drag” during a time when such language was not entirely accepted, Swann faced legal consequences, including a jail sentence and a raid on his home. He and his community were among the pioneers defending the LGBTQ+ community’s right to gather.\n\nIn terms of legal challenges, Tennessee, a U.S. state, has implemented restrictive measures against the LGBTQ community and queer shows and it surely is not one of the 25 Countries with the Biggest LGBTQ+ Population. Presently, engaging in drag where children might witness it could lead to legal consequences. While being a drag performer doesn’t necessarily imply being gay, the majority of the most popular drag queens 2023 are gay, cisgender men. Initially, the first drag queens were predominantly gay men finding a safe space at masquerade balls. However, contemporary drag goes beyond expressing sexual orientation or gender; it has become a dynamic show, a performance, and a distinctive way of presenting oneself to the world.\n\nWe created a compilation of the top 20 most powerful drag queens in the US by amalgamating information from reputable websites and portals. Despite the most famous drag queens not on drag race, the surge in popularity of drag culture owes much to shows like “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” where drag queens in the US have evolved into cultural icons. This most successful drag race queens net worth has served as a platform for drag queens in the US to display their talents as comedians, musicians, actors, models, choreographers, and often as savvy businesspeople. In the wake of these shows, American culture embraced the phenomenon, leading to newspapers publishing lists of the most prominent drag queens in the country. Typically, talent agents, managers, and club brokers were the ones responsible for creating these lists. However, we also need to consider the impact of social media and the longevity of a career as factors shaping a celebrity’s popularity. We also considered the most powerful drag queens New York magazine listed and other influential newspapers. Additionally, each of these individuals is recognized for their charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent, all of which play a role in determining their ranking on the list. When it comes to the 20 most powerful drag queens in the US Reddit were quite useful, too. After examining numerous lists of this nature, we compiled a roster of names that consistently appeared and organized them based on their positions and popularity. Over the years, the top four names have consistently held the highest ranks on lists of popular drag queens. Keep reading to discover which name consistently secures a spot in the top three on the list of the most powerful drag queens in the US.\n\n20.

Manila’s costumes, ranging from a roadkill Big Bird to a spaghetti-and-meatballs extravaganza or a maxi-pad dress (banned by the show but embraced on Instagram), are consistently campier than anything seen on the Met Ball’s pink carpet. For Manila, extravagance is the standard so it could be added on the list of the 25 Most LGBTQ-Friendly Countries in the World.\n\nWhat may forever solidify Manila’s place in history is a yet-to-be-released project causing a stir in the drag community. One of the most powerful drag queens in the US is the creator and host of a reality TV series set in her mother’s hometown of Manila, which also serves as the inspiration for her name.
