        "text": "It's fair to say that Raven is Drag Race royalty.\n\nThe Emmy-winning makeup artist appeared on the second season of RuPaul's Drag Race, before competing in All Stars and fronting her own show Painted With Raven.\n\nStream RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under only on Stan.\n\nShe also serves as legendary drag queen RuPaul's makeup artist – and that's exactly what she did in the upcoming season of RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under, which premieres on July 28, only on Stan.\n\nIt's rumoured she might also make an appearance in this series, too...\n\nSpeaking exclusively to 9Entertainment ahead of the premiere, Raven discussed the upcoming season, the significance of makeup in drag and her relationship with RuPaul.\n\n\"I have always said this: makeup is the most important thing when it comes to being a drag queen,\" she began. \"When you are getting in drag, there are plenty of drag performers who don't wear clothes, but they still have to have makeup.\n\nREAD MORE: RuPaul's Drag Race star Michelle Visage on the evolution of drag\n\n\"There are plenty of drag performers who are bald or don't do anything as far as their hair or anything else, but they still have to have makeup. Makeup is always going to be the biggest part of doing drag.\n\n\"I'm happy that makeup has become what is has, because I honestly feel that without the popularity of RuPaul's Drag Race, makeup and the beauty industry would not be booming the way that it is.\n\n\"Everyone wants to contour now, everyone wants to highlight, everyone wants to over-emphasise their lips, or their brows or their lashes, so you have a drag queen to thank for that.\"\n\nWhen asked if there was one go-to product she often reaches for in her kit, Raven replied: \"My Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick, because I have used it on the eyes as well and it's worked – plus it wears all day. Once you put it on, it's set.\n\nREAD MORE: Drag Race Down Under Star Rhys Nicholson dishes on what it's really like to work with RuPaul\n\nIn Pictures\n\nThe queens of RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under in and out of drag\n\nMeet the fabulous faces behind the makeup.\n\nView Gallery\n\n\"And I think, Rimmel London's black ink liquid eyeliner. That's a really good one – just the tip of it you can lay on your eye and deposit so much colour and pull it out and wing it without struggling.\"\n\nRaven also shared her excitement for the brand new series of RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under, which after two successful seasons is returning to Stan once again.\n\n\"I am excited, and let me tell you why,\" Raven explained. \"Every time a new group of queens comes in, you're already thinking about the queens from the season before – but then you get surprised.\n\n\"You end up watching these queens evolve in front of your eyes, and you are kind of blown away to even think that you were trying to compare them to someone else from a season before.\n\nREAD MORE: The epic special guests who will appear on RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under Season 3 - including Adam Lambert and Maria Thattil\n\n\"I love the Down Under queens, I love the UK queens, I love all queens, but I think that the queens for season three are a little hungrier, so there might be a little more drama.\"\n\nWhen it comes to tips for anyone starting out in drag, Raven has a few.\n\n\"The thing is that there are tutorials out there for everything. Maybe observe a few tutorials but don't do the whole thing, take a little bit from this and a little bit from that, because you see a lot of people start to look like the person they want to emulate.\n\n\"But create your own look, create your own base, your own thing that makes you stand out and makes other people look at you and go 'That's you'.\n\n\"There's enough out there for you to make or create your own look.\"\n\nIt comes just weeks after Stan confirmed the queens for the new season.\n\nYou can read all about them by clicking here.\n\nThe series recently received two coveted 63rd TV WEEK Logie Awards nominations for its second season – Most Outstanding Entertainment Program and the Graham Kennedy Award for Most Popular New Talent, for Season 2 runner-up Kween Kong. This is the first time a drag performer has ever been nominated for a TV WEEK Logie award.\n\nThe brand new season of the Stan Original Series RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under will premiere Friday 28 July, only on Stan.\n\nTo vote for Kween Kong for the Graham Kennedy Award for Most Popular New Talent at the 63rd TV WEEK Logie Awards head to tvweeklogies.com.au\n\nRelated Clips"
