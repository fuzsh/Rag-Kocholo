        "text": "What is a drag queen?\n\nA drag queen is a person, usually male, who uses costuming and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate female gender signifiers and gender roles for entertainment purposes.\n\nAre all drag queens men?\n\nAre drag queens male or female?\n\nHistorically, most drag queens have been men dressing as women. In modern times, drag queens are associated with gay men and gay culture, but they can be of any gender and sexual identity.\n\nFemale drag queens, for a time, went by terms such as “bio queen,” “faux queen,” and “hyper queen.” With today’s gender identity variations these terms are falling out of usage. Some prefer “AFAB queen” which stands for “Assigned Female at Birth” while others refuse to have a gender-specific label and just prefer to be known as “drag queens”\n\nAre drag queens transgender (trans)?\n\nNot necessarily. Drag refers to the act of dressing up in an exaggerated fashion. A transgender woman identifies with a gender she was not assigned as birth. These are two different things that sometimes meet. Some drag queens eventually transition to living as women but may still perform in drag. Some also identify as “non-binary” which means they prefer not to be referred to as male or female.\n\nWhy do people do drag?\n\nPeople partake in the activity of doing drag for reasons ranging from artistic self-expression to mainstream performance. For many it a career choice and a source of income.\n\nWhat is a drag show?\n\nWhat does a drag show consist of?\n\nDrag shows frequently include lip-sync acts, live singing performances, comedy, and dancing.\n\nSome drag queens are actors who appear in theatrical productions as female or drag queen characters.\n\nDrag queens often host fun interactive activities such as drag bingo or drag karaoke.\n\nDuring the pandemic a popular activity has been virtual drag bingo played over Zoom or a similar platform\n\nActs can range from comedic to dramatic to political, and that the performances can vary widely depending on the individual drag queen and the venue.\n\nWhy are they called “drag queens”?\n\nWhat is the origin of the term “drag queen”?\n\nThere are various theories about the origin of the term \"drag queen.” The term existed in the early 20th century in Polari, a type of British slang. Some historians believe the expression was born around the 1800s in reference to the wide skirts worn by men dressed as women which “dragged“ on the ground. Others say it was an abbreviation for “Dressed Resembling A Girl.” which was used as stage notes in theater. There is no consensus on either of these theories.\n\nWhere can I see drag queens?\n\nMost cities have drag shows that occur at predominantly LGBTQ bars and nightclubs. There may also be a local drag queen brunch. Drag queens can also be booked to perform at a special event such as a birthday, holiday party, ladies night, etc. Country club drag shows and college drag events are increasingly common.\n\nHow can I hire a drag queen?\n\nIs there a drag queen booking agency?\n\nIs there a drag queen talent agency?\n\nHow can I book a drag queen?\n\nThe #1 drag entertainment company, Screaming Queens Entertainment, has been providing drag performers for private events since 1993. Past clients include Dunkin Brands, WeWork, Google, Macy’s, MAC, Meta, Netflix, and CitiBank. Performers are available in and around most major cities in all 50 states.

Think Big Bird, Barney, and the Disney Princesses. It’s no surprise that many tykes are thrilled to meet a brightly attired drag queen. It has recently become popular to schedule events, often at public libraries, that involve drag performers reading stories to kids. Many forward-thinking parents are attracted to the idea of exposing their kids to gender non-conforming people to expand their worldview.\n\nWhat is a “drag king”?\n\nA drag king is most often a female performer who wears a masculine wardrobe and incorporates male gender stereotypes as part of their performance.
