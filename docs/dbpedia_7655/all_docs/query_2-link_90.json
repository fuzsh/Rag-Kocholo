        "text": "Twelve different Drag Race franchises are set to throw down in the first-ever Global All Stars.\n\nOn Monday (15 July), World of Wonder finally released the cast for the series, which consists of one fierce player from each international franchise (bar Holland and Thailand).\n\nInitially, fans (and us) were befuddled as to how this season would differentiate itself from UK and Canada vs the World, both of which collect Drag Race contestants from across the globe.\n\nLooking at this line-up, however… yeah, it makes sense. This cast is absolutely major; every single queen is a drag powerhouse.\n\nCollectively, there’s 17 maxi-challenge wins (!) and eight contestants who placed runner-up on their original seasons, while the remaining queens are either fan-favourites or lip-sync assassins (or both).\n\nInterestingly, only one Global All Stars contestant has played Drag Race more than once – meaning those who complained about the return of two or three-time contestants on Canada’s Drag Race vs the World season two should feel (somewhat?) satisfied.\n\nGlobal All Stars premieres 16 August in the UK on WOW Presents Plus with two episodes.\n\nHosted by RuPaul, Michelle Visage and choreographer Jamal Sims, guest judges will consist of “rotating stars from across the international franchise”.\n\nRuPaul gushed about the series with the following statement: “The world is not ready for RuPaul’s Drag Race Global All Stars.\n\n“Twelve queens representing their home countries raises the stakes to a whole new level. Plus, the international mix of charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent will, pardon my French, blow your f***ing minds.”\n\nThe champion will sashay away with a grand prize of $200,000, the title of “Queen of the Mothertucking World” and a spot in the “international pavilion at the Drag Race Hall of Fame”.\n\nEnough chitter-chatter: meet the cast of Drag Race Global All Stars below (with bios courtesy of World of Wonder).\n\nAlyssa Edwards (RuPaul’s Drag Race season 5, All Stars 2)\n\n“Alyssa Edwards is a legendary drag queen from Texas with 23 years of experience. Alyssa is famous for her candid chat, tongue-pops, quirky personality and a bold, grand and over-the-top drag aesthetic embodying the Texas spirit. Owner of Beyond Belief Dance Company showcased in the series Dancing Queen, Alyssa’s aim is on the title of “Queen of the Mothertucking World.””\n\nAthena Sorgelikis (Drag Race Belgique season 1)\n\n“Athena Likis is a Belgian drag queen and finalist from Drag Race Belgique Season 1. Performing for five years, her aesthetic is conceptual and edgy, drawing inspiration from fashion, sci-fi and mythology. Athena is vocal about sharing her story of overcoming a strict Christian upbringing and is ready to compete on the global stage, showcasing her improved skills and confidence.”\n\nEva Le Queen (Drag Race Philippines season 1)\n\n“Eva Le Queen hails from Manila, Philippines. Having recently finished in the top three of her season, Eva is known for her elegance and poise, blending Filipino culture with her unique drag style. She is excited to represent her country and hopes to continue inspiring others through her drag.”\n\nGala Varo (Drag Race Mexico season 1)\n\n“Gala Varo from Morelia, Mexico, has over 15 years of performing experience, most recently finishing in the top four during her season. Originally a model, acrobat and dancer, Gala later became a full-time drag performer. Inspired by artists like Salvador Dali, she is ready to represent Latin America on the global stage.”\n\nKitty Scott-Claus (RuPaul’s Drag Race UK season 3)\n\n“Kitty Scott-Claus, a fun-loving queen from London known for her humor and camp style, was the runner-up on RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Season 3. Kitty’s background in musical theater and pantomime adds to her entertaining performances, and she is excited to compete on a global stage, bringing her vibrant personality and improved fashion sense.”\n\nKween Kong (RuPaul’s Drag Race Down Under season 2)\n\n“Kween Kong from Adelaide, Australia, is known for her powerhouse performances and Tongan-Samoan heritage. A finalist during her season of RuPaul’s Drag Race Down Under, Kween is also a professional dancer and choreographer. Leader of the Haus of Kong, she is passionate about activism and aims to use that passion to win the crown.”\n\nMiranda Lebrão (Drag Race Brasil season 1)\n\n“Miranda Lebrão is an actress and visual artist from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, finishing in the top 4 during her season. With a background in acting and naval engineering, Miranda brings drama and transformism to her drag and is eager to showcase her talents to a global audience.”\n\nNehellenia (Drag Race Italia season 2)\n\n“Nehellenia from Rome, Italy, was the runner-up and Miss Congeniality on her season of Drag Race Italia. With 11 years of drag experience, Nehellenia is known for her emotional yet strong personality. Having grown significantly since last seen, she is ready to compete on the global stage, bringing her mature and refined drag to the competition.”\n\nPythia (Canada’s Drag Race season 2)\n\n“Pythia is a queen who blends historical and mythical elements into her drag, creating a unique and captivating style. Known for her creativity and attention to detail, she brings a fresh perspective to the competition. Pythia aims to impress the global audience with her innovative approach to drag.”\n\nSoa de Muse (Drag Race France season 1)\n\n“Soa de Muse, from Paris, France, finished in the top 3 on Drag Race France. Moving to Martinique at 15, Soa discovered a love for theater and returned to France at 20 to pursue performance. After finding drag through RuPaul’s Drag Race, Soa became a well-rounded artist in singing, dancing, comedy and cabaret. They have performed across France, including at iconic Parisian venues and co-founded the cabaret La Bouche. Soa’s drag is inspired by their Afro-Martinican culture, aiming to highlight the West Indian community. Identifying as non-binary, Soa seeks to represent universal diversity.”\n\nTessa Testicle (Drag Race Germany season 1)\n\n“Tessa Testicle, from Basel, Switzerland, is known for her stunt queen performances and legendary lip-syncs. Tessa’s drag name originated from a testicular torsion incident during her first performance in 2016. Bullied in school, she found acceptance in drag after discovering RuPaul’s Drag Race. A fashion design student, she created all her looks for Drag Race Germany and blends glamor with gender identity exploration, constantly surprising her audience.”\n\nVanity Vain (Drag Race Sverige season 1)\n\n“Vanity Vain, from Linköping, Sweden, finished third on Drag Race Sweden. Based in Stockholm, Vanity has been doing drag for eight years and describes her aesthetic as “very rock and roll, 80s, sex on legs.” Drag saved her mental health, giving her confidence and Drag Race Sweden enabled her to pursue drag full time. Vanity loves performing and singing but dreads comedy challenges. Known for her excellent makeup skills, she is ready for the competition with sharpened claws and polished shoes.”"
