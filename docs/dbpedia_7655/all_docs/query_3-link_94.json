        "text": "Itâs hard out there for a drag queen. Dancing in sky-high stilettos, flopping to the floor for a âdeath drop,â performing night after night? It all takes a toll on the body. So whatâs a drag queen to do? We asked Alaska Thunderfuckârunner-up on season five of RuPaulâs Drag Race and winner of the second season of RuPaulâs Drag Race All Starsâabout her fitness regimen, nutrition, and thoughts on body image. The performer and recording artist otherwise known as Justin Andrew Honard will be the headlining performer at Saturdayâs Peep Show, hosted by Wussy Mag for Pride weekend at Deep End.\n\nCan you describe for me the physical parts of your performances?\n\nIâm not a huge dancer onstage. In fact, I like not moving at all if I donât have to. But even just standing up for any given amount of time in 6-inch heels ends up leaving me feeling like Iâve been cracked in half like a rag doll after a few shows.\n\nHow do you start your day? Can you share with me what a typical morning (or afternoon) looks like for you, when you start your day?\n\nMy perfect day starts with putting on the teapot. Then I have tea in my favorite Golden Girls mug and watch The Daily Show. Meditation is essential. I try to start each morning with a focus on the breath and three things Iâm grateful for.\n\nYour performance calendar looks really busy. How do you prepare, physically, for your shows? What kind of workouts do you do?\n\nI just try to rest a lot. I try to lay flat whenever I possibly can when Iâm on tour. Also I heard once that stretching is the fountain of youth, so stretching has always been a part of my life. As far as working out, I hate gyms so I work out at home. I have a few 25- and 35-pound dumbbells, and I just got 45-pound kettlebells I use for various light weight-lifts at home.\n\nWhy do you do those particular workouts? Are you trying to achieve a particular look? Is it also about stamina so that you can make it through all of these shows?\n\nI like eating, and tearing down my muscles periodically lets me eat a lot to supplement the workouts. Plus it makes me feel better mentally. Working out grounds you in your body and in the moment so if Iâm ever feeling fuzzy headed a workout always helps check in with the moment.\n\nHow often do you work out?\n\nIf Iâm home, two to three times per week. If Iâm on the road, not nearly enough.\n\nAny workouts or fitness trends you avoid or hate?\n\nI donât like gyms. I like privacy and alone time. Also, I donât care for cardio.\n\nWhat do you do for self-care, otherwise, post-shows?\n\nI have a great facial care specialistâBrandon at 360 Skin in San Franciscoâand he makes my skin look and feel great. I also like massages to counteract the crooked positions I find myself in on airplanes.\n\nWhat kind of nutrition plan do you follow, if any? How important is nutrition to the way you look, feel, and perform?\n\nI donât eat meat or fish and I avoid gluten. I went vegetarian as an experiment nearly 15 years ago. My body felt so good and healthy, I never looked back.\n\nDo you find that the standards for beauty are very high for you? Is there a particular body type that performers strive to achieve? Or is there more openness to different body types in drag?\n\nI feel very fortunate that the [ideal] body in drag is pretty much fake. Everything you see is manipulated in some artificial way. Also I donât think the drag community is extremely hung up on mainstream ideas of beauty or aesthetics. We find beauty in everything and in everyone. Iâm glad to be a part of this community.\n\nIs fitness a big part of the drag community? Is the gym a big part of the culture?\n\nIt differs from queen to queen. I think some queensâ main form of fitness is dancing and bucking and twirling onstage, and thatâs a type of fitness I fully support."
