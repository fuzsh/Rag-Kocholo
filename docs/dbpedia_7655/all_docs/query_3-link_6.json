Since 2009, he has executive produced and hosted the reality competition series RuPaul's Drag Race, for which he received five Primetime Emmy Awards in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. RuPaul is the most commercially successful drag queen of all time, and in 2017, he was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.\n\nRuPaul was born and raised in San Diego, CA and later moved to Atlanta, GA to study performing arts.

RuPaul was also featured as a host on the series Skin Wars: Fresh Paint, Good Work, Gay for Play Game Show Starring RuPaul, and as a judge for CBS global competition series, The World’s Best.\n\nAs an actor, RuPaul has appeared in over 50 films and television shows both in and out of drag including Crooklyn (1994), The Brady Bunch Movie (1995), To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995), But I'm a Cheerleader (1999), Comedy Central series Broad City (2017), Netflix originals Girlboss (2017) and Gracie & Frankie (2019), and the voice of Queen Chante in The Simpsons (2018). Most recently, RuPaul has teamed up with Michael Patrick King (Sex in the City, 2 Broke Girls) to produce Netflix original comedy series, AJ & The Queen, in which RuPaul will also star.\n\nAs an author, RuPaul has published three books: GuRu (Harper Collins, 2018), Workin' It! RuPaul's Guide to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Style (Harper Collins, 2010), and Lettin' It All Hang Out (Hyperion Books, 1995).\n\nRuPaul splits his time between New York, California and Wyoming. He is married to Australian rancher, Georges LeBar, who he met on the dance floor in 1994 at Limelight Disco in New York City."
