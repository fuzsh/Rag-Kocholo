        "text": "Here are the Top 10 most-followed 'Drag Race' queens on Instagram!\n\nSantiago Felipe; Michael Loccisano; Christopher Polk/Penske Media (via Getty Images)\n\n(L-R) Plastique Tiara; Trixie Mattel; Bianca Del Rio\n\nA top-tier group of queens have successfully capitalized on their exposure from RuPaul's Drag Race and became bona fide superstars with millions of followers on Instagram.\n\nThe drag universe is more mainstream than ever in 2024, and a significant portion of that growth comes from queens featured on Drag Race. In fact, several drag performers can now easily surpass cast members from other mainstream reality shows like The Bachelor, Love Is Blind, The Real Housewives, and Love Island, to name a few.\n\nDespite the expectation that Drag Race winners tend to get more appreciation from fans, there are just as many popular queens on social media who didn't necessarily have high placements in the series but still became viral sensations.\n\nScroll through to check out the 10 most-followed queens in the RuPaul's Drag Race franchise!\n\nAll information below as of July 1, 2024.\n\n8-10. Bob the Drag Queen — 1.8m followers\n\nwww.instagram.com\n\nBetween winning season 8 of Drag Race, starring in various TV shows, going on countless drag tours, releasing comedy specials, dropping original music, cohosting a few podcasts, and hitting the road with none other than Madonna herself for the Queen of Pop's The Celebration Tour, Bob the Drag Queen has reached a massive audience and currently has 1.8 million followers on Instagram.\n\nAs of July 1, 2024.\n\n8-10. Alaska — 1.8m followers\n\nwww.instagram.com\n\nAll Stars 2 winner Alaska currently has 1.8 million followers, which means that she's tied with a few other RuGirls. However, Alaska has been thriving more than ever in her career and even created a multimedia empire of podcasts/digital series through Moguls of Media (MOM).\n\nAs of July 1, 2024.\n\n8-10. Jinkx Monsoon — 1.8m followers\n\nwww.instagram.com\n\nJinkx Monsoon became the first two-time Drag Race winner in herstory following her victories on both season 5 and All Stars 7. Since then, Jinkx has been on a path of world domination that includes roles in Chicago on Broadway, the hit BBC series Doctor Who, and even playing the lead female character in Little Shop of Horrors. At this point in time, Jinkx is reaching an audience of 1.8 million followers on Instagram.\n\nAs of July 1, 2024.\n\n7. Alyssa Edwards — 1.9m followers\n\nwww.instagram.com\n\nThe season 5 superstar and All Stars 2 legend Alyssa Edwards is still one of the most popular drag queens in the world with an Instagram following that includes 1.9 million fans. We're still trying to figure out what Alyssa's Secret is, but it sure works!\n\nAs of July 1, 2024.\n\n5-6. Violet Chachki — 2m followers\n\nwww.instagram.com\n\nDrag Race season 7 winner Violet Chachki has 2 million followers on Instagram. As she continues to expand her career and to open new doors for drag artists, fans love to keep up with Miss Chachki.\n\nAs of July 1, 2024.\n\n5-6. Adore Delano — 2m followers\n\nwww.instagram.com\n\nAdore Delano has always been — and still is — one of the ultimate fan-favorite queens in the Drag Race series, which explains her giant fanbase of 2 million Instagram followers. The season 6 runner-up and All Stars 2 contestant has also come out as a trans woman in recent years, and she's looking absolutely STUNNING.\n\nAs of July 1, 2024.\n\n4. Bianca Del Rio — 2.5m followers\n\nwww.instagram.com\n\nBianca Del Rio held the no. 1 spot in terms of Instagram followers for a very, VERY long time. But with her current 2.5 million followers, the season 6 winner has since been surpassed by a few other Drag Race alumni. This clown queen is still extremely booked and blessed, though, so she continues to have the last laugh!\n\nAs of July 1, 2024.\n\n2-3. Plastique Tiara — 2.7m followers\n\nwww.instagram.com\n\nSince placing eighth on Drag Race season 11 and returning for the charity season of All Stars 9, Plastique Tiara has conquered the social media game with her presence on TikTok and Instagram.
