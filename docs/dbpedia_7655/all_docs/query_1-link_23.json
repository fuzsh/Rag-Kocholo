        "text": "Trixie Mattel is a drag queen, performer, comedian and music artist from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, best known as a contestant from Season 7 of RuPaul's Drag Race and as the winner of All Stars 3.\n\nFollowing Season 7, Trixie began presenting a web show with Katya, entitled \"UNHhhh\", on the WOWPresents' YouTube channel. They later starred on \"The Trixie & Katya Show\" on Viceland, which lasted for one season before the two returned to UNHhhh. Trixie defines herself as being 'the only drag folk musician', and has released four studio albums to date including Two Birds (2017), One Stone (2018), Barbara (2020) and The Blonde & Pink Albums (2022). Trixie's first venture into the makeup industry was a collaboration collection with Sugarpill Cosmetics called \"Oh Honey!\". In early 2019, Trixie launched her own cosmetics brand called Trixie Cosmetics. Later that year she starred in her own documentary called Moving Parts, directed by her longtime boyfriend, David Silver.\n\nIn 2020 Trixie and Katya released the comedic self-help parody novel Trixie and Katya's Guide to Modern Womanhood and subsequently became the first drag queens to make the New York Times bestseller list. They also launched their podcast The Bald and the Beautiful with recurring episodes weekly.\n\nOn October 28th 2021, Trixie was announced as a member of the judging panel for Queen of the Universe.\n\nTrixie has her own show on Discovery Plus. Trixie Motel premiered on June 5th, 2022, and in the series, Trixie and her long-time boyfriend David Silver set to renovate a rundown Motel in Palm Springs.[7] In June 2024, a season 2 of the show, Trixie Motel: Drag Me Home was released where she and her partner renovate their own Hollywood home.\n\nDrag Name Origin[]\n\nThough her first choice for a drag name was Cupcake, Mattel chose Trixie as her official first name because when she was younger, she had a rough relationship with her stepfather. Whenever she was acting too feminine, her stepfather would call her Trixie like it was a slur. When she was 19, she had to step in for a person who played \"Dr. Frank N. Furter\" in ''\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\"''. It just so happened that the character's name was also Trixie, which felt like fate.\n\nShe started her career only as Trixie, but nobody really knew her name so they referred to her as \"the new girl who looks like a Barbie doll.\" She later chose Mattel as an homage to Barbie, her number one visual inspiration. As a child, she was not allowed to have a Barbie, so she became one.\n\nTrack Record(s)[]\n\nStatistics USA Season 7 USA All Stars\n\nSeason 3 Ranking: 6th Place\n\n(Orig. 11th Place) 1st Place\n\n(Winner) Maxi Challenges Won: 0 2 (Eps. 5, 7) Mini Challenges Won: 2 (Eps. 2, 9) 0 Times as Team Captain: 1 (Ep. 2) 0 Times in Bottom: 2 (Eps. 4, 10) 2 (Eps. 4, 6) Episode Eliminated: Episodes 4, 10 N/A\n\nMemorable Quotes[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Season 7[]\n\n\"This isn't Maury Povich?!\" (entrance quote)\n\n\"Ginger, does someone of your body type prefer to be called a short person or a bean bag chair?\"\n\n\"I went to your mom's birthday party.\" (to Jasmine Masters after she said Trixie looked like she was dressed for a birthday)\n\n\"I paint for the check cashing place down the street.\"\n\nDuring the Reading Challenge:\n\n\"Violet, I don't believe the rumors.

Power to me, is when the people, they listen to you.\n\nSwedish people, we do not believe in power.\n\nWhen I was hungry I would say to my grandparents: \"May I please have........bread.\"\n\n\"Minus a tenth of a point Simone we've talked about this.\"\n\n\"I wish murder was legal.\"\n\n\"She was taking pictures of herself in the middle of the crosswalk; if I didn't do it a Tahoe was going to.\"\n\n\"When someone is like MCKAYLEIGH I'm like \"What are you doing right now\".\"\n\nPoor people are like I'm just trying to have my baby survive how about BETH.\"\n\nTrivia[]\n\nOn December 21, 2021, Trixie Mattel became the most followed queen on Instagram.\n\nTrixie Mattel grew up in a poor half-Ojibwe family. She has a brother and at least two, or more, half-sisters.\n\nHer younger sister has since appeared on Trixie's YouTube channel in a Get Ready With Me that can be watched here.\n\nMattel has been vegetarian since the age of 9.[8]\n\nShe is a democratic socialist.[9]\n\nA week before going on Drag Race, Trixie was fired from her job and carjacked.\n\nShe further explains this in detail in UNHhhh episode 134.[10]\n\nShe attended the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee for musical theatre with Max. They were both in the school's production of No No, Nannette.[11][12]\n\nIn 2011 Trixie won the Wisconsin Entertainer of the Year pageant, but declined to compete at the national pageant as she guessed she would lose.[13][14]\n\nShe is often jokingly nicknamed \"Tracy Martel\" by Katya and fans, which originated from a pageant in which a drunk announcer forgot her actual drag name.[15]\n\nHer albums titles, \"Two Birds\" and \"One Stone\", are a play on the saying \"to kill two birds with one stone.\"\n\nShe portrayed herself on the final episode of \"American Horror Story: Roanoke\".[16]\n\nShe was one of the first RuGirls to be made into a \"Funko Pop!\" figurine, alongside RuPaul herself, and Alaska.\n\nShe can play the guitar and the autoharp, as seen on \"All Stars 3\" where she played the autoharp and sang.[17][18]\n\nShe is the 1st eliminated contestant to return in her own season, and stay past the episode in which she returned, breaking the so-called \"Returning Queen Curse.\" She was followed by Naysha Lopez in Season 8, Latrice Royale in All Stars 4., and Eureka! in All Stars 6.\n\nTrixie is the first non-runner up queen to win \"All Stars\", later followed by Monét X Change, Trinity the Tuck, Shea Couleé and Kylie Sonique Love. She was also the first winner to be a returning queen on her original season.\n\nOn \"Untucked\" Season 8, Episode 3, it was revealed that Kim Chi was the one who called Trixie to go to Chicago and helped her get her first job, as according to Trixie, it was difficult for her to find one in Milwaukee. Before they went to Greyhounds, they listened to K-Pop music while on their way there.\n\nSeason 9 queen Jaymes Mansfield made a Michelle Visage puppet for her.[19]\n\nAfter Season 9 winner Sasha Velour, she's the second overall winner to not have the most challenge wins on her season, followed by Yvie Oddly on Season 11, Jaida Essence Hall on Season 12, Shea Couleé on All Stars 5, Kylie Sonique Love on All Stars 6 and Willow Pill on Season 14.\n\nAfter Jinkx Monsoon in Season 5 and Sasha Velour in Season 9, Trixie is the third winner not to have won a challenge within the first 3 weeks of her season. She won her 1st main challenge in the 5th episode of All Stars 3. She was followed by Season 10 winner, Aquaria and All Stars 6 winner, Kylie Sonique Love.\n\nShe is the first winner of a Drag Race season to land in the bottom more than once in her winning season, followed by Monét X Change, Shea Couleé and Kylie Sonique Love. All four queens landed in the bottom at least once by default because they were not in the top.\n\nShe is the only winner of a Drag Race season to have never placed highest in an episode during the season she won (although Trixie won two maxi challenges, she lost both lip-syncs following those challenges). She is thus the only All Stars winner (besides Chad Michaels, as All Stars 1 was a different format) to not win a lipsync for your legacy, excluding the final lipsync of the season.\n\nShe is the first Native American winner.\n\nShe is the first winner of a season to place in the bottom on Snatch Game.\n\nShe was later followed by Yvie Oddly from Season 11, Priyanka from Season 1 of Canada's Drag Race, Lawrence Chaney from Season 2 of RuPaul's Drag Race UK and Willow Pill from Season 14.\n\nShe has stated in UNHhhh that her backup for Snatch Game in All Stars 3 was Dolly Parton, but as she imitated her two episodes prior in the VH1 Divas Rusical, she was unable to play her.[20]\n\nTrixie is the most followed Drag Race contestant on Twitter.\n\nTrixie is one of two All Stars winners to beat someone who placed higher than them on their original season, later followed by Kylie Sonique Love (Kennedy Davenport & Pandora Boxx).\n\nTrixie participated in one of the first lip-syncs in herstory to feature two winners of a Drag Race season, in the fifth episode of All Stars 3 against BeBe Zahara Benet. Although Trixie hadn't won yet, it was at the time the only lip-sync featuring two Drag Race winners, though when Shea Couleé won All Stars 5 her lipsync against Sasha Velour from Season 9 (and thus before All Stars 3) became the first. These were followed by the final lipsync of All Stars 4 between the season's joint winners Trinity The Tuck and Monét X Change. If the three-way final lipsyncs of Seasons 4 and 5 are also counted, Sharon Needles and Chad Michaels and Jinkx Monsoon and Alaska respectively have also lipsynced against each other.\n\nOn May 2nd, 2020 she became the third queen to hit 2 million followers on Instagram, after Bianca Del Rio and Adore Delano. This makes her the first queen not to be on Season 6 to reach this milestone.\n\nOn August 4th, 2022 she became the first queen to hit 3 million followers on instagram.\n\nOn August 6, 2020, Trixie became the first queen to reach 1 million YouTube subscribers.\n\nAja revealed on Trinity The Tuck's Podcast Werk that BeBe Zahara Benet had chosen Trixie's lipstick in Episode 5 of All Stars 3.[21]\n\nThis makes Trixie the first winner of an All Stars season to have her lipstick chosen by a fellow contestant at some point during the competition.\n\nMonét X Change is the second All Stars winner to whom this happened, her lipstick being picked by Manila Luzon in the fourth episode of All Stars 4. Shea Couleé is the third, as Alexis Mateo and Mayhem Miller both picked her lipstick as part of the Rumocracy vote in the third episode of All Stars 5.\n\nTrixie and Katya co-hosted the YouTube Streamy Awards in 2020, and the two of them won the Streamy for Best Unscripted Series, which they were previously nominated for in the Show of the Year category in 2017.\n\nIn YouTube videos reviewing her runway looks from Season 7 and All Stars 3, Trixie revealed that...[22][23]\n\n...all her jewelry on Season 7 was made out of paper.\n\n...on All Stars 3, she borrowed her IQ Kitty look from BenDeLaCreme (because her original look had a print that was too close together to be easily seen on HD cameras).\n\n...the fox furs she used in her finale look from Shangela.\n\n...She also said that Katya briefly helped make the bodysuit she wore during the Kitty Girl performance.\n\n...the wig she wore during the Kitty Girl performance was made by Ariel Versace.\n\nOn February 2, 2021 it was announced that Trixie became a co-owner of \"This Is It!\", a gay bar in Wisconsin.[24]\n\nTrixie has a very large collection of Barbie dolls and she has a series on her channel where she shows them off by the decades they came out.[25]\n\nTrixie revealed on her podcast \"The Bald and The Beautiful\" Episode \"C*m Dump Millionaire with Priyanka\". From the $100,000 cash prize she won, she only received an approximation of $66,000 due to taxation, because it's considered as gambling.[26]\n\nTrixie is the only winner of All Stars...\n\n... to win the ball challenge.\n\n... to be in the bottom for the All Stars Edition of Snatch Game.\n\n... to not win any of their Lip Sync For Your Legacy lip-syncs.\n\n... to be eliminated and return and get eliminated again on their original season.\n\n... with two successors: Monét X Change and Trinity The Tuck.\n\nTrixie has the shortest reign of any All Stars winner, at 11 months (337 days). She is the only All Stars winner to not reign for at least a year.\n\nCoincidentally, her Milwaukee sister whom she is very close to, Jaida Essence Hall, is also the shortest reigning regular season winner.\n\nLaganja Estranja choreographed her \"Hello Hello\" Music Video[27]\n\nShe is the fourth Drag Race alumni, after Willam, Alaska and Phi Phi O'Hara, to be a guest judge on The Boulet Brothers' Dragula.\n\nBob The Drag Queen then followed, on the same season of Dragula.\n\nSome fans of Trixie call themselves \"Moving Parts\" after her song and documentary.\n\nHer blood type is O+[28]\n\nOn January 2022, Trixie became the first queen to reach 1 million followers on Twitter.\n\nShe also became the first queen from Season 7 to reach 1 million followers on Twitter.\n\nShe also became the first queen from All Stars 3 to reach 1 million followers on Twitter.\n\nTrixie spent $600 on her outfits for Season 7.[29]\n\nTrixie doesn’t and has never has Tucked in Drag.\n\nTrixie only won $60.000 dollars from winning All Stars 3, which is 40% less than the grand prize of the season.[30]\n\nTrixie is the only All Stars 3 challenge winner to never Lip Sync For Your Legacy against BenDeLaCreme.\n\nTrixie is the first winner to never win a lipsync, both on her original season and on All Stars. (Excluding the Lip Sync for the Crown).\n\nTrixie used to do shows with Kahmora Hall in Chicago, at a club called Berlin which has closed in 2023.[31]\n\nTrixie was offered a spot on All Stars 7 but turned it down.[16]\n\nTrixie was diagnosed with arthritis in 2024.[32]\n\nTrixie played baseball in middle school.[33]\n\nTrixie will be going on a 3-4 month hiatus from her career in July, August, September and October of 2024 and has said that she is \"probably not going to come back at the full speed of Trixie anymore.\"[34]\n\nTrixie was asked to participate on Traitors, but she turned it down.[35]\n\nGallery[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Season 7[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Season 7 Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race All Stars Season 3[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race All Stars Season 3 Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Holi-Slay Spectacular[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Holi-Slay Spectacular Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Season 10[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race Season 10 Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race All Stars Season 4[]\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race All Stars Season 4 Looks[]\n\nRuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race 1[]\n\nRuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race 1 Looks[]\n\nQueen of the Universe Season 1[]\n\nQueen of the Universe Season 1 Looks[]\n\nQueen of the Universe Season 2 Looks[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nAlbums[]\n\nAs Trixie Mattel[]\n\nYear Title Artwork Tracklist 2017 Two Birds\n\nMama Don't Make Me Put On The Dress Again\n\nMake Up Your Mind\n\nI Know You All Over Again\n\nSeen My Man\n\nI'll Wear Your Ring\n\nBluegrass\n\nSeen My Man - Wisconsin Demo [Live])\n\n2018 One Stone\n\nLittle Sister\n\nBreak Your Heart\n\nSoldier\n\nRed Side of The Moon\n\nMoving Parts\n\nThe Well\n\nWind Up Man\n\n2019 Trixie Mattel: Moving Parts\n\n(The Acoustic Soundtrack)\n\nMoving Parts (Guitar Version)\n\nBackwoods Barbie\n\nHeavy Crown\n\nHello, Goodbye, Hello\n\nKeep On The Sunny Side\n\nKitty Girl (AS3 Version)\n\n2020 Barbara\n\nMalibu\n\nWe Got The Look\n\nGirl Next Door\n\nJesse Jesse\n\nGold\n\nI Don't Have A Broken Heart\n\nI Do Like You\n\nStranger (cover of Lavender Country's I Can't Shake the Stranger Out of You)\n\n2022 The Blonde & Pink Albums\n\nThe Blonde Album:\n\nGoner\n\nBoyfriend\n\nC'mon Loretta\n\nLove You in HiFi\n\nHello Hello\n\nI Want You to Want Me (cover of Cheap Trick's I Want You to Want Me)\n\nNew Thing\n\nThe Pink Album:\n\nWhite Rabbit ft.
