        "text": "Tammie Brown made a name for herself on RuPaul's Drag Race, but the Corpus Christi-born drag queen has stretched her 10 minutes of fame into more than a decade.\n\nBorn Keith Glen Schubert, Brown is a drag performer, actor and singer who gained notoriety for being a contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race, a reality competition show where drag queens compete against each other.\n\nKnown for an eclectic style of humor with a mix of activism, Brown has become well-recognized within the Drag Race fan community.\n\nAhead of a performance at Club Iconic Friday, Sept. 14, Brown spoke to the Caller-Times via Instagram about starting drag in Corpus Christi, what it was like to live in Rockport during Hurricane Harvey and more.\n\nCaller-Times: For people who don’t know of you, could you describe yourself and your job?\n\nTammie Brown: Well for people that don’t know of me I am #CulturalQueen. I’m fortunate to be able to travel the world living my dream, my colorful dreams. I also like to do things that contribute to the environment and society as a whole. My job is to be a tough-match transvestite.\n\nCaller-Times: You were born in Corpus Christi. Can you tell me about growing up in this area and your start in drag?\n\nBrown: Well I was born on Ocean Drive at Spohn hospital Sept. 15, 1980. And I grew up over in Rockport-Fulton, Texas. I went to high school in Rockport-Fulton, Texas, graduated from Rockport-Fulton high school. Even lived in Mathis, Texas, Lake Corpus Christi for a little while in junior high. I started doing drag in my high school here at Rockport-Fulton high school and then later at Club Divas in Corpus Christi across from the courthouse.\n\nCaller-Times: So now you get on Drag Race around 2008. How’d you find out about RuPaul's Drag Race?\n\nBrown: I found out about the show because my creative partner Rodrigo Beroso informed me of it and said he was going to get me on the show, so within six months ... I got on the show.\n\nCaller-Times: Where do you think you’d be if you never got on the show?\n\nBrown: Well I think eventually I would’ve gotten on and if it not I’m sure I’d be here talking to you because it’s written in the stars. I’ve always been a star. A star is always a star.\n\nCaller-Times: But I know you moved back to Rockport a while ago. What prompted you to move there and if you’re still there how has it been?\n\nBrown: Well, actually I live in Fulton. I moved back here because I needed to ground myself. I feel grounded when I’m here and Los Angeles was becoming too much of a freeway for me. I had already felt that I had maxed out ...\n\nCaller-Times: So where were you during Hurricane Harvey? Was your home damaged?\n\nBrown: I am a Hurricane Harvey survivor. In fact, it was a miracle that I left the day before. I was on my way to Norway to do a private bachelor’s birthday party [as] my sister stayed behind and my mother was on her way to San Antonio, Texas. Long story short I believe that my practice in faith protected our house. I just love all of the oak trees here in Fulton.\n\nCaller-Times: What are you working on, what do you have coming up, is there anything you want people to know about?"
