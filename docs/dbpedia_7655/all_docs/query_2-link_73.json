        "text": "Drag queens have turned from niche performers to pop culture sensations thanks to shows such as RuPaul’s Drag Race. As well as having acts and shows of their own, popular drag queens are now walking catwalks and performing next to icons such as Madonna. Many are raking in the big bucks. So let’s take a look at seven of the world’s richest drag queens.\n\n1. RuPaul\n\nAs perhaps the most famous drag queen in the United States, RuPaul is believed to be worth $60 million. In an interview with Money, Ru confessed to spending up to $10,000 on a single gown. When asked how many $10,000 gowns he owns, Ru said, “Oh, I don’t know.”\n\n2. Trixie Mattel\n\nWith a net worth of around $10 million, Trixie Mattel has become a hugely successful business woman since winning RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars. As well as founding a cosmetic line and jumping at endorsement deals, Mattel has also starred in many TV shows, boosting her personal wealth.\n\n3. Courtney Act\n\nFollowing her success on Australian Idol and Drag Race Down Under, Courtney Act has been a busy bee and is now thought to be worth $5 million. She was part of the American Apparel Ad Girls campaign and went on to win Celebrity Big Brother UK. She also got a hosting job, fronting the UK’s first bisexual reality dating show - The Bi Life.\n\n4. Bianca Del Rio\n\nAs Drag Race’s Season Six winner and one of the most comedic drag acts of all time, Bianca Del Rio has amassed a $4 million fortune. She performs wherever Drag Race fans gather, and has sold out comedy shows from South Africa to Singapore. Drag-inspired acts are now global, with Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Priscilla The Party being two examples of international smash hits.\n\n5. Alyssa Edwards\n\nThis dancing diva is the owner of Beyond Belief Dance Company and starred in her own Netflix docuseries, Dancing Queen. Snagging some pretty awesome sponsorship deals along the way, Edwards now has a $3 million fortune.\n\n6. Chad Michaels\n\nWell-known for winning All Stars, Chad Michaels has raked in a tidy $3 million on a host of other adventures. From producing and performing in the Dreamgirls Revenue in California to touring with Farrah Moan in a tour celebrating the movie Burlesque, this drag queen renowned for her Cher impersonation has become hugely popular.\n\n7. Raven\n\nHaving appeared in season two of Drag Race and the first instalment of All Stars, Raven went on to earn big bucks as RuPaul’s personal make-up artist. Worth $2 million, Raven might cash in even more if rumours of her own competition show are true."
