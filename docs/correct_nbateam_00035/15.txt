Carlos Delfino scored a season-high 25 points against his former team, Drew Gooden had 20 points and 14 rebounds and the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a three-game losing streak, beating the Toronto Raptors 105-99 on Wednesday night.

Mike Dunleavy scored 16 of his 18 points in the second quarter and Stephen Jackson had 17 as the Bucks won for the seventh time in eight games against Toronto.

Delfino, who played for the Raptors in 2007-08, matched his season high with nine rebounds.

One night after scoring a season-low three points in a 107-105 loss to Phoenix, Bucks leading scorer Brandon Jennings was kept quiet again, scoring eight of his 11 points in the final quarter but making just three of 12 field-goal attempts.

DeMar DeRozan scored 25 points and James Johnson had 15 for the Raptors, who have lost three straight and five of six. Linas Kleiza scored 12 points and Leandro Barbosa 11, and Jose Calderon had 15 assists.

Milwaukee led 76-73 to begin the fourth, and pushed its lead to six points on a 3 by Delfino before Toronto's Rasual Butler made back-to-back 3's and Barbosa added a driving layup.

Jackson hit a 3 to restore Milwaukee's lead, but Kleiza hit two free throws to give Toronto a one-point edge.

The Bucks responded by taking the lead for good on a pair of free throws by Dunleavy with 6:55 left. Gooden made one of two and Jennings hit a 3 to make it 88-83 with 5:48 remaining.

Kleiza and Milwaukee's Larry Sanders were called for technicals after shoving each other under the Toronto basket midway through the fourth. Barbosa stepped between them to break up the minor scuffle.

Gooden had 13 points in the opening quarter but DeRozan had eight as Toronto scored 29 first-quarter points, a season high, to lead 29-28 after one. It marked the first time the Raptors had led after the first since Jan. 13 against Indiana. Toronto also lost that one, 95-90.

Dunleavy made six of seven shots in the second quarter, including three of four 3-pointers, and scored 16 points. Jackson added eight as the Bucks led 58-51 at the break.

Milwaukee's 58 points in the opening half were the most by a Raptors opponent this season.
