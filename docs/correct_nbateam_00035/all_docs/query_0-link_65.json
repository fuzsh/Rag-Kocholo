        "text": "The Canadian Press\n\n10/31/2007 11:15:11 PM\n\nTORONTO - Midway through the second quarter of the Toronto Raptors' season-opener, Jose Calderon threw up a high looping pass to Chris Bosh that the all-star forward finished with a resounding dunk.\n\nThe two-pronged point guard tandem of Calderon and T.J. Ford wanted to set the tone for the new season. They did just that as the Raptors began their quest for a second straight Atlantic Division title Wednesday with a 106-97 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n\"T.J. Ford and Jose Calderon did great,\" said Raptors coach Sam Mitchell. \"If you look at their stat line, it was unbelievable.\"\n\nFord had 14 points and 12 assists, while Calderon had 13 points and four assists. They each had just one turnover.\n\nAndrea Bargnani scored 20 points to top Toronto in the season-opener for both teams, while Chris Bosh had 16 points, and Anthony Parker added 13.\n\nAndre Iguodala led the Sixers with 23 points, while Kyle Korver had 20.\n\nThe Raptors nearly blew a 22-point third-quarter lead, up by only eight heading into the fourth quarter as the 76ers crept ever closer. A running jump shot by Iguodala pulled the visitors within 90-89 with 4:47 left.\n\nBargnani then sunk a three-pointer and was fouled on the play by Canadian Samuel Dalembert, and made the subsequent free throw for just the 14th four-point play in franchise history. That put Toronto back up by five and brought the capacity crowd of 19,800 at Air Canada Centre to its feet.\n\n\"They were an important four points,\" said Bargnani. \"I received a very nice pass, I was hoping it would come to me and I was a little lucky.\"\n\nFord drove to the basket to finish with a nifty finger roll with 1:46 left, then Jason Kapono, the former Miami Heat sharp-shooter Toronto signed in the off-season, connected on a long jumper to put Toronto up by nine, and the Raptors' held on for a season-opening win.\n\n\"We've got stuff we want to prove to ourselves,\" Ford said. \"We want to prove that we are a good basketball team, we are the division champions, and we're going to carry ourselves that way.\"\n\nFord and Calderon ran the offence with precision, picking up where they left off last season.\n\n\"We're great partners and we just try to play our game,\" Calderon said. \"The two of us, we look good out there. I'm happy when we play like we did tonight, and I think (Ford) thinks the same way.\"\n\nBosh had a decent night considering a knee injury limited him to 15 minutes over the final two pre-season games combined, and kept him out of the previous three games completely.\n\n\"It felt good to be back out there, but I'm not up to 30 minutes a game yet, so I just have to be patient with the whole situation,\" said Bosh.\n\nWith Bargnani leading the way, the Raptors showed off their offensive prowess, shooting 49 per cent.\n\nBut while Mitchell's stressed rebounding throughout the pre-season, the Sixers won the battle of the boards, outrebounding Toronto 47-35 and grabbing a couple of key boards in the final few minutes.\n\nThe Sixers shot 46 per cent on the night.\n\n\"We put ourselves in such a hole down 22 points,\" said Sixers coach Maurice Cheeks. \"Toronto is a good basketball team the way they spread the floor and kick the ball to different players.\"\n\nDalembert, a Montreal native, finished with four points and six rebounds. The Sixers centre was had played just one pre-season game because of a stress fracture in his foot.\n\nToronto came out strong, committing just a single turnover in the first quarter, and taking an eight-point lead off a basket by Kapono midway through the frame. But the Sixers held Toronto to just a field goal in the final 3:14 and the Raptors had a narrow 24-22 lead heading into the second.\n\nBoth teams connected on 67 per cent of its shots in a second quarter shootout, but Toronto managed to put some distance on the Sixers with a 17-4 run to lead 58-50 at halftime.\n\nBargnani had seven points in the third, including a layup with 6:04 left in the quarter that gave Toronto a 22-point lead. The Sixers outscored Toronto 12-4 to the end of the quarter cutting the Raptors' lead to 81-67 heading into the fourth.\n\nThe Raptors face two more Atlantic Division foes in their next two games. They'll travel to New Jersey to play the Nets on Friday, then host the revamped Boston Celtics on Sunday.\n\nNotes: The Raptors handed out several awards before the game: Bosh for all-NBA second team, and Jorge Garbajosa and Bargnani as all-rookie first team. Mitchell was honoured for being named The Sporting News NBA coach of the year, and GM Bryan Colangelo as NBA executive of the year. . .

On defence, the Bucks held Toronto star Chris Bosh to one point, his lowest total since being held scoreless against Seattle on Feb. 12, 2004. The Raptors' starting scored just 28 points.\n\nBosh, who nursed a nagging left knee injury through the pre-season, wasn't willing to chalk his struggles up to conditioning.\n\n\"I am healthy enough to play basketball,\" Bosh said. \"If I'm on the court, there is no excuse. I just have to keep playing.\"\n\nA team official offered Bosh a stat sheet after the game, but Bosh said he didn't need it.\n\nRaptors coach Sam Mitchell wasn't willing to nitpick Bosh's play.\n\n\"I am not going to talk about an individual guy,\" Mitchell said. \"It was a whole team effort, not just one guy.\"\n\nJuan Dixon led the Raptors with 20 points on a night that, combined with an overtime loss to Boston on Sunday, added up to a significant letdown from their 106-69 victory over New Jersey last Friday.\n\n\"I told our guys we proved two things: We're good enough to win by 30, but we're also good enough to lose by 30,\" Mitchell said. \"We have got to come out ready to play. Hopefully it was just one of those nights.\"\n\nFor a while, it looked like the Bucks were going to have their best shooting night in more than two decades. Milwaukee was shooting over 65 per cent with five minutes left in the game, but got sloppy at the end. Milwaukee hasn't shot 65 per cent or higher for a game since a victory over Sacramento on Dec. 15, 1985.\n\nWith Bosh limited to 10 minutes in the first half after committing two early fouls, the Bucks took their first double-figure lead with a 14-0 run late in the first quarter.\n\nMilwaukee led 59-39 after a three-point play by Andrew Bogut with 2:36 left in the second quarter. Toronto then went on a 9-2 run to close within 13, but Williams hit a jumper at the horn to give the Bucks a 63-48 lead.\n\nMilwaukee shot 67.5 from the field in the first half, including 76.2 per cent in the first quarter.\n\nBosh's only point came on a free throw with 5:22 left in the second quarter. He playing sparingly in the second half.\n\nMilwaukee went on a 17-3 run in the third quarter that included six points by Bucks rookie Yi Jianlian and was capped by Mason's 10th straight field goal attempt without a miss.\n\nMitchell wished his team's defence had made life a little harder on Mason, but admitted that some of the shots were spectacular.\n\n\"Some of the shots he hit - the fadeaway, one-handed jump shot, hook shot - you have got to give him credit,\" Mitchell said.\n\nMichael Redd added 17 points for the Bucks, while Williams scored 13, Yi and Bogut both had 12 and Bobby Simmons added 11. Bogut had 11 rebounds.\n\nNotes: Milwaukee G Charlie Bell bruised his right quadriceps in the second quarter but was able to return. . The Raptors became the first team in NBA history to hit at least one three-pointer in 700 straight games. They set the NBA record when the streak reached 595 in 2006. . Vin Baker holds the Bucks' franchise record with a 13-for-13 shooting game in 1997. . In a text message to the Bucks' PR staff, Krystkowiak said his wife and daughters were doing well after her delivery.\n\nhttp://tsn.ca/nba/news_story/?ID=222316&hubname=\n\nLondon 2005\n\nToronto 2011 night 2\n\nHamilton 2011\n\nLondon 2013\n\n0\n\nRaptors Bounce Bulls in Chi-Town\n\nNovember 10, 2007\n\nBox Score | Photo Gallery | Video: Game Day | Coach's Edge | Game in Six Minutes\n\n(PHILADELPHIA, AP) - The Bulls' dismal start has T.J. Ford confused.\n\nCarlos Delfino scored 16 points and Chris Bosh added 14 points and six rebounds to help the Toronto Raptors beat the listless Chicago Bulls 101-71 on Saturday night.\n\nThe Raptors made quick work out of the Bulls despite playing their fourth game in five nights.\n\n``What's going on with this team?'' Ford said.\n\nFord had 14 assists and Andrea Bargnani scored 14 points for Toronto, which had its largest win against Chicago in franchise history.\n\nLeading 41-30 at the half, the Raptors opened up the third quarter by outscoring the Bulls 14-1 for a 52-31 lead. Anthony Parker hit a three and Jamario Moon stole Luol Deng's bad pass and took it for a breakaway dunk to give the Raptors a 21-point lead that started the boos from the sellout crowd.\n\nToronto coach Sam Mitchell started Moon to match up against Deng. It was the first start in the league for the 27-year old rookie and he held Deng to 2-of-7 shooting.\n\n``We thought we could use his defence against this team,'' Mitchell said. ``I started him because I felt like taking a roll of the dice, I would take a chance tonight.''\n\nBulls coach Scott Skiles cleared his starters from the floor with 9:35 left in the third quarter, but it didn't help as Parker immediately hit another three against the Chicago reserves. Deng, Tyrus Thomas, Ben Wallace, Ben Gordon and Hinrich never returned to the game.\n\n``I never want to do that. On a night when the boo-birds are out I don't want to embarrass the group like that,'' Skiles said. ``I thought I would take a gamble right there to see if someone could come into the game and be a catalyst for us. I felt like in unison that group was not performing really well.''\n\nAndres Nocioni led Chicago with 20 points.\n\nThe vibe hasn't been good in Chicago since the Bulls were involved in Kobe Bryant trade rumours less than two weeks ago. General manager John Paxson put to rest the Kobe Bryant trade rumours less than a week ago, but some fans continued to chant ``Kobe! Kobe! Kobe!'' while the Bulls were down 30-plus points in the third quarter.\n\n``Obviously the Kobe chants is something that never seems like it will never stop being talked about. We understand the crowd's frustration. We're very frustrated as well,'' Hinrich said.\n\nFord thought the chants have been wearing on the Bulls.\n\n``I'm pretty sure for what it seemed it looked like it kind of affected the guys, but I'm not sure. I'm not in their locker room.''\n\nb> Notes: Before Saturday's game, the Raptors dropped 15 of their last 17 games against Chicago. ... The restless Bulls fans started the wave in the fourth quarter.\n\nhttp://www.nba.com/raptors/news/recap_111007.html\n\nLondon 2005\n\nToronto 2011 night 2\n\nHamilton 2011\n\nLondon 2013\n\n0\n\nJazz outlast Raptors in a thriller\n\nAssociated Press\n\n11/14/2007 10:28:42 PM\n\nTORONTO - Rookie Jamario Moon and utility player Kris Humphries were the two bright spots on an otherwise ugly night for the Toronto Raptors.\n\nAnd that says plenty about the Raptors' performance in a 92-88 loss to the red-hot Utah Jazz on Wednesday.\n\nWith the Raptors' shooting continuing to run cold, and big men Chris Bosh and Andrea Bargnani having off nights, Moon scored 15 points and played a team-high 33 minutes, while Humphries grabbed 14 rebounds against his former team.\n\n''We've got to have more people than those two young guys,'' Raptors coach Sam Mitchell said afterwards. ''We count on them to give us energy, and give us minutes, but not to win us basketball games.''\n\nRelated Info\n\nRaptors Roundup\n\nAnthony Parker scored 19 points to top Toronto (4-4).\n\nCarlos Boozer had 23 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Jazz (7-2) to their fifth straight victory, while Deron Williams added 22 points.\n\nWhile the Jazz boasts the best offence in the league - they came into the game averaging 111.9 points a night - the visitors led by a low-scoring 64-59 heading into the fourth quarter of an ugly affair for both teams Wednesday.\n\n''You take any win you can,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. ''People don't realize how difficult it is to win.''\n\nThe Jazz led by as much as seven points in the final few minutes before six straight points from Bosh - including two big dunks - cut Utah's lead to 87-85 with 46 seconds on the clock.\n\nA three-pointer by T.J. Ford with 18 seconds left pulled Toronto to within 89-88. But Williams connected on a pair of free throws, and Ford couldn't get a decent shot off in the final few seconds, sending the Raptors to their third loss at home this season. Toronto is 3-1 on the road.\n\n''Eventually we want to get a roll at home and start doing a better job of protecting our home court,'' said Bosh, who finished with 14 points and seven rebounds.\n\nFord finished with 13 points and eight assists.\n\nThe game wasn't pretty with the Raptors committing numerous mind-numbing turnovers - 17 giveaways that cost them 10 points - drawing groans from the Air Canada Centre crowd of 17,337.\n\nThe Raptors outrebounded the Jazz 50-46. But once again, they had trouble shooting, connecting on just 39 per cent of their shots. Utah shot 43 per cent.\n\n''It's nothing we haven't seen before,'' said Bosh. ''We've been through episodes where guys can't make shots, or as a team we're just in a funk from the field. But you know what? We just have to keep going. That's all I can say.''\n\nUntil the final few minutes, Bosh hadn't had one of his better nights, shooting just 5-for-12 from the field. His frontcourt partner Andrea Bargnani had a horrible night, chucking up 11 shots and making just one to finish with two points and three boards.\n\n''Andrea needs to worry about the other things - rebounding, playing defence, running on the break - and then the shots will come,'' Mitchell said. ''If you come into a basketball game looking to score, you're going to struggle sometimes. Don't even think about scoring.''\n\nMoon had a strong night in just his second start of his career, but shrugged off his performance.\n\n''We lost, so it wasn't too good,'' said Moon. ''After a loss, you don't really think about what you did, you think of the things you could have done to make a different outcome of the game.''\n\nThe 27-year-old high-flying rookie has been one of the feel-good stories on the Raptors' young season, earning a spot on Toronto's roster after toiling for several teams in the minor leagues, including the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association.\n\nHumphries put in a solid 27 minutes, diving to the floor for numerous loose balls.\n\nRasho Nesterovic had eight rebounds in 20 minutes, leaving the game with a sprained right ankle midway through the third quarter.\n\nThe Jazz was playing without Matt Harpring (flu bug).\n\nThe Raptors were coming off a two-game road trip, beating the Bulls 101-71 Saturday in Chicago, and winning 105-103 in Philadelphia the previous night.\n\nParker led the way with 10 points in the first quarter as Toronto raced out to a seven-point lead. The Raptors were up 22-18 to end the first.\n\nThe Raptors' shooting dropped off in the second quarter - they shot just 5-for-22. Toronto trailed as much as seven in the quarter and Utah had a 39-36 lead at the break.\n\nThe Raptors fought back in the third, a bank shot from Parker with four minutes left in the quarter giving them a three-point lead. The Jazz responded with a 10-1 run to end the quarter.\n\nNOTES: The game was the Raptors' first of three straight at home. The Raptors host Indiana on Friday and Golden State on Sunday. . . Toronto FC coach Mo Johnston had a courtside seat.\n\nhttp://tsn.ca/nba/news_story/?ID=222887&hubname=nba\n\nLondon 2005\n\nToronto 2011 night 2\n\nHamilton 2011\n\nLondon 2013\n\n0\n\nBosh paces Raptors past Indiana\n\nAssociated Press\n\n11/17/2007 1:15:30 AM\n\nTORONTO - With the clock ticking down to end the third quarter, Anthony Parker glanced at the basket from way down the court, then unleashed a spectacular 66-foot shot that sailed in.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors' shots were finally falling Friday, and the result was a 110-101 victory over the Indiana Pacers.\n\n''I thought it had a chance and it looked like it was on line, and after I shot it I yelled, `Come on, give me something,' I had just missed a free throw and a little five-foot floater,'' said Parker, who finished with 15 points.\n\n''I think (the shot) gave us some momentum, a little bounce to our step.''\n\n''It's a relief,'' Bosh said on winning at home. ''But we're not worried, we don't get too frantic. We have to do a better job of being aggressive, we have to do a better job of playing defence, and once we do those things, we're going to defend our home court just fine. I think tonight is going to start it off for us.''\n\nSix Raptors scored in double figures as Jose Calderon had 15 points and 10 assists, while fellow point guard T.J. Ford finished with 15 points and seven assists. Jason Kapono added 12 points and Carlos Delfino, 11.\n\nJamaal Tinsley and Troy Murphy had 20 points apiece to top the Pacers, who dropped to 3-6 with their sixth straight loss.\n\nThe Raptors managed to overcome another sluggish start. After trailing by 11 in the first quarter, they took their first lead in the second, then opened the third quarter with a 14-4 run. Parker tossed up his long-distance shot to end the quarter that brought the capacity crowd of 19,800 at the Air Canada Centre to its feet and sent Toronto into the fourth quarter with an 81-74 lead.\n\nA three-pointer by Delfino, followed by a long jumper by Parker gave Toronto a 99-90 advantage with 3:20 left to play. The Pacers pulled to within three points with just over a minute to go, but Calderon sunk a three with 49 seconds left to put the home team back up by six and ice the win for Toronto.\n\nThe Raptors shot 47 per cent on the night, a huge improvement over the shooting woes that had plagued them in the previous few home games. They shot 12-for-23 from three-point range.\n\nThe Pacers outrebounded Toronto 47-35 and outscored the Raptors 30-18 in the paint.\n\nBut a win at home meant plenty to Toronto, who were 3-1 on the road, but 1-3 at home before Friday night. Last season, the Raptors never lost more than two in a row in the friendly confines of the ACC.\n\nBosh was solid, going hard to the basket from the opening whistle. He shot 12-for-13 from the free throw line.\n\n''I wanted to start off the game aggressive,'' Bosh said. ''By me driving, I think we got more open shots, we were able to step right to it and knock them down. I think if I begin the game aggressive and they start to clog up the lane, that will give our three-point shooters a chance to knock some down.''\n\nJorge Garbajosa, who'd been cemented to bench, played a season-high 24 minutes and scored eight points, but it was his intensity on the defensive end that stood out.\n\n''I don't feel myself that important that I have to open the eyes of anybody, I just do my job,'' Garbajosa said. ''It is easy. When I come into the court, I try to do the best I can, sometimes I play more, sometimes I don't play, but it's not my job to choose when I play.''\n\nAndrea Bargnani's troubles continue. The second-year centre picked up three fouls in his first five minutes and never saw the floor again.\n\nThe Pacers, meanwile, were reeling after yet another loss.\n\n''I don't know what it is,'' Tinsley said. ''I've been here seven years and it seems like the same thing. It's frustrating when you go out there and play good for one half and in the second half, you lay an egg. We've go to get together some day, somehow. It's getting frustrating. You get tired of hearing the same old thing.''\n\nDanny Granger was assessed a flagrant foul midway through the third quarter. Jamario Moon was in the air about to sink a fastbreak dunk when Granger lunged at him from behind, sending the Raptor rookie sprawling into the basket stanchion.\n\nThe Raptors had yet another shaky start, hitting just four of their first 15 shots and trailed by as much as 11 points in the first quarter. The Pacers took a 30-22 lead into the second.\n\nToronto rallied in the second, shooting 50 per cent from the field, and a three-pointer by Garbajosa put the Raptors up 46-45 for their first lead of the game. The Pacers led 56-53 at halftime.\n\nFord led the way with 11 points in the third quarter, as the Raptors outscored the Pacers 28-18 in the frame and led 81-74 with a quarter left to play.\n\nNOTES: Maceo Baston started in place of Rasho Nesterovic, who sprained his right ankle Wednesday against Utah. . . The Raptors host Golden State on Sunday before heading on the road for three games, at Dallas, Memphis and Cleveland. . . Toronto FC striker Danny Dichio was at the game, as was Toronto Argonauts slotback Arland Bruce III.\n\nhttp://tsn.ca/nba/news_story/?ID=223049&hubname=\n\nLondon 2005\n\nToronto 2011 night 2\n\nHamilton 2011\n\nLondon 2013\n\n0"
