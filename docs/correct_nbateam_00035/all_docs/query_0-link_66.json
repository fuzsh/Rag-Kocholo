        "text": "One day after his country lost their bronze medal game to Russia, Argentinian small forward Carlos Delfino has reportedly signed a one-year deal with the Houston Rockets. Reports from the Houston Chronicle say the Rockets will hold a second-year team option on Delfino as well.\n\nDelfino scored 15 points and pulled down six rebounds in Sunday's loss, playing all 40 minutes of the contest. In the NBA, Delfino is entering his eighth season of play and will suit up for his fourth team. He averaged nine points and four rebounds last season for the Bucks, playing in 54 of the team's 66 games.\n\nThe small forward will join a rather young Houston Rockets roster. His veteran experience should help fellow wings and forwards Jeremy Lamb, Royce White, and Terrence Jones, all of whom the Rockets drafted this year, as well as work somewhat to replace fellow Argentinian Luis Scola. Delfino is a career 40% field-goal shooter and has averaged 7.7 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.7 assists over his career."
