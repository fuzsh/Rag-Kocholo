        "text": "I remember the easy confidence of her smile, the gentle elegance of her hands, the refined warmth of her voice. But what I remember most about Bree was the look of fear in her eyes. Bree had started to realize her world was unraveling. And for a woman who despised loose ends, that was unacceptable.\n\nMary Alice Young\n\nBree Weston (née Mason, previously Van de Kamp and Hodge) was Wisteria Lane's resident neurotic and perfectionist homemaker, whose strong resolve and proper demeanor were both her greatest assets, as well as the source of nearly all her personal trouble. She describes herself as the domestic housewife out of her close group of precious friends. Bree is not who she seems to be, and as portrayed on the show, not who she seems to be.\n\nA cross between Martha Stewart-on-steroids and a Stepford wife, Bree's efforts to maintain her plastic existence quickly collapsed as she dealt with such obstacles in her life as family drama, widowhood, alcoholism, a nervous breakdown, the loss of her business and divorce.\n\nThrown into a midlife crisis leaving her sure only of her ability to deliver a basket of muffins to her neighbors, Bree evolved from a cold and prudish woman with severe moral values into a more loose, sexually inventive and promiscuous one.\n\nFinally able to accept the faults in her life, realizing her flaws only make her real and human, Bree weds the love of her life, leaves the lane and her history behind and relocates to Kentucky, where she becomes a conservative socialite and member of the state legislature.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nBree had spent most of her life feeling guilty. As a child, she felt guilty about not getting straight A's. As a teenager, she felt guilty about letting her boyfriend go to second base. And as a newly-wed, she felt guilty about taking three weeks to get out her thank-you cards.\n\nMary Alice Young\n\nBree was born to Henry and Mrs. Mason, a wealthy conservative couple, in Rhode Island. The Masons moved around a lot during Bree's childhood, yet she found solitude in the company of her three pet dogs - Coco, Taffy and Munchie. (\"In a World Where the Kings Are Employers\")\n\n10-year-old Bree. (\"Women and Death\")\n\nBree's mother, a repressed uptight housewife, encouraged the use of 'a mask' - a face you wear when you don't want people to know how you're feeling - and taught Bree from a young age that if she hid her emotions, she'd have power over men. Bree was oblivious to the fact that her father had an affair with his secretary, which had alienated her parents from one another. (\"Women and Death\")\n\nLater, at age 10, Bree's life was forever changed when her mother was hit by a drunken driver. Left home alone while her mother was rushed to hospital, Bree spent hours washing the blood off the road and driveway. Her mother died from her injuries. Following this, Bree began to close herself off from the outside world, and continued to repress her emotions, and presented the illusion of perfection to those who saw her. (\"Come in, Stranger\")\n\nA teenage Bree and a high-school boyfriend. (\"Guilty\")\n\nShortly after his wife's death, Bree's father became strict with his daughter and insisted on good behavior and eventually molded her into his image of the 'perfect lady.' (\"Who Can Say What's True?\") Henry Mason remarried, presumably to his mistress, Eleanor. Bree and her step-mother did not get along and Bree found herself having to work extremely hard for every kind word she received from the appearance-orientated Eleanor, and eventually began to resent her because of her ridiculously high standards. (\"Don't Look at Me\")\n\nBree and Rex's wedding photo. (\"Sunday in the Park with George\")\n\nBree went on to attend Lake Forest College (near Chicago) to get away from her demanding step-mother. In her freshman year, she met Rex Van de Kamp while attending a campus Young Republican meeting were Rex was giving a speech. The two connected the moment they met; after their meeting the two went to a diner, where they stayed up until 2:00 AM talking about immigration, gun control, and state government.\n\nBree and new-born Andrew. (\"Live Alone and Like It\")\n\nAt the time, Bree was involved in a serious relationship with another man, Ty Grant, but quickly ended her relationship with him in order to begin dating Rex. This caused stress between Bree and her family, who did not approve of Rex as a suitor for their daughter. (\"Your Fault\")\n\nShortly thereafter, the two married. The couple took their honeymoon in Italy (\"Sunday in the Park with George\") and upon their return, Bree became pregnant with the first of her two children by Rex, Andrew, who was born in 1988. The following year, Danielle, the couple's second child, was born.\n\nI met Bree Van de Kamp the first day she moved to Wisteria Lane. There are certain people who, when you meet them, can't help but make a delightful first impression. Bree was not one of them.\n\nMary Alice Young\n\nThe Van de Kamps move to Wisteria Lane. (\"Remember, Part 2\")\n\nIn 1994, the Van de Kamps moved to Fairview to the picturesque suburban neighborhood, Wisteria Lane. On moving day, Bree introduced herself to Mary Alice Young, after forcing Andrew to apologize to her after he stole her garden frog statue. Later, Bree meets Susan Mayer, Lynette Scavo and Gabrielle Solis and the women all quickly befriend one another. (\"Remember, Part 1\")\n\nIt is around this time that Bree and Rex's marriage begins to become strained. Rex comes to resent Bree's repression of her emotions and obsessive devotion to appearing perfect, while Bree is frequently humiliated by her husband's unloving and detached nature. Throughout their marriage, Bree honored her mother's philosophy of 'the mask.' (\"Women and Death\")\n\nAfter Rex advised her to get a job and make her own money, Bree began penning a cookbook in between her household chores. However, she gives up on her plans of getting it completed and published once Rex teases her about her ambitions and skills as a cook. Disheartened, Bree disposed of the book manuscript and her recipes. (\"The Best Thing That Ever Could Have Happened\")\n\nSeason 1[]\n\n(2004-2005)\n\nBree Van de Kamp, who lives next door, brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch. Bree was known for her cooking. And for sewing her own clothes. And for doing her own gardening. And for reupholstering her own furniture. Yes, Bree's many talents were known throughout the neighborhood, and everyone on Wisteria Lane thought of Bree as the perfect wife and mother. Everyone, that is, except her own family.\n\nMary Alice Young\n\nAfter the breakdown of her marriage, Bree cries privately in a restroom. (\"Pilot\")\n\nBree and her family attend Mary Alice Young's wake and although they appear perfect, it quickly becomes apparent that her emotional coldness and obsession with appearance has made her family resent her. To make matters worse, Rex asks her for a divorce. While at a diner, Bree accidentally poisons Rex by putting onions, to which he is deathly allergic, in his salad, and he suffers a reaction and collapses. Rex is rushed to hospital, and when Bree visits him, he accuses her of being emotionally unavailable and obsessed with achieving domestic perfection. Bree is clearly upset by his words and retreats to the hospital bathroom, where she breaks down into tears. The next day, while packing up Mary Alice's belongings, Bree and her friends find a mysterious blackmail note.(\"Pilot\")\n\nDr. Goldfine meets the Van de Kamps.(\"Ah, But Underneath\")\n\nAttempting to salvage her marriage, Bree hires renowned couple counselor, Dr. Albert Goldfine. During their first session, Rex is vocal about his issues, but Bree is less reluctant and instead rambles on with small talk. Her obsessive-compulsive manner takes hold when she spots a torn button on Goldfine's suit and insists on re-sewing it. Bree and Goldfine chat; she says that the issues with the marriage aren't entirely her fault and that Rex should be more grateful for everything Bree does. During the next session, Goldfine suggests Rex be more thankful for all of his wife's hard-work, much to Bree's approval. (\"Ah, But Underneath\")\n\nDinner party gone awry: Rex leaves after being humiliated by his wife.(\"Pretty Little Picture\")\n\nBree covers-up her and Rex's problems from her friends believing they'll mock her and view her as \"weak\". However, while throwing a dinner-party, Rex lets it slip that they're in counselling and Bree is outraged. She publicly embarrasses Rex with a shameful secret - \"Rex cries after he ejaculates.\" - in retaliation. Rex decides to move out. Upset over recent events, Bree rushes to Dr. Goldfine's office where she mistakenly stumbles upon a tape labeled \"Young, Mary Alice\". Bree snatches the tape while Goldfine is out of the room hoping it might shed some light on her friend's suicide.(\"Pretty Little Picture\")\n\nBree embarrasses Andrew by joining him at his favorite strip-club. (\"Who's That Woman?\")\n\nWith Rex living out of a motel, naturally, both Andrew and Danielle become curious about their father's whereabouts. Bree is reluctant to tell them the truth and instead creates up nonsensical stories to cover up his disappearance from the household. Andrew becomes particularly angry over this and accuses Bree of having \"sent his father away\". With Andrew having gone out without telling her, Bree searches his room and finds an address for a strip club. Bree sneaks up behind Andrew and his friends at the club and gives a long lecture on how strippers are people as well.(\"Who's That Woman?\")\n\nBree talks to Rex about her fears of being alone. (\"Come in, Stranger\")\n\nBree finds herself left alone in the house for the first time in 10 years when Andrew and Danielle go away on a camping trip and with Rex living at the motel. To avoid the loneliness of eating alone, she invites Zach Young over and the two have an informative and fascinating conversation about the deaths of their mothers. Zach tells Bree that he knows why his mother killed herself and confesses that it was something that he did, before getting panicked and leaving. Bree, desperate for more information from Zach, and knowing his love for the holidays, invites him over to try out Christmas recipes. However, much to her surprise, Bree is invited out on a dinner-date by Rex, in an attempt to reconcile, and she is forced to cancel her plans with Zach last minute. Subsequently, a disturbed Zach breaks into the Van de Kamp home and decorates it with Christmas ornaments. (\"Come in, Stranger\")\n\nIn an attempt to rekindle their love life, Bree tries to seduce Rex. (\"Running to Stand Still\")\n\nDuring a counselling session, Goldfine suggests that Bree and Rex seek the help of a sex surrogate in order to rekindle their love life. Bree is horrified at this recommendation. Later, while dining alone, Bree spots Dr. Goldfine and decides to continue their session on sex (in excruciating detail), much to Goldfine's embarrassment. Following this, Bree surprises Rex at his motel room when she arrives in a fur coat. She quickly disrobes, revealing sexy lingerie, and the two begin making love. Lying beside the bed is a half-eaten burrito, which is moments away from dripping onto the carpet. Bree tries to ignore it but ultimately has to stop having sex with Rex to tidy up the mess. Rex is furious with Bree's obsession with cleanliness and asks her to leave. (\"Running to Stand Still\")\n\nBree and Rex announce their plans to divorce to Andrew and Danielle. (\"Anything You Can Do\")\n\nAndrew continues acting out and gets in serious trouble at school, while Bree and Rex only add to the mix by announcing their plans to divorce. Bree is upset when both Andrew and Danielle decide to move out and live with their father, who has since began attempts to buy the love of his children with expensive gifts, including a convertible car for Andrew. Bree demands that Andrew and Danielle refuse to accept the gifts or else they will not be allowed entry back into the house; she has the locks changed. Danielle gives in but Andrew furiously speeds off in his new car. Later that evening, after a brawl with Rex, a drunken Andrew returns home but accidentally hits Carlos Solis' mother, Juanita, on the way. Bree is frozen in shock when she learns of Andrew's involvement in the hit-and-run. (\"Anything You Can Do\")\n\nThe plan is set in motion as Bree and Rex watch a criminal rob the incriminating evidence - Andrew's car. (\"Guilty\")\n\nWith Mama Solis in a deep coma, Bree attempts to find a solution to save her son from life in prison. After reading through the Bible and finding a way to deal with her guilt, Bree concludes that they have to dispose of the car, as the police might discover DNA. She suggests taking the car to a bad part of town, leaving the keys in the ignition and the doors unlocked. That way, if the police don't find it they will receive the insurance money and if they do, it wasn't in their possession and anyone could have hit Mrs. Solis. During the early hours of the morning, Bree and Rex follow the plan, and after a short wait, a criminal steals the car. Bree is relieved. However, when Andrew shows no remorse about almost killing an elderly woman, Bree worries her son is becoming a monster. (\"Guilty\")\n\nBree is furious when she learns of Andrew's marijuana habit. (\"Suspicious Minds\")\n\nBree suggests to Rex that they make Andrew quit the swim team, the only thing he is truly passionate about, in order to punish him for the hit-and-run. She hopes doing so would finally make him understand the severity of the crime he has committed. Rex is against this because it means Andrew would lose his chance at an athletic scholarship, but Bree is willing to risk it in order to make sure her son grows up with any trace of humanity inside him. Later, Bree catches Andrew smoking marijuana and she anonymously reports Andrew to the school and gets his locker searched. Andrew is punished by being thrown off of the school swim team. (\"Suspicious Minds\")\n\nBree confronts Maisy. (\"Come Back to Me\")\n\nUnbeknown to Bree, Rex is secretly having an affair with a domiciliary prostitute, Maisy Gibbons. While Maisy is performing as a dominatrix, Rex suffers a heart-attack and is rushed to hospital. Bree is called to the hospital and sees that Maisy signed the admission form and goes to confront her; Maisy says that Rex still loves Bree, but he has sexual needs that he is afraid to discuss with her. When Rex awakes following his operation, Bree tells him she is glad he didn't die - she is going to find the most vindictive lawyer she can and eviscerate him, taking his money, his family and his dignity - she wants revenge for his betrayal. She files for divorce. (\"Come Back to Me\")\n\nBree invites her pharmacist, George Williams, out for dinner. (\"Move On\")\n\nBree refuses to let Rex return home to recover once he is discharged from hospital, however, she is quickly emotionally blackmailed into taking him back by Andrew. While picking up Rex's medication, Bree asks her pharmacist, George Williams, out on a date. He accepts and Bree later parades him in front of Rex, who clearly sees through her attempt to make him jealous. When Andrew finds out about Bree's date, he is furious with her...until Bree tells him of his father's affair. Andrew urges her to kick Rex out but Bree decides to continue nursing him back to health because it is the right thing to do. (\"Move On\")\n\nBree and George go on a date. (\"Every Day a Little Death\")\n\nBree continues her relationship with George, in an effort to make Rex jealous. The two go on a date to the park and share a picnic - George gives Bree a present, a WWII 9-millimeter Luger P08. Bree, being in the NRA and a collector of fire-arms, is delighted. Bree then takes George out to a small farm to teach him how to shoot a gun. As she instructs him, he attempts to kiss her. A surprised Bree steps back quickly and George shoots himself in the foot. George loses a toe and Bree goes to the hospital to apologize - she is still married to Rex and was thus reluctant to kiss George. (\"Every Day a Little Death\")\n\nBree learns of Rex's S&M fetish. (\"Love is in the Air\")\n\nIn the middle of divorce negotiations, Rex suggests to Bree that they stop all of their fighting and sort things out - Bree is hesitant, but decides to continue with the divorce. She tells him she wants revenge, possibly by conducting her own affair. Bree pays a late-night visit to a small diner to clear her head. She bumps into George and asks his advice; he tells her that she should forgive Rex. (\"Your Fault\")\n\nBree tells Dr. Goldfine she's happy she and Rex are back together, but there's something he's still not telling her, which is why he had the affair. Taking Goldfine's advice, Bree pushes Rex to tell her what his secret is and he finally admits it - he's into S&M. Bree is reluctant to go along, but finally agrees. (\"Love is in the Air\")\n\nBree and the newly-discovered condom. (\"Impossible\")\n\nBree finds a condom in the laundry and believes that Rex is still cheating. Rex denies this, and informs his wife that he isn't the only male in the house - Bree worries Andrew is having sex. Over dinner, however, it is revealed that the condom belongs to Danielle, who is planning to give up her virginity to John Rowland. Bree then visits John at his apartment and asks him a favor: to break up with her daughter...and to be brutal. (\"Impossible\")\n\nBree attempts to bribe Maisy to save the Van de Kamp reputation. (\"The Ladies Who Lunch\")\n\nAfter Maisy Gibbons is arrested for prostitution, everyone in the neighborhood begins dishing the dirt and Bree is worried that Rex's name will come up. Especially when she hears that Maisy kept a book of all her clients. She visits Maisy in jail and asks her to take Rex's name out of the book. She's willing to pay her $14,000 for the favor, but Maisy refuses. Later, Bree and Rex go out to eat at the country club, but are put off when everyone starts staring at them. They realize the secret is out, but stay and eat their meal with as much dignity as possible. Bree then cancels her country club membership out of embarrassment. (\"The Ladies Who Lunch\")\n\nBree watches on as Andrew is taken away. (\"There Won't Be Trumpets\")\n\nAndrew is expelled from school and Bree insists they send him to a juvenile detention center. Rex is reluctant until he catches Andrew being violent towards Bree and eventually changes his mind. The next morning, they inform Andrew of their plans and two escorts arrive to pick him up. As Andrew tries to escape, Bree rushes to reassure him everything will be all right. Andrew spits in her face. Undaunted, Bree tells him that no matter what he does, she'll always love him, as he is taken away. (\"There Won't Be Trumpets\")\n\nBree learns of her son's homosexuality. (\"Children Will Listen\")\n\nBree has a crisis about whether she's a good mother or not when it's time to visit Andrew at the detention center. She doesn't want to go but Rex talks her into it. Andrew doesn't want to see her and she assumes it's because he hates her. Stuck with the truly terrible mothers outside, Bree eventually storms in and demands Andrew to admit that she's a good mother. Rex informs his wife that Andrew asked to talk to him alone because he thinks he might be gay. Bree is shocked. (\"Children Will Listen\")\n\nBree and Rex bring Andrew home from detention camp and Bree arranges a dinner with the church's pastor, Reverend Sikes, who tries to convince Andrew into changing his sexuality. Bree tells Andrew if he doesn't change he will go to Hell. (\"Live Alone and Like It\")\n\nBree fears Andrew will go to Hell. (\"Live Alone and Like It\")\n\nBree and Rex unexpectedly run into George. Rex is extremely rude and Bree tries to make amends by visiting George in the pharmacy. He lies and tells her that he has found a girlfriend, Ginger who stacks the shelves. Bree is glad George has moved on and invites him to Carlos Solis' farewell party. When Rex sees George at the party, he pushes both him and Bree into the swimming pool. (\"Fear No More\")\n\nRex's health begins to deteriorate. Bree and George go out to dinner at a fancy restaurant and the two are spotted by Edie Britt. Bree later talks to Edie who tells her that even if Bree is not technically \"cheating\" on Rex with George, she is still being somewhat unfaithful. (\"Sunday in the Park with George\")\n\nBree panics as Rex suffers a second heart attack. (\"Goodbye for Now\")\n\nBree bumps into George at the supermarket and he informs her of Rex's continued bragging of their sex life - this is, in fact, a lie. Bree confronts Rex and the two have a heated argument, during which Rex suffers from another heart-attack. Bree hesitates but ultimately drives him to the hospital. (\"Goodbye for Now\")\n\nAn unexpected call: Bree receives news of Rex's death. (\"One Wonderful Day\")\n\nBree talks to Rex in the hospital after he recovers about how she needs to start spring cleaning and assures him that he is going to come through his operation just fine because \"the best is yet to come.\" They finally make amends. Later, Bree receives a phone call from Dr. Craig while she is cleaning her silverware, and she learns that Rex passed away a few minutes ago. Bree finishes her spring cleaning before breaking out crying and screaming at the death of her husband. (\"One Wonderful Day\")\n\nSeason 2[]\n\n(2005-2006)\n\nThere were many ways to tell that Bree Van de Kamp was a lady; she was courteous to those around her, she moved with elegance and grace, and she was very careful not to let others know what she was thinking. You see, like most well-bred women, Bree had something to hide...\n\nMary Alice Young\n\nBree makes a scene at Rex's funeral. (\"Next\")\n\nBree informs the girls of Rex's death and shortly after Rex's mother, Phyllis Van de Kamp, comes to town for the funeral. She and Bree clash heads throughout her visit, especially when Phyllis claims that Bree made Rex miserable during his last years, prompting Bree to disinvite her from the funeral. Eventually, Bree reconsiders; however, during the service, Bree discovers that Rex is being buried in his high school tie, which Phyllis insisted but Bree expressly forbade. Bree changes Rex's tie in the middle of the funeral. (\"Next\") After the service, Bree's handyman, Eli Scruggs, drops by and reveals that he retrieved her cookbook manuscript from the trash all those years ago and convinces her that someday she should complete it. (\"The Best Thing That Ever Could Have Happened\")\n\nBree is embarrassed when Phyllis starts crying over Rex's death in public, so she slaps her. She apologizes later, but with Bree's uncanny composure and her eagerness to settle Rex's will, Phyllis starts to suspect Bree isn't sorry Rex is dead. Dr. Craig discovers a note written by Rex moments before his death, forgiving Bree for something, and Phyllis sees Bree being comforted by George - they both report her to the same insurance investigator. (\"You Could Drive a Person Crazy\")\n\nOn a visit to Rex's grave, Bree is horrified to discover that his body has been dug up. Phyllis has \"forgotten\" to tell her about the insurance investigator's suspicions that Rex was poisoned. Bree packs Phyllis's bags and sends her off in a taxi—and then insists on taking a polygraph test to clear herself of all suspicion. But when they ask her if she loves George, the readout spikes. She tells George that he has to take a polygraph test too, because now they suspect the two of them of conspiring to poison Rex. When he asks why she didn't pass her test, she admits she might have feelings for him after all. George agrees and aces his test by telling lies so convincing that the detector shows he even believes them himself. (\"You'll Never Get Away from Me\")\n\nBree starts dating George again, angering Andrew. Andrew begins to act inappropriately towards George, but Bree refuses to take notice of his bad conduct. George suggests that Andrew return to the detention camp for more counseling, but Bree is hesitant and says she will only do this if her son does something drastic. She reminds George that Andrew is still grieving and she doesn't want him to see her get into another relationship so quickly after his father's death. Later, at Andrew's swim meet, George arrives uninvited and sits next to Bree and then tries to kiss her, as Andrew watches on. Andrew flies into a fit of rage and attacks George, until the swim coach pulls them apart. That evening, Bree makes Andrew pack his bags to return to the camp. (\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\")\n\n, amongst the suspicions that she murdered him. After Bree threatens to sue the police, Detective Barton agrees to release Rex's body to her so she can reinter him. However, as Bree is waiting for Rex’s body to be put in the hearse, Barton comes up to her and tries to get her to confess to poisoning Rex. He shows her the note that Rex wrote before he died that says \"Bree, I understand and I forgive you.\" Bree is shocked that Rex believed that she had poisoned him. Bree had previously invited her friends to a small reburial service for Rex, but when they show up they find that Bree has moved Rex’s grave away from the family’s plot, saying \"If you think I’m going to lay next to someone for eternity who thinks I’m a murderer, you’re crazy.\" She then proceeds to throw her wedding ring into Rex's grave. (\"They Asked Me Why I Believe in You\")\n\nBree discovers that whenever George and her attempt to get intimate, she develops hives on her neck. She talks to Dr. Goldfine who advices her that the sudden break-outs occur because she still feels that she is married. Attempting to get over this fact because she wants to continue seeing George, she suggests the two of them visit a luxurious hotel for an overnight stay. However, when they arrive at the hotel, Bree once again breaks out into hives. Later, the two have dinner and George gives Bree an antihistamine to help with her hives. The next morning, Bree informs George that she'll have to get over her hives because she loves him. The two kiss and make love. After, Bree is left wondering if she is making the right decision. (\"I Wish I Could Forget You\")\n\nGeorge surprises Bree by showing her the new house he's just bought - which he hopes she'll move into with him. He then proposes, in the company of his mother, and Bree hesitantly says yes. Bree speaks with Dr. Goldfine and he suggests not to marry George to be polite and especially because she doesn't really love him. Soon, Bree becomes flustered when George's friends and family start talking about the possibility of children and she tells her finance that she's having second thoughts. She mentions Dr. Goldfine's suggestion and the next day, George attempts to eliminate Goldfine by throwing him over a bridge. (\"Color and Light\")\n\nBree discovers that George has put a wedding announcement in the morning paper and confronts him at the pharmacy. When he spots her not wearing her engagement ring, he aggressively forces her to put it on. The following afternoon, George's ex-fiancé, Leila, informs Bree of George's jealousy and dangerous fits of rage. Bree, who initially doesn't take any notice, later comes to the revelation that Leilia was correct: while dining with George, Bree meets up with an old college boyfriend and she heads off to dance with him - George gets extremely jealous and when Bree once again refuses to put her ring on, he gets violent. Bree calls of the engagement. (\"The Sun Won't Set\")\n\nGeorge begins stalking Bree - interrupts a dinner party Bree is hosting by serenading via a karaoke machine outside and by riding past her house on his bike repeatedly for hours. Bree visits Dr. Goldfine in hospital and he informs her that his assailant rode a bike...Bree realizes George was responsible. Soon, Bree receives a call from the police, who inform her that in their search, they've found evidence that George poisoned Rex. Bree is co-chairing a charity event at a local hotel. George checks into a room at the hotel and sends her a note detailing how he has taken a fatal dose of pills and that if she cares about him, she'll come to his room to save him. Bree goes to his room and finds George slowly passing out - an effect of the pills. She says she can forgive him if he admits to what he did. He finally says whatever he did, he did for her—because she wanted him to. And then he asks her to please call an ambulance. She smiles and tells him she already did. She watches him die before leaving. (\"That's Good, That's Bad\")\n\nBree feigns surprise when the police tell her about George's suicide. She then tells her friends and then she has to break the news to Andrew, who's back from camp. He announces his hatred for his mother and reminds her that it's her fault his father is dead. Bree later informs Andrew that George payed for his crime and that he didn't die on his own terms. (\"Coming Home\")\n\nBree is shocked when she sees Andrew kissing his boyfriend, Justin, in front of the house. Bree tells Andrew to stop seeing him but Andrew ignores her. The next morning, she brings him breakfast in bed, and nearly drops the tray when she finds Justin in bed with her son, after spending the night. Bree threatens to have Justin removed by the police but Andrew plays his trump card - if she does, he'll tell the cops that she let George die. Bree hires Karl Mayer to get his legal advice on the situation. (\"One More Kiss\")\n\nBree begins her quest to find out more details on the mysterious Betty Applewhite. She invites Detective Barton out to lunch, with plans of asking him to research the mysterious new family, but he has the wrong idea - he believes the lunch to be a date. After the misunderstanding, Bree is pulled over by the detective while driving home. He accuses her of driving under the influence of alcohol and has her arrested. She is freed hours later and is forced to walk home. Betty Applewhite conveniently pulls up besides her in her car and offers to give her a ride. The two get talking and Bree tells Betty that everyone is gossiping about her mysterious behavior and Betty, once she's dropped Bree home, calls Edie with the intentions of selling her home. (\"We're Gonna Be All Right\")\n\nWhen Bree finds Matthew Applewhite in Danielle's bedroom, Bree walks the both of them to Betty's, where she slaps Matthew. Eventually, Bree agrees to let Danielle date Matthew as long as it's okay with Betty. The following day, Bree visits Betty who thinks that they should not interfere with Danielle and Matthew's relationship but when Bree discovers Caleb lurking in the upstairs window she panics and tells Betty she has to leave. Remembering that she has seen the boy's face before from the newspaper, she alerts her friends that she has serious dirt on the Applewhites - they agree to meet at Bree's for a poker game to discuss. However, Danielle stupidly reveals to Matthew how Bree covered up Andrew's hit-and-run accident. Before the game, Betty visits Bree to warn her that if she breathes a word about Caleb's existence she will inform the Solises and the police about Andrew's crime. (\"There's Something About a War\")\n\nBree has the key to the Applewhite home from the previous tenant, and when Betty is out, she decides to pay Caleb a visit. As the two talk, Bree learns of Melanie Foster and her death. Later, Betty drops by and is furious that Bree broke into her home. Bree invites her in for a drink and, oddly enough, the two end up commiserating over their wayward sons. (\"Silly People\")\n\nBree gets drunk alone at an Italian restaurant. When she arrives home she passes out on her front lawn only to be discovered by Mrs. McCluskey the following morning. Subsequently, a hung-over Bree is required to babysit Lynette's children. She starts drinking again, falls asleep, and the twins and Penny disappear from her home. Luckily, Lynette finds them down town. Lynette confronts Bree, with suspicions that she was drunk while babysitting her kids, and Bree is offended and denies the allegations. Once Bree is gone, Lynette goes through her friend's garbage and discovers a countless amount of empty wine bottles. Later, Bree finds a neatly stacked line of bottles on her porch with a scrolled message in one of the bottles from Lynette: \"Do you still think you don't have a problem?\" (\"Thank You So Much\")\n\nBree is still drinking and is beginning to worry her friends. Meanwhile, Andrew asks his mother to buy him a car and Bree refuses. Andrew insults her and Bree retaliates by striking a hard slap across her son's face. In a scheme to get emancipated and thus have access to his trust fund, Andrew gets Justin to punch him so he can accuse Bree of having become violent when drunk. Once Bree discovers Andrew's hired a lawyer, she joins an AA group to deal with her problem. (\"There Is No Other Way\")\n\nAt her AA meetings, Bree's vagueness on how long she's been sober tips off a fellow AA member, Peter McMillan, that she's still secretly drinking. She explains that she's not really an alcoholic, she's only coming to undermine Andrew's attempt to paint her as a bad mother. And her plan is working: with Bree appearing to be the model mother, Andrew's lawyer tells him he doesn't stand a chance in court. However, after Andrew shakes Bree up at a department store by threatening to use childhood sexual abuse allegations in court, she hits the bottle hard and passes out in the dressing room. Locked in the department store, she has no choice but to call Peter, who comes to her rescue. Bree finally admits that she has a problem. (\"Could I Leave You?\")\n\nBree warms up to her AA sponsor Peter who in addition to being an alcoholic is also a sex addict. After Peter struggles to contain himself in Bree's presence, he introduces her to her new AA sponsor, Donna. Immediately, Bree wants Peter back and eventually wins him over. Meanwhile, Bree asks Lynette to portray her in a positive light, after she is forced to give a deposition in regards to Andrew's pending lawsuit. Lynette agrees. (\"Everybody Says Don't\")\n\nBree's parents, Henry and Eleanor Mason, show up on the day of Andrew's court-case. Henry convinces the judge to postpone the hearing and then insists to Karl that they can solve this problem \"in house\". After a failed attempt or two at reconciliation between mother and son, Eleanor tells Bree that acting on Andrew's suggestion, she and Henry are taking Andrew with them to Rhode Island. After speaking to Justin, Bree devises a plan for making Andrew stay. On the day of the move, Henry and Eleanor stumble upon Andrew's gay porn collection and change their minds - leaving Andrew with Bree. Bree tries to seek Andrew's forgiveness for all they've been through and encourages his relationship with Justin to continue. (\"Don't Look at Me\")\n\nBree and Peter's relationship continues, until it is discovered by Peter's sex addicts sponsor, Claude, who forbids him from seeing Bree anymore. Bree learns that Claude is also a drug sponsor and all of his sponsors give him their drugs - Bree uses this against him and reports him to the police for being in the possession of illegal drugs. With Claude out of the way, Bree sets her sights back on Peter. Peter declines to continue their relationship, fearing his addiction will return. However, Peter later calls Bree from a bathroom at a swinger party and asks if she will pick him up. Bree does rescues him and they both agree to help each other with their addictions. (\"It Wasn’t Meant to Happen\")\n\nAndrew sets his revenge plan into action to get back at his mother. Andrew preys on his mother's boyfriend, Peter, who is bisexual, and seduces him. Bree discovers that the two had sex and proceeds to end her relationship with Peter and also kicks Andrew out. She abandons him at a gas station in the middle of nowhere and drives away. (\"I Know Things Now\")\n\nDanielle becomes suspicious of Bree's strange behavior and becomes concerned since Andrew's disappearance. When Danielle informs her mother that she forgot her birthday, Bree throws her a 17th. At the party, Bree comes to a melting point when one of Danielle's friends eats some of the cake's frosting - that Bree worked so hard on to make perfect - before it is cut. Bree causes a scene when she flips out. Danielle is greatly embarrassed and decides to run away with Matthew, with no intentions of returning. Bree then checks herself into a mental institution, as she is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. (\"No One Is Alone\")\n\nBree begins her stay at the psychiatric hospital. There, she meets up with Orson Hodge, who is visiting a sick friend. During a session, Bree refuses to reveal her reasons for admitting herself, much to her doctor's frustration. Bree receives a call from Betty who tells her that she believes Matthew, not Caleb, killed Melanie, and that Bree's daughter, Danielle, is in danger. Bree attempts to leave the hospital but is retrained. She later makes a daring escape by throwing the contents of a miniature Zen sand garden at her doctor and running for the door. (\"Remember, Part 1\")\n\nBree catches Danielle and Matthew attempting to steal money and food from her home. She warns Danielle that Matthew is a killer but Danielle just takes this as more of her mom's craziness. But when Matthew puts Bree at gunpoint and threatens to kill her if she does not move, Danielle discovers the truth. Before Matthew can pull the trigger, he is shot by a police squad and is killed. The next day, Bree is then visited by Orson who presents her with flowers and congratulates her on the escape. Pleased with his kind gestures, Bree invites Orson into her home. (\"Remember, Part 2\")\n\nSeason 3[]\n\n(2006-2007)\n\nBree and Orson Hodge kiss in the rain. (\"Listen to the Rain on the Roof\")\n\nAfter six months of dating, Orson surprises Bree with a ring. She's hesitant, saying she hasn't been very lucky in love since Rex's death, but finally says yes. She tells her friends, who are surprised at her haste, but even more shocked to hear that she and Orson haven't had sex yet. Later, Orson tries to convince Bree to have sex with him before the wedding, but she is firm in her convictions. That is, until his obsessive wineglass cleaning gets her hot and bothered. After a visit to the hospital, Bree learns that Orson had made her experience her first orgasm. At Bree and Orson's engagement party, an uninvited guest shows up: his old neighbor, Carolyn Bigsby. In front of everyone, she warns Bree that Orson killed his first wife, and that if Bree marries him, she'll be next. (\"Listen to the Rain on the Roof\")\n\nBree and Orson marry. (\"It Takes Two\")\n\nTwo weeks after their engagement party, Bree and Orson decide to get married. Her friends try to tell her it's too fast, but can't bring themselves to ruin her joy. However, at the ceremony, Bree is confronted by Susan, Lynette and Gaby and announces that she absolutely trusts her future husband. Right before the vows are exchanged, Bree pulls Orson aside and asks him, \"Did you kill your wife?\" He tells her that he didn't and Bree believes him - the wedding continues. During the reception, Bree and Orson are taken to Fairview Police Station by Detective Ridley to identify a body they believe is Orson's first wife, Alma's. Orson says it is not his wife but Carolyn Bigsby appears to prove him wrong. Only she has to admit she doesn't recognize the body either. She gives Bree a fresh warning, but Bree simply tells her to leave them alone. (\"It Takes Two\")\n\nAndrew returns home. (\"A Weekend in the Country\")\n\nBree and Orson are ready to leave for their honeymoon when Bree sees a TV interview with a homeless teen—Andrew. To Orson's dismay, she insists they cancel their honeymoon and go find Andrew. She finds him at a soup kitchen, but he says he wants nothing to do with her. She finally tells Orson the truth: Andrew didn't run away, she left him by the side of the road. Without telling his new wife, Orson tracks Andrew down and learns that he became a 'rentboy' after his mother's abandonment. Orson persuades him to return home. (\"A Weekend in the Country\")\n\nBree decides to explain Andrew's absence by saying he was at a drama camp. And Bree soon learns from Orson how Andrew earned a living while on the streets. She's appalled, but even more so to learn that one of his 'johns', is a seemingly respectable local doctor. Bree decides it's her duty to inform doctor's wife, who admits she had her suspicions, but is less than pleased to now have a vivid mental image of his infidelity. She retaliates with a juicy bit of gossip of her own: Bree's daughter Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher. (\"Like It Was\")\n\nThe Van de Kamps go to counseling. (\"Nice She Ain't\")\n\nDespondent over Bree trying to stop her affair with her history teacher, Danielle makes a halfhearted attempt to kill herself. This prompts Bree to take the family all to counseling. At a session, Danielle threatens Bree that she'll leave home for good if she attempts to end her affair. On this note, Bree's visits Mr. Faladi and dump Danielle's suitcases on him. She says they have her blessing, but that they'll have to be discreet so Mrs. Falati won't find out. Recognizing an unwanted complication when he sees one, Mr. Falati promises to end it with Danielle, but without mentioning Bree. This works and Bree is somewhat impressed with Danielle's underhand tactics when she informs both the school and Mrs. Faladi of the affair. (\"Nice She Ain't\")\n\nBree fears that Orson may have abused his former wife. (\"Sweetheart, I Have to Confess\")\n\nCarolyn apologizes to Bree for making accusations about Orson and Bree graciously accepts her apology. Soon after, Bree becomes puzzled when she's snubbed for the second time in a week at the country club. She learns that Carolyn is friends with everyone at the club and has convinced them all Orson is a murderer. Bree invite Carolyn and Harvey Bigsby to dinner at the country club so everyone can see there's nothing to the rumors. The women go to powder their noses and Carolyn shows Bree a photo of Alma, looking horribly battered, and of the police report that went along with the incident. Bree can't believe Orson beat his first wife, but Carolyn insists photos never lie. (\"Sweetheart, I Have to Confess\")\n\nBree and Orson's mother, Gloria Hodge. (\"Children and Art\")\n\nBree confronts Orson with the police report Carolyn gave her and he explains that he never hit his first wife, but was only defending himself when she attacked him. He says if Carolyn paid enough attention to her own marriage, Harvey would never have cheated on her with some stewardess named Monique Polier. Bree accepts his version of events, so when Carolyn drives by, Bree tells her she doesn't believe that Orson beat his wife. When Carolyn won't let it drop, she tells her about Monique. (\"Bang\")\n\nBree asks Orson what his mother’s address is so she can put her on her Christmas card list. Orson reveals that his dementia-suffering mother lives in a nursing home in Lakeview, 30 minutes away. Bree travels to Lakeview to visit Gloria (Orson’s mother) and discovers that she is perfectly fine and not, as Orson hold her, suffering from dementia. Bree brings her back to her home for dinner. Gloria tells Orson she wants to go back home but Orson tells her that he’s sold her house, her car and all of her things. Orson calls for an ambulance to take Gloria back to the nursing home but she hijacks it and crashes it into a fire hydrant across the street. Bree offers to let Gloria stay in their house for a few weeks. (\"Children and Art\")\n\nBree and Orson decide to purchase Gloria a home. When the only affordable home the couple can afford is in the ghetto area of Fairview, and proves to be unsafe, as Gloria ends up tripping on the unstable kitchen floor, Bree demands that she continues to live with them, over the objections of both Gloria and Orson. Gloria, in the hopes of destroying the lives of Orson and Bree, tells Bree that Orson cheated on Alma, and his mistress was Monique. Monique cheated on Orson, too. Bree tells Orson that it scares her that he had two women in his life before her; one's missing, and one's dead and she throws him out of the house. (\"Beautiful Girls\")\n\nBree meets Alma Hodge, Orson's \"deceased\" ex-wife. (\"No Fits, No Fights, No Feuds\")\n\nUnless Bree hears the complete truth about what what happened with Alma and Monique, she will divorce Orson. He explains and after listening to his reasonable story, Bree takes him back. Having had enough of Gloria's behavior, Bree and Orson buy her a small condo in a retirement community and she moves out. However, it transpires that Alma is alive and well, as she arrives to pick up Gloria, after learning that Bree and Orson have reunited. (\"The Miracle Song\")\n\nBree meets Alma for the first time and decides to throw a dinner party announcing Alma's return, in order to show off to Wisteria Lane that her husband did not murder her. Detective Ridley crashes the party to ask Orson some questions, after Susan spoke to the police about Orson's affair with Monique. Bree learns of Susan's talk with the police and, feeling betrayed, ends their friendship. (\"No Fits, No Fights, No Feuds\")\n\nBree makes a horrifying discovery - a collection of Monique Pollier's teeth. (\"Not While I'm Around\")\n\nBree and Orson are less than thrilled to discover that Alma has moved into the Applewhites' old house. Bree sends Orson over to confront his ex. There, Alma kisses Orson, which Bree sees and is infuriated about. Bree later confronts Alma herself but is shocked when her new neighbor's parrot squawks \"Don't tell Bree.\" With Alma assisting a moving man upstairs, Bree, when searching for a dustpan to clean up a glass she smashes, unintentionally uncovers a loose floorboard. Under which is a picture of Orson and Monique, along with a small bag containing Monique's teeth. (\"Not While I'm Around\")\n\nBree learns of her husband's rape. (\"Come Play Wiz Me\")\n\nBree shows Orson the teeth she recovered from Alma's home and Orson informs Gloria that he knows what she is planning with Alma and orders her to stop. Later, as part of their plan, Orson is drugged by Gloria and Alma and the latter rapes him, after injecting herself with hormones in order to successfully impregnate herself. Bree stumbles upon this horrifying ordeal and punches Alma, as she calls Andrew, to help her take Orson home. (\"Come Play Wiz Me\")\n\nFile:Bree unconcious.png\n\nBree's unconscious body is discovered by Andrew and Orson. (\"I Remember That\")\n\nBree tells Orson about his rape, who has no recollection of the events because he was so heavily drugged, but he is reluctant to go to the police. Orson realizes the time has come to tell Bree what happened the night Monique died. Once Bree has been informed, she is furious and insists that he exonerate Mike, whom has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Orson refuses - he can't, or he'll implicate himself. That evening, Bree sees a ladder leaning up against the house with what looks like the bag of teeth hanging from one of the top rungs. As she climbs up to get it, she steps on a rung that has been sabotaged—and promptly falls. Andrew and Orson find her lying there, unconscious. Orson calls the police and Andrew examines the bag; it is full of marbles. Gloria, who has locked Alma in the attic of her home, is responsible for Bree's fall, but Andrew informs the nurses at the hospital not to let Orson be alone with her - he believes it's Orson's fault his mother was hurt. Susan, meanwhile, visits Bree and the two make up and return to being friends. (\"I Remember That\")\n\nGloria attempts to murder Bree. (\"The Little Things You Do Together\")\n\nBree is returned home and put on bed-rest. Gloria arrives at the Hodge home, with spiked soup in tow, which she gives to Danielle, who takes it upstairs to her mother, before leaving to attend the Scavo Pizzeria opening. Alone, Gloria sets her plan into action...her plan to murder Bree. Gloria believes, the vows Orson made to Alma under the eyes of God are still sacred, and that Orson's divorce from Alma meant nothing, making Bree Orson’s mistress. Gloria runs Bree a bath, and stages it with photographs of Orson and Bree together, as well as candles. Gloria’s idea is that she will get Bree into the bath, and cut her wrists, making it look like a suicide. Andrew spots Danielle at the pizzeria opening and rushes home to check on his mother's well being. Andrew is knocked unconscious in an effort to save his mother by Gloria, but Orson soon comes to Andrew’s rescue. He confronts Gloria as she is about to slit Bree’s wrists. The two battle, before Gloria falls to the floor in defeat, and begins to suffer a stroke. Orson rescues Bree from the bath and returns her to bed. Bree wakes up and begins having nightmares about Gloria. Orson fills her in on what happened. He left Gloria (who is unconscious after the stroke) next to Alma’s body as well as the fake suicide note, which she wrote when trying to attract Orson's attention, and the bag of teeth belonging to Monique, removed by Gloria. The next morning, the two bodies are found and the police believe Alma committed suicide because she felt guilty for killing Monique and that Gloria found her and had a stroke. Mike is exonerated. (\"The Little Things You Do Together\")\n\nBree leaves Wisteria Lane on her honeymoon. (\"My Husband, the Pig\")\n\nBree returns in time for Gabrielle's wedding... pregnant. (\"Getting Married Today\")\n\nBree leaves Wisteria Lane to visit her parents for a few days, with plans of later meeting up with Orson, so the two can head off for the honeymoon they never took. (\"My Husband, the Pig\")\n\nBree and Orson return from their honeymoon in time for Gabrielle and Victor Lang's wedding ceremony. Susan, Lynette and Gabrielle are shocked to discover that Bree is pregnant. In a flashback, Bree and Orson are packing up their belongings at their hotel. It appears that Bree is faking her pregnancy, to cover up the fact that the teenage Danielle really is pregnant. When Julie Mayer begins to ask questions about Danielle's whereabouts, Bree, pretending to be her daughter, types an email to Julie explaining that she is staying at a boarding school in Switzerland. Bree then speaks to Danielle on the telephone and instructs her that she'll not return home until after the baby is born. (\"Getting Married Today\")\n\nSeason 4[]\n\n(2007-2008)\n\nWhenever I feel my emotions getting the best of me, I simply picture an empty box. And I take whatever I'm feeling and put that in the box. Then I picture myself putting the box away in a big empty closet and closing the door. Then, if I have time, I go back and open the box and deal with the emotion. In private. Like a lady.\n\nBree and Orson struggle to make people think she is pregnant. While out shopping with Orson, Bree almost gets violent with an old lady who wanted to rub her stomach. Then at a neighborhood party, while reaching to get some food, a meat fork sticks in her fake stomach and Ida Greenberg freaks out. Bree and Orson manage to play all of this off, but Orson tells Bree that he wants to tell the truth about the baby before someone finds out. After talking he realizes that this is important to Bree because she feels like she screwed up with Andrew and Daniele and sees this baby as a second chance at motherhood. (\"Now You Know\")\n\nAfter new neighbor, Katherine Mayfair, suggests they have a lunch party for Lynette, she and Bree cross swords after they both insist to bring dessert. Katherine agrees to make a salad, but before the party, she switches Bree's lemon pie with hers. The girls all compliment Bree on \"the best pie she has ever made\" however, Bree soon discovers that the pie is not hers and realizes what Katherine has done. Furious about Katherine's deceit, Bree desperately tries to figure out Katherine's secret ingredient. Bree decides to break into the Mayfair house to steal the recipe. Katherine returns home with her daughter and the two argue about their mysterious past, which Bree overhears. (\"Smiles of a Summer Night\")\n\nTo Bree's horror, Susan asks her for the name of her gynecologist. As Bree doesn't actually have one, and Susan becomes increasingly persistent, she blindly picks a gynecologist's name from the telephone book and gives it to her friend. When Susan returns from her appointment, she confronts Bree about her experience there - the office was filthy, full of junkies, and the doctor took pictures of her body on his cellphone while examining her. Bree apologizes for sending her friend to such an unethical practitioner. (\"The Game\")\n\nA gift for Danielle is delivered and Bree quickly learns that it was sent by Rex's mother, Phyllis. Meanwhile, against her will, Susan, Lynette and Gaby, with the help from Andrew, throw Bree a baby shower. Andrew had a hand in the guest list and in an attempt to frustrate his mother further, invited Phyllis along. Bree and Phyllis argue and the latter, while attempting to steal back her fur coat from Bree, discovers the fake pregnancy padding in the closet. Later, Phyllis checks Danielle out of the convent, without Bree's knowledge. (\"If There's Anything I Can't Stand\")\n\nBree is furious when she learns that Danielle is living with Phyllis at her retirement village. Bree and Orson may them a visit but Danielle refuses to leave because Phyllis has agreed to give her a \"cushy lifestyle\". Andrew advices his mother to offer them Danielle a luxury and during another visit, Bree announces that she'll purchase her daughter a car.

(\"Art Isn't Easy\")\n\nBree, Orson and Andrew are invited to Bob Hunter and Lee McDermott's Halloween party. Bree is shocked when Danielle's arrives at the party, uninvited, and dressed as her mother. When Danielle's water suddenly breaks, Bree gets Adam to deliver the baby in secret at her home.

Danielle leaves the next day for college, as Bree poses as the baby's mother. (\"Now I Know, Don't Be Scared\")\n\nBree introduces the newborn, Benjamin Tyson Hodge, to her friends. Later, when she has Susan and Mike over for dinner, Bree becomes concerned when she spots Mike taking an addictive narcotic behind the scenes. She informs Susan of her worry. Meanwhile, Bree wants Benjamin to be circumcised, but Orson, who had the procedure preformed when he was 5, is strongly opposed to the idea. Ignoring her husband's opposition, Bree goes to the hospital to get her baby circumcised, but discovers that Orson has mailed every clinic in the state, giving his refusal to allow the operation to be carried out. Determined, Bree attends a Debris Party and has Benjamin circumcised there. Orson is saddened by this because, as Benjamin's father, he should have some say on how he is raised. Bree apologizes and realizes how much Orson loves the baby - love makes them a family, not blood. (\"You Can't Judge a Book by its Cover\")\n\nBree irritates Orson by insisting on having baby Benjamin share their bed. She explains that by doing this she is helping Ben form a bond with them, a mistake she made with her first children. Andrew overhears and takes as his cue to move out of the house so Bree won't be reminded of her past \"mistakes.\" In an attempt to get Andrew to return home, Bree visits him at his new apartment. Andrew refuses to come home and reveals that his real motive for moving was to start his own life and give his mother the opportunity to begin her new life with Orson and Benjamin.

Bree learns that Sylvia had an affair with Adam and, after their conversation becomes uncomfortable and Bree asks her guest to leave, Sylvia locks herself in the bathroom that Bree was planning to use as a tornado safe spot and refuses to exit. Bree bring the situation to the Mayfair's attention and Adam attempts to get Sylvia to unlock the door. But when the tornado strikes, Bree, Orson, Benjamin, Katherine and Adam all take shelter in a nearby closet. There, Bree comforts Katherine who finds out about her husband's betrayal.

(\"Something's Coming\")\n\nBree, Orson, and Benjamin move into Susan's home while theirs is in the process of being repaired after the tornado. Meanwhile, Bree, after finding out her gay contractor has backed out after a messy split, attempts to hook him up with Andrew, in order to get their house fixed quicker. Susan, who enjoys having Bree around as she cooks and cleans for her, attempts to ruin her friend's plans. She interrupts Bree's dinner and goes out of her way to stop Andrew from seducing Walter the contractor.

(\"Welcome to Kanagawa\")\n\nBree agrees to let Lynette, Tom and the kids join her and Orson at church, after they begin to embrace religion following the devastating tornado. But Bree soon thinks Lynette is making a fool of herself by asking the minister questions during the service and suggests Lynette attend a different church.

Bree heads for the Catholic church and manages to persuade Lynette to rejoin her church. (\"Sunday\")\n\nBree and Katherine join forces to plan the Founders Day Ball, despite the rest of the housewives' concerns about their rivalry. However, Bree begins to feel threatened as Katherine tries to overrule any decisions she makes...even taking over the role of presenting the award! Bree, in a last ditch effort to eliminate her rival so she can present the award, poisons Katherine with some spoiled dipping sauce.

(\"In Buddy's Eyes\")\n\nBree and Orson move back into their house, after its repairs are concluded and following the success of the Founders Ball, Bree and Katherine decide to start a catering business. Later, Bree is horrified to discover that Orson was responsible for running down Mike (See Season 3 mystery) and she kicks him out, with intentions of divorcing him. (\"Hello, Little Girl\")\n\nBree gives Orson an ultimatum; either surrender himself to the police and go to jail or go free but loose her as his wife. Orson refuses to go to jail. Later, Bree discovers Orson on the front lawn drunk. He tells her he can turn himself in to the police and explain that he was sleepwalking when he ran over Mike. Bree is outraged by this idea and, when Edie drives by, she asks her to take Orson back to his apartment. However, Bree discovers that Orson stayed overnight with Edie and confronts her - concerned that she might start an affair with Orson (a valid concern, given her past adulterous liaisons with Karl, Mike and Carlos). Edie tells Bree that she is not interested in Orson, but she will continue allow Orson to stay for as long as he wants. That night, Bree catches Edie and Orson kissing and is deeply upset. (\"Opening Doors\")\n\nWhile confronting Edie about the kiss, Bree is angered and ends up slapping her foe. This marks a full scale war between the two of them.

(\"Let Me Entertain You\")\n\nBree is exhausted after many all-nighters of sex with Keith's unrestricted libido.

While sorting through Keith's mail, Bree notices a letter from the Department of Corrections and discovers that he has a violent history - he is on probation for assault. Later, at Renee's Halloween party, Bree is approached by a drunken man, who tries to advance on her. She calls over Keith, who grabs the man and violently demands he leave the party. Bree screams for Keith to calm down and he storms off. He confesses to Bree that he knows she wants to break up with him since finding out about his probation.

Mary drops hints about Bree being menopausal through dinner and after finally admitting the secret to Keith, an ashamed Bree leaves the restaurant and heads home. Keith finds her and informs her that having children with his DNA isn't important - they can always adopt. Bree sadly tells him that she doesn't want any more children and an upset Keith tells her to forget the conversation so they continue being happy. (\"A Humiliating Business\")\n\nBree shares Thanksgiving dinner with Keith, his parents, and Karen and Roy. (\"Sorry Grateful\")\n\nAs an apology for her behavior at the restaurant, Mary comes to Bree's home with flowers, wherein Bree discovers how rocky her marriage has been since her husband returned from the military.

However, she turns out to be less than stable and the date ends badly, when the engagement ring Keith arranged to be placed in the starter course is unveiled amidst all the chaos. Keith is upset with everyone, including Bree, for ruining his engagement plans. Bree goes to Keith's apartment but finds his father, Richard, there, who implies that Bree should be with him instead of Keith. (\"Pleasant Little Kingdom\")\n\nKeith's father attempts to kiss Bree. (\"Down the Block There's a Riot\")\n\nKeith decides to propose to Bree. Bree is not ready to tie the knot and they compromise on Keith moving in instead.

Over dinner, Orson makes it clear he doesn't think Keith is a good choice for Bree as they have nothing in common and Orson understands her more, the two throwing food at one another. Bree goes to see Orson's ex, who reveals that Orson was the one who broke up with her as he's still in love with Bree. She confronts him and Orson confesses how he feels and thinks Bree is too good for Keith.
