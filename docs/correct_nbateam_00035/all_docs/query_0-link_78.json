        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nORLANDO, Fla. — Point guard Carlos Arroyo, who spent the last two seasons with the Orlando Magic, has become the latest NBA player to bolt overseas, signing with an Israeli team.\n\nArroyo, 29, signed a one-year deal with Maccabi Tel Aviv.\n\n\"I’m very happy we’ve completed this signing,\" Maccabi coach Effi Birnboim said Monday on the club’s website. \"Arroyo is a player of the highest standard and has been our top priority for a while.\n\nArroyo has averaged seven points and 3.3 assists per game during his seven-year career that included previous stops in Toronto, Denver, Utah and Detroit. He averaged 6.9 points and 3.5 assists last season, primarily off the bench.\n\nJosh Childress announced last month that he was leaving the Atlanta Hawks for Greek club Olympiakos, reversing the course of the many international stars who have signed with the NBA. Agent Jim Tanner said Childress was guaranteed about $20 million after taxes, and that Childress could opt out of the contract after each year.\n\nNenad Kerstic left the New Jersey Nets and Carlos Delfino and Jorge Garbajosa left the Toronto Raptors to sign with a Russian team."
