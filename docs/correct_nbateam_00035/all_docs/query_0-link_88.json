        "text": "Toronto, ON (Sports Network) - The Toronto Raptors have reportedly reached a deal to send forward Carlos Delfino to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for forward Amir Johnson on Monday.\n\nESPN.com is reporting that the deal will also include guard Roko Ukic heading to Milwaukee with the Bucks sending guard Sonny Weems to the Raptors. The site also stated that a source said the deal will not be finalized before Tuesday as Delfino must fly from Argentina to sign a contract with the Bucks, which is expected to be for three years with a team option for the third year.\n\nDelfino played in all 82 games last season for Toronto and averaged 9.0 points and 4.4 rebounds.\n\nA four-year veteran, Delfino spent his first three seasons with Detroit before coming to Toronto last season. Over 262 games, he has averages of 5.8 points and 3.0 rebounds.\n\nJohnson, who Milwaukee acquired from Detroit as part of a three-team swap with San Antonio in late June, has appeared in 135 games over his three-year career, all with Detroit, and has averages of 3.7 points and 3.8 rebounds.\n\nUkic played in 72 games last season with Toronto, his first in the NBA, and averaged 4.2 points and 1.0 assists in a little over 12 minutes per games.\n\nWeems, who Milwaukee got in a trade with Denver in July, played in 12 games for the Nuggets last season and average 1.6 points in 4 1/2 minutes per game."
