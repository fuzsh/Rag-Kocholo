        "text": "Just when Interbasket was getting all excited the Toronto Raptors and all the international players they had on their roster…\n\nNow comes this rumour that the Canadian NBA franchise is trading away Argentinian Carlos Delfino and Croatian backup point guard Roko Ukić to the Milwukee Bucks for Amir Johnson.\n\nIf true, Toronto will no longer have as many international players.\n\nHowever the Raps still have the potential for the first ever (?), all-international NBA lineup with José Calderón running the point, Marco Belinelli at shooting guard, Hedo Türkoğlu at small forward, Andrea Bargnani at the four, and veteran backup center Rasho Nesterović.\n\nBelinelli and Nesterović would be backups, but as long as all five remain healthy, the situation is highly-likely this next season.\n\nDelfino left the NBA at the beginning of the 2008-09 season to sign with Russian club Khimki. Delfino has since left Russia because the club could no longer afford to pay the 6-6 shooting guard. The Raptors owned Delfino’s NBA rights.\n\nThe 6-5 point guard Ukic played 12 minutes a game for the Raptors and averaged 4.2 points and 2.1 assists in his first NBA season. Ukic is 24 years old.\n\nAmir Johnson is a 22-year old, 6-9 forward that was drafted by the Detroit Pistons #56 overall in 2005. Johnson played his entire career with the Pistons before being traded to the Bucks this offseason as a part of a three-team trade that sent Richard Jefferson to the San Antonio Spurs."
