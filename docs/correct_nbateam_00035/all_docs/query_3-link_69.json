        "text": "The Milwaukee Bucks have agreed on a two-year, $6.5 million deal with Carlos Delfino that includes a team option for a third year that could pay him nearly $10 million, league sources tell Yahoo! Sports.\n\nDelfino, 30, had a strong season for the Houston Rockets, averaging 10.6 points per game and shooting 37.5 percent from 3-point range.\n\nDelfino will join free-agent guard O.J. Mayo in the Bucks' backcourt, which lost Monta Ellis and J.J. Redick to free agency. The Bucks are expected to match any offer sheets for restricted free-agent Brandon Jennings, and bring him back on a long-term deal.\n\nIn his eight years in the NBA, Delfino has played with Detroit, Toronto, Milwaukee and Houston. The Argentina native has averaged 8.1 points per game in his career."
