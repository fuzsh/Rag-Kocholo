        "text": "Detroit Pistons and Toronto Raptors Swap Primoz Brezec and Juan Dixon\n\nOn February 21st, 2008, the Detroit Pistons traded center Primoz Brezec to the Toronto Raptors for guard Juan Dixon and cash considerations.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors originally acquired Juan Dixon in a trade with the Portland Trail Blazers involving guard Fred Jones. Dixon became a key part of Toronto’s stretch run into the 2007 postseason. The Raptors managed to finish with a 47-35 record which was good enough for an Atlantic Division championship. Dixon played in 26 games (5 starts) for the Raptors. He averaged 11.1 PPG on 42.5% FGs, 2.8 RPG, 1.6 APG and 1.0 SPG in 26.3 MPG.\n\nIn the first round of the postseason, the Raptors faced their division rival New Jersey Nets. New Jersey stole the first game on the road to take a 1-0 lead. The Raptors won Game Two to tie the series. New Jersey managed to take Games Three and Four at home to take a 3-1 series lead. After a Raptors win at home in Game Five, the Nets won Game Six to win the series 4-2. Dixon saw a lesser role in the postseason, playing just 10.5 MPG in the six-game set.\n\nDuring the 2007 offseason, the Raptors added Carlos Delfino in a trade, and signed Jamario Moon and Jason Kapono to bolster their wing rotation. The improved play of point guard Jose Calderon and the presence of T.J. Ford added with the newfound depth at the shooting guard squeezed Dixon out of the rotation.\n\nThrough 52 games, Dixon played in only 36 contests. He averaged a career-low 11.8 MPG and managed 4.3 PPG, 1.3 RPG, 1.8 APG and 0.6 SPG. It became obvious that Dixon would be moved with his growing unhappiness with his role. He departed Toronto with a stat line of 7.1 PPG, 1.9 RPG, 1.7 APG and 0.8 SPG in 62 games. He shot 40& from the field, 36% from beyond the arc, and 94% from the charity stripe in that time.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons originally acquired Primoz Brezec along with Walter Herrmann in a December 2007 trade from the Charlotte Bobcats. Brezec played 17 games with the Pistons and produced 1.6 PPG and 1.1 RPG in 5.8 MPG.\n\nThe trade featured no long-term repercussions for either team. Both Brezec ($2.75 million) and Dixon ($2.55 million) were both in the last year of their contracts. In response to the trade, the Pistons waived guard Ronald “Flip” Murray and signed center Theo Ratliff to bolster their frontcourt rotation.\n\nAfter the trade, Brezec did not see much action for the Raptors. He was a rowdy supporter on the bench for the Raptors. He even had a few ways to address his new coach Sam Mitchell (via Sportsnet Canada):\n\n“Everything starts with ‘ganster’ and ends with ‘pimp.’ I don’t know who he was around or what movies he was watching. I don’t think my name is ‘coach’ anymore, I think it’s ‘gangster.’”\n\nBrezec played in just 13 games in Toronto. He averaged 3.7 PPG and 1.4 RPG in 8.5 MPG. The Raptors finished 41-41 and qualified for postseason play for the second year in a row. Brezec did not play in the postseason for a Raptors team that lost to the Orlando Magic in five games.\n\nDixon performed well in limited action with Detroit. A deep backcourt featuring starters Chauncey Billups and Rip Hamilton as well as young guards Arron Afflalo and Rodney Stuckey made playing time scarce. Dixon also dealt with a left calf injury for a portion of the season.\n\nThe former Maryland Terrapin played in 17 games with Detroit and produced 6.5 PPG, 1.6 RPG and 1.9 APG in 14.4 MPG. Dixon also posted a career-best True Shooting Percentage of 54.4% in the small sample size. Detroit was 39-15 before the trade, and went 20-8 the rest of the way to finish with the second best record in the East at 59-23.\n\nDixon was not a part of Detroit’s rotation during the 2008 playoffs and played a total of 7 minutes in 2 games. The Pistons defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 4-2 and the Orlando Magic 4-1 to advance to their sixth straight Conference Finals. Detroit faced the Boston Celtics in the Conference Finals and they lost in six games. In the 2008 offseason, Dixon signed a one-year contract for the veteran’s minimum with the Washington Wizards.\n\nJuan Dixon on the trade (via Pistons.com):\n\n“I was very excited. Toronto is a great city, a great organization, but it wasn’t a good situation for me. Great teammates, great coaching staff, management I got along with great. It’s just that I wasn’t playing. This is an opportunity for me to possibly play some minutes and I’m very fortunate to come to a championship-caliber team.”\n\nOn his experience in Toronto:\n\n“This year in Toronto, I got a lot more experience at the (point). I was able to learn through the coaching staff at Toronto, watching and learning from T.J. (Ford) and Jose (Calderon). I consider myself a combo. I talked to Joe (Dumars) earlier. It’s funny. In certain systems, you feel more comfortable at a certain position. I think here I’ll feel very comfortable playing both the one and the two, so I’m really looking forward to it.”\n\nOn his recent conversation with Joe Dumars:\n\n“He’s a straight shooter. He told me like it is – just come here and work hard. The atmosphere is a family atmosphere and everyone gets along well. Just get ready to contribute. Whenever my number is called, just go out there and play my game and be aggressive.”\n\nOn having a teammate from a previous stop in Jarvis Hayes on the Pistons:\n\n“Jarvis and I were very close. It helps coming to a different situation that you have someone on the team that you’re pretty familiar with. When I walked into the locker room, the first guy I saw was Jarvis. It was very comfortable for me.”\n\nWhy the Pistons work for him (via MLive):\n\n“The makeup of this team, is guys that other teams didn’t want. You go around this locker room. It’s like that with everybody. And it is that familiarity that has made the former Toronto Raptor’s transition to an already crowded backcourt surprisingly smooth. That’s why this is the perfect team for me. Everybody in here knows what it feels like to not be wanted.”\n\nOn Toronto:\n\n“It just wasn’t a good situation for me. They were going in a different way, and I didn’t feel like I was in their plans. It’s a first-class organization, though. I don’t have anything bad to say about my time in Toronto.”\n\nOn his role:\n\n“I want to be a combo guard, someone who can play both backcourt spots. I just want to be able to do as many things as I can to help this team keep on winning.”\n\nOn the team’s crowded backcourt:\n\n“That’s all right with me. I’ve had the odds against me my whole life. This is nothing new.”\n\nPrimoz Brezec on playing in Toronto after his debut (via Raptors.com):\n\n“I didn’t play the whole season. In Charlotte I played a little bit. I didn’t really get a chance in Detroit. I had a lot of fun today and hopefully we can continue winning and playing like that.”\n\nOn his celebrations on the bench and the Raptors brain trust:\n\n“Definitely. I’ve been around seven years in Indiana and Charlotte and every time I step on the court I give my best. If I play one minute or two minutes I don’t care, that’s just me, that’s the way I play. You can expect the same thing here and I’m very excited to be here. It’s a great team and a great organization. Bryan (Colangelo) and Maurizio (Gherardini) are doing great stuff. They have a good coach and he (Sam Mitchell) was in Charlotte while I was there a little bit. He’s not scared and that’s the most important thing in this business. You can’t be scared to play players. You’ve got to trust your players and your players have to trust you. You have to produce and that’s how you get your playing time. In practice and games you have to produce.”\n\nDetroit Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars on the trade (via Pistons.com):\n\n“We are pleased to add Juan Dixon to our roster. We feel Juan will add quality depth at the guard position both offensively and defensively. We also appreciate the hard work and professionalism that Primoz Brezec displayed during his time with our club.”\n\nRaptors general manager Bryan Colangelo on Juan Dixon’s unhappiness (via Sportsnet Canada):\n\n“It’s important that we have players that want to be here. Dixon and his representatives made it clear that he didn’t. Not that he was handling himself in an unprofessional way, but we only want players that want to be here.”\n\nOn feeling comfortable with the team’s backup point guard situation (via The Star):\n\n“I feel comfortable between the guards that we have and Darrick Martin and Carlos Delfino that it’s the right play. There were several transactions that were available to us for back-up point guards that ultimately would have cost us flexibility going forward. In most cases, they were looking for draft picks and that’s something we weren’t entertaining.”\n\nPistons head coach Flip Saunders on Dixon (via Pistons.com):\n\n“He has the ability to defend, shoot the ball from the perimeter, an intelligent player. We’ll have to wait to see how it plays out. Of the top four teams in the East and four in the West, the top eight teams, we’re the only team playing too rookies in our top eight and we’re not just going to shelve that. I like the fact he’s coming from a winning program in college, he’s a character guy, he’s very much a competitor, not afraid to take big shots. The way our system is, once he learns it, I think he can be a guy who can fit into that system.”\n\nRaptors head coach Sam Mitchell on Brezec after the first game (via Raptors.com):\n\n“I think he’s excited to be here. I’m saying that in a good way. Everybody wants to play more minutes, even guys who start want to play more minutes and every night you have some guys unhappy. As a coach, you have to understand it. You want guys who want to play. But here is a guy, regardless of how many minutes, when his name is called, he just wants to go play. If he plays with energy and enthusiasm, and we know he can score the ball around the basket, he has a nice little shot. If he gets an opportunity, it’s always been my motto, the guys who are playing well, play. I thought he did well for a guy that really didn’t know what he was doing. He was talking on defense. He was active. For Primoz, he was running the court or kind of leaking out a bit. He battled, and I think somebody with that type of enthusiasm, it can pick you up a little bit, especially when you’re 50 plus games into the season.”\n\nRaptors forward Chris Bosh on Brezec after his first game in Toronto (via Raptors.com):\n\n“We all know who Primoz is. He surprised me with his intensity level. We need that and you could always use intensity especially when you go in to the ladder half of the season. Sometimes trades work out for both guys and I’m sure Primoz is excited to play.”\n\nPistons guard Lindsey Hunter on Dixon (via MLive):\n\n“You know you’re dealing with a guy who won’t crumble in big-game situations. He’s one of those guys that plays his best, in the biggest games. Yeah, he’ll fit in good around here.”\n\nPistons forward Jarvis Hayes on Dixon (via MLive):\n\n“You don’t go through all the stuff he has – and make it out the way he has – without being tough mentally. You’re not going to rattle Juan … that ain’t going to happen.”"
