        "text": "Argentine guard Carlos Delfino told newspaper Ole this week he has not given up on the NBA yet. “From a personal standpoint, for sure I want return with an NBA team,” Delfino said. “Is it a long shot? Very long shot, but I believe in it and have been working towards that goal for a long time. And I’m still doing it. If I have to get minutes somewhere else while waiting for that NBA option, so be it. We’ll see.”\n\nNBA journeyman Carlos Delfino, who hasn’t played in the league since breaking his foot in the 2013 Playoffs, is still hoping to make a comeback. “I still feel like an NBA player,” Delfino said recently to Argentinian basketball publication Basquet Plus, as translated by NBA Reddit user sebs24. “I want to come back to do interesting stuff. That’s my objective.”\n\nStoryline: Carlos Delfino Free Agency"
