        "text": "Kate Middleton received a standing ovation at Sunday’s Wimbledon Tennis Championships — and a lip reader has revealed her sweet reaction.\n\nThe Princess of Wales, 42, made a welcome appearance at the annual grand slam as she continues to undergo cancer treatment following her diagnosis in March.\n\nShe delighted fans as she arrived at the All England Lawn Tennis Club alongside her 9-year daughter, Princess Charlotte, and sister Pippa Middleton.\n\nLip reader Jeremy Freeman analyzed the moment Princess Catherine took her seat next to her daughter as Centre Court erupted into applause and cheer.\n\nMiddleton had asked Charlotte to “come over here” as the pair got to their seats, Freeman told The Sun.\n\nShe then thanked the lady who had accompanied them in the royal box, before turning to the crowd to give a big wave.\n\nThe royal then said “hi” to fellow spectators, before turning to the lady next to her and calling the audience’s reaction to her appearance “so sweet.”\n\nAfter the match, in which Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in straight sets, Princess Catherine presented the trophy to the defending champion and the runner-up.\n\nShe shook both players’ hands before handing them their hard-earned awards.\n\nHer outing comes one month after she joined the royal family for King Charles’ birthday celebrations on the Buckingham Palace balcony at the Trooping the Colour ceremony.\n\nThe Princess was joined by some Hollywood royalty in the royal box during Sunday’s match-up.\n\nActress Julia Roberts and her cinematographer husband, Danny Moder, and actors Tom Cruise and Benedict Cumberbatch were all spotted sitting close to the royal.\n\nAs patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the future queen — an avid tennis fan in her own right — has made an effort to attend the tournament each year and is often spotted watching matches from the royal box on Centre Court.\n\nIn previous years, Middleton attended the men’s and women’s finals and presented the winners and runners-up with their trophies.\n\nAs she showed her support for the annual championships, her husband Prince William headed to Berlin, Germany to cheer on the England Men’s soccer team in their match-up against Spain in the final of the 2024 UEFA European Football Championships.\n\nThe Prince of Wales, 42, who is the president of the Football Association, soccer’s governing body in England, also brought Prince George along to the sporting action."
