        "text": "As you know, the Raptors have agreed to send swingman Carlos Delfino(notes) (right) and guard Roko Ukic(notes) to Milwaukee in exchange for power forward Amir Johnson(notes) (left) and guard Sonny Weems(notes) as part of a four-player trade. Here's what they're saying out in the ether about this blockbuster deal ...\n\nDoug Smith: \"Let's just say this: It clears up a glut at point guard, addresses a minor need for a fourth or maybe fifth big and saves a bit of money starting next summer. I'd have preferred it not include Ukic, who I still think is going to be a pretty good NBA point guard, but he was a distant third here, Douby's cheaper and his contract expires next summer (Roko has a player option at $1.45 million in 2010). So, as much as it's sad to see the kid leave, it makes entire sense. Johnson? Well, he's relatively raw, never quite panned out after the Pistons gave him that three year deal but he'll push Patrick O'Bryant(notes) to be fifth behind Bosh, Bargnani, Rasho and Reggie Evans(notes) and that can't be a bad thing. Weems? Well, if they get anything from him, it'll be a bonus but the fact they don't need to get anything from him, really, makes his addition at a minimum salary a no-brainer. Can't hurt, even if he can't help.\"\n\nBrew Hoop: \"The Bucks really don't care about Sessions. I've been assuming it's true while hoping it wasn't for some time, but the activity of August 17 wasn't encouraging on the Sessions front. In one fell swoop the Bucks added both a backup point guard and a backup shooting guard, and probably cut into the available dollars they have under the luxury tax to re-sign Sessions as well. Because Weems could have been waived for about $550k in savings over the weekend (his $762k deal had just $174k in guarantees), the Bucks effectively shipped out just over $4.1 million in contracts and got back Ukic ($1.35 million) plus whatever Delfino's getting. So if Delfino gets more than around $2.75 million as a first year salary, then the Bucks will have effectively added 09/10 salary through this deal. And with Johnson gone it's also less likely the buy out Thomas, which could have saved $1.3 million as well.\"\n\nRaptors Republic: \"By my count, that is nine new players on this roster. NINE. Seriously, 60% of our roster was assembled during six weeks of whirlwind activity. Integrating them all while fielding a team with playoff designs will be a challenge to say the least. Triano sure has his work cutout for him, and if he fails, I can almost hear the excuses now: 'He had nine new players to work with ...' I don't know about y'all, but I'm freaking wiped out.\"\n\nBucksketball: \"The week before summer league started everyone was excited that Amir Johnson had decided to play. We all agreed it was great to see a veteran get in there and get his hands dirty. How inspiring of him to take the steps to get in sync with his new teammates. He's showing how serious he is about coming in and competing for a starting job in Milwaukee. And then Johnson arrived in Vegas. That's when things quickly unraveled for Amir. Sure, he looked great catching lobs from Brandon Jennings(notes). They looked to have developed some instant chemistry. But how hard can it be for any athletic power forward who wants to run to develop chemistry with a point guard who's always looking to get out in the open court and throw lobs. It's easy to imagine Hakim Warrick(notes) filling the role just as nicely. And with less fouls. Oh those pesky fouls. Johnson's longtime nemesis in Detroit crept back up during summer league. In a league with younger players it was probably of fair importance to the Bucks staff that if Johnson was going to play he'd better show at least some ability to stay out of foul trouble. He did not. Johnson's best efforts were a couple six foul affairs that came in twenty-five and twenty-three minutes. Add the less than spectacular summer league experience with the newly acquired Hakim Warrick and what do you get? Apparently Carlos Delfino.\"\n\nRaptorBlog.com: \"It's getting to the point where it seems like you could substitute Bryan Colangelo's name for Chuck Norris' in the famous list of 'Chuck Norris Facts.' For example: 'Pray that Bryan Colangelo never decides to look directly at the sun. It's a stare down contest and the sun will lose, casting a perpetual night upon us all.' [...] Presumably, Colangelo's logic behind this trade is that he figures that the presence of Marco Belinelli(notes) renders Delfino redundant (although they're not even remotely the same player) and Ukic was going to be, at best, the third point guard in the Raptors' rotation. To all of you who think B.C. gave up on Ukic too soon, I'd like to point out that Ukic is actually 25 years old (although he doesn't look a day older than 17) and I'd argue that it's much easier to teach a 22-year-old how to stay out of foul trouble than it is to teach a 25-year-old how to shoot and develop court vision. If Ukic is ever more than a backup in this league, I will be shocked.\"\n\nThe Knicks Blog: \"From a basketball standpoint, this deal would make a lot of sense for the Raptors. They have already brought in Antoine Wright(notes), DeMar DeRozan(notes), Marco Belinelli and Heod Turkoglu to be in the mix at the SG/ SF spot. Johnson would bring some needed depth up-front. The Raptors have already brought in bunch of new talent this off-season. Up-front, they have added Reggie Evans and Rasho Nesterovic(notes) to play with Bosh and Bargnani. Johnson could be the first forward off the bench there.\""
