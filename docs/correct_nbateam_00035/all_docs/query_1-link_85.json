        "text": "Free agent swingman Carlos Delfino, who is currently mulling a two-year deal from the Houston Rockets, said on Wednesday that he will sign with an NBA team once the Olympics are over. The 2003 first-round draft pick has played the last three seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks, and is currently playing for Argentina in the Olympic Games. ESPN’s Marc Stein has the details, via Twitter: “Ran into Carlos Delfino today. He didn’t want to go into specifics on eve of huge USA game but said he WILL sign w/NBA team after Olympics. Houston, I’m told, actively chasing Delfino, who’s at 15+ ppg on 49% shooting at OLY. Celts want him but can’t afford him, Doc Rivers says.”"
