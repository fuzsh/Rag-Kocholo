        "text": "I've been reading around different columns and the Raptors are very well trying to fill their final roster spot for a third string PF through a trade.\n\nThe most legitimate deal is with the Milwaukee Bucks, who are heavily pursuing Carlos Delfino, according to some Milwaukee and Toronto bloggers and sports columnists. A deal is possibly imminent where the Raptors would sign Delfino to x amount, and then trading him to the Milwaukee Bucks for PF Amir Johnson.\n\nThis is a good thing since we need a third string PF more than we need another swingman. It helps out both teams probably equally, except Milwaukee lost Charlie V. and maybe Ramon Sessions, and Michael Redd and Andrew Bogut are going to have to warm up from coming off of injuries.\n\nWhat this does for the Raptors is give them yet another young prospect, and possibly the second youngest player on the team at age 22. He can only improve and provides depth as a third string PF and center. In my opinion, until POB can prove himself the guys will just keep on stacking above him.\n\nIn my other article, I mentioned that we have problems if an injury occurs. Well, if this deal happens we now have some extra insurance in case of it. This is a very good trade, as I said.\n\nAmir has averaged 3.7 ppg, 1.2 bpg, and 3.8 rpg., which adds even more toughness and defense to the widely criticized \"softness\" of the Raptors. This also marks the end of Pops Mensah-Bonsu's stint with the Raptors at least for now, if this were to go down.\n\nI'll say in advance, good luck to Pops, and hello, to Amir Johnson.\n\nUpdate: Just scrounged up more info that it is a four player deal sending Roko Ukic and Carlos Delfino to Milwaukee for Amir Johnosn and A Mystery Player the deal is going to be done as early as today or tommorow."
