The Toronto Raptors have completed a trade that sends guards Carlos Delfino and Roko Ukic to the Milwaukee Bucks for forward Amir Johnson and swingman Sonny Weems.

Delfino, who turns 27 on Aug. 29, played in Russia last season after signing a three-year deal with the club Khimki Moscow Region. The Raptors retained his NBA rights, and GM Bryan Colangelo facilitated a sign and trade with the Bucks.

"Carlos made it clear he would prefer to play elsewhere if he were to return to the NBA," Colangelo said in a statement Tuesday. "There were limited sign and trade scenarios available, but acquiring Amir Johnson in this deal gives us another long, talented young big man whose best basketball is ahead of him."

The six-foot-9 Johnson, 22, averaged 3.5 points while serving mostly as a reserve for the Detroit Pistons in his fourth NBA season after jumping straight from high school. He was part of a three-team deal in July that landed Milwaukee's Richard Jefferson in San Antonio.

Weems, 23, was good for 1.6 points in 12 games as a Denver Nuggets rookie.

Delfino averaged 9.0 points and 4.4 rebounds per game off the bench in 2007-08, his only season with Toronto.

Ukic, 24, scored 4.2 points as a reserve point guard for the Raptors last season.
