MADRID (NBA) - Spanish international Jorge Garbajosa has welcomed the signing of Carlos Delfino by the Toronto Raptors.

Argentina guard Delfino joined the Canadian franchise earlier this week from the Detroit Pistons and will play alongside Garbajosa next season in Toronto.

Delfino, a member of Argentina's gold medal-winning team at the Olympics in Athens, was a first-round selection by Detroit in 2003.

He played in all 82 games this season, posting career highs of 5.2 points and 3.2 rebounds per game.

"Delfino is a player with great physical strength and has improved his technique a lot," said Toronto power forward Garbajosa.

"I know his game well from our time in Italy."

Garbajosa and Delfino are no strangers to each other, with the Spaniard having played against Delfino in the Italian Lega A from 2002 until 2004.

Garbajosa played for Benetton Treviso while Delfino defended the Fortitudo Bologna colours.

Moreover, both players came face-to-face in last year's FIBA World Championship semi-final, which saw Spain beat Argentina on their road to glory.
