Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe FBA (18 March 1919 â€“ 5 January 2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe or Elizabeth Anscombe, was a British analytic philosopher. She wrote on the philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, philosophical logic, philosophy of language, and ethics. She was a prominent figure of analytical Thomism.

Anscombe was a student of Ludwig Wittgenstein and became an authority on his work and edited and translated many books drawn from his writings, above all his Philosophical Investigations. Anscombe's 1958 article "Modern Moral Philosophy" introduced the term consequentialism into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary virtue ethics. Her monograph Intention is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of intention, action, and practical reasoning can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.

"G.E.M. Anscombe was born on 18 March 1919 the youngest of three children and only daughter of

Alan Wells Anscombe, a science master at Dulwich College in South London, and of his wife Gertrude Elizabeth, after whom she was named. She went up to Oxford in 1937 as a Scholar of St Hugh's College where she read Greats (Classics and Philosophy) and in her first year converted to Catholicism. Shortly thereafter she met another philosopher convert, Peter Geach, whom she married on Boxing Day 1941 (and with whom she was to have three sons and four daughters). Earlier in the same year she had graduated with First Class Honours, secured by the brilliance of her philosophy scripts and in the face of her apparent ignorance of ancient history."
