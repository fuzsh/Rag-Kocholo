        "text": "This dissertation considers whether Alasdair MacIntyre’s reasons for rejecting rights terms are cogent. On my interpretation, MacIntyre makes three main arguments to justify the claim that rights are inimical to virtue ethics. First, MacIntyre offers philosophical arguments to show that rights simply do not exist. Second, MacIntyre argues on the basis of historical evidence that rights are survival terms. And third, MacIntyre argues on the basis of empirical observations of current-day politics that the use of rights language disrupts deliberation about the common good. Taken together, MacIntyre’s philosophical, historical, and empirical arguments constitute a strong critique of rights discourse in contemporary society. My thesis is that MacIntyre’s arguments against rights are susceptible to counterarguments. Briefly, these are my counterarguments: first, it can be argued that rights exist as relations connected with the virtue of justice; second, it is historically the case that the modern senses of the term “rights” emerged in milieu of 12th century canon law, not the milieu of social strife involved in the 14th century property debate which MacIntyre assumed was their origin; and third, the claim that governing institutions of modern nations are wholly dominated by interest groups which allow for no deliberation about the common good is not borne out by the latest empirical political science research. His claim that rights are inimical to virtue ethics is therefore not justified. My conclusion is based on evidence drawn from other virtue ethics philosophers such as Elizabeth Anscombe, from medieval historians who consider the topic of rights such as Brian Tierney, and from a new field in political science called Deliberative Democracy. My plan is to describe MacIntyre’s arguments at length, propose counterarguments against each of them, and show what parts of his virtue ethics account must be altered once his premise rejecting rights is removed. Part of MacIntyre’s project was to show that rights and certain other theories in modern ethics fail on their own terms. By considering more closely what the terms of rights theories entail, I show that not all theories of rights presuppose a rejection of a teleological ordering of human life.\n\nOne of the most significant developments in contemporary International Relations (IR) has been the revival of interest in arguments concerning ethics, but the most interesting critiques of contemporay liberalism from the point of view of international ethics – critiques of the notion of moral obligation itself, put forward by virtue ethicists – have in large part been missed.To understand why the critiques of virtue ethicists matter for international relations and for International Relations, this article first sets out the problem they are responding to. Virtue ethicists argue that the notion of moral obligation employed in contemporary liberalism and, therefore, Western life is foundationless, and that trying to live by rules without foundations can lead to harm. This position is briefly explored through a discussion of the increasing reliance on rules in the form of law in IR, and some recent criticism of the effect of rule-based international action. The article moves on to discuss what virtue ethicists offer in the place of obligation: a focus on character, practical reason and human flourishing, all situated in social contexts. There follows an outline of the few attempts that have been made to relate virtue ethics (VE) to IR, and a discussion of possibilities for future research into this innovative approach. The argument throughout is that a concern with virtue offers us an original way to think about the kind of ethical dilemmas that we face in international relations and IR, by moving away from an unrealistic and ultimately doomed search for universal rules and moral stability and towards the much more challenging, dynamic and rewarding endeavour of developing the practical judgment to answer questions about what it means, as individuals and as groups, located in time and place and politics, to live life well.\n\nI discuss the second of the three theses advanced by Anscombe in 'Modern Moral Philosophy'. The focus is the nature of entities to which – if Anscombe's diagnosis is correct – ought and cognate modals are assumed by modern moral philosophers to refer. I reconstruct the alternative account offered by Anscombe of viable and justified 'Aristotelian' modals – as contrasted with mysterious and unjustified 'Kantian' modals; I discuss the nature and status of 'Aristotelian necessity' to which such legitimate modals refer to. I conclude with the claims that Anscombe's account of modern moral philosophy is viciously parochial, reducing it to Oxford philosophy from the Thirties and Forties and its immediate antecedents; that her historical reconstruction is vitiated by lack of awareness of the existence of law-views of morality preceding Christian theology, artful anticipation of secularization in order to fit her picture of modern moral philosophy as the 'day after' of Christianity; that Aquinas's and her own view of natural morality as made of rational moral judgments laws is incompatible with both her predilection for 'divine law' instead of plain down-to-earth 'natural law'; that her strained reconstruction of a Christian-Jewish-Stoic view of morality as law promulgated by God has little to share with any reconstruction of the Biblical moral traditions meeting academic standard and in more detail there is no possible translation of Torah as Law; and that her criticism hits just targets from the old little British world she was familiar with, while leaving Kantian ethics unaffected.\n\nThe natural law is one of the most enduring of philosophical traditions. By insisting that normativity is based on how things are in fact, the natural law tradition avoids the relativistic implications of the idea that morality is wholly based in features of man's making, whether consensus, feeling, emotion, social construction, convention, performative utterances or human methodology. It promises the possibility of arriving at moral truths by reference to truths of ontology and a metaphysics that is comprehen-sible to human reason. In this, the natural law tradition arguably offers a secure foundation for an understanding of right and wrong, good and evil, virtue and vice, and the common good. Although there are bound to be grey areas and borderline cases in the moral domain, the strength of the natural law approach is most evident where paradigms are concerned. In this paper we consider four ethical paradigms: genocide, disproportionate punishment (e.g. capital punishment for misdemeanours), mass live-birth human cloning, and pathologies like bestiality, incest and consensual cannibalism. Ethical dialogue often repairs to clear cases like these when wholesale doubt threatens dominion. Such examples are typically used to sharpen moral concepts, locate ethical limits and explore moral reasoning. Dealing with Clear Cases: Four Ethical Paradigms Consider four paradigms of wrongdoing. I say these are paradigms of wrongdoing not because I want to presuppose the truth of what I am claiming but because these kinds of examples are typically the sort that might be raised in any meta-ethical dialogue. The examples explore the possibility of objectivity in moral reasoning, the rational limits on human freedom, the proper teleological understanding of humans and their place in the world, and a catalogue of other conceptual apparatus traditionally"
