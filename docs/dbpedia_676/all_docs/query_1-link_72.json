        "text": "Elizabeth Anscombe: Life and Work\n\nJohn Haldane\n\n1\n\n1919 was the year of the birth of three exceptional British women philosophers: Elizabeth Anscombe, Mary Midgley and Iris Murdoch; a fourth, Philippa Foot, who was a contemporary student of theirs at Oxford, was born the following year. Foot, Midgley and Murdoch were undergraduates together at Somerville College, while Anscombe studied at St Hugh’s, but she and Foot were later academic colleagues at Somerville for almost a quarter of a century. Women were not formally admitted to Oxford as members of the University until 1920 and at the time when these four came up (between 1937 and 1939) there was still a sense that female undergraduates were a novelty. It is remarkable, therefore, that within a decade of beginning their studies Anscombe, Foot and Murdoch held Oxford college fellowships. (Midgley settled into a university career later). Not only that but they came to prominence within professional philosophy and are seen individually and collectively as having reoriented ethics away from the emotivism and subjectivism that had begun to take hold at Oxford during their student days through the influence of A.J. Ayer and been developed in the decade following the end of the Second World War by R.M. Hare.\n\nWhat accounts for the rise, confidence and success of this female quartet so soon after the formal admission of women into the University and in a period when Oxford philosophy was associated with a group of brilliant and powerful men: A.J. Ayer, J.L. Austin, Isaiah Berlin, Stuart Hampshire, H.L.A. Hart and Gilbert Ryle? Four factors suggest themselves: backgrounds, personalities, abilities and opportunities. Anscombe, Midgley and Murdoch all attended private girls schools that aimed to build their pupil’s confidence - the motto of Anscombe’s was ‘fear nothing’ - while Foot was educated by private tutors. All four had a strong sense of their own identities and were resistant to condescension or intimidation. Again, all four were awarded first class honours degrees.\n\nWhile these factors may have contributed much to their self-assurance, there were two special circumstances that provided significant opportunities for them to develop as philosophers. First, there was the fact of their mutual companionship, and second, the onset of World War Two and especially the period from the German invasion of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in May 1940 when men began to enlist or be conscripted into the military thereby shifting the balance of the sexes in the undergraduate population at Oxford and removing a number of the leading younger dons and fellows including Austin, Hampshire, Hart and Ryle which collectively changed the style, tone and subjects of discussion. Mary Midgley has made this point on several occasions, as in the following:\n\n[T]he reason [why quite well-known female philosophers emerged from Oxford soon after the war] was indeed that there were fewer men about then. The trouble is not, of course, men as such - men have done good enough philosophy in the past. What is wrong is a particular style of philosophising that results from encouraging a lot of clever young men to compete in winning arguments. These people then quickly build up a set of games out of simple oppositions and elaborate them until, in the end, nobody else can see what they are talking about. All this can go on until somebody from outside the circle finally explodes it by moving the conversation on to a quite different topic, after which the games are forgotten ... By contrast, in those wartime classes - which were small - men (conscientious objectors etc) were present as well as women, but they weren’t keen on arguing. It was clear that we were all more interested in understanding this deeply puzzling world than in putting each other down. That was how Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Iris Murdoch, Mary Warnock [who came up to Oxford in 1942] and I, in our various ways, all came to think out alternatives to the brash, unreal style of philosophising - based essentially on logical positivism - that was current at the time. And these were the ideas that we later expressed in our own writings.[1]\n\nThere is a further fact which was the precocious philosophical ability and passion of Anscombe, who was acknowledged among them as being the most natively brilliant of the group and who influenced them all philosophically but particularly in the rejection of moral scepticism and subjectivism.\n\n2\n\nElizabeth Anscombe was certainly a remarkable and formidable woman, and an outstanding philosopher. Orders of intellectual greatness are hard to assign, particularly when the subject in question belongs to one’s own time, but there is no question that Anscombe was one of the most gifted and accomplished philosophers of the twentieth century. Her work will continue to be read long into the future, and a place for her in the history of philosophy is assured.\n\nHer contemporary peers include the Americans Roderick Chisholm, Donald Davidson, Van Quine and Wilfred Sellars; the British Austin, Ayer, Ryle and Peter Strawson; and the Europeans Hannah Arendt, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur and Simone Weil. Given the dense and complex character of her work and its often unorthodox conclusions it has not received the same attention as most of these others, but as study of her writings increases it is likely the estimate of her can only increase and I would say that she is at least the equal of the best of those listed. She was not a genius of the order of her teacher and friend Wittgenstein, but he may be the only twentieth-century figure securely in that category; and he does not qualify as a contemporary peer, having been born in the nineteenth century and only barely survived into the second half of the twentieth.\n\nConsidering her place in the category of women philosophers she is the clear leader, marked out by her creativity, imagination, industry, insight, range and rigour. There is also a kind of singularity about her work: she proceeds directly to the topic of her investigation, makes few references to contemporaries or to current trends, writes in a concentrated and often indirect manner, eschews academic jargon, generally avoids footnotes and sometimes ends with an expression of perplexity. Again, unlike most philosophers of her standing, she engaged in philosophical analysis and argumentation before non-academic audiences. In this connection, while she proportioned the depth of her thinking to their likely knowledge and comprehension she never resorted to glibness or misleading oversimplification.\n\nWherein lies her greatness? Among the elements composing this were her intellectual commitment, stamina and toughness. Of themselves these do not make for brilliance, but without them there tends only to be, at best, unsustained cleverness. In addition she had tremendous powers of analysis and argument. She also had a nose for fakes and mistakes, not the superficial yet pervasive sort that characterize the work of most philosophers in any period, but the deeper kind that give rise to ways of thinking that seem inescapable until the error and the escape routes are pointed out. Into this category fall Descartes’ and Locke’s accounts of mind as co-extensive with consciousness, and of thought as only causally related to the world; Hume’s arguments regarding fact, value and practical normativity, and causality; and Kant’s disconnection of reason from nature. Moving down a league, there are Bentham’s obliteration of the intended/foreseen consequence distinction, Quine’s double standard as regards extensional/scientific and intensional/everyday discourses, and Hare’s description/prescription gap. All of these were the subject of insightful and destructive Anscombean critiques.\n\nThe Philosophical Lexicon in one of its less clever and less witty entries gives two definitions of the verb Anscombe:\n\nv. (1) To gather for safe-keeping. ‘She anscombed with all the notes and letters.’\n\n(2) To go over carefully, with a fine-tooth comb, in an oblique direction.\n\nThe first refers to her work as editor and translator of Wittgenstein; the second to her philosophical style. More apt, and deserving of the noun form Anscombes, would have been what Dennett writes in definition of Bernard Williams: The dream-sensation of running for one’s life while wearing diving boots. ‘His comments on my paper gave me the [Anscombes].’ Such were her analytical powers that the idea of being a focus of Anscombe’s critical attention might occasion nightmares. She was invariably frank, often brusque and sometimes harsh. I am not sure whether she intended to be rude, though something perceived as such might be in evidence where she regarded what had been said as stupid or vacuous, or suspected vainglorious pretension. In any event, the simple fact of her applying her intelligence to claims and arguments would be enough to occasion anxiety, though she was also a supportive tutor and supervisor.\n\nElizabeth Anscombe died on 5 January 2001, within days of the passing of Quine with whom, through her husband Peter Geach, she had formed a personal friendship. While they were united in their attachment to rigour, to a belief in the importance of logic and to a conviction that philosophy had been transformed by the work of Gottlob Frege, their own philosophical outlooks and conclusions could not have been more different: he being one of the foremost proponents of scientific materialism, she a teenage convert to Roman Catholicism and a lifelong advocate of theological orthodoxy. Additionally, while Quine thought of philosophy as closely aligned with science and due to develop as the latter progressed, Anscombe, while respectful of science per se, was anti-scientistic and sceptical of attempts to solve philosophical questions by appealing to empirical theories. She also had no inclination to suppose that contemporary philosophy was in general an improvement on the thought of the past. In general, perhaps because there were more great figures there, and because Wittgenstein had dismantled the philosophy of Descartes which separated modern thought from its predecessors, she tended to look to earlier times rather than to the present or recent past. She had a particular feeling for philosophers from the pre-modern period, particularly Plato, Aristotle, Anselm and Aquinas, but also, though she studied them less, Spinoza and Kierkegaard. Of her contemporaries and juniors, she appreciated the work of her friends Georg Von Wright, Philippa Foot and Arthur Prior, and that of Saul Kripke.\n\n3\n\nGertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe was born on 18 March 1919, the youngest of three children and only daughter of Alan Wells Anscombe, a science master at Dulwich College in South London, and of his wife Gertrude Elizabeth, a classics teacher, after whom she was named. Her father was an atheist and her mother a nominal Anglican. Before she entered her teenage years and up to the middle of them Elizabeth discovered Roman Catholicism by reading a book on the lives and work of Elizabethan English recusant priests, and read her way into the Catholic faith; but her parents were strongly opposed to her wish to become a Catholic and it was only on leaving Sydenham High School for Girls and getting to St Hugh’s College Oxford that she felt free to receive instruction preparatory to admission to the Church.\n\nAt Oxford she studied Greats (Classics and Philosophy) and in her first year became a Roman Catholic. Shortly thereafter she met Peter Geach, another philosopher convert, while both were in a Corpus Christi procession at the Servite Priory of St. Philip a few miles north of Oxford. Like her, he had been receiving instruction from the Dominican Fr. Richard Kehoe of Blackfriars, Oxford. They became engaged shortly thereafter and married at the Brompton Oratory in London on St. Stephen’s Day (December 26) 1941. Earlier in the same year Anscombe had graduated with First Class Honours, secured by the brilliance of her philosophy scripts and in the face of her apparently comprehensive ignorance of ancient history.\n\nMiss Anscombe, as she continued to be called, even by Geach (and through the course of having seven children), crossed in 1942 to Cambridge to take up the Sarah Simpson post-graduate research studentship at Newnham College. It was in Cambridge that she met Wittgenstein, who then held the Chair of Philosophy and whose lectures she attended, becoming increasingly enthusiastic about his revolutionary ideas. Writing in 1945 to Myra Curtis, Principal of Newnham, Wittgenstein refers to her as Mrs G.E.M. Geach, saying that She is undoubtedly the most talented female student I have had since 1930 when I began to lecture ... There is very good reason to expect that she will produce sound and interesting work in Philosophy. By 1946 she had returned to Oxford as a research fellow at Somerville College, where she remained in one or another capacity (as college lecturer 1951, university lecturer 1958, and official college fellow from 1964) until her appointment to the Chair of Philosophy at Cambridge in 1970.\n\nBetween first meeting him and returning to Oxford, Anscombe maintained contact with Wittgenstein, travelling to Cambridge once a week to meet with him. In the course of that year 1946–1947 they became close friends. Wittgenstein was obsessive about the originality of his own thought and somewhat misogynistic; she was one of the few academics he ever trusted, and he would address her affectionately as old man. Although he is quoted by Norman Malcolm as saying of Anscombe and of another philosopher convert, Yorick Smithies, that he could not possibly believe all the things they believe, in his final year, when he knew he was dying, Wittgenstein asked Anscombe to put him in touch with a non-philosophical priest. That she did, calling upon Fr. Conrad Pepler, O.P., of Blackfriars, Cambridge. Notwithstanding that she effected the introduction, however, Anscombe never presumed that Wittgenstein had resumed the faith of his childhood, and speculations to that effect are fanciful. Early versions of these may have been encouraged by the following facts: (1) Fr. Pepler did administer the last rites while Wittgenstein was still alive (though he had fallen into unconsciousness by then), (2) he was given a Catholic burial, and (3) members of his family subsequently arranged for the printing and distribution of an in memoriam card which in Catholic circles would normally be taken to indicate that the person remembered, and for whom prayers were sought, had died a practising Catholic. Anscombe regretted any encouragement that may have been given by these facts to the belief that Wittgenstein had returned to the Catholic faith.\n\nPreparation for the task of translating Wittgenstein’s work (written in German) had begun while he was still alive, but now she and the other two literary executors and editors (G. von Wright and Rush Rhees) set about the project of bringing material to publication. Anscombe took the lead in this, and the appearance in 1953 of her translation of Wittgenstein’s masterpiece Philosophical Investigations was, without any question, one of the major turning points in twentieth-century philosophy.\n\nThis was followed by her translations of other works: Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics (1956), Notebooks 1914–1916 (1961), Zettel (1967) and (with Denis Paul) On Certainty (1969). She also concerned herself with Wittgenstein’s earlier philosophy, publishing An Introduction to Wittgenstein’s Tractatus (1959), and together with Geach translated Descartes’ Philosophical Writings (1954).\n\nAnscombe’s appreciation of philosophers with whom she disagreed profoundly (principally Descartes and Hume) was marked, as was her range. She could write authoritatively, using her own translations, of Plato, Aristotle, Anselm, Aquinas, Descartes, Frege and Wittgenstein. But first and foremost she was neither an historian, a translator, nor an editor, but an original philosopher. Her short book Intention, first published in 1957 and republished by Harvard University Press in 2000, is universally regarded as a classic account of the nature of intentional behaviour, and as the founding text of the theory of action. In it she argued that intentional actions are ones to which a particular sense of the question why? applies: one which seeks a reason that is provided either by identifying a backward-looking factor, such as that the agent is rectifying a failing or wrong, or a forward-looking one such as an immediate aim or further objective. Additionally, the performance of such actions is known to the agent non-observationally.\n\nAnscombe’s motive in investigating intention was her perplexity and frustration at attempts to excuse or minimize culpability by saying that an agent only intended immediate acts and that their foreseen and desired consequences were something distinct for which he might not be morally responsible. Thus she forged a link between philosophical and moral psychology which was further adverted to in her 1958 article Modern Moral Philosophy, which introduced the term consequentialism into the English language. The writing of this had resulted in part from the desire to see what moral philosophers had to say about the determinants of the value of actions, and in part from the practical need to read ethical texts in preparation for tutoring the subject in Oxford which she had agreed to do in order to allow her Somerville College colleague Philippa Foot to take a period of study leave. Yet it is rightly credited as being the principal cause of the revival of an ethics focussed on virtue rather than on rule or outcome. However, Anscombe never supposed that the whole of ethics could be done in terms of the concept of virtue and on that account she cannot correctly be termed a virtue ethicist.\n\nSimilarly, Causality and Determination, her inaugural lecture as Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge, subverted - and some believe refuted - a centuries’ old orthodoxy about the nature of causation: namely, that it is essentially necessitarian and/or lawlike. Instead she treated the notion of causality as an abstraction formed on the basis of particular verbal descriptions such as cutting, pushing, tearing and so on, which are deployed in everyday observation and explanation. To the extent that there is a unifying core to these and hence to the notion of causality more generally, it is, she suggested, that of derivativeness, of one thing coming from or being due to another. This approach connects with other themes in her work on epistemology and metaphysics, where she subverts empiricist accounts and in the process blocks one route to scepticism. For Anscombe, here developing ideas from Wittgenstein, concepts which are specific instances of ones of substance, causation and value are not got by abstraction from experience but brought to it through the grammar of language. It is not a discovery that gold is a substance for gold is a substantival term.\n\nAs indicated here, Anscombe’s work was for the most part highly academic, usually difficult to comprehend, and often combative in expression. It sometimes took readers years to see the point of what she was arguing, but this was because she always took on the hardest problems and had no time for slick presentation. Rush Rhees quoted Wittgenstein as often saying go the bloody hard way; this is a direction Anscombe appears to have taken to heart. She is reported to have said to A.J. Ayer, if you didn’t talk so quickly, people wouldn’t think you were so clever - though, in fairness his reply should also be quoted: if you didn’t talk so slowly, people wouldn’t think you were so profound.\n\nFrom her student days, however, she had discussed and written about issues of moral, political and religious interests. In 1939 she co-authored a then highly controversial pamphlet predicting that Britain’s conduct in the Second World War would be unjust, and in 1956–1957 she protested the award by the University of Oxford of an honorary degree to President Truman, charging that he had commanded the murderous use of nuclear weapons against innocent Japanese civilians. Troubled by how people found it easy to defend Truman, she came to the conclusion that they failed to understand the nature of his actions, and showed in Intention that in doing one thing (moving one’s hand) one may intentionally be doing another (directing the death of human beings).\n\nIn 1948, in debate with C.S. Lewis at the Socratic Club in Oxford, she demolished his favoured argument for the self-refuting character of naturalism. Where some apologists viewed this as giving comfort to the enemy (atheism), Anscombe characteristically saw herself as simply exposing bad argumentation. Her own verdict on the event that it was an occasion of sober discussion of certain quite definite criticisms, which Lewis’s rethinking and rewriting showed he thought were accurate seems the correct one. In any event, no one could seriously doubt her belief in the value of Christian apologetics if they read the likes of her pamphlets On Transubstantiation (1974) and Contraception and Chastity (1977), where she argued passionately in favour of traditional Catholic teachings.\n\nIn 1967 Anscombe was elected Fellow of the British Academy. She subsequently received a number of other distinctions, including foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1982 she was awarded the Aquinas Medal by the American Catholic Philosophical Association, and in 1999 (along with Peter Geach) the papal medal Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice. Three volumes of Anscombe’s Collected Papers were published in 1981: From Parmenides to Wittgenstein; Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Mind; and Ethics, Religion and Politics. Two collections of papers were dedicated to her: Intention and Intentionality (1979) and Logic, Cause and Action (2000), and together with Geach she was the recipient of a volume of essays, Moral Truth and Moral Tradition (1994), published to honour their fifty years of marriage.\n\nSince Anscombe’s death four further collections of her writings have been published in the same series as the present volume: Human Life, Action and Ethics (2005), Faith in a Hard Ground (2009), From Plato to Wittgenstein (2011) and Logic, Truth and Meaning (2015), and several collections of essays and studies of her work have appeared. The current book adds further to the growing library of writings by and about Anscombe (the main items of which are specified below) which is built upon and is further contributing to the renaissance of interest in her work. This promises to have several good outcomes. First, we will understand better the work of hers that was already known. Second, we will gain further insight into areas and developments within her philosophy through engaging with hitherto unknown or neglected material. Third, we will be able to bring this knowledge to the ongoing effort to understand and resolve, so far as that is ever possible, some of the central questions of philosophy.\n\nOne of Anscombe’s last pieces of philosophical writing was characteristically quirky but likewise also suggestive of hitherto unseen lines of enquiry. In Russelm or Anselm?, Philosophical Quarterly, 43 (1993), she defended the thesis that Anselm’s argument of Proslogion 2 could be saved from the stupidity of an Ontological Argument by deletion of a comma. This rests on the claim that in \"Si enim in solo intellectu est, potest cogitari esse et in re, quod maius est the second (later editorial) comma ought to be omitted; in which interpretation (if that than which nothing greater can be thought of exists only in the mind, something which is greater can be conceived to exist also in reality\"), the argument does not treat existence as a property of objects and so does not fall foul of Kant’s objection. Writing of her defence Anscombe remarked:\n\n[I have] thought harder about Anselm’s argument than I did before. But I still think that I haven’t thought hard enough. I don’t know whether Anselm’s argument is valid or invalid - only that it is a great deal more interesting than its common interpretation makes it.\n\nThe scholarship, imagination, boldness and honesty evident in this essay characterized her work as a philosopher and may serve as an inspiration to her admirers.\n\n1 ‘The Golden Age of Female Philosophy’, Mary Midgley letter to the Guardian, 28 November 2013. See also her Owl of Minerva: A Memoir (London: Routledge, 2005).\n\nElizabeth Anscombe at Oxford\n\nAnthony Kenny\n\nThe first lecture series I attended when I went to Oxford as a graduate philosophy student in 1957 was a course on Thought and Action given by Stuart Hampshire, who published a book of the same title two years later.[1] He began by telling us all to read Miss Anscombe’s recently published Intention.[2] It was indeed the publication of this short book of fewer than one hundred pages which established her as an influential philosopher in her own right. Her account of the nature of one’s knowledge of one’s own intentional actions and her development of Aristotle’s discussion of practical reasoning set the terms of several debates that continue to the present day.\n\nAnscombe had already become famous in Oxford, but not for theoretical philosophy. In 1956 the University offered an honorary degree to the U.S. President who had authorized the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Anscombe opposed the proposal, arguing in a pamphlet, Mr Truman’s Degree, that it was monstrous to honour a man responsible for two massacres. She set out the doctrine of the just war, as developed long ago by Catholic theologians such as Suarez and Protestant jurists such as Grotius. According to that doctrine nothing could justify the deliberate killing of non-combatants in war.\n\nAnscombe did not succeed in persuading her fellow dons: only four people voted against the conferment of the degree, and the inside cover of Truman’s Degree bears the words Dedicated with respect, but without permission, to the others who said ‘Non placet’. Surprisingly, however, the theory of the just war - which had been almost totally forgotten during the 1939–45 war - has gradually become accepted not only in ecclesiastical circles but also in official and military ones. In the last decade, for instance, several of the cardinal principles of that doctrine were enunciated in the counter-insurgency manual issued by General Petraeus to the U.S. forces under his command, which declares, among other things, that Soldiers and Marines are not permitted to use force disproportionately or indiscriminately and goes on to state that:\n\n7.31 The principle of proportionality requires that the anticipated loss of life and damage to property incidental to attacks must not be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.\n\n7.34 Discrimination requires combatants to differentiate between enemy combatants, who represent a threat, and noncombatants, who do not. In conventional operations, this restriction means that combatants cannot intend to harm noncombatants, though proportionality permits them to act, knowing some noncombatants may be harmed.[3]\n\nThe revival of the theory, I believe, is due more to Elizabeth Anscombe than to any other individual.\n\nIntention was followed up by an influential paper of 1958, Modern Moral Philosophy.[4] Its first paragraph proclaims a resounding thesis:\n\nThe concepts of obligation and duty - moral obligation and moral duty, that is to say, and of what is morally right and wrong, and of the moral sense of ought, ought to be jettisoned if this is psychologically possible; because they are survivals, or derivatives of survivals, from an earlier conception of ethics which no longer generally survives, and are only harmful without it.[5]\n\nAccording to Anscombe, Aristotle, though he has much to say about the virtues and vices, has no concept answering to our term moral. It was, she says, Christianity, taking its moral notions from the Torah, that introduced a law conception of ethics. Conformity to the virtues and avoidance of the vices henceforth became a requirement of divine law.\n\nNaturally it is not possible to have such a conception unless you believe in God as a lawgiver; like Jews, Stoics and Christians. But if such a conception is dominant for many centuries, and then is given up, it is a natural result that the concepts of obligation, of being bound or required as by a law, should remain though they had lost their root; and if the word ought has become invested in certain contexts with the sense of obligation, it too will remain to be spoken with a special emphasis and a special feeling in these contexts. It is as if the notion criminal were to remain when criminal law and criminal courts had been abolished and forgotten.[6]\n\nAnscombe agreed with the then current shibboleth that one cannot infer an ought - a moral ought - from an is; but that was because this special moral ought has become a word of mere mesmeric force, once the notion of a divine lawgiver has been dropped.\n\nThe notions of duty, and of moral right and wrong, Anscombe proposed, should be discarded in favour of the notions of justice and injustice, which had a genuine content. Even of these notions it remained difficult to give a clear account, until we had a satisfactory philosophical psychology. For one cannot analyse the concepts of justice and virtue unless one has a satisfactory account of such terms as action, intention, pleasure and wanting.\n\nAnscombe had already herself made a monumental contribution to this area of philosophy in Intention, a book which was taken as a model by many later investigators. There was little explicit moralizing in the text, but the clarification of the notion of intention enabled her to play a significant part in fundamental philosophical and legal debates.\n\nMoral philosophers, according to Anscombe, could be divided into absolutists and consequentialists. Absolutists believe that there are some kinds of action that are intrinsically wrong, and should never be done, irrespective of any consideration of consequences. Consequentialists believe that the morality of actions should be judged by their foreseen consequences, and that there is no category of act which may not, in special circumstances, be justified by its consequences. Prior to Bentham most philosophers were absolutists, because they believed in a natural law, or natural rights. If there are natural rights and a natural law, then some kinds of action, actions that violate those rights or conflict with that law, are wrong, no matter what the consequences. But Bentham scorned the notions of natural law and natural rights.\n\nIn the 1950s many moral philosophers rejected Bentham’s utilitarianism, accusing it of committing a naturalistic fallacy.[7] Nonetheless, most of them were consequentialists (as became abundantly clear in the discussions of Truman’s use of the atom bomb). Every one of the best known English academic ethicists, Anscombe claimed, has put out a philosophy according to which, e.g. it is not possible to hold that it cannot be right to kill the innocent as a means to any end whatsoever and that someone who thinks otherwise is in error. She pointed out that this put them at odds with the Hebrew and Christian moral tradition, which was absolutist.\n\nIn Intention Anscombe presented a concept of intention as an operation of the will rather than of the intellect. One intended one’s chosen ends, and the means selected to those ends. At the time she wrote, however, the concept of intention dominant in the thinking of legal academic writers and in the judgments of the courts was a Benthamite one in which whatever an agent foresaw as the result of his action was something that he intended. H.L.A. Hart wrote that for the law a foreseen outcome is enough, even if it was unwanted by the agent ... the law does not require in such cases that the outcome should have been something intended in the sense that the accused set out to achieve it, either as a means or an end, and here the law diverges from what is ordinarily meant by expressions like ‘he intentionally killed those men’.[8]\n\nA number of legal decisions in the 1950s and 1960s appeared to enshrine the Benthamite interpretation of intention into the definition of murder as killing with malice aforethought. However, some legal writers, influenced by Anscombe, argued for a voluntarist interpretation of the notion of intention. Foremost among these was John Finnis, who in a paper of 1991, Intention and Side Effects, claimed that the confusion concerning intention in the English law of homicide had been cleared up by a number of recent decisions.[9] The courts, he claimed, had begun to make a sharp distinction between intention and foresight: the fact that one foresees a certain result as likely or even certain to follows from one’s action(s) does not entail that one intends that result. Sadly, legal decisions in murder cases since 1991 have not reflected the acute philosophical distinctions championed by Anscombe and Finnis.\n\nIn the late 1950s the dominant figure in Oxford moral philosophy was R.M. Hare, then a tutor at Balliol. In reaction to the previously fashionable emotivism, Hare was anxious to make room in ethics for logic. In The Language of Morals he pointed out that there is a logic of imperatives no less than a logic of assertion, and he drew on this to expound a theory of moral reasoning. He distinguished between prescriptive and descriptive meaning. A descriptive statement is one whose meaning is defined by the factual conditions for its truth. A prescriptive sentence is one which entails, perhaps in conjunction with descriptive statements, at least one imperative. To assent to an imperative is to prescribe action, to tell oneself or others to do this or do that. To make a moral judgment is to issue an imperative which applies universally, to oneself as to all others in similar situations.\n\nHare distinguished between ethics and morals. Ethics is the study of the general features of moral language, of which prescriptivity and universalizability are the most important; moral judgments are prescriptions and prohibitions of specific actions. In principle, ethics is neutral between different and conflicting moral systems. But this does not mean that ethics is practically vacuous: once an understanding of ethics is combined with the desires and beliefs of an actual moral agent, it can lead to concrete and important moral judgments.\n\nAnscombe detested Hare’s moral philosophy, which in its practical results, she believed, differed little from utilitarianism - a judgment which his own later writings confirmed. But the academic assault on Hare she left to her husband Peter Geach and her Somerville colleague, Philippa Foot. Foot, I believe, was the only Oxford philosophy colleague with whom she was entirely comfortable. That did not mean that there were no differences between them - most obviously, Foot was an atheist and Anscombe a Catholic - but each had complete respect for the other. (From time to time Elizabeth would lament to me that she felt quite unable to offer Philippa a proof of the existence of God.)\n\nThe senior Oxford philosophers at this time were Gilbert Ryle (Waynflete Professor of Metaphysics), John Austin (White’s Professor of Moral Philosophy), H.H. Price (Wykeham Professor of Logic) and Herbert Hart (Professor of Jurisprudence). Price was by that time generally regarded as superannuated and his tenure as Wykeham Professor was moving to an end. Ryle and Anscombe were kept aloof from each other by their differing relationships to Wittgenstein. (Elizabeth told me that while reading Ryle’s Concept of Mind shortly after it appeared in 1949 she went to meet Wittgenstein off a train, and felt obliged to conceal the book under a wrapper. This did not prevent the great man from snorting with disapproval when he discovered what she was reading.) In his book Mental Acts (1957) Peter Geach had criticized Ryle severely - but Ryle was not overprotective of his works and seemed to me to bear no grudge.\n\nAnscombe and Austin, however, detested each other cordially. Austin would refuse to discuss Anscombe’s writings when invited to do so by students attending his informal instruction; she, in her turn, would say scornfully that she expected any day that some student would report to her that Austin had discovered a difference between enough and sufficient. Anscombe had, on the other hand, a qualified respect for Hart. She gave me his Causation in the Law [10] to read - but praising it on the specific grounds that its preface exhibited clearly the complete bankruptcy of contemporary philosophical ideas of causality.\n\nAs a graduate student, I was never officially supervised by Anscombe. It was she, however, who suggested to me the topic of my dissertation, namely the intentionality of psychological verbs. The topic was approved by the philosophy sub-faculty, and I was assigned Antony Quinton as my supervisor - the beginning of a lifelong friendship. Anscombe gave me access to appropriate unpublished papers of Wittgenstein, and Quinton was a wonderful guide to contemporary philosophical literature.\n\nAnscombe was extremely welcoming to graduate students who had a serious interest in philosophy. She kept open house in 27 St. John Street - one could drop in at any hour of day or night and start a discussion of a philosophical problem. She had a houseful of children, to whom she would attend from time to time, but that did not interrupt the flow of philosophy. She was also in those days a chain smoker, dropping her butts into a huge wooden bowl. It was only in later years, as a tutor myself beset with the enthusiasms of young graduate students, that I came to appreciate fully the generosity with which she made herself available.\n\nAmong my many memories of these discussions, one stays in my mind. A fellow student who also enjoyed discussions with Anscombe was Tom Nagel. One evening, trying"
