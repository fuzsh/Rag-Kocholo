        "text": "E. Anscombe's writings on moral psychology offer valuable insights to link human language, facts, and their relationship with social life. The efforts of the Cambridge philosopher to broaden the horizons of British moral thought imply the projection of the physical order on personal and collective actions. The application of her rediscovery of moral intentionality to the ethics of life brings to the fore the importance of the links between present activities and future states of affairs. This becomes much more relevant with regard to the connection between the human will and the ability to involve ourselves in magnanimous projects. This paper will focus on the efforts of Anscombe and Philippa Foot to explain the mental actions that enable humans to foresee the outcomes of their behaviour and its consequences on society. The dynamic character of human interactions in the creation of hope will be at the centre of the following study. \"The only reliable politicians are dead ones\". Anonymous\n\nAlthough Anscombe’s moral philosophy is often described as an “absolutism”, commentators on Anscombe have confused what kind of absolutism she held. In this paper, I argue that to properly understand Anscombe’s position on ethical absolutism one must see it as essentially tied to her work on intention and not on external activities performed. When Anscombe’s view is understood in such a manner, it renders her moral philosophy more closely harmonious not only with her other philosophical works, but the Catholic intellectual tradition especially Thomism. And while one might extrapolate from this harmony Anscombe’s indebtedness to this tradition, one might just as easy see her philosophical work as itself being a clarifying force for contemporary accounts of ethics in the Catholic tradition. To be able to accomplish this, the paper first argues for a proper understanding of Anscombe’s ethical absolutism according to her contemporary commentators. One I have established this proper understanding, I indicate how, in the second part of the paper, ethicists working more directly in the Catholic intellectual tradition are closer to Anscombe’s authentic ethical account of absolutism than her own commentators. After exploring a place of seemingly inflexible disagreement for contemporary Catholic ethicists, I lay out how Anscombe’s account of intention can both illuminate the nature of her ethical absolutism and simultaneously contribute to that tradition from which she at least seems to have received.\n\nI discuss the third of Anscombe’s theses from “Modern Moral Philosophy”, namely that post-Sidgwickian consequentialism makes the worst action acceptable. I scrutinize Anscombe’s comprehension of “consequentialism”, her reconstruction of Sidgwick’s view of intention, her defence of a new kind of casuistry, her view of morality as based on Divine commands, her recourse to theodicy in order to save absolute prohibitions. In my conclusions I suggest that Anscombe’s view of divine law is a strange notion, more modern and British than Biblical or Scholastic; Anscombe uncritically accepts an impoverished image of Kantian ethics and intuitionism, which was, ironically, an unaware bequest from her consequentialist opponents.\n\nPhilosophers commonly talk of Anscombe's book Intention as a single unified account produced at a particular moment in time. Yet we share a tendency to refer to the text of the second (1963) edition while citing the first (1957) one. Between these two there also lies the 1958 second impression of the first edition, which already contained some significant alterations noted by Anscombe herself.This paper offers a detailed consideration of the differences between these three publications, as well as her earlier Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society article 'Intention'. In what follows I catalogue the various changes she made with the aim of clarifying whether it makes sense, in light of them, to talk of an early and late Intention. I conclude that while this would be going too far, Anscombe’s views on action description and practical reasoning have changed in ways in which it would be profitable for philosophers of action and moral psychology to track.\n\nWhat is intentional action? In her (1957) 'Intention', Anscombe appeared to give not one, but two answers: first, intentional actions are actions to which a special sense of the question ‘Why?’ is applicable, and second, they form a sub-class of the things a person knows without observation. It is implausible that she thinks of 'intentional action' as ambiguous, but she gives no explicit account of how these two characterisations converge on a single phenomenon. This sets up an interpretative puzzle which I solve by elucidating her two characterisations in concert with several other key concepts in 'Intention', including, 'practical reasons', the sui generis kind of explanation these provide, the distinction between 'practical' and 'speculative' knowledge, the formal features which mark this distinction, and Anscombe's characterisation of practical knowledge as knowledge 'in intention'."
