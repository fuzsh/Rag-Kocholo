        "text": "Philosopher and pupil of Wittgenstein whose conversion to Roman Catholicism sparked her interest in the nature of morality\n\nPROFESSOR G E M ANSCOMBE, who has died aged 81, was Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge from 1970 until 1986; much of her writing dealt with the nature of morality and with the meaning and limits of language, concerns she inherited from Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose literary executor she was.\n\nElizabeth Anscombe first encountered Wittgenstein when she was a postgraduate student at Cambridge during the Second World War, and even after she was appointed to a research fellowship at Somerville College, Oxford, would travel back to Cambridge once a week to have tutorials with him.\n\nShe became one of his most trusted students, and by the time of his death in 1951 was a close friend. He sometimes stayed at her house in Oxford. This was a rarity, since as a rule Wittgenstein did not enjoy the company of female philosophers.\n\nFor her part, she said that his therapeutic method (which stressed the non-existence of a definitive form of language discoverable by philosophers) was a tremendous liberation which had freed her from philosophical confusion. Her translation of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, which appeared posthumously in 1953, was one of the great moments of modern philosophy, revealing as it did Wittgenstein's rejection of many of the assumptions of the work that had made his name in 1921, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.\n\nShe followed it in 1959 with An Introduction to Wittgenstein's Tractatus, a now classic examination of the influence of Friedrich Frege and Bertrand Russell (both mathematical logicians) on Wittgenstein's work. She was, however, never an uncritical admirer of his thought.\n\nElizabeth Anscombe twice came to wider attention with attacks on two well-known public figures. In 1948, she read a paper at the Oxford Socratic Club which dealt heavily with C S Lewis's recently published Miracles, and indeed with his entire intellectual approach to faith. The criticism left Lewis \"in very low spirits\", and he never again wrote straightforward polemics for Christianity, preferring instead to communicate his beliefs through fiction.\n\nEight years later, in 1956, she caused something of a sensation when she opposed the conferment of an honorary degree by Oxford on President Truman. In her essay Mr Truman's Degree she pointed out that he had been responsible for the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that the consequent death of innocents, even as a necessary means to an end, remained murder. \"You may not do evil,\" ran her injunction, \"that good may come.\"\n\nShe offered to pay Â£100 to one of Truman's supporters, the American A L Goodhart, Master of University College, if he could justify the bombing under international law. Such a gesture was characteristic of the force with which she held her convictions, but her proposal to withhold the degree was comprehensively defeated in Convocation.\n\nGertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe was born on March 18 1919 and educated at Sydenham High School and St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she took a First in Greats. As a teenager she had converted to Roman Catholicism, a decision that was to affect her work as a moral philosopher. For her it was a prerequisite of an adequate moral philosophy that it should not deny the value of the Hebrew-Christian ethic.\n\nIn the autumn of 1939, while still an undergraduate, she and a friend wrote a pamphlet entitled The Justice of the Present War Examined. In this, Elizabeth Anscombe argued that while Britain was certainly fighting against an unjust cause, it was not fighting for a just one. For all its rigour and lucidity, the argument lacked any grasp of realpolitik. Subsequently, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham told the two students to withdraw the pamphlet because they had described it as Catholic without getting a Church licence.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1970, Elizabeth Anscombe taught at Somerville. Here her work ranged over the fields of logic, semantics and the theory of language. In Intention (1957), she analysed the meanings of intentional actions, with reference to their effects on concepts of ethics. The book gave rise to a branch of philosophy known as \"action theory\".\n\nHer essay Modern Moral Philosophy (1958) posited that Christianity derives its ethical notions from the Torah, but that the concept of what is morally right or wrong in a Christian society had come to be identified purely with what is legal or not. Therefore moral philosophers should dispense with the notion of moral obligation and concentrate, like Aristotle and Plato, on virtue.\n\nIn the same piece, she attacked the majority of academic philosophers for their lack of reference to the Hebrew-Christian ethic, and for their consequentialism - the view that the moral worth of an act lies only in its consequences.\n\nAristotle was a favourite subject of Elizabeth Anscombe's, and in 1961 she contributed to the volume Three Philosophers an essay on his importance to contemporary analytical philosophers. She was president of the Aristotelian Society in 1987-88. Her quirks made Elizabeth Anscombe a memorable tutor. Clad in leopardskin trousers and a leather jacket, she might sit in silence for minutes on end, puffing on a cigar, after one of her students had finished reading out an essay.\n\nShe also had a reputation for being brusque, especially to colleagues whom she found pretentious. She told A J Ayer: \"If you didn't talk so quickly, people wouldn't think you were so clever.\" \"If you didn't talk so slowly,\" countered Ayer, \"people wouldn't think you were so profound.\" She was, however, capable of great kindness to graduate students with a serious interest in philosophy.\n\nShe was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1967, and became Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge three years later. She also became a Fellow of New Hall. Her inaugural lecture dealt with aspects of causality and determination.\n\nHaving retired from her chair at Cambridge in 1986, a decade later she became the first Professor of Ethics at Liechtenstein University, where she delivered a lecture entitled Die Wahrheit Thun (To Do the Truth), a concept expressed in the First Epistle of John. Her recent work included an essay on murder and the morality of euthanasia.\n\nFor her work on Wittgenstein, the Austrian government awarded her the Ehrenkreuz Pro Litteris et Artibus in 1978. She married, in 1941, Peter Geach, latterly Professor of Logic at the University of Leeds. He survives her, together with their three sons and four daughters."
