        "text": "Conference Flyer | Conference Schedule | Reading Packet\n\nOn March 16, the Harvard Anscombe Society will host a Symposium on the Moral Philosophy of Elizabeth Anscombe, celebrating the occasion of the 100th anniversary of her birth.\n\nAnscombe was one of the greatest philosophers in the British analytic tradition who thought extensively about philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, and intention, as well as presenting modern arguments for virtue, chastity, and sexual ethics.\n\nParticipants of the 2019 Harvard Anscombe Symposium will receive reading on her primary works including Modern Moral Philosophy and Intention and come prepared to discuss these ideas with world-class faculty including:\n\nProf. James Doyle received his BA from Cambridge University and his PhD from the University of Virginia. He has been lecturer and then senior lecturer in philosophy at the University of Bristol (1998-2011) and long-term Visitor at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (2011-2015). He is interested in the history of philosophy, especially Plato, and in certain issues in the philosophy of action and mind. He is working on books on Plato’s Gorgias and the philosophy of Elizabeth Anscombe.\n\nFr. Jeffrey Langan, Ph.D., Ph.D. is a priest of the Prelature of Opus Dei, and presently serves in New York City. Before his ordination, he was Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of Liberal Studies at Holy Cross College at Notre Dame, prior to which he taught at the University of Notre Dame. Fr. Langan earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy from the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross, and prior to that he earned a Ph.D. in Government from the University of Notre Dame. He studied Classics at Columbia University, and History at Marquette University. His publications include: the translation with commentary of The French Revolution Confronts Pius VI: His Writings to Louis XVI, French Cardinals, Bishops, the National Assembly, and the People of France with Special Emphasis on the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (St. Augustine’s Press, 2013); The Influence of the French Revolution on the Lives and Thought of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Edmund Burke, Mary Wollestonecraft, Immanuel Kant, and Pius VI: The End of Conservatism (Edwin Mellen, 2012); From Animal House to the Academy(Xlibris 2008); co-edited Ethics without God? (St. Augustine’s Press 2008); as well as a number of articles in popular as well as scholarly venues like Acta Philosophica. He has delivered a number of papers internationally in Czech Republic, Greece, Estonia, Germany, Mexico, and Italy, at academic conferences including the Southern Political Science Association, American Political Science Association, Trialogos Conference, the Association for Political Theory, and the Conference of the Center for Ethics and Culture.\n\nProf. Candace Vogler is the David B. and Clara E. Stern Professor of Philosophy and Professor in the College at the University of Chicago, and Principal Investigator on “Virtue, Happiness, and the Meaning of Life,” a project funded by the John Templeton Foundation. She has authored two books, John Stuart Mill’s Deliberative Landscape: An Essay in Moral Psychology (Routledge, 2001) and Reasonably Vicious (Harvard University Press, 2002), and essays in ethics, social and political philosophy, philosophy and literature, cinema, psychoanalysis, gender studies, sexuality studies, and other areas. Her research interests are in practical philosophy (particularly the strand of work in moral philosophy indebted to Elizabeth Anscombe), practical reason, Kant’s ethics, Marx, and neo-Aristotelian naturalism.\n\nProf. Peter Wicks was educated at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and came to the United States as Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow at Princeton’s Graduate School before pursuing his doctoral studies at the University of Notre Dame, where he completed his Ph.D. in 2010. After spending a year on a postdoctoral fellowship at Princeton, Dr. Wicks taught in the Ethics Program at Villanova University as a Catherine of Siena Fellow before joining the Elm Institute, where he is scholar-in-residence. His main research interests are the contemporary applications of Aristotelian ethical and political thought and the intellectual foundations of utilitarianism. Dr. Wicks is currently completing a book, The Ethics of Peter Singer: A Study of Utilitarianism in Theory and Practice, which examines the sources of the appeal of utilitarianism in contemporary culture through a critical examination of the work of the contemporary philosopher Peter Singer.\n\nThe conference will consist of a full day of seminars on Saturday, ending with a closing dinner that night. Most participants will leave campus on Sunday.\n\nUndergraduate students from across the country interested in Elizabeth Anscombe are invited to apply. The conference will be free to attend and students will be housed with Harvard members of the Anscombe Society. Meals and housing are all covered, and limited travel reimbursements are also available.\n\nRegister Now\n\nWe’re sponsored by the generosity of the Love and Fidelity Network, the Abigail Adams Institute, and the Intercollegiate Studies Institute"
