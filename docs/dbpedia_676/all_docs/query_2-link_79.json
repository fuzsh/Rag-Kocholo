        "text": "What is the course about?\n\nThis course is an introduction to four outstanding women philosophers of the 20th century: Mary Midgley (1919-2018), Elizabeth Anscombe (1919-2001), Philippa Foot (1920-2010), and Iris Murdoch (1919-1999).\n\nWe will consider their lives in the context of philosophy, and discuss some of their most important philosophical works:\n\nElizabeth Anscombe: \"Intention\" (1957). This book, where Anscombe introduces the concept of intention, is considered one of her most significant contributions to philosophy.\n\nMary Midgley: \"Evolution as a Religion\" (1985). In this work, Midgley criticises the way evolution is sometimes treated as a kind of secular religion or worldview.\n\nPhilippa Foot: \"Natural Goodness\" (2001). Foot outlines her version of virtue ethics in this book, which becomes a central pillar in her philosophical thought.\n\nIris Murdoch: \"Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals\" (1992). Murdoch provides a broad and nuanced exploration of moral philosophy and the influence of metaphysical beliefs on moral thought in this work.\n\nWhat will we cover?\n\nWe will cover a range of central philosophical questions to which these four philosophers have made significant contributions as highlighted above.\n\nWhat will I achieve?\n\nBy the end of this course you should be able to...\n\nEngage in an informed discussion about the lives and philosophical work of these outstanding women philosophers and be in a position to continue more advanced study of their philosophy.\n\nWhat level is the course and do I need any particular skills?\n\nThis is an introductory course and does not require any prior study. An open mind and a willingness to listen to and think about views with which you do not always agree are more important than specific levels of skills.\n\nHow will I be taught, and will there be any work outside the class?\n\nThe course will be taught in person and no work outside the class is required.\n\nAre there any other costs? Is there anything I need to bring?\n\nNo; you may want to take notes for future reference. A list of recommended reading for further study will be provided at the end of the course.\n\nWhen I've finished, what course can I do next?"
