        "text": "Views: 838\n\nIf Spinoza was the God-intoxicated Philosopher then Leibniz was by comparison also divinely inspired by a divine understanding that provided us with a picture of the divine library of God containing our world book that, according to Leibniz, was the best book in the library. Kant may not have shared this sentiment because, as he claimed, we might be living in an age of Enlightenment but are not as yet living in Enlightened times. By this, he meant that whilst there were signs of progress it was uncertain as to whether we would reach the telos of Culture which he described in terms of a “Kingdom of Ends” lying one hundred thousand years in the future.\n\nBefore being awoken from his dogmatic rationalist slumbers by Hume and Rousseau, Kant was much influenced by Leibniz and Newton. He was also affected by the tension created by the demands of religious faith and the more sceptical natural scientists in an Enlightenment Prussia. These scientists were not impressed by the anti-clerical revolution of the French “philosophes”. Indeed, Rousseau, it could be argued, belonged essentially to the Counter-Enlightenment movement. The Counter Enlightenment was a historical movement, which, in the eyes of a Prussian society, drew inspiration from the Pietist protest against Protestantism. Kant’s contemporaries, Hamann, Herder, and Jacobi all aligned themselves with the Counter-Enlightenment and thus against the spirit of the rationalist component of Kant’s Critical Philosophy: a Philosophy that attempted to integrate Natural Science, Religious Faith, Ethics, Politics, Philosophical Psychology, and Aesthetics. Even in his earlier work, Kant was convinced that the Leibniz-Newton conflict could be averted, by distinguishing between different principles and different spheres of the application of these principles. As his work progressed and matured, however, there was a decisive shift away from the more theoretical metaphysical commitments of Leibniz and a shift towards a critical approach.This Critical approach took as its data, categories of judgments and experience, in the context of a tripartite structure of a mind constituted by Sensibility, Understanding, and Reason. This approach was also committed to a logical method that used the principles of identity, non-contradiction, and sufficient reason.\n\nSpheres of application for principles also evolved eventually into a belief that metaphysics and transcendental philosophy were important in both theoretical and practical arenas of activity. Critical Philosophy, however, distanced itself from theoretical proofs of the existence of God but embraced a practical argument that used the practical reasoning of ethics as a basis or reason for believing in God’s existence. In Kant’s mature work we encounter a philosophical theory worthy of the Aristotelian and Enlightenment idea of integrating as many intellectual realms of activity into a whole as possible. Kant is known for a number of theoretical innovations as well as an admiration for the a priori elements of Newtonian Physics and Euclidean Geometry, but we should not forget the inscription on his grave that refers to both the starry heavens above and the moral law within. We should not forget, that is, his contribution to metaphysically grounded ethics. Both of these aspects of human existence produced in him experiences of awe and admiration, but his accomplishment was to theoretically show how it was possible to believe in the physical laws of nature and the moral laws of ethics that embraced both the ideas of Freedom and God.\n\nIf anyone deserved the title “The Newton of the Moral Universe” it was Kant. He refused to diminish the importance of the status of Natural Science (as the theories of Berkeley and Leibniz appeared to demand). He also refused to embrace the scepticism of Hume who questioned not just the relevance of metaphysics but also that of Philosophy in general. Many commentators claim it was the battle with the giant of scepticism that produced a philosophical theory which divided our discourse up into empirical, transcendental, and metaphysical propositions–thus restoring the status of much of science and most of Philosophy. This division enabled Kant to insist that Laws need not necessarily be derived from observation of the world, but they were nevertheless necessarily applicable to that world. In this context, Kant invokes a vital distinction between the world as it presents itself to beings possessed of the powers of Sensibility, Understanding, and Reason, and a world in itself, which may have a form beyond our comprehension, and about which we can know and say nothing. According to Kant, the closest we come to understanding this so-called “noumenal world”, is via a holistic understanding of ourselves as beings that freely follow the moral law within.\n\nUnderstanding this aspect of our self requires some kind of understanding of transcendental philosophy and its metaphysical assumptions. Part of this understanding will involve an awareness that the world of appearances is riddled with a contingency which is connected to the kind of sensory apparatus we possess: a sensory apparatus that for example synthesises light rays into objects of visual perception but is unable to synthesise x-ray waves (or any other kind of wave about which we have no knowledge). This transcendental philosophy will also involve awareness that the powers of perception we do possess are a condition of what can be done with our powers of understanding and reason.Kant, in his later hylomorphic phase, believed in both the matter and the form of experience. Form, he argued, was investigated by the metaphysics of scientific and moral laws. Two a priori forms of sensibility were, for example, Space and Time. Kant argued that these forms were not a consequence of experience, but rather forms of sensibility that are used to help organise what we experience, or, in other words, space and time were what he referred to as a priori conditions of our experience. These conditions were for him modes of experience and in this claim Kant disagreed with the Newtonian ideas of absolute Space and Time in themselves, which, according to Newton, existed independently of any experience of them. Kant’s reasoning in relation to this point was that we could neither imagine nor think of the “form” of the in-itself, because our thought and imagination are formed partly by a human configuration of sensory powers that created the “forms” of Space and Time. This in turn created the “form” of our experience. Kant is here in this discussion drawing the limits of our understanding and reasoning and any metaphysics that fails to register these limits are merely, in his opinion, the dreams of spirit seers.\n\nIn response to the question of what we can know about the nature of the above forms of Space and Time, Kant responds by claiming that geometry reveals to us the a priori form of Space, and Arithmetic reveals to us the a priori form of Time. Mathematics, then helps us to investigate these modes of our experience. There is also, in the work of Kant, reference to those forms of thought, understanding, and reason that have both transcendental and metaphysical aspects. The Newtonian law of conservation of matter and energy, which states that matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed, is an example of a metaphysical assumption, whilst “every event must have a cause”, is an example of a transcendental assumption about the form our understanding must take if we are to make justified true claims about the physical world, The law claiming that energy and matter cannot be created or destroyed, of course, immediately places a question mark over the traditional religious idea of a God that has created the universe. Such an idea of a creative God is, for Kant, an idea of a spirit seer as is the idea of a soul that can disengage from a physical body in accordance with “spiritual” laws. In spite of this, Kant believed both in God and souls insofar as both are embedded in our ethical relations to each other, and the world as a whole. For him, it is a matter of transcendental fact that we human beings possess moral convictions that emanate from a moral power that is expressed in a system of concepts we use for forming our moral intentions and our moral judgments, (concepts such as good, bad, right, wrong, ought, etc.). These concepts form the conditions for our moral discourse and the moral assumptions we make when we “judge” that someone could have acted differently to the way in which they did in fact act. Without such conditions, Kant argues, all moral and legal evaluation of our actions are impossible. Such evaluation also assumes a free will, or freedom to choose. This discourse, Kant points out is not similar to our scientific discourse about the phenomenal world we all observe and move in. Moral discourse runs deeper, Kant argues: it is about the noumenal world, and because of this state of affairs, we distinguish fundamentally between the status of the philosophical questions “What can we know?” and “What ought we to do?” With respect to this latter question, we are thrown immediately into the realm of metaphysics and when we further seek to justify our moral evaluations in terms of a just and good God we move into the realm of faith and the third philosophical question, “What can we hope for?” All three questions require the regulation of Reason and its Principles of identity, non-contradiction, and sufficient reason. The principle of non-contradiction, Kant argues is, in fact, two principles, one of which relates to things that are, and the other relates to things that are not, and these principles probably follow from the principles of identity and sufficient reason.\n\nThe moral law within us is regulated by an imperative form because we are dealing with the fundamental moral question of “What ought we to do?”It, like all forms of discourse, is formulated in terms of the principles of identity, non-contradiction, and sufficient reason. The moral law claims that we should only act on that maxim of action that we can will to become a universal law of nature. This claim means that such a law is universally agreed, adopted, and ought to be acted upon by everyone. The logical implication here is that if one possesses and understands the concepts, and has used them in the formulation of an intention to do the right thing, the good thing, or the thing one ought to do, a fitting moral action must follow as a matter of rationality. This, of course, is a process and, as such, much can go wrong, but even if it does, it will remain forever true that the action conceived of, is the one that ought to have been done. This, of course, assumes that after having made a promise, one’s commitment to treating oneself and others as ends in themselves demands that I do everything in my power to keep my promise.Doing anything else will fail to honour what Kant calls the “dignity of man”\n\nManfred Keuhn, in his work “Kant: A Biography”(1), charted the history of the Categorical Imperative from what he called Kant’s “Socratic Turn”. In this history Rousseau convinced the great philosopher that “natural man” possessed a moral sensibility that was a part of everyone’s nature. This aspect of our nature,Rousseau argued, was clouded by the customary habits and norms we form when we gather together in groups. Kant gradually, however, began to feel that this postulated hidden nature of man was not described entirely correctly by Rousseau, and he turned instead to English thinkers such as Hutcheson and Reid to characterise what he would later call the “unsocial sociability” of man. This property of man manifested itself in particular in his antagonism toward his fellows when his own self-love overrides his own innate benevolent sensibility. Hutcheson, for example, embraced a variation of the Pleasure-Pain Principle that was not instrumentally oriented or utilitarian. He also pointed out that benevolence could be associated with pain for the morally inclined individual. It is clear for Hutcheson that moral worth (a key concept in Kant’s ethics) was to be measured in terms of the benevolence directed at others. A variation of the Reality Principle is also involved in Hutcheson’s account in the form of an insistence on our ability to adopt the perspective of a spectator with respect to our own actions, evaluating them, as it was maintained, disinterestedly. Our moral affections, it is claimed, can be reflected upon. These moral affections are “determinations of our nature”, according to Hutcheson, but he also somewhat paradoxically conceptualises them as “obligations”, and it becomes unclear whether he means to use the term to name an affective-motivational force or rather something closer to Kant’s idea of a rational norm governing our action.\n\nGiven the fact that Hutcheson was particularly critical of rationalism, the likelihood is that he was referring to a naturally motivating force and distinguished it from other motivational forces such as anger , perhaps because this latter motive lacked, in his estimation, an articulate intention. Like many sentimentalists of this time, Hutcheson rested his case on happiness, a principle that Kant critically regarded as the principle of self-love in disguise. Hutcheson believed that we are benevolent towards others because we realise that our own happiness rests on their happiness. Freud’s reality principle was differently constituted, resting rather, not upon happiness, but on the Kantian notion of the dignity of man which was achieved against the background of conflict and experienced suffering.\n\nKant, in this early phase of his development was beginning to manifest an eclectic tendency that would later develop into the theoretical cosmopolitanism of his later critical philosophy where Ancient Greek, German, English, Swiss, French and Dutch influences were firmly integrated into one philosophical outlook. In this later phase Kant abandons the idea of moral sensibility as the motivating force of action, in favour of a more reflective position that focuses on the maxim of an action, arrived at rationally, and with understanding. In his work “Anthropology from a Pragmatic point of view”(2) Kant writes:\n\n“What is decisive in practical matters is not whether we have done a good action at one time (or another), but rather it is the maxim.”\n\nOur moral worth, that is, is directly connected to the rational worth of the maxim, i.e. its universality and necessity. So we see here that there is a sense in which Rousseau’s “natural man” was supplanted by a man that is obligated to create his own character by rational reflection upon his maxims: a rational, non-observational form of reflection that involved universality and necessity. It is worth noting that, at this late stagein his work, Kant would not have subscribed to any view that claimed morality to be rooted in sympathy: an emotion which he regarded as “blind”, meaning without conceptual or cognitive import. Insofar as there is a general “emotion” required by moral judgment and moral action, it must be generally applicable to all of humanity and whatever we call that feeling it must be related to a work of the imagination that is in principle related to concepts (as is the case with aesthetic judgment). In such judgments, what is particular is subsumable under what is general, and in the moral case these judgments are maxims, or “reasons for acting”. Ethical reasons will not meet the criteria for a narcissistically formed self-love, but rather will demand a criterion of self-worth related to the more neutral attitude of respect and the logical requirements of universality and necessity.\n\nIn this later phase of development, Kant was returning to a thesis of the Ancients, in particular returning to Aristotle’s hylomorphic theory, in which all understanding was the understanding of forms or principles that organised matter in successive actualisation phases. The initial phase, insofar as moral judgment is concerned, related to something that was to be the case, or something that needed to be done rather than something that was, or was to be felt. Moral Philosophy, at this point for Kant, was a philosophy of the noumenal world, of the mundus intelligibilis. No motiva sensualis was involved in the consideration of “reasons for action”– and as with the ancients, all morality is based on ideas and principles. The metaphysics of morals would then constitute the knowledge we have of ourselves and would provide the rational justification or groundwork for a virtuous character or will.\n\nIn conclusion, as we approach Kant’s more mature work written late in his life, beginning with the “Critique of Pure Reason”, at age 57, we encounter the strategies of Plato and Aristotle being put to the use of integrating the cognitive faculties or powers of the mind into one systematic whole. Sensibility, Understanding, and Reason all possessed their “forms” or “principles”, that together contributed to shaping the overall power of the mind Kant had been seeking to correctly describe and explain during his long philosophical career. The first Critique took 12 years to complete, and was a testament to the difficulty of the task set by David Hume: the task, namely of steering an Aristotelian middle course between the rocks of dogmatism and the sandbanks of Scepticism This task involved the construction of a power of understanding and judgment to mediate between the powers of sensation and reason. It also required charting a course between the methods of “observation” and “logic”. The strategy was clearly Aristotelian, but the result was something new and unique, something purely Kantian, and worthy of that period of History we call “The Enlightenment”, when men for the second time in philosophical history dared to use their reason.\n\nThe reference Kant makes to “pure reason” is a concession to the skepticism of Hume, but at the same time, it is an insistence that, in spite of the steadily mounting empirical attacks on rationalism in the name of a “book of nature” view of science, rationalism in the spirit of Aristotle was alive and well and capable of supporting not just the science of nature but the entire canon of Aristotelian theoretical, practical and productive sciences. Freud sometimes is construed as being anti-rational by some of his critics, but some of his critics also accuse him of being unscientific and perhaps the key to opening the casket of Freud’s underlying position is to see how neither of these criticisms are valid. Freud is both a rationalist in the sprit of Aristotelian hylomorphism and a scientist in the spirit of Kant. His focus is essentially on the practical matter of living ones life well, and the medical matter of therapeutic interventions for the good health of the soul.\n\nFor Kant the journey of the soul was a matter of the journey on the road to Damascus (Via Dolarosa). The principles involved included the principle of noncontradiction and sufficient reason, and the progress along this road depended upon the goods related to the body, goods related to the external world, and lastly, and most significantly, goods relating to the soul. We need to bear in mind also, Spinoza’s claim that the first idea of the mind is the idea of the body, as well as the Freudian claim that the primary function of the ego is to protect the body. The relation of the body to one aspect of the external world, i.e. sexual partners, argues forcefully for the Freudian focus upon sexuality, in the stages of the development of the personality: Freud’s “stages” on life’s way include abandoning earlier archaic practices in favour of new institutional practices that have more realistic aims and objectives. This process of abandonment is a painful affair, and is attended with the risk of interference from various defence mechanisms such as repression, denial, displacement, splitting, etc which tend to weaken the ego and its attempt to view the world stoically through the lens of Ananke. Such a developmental account must of course presuppose a commitment to hylomorphism and its actualisation processes. These processes determine the way in which the human form of life interacts with the world in terms of its “possibilities”, transforming not just the objects of the instincts, but also the aims of the instincts, widening the horizon for the battle of the giants, Eros and Thanatos.\n\nConsciousness, we know is a vicissitude of the instincts and we know that for both Aristotle and Freud the dream was a kind of thinking in which the body is derealised by the play of images on the dream screen. This may mean that the first idea of the body in the soul may well be an image/hallucination that has its source in the external world. Such images are, of course, not, in a certain sense ” real”, and this may be tied up with the fact that during sleep, both the motor and the sensory systems of the body are immobilised and the body seeks a displaced form of instant substitute gratification in the dream. Freud does, however, call such an image hallucinatory, and, as such, it is both a primary process activity, and an illusory regressive activity. Dream activity may well be the zero-level of thought-activity–an almost pure psychic phenomenon blossoming or “occurring” in a psychic locality. The location may well be an important consideration when it comes to determining whether it makes any sense to speak of “events” and their physical(material/efficient) causality. Freud took a clear and distinct stand on this issue by designating the dream as a wish-fulfilment, and this must be true in at least one sense, that of ensuring the individual concerned continues to sleep instead of waking prematurely. This wish to continue sleeping is certainly not at the level of consciousness, but for Aristotle it is a type of thinking that carries on during dream activity.\n\nFor Kant and his trinity of mental faculties, sensibility, understanding and reason, the dream is an activity of sensibility, which Kant regards as an unconscious form of poetry, involving the imagination in a condition in which the body-image is inactive and as a consequence the dream is not structured in terms of the continuous space-time of waking experience. The imagination may, however, be activated by unconscious concepts( whose source is in the understanding), so the scenes we experience are to some extent organised and not the mere wild play of random images. To the extent that the images we experience may never have occurred in previous experience as they are presented, is the extent to which we are in the realm of illusion and fantasy. The people we dream of, for example, could not possibly have memories of their role in our dreams. If one is hungry in one’s dream, one does not know it to be true that one is hungry, and to that extent our dreams lack veracity. It may be the case, however, that one was hungry when one went to bed and this is obviously the source of the dream of eating roast beef.\n\nReason has no obvious role in this function of sensibility in which the concept regresses back to its image-origin, instead of occupying the subject or predicate position in an assertion This may be because reason appears to operate at the level of thinking something about something, which is a more complex level than that of merely thinking something– which is the domain of conceptual thinking occupying the subject position of an assertion. The sensible functions involved in dreaming are regulated by the primary process of thought and the pleasure-pain principle. Reason is, then, a secondary process operation.\n\nModern Post analytical philosophy championed by Russell and Frege used a mathematical form of logic to solve the aporetic questions that arose in a context which the early Wittgenstein defined. For Wittgenstein and the other mathematical logicians the world was defined as “The totality of facts”, and it was clear that natural science regulated by mathematical thinking was the focus of many different associated movements such as logical positivism. Frege and Russell attempted, unsuccessfully and in their different ways, contra Kant, to reduce mathematics to logic. For Kant, Mathematics was attempting to quantify space and time and used constructed concepts in its operations.\n\nReason, for Kant, is the search for the totality of conditions of cognitive Judgments, something that could never be achieved for synthetic judgments, (judgments of experience or mathematical judgments). Insofar as experience is concerned, Kant has the following to say in his Prolegomena (P.92):(3)\n\n“For experience never satisfies reason fully, but in answering questions, refers us further and further back and leaves us dissatisfied with regard to their complete solution.” And further (P. 96)(4):\n\n“The sensible world is nothing but a chain of appearances connected according to universal laws: it has, therefore, no subsistence by itself: it is not the thing in itself, and consequently must point to that which cannot be cognised merely as appearances but as things in themselves. In the cognition of them alone can reason hope to satisfy its desire for completeness in proceeding from the conditioned to its conditions.”\n\nThe search for the totality of conditions referred to above, however, is predicated upon the inquirer possessing three fundamental powers of mind, namely, Sensibility, Understanding, and Reason. Reason has an important relation to the formation of a totality of forms of categorical judgments, i.e. the categories of the understanding:\n\n“But Pure Reason is a sphere so separate and self-contained that we cannot touch a part without affecting all the rest. We can, therefore, do nothing without first determining the positions of each part and its relation to the rest. For inasmuch as our judgment cannot be corrected by anything outside of pure reason, so the validity and use of every part depends upon the relation in which it stands to all the rest within the domain of reason, just as in the structure of an organised body the end of each member can only be deduced from the full conception of the whole.” (P.8)(5)\n\nPhilosophical knowledge, then, Kant continues, considers the quality of particular existence insofar as it participates in the universal in contrast to mathematical knowledge that “constructs” the universal in the particular in accordance with quantitative considerations. Mathematics constructs definitions from mathematical elements: a straight line, for example, is defined in terms of two points and the relation between them (the shortest distance). The mathematician then proceeds immediately to drawing a particular straight line in illustration of the principle (with the aid of an instrument: a ruler). The straight line can then be used in the construction of figures such as triangles. Straight lines of particular lengths are used to construct a particular triangle with a particular area that can be measured. It is as a consequence true, that triangular spaces have a different quality to circular spaces but it must be recognised that this difference in quality is constructed in a way that the quality of the redness of rose can never be.\n\nIt is also true that were we to be endowed with the sensible apparatus capable of giving us x-ray access to the inside of objects like roses, we may never have been aware of the quality of colour. This fact, however, is not a sufficient basis from which to argue that the qualities of colours such as the redness of a rose are “constructed” upon the foundation of a mathematical primary underlying reality of a certain quantity (of, for example, Angstrom units). Kant insists that mathematical construction is not a more reliable system of representation of the noumenal reality we know so little about (we can, however, according to Kant know that noumena are not mathematical, not spatial, not temporal). For Kant, the mathematician works in the world of the particular as organised by his mathematical notations. Kant also points out that, given the fact that the philosopher is working solely in the arena of concepts and judgments, he has not the means of advancing our knowledge of the definition of a straight line except by categorising the form of the judgment involved in characterising the possible mathematical activity, e.g. The definition of a straight line as the shortest distance between two points is characterised by Kant as a “synthetic a priori judgment”.\n\nIt is metaphysical and transcendental logic that allows the philosopher to theorise about the way in which we relate to the continuum of noumenal reality (by dividing it up with our philosophical concepts and judgments). This system of dividing reality up is very different from the mathematical method of division that fundamentally relies on quantitatively constructed concepts and a pure intuition that relates immediately to reality via the faculty of Sensibility. The constructed concept here functions rather like a schema of subsumption that allows a limited number of mathematical operations and calculations to occur.\n\nThe mathematical “logic” we encounter here is not at the same level as the relation of universal concepts we encounter in the transcendental or metaphysical logic that the philosopher uses in the analysis of the structure of a judgment in which we say something about something. Kant points out in this context that:\n\n“It would, therefore, be quite futile for me to philosophise upon the triangle, that is, to think about it discursively. I should not be able to advance a single step beyond the mere definition, which was what I had to begin with. There is indeed a transcendental synthesis (framed) from concepts alone, a synthesis with which the philosopher is alone competent to deal: but it relates only to a thing in general, as defining the conditions under which the perception of it can belong to possible experience. But in mathematical problems, there is no question of this, nor indeed of existence at all, but only of the properties of the objects in themselves (that is to say), solely insofar as the properties are connected with the concept of the objects.”(Critique of Pure Reason A 718-9)(6)\n\nInvolved in this claim is Kant’s subsequent denial that the philosophical and mathematical methods overlap or have elements in common. The philosopher,Kant argues, cannot work with constructed definitions, axioms, and related demonstrations. In this context, Kant also points out that definitions of empirical concepts such as gold and water (where the extension of these concepts are not exactly circumscribed and forever open to modification by further empirical investigation) are problematic. Mathematical concepts, on the other hand, are circumscribable and refer to an object via the constructed definition.\n\nKant points out that Mathematicians are in agreement and disputes about their concepts do not occur. But there are disputes over whether, for example, a particular system of concepts such as Euclidean geometry is consistent with the system of concepts we find in non-Euclidean Geometry. When they do not agree, however, it does not appear to be a tribunal of mathematical reason that can settle the issue as to which system, for example, best represents reality. Both systems are constructed and in the eyes of the philosopher, it might appear as if both systems are equally legitimate methods of dividing up the continuum of noumenal reality. Indeed the discovery that both systems have been “constructed” could only have been discovered in the tribunal of philosophical reasoning where matters such as this are settled. One could imagine, for example, evidence being submitted by Einstein (that space is “curved”) as part of the case for the legitimation of non-Euclidean geometry. For the Philosopher, however, this is a metaphysical judgment even if it is supported by a theory of gravitation where it is claimed that gravitational force “bends” Space and bends the light that otherwise travels in straight lines that are best measured by the Euclidean system of geometry. One of the verdicts of the tribunal of philosophical reason, in this case, might be that it is only the Space around objects exerting a large enough gravitational force, that requires the concepts and operations of non-Euclidean geometry. This, however, in the end, fails to justify the use of the universal concept of “Space” in the judgment “Space is curved”. The Newtonian universe is certainly modified by Einstein’s theories, but light still travels in straight lines unless caused to do otherwise by powerful gravitational fields: the Newtonian laws of motion thus stand and survive the case for the prosecution in the Philosophical tribunal of Reason. The tribunal of philosophical reasoning, however, is more at home with defending its concepts and laws against general philosophical positions such as dogmatism and scepticism: it is, that is, more at home when handing down judgments on the importance of the idea of Freedom in a rational human life led in a rational society:\n\n“Thus freedom will carry with it the right to submit openly for discussion the thoughts and doubts with which we find ourselves unable to deal and to do so without being decried as troublesome and dangerous citizens. This is one of the original rights of human reason which recognises no other judge than that universal human reason in which everyone has his say. And since all improvement on which our state is capable must be obtained from this source, such a right is sacred and must not be curtailed.”(A752)(7)\n\nKant is referring here, amongst other things, to the importance of the logical form of practical reason as distinguished from its empirical form that we encounter in our practical prudential judgments and actions where:\n\n“…the whole business of reason consists in uniting all the ends which are prescribed to us by our desires in the one single end, happiness, and in coordinating the means for attaining it. In this field therefore reason can supply none but pragmatic laws of free action, for the attainment of those ends which are commended to us by the senses: it cannot yield us laws that are pure and determined completely a priori and which are prescribed to us, not in an empirically conditioned but in an absolute manner would be products of pure reason. Such are the moral laws, and these alone, therefore, belong to the practical employment of reason and allow of a canon.” (A 800)(8)\n\n“The Canon of Pure Reason” is the title of an important section of the First Critique: a section that provides us with the metaphysics and transcendental philosophy which in turn enable us to answer the question “What ought I to do?”\n\n(In the light of the theoretical knowledge we have of God, the immortality of the soul and our freedom). In this connection Kant also provides us with the beginnings of a Philosophical Psychology needed to further his critical projects:\n\n“A will which can be determined independently of sensuous impulses and therefore through motives which are represented only by reason is entitled free will and everything that is bound up with this will, whether as ground or as consequence is entitled practical….. we have the power to overcome the impressions of our faculty of sensuous desire, by calling up representations of what, in a more indirect manner is useful or injurious. But these considerations as to what is desirable in respect of our whole state, that is, as to what is good and useful are based on reason. Reason, therefore provides laws which are imperative, that is, objective laws of freedom which tell us what ought to happen although perhaps it never does happen–therein differing from the laws of nature which relate only to that which happens.”(A802)(9)\n\nWith the above transcendental justification and reference to the will, (the central concept of Philosophical psychology-of the kind we encounter in Freud’s Metapsychology), the First Critique delimits and defines the scope and boundaries of the ought-system of concepts that will provide the framework for Kant’s Moral, Religious, and Political Philosophy. Pure Reason, for Kant, can be both theoretical and practical, but morality is a priori practical and only connected to the concept of happiness via the condition that we are ultimately worthy of such happiness. Kant calls the world in which rational agents and judges live, a moral world, a kingdom of ends, in which each member of the kingdom treats other members as ends-in-themselves. Such members will enjoy happiness thanks to a divine guarantee by an intelligent God that distributes happiness to those worthy of it. This, then, provides the answer to the question Kant poses “What can we hope for?” The kingdom of ends hypothesised by Kant is a systematic unity of ends (or totality of conditions) that is also in accordance with universal laws of nature.\n\nKant discusses the concept of Truth and claims (paradoxically, according to some commentators), that there are three degrees of holding something to be true: opining, believing and knowing:\n\n“Opining is such holding of a judgment as is consciously insufficient, not only objectively, but also subjectively. If our holding of the judgment be only subjectively sufficient, we have what is termed believing. Lastly, when the holding of a thing to be true is sufficient both subjectively and objectively, it is knowledge”(A822)(10)\n\nOpinion is, “merely a play of the imagination without the least relation to truth”. When we venture upon a moral action, on the other hand, Kant argues, we must know its validity (its universality and necessity). In relation to the more speculative theoretical issues of whether there is a God, or another life in another world, there is only moral certainty resting upon a moral attitude (given the fact that God belongs to the noumenal world we know so little about and that his existence can neither be proved nor disproved). Knowledge appears also to divide into fields or disciplines, and these can be assembled arbitrarily, rhapsodically or architectonically (in accordance with the demands of pure practical reason).\n\nThere is, however, in Kant’s overall strategy an awareness of the presence of the ancients who, beginning with Socrates, favoured pure practical reason over theoretical reasoning. Here Kant probably has in mind the philosophical career of Socrates who upon reading Anaxagoras and realising “All is mind”, then turned his back on all forms of physical investigations in favour of the pursuit of the knowledge of the Good that we find portrayed as the foundation stone of the education of the Philosophers of Plato’s Republic. Kant is also familiar with the metaphysical system of Aristotle in which the theoretical and the practical dwell comfortably together in one system of Philosophy. Kant’s contribution to this debate is to identify two realms of metaphysics and two kinds of objects:\n\n“The legislation of human reason (philosophy) has two objects, nature, and freedom, and therefore contains not only the law of nature but also the moral law, presenting them at first in two distinct systems but ultimately in one philosophical system. The philosophy of nature deals with all that is, the philosophy of morals with that which ought to be”(A840)(11)\n\nThis gives rise to the “division” between the Metaphysics of Nature and the Metaphysics of Morals. The former contains the principles that ground our theoretical knowledge of the world, and the latter, the a priori principles that govern our actions. Kant warns about the confusion of these two modes of knowledge and also claims that these modes can be combined. He also warns us about confusing what is in our cognitive power with what is not, namely the confusion of the a posteriori and the a priori. it is, in Kant’s view, only the a priori forms of knowledge that can form the elements of pure science. In this debate, Kant refers to those sciences that proceed from concepts to intuitions and he also refers to Mathematics that proceeds from the construction of concepts to a priori intuitions.\n\nJames Ellington in his essay “The Unity of Kant’s Philosophy of Nature”(12) claims that Kant was not entirely clear about the workings of his architectonics. There is, however, no doubt concerning his clarity over the two modes of knowledge and what has been called Metaphysica Generalis, in which only principles and systems of concepts are discussed, and the system of Metaphysica Specialis in which rational physiology, rational cosmology, and rational theology are component disciplines. Rational physiology is further divided into two parts: physica rationalis and psychological rationalis. The term “rational” in these contexts refers to a priori elements, which means that empirical psychology will find no place in this structure, but given that it is applied philosophy, it will figure as a part of the metaphysical system in which we find explanations of psychological phenomena.\n\nIn the last chapter 4 of “The Transcendental Doctrine of Method” entitled “The History of Pure Reason” Kant notes that in the infancy of Philosophy men began by reflecting upon that point at which most mature philosophers would like to end their reflections, namely with the idea of God and another better life in a better world and:\n\n“That there could be no better ground or dependable way of pleasing the invisible power that governs the world, and so of being happy in another world at least, then by living the good life. Accordingly, theology and morals were the two motives or rather the two points of reference in all those abstract enquiries of reason to which men come to devote themselves. It was chiefly, however, the former that step by step committed the purely speculative reason to those labours which afterwards became so renowned under the name of metaphysics.”(A 852)13\n\nThis magnifies the importance of the so-called “Socratic turn” away from investigating the metaphysics of nature toward investigating the metaphysics of morals. It also testifies to the greatness of the tradition of Aristotelian Philosophy that pursued both forms of metaphysics to their fundamental grounds. Kantian philosophy continued this tradition but gives Aristotelian metaphysics a “Kantian turn” by pleading for the primacy of practical metaphysics over theoretical metaphysics, at least insofar as we finite rational beings capable of discourse are concerned. Kant, like Aristotle, recognises an animal element of sensibility but follows the ancients in insisting that the fundamental purpose of rationality is to largely regulate the domain of the powers of psuche.\n\nIn this “History” chapter Kant divides the object of “all our knowledge through Reason” into two; sensualism and intellectualism. The former is illustrated with the thought of Epicurus who maintains that:\n\n“reality is to be found solely in the objects of the senses” and all else is fiction. The\n\nintellectual school, on the other hand, declared that in the senses there is nothing but illusion, and that only the understanding knows what is true. The former position did not indeed deny reality to the concepts of the understanding, but this reality for them was “merely” logical whereas for others it was mystical. The former sensualists admitted intellectual concepts but admitted the reality of sensible objects only. Sensualists required that true objects should be purely intelligible and maintained that it is by means of the pure understanding that we experience intuitions unaccompanied by the senses– the senses in their view serving only to confuse the understanding”(A853).(14)\n\nKant also refers to the origin of the modes of knowledge through pure reason and mentions in this connection Aristotle’s “Empiricist” position in which it is maintained that all modes of knowledge are derived from experience. Plato, in this discussion, is referred to as a noologist (part of the mystical school). In Kant’s view, neither of these schools managed to correctly chart the boundaries or the limits of experience. Calling Aristotle an empiricist is, however, problematic given his remarks on the importance of the desire to understand and the role of principles in all processes of understanding. It is not absolutely clear that the intellectual forms of the mind are all tied as tightly to experience as Kant appears to imagine.\n\nIn the course of discussing the naturalistic (common sense) method, and the scientific method, Kant claims that common sense is sceptical about the use of mathematical and scientific instruments, and yet presumes to be able to establish the existence of sublime metaphysical truths with its limited means. Kant, then, concludes the First Critique by claiming that the scientific method per se can be either dogmatically used, as it was by Wolff, or sceptically used, as it was by Hume, but that the only viable Parmenidean road to the truth lies via the critical use of the scientific method.\n\nThe concept of the will is a concept of philosophical psychology which we do not find discussed in any detail in the writings of Freud. Kantian Philosophy, reasoning about the good will during the period of Enlightenment, was experiencing a brief respite in the surge of modernism introduced by Descartes and Hobbes: a period in which politics and economics had not yet managed to permeate the consciousness of the general public.\n\nBy the time we get to the period of Freud’s Austria, political parties and nation states were being dissolved and destabilised (according to Arendt in “Origins of Totalitarianism)(15), and the masses were being mobilised by populistic rhetoric into thinking, alternatively ,that “everything was possible”, or “nothing was possible”. The so-called “new men” that emerged in Europe, the US, and the Soviet Union were, consciously or unconsciously, marshalling various globalisation forces for various purposes. It is difficult to know exactly what Freud thought about these political, economic and military projects, but we do know that he experienced first hand the rise of Hitler and in his work, “Civilisation and its Discontents(1929)” wrote disparagingly about both the USA and the Soviet Union. Freud further posed the question as to whether all the energy we expend upon building up our civilisations, was worth the effort. Given the year of this work, this judgement perhaps can be justified, especially when we consider the Freudian use of the Platonic concepts of the life and death instincts, Eros and Thanatos, battling for the fate of civilisation.\n\nPlato’s Republic was a theoretical construction partly responding to Oracular prophecies relating to knowledge of oneself, and partly relating to the role this lack of knowledge may play in the fate of our civilisations. The Republic also, was partly a response to the perceived injustices inflicted upon the governed by governments that failed to understand the importance of the concepts of justice(diké) and virtue(areté). Socrates is the leader of the philosophical dialogue which is essentially searching for the elusive combination of the good-in-itself and the good-in-its-consequences, and the focus here is primarily political, forewarning us of the dangers of tyrants whose lust after power resembles a mental illness. There is very little trace of this kind of reflection in Freud’s writings. There is, however, one article entitled “Group Psychology and the analysis of the Ego” which begins with an admission that individual and social psychology are inseparable elements. This has an Aristotelian ring to it, which is highlighted in the hylomorphic essence-specifying definition of the human form of life, namely the rational animal capable of discourse. The implication of this definition is that man is essentially a social animal and given the Aristotelian claim that every human art, scientific inquiry, action and pursuit aims at the good, the form of the Good thus becomes the major social issue in which the question of whether man is the best or worst of animals is resolved. Freud, we know, grounded his psychoanalytical psychology on the foundation of instincts. Yet in the introduction to the above work, Freud specifically denies that there is a primitive social or herd instinct, and claims that membership or participation in different kinds of group give rise to different mental phenomena. The “group” par excellence for Freud, however, is that of the family, and this too echoes the Aristotelian position. For Aristotle the criterion for moving beyond the social group of the family into the village work-place is that of “self-sufficiency”. The next most important social grouping, next to the family, is that of the village which also has its limitations insofar as fulfilling our potential for being the best of animals is concerned. A purpose which, for Aristotle, involves striving to fulfil the potential of becoming the rational animal. It is, however, the polis which is of sufficient size and structure to meet the demands of its inhabitants for overall self-sufficiency. The full essence-specifying definition of the human form of life is “rational animal capable of discourse” and it is discourse rather than rationality that Freud focuses his attention upon. Discourse manifests itself in one-on-one therapy in the form of the “talking cure”, but it also manifests itself in social groups. Freud, in a Chapter entitled “Le Bon’s description of the group mind” begins as follows:\n\n“If a psychology, concerned with exploring the predispositions, the instinctual impulses, the motives and the aims of an individual man, down to his actions and his relations with those who are nearest to him, had completely achieved its task, and had cleared up the whole of these matters with their interconnections, it would then suddenly find itself confronted by a new task which would lie before it unachieved. It would be obliged to explain the surprising fact that under a certain condition this individual whom it had come to understand, thought felt and acted in quite a different way from what would have been expected. And this condition is his insertion into a collection of people which has acquired the characteristic of a “psychological group”. What, then, is a group? How does it acquire the capacity for exercising such a decisive influence over the mental life of the individual? And what is the nature of the mental change which it forces upon the individual? It is the task of theoretical group psychology to answer these three questions.” The Penguin Freud Library: Vol 12, London, Penguin, 1991) P.98)(16)\n\nFreud quotes Le Bon’s thesis that there are certain mental phenomena that can only be encountered in groups and this justifies attributing the description “collective mind” to these original characteristics. Le Bon uses an Aristotelian biological analogy:\n\n“The psychological group is a provisional being formed of heterogeneous elements, which for a moment are combined, exactly as the cells which constitute a living body form by their reunion a new being which displays characteristics very different from those possessed by each of the cells singly.” (Trans, 1920, 29)\n\nFreud elaborates upon this theme by claiming that there must be something responsible for the unification process and result, but he speaks of a “bond” rather than a principle, thereby aligning the investigation with inductive natural/medical science, rather than the Philosophical form of Psychology we associate with both Aristotle and Kant . The Freudian contribution to this discussion relates, of course, to his major discovery that the conscious mind, even when it is engaged in its most rational activities, is being influenced by a deep underlying unconscious substrate, that undoubtedly relates to man’s instincts. Many of the characteristics associated with our species over its relatively long history has been “handed down over generations”. Put such an individual in the context of a crowd or masses of people, and new characteristics will emerge which are probably the result of instincts that are normally restrained by the Ego being no longer regulated in the normal manner, because a feeling of invincible power arises when individuals are subsumed into large collectives which have no individual responsibility for their actions. This feeling of power arises presumably firstly, because there is no physical body for the ego to concern itself with, and secondly because the law, connected as it is with rational mechanisms, rather than with emotional mechanisms, has little influence in an environment in which emotional discourse is more easily produced and acted upon. In such a non-rational environment “techné”, or the instrumental use of scientific/military technology is not embedded in the ethical form of discourse which in its turn focuses upon individual responsibility and freedom to choose. The ethics of utilitarianism or consequentialism reigns, and the dimension of the categorical good-in-itself that is inevitably involved in the work of the superego is marginalised.\n\nThis is the environment in which Arendt’s “new men” emerged. We should remember that Descartes put his mathematical knowledge to use in military contexts, travelling as a mercenary to the different battle scenarios of the 30 year war(He designed military machines). Hobbes, (who believed in the possibility of squaring the circle), perhaps the first of the new men in England, also wrote pamphlets on the English civil war urging support for the royalists against the parliamentarians. Kant we know wrote philosophically both on the irrationality and terrible consequences of war and established a Philosophical commitment to “Perpetual Peace” which was completely disregarded by the time we arrive at Freud’s writings in the 1920’s (during the aftermath of the first world war and on the doorstep of the second world war). This was the period in which mass-political movements were being manipulated by the tyrants Plato warned us about in his Republic, and we know one such tyrant, Hitler, would in turn cause an aged Freud to flee to London to die in 1939.\n\nHitler was a master of contagious/suggestive rhetoric and mobilised the masses of Germany and Austria to rise against the rest of Europe. The Academics, in the various European Universities, were powerless to stop the popularistic waves of change initiated by Hitler and Stalin. Freud notes in his essay, that the rhetorician in such circumstances eventually takes control of his audience in a way similar to the way in which a hypnotist takes control of the consciousness of his subject. The acts that take place as a result of such suggestion are not performed in a fully conscious state, and are steered instinctively.\n\nIn such a condition the discourse is not rationally structured and uses instead images which do not know the boundaries of possibility and improbability. This is the Freudian psychological description of the thought processes of Arendt’s new men, for whom “everything was possible” especially for those who believe themselves to be omnipotent and omniscient. The world of the imaginary is more extensive than the world of the real. Freud points out that group psychology can have positive aspects too, in that it can, if steered by reason, rise ethically above what the individual is capable of, but the problem is that it can just as easily fall to depths where terrible actions can be considered and even perpetrated. Indeed the discourse fired by the illusory images of the imagination will always be more easily embraced by “the madding crowd”, which does not have the patience for the reality testing of the ideas that suggest certain courses of action.\n\nCollectives embracing the rule of law manifest clearly the possibility of the unselfish devotion of a collective to ethical norms, but this institution is the first target of tyrants who attempt to dismantle the credibility of legal and political institutions. The am of the tryrant is nothing less that revolution, and there are no qualms over the use of violence in such revolution. One of the conditions for the formation of such a revolutionary collective is that the crowd must be formed by, in some sense, “like-minded” individuals sharing an interest in common.\n\nFreud also quotes McDougall who claims a group:\n\n“is excessively emotional, impulsive, violent, fickle, inconsistent, irresolute and extreme in action, displaying only the coarser emotions and the less refined sentiments :extremely suggestible, careless in deliberation, hasty in judgement, incapable of any but the simpler and imperfect forms of reasoning; easily swayed and led, lacking in self-consciousness, devoid of self-respect and of sense of responsibility, and apt to be carried away by the consciousness of its own force, so that it tends to produce all the manifestations we have learned to expect of any responsible and absolute power. Hence its behaviour is like that of an unruly child or an untutored passionate savage in a strange situation, rather, than like that of its average member: and in the worst cases t is like that of a wild beast, rather than like that of human beings.”(McDougall, The Group Mind, 1920a)(17)\n\nFreud begins his analysis of the group by reference to an exercise in ordinary language Philosophy, when he discusses the meaning of the word love, and its use for the many different forms of love we find in the human form of life, e.g. sexual love, self-love, love for parents and children, friendship and love for humanity in general and finally love for concrete objects and abstract ideas. He coins the term “libido” and relates these ideas to Plato’s “Eros”:\n\n“the power that holds everything together in the world” (P.120)(18).\n\nFreud uses the term “libido” to oppose the unilateral thesis that it is the herd instinct which explains all the puzzling regressive behaviour of the group. Freud accepts the existence and the influence of this instinct which explains phenomena such as separation-anxiety but fails to account for the family of phenomena associated with group behaviour, in particular it fails to address the primary phenomenon associated with group behaviour, namely the lack of individual freedom of the members of the group. This in conjunction with the phenomenon of panic of the group is best understood via an understanding of the libidinal ties of member of the group to their leader and to each other. He analyses the institutional groups of the army and the church in the following way:\n\n“It is to be noticed that in these two artificial groups each individual is bound by libidinal ties on the one hand to the leader(Christ, the Commander-in-Chief) and on the other to the members of the group…..we shall venture even now upon a mild reproach against earlier writers for not having sufficiently appreciated the importance of the leader in the psychology of the group.”(P.124-5)(19)\n\nPanic occurs in different forms in both groups but for the same reasons, namely because the libidinal ties in the group for some reason are relaxed. This phenomenon can, for example, be clearly seen when a leader is killed in battle but it can also be seen when a fundamental idea important to the group is questioned, e.g. the doubting of the truth of the proposition that Jesus was resurrected, which Freud claims resulted in an increase in crime in Europe until the counter-claim was disproved.\n\nFreud then moves on to consider the possibility that members of a group may pledge allegiance to an abstract idea rather than a concrete leader, but even in such a case there will be what Freud calls a “secondary leader”. The love that exists in groups has no sexual component, and demands an abandonment of the narcissistic self love for the aims of altruism. Freud then turns to the question of the psychological mechanism responsible for the libidinal tie with the leader of the group. Given his initial claim that our personality is formed within the family constellation, it is therefore not surprising to learn that it is the defence-mechanism of identification which forms the core of our social relations in the loosely formed groups of our work place and the more tightly knit groups such as the army and the church. This is a more primitive mechanism than sympathy which presupposes some kind of identification with the object that engages our sympathetic responses. But it is also a more sophisticated mechanism given its role in the formation of the superego which is operating in accordance with a primitive wish to be like the father/mother/leader that is initially the object of ones desire, and then subsequently becomes something more fundamental that is introjected in the course of the imitation-process. What we are exploring are obviously in a sense causal mechanisms which are not manifest in the phenomenon we seek to explain, but relate instead to the phenomenon in some systematic way as a “condition” of the phenomenon occurring. The context at issue here is an “archeological” rather than a teleological matter, which is undoubtedly deeply embedded in a hylomorphic theory of change that includes kinds of change, media of change, principles of change as well as “causes”of change. Freud is clearly exploring the terrain the Delphic oracle would have characterised as “self-knowledge”: the most difficult of all forms of knowledge. Involved in this identification process, according to Freud is the loss of the object that has been introjected.\n\nFreud has, in many different ways, sought to distance himself from the Christian ideal of love which requires that one love ones neighbour and ones enemies. Freud’s grounds relate to a healthy concern for reality, and the absence of a sufficiently strong common interest for a “group-feeling” to emerge. Similarly, one can imagine Freud adopting a more Kantian approach to the Garden of Eden myth, and rejecting this story as carrying the message that the human is a necessarily flawed being whose desire for knowledge was going to lead to his downfall. The oracles of Greece, we know, believed that self-knowledge was necessary if one was to control ones desires(“Nothing too much”) and to avoid the sword of Ananke hanging over the artifactual creations of humankind (Everything created by man was destined for ruin and destruction). The “Nothing too much” formula was the motivation for Aristotle’s “golden mean principle”, and can also be applied to love or eros. We know from Freud that should one identify with an object that one loved, the loss of that object for a weak ego, might result in attempts to destroy oneself. The pain and suffering for the wounded ego becomes too much and acts of attempted self destruction might follow.\n\nThe “Good” strong ego functions in accordance with the reality principle, and given the complex nature of human existence, this requires knowledge to regulate the belief and action systems of the human form of life. For Kant, the Garden of Eden myth is a celebration of the liberating force of knowledge(symbolised by the apple from the tree of knowledge), and freedom, rather than a stain on the soul of a disobedient servant of God.\n\nFreud, is a follower of Darwin, who had great respect for the work of Aristotle, and who produced a theory of natural evolution of species that is fully in accord with the Aristotelian hylomorphic theory of change:\n\n“In 1912 I took up a conjecture of Darwin’s to the effect that the primitive form of human society was that of a horde ruled over despotically by a powerful male. I attempted to show that the fortunes of this horde have left indestructible traces upon the history of human descent; and especially , that the development of totemism, which comprises in itself the beginnings of religion, morality, and social organisation, is connected with the killing f the chief by violence and the transformation of the paternal horde into a community of brothers.” (p.154)(20)\n\nThis is the scenario Freud describes in his attempt to account for the emergence of the law against murder that will ensure that one of the brothers can in fact safely agree to lead the horde. The challenge for the leader of the horde to love all of the horde equally was, on Freud’s theory of love, impossible, and the inevitable result was the violence directed at him. Such a form of unconditional love may perhaps be only possible in smaller units such as the family. With the introduction of the law, however, the brothers can rightly expect equal treatment under the law and they can also reasonably believe that the law will also apply to the leader and protect the members of the group from legal persecution. Freud also points out that the hypnotic power of the leader is related to his power as a leader or father of the group. This effect is perhaps diminished, with the introduction of the law, and is replaced by a more neutral “respect for the law”. It is interesting to note, in the context of this discussion, that lady justice is blind, and possesses a sword which is a residue of the threat of the violence of the father. The blindfold is a symbol of the impartial aim of the law, and this, in turn, indicates that the physical appearance of the brothers inevitably brings with it the issue of who can in fact be loved and who cannot.\n\nAristotle solved the problem of describing the need for an eros laden attitude toward all members/citizens of the polis by using the term philia in relation to the idea of the good and the end of eudaimonia(a good spirited flourishing life(of the community)). Citizens are “friends” in Aristotle’s eyes, but it is not certain that one can be friends with all citizens of the polis (e.g. Socrates and his accusers), and perhaps a more neutral technical term such as philia is more appropriate. For Kant the more appropriate term to be used to describe these forms of relations is “respect”, a term that is aimed at describing a more abstract attitude, that covers both persons and a moral law which demands that we treat all persons as ends-in-themselves. For Freud, however, the modern individual is a member of many different groups each of which contribute to the totality of his/her personality.\n\nWhat we have experienced in the reflections of Freud, is a combination of a method that reduces a phenomenon to a fundamental condition, a collection of fundamental conditions, and an attempted composition of these conditions into a totality, which often does not have a name. This was not the ancient Greek methodology of the Philosophers, whose sight was fixated upon the more rationally constituted holistic state which Freud was using as the true north pointer for his theorising. This did not however, prevent him from using this reductive-compositive method of inductive science to identify the archeological aspect of his personality-theory. This choice reflects an anti-rational attitude which was not shared by Plato, Aristotle, or Kant, but was perhaps inevitable given the decision of Psychologists in Europe and the US in 1870 to separate the discipline from the holistic Philosophical Psychology that we find in the writings of Plato, Aristotle and Kant. These latter philosophers were searching, not for isolated conditions of phenomena, but for the “totality of conditions” that made the phenomenon in question possible, as Kant put the matter. In this kind of investigation (located in a context of explanation/justification), both Aristotle’s Theory of Change and Kant’s Critical Philosophy play a decisive role. The Greeks could not separate their accounts of philosophical psychology from the political philosophy and ethics of the time, and the same was true of Kantian Critical Philosophy. Modern Psychology and Philosophy were not aiming at the whole, for which there was no name except for “Being”, and its many meanings. Martin Heidegger attempted to introduce a more holistic perspective into his Philosophical Psychology via the terms “Being-there”(Dasein) and “Being-in-the-world”, but it became clear in his writings on Kant that he rested his account, not on the foundation of Reason, but on Transcendental Imagination. We need therefore to return to Kant’s ethical and political writings in order to get a clearer view of the whole that has no name but is connected to both knowledge(epistemé) and ethical/political action(areté, diké).\n\nKant, in his work “Groundwork for a Metaphysics of Morals”,(21) continues his project of articulating the scope and limits of the domain of metaphysics via a search for, and a discovery of, a fundamental formal principle of morality. He also gives an account of the transcendental philosophy involved in the three formulations of the categorical imperative (the prime example of synthetic a priori judgments in the realm of morality). In this work, Kant refers to the ancient division of Philosophical disciplines into physics, ethics, and logic but it is not clear here as to whom among the Ancients he is talking about. Aristotle’s division of the sciences into the theoretical, practical and productive ,does not quite support such a division. Depending upon one’s view, Kant can be construed as improving upon the role of Aristotelian Metaphysics in this debate, by claiming that every science has both a formal part, in which the principles of the science are the focus, and a material part in which the empirical content of the science is contained. Insofar as moral science is concerned the formulations of the categorical imperative, and the transcendental philosophy of the will associated with it, are the focus of the Groundwork. The account of the Empirical aspect of Morality is then left to a later work entitled “Anthropology: from a Pragmatic Point of View”. The Kantian system of Morality is built upon the transcendental element of the good will that is part of the nature of a human rational agent. Finer and finer moral distinctions are articulated, beginning with that between doing an action in accordance with the categorical imperative and doing an action constituted by the categorical imperative. Kant illustrates this distinction by giving an example of a shopkeeper who refrains from short-changing strangers and children he serves in his shop because, in the long run, such actions would not be good for business. Such an action, Kant argues, may be instrumentally good but he argues that it is not categorically good and this can easily be proved by appealing to those circumstances where the shopkeeper merely changed their mind about what is good for business and adopted a policy of short-changing children and strangers in his shop (perhaps because his shop was the only shop in the village). One can imagine thereupon, general outrage at this phenomenon of not being universally honest with one’s customers. This outrage would be founded on an understanding of the universal law of the categorical imperative, and this might even eventually result in competitors setting up businesses with more honest business practices–thus proving the power(good consequences) of the ought system of concepts in moral contexts. There are a number of problems with instrumental imperatives relating to the so-called long term good for a business, and one problem, is that the “long term good” being referred to here, is more often than not founded on a selfish principle, a principle-based on self-love, as Kant puts it.\n\nHappiness is often a long-term aim, and is connected to instrumental reasoning of this sort. Of course, such a principle can be used, instead of the more universal categorical imperative, and insofar as Reason is being used here, it is solely for the purposes of examining whether the means to the end of happiness is causally efficacious. In the instrumental case, the end in itself is not examined in any critical objective spirit: a spirit that would question whether the agent of the action deserved the happiness involved. The worth of the action is directly connected to the categorical goodness of the will defined in terms of the three formulations of the categorical imperative and the logical characteristics of such judgment, namely universality, and necessity. Insofar as universality and necessity are the logical characteristics of such ought-oriented judgments, they are objective, but descending to the account of the empirical content of such judgments, we can find Kant speaking in terms of an opposition between the subjective and the objective: the subjective being where the subject is not involved or committed to the so-called “object of the action”. In instrumental cases of action, furthermore, the “measure” of the rationality of the action is not in terms of the maxim of the action (which may be regarded as “subjective”) but rather in terms of its causal consequences (such as happiness), thus opening up a logical gap between cause and effect (that must be logically independent of each other). The maxims involved in such instrumental reasoning can, therefore, not be universalised in the way that the maxims constituted by the categorical imperative can be. For Kant, such instrumentally oriented maxims might be “Objective”, in the sense of “causally determined”, but they are not objective in the logical sense of being universally valid for all acting agents. Maxims that are universalisable and necessary, are the product of the absolute in Kant’s system, the absolute of a good will that is a priori and is related to experience in the logical sense of being its “organiser” or “principle”. In other words, the “good will” here denotes a way of acting (given that experience can involve a doing as well as a suffering). According to Kant, our everyday knowledge of the categorical imperative is not universal, and perhaps not even widespread. Indeed he even considers the logical possibility that no pure moral action has ever been performed. Kuehn, one of the biographers of Kant, has the following comment to make in relation to this issue: (22))\n\n“Kant, in other words, does not intend to deal with the everyday situations or ordinary moral agents. He deals, rather, with an ideal of pure reason that is entirely a priori. This ideal, which he calls the categorical imperative, is not given in “experience”. It is an a priori synthetic practical proposition whose very possibility is difficult to “see”. Indeed Kant ends his book by emphasising that “we do not comprehend the practical unconditioned necessity of the moral imperative”. We only “comprehend its incomprehensibility” and this “is all that can be fairly required of a philosophy that strives in its principles to the very boundary of human\n\nreason.”(Manfred Kuehn, “Kant: A Biography” P. 285-6)\n\nKant’s Political Philosophy, which is largely a political application of his moral Philosophy, conceives of a state of humankind one hundred thousand years in the future, a state that he calls a “Kingdom of Ends”. This teleological end-state in which reason is fully installed in the minds of the species of man is constituted by the categorical imperative. The length of time that this process will take testifies to the “incomprehensibility” of the categorical imperative, and also indicates the power of how things are over how things ought to be. The link between these two logical realms is that of the will and its domain of operation (the domain of action). Here Kant is not referring to a notion of the General Will, but rather to the individual will and its freedom to choose what it ought to do, to make true what was not true before. If the will is good and the maxims are therefore good in the sense of being universal and necessary, then we are, according to Kant, in the realm of the morally good. We are the only authority that can be held responsible for the maxims we choose to embrace as the maxims of our actions. Kant is invoking the idea of Freedom, which, he elaborates upon in his Groundwork:(23)\n\n“We must presuppose it if we want to think of a being as rational and endowed with consciousness of his causality with respect to actions, that is, with a will, and so we find that…we must assign to every being endowed with reason and will this property of determining himself to action under the idea of freedom.”(Kant’s Practical Philosophy P. 96)\n\nThis remark, when taken in the context of Political Philosophy, and in the context of the further contention in the Groundwork that we cannot embrace the universality of the moral law for everyone if we are prone to make exceptions of ourselves, suggests the importance of the concept of equality. Equality is an important principle of justice and is constituted by the moral law: the law which many would argue is the source of the concept of equality that is operating in our legal systems. We are, according to Kant’s moral reasoning, free to choose both the maxim of our action, and also whether to perform the action in question under the condition of equality.\n\nMany Political Philosophers will readily recognise the importance of the combination of these two ideas of freedom and equality insofar as the formation of the concept of Human Rights is concerned. This is the same concept we encounter in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It should also be recognised in this context that Kant conceived of the founding of such an institution of a United Nations in the late eighteenth century in order to solve the political problem of international conflict and war. It is clear to all discerning commentators, that Kant’s Political Philosophy is entwined with his Ethics and Philosophical Psychology, two of the realms of consideration involved in our putative progress toward a distant kingdom of ends. The nature of man, Kant argues in this context, is to be antagonistic toward his fellow man because of an inherent ambivalent disposition toward being simultaneously social and unsociable. Humankind, it is argued, needs a master, but does not wish to be mastered by any other human being. The laws of the polis are predicated upon the above conditions, and the telos of a possible kingdom of ends is built into the very structure of laws. When the kingdom of ends approaches, it is argued, moral judgments will no longer be imperatives in the sense they are today. The need for laws might wither away as imperatives become generally or universally actualised, and perhaps History (of moral development) comes to an end. Of course, significant events will continue to occur internationally. Kant, in an essay entitled “What is Enlightenment?”, adds an “Anthropological” account of man’s role in what he called the Age of Enlightenment (to be distinguished from an enlightened age in which the Kingdom of Ends has been established). He discusses our collective characteristics in no uncertain terms:\n\n“It is because of laziness and cowardice that so great a part of humankind, after nature has long since emancipated them from other people’s direction (naturaliter maiorennes), nevertheless gladly remain minors for life, and that it becomes so easy for others to set themselves up as guardians. It is so comfortable to be a minor! If I have a book that understands for me, a doctor who decides upon a regimen for me and so forth, I need not trouble myself at all.”(Practical Philosophy P.17)(24)\n\nThis combination of the descriptive thesis of the “crooked timber of humanity”, and the moral challenge daring humanity to use their reason provides, then, the educational message Kant wishes to proclaim on behalf of the progress of mankind during the Age of Enlightenment. Freedom, of course, is the key component in freeing ourselves from this so-called “self-incurred minority”:\n\n“For this enlightenment, however, nothing is required but Freedom, namely freedom to make public use of one’s reason in all matters. But I hear from all sides the cry: Do not argue! The officer says Do not argue but drill! The tax official: Do not argue but pay! The clergyman: Do not argue but believe!…The public use of one’s reason must always be free and it alone can bring about enlightenment among human beings.” (PR P.18)(25)\n\nKant is arguing here, not for civil disobedience in matters of tax, religion and military matters, but rather for a climate of debate about all matters of concern for men living in society. One should pay one’s taxes, believe, and march, when required, but all such activities can be accompanied by healthy discussions about the reasons for obedience. Kant, we recall, was himself subject to an injunction to cease using his reason publicly in matters of religion, by his Emperor no less. He obeyed Emperor Fredrik whilst he was still alive, but continued his critical religious discussion in Enlightenment spirit after Fredrik’s death. In continuing writing on religious matters, Kant was merely embracing his own vision for the Age of Enlightenment. Kant was, of course, well aware of the tendency for Governments, since the writings of Hobbes, to treat its citizens like cogs in a huge machine, and not accord them the dignity they deserved in matters of morality and freedom. This was one of the reasons why Kant urged us to dare to use our reason and overcome our natural laziness and cowardice. Freedom, for Kant, then, is the idea of reason that turns the giant wheel of the progress of civilisation. This challenge to use one’s reason also echoes once again the thesis of the Groundwork that it is not the consequences of one’s actions one should be calculating when one is acting morally, but rather the “principle of the will”(PR P 55). Consequences are what the lazy and cowardly man fears the most and relates to desires and inclinations that in turn can steer us away from doing what is experienced painfully as our duty. Dutiful action, in a context of reasoned debate, then, is the highest unconditioned good that can be found in the arena of moral action. The mind, for many scientifically inclined Philosophers such as Hobbes, resembles a machine that works in accordance with laws, but for Kant moral consciousness is constituted by the moral law, because man is a being who has the capacity to act constitutively in the name of these laws. Reason, in such contexts, derives particular actions from the moral law because it can represent these laws in thought. However, it is because we are also so constituted by our desires and inclinations steering us toward our own comfort and happiness that the moral law takes the form of an imperative–the form of an ought-statement. The mind of a moral agent represents an objective principle as that which ought to be instantiated via the performing of a particular action.\n\nKant represents well the complex constitution of the human mind in terms of three systems of cognition that can all relate to action, namely Sensibility, Understanding, and Reason. When Reason and Understanding are operative, the law constitutes grounds for acting that are universally valid for every rational being.Principles of action, according to the Groundwork, can both also be what Kant calls rules of skill or counsels of prudence, and in both cases the ought statements relate to the means to achieve some end that can in fact be morally wrong or even evil as is the case of the poisoner who behaves like a doctor in administering a substance (to kill his enemy rather than cure a patient), or the case of the poisoner who “prudently ” murders his parents in order to inherit their fortune and lead a comfortable happy life. In both cases, it is the inclinations of the faculty of Sensibility that steers the outcome (consequences) and are thereby the “conditions” of the action. In the case of actions steered by the faculties of the Understanding, Reason, and the categorical imperative, the grounds of the action are not “conditioned” by the “causes” of the “inclinations” but rather the grounds of the action are “constituted” by what is unconditioned and necessary. This reasoning process overrides sensible inclinations, as in the case of the subject who considers poisoning someone but abandons the course of action because it is categorically wrong (not constituted by the categorical imperative).\n\nImperatives of skills such as the building of a house are “world-building” skills and when they are not in contradiction with the moral law, they shape the world we live in positively. The proposition expressing the relation of means to ends (adding a house to an existing village or city) is, according to Kant, an analytic proposition that has the hypothetical form of “If I will the effect, I must will the action to bring the effect about”. It is obvious that there is nothing necessary about the antecedent. In this proposition the necessity lies in the relation of the means to the end, i.e. I might change my mind about willing the effect or the end and in such circumstances willing the means becomes otiose. Prudential propositions concerning prudential actions, on the other hand, are directed to one’s personal happiness and are designated as synthetic judgments in Kant’s system. Here the end of happiness is so indeterminate, i.e. we do not very often have accurate knowledge of what it is that would make us happy because what we think we know seems to vary with the circumstances. If I am ill, I believe I will be happy when my health returns. Becoming healthy I realise how poor I am, and believe that if I become rich I will be happy. When I become rich I become aware of the possibility of losing all my money and enter the political arena in an attempt to avoid this possible consequence of political decisions (cf. Cephalus in the Republic). Becoming politically powerful merely makes me aware of the possibility of losing power and the dangers this brings with it in unstable political systems. This sequence of events demonstrates the relativity of the concept of happiness that can only be universally valid under the categorical unconditioned imperative that contributes to making us worthy of being happy. One of the cases of the categorical imperative discussed in the Groundwork is “one ought not to promise anything deceitfully”. This statement is not to be analysed hypothetically, e.g. “one ought not to make lying promises lest if this comes to light one lose one’s credibility”. Kant clearly distinguishes here between different kinds of judgments guiding the will: synthetic judgments of prudential counsel, analytic judgments of rules of skill and the synthetic a priori judgments of the categorical imperative e.g. “Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law”. It is this formulation that helps to define our duties in the realm of action. Kant further distinguishes two kinds of duties. Firstly, there are duties, the defiance of which, constitute fully-fledged practical contradictions and secondly, there are duties the defiance of which can be thought without contradiction but which make the world an unnecessarily difficult place in which to live. The Moral Law rests on a philosophical foundation: a foundation of absolute worth which Kant also conceives of in terms of an end-in-itself in a second formulation of the categorical imperative that can also be found in the Groundwork. Kant, in this context, insists that the rational human being:\n\n“exists as an end in itself, not merely as a means to be used by this or that will at its\n\ndiscretion: instead he must in all his actions, whether directed to himself or also to other rational beings, always be regarded at the same time as an end”(PR P.79)(26)\n\nAssociated with this idea of an end is a telos or teleological terminating point of a civilisation in which all humans have evolved into moral beings daring to use their reason in relation to both beliefs and actions. This terminating point Kant\n\ncalls the Kingdom of Ends:\n\n“By a kingdom of ends, I understand a systematic union of various rational beings through common laws. Now laws determine ends in terms of their universal validity if we abstract from the personal differences of rational beings as well as from all the content of their private ends we shall be able to think of a whole of all ends in systematic connection, in that is, a kingdom of ends which is possible in accordance with the above principles.”(PR P.83)(27)\n\nA rational being becomes then a citizen of this kingdom and both aids in the creation of these laws as well as himself being subject to its laws, i.e. he is both citizen and sovereign in this ideal kingdom. Partly because of this dual characteristic the law is deemed worthy of respect, but also perhaps because the will is a law unto itself and the source of the dignity of a rational human being. This property of the will being a law unto itself, a causa sui, is equated by Kant with practical reason and related intimately to the practical freedom of the individual. Kant returns to one of the themes of the Enlightenment and contrasts this autonomy or freedom with what he terms heteronomy, or acting in accordance with the principle of self-love and the subjective prudential interests that constitute such self-love. Heteronomy is in turn connected with the world of sense in which I can have an interest in being well when sick, rich when poor, in being politically active to protect one’s fortune, being anxious about losing one’s power, etc. etc. The world of sense is, in more senses than one, a Heraclitean world, forever changing. The world of understanding and reason, on the other hand, is a world of stability in which a deceitful promise is always and forever wrong and evil. We are, Kant insists, denizens of the world of sense and citizens of the world of understanding in virtue of being a possessor of the power of Reason, an active power, in contrast to the passive receptive capacity of Sensibility. Intelligent beings inhabit the intellectual world of the Understanding. This is one of the reasons why the rational human being conceives of practical law in terms of an imperative expressed in ought premises in a practical syllogism:\n\n“The human being who in this way regards himself as an intelligence, thereby puts himself in a different order of things and in a relation to determining grounds of an altogether different kind when he thinks of himself as an intelligence endowed with a will, and consequently with causality, that when he perceives himself as a phenomenon in the world of sense(as he also really is) and subjects his causality to external determination in accordance with laws of nature. Now he soon becomes aware that both can take place at the same time, and indeed must do so. For that a thing in appearance(belonging to the world of sense)is subject to certain laws from which as a thing or being in itself it is independent contains not the least contradiction: that he must represent and think of himself in this two-fold way, however, rests as regards the first on consciousness of himself as an object affected through the senses and as regards the second a consciousness of himself as an intelligence that is as independent of sensible impressions in the use of reason(hence as belonging to the world of understanding)” (PR P.103)(28)\n\nIt is via the practical law of action then, that the self as noumenon becomes conscious of itself as an end in itself, or as a potential citizen of a Kingdom of ends. This self cannot be cognised completely, but rather stands as Kant puts it at the end of his work “Groundwork”, at the very boundary of human reason and at the boundary of what Kant calls an archetypal world. The only other super-sensible being in Kant’s Philosophy is that of God who governs the natural world with laws of nature in a deterministic system that cannot be conceived by\n\nus because:\n\n“it is impossible through metaphysics to proceed by sure inferences from knowledge of this world to the concept of God and to the proof of his existence, for this reason: that in order to say that this world was possible only through a God(as we must think this concept) we would have to cognise this world as the most perfect whole possible and, in order to do so, cognise all possible worlds as well(so as to be able to compare them with this one), and would therefore have to be omniscient. Finally, however, it is absolutely impossible to cognise the existence of this being from mere concepts, because every existential proposition, that is, every proposition that says of a being of which I frame a concept, that it exists–is a synthetic proposition, that is one by which I go beyond that concept and say more about it than was thought in the concept, namely, that to this concept in the understanding there corresponds an object outside the understanding which it is absolutely impossible to elicit by any reference.”(PR P. 252)(29)\n\nWhat is lacking here is “a precisely determined concept of this original being”(PR P.252)(30). It is, Kant argues, via the practical concept of the highest good as given by the moral law that we can determine the properties of a supreme being who is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent and externally existing. The idea of God, in other words, for Kant, is not something that could fill his mind with awe and admiration:\n\n“Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and reverence, the more often and the more steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me. I do not need to search for them and merely conjecture them as though they were veiled in obscurity or in the transcendent region beyond my horizon: I see them before me and connect them immediately with the consciousness of my existence. The first begins from the place I occupy in the external world of sense and extends the connection in which I stand into an unbounded magnitude with worlds upon worlds, and systems of systems, and moreover into the unbounded times of their periodic motion, their beginning and their duration. The second begins from my invisible self, my personality,, and presents me in a world which has true infinity, but which can be discovered only by the understanding, and I cognise that my connection with that world(and thereby with all these visible worlds as well) is not merely contingent as in the first case, but universal and necessary. The first view of a countless multitude of worlds annihilates as it were my importance as an actual creature, which after it has been for a short time provided with vital force(one knows not how) must give back to the planet (a mere speck in the universe) the matter from which it came. the second, on the contrary infinitely raises my worth as an intelligence by my personality, in which the moral law reveals to me a life independent of animality and even of the whole sensible world, at least so far as this may be inferred from the purposive determination of my existence by this law, a determination not restricted to the conditions and boundaries of this life but reaching into the infinite.”(PR P.269) (31)\n\nOur explanations of the scope and limits of our life begin with an immediate consciousness of my existence that involves the starry heavens without and the moral law within me. In the case of the universe outside of me, I am somehow sensibly aware of unbounded space and time that in turn quickens in me a feeling of my finite animal life on this speck of a planet. In the case of the latter, I become aware of infinity via the power of understanding that any active consciousness possesses, and that transcends the sensible world of space and time. The idea of God is conspicuous by its absence in the above conclusion of the Critique of Practical Reason. The idea of God has been clearly replaced by Enlightenment man, finite in his matter but embracing the infinite in the forms of his moral/practical understanding and the idea of freedom. There is a suggestion here not merely of a matter-form (hylomorphic) relation, but also of a theoretical understanding of man in which the powers of Sensibility, space and time, are built upon and transformed by the powers of the understanding and reason. If this is a correct interpretation, then Kant is here demonstrating an Aristotelian commitment to the philosophical psychology that is required to support his moral theory. The concepts of the goodwill and the moral law are indeed innovations, but they fit neatly into the incomplete moral puzzle left by the ethical speculations of Aristotle: speculations on arête (virtue), and eudaimonia (flourishing life). Kant’s theory leaves no space for a theoretical view of God’s existence but he believes that we can practically hope for a just God to reward the life led responsibly: the life constituted by the moral law. Enlightenment man, then, understands his physical place in the universe but transcends this finitude with an understanding and reason that can bring about the comprehension of infinitude .\n\nIn the Third Critique, the Critique of Judgment, this view of Enlightenment man is reiterated in a context of witnessing the power of a mighty waterfall. The first moment of such an experience makes man aware of his finitude and puniness in the face of such sublime physical power. The second moment is a moment of transcendence in which man becomes aware of himself as a moral power in an intellectual universe, a power that transcends any physical power. The intellectual world supervenes in the second moment and the sensible world shrinks into the background of one’s consciousness of one’s own existence. In this account, we see no space for an idea of God, but it is nonetheless clear that Kant is not arguing that God is any sense dead, or non-existent. Kant was not a God-intoxicated philosopher like Spinoza or Leibniz, but neither was he an atheist. Kant clearly argues that our moral dispositions give rise to a faith in God’s existence, a faith that springs from a Hope for a flourishing life as a consequence of leading a worthy moral life. The future Kingdom of Ends may sometimes look to be a very secular vision but it also has a theological dimension that realises our hopes in terms of the sacred and the holy.\n\nEnlightenment man has Enlightenment duties and these are systematically outlined in Kant’s last work “The Metaphysics of Morals”. The moral revolution of Kant’s duty-based ethics reveals clearly the limitations of Aristotelian virtue theory. Aristotle’s theory does not link Philosophical Psychology to ethical theory in the way in which Kant does. This poses difficulties in relation to the questions as to how and why the law binds man to the Good, as well as difficulties relating to the Rights of Man that emerge when the systems of Law and Morality converge. The Metaphysics of Morals is in two parts: the metaphysical a priori principles of the doctrine of Right, and the metaphysical a priori principles of the doctrine of Virtue. In an early section entitled “On the Relation of the Faculties of the Human Mind to Moral Laws”, Kant presents his views on the kind of Philosophical Psychology that is required to sustain a moral theory:\n\n“the faculty of desire is the faculty to be, by means of one’s representations, the cause of the objects of these representations. The faculty of a being to act in accordance with its representations is called life”(PR P.373)32\n\nInsofar as we take pleasure in a representation, this pleasure is nothing cognitive but simply a relation to a subject in the form of a feeling. Not being cognitive capacities, pleasure and displeasure cannot have explanations beyond what forms of consciousness are involved in certain circumstances. The connection of desire to pleasure ,forms what Kant calls an interest. D"
