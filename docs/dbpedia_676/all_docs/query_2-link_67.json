O’Sullivan\n\nThe influence of Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe and her husband Peter Geach on philosophical thought over the past seventy years cannot be overestimated. They reignited the moral imagination in philosophy and brought new life to a branch of thought which had degenerated into a mere cataloging of axioms. Anscombe’s 1958 essay Modern Moral Philosophy restored the reputation of aretaic philosophy, or philosophical thinking about virtue, to contemporary discourse – and with no little thanks to Aristotle and Aquinas, to whom Anscombe owed a considerable debt.\n\nTo weigh the influence of Anscombe upon succeeding generations without, and at the very same time considering the significance of her Catholicism would be foolhardy, as several of the papers in this remarkable collection demonstrate. Anscombe was converted to Catholicism during a time when British intellectuals were discovering or rediscovering the Church in droves.\n\nG. K. Chesterton, whose books first led Anscombe to Rome, was a relative latecomer to Catholicism. He waited until 1922, at the surprisingly ripe age of forty-eight, before joining the confirmandi. Chesterton had been defending the Roman Catholic Church for years but as something of a bystander, clinging tenaciously to Anglo-Catholicism until late middle age. And on the occasion of his full acceptance into the Church his waggish friend George Bernard Shaw wrote, Gilbert, this is going too far.\n\nAnscombe, like Chesterton and many other intellectuals of their generation, gravitated to Roman Catholicism as the sanctuary of wisdom that it is – and especially in the years between the wars, when Europe found itself in a shambles after Armistice. Few historians of that period remember the power exerted upon post-war Catholic Britain by Spode House, a conference center maintained by the Dominicans of Blackfriars and overseen, for much of its intensely rich history, by Father Conrad Pepler, OP.\n\nFather Conrad, as he was known to all, was founding Warden of the first Roman Catholic conference center in the United Kingdom. He was also the priest made unintentionally famous when he conferred conditional absolution on a dying Ludwig Wittgenstein in 1951. Fr. Conrad recited the office while surrounded by the philosopher’s kneeling friends – among them Wittgenstein’s protégé Elizabeth Anscombe.\n\nAnscombe and her husband Peter Geach met at Blackfriars on the Feast of Corpus Christi in 1938. They, like so many Oxford and Cambridge intellectuals, were drawn to Blackfriars and Spode House, the latter of which was maintained by Fr. Conrad and his Dominican brothers as a site dedicated to what Augustine called the tranquility of order. In the years between the wars and after, this phrase guided Spode House and the community of Catholic and non-Catholic intellectuals which gathered within its walls.\n\nGroups of men and women assembled in this quiet, convivial Staffordshire setting to debate the finer points of Thomism and attempt to reassemble the pieces of a culture left in ruins. It was here that Anscombe and Geach previewed some of their most insightful papers, surrounded by others steeped in the classical and contemporary philosophical traditions. Spode House was, for all intents and purposes, the birthplace of what we today call analytical Thomism and the place beyond Oxford where Wittgenstein could converse most openly with his Dominican students – Frs. Herbert McCabe, Conrad Pepler, Cornelius Ernst, and Fergus Kerr among them.\n\nFor Anscombe and Geach, Catholicism was something which they lived and breathed every day of their rich married lives together. It brought them into contact with Spode House and made them an integral part of the Catholic ferment of modern European life. Ergo, their immersion in analytical philosophy and Thomism was not merely something they thought about. It was something they did. And this cannot be unbundled and unwound from their faith.\n\nThis wonderful volume of papers owes a great debt of thanks to Drs. John Mizzoni, Philip Pegan and Geoffrey Karabin of the Neumann University philosophy faculty. Together Professors Mizzoni, Pegan and Karabin inaugurated the annual Anscombe Forum as homage to the memory of G.E.M. Anscombe on the event of her 95th birthday in 2014.\n\nEvery year, in March, thinkers who are working within the living tradition of Anscombe and Geach gather on Neumann’s campus in Aston, Pennsylvania and bring to life again that great convivium that was Spode House in its heyday. And every year hereafter may the participants gather together and raise their glasses high in toast to the lives and legacies of two of Catholicism and the west’s most distinguished thinkers.\n\n…\n\nPart 1\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. G.E.M. Anscombe and the Catholic Intellectual Tradition\n\nJohn Mizzoni, Philip Pegan & Geoffrey Karabin\n\nThe papers in this volume are drawn from a conference held on March 14-15, 2014 at Neumann University, in Aston, Pennsylvania. Neumann University is a small, Catholic Franciscan university located in the greater Philadelphia area. We are grateful to everyone who helped to make Neumann’s inaugural conference on the thought of Anscombe such a wonderful success. We thank the presenters, the chairs of the sessions, the staff of Neumann University, as well as Gerard O’Sullivan, formerly the Vice President for Academic Affairs at Neumann, who provided support and encouragement throughout the planning and hosting of the conference.\n\nMarch 2014 marked the 95th birthday of G.E.M. Anscombe (1919 – 2001), one of the twentieth century’s most provocative and highly regarded philosophers, who was also a pupil of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Anscombe is known for challenging received philosophical views, and some commentators have regarded her as the greatest woman philosopher of all time. Many conferences on Anscombe’s work have focused on her contributions to moral philosophy, virtue ethics, and action theory. The conference held at Neumann focused on the question: What are Anscombe’s contributions—actual and potential—to the Catholic intellectual tradition? Conference participants worked with this question through an exploration of a wide range of themes from Anscombe’s work, including contraception, personhood, the soul, the will, marriage, and the doctrine of double effect, among other topics. Some papers explored how her Catholic faith influenced her approach to philosophy and how her faith influenced the types of philosophical issues with which she dealt. The present volume contains a selection of these papers. The volume unfortunately does not contain Candace Vogler’s talk Anscombe’s Complaint: The Importance of Moral Prohibition, as it had been previously promised to another publisher. As a continuation of the first, introductory, part of this book, the second essay, written by Joseph Boyle, recounts his and his family’s experiences in knowing Elizabeth Anscombe, as an astute, forceful, and courageous Catholic philosopher. Yet Boyle goes beyond offering an account of Anscombe the philosopher; he provides insight into Elizabeth Anscombe as a good friend. What is particularly notable about Boyle’s account is Anscombe’ authenticity, not only with regard to her pursuit of truth, but in terms of living out those truths in concrete relationships.\n\nIn the second part of the volume, the authors focus on Anscombe’s contributions to Catholic moral theory. First, Fr. Dennis Billy gives an overview of Anscombe as a Catholic philosopher and reviews some of Anscombe’s work in moral theory, as it bears on and has influenced Catholic moral theory. He also discusses how Catholic thought was influential on Anscombe herself. In the next paper, Justin Anderson seeks to clarify Anscombe’s ethical absolutism, which is an important dimension of Catholic ethics. Anderson proposes to do this by tying her commitment to ethical absolutism to her work on intention. According to Anderson, Anscombe seeks to articulate an account of ethics whose foundation, while focused on intentional action, is not reduced to a purely subjective or internal mental state. In this account, ethics must be understood both in terms of what the agent thinks as well as what the agent does. Anderson points out how Anscombe’s work on this theme is relevant to contemporary Thomism, along with the nature of ethical absolutism, an ethical absolutism, Anderson argues, which is misunderstood by some prominent contemporary Anscombean scholars.\n\nPart three of the volume contains two papers focusing on Anscombe’s work on double effect or, ‘side effects,’ as she preferred to call it (see the enclosed papers by Billy, Buttaci, and Cavanaugh). As with ethical absolutism, the principle of double effect has occupied an important place in Catholic ethics; specifically, as a means for analyzing the morality of good actions that become entangled in evil. Just as Anderson in part II sought to reconcile themes from Anscombe’s earlier and later works, in part III Jonathan Buttaci—with a series of clever examples—attempts to clarify how Anscombe can consistently allow that there are external constraints on the content of our intentions. This is a position, says Buttaci, which may not initially appear Anscombean if we only consider her earlier work. In brief, the idea is that ‘the ordinary course of things’ plays a role in determining under which descriptions an act is intentional. This idea, Buttaci argues, can be used to support Anscombe’s judgments about some famous cases. Buttaci draws upon Aristotelian metaphysics to enrich and support the view he defends.\n\nIn the sixth paper of the volume T.A. Cavanaugh lays out the moral importance of the intended/foreseen distinction that Anscombe defends (a distinction essential for the principle of double effect). He argues that the intended/foreseen distinction is important, not only for resisting the lure of consequentialism, but also because it is crucial to any ethics, such as Catholic ethics, that recognizes absolute prohibitions, the intrinsic badness of certain acts, and the importance of virtue and vice. In the final section of his paper Cavanaugh notes that the intended/foreseen distinction is part of moral psychology and credits Anscombe with doing much to show, and remind us, that moral psychology is morally important psychology.\n\nPart four of the volume brings together three papers that examine some of Anscombe’s work on embryos, souls, and persons. David and Rose Hershenov open the section with an examination of Anscombe’s arguments regarding the metaphysical and ethical status of embryos. They show that Anscombe provided philosophical support [for] the Church’s mandate that we treat embryos as one of us even as she maintained that the early embryo was not a human being. They argue that [t]here are many things to appreciate about Anscombe’s position. Still, they argue, a better position is available. While Anscombe enlists Aquinas and facts about monozygotic twinning in support of her view that the early embryo is not a human being, the Hershenovs deploy Thomistic metaphysics and facts about twinning to support the view that a human being – or, in the case of monozygotic twins, two human beings – is (are) present from the moment of conception.\n\nIn essay eight Peter Furlong and Michael Staron focus their attention on Anscombe’s claims about the human person after death in The Immortality of the Soul, an early paper of hers that she did not publish. For Anscombe, puzzles arise when we consider the religious practice of praying to and for these deceased persons. What are these souls? Where are they? And are they immaterial substances? Anscombe is not satisfied with the concept ‘immaterial substance’. And, according to Furlong and Staron, Anscombe was ultimately unable to specify a way to characterize the deceased in such a way that would make it intelligible for Catholics to pray to and for these persons.\n\nJeremy Bell, in essay nine, continues the analysis of Anscombe’s paper on the immortality of the soul. The essay is a nuanced reflection on whether it is sensible to speak of immaterial substances. The gateway to that reflection is the question of whether one can sensibly talk about the immortality of a soul in a state between death and a resurrected body. Bell incorporates both the metaphysics of Aristotle and Thomas and argues, contra Anscombe, that it is possible, at least in principle, to sensibly call something an immaterial substance. Bell’s work thereby contributes to a philosophical discussion of substance as well as provides a critique of Anscombe’s understanding of substance.\n\nBell’s critique, however, is far from dismissive. He sees Anscombe as involved in a philosophically heroic, but ultimately untenable project. Bell reasons that the difficulties that Anscombe encounters with this topic reveal a deep tension between Anscombe’s Wittgensteinianism and her Catholicism. Bell acknowledges that Anscombe has made real contributions to the Catholic intellectual tradition, but he suggests that \"this contribution has lasting value perhaps despite Wittgenstein’s influence, not because of it.\" Anscombe’s commitment both to Catholic orthodoxy and the insights of Wittgenstein lead her, Bell concludes, to defend the belief in the existence of a soul that nonetheless cannot be identified with an entity.\n\nUltimately, all of the contributors to this volume are in agreement that Anscombe has indeed made a lasting impact not only on philosophy and ethics, but also on the Catholic intellectual tradition, broadly construed. In the context of discussing Anscombe’s work on ethics, Cavanaugh said it best when he stated that we need her profound insights, and [d]eeply in her debt we remain.\n\n2. Recollections of Elizabeth Anscombe\n\nJoseph M. Boyle, Jr.\n\nMany North American philosophers of my age cohort, completing degrees and getting first jobs around 1970, would have encountered Elizabeth Anscombe. Some might have studied with her, and some surely came to know her and her work better than I. But my wife, Barbara, and I were very fortunate to have gotten to know Professor Anscombe fairly well from the early 1980s until the early 1990s. We saw her once after that, at a meeting in Cambridge in 1997.\n\nWe first met Prof. Anscombe at the College of St. Thomas in Minnesota around 1980, where she gave a lecture. I became acquainted with her philosophically around this time at one or more Fellowship of Catholic Scholars’ annual meetings. We had a memorable visit at our home in Houston in the spring of 1982, when she met our four children and engaged in conversation with each of them. Prof. Anscombe was in Houston for the American Catholic Philosophical Association annual meeting at which she was awarded the Association’s Aquinas Medal, and where she presented her important paper on Action, Intention and ‘Double Effect.’\n\nBarbara and I got to know her better during a wonderful week in Rome in the Spring of 1986 at a conference on Catholic ethical issues—where she savaged a paper of mine dealing with the culpability required for grave sin (and seemed slightly abashed when, after the session, she was surrounded by a group of elderly clerical moralists, who said, in effect, that her refutation was not traditional). That is the meeting where Prof. Anscombe presented her provocative list of 20 opinions of Anglo-American philosophers which she believed incompatible with Christian faith. We were put up in the same hotel as Prof. Anscombe, and we enjoyed many meals and sightseeing outings, as well as a memorable visit to the Vatican that included an audience with Pope St. John Paul II.\n\nAfter we moved to Toronto she stopped there a number of times en route to Minnesota for family visits, and stayed with us twice. These proved to be memorable events in our family’s history.\n\nAs many of you know, there exists a treasure trove of usually hilarious Anscombe and Anscombe/Geach anecdotes. Her unconventional personality and philosophical greatness guarantee this. I suspect I have contributed a little to that treasure trove, and could do so again here,"
