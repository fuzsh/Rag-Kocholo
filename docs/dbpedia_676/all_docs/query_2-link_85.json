        "text": "WITTGENSTEIN AND LINGUISTICS\n\ncleaRenee Budge - Wittgenstein\n\nThe first I heard of Wittgenstein was in listening to the repeat of \"In Our Time\" one evening last week. I was held to the conversation from the beginning - not understanding much of what was said until the final sentences on language and thought. They struck a chord as I had come to dwell on that subject only a few days before. I entered \"Ludwig Wittgenstein\" in the Google search slot which came up with a superb 11 page account of his life, works and thoughts. I read through until I came to the part on Private Language and my thoughts on this are that it is possible for a devout person to have a private language with a personal deity. It is a heavenly language between lovers but is spoken in solitude and silence and cannot be spoken of. Teilhard de Chardin speaks of earthly loves as being \"little closed loves\". That is not to say that they are not beautiful but they cannot be compared with the Love in a co-existence with God.\n\nDavid Moss -- slammed on the website 2\n\nTo be fair (Neil Foxlee, below), Ayer did not say of Wittgenstein \"absolutely nothing has come out of his supposed greatness\", I did. It was a paraphrase. What Ayer said in 1985 was: \"Considering the strength of his personality and his total commitment to his own conception of philosophy, one might have expected Wittgenstein to found an important school of philosophers at Cambridge, operating to a greater or lesser extent in his own image ... I can think of no-one but Elizabeth Anscombe who has made an original contribution to philosophy on the basis of Wittgenstein's teaching\" (p.143). That is one thing which makes one ask why Wittgenstein is regarded as great. Plato's thought dominates every aspect of our lives 2,500 years after his death. That is greatness. In what does Wittgenstein's greatness lie? It cannot lie in the work of the Vienna Circle, every one of whose members has subsequently renounced logical positivism, and it certainly cannot lie in the jejune maunderings of JL Austin, as suggested by Mr Foxlee. So why is Wittgenstein regarded as great? I would seriously like to know. There are occasional glimpses of an answer. These moments are rare and need to be treasured. Marie McGinn was about to give us one of those glimpses -- I think, I cannot be sure, but I think she was -- when she was cut off. Of course Melvyn Bragg was respectful and reluctant (Steve Fox, below) when he cut her off. The rules of the In Our Time language game are enforced by him magnificently but in the heat of the game it is hard for the referee to get everything right and this time he got it wrong. He had assembled a strong team, he had orchestrated an enrgetic and flowing debate in which senses were heightened, he was bringing out the best in the speakers and then, just when he was about to achieve his elevated objective, a try under the goalposts, he stopped the game for some minor infringement and had a scrum. Would Ms McGinn have converted? I think she would and it is a great shame that now we shall never know and it will probably be another 20 years before we get the next glimpse of Wittgenstein's greatness.\n\nGraham Smetham - Wittgenstein\n\nI listened to the Wittgenstein discussion with amusement. I studied Wittgenstein 20 years ago when doing a Phd in philosophy of religion. It seems that after this elapse of time none of the salaried academic philosophers have made any progress in figuring out what Wittgenstein was on about. I heard all this stuff then and realized that few of the philosophers who speak about Wittgenstein really know what he was getting at. There is a kind of academic conspiracy to collude in granting W the accolade of being one of the greats without knowing why he is great. Perhaps it is because he seems impenetrable in much of his work. Why is he impenetrable? Because W himself was confused about what he was trying to get at. In the Red Book he clearly admits this: “My thinking, like everyones, has sticking to it the shrivelled remains of my earlier (withered) ideas.” “My account will be hard to follow: because it says something new but still has the eggshells from the old view sticking to it.” Somewhere else in the Red Book he says that only a few of his observations hit the mark. Most of them are like the ‘opening and shutting of a barber’s scissors between making actual cuts’. This obviously means that W himself thinks that much of his work is not going anywhere much! However there is one crucial observation in the Red Book which is not often, if at all, noticed that is absolutely crucial to understanding W: “…if someone makes false assumptions about the way language works and tries to give an account of something with language conceived of as functioning in this way, the result is not something false but nonsense.” What he is saying is that unless philosophers understand the functioning of language they simply talk nonsense. How true. But also true of W himself in many respects ( he still is contaminated with the eggshells of the old view). What does the notions of criss-crossing of similarities, family resemblances (Philosophical Investigations), concepts necessarily having blurred edges and not treating language as a scientific discourse (Blue Book) point to? Quite simply the view that language is metaphorical in nature and that to treat language as if it was derived from a logical realm of purity, as just about every Western philosopher I have ever read does, is to court producing nonsense, as most modern Western philosophers do. It is seldom noticed that similar problems of the interpenetration of description and reality can be found in the philosophical works of quantum theorists at the time, especially Bohr and Bohm. In fact the philosophical contest between Bohr and Einstein in many respects parallels the tension between W ‘s Tractatus position and his later works. Bohm’s work ‘Wholeness and the Implicate Order’ clearly indicates that quantum physicists are clearly up against similar issues of description as W was. In fact quantum physicists today still have the eggshells of classical physics sticking around in just the same way.\n\nRoni Hall re Wittgenstein\n\nHaving listened to this programme twice, my appetite is whetted. My background is mathematical but I am now looking around for courses in philosophy.\n\nIn our Time - Wittgenstein\n\nDear Melvyn I only caught the opening to your last edition of ‘In our Time’ and somewhat surprised myself by realising that I could follow much of what was being said and that a lot of the ideas expressed were familiar to me. I had to leave shortly after you interrupted the speakers saying you feared the audience would have been left behind, and so did not hear the end of the discussion. I must say I usually can’t follow the speakers on your program, or not for very long anyway. It would seem that most academics nowadays seem inclined to obfuscate for reasons best known to themselves. In my view of life when we start to look at our own experience and ask questions about it and try to understand, much of what philosophers have said becomes accessible to us. (This is different from saying I want to or am able to compete with the academics, or those who have read the books). It is a pity really that the level of the debate cannot be brought down a bit more to a level that is intelligible to the man in the street. It’s largely a question of the level of vocabulary that we chose to use, isn’t it? Obviously we do need to be careful in the choice of our terminology, but ideas can also be illustrated much of the time, even orally. I have to say I think philosophy is an important area of study to be talked about and brought into the public arena, especially these days when we are saturated with information, much of which is trivial, meaningless, blighted, wrong-headed even…I could go on.\n\nJulian Ray (Cambridge): Wittgenstein\n\nThank you for a fantastic program, one I have already played back from your excellent archives....twice! Keep up the good work Melvyn.\n\nRenee Budge - language & thought\n\nFollowing on from Wittgenstein's \"language develops thought\"- Teilhard de Chardin's \"noosphere\" - man's mind is a sort of new phylum in the process of evolution.\n\nIan Francis Wittgenstein\n\nThe world consists of two types of people: those who can listen to or tape the a.m. edition, and those who can't, and must listen to the abridged edition in the evening. The second are very envious of the first, and in their hearts hate them. This is a mistake, because, as my unintended experiments have shown, the abridged edition can sometimes be more enjoyable and instructive than the full monty. None of this detracts from the fact that we could do with more of this brain food. Nothing else approaches its excellence.\n\nDoggy thoughts and Wittgenstein\n\nIn thinking about the thoughts of dogs, we can ask the question how our own minds work. Sometimes we talk to ourselves 'I must get up' sometimes we visualise and rehearse our next action and sometimes we just feel it -without conscious thought. Do dogs work just on the feeling and visualisation levels I wonder? And another thought - Polanyi who did some deep thinking about the world and communication also started of in an engineering discipline before turning to philosophy - does such a start give a particular insight that both Polanyi and Wittgenstein have been able to express?\n\nm.a.cherian - WITTGENSTEIN\n\nWittgenstein was presented as one of the greatest 20th century thinkers. Russell a book about whom was titled 'The Philosopher of the Century' may not have agreed. Quine, another nominee for the title hardly mentions Wittgenstein. The doctrine of maya, which originated in Rg Veda (c.1500 BC) implies the picture-frame theory of meaning: as with a picture we make up what we want, theories circumscribed by conceptual schemes or frame-works also of our making. Hence to Madhyamika Buddhists all reference is self-reference. The hammer theory of meaning of the Philosophical Investigations goes way back: \"People argue about what are given, clear and relevant; and what the rules are to find out. What are given, clear and relevant are what are applied. They cannot be thought out beforehand. They are the rules\", (Asvaghosa, 1st c. AD Buddhist writer).\n\nscritch....wittgenstein\n\nI understand that it is an impossible task to cover both phases of Wittgenstein's ideas in 45 mins, but it would have been great to have heard something more of his later philosophy. 'Family-resemblance concepts' are not only a lesson for philosophers but also a metaphorical lesson for scientists who are all too often searching for universal principles where there may be none. This, with the idea that 'there is no causal nexus' are ideas with profound implications for how we approach scientific enquiry. Wittgenstein wished for a culture of thinking devoid of the language-led rigidity of explanatory-frameworks that have served to cloud our view of what is before us. 'Nothing is hidden.' 'Why don't we just leave explanation alone?' 'What we want is complete clarity.' Forgive me if these quotes are slightly different to the originals... but I'm sure there's a strong resemblance:-)\n\nAlex Gunn, Manchester University, The complication\n\nI have been studying philosophy for almost four years now & am still coming to terms with a lot of Wittgenstein's complex ideas. I sympathise with many of the points below but i think people need to remember that the panel were trying to explain some of the most complex philosophical ideas of our time, that philosophers have spent their lives trying to understand and interperate, in 45mins & in a way that anyone who hasn't studied it could understand. I think that did extremely well & I'm glad there was no attempt to over simplify as that would have lost the brilliance of Wittgenstein, thanks\n\nWittgenstein\n\nFascinating! Everyone has certainly said a mouthful! But I agree with Melvyn, there was a bit too much on offer. I would have suggested a whole series on different aspects starting with the historical biographical background. I came to philosophy via language, and it seems to me that, while early philosophers had every excuse to be ignorant of how language develops and of how perceptions and cultures are formed, it is a pity that philosophy is dominated by mathematicians who want to reduce everything to logic, which is of course incapable of distinguishing between Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries and so the only way out of the \"we are all part of the Red King's dream\" paradox is by way of the Cartesiean appeal to the experience of individual thinking (the cogito is not about the real world outside, but about the incoherence of thinking that one does not oneself exist) which gets you nowhere unless you happen to believe in a benificent God, as Descartes did. Whether dogs think is really a \"fly in a fly bottle\" question, it depends how you define \"think\". If you are in love, and unexpectedly catch sight of the beloved, you may do something, but have you really thought? If the dog barks excitedly when you say \"walkies\" but cowers if you say \"vet\", surely it understands some signs which translate into information? And all the evidence suggests that chimpanzees and some sort of primitive language, which indicate a practical response to those chimpanzees who are familiar with that particular range of sounds. People need to realise that all words that have not got a material subject (and even some that have, such as \"snow\") are culturally defined. If we had the compound eyes of bees how could we have a visual concept of a line? We would have to think of the motion to the nearest food source. It does not follow that there are no roses, or no gardens, it is simply that all animals have a limited perspective, which they may be able to extend by moving around or by some additional technology. And we have no knowledge of where the final limits may be, nor CAN we know. We just keep walking, in inventing words for vague perceptions and so extending our map of Life, the Universe, and Everything. AB\n\nWittengenstein\n\nWhat did Wittengstein contribute to humanity? From the three experts and 45 minutes of words, I did not get very much. Whilst it it is nice to see people tackle serious subjects on radio, what were they talking about? We all know that a recipe is not the same as a meal. Not a mention of the general strike, the great depression, Hitler or Mussolini,the world wars(in which Wittgenstein's brother had his arm blown off and still made a career as as a pianist) or other major real events going on whilst our great philosopher was pondering the nature of logic (using language). I'm afraid I agree with the sentinments of Karl Marx when he said something along the lines of \"Philosophers have interpreted the world in many different ways, the point is to change it\". Enough of these straw mountains to be demolished by the next clever philosopher, let's deal with the real world. Tony D'Arcy\n\nRenee Budge : Wittgenstein\n\nI am interested in Wittgenstein's concept of thought developing from language - if I have interpreted this correctly. I write to a friend on a certain subject and began taking copies of my writings. I read these over and over again until the next letter is produced reading it as before. I find that in this way my thoughts develop and I am a bit further along in my knowledge of the subject. e-mail:- teilhard@btopenworld.com\n\nted :wittgenstein and infinity\n\nAs with \"infinity\",much of philosophy seems to be an endless semantic exercise i.e the Wittgenstein debate was about the meaning of words,leading nowhere!\n\nRussell Kelly\n\nExcellent programme to do Ludwig in 45 minutes. Most of your commentators and, in a way, the programme itself overlook a key point. The 'Language' that LW writes about and that other philosophers are concerned with is the 'Language' of what we might call 'formal talk' - as in writing about Logic. This is substantively different to talking about 'everyday talking' - how people go about having a chat, gossiping, teaching, describing, and so forth. Even in the Investigations the 'practices' referred to are those of philosophers and others using 'formal lnaguage' - How can you know my mind and that I sense, feel, express precisely the same as you are doing so that we can exchange statements about these matters? This discussion needs to extend out to include Edmund Husserl, Alfred Schuetz, Harold Garfinkel and his colleague, Harvey Sacks.\n\nsteve fox Wittgenstein\n\nI've just 'listened again', and would like to say I think your discussion was a very good introduction to Wittgenstein. Also, since the question has arisen, that Melvyn's interruption of Maria McGinn's brilliant exposition was respectful, almost reluctant, and necessary to keep everyone on board. Wittgenstein wrote, 'if a lion could talk, we wouldn't understand him' (P.I. IIxi), and I have to say, I have often thought that about Wittgenstein himself. He seems like a very powerful microscope, trained onto his own thought processes. In choosing to focus on language itself, it seems to me that he is leaving be all ethics, morality, conflict, and even harmony, except insofar as all these represent multiple, tiny, logic events. He's a bit like a particle physicist of language, or a conceptual artist who blows up ordinary, everyday objects to several times their normal size, and we respond with exactly the same bewilderment to all these. This deliberate (or perhaps not) breaking down of normal perspectives is very exciting, maybe the origin of Ludwig's charisma, but it's also a profoundly risky business, and my feeling is that the dog that did not bark in the night was not Marxism, pace Ted Benton, but madness. For an amplification of his thought processes, which I found quite as gripping as his formal work, I recommend Culture and Value, ed. G.H. von Wright, published by Blackwell. It's a selection of Wittgenstein's notebooks and some lectures and other writing.\n\nMike Mian (Santa Clara CA USA): Wittgenstein\n\nAn excellent programme. Perhaps the ambiguity of language (or more fully the ambiguity of the symbolic representation of meaning) has its roots in the fundemental nature of the universe as encapsulated by Hiesenburg's uncertainty principle. That is there is a commutation operator between meaning and its symbolic representation, so that there is always a minimum level of ambiguity. If this were true would not Godel's incompleteness theorem be an expected result?\n\njackie hurman : Wittgenstein (numbers)\n\nI am surprised to think that numbers and what they are preoccupies philosophers. Am I too practical in thinking they are simple conceptual constructs and language tools to allow us to convey units of things to each other and now to computers? Any chance of a comment on this from Ray Marie or Barry? Great prog. Many thanks\n\nDavid Barchard\n\nAs a non-philosopher, I listened keenly to this programme with an open mind to see whether the criticisms of Wittgenstein made by Popper and Gellner were justified ---and how such charges can be levelled against a philosopher who, plainly, towered over his contemporaries. I ended it puzzled first over whether the Wittgensteinian fly is actually going anywhere when it does get out of the fly bottle and second at why Wittgenstein seems to be both attacking science and simultaneously causing us to tend towards enquiries which surely are empirical and scientific –e.g. do cats have intentions. I found his tendency to epigrams and mysticism simply disturbing. A further programme might explore the degree to which he contributed to postmodernism, cultural relativism etc. It was revealing to hear that the majority of analytical philosophers apparently take Russell’s side rather than Wittgenstein’s in the issues which divided them.\n\nKeith Jackson (Cockermouth U3A): Wittgenstein\n\nI am so grateful for the Thursday morning discussion on Wittgenstein - our Philosophy Group discussed Tractatus a few months back: although I was fascinated by the form and content of this work I reached a complete block in my comprehension Thanks to Barry Marie Ray and not least Melvyn (particularly for his elucidatory comments) I have broken through the barrier and have now reached stage two! What a catalogue of eulogies: a towering figure! the greatest philosopher of the modern age! the man who solved philosophy! Yes: I am a stage nearer to finding my way out of the bottle!\n\nJohn Stonborough - Wittgenstein\n\nThanks Melvyn for the programme about 'Uncle Ludwig'. Now when people or indeed my children ask me to explain my great-uncle's work, instead of scratching my head, I shall hand them the tape of you scratching yours.\n\nRichard Wells, Aberystwyth, Wales.\n\nI didn't hear all the program but Melvin Brag and the other contributors all seemed to fall into the trap of the cleverness of the past. In our time we all have or should have the knowledge and perspective to abandon the irrational thinking of the past, however convoluted and intellectually \"clever\" it may seem in it's atempts to satisfy irrational and unconnected ideas. Science and rationallity are essentialy about and of the real world. That is not to say we know everything , clearly not, but to invent irrationalities or to adopt them from the past, calling then philosophy is unforgivable. Many of the key discussions of the past had real meaning then and to some who still adopt the past way of thinking still do. They should however be re-interpreted in a rational language so as not to entrap yet new generations in the thinking of the past. This should be the responsibility of programmes such as this to do. My point can not be better illusteated briefly other than by refering to the subject of the next programme which I understand to be The Devil. There are no real Devils and never have been. They are a imaginary construct of man (and religions). That is not to say there are not those who were or are plagued by our their imagined devils. But now is the time to see these things for what they are, and say so simply. To repeat or re-interpret these errors is mischievous in the extreme whether done under the banner of \"History\" of Ideas or otherwise; unless and only unless we now state them to be clearly what they are - wrong - and then to give our best possible modern interpretations so that people have a \"good\" or \"better\" model to surplant the errors of the past.\n\ntony woodd - Wittgenstien\n\nThankyou radio 4 and melvyn enjoyed the programe but it occurs to me that philosophy is a process of concept/imagination and looking for the truth in that process can be likened to a dog chaseing it's own tail,especially if you consider that thought is limited by what it knows......\n\nmatt - Wittgenstein\n\nTremendous programme - well done Radio 4. Let's have more on Witgenstein and philosophy of mind more generally. I think it was an excellent attempt to succinctly put across some complex and stimulating stuff. I agree with a lot of the comments below and would like to see (or hear) more, perhaps a series which goes into some of the counter arguments more deeply. I felt the weakest answers, from the generally excellent panel, were around his legacy on philosophical thought and even cultural and linguistical studies. His links to Gramsci and that whole tradition (below) sound very interesting and I'd certainly listen to a programme that covered some of that ground. Especially as I encountered the two thinkers more or less at the same time, as I appraoched the end of, and had therefore become jaded by, my philosophy course. There's a quote I attribute to Wittgnestein about thinking we'd all be wiser to be plumbers rather than philosophers, trapped in mistaken language games - and we all know how prohpetic that's turned out to be. As the programme mentioned, I think he does have a strong connection to mystic, buddhist, shamanisitic knowledge of the un-explainable, as well as a link to later theories of 'meaning through use', and onto the subsequent development of studies around semiotic interpreations of text and multi-textuality. Wicked programme - bring it on!\n\nJuliette Leswell on Wittgenstein\n\nThank you, a very interesting programme. Norman Defoe's point about other languages - visual arts, music, etc., is well made. But we don't have a language that completely draws it all together. I don't think any of these languages quite gets us to the point where we can communicate, accurately and to everyone, the whole range of conceptions possible to the human mind. I think Melvyn called language 'the cloak of our thoughts'... a particularly apt word since it clothes them and yet also risks obscuring them. Most words have a sphere in which they operate and you can never be quite sure that you have pinned them down. They may also have to be only approximations of our real meaning. What I'd really like to know is what is that language that each one of us uses internally: what's 'thought'? How do we have ideas before we've found the words for them? What sort of stuff are those ideas made of? But I'm getting to the point where I can't say what I mean so I'd better do what Wittgenstein advises and be silent!\n\nDavid Brook: Wittgenstein\n\nThe only way I can understand Wittgenstein’s enormous prestige is in non-philosophical terms. His semi-aristocratic origins and gnomic utterances, his appearance and personality (staring eyes, middle-European name, cyclic and anal personality, withdrawal into northern isolation), are striking. He might have been the original mad genius. In addition he attached himself to and was sponsored by the immensely prestigious Russell. But as we heard, having assisted in legitimising Wittgenstein’s status, Russell’s criticisms were not sufficient to discredit him. In Cambridge W’s charisma was apparently such that undergraduates not only hung on his words but also imitated his gestures and dress. After he had been given a perfunctory doctoral viva by Russell and Moore, he said “you two didn’t understand a word of it”. When I try to engage with his propositions, I find few of them convincing, and many, including some of those discussed on today’s programme, easily disprovable by specific instances. I am interested in psycho- and socio-linguistics, and most of his dicta in this area both before and after his revision seem to me either naive or banal, separated as they are from any empirical evidence, apart from simple everyday experience. To suggest as a contributor this morning appeared to do that colour is an example of a simple idea flies in the face of a lot of quite old research showing how culturally loaded colours are. The famous dictum “What can be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent” is an illuminating instance. The first part is ironic in the light of his own writing (or is it a joke?), and the second is a tautologous truism. The emperor has feet of clay and no clothes, but the industry does not care to admit it.\n\nTom Castell\n\nInteresting programme. Alot of the content seemed to be similar to the concerns of Structuralism and Post Structuralism. For instance Derrida's maxim 'There is no outside of the text' (as opposed to the more commonly quoted translation 'There is nothing outside the text'). Would it be too much to ask that a discussion of this area be contemplated for a future edition? You might even be able to get the lad himself on. It would seem appropriate that a program claiming to be 'In our time' should cover an area which currently takes up quite a substantial part of the currrent University curriculum and has had a substantial impact on the humanities worlwide - for better or worse.\n\nMarc van Nes: Wittgenstein\n\nI enjoyed the depth of discussion and the way the subject stayed focussed on Wittgenstein and his dillema within the philosophy. I missed within the discussion the proves of Godel because they touch the same items in logic and mathematics. I want to add also the jump between senses or better sensors. Speach and language are bound to ears and we learn to read which then feeds the characters/words back from vision to hearing. This switching of senses is exactly what happened in the discussion of 'SHOWING' the relation between a person and its picture. But this can be an hour talk in itself. Thanks again. Marc van Nes\n\nJohn Critten Wittgenstein\n\nThe English language is a mature and flexible medium of expression, capable of conveying extremely complex and difficult notions. Why is it that Wittgenstein was unable to express himself, adequately, using English ? He was not a spin doctor seeking to obscure, but a philosopher, presumably, seeking to enlighten. As such, he must be ranked as one of the greatest failures of the 20th century.\n\nAlan Bartlam Wittgenstein\n\nIn outr time is yet another wonderful, thought provoking and highly informative offering from Melvyn Bragg - he has the wonderful ability to steer his experts into presenting essential understandings in straightforward language with excellent examples to help us grasp the material. This made it all the more noticeable that even the expert guests were unable to put much of what Wittgenstein said into ordinary words. Could this be because it has no real meaning? As a musician, I understand a critic once said of Dvorak's music, \"It sounds better than it really is\" - but everyone could hum the tunes! Perhaps with Wittgenstein there are no tunes to hum?\n\nDarren Cook, A General Comment\n\nI just wanted to type a message to say that I have Listen to this and the last series of In our time and they have been fantastic. It is great to have intelligent discussion of such a wide range of interesting subjects, this programme is worth the licence fee alone!! Is there any chance that Lord Bragg would consider a programme looking at the difference between the Biblical Jesus and the leading scholars Ideas about the 'real' Jesus?\n\nWittgenstein\n\nHow fantastic to have programmes that you can \"chew on\" in amongst so much disposable entertainment on TV and other radio stations. Best programme of the series so far.\n\nNeil Foxlee. Wittgenstein\n\nI am surprised that (unless I missed it)there was no reference to Wittgenstein's notion of language games, which is perhaps his most important contribution to modern thought. David Moss quotes Ayer below as saying that 'absolutely nothing has come out of his supposed greatness'. This ignores the early Wittgenstein's influence on the Vienna Circle and logical positivism (including the young Ayer himself), and the later Wittgenstein's influence on the linguistic philosophy of Austin, Searle and Grice. Indeed, Quentin Skinner, whose approach now dominates the history of ideas itself, cites Wittgenstein and Austin as major influences. It would be interesting to have a programme on the subject of the history of ideas as such, from Lovejoy to Foucault and Skinner. A brief list of recommended books/websites (eg the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy) for each programme would also be useful for those who wish to follow up the issues raised.\n\nPeter Cowlam - Wittgenstein\n\nIn his fiction ‘Funes the Memorious’, Borges invents a character called Funes, who suffers a blow to the head (and subsequent paralysis), and who returns to consciousness able to remember everything – for example the exact configuration of clouds at a particular time on a particular day. This leads Funes to devise ‘an original system of numbering’, which he does not write down, ‘since anything he… [thinks] of once would never be lost on him’. In his system he replaces the sign 7013 with the sign ‘Máximo Pérez’, 7014 with ‘The Railroad’, while other numbers are ‘Luis Melián Lafinur, Olimar, sulphur, the reins, the whale, the gas, the cauldron, Napoleon, Augistín de Vedia’ – whence Borges’s narrator points out that this ‘rhapsody of incoherent terms… [is] precisely the opposite of a system of numbers’ (Borges 1986: 92–93). One could assume that Borges has taken Saussure’s system of langue – which is the social aspect of speech, an aspect beyond the scope of any individual to create or modify it unilaterally (Saussure 1974: 14) – and asked what would happen if an individual does attempt to reinvent it. Saussure’s – or more correctly, our own – is a system of difference, or perhaps differentiation is a more accurate term, whereas Funes’s, at least where it applies an order of signification to the concept of number, is one of uniqueness. One cannot imagine that Funes’s system could ever give rise – rather like the Roman system of numbers – to anything more than a rudimentary mathematics. Wittgenstein, whose later thought offers certain parallels to that of Bakhtin, posits that the limits language operates in are social, and are to do with social discourse (according to which we would have to view Funes as exterior to social discourse). Wittgenstein lists some of those discourses (which he calls ‘language-games’) as: ‘Giving orders and obeying them – Describing the appearance of an object… – Constructing an object from a description… – Reporting an event…’ etc. (Wittgenstein 1963: 11). For Bakhtin, meaning, and langue, are not simply social, but are socially interactive (or ‘dialogic’), and ‘what is important for the speaker about a linguistic form is not that it is a stable and always self-equivalent signal, but that it is an always changeable and adaptable sign’ (Bakhtin 1994: 33) – though not to the extent that Funes adapts it. Lacan, seeking out deep structures in the human psyche, links the acquisition of language to the ’Symbolic Order’, which is bound up with our childhood and the point at which we are no longer ‘one’ with our mothers, a separation imposed on us by our fathers. Ergo the phallus, representing the Law of the Father, signifies separation and loss (loss or lack of the maternal body), which results in any desire we have for our mothers becoming repressed. What this repression functions as is evident in our newly acquired language (when we are children). Learning to say ‘I am’ and to distinguish that from ‘you are’ or ‘he is’ is equivalent to admitting that one has taken up an allotted place in the Symbolic Order, and relinquished the claim to the kind of position adopted by Funes. This is Lacan’s extended Cartesian dualism, where reason is no longer master in its own house, and is subject to the lures and slippages of language, a phenomenon ensnared in the toils of desire, in the endless defiles of the signifier. Thus for Descartes’ formula cogito, ergo sum Lacan substitutes his own: ‘cogito, ergo sum’ ubi cogito, ibi non sum, or ‘Where I think “I think, therefore I am”, that is where I am not’ (see Norris 1995: 453). Funes is where we are not.\n\njk . wittgenstein\n\nmelvin! never be afraid to ask your speakers to try and explain in laymans terms some of the complicated issues such as were raised in todays programme.I had a very poor education at failing secondry modern with no chance of futher education and started work at 14! and rely on people like you to represent us when the conversation gets difficult even for people with a univesity education.\n\nChris Rose - Wittgenstein programme- body left out\n\nWhere was the notion of embodied mind in this agonising dissection of notions of rationality? The operation of the senses, and the nature of our terms of reference as embodied beings, our linguistic references to the operational modes of sensation- of movement, action, touch etc, must surely figure in understanding our efforts at communication. Perhaps I missed it but without this dimension, philosophical debate appears sterile and of a past generation.\n\nclaudia\n\nI kind of agree [with several of the comments] - too much about Wittgenstein's general position/conclusions without enought exposition of specific arguments - E.g re. the anti private language argument: what makes Wittgenstein different [from the many others who basically agree with him on 'language before thought'rather than 'thought before language'] is that he sets out a clear analytic argument for the impossibility of systematic and developed internal linguistic systems... I think. So, this morning's programme was nice as a reminder of some general points, but not as insightful as I find most weeks...\n\nTED Benton Wittgenstein This is not from 'Disgusted, Colchester', as I am delighted the BBC still gives space to intelligent, stimulating public service broadcasting such as offered by your programme. My point is a more specific one about the discussion of Wittgenstein's philosophy today. In general the treatment of the early Wittgenstein was excellent and well contextualised by Ray Monk. However, the sudden shift from 1929 in W.'s philosophy was given no contextualisation or explanation. Moreover, the accounts of the content and significance of the later work were weak and in some respects just inaccurate. Why? My answer: Ray Monk was given time to mention the wealth and high cultural connections of the Wittgenstein family, but to similarly contextualise the later work would have necessitated uncomfortable mention of his sexuality and strong sympathy with the Soviet Union. Both of these fully covered in Ray Monk's excellent biography. Why is this relevant? because the most important influence on Wittgenstein's later work was his conversations with P. Sraffa, a cambridge Marxist philosopher, and friend of Gramsci. How do I know? Wittgenstein says so very clearly in the preface to the investigations. Why do so few people comment on this? Guess! Is this just an incidental fact? No. The whole reading of the ideas of language games and the private language argument become intelligible once you understand their place not in English analytical philosophy, but in post-Hegelian philosophy as mediated by the Italian Marxists. The recent book edited by Kitching and Pleasants (including an article by myself) and called Wittgenstein and Marxism (Routledge 2002) explores all this. This is not a crude attempt to display W. as a Marxist, but, rather, to point out the way in which well-known and centrally relevant but ideologically uncomfortable facts somehow disappear even in such a well-meaning progamme as your own.\n\nTerry Baker. Avoiding philosophical problems.\n\nIt seems to me that Russell’s comment that Wittgenstein had grown tired of doing philosophy is well placed. Having come to the conclusion that he (Wittgenstein) could not resolve complex issues such as the nature of the Self, what is morally good, why can this painting be said to be superior to that; he tried to duck out of even considering such questions as being part of the philosophical enquire. Just to have it both ways though, he said they were perhaps the most important questions. In the Tractatus, his escape hatch is to insist that language is purely descriptive, if a proposition is not about the way the world factually is, it is not a meaningful proposition. So morality, religion, aesthetics etc., cannot be put into meaningful propositions and discussed. In the Investigations, having realised that that would not work, he decided that all language is about public, social and communal interaction. Private emotions, beliefs, feelings and attitudes are just that: private and not public. Therefore they cannot be talked about using language. That way, all discussions about morality, religion, aesthetics etc., though not (but not of course) unimportant, are not things that can properly be discussed using public language. He was wrong on both counts. If he had put it that simply, no one would have listened, So he did not put it simply, and it sounded profound – but not to Russell.\n\nbarbara jones - Wittgenstein\n\nlways stimulating, together with Start the Week, my only must listens but - an assumption was made that children learn language from those around them. That thought before language is inexpressible? I believe that the child learns the sound of language from the womb. I remember, as a very small child having complex thoughts regarding what was happening around me, interpreting to myself, what was happening in the form of language but being completely unable to express those complex thoughts in words. They were not emotions, but words. Not enough research is being made in the direction of exactly what the very young actually understand. At two years I watched my sister being fitted out in her new school uniform. I knew the person (my mother) who was criticising the uniform was both proud of having bought it and yet did not want my sister to enjoy the moment. I was aware that the colours deep plum red with a black and white girdle, did not feel right together, but I also knew I could not 'say' what I knew. Presume the speaking apparatus was not up to the complex thoughts. So it is on an 'assumption' that some of the thoughts being expressed, regarding words, were made. Can you do this in philosophy? If so, then all philosophy must be suspect.\n\nnorman defoe wittgenstein\n\nWhen people speak of language they seem to consider only written and spoken language which uses words. There is a visual language which uses colour and tone and is used by artists and designers, a musical language using musical notation and used by composers and instrumentalists and a mathematical language used to describe, well you tell me! All of these are necessary to communicate what 'word language' cannot. There are no word-image equvalents of music, visual imagery, or mathematical concepts. Yet everything that these other languages describe exists and experience of them can be communicated if you speak the language.\n\nCaroline Lyon on Wittgenstein\n\nWittgenstein seems to have anticipated one of the two approaches to automated natural language processing. His injunction: \"Don't think but look! ...\" nicely encapsulates the empirical, corpus based paradigm which has been so profitable in practical applications. It contrasts with the rationalist approach, expressed in a somewhat extreme form by Chomsky \"Knowledge of language involves in the first place knowledge of grammar - language is a derivative and perhaps not very interesting concept\" (1980) though Chomsky is also a big enough thinker to move on. In many practical applications components of both approaches have to be integrated. What a good surprise to hear this program as I sat disconsolately in my car on a Thursday morning.\n\nDavid Moss -- slammed on the website\n\nYour speakers were marvellous and please consider yourself \"slammed on the website\" for cutting off Marie McGinn. A number of intelligent people think Wittgenstein was important. As they try to explain why, the same note always enters their voice, a note of apology. They apologise that it is so hard to say why he was important or, indeed, to say what he was saying. Their answers are always pained, the words are dragged out with difficulty against some nearly overwhelming force. It seems that people don't so much understand Wittgenstein as respond to him. AJ Ayer was an exception to this trend. In his 1985 book on Wittgenstein, Ayer with his customary clarity and humour rehearses a number of Wittgenstein's arguments and disagrees with every one of them. He goes on to point out that most of Wittgenstein's acolytes during his lifetime were bullied and demeaned by the supposedly great man. Ayer assesses Wittgenstein's contribution to philosophy and concludes that absolutely nothing has come out of his supposed greatness. (Given what has gone before in the book, Ayer perversely ends by saying that Wittgenstein was one of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century. This may have been a joke.) What was Wittgenstein saying, particularly in the Philosophical Investigations? Give him any difficult question and his answer was always \"er ... well, it's very hard to say, really\". We are not impressed in the Saloon Bar if someone says \"I may not know much about art but I know what I like\". Why is this response regarded with so much awe when it is uttered by Wittgenstein? Does this emperor have any clothes? Wittgenstein's private languages argument is always taken to be very important. It proves ... anything you want it to prove. Do other minds exist? Yes, they must do, thanks to the private languages argument. Can you know that historical events which you did not attend took place? Yes, of course you can, thanks to the private languages argument. Replace \"private languages ar-gument\" with \"snake oil\" and then try those sentences again. I put it to you that Wittgenstein found newish ways to describe old problems and newish ways to say why he couldn't solve them. His work is an apologia for all those who find they are stumped when they try to justify their beliefs. Wittgenstein does not absolve philosophers or anyone else from trying to explain their thoughts. Our duty is to continue to try to explain ourselves, lucidly and accessibly as though to a jury.\n\nadam jones - flawed but excellent\n\ni think todays programme was a good example of what might be the 'point' of In Our Time - to motivate one to continue the discussion afterwards In One's Own Time. Personally i have been motivated to learn more about Wittgenstein from this mornings programme, on one hand, by being intoduced to such a fascinating topic and given points of reference from which to continue the discussion, such as his relationship with Bertrand Russell and his Tractatus. And on the other hand due to the number of unanswered questions and lack of clarity and depth within the programme - a symptom no doubt of tackling 1 person's life's work with 3 experts and only 45 minutes. All in all a flawed yet excellent programme. Thankyou Radio 4 and Melvyn Bragg\n\nGreg Spencer - only \"a bit\" parochial?\n\nPeter Davies' point that British philosophers tend to domesticate Wittgenstein as one of their own is well made... and arguably reflects something Wittgenstein wrote about at length: our all too human \"drive towards self-bewitchment\". Contrast this with certain readings of Wittgenstein in the United States in which he is placed in a \"perfectionist\" tradition exemplified by Plato, Emerson and Thoreau. Start with Cavell and a programme on Wittgenstein, whilst taking in Austin and the limits of language, might talk also of transfigured commitment and expressive power - More Rousseau than Russell.\n\nDon Bird...Wittgenstein\n\nPresently studying for a masters degree in Philosophy I am as ever still mystified by The fact that some philosophers are unable to present their material comprehensibly. When philosophers speak to philosophers is one thing, but when speaking to non-philosophers is another. These things are not so difficult as they are made to seem, but still the message is submerged under unfamiliar and awkward verbiage. Some philosophers are able to make their ideas crystal clear in writing and in speaking but others are just sheer hard work.\n\nAnthony Deane. Language\n\nAs this is my first contribution to this page, first of all, may I say how much I enjoy listening every week to this programme. May I thank Melvyn Bragg for his presentational skills - which are excellent -all the contributors, and the producers of the programme. For me, along with 'Start the Week', it is the 'jewel in the crown' of my listening - and viewing - week. I also love reading all the contributions to this page, which go well beyond my own paltry level of articulation. Is not language and its roots and significance, ultimately unfathomable? which I assume was what Wittgenstein in his 'Tractatus' was attempting to point out. We can continually refine language with each succeeding generation, with our search for truth, our gathering of knowledge and our changes to the material world, but the ultimate truth may be unknowable. Like 'God' the truth of language remains at the level of concepts - however sophisticated these become, and therefore a mystery. In searching and postulating 'truth', in both cases, silence seems perhaps the best answer. However, as so many enjoy the speculative process, which in itself might provide a positive contribution to the history of human thought, there will never, and perhaps should not be, silence. We always assume that 'language' is the speciality of humans, and I suppose, in terms of complexity we can safely assume this to be true. When we talk of language are we talking about communication?. Might not other species have primitive forms of communication?, of language?. Do we judge language by its complexity? and dismiss the grunts, barks and twitterings etc, of other species as irrelevant?. Surely, just because we humans cannot understand or interprete these 'noises' should not mean they are therfore unimportant in these matters. Is there any research going on in this area?.\n\nPeter Davies - a bit parochial\n\nExcellent programme, tackling difficult ideas. The problem is that British philosophers tend to claim Wittgenstein as one of them and think of him in the context of Russell and logical positivism. He's not - he brought a lot of his Austrian cultural context with him. If you look at him in this way, the Tractatus can be seen in part as a philosophical response to a cultural preoccupation with the limits of language, whether in cultural thinking (Fritz Mauthner) or literature (Kafka, Hugo von Hofmannsthal and plenty of others): can language refer to anything outside itself? One of your contributors dismissed the idea that there was anything mystical about Wittgenstein. This is also not true: there was at the turn of the century a revival of interest in German medieval mystics like Meister Eckhart, who worried about the limits of language, as well as in non-Christian mystical traditions. The Tractatus uses this language in its arguments. A last point: Wittgenstein wrote very clear, everyday German to express complex ideas, and he's not well served by all these 'whereofs' and 'thereofs' in the translations.\n\nRoland Deakin...Wittgenstein\n\nIf Wittgenstein wanted to help the fly to find a way out of the bottle it would have been helpful if the program could have analysed what he thought the bottle represented! Although the program was gripping it was very dense. I think Melvyn was aware of this too, though generally he is very good at getting speakers to explain what they mean in plain english. Today there was too much use of philosophical shorthand for me to follow the train of thought adequately. As ever, I enjoyed the discussion but I felt at the end of the program that it was inadequate for the speakers to assert that Wittgenstein's insights have had an impact on all our lives without giving examples of why they thought this.\n\nPeter Debrou - Wittgenstein\n\nHow does Melvyn do it?...so much from such a difficult concept in so little time? As a result of the earlier program on infinity I had come to the conclusion that the difficulty was not proving things, since after all, the world works doesn't it? It doesn't need to be proven. It, like infinity, just is. It is our struggle with describing, defining and conveying our thoughts between each other that is a large part of the problem i.e. the limitations in language and mathematics in expressing things. The perfect circle doesn't exist, it is a creation of man. We define it using language (without which the circle wouldn't exist) and then tear our hair out trying to define the smallest element of its circumference (which perversely, turns out to be a straight line). And this idea of concept being limited by language came to the fore in today's program in that logic - as defined by us - is a construct of language, which then throws up the anomolies which Bertrand Russell struggled with. Well, logic IS, we know that, just as the world is. It works (because the world works), it is we who are attempting to define and understand it. The failing is in the ability of our language (including numbers and mathematics, which are inventions by us) to be able to accommodate it properly. We are able to perceive concepts in our mind but are forced to constrain them, to whatever small degree, when we have to depict them on paper or convey them verbally. Yet another potential subject for In Our Time - the difference between what we can perceive and conceive in our minds and what we are able to represent and convey faithfully to fellow human beings. Peter\n\nChris O'Loughlin re Wittgenstein\n\nAn interesting program, confirming for me that Wittgenstein probably said something very important but no-one quite knows what it is ! (and perhaps he would have wanted it like that)\n\nmike allderidge@yahoo.co.uk-Wittgenstein.\n\nGood programme but would have benifited from some background on his philosophical development ,espescially the influence of Idealism and Schopenhauer in particular.\n\nTony Hall. Wittgenstein\n\nSemiotics and Wittgenstein The discussion based around Wittgenstein and philosophy reminded me of the work that was being developed in semiotics, the study of signs, in this same period of time. Ferdinand de Saussure was a key figure here, Saussure’s simple idea that the meaning of a word is to be understood through its relation to other words. Maybe a programme on Semiotics and the Everyday could be interesting.\n\nAlex Tough : Wittgenstein\n\nAll that discussion about language and no mention that Wittgenstein was dyslexic !\n\njohn murphy Wittgenstein\n\nVery enjoyable discussion. Ray Monk was excellent in getting over some very difficult concepts and ideas.Some of the Tractatus reads just like poetry and I supppose I would have liked to see if some literary connections could have been made. Lets have another proggramme on this.\n\nRobin Allott Wittgenstein\n\nI found this morning's discussion of Wittgenstein interesting, particularly since I presented a paper earler this year at the Linguistic Association of Canada and the United States on \"Language as a Mirror of the World: Reconciling picture theory and language games\". The paper can be seen on the University of Southampton cogprints site. For convenience I attach the abstract here: Wittgenstein in the Tractatus focussed on a picture theory of language. He was clear that this meant that language mirrored reality, mirrored the world. The picture theory was an account in essence of the relation between a word and what it referred to in the external environment, or between a sentence, a proposition or sachverhalt and the event or situation to which it referred. The Tractatus was completed in 1919 and published in 1922. Within the space of 11 years after its publication Wittgenstein had abandoned the picture theory and, in the Blue Book and the Brown Book, sketched out a quite different account of language as a congeries of language games, and different languages as different sets of language games; words were given their meanings by use, by explanation, by training and essentially by social interaction. This changed account took its definitive form in the Philosophical Investigations, posthumously published in 1954. Wittgenstein did not wholly abandon the Tractatus and would have liked the Tractatus and his later writings to be published together, though this was never done before his early death. There is a problem how he could have presented two such different accounts of language with equal conviction. Can they be reconciled? The examination in much greater depth of both may solve the problem. Since the Tractatus and the Philosophical Investigations, there have been massive advances in different but equally relevant fields: in linguistics, in neurology, in philosophical discussion, in evolutionary theory, in psychology, in child development. Most recently and relevantly, there has been the discovery of mirror neurons (Rizzolatti & Arbib 1998), neurons which are excited by the perception of action and which seem to constitute the precursors of motor programs to reproduce the perceived action, that is, a plausible basis for imitation and communication. There has also been great progress in the study of the active brain in the production of speech, using fMRI, PET, ERP, MEG and there are new ideas on the motor basis of speech production and speech perception, on the relation of speech and gesture, on visual and auditory perception. The paper will suggest that in the light of all these developments Wittgenstein's two accounts of language can be reconciled within a larger framework, and the philosophy and science of language can profitably be linked with each other.\n\nMarjorie Riley. Wittgenstein and Philosophy\n\nWell done Radio 4, Melvyn Bragg and team. That's a tough subject, and I feel you made a fascinating mind-stretcher of it. The technique of presenting the biography first and then the ideas helped those of us who are usually adrift in the realmof philosophy.\n\nJude Daling\n\nDear Mr Bragg You mentioned in a recent newsletter that it might be an idea to have a follow-up programme re the subject of 'Duty' (great idea, and let us all contribute to a 'Bill of Duties' to accompany the European 'Bill of Rights'). How about follow-up programmes to a few others, too -- let listeners choose their favourite 3 or 4 over the last two years, and I will keep fingers crossed that it will include what I think was the very best of your programmes, Human Nature, with John Gray, Steven Pinker and Janet Radcliffe Richards (Nov 2002). This further discussion of human nature might satisfy Andrew Moran who asked on the website after last week's discussion of the St Bartholomew Massace: 'Is a violent intolerance of beliefs other than ones own an unmodifiable part of the human psyche?'\n\ng.j.spencer - Alternative Wittgensteins\n\nIt strikes me that this programme starts from a false premise: that some sort of basic consensus exists about what Wittgenstein was \"about\". This programme seemed to me to be about P M S Hacker's Wittgenstein... which is perhaps all very well if introduced as such... with suitable caveats. Perhaps the balance could be restored by a programme focussing on theraputic readings of Wittgenstein... as developed, amongst others, by G E M Anscombe, Rush Rhees, Stanley Cavell, John McDowell, James Conant, and Cora Diamond... Such a programme might explore, say, the continuities in Wittgenstein's thinking between the Tractacus and the Philosophical Investigations...\n\nWittgenstein\n\nIt's all very well to try to do these things on air and quickly but... it would be better for dim-wits(like me)if the program was LONGER.A full hour? Yes please! I've recorded the program on TiVo and can re-listen ad-infinitum, but more time = more discussion/explanation of ideas. Well done, keep up the good work.\n\nAndrew Burrell - Wittgenstien\n\nJust to say thank you for this programme, I am doing an MA Phil of Religion at Heythrop College and one of my modules is on Wittgenstein. The panel's comments were incredibly helpful and I would LOVE a copy of the script. What a shame that we heard so little about the 'fly in the bottle' just when we were getting to some of the fundamental questions we came to an end! Once again thank you. And is there a way of getting a copy of the show on CD etc?\n\nSu Martin ---- Wiggtenstein.\n\nI think Mr Bragg was quite right to stop the female speaker and appeal for explanations. I loathe 'dumbing down' but there are times a general audience need thinks breaking down a little. I enjoyed the programme but I think I'll have to listen to it again to get some of the points made clear in my head! I read Wiggentstein's poker so are we going to get a show on Karl Popper\n\nWittgenstein (9am edition) Have fun editing these 45 mins down 30 mins for tonight's edition. My thoughts and prayers will be with you. Patrick"
