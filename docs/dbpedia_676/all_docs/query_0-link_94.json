In this timeline of women philosophers, we take a look at some of the most renowned women thinkers, individuals whose inventive ideas and unconventional theories have changed the way we think about ourselves and the world. ### About This timeline was made using [**ChronoFlo Timeline Maker**](/), a free online service for producing interactive timelines that can be shared on the web. Information for the timeline was compiled from [**Wikipedia**](https://www.wikipedia.org) data. Particular use was made of Wikipedia's List of women's philosophers [**page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_women_philosophers). Where Wikipedia did not list a person's date of birth, we undertook research to estimate their birth date. People whose births we estimated include the ~ character before the date. Certain philosophers - who our research deemed to be the most influential - have been highlighted with brighter pink panels. ### Credits Design: [**ChronoFlo Timeline Maker**](/) Information: [**Wikipedia**](https://www.wikipedia.org) Images: [**WikiMedia Commons**](https://commons.wikimedia.org)\n\nBan Zhao\n\nBan Zhao, courtesy name Huiban, was a Chinese historian, philosopher, and politician.
