        "text": "Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe, the Catholic philosopher whose work on subjects from Aristotelian ethics to the perils of birth control is enjoying a renaissance, died 10 years ago this week in England, at 81. And obituary writers remembered what she wore.\n\nThe Telegraph wrote, “Clad in leopard-skin trousers and a leather jacket, she might sit in silence for minutes on end, puffing on a cigar, after one of her students had finished reading out an essay.”\n\nAnd The Guardian : “For a time she sported a monocle, and had a trick of raising her eyebrows and letting it fall on her ample bosom, which somehow made her yet more daunting.”\n\nMiss Anscombe  the married mother of seven preferred “Miss” and was known by her initials, G.E.M., or as Elizabeth  may have been an independent-minded dresser. But it was her fearless thinking that made her, some say, the greatest postwar English philosopher, and the greatest female philosopher ever (a superlative she would loathe). Her philosophy continues to pack the halls at conferences. Her uncompromising Christian writing is why collegians name clubs after her.\n\nHer views, however, are inseparable from her biography.\n\nMiss Anscombe was born in 1919 and was a teenage convert to Roman Catholicism. As an Oxford student, she befriended Iris Murdoch, Philippa Foot and Mary Midgley  all future philosophy greats. (Ms. Midgley has written that with young men off at war, women finally got attention.)\n\nMiss Anscombe married Peter Geach, another Catholic convert, and was hired at Oxford; later in her career, she moved to Cambridge. Mr. Geach taught philosophy at less prestigious schools, first Birmingham and then Leeds; the “Geachcombes,” as some called them, may have had one of the first academic commuter marriages.\n\n(He commuted.)\n\nAs a young philosopher, Miss Anscombe traveled regularly to Cambridge to hear the lectures of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the great Austrian philosopher. She became a disciple, then one of his literary executors. She learned German and in 1953 translated his “Philosophical Investigations.” After Wittgenstein himself, she is most responsible for his fame in the English-speaking world.\n\nIn 1956, Miss Anscombe riled colleagues by arguing that Oxford should not award an honorary degree to former President Harry S. Truman, whom she considered a mass murderer. Her pamphlet “Mr. Truman’s Degree”  a readable, powerful antiwar tract  helped introduce Catholic theories of just and unjust war to mainstream philosophy.\n\n(Truman got his degree.)\n\nThe next year, she published “Intention,” which one philosopher called the greatest work on the philosophy of action  a sub-field concerned with how our brains cause our bodies to do things  since Aristotle.\n\nBut the family of Anscombe followers keeps growing.\n\nThe University of Chicago philosopher Candace Vogler says that when she read “Intention” in graduate school, the book was out of print, so they had to rely on photocopies.\n\n“But as of about the last five years, people are acting as if she’s this new, important philosopher,” Professor Vogler said. Since 2007, there have been Anscombe conferences in Rome; in Uppsala, Sweden; in Princeton, N.J.; and in Chicago.\n\n“We had room for 150 people, and we had people sitting outside the doors,” Professor Vogler said of the 2008 Chicago conference, which she organized. “People with no financial support to do so were flying in from places like Australia and Switzerland. That is suggestive of a huge groundswell of interest in her, that she is the next big thing.”\n\nPhilosophers are primarily interested in Miss Anscombe’s action theory. But Professor Vogler says that a true appreciation of her includes the religious writing.\n\nAn Anscombe strength is that “when she is writing for that Catholic audience, she presumes they share certain fundamental beliefs,” but she is equally willing to write for people who do not share her assumptions, Professor Vogler said.\n\n“For the general philosopher, she is like, ‘Look, by general agreement we’re atheists.’ And that is for the most part true.”\n\nAt Princeton, 30 students have joined the Anscombe Society, which promotes traditional sexual morality. Shivani Radhakrishnan, last semester’s president, also admires Miss Anscombe’s ability to reach the irreligious.\n\n“A good way to think about sexual ethics is to do so without, say, presupposing the existence of God,” Ms. Radhakrishnan said. “And some of us have spent time reading her article ‘Modern Moral Philosophy’ or ‘Contraception and Chastity.’ ”\n\nCassandra L. Hough, who founded the Anscombe Society while at Princeton in 2005, now runs the Love and Fidelity Network, which supports students at 33 campuses who run similar groups or are trying to start them.\n\n“Many of our students have read Anscombe’s work,” Ms. Hough said in an e-mail. “There is no doubt that she speaks to anyone who wants to seriously consider the questions she addresses, be they Catholic or not.”"
