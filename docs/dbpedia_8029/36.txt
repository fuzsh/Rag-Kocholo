Reviews

'This sombre and distinguished book is as fine a piece of storytelling as you are likely to read this year.' The Guardian

'Mal Peet, who won the Branford Boase Award in 2004 for Keeper, has written a complex and rewarding novel which is two stories in one. Peet moves effortlessly and skilfully between the 1940s and the present and the characters are strong and well-drawn. Terrific stuff.' TES Teacher

'This is an outstanding novel. Outstanding in every regard. It establishes Peet as a novelist of immense gift and versatility, for no two novels could be more different than Keeper and Tamar and yet be so equally brilliant ... Utterly convincing.' www.achuka.co.uk

'… one of the very best novels I have encountered in recent years.' INIS

'"A fascinating and complex story, set against the backdrop of the Nazi occupation of Holland. Beautifully crafted, with a finale that took my breath away, this is simply unforgettable."' Publishing News
