        "text": "Though I’ve never really been into what’s popular, I’m not the only one who’s become annoyed or tired with the following recent trends in writing and books. This includes unpublished books as well as published ones.\n\n1. Headless and partial body covers. Seriously, if you’re going to show a model who’s supposed to be a character, why can’t you show the entire body? It looks weird and creepy to see someone missing a head, just a torso, part of the face cut off, or only from the waist down.\n\n2. Cover models in general. Whatever happened to using artwork for a cover? And if you’re going to use characters on the cover, it’s nice to show them as part of a larger scene from the book, not some generic closeup. That doesn’t really tell me anything about the story or set the mood.\n\n3. Girls in big poofy dresses on covers.\n\n4. One-word titles. Sometimes it works, but more often than not it just seems like following a trend. More often than not it doesn’t even tell much about the actual story. A one-word title could suggest anything.\n\n5. Dual or alternating narrators or POV characters. Do you really not know how to write third-person omniscient? It just seems faddish and gimmicky after it’s been done so many times, more often than not without a compelling reason.\n\n6. Ending on a cliffhanger setting things up for the sequel or next book in the series/trilogy. This isn’t a tv show, soap opera, or old movie serial where you can tune in the next day or week to find out what happened. You usually have to wait at least a year for the next book these days. Even in a series, each book should have its own set of storylines that should be wrapped up by the end. A lot of these books read like they wanted to be sagas but were artificially split up.\n\n7. Trilogies in general. I think the best series and trilogies were deliberately planned that way. These days, it seems like a lot of trilogies and series weren’t planned. Not all storylines work stretched out over so many books. It’s the same deal with how so many movies these days are sequels, trilogies, and half-sequels. Some ideas work best in just one book or movie.\n\n8. Books that are short just for the sake of being short. Whatever happened to the days when writers just wrote a story at the length that naturally unfolded, instead of pre-planning it around some arbitrary “word count”? I care less about how long or short my books are, and just write at the length that organically evolves. So many of these 288-page books these days seem so insubstantial, not enough character or plot development.\n\n9. The explosion of first-person narration as some kind of default. It’s really hard to do first-person well. It just feels like a false intimacy, now that it’s so common. All these narrators start to run together after awhile, since the voice isn’t really distinctive. In YA in particular, I see a lot of narrators who come across like Holden Caulfield imitators, without the fresh originality of Holden’s snark and wit. Oh, and if there are any kind of high stakes, it basically removes all suspense as to whether the narrator will survive. If the narrator died, who is this “I” telling the story?\n\n10. The unreliable narrator. This goes along with #9. When a book is third-person, we have more objective distance, instead of having everything filtered through a person who might not be so honest or self-reflective. I just don’t see the appeal of this. Why should I want to spend an entire book with a liar or someone I can’t trust? It’s no longer as original as it was before every other writer jumped on it.\n\n11. First-person present tense! I’ve really reached a point where I sincerely wonder if so many writers, esp. of YA, are only using this tense/POV combo because they don’t have any examples of anything else, and so feel it’s the modern, expected way to write. Um, do you realize you can use past tense, third-person, or present tense with third-person? Present tense works best in a story with high stakes, putting the reader right in the moment, like a constantly unfolding movie. Which sounds better, “I get on the schoolbus and smile at my crush” or “Sakura staggers towards the river as the maimed, dying bomb victims grope at her and scream for water”?\n\n12. Names or nicknames that are supposed to be quirky or cutting-edge but just sound silly, cheesy, soap opera-esque, or trendy. Even worse is when the character has a perfectly lovely given name but goes by some daft nickname.\n\n13. Last but not least, instalove needs to go far, far away. Even if that’s how the typical teen mind operates, it doesn’t make for a very riveting story. There’s no tension to make it believable.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOne of the current trends I personally don’t see the appeal of is dual/alternating narrators or POV characters. I only saw this rarely while I was growing up, and when it was used, it was for a carefully-considered reason. Now it just seems like it’s chosen to go along with a misguided trend and/or because the writers truly don’t understand how to write third-person omniscient.\n\nI tend to write books with very large casts, from main characters, to important secondary characters, to supporting characters. I don’t have a problem with slipping into many characters’ heads over the course of a story. But there’s a big difference between following many stories that are woven together, and bopping around between 2, 4, 6, even 8 characters, one chapter at a time. That feels really disjointed, not cohesive.\n\nI think two narrators or POVs works best for a book in non-linear format. For example, a book that’s being told as a flashback by a first-person narrator, with a few wraparound segments and an epilogue in third-person (e.g., Annie on My Mind). Or a book that involves someone in the present trying to solve a mystery from the past, and there are 50-100 pages at a time in the POV of the character from each era (e.g., Mal Peet’s Tamar, which is third-person omniscient in 1944-45 and first-person in 1995). That doesn’t involve constantly being jerked back and forth between characters.\n\nIn so many of these dual narrators/POV characters books I’ve read (or tried to read) lately, I can’t even distinguish who’s who. Other reviewers have also mentioned often having to flip back to the beginning of a chapter to remind themselves of who’s narrating. First-person is tricky enough to do well, despite the modern belief that it’s somehow easier, but for multiple narrators, you really have to nail the voice for each of them. Each needs a distinct voice. You can’t just substitute I, me, and my for third-person pronouns.\n\nWhen everyone and everything is woven together through third-person omniscient, you don’t have to break up the narrative flow by only being with one character or storyline at a time. You can slip back and forth within a chapter or scene, and can even get into the heads of different people. This feels deeply personal for me, not impersonal and old-fashioned. It feels more impersonal to only focus on one character at a time.\n\nIf you have more than one important character, it feels obvious you should use third-person omniscient. Writers a few decades ago wouldn’t have bopped back and forth between double-protagonists, one chapter at a time. They’d spend some time with one, then another, within the same scene or chapter. I won’t name names, but I’m aware of at least one book in this current trend that has some ridiculously short chapters. Since when is one sodding line considered a proper, complete chapter?! God forbid you have told the story in third-person.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned, I thought it was just ridiculous how Andy Mulligan’s Trash bopped around between EIGHT first-person narrators, with a few of the final chapters bopping around between 3-4 narrators. A couple of these people only narrated one chapter each. I already forgot who Grace was the very day I read the book! This was so clearly a book that should’ve been third-person omniscient, with so many important characters.\n\nBut no, it could only be split up EIGHT ways, among narrators who essentially all sounded exactly the same. What was so wrong with choosing just ONE narrator and sticking with him, or doing third-person omniscient to include all these diverse characters? The story felt so fragmented. I felt the same sense of disconnect with books like Bright Young Things and Vixen. We’re missing so much of the story by only being in one character’s head at a time.\n\nJust imagine how silly a sweeping saga like War and Peace or Exodus would feel if each chapter kicked off with a line like “Hey, it’s Pierre’s turn!” “Now it’s Kitty!” “Time to talk with Prince Andrey!” “I’m handing it over to Jordana now.” “Ari again!” “Still Karen!” “This is Princess Mariya.” “I’ll hand it over to Natasha now.” It’s annoying and seems immature, like the writer truly didn’t know how to write a cohesive story with multiple viewpoints without constantly breaking up the flow.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI’m an anti-fan of this current trend of “updating” classic youth literature. I really don’t get why some industry people are so convinced modern youth won’t like or relate to a book that’s more than 10 years old unless it has modern artwork and a slew of hyper-current references. If some teens or children truly feel that way, there was a huge failure somewhere along the line.\n\nIf you’re picking up a book that was first published when your parents, grandparents, or even great-grandparents were your age, chances are you expect it won’t always have the most current references or writing style. Revamping the cover and illustrations to look modern takes away much of the charm of the original. A lot of these “updated” covers and illustrations I’ve seen for old children’s books are actually quite ugly or weird.\n\nWhen I was a child and preteen reading older books, I didn’t care if there were references or topical content that went over my head. I probably just thought, “Oh, this was published 10-20 years ago. No wonder it’s talking about old tv shows or singers.” Since when does the relatability of a book hinge solely on whether the reader knows all the tv shows, celebrities, bands, commercials, or current events referenced? Odds are, that’s not what the deeper storyline is about!\n\nI’m very displeased with the decision to “update” books from my generation, like the Babysitters’ Club books, the Sweet Valley High series, and some of Judy Blume’s books. Those books came out in a certain era. It’s intellectually dishonest to “update” them to pretend they’re contemporary. Yes, many once-contemporary books do date quickly because of too many period references, but that’s part of their charm. They should be read as products of their time, as part of a larger cultural and historical context.\n\nIt feels so wrong to read about how Peter’s Christmas list in Superfudge went from having true 1980 items like records and a pocket calculator to an MP3 player, a laptop, and CDs. They also changed some of Fudge’s favorite shows, since God forbid kids today not know what The Electric Company and The Muppet Show were. Why the freaking hell did anyone think this modern classic needed “modernizing”? It’s not the same book anymore. It’s a book from 1980 suddenly pretending to be a product of the 21st century.\n\nOf course, the entire premise of The Babysitters’ Club doesn’t really work in the 21st century, on so many levels. Outside of maybe a really insular, small town, what parent these days would seriously trust a 13- or 11-year-old to babysit his or her kids, including babies? A lot of people no longer have landlines, and a lot of teens and even children these days have their own cellphones. The idea of everyone calling Claudia’s personal phone at a set time no longer holds up in the cellphone era.\n\nEven the notebook the controlling Kristy made everyone keep would probably be considered old-fashioned, since apparently a lot of kids these days don’t even write by hand anymore. And the whole plot of #4, Mary Anne Saves the Day, is obsolete since the advent of cellphones. A simple call to the Prezziosos would’ve immediately solved the issue. (The earliest books were actually fairly well-written, and the characters were fairly well-developed. I stopped reading somewhere in the 30s, somewhat before the ghostwriters completely took over.)\n\nThese books are snapshots of the Eighties and Nineties. Of course they’re going to contain references to VCRs, cassette tapes, Walkmans, rotary phones, typewriters, and no-longer-popular celebrities. And the depiction of diabetes is also outdated, since that really was the popular understanding of the disease at that time. There are far worse things that could’ve been improved, like the terribly awkward, unnecessary announcement in every single book that Jessi. Is. Black!\n\nIf kids today truly don’t know what records, cassettes, VCRs, stereos, The Muppet Show, Polaroids, typewriters, or perms are, they can ask someone, look it up, or just forget about it and enjoy the heart of the story. Since when were books expected to cater to generational sensibilities, and not serve as time capsules of their environment? Do these modern-day revisers/old-hating kids think classics like Tom Sawyer, Little Women, or the Little House series are irrelevant and boring because there’s no television, movies, computers, or telephones?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe optional book I chose on the urban/multicultural list for my recent YA Lit class was Andy Mulligan’s Trash, which I read in a couple of hours over one Shabbos. I loved the story itself (a mystery involving political corruption which three young slum boys get drawn into), but I found the narration itself beyond annoying.\n\nThere are a total of EIGHT first-person narrators through the book, three of whom only get one chapter each. I already forget who one of those narrators, Grace, even was. A couple of the last chapters even bop around between three or four of the narrators! And the hand-offs and identifications at the start of each chapter felt very awkward and silly. “Me again!” “Now me!” “My turn!” “Still me.” “I’m handing it over to Name now.” “This is Name.”\n\nOverall, I found it rather sad evidence of the decline of third-person omniscient in modern literature, at least in the English-speaking world. Either we now have an entire generation of writers who genuinely have no clue how to write third-person omniscient because they’ve never read it or written it, or a lot of writers these days have written it off as old-fashioned and unnecessary. This was so clearly a book that would’ve worked very well in third-person omniscient, but no, it could only be first-person, split up EIGHT ways. Seriously, not every book NEEDS to be first-person!\n\nI’ve certainly read books that worked very well with different narrators or POV characters, or that had sections that were alternately first- and third-person. But that always seemed like a conscious decision that worked well with how the book was structured and written, not something done to go along with a trend. I’ve honestly reached a point where I genuinely wonder if so many writers these days are only using first-person present tense and/or alternating narrators because they feel it’s expected, no matter how ill-suited that might be to their particular story.\n\nI love third-person omniscient, and couldn’t imagine not writing in it. It lets me fully get to know all of my characters, not just one or two, and to easily slip into anyone’s mind instead of being limited in scope. This isn’t to be confused with so-called “head-hopping.” You’re not doing third-person omniscient properly if you’re constantly bopping from character to character in every other line or paragraph. But it does mean you can explore everyone’s thoughts and motivations, instead of leaving things a mystery or not properly understood.\n\nIt also seems very old-fashioned to be a completely omniscient narrator in God mode, saying things like “the stupid woman” or “he idiotically believed the lie.” That’s not letting the reader use his or her own judgment or imagination as to motivations and consequences. It also doesn’t mean giving away spoilers or pivotal plot points (coughthebookthiefcough), like “Little did she know she would never get married, but that she would die six months before her wedding” or “In three months, all these characters you’ve just met are going to die!”\n\nThe way I structure third-person omniscient is to have one uniting storyline and set of characters, and gradually tie in the various subplots and secondary characters with the main events and people. That way, you can spend a chapter or scene away from the main action, building towards the coming-together of everyone and everything. Bopping around among three or more narrators or POV characters, one chapter at a time, isn’t something I’m a fan of. Those kinds of books feel disjointed and schizophrenic to me.\n\nIt’s easier, in my experience, to give each character a distinctive personality and voice in third-person omniscient. It’s much harder to do that with EIGHT, I repeat, EIGHT competing first-person narrators. First-person is tricky enough to do well already (contrary to a current belief that it’s somehow easier), but you really have to nail it to pull off multiple narrators.\n\nI’m always excited when I find a current book that’s third-person omniscient, or even just third-person period. I really hope there’s a movement back towards the tried and true default of the past. There’s a reason it was considered the literary default till very recently, just as there was a reason most literature was in the past tense and present tense was only used very selectively.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOff the top of my head, I can only think of one occasion when I wrote something in first-person that wasn’t told in journal format. It was one of the books of a discontinued series that was my attempt at writing a 1980s and 1990s version of the Little House books.\n\nEvery year, the family would move to and live in a new state. They had four daughters, Anna, Amy, Sally, and Kelly, and in the book about Montana, Mrs. Thomas, the mom, had twins, Davy and Emerald. The one first-person attempt in this juvenile series was the book about Illinois. So many years later, I can’t even remember why I decided to try that particular book in first-person. I still have those few pages, in the cornflower blue 5-subject notebook where I wrote the majority of the rough draft of Saga II of Cinnimin.\n\nBoy, is it appallingly awful. Completely NOT in the sweet, innocent (if immaturely-written) style of the prior books. The other book in that series I still have (also never finished) is about Utah, and similarly seems out of style with the earlier books (really more like novelettes) I’d written. I probably aborted that series because I just realized my heart was no longer in it and I wanted to write longer stuff, with more mature themes. It wasn’t right to have these wholesome characters suddenly acting like my Atlantic City characters and doing really goofy, loopy stuff besides. So I moved on.\n\nI’ve naturally always gravitated towards third-person omniscient, and will occasionally do third-person limited to an extent. But writing in first-person just doesn’t come naturally to me. I feel closer to my characters because they’re in third-person. I think of them by their names—Violet, Kit, Cinnimin, Max, Eulalia, Daphne, Portia, Justine, Adicia, Allen, Lenore, Lyuba, Ivan, Boris, Katrin, Kat, Nikolas, Eliisabet, et al. I get to know each of them as individuals, instead of a constant stream of I-I-I-me-me-me-my-my-my-mine-mine-mine.\n\nWhen you’re writing a long, complex, sweeping saga with a very wide plot trajectory, many characters, and numerous subplots and storylines, third-person omniscient is the only way to go. And third-person limited works if it’s a book of a lesser epic scale but you still want introspection and world-building. Most of my third-person limited so far has been with my Shoah characters, in the collections of stories I’m expanding into full novels. When you don’t have an ensemble cast and the story is more focused on just one character, third-person limited can work very well.\n\nI just can’t make the psychological leap of writing in the first person and pretending I’m a fictional character. Attempting to write an entire book, unless it were in journal form, in first-person when that’s not really my voice, would feel really fake and forced. I’d be extremely unhappy if I attempted it, since that’s just not who I am. I don’t want to pretend to be someone I’m not (i.e., a first-person writer, not a fictional character), and never will be. The old-fashioned third-person omniscient has always worked just fine for me.\n\nLately it’s harder for me to get into a first-person book, because it seems like 90% of all books nowadays, esp. YA, are first-person. I don’t remember nearly so many when I was a young adult a generation ago. I’ve enjoyed quite a few first-person books (most recently the classic Annie on My Mind), but because they were well-written and I liked the subject matter, not because I felt closer to the protagonist based on narrative choice.\n\nBut I have enjoyed writing limited first-person sections, in the form of letters and journal entries. It’s fun to write from the POV of just one character for a few pages, but I couldn’t sustain that over hundreds of pages.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
