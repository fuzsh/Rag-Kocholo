Er was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord put him to death. Judah then instructed his second son Onan to marry Tamar and perform the duty of a brother-in-law, which was to provide offspring for his deceased brother. However, Onan refused to do so, and the Lord also put him to death. Judah then promised Tamar that she would marry his third son Shelah when he grew up, but he did not keep his word. Tamar, who wanted to preserve the family line of Judah, disguised herself as a prostitute and seduced Judah himself. She asked for his seal, cord, and staff as a pledge for payment. Judah later sent a goat to redeem his pledge, but he could not find the woman. He then learned that Tamar was pregnant, and he accused her of being unfaithful. Tamar then revealed the identity of the father by showing him the seal, cord, and staff. Judah recognized them and admitted that he was the father. He also acknowledged that Tamar was more righteous than him, because he had not given her to Shelah as he had promised. Tamar then gave birth to twin sons, Perez and Zerah.\n\nThe most important verses in this chapter are verses 26–30, because they reveal the outcome of the story and its significance for the biblical narrative. Verse 26 shows Judah’s repentance and confession, as well as Tamar’s vindication and righteousness. Verse 27–30 show the birth of Perez and Zerah, who became the ancestors of the tribe of Judah and the royal line of David and Jesus.\n\nCommentary\n\nThis chapter is a surprising and shocking episode in the book of Genesis, which interrupts the story of Joseph and his brothers. It shows the moral failure of Judah, who left his brothers and married a Canaanite woman, who bore him three sons. He also failed to fulfill his obligation to Tamar, and he committed incest with her unknowingly. However, it also shows the grace and sovereignty of God, who used this sinful situation to bring about His redemptive plan. Tamar, who was a Canaanite woman and a widow, acted with courage and faith to secure her place in the family of Judah. She was not motivated by lust or revenge, but by a desire to preserve the seed of Judah, which was the seed of promise. She was also willing to risk her life for this purpose, as she faced the possibility of being burned to death for her pregnancy. God honored her faith and blessed her with twin sons, who became the forefathers of the tribe of Judah and the Messianic line. Judah, who was the leader of his brothers, also experienced a transformation in his character, as he humbled himself and confessed his sin. He later showed his maturity and integrity in his dealings with Joseph and Benjamin.\n\nThis chapter points to Jesus in several ways. First, it shows that Jesus came from a human lineage that was marked by sin and grace, and that He identified with the outcasts and the marginalized, such as Tamar. Second, it shows that Jesus is the true and greater Judah, who is the Lion of the tribe of Judah and the King of kings. He is the one who fulfilled the prophecy of Genesis 49:10, which says that the scepter will not depart from Judah until He comes to whom it belongs. Third, it shows that Jesus is the true and greater Perez, who was born through a miraculous intervention of God and who broke through the barrier of death and sin. He is the one who is called the Breaker in Micah 2:13, who leads His people to freedom and glory.\n\nOutline\n\nJudah’s departure from his brothers and marriage to a Canaanite woman (1–5)\n\nJudah’s sons Er and Onan die for their wickedness (6–10)\n\nJudah’s promise and delay to give Tamar to Shelah (11–14)\n\nTamar’s deception and seduction of Judah (15–23)\n\nTamar’s pregnancy and vindication (24–26)\n\nTamar’s delivery of twins Perez and Zerah (27–30)\n\nExegesis\n\nJudah’s departure from his brothers and marriage to a Canaanite woman (1–5)\n\nThis section introduces the main characters and setting of the story. It also shows Judah’s separation from his family and assimilation to the Canaanite culture.\n\nJudah left his brothers after the sale of Joseph and went to Adullam, a Canaanite town. There he befriended Hirah, an Adullamite, and married Shua, a Canaanite woman. This was contrary to the patriarchal tradition of marrying within the family or from their relatives in Mesopotamia (cf. Gen 24, 28).\n\nJudah and Shua had three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah. The names of the sons may reflect their Canaanite origin or influence. Er means “watcher”, Onan means “strong”, and Shelah means “petition” or “sprout”. The place of Shelah’s birth, Chezib, means “falsehood” or “deception”.\n\nThe narrator does not comment on Judah’s actions, but the reader can infer that Judah was compromising his faith and identity by mingling with the Canaanites. He was also neglecting his responsibility as the leader of his brothers and the bearer of the covenant promise.\n\nJudah’s sons Er and Onan die for their wickedness (6–10)\n\nThis section reveals the character and fate of Judah’s sons. It also introduces the custom of levirate marriage, which plays a crucial role in the story.\n\nJudah arranged a marriage for his firstborn son Er with Tamar, who was also a Canaanite. The name Tamar means “palm tree” or “date”. Tamar is the heroine of the story, although she is not portrayed as a model of virtue, but as a woman who acted out of necessity and faith.\n\nEr was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord killed him. The nature and extent of his wickedness are not specified, but it must have been very serious and offensive to God. Some commentators suggest that he was involved in idolatry, sexual immorality, or child sacrifice, which were common among the Canaanites. Er’s death was a divine judgment and a sign of God’s displeasure with Judah’s family.\n\nJudah then instructed his second son Onan to marry Tamar and perform the duty of a brother-in-law, which was to provide offspring for his deceased brother. This was a common practice in the ancient Near East, known as levirate marriage (from the Latin word levir, meaning “brother-in-law”). The purpose of this custom was to preserve the name and inheritance of the dead brother, and to provide support and protection for the widow. The first son born to the widow would be regarded as the son of the dead brother, and would inherit his share of the family property. The custom was later incorporated into the Mosaic law (Deut 25:5–10), and was the basis of the question posed by the Sadducees to Jesus about the resurrection (Matt 22:23–33).\n\nOnan agreed to marry Tamar, but he refused to fulfill his duty. He practiced a form of contraception by spilling his semen on the ground whenever he slept with her. He did this because he knew that the child would not be his, but his brother’s. He was selfish and greedy, and did not want to share his inheritance with his brother’s son. He also dishonored his brother, his father, and his wife by his act.\n\nOnan’s action displeased the Lord, and He killed him also. Onan’s sin was not the act of contraception itself, but the motive behind it. He violated the principle of love and justice, and he despised the covenant promise of God to bless Judah’s offspring. He also showed contempt for God’s authority and sovereignty over life and death. Onan’s death was another divine judgment and a sign of God’s displeasure with Judah’s family.\n\nJudah’s promise and delay to give Tamar to Shelah (11–14)\n\nThis section shows Judah’s reluctance to give his third son Shelah to Tamar, and Tamar’s patience and persistence to obtain a son from Judah’s family.\n\nJudah told Tamar to remain a widow in her father’s house until Shelah grew up. He did this because he feared that Shelah would die like his brothers if he married Tamar. He suspected that Tamar was somehow responsible for the deaths of Er and Onan, rather than acknowledging that they died because of their own wickedness and God’s judgment.\n\nJudah did not intend to keep his promise to Tamar, but he hoped that she would forget about it or find another husband. He did not care about her welfare or her right to have a son. He also did not value the importance of continuing the family line of his firstborn son Er, which was the line of promise and blessing.\n\nTamar obeyed Judah and stayed in her father’s house, wearing widow’s garments. She did this to show her loyalty and faithfulness to Judah’s family, and to wait for the opportunity to marry Shelah. She also did this to preserve her reputation and dignity, and to avoid any accusation of unfaithfulness or prostitution.\n\nTamar waited for a long time, but Judah did not give her to Shelah, even after he grew up. Judah broke his promise and his duty to Tamar, and he deprived her of her right to have a son. He also dishonored God and His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\n\nTamar learned that Judah was going to Timnah to shear his sheep. She also learned that his wife Shua had died, and that he had finished mourning for her. She realized that Judah had no intention of giving her to Shelah, and that she had to take matters into her own hands. She decided to deceive Judah and seduce him, in order to obtain a son from him.\n\nTamar took off her widow’s garments and covered herself with a veil. She disguised herself as a prostitute and sat by the entrance of Enaim, which was on the way to Timnah. She did this because she knew that Judah would pass by that place, and that he would be tempted to sleep with her. She also did this because she knew that Judah would not recognize her, and that he would not suspect her of being his daughter-in-law.\n\nTamar’s deception and seduction of Judah (15–23)\n\nThis section describes the encounter between Judah and Tamar, and the exchange of the pledge and the payment. It also reveals the character and conduct of Judah and Tamar in this situation.\n\nJudah saw Tamar and thought she was a prostitute, because she had covered her face with a veil. He did not know that she was his daughter-in-law, because he had not seen her for a long time, and because he did not expect her to be there. He also did not care about her identity, because he was only interested in satisfying his lust.\n\nJudah approached Tamar and asked her to sleep with him. He did this without any hesitation or shame, showing his moral weakness and corruption. He also did this without any regard for God’s law and will, which forbade such sexual immorality (Lev 18:15, 20:12).\n\nTamar agreed to sleep with Judah, but she asked him what he would give her as payment. She did this not because she wanted money or material things, but because she wanted a son from Judah. She also did this to secure a proof of Judah’s identity and responsibility, in case he would deny or accuse her later.\n\nJudah offered to send Tamar a young goat from his flock as payment. He did this because he thought that a goat was a fair price for a prostitute, and because he did not have anything else to give her at the moment. He also did this because he wanted to get rid of Tamar as soon as possible, and to avoid any further contact or obligation with her.\n\nTamar asked Judah for a pledge until he sent the payment. She asked him to give her his seal, his cord, and his staff. These were personal and valuable items that belonged to Judah, and that identified him as the owner and the leader of his family. They were also symbolic of his authority and his covenant relationship with God and His people.\n\nJudah gave Tamar his seal, his cord, and his staff as a pledge. He did this because he wanted to sleep with her, and because he did not think that these items were too important or risky to give away. He also did this because he trusted that Tamar would return them to him when he sent the payment, and that no one would know about their affair.\n\nJudah slept with Tamar, and she became pregnant by him. He did this without any love or respect for Tamar, and without any awareness or concern for the consequences of his action. He also did this without any recognition or acknowledgment of God’s presence and providence in this event.\n\nJudah left Tamar and went back to his sheep. He did this without any gratitude or kindness to Tamar, and without any repentance or remorse for his sin. He also did this without any suspicion or curiosity about Tamar, and without any intention or desire to see her again.\n\nJudah sent his friend Hirah the Adullamite to deliver the young goat to Tamar and to get back his pledge. He did this to fulfill his promise and to clear his debt to Tamar, and to retrieve his seal, his cord, and his staff. He also did this to cover up his sin and to forget about his encounter with Tamar.\n\nHirah went to the place where Tamar was, but he could not find her. He asked the men of the place about the prostitute who was there, but they said that there was no prostitute there. He returned to Judah and told him what happened. Judah was puzzled and perplexed, but he decided to let the matter go. He said that Tamar could keep the pledge, because he did not want to be exposed or ridiculed. He also said that he had done his best to pay her, because he did not want to admit his fault or his failure.\n\nTamar’s pregnancy and vindication (24–26)\n\nThis section shows the discovery and the resolution of Judah and Tamar’s affair. It also reveals the repentance and the confession of Judah, and the righteousness and the wisdom of Tamar.\n\nJudah was told that Tamar was pregnant by harlotry. He was outraged and ordered her to be brought out and burned. He did this because he thought that she had been unfaithful to his family, and that she had brought shame and dishonor to his name. He also did this because he was hypocritical and self-righteous, and he did not realize that he was the father of her child.\n\nTamar was brought out to be executed, but she sent a message to Judah, saying that the man who owned the seal, the cord, and the staff was the father of her child. She did this because she wanted to expose Judah’s sin and to save her life. She also did this because she wanted to give Judah a chance to repent and to acknowledge his responsibility.\n\nTamar showed Judah the seal, the cord, and the staff that he had given her as a pledge. These were the evidence and the proof of Judah’s identity and involvement. They were also the sign and the guarantee of God’s promise and blessing for Judah’s offspring.\n\nJudah recognized the seal, the cord, and the staff, and he admitted that he was the father of Tamar’s child. He did this because he was convicted and humbled by Tamar’s action, and he could not deny or hide his sin. He also did this because he was moved and impressed by Tamar’s faith and courage, and he could not condemn or reject her.\n\nJudah acknowledged that Tamar was more righteous than him, because he had not given her to his son Shelah as he had promised. He did this because he realized that Tamar had acted out of a noble and godly motive, and that she had done what was right and good for his family. He also did this because he realized that he had acted out of a selfish and wicked motive, and that he had done what was evil and harmful for his family.\n\nJudah did not sleep with Tamar again, but he treated her with respect and honor. He did this because he wanted to show his repentance and his change of heart, and he did not want to repeat his sin. He also did this because he wanted to show his appreciation and his gratitude to Tamar, and he did not want to exploit her.\n\nTamar’s delivery of twins Perez and Zerah (27–30)\n\nThis section describes the birth and the names of Tamar’s twin sons. It also reveals the fulfillment and the significance of God’s plan and purpose for Judah and Tamar.\n\nTamar gave birth to twin boys, who were the result of Judah’s union with her. They were the gift and the reward of God’s grace and mercy to Tamar, who had suffered and waited for a long time. They were also the instrument and the vessel of God’s power and sovereignty for Judah, who had sinned and failed many times.\n\nThe first son put out his hand, and the midwife tied a scarlet thread on his wrist, and said, “This one came out first.” She did this because she wanted to mark and identify the firstborn son, who had the right and the privilege of the birthright. She also did this because she wanted to witness and record the order and the manner of the birth.\n\nThe first son drew back his hand, and his brother came out, and the midwife said, “So this is how you have broken out!” She did this because she was surprised and amazed by the unusual and unexpected event. She also did this because she wanted to express and declare the meaning and the message of the birth.\n\nThe first son was named Perez, which means “breaking out” or “breach.” He was named this because he broke out of the womb after his brother had put out his hand. He was also named this because he represented the breaking out of God’s blessing and promise for Judah’s family, despite the obstacles and the difficulties.\n\nThe second son was named Zerah, which means “brightness” or “dawn.” He was named this because he had a scarlet thread on his wrist, which was a sign and a symbol of his birth. He was also named this because he represented the brightness of God’s grace and mercy for Judah’s family, despite the darkness and the sin.\n\nBackground and Context\n\nHistorical-cultural background\n\nThe historical and cultural background of the passage is the ancient Near East, around the second millennium BC. The passage is part of the patriarchal narratives, which recount the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants. These stories reflect the worldview, customs, and values of the ancient Israelites, who were a nomadic people living in a land surrounded by powerful nations and empires. The passage also shows the influence of the Canaanite culture, where Judah settled and married a Canaanite woman.

(Genesis 38:18)\n\nCord: This is a personal item that belonged to Judah, and that he gave to Tamar as a pledge. It was a string or a rope that was used to tie or hang something, such as a seal or a pouch. (Genesis 38:18)\n\nStaff: This is a personal item that belonged to Judah, and that he gave to Tamar as a pledge. It was a stick or a rod that was used as a support or a weapon, or as a symbol of authority or leadership. (Genesis 38:18)\n\nLevirate marriage: This is a custom or a law that required a man to marry the widow of his deceased brother, and to provide offspring for him. It was a way of preserving the name and the inheritance of the dead brother, and of providing support and protection for the widow. (Genesis 38:8; Deuteronomy 25:5–10)\n\nLaughingstock: שְׂחוֹק (sechoq), H7814 — In the Bible, laughingstock means something or someone that is ridiculed, mocked, or scorned. It is often used to describe the fate of the wicked, the enemies of God, or the suffering of the righteous. It is also used to express the irony and the reversal of God’s judgment and salvation.\n\nLaughingstock is mentioned 5 times in the Bible. The Old Testament Hebrew word שְׂחוֹק (sechoq) is used to refer to laughingstock and it appears 5 times. The New Testament Greek word “katagelastos” is not used to refer to laughingstock, but it has a similar meaning and it appears once.\n\nSome references for Laughingstock include: Job 12:4; Jeremiah 20:7; Lamentations 3:14; Psalm 44:13–14; Matthew 27:29.\n\nJob 12:4: “I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called on God and he answered — a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!” (Job 12:4 NIV)2\n\nJeremiah 20:7: “You deceived me, Lord, and I was deceived; you overpowered me and prevailed. I am ridiculed all day long; everyone mocks me.” (Jeremiah 20:7 NIV)3\n\nLamentations 3:14: “I became the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.” (Lamentations 3:14 NIV)4\n\nPsalm 44:13–14: “You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us. You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us.” (Psalm 44:13–14 NIV)\n\nMatthew 27:29: “and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. ‘Hail, king of the Jews!’ they said.” (Matthew 27:29 NIV)\n\nBreach: פֶּרֶץ (perets), H6556 — In the Bible, breach means a break, a gap, or a rupture in something, such as a wall, a covenant, or a law. It also signifies the act or the result of breaking through, bursting forth, or making a breach. It is often used to describe the judgment or the salvation of God, who can break through the barriers of sin and death, and who can bring forth the blessing and the glory of His kingdom.\n\nBreach is mentioned 52 times in the Bible. The Old Testament Hebrew word פֶּרֶץ (perets) is used to refer to breach and it appears 52 times. The New Testament Greek word “katagelastos” is not used to refer to breach, but it has a similar meaning and it appears once.\n\nSome references for Breach include: Genesis 38:29; Judges 5:17; Psalm 60:2; Isaiah 58:12; Matthew 27:29.\n\nTranslation\n\nGenre\n\nThe genre of the passage is narrative, which tells a story of events and characters in a sequential and chronological order. Narrative is the dominant genre in the book of Genesis, and it conveys historical, theological, and moral truths through the stories of the patriarchs and their families.\n\nStructure\n\nThe structure of the passage is linear, which follows a logical and causal progression of actions and outcomes. The passage can be divided into six scenes, each marked by a change of location, time, or character. The scenes are:\n\nScene 1: Judah’s departure from his brothers and marriage to a Canaanite woman (1–5)\n\nScene 2: Judah’s sons Er and Onan die for their wickedness (6–10)\n\nScene 3: Judah’s promise and delay to give Tamar to Shelah (11–14)\n\nScene 4: Tamar’s deception and seduction of Judah (15–23)\n\nScene 5: Tamar’s pregnancy and vindication (24–26)\n\nScene 6: Tamar’s delivery of twins Perez and Zerah (27–30)\n\nRhetorical devices\n\nParallelism: This is the repetition of similar or contrasting words, phrases, or clauses in successive lines or sentences. Parallelism is used to emphasize or compare ideas, or to create rhythm and balance. For example, in verse 26, Judah says, “She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shelah.” The parallel structure of the two clauses highlights the contrast between Tamar’s righteousness and Judah’s unrighteousness, and the reason for his confession.\n\nChiasm: This is the arrangement of words, phrases, or clauses in an inverted or symmetrical order. Chiasm is used to create a focal point or a climax, or to show a reversal or a contrast. For example, in verse 27, the birth of the twins is described in a chiastic pattern: A (the time came for her to give birth), B (there were twins in her womb), C (the first put out a hand), D (the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand), D’ (the one who had the scarlet thread), C’ (he drew back his hand), B’ (his brother came out), A’ (she gave birth). The chiastic structure draws attention to the unusual and significant event of the twins’ birth, and the reversal of their order.\n\nInclusio: This is the repetition of a word, phrase, or theme at the beginning and the end of a unit of text. Inclusio is used to mark the boundaries and the unity of a text, or to emphasize a main idea or theme. For example, in verses 1 and 30, the name of Judah forms an inclusio that frames the whole passage. The inclusio shows that the passage is focused on Judah and his offspring, and their role in the biblical narrative.\n\nAnaphora: This is the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences. Anaphora is used to create a rhetorical effect, such as emphasis, cohesion, or rhythm. For example, in verses 24–26, the phrase “she was brought out” is repeated three times at the beginning of each verse. The anaphora creates a sense of suspense and anticipation, as the reader wonders what will happen to Tamar when she is brought out to be executed, and how she will reveal Judah’s identity and involvement.\n\nClimax: This is the arrangement of words, phrases, or clauses in an ascending order of importance or intensity. Climax is used to create a sense of culmination or resolution, or to highlight a main point or message. For example, in verse 26, Judah’s confession reaches a climax when he says, “She is more righteous than I.” This is the most important and surprising statement in the passage, as it shows Judah’s repentance and recognition of Tamar’s faith and courage, and it also foreshadows the future prominence of Tamar’s offspring in the biblical story.\n\nFigures of speech\n\nMetaphor: This is the comparison of two things that are not literally alike, by using a word or phrase that normally applies to one thing to describe another. Metaphor is used to create a vivid or imaginative image, or to convey a deeper or hidden meaning. For example, in verse 14, Tamar is said to have “uncovered her face.” This is a metaphor that implies that she revealed her true identity and intention, and that she also exposed Judah’s sin and responsibility.\n\nSimile: This is the comparison of two things that are not literally alike, by using a word such as “like” or “as” to connect them. Simile is used to create a clear or striking image, or to illustrate a point or an analogy. For example, in verse 29, the midwife says to Tamar, “So this is how you have broken out!” This is a simile that compares the birth of Perez to a breach or a breakthrough, and that also suggests his future role and significance in the biblical story.\n\nPersonification: This is the attribution of human qualities or actions to something that is not human, such as an animal, an object, or an abstract concept. Personification is used to create a lively or dramatic image, or to express a mood or an emotion. For example, in verse 7, Er is said to be “wicked in the sight of the LORD.” This is a personification that implies that the LORD has eyes and can see, and that He also has a moral standard and can judge.\n\nHyperbole: This is the exaggeration of a statement or a fact for the sake of emphasis or effect. Hyperbole is used to create a strong impression or a humorous effect, or to express a strong emotion or opinion. For example, in verse 9, Onan is said to have spilled his semen “on the ground.” This is a hyperbole that exaggerates the extent and the frequency of his action, and that also implies his contempt and disregard for Tamar and his brother’s offspring.\n\nIdiom: This is a word or phrase that has a figurative meaning that is different from its literal meaning, and that is understood by the speakers of a certain language or culture. Idiom is used to convey a specific or a subtle meaning, or to express a common or a familiar idea. For example, in verse 11, Judah tells Tamar to “remain a widow in your father’s house.” This is an idiom that means to stay unmarried and dependent on her father, and that also implies that Judah has no intention of giving her to Shelah.\n\nIrony: This is the use of words or situations that convey a meaning that is opposite or different from what is expected or intended. Irony is used to create a contrast or a contradiction, or to expose a hidden or a deeper truth. For example, in verse 26, Judah says that Tamar is “more righteous than I.” This is an irony that contrasts Judah’s unrighteousness and Tamar’s righteousness, and that also reveals Judah’s guilt and Tamar’s innocence.\n\nWord pictures\n\nIn verse 14, the word for “veil” is צַעִיף (ṣāʿîp̄), which literally means “a wrapper” or “a covering”. It is a different word from the usual term for a woman’s veil, רָדִיד (rādîd), which means “a sheet” or “a curtain”. The word ṣāʿîp̄ is used elsewhere in the Old Testament to describe a garment worn by men (1 Samuel 21:9; 2 Samuel 15:30; Isaiah 22:12). It may imply that Tamar was disguising herself as a male prostitute, or that she was wearing a distinctive type of veil that was associated with prostitution.\n\nIn verse 15, the word for “prostitute” is קְדֵשָׁה (qədēšāh), which literally means “a consecrated one” or “a holy one”. It is derived from the root קָדַשׁ (qādaš), which means “to be holy” or “to set apart”. The word qədēšāh refers to a female cult prostitute, who served in the fertility rites of the Canaanite religion. She was considered to be sacred and dedicated to a god or goddess, and her sexual activity was believed to ensure the fertility of the land and the people. The word qədēšāh is contrasted with the word for “harlot” or “whore”, זוֹנָה (zônāh), which means “a cheap one” or “a fornicator”. The word zônāh refers to a secular or commercial prostitute, who sold her body for money or pleasure. The word zônāh is used in verse 21 to describe Tamar, when Judah’s friend Hirah looked for her.\n\nIn verse 18, the word for “seal” is חוֹתָם (ḥôṯām), which literally means “a signet” or “a stamp”. It is a small piece of clay or metal that had an engraved design or inscription, and that was used to stamp or seal documents or objects. The word ḥôṯām is related to the verb חָתַם (ḥāṯam), which means “to seal” or “to close”. The word ḥôṯām represents Judah’s identity and authority, as it bore his personal mark or name. It also represents Judah’s covenant relationship with God and His people, as it was a symbol of ownership and protection.\n\nIn verse 18, the word for “cord” is פְּתִיל (pəṯîl), which literally means “a thread” or “a string”. It is a thin strand of fiber or material that was used to tie or hang something, such as a seal or a pouch. The word pəṯîl is related to the verb פָּתַל (pāṯal), which means “to twist” or “to entwine”. The word pəṯîl represents Judah’s connection and obligation, as it was attached to his seal and his staff. It also represents Judah’s moral and spiritual condition, as it was twisted and entangled by his sin and guilt.\n\nIn verse 18, the word for “staff” is מַטֶּה (maṭṭeh), which literally means “a branch” or “a rod”. It is a stick or a pole that was used as a support or a weapon, or as a symbol of authority or leadership. The word maṭṭeh is related to the verb נָטָה (nāṯāh), which means “to stretch” or “to incline”. The word maṭṭeh represents Judah’s power and status, as it was a sign of his leadership and his tribe. It also represents Judah’s direction and destiny, as it was a tool of his guidance and his journey.\n\nTextual variants\n\nIn verse 5, some manuscripts have the word אֲשֶׁר (ʾăšer), which means “which” or “that”, before the word קְזִיב (qəzîb), which means “Chezib” or “deception”. The word ʾăšer may have been added to clarify the grammatical construction of the sentence, or it may have been omitted to avoid confusion with the name of Judah’s son Asher. The word ʾăšer does not affect the meaning of the sentence, but it may affect the rhythm and the balance of the parallelism. The word ʾăšer is found in the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Septuagint, and some Hebrew manuscripts, but it is absent in the Masoretic Text, the Syriac Peshitta, and the Vulgate.\n\nIn verse 12, some manuscripts have the word וַיִּנָּחֵם (wayyinnāḥēm), which means “and he was comforted”, after the word יְהוּדָה (yəhûdāh), which means “Judah”. The word wayyinnāḥēm may have been added to explain Judah’s recovery from his grief, or it may have been omitted to avoid repetition with the word וַיִּתְנַחֵם (wayyiṯnaḥēm), which means “and he was comforted”, in verse 13. The word wayyinnāḥēm does not affect the meaning of the sentence, but it may affect the emphasis and the transition of the narrative. The word wayyinnāḥēm is found in the Septuagint, the Syriac Peshitta, and some Hebrew manuscripts, but it is absent in the Masoretic Text, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Vulgate.\n\nIn verse 16, some manuscripts have the word אֶת (ʾeṯ), which is a marker of the direct object, before the word תָּמָר (tāmār), which means “Tamar”. The word ʾeṯ may have been added to indicate the grammatical function of Tamar as the object of Judah’s speech, or it may have been omitted to avoid confusion with the name of Judah’s son Ete. The word ʾeṯ does not affect the meaning of the sentence, but it may affect the clarity and the readability of the text. The word ʾeṯ is found in the Masoretic Text, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and some Hebrew manuscripts, but it is absent in the Septuagint, the Syriac Peshitta, and the Vulgate.\n\nTranslation recommendations\n\nVerse 14: The phrase “she uncovered her face” could be translated more literally as “she revealed her eyes”, which is the Hebrew idiom for removing a veil or a mask. This translation would capture the wordplay and the irony of the expression, as Tamar revealed her eyes to hide her identity, and Judah did not see her eyes to recognize her.\n\nVerse 15: The word “prostitute” could be translated more specifically as “cult prostitute”, which is the meaning of the Hebrew word qədēšāh. This translation would highlight the religious and cultural context of Tamar’s disguise, and Judah’s involvement in the Canaanite fertility rites.\n\nVerse 18: The words “seal”, “cord”, and “staff” could be translated more symbolically as “signet”, “thread”, and “rod”, which are the meanings of the Hebrew words ḥôṯām, pəṯîl, and maṭṭeh. This translation would emphasize the significance and the function of these items as symbols of Judah’s identity, authority, connection, obligation, power, status, direction, and destiny.\n\nDisagreements between translators\n\nVerse 9: The phrase “he wasted his seed on the ground” could be translated differently depending on the understanding of the Hebrew verb שִׁחֵת (šîḥēṯ), which means “to destroy” or “to ruin”. Some translators interpret this verb as implying a form of contraception, such as coitus interruptus or withdrawal, and render it as “he spilled his semen” (NRSV, NIV, ESV, NASB) or “he let it go to waste” (CEB, NLT). Other translators interpret this verb as implying a form of masturbation, such as manual stimulation or emission, and render it as “he masturbated” (REB, NJB) or “he ejaculated” (NET, CSB).\n\nSome of the words that don’t translate well are\n\nIn verse 14, the word for “gate” is פֶּתַח (peṯaḥ), which literally means “an opening” or “an entrance”. It is a general term that can refer to any kind of gate, door, or opening. However, in the context of this verse, it may have a more specific meaning, as it is used in parallel with the word for “road” or “way”, דֶּרֶךְ (derek). The word peṯaḥ may refer to a particular type of gate, such as a city gate or a toll gate, where travelers would enter or exit a road, and where they might encounter prostitutes or other people. Some translations try to capture this nuance by using words like “entrance” (NRSV, NIV, ESV, NASB, CSB) or “gateway” (CEB, NLT, NET), while others use the more generic “gate” (KJV, NKJV, AMP).\n\nIn verse 21, the word for “cult prostitute” is קְדֵשָׁה (qədēšāh), which literally means “a consecrated one” or “a holy one”. It is derived from the root קָדַשׁ (qādaš), which means “to be holy” or “to set apart”. The word qədēšāh refers to a female cult prostitute, who served in the fertility rites of the Canaanite religion. She was considered to be sacred and dedicated to a god or goddess, and her sexual activity was believed to ensure the fertility of the land and the people. The word qədēšāh is contrasted with the word for “harlot” or “whore”, זוֹנָה (zônāh), which means “a cheap one” or “a fornicator”. The word zônāh refers to a secular or commercial prostitute, who sold her body for money or pleasure. The word qədēšāh is difficult to translate, as it has no exact equivalent in English or other modern languages. Some translations use the term “cult prostitute” (NRSV, NIV, ESV, NASB, NET, CSB), while others use the term “shrine prostitute” (CEB, NLT, AMP), or simply “prostitute” (KJV, NKJV)\n\nHow other translations make the translation\n\nIn verse 5, some translations use “Chezib” (NRSV, NIV, ESV, NASB, NET, CSB, AMP) instead of “Achzib” (KJV, NKJV, CEB, NLT) for the name of the place where Judah’s wife gave birth to Shelah. This is based on the Hebrew spelling of the name, which is קְזִיב (qəzîb). However, the name is also spelled אַכְזִיב (ʾaḵzîb) in other places in the Old Testament (Joshua 15:44; Judges 1:31; Micah 1:14), and some translations follow this spelling to avoid confusion with other names that begin with Q.\n\nIn verse 14, some translations use “Enaim” (NRSV, NIV, ESV, NASB, NET, CSB, AMP) instead of “the entrance to Enaim” (KJV, NKJV, CEB, NLT) for the name of the place where Tamar sat by the road to Timnah. This is based on the Hebrew spelling of the name, which is עֵינַיִם (ʿênayim). However, the name is also spelled עֵין (ʿên) in other places in the Old Testament (Joshua 15:32), and some translations follow this spelling to avoid confusion with the word for “eyes”, which is also ʿênayim in Hebrew.\n\nIn verse 26, some translations use “righteous” (NRSV, NIV, ESV, NASB, NET, CSB, AMP) instead of “just” (KJV, NKJV, CEB, NLT) for the word that Judah uses to describe Tamar. This is based on the Hebrew word צַדֵּק (ṣaddēq), which means “righteous” or “just”. However, some translations prefer to use “just” to avoid the implication that Tamar was morally perfect, and to emphasize that she acted according to the law and the custom of levirate marriage.\n\nRepetition of words, phrases, and concepts\n\nThe name of Judah is repeated 21 times in the passage, which shows his importance and prominence in the story. Judah is the main character and the focus of the narrative, and his name also represents his tribe and his lineage.\n\nThe word for “recognize” or “identify” is repeated four times in the passage, twice in verse 25 and twice in verse 26. This word is נָכַר (nāḵar), which means “to recognize” or “to acknowledge”. It is used to describe the act of sending and receiving the personal items of Judah, such as the seal, the cord, and the staff, and to describe the act of admitting and confessing the sin and the responsibility of Judah. The repetition of this word creates a parallel and a contrast between the two scenes, and it also highlights the theme of recognition and identification in the story.\n\nThe word for “wicked” or “evil” is repeated three times in the passage, once in verse 7 and twice in verse 10. This word is רַע (raʿ), which means “wicked” or “evil”. It is used to describe the character and the fate of Er and Onan, who were wicked in the sight of the LORD, and whom the LORD killed. The repetition of this word creates a connection and a contrast between the two brothers, and it also highlights the theme of wickedness and judgment in the story.\n\nSome of the other translation issues include\n\nIn verse 8, the phrase “perform your duty as a brother-in-law” is a translation of the Hebrew verb יָבַם (yābam), which means “to perform the duty of a brother-in-law” or “to marry the widow of a brother”. This verb is the origin of the term “levirate marriage”, which is derived from the Latin word levir, meaning “brother-in-law”. The verb yābam is a technical term that refers to a specific custom or law that required a man to marry the widow of his deceased brother, and to provide offspring for him. The verb yābam is difficult to translate, as it has no exact equivalent in English or other modern languages. Some translations use a descriptive phrase, such as “perform your duty as a brother-in-law” (NRSV, NIV, ESV, NASB, NET, CSB, AMP) or “do your duty by her as a brother-in-law” (KJV, NKJV, CEB, NLT), while others use a transliteration, such as “perform the duty of a husband’s brother” (NASB margin) or “do the duty of a levir” (KJV margin).\n\nIn verse 24, the phrase “she was brought out” is a translation of the Hebrew verb יוּצְאוּ (yûṣəʾû), which means “they brought out” or “they took out”. This verb is in the plural form, which implies that there were more than one person who brought out Tamar to be executed. However, the subject of the verb is not specified, and it is unclear who were the ones who brought out Tamar. Some translations use a passive voice, such as “she was brought out” (NRSV, NIV, ESV, NASB, NET, CSB, AMP) or “she was being brought out” (KJV, NKJV, CEB, NLT), while others use an active voice, such as “they brought her out” (NRSV margin) or “they were bringing her out” (NIV margin).\n\nSeeing Jesus\n\nThis passage does not point directly to Jesus or explicitly mention any of the titles that refer to Him. However, it does imply that Judah is the son of Jacob who will receive the blessing and the promise of the Messiah, as Jacob later prophesies in Genesis 49:8–12.\n\nThis passage foreshadows or anticipates Jesus in several ways, such as:\n\nThe union of Judah and Tamar, though sinful and shameful, is part of the lineage that leads to Jesus, as Matthew 1:3 shows. This foreshadows the grace and the sovereignty of God, who can use human sin and weakness to bring about His redemptive plan and purpose. (Romans 5:20–21; 8:28; Ephesians 1:11)\n\nThe birth of Perez and Zerah, though unusual and unexpected, is part of the continuity and the significance of the line of Judah, as Ruth 4:18–22 shows. This anticipates the birth of David and Jesus, who are the royal descendants of Perez, and who are the anointed kings of Israel. (2 Samuel 7:8–17; Matthew 1:1–6; Luke 1:26–33; Revelation 5:5)\n\nThe confession of Judah, though humbling and repentant, is part of the transformation and the leadership of Judah, as Genesis 43:1–10 and 44:14–34 show. This anticipates the role of Judah as the spokesman and the protector of his brothers, and as the forerunner of the two main tribes of Israel. (Genesis 49:8–12; 1 Kings 12:16–24; Revelation 7:4–8)\n\nThis passage does not contain any prophecy or promise of the coming Messiah as originally noted in Genesis 3:15. However, it does relate to the promise of God to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their offspring, as Genesis 12:1–3 and 28:13–15 show. This promise includes the blessing of the nations through the seed of Abraham, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus, who is the true seed of Abraham, and who is the Christ, the Son of God, the Savior of the world. (Galatians 3:16; John 4:42)\n\nInterpretation\n\nInterfaith Differences\n\nMuslims do not accept this passage as a reliable or authoritative source of information about Judah and Tamar, as they regard the Torah as corrupted and altered by the Jews. They also reject the idea that Judah and Tamar are part of the lineage of the prophets and the messengers of God, as they believe that God chose only pure and righteous people for this honor. They also condemn the incestuous and adulterous relationship between Judah and Tamar, as they consider it a grave sin and a violation of God’s law. (Quran 2:79; 6:85–86; 17:32; 25:68)\n\nJews accept this passage as a historical and theological account of Judah and Tamar, as they regard the Torah as the inspired and authoritative word of God. They also acknowledge that Judah and Tamar are part of the lineage of the kings and the messiahs of Israel, as they believe that God used their sin and grace to fulfill His covenant and promise. They also justify the levirate marriage between Judah and Tamar, as they consider it a duty and a blessing to preserve the name and the inheritance of the dead brother. (Deuteronomy 25:5–10; Ruth 4:11–12; 1 Chronicles 2:3–15; Matthew 1:1–3)\n\nDenominational Differences\n\nThere are some denominational differences in the interpretation of this passage, such as:\n\nCatholics view this passage as a typological and sacramental foreshadowing of Jesus and the Church, as they regard the Bible as a unified and coherent revelation of God’s plan of salvation. They also see Judah and Tamar as figures of Christ and the Church, as they believe that Christ is the true son of Judah and the true bridegroom of the Church. They also interpret the seal, the cord, and the staff as symbols of the sacraments of baptism, confirmation, and holy orders, which confer grace and identity on the members of the Church. (Catechism of the Catholic Church 128–130; 436; 1216; 1285; 1536)\n\nProtestants view this passage as a historical and moral illustration of God’s grace and sovereignty, as they regard the Bible as a diverse and complex revelation of God’s character and will. They also see Judah and Tamar as examples of sinners and saints, as they believe that all people are sinful and need God’s grace and forgiveness. They also interpret the seal, the cord, and the staff as signs of God’s covenant and faithfulness, which assure and protect His people. (Romans 3:23; 5:20–21; 8:28; Ephesians 1:3–14; 4:30; Hebrews 6:17–20)\n\nDoctrinal Foundations\n\nThis passage is not foundational for any Church doctrine, as it does not contain any explicit or implicit teaching or revelation about God, humanity, salvation, or the Church. However, this passage does contribute to some doctrines, such as:\n\nThe doctrine of providence: This passage reveals that God is in control of all things, and that He works through human sin and grace to accomplish His redemptive plan and purpose. God used the sin and the failure of Judah and his sons, who violated His law and will, and who compromised their faith and identity, to bring about His grace and His sovereignty, who used the faith and the righteousness of Tamar, who acted with courage and wisdom, and who sought to preserve the seed of promise. (Genesis 50:20; Isaiah 55:8–9; Romans 9:15–18)\n\nThe doctrine of the Messiah: This passage reveals that God is faithful and sovereign, and that He keeps and fulfills His promises. God kept His promise and His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and with their offspring, and He fulfilled His promise and His prophecy through the line of Judah and the birth of Perez and Zerah, who became the ancestors of the tribe of Judah and the royal line of David and Jesus. (Genesis 12:1–3; 49:8–12; Ruth 4:18–22; Matthew 1:1–3; Luke 3:33; Revelation 5:5)\n\nPractical lessons\n\nThis passage teaches us some practical lessons about God, man, and ourselves.\n\nWhat does this passage tell us about God?\n\nHoliness and righteousness: God is holy and righteous, and He judges and punishes sin. He does not tolerate or overlook the wickedness and the failure of Judah and his sons, who violated His law and will, and who compromised their faith and identity. He killed Er and Onan for their evil deeds, and He exposed Judah’s sin and guilt. (Leviticus 11:44–45; Psalm 89:14; Romans 1:18; 6:23)\n\nGrace and mercy: God is gracious and merciful, and He forgives and restores sinners. He does not abandon or reject Judah and Tamar, who sinned and suffered, but He used their sin and weakness to bring about His redemptive plan and purpose. He gave them repentance and confession, and He blessed them with offspring and inheritance. (Exodus 34:6–7; Psalm 103:8–14; Micah 7:18–19; 1 John 1:9)\n\nFaithfulness and sovereignty: God is faithful and sovereign, and He keeps and fulfills His promises. He kept His promise and His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and with their offspring, and He fulfilled His promise and His prophecy through the line of Judah and the birth of Perez and Zerah, who became the ancestors of the tribe of Judah and the royal line of David and Jesus. (Numbers 23:19; Isaiah 46:9–11; 2 Corinthians 1:20; Hebrews 10:23)\n\nWhat does this passage tell us about man?\n\nSinfulness and weakness: Man is sinful and weak, and he fails and falls short of God’s glory. He is prone to disobey and dishonor God, and to compromise and corrupt his faith and identity. He is also vulnerable to temptation and deception, and to the consequences and the guilt of his sin. Judah and his sons illustrate these aspects of human nature, as they sinned against God and Tamar, and as they suffered and struggled. (Romans 3:23; 7:14–25; James 1:13–15; 1 John 1:8–10)\n\nFaith and righteousness: Man is also capable of faith and righteousness, by the grace and the power of God. He can act with courage and wisdom, and seek to preserve and fulfill God’s will and plan. He can also humble himself and acknowledge his fault and his responsibility, and receive God’s forgiveness and restoration. Tamar and Judah also illustrate these aspects of human nature, as they acted with faith and righteousness, and as they received God’s grace and blessing. (Hebrews 11:11–12; James 2:21–26; 1 John 1:9; Proverbs 28:13)\n\nPromise and fulfillment: Man is also part of God’s promise and fulfillment, as he is created in God’s image and likeness, and as he is called to be God’s partner and representative. He is also part of God’s redemptive plan and purpose, as he is the recipient and the agent of God’s salvation and blessing. He is also part of God’s covenant and prophecy, as he is the offspring and the ancestor of the Messiah, who is the true seed of Abraham and the true son of Judah. Judah and Tamar also illustrate these aspects of human nature, as they were part of God’s promise and fulfillment, and as they were the ancestors of David and Jesus. (Genesis 1:26–28; 12:1–3; 49:8–12; Matthew 1:1–3; Luke 3:33; Revelation 5:5)\n\nWhat does this passage demand of me?\n\nTo repent and confess my sin: I need to recognize and admit my sin and my guilt, and to turn away from it and to God. I need to seek God’s forgiveness and restoration, and to accept His grace and mercy. I need to follow the example of Judah, who humbled himself and acknowledged his fault and his responsibility. (1 John 1:9; Proverbs 28:13; James 4:8–10)\n\nTo act with faith and righteousness: I need to trust and obey God, and to do His will and plan. I need to act with courage and wisdom, and to seek to preserve and fulfill God’s promise and purpose. I need to follow the example of Tamar, who acted with faith and righteousness, and who sought to preserve the seed of promise. (Hebrews 11:6; James 2:17–18; Proverbs 3:5–6)\n\nTo rejoice and praise God: I need to thank and worship God, and to celebrate His power and sovereignty. I need to acknowledge and appreciate His grace and mercy, and His faithfulness and sovereignty. I need to rejoice and praise God for His redemptive plan and purpose, and for His promise and fulfillment. (Psalm 103:1–5; 145:1–21; Ephesians 1:3–14; Revelation 5:9–14)\n\nHow should this passage change the way I relate to people?\n\nTo love and respect them: I should treat people with love and respect, as they are created in God’s image and likeness, and as they are part of God’s plan and purpose. I should not violate or dishonor them, or compromise or corrupt their faith and identity. I should follow the commandment of God, to love my neighbor as myself. (Matthew 22:37–40; Romans 13:8–10; 1 Peter 2:17)\n\nTo serve and support them: I should help and care for people, especially those who are in need or in trouble, and those who are part of my family or community. I should not neglect or abandon them, or take advantage of them. I should follow the example of Christ, who came not to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many. (Matthew 20:26–28; Galatians 6:2; 1 John 3:16–18)\n\nTo share and witness to them: I should share and witness to people the good news of God’s salvation and blessing, and the hope of His coming and His kingdom. I should not hide or withhold the gospel from them, or be ashamed or afraid of it. I should follow the commission of Christ, to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obey everything He commanded. (Matthew 28:18–20; Romans 1:16–17; 1 Peter 3:15–16)\n\nHow does this passage prompt me to pray to God?\n\nTo confess and repent of my sin: I should pray to God to forgive me and to cleanse me from all unrighteousness. I should pray to God to search me and to know me, and to reveal to me any hidden or habitual sin in my life. I should pray to God to create in me a clean heart and a right spirit, and to renew a steadfast spirit within me. (Psalm 51:1–12; 139:23–24; 1 John 1:9)\n\nTo ask for His grace and mercy: I should pray to God to have mercy on me and to help me in my time of need. I should pray to God to heal me and to restore me, and to deliver me from evil. I should pray to God to strengthen me and to empower me, and to fill me with His Spirit. (Psalm 86:1–7; 103:8–14; Hebrews 4:16; Ephesians 3:14–21)\n\nTo thank and praise Him for His faithfulness and sovereignty: I should pray to God to thank Him and to praise Him for His power and sovereignty, and for His grace and mercy. I should pray to God to acknowledge Him and to appreciate Him, and to glorify His name. I should pray to God to rejoice in Him and to worship Him, and to declare His works and His wonders. (Psalm 100:1–5; 145:1–21; Ephesians 1:3–14; Revelation 5:9–14)\n\nHow does this passage challenge me to grow as a Christian?\n\nTo grow in holiness and righteousness: I should strive to be holy and righteous, as God is holy and righteous. I should avoid and resist sin and temptation, and to pursue and practice godliness and goodness. I should follow the example of Christ, who is the Holy One of God, and who lived a sinless and perfect life. (1 Peter 1:13–16; 2:21–25; 1 John 2:1–6; 3:4–10)\n\nTo grow in faith and obedience: I should trust and obey God, and to do His will and plan. I should act with courage and wisdom, and to seek to preserve and fulfill God’s promise and purpose. I should follow the example of Abraham, who is the father of faith, and who obeyed God and believed His promise. (Hebrews 11:8–19; Romans 4:16–25; James 2:21–24)\n\nTo grow in love and service: I should love and serve God, and to love and serve my neighbor. I should treat people with love and respect, and to help and care for them.

(Romans 5:1–5; 15:13; Philippians 4:4–7; 1 Thessalonians 5:16–18)\n\nStudy Summary\n\nGenesis 38 is a narrative that tells the story of Judah and Tamar, and how their sin and grace led to the birth of Perez and Zerah, who became the ancestors of the tribe of Judah and the royal line of David and Jesus. The passage is often viewed as a disruption or an interlude in the Joseph story, but it has many connections and contrasts with the surrounding chapters, and it also has significant theological and practical implications for the readers.\n\nThe passage can be divided into four main sections, based on the changes of scene and time:\n\nVerses 1–11: Judah’s marriage and sons. This section introduces the main characters and the setting of the story. Judah leaves his brothers and marries a Canaanite woman, who bears him three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah. Er marries Tamar, but he is wicked and the Lord kills him. Judah instructs Onan to perform the duty of a brother-in-law and marry Tamar, but Onan refuses and the Lord kills him too. Judah sends Tamar back to her father’s house, promising to give her Shelah when he grows up, but he has no intention of doing so.\n\nVerses 12–19: Tamar’s deception and Judah’s sin. This section describes the main conflict and the climax of the story. Judah’s wife dies and he goes to shear his sheep. Tamar hears that Judah is going to Timnah and she disguises herself as a cult prostitute and sits by the road. Judah sees her and does not recognize her. He solicits her and she asks for his seal, his cord, and his staff as a pledge. He gives them to her and sleeps with her. She conceives and leaves.\n\nVerses 20–26: Judah’s search and Tamar’s vindication. This section reveals the resolution and the reversal of the story. Judah sends his friend Hirah to redeem his pledge from the cult prostitute, but he cannot find her. He asks the people of Enaim, but they say there was no cult prostitute there. Judah decides to let her keep the pledge, lest he become a laughingstock. Three months later, Judah hears that Tamar is pregnant by prostitution. He orders her to be brought out and burned. She sends him his seal, his cord, and his staff, and says that the owner of these is the father of her child. Judah recognizes them and admits that she is more righteous than he, because he did not give her Shelah. He does not sleep with her again.\n\nVerses 27–30: Perez and Zerah’s birth and significance. This section concludes the story and shows the outcome and the importance of the events. Tamar gives birth to twins, Perez and Zerah. The midwife ties a scarlet thread on the hand of Zerah, who comes out first, but Perez pushes ahead and comes out first. The midwife says, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” The names of Perez and Zerah mean “breach” and “brightness” respectively, and they indicate the role and the destiny of these sons in the history of Israel.\n\nThe passage has several literary features and devices that enhance its meaning and message, such as:\n\nRepetition of words and phrases, such as “recognize” (vv. 16, 25, 26), “wicked” (vv. 7, 10), “bring out” (vv. 24, 25), and “in the sight of the Lord” (vv. 7, 10). These repetitions create parallels and contrasts between the scenes and the characters, and they also highlight the themes of recognition, wickedness, judgment, and the Lord’s involvement in the story.\n\nWordplay and irony, such as the names of Judah, Tamar, Perez, and Zerah, which have meanings related to their actions and their roles. Judah means “praise”, but he acts shamefully and dishonorably. Tamar means “palm tree”, but she acts like a prostitute and a widow. Perez means “breach”, but he becomes the leader and the ancestor of the tribe of Judah. Zerah means “brightness”, but he is overshadowed by his brother Perez. The irony is also seen in the reversal of roles and expectations, such as Tamar being more righteous than Judah, and Perez being the firstborn instead of Zerah.\n\nAllusions and foreshadowing, such as the seal, the cord, and the staff, which are symbols of identity and authority, and which are also used in other biblical stories, such as Joseph and Potiphar’s wife (Gen. 39:11–18), and Moses and Aaron (Exod. 4:1–5; 7:8–13). The scarlet thread, which is a sign of the firstborn, and which is also used in other biblical stories, such as Rahab and the spies (Josh. 2:18–21), and David and Ziba (2 Sam. 16:1–4). The levirate marriage, which is a custom or a law that requires a brother to marry the widow of his brother, and which is also illustrated in other biblical stories, such as Ruth and Boaz (Ruth 4:1–12), and the Sadducees and Jesus (Matt. 22:23–33). These allusions and foreshadowing show the connections and the continuity of the story with the rest of the Bible, and they also point to the future fulfillment and significance of the events.\n\nThe passage has several theological and practical implications and applications for the readers, such as:\n\nThe holiness and righteousness of God, who judges and punishes sin, and who does not tolerate or overlook the wickedness and the failure of Judah and his sons, who violated His law and will, and who compromised their faith and identity. The readers are challenged to repent and confess their sin, and to avoid and resist sin and temptation, and to pursue and practice godliness and goodness. They are also reminded of the example of Christ, who is the Holy One of God, and who lived a sinless and perfect life. (Lev. 11:44–45; Ps. 89:14; Rom. 1:18; 6:23; 1 Pet. 1:13–16; 2:21–25; 1 John 2:1–6; 3:4–10)\n\nThe grace and mercy of God, who forgives and restores sinners, and who does not abandon or reject Judah and Tamar, who sinned and suffered, but who used their sin and weakness to bring about His redemptive plan and purpose. The readers are encouraged to seek God’s forgiveness and restoration, and to accept His grace and mercy. They are also assured of the example of Christ, who is the Son of God and the Son of Man, and who died and rose again for the forgiveness and the salvation of sinners. (Exod. 34:6–7; Ps. 103:8–14; Mic. 7:18–19; Rom. 5:20–21; 8:28; Eph. 1:3–14; 1 John 1:9; John 3:16; 10:17–18)\n\nThe faithfulness and sovereignty of God, who keeps and fulfills His promises, and who kept His promise and His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and with their offspring, and who fulfilled His promise and His prophecy through the line of Judah and the birth of Perez and Zerah, who became the ancestors of the tribe of Judah and the royal line of David and Jesus. The readers are inspired to trust and obey God, and to do His will and plan. They are also thankful and worshipful of the example of Christ, who is the descendant of Abraham and Judah, and who is the Christ, the Son of God, the Savior of the world, and the King of kings. (Num. 23:19; Isa. 46:9–11; 2 Cor. 1:20; Heb. 10:23; Gen. 12:1–3; 49:8–12; Ruth 4:18–22; Matt. 1:1–3; Luke 3:33; Rev. 5:5; John 4:42; 1:49; 19:19)\n\nIn conclusion, Genesis 38 is a narrative that tells the story of Judah and Tamar, and how their sin and grace led to the birth of Perez and Zerah, who became the ancestors of the tribe of Judah and the royal line of David and Jesus. The passage is not a disruption or an interlude in the Joseph story, but a meaningful and significant part of the biblical revelation and history. The passage has literary, theological, and practical dimensions that enrich and challenge the readers. The passage also shows the power and the sovereignty of God, who can use human sin and weakness to accomplish His redemptive plan and purpose, and who can bring forth the Messiah, the Savior of the world, from a sinful and shameful union.\n\nAdditional questions\n\nWhat social norms and practices does this chapter highlight about the time period it was written in?\n\nThis chapter highlights some of the social norms and practices that were prevalent in the ancient Near East, especially among the Israelites and the Canaanites, such as:\n\nLevirate marriage: This was a custom or a law that required a man to marry the widow of his deceased brother, and to provide offspring for him. This was done to preserve the name and the inheritance of the dead brother, and to ensure the continuity and the solidarity of the family and the tribe. This practice is mentioned in Deuteronomy 25:5–10, and it is also illustrated in the story of Ruth and Boaz. (Ruth 4:1–12)\n\nCult prostitution: This was a religious and a cultural practice that involved sexual activity with a prostitute who served in the fertility rites of the Canaanite religion. The prostitute was considered to be sacred and dedicated to a god or goddess, and the sexual activity was believed to ensure the fertility of the land and the people. This practice is condemned in the Bible as an abomination and a violation of God’s law. (Leviticus 19:29; 20:5–6; Deuteronomy 23:17–18)\n\nPersonal items: These were objects that had an engraved design or inscription, and that were used to stamp or seal documents or objects. They also represented the identity and the authority of the owner, and they were also symbols of ownership and protection. They included items such as a seal, a cord, a staff, a ring, a bracelet, or a cloak. These items are often used as pledges or proofs in the Bible, such as in the story of Judah and Tamar, or in the story of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife. (Genesis 38:18–26; 39:11–18)\n\nHow does Tamar’s deceptive plan reflect on the societal roles and expectations of women during that time?\n\nTamar’s deceptive plan reflects some of the societal roles and expectations of women in the ancient Near East, especially among the Israelites and the Canaanites. Some of the aspects that her plan reveals are:\n\nThe importance of levirate marriage: Tamar’s plan was motivated by her desire to have offspring through her deceased husband’s brother, as was the custom or the law of levirate marriage. This practice was meant to preserve the name and the inheritance of the dead brother, and to ensure the continuity and the solidarity of the family and the tribe. Tamar’s plan shows that she valued this custom and that she was willing to risk her life to fulfill it. (Deuteronomy 25:5–10; Ruth 4:1–12)1\n\nThe vulnerability of widows: Tamar’s plan was also driven by her precarious situation as a widow without children or support. She was dependent on her father-in-law Judah, who failed to provide her with a husband or a livelihood. She was also exposed to the dangers of poverty, violence, and social stigma. Tamar’s plan shows that she was resourceful and courageous, and that she sought to secure her future and her dignity. (Exodus 22:22–24; Deuteronomy 24:17–22)2\n\nThe influence of cult prostitution: Tamar’s plan involved disguising herself as a cult prostitute, who served in the fertility rites of the Canaanite religion. She used this disguise to attract Judah, who was participating in the Canaanite culture and worship. She also used the symbols of a seal, a cord, and a staff, which were associated with cult prostitution and personal identity. Tamar’s plan shows that she was familiar and skilled with the Canaanite practices and beliefs, and that she used them to her advantage. (Leviticus 19:29; 20:5–6; Deuteronomy 23:17–18)34\n\nWhat is the importance of the scarlet thread around the first twin born in Genesis 38:28? How improbable was it that one of the twins was drawn back up during birth?\n\nThe scarlet thread around the first twin born in Genesis 38:28 was a sign of the firstborn status, which carried privileges and responsibilities in the ancient Near East, such as the double portion of inheritance, the leadership of the family, and the blessing of the father. The scarlet thread also foreshadowed the future role and destiny of the twin, who was named Zerah, meaning “brightness”. Zerah was the ancestor of the tribe of Zerah, which produced notable figures such as Achan, the troubler of Israel (Joshua 7:1), and Ethan, the wise man (1 Kings 4:31).\n\nHowever, the scarlet thread also marked the irony and the reversal of the birth order, as the other twin, who was named Perez, meaning “breach”, pushed ahead and came out first. Perez was the actual firstborn, and he became the leader and the ancestor of the tribe of Judah, which produced the royal line of David and Jesus. Perez also foreshadowed the future role and destiny of the Messiah, who is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah, and who came to break through the barriers of sin and death, and to bring forth the brightness of God’s glory and salvation. (Revelation 5:5; Hebrews 2:14–15; 2 Corinthians 4:6)\n\nThe probability of one of the twins being drawn back up during birth is very low, as it is a rare and unusual occurrence. According to one source1, the chances of having a twin reversal during birth are less than 1%. This means that the birth of Perez and Zerah was a remarkable and miraculous event, which demonstrated the power and the sovereignty of God, who can override the natural order and the human expectations, and who can fulfill His promise and His purpose through unexpected and unlikely means. (Isaiah 55:8–9; Romans 9:10–13; Ephesians 1:11)\n\nWhat is the significance of the word breach, the name for Jesus ancestor, Perez, and Jesus discussion of the sheepfold in John Chapter 10?\n\nThe word breach, the name Perez, and the sheepfold in John 10 are all related to the theme of breaking through or making a way where there seems to be none. They also point to the power and the sovereignty of God, who can override the natural order and the human expectations, and who can fulfill His promise and His purpose through unexpected and unlikely means.\n\nThe word breach (פֶּרֶץ, perets, H6556) means a break, a gap, or a rupture in something, such as a wall, a covenant, or a law. It also signifies the act or the result of breaking through, bursting forth, or making a breach. It is often used to describe the judgment or the salvation of God, who can break through the barriers of sin and death, and who can bring forth the blessing and the glory of His kingdom. (Genesis 38:29; Judges 5:17; Psalm 60:2; Isaiah 58:12; Matthew 27:29)1\n\nThe name Perez (פֶּרֶץ, perets, H6557) means “breach”, and it was given to the son of Judah and Tamar, who pushed ahead and came out first, despite having a scarlet thread tied on his brother’s hand. Perez was the actual firstborn, and he became the leader and the ancestor of the tribe of Judah, which produced the royal line of David and Jesus. Perez also foreshadowed the future role and destiny of the Messiah, who is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah, and who came to break through the barriers of sin and death, and to bring forth the brightness of God’s glory and salvation. (Genesis 38:29; Ruth 4:18–22; Matthew 1:3; Luke 3:33; Revelation 5:5)2\n\nThe sheepfold (αὐλὴ, aule, G833) is a fenced enclosure where the sheep are kept for the night. It has a door or a gate, through which the shepherd enters and leads the sheep in and out. The sheepfold also represents the church or the people of God, who are under the care and the protection of the shepherd. Jesus used the image of the sheepfold to contrast Himself with the false leaders, who do not enter by the door, but climb up some other way. He also claimed to be the door of the sheepfold, through which anyone who enters will be saved and will find pasture. He also said that He has other sheep that are not of this fold, and that He will bring them also, and they will hear His voice, and there will be one flock and one shepherd.
