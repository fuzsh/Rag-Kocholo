        "text": "September saw two events on Tiree; both exciting but each very different: at the beginning of the month the first Tiree Ultramarathon organised by Will Wright our very own Tiree superhero and towards the end ‚ÄòRe-Thinking Architecturally‚Äò, a workshop of the European Network of Excellence on Internet Science organised by Clare Hooper from Southampton University. I was lucky enough to take part in both.\n\nIn addition, in a few weeks time (23-27 Oct) there will be the eighth Tiree Tech Wave, which will include participants from Canada, Scotland, Wales and England (but no-one from Ireland yet). As well as the usual unstructured serendipity, we will have some tutorial workshops of 3D scanning, 3D printing and laser cutting ‚Ä¶ but more about that in another post.\n\nThe Tiree Ultra\n\nI should first emphasise that I did not run all of the 35 mile ultra-marathon course around the coast of Tiree, but did about 50:50, walk/run. I‚Äôd never done anything remotely like this before. The longest I‚Äôd run was the Tiree half marathon back in May and the longest I‚Äôd walked during the Wales walk was a 29 mile day (although I did that over more than 12 hours). I had as a schoolboy once done a 34 mile day hike up into the coal valleys above Cardiff, and one of the spurs to sign up for the Ultra was to beat my 17 year old self!\n\nWith my usual level of preparation it came to the beginning of August and I realised I‚Äôd not run at all, nor even taken a walk longer than to the beach and back, since the half-marathon in May. Just before the event I found a couple of sites with training schedules for marathons, all of them were several months long and the ‚Äòbeginner‚Äô level was ‚Äúruns 15-25 miles a week regularly‚Äù ‚Ä¶ what about zero miles a week? Anyway my lengthy one month training schedule consisted mainly of short (2.5 mile) beach runs with the occasional 7.5 mile run to Hynish and towards the end a run of 8.5 miles along part of the route of the Ultra round the base of Ben Hynish. I was aware I‚Äôd not done any really substantial runs and so, rather foolishly, on the Wednesday 4 days before the event I ran (and walked!) 21 miles around part of the route on the east end of the island and down to Hynish and back. A good last run before the event, but one I should have done a week earlier.\n\nSomehow or other, despite my foolish training schedule, I managed to get round without any serious injury. My main problem was eating, or rather failing to eat. I found I could only mange food during walking stages, and then just a small amount of Kendal Mint Cake and few bananas, I guess overall I managed to burn around 4000 calories, but ate less than 1000, which really made the legs start to tire as I got to the latter parts of the course. I‚Äôve already entered for the 2015 Tiree Ultra next September (half the places are already gone and entries have only been open a week), but I will have to work out how to eat better before then. Crucially I got round the course ‚Ä¶ and not even last. The serious contenders managed times not much more than 4 1/2 hours whilst I got round in just over 8:20, but I was simply happy to get to the end.\n\nAlthough it was further and faster than any day walking last year, it was in many ways a lot easier than the Wales walk. About 2/3 of the way round the Tiree course my right ankle and calf started to stiffen, which was where I‚Äôd had Achilles ankle problems a couple of years ago. Although I did try to ease a little I was not terribly worried; the worst would be that I‚Äôd be hobbling for a month or so after the run. In contrast, last year I knew that I would be walking again the next day, and the next,and the one after that; with each ache I worried whether it would be the injury that did not get better, and stopped the walk. And, despite the worry of this, I had also learnt quite how resilient the body is, that most pains and strains did get better, albeit slowly, despite unrelenting exercise.\n\nI was also reminded very much of the walk when I finished. I took off my running shoes and socks, the latter sodden from beach and bog, and filled with fine layer of sand. The soles of my feet, which had been subjected to 35 miles of damp sandpaper, felt like I was walking on coals and I hobbled about between van and Ceadhar where they laid on a post-walk pizza and party. It was just like that so many days last year, I would get to where I was staying, ease off my boots, put on sandals, and then hobble out in search of food, wondering if I would get as far as the closest pub or cafe, let alone walk again the next day.\n\nRe-thinking Architecturally\n\nThe Internet Science workshop was equally enjoyable, but a little less physically challenging! It brought together economists, architects, lawyers, policy advisors, and some with more technical background from as far afield as Umea in northern Sweden. It was lovely being able to attend a technology workshop on Tiree that I hadn‚Äôt organised üôÇ\n\nClare had been to one of the Tiree Tech Waves, and then, when she was organising a workshop for the European Network of Excellence on Internet Science, she thought of Tiree. The logistics were not without problems, but after the event I‚Äôve been getting together with the Tiree Trust to make an information pack for future organisers to make the process easier. So if if you would like to organise an event on Tiree, get in touch!\n\nThe participants all seemed utterly taken with the venue, several brave souls even swimming in the mornings off the Hynish pier, in the words of one of the participants on the way back after the event ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be in Tiree!‚Äù. Another said:\n\n‚Äúone great consequence of the week in Tiree was a kind of intellectual regeneration that let me set aside the stresses of the coming academic year and‚Ä¶think openly a bit.‚Äù\n\nAlison Powell (London School of Economics)\n\nIn fact this is precisely the feedback I get from many who have been to Tiree Tech Wave. It is hard to capture in words the way the open horizon and being at the wild-edge opens up the mind, especially when meeting with others equally committed to exploring new ideas freely and openly.\n\nOne of the memorable moments from the week was a debate of internet freedom and regulation. We started off half on one side half the other and then part way through we all had to swop sides. I can‚Äôt believe how passionate I got about both sides of the argument ‚Ä¶ and I managed to wheel in my school English teacher as authority on benevolent dictatorship .\n\nPeople\n\nWhile two very different events, a common story was the wonderful welcome of the people of Tiree. During the Ulta-marathon, at every way-station there was a glorious array of tray bakes, chocolates, pre-sliced fruit, and above all smiling faces. This was great for me seeing faces I knew, but clearly very special for the participants who came from afar being greeted as if they too were friends. For the Re-thinking Architecturally workshop many people made it a success: the wonderful team at the Hynish Centre, especially Lesley who kept on smiling despite a seven hour wait for participants whose travel was disrupted, everyone at Ceadhar, Ring n Ride, and at the airport re-arranging travel across Europe when the Thursday plane was cancelled.\n\nA combination of things (several rail journeys and flights including two long haul, waits at airports due to snow, an unexpected 2 day diversion to a hotel outside Istanbul again due to snow, a few days illness after Christmas, and a power cut lasting a whole morning) have all meant that I have spent more time reading than usual. Now it is not that I do not want to read, and it has always been one of my chief pleasures, but as an academic, paradoxically, for many years my reading has narrowed to the next report, thesis or paper to review shutting out not just reading for pleasure, but any academic book or article that was not immediately necessary for the next deadline.\n\nHowever, I have been wonderfully forced by circumstances back to the page.\n\nI have already written about one of these ‚ÄúThe Shadow of the Wind‚Äù while I was travelling, itself a book about books, and while travelling I also read Kathryn Harrison‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Thousand Orange Trees‚Äù (an eye opening but unrelentingly depressing vision of women‚Äôs life during the Spanish inquisition), Frank McCourt‚Äôs ‚ÄúAngela‚Äôs Ashes‚Äù (a sometimes depressing, but also glorious account of a hard Irish childhood), Jodi Picoult‚Äôs ‚ÄúChange of Heart‚Äù (on the death penalty and religion) and Elizabeth Gaskell‚Äôs ‚ÄúRuth‚Äù (a wonderful book about the small mindedness and great generosity of the human spirit, especially remarkable when seen against its time).\n\n‚Ä¶ and then I had some new books for Christmas ‚Ä¶\n\nAt first Keith Gray‚Äôs ‚ÄúOstrich Boys‚Äù seems like a classic boy‚Äôs book with three friends ‚Äòkidnapping‚Äô the ashes of their friend Ross in order to give him a proper send off at Ross in Scotland. Like all journey stories, a mixture of going on against the odds and self discovery, not in the league of Cynthia Voigt‚Äôs ‚ÄúHomecoming‚Äú, but more likely to be read by boys wanting a good adventure and being stretched in the process.\n\nMal Peet‚Äôs ‚ÄúTamar‚Äù is clearly for ‚Äòyoung adults‚Äô, a claustrophobic tale of war time resistance in 1945 cut through with a ‚Äòmodern day‚Äô tale. This parallel tale is a hard genre, and, like Joan Lingard ‚ÄúNatasha‚Äôs Will‚Äú, I felt Peet managed the 1945 tale better than the current day one . Although Peet is writing for an older audience, I was reminded of the way Nina Bawden manages to get me to identify, however unwillingly at times, with the flawed characters in her children‚Äôs novels.\n\nSusan Hill‚Äôs ‚ÄúHowards End is on the Landing‚Äù is, like ‚ÄúThe Shadow of the Wind‚Äú, a book about books, but whereas Zafon‚Äôs Novel is set against a fictional library, Susan Hill tells us about her own bookshelves, which seem to coat and fill, like windblown snow, every wall and nook in her house. She decides to spend a year reading only the books she already has on her shelves, a decision that coincides with a resolution to minimise use of the internet:\n\nToo much internet usage fragments the brain and dissipates concentration so that after a while, one‚Äôs ability to spend long, focused hours immersed in a single subject becomes blunted. Information comes pre-digested in small pieces, one grazes on endless ready-meals and snacks of the mind, and the result is mental malnutrition. (p.2)\n\nThis reminds me a little of Andrew Keen‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Cult of the Amateur‚Äù except Susan Hill says it more succinctly and elegantly.\n\nHill‚Äôs reading is both eclectic and catholic, encompassing Ian Flemming along with Trollope and Chaucer. She takes Enid Blyton and J.K. Rowling seriously for their contribution to literacy (although unlike me does not re-read the former), and is happy to say that she never feels comfortable with Austin. As she describes the titles she finds, sometimes lost between unlikely bedfellows, I am inspired to read them all and also to look to my own shelves:\n\nA book which is left on a shelf for a decade is a dead thing, but it is also a chrysalis, packed with the potential to burst into new life. (p.2)\n\nSusan Hill‚Äôs knowledge is amazing and the book is filled with anecdotes about authors she has met, known and corresponded with, giving hints of the inside story of many 20th century writers. Sometimes I am surprised at her choices or rather not what she chooses, but more what she rejects. In her list of books she has not read she includes:\n\nBuddenbrooks. Thomas Mann\n\nI want to read this . I mean to read this. I really do.\n\nbut also:\n\nRomola. George Elliot\n\nI do understand how I can have not read it. (p.70)\n\nWhy? Does she mean she can understand why it has not crossed her path, or that she does not want to read it? It is a book I have re-read several times, although always wishing the ending could be different. I know she does not like ‚ÄúA Tale of Two Cities‚Äù feeling that Dickens is at his best when dealing with (for him) the contemporary; maybe she fears the same is true of Elliot?\n\nHowever, Hill never assumes that her tastes are her readers‚Äô tastes, she does not select the ‚Äògood‚Äô books, but the books she wants to read.\n\nSadly she does not supply a list of all the books she read during the year, but at the end she gives a ‚Äòtop 40‚Äô list, with some I know well such as ‚ÄúThe Mayor of Casterbridge‚Äú, some I know of but have never read, such as ‚ÄúA Passage to India‚Äú, and some I have never heard of such as ‚ÄúFlaubert‚Äôs Parrot‚Äú. An instant Amazon Wish List!\n\nTop of her top 40 are the Book of Common Prayer and the Bible (King James Version) ‚Äî in the text (p173/174) deliberately in that order, but for some reason in the list at the end the Bible comes first, did she rethink after writing, or is it an editorial decision to make the list look neater?\n\nThis reminds me that I need to retrieve my battered school bible from underneath the pew where I left it after the Christmas morning service. Also, the last of my Christmas reading (helped enormously by the enforced internet blackout due to the power cut), a book of Fiona‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhose Bible Is It?‚Äù by a biblical scholar and champion of inter-faith relations Joroslav Pelikan. It is a book about a book, or rather a book about books, as Pelikan reminds us that the word ‚ÄúBible‚Äù strictly means ‚Äúlittle books‚Äù. I know some of the history of the forming of the modern Bible, but Pelikan‚Äôs encyclopaedic and detailed knowledge shines through. I had not realised that it was the Greek Septuagint rather than the Hebrew Tanakh (Old Testament) that is quoted by the New Testament writers, making odd the decision of the early Protestants to excise the ‚ÄòApocrypha‚Äô (the writings in the Septuagint but not in the Hebrew).\n\nIt is a short and very readable book, but at times I found myself wanting to know a little more on some points. When discussing the dates of the Gospels Pelikan notes that Mark is usually dated at 70CE, but doesn‚Äôt explain why. Previously I‚Äôve seen the same date quoted with the reason being that the Gospel appears to predict the fall of Jerusalem which happened in 70AD and therefore must have been written after. This argument seems to presuppose that prediction is impossible and by analogy would inevitably lead to future historians excising or re-dating several of Vince Cable‚Äôs statements prior to the 2008 financial crash. Maybe there is a better reason, or maybe, like other academic disciplines, biblical scholarship is a servant of its assumptions.\n\nAnd now ‚Ä¶ no more power cuts and the internet is flawless, but trying not loose momentum with Sheila Stewart‚Äôs ‚ÄúPilgrims of the Mist‚Äú, Mike Parker‚Äôs ‚ÄúMap Addict‚Äù and George Basalla‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Evolution of Technology‚Äù all on the go ‚Ä¶ maybe another post in a couple of weeks."
