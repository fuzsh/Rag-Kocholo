        "text": "The Swimmers by Julie Otsuka\n\nThe swimmers are unknown to each other except through their private routines (slow lane, fast lane), and the solace each takes in their morning or afternoon laps. But when a crack appears at the bottom of the pool, they are cast out into an unforgiving world. One of these swimmers is Alice, who is slowly losing her memory. For Alice, the pool was a final stand against the darkness of her encroaching dementia. Without the fellowship of other swimmers and the routine of her daily laps she is plunged into dislocation and chaos, swept into memories of her childhood and the Japanese American incarceration camp in which she spent the war. Alice's estranged daughter, reentering her mother's life too late, witnesses her devastating decline.\n\nLook Both Ways: A Tale Told in Ten Blocks by Jason Reynolds\n\nJason Reynolds conjures ten tales (one per block) about what happens after the dismissal bell rings, and weaves them into one funny, poignant look at the detours we face on the walk home, and in life.\n\nLark by Anthony McGowan\n\nThings are getting tense at home for Nicky and Kenny as they wait for a visit from their estranged mum.

Nothing will ever be quite the same again ...\n\nThe Poet X by Elizabeth Acevedo\n\nXiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood.

With Mami's determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself. When she is invited to join her school's slam poetry club, she knows that she could never get around Mami's rules to attend, much less speak her words out loud. But still, she can't stop thinking about performing her poems. Because in spite of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent.\n\nWhere the World Ends by Geraldine McCaughrean; illustrated by Jane Milloy\n\nEvery time a lad came fowling on the stacs, he went home less of a boy and more of a man.
