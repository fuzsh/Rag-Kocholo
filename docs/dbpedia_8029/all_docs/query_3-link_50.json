        "text": "Dead End in Norvelt – Jack Gantos\n\nWinner of the Newbery Medal 2012, Washington Post Best Children’s Book of 2011.\n\nMiddle Grade – Readers 10 – 13+\n\nWhen Jack Gantos was seven, his favourite game was to pretend he was on fire and roll down a hill to put the flames out – and that explains a lot, really. There’s not a lot of time to reflect, in his novels. Usually, you’re on fire and rolling down the hill before you’ve really decided whether or not you’re going to play the game. Things happen at break neck speed, with the odd pause to get yourself back up to the top of the hill, ready to roll for your life again. (This game, by the way, never seems to wear out. I watched a group of 8 year olds playing it the other day. Do you remember the sheer pleasure of seeing how fast you could roll, how many kids you could bump into on the way, and the smell of the grass – especially if it was damp and had just been cut.)\n\nThis novel has more than an element of the ‘do you remember’ about it. It is nostalgic for 1962, small town, America. Norvelt has a special history in that it was founded by Eleanor Roosevelt (hence Norvelt) for families who were struggling financially. To be honest, at times it does feel a little self-conscious about ensuring you know when it is set – for example, ‘It was a good thing John Glenn had orbited the earth back in February.’ And, of course, JFK is still alive. But it does well to introduce a version of the early 1960’s small town America to today’s young readers. ‘My uncle who had painted the pony claimed he had seen a UFO come down over that very same hill before the drive-in was built. He was in the newspaper and said he had ‘touched’ the UFO and that it was ‘covered in a strange Martian language that looked like chicken feet.’ My dad called my uncle a nut, but it wasn’t so nutty when the army sent troops and a big truck to take the mysterious UFO away and afterward military police went door-to-door to all the little towns around here, warning people not to talk about ‘the fallen object’ with any strangers as they might be Russian spies.’ Without going into the politics in depth, the reader gets a sense of the cold war, space as the next frontier, and a more censored world, possible in a less technological era.\n\nIt is the golden rule of middle grade fiction that, if you haven’t killed off the parents, they must be incredibly unfair, and unwilling to listen to reason. Certainly they will be misguided. Maybe they are even a bit mad. Probably they are so busy in their own lives that they barely notice the antics of the hero, who has the mindboggling challenge of needing to put the world to rights, without anyone noticing that it wasn’t right in the first place. No one must know anything is wrong, because usually it is the fault of the hero, who had a misguided moment of klutziness, whilst doing something forbidden. Things get worse before they get better, despite the best intentions of our hero, but in the end… well, I’d hate to ruin a good story, so I’ll stop right there.\n\nJack is not so much a klutz, as a bit day dreamy, ‘because my mind wanders in the morning my feet are always a few steps ahead of me…’ When we first meet him he is on a picnic table in his back yard, with his father’s WW2 Japanese war souvenirs, watching a drive-in war movie, using the Japanese binoculars. Jack also has his father’s sniper rifle, and the movie enemies are for target practice, ‘because Dad said I had to get ready to fight off the Russian Commies who had already sneaked into the country and were planning to launch a surprise attack.’ Jack doesn’t realise that the rifle is loaded and one thing leads to another, which leads to Miss Volker dropping her hearing aid down the toilet, and the town plumber, who is also the local ambulance driver, roaring up to Miss Volker’s house in the ambulance to help.\n\nMom now has Jack over a barrel, so to speak, since Dad will blow a fuse if he knows Jack has been playing with his war souvenirs, and especially that he broke the rifle safety rules. Jack is mystified as to how the gun came to be loaded, but accepts the error of his ways, and the inevitability of a severe consequence. Mom grounds him until his father returns, with the only exception being that he is allowed to leave the house to help out their eccentric octogenarian neighbour, Miss Volker. It turns out that Miss Volker needs him because, due to her severely arthritic hands, she is unable to write anymore. She has Jack scribe the obituaries of the elderly townspeople, who suddenly seem to be dropping like flies.\n\nUnfortunately for Jack, when Dad comes back he has an agenda of his own that involves Jack mowing down Mom’s cornfield. Dad says Jack must mow it down. Mom says Jack mustn’t. The reader knows Jack can’t win this one, and feels the injustice. Jack mows down the corn and is grounded for the rest of summer, by his mother. Jack’s adventures might well make a great read aloud – if you can stand all the blood and gory bits – Jack’s nose bleeds constantly, his best friend’s father owns a funeral parlour, a Hell’s Angel motorcycle club member is flattened by a truck, and several elderly residents are found dead. Jack’s errands for Miss Volker are often dubious, if not downright dangerous and law breaking. He dresses up as the grim reaper to break into a house where Miss Volker suspects a senior citizen lies dead. She needs him to check, so that she can write the obit. He drives her car round town at break neck speed, and buys 1080 poison from the hardware store to kill the rats in her basement. There is also the mystery of why the town’s elderly are suddenly dying…\n\nI have a couple of boys lined up to read this one over the next couple of weeks – they have already read the blurb and are keen. I’m keen to see what they think. I think it’s a great read, but I’m interested to know if there’s just a bit much history tucked into the book. As any parent knows, there are only so many green things you can hide in something yummy before it is spotted for the vegetable that it is.\n\nSpeaking of which, here’s a titbit for the Kiwi’s. Jack is reading about Kennedy during WW2. Apparently, ‘Kennedy and his torpedo boat crew were on night patrol in the sea around the Solomon Islands when a Japanese destroyer came roaring at full speed out of the mist and sliced their boat clean in half. Eleven men survived the collision but some were burned badly from the fuel fire that took place after the crash. Kennedy had been hurled across the deck and fractured a vertebrae in his back but he could still move.\n\n…Kennedy tied one end of a belt onto the most wounded man’s lifejacket and put the other end of the belt in his own mouth and swam the breaststroke for five hours before he got the man to the island. There was no food or fresh water…(lots of things happen and many days pass but…) But just before the men lost all hope, the native islanders tracked them down. They were friendly and wanted to help so Kennedy scratched a rescue note on a coconut and gave it to the islanders, who paddled their war canoe to an Allied base. More days passed, and just when Kennedy and his men thought they all would die, they were rescued by soldiers from New Zealand.’\n\nThere is a sequel to this book, ‘From Norvelt to Nowhere’, so if this goes down well, then I may buy it.\n\nRead some other reviews here:\n\nBetsy Bird’s Review\n\nBook Browsers Review\n\nI was in my favourite bookshop yesterday, Paige’s Book Gallery, gathering another pile to read. Lesley and I got to chatting about books, and she said that “Into the River” was now classified R14. Now, my mother was on the Film and Lit Review Board for quite a few years, so I know these decisions aren’t taken lightly, but I think this probably opens a whole new can of worms for the NZ Post Children’s Book Awards, and its categories. It also demands the question, if this book needs to be rated so that children won’t buy it, aren’t there a whole lot of other books in bookshops that need a rating?? What happens with Fifty Shades, for example. It would be bizarre to sell it to young children (under 14) – but it’s not illegal, like selling Into the River would be. And, let’s be honest, being illegal may well have just upped the kudos of the book as well.\n\nI don’t want all the books that win prizes to be sanitised, so I still think that if the judges thought this book merited a prize, it should have got a prize. It’s just that everyone in the category it won a prize in, should be legally allowed to read the book that won! But with the categories as they are, we keep running the risk of excluding the 12 – 14yr old category, or the 8 – 10 yr category. These are critical reading ages for children to be exposed to great literature so that they are motivated to continue reading into a life long habit.\n\nAdults who were readers by choice as children and young adults, in study after study after study, have been shown to earn more, have more employment choices, and generally have more positive life trajectories that those who weren’t. The ‘reading slump’ is a well documented phenomenon, and occurs during the intermediate (Year 7 and 8) and early secondary years (Year 9 and 10). Good quality writing, both fiction and non-fiction, is vital. But what would be appropriate for one group, is just not for the other. Developmentally, these two age groups are very different readers.\n\nWhat is the purpose of book awards? Sure, they critically acclaim the writer and the book, and that’s a great thing because, for most writers in New Zealand, the hourly rate is rubbish. And as any good behaviourialist knows, everyone needs positive reinforcement of some kind. But, let’s be honest, mostly it’s a commercial exercise. Lesley, at Paige’s, has had ‘The Luminaries’, recent winner of the Booker, positively flying out the door. Teachers, librarians, parents and other people who control the book buying in children’s lives, rely on book awards for guidance. We can’t possibly read every book – no matter how hard we try!\n\nI have advocated for this before, but I really think that there should be four fiction categories in the NZ POST Children’s Book Awards:\n\n– picture books (everyone!)\n\n– junior fiction (8+)\n\n– intermediate fiction (11+)\n\n– young adult (14+)\n\nRead below the decision by the Film and Literature Review Board to restrict sales of ‘Into the River’ by Ted Dawe\n\nInto the River\n\nR14 Parental advisory explicit content (Film and Literature Board of Review decision)\n\nDate Registered: 08/01/2014\n\nInto the River is a book by New Zealand author Ted Dawe. In September 2013 it was classified as unrestricted by the Classification Office after being submitted by the Department of Internal Affairs because of a complaint from a member of the public.\n\nAn application was made to the Film and Literature Board of Review for a review of the Classification Office’s decision. The Board of Review classified the book as R14.\n\nHow a review works\n\nWhen conducting a review of a Classification Office decision, the Board carries out its own examination of the publication and applies the classification criteria to assign a classification. This process can result in the Board assigning a higher, lower, or same classification as the Classification Office.\n\nThe book’s plot:\n\nThe novel is centred on Te Arepa Santos, a boy from a fictional village on the East Coast of the North Island in New Zealand/Aotearoa. He wins a scholarship to a boys’ boarding school in Auckland, and the transition is difficult. He forges friendships, finds enemies, and discovers that his Maori identity is discounted and a disadvantage. He endures the bullying that comes from this, as well as that meted out to new boys, and sees what happens when that bullying goes too far. There are confusing encounters with sex and a growing understanding of intimacy, the use of drugs, peer pressure, deep racism, grief and death.\n\nDecision summary\n\nThe Film and Literature Board of Review noted in its decision that the book contains themes of bullying, underage casual and unsafe sex, drug taking and other matters that people may find offensive and upsetting. The Board considered that the book is likely to educate and inform young adults about the potentially negative consequences that can follow from involvement in casual sex, underage drinking, drug taking, crime, violence and bullying. The Board also considered that the book serves a useful social purpose in raising these issues for thought and debate and creating a context which may help young adults think more deeply about the immediate and long term consequences of choices they may be called upon to make.\n\nHowever, there are scenes in the book that are powerful and disturbing, and in the opinion of the Board run a real risk of shocking and disturbing young readers. Whilst those aged 14 and above are likely to have a level of maturity that enables them to deal with this, those below the age of 14 may not.\n\nThe Film and Literature Board of Review classified the book as objectionable except if the publication is restricted to persons who have attained the age of 14 years. The Board also requires that any further publications of the book carry the same descriptive note as the present publication, reading “parental advisory explicit content”.\n\nWhat does this decision mean?\n\nThe Board of Review decision replaces the one by the Classification Office. It is illegal for anyone, including parents and guardians, to supply Into the River to anyone under the age of 14.\n\nKeeper – Mal Peet (2004)\n\nAwards: Branford Boase (2004); German Youth Literature Award (2007).\n\nI bought this book because I had recently heard Mal Peet and his wife, Elspeth Graham, interviewed on Saturday Mornings with Kim Hill, NZ National Radio: http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/player/2558762\n\nI remembered having read Tamar, his Carnegie Award winning book, and loving it. I also have a young man in one of my English classes who is football/soccer mad. He has finished reading the ‘Goal!’ series and I was looking for something that might capture his imagination (and have more to follow). And the reality is that a lot of books that are specifically written for kids who love sports but don’t love reading, are of a pretty poor quality – which is frustrating. I believe that to get children to love reading, they need to be exposed to quality writing. Just like you can’t expect to get a beautiful sound out of a poor quality instrument, why would someone who only gets to read pedestrian writing learn to love reading!\n\nThis book certainly didn’t start out the way I had expected. Faustino is a sports journalist interviewing El Gato, goalkeeper of the winning World Cup team. This is to be a front page story, and Faustino knows exactly how he wants it to go. He wants the story of El Gato’s journey from poverty to fame and fortune. The only trouble is, El Gato doesn’t seem to want to play the game Faustino’s way. He starts telling the story of how he came to be the one of a kind goal keeper, with seemingly superhuman powers, that he is, and it’s a story that’s hard to swallow. It seems that this mythical goal keeper might not quite have a secure grip on reality.\n\nI shared Faustino’s concern, initially. I was completely taken by surprise. I was sceptical. I was anxious. Faustino was worried about the sanity of his football hero. I was worried about the credibility of this author. Like Faustino, I decided to play along with the story – to hear El Gato out. Certainly I was enjoying the language. Mal Peet writes evocatively – he draws you right into a story:\n\nStanding there, with its back to the trees, was a goal. A soccer goal. Two uprights and a crossbar. With a net. A net fixed up like the old-fashioned ones, pulled back and tied to two poles behind the goal. My brain stood still in my head. (Don’t you just love that image? My brain stood still in my head…Wow!) I could hear the thumping of my blood. I must have looked like an idiot, my eyes mad and staring, my mouth hanging open. Eventually I found the nerve to take a few steps toward this goal, this quite impossible goal. The woodwork was a silvery grey, and the grain of the wood was open and rough. Weathered, like the timber of old boats left for years on the beach. It shone slightly. The net had the same colour, like cobwebs, and thin green plant tendrils grew up the two poles that supported it.\n\nIt seemed to take an age, my whole life, to walk into that goalmouth. When I got there, I put out my hands and held the net. It was sound and strong, despite its great age. I was completely baffled and stood there, my fingers in the mesh of the net and my back to the clearing, trying, and failing, to make sense of all this.\n\nPeet says that he has long since got tired of categorising by age or genre. And this is apparent in ‘Keeper’. There is enough about football in this book for any avid football fan to love. But I don’t love football – at all. And I really loved this book. I highly recommend it. Somehow, the weirdness works and becomes fantastically believable…Read Jan Mark’s review at the following link:\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview3\n\nJourney to the River Sea – Eva Ibbotson (2001)\n\nI found this book because I was looking for something for my Year 7 classes to read that sat well with their Humanities topic, Source to Sea. Last term their Humanities topic was Rainforests. So, being about a girl who moves from London to the Amazon Rainforest of Brazil, this seemed to fit the bill quite well. Sure, the main character’s a girl, but, oh well, if it turns out to be a bit girlie – the boys will just have to cope with it. After all, they have read Boy Overboard and Kensuke’s Kingdom so far this year. Both have boy protagonists. So it’s time for the girls.\n\nMind you, the boys are not going to be impressed when they see the cover. It’s apricot with two butterflies on it. And it has a gold sticker, which means it’s won an award, which means it’s a ‘good’ book. How many signs does a boy need?\n\nAnd the first line’s not going to lug them in, either. ‘It was a good school, one of the best in London.’ Oh dear. Not exactly, ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,’ is it?! I know they are going to look at me with big eyes, thinking, ‘really, Mrs OW…’ They will howl, ‘It is a terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day! We’re going to move to Timbuktu.’\n\nAnd I will have to say, ‘Be still, wild things,’ just to mix up the picture book allusions a little, and convince them that even though this book is set (initially) in the Mayfair Academy for Young Ladies, in 1910 London, and even though the main character is a girl who is an orphan, whose best friend is called Hermione, who is about to meet her twin girl cousins Gwendolyn and Beatrice, they will love this book. Even though she has a Governess. Called Miss Minton.\n\nI will have to remind them that they thought they were too big to enjoy ‘Eeyore’s Birthday,’ and yet when I read it to them they begged for more. And when we were talking about The Indian in the Cupboard the other day, they suddenly realised that Omri was just like Eeyore putting the popped balloon into the empty honey jar, when he put his plastic Indian into the cupboard.\n\nThey will have to trust me, even though in their hearts they will be wondering why I am using their valuable reading time for this when they could be reading Percy Jackson, or Artemis Fowl, or for those boys who love realistic fiction, a good Des Hunt adventure! But, like The Little Train That Could, I think I can, I think I can…\n\nAnd I think I can because this is a wonderful book. It is a real, not-old-fashioned adventure. Maia turns out to be gutsy and intelligent, and Miss Minton, her governess does a nice turn in wryness and dryness, with enough sceptical tolerance of those too wealthy for their own good, to make her very likeable indeed. Thank goodness there are some great boy characters in Clovis King and Finn Taverner, as well.\n\nEssentially, the plot goes something like this (without too many spoilers, I hope). Maia is at boarding school in London, but her guardian has been looking for family to take care of her, since her parents died in a train crash two years before. Finally, he locates distant family living in Manaus, in the Brazilian Rainforest. Maia is the kind of girl who tries to make the best of things, but is very human, too. When she meets her governess and leaves school with her friends waving goodbye:\n\n‘Doesn’t she look fierce?’ whispered Melanie.\n\n‘Poor you,’ mumbled Hermione.\n\nAnd indeed the tall, gaunt woman looked more like a rake or a nutcracker than a human being.\n\nThe door of the cab opened. A hand in a black glove, bony and cold as a skeleton, was stretched out to help her in. Maia took it and, followed by the shrieks of her schoolmates, they set off.\n\nFor the first part of the journey Maia kept her eyes on the side of the road. Now that she was really leaving her friends it was hard to hold back her tears.\n\nShe had reached the gulping stage when she heard a loud snapping noise and turned her head. Miss Minton had opened the metal clasp of her large black handbag and was handing her a clean handkerchief embroidered with the initial ‘A’.\n\n‘Myself,’ said the governess in her deep, gruff voice, ‘I would think how lucky I was. How fortunate.’\n\n‘To go to the Amazon, you mean?’\n\n‘To have so many friends who were sad to see me go.’\n\n‘Didn’t you have friends who minded you leaving?’\n\nMiss Minton’s lips twitched for a moment.\n\n‘My sister’s budgerigar, perhaps. If he had understood what was happening. Which is extremely doubtful’\n\nAnd so begins the peculiar friendship of Miss Minton and Maia. We know they are like minded, because at the end of chapter one, when a porter goes to pick up Miss Minton’s trunk,\n\n‘You’ll need two men for that,’ said the governess.\n\nThe porter look offended. ‘Not me. I’m strong.’\n\nBut when he came to lift the trunk, he staggered.\n\n‘Crikey, Ma’am, what have you got in there?’ he asked.\n\nMiss Minton looked at him haughtily and did not answer. Then she led Maia onto the platform where the train waited to take them to Liverpool and then the RMS Cardinal bound for Brazil.\n\nThey were steaming out of the station before Maia asked, ‘Was it books in the trunk?’\n\n‘It was books,’ admitted Miss Minton.\n\nAnd Maia said, ‘Good.’\n\nThe pacing is perfect. We learn so much from what is not said. Miss Minton is not your average governess and Maia is not your average Young Lady.\n\nOn the boat to Brazil, Maia makes friends with Clovis King, a young actor heartily homesick for London. On arriving in Brazil she discovers that things are not quite as she had hoped they would be, and while not quite Cinderella, there is enough reference for even young children to see the twins as the ugly sisters. But Maia is no Cinderella, waiting for a fairy godmother to fix everything for her.\n\nMaia meets a mysterious young boy, when she is exploring the forest near her new home, and a wonderful adventure begins, with as many twists and turns as any good river may be expected to have. As Books for Keeps says, ‘This is a thoroughly enjoyable yarn, veering between farce and tragedy, and peopled with highly quixotic but believable characters It revels in the joy and the danger of exploration…Very highly recommended.’\n\nAnd for someone who enjoys books to reference other literature, this one surely does. Little Lord Fauntleroy is the play that Clovis is in. Macbeth is also put on by the acting company on the boat, in another example of the pithy Miss Minton:\n\n‘Mrs Goodley was Lady Macbeth of course and Maia thought she was very stirring, tottering about all over the place and muttering ‘Out damned spot’ with a terrible leer. So she was rather hurt when Miss Minton, who had been reading, closed her book and got ready to go below.\n\n‘Don’t you like Shakespeare?’ asked Maia.\n\nMiss Minton gave her a look. ‘I rank Shakespeare second only to God,’ she said. ‘Which is why I am going to my cabin.’\n\nLater, when Maia is at her cousins, the Carters, there is a lovely scene where Mrs Carter, who loathes insects with a passion and a flit gun is chasing around in the early morning:\n\nIn the corridor, wearing a dressing gown and a turban to protect her hair, was Mrs Carter. She had the flit gun in her hand and was carefully squirting every nook and cranny with insect killer. Then she disappeared into the cloakroom, fetched a broom, and began to thump and bang on the ceiling to get rid of possible spiders. Next came a bucket of disinfectant and a mop with which she squelched across the tiled floor – and all the time she muttered, ‘Out!’\n\nIt is hard not to remember Lady Macbeth, and particularly Mrs Goodley’s interpretation, and of course the foreshadowing of madness to come.\n\nThis book was second in running for the Whitbread Children’s Book of the Year (2001) and the Guardian Fiction Award (2001). As judge Anne Fine says: But we all (the judges Anne Fine, Jacqueline Wilson and Philip Pullman) fell on Eva Ibbotson’s perfectly judged, brilliantly light to read, civilised Journey To The River Sea, in which we are shown how, as one of the characters reminds us, “Children must lead big lives… if it is in them to do so.” Oh, please let her write another book as fine as this, because, in any other year, we would have handed her the prize without a thought.\n\nRead the Guardian article here: http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/oct/09/guardianchildrensfictionprize2001.awardsandprizes18\n\nThis is a book well worth a read by children and by their parents!\n\nThe Unforgotten Coat – Frank Cottrell Boyce (2011)\n\nWinner of the Guardian Children’s Fiction Prize, 2012.\n\nShortlisted for the Costa Children’s Book Awards, 2011.\n\nShort, short, short review: Odd, strangely compelling, mysterious, beautifully written, gorgeous production. Absolutely worth a read for the story, the message and the images. 5/5 stars.\n\nLonger review:\n\nFrank Cottrell Boyce wrote this book in response to a true story from his first author visit to a primary school, Joan of Arc Primary, in Bootle, England. He says:\n\n‘The thing I remember most is meeting a girl called Misheel. She was a refugee from Mongolia and she just lit up the room…Then one day the Immigration Authorities came and snatched her and her family in the middle of the night. Misheel managed to get one phone call through to Sue Kendall before one of the officers grabbed her phone. And of course she has not been seen since. I don’t know much about immigration policy or the politics of our relationship with Mongolia. Maybe there is some complicated reason why a depopulated and culturally deprived area like Bootle shouldn’t be allowed generous and brilliant visitors. I do know that a country that authorises its functionaries to snatch children from their beds in the middle of the night can’t really be called civilized.’\n\nHe also wrote this book to support The Reader Organisation www.thereader.org.uk. 50 000 copies of this book were given away in the UK. “It wasn’t a commercial book at all – it came from a very different place,” he said. “The Reader Organisation promotes reading to all kinds of different groups, from kids with difficulties to alcoholics, and they were looking for a book which would cross all the groups. They found it very difficult to find, so I wrote this as a gift.” And what a gift it is.\n\nI read and loved ‘Millions’, which won the Carnegie Medal in 2004. Cottrell Boyce has a gift for telling a great story, and his children’s voices are utterly believable. He does have seven children aged between 8 and 27, the youngest of whom are homeschooled, so I guess that there is plenty of opportunity for hearing the way children say things.\n\nIn ‘The Unforgotten Coat’ Julie tells the story of two Mongolian boys who arrived at her school rather mysteriously, when she was in Year Six. Now working, she visits her old school, because it was about to be knocked down, ‘and there at the back of our old classroom was a big blue plastic tub with LOST PROPERTY written on it. Mostly trainers and socks and a few books, a lockable Miffy diary, a couple of In the Night Garden lunchboxes. And the coat.\n\nThe unforgettable coat of Chingis Tuul.’\n\n(The contents of the lost property box are so authentic, I wonder if the author went and inspected a real one!!)\n\nJulie finds some pictures from an old polaroid camera in one of the pockets, and it brings back memories. ‘It was the second week of the summer term. During morning break, Mimi spotted two kids – one big and one little, the big one holding the little one’s hand – staring through the railings of the playground. The little one was wearing a furry hat and they had identical coats. Mad coats – long, like dressing gowns, with fur inside. But any coat would have looked mad. The sun was beating down. The tarmac in the car park was melting. Everyone else was wearing T-shirts.’\n\nThe children go into class and the teacher, Mrs Spendlove, tries to get the little one to take his hat off. Stig-like, the little brother does not speak. Chingis, the big one, does the talking to the teacher.\n\n‘I take off his hat,’ he continued, ‘maybe he will go insane and kill everyone.’\n\nHe was definitely threatening her . Threatening all of us. With his little brother.\n\n‘Chingis…’\n\n‘When you need your eagle to be calm, what do you do?’\n\n‘I don’t know.’ She looked around the class. Did anyone know? Why would anyone know?’\n\n‘Of course,’ he said, ‘You cover its eyes with a hood. When you want the eagle to fly and kill, you take off the hood. My brother is my eagle. With his hood on, he is calm enough. Without his hood, I don’t know what he will be like.’\n\nYear Six. We had been at school for six years and until that moment I thought I had probably learned all I would ever need to learn. I knew how to work out the volume of a cube. I knew who had painted the ‘Sunflowers’. I could tell you the history of St Lucia. I knew about lines of Tudors and lines of symmetry and the importance of eating five portions of fruit a day. But in all that time, I had never had a single lesson in eagle-calming. I had never even heard the subject mentioned. I’d had no idea that a person might need eagle-calming skills.\n\nAnd in that moment, I felt my own ignorance spread suddenly out behind me like a pair of wings, and every single thing I didn’t know was a feather on those wings. I could feel them tugging at the air, restless to be airborne.’\n\nThe quality of writing is poetic, and entertaining. I love the irony here, with what Julie thinks is important to know, and the discovery that other kinds of knowledge might be even more important.\n\nChingis is one smart cookie, serious and inscrutable. He asks Julie to be their Good Guide, to help them make their way in this place. Julie is completely caught up in his thrall. They boys are exotic and mysterious and she wants to know more. She researches Mongolia and lobbies for the class assembly to be ‘All About Mongolia’, thinking Chingis might join in or even be pleased. But he did nothing. Later she realises that she had been wanting him to turn her into ‘some kind of Mongolian Princess but instead he was turning into a Scouser*.’ Julie is desperate to find their Xanadu, in Bootle. But, every time she comes up with a plan to find out more, Chingis neatly sidesteps.\n\nHe tells Julie and her mum that Nergui believes he is being chased by a demon. ‘It’s in disguise. It looks like an ordinary man.’\n\nAdults are beginning to get the idea. Children may still be just enjoying the telling of the story. But there is beginning to be a more foreboding tone to it – slightly less gentle. But still humorous.\n\nThe production of this book is something beautiful, too. It is printed on lined pages, as if it were the pages of a notebook. There are Polaroid photos ‘stuck’ in the book, worthy of some time spent looking at them. I can imagine some great photography club work coming out of them. The cover of the book is textured, like cloth, and the title is embossed (if that’s the right word), so there is a lovely feel to it. I think that children of about 8-12yrs could manage to read this easily on their own, however, I do think they would benefit from reading with an adult.\n\nSome reviews by children can be read here.\n\nAnd some information about Frank Cottrell Boyce can be read here.\n\n*Scouser – stereotypical inhabitant of Liverpool,\n\nChains – Laurie Halse Anderson (2009).\n\nNational Book Award Nominee for Young People’s Literature (2008), Scott O’Dell Award (2009), Cybils Award for Middle Grade Fiction (2009), An ALA Notable Children’s Book for Older Readers (2009), Rebecca Caudill Young Reader’s Book Award Nominee (2011) …more\n\nSouth Carolina Book Award Nominee for Junior Book Award (2011), TAYSHAS High School Reading List (2010)\n\nLaurie Halse Anderson is not a writer I had read before this book. The book was recommended to me by a young reader in one of my English classes. Since it was the 4th of July that day, and since I don’t know an awful lot about the Revolutionary War for American Independence, I thought I would give it a go.\n\n‘Chains’ is the story of Isabel (13) and Ruth (5), slaves to Miss Mary Finch, 1776. Isabel narrates the story, with an intelligent, observant and challenging voice. At the beginning of the book we are at the funeral of Miss Mary Finch, with the Pastor and Mr Robert Finch, Mary’s nephew.\n\n[Mr Robert] had showed up a few weeks earlier to visit Miss Mary Finch, his aunt and only living relation. He looked around her tidy farm, listened to her ragged, wet cough, and moved in. Miss Mary wasn’t even cold on her deathbed when he helped himself to the coins in her strongbox.\n\nThe first sense we get of the terrible lack of empowerment for slaves is when Isabel wants to run ahead of the coffin to visit the grave of her mother. The Pastor has to ask for permission for her to do this, since Isabel does not even have the right to speak to a white man.\n\n‘The child wants to run ahead,’ Pastor explained to him. ‘She has kin buried there. Do you give leave for a quick visit?’\n\nMr Robert’s mouth tightened like a rope pulled taut.\n\nWhat an image – the rope – symbolic not just of the tethering of slave to the white man, but the implicit image of a man’s right to make a decision about a girl’s life, and, of course, hanging. In just one line, the author demonstrates vividly the power the white man has and the threat of danger for Isabel, or any slave, in the smallest of actions.\n\nAt first, Isabel believes that she and Ruth are now freed. After all, Miss Mary Finch had freed the girls in her will and the will was with her lawyer. And again, here are some of the profound truths of slavery. There are so many people in this book who are in a position to help Isabel, but they either can’t summon the energy, or are too afraid for their own position. Here, Pastor Weeks, whom we should assume perhaps as a man of the cloth, is a good man, listens to Isabel, and initially tries to reason with Mr Robert.\n\nPastor Weeks held up his hand. ‘It’s true. Your aunt had some odd notions. She taught the child [to read] herself. I disapproved, of course. Only leads to trouble.’\n\nI spoke up again. ‘We’re to be freed, sir. The lawyer, Mr Cornell, he’ll tell you. Ruth and me, we’re going to get work and a place of our own to sleep.’\n\nUnfortunately for Isabel and Ruth, the lawyer left for Boston before the blockade.\n\n‘The girl is lying, then,’ Mr Robert said. ‘She knows the lawyer is absent and her cause cannot be proved. The sooner I’m rid of her, the better.’\n\n…Pastor Weeks fumbled with the latch on his Bible. ‘You and your sister belong to Mr Robert now. he’ll be a good master to you.’…The minister placed the Bible in his leather satchel and pulled it up over his shoulder. He studied the ground, his hands, Mr Robert’s horse and the clouds. He did not look at me. ‘You’ll be wanting to bring their shoes and blankets,’ he finally said. ‘They’ll fetch a better price that way.’\n\nEssentially Ruth and Isabel are treated as possessions, and not even possessions of value. They end up being bought by Mister and Missus Lockton, supporters of the King, and are taken to New York. Mr Lockton is not as cruel and malicious towards the girls as Missus Lockton, but he is apathetic towards the girls’ care. Missus Lockton addresses her lack of power and the cruel behaviour of her husband towards her in her treatment of the girls.\n\nSeveral dreadful incidents occur. Isabel decides that she needs to take action, and becomes a spy for the Patriots. How dangerous this was cannot be underestimated. And you really feel the danger in this book, illustrated through the writing:\n\n‘I had only to open the gate latch and step out.\n\nMy hand would not move.\n\nIf I opened the gate I would be a criminal. Slaves were not allowed out after sunset without a pass from a master. Anyone who caught me could take me to the jail. If I opened the gate, a judge could order me flogged. If I opened the gate, there was no telling what punishment Madam would demand.\n\nIf I opened the gate, I might die of fright.\n\nI leaned my head against the gate. I could not open the gate, but I had to open the gate.\n\nI learned a lot about the Revolutionary War and the treatment of slaves as I read, although, not being American, it could get confusing at times. I suspect children reading this might need some background knowledge to help with their comprehension.\n\nThe quotes at the beginning of the chapters were interesting, and helped me to contextualise events a little, although I did still have to do a little bit of online research to get my head around some critical dates.\n\nI highly recommend this book, although with some of the violent acts in it, I feel it needs to be read with a parent or teacher if the children are younger, providing opportunity to discuss the context of these actions, or children from about 10+yrs could read it independently.\n\nThere is a very good summary of the book, and the violent acts in it as the following link: Parental Book Reviews – Chains\n\nBetsy Bird, of fuse8productions also reviews the book here.\n\nNow, I am off to watch ‘Lincoln’ in the hope that it furthers my American History education somewhat.\n\nThe One and Only Ivan – Katherine Applegate\n\nNewbery Medal (2013), School Library Journal Best of Children’s Books (2012), Kirkus Reviews Best of Children’s Books (2012)\n\nHello\n\nI am Ivan. I am a gorilla.\n\nIt’s not as easy as it looks.\n\nIvan is a silverback, to be more specific. His story is told in a series of short chapters, or maybe ‘concepts’ is a better description (Hello, Names, Patience, How I Look…and so on). As the Awards list at the top of this review suggests, this is a critically acclaimed book. More important to me is that it was referred to me by an 11yr old boy, who claims he does not like reading all that much*. If he only reads books as good as this one, I’m a happy teacher!\n\nThe One and Only Ivan is told from the perspective of Ivan, the silverback Gorilla. Ivan communicates to the reader through verse, which act as a sort of series of mind moments, in that each verse sentence presents an idea. Because it is written in verse, the effect is as though each sentence is a complete thought that a flashlight is shone upon for a moment, so that we can see it. They are visual, apparently simple, and yet they say so much more than what is said:\n\n‘In my domain, I have a tyre swing, a baseball, a tiny plastic pool filled with dirty water, and even an old TV.\n\nI have a stuffed toy gorilla too. Julia, the daughter of the weary man who cleans the mall each night, gave it to me.\n\nThe gorilla has empty eyes and floppy limbs, but I sleep with it every night. I call it Not-Tag.\n\nTag was my twin sister’s name.\n\nJulia is ten years old. She has hair like black glass and a wide half-moon smile. She and I have a lot in common. We are both great apes, and we are both artists.’\n\nThe power of presenting each of these ideas in this way is that there is no judgement. Ivan simply tells us his truths, and as the reader we draw our own conclusions. You feel, as a reader, that there are acres of ideas between each statement. The ideas need white space around them because the truths they tell are much bigger than the words used to tell them.\n\nWe also enjoy old western movies. In a western, someone always says, “This town ain’t big enough for the both of us, Sheriff.” In a western, you can tell who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, and the good guys always win.\n\nBob says westerns are nothing like real life.\n\nIvan was captured as a baby and sold to Mack as a pet. Mack tries to care for him, but in the end Mack’s wife leaves him and Ivan grows too big to be kept at home.\n\nMack grew sullen. I grew bigger. I became what I was meant to be, too large for chairs, too strong for hugs, too big for human life.\n\nSo Mack moves him to a cage in a shopping mall. Ivan’s companions in the Mall are Bob, a dog of indeterminate heritage, and Stella, an elephant. He also gets to know Julia and her dad, George who is the Mall caretaker.\n\nWhen I saw my new domain, I was thrilled, and who wouldn’t have been? It had no furniture to break. No glasses to smash. No toilets to drop Mack’s keys into.\n\nIt even had a tyre swing.\n\nI was relieved to have my own place.\n\nSomehow, I didn’t realise I’d be here quite so long.\n\nUnfortunately the animals are not pulling in the people as they used to. Stella is unwell, with a bad foot, and Ivan is not a cute little gorilla anymore. Mack brings in Ruby, a baby elephant that he bought from a circus. Ruby’s arrival and talk of her capture brings memories back to Ivan, and he realises, with Bob’s help, that he needs to be The One and Only Ivan, as he is billed, to make sure Ruby does not live the life that he and Stella have.\n\n‘Ivan?’ Ruby says in a voice so low I can barely hear her. ‘I have another question.’\n\nI can tell from the sound of her voice that this will be a question I don’t want to answer.\n\nRuby taps her trunk against the rusty iron bars of her door. ‘Do you think,’ she asks, ‘that I’ll die in this domain someday, like Aunt Stella?’\n\nOnce again I consider lying, but when I look at Ruby, the half-formed words die in my throat. ‘Not if I can help it,’ I say instead.\n\nI feel something tighten in my chest, something dark and hot. ‘And it’s not a domain,’ I add.\n\nI pause, and then I say it. ‘It’s a cage.’\n\nThe writing in this book is superb. Single words have a huge impact because of the space the author allows around them. Look at the pause after ‘do you think’ created by putting ‘she asks’ there, instead of more conventionally at the end of the question. Little repetitions, like the ‘it’ in the last sentence above, are subtle and clever. They help the reader to linger on important ideas. Not only does this book have a great plot, and an unusual perspective, but the writing is something to be savoured.\n\nThis is a good companion book to Half-Brother, by Kenneth Oppel (Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children’s Book Award Nominee (2012), YALSA Best Fiction for Young Adults (2011), CLA Book of the Year for Children Award (2011)), in that both books – without being preachy – lead the reader into profound areas, questioning the way humans treat and use animals, including the primates most genetically close to us. Half-Brother is more appropriate for older readers, as the YA award would suggest, about 12+, I think.\n\n‘The One and Only Ivan,’ is a great read-aloud for parents and teachers. It introduces some very interesting ideas about ethics, and reminds us that no one is all good, or all bad. There’s a lot in here about compassion and taking the time to really understand things from another perspective. It’s also just a great story.\n\nMost children from about 8+ would understand and get a lot from this story. Highly recommended. 5/5 stars.\n\n*Kylene Beers, in talking about Middle Graders who don’t read, talks about aliteracy. These are children who can read perfectly well, but choose not to. We sometimes call them reluctant readers, which is probably not a fair term. They’re not exactly reluctant, they’re just very discerning. Beers prefers to call them ‘dormant readers’. They have very clear ideas about how they want to spend their time. As ‘Steve’ says, ‘I still like to read. I just can’t find any good books anymore.’ (Beers, K. 2005. Choosing not to read: Understanding why some middle schoolers just say no. Retrieved from: https://webfirst.uark.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Beers-Choosing-not-to-Read.pdf)\n\nCool little song, ‘Gotta Keep Reading’: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfB2ar-AH0Q\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nCongratulations to all finalists and Prize Winners in this year’s NZ Post Children’s Book Awards.\n\nThere were some surprises in this year’s winners, and some books that I felt deserved more recognition than they got. I am only commenting on the Junior Fiction and Young Adult Fiction categories, as these are the ones for which I have read all of the finalists. For the results click here\n\nMy prize list would have looked something like this:\n\nThe book I enjoyed the most and would like to pick up again:\n\nReach – Hugh Brown.\n\nThe book that has been most read and passed around by children in my three English classes:\n\nThe ACB by Honora Lee – Kate de Goldi\n\nand\n\nHonours in this category to\n\nRed Rocks – Rachael King\n\nThe book that had the most compelling narrative:\n\nInto the River – Ted Dawe\n\nThe book that is well written and informative, with a fresh perspective, but is it really written for kids (it won Junior Fiction):\n\nMy Brother’s War – David Hill\n\nSome thoughts I have about the NZ Post Children’s Book Awards.\n\n* Are three judges enough? Many judging panels for book awards are larger. Does five sound unreasonable?\n\n* Should there be more judges who are in touch with what children are actually reading? (This year’s panel were a very fine team of pe0ple, with Bernard Beckett – high school teacher and writer of Young Adult novels; Eirlys Hunter – writer, writing tutor at Victoria University and in Wellington Schools, and Lynn Freeman – wonderful host of National Radio’s The Arts on Sunday – which is always worth a listen). My quibble is not with them, but where are the representatives for younger readers, and particularly those at the challenging ‘tween’ stage (specifically, Year 8, 12 and 13yrs)?\n\n* Do we need a category for Middle Readers? Young Adult, as a category, seems to have evolved into a beast of its own, important, but not relevant to most teachers and librarians who will not be able to put the books on their shelves, or in their classrooms, because of the explicit content. Middle readers are very different to Junior Readers, in that they are wanting to read dystopian fiction that challenges the status quo and explores the separation from families that begins to happen at this age. But, they don’t particularly want or need the serious relationship, drug and alcohol, and other stuff explored in young adult books.\n\n* What really makes a great book? For example, in my classroom of late, a series that has caught the imagination of the children and has been devoured by most of them is, ‘Charlie Joe Jackson’s Guide to Not Reading’, ‘Charlie Joe Jackson’s Guide to Extra Credits’, and ‘Charlie Joe Jackson’s Guide to Summer Vacation’. I have waiting lists for these books – with boys names on them! Lots of names. They are humorous. They are full of action. They deal with real issues in a very matter of fact way. They are getting kids who haven’t been readers enthusiastically recommmending them to their friends. I know this doesn’t make them great books necessarily, but they are well-written and they have a witty, current voice.\n\n* Have we done the war theme now? I kid you not…go back through the last few years of the NZPCBA and you will find acres of material on the war (WW1, WW2 – mostly). Let me illustrate (in case I exaggerate, and have to eat my words).\n\n2013: My Brother’s War category winner– (1914-1918 – conscientious objectors, and war), Earth Fire, Dragon Hare finalist (1948 – 1954 Malayan Emergency)\n\n2012: Nice Day for a War Overall winner and category winner (WW1)\n\n2011: Zero Hour: The Anzacs on the Western Front category winner (WW1)\n\n2010: Dear Alice Category winner (WW2)\n\n…You get the picture. I admired Mandy Hagar’s ‘The Nature of Ash’ to some extent, and Jane Higgins’ ‘The Bridge’ very much, for being New Zealand stories that place themselves in possible futures. I’d like to see a little more dystopian, speculative fiction out there and being taken seriously. I think also of Joy Cowley’s ‘The Hunter’, which plays with time in a uniquely New Zealand way. Let’s get some real variety into the book award finalists lists. Where’s the humour and fun edginess of Melinda Szymanik’s ‘The Were-Nana’? I ramble, but I’m looking for diversity here. Other favourites from the past, for me, include ‘The 10pm Question’ – Kate de Goldi, and ‘Juggling with Mandarins’ – VM Jones.\n\nNext year is the 100th Anniversary of the beginning of the 1914-1918 Great War. I am sure that has not slipped the mind of publishers, and I’m guessing a flurry of ANZAC books, but we really do already have some great ones, and some not so great ones. If there is a flurry, I do hope that quality wins through and we find some new narrative persectives (as David Hill did, this year).\n\nThe most important thing to me is that the books that win their categories, and the overall prize, are books that children and young adults will read, and that will encourage them to read more. I am sure that this years ‘Into the River’ could have an audience in the 15+ age groups, and ‘Reach’ falls well into the YA category. I also felt that ‘The ACB with Honora Lee’ and ‘Uncle Trev and his Whistling Bull’ are well pitched as Junior Fiction. ‘My Brother’s War’ is an excellent book, which, in my opinion would be best represented by a Middle Years category. Congratulations to all writers in this award. It was a fine vintage!\n\nFirstly, I would like to say that there is not ‘a way that teenagers talk to each other’, as some reviewers have commented. I have heard a few that actually sound quite literate – so, for me, the teenage conversation was fine. (Perhaps I could read it as a translation of what they actually said!) The thing I found most surreal about this book was that there was not a cellphone, facebook page or electronic device involved. Technologically speaking, this book was set in the 70’s. Evocatively. And I liked that.\n\nWill is a Year 12 boy who lives with his grandparents since his mother left to join a commune 5 years ago. His father, Bill, (and yes that can get a bit confusing) parents a bit like a hawk – Will says, ‘Dad’s like that – circles around in the hills by himself most of the time, then every now and then he lands nearby, stares at you, silent and fierce, then he’s up and gone again.’ Will sees himself as a nerdy bookworm, and this is further verified when Woody (a rugby player of course) starts to bully Will at school. At about the same time, Will meets Conway, a new girl at school, and the daughter of a Guidance Counsellor that he has a bit of an unfortunate conversation with when she queries his lateness to school each day. In typical teenage fashion he decides to play with her a little, because he can, without further thought to how the mother of a girl he likes might interpret what he says. Also, Will’s mother is now back in the country, and Will, having idealised her to bits, wants to visit her, feeling that she would understand him better than anyone, and help to put things right. (We all know how that’s going to turn out, right?) Conway appears to show interest in Will, and then backs off (mysteriously to Will, but obvious to the reader), Will learns martial arts and then one day Woody turns up…and – you get the picture.\n\nThis book is not about the plot. It’s about the telling of the story. It celebrates language and plays with it all the time. Perky, Will’s best friend, speaks like a thesaurus, ‘A miniscule sun, a tiny luteous orb’ is how he describes a ball of earwax plucked from his ear. When he flicks the wax, it lands on the board between red and wheelbarrow – William Carlos Williams. Perky is quirky – no doubt about that, but as he says himself, it’s a pose – a defence mechanism, ‘Don’t worry, the dean’s very nice. We’re great friends, though of course she is somewhat concerned about my extreme attention-seeking behaviour. But hell, people who live in glasshouses shouldn’t shoot skeet.’\n\nYoung Will is inclined to a bit of verbal virtuosity himself, for example, when milking Hex, the cow (an hilarious scene), sounding almost Shakespearean, ‘set your foot, a hex on you, set your foot, poxy cow,’ he crooned. In maths, a parabola turns into a poem\n\nWhy\n\nequals rain, squared\n\nplus sun? Cloud mountains\n\nroil and mound.\n\nWhy equals\n\nrai…\n\nThis book is such an interesting mix of ideas that every time I think about it, something else comes to mind. Of course it brings to mind Atwood’s ‘The Blind Assassin’, having a novel within a novel, but also, ‘A Handmaid’s Tale’, with the dystopian, repressive society represented in Will’s journal. Narcissus, from Greek mythology who turns into a daffodil, staring into the beautiful reflection of himself in the pond, is the tongue-in-cheek way Brown shows Will’s self-absorbed mother. In a more ‘boy’ way, though, how can we not think of the Marvel comics – Clark Kent being brought up in the country, on a farm, with his ‘grandparents’. It’s interesting that it is Conway, a girl, who is obsessed with the graphic novels – most books would have the boys reading the graphic novels and the girls being the book worms. But then Conway is an artist. At times, Conway is drawn as a character from a graphic novel – when she mimics the finch-like behaviour of her mother, ‘she pursed her lips, put her head on one side and made her eyes round and glassy’ makes her sound more like a Manga than a person, or a finch!\n\nMaybe this is a new form of fantasy writing – set in the here and now – but in a parallel universe where we still drive Valiants and Vdubs, listen to Elvis and have grandmothers who bake endless delectable delights – some of which I haven’t tasted for years. Reading this nearly made me run for my other great Kiwi classic – the Edmonds Cookbook – to bake an Albert cake – whatever that is…and some ginger crunch (not mentioned in this book, but the best thing my mum used to bake on Saturday mornings, while Dad and my older brother were mowing the lawns.) And this book does evoke that time.\n\nIs it too removed from reality – I’m not sure. After all, as this book points out in so many different ways, what is reality? Is it what we experience, is it what people experience of us, is it the reality we build to protect ourselves, is it the reality that dawns on us piece by piece as we put the bits of the puzzle together. This book is perhaps a meditation on life, ‘the point of meditation isn’t to get to a place where you have no thoughts, but where you aren’t involved in them. Where you’re separate, able to observe them, or not, at your leisure.’\n\nThis book has been shortlisted for the Young Adult Section of this year’s New Zealand Post Children’s Book Awards, and also won the inaugural Tessa Duder Award for Young Adult Fiction.\n\nI’m off to offer it as a possibility to my RR, without telling him any of this, of course. I’m pretty sure he’ll just enjoy the story.\n\nWoW! It’s been a great day’s reading…It feels like a privilege to have read this book, set in Oakland, California in 1968. This is the time of the Blank Panthers, Sit-ins, Martin Luther King and Delpine, the eleven year old protagonist is struggling to come to terms with a mother who abandoned her and her two sisters, and who reluctantly has them to stay for a month over summer. She is also struggling over what it means to be who she is – coloured or black, suppressed or oppressed, and how to deal with that.\n\nDelphine is only eleven, but she is the mother that her mother is not. She looks after her two little sisters, Vonetta and Fern with a determined resilience that is just too sad, and yet so powerful. One Crazy Summer the girls are sent to live with their mother for a month. Their mother that they have not seen since she walked out on them after Fern was born. Delphine believes she left them because of an argument over Fern’s name.\n\nIn NZ the fern is a powerful image of new life and potential, symbolised by the koru. New unfurling life, strength, potential and peace. This feels right for the book. That the name Cecile wanted to call Fern means mercy and protection, is also right for the story.\n\nFor me, while Delphine was a powerful storyteller, and she carried the storyline with a real dignity and truth, Cecile was the story. Her poetry rocked! As did Fern’s. Strangely, while Cecile’s poem was about being the mother of the nation, Delphine symbolised and lived the self-restraint and subsuming of self that brings to mind oppression. Delphine was the mother to her mother, the mother earth. Cecile was the game changer, the rebellious, obstinant, bruised child. Delphine has the strength to see many perspectives, and allow difference – to respect the different pathways to freedom. And her strength means she can help it to happen.\n\nThis beautiful, upside down book does not resolve everything. But it shows a pathway to understanding hurt and anger, deprivation and resilience that is ultimately hopeful, if not perfect.\n\nI really felt that this book was not SET in the time, but OF the time. The little touches didn’t feel forced, they felt true…I loved Delphine’s Timex watch, and the shows on TV, the music, and just so much else about this book.\n\nI’m off to read more books by this author…"
