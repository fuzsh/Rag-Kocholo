        "text": "Isaac Hayes was laid to rest over the weekend and Access Hollywood has new details about the service, which brought out a host of stars and even royalty.\n\nTom Cruise, Denzel Washington, Kelly Preston, Wesley Snipes, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rev. Al Sharpton, Maurice White (of Earth, Wind and Fire), “Shaft” star Richard Roundtree, along with Hayes’ family (his wife, children and grandchildren) and the Mayors of both Memphis and Shelby County and members of his band were among the 500 invited guests to the late star’s funeral.\n\nThe service was presided over by someone from The Church of Scientology, of which Hayes was a long-time member. The ceremony took place at an undisclosed cemetery in Memphis, where Hayes body is interred.\n\n[ Richard Roundtree Remembers Isaac Hayes - Play it Now ]\n\nHayes died at his home in Cordova, Tennessee on August 10th, the victim of a stroke. He was 65.\n\nThe source told Access the ceremony was a “celebration” rather than a wake and all the people in attendance had known Hayes or had worked with him or had been touched by his works.\n\nMembers of the royal family from the African Republic of Ghana came from Africa for the service, the source said. Hayes had been made an honorary member of the Ghanian royal family because of his work there with orphaned children."
