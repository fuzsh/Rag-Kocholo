        "text": "CORDOVA, Tenn. — It was easy to tell the Hollywood Scientologists from the Memphis music people as they passed the gantlet of television cameras and entered the suburban Memphis megachurch to pay tribute to Isaac Hayes. They were on the whole paler and skinnier and showed rather more cleavage than is considered properly funereal here in the South.\n\nThe Memphians, on the other hand, tended toward vintage dresses and dark three-piece suits with expertly origamied handkerchiefs and matching ties.\n\nThen there was the soul royalty, like Bootsy Collins, who wore a get-up involving wide pinstripes, a kerchief, and rhinestone-coated sunglass lenses with peepholes in the shape of stars, and the actual royalty, like Princess Naa Asie Ocansey of Ghana, who wore gold and red African finery and managed to get surprisingly low to the ground when she danced.\n\nBut there were also thousands of regular people, wearing regular clothes, who poured into the sanctuary of the Hope Presbyterian Church.\n\nFor a superstar known for his slick image and “bedroom baritone,” as one speaker called it, Mr. Hayes was deeply involved in the workaday life of his hometown, where he recently appeared on a billboard with a local congressman, Steve Cohen, who was fighting off a challenger. The billboard read, “Can you dig it?”\n\nMr. Hayes was also involved in literacy programs in Memphis schools, and in 1997, he and Lisa Marie Presley started the Church of Scientology Mission of Memphis.\n\n“Isaac was not only a famous musician, but he was an accessible famous musician in his hometown,” said David Porter, with whom Mr. Hayes wrote “Soul Man” and other hits for Stax, the recording studio that defined what came to be known as the Memphis sound.\n\nThe first glimpse of Mr. Hayes, in a video clip from “Wattstax,” the 1972 concert in response to the Los Angeles riots, showed him in a multicolored cape that reached the floor. But people here knew him in a less glamorous light.\n\nOne attendee, Cora Williams, 88, said she had known Mr. Hayes as a child in Covington, Tenn., when their families attended church and singalongs together.\n\nAnother guest, Elvis Calvin, said: “I pulled Isaac out of a hole. He got stuck in the mud in his Lincoln, and we pulled him out. He came to the house. I got photos from that day.”\n\nThis feat apparently earned Mr. Calvin, a funeral director in Coldwater, Miss., a seat in the V.I.P. section.\n\nMr. Hayes returned to his hometown seven years ago, after a stint in New York, mostly to be closer to his 11 children and 16 grandchildren. He died at 65, after a stroke on Aug. 10 in his home.\n\nThere was oration by the Revs. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, and musical interludes by Chick Corea, Kirk Whalum and Doug E. Fresh, the original human beatbox.\n\nThe jumbled hoopla seemed fitting for Mr. Hayes, a man who shaved his head at a time when Afros were chic, and cut an 18-minute track when songs were radio-ready at three minutes and change.\n\nThe stories fit into two general categories. Anne Archer and Kelly Preston, both actresses and Scientologists, detailed Mr. Hayes’s humanitarian work here and in Africa, while Al Bell, a co-owner of Stax, told how he came up with the name of Mr. Hayes’s first big album, “Hot Buttered Soul,” from a magazine advertisement for hot buttered rum.\n\nAfterward, when asked what he made of the two factions coming together on one stage, Mr. Porter laughed. “Each of those components,” he said, “loved Isaac Hayes.”\n\nOn stage, the Rev. Alfreddie Johnson, a Scientologist, explained how Mr. Hayes might have become interested in the religion in the early 1990s, when he was filming a movie scene in the hotel in the Scientology Celebrity Center International in Los Angeles.\n\nMr. Johnson was coming out of the bathroom. “He came up to me,” Mr. Johnson recalled, “and he said, ‘Brother to brother, what are these white folks doing up in here?’ ”\n\nMr. Johnson told him that he was teaching Scientology learning techniques to gang members in Compton, Calif., in an effort to get them off the streets.\n\nWord that a Scientology minister would be presiding over the tribute on Monday produced angry chatter on the Internet aimed at the religion, which some people consider to be a manipulative cult, and at the Christian church that agreed to play host to the program. Though that report proved to be incorrect, the audience seemed apprehensive when Scientologists, who spoke openly about their faith, were on stage.\n\nLocal anecdotes drew a warmer response.\n\nCraig Brewer, the Memphis filmmaker best known for “Hustle and Flow,” said he had insisted that the role of the bartender in that movie be cast with a local actor. It went to Mr. Hayes.\n\nIn an interview before the program, Mr. Brewer said that even among the outsize characters of the Memphis music world, Mr. Hayes stood out as an original. “You take Elvis Presley, B. B. King, Johnny Cash. After a while, Memphis was like a conveyor belt for these personalities. Boy, did Isaac come along and blindside everyone.”\n\nMr. Brewer noted Mr. Hayes’s knack for turning the tables.\n\n“In a place that has a history of white artists taking black musical styles and making money off them, here is Hayes taking Glen Campbell songs and Burt Bachrach songs and making them so much his own that you question their origin,” he said."
