        "text": "Singer Isaac Hayes died today at the age of 65 at his home in Memphis. Hayes is best known for his song \"Shaft\", as well as his voice for the character Chef on the \"South Park\" cartoon. From CNN:\n\nSoul legend Isaac Hayes dead at 65\n\n(CNN) -- Soul singer and arranger Isaac Hayes, who won Grammy awards and an Oscar for the theme from the 1971 action film \"Shaft,\" has died, sheriff's officials in Memphis, Tennessee, reported Sunday.\n\nRelatives found Hayes, 65, unconscious in his home next to a still-running treadmill, said Steve Schular, a spokesman for the Shelby County Sheriff's Department.\n\nParamedics attempted to revive him and took him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after 2 p.m., the sheriff's department said.\n\nNo foul play is suspected, the agency said in a written statement.\n\nHayes was a longtime songwriter and arranger for Stax Records in Memphis, playing in the studio's backup band and crafting tunes for artists such as Otis Redding and Sam and Dave in the 1960s.\n\nHe released his first solo album in 1967.\n\nIn 1971, the theme from \"Shaft\" became a pop hit and won an Academy Award for best original theme song. The song and the movie score also won Grammy awards for best original score and movie theme.\n\nHe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nCapt. Bacardi\n\nBelieve it or not, I was going to see him here in Brooklyn in June 12, where every summer we have what we call the CELEBRATE BROOKLYN concert series at a outdoor concert venue called the Prospect Park bandshell. When June 12 came, I was too tired from work, so I didn't go. \"Next time\", I said. So for those of you out there: never put off what you can do today for tomorrow, tomorrow is not promised!! How ever, my co-worker did go to the concert, and she said he was in good spirits, but he did walk with a limp, when he was walking to the stage.\n\nI did see him in concert in 2002, and while I liked the show, he didn't do a whole lot of songs, and I was slightly disappointed. But over all, he was great, and a true contributor to the world of music. And to think he died a day or two after Bernie Mac! Do you know that they are going to be in the SAME MOVIE together this fall? It's called SOULMEN, and Bernie stars with Samuel Jackson, and Isaac has a cameo in it!\n\nAnyway, Isaac(and you too, Bernie) REST IN PEACE."
