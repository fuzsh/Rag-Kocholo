        "text": "Isaac Hayes â€” a legendary soul singer, songwriter, musician and producer whose career spanned four decades and who achieved unexpected fame later in life as the voice of \"South Park\" character Chef â€” died Sunday afternoon (August 10), a spokesperson for the Shelby County, Tennesee, sheriff's department told WMC-TV in Memphis.\n\nHayes' wife found him on the floor near a treadmill inside his home, according to the station's Web site. Hayes was taken to Baptist East Hospital in Memphis, where he was pronounced dead at 2:08 p.m.\n\nDeputies with the Shelby County Sheriff's Department are continuing their investigation into Hayes' death, but they believe no foul play was involved, the report said. Hayes was 65.\n\nMTV.com article\n\nShaft (live)\n\nEven if he was a batshit crazy scientologist, this is still sad news. At times like this, we must make the world seem better to ourselves.\n\nhttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=lvSIYJpzlD8\n\n(And yes, I know it's not the original version, but it makes me happy!)\n\nThe return of the Chef was one of the most shocking South Park moments. Remember that? I cannot even repeat what he said to the children!\n\nsifr said:\n\nEven if he was a batshit crazy scientologist, this is still sad news.
