        "text": "Isaac Hayes – musical pioneer, actor, Black Moses of Soul, South Park legend and one bad mutha (\"Hush your mouth!\") – died Sunday at the age of 65.\n\nA gifted musician able to play multiple instruments, Hayes' upbringing in and around Memphis, Tennessee, exposed him to mixed musical influences, from Delta bluesmen to Elvis. Hayes turned down a formal education in music to sign with Stax Records, working with Sam & Dave, Otis Redding and Booker T. and the MGs.\n\nHe was forever linked to the Black Power movement and the Blaxploitation era of movies with his iconic theme for that \"black private dick who was a sex machine to all the chicks,\" Shaft. Hayes' contributions to rock, soul and funk earned him a prominent display in the Smithsonian's Rock and Soul Museum in downtown Memphis.\n\nComedy Central's South Park introduced Hayes to the \"children\" of the 21st century as the passionate, all-knowing Chef. After becoming one of the show's most beloved characters, Hayes left South Park over a dispute with series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone over his pursuit of Scientology.\n\nHayes died after he collapsed near a treadmill on his Memphis estate, according to the Associated Press.\n\nSee also:\n\nSouth Park to Offer All Episodes Free\n\nActor/Comedian Bernie Mac Dies at 50\n\nSouth Park Studios Releases Uncensored 'Imaginationland'\n\nHow the Developer of Among Us Is Helping Indie Studios Survive Gaming’s Current Tumult\n\nAs the video game industry contracts, indie developers are left with fewer options for funding.
