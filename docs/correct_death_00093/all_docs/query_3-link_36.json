        "text": "DATE August 11, 2008 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nInterview: Isaac Hayes discusses his music and acting career\n\nDAVE DAVIES, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, senior writer for the Philadelphia Daily\n\nNews, sitting in for Terry Gross.\n\nIsaac Hayes, the singer, songwriter, composer and producer whose soul sound\n\nchanged the world of music, died yesterday at his home in East Memphis,\n\nTennessee. He was 65.\n\nHayes is perhaps best known for his bass baritone voice and the theme to\n\n\"Shaft,\" which won an Academy Award in 1972. Born in rural Tennessee in 1942,\n\nHayes began playing with local bands and became a songwriter, producer and\n\narranger for Stax Records, the legendary Memphis R&B label. He recorded\n\nseveral hits there, including the album \"Hot Buttered Soul\" and the\n\nGrammy-winning \"Black Moses,\" which influenced later generations of disco and\n\nhip-hop artists. Hayes also developed a trademark look with his shaved head,\n\ngold chains and bare chest. In the '80s and '90s, Hayes found an acting\n\ncareer, with roles in the \"Rockford Files\" and the films \"Escape from New\n\nYork,\" \"The Duke,\" and the loving parody of blacksploitation films \"I'm Gonna\n\nGit You Sucka.\" And he gave his voice to the character Chef on the animated\n\nseries \"South Park\" until 2006. He continued performing in recent years\n\ndespite health problems. Terry spoke to Isaac Hayes in 1994.\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nNow I know before you started making your own records, before you started\n\nsinging in your records, you produced for other people, and also you played\n\npiano and keyboards. And you used to play with Booker T. & the MGs. Now how\n\ndid you learn to play piano, growing up as poor as you did? I know there were\n\ntimes in your life when you didn't have shoes, let alone a piano.\n\nMr. ISAAC HAYES: That's true. How did I do that? Well, let's see. A\n\nfriend of mine I grew up with, Sidney Kirk, used to be my accompanist. We\n\nwent places and he'd play for me. He joined the Air Force; he wasn't there.\n\nThere was a call in to him about a gig New Year's Eve. His sister knew that I\n\nwas destitute and I needed money, so she asked me if I wanted to play? Well,\n\nI could play maybe \"Chopsticks\" and stuff like that. And I said, `Yeah, I'll\n\ntake it.' I took the gig out of desperation. And when I got to the club, I\n\nwas petrified. I said, `Oh, my God, they're going to shoot me. I can't\n\nplay.' And musicians started coming in, you know, setting up, tuning up, and\n\nI'm sitting there, you know, trying to be cool. I said, `God, they're going\n\nto find me out.' And the featured artist came in and said, `Hey, man, do you\n\nall know such-and-such?' This is the first time this band had been put\n\ntogether. We didn't rehearse anything.\n\nAnd everybody said, `Yeah, we know it, and blah, blah, blah.' So he kicked off\n\nthe tune, and it sounded horrible. Everybody did. I said, `Wow, these guys\n\ncan't play either.' So I'm comfortable. And, you know, being New Year's Eve,\n\nthe clientele was drunk, and they thought we were cooking, you know? And\n\nsomewhere along the line, the club owner--he was sauced--he came up and said,\n\n`You know, you boys sound real good. You all want a regular job?' `Yeah,\n\nwe'll take it.' And that was in Memphis and it was a regular gig, and each\n\nnight I would learn something more and more on the keyboards. And that's how\n\nI got started.\n\nGROSS: That's great. And then you started sitting in with Booker T. & the\n\nMGs.\n\nMr. HAYES: Well, I wound up at Stax Records. I changed bands and I joined\n\nFloyd Newman's band, who was a staff musician at Stax. He played baritone\n\nsaxophone. All those ba-dups, stuff like that, that was Floyd. So he was up\n\nfor a recording. He said, `Man, you know, we're going in the studio.' And\n\nprior I had been to Stax about three different times with a blues band, with a\n\nvocal group, you know, trying to get a break, and was always turned down.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. HAYES: This time I went in with Floyd and Howard Grimes, a drummer, he\n\nand I wrote some songs, some instrumentals and things like that. And Jim\n\nStewart, who, you know, was co-owner of Stax, he said, `You know, you sound\n\npretty good on keyboards. Booker T. is off at Indiana U. in school. Would\n\nyou like to become a staff musician here?' `Yeah!' You know? So that's how I\n\ngot in Stax.\n\nAnd my first session, I think it was an Otis Redding album session, I was\n\nscared to death, but he made it easy. And I learned a lot and I fit right in.\n\nAnd I became a staff musician. So when Booker came back, he and I both played\n\non sessions. We'd switch around. Sometimes I'd play organ and he'd play\n\npiano, and sometimes I'd play piano, he'd play organ. And with \"Duck,\" Steve\n\nand Al, we were the nucleus of Stax, the rhythm section, and then, of course,\n\nthe horns and so forth.\n\nGROSS: Now you were not only a house musician at Stax, you became a house\n\nsongwriter. And you wrote a lot of songs with your partner then, David\n\nPorter. And some of the most famous songs that you wrote were for Sam and\n\nDave, like \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Coming.\" What do you remember about\n\nwriting \"Soul Man\"?\n\nMr. HAYES: Well, I remember getting the idea from watching TV and the riots\n\nin Detroit, and it was said that if you put soul on your door, your business\n\nestablishment--they would bypass it and wouldn't burn it. And then the word\n\n\"soul\"--you know, the clenched fist, you know, \"soul brothers,\" soul this--it\n\nwas a galvanizing kind of thing as far as, you know, African-Americans were\n\nconcerned. And it had a kind of effective unity, and they said it with a lot\n\nof pride. So I said, `Well, hm, why not write a tune called \"Soul Man\"?' And\n\nall you had to do was write about your own personal experiences because, you\n\nknow we, everybody, all African-Americans in this country, during those times\n\nespecially, had similar experiences. So we did that. But realized that, in\n\naddition to being an African-American experience, it was a human experience;\n\nso therefore it crossed the board. And then the groove and everything else\n\nthat went with it just made it, you know, very, very commercial.\n\nGROSS: So did you arrange this too?\n\nMr. HAYES: Yes. Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: And are you featured instrumentally?\n\nMr. HAYES: I wasn't featured. I just played piano on it. Well, you know, I\n\ndid some little hot licks in there and stuff like that.\n\nGROSS: OK. Well let's hear \"Soul Man,\" co-written by my guest Isaac Hayes.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Soul Man\")\n\nSAM and DAVE: (Singing) Coming to you on a dusty road.\n\nGood lovin', I got a truckload.\n\nAnd when you get it--Ha!--you got some.\n\nSo don't worry 'cause I'm coming.\n\nI'm a soul man. Yeow! I'm a soul man.\n\nI'm a soul man. Whoa! Hey! I'm a soul man,\n\nand that ain't all.\n\nGot what I got the hard way,\n\nand I'll make it better, each and every day.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: So how come it took several years for you to actually record your own\n\nvocals?\n\nMr. HAYES: Well, I started singing in high school. I sang before ninth\n\ngrade, preteen, I used to sing. But I sounded like somebody in the Vienna\n\nBoys' Choir.\n\n(Singing) My voice was way up there like that.\n\nAnd they would call me, `Oh, man, you're a sissy.' So when I reached puberty,\n\nmy voice started cracking and squeaking, and then when it cleared up, it was\n\ndown in the basement. So I started singing again, and I was singing jazz\n\nduring my teenage years. I was singing jazz in a little nightclub, I was\n\nsinging with blues band, I was singing with a rock 'n' roll group called the\n\nTeen Tones, I was singing with a gospel group called the Morning Stars. We\n\nhad a little combo, and during my senior year we played. So I had all this\n\nexperience, and I would to go Jim Stewart and say, `Hey, Jim, I want to\n\nrecord. I want to try some.' `Well, Ike, you know, we have an R&B label and\n\nyour voice is too good. It's too good for what we're doing here.'\n\nSo I never did get the shot until one day it was someone's birthday party at\n\nStax, and we always serve champagne and cake. And we had gobbled down some\n\ncake, and Duck Dunn and I grabbed a couple of bottles of champagne and ran\n\ninto the ladies restroom and closed the door. And we just guzzled this\n\nchampagne down. I mean, I got a buzz. Came out, Al Bell, who at that time\n\nwas the head of national promotion--he wound up being executive vice\n\npresident--but he said, `Ike, I want to cut something on you.' `OK, yeah. I\n\ndon't care.' I was feeling no pain. So we were going into the studio, Al,\n\nJack's on drums, Duck on bass and myself on piano. And I said, `Man, you all\n\nfollow me.' It was all impromptu. And we stayed in the studio a few hours.\n\nAnd we finished. Al said, `OK, I got what I want.' And that wound up being\n\n\"Presenting Isaac Hayes,\" my very first album.\n\nGROSS: You developed a style of singing in which you did long raps. It kind\n\nof gave a back story to the song. And the rap would lead you into the song.\n\nAnd the songs are often, you know, like pop tunes other people had written,\n\nlike \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix.\"\n\nMr. HAYES: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: But you'd kind of make up the whole story leading up to it. How did\n\nyou start doing that, combining these raps with pop tunes?\n\nMr. HAYES: Remember the famous quote in \"Cool Hand Luke\"? I forget the\n\nactor's name. \"What we have here is a failure to communicate.\"\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. HAYES: Remember that?\n\nGROSS: Sure.\n\nMr. HAYES: Well, I did that. The rap came out of the necessity to\n\ncommunicate. And the way it happened was, there's a local club in Memphis\n\npredominantly black that was called the Tiki Club. And, you know, we'd hang\n\nout there, the Bar-Kays were playing there sometimes, and we'd hang out there\n\nand sit in. You know how musicians do. And this one day, I heard this song\n\nby Glen Campbell, \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix.\" I said, `Wow, oh, that\n\nsong's great. I mean, this man must really have loved this woman.'\n\nAnd so I ran down to the studio later on that day and said, `Man, you all hear\n\nthis song \"Phoenix\"? Man, it's great.' Everybody, `Yeah, yeah.' You know, no\n\nenthusiasm. I was saying, `These guys don't feel what I feel. What, are they\n\ngetting it?' So the Bar-Kays were scheduled to play the Tiki Club a couple of\n\ndays later, and I said, `Hey, man, I'm coming down to sit in with you guys.\n\nLearn \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix.\"' They said, `OK.' I told them the key,\n\nin E flat.\n\nAnd so I went down and the club was packed. Go up on stage, `Ladies and\n\ngentlemen, you know, you all know him, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Isaac\n\nHayes.' And, I mean, it's all kind of conversations going, you know, `Blah,\n\nblah, blah, blah, blah.' I said, `Oh, man, how am I going to get these\n\npeople's attention?' So I said, `Hey, man, the first chord in the song, you\n\nall hang up on it. It's a B flat 11. Just hang up on the chord. Just keep\n\ncycling it.' And I started talking. And I just started telling this story.\n\nIt was a scenario about what could have happened to cause this man to leave,\n\nyou know. And I started talking and, halfway through the rap, the\n\nconversations started to subside. And when I reached the first line in the\n\nsong, when I said, \"By the time I get to Phoenix,\" everybody went `Oh, wow.'\n\nAnd, you know, when I finished the song, there wasn't a dry eye in the house.\n\nGROSS: Well, I want to play an excerpt of your recording of \"By the Time I\n\nGet to Phoenix.\" This is Isaac Hayes.\n\n(Soundbite of \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\")\n\nMr. HAYES: (Speaking) But one day, one day, old boy got sick and he had to\n\ncome home. I don't have to tell you what he found. Only it hurt him so bad.\n\nHe said, `Baby, mama, why?' That's all he could say. But she said, `Oh, go\n\non, fool. You're doing it.' But the man wasn't doing it. But that's the only\n\nexcuse she could give him. He said, `Mama, I can't take it. I got to leave\n\nyou. I'm going to leave you.' Well, she tried to straighten up. She said she\n\nwas going to straighten up. She got a little job to help him out with the\n\nbills, too. But that was just a sham. Because he found it again. And again.\n\nAnd seven times he left this woman, and seven times he came back. And he'd\n\ntaken all that he could stand. And the eighth time that this went down, he\n\nsaid, `Mama, I got to go.' He said, `I'm leaving my heart right here.'\n\n(Singing) Ooh, I don't want to go,\n\nbut I got to leave you, mama.\n\nHe said, `By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising.\n\nOh, and she'll find a note I left hanging on the door.\n\nShe'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving.\n\nYes, she will.\n\nWhy? 'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.\n\nOh. By the time I make Albuquerque, she'll be working.'\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nDAVIES: Isaac Hayes. We'll hear more of his 1994 interview with Terry in a\n\nmoment. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nDAVIES: Today we're remembering Isaac Hayes, who died yesterday, by listening\n\nto his 1994 interview on FRESH AIR.\n\nGROSS: Now you recorded the theme for the movie \"Shaft\" in, I guess, it was\n\n1971. How were you asked to do this?\n\nMr. HAYES: Well, it was a whole concept. Hollywood recognized that they had\n\nto look further than they had been looking to get business. I think it was\n\nfledgling at the time. It was a bit stagnant. And Melvin Van Peebles had put\n\nout a movie called \"Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.\" And they said, `Hm. There\n\nmight be a market there. If we come up with a concept to have a black leading\n\nman, black director, maybe a black composer, we might hit that market.' MGM\n\nwas the one that pioneered the idea. So we had a meeting out there at MGM\n\nwith Stax execs, and they asked me to come. And they talked about the\n\nconcept. And would I do the music? Would I be interested in doing the music?\n\nYeah. I said, `I want to act, too. Have you all cast for the lead role?'\n\n`Well, no. We'll look into that.' But anyway, I think that was a stick and\n\ncarrot, you know? So.\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. HAYES: So I agreed to do the music. They had already cast Richard\n\nRoundtree, which was rightfully so, he's perfect for the part. And I agreed\n\nto do the music. And that's how that whole idea came about.\n\nGROSS: Here's where you really get into orchestrating, right?\n\nMr. HAYES: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: So tell me how you started using that wah-wah guitar funk style.\n\nMr. HAYES: Ha, ha. Well, OK. Trade secrets. What happened was, I had been\n\ndoing the arranging all the time. I did a lot of arranging with the horns and\n\nstuff at Stax, and the first string arrangements I tried was a thing that\n\nDavid and I did on Sam and Dave; and that album was like a big flop, but we\n\ntried it anyway. But I had a taste for it. And once I had a taste for the\n\nstrings, I couldn't let it go. Now sometimes, in the studio, you're working\n\non various grooves and stuff and you can't find a name for it or you can't tag\n\nit with anything. You just, if it feels good, you say, `OK, I'm going to file\n\nthat.' And you put it up. You put it back and you store it.\n\nNow when it was time for me to do the \"Shaft\" theme, I said, `What can I do?'\n\nYou know, they explained the character to me, you know, `A relentless\n\ncharacter, always on the move, always on the prowl. And you got to get\n\nsomething to denote that for the main theme.' I said, `What can I do?' I\n\nthought about--if you remember Otis Redding's \"Try a Little Tenderness,\" I had\n\na hand in that arrangement, too. In the end, Al Jackson was doing some stuff\n\non high-hat similar, you know. \"You got to na, na, na, chicka, chicka,\n\nchicka, chicka, boom.\" You know? So I thought about that. I said, `Maybe if\n\nI just sustain that particular thing on the high-hat, that will give you a\n\ndramatic effect and it's something that's relentless. Now what else can I\n\ndo?' I thought the guitar lick. And I went and pulled it out, played it; and\n\nCharles Pitts, we called him \"Skip,\" he played the thing on the wah-wah. I\n\nsaid, `Hey, play this line.' And he started it. And I told Willie the\n\ndrummer, I said, `Willie Hall,' I said, `Give me that high-hat man, some 16\n\nnotes.' You know, chicha, chicha, chicha, chicha, you know. And he did that.\n\nAnd it worked. I said, `That's the kind of dramatic effect I want.'\n\n(Soundbite of instrumental introduction of \"Shaft\")\n\nMr. HAYES: Then I started putting the other things in, you know, the base,\n\nthe accents and all that stuff, but that's how that whole wah-wah thing came\n\nabout.\n\nGROSS: Well, why don't I play some of your theme from \"Shaft,\" a classic.\n\nThis is Isaac Hayes.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Shaft\")\n\nMr. HAYES: Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the\n\nchicks?\n\nUnidentified Backup Singers: (Singing) Shaft!\n\nMr. HAYES: You damn right!\n\n(Singing) Who is the man that would risk his neck\n\nfor his brother man?\n\nBackup Singers: (Singing) Shaft!\n\nMr. HAYES: Can you dig it?\n\n(Singing) Who's the cat that won't cop out\n\nWhen there's danger all about?\n\nBackup Singers: Shaft!\n\nMr. HAYES: Right on.\n\n(Singing) They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother\n\nBackup Singers: Shut your mouth!\n\nMr. HAYES: I'm talking about Shaft.\n\nBackup Singers: Then we can dig it!\n\nMr. HAYES: (Singing) He's a complicated man,\n\nbut no one understands him but his woman.\n\nBackup Singers: John Shaft!\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nDAVIES: Isaac Hayes spoke with Terry Gross in 1994. We'll hear more of their\n\nconversation in the second half of the show. Hayes died yesterday at the age\n\nof 65. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, filling in for Terry Gross.\n\nToday we're remembering singer, songwriter and composer Isaac Hayes, who died\n\nin East Memphis yesterday at the age of 65. Terry spoke to Isaac Hayes in\n\n1994.\n\nGROSS: At the time that \"Shaft\" and \"Super Fly\" were really popular, I mean,\n\neverybody now, all the black filmmakers now just credit those films with\n\npaving the way to all the new work that's happening now. But at the time the\n\nNAACP was appalled at the black action films. And I wonder what your reaction\n\nwas then to their reaction?\n\nMr. HAYES: Well, you know, I had mixed emotions about that. That position\n\nwas that, you know, it was painting a bad image...\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. HAYES: ...you know, for the kids and so forth, and there were no\n\nalternatives. Had there been some alternatives at that time, then I don't\n\nthink the NAACP would have come down so hard. But what happened was when they\n\ndid that it was like it turned off the tap. It totally dried up for us\n\nbecause I was a, `Whoops, hands off.' And they dropped everything. And our\n\nwhole little thing just died. I think, you know, in hindsight, had there been\n\na little more patience at the time maybe it could have taken off in some other\n\ndirections because that was--it was in its embryonic stage at that time, you\n\nknow, the black cinema.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. HAYES: And anything in its infancy you going to get some--you'll get a\n\nlot of crap. You're going to get some inferior things and all of that and\n\nquality and so forth, and even questionable subject matters. But as that\n\nparticular genre grows then, you know, you start getting better films and so\n\nforth. And I think they might have made a move a little bit too soon; because\n\nwhen we were doing these things, we weren't taking ourselves seriously, not as\n\nthe characters. We were just glad to get the work, glad to get the\n\nexperience, glad that our people could see us on screen.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. HAYES: You know, I mean, and...\n\nGROSS: And as leading men.\n\nMr. HAYES: Yeah. You know, and not with a broom and a mop and bowing and\n\nsaying, `Yes, sir, boss.'\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. HAYES: So, you know, so that's why, you know, it took off and was so\n\nwidely received. And I think had it had a little time to go, a little longer,\n\nyou know, you spin off in some other areas and Hollywood would have recognized\n\nthat there is more that could sell than, you know, the pimps and the hookers\n\nand, you know, the private eyes and so forth.\n\nGROSS: I want to spend a couple of minutes talking with you about how you\n\ndeveloped your image. When did you start shaving your head?\n\nMr. HAYES: I started shaving my head not long after I got out of high\n\nschool.\n\nGROSS: It wasn't fashionable then, at least not to my knowledge.\n\nMr. HAYES: No, it wasn't.\n\nGROSS: What inspired you to do it?\n\nMr. HAYES: Well, you know, during those times, as musicians, we--it was a\n\nfad. We had a relax in our hair, called it a \"do,\" a cork process. And\n\nduring that time mine was cut very low and just slicked down on my head all\n\nthe way around like a coconut, you know. And it was hip. It was the style.\n\nBut in the summertime, it was hard to keep up; and you sweat, and it come\n\nundone and you had to sleep with a stocking cap on on the couch. I go, `I'm\n\nsick of fooling with this stuff. I'm going to cut it off.' So I went to the\n\nbarber shop around the corner from Stax. I said, `Mr. King, cut it all off.'\n\n`What?' `Cut it all off. I'm going to grow a new crop.' And when he cut it\n\noff, you know, I went outside, you know, and I said, `Wow, it's a breeze out\n\nhere. It feels great. I can feel the wind on my head. Hey, I think I'll\n\nkeep it like this.' I already had the beard. And people would look at me and\n\nsay, `Oh, wow. Oh, look at this guy. Man, he's got a bald head and a beard.'\n\nBut I didn't care because it was different and I like being different, you\n\nknow, I like swimming up stream.\n\nAnd a funny thing. One time Booker T., by some error, somebody booked two\n\ndates on the same day for Booker T. and MGs. And one date was in--I think\n\nBooker had to go to Oklahoma somewhere, and I went to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania\n\nwith Al, Duck and Steve, and David Porter was a vocalist, and I was to pretend\n\nto be Booker T. And I'm at the organ, we kicked off the tune, kicked off\n\n\"Green Onions,\" you know, and grooving. Somebody said, `Hey, man, that ain't\n\nno Booker T. He ain't got no hair.' And I mean they were ready to riot. I\n\njumped up from the organ and got out there with David and started dancing and\n\nsinging and doing any other things trying to appease the people, you know.\n\nBut finally they said, `Well, OK, what the hell. We'll accept him.' And, I\n\nmean, I played the entire gig. And, of course, years later I went back as\n\nIsaac Hayes and I played Harrisburg and I told that incident and some people\n\nremembered it and they cracked up.\n\nGROSS: That's funny.\n\nMr. HAYES: But I mean I was an unknown, but I just looked different. I\n\nliked the different look.\n\nGROSS: Are you still doing it?\n\nMr. HAYES: Oh, yeah. You see the thing about it is it's ageless. So when I\n\ngo naturally no one will know.\n\nGROSS: Now, how did you start wearing gold and velvet and furs?\n\nMr. HAYES: Well, you mean just day to day or...\n\nGROSS: Well, I don't know what you wore day to day, but I know you certainly\n\nwore that on stage.\n\nMr. HAYES: Oh. On stage I wore, OK, French rabbit boots. I wore tights of\n\ndifferent color. And I wore chains. Now--and I come out with a cape and a\n\nfloppy hat. Why did I do that? OK, a sense for the dramatics. OK? You see,\n\nat first I would wear, during the days of the hippies, I would wear a lot of\n\nrawhide with fringes and beads and stuff and moccasins and bell bottoms. And\n\nit was hot. It was hot. And later on I thought, I said, `When I see\n\nentertainers perform, they come out with three piece suits on, with ties, and\n\nthe first thing they do is loosen the tie and throw the jacket off, and then\n\nthey might take the vest off.' I said, `Well, I'm going to go out there\n\nalready comfortable. So what can I do?' So I started wearing the vest and the\n\ntights. Tights are comfortable. Ballet dancers wear tights, so why can't I?\n\nAnd a guy gave me a chain necklace and a belt, and I tried that on stage. And\n\nwhen I came out like that, women were screaming. You know, I was always\n\ntaking mental notes of effects and so forth. And I said, `Hmm, maybe I'll do\n\nthis.' And I started doing it and somebody suggested, `Why don't you put a\n\nrobe on because you want to go out there and give it to them all at one time.\n\nPut a cape on and then throw it off when you get out there.' I tried that\n\neffect. Wow. Then I put a floppy hat on and showed my head later, because I\n\nremember one time I went out on stage and I had a hat on and I started\n\nsweating. I took it off to wipe my head and women screamed. `Hmm. OK, I'll\n\nuse that too.' And then this guy named Charles Rubin said, `Isaac, I have an\n\nidea. I'm going to make you some chain vests.' I said, `OK, try it out and\n\nwe'll see.' And he made them and it worked, and that's how that came. But I\n\njust like--I was a renegade. I had a renegade mentality. I always liked to\n\nbe different.\n\nGROSS: Did you dress like that in private?\n\nMr. HAYES: No. No. I mean, I dressed, I mean, I dressed real fly. If you\n\nremember in Guralnick's book, he described I had a purple suit on with some\n\npurple shoes and--whatever it was--standing outside of Stax. Remember? So I\n\nalways dressed flamboyantly. I mean, you know, always flashy. I would dare\n\nto wear things nobody else would try to wear. I, you know, I had a girl that\n\nmade me some Nehru suits and stuff like that back when nobody would wear them.\n\nI saw the \"Pink Panther\" and I liked the way that--remember the first one\n\nwhere Capucine, her chaperone, this guy was always around--tall, slim guy--had\n\nthese Nehru collars and stuff on, and I liked that look. So I had a girl to\n\nmake a lot of those things for me.\n\nGROSS: So this must have been real different from when you were growing up\n\nand you virtually had no clothes, you had no shoes.\n\nMr. HAYES: Hey, you could put me out in the corn field and I'd scare the\n\ncrows away, you know. You know, when you're like that, when you grow up in\n\npoverty and you think about that meal you're going to have, you'll never be\n\nhungry again, Scarlett O'Hara. You think about the clothes you're going to\n\nwear. You think about the house you want to live in. You think about the\n\ncars, you know. So when you start acquiring affluence, money, you buy these\n\nthings and you enjoy it. And I worked all of my child--I didn't have a normal\n\nchildhood, you know, like growing up, because I had to become the man of the\n\nfamily at an early age; so I didn't have a lot of chance to do the play things\n\nthat kids do. So when you grow up and have the money, these things become\n\ntoys and it becomes fun to you.\n\nGROSS: I thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nMr. HAYES: Well, Terry, it's been my pleasure.\n\nDAVIES: Isaac Hayes speaking with Terry Gross in 1994. Hayes died yesterday\n\nin East Memphis, Tennessee. He was 65.\n\nComing up, we remember comedian Bernie Mac who died Saturday.\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Bernie Mac discusses his career as a comedian\n\nDAVE DAVIES, host:\n\nComedian Bernie Mac died Saturday at the age of 50 due to complications from\n\npneumonia. With his five year run on the Fox series \"The Bernie Mac Show,\" he\n\nwas one of the few African-Americans to play a leading role in a network\n\nprogram. In 2002, \"The Bernie Mac Show\" won an Emmy for Outstanding Writing\n\nand a Peabody Award. The real Bernie Mac became well known through the\n\nRussell Simmons Def Comedy Jam on HBO, and Spike Lee's performance film \"The\n\nOriginal Kings of Comedy.\" Bernie Mac also starred in \"Oceans 11\", 12,\" and\n\n\"13,\" as well as \"Bad Santa\" and \"Get on the Bus.\"\n\nTerry spoke with Bernie Mac in 2001 when \"The Bernie Mac Show\" was just\n\npremiering. The sitcom was loosely based on Mac's experiences raising his\n\ndaughter, his niece and his niece's child. On the show, Bernie Mac and his\n\nwife take in his sister's three young children because his sister has a drug\n\nproblem and is in rehab. In the first episode of the show, Bernie Mac talks\n\ndirectly to the audience about his new situation.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Bernie Mac Show\")\n\nMr. BERNIE MAC: America, let's talk. Yeah, my sister's on drugs. That's\n\nOK. Some of your family members messed up, too. What am I supposed to do?\n\nAllow these three kids to go to the state or some foster home or some white\n\ncouple. Hold on, this ain't about race. It's not about race. I just don't\n\nwant to hear them talking all proper like that, you know what I'm saying?\n\nThat's all I'm trying to say. Or they got to sit there and share food with 40\n\nother kids. No, that ain't right. I'm trying to do the right thing.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nDAVIES: Mac loves the kids he's now responsible for, but they also drive him\n\ncrazy.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Bernie Mac Show\")\n\nMr. MAC: I'm going to kill one of them kids. Oh, don't get me wrong, I love\n\n'em. They my blood. I'd give them the shirt off my back. You ever see a\n\nchicken with his neck wrung, laying to the side all lazy and weak? That's\n\nwhat I'm going to do to them kids. Talk back to me one more time, snap. I'm\n\ngonna snap they neck off. They too sassy. They too grown today. They talk\n\nback too much. Yeah, I know what you're saying, America. I don't care what\n\nyou're talking about. `Bernie Mac cruel. Bernie Mac beat his kids.' I don't\n\ncare. That's your opinion. Because you don't know the story. You don't know\n\nwhat went down. And they're not my kids.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nNow in the TV show, the Bernie Mac character is not used to being a father.\n\nMr. MAC: Right.\n\nGROSS: You know, he just inherited these three kids, and he's making a lot of\n\nmistakes. Now the most quoted line from the show so far is something he says\n\nto one of the kids. You know what the line is?\n\nMr. MAC: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Why don't you say it.\n\nMr. MAC: I'll bust your head 'til the white meat show.\n\nGROSS: That's it.\n\nMr. MAC: Was that it?\n\nGROSS: Yeah, because his impulse is always like if the kids are misbehaving,\n\nhit 'em.\n\nMr. MAC: Well...\n\nGROSS: And he doesn't really do it, but that's the impulse.\n\nMr. MAC: Well, he's from the old school. I mean, he believe that ruling\n\nwith an iron hand. And, I mean, you have to understand something. He comes\n\nfrom a generation, or that time period in the '70s and '60s where spankings\n\nwere permitted, and discipline was of the high regard. Bernie Mac has no idea\n\nabout parenting. And his way of parenting, he's still a disciplinarian. And\n\nhe believes in his heart strongly that a kid should be a kid. And that's\n\nwhere the problem lies. He's not PC. He's not worried about image. He's\n\nliving his life, and he's trying to save lives. And that's what makes the\n\nshow so interesting, and that's what makes the humor. The humor's not\n\npunch-line jokes. That's something I didn't want.\n\nGROSS: You grew up on the South Side of Chicago.\n\nMr. MAC: Yes, ma'am.\n\nGROSS: Describe where you grew up.\n\nMr. MAC: I grew up--I was born on 66th and Blackstone, and that building was\n\ntorn down because it was rat infested. We couldn't play outside because the\n\nrats used to be in the walls, on the bannisters. We stayed on the third\n\nfloor, and my mom used to literally pick me up--I was three to four years\n\nold--and she would walk me three flights of stairs and kicking rats from her\n\nfeet. The city tore the rat--I mean the building down and moved us to 69th\n\nand Morgan. Well, that was a little bit better supposedly, the Englewood area\n\nof Chicago. And at four years old, that's when I--four to five--decided I\n\nwanted to be a comedian. Because I walked in from playing, and I saw my\n\nmother sitting in her favorite chair crying. And as a little kid I saw her\n\ncrying, I began to cry, like most kids often do. And I asked her why was she\n\ncrying, and she told me, `Nothing.'\n\nAt that particular time, Ed Sullivan was introducing Bill Cosby. Bill Cosby\n\ncame out and he did a routine about rats and snakes in the bathroom. My\n\nmother began to laugh and cry at the same time. When I saw that, I started\n\nlaughing with her. And I told my mom, I said, `That's what I'm going to be,\n\nMom. I'm going to be a comedian so I never have to see you cry again.'\n\nBecause at that particular time, I thought comedians relieved my mother of her\n\npain. And that's something that I always wanted to do.\n\nGROSS: So what were some of the jokes that went over real big when you were a\n\nboy?\n\nMr. MAC: I think none. I think that I was a struggling comic, but in my\n\nmind I was successful. People said I was stupid, I was silly. They said I\n\nwas buffoonish. I used to dress up, put on my mother wig, put on my\n\ngrandmother slip coat. I'd dress up as a woman and portray as Bernice. That\n\nwas one of the characters that I created as a young boy, was Bernice. And it\n\nwasn't about being a homosexual or anything like that. I was portraying a\n\nwoman. And I used to talk like a woman, put on my grandmother glasses, and I\n\nused to mimic\n\n(Talking in female voice) `Y'all better quit playing up in here. Everybody\n\nbetter go to bed. I'm sick and tired of all this mess. Lord, Lord.'\n\nAnd that's how my grandmother used to talk.\n\nGROSS: Right. Who were the comics you loved to listen to when you were\n\ngrowing up?\n\nMr. MAC: Sweetheart, I was a student of the game, I had so many. I mean,\n\nfrom Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx, Moms Mabley, Pigmeat Markum, Jack Benny, Red\n\nSkelton, Johnny Carson, Steve Allen. Oh, I don't want to leave anybody out.\n\nJackie Gleason was one of my favorites. Norm Crosby, Don Rickles.\n\nGROSS: What did you do to try to figure out what it is that they did that was\n\nso funny? You said earlier that you tried to do impressions of comics that\n\nyou loved when you were young.\n\nMr. MAC: I watched what made them different. I watched what made them all\n\nsuccessful in their own way. And what made them all successful was style.\n\nThey had a unique style about themselves, not like today. You see one comic,\n\nand he gets hot, that's what they want everyone to be like. They want\n\neveryone to be like that individual. Don Rickles--I was so impressed with Don\n\nRickles, the way he can just come in and just destroy an entire room. I was\n\nso impressed. And I was not offended as a young boy watching this guy and\n\nsome of the things--Jews, blacks, Chinese. I mean, he tore you up, but you\n\nknew it was a joke. I got it right away. I was not offended. I was not\n\nsaying, `Did you hear what he said?' He was funny.\n\nJackie Gleason was so impressive to me, whereas he never rehearsed. He\n\nad-libbed so well, and he took--the energy that he had was something that I\n\nwanted. That's a page of his notebook that I've tested.\n\nGROSS: How did you figure out who you were going to be on stage as a comic?\n\nMr. MAC: I didn't figure it out until 1987. It's just something that came\n\nto me. I combined them all. Richard Pryor showed me how to laugh at\n\nyourself. That was something that was unheard of, to laugh at your pain.\n\nRedd Foxx was nothing but Richard Pryor, but he was denied. Richard Pryor\n\nmodified and moderated Redd Foxx. Redd Foxx made 43-plus albums. That's a\n\nhell of a lot of jokes. But America wasn't ready for Redd Foxx. They said he\n\nwas too blue. But Redd Foxx taught me how to be myself. Performing in\n\nHacienda Hotel in Las Vegas, he told me, he said, `You're a funny guy, but you\n\ndon't want to be funny. You want to be liked.' I didn't understand what he\n\nmeant at that particular time.\n\nWell, in 1987, I did a show in Chicago, and I was performing and I wasn't at\n\nmy best at that particular time, and a heckler kept heckling me. He was\n\nheckling everybody the whole entire night. And it was my turn. Everybody was\n\nreally scared to go up, because this guy was a big guy, big red neck. I mean,\n\nhe had a table full of cats, and they was just intimidating everybody. Well,\n\nI went up and I was not intimidated, and he said a few words. I kept trying\n\nto do my normal act. I got off my normal act, and I got on him, and the place\n\nwent crazy.\n\nDAVIES: Comedian Bernie Mac speaking with Terry Gross in 2001. We'll hear\n\nmore after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nDAVIES: Today we're remembering comedian Bernie Mac who died on Saturday.\n\nTerry spoke to him in 2001.\n\nGROSS: Now when you were getting started, did you play different kinds of\n\naudiences, some black audiences, some white audiences, some integrated\n\naudiences?\n\nMr. MAC: I performed wherever there was people. I started on the El's of\n\nChicago. In the '70s I used to ride the El's and perform from 95th Street all\n\nthe way downtown. I used to do the subways.\n\nGROSS: Wait, wait, wait. So how would you do it? You'd just walk into a car\n\nand start doing your act?\n\nMr. MAC: No, I never walked into a car. No, I never did that. What I used\n\nto do was, during the rush hour, people go to work. I would get on the end of\n\nthe El and I would go--and I would watch the news and I would read the paper,\n\nsee what was going on in the city. And I would get on, and people would first\n\nlook at me like I was a bum, until they got acquainted with me and they got\n\nfamiliar with me, and they said, `Oh, this guy, this guy, this is the El\n\ncomedian.' And I actually made people laugh. And I had a box, and people used\n\nto put money in the box. Then when I got to Lake Street, I used to go way\n\ndown in the subway, and as people be going back and forth, I would stand\n\nthere, and I had this little microphone, little B box thing, and it was like\n\nmy speaker; and I would tell jokes and I would talk about current events,\n\nthings that had happened in the neighborhood. And plus I would do little\n\ncharacters and stuff that I had back then. And people would throw money in\n\nthe box. I made 3 to $400 a day.\n\nGROSS: Wow, that's great.\n\nMr. MAC: But I was not happy.\n\nGROSS: That's probably more than some of the comedy clubs paid.\n\nMr. MAC: Yeah, but I wasn't happy.\n\nGROSS: Uh-huh.\n\nMr. MAC: I wasn't happy at all because I felt like I was begging. I felt\n\nlike a bum.\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. MAC: I wanted to be legitimized. In 1977, I went to the clubs.\n\nGROSS: Did you find that white audiences and black audiences reacted\n\ndifferently to your material, or reacted differently in general?\n\nMr. MAC: Well, they act different in general, because white audience come to\n\nbe entertained; black audience want to entertain you. And white audiences are\n\nmore cordial, more respectful of the artist. And even if you're bad, I mean,\n\nyou know, the audience has changed. I'm talking about the audience back then.\n\nThe audience has changed all the way around the table now. But white audience\n\nwas more cordial to you. Black audience are--they just tell you like it is.\n\nIf you suck, you suck, and they don't want to hear--you ain't getting nothing\n\nbut two or three minutes. You come out the gate with that old sorry stuff,\n\nyou in a world of trouble.\n\nGROSS: Now you opened for acts like Gladys Knight, The Temptations, The\n\nO'Jays. What's it like to open for big-name music acts? What were the pros\n\nand cons of that?\n\nMr. MAC: Well, the pros were that you made it, that you were on your way and\n\nyou were pretty good to be there. The cons were, if you believe that stuff,\n\nyou was in a world of trouble. You know, that's one reason why I don't hear\n\nthe voices. You know, you can be up today and down tomorrow. Comedy is\n\nsomething that, you know, you have to really, really have in your heart;\n\nsomething that you just don't wake up and say you want to do or be. Comedy is\n\nsomething that has to be in your bones, because it's you against the world.\n\nIn boxing, you have single activity, but a judge can determine your fate, or a\n\nreferee can stop the fight early. Tennis, hey, a bad call here and there can\n\ndetermine your fate. But comedy, you have no excuses. It's you and the mike,\n\nand a bunch of people who don't give a doggone about you. And then once you\n\nget out there, you're on your own. And that's one thing that I love about\n\ncomedy. I love that kind of pressure.\n\nGROSS: You're in the remake of \"Ocean's 11,\" the new versions of it. Who do\n\nyou play in it?\n\nMr. MAC: I play a character of the name of Frank Catton, who's a con man.\n\nI'm the cat that enabled everyone to get into the casinos, because I know the\n\ncasinos like the back of my hand. I play as a card dealer. I'm a con man.\n\nBut I get the maps and I lay everything out and I get us in and out of all\n\nthese casinos. And that's my job.\n\nGROSS: Were you a fan of the Rat Pack, and specifically of Sammy Davis Jr.,\n\nwhen you were young?\n\nMr. MAC: Oh, no question.\n\nGROSS: Yeah?\n\nMr. MAC: No question. Troy Bishop, Peter Lawford. I mean, Sammy, I thought\n\nthose cats were--Dean Martin. Dean Martin had a certain suave about him that\n\nwas undescribable. And honestly speaking, he sang better than Frank Sinatra.\n\nFrank Sinatra, I could think of a million other cats...\n\nGROSS: No. No way.\n\nMr. MAC: Oh, please.\n\nGROSS: No.\n\nMr. MAC: Frank Sinatra's over, overrated to me.\n\nGROSS: No.\n\nMr. MAC: But I like his persona. I like what he stood for, and I like the\n\nrespect that he had. Offstage, his presence was more powerful than all.\n\nFrank Sinatra was mediocre to me. Andy Williams, Mel Torme, Dean Martin tear\n\nhis tail up any day. Those are my favorites. And Dean Martin was funny.\n\nDean Martin had a certain pizazz about himself that was just unbelievable.\n\nFrank Sinatra just had that persona. He had that halo on him that people was\n\nafraid to touch. And there's nothing wrong with that. I think he's very\n\ntalented. I love the Rat Pack, but that's just my personal opinion of my\n\nfavorite. I can name some more: Perry Como, much better singer.\n\nGROSS: Now you're my guest, so I'm not going to argue with you about Andy\n\nWilliams being a better singer than Frank Sinatra.\n\nMr. MAC: OK.\n\nGROSS: But if we meet on the street sometime...\n\nMr. MAC: You know what?\n\nGROSS: ...we'll talk more about it.\n\nMr. MAC: That's a beautiful day.\n\n(Singing) \"I got my candy.\"\n\nOh, he was all right. He was all right. And I'll tell you what, whenever you\n\nmeet me, we've got to debate.\n\nGROSS: You bet. I have strong feelings about Sinatra.\n\nMr. MAC: I got facts. I'm bringing facts with me.\n\nGROSS: OK. I've got strong feelings about Andy Williams, too. I never\n\nreally liked him.\n\nMr. MAC: OK. That's all right. But he beat Frank.\n\nGROSS: All right.\n\nMr. MAC: All right, baby.\n\nDAVIES: Comedian Bernie Mac speaking with Terry Gross in 2001. He died on\n\nSaturday at the age of 50. He'll appear in the film \"Soul Man\" which is\n\nscheduled to be released later this year. In it he plays a soul singer\n\nreturning to the stage after 20 years. The film also features Isaac Hayes as\n\nhimself.\n\n(Credits)\n\nDAVIES: For Terry Gross, I'm Dave Davies.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Soul Man\")\n\nUnidentified Singers: (Singing) I'm a soul man, yeah\n\nI'm a soul man\n\nGrab the ropes and I'll pull you in\n\nGive you hope and be your only boyfriend\n\nYeah, yeah"
