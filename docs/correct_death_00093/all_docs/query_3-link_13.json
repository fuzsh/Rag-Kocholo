        "text": "Isaac Hayes (born August 20, 1942, Covington, Tennessee, U.S.—died August 10, 2008, East Memphis, Tennessee) was an American singer-songwriter, musician, and actor who was a pioneering figure in soul music. His recordings influenced the development of such musical genres as disco, rap, and urban contemporary. The charismatic performer— known for his shaved head, dark sunglasses, and smooth baritone voice—was perhaps best remembered for his compelling sound track for the 1971 film Shaft; the title song, “Theme from Shaft,” became a number one hit and earned Hayes an Academy Award for best original song. Hayes reached his greatest popularity in the late 1960s and ’70s, placing (1969–76) 10 consecutive albums on the American pop and rhythm and blues charts.\n\nHayes was a self-taught pianist and saxophonist. He began his professional career performing at Memphis nightclubs and was eventually hired as a session musician for Memphis-based Stax Records; he went on to become one of the label’s most successful songwriters. Although Hayes’s debut solo album, Presenting Isaac Hayes (1967), did not fare well commercially, his next release, Hot Buttered Soul (1969), sold more than one million copies and established him as a star. Among his other notable albums were Black Moses (1971), Joy (1973), Live at the Sahara Tahoe (1973), and Chocolate Chip (1975).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
