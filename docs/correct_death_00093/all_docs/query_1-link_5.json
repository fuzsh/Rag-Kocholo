        "text": "Isaac Hayes died of a stroke, officials announced Tuesday. The iconic soul singer died last Sunday and was found at his Memphis home. At that time, the cause of death unknown.\n\nThough there was no autopsy, the cause of death was given as a stroke in paperwork filed by Dr David Kraus, Hayes' family physician. Sheriff spokesman Steve Shular said that Kraus had been treating Hayes for high blood pressure.\n\nParamedics found Hayes after responding to a 911 call. The 65-year-old was lying on the floor next to a running treadmill.\n\nHayes had also suffered a stroke in early 2006. The singer was best known for his work on the Shaft soundtrack and his own hot, soul work. He was also a regular on the controversial cartoon South Park."
