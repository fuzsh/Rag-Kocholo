        "text": "Isaac Lee Hayes, Jr., 65, was found dead in his home just outside Memphis, Tennessee in the early morning hours of August 10, 2008, according to Shelby County Tennessee Sheriff’s Department spokesperson Steve Shular. He died 10 days before his 66th birthday.\n\nA Shelby County sheriff’s deputy responded to Hayes’ home after his wife found him on the floor near a treadmill inside his home. Hayes was taken to Baptist East Hospital in Memphis, where he was pronounced dead at 2:08 a.m.\n\nDeputies with the Shelby County Sheriff’s Department are continuing their investigation into Hayes death, but believe no foul play was involved.\n\nBorn in Covington, Tennessee, he was raised by his grandparents. The child of a poor family, he grew up picking cotton. He began singing at age five at his local church and soon after taught himself to play piano, electronic organ, flute and saxophone. He dropped out of high school but later earned his diploma at age 21.\n\nHe earned Academy Awards in 1972 for Best Original Song and Score for Theme from Shaft. He also won Grammy’s for the same body of work.\n\nHayes joined Scientology in 1995. He and another Scientologist musician, Doug E. Fresh, recorded an album in 2001 called The Joy Of Creating – The golden Era Musicians And Friends Play L. Ron Hubbard. The album incorporated Scientology themes in the lyrics.\n\nDuring the late 1990’s, Hayes became popular as the voice of Chef on the Comedy Central series South Park as a soul singing cafeteria worker at the school.\n\nThe soul and funk singer-songwriter, musician, record producer, arranger, composer and actor was the father of 12 children, 14 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His fourth wife Adjowa Hayes gave birth to a son named Nana Kwadjo Hayes on April 10, 2006.\n\nCheck out more photos below."
