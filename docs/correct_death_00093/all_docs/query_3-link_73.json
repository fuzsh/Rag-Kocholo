        "text": "Like thousands of other British teens in 1969, I'd never seen anything like it, and yet it drew me - Isaac Hayes's bald, black, beautiful scalp on the album sleeve of Hot Buttered Soul. The tactile visual made me want to caress it. \"I'm talking about the power of love now,\" Hayes breathed sexily. His earthy directness resonated all the way from the Stax Studios in Memphis to Hampstead, where (so High Fidelity!) I was kissing the bloke from the local record shop while babysitting for folk diva Sandy Denny's drummer. Hayes taught his love lessons in languorous rhythms urged on by velvety strings, and the wah-wah guitar's shudder climaxed in a vibrating crescendo.\n\nHayes, who died of a stroke on Sunday at the age of 65, often said that his unprecedented extended vamps (some 18 minutes long) let radio DJs get a coffee - but we girls understood that it also gave us time to negotiate how many bases we'd get to, with Base One being the raising of the blouse. Although Hayes was an acclaimed songwriter, arranger and producer, on his own albums he didn't grab all the publishing - underlining his giving spirit. Instead he chose to interpret unlikely tracks such as Glen Campbell's By the Time I Get to Phoenix and Burt Bacharach and Hal David's Walk On By.\n\nDecades later, I was to benefit from that generosity as Hayes explored profound personal soul themes with me in interviews for two books. He introduced The Black Chord, my collaboration with photographer David Corio, tracing the flow of music through the African diaspora. \"I first heard African drum rhythms and chants at the movies,\" Hayes explained, his voice deep, wry and knowing, just as it was on his discs. \"Then, when I had the opportunity to go to Africa and visit the villages, I heard the real, raw, true rhythms and realised the origins of the old Negro spirituals I grew up with in the South.\"\n\nFor Hayes, music was always linked to spirituality and consciousness. \"Guys in slavery sang praises to the Lord to deliver them from bondage. That was one of the few things we were allowed to do - praise, pray, worship and sing spirituals - and they'd let us sing the blues as well,\" he added with classic Isaac irony. \"Blues evolved into gospel, a cry for deliverance or the hereafter; and the relief and celebration of passing over from this life to another.\"\n\nSuch cosmic and artistic understanding was encoded in Hayes's DNA. \"When I was three years old in Tennessee,\" he told me, \"we'd sit on the porch at night and sing those Negro spirituals. Our church was a frame building right across the road from the tin-roofed house where I was born. In church I'd hear my grandfather sing His Eye Is on the Sparrow, so loud and raw that my grandmother used to go, \"Shhh!\" I remember all of that. It was really inspirational for me.\"\n\n\"When I recorded Black Moses in 1971, my marriage was breaking up and I was broken-hearted,\" he said. \"Most of the titles were about relationships ending. It was sad. I used to stand in front of the mic and cry. I had to have my secretary hold my hand while I was singing tunes like Help Me Love [which Portishead sampled on their Dummy album]. The record company named it Black Moses because of the influence I'd gained. But the subject matter reflected a man mourning a relationship that had hit the rocks.\"\n\nHayes delved into his 1971 Black Moses persona to help me with The Book of Exodus: the Making and Meaning of Bob Marley and the Wailers' Album of the Century. He told me a security guard at an ecstatic show had given him the Biblical name, and it was picked up by the media. \"I thought it a bit sacrilegious. But when I realised the relevance it had to black people, I wore it with pride,\" explained Hayes. \"We had just come through the civil rights struggle with Dr King, and black people needed unity. A bald-headed black guy wearing the chains that once represented bondage and slavery now made them represent power. It meant something.\"\n\nJust as we were about to hang up from one interview, Hayes exclaimed: \"There's one more thing I want to tell you. When I was Black Moses, wearing those chains across my bare chest, and when I had the chrome on my Cadillac that's now in the Stax Museum of American Soul Music dipped in gold like a chariot, I never thought of the [parallels with] pharaohs in Ancient Egypt. Then, in 1992, I [was] crowned a king in Ghana, the home of my ancestors. It was like history repeating itself, because I'd always felt I'd lived before as some kind of royalty. I feel I have a responsibility. I influence people, hopefully on the positive side. That's why I started the Isaac Hayes Foundation to teach literacy and music in American schools, and built a school in Ghana.\"\n\nHaving explored my own youthful sensuality to Hayes's croon, it came as something of a shock in the 1990s to hear the tones of Black Moses voicing Chef in the irreverent cartoon South Park. The role won Hayes a whole new generation of fans, but for me Isaac Hayes will always be about walking on by, and pondering the power of love."
