Next year's Oscar's obituary tribute will run an hour long at this rate...\n\nI guess it doesn't matter too much then that he left South Park over \"making fun\" of Scientology. Can anyone say hypocrite? He would've been leaving soon enough anyway.\n\nI'm sure he was a good guy and all that.\n\nWillKill4Food said:\n\nPeople die. All the time. It's nothing strange. Sh!t happens.\n\nIndeed. It's true.\n\n*inserts more mumbo jumbo*\n\nAgent Crab said:\n\nIndeed. It's true.\n\n*inserts more mumbo jumbo*\n\nI was just replying to Nurhachi's post. There's nothing wierd about it, it just happened.\n\nIt's random.\n\nEvery man dies at one point in his life. You just have to make sure that you live during your life.\n\nNo Ticket said:\n\nI guess it doesn't matter too much then that he left South Park over \"making fun\" of Scientology.\n\nExactly.\n\nYou should be able to make fun of yourself."
