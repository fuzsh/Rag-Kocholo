He contributed significantly to Stax’s “Soul Explosion” and wrote or co-wrote hundreds of songs, earning a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Songwriters Hall of Fame, two Grammys, and numerous other awards. Hayes was also dedicated to fighting police brutality, workplace discrimination, and unfair housing during his life. As part of this campaign, he cofounded the Black Knights with Warren Lewis in the 1970s to assist families with necessities like food and clothing."
