        "text": "The world was still mourning the death of comedian Bernie Mac from pneumonia on Saturday, August 9, when another piece of bad news came a day later.\n\nIsaac Hayes, the deep-voiced soul music star who won an Oscar for writing the theme song to the movie \"Shaft,\" is no more.\n\nHe died over the weekend from a stroke related to high blood pressure, according to Memphis authorities.\n\nHayes, 65, who once described himself as a \"health fanatic,\" was being treated for high blood pressure and had suffered a non-fatal stroke last year.\n\nHis body was found next to a running treadmill on Sunday in his Memphis home, and there was no indication he had hit his head or suffered any trauma, according to the Shelby County Medical Examiner, Dr. David Kraus, who concluded Hayes died from a stroke.\n\nHayes, who was born in Tennessee, wrote for a stable of stars at Memphis soul label Stax Records during the 1960s, emerging as a performer in his own right with the album \"Hot Buttered Soul.\"\n\nHe was the first black composer to win an Oscar, for the 1971 hit \"Theme from 'Shaft.'\"\n\nHe eventually teamed with lyricist David Porter to write and produce songs for the soul duo Sam and Dave, including \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On! I'm A Comin'.\"\n\nHayes told Reuters in 2005 that he came up with the introductory horn line for the latter tune while Porter was in the bathroom.\n\nHe yelled at his collaborator to hurry up, and so Porter barreled out with pants around his ankles, yelling the words that would become the song's title.\n\nWith his shaved head, dark shades, extravagant clothing and plentiful jewelry, Hayes was groomed as a star by Stax executives. He released his debut album, the poor-selling \"Presenting Isaac Hayes,\" in 1968.\n\nHe broke through the following year with \"Hot Buttered Soul,\" which contained just four songs but sold over a million copies.\n\nChastened by his unsuccessful debut, Hayes took artistic control of the follow-up.\n\nEven though he was a successful songwriter, three of the four tunes were covers that he reinvented, including an 18-minute version of Jimmy Webb's \"By the Time I Get To Phoenix.\"\n\nHayes' work on director Gordon Parks' urban crime drama \"Shaft,\" a project he had hoped to star in, was the first of many forays into movie soundtracks.\n\nHe got in front of the camera for the 1974 cult classic \"Truck Turner\" and kept busy with film work. He had a cameo role in an episode of \"The Bernie Mac Show.\"\n\nHayes left Stax in a dispute over royalties in 1975, the year the faltering label went bankrupt. He filed for bankruptcy shortly thereafter and lost all his songwriting royalties.\n\nIn his later years, Hayes reached a new audience by supplying the voice for Chef, the libidinous sage on the cartoon series \"South Park.\"\n\nBut he left the show a few years ago because he disagreed with its attacks on Scientology, the religious movement to which he belonged."
