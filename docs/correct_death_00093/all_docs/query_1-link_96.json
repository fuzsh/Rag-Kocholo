        "text": "On Sunday August 10, icon Isaac Hayes was reported dead by Memphis’ WMCTV; Hayes was 65 years old. Shelby County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Steve Shular confirmed the death to the local news, claiming that Hayes‘ wife called police and ambulance after finding him unconsciousness near the treadmill in their Tennessee home.\n\nRushed to Baptist East Hospital in Memphis, Hayes was pronounced dead shortly after two o’clock this morning. An investigation is underway, though foul play has been reportedly ruled out.\n\nIsaac Hayes was a musician on the legendary Stax label, writing, composing and producing dozens of hit and critically acclaimed songs and albums.\n\nIn Hip Hop, he had collaborated with the likes of RZA and Wu-Tang Clan (“I Can’t Go To Sleep” [click to read]), Ice Cube (“I Gotta Say What Up!!!”) and Guru (“Night Vision”). His work has also been sampled on hit singles by Jay-Z (“Can I Live”), MF DOOM (“Dead Bent”) and The Geto Boys (“My Mind Playin’ Tricks On Me”). His albums Black Moses and Hot Buttered Soul are often revered as essentials by numerous Hip Hop producers.\n\nIn Pop culture, the musician and actor is best remembered for his work scoring the 1971 film Shaft and his longtime voice of Chef on South Park. Earlier this month, Hayes was touring with former label-mates Eddie Floyd and The Bar-Kays.
