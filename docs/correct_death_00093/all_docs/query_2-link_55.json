        "text": "Isaac Hayes Tribute Added To \"Hip Hop Honors.\"\n\nOctober 2nd, 2008 | Author: Omar BurgessIsaac Hayes may have died on Aug. 10, 2008, but his legacy lives on. The Tennessee-born soul legend has often been lauded for his impact with Stax and his own Hot Buttered Soul label, and now members of the Hip Hop crowd will pay tribute at this year's Hip Hop Honors celebration.\n\nDuring the fifth installment of VH1's Hip Hop Honors, the Roots, Chuck D of Public Enemy and other artists will participate in a separate tribute to the musician affectionately known as \"Black Moses.\"\n\n\"If Isaac Hayes is not sampled as much as James Brown, he’s right up there, in terms of being sampled prominently in Hip Hop,\" says Hip Hop Honors co-executive producer Nelson George. In addition to other artists, Public Enemy sampled Hayes' \"Hyperbolicsyllabicsequedalymistic,\" in their well-known single \"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\" [click to read].\n\nGeorge wasn't specific as to which other artists will honor Hayes when they take the stage Oct. 6, but he did stress the importance of connecting artists such as Isaac Hayes with the current generation.\n\n\"Chuck D, the Roots and perhaps one more element, which we’re still working out, will perform a medley of Isaac Hayes’ songs and the songs that sample him,\" says George. \"We weren’t really able to put that together for James Brown. The timing just didn’t work out, and there have also been a lot of James Brown tributes already. I do think the idea of making the connection between Soul, Funk and Hip Hop is something we’re really going to try to do more of in the future.\"\n\nHip Hop Honors airs Oct. 6 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on VH1. A dedicated website is available at HipHop.VH1.com.\n\nAllhiphop.com's Illseed posted this today about the Hip Hop Honors:\n\nhttp://allhiphop.com/stories/rumors/archiv...3/20549555.aspx\n\nTHE VH1 HIP-HOP HONORS\n\nI heard the VH1 Hip-Hop Honors was a pretty good show with Cypress Hill, De La Soul, Naughty By Nature, Slick Rick, Too $hort…and one more. Guess who gets honored in addition to these fine people. It was taped last night in New York City. Read and see how it went from somebody that was on the inside! It is NOT edited. It is raw and uncut!\n\nHere is the run down:\n\nFirst of all, there were a lot of people running around the place. People like Chuck Chillout, Monie Love, Young Guru (Jay-Z's engineer),\n\nThe event is cool so far\n\nCypress Hill's rock superstar rocked! It was never one of my fav songs, but it translated well in the live performance. Plus, sen dog got to rap.\n\nMc lyte aint aged in 10 years or more.\n\nI heard biz markie did a lil kool g rap set. He's got to be feeling some emotions about this.\n\nI feel prince paul should have been included with de la soul.\n\npublic enemy, epmd and cee lo (in all silver) honored de la soul. has epmd been honored yet????? Cee-Lo performed \"potholes in my lawn\" while dressed as a silver highlighter…it had to be said.\n\nHoping slick rick is last.\n\nKnow naughty is last though.\n\npublic enemy, epmd and cee lo (in all silver) honored de la soul. has epmd been honored yet????? about\n\nkid rock on the too short dedication...ok...\n\nthe de la soul dedication was bizarre...odd\n\non \"me myself and I,\" pos of de la soul changed the rhyme and said \"we hate this song\"\n\nmonie love was in the house and should have been included on “buddy” with q-tip\n\nthey put slick rick 3rd....wow!\n\n“lodidodi” by biz markie and ghostface!!!! killer!!! Where is dougie fresh @\n\nbust and spliff star rocked it perfect!!!\n\neve has GREAT management! slick rick is about to kill it tho.....a children’s story!\n\neve has great management, she got booked for the dedication to slick rick...in fact, so do lyte, fat joe, fab, PE, tip busta, mos – they all have great managers!\n\nthe price of gold is up...slick rick will hv no issues with all that jewelry in this economy. That’s better than money round these parts!\n\nwow....they threw an issac hayes dedication in there!!!! estelle mos def chuck d and questlove\n\ntoo short is the OG, but I'm not sure about this right here, right now...\n\nJuelz Santana did a Lupe and forgot some of the naughty by nature lyrics. No biggie.\n\nnaughty is the only group that can bring a damn posse on stage at hip hop honors. \"uptown anthem rules\"\n\nBONUS!\n\nCee Lo, Chuck D of Public, Enemy, Scarface, Estelle and Mos Def others paid homage to the late Isaac Hayes! HOT – this was probably the best moment of the night..aside from naughty’s “uptown anthem”\n\nHip-Hop Honors airs Oct. 6 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on VH1.\n\nHere is a more organized rundown…in the form of a press release:\n\nVH1 brought down the house tonight at the 5th annual \"VH1 Hip Hop Honors\" as the best of the best in hip hop royalty came together for one legendary night to honor the ones who came before them and transformed the genre into a true cultural phenomenon.\n\nTaped at the Hammerstein Ballroom this evening (Thursday, October 2) in New York City and hosted by Tracy Morgan, the music and influence of each of the honorees was recognized through performances by classic artists in collaboration with today's hottest new talent. This year, \"VH1 Hip Hop Honors\" paid tribute to Cypress Hill, De La Soul, Naughty By Nature, Slick Rick and Too $hort.\n\nThe Cypress Hill tribute kicked off the night with an introduction by Freddy Rodriguez. Fat Joe, Jim Jones and Gym Class Heroes drove the crowd insane with the group's hit songs \"The Phuncky Feel One,\" \"I Ain't Goin' Out Like That,\" and \"Insane In the Membrane.\" Cypress Hill lit up the stage with performances of \"DJ Scratch Intro,\" \"How I Could Just Kill A Man,\" and \"(Rock) Superstar.\"\n\nActress Joy Bryant introduced the second tribute of the night, honorees De La Soul, who took it way back with performances from Estelle, Mos Def, Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Cee-Lo and EPMD. They tore the roof off with the group's biggest hits, \"A Roller Skating Jam Named 'Saturdays,'\" \"Stakes Is High,\" \"Potholes In My Lawn,\" and \"Ego Trippin.'\" Topping off the performance, De La Soul broke it down true old school style reminding the crowd that they can still get down, breaking out in a medley of old school rhymes from \"Me, Myself and I\" to a remix of \"Buddy!\"\n\nThe show continued on a \"slick\" note with hits that defined Slick Rick's solo career. Legendary rapper MC Lyte kicked off the tribute with \"The Ruler's Back.\" The crowd went crazy when Busta Rhymes and Spliff Star took the stage performing the \"The Show\" which brought everyone to their feet. They led into a true hip hop medley with the legendary Biz Markie and Ghostface Killah singing \"La Di Da Di.\" Finally Eve took the stage with her rendition of the eclectic hip hop chart topper \"Mona Lisa.\" Slick Rick then took to the stage performing \"Hey Young World\" and \"Children's Story.\"\n\nNext, in honor of R&B legend Isaac Hayes, a medley of artists took the stage to salute the icon. Mos Def took the stage first, outfitted in dark shades, setting it off with the hit theme song from \"Shaft.\" Next British sweetheart Estelle performed a remix of \"I Love You,\" and Cee-Lo kept the crowd grooving with \"The Look of Love.\" Next on stage, Scarface dazzled the crowd with \"My Mind Is Playing Tricks On Me.\" Closing out this special tribute was Chuck D with \"Black Steel In The Hour of Chaos.\"\n\nHip hop entrepreneur and producer Luke Campbell took the stage to introduce Too $hort. Luke talked about how he set the stage and paved the way for Too $hort to become the artist he is today. Also paying homage to Too $hort, Kid Rock gave a thrilling performance of \"Life Is Too Short.\" Lil John got low with \"Shake That Monkey\" followed by a duet with Bun B of the electric \"Blow the Whistle.\" After an intro performance of \"The Ghetto\" by Scarface, Too $hort got the crowd on their feet with \"Gettin' It\" and \"Money In The Ghetto.\"\n\nBringing the show to an unforgettable end, Wyclef Jean, Juelz Santana and Big Boi ripped the stage with the all-time favorites, \"No Woman No Cry,\" \"Everything's Gonna Be All Right,\" and the monster hit \"O.P.P.\" Naughty By Nature closed the show as only they could do, performing \"Uptown Anthem\" and \"Hip Hop Hooray.\""
