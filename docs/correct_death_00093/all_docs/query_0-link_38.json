(AP) - The Memphis restaurant and nightclub bearing soul singer Isaac Hayes' name has closed.\n\nThe club at Peabody Place has been open for five years and underwent a remodeling in 2003.\n\nIn a written statement, Hayes thanked the patrons who supported the club and said it was disappointing it didn't work out.\n\nYesterday was the last day of operation.\n\nBelz Enterprises senior vice president Andy Groveman says the restaurant closure won't have much effect on the center.\n\nHe says Belz will be able to lease the 18,000 square feet, most likely to a retailer, which Groveman says would be a better fit.\n\n(Copyright 2007 by The Associated Press.
