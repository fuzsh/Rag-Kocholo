        "text": "Isaac Hayes, the iconic soul man whose sexy baritone earned him the nickname “the Black Moses” – and who became the first black composer to snag an Oscar – died today at his Memphis home, officials said. He was 65.\n\nShelby County Sheriff’s spokesman Shular Shelby said officers went to Hayes’ home after his wife found him on the floor near a treadmill in his house. Hayes was pronounced dead at 2:08 a.m. at Baptist East Hospital in Memphis.\n\nHayes, who won an Oscar for his 1971 “The Theme from Shaft” – a song he reportedly wrote in just three days – suffered a stroke in 2006. But in a July 30 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the singer-songwriter said he was still busy.\n\n“Music is my life,” he said in the telephone interview, noting he was expecting to release an album later this year. “So I wasn’t going to quit,”\n\nHis best-known work remains the “Shaft” theme, which brassily declared the film’s private detective hero to be a bad motherf***** – and won him the Oscar for best song.\n\nHayes said he’d also been shooting a film “Soul Men” starring Samuel L. Jackson and Bernie Mac and had a role in a new Steven Segal flick, the newspaper said.\n\nMac died Saturday in the Chicago hospital where he was being treated for pneumonia.\n\nHayes ran into some controversy over his 2006 departure as the voice of “Chef” on Comedy Central’s “South Park” – which he’d played since 1997. As a Scientologist, Hayes objected to the irreverent comedy’s spoof on followers of the group.\n\nHayes said he quickly dashed off “Shaft” after getting the nod from movie director Gordon Parks. The film was the first major studio production to be directed by a black filmmaker.\n\nHayes worked for Stax Records in the 1960s, and with writing partner David Porter penned some of the biggest hits for R & B stalwarts Sam and Dave like, “You Don’t Know Like I Know,” “Hold On I’m Coming” and the Grammy-winning “Soul Man.”\n\n“We were like a big family,” Hayes told the paper.\n\nHayes also worked with Otis Redding, Booker T and the MGs, the Bar-Kays and Rufus Thomas of “Funky Chicken” fame.\n\nBut Hayes’ work as a singer shot him to fame around the world, starting with his 1969 album, “Hot Buttered Soul.”\n\nWith his bald head, low growl and shirt made out of chains, Hayes became a sex symbol who was nicknamed “the Black Moses.”"
