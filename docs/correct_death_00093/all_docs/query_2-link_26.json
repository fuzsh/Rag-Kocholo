        "text": "Legendary soul musician Isaac Hayes may get a memorial stretch of highway in his home state of Tennessee.\n\nA measure to designate a section of Interstate 40 the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway passed the state Senate unanimously Thursday. The House approved it without opposition in April.\n\nThe commemorative stretch would be near Memphis, where Hayes had a home until he died of a stroke in 2008 at the age of 65. He was raised in Tipton County, north of Memphis.\n\nThe bill now goes to Gov. Phil Bredesen, who is not expected to oppose it.\n\nThe deep-voiced singer won Academy and Grammy awards for his Theme From Shaft. He was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. He also acted in movies and provided the voice of Chef on the animated TV show South Park."
