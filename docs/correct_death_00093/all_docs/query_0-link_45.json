        "text": "Helen Washington, a child diamond thief turned dancer who shaved her head to join Isaac Hayes on tour and on the cover of Ebony magazine, providing a striking complement to the famously bald singer during his \"Black Moses\" heyday, died Thursday at the age of 78.\n\nWashington — who overcame a tough early life, complete with prison sentence, before finding a positive outlet for her energies at Stax — died at the Rainbow Rehab & Healthcare Center in Bartlett, a long-term nursing-care facility. Donna Washington Kirkwood, Washington's daughter, said her mother had been struggling with dementia and other health problems.\n\nDescribed by Stax Museum of American Soul Music co-founder Deanie Parker as \"a beautiful, sensuous Black woman with a perfectly bald head,\" Washington in the 1970s presented an iconic and even regal embodiment of Black female strength and confidence that drew from African history while presaging such popular current representations of Black pride as the Dora Milaje, the Wakandan woman warriors of the \"Black Panther\" movies, and the distinctively coiffed Viola Davis in \"The Woman King,\" not to mention such artists as the Jamaica-born singer Grace Jones.\n\nIn tandem with Hayes, whose bold fashion sense included chain-link vests and fur boots, Washington epitomized the \"Black Is Beautiful\" and \"Black Power\" messages that were emboldening American youth and influencing the increasingly political soul music landscape. As a member of the Isaac Hayes Movement stage show, an elaborate production with multiple musicians and backup singers built around Hayes' epic arrangements of pop standards and original compositions, she used dance to express and comment on the message of the music.\n\nSoon, newspapers dubbed her \"The Queen of the Isaac Hayes Movement.\"\n\n\"She had a persona and a presence that really worked,\" said Stax artist David Porter, 81, Hayes' songwriting partner on such hits as \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"\n\nPorter said Hayes \"always had an artistic concept in mind,\" and Washington, with her matching shaved head, provided \"an individuality but also a powerful way to connect with his image.\"\n\nHe said he believed Washington first joined Hayes on tour in the wake of Hayes' hit \"Hot Buttered Soul\" album, which Stax released in June 1969. (According to some published reports, Washington was Porter's niece, but Porter said that was not true.)\n\n\"She had a commanding presence onstage,\" Parker said. \"She was very graceful. She was unique and naturally creative. All those movements had her signature on them. It really did dramatize in a different kind of way the esthetics of the Isaac Hayes Movement.\"\n\nWashington's distinctive appearance also made her a natural for photo shoots and publicity campaigns.\n\nIn 1972, she and Hayes appeared together on the cover of Ebony magazine, with Washington's chin perched atop the singer's bald head, long corkscrew earrings dangling from her lobes.\n\nThe story that accompanied that memorable cover was one of several in the news media of the era that chronicled Washington's pre-show business struggles while rhapsodizing over her stage presence.\n\n\"She floats on stage as if on invisible wings,\" Ebony reported, under the headline \"Ex-Con Dancer Finds Savior in 'Black Moses.'\" \"Her sylph-like figure, supple, flowing, enchanting, is incongruously topped by a head as hairless as a cueball, a head that glistens brightly in the glare of the spotlight.\"\n\nThe Ebony story describes Washington as \"a con artist since childhood.\" Kirkwood said her mother had \"a tough life. I think she was a diamond thief once upon a time. She did a lot of stuff.\" Or, as Ebony put it: \"A child of the streets, Helen was always a smart little cookie.\"\n\nWashington was born in Memphis, but largely raised by her grandmother in the Harlem neighborhood of New York.\n\nIn a 1972 profile in the Memphis Press-Scimitar, the city's evening daily newspaper, Washington said she turned to crime as a child. \"Kids didn't have the things they needed, so they stole,\" she said. She said she stole a tray of diamond rings from a Memphis jewelry store at age 13.\n\nBy her early 20s, Washington was an inmate at what was then known as the Tennessee Prison for Women in Nashville, on larceny and assault-and-battery charges. After serving five years, she began hanging around at Stax. Inspired by her old Manassas High School classmate, Isaac Hayes, she wanted to become a songwriter.\n\n\"She would come in and say, 'I've got a smash hit!,' so we started calling her 'Smash,'\" said Mickey Gregory, 84, bandleader and longtime trumpet player for Hayes.\n\nHe said Washington first joined the Hayes group on the road as a sort of wardrobe assistant. But when she shaved her head, she was incorporated into the act, and soon the self-taught artist was playing a key role onstage (to riotous applause, she lifted the hat that revealed Hayes' bald head to the crowd) and leading a retinue of dancers. \"From the onset, the dancers brought a new energy to the show,\" Gregory said.\n\nWashington also found some success as a songwriter. She is credited as composer or co-writer on recordings from the 1970s and '80s by Albert King, the Bar-Kays and Luther Ingram. Her song \"I'm Afraid of Losing You,\" written with Darryl Carter, has been covered by such Stax and Hi artists as the Mad Lads, Betty Everett and Quiet Elegance.\n\nTrouble was not through with Washington, however. In 1973, her husband, a Hayes bodyguard identified as Roosevelt \"Cue\" Gilliam by the Press-Scimitar, shot Washington in the left shoulder and then killed himself, inside the couple's Whitehaven home.\n\nAfter Stax's economic woes resulted in the company's closure in 1975, Washington let her hair grow, literally. She became a dance instructor at Lemoyne-Owen College and continued to work in entertainment in various capacities, often behind the scenes, organizing dancers for nonprofits, club shows and special events.\n\nSaid Kirkwood: \"If you wrote her whole story, you'd write a book. She really was one of the queens of Memphis. She made her mark.\"\n\nIn addition to her daughter, who lives in Eads, Tennessee, Washington leaves a sister, Jane Waye, of Cleveland, Ohio; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren."
