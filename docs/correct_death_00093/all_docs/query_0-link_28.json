Family members had gone to the grocery store and left him (at) home.\n\n\"When the family came home around one, his wife's cousin found him lying on the floor in the basement near a treadmill. The treadmill was running, so it is believed that he had been working out.\"\n\nAnd although the hospital is yet to determine a cause of death, it is believed the musician died of natural causes.\n\nShular adds: \"There doesn't seem to be any foul play. We don't see anything suspicious about his death. There will be a further statement from the hospital about the cause of death.\"\n\nHayes is survived by his wife Adjowa and their child, as well as five other children from two previous marriages."
