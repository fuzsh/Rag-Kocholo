Soul legend Isaac Hayes was found dead at his home in Memphis, Tennessee earlier today (Sunday).

Hayes, who was 65 years old, was found lying near a treadmill at his home by his wife, and was pronounced dead an hour later at Baptist East Hospital in Memphis.

The singer was seen as a pioneer in black music in the early '70s and beyond on the famous Stax label, recording albums such as 'Black Moses' and 'Hot Buttered Soul', and enjoyed further career success in the '90s as the voice of 'Chef' from cartoon series South Park.

He is survived by his 12 children, 14 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.
