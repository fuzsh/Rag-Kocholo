        "text": "In 2010, Steve Jobs sent an email to himself and it read: I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds. I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language did not invent or refine I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate. I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with, I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being. —End (Apple co-founder Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011) Be grateful for the people in your life and let them know that they matter."
