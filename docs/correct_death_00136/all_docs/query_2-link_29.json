        "text": "Introduction\n\nSteve Jobs is undoubtedly one of the most influential people to ever grace the tech scene and the person who helped Apple become one the biggest companies in the world by laying the foundation that Apple would then build upon to reach the status it has reached to this day.\n\nHe was considered to be a genius and figure that represented the Apple way for so many years having given so many years to this company. He always had an idea in mind of where he wanted to lead Apple and was there since the beginning and helped Apple through some tough times.\n\nSo, it was a great loss, not only to the company that he gave years to but to the whole world when he passed away back on the fifth of October, 2011 at the young age of 56.\n\nThe start of his health problems\n\nBack in October of 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which generally has a very poor prognosis when it comes to responding to treatment however this was not the case for the rare cancer Jobs had. In 2004, he announced having a rare type of cancer that was not aggressive known as an islet cell neuroendocrine tumor which is actually one of the rare types considered to be treatable and had a better prognosis than normal."
