        "text": "I wont lie, falling asleep at the wheel, 5 am on a Tuesday night, after a work related car accident with a tree and 9 operations later was the best thing that ever happened to me!\n\nReflecting 25 years later, this was a defining but an embarrassing moment for an ambitious 20 y.o. who had everything at his finger tips and blew it! It has so far been an crazy, amazing but self-fulfilling journey. I would not change a thing.\n\nPhoto: 1990 David Dahm's actual car that crashed into a tree.\n\nAn experienced journalist once said to me, \"David we are all headed for the same tree. You just got there before the rest of us!\" I found this out at the age of 20. In 1990 I was a real \"Volvo\" crash test dummy. I lived to tell the tale. This gave me a real opportunity. As my beautiful and influential mother in law once said, I was solving real problems years ahead of my time. Thinking ahead of time is a real advantage.\n\nAccidentally, this one moment, instantly help me find my true purpose in life. I do not recommend crashing into a tree to find yourself as a strategy to anyone. The movie \"City Slickers\" may be a safer alternative!\n\nAfter my accident in 1990, frustrated with the healthcare system and possibly the Big 4 corporate world, instead of wanting to work for the man on Wall Street, I have been working for the man (person) on the street. It has been a crazy 25 year journey. I am an enigma in my own industry and sometimes to myself. Driven by a patient's need and not profits. Profits do not count, but people do. This may sound unusual coming from a hardcore bean counter!\n\n\"Creating a sustainable and socially responsible healthcare system\"\n\nhas been my personal mantra and vision for the healthcare industry. My early difficulties of the healthcare system focussed me on becoming a patient advocate with the most powerful people in the system as my allies: doctors and patients!\n\nI would not wish my life on my worst enemy. The truth is until our own mortality is challenged only then can we really find out our true purpose in life. For me the tree was my own epiphany.\n\nOne day you will find yours, do not be in a rush. For many it will not happen until they are pushed to the edge (like me). It will not feel like it, but it will be your most liberating moment in your life. When you are at the bottom there is only one way and that is up. You have nothing to lose.\n\nI was initially driven by parental, community and peer expectations. This has overwhelmingly become irrelevant as the years have marched on. Many are no longer around to keep count or care except for myself.\n\nIn the end your memory that you leave for yourself and others is all that matters. Yes the last 25 years in a start up practice have been a hard grind and very risky, but it has never stopped me from getting up in the morning.\n\nI am not sure what greater gift one could receive everyday. All I can say is stay focussed. There is no greater thing you can do in life but to contribute to others and the greater good. Money, accolades and the rest of it is a by product of your results. It is should not be why you do what you do.\n\nIntegrity defines your success, it is not what other people think that matters.\n\nSome may ask, why am I sharing this story with you now? Well the truth is soon to be revealed around the corner. Watch this space. It is important to know where I have been and where I am headed for better or worse. All I can say is I do want to make a positive \"dent\" like many others in life. This is not about fame or money for me. It is about connecting to like minded people like you, one person at a time.\n\nSteve Jobs final words best sums up what really matters. Funnily fame and fortune rank lower than you think. He talks about the worlds most expensive bed being the \"hospital bed\". I humbly agree. Life is about perspective and not appearance. What do you think?\n\nThe last words of Steve Jobs -\n\n\" I have come to the pinnacle of success in business.\n\nIn the eyes of others, my life has been the symbol of success.\n\nHowever, apart from work, I have little joy. Finally, my wealth is simply a fact to which I am accustomed.\n\nAt this time, lying on the hospital bed and remembering all my life, I realize that all the accolades and riches of which I was once so proud, have become insignificant with my imminent death.\n\nIn the dark, when I look at green lights, of the equipment for artificial respiration and feel the buzz of their mechanical sounds, I can feel the breath of my approaching death looming over me.\n\nOnly now do I understand that once you accumulate enough money for the rest of your life, you have to pursue objectives that are not related to wealth.\n\nIt should be something more important:\n\nFor example, stories of love, art, dreams of my childhood.\n\nNo, stop pursuing wealth, it can only make a person into a twisted being, just like me.\n\nGod has made us one way, we can feel the love in the heart of each of us, and not illusions built by fame or money, like I made in my life, I cannot take them with me.\n\nI can only take with me the memories that were strengthened by love.\n\nThis is the true wealth that will follow you; will accompany you, he will give strength and light to go ahead.\n\nLove can travel thousands of miles and so life has no limits. Move to where you want to go. Strive to reach the goals you want to achieve. Everything is in your heart and in your hands.\n\nWhat is the world's most expensive bed? The hospital bed.\n\nYou, if you have money, you can hire someone to drive your car, but you cannot hire someone to take your illness that is killing you.\n\nMaterial things lost can be found. But one thing you can never find when you lose: life.\n\nWhatever stage of life where we are right now, at the end we will have to face the day when the curtain falls.\n\nPlease treasure your family love, love for your spouse, love for your friends...\n\nTreat everyone well and stay friendly with your neighbours.\""
