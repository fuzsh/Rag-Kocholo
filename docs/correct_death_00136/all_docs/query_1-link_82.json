        "text": "This evening, after my office work, I am sitting in my backyard and just googling something about Steve Jobs and found some Inspiring lines.\n\nSteve Jobs has had an interesting life, starting with being adopted but finding a spiritual path through Buddhism. His interest in electronics and computers was his gateway to a successful and innovative future, creating Apple Inc. His legacy will live on as Apple continues to create and invent.\n\nJobs shaped personal computer systems and technology so much that even today, his work is a part of everyday life.\n\nPeople know Steve Jobs for his creativity, innovation, and inspiring quotes too. So there was a lot of hype and curiosity regarding the late Apple co-founder’s last words. In 2015, rumors were circulating online that his last words were in an essay warning how the, “non-stop pursuit of wealth will only turn a person into a twisted being.”\n\nAt the age of 56, Steve Jobs died a billionaire. Close family members say that his dying words were “Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow.” Whether he penned an essay during the days leading up to his death is probably unlikely, but it is still being debated.\n\nThe following is thought to be the essay Jobs wrote in his last days. While its authenticity might be disputed, its profundity cannot be.\n\nThe essay also boasts the importance of treasuring life and family before material things or success. “The wealth I have won in my life I cannot bring with me,” the essay reads. “What I can bring is only the memories precipitated by love.” Although some might argue that these points are important, there is no evidence that Jobs is the author of the essay.\n\n“I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others’ eyes, my life is the epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, my wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on my bed and recalling my life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in have paled and become meaningless in the face of my death.\n\nYou can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you, but you cannot have someone bear your sickness for you. Material things lost can be found or replaced. But there is one thing that can never be found when it’s lost — Life. Whichever stage in life you’re in right now, with time, you will face the day when the curtain falls.\n\nTreasure love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends. Treat yourself well and cherish others.\n\nAs we grow older, and hence wiser, we slowly realize that —\n\nwearing a $300 or $30 watch — they both tell the same time…\n\nWhether we carry a $300 or $30 wallet/handbag — the amount of money inside is the same;\n\nWhether we drive a $150,000 car or a $30,000 car, the road and distance is the same, and we get to the same destination.\n\nWhether we drink a bottle of $300 or $10 wine — the hangover is the same;\n\nWhether the house we live in is 300 or 3000 sq ft — loneliness is the same.\n\nYou will realize that your true inner happiness does not come from the material things of this world. Whether you fly first class or economy, if the plane goes down — you go down with it.\n\nTherefore, I hope you realize, when you have mates, buddies and old friends, brothers and sisters, who you chat with, laugh with, talk with, sing with, talk about north-south-east-west or heaven and earth, that is true happiness.\n\nFive Undeniable Facts of Life :\n\n1. Don’t educate your children to be rich. Educate them to be Happy. So when they grow up they will know the value of things not the price.\n\n2. Best awarded words in London … “Eat your food as your medicines. Otherwise you have to eat medicines as your food.”\n\n3. The One who loves you will never leave you for another because even if there are 100 reasons to give up he or she will find one reason to hold on.\n\n4. There is a big difference between a human being and being human.\n\nOnly a few really understand it.\n\n5. You are loved when you are born. You will be loved when you die. In between, You have to manage!\n\nNOTE: If you just want to Walk Fast, Walk Alone! But if you want to Walk Far, Walk Together!\n\nThe One who loves you will never leave you for another because, even if there are 100 reasons to give up, he or she will find a reason to hold on. There is a big difference between a human being and being human. Only a few really understand it. You are loved when you are born. You will be loved when you die. In between, you have to manage.\n\nThe six best doctors in the world are sunlight, rest, exercise, diet, self-confidence, and friends. Maintain them in all stages and enjoy a healthy life.\n\nPlease feel free to share your story and any lessons you learned, experienced, you came across in your life in the comments below.
