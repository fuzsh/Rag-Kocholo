        "text": "As Apple announced a private employee celebration of Steve Jobs‘ life, California health officials disclosed what killed the tech legend.\n\n“The immediate cause of death is respiratory arrest, and that’s brought on by a pancreatic tumor,” said Amy Cornell, a health information officer for Santa Clara County Public Health Department, citing Jobs’ death certificate.\n\nJobs, 56, died at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., at 3 p.m. on Oct. 5 after suffering from a metastatic pancreas neuroendocrine tumor, Cornell said. His occupation is listed on the death certificate as “entrepreneur” in the high-tech business, with 36 years in the occupation.\n\nHe is buried at Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto, Cornell said, after a funeral held on Oct. 7.\n\nThe death certificate came out the same day Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that a “celebration” of Jobs’ life would take place at 10 a.m., Wednesday, Oct. 19 on the Apple corporate campus in Cupertino, Calif.\n\nIt will be a private celebration for employees with no media present, according to Apple.\n\n“Like many of you, I have experienced the saddest days of my lifetime and shed many tears during the past week,” Cook wrote in a letter to employees. “But I’ve found some comfort in the extraordinary number of tributes and condolences from people all over the world who were touched by Steve and his genius. And I’ve found comfort in both telling and listening to stories about Steve.\n\n“Although many of our hearts are still heavy, we are planning a celebration of his life for Apple employees to take time to remember the incredible things Steve achieved in his life and the many ways he made our world a better place,” Cook added.\n\nABC News’ Neal Karlinsky contributed to this report."
