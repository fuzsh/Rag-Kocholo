        "text": "Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, U.S. He was adopted and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He had a younger sister, Patricia.\n\nAs a child, Steve liked reading, swimming, music, and practical jokes. He also spent a lot of time building electronics. As a young teenager, he got a summer job at an electronics company. In high school, he joined an electronics club whose members were called “wireheads.”\n\nIn 1972 Jobs went to college for less than a year. In 1974 he worked at Atari, a video-game company. Later that year he began working with an old friend named Stephen Wozniak.\n\nJobs and Wozniak built a computer in Jobs’s garage. They called it the Apple I. In 1977 the friends released the Apple II. Sales were so high that their company, also called Apple, soon became one of the top companies in the United States.\n\nIn 1984 Apple introduced the Macintosh, or Mac. It featured a mouse and a picture-based screen. The Mac did not sell as well as personal computers that used Microsoft software (see Bill Gates). The directors of Apple fired Jobs in 1985.\n\nJobs formed a new computer company called NeXT. He also bought Pixar, which made computer-animated movies. Pixar’s success made Jobs a billionaire.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Apple was failing. In 1997 Jobs was asked to lead the company once again. His popular new products—including colorful iMac computers and laptops—saved Apple.\n\nIn 2001 Jobs introduced the iPod. It quickly became the top-selling portable music player. The iPhone was released in 2007. It could be used to make phone calls, access the Internet, play music, and more. In 2010 Apple began selling the iPad, a tablet computer.\n\nAs Apple’s success climbed, Jobs began to have health problems. He learned that he had cancer in 2003. Nevertheless, he remained in charge of the company until 2011. Jobs died on October 5, 2011, in Palo Alto, California. Nearly 11 years after his death, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The medal is the highest nonmilitary award in the United States."
