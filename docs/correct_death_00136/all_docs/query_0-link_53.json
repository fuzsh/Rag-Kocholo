        "text": "Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was a co-founder and former CEO of Apple Inc. Jobs and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates were known for their tumultuous rivalry and friendship within the technology industry.[1][2] Jobs resigned as CEO of Apple due to health reasons and remained on as chairman until his death due to pancreatic cancer in October 2011.[3]\n\nHistory with Microsoft[]\n\nIn 1983, Steve Jobs invited Bill Gates to preview the pre-release development of the Macintosh. In 1984, Microsoft began development on Microsoft Word 1.0 for Macintosh, which was released in the following year.[4][5] After Jobs was forced out of the company and Microsoft had released Windows 2.0 with a GUI that was similar to the Mac, Apple Computer, then under CEO John Sculley, filed a federal lawsuit in 1988 against Microsoft.[4][6]\n\nJobs returned to a financially-troubled Apple Computer in 1997. He negotiated an end to the lawsuits with Microsoft and an agreement to cross-license technology between the two companies in exchange for Microsoft's commitment to continue developing software such as Microsoft Office for the Mac along with an investment of $150 million in Apple non-voting shares (just under 5% of the company). Apple also agreed to include the Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser by default with future Mac OS releases for the next 5 years. Though the joint announcement by Jobs and Gates was met with shock at Macworld Expo Boston in August 1997, the investment from Microsoft helped save Apple from bankruptcy.[4][7]\n\nDramatization[]\n\nJobs's and Gates's rivalry was dramatized in the 1999 television film Pirates of Silicon Valley, starring Noah Wyle and Anthony Michael Hall, respectively.[8]\n\nVideos[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nSteve Jobs at the Microsoft Store\n\nSteve Jobs at Wikipedia"
