        "text": "Those of us who create new products and services, build capability in others, and strive to delight customers are always looking for the \"secret sauce\" that drives innovation and creativity. How many of you have studied Pixar Animation Studios' Braintrust? It's a meeting brought together by Pixar leaders and producers to review progress on productions and for everyone to provide feedback. The meeting's ethos is built on forthright and frankness -- radical candor -- with the belief that this will foster creativity. The Braintrust is a group of trusted colleagues that collectively provides constructive feedback to push towards excellence and root out mediocrity. As the Pixar Braintrust accepts, all Pixar movie ideas start out with a high level of suck (as do most early stage ideas). The Braintrust is build on trust and on identifying and solving problems to raise the quality bar -- it involves creative thinking, problem-solving, and analysis. And all voices have equal weight -- there's no hierarchy in the room -- just expertise and empathy. Have you thought about creating your own \"Braintrust\" within your organization or function to advance the principles of radical candor in service to your product/service ideas?\n\nThe Power of Brand. I was roughly 16 when I convinced my dad that our small business desperately needed an Apple computer. This was around 1980-81. He wanted to know… what would it do for his photography business. In reality, I had no clue — I just wanted one. I was coming from a TRS-80, and when I saw Apple’s rainbow logo, it just screamed “friendly” and “easy to use.” I convinced him that it would help us keep track of his appointments. I drove 25 miles to the closest computer store which sold Apple and we applied for an Apple credit account — because the IIC was close to $2500. And in 1980, that was not a small investment! And along with it, we needed some 5.25” disks! Those weren’t cheap either. And a dot matrix printer. That was my first Apple product. And the power of the brand changed my life. It gave me a profession. I made a living doing desktop publishing. Then I designed books with a Mac Quadra. I started two businesses. I wrote two books. All on Apple products. Just last week, I discovered old emails from my grandmother who passed long ago. She sent those to my .me Apple email account. I even worked at Apple for a few years. I designed my wedding invites on my Mac. At Apple, we weren’t allowed to produce logos for different internal business functions. The Apple logo was the only one you could use. I used to create sales training for iPhone and iPad and all my training material would be reviewed by Marketing to ensure all our content was on brand. Steve cared deeply about the quality of the brand and reverence. For the majority of my life this iconic brand has played a critical role. The most impactful part has been bringing its design ethos to my craft. Steve told us that the quality we put into the parts the customer would never see deeply mattered. Which is one reason you’ll always see the “Designed in California” statement on Apple product packaging. Channeling Dieter Rams, Apple always stood for “Good design is as little design as possible.” Not many brands have this level of impact on our lives? What are your life-changing brands?"
