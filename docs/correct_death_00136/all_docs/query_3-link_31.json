        "text": "Steve Jobs, who sparked a revolution in the technology industry and then presided over it as Silicon Valley’s radiant Sun King, died Wednesday.\n\nThe incandescent center of a tech universe around which all the other planets revolved, Jobs had a genius for stylish design and a boyish sense of what was “cool.” He was 56 when he died, ahead of his time to the very end.\n\nAccording to a spokesman for Apple — the company Jobs co-founded when he was just 21 and turned into one of the world’s great industrial design houses — he suffered from a recurrence of the pancreatic cancer for which he had undergone surgery in 2004.\n\nJobs had taken his third leave of absence from the company in January and made the final capitulation to his failing health on Aug. 24, when he resigned as Apple’s chief executive. After 35 years as the soul of Silicon Valley’s new machine, that may have been a fate worse than death.\n\nJobs died only a few miles from the family garage in Los Altos where he and fellow college dropout Steve Wozniak assembled the first Apple computer in 1976. Jobs transformed the computer from an intimidating piece of business machinery to a device people considered “personal,” and then indispensable.\n\nJobs was the undisputed “i” behind the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad, and there was very little about his personality that was lower-case. According to Fortune magazine, he was considered “one of Silicon Valley’s leading egomaniacs,” but Jobs also cultivated a loyal coterie of ergomaniacs — ergonomic designers who created the sleek stable of iHits — whose devotion to him was the centrifugal force holding Apple together. Shares of the company’s stock plunged 22 points after Jobs announced his final medical leave Jan. 17.\n\n“A hundred years from now, when people talk about Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, Gates is going to be remembered for his philanthropy, not technology,” said tech forecaster Paul Saffo, “the same way people remember Andrew Carnegie for the money he gave to education, not the fortune he made in steel. But what they’re going to say about Steve Jobs is that he led a revolution.”\n\nIt was a war waged on three fronts — computers, music and movies — and with each successive Apple triumph, Jobs altered the landscape of popular culture. With its user-friendly interface and anthropomorphic mouse, the Macintosh forever changed the relationship between humans and computers. After acquiring Pixar Animation Studios in 1986, Jobs became the most successful movie mogul of the past half-century, turning out 11 monster hits in succession. The 2001 smash “Monsters, Inc.” could just as easily have been the name of the company.\n\nBut it was with the iPod — originally released just six weeks after the cataclysmic events of Sept. 11, 2001 — that Jobs engineered another tectonic shift in the digital world. The transistor radio had untethered music from the home, and Sony’s Walkman had made recorded music portable. With one of the world’s premier consumer electronics businesses, and a music label of its own, Sony was poised to dominate digital distribution for decades.\n\nBut it didn’t happen. Jobs took a digital compression format that had been around for a decade, synced it to Apple’s new digital download service, iTunes, and with the iPod changed a system for delivering music to consumers that had been in place since Edison invented the phonograph.\n\nIt was Jobs’ genius for simplicity that led to a pricing standard of 99 cents per song that remained unchanged for eight years, despite initial resistance from the music studios. And it was his irresistability as a pitchman that brought the record labels so completely into line that iTunes now is the dominant player in the digital music business.\n\nWhether by accident or design, Jobs created such an intense aura of mystery about what he was on to — and up to — that he developed a cult of personality, sometimes called “Macolytes.” His appearances at the annual MacWorld Expo were often an occasion for the rollout of some new product that Jobs had managed, until that very moment, to keep top secret. To his loyal fans, it seemed to matter little that Apple’s new device inevitably cost far more than its competitors’.\n\nAnd while his personal fortune was dwarfed by peers such as Larry Ellison of Oracle and Bill Gates of Microsoft, Jobs’ matchless record of innovation over three decades made him the coolest computer nerd in the valley.\n\nJobs insisted the products Apple brought to market not merely be great, they must be “insanely great.” It was his focus on design that allowed Apple to maintain a hold on the imagination of the public that often was disproportionate to the company’s market share.\n\nApples product lines were a projection of his sense of style, transforming the boring, putty-colored boxes of computers sold by such competitors as Dell and IBM into fruit and berry-flavored iMacs. Yet Jobs himself rarely deviated from a single, Mao-like uniform of blue jeans, black turtleneck and sneakers, turning that into a kind of meta-fashion statement: Think different. Dress the same.\n\nHis first brush with pancreatic cancer did nothing to slow Jobs down during his final years. If anything, he seemed more driven than ever.\n\nSpeaking to the Stanford graduating class of 2005, a year after surgery to treat his illness, Jobs said: “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.”\n\nAs a young man, Jobs merely helped lead the world into the computer age. In his final years, he turned Apple into a kind of beloved nation-state: a company whose reputation for innovation gives it a reach far exceeding any worth calculable on a balance sheet.\n\n“Steve Jobs has a way of making people believe,” 3Com’s Metcalfe told the Mercury News in 1997. “It’s called the reality distortion field. Whenever you get near him, no matter how mean he might be, there’s this field that distorts reality. You are made to feel that if you disagree, you are a jerk.”\n\nThe iPhone was an example of the kind of upside-down world Jobs could create with his distortion field. Long lines formed outside Apple stores before the first iPhones went on sale in 2007, and the device received endless — mostly rhapsodic — coverage in the press. Yet even after the fourth-generation iPhone was released in 2010, Apple’s share of the U.S. cellphone business stood at 22 percent, behind Android and RIM’s BlackBerry.\n\nEven Apple stores, which were originally created to provide showplaces for the company’s product line, turned into tech temples and became so popular they generated the most profit per square foot of any retail outlet in the country.\n\nThough computers remain Apple’s most profitable product line, Jobs sought to lead the company away from what had become, increasingly, a commodity business. He made the transition from computer niche player to consumer electronics giant official in 2007, dropping the word “Computer” from what is now simply Apple Inc.\n\nFor a decade, Jobs was the only CEO of two major U.S. corporations, running Apple (as the iPods got smaller and smaller), and Pixar (as the box-office hits got bigger and bigger). Jobs sold Pixar to Disney in 2006 for $7.4 billion in stock. That transaction made him the largest single shareholder in the world’s dominant media conglomerate.\n\nAt his death, Steve Jobs sat at the summit of an information and entertainment empire, through which he controlled a large part of the culture’s digital means of production — and with the iPhone and iPad, its reproduction.\n\nJobs did that through the force of his personality, which was sometimes maddeningly abrasive, and the perfection of his vision, which often seemed limitless. But now, suddenly, the bright star at the center of Silicon Valley’s universe has gone out.\n\nWhat they are saying\n\nTweets about any other topic were sparse after Apple announced Wednesday evening that co-founder and chairman Steve Jobs had died. Here’s a sampling from Denver-area Twitter accounts:\n\nCan anyone tell me why I’m such a wreck over the death of a man I never met? RIP Steve Jobs. @doylealbee\n\nMy entire twitter stream including me, is crying. #SteveJobs @dhgatsby\n\nThe world lost a true innovator today. Thoughts with the Jobs and Apple families as they mourn the loss of their brilliant leader. @laurenpreston\n\n:(. Changed my life. Thx Steve. @benr75\n\nKids came home and wondered why I was crying. “A very, imaginative, creative and profound man, died today, Mommy is sad.” @ashleykingsley\n\nThe heavens will be a bit brighter tonight as Steve Jobs star will be shining brightly. God bless his soul. @calbeach95"
