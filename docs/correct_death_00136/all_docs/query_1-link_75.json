        "text": "At the age of 56, Steve Jobs died a billionaire. Close family members say that his dying words were “Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, wow.” Whether he penned the beautiful and poignant essay found below during the days leading up to his death is probably unlikely, but it is still being debated. What we do know is that Jobs often sacrificed his family to achieve success in business. Are you living this as well?\n\nAt one point he went so far as to deny that he was the legitimate father of his daughter, Lisa. Jobs wasn't alone. All of us, especially during this pandemic, struggle with finding the right work-life balance, integration, and harmony. So, what's the answer? Well, that answer isn't and easy one, and it's also different for all of us. However, my hope is that the words below help you uncover the answer that is right for you, right now. Because, where our focus goes, our energy flows.\n\nSteve Jobs’ Advice & Dying Words\n\nThe following is thought to be the essay Jobs wrote in his last days. While its authenticity might be disputed, its profundity cannot be.\n\nI reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others’ eyes, my life is the epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, my wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on my bed and recalling my life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in have paled and become meaningless in the face of my death.\n\nYou can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you, but you cannot have someone bear your sickness for you. Material things lost can be found or replaced. But there is one thing that can never be found when lost—Life. Whichever stage in life you’re in right now, with time, you will face the day when the curtain falls.\n\nTreasure love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends. Treat yourself well and cherish others. As we grow older, and hopefully wiser, we realize that a $3000 or a $30 watch both tell the same time. You will realize that your true inner happiness does not come from the material things of this world. Whether you fly first class or economy, if the plane goes down—you go down with it.\n\nTherefore, I hope you realize, when you have mates, buddies and old friends, brothers and sisters, who you chat with, laugh with, talk with, sing with, talk about north-south-east-west or heaven and earth, that is true happiness. Don’t educate your children to be rich. Educate them to be happy. So when they grow up they will know the value of things and not the price.\n\nEat your food as your medicine, otherwise, you have to eat medicine as your food.\n\nThe One who loves you will never leave you for another because, even if there are 100 reasons to give up, he or she will find a reason to hold on. There is a big difference between a human being and being human. Only a few really understand it. You are loved when you are born. You will be loved when you die. In between, you have to manage.\n\nThe six best doctors in the world are sunlight, rest, exercise, diet, self-confidence, and friends. Maintain them in all stages and enjoy a healthy life.”\n\nResources\n\nIf this post helped you, please feel free to share with a friend and gift them The Focus Project.\n\nNow available on Amazon."
