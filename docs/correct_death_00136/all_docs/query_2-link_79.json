        "text": "Paul Jobs was born and raised in Wisconsin, and served in the Coast Guard during World War II. After the war, he settled in San Francisco, and married Clara Hagopian in 1946. The couple adopted baby Steve nine years later. Paul, who never graduated from high school, became a car machinist - he fixed broken cars and sold them for a profit. He taught his son Steve the importance of craftsmanship, and how to get parts for a low price from dealers. That would prove useful in Apple's early years. Steve had the greatest respect for his father and was devastated when he died."
