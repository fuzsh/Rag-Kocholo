        "text": "Ask any person knowledgeable about Apple's history, and they'll tell you that co-founder Steve Jobs died in 2011 at the age of 56, after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. Ask conspiracy theorists though, and they might tell you he's alive and well.\n\nA photo posted on Reddit yesterday has gained traction on the site and on social media. It purportedly shows the tech icon chilling at a roadside shop in Cairo.\n\nReddit\n\nClearly it's not Jobs, he certainly did pass away in 2011. But the man in the photo has a strikingly similar likeness, at least from this side angle.\n\nThere are other details too, like the fact the man is barefoot. It was fairly well-known that Jobs would walk around barefoot while brainstorming new ideas. His hair looks to be the same, as does his jawline, his build, and even his glasses.\n\n\"I know this is supposed to be a joke, but WTF, this guy looks too much like Steve Jobs to be so random,\" one redditor wrote. Another figured the doppelganger is probably aware of how much he looks like Jobs and is milking it. \"He's also obviously aware of it, as he has the same haircut and glasses. I doubt that's a coincidence,\" they said. \"Even something about the way he sits,\" another added, while another compared the hand gesture in the photo to something Jobs used to do.\n\nSteve Jobs hiding in Egypt after faking his death from r/pics\n\n\"I'm not very into conspiracy theories, but Jobs would be crazy enough to actually do it,\" one redditor said.\n\nIt's actually not the first time the \"Steve Jobs is alive\" theory has been floated. A photo on Reddit five years ago claimed the tech guru was hiding out in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIt's only natural people are seeing the likeness of Steve Jobs long after his death. Aside from being charismatic, he was a well-known icon in the tech industry. So it was heartbreaking for Apple fans when, after a liver transplant in 2007, his cancer continued to spread.\n\nFlickr\n\nIn a saddening resignation letter penned three months before his death, Jobs resigned saying he wasn't physically up to continuing his work. \"I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know,\" he wrote at the time.\n\n\"Unfortunately, that day has come. I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it.\""
