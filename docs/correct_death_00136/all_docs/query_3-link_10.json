        "text": "Steve Jobs, the co-founder and innovator behind Apple, died at 56 years old on Wednesday.\n\nThe mastermind behind Apple’s iPhone, iPod, iPad, iMac and iTunes, had a long struggle with failing health after fighting an unusual form of pancreatic cancer, and in 2009 getting a liver transplant.\n\nPHOTOS: 10 Memorable Milestones of Steve Jobs’ Career\n\nAfter his death, Apple, Disney, and Pixar execs expressed their sadness at the loss of a visionary. President Obama also released a statement. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and other titans of technology all released kind words about the visionary.\n\nThe Apple website was changed to a black and white photo and statement about Jobs, and Apple’s new CEO, Tim Cook, released a statement to employees.\n\nSTORY: Apple CEO Tim Cook on Steve Jobs: ‘No Words Can Adequately Express Our Sadness’\n\nNow, memorials are popping up all over the country and world. People showed up to Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., to remember him, and at the Apple campus – a miniature city of Apple offices – the flags were at half mast and a memorial was set up for people to drop by flowers and other symbols of their memory for Jobs.\n\nVIDEOS: Remembering Steve Jobs\n\nEven Apple stores all over the country had their own small memorials for Jobs. In New York, “I Love Steve” was written on an Apple store’s window, while in Santa Monica, CA, a drawing of an apple and the note “Thank You Steve” were scribbled."
