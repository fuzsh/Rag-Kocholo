        "text": "Apple co-founder and chairman Steve Jobs, counted among the greatest American CEOs of his generation, has died at the age of 56 after a long and highly public battle with cancer and other health issues. Here we look back at the highs and lows of the tech pioneer's career.\n\n1973: Jobs drops out of the very fancy and expensive Reed college in Oregon and started dropping in on other classes he isn't enrolled in - finally getting a job working at Atari, arguably the world's first video game company.\n\nAfter a stint travelling through India in search of enlightenment, Jobs returns to find his best friend, Woz (Steve Wozniak), had been designing a powerful computer. Jobs's idea to start a company - Apple Computer - is born.\n\n\"Typically, it was really hard for me to explain to people the kind of design stuff I worked on, but Steve got it right away. And I liked him. He was kind of skinny and wiry and full of energy.\"\n\n1976: Jobs and Woz sell their Apple I computer on their own, as there is not much interest from bigger companies. They incorporate Apple Computer on April 1. The prototype for the Apple II computer is completed later in the year - dubbed the \"bicycle for the mind\".\n\n1977: The Apple II with a one-megahertz processor becomes the first mass-produced computer and an instant hit.\n\n1978: Computer scientist Jef Raskin starts working on the Macintosh - named after his favourite apple. Production begins on the Apple III.\n\n1979: Jobs becomes a millionaire, with Apple earning $47 million in revenues.\n\n1980: Jobs becomes a national icon in the United States, and in December, Apple goes public. Jobs is now worth $217.5 million.\n\n1981: The infamous 'Black Wednesday' occurs on February 25 - the day then-Apple CEO Mike Scott fires half the Apple II team without consultation. Scott is then fired by the company.\n\n1982: Jobs makes Time Magazine's cover - before Microsoft CEO Bill Gates.\n\n1983: Lisa, the first personal computer featuring a mouse for navigating and desktop icons and folders, is introduced. Its failure is blamed on a daunting price of nearly $10,000.\n\n1984: Jobs introduces the Macintosh (Mac) computer as a revolution, but sales are poor. Its price tag and slow processing power means it isn't a huge hit.\n\n1985: After being removed from any managerial position on Apple, but not fired from the company, Jobs resigns in September. He sets up NeXT and goes on to introduce the company's first computer in 1988.\n\n1986: John Sculley becomes Apple president. Jobs starts computer company NeXT and buys Lucasfilm's computer graphics division, renaming it Pixar.\n\n1989: Disney signs a contract with Pixar - Jobs's \"hobby\" and investment - for a full feature film to be made entirely with computers.\n\n1995: Toy Story is released and proves a huge success for Pixar and Disney - putting Jobs back on the map after earlier failings with NeXT.\n\n1996: Apple buys NeXT and subsequently brings Jobs back to the company he originally founded. Starting out as defacto chief, he eventually becomes interim chief in 1997.\n\n1998: Jobs unveils the iMac (internet Mac) in May, a new consumer desktop computer. It offers USB connectivity and ditches the floppy disk drive. It becomes one of Apple's biggest hits.\n\n1999: Jobs unveils the iBook in New York, as well as Apple's first Wi-Fi product.\n\n2000: Finally, Jobs becomes Apple's full-time CEO.\n\n2001: The idea to create a tiny digital music player - the iPod - is born after iTunes is created, surpassing the demand for all other MP3 players at the time.\n\n2003: The iTunes music store exceeds Apple's expectations and is dubbed the start of a revolution. This is also the year in which Jobs learns he has a tumour in his pancreas.\n\n\"My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.\"\n\n2004: Jobs undergoes an operation for pancreatic cancer.\n\n2007: The iPhone is born after four years in the works, becoming an international sensation.\n\n2009: After undergoing a liver transplant in April, Jobs takes a medical leave of absence.\n\n2010: In January, Jobs reveals the iPad, Apple's much-anticipated tablet. Initially, the critics do not take to the new product but it is sold in huge numbers, defying expectations.\n\n2011: On August 24, Jobs announces he is stepping down as CEO of Apple and instead staying on in the company as chairman. In a letter to Apple employees, Jobs outlined his reasons for standing down:\n\nI have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.\n\nI believe Apple’s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role.\n\nI have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you."
