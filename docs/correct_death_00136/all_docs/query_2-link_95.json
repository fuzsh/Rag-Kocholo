        "text": "Steve Jobs died as a billionaire, with a capital of 7 billion dollars, at the age of 56 from pancreatic cancer, and here are some of his last words... \"At this moment, lying in bed, ill and remembering my whole life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth I have are insignificant in the presence of imminent death.\" You can hire someone to drive you a car, make money for you - but you can't hire someone to carry the disease for you. As we get older we get smarter, and we slowly understand that when a clock is worth $30 or $300 – they both show the exact same time. Whether we drive a $150,000 car, or a $2000 car - the road and distance are the same, we arrive at the same destination. If we drink a $300 or $10 bottle of wine, we be just as drunk. Five facts that can not be denied: 1. Don't educate your children to be rich. Educate them to be happy. - So when they grow up they will know the value of things and not their price. 2. Eat your food as a medicine, otherwise you will have to eat your medicine as food. 3. The one who loves you will never leave you, even if he has 100 reasons to give up. He will always find one reason to hold on. 4. There is a big difference between being a human and being. 5. If you want to go fast - go alone! But if you want to go far - go together. Interesting life story from a very conflicted man. Glad he eventually found some peace . In the interest of full disclosure, there is some debate whether or not Jobs actually said this. But for me, what’s most important is the message, not the messenger. Do you recall the famous quote, “ You Miss 100% of the Shots You Never Take?” Attributed to both Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. Perhaps neither of them said this but the message isn’t lost and has been repeated millions of times, as has this one. If you read the book of his life story, that Jobs commissioned Walter Isaacson to write, I can imagine Jobs saying this. He was a deeply flawed and conflicted man. When my own son died in 2019, I sought words of inspiration and wisdom to comfort me. Words I could share with others. This is one of those moments. Whether he said it, wrote it or just reflected on it, it’s a statement that makes you stop and think what’s really important. I choose to believe. It moved me!"
