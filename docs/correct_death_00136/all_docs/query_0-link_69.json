        "text": "\"Steve lived with his wife, Laurene, and their three kids in a low-key Tudor-style house on a prosperous street in Palo Alto, California,\" Bono wrote. \"Their Anglophilia also inspired a cottage garden full of wildflowers and stuff you could eat, with a gate opening yards from a front door he never locked.\"\n\nWalter Isaacson, Jobs' autobiographer, similarly noted that he usually kept the back door unlocked and didn't have a security fence. Jobs also didn't have any security guards, live-in help, or drivers, according to Isaacson.\n\nGuests dined on vegetables from the garden\n\nJobs bought the 5,768-square-foot, seven-bedroom house in the early 1990s. He lived in the property until his death from pancreatic cancer in 2011.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe property had been built in the 1930s and was made from brick and slate. A former neighbor called it a \"lovely and soul-soothing cottage\" in a piece for The Atlantic, while The Los Angeles Times reported that it \"looks as if it were plucked from an English village in the Cotswolds.\"\n\nIn a 1997 article for Time Magazine, Cathy Booth described the property as an \"English-style country house.\"\n\n\"The house is run with a distinct 1960s flavor,\" she continued. \"Laurene has planted a garden of wildflowers, herbs and vegetables all around.\"\n\nBooth wrote that when she dined with Steve and Laurene, who were both \"strict vegans,\" they ate corn from the garden and had tea made from herbs grown at the property.\n\nA former neighbor told Bloomberg that Jobs obsessed over the furniture, including spending tens of thousands of dollars on chairs and a custom-made dining table that he ended up returning.\n\n\"The rooms are sparsely decorated, the only extravagances being Ansel Adams photographs,\" Booth added,"
