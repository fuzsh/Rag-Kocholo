        "text": "The birthplace of the Apple computer is officially a part of history.\n\nA Bay Area historical commission on Monday unanimously voted to turn Steve Jobs' childhood home into a historical site.\n\nPHOTOS: Remembering Steve Jobs\n\nThe decision by the Los Altos Historical Commission gives protected status to the single-story, ranch-style house where Jobs and his foster parents moved in 1968.\n\nNow that the house is protected, it cannot be demolished.\n\nCommission members said the home is of historical significance, especially the garage, where Jobs and Steve Wozniak built the first 100 Apple 1 computers at the home in 1976, according to the city's evaluation.\n\nThe first partnership for what was called \"Apple Computer Co.\" was established at the Crist Drive home before the company relocated to Cupertino.\n\nMORE: Steve Jobs' Childhood Home Eyed for Preservation\n\nThe home is currently owned by Patricia Jobs, Steve Jobs' sister. Jobs' stepmother, Marilyn Jobs, still lives in the house.\n\nTourists stop by on a weekly basis to take pictures, and the goal of the historical designation is to preserve the home as it looked in the 1970s.\n\nThe commission plans to put up a plaque in front of the home.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
