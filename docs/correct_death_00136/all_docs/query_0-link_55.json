        "text": "SCENE 1\n\n2007: The stage of a convention center, San Francisco\n\nAn adult Steve Jobs delivers a public launch of his company’s new product—“one device”—that will revolutionize technology. He ends his pitch noticeably weak and short of breath.\n\nSCENE 2\n\n2007, directly after: Corporate offices, Cupertino\n\nSteve retreats to his office. His wife Laurene chides him for not taking better care of himself and losing himself in his work. She asks him to return home.\n\nSCENE 3\n\n2007, later that afternoon: The hills around Cupertino\n\nSteve goes on a long meditative walk. He encounters Kōbun Chino Otogawa, Steve’s former spiritual mentor in Sōtō Zen Buddhism, who died five years before. Steve remembers something he once said: “You can’t connect the dots going forward. You can only connect them going backward.” As they gaze at the sunset, Kōbun prompts Steve to acknowledge his mortality.\n\nSCENE 4\n\n1973: A class in calligraphy, Reed College, Oregon\n\nA teacher discusses the significance of the ensō, a circle drawn in Japanese calligraphy. Steve is inspired by the aesthetic ideas of elegance and simplicity.\n\nSCENE 5\n\n1973: The garage of the Jobs family home, Los Altos\n\nSteve’s best friend Steve Wozniak has created a “blue box,” a device that allows the user to make free telephone calls. Steve and “Woz” celebrate the ease with which they think corporate giants can be toppled.\n\nSCENE 6\n\n1974: An apple orchard near Los Altos\n\nSteve and his girlfriend Chrisann take LSD. Steve imagines their surroundings coming to life as an orchestra, playing Bach. The two start to make love when Kōbun interrupts them.\n\nSCENE 7\n\n2007: The hills around Cupertino\n\n1975: Los Altos Zen Center\n\nKōbun informs Steve that he cannot live at the Zen Center and hints that his destiny may lie elsewhere.\n\nSCENE 8\n\n1989: A lecture Hall, Stanford University\n\nSteve meets Laurene for the first time.\n\nSCENE 9\n\n1976: The garage of the Jobs family home, Los Altos\n\nWoz presents a new computer interface to Steve. Chrisann arrives and tells Steve that she is pregnant. When Steve demands that Chrisann end the pregnancy, she leaves in tears. Steve and Woz dream about the future of their invention, Steve remembering the orchestra in the orchard playing Bach and imagining the computer as “something we play.”\n\nSCENE 10\n\n1989: Steve Jobs’ home, Palo Alto\n\nSteve shows Laurene his sparsely furnished home. Photographs by Ansel Adams in Steve’s home prompt a brief discussion about artistic inspiration. Laurene and Steve go to the bedroom to make love for the first time.\n\nSCENE 11\n\n1980: Corporate Offices, Cupertino\n\nSteve severs ties with Chrisann and angers Woz by denying a fellow employee his pension. Chrisann and Woz lament the loss of the Steve they once knew.\n\nSCENE 12\n\n1981-1986: Corporate Offices, Cupertino\n\nSteve denies palimony to Chrisann for their child, Lisa, and offends Woz, who quits. Demoted by the board of directors, Steve bitterly leaves the company and has a breakdown.\n\nSCENE 13\n\n2007: The hills around Cupertino\n\nKōbun reminds Steve that it was necessary for him to learn from his mistakes. He shows Steve a brief replay of his life after he fell apart, revisiting his first meeting with Laurene and the evening when he fell in love with her.\n\nSCENE 14\n\n2007: The hills around Cupertino 1989: A lecture hall, Stanford University\n\nThe day when Steve and Laurene met.\n\nSCENE 15\n\n2007: The hills around Cupertino 1989: Steve Jobs’ home, Palo Alto\n\nThe evening in Steve’s home when he fell in love with Laurene. Kōbun reminds Steve that Laurene also helped keep his ego in check.\n\nSCENE 16\n\n2007: Steve Jobs’ home\n\nSteve returns home after his walk to find Laurene waiting for him. She confronts Steve and gets him to accept his illness and mortality.\n\nSCENE 17\n\n1991: Yosemite National Park\n\nKōbun marries Steve and Laurene in a Buddhist ceremony. Steve expresses his love for Laurene and his gratitude to her for teaching him the value of human connection. Kōbun’s 1992 death is revealed, prompting a meditation on mortality that segues into the next scene.\n\nSCENE 18\n\n2011: Stanford University Chapel\n\nKōbun explains that Steve is witnessing his own memorial service. Steve protests a few production elements of the service, but Kōbun tells him to be still, to simplify. Laurene and Woz muse about Steve. Finally, Laurene is left alone and observes that while Steve will be both lionized and demonized, no one can deny his influence on the world."
