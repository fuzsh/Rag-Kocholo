        "text": "Steven Paul \"Steve\" Jobs was an American businessman and technology visionary, who was best known as the co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of Apple Inc. He also co-founded and served as chief executive of Pixar Animation Studios after acquiring it from Lucasfilm's computer graphics division for the price of $10 million in 1986. He was also credited as executive producer of the 1995 Disney/Pixar film Toy Story. In 2006, Pixar was acquired by The Walt Disney Company in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4 billion. Jobs, owning 50.1% of Pixar stock, thereby became the Walt Disney Company's largest individual shareholder, owning 7% of the company, and was appointed to the Walt Disney Company Board of Directors, a position he held until his death. Following Jobs' death from pancreatic cancer on October 5, 2011, his shares were transferred to the Steven P. Jobs Trust, controlled by his widow, Laurene Powell Jobs. Steve Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 and passed away eight years later in 2011. He was mentioned in the Andi Mack episode \"Home Away from Home\".\n\nHe was posthumously named a Disney Legend in 2013. John Lasseter accepted the award on his behalf.\n\nTributes[]\n\nFollowing Jobs' death, flags at all Disney properties, including the Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World, were ordered by Disney CEO Bob Iger to be flown at half-staff from October 6 to October 12, 2011.\n\nFollowing Jobs' death, the Pixar website's homepage was changed to a photo of Jobs, Ed Catmull, and John Lasseter, followed by an eulogy written by Catmull and Lasseter.\n\nThe 2012 Disney/Pixar film Brave was dedicated to him. The characters Lord Macintosh and his son Young Macintosh were named after the line of personal computers that were designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc., named Macintosh, later officially branded as just \"Mac,\" which was introduced by Jobs himself.\n\nThe character of Mark Beaks in the 2017 DuckTales reboot is inspired by Steve Jobs.\n\nJohn Lasseter dedicated his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame to him.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nSteve Jobs was mentioned on the promotional site for Tomorrowland, where he was described working with Plus Ultra, and received a pin from David Nix.\n\n[]\n\nSteve Jobs on Wikipedia"
