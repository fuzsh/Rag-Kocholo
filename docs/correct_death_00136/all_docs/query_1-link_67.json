        "text": "Pixar has turned its homepage into a tribute to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died Wednesday at age 56.\n\nMuch like Apple did on its website, Pixar has devoted its entire homepage to Jobs, former CEO of Pixar and Disney board member.\n\nPHOTOS: 10 Memorable Milestones of Steve Jobs’ Career\n\nThe homepage features an image of Jobs flanked by chief creative officer John Lasseter and president Ed Catmull sitting in a row of seats at appears to be a movie theater.\n\nBelow them is Lasseter and Catmull’s joint statement on Jobs’ death that was released Wednesday:\n\nVIDEOS: Remembering Steve Jobs\n\n“Steve Jobs was an extraordinary visionary, our very dear friend and the guiding light of the Pixar family. He saw the potential of what Pixar could be before the rest of us, and beyond what anyone ever imagined. Steve took a chance on us and believed in our crazy dream of making computer-animated films; the one thing he always said was to simply ‘make it great.’ He is why Pixar turned out the way we did and his strength, integrity and love of life has made us all better people,” the statement continued. “He will forever be a part of Pixar’s DNA. Our hearts go out to his wife Laurene and their children during this incredibly difficult time.”\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood’s Notable Deaths\n\nJobs, the mastermind behind Apple’s iPhone, iPod, iPad, iMac and iTunes, built the first Apple computers from the Jobs family garage with fellow college dropout Steve Wozniak.\n\nHe was diagnosed with the pancreatic cancer in 2004, when he disclosed that doctors had removed a cancerous tumor from his pancreas."
