        "text": "I poignantly traverse back in time to 2011. On this day, Oct.05, 2011, the Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs departed this life failing to fend off the warring pancreatic cancer that had engulfed him.\n\nThe medical time of his death was 3 PM Pacific Time October 05, Wednesday, at his home in Palo Alto, California. Pacific time zone is 12.5 hours behind Indian Standard time. It was about 10 AM, October 6, Thursday morning in Bombay, India. I was early at my workplace. I started my morning by checking my emails and the feedback I had received on the Backup and Disaster recovery manual that I was tasked with. I went on to check some online news and I met with one of the most dreaded reports of my life. The internet was inundated with #RIP Steve Jobs. I got chills for a moment; distressed beyond horizons. A stark feeling of paralysis surged within. I held my breath and opened the news report on CNN and The New York Times.\n\nI was in constant dread that this day would appear soon. Just two months ago, on September 24, 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO of Apple with these words:\n\nI have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.\n\nThe stock market and the tech realm shuddered by this letter. We all knew that the inevitable would dawn soon.\n\nTim Cook’s Letter\n\nI was disoriented at my computer desk, struggling to come to terms with reality. I pulled myself together and continued reading the deluge of news reports and fan reactions on the internet. There was a Press Release on Apple website appended with Tim Cook’s letter, announcing the passing away of Steve. This excerpt from Tim’s letter made me drown further in my melancholy but at the same time, attempted to uplift me:\n\nSteve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.\n\nRemembering Steve and Condolences.\n\nTim stated in his letter that Apple has created a special email where we can generously send our heartfelt condolences — rememberingsteve@apple.com. Since I was a Steve Jobs aficionado, I wrote a small condolence message and sent it to the email address.\n\nHere is the saddest part: I sent my condolence message to Apple but the problem was that I myself was in a need of dire comfort. I was in a need of condolence because it was a personal loss for me as well. I never saw or met Steve in person but the impact he had on me was of celestial proportions. I scurried about around the office to bring my heart beats to normal. I could not withhold my aggravating pain so I decided to call my colleagues: Danny Joseph, and my docs lead Milton Veigas, to share my grief as they were not in office that day. I called up Dan and Milton and gave them the sorrowful news with a muffled and dim-witted voice. I told them how I felt. Dan and Milton both instantly empathized with me and consoled me with their comforting words. I thanked the gentlemen for their kind words and helping me alleviate my insurmountable pain.\n\nLater that day, in the evening around 6 PM IST and 9 AM EST, when my Pittsburgh Product Management team got online, I passed on my condolences to each member of my unit including Ron Hogue, who was my Technical Writing manager or the Docs Head Honcho. Heartfelt condolences were exchanged and we chatted a bit about Apple and the great products that Steve introduced.\n\nIt was dusk. My day was spent consoling myself and reading through the ubiquitous litany of RIP Steve Jobs. It was a day of stirred up emotions for a mortal genius who had impacted the world widely.\n\nThe following were three of my strongest reasons to be connected with Steve at that time:\n\n1. Steve Jobs and my first iPod\n\nI owned my first iPod in 2007, six years after Steve unveiled the first iPod to the world, sending all walkmans and disc-based music players to an early grave. All trashed! It was a 4GB iPod Nano 4th generation, silver color. She was sleek and elegant and perfect to handle. The product design was very thoughtful. All my fingers perfectly wrapped around the iPod — natural extension of human hand gestures unlike the other ugly and cumbersome Philips and Sony portable music players that tried to compete with the iPod. Jony Ive, the legend in product design can never get it wrong! Oh, the aesthetics of it, the beauty of it was nothing short of an industrial design marvel!\n\nMy iPod Nano gave me some of the surreal moments of my life. In my days of distress and melancholy, I played Red Hot Chili Peppers (Stadium Arcadium) and John Denver on my iPod which altered my neural networks profoundly getting me back on the road. I can still feel the click-wheel over my thumb!\n\nSteve Jobs and Disney Pixar\n\nSteve co-founded Pixar and pushed the animators to achieve extraordinary excellence. Steve’s constant quest for excellence gave birth to Toy Story- world’s first feature-length computer-animated film and it killed the box office. Steve Jobs was credited to be the Executive Producer of the film.\n\nThis is what John Lasseter and Ed Catmull had to say about Steve:\n\n“Steve Jobs was an extraordinary visionary, our very dear friend and the guiding light of the Pixar family. He saw the potential of what Pixar could be before the rest of us, and beyond what anyone ever imagined. Steve took a chance on us and believed in our crazy dream of making computer animated films; the one thing he always said was to simply ‘make it great.’ He is why Pixar turned out the way we did and his strength, integrity and love of life has made us all better people. He will forever be a part of Pixar’s DNA.”\n\nToy Story profoundly shaped and crafted my childhood. I was of Andy’s age at that time. Pixar’s creativity knew no bounds. I got the best friends of my childhood — Woody, Buzzlightyear, Jessy and others! They will remain my friends till infinity and beyond!\n\nSteve Jobs and Apple Stores\n\nSteve unveiled the first Apple store on May 15, 2001, in Calif, revolutionizing how customers interact with Apple staff and buy Apple products. Today, Apple is the top retailer in terms of sales per square foot, coming in at $5,546 per square foot. The most profitable followed by Tiffany & Co.\n\nWhat is with Apple stores and me? The captivating Apple logo, the minimalist interior design, and the finest-of-the breed Apple staff draw me and million others to Apple stores. The customer experience you get at Apple stores is nothing short of surreal. Be it west or east, visiting an Apple store will make you feel home.\n\nThese are some pictures from Apple stores based in Hong Kong clicked on my iPhone:"
