        "text": "Jobs' leadership saw the launch of many iconic Apple products, including the iMac, iBook, iPod, Mac OS X, iPhone, iPad, and many others.\n\nOn the 10th anniversary of Jobs' death in 2021, Apple released a video on its website commemorating the cofounder.\n\nThe video, which Jobs narrates, includes photos of the former CEO and clips of internal conversations and Apple events where products were launched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did Steve Jobs die?\n\nJobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, but he didn't start sharing the news with Apple employees until a year later.\n\nIn 2009, he received a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nJobs' pancreatic cancer relapsed in 2011, and he stepped down as Apple CEO in August of that year, when he accepted the role of chairman. He died on October 5, 2011; he'd worked for Apple until the day before his death. Jobs was 56.\n\nTim Cook took over as CEO after Jobs' resignation. He's called Jobs' death \"one of the saddest days of my life.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened at Apple after Steve Jobs died?\n\nCook has been Apple's CEO since 2011. Since then, Apple's biggest product launch has been the Apple Watch, which is used by more than 100 million people worldwide, including many US iPhone users.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe company also released AirPods, but the third-generation hasn't sold well, prompting the company to announce a redesign.\n\nIn June 2023, Apple debuted its artificial intelligence \"mixed-reality\" headset, Vision Pro. It's expected to be released in 2024 and sell for about $3,500.\n\nThe iPhone, first released in 2007 under Jobs, has accounted for most of Apple's revenue, according to the book \"After Steve: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul\" by Tripp Mickle. The book also suggests that the company hasn't released a \"truly breakthrough new product\" since Jobs' death.\n\nAdvertisement"
