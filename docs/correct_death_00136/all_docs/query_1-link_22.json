        "text": "Jobs was also the father of four children. He had his oldest, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, with his high-school girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan. Later, he had Reed Jobs, Erin Jobs, and Eve Jobs with his wife, Laurene Powell Jobs.\n\nJobs met his wife Laurene when she was an MBA student at Stanford in 1989, according to Isaacson's biography. Jobs was giving a guest lecture at the university when his future wife and her friend snuck into the lecture late and ended up sitting next to the Apple cofounder.\n\nJobs return to Apple\n\nIn 1996, knowing he had to do something dramatic, then-Apple CEO Gil Amelio negotiated a deal to buy NeXT, the computer startup operated by an exiled Jobs, in hopes that he would bring some much-needed direction to the company.\n\nInstead, Jobs staged a 1997 boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation. Jobs had decided that if Apple were to be saved, he would be the one to do it, even if it meant getting help from the company's rivals at Microsoft.\n\nIn August of that year, Jobs took the stage at the company's Macworld Expo event to announce that Apple had taken a $150 million investment from its long-time rivals at Microsoft.\n\n\"We need all the help we can get,\" Jobs said, to boos from the audience.\n\nJobs wasn't kidding. At the time, Apple's financial situation was so dire that Dell CEO and founder Michael Dell, one of Microsoft's biggest partners, said that if he were in Jobs' shoes, he'd \"shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.\"\n\nApple's comeback\n\nRelated stories\n\nJobs needed the help. At this point, he was CEO of both Apple and Pixar Studios, of which he had become chief investor in 1986 after funding it with $10 million. Jobs is actually credited as an executive producer on 1995's \"Toy Story.\"\n\nBy August of 1998, almost exactly a year after Microsoft cash came in, Apple released the iMac, an all-in-one, high-performance computer co-designed by Jobs and new talent Jonathan Ive.\n\nThe iMac came in multiple colors, the first time the world would get a taste of Ive's computer design sensibilities. This first iMac was a much-needed hit, selling 800,000 units in its first five months.\n\nJobs had originally pitched the name \"MacMan\" for this new Mac. It was Ken Segall, an executive with Apple's ad agency at the time, who suggested \"iMac.\" The \"i\" is for \"internet,\" since it took only two steps to connect to the web, but Apple has also said it stands for \"individuality\" and \"innovation.\"\n\nThe naming scheme would stick around. In 1999, Apple introduced the \"iBook,\" a funky machine that tried to replicate the iMac's success as an entry-level laptop.\n\nBut Apple's next dramatic move would come in 2001 when Mac OS X was released. Where Apple had been treading water with Mac OS 8 and 9, OS X was a drastic redesign based largely on the Unix and BSD technology at the core of Jobs' NeXT Computers.\n\nExpansion under Jobs\n\nFrom here, things started moving fast for Apple. Later in 2001, the company would open its first Apple Stores, in Virginia and California.\n\nIn October, Apple would take its first steps beyond the Mac with the iPod, a digital music player that promised \"1,000 songs in your pocket.\" The iPod actually got off to a slow start, largely because it started at a pricey $399 and worked only on Macs.\n\nIn 2003, Apple opened up the iTunes Music Store, with its novel pricing model of $0.99 per song, to turn the iPod into the center of a digital media universe. Around the same time, both iTunes and the iPod hit Windows, jump-starting Apple's music play.\n\nBut in 2003, Jobs received some news that would cast a shadow over the good times at Apple: he had pancreatic cancer. He kept it a secret until sharing the news with employees in 2004.\n\nIn just six years, Apple had gone from a laughingstock in tech to a serious player. And from 2003 to 2006, it went from around $6 per share to about $80 per share. Apple was still lagging behind Microsoft in market share, but it was making serious money. Celebrities like U2 and John Mayer were tapped to help out at company events.\n\nIn 2004, Jobs convened Project Purple, under his supervision and with Ive in charge, to develop a touch-screen device. Originally, Jobs envisioned a tablet, but it eventually turned into a concept for a cell phone.\n\nThe iPod lineup slowly grew, too. By 2005, there was the iPod, the iPod Mini, the iPad Nano, and the iPod Shuffle, in descending size order. That same year also saw the introduction of the first iPod with video, alongside the ability to buy movies and videos on iTunes.\n\nIn 2005, Motorola introduced the Rokr, a phone it made in partnership with Apple. It was the first phone that could play music from the iTunes Music Store. But it was limited to being able to store only 100 songs because of a limit in its software.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIn 2006, Jobs made a big move that probably saved the Mac. Former CEO John Sculley had banked Apple's future on the pricey PowerPC processor, while the major Windows PC manufacturers stuck with Intel. It meant Macs were both more expensive to buy and harder to develop software for. But in 2006, Apple introduced the first MacBook Pro alongside a new iMac, both of which came with Intel processors. It also meant that for the first time you could install Windows on a Mac.\n\nBut at this point, Jobs' health was starting to fade, and observers started to take notice. Note how thin Jobs looks here, shaking hands with Disney CEO Bob Iger at a 2006 Apple event.\n\nStill, 2006 also marked a personal victory for Jobs. He got to send this email to every Apple employee: \"Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future. Based on today's stock market close, Apple is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today. Steve.\"\n\nJobs leads Apple into the iPhone era\n\nAfter years of speculation, Jobs officially unveiled the iPhone at January 2007's Macworld Expo. It combined the music features of the iPod with a slick, responsive touchscreen that didn't need a stylus, unlike most mobile devices at the time. And the iPhone's Safari was the first full-featured web browser on a phone.\n\nAn excited media dubbed it the \"Jesus Phone.\" Excited fans camped out in front of Apple Stores nationwide. The iPhone was a massive hit, taking only 74 days from its August 2007 launch to sell a million units.\n\nIn 2008, Apple released the first big iPhone update: the iPhone 3GS. It had faster network speeds. But the biggest change was that it came with this thing called an App Store to let you install software from non-Apple developers. At launch, the App Store had 500 applications.\n\nFamed venture investor John Doerr of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers took the stage to announce a $100 million iFund for app developers. It was the start of the app economy, and Apple was leaving Microsoft in the dust.\n\nHe gets his iPad\n\nStill, Jobs' health continued to loom over Apple. In August 2008, Bloomberg accidentally published a 2,500-word obituary of Jobs. At a September 2008 keynote, Jobs poked fun at the idea.\n\nIn 2009, Tim Cook was tapped as interim CEO, while Jobs took the first of three extended medical leaves. Even on Jobs' return, Cook became a regular keynote speaker at Apple events. When Jobs returned, his prognosis was listed as \"excellent.\"\n\nIn 2010, Jobs finally introduced the Apple iPad, the tablet he had wanted since the early 2000s. That same year, he unveiled FaceTime, Apple's platform for video calls, which was an immediate hit.\n\nThe iPhone and the iPad accidentally started an internet standards war. Jobs thought Adobe's Flash, then the de facto standard for interactive web content, was slow and insecure, so Apple's mobile devices didn't support it. A jilted Adobe, recognizing the threat this posed to its business, took out magazine ads begging Apple to reconsider, to no avail.\n\nIn early 2011, during the last of his medical leaves, Jobs would give his final two product-announcement presentations: one in March for the iPad 2, and one in June for the iCloud service.\n\nJobs made his last public appearance in June 2011, in which he proposed a new Apple campus to the Cupertino City Council. After years of construction, Apple Park — the famed \"spaceship\" campus — opened in 2017.\n\nJobs steps down\n\nJobs stepped down as Apple CEO on August 24, 2011, accepting a role as chairman after his pancreatic cancer relapsed. Not long after, Jobs died on October 5, 2011, working for Apple until the day before his death.\n\nThat night, the flags at Apple headquarters flew at half-mast.\n\nTim Cook got the nod as full-time CEO after Jobs' resignation. Apple has continued to grow under Cook, becoming the first $1 trillion company in American history.\n\nLaurene Powell Jobs inherited the majority of Jobs' fortune when he died — including his lucrative stakes in Apple and Disney.\n\nApple officially hit the $1 trillion mark in 2018, making it the first American company to do so. It currently sits valued around the $3 trillion mark.\n\nGrace Kay and Aaron Mok contributed to this report."
