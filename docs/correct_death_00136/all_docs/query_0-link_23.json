        "text": "'Unprecedented' demand for iPhone 4S, say Aussie telcos\n\nMore than 1 million iPhone 4S preorders\n\nSteve Jobs died at home in Palo Alto, California, of respiratory arrest caused by a pancreatic tumour about 3pm on October 5, according to his death certificate. His occupation was listed as \"entrepreneur\" in the \"high tech\" business.\n\nThe Santa Clara County Public Health Department in San Jose, California, issued the document.\n\nRespiratory arrest was listed as the immediate cause of death, with \"metastatic pancreas neuroendocrine tumour\" listed as the underlying cause, according to the certificate.\n\nJobs's death occurred five years after the onset of the tumour, according to the certificate.\n\nNo autopsy was performed. Jobs was buried at a non-denominational cemetery in Santa Clara County on October 7. The name of the person who filled out the certificate was blacked out.\n\nHe had been diagnosed in 2003 with a neuroendocrine tumour, a rare form of pancreatic cancer, and underwent a liver transplant in 2009.\n\nApple chief executive Tim Cook announced to staff in a memo in the US on Monday that the company would hold a celebration of Jobs's life next week.\n\nThe event will be held at an outdoor amphitheatre at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, on October 19, Cook said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.\n\n\"Like many of you, I have experienced the saddest days of my lifetime and shed many tears during the past week,\" Cook said. \"And I've found comfort in both telling and listening to stories about Steve.\"\n\nApple announced on October 5 that Jobs, 56, had died but did not provide any details about the time and place.\n\nJobs resigned as chief executive officer of Apple on August 24.\n\nApple unveiled the latest version of its iPhone, the product that accounts for almost half of the company's sales, on October 4, the day before his death.\n\nApple declined to comment, spokesman Steve Dowling said."
