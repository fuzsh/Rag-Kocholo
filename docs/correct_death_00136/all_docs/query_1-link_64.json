        "text": "Steve Jobs is most famous for creating Apple Inc, the multimillion-dollar brand that has taken over the world, from MacBook computers to iPods and iPhones.\n\nBut where did his journey start, and how did he create Apple?\n\nThis curious inventor was quiet about his personal life during his career, but he started to open up during his last few years.\n\nHere are 15 inspiring facts about Steve Jobs that you should know.\n\nSteve Jobs was adopted.\n\nSteve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, to Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble.\n\nJandali came from a Muslim background and Schieble from a Catholic background, and they weren’t married when Schieble fell pregnant.\n\nBoth at the University of Wisconsin at the time, Schieble fled to California to have the birth.\n\nSchieble put Jobs up for adoption after deciding that she should not keep the baby.\n\nHowever, years later, they had a daughter that they kept.\n\nJobs almost became a Buddhist monk.\n\nIn 1974 Jobs traveled to India to stay at the Neem Karoli ashram, seeking spiritual enlightenment.\n\nUnfortunately, upon his arrival, he had learned of Neem Karoli’s death the previous year, so he altered his trip.\n\nInstead, he headed to the ashram of Haidakhan Babaji, where he spent seven months before returning to the US.\n\nJobs started to practice Zen Buddhism, which became a huge part of his life.\n\nAt one point, he considered becoming a monk at Eihei-Ji in Japan.\n\nSteve Jobs was a college dropout.\n\nLike many successful entrepreneurs, Jobs was a college dropout.\n\nIn 1972 Jobs enrolled at Reed College but dropped out after one semester.\n\nHe explained to his parents that he didn’t want to waste their money on education that was meaningless to him.\n\nJobs’ adopted parents had promised his biological mother Schieble that they would pay for his education.\n\nSteve Jobs Founded Apple Inc in 1976.\n\nAlongside Steve Wozniak, Jobs created the first Apple computer in March 1976.\n\nWozniak designed the Apple I, and together with Jobs, they decided to sell it to the public.\n\nBy April 1, 1976, the two set up Apple Computer Company as a business partnership alongside Ronald Wayne, now known as Apple Inc.\n\nThe business was registered at Jobs’ parents’ home on Crist Drive. Jobs’ bedroom was their office, which later moved to the garage.\n\nThe name “Apple” came from Jobs’ time on the All One Farm commune in Oregon.\n\nJobs spent a lot of time in the apple orchard and decided that should be the company name.\n\nJobs named an Apple computer after his daughter.\n\nOut of Steve’s four children, only three were with his wife, Laurene Powell.\n\nHis first child was with his Homestead High on and off girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan.\n\nWhen Brennan found out she was pregnant, Jobs denied responsibility for the pregnancy, which resulted in Brennan ending her relationship with Jobs.\n\nLisa Nicole Brennan-Jobs was born May 17, 1978. Jobs was not present for Lisa’s birth but went to visit Brennan three days later. Together they named their daughter Lisa.\n\nJobs then named the computer he was working on the Apple Lisa.\n\nHe then denied publically that he named the system after his daughter and that LISA stood for “Local Integrated Systems Architecture.”\n\nIn later years he has admitted that the project was named after his daughter.\n\nHe married one of his students.\n\nJobs first met his wife-to-be in 1989 during a lecture he was giving at Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\nLaurene Powell was sat in the front row of Jobs’ lecture, and he couldn’t keep his eyes off her.\n\nFollowing the lecture, Jobs met with Powell in the car park and invited her to dinner.\n\nJobs proposed to Powell in 1990, and they married at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park on March 18, 1991.\n\nJobs met his biological sister at age 27.\n\nDue to being adopted as a child and not knowing his biological family, it took a long time to find out about his sister.\n\nJobs tracked down his sister, author Mona Simpson, and met her when he was 27 years old.\n\nHer first book was titled “Anywhere But Here,” which was about her relationship with her parents, Jobs’ biological family.\n\nIn 1986 Steve Jobs funded the Graphics Group, which later became Pixar.\n\nInitially, it was a sub-company under Disney until Jobs invested, and the company became its own spin-off company.\n\nThe first Pixar film “Toy Story” (1995), was a joint venture with Disney, but because of Jobs’ investment, it meant he was credited as executive producer.\n\nDisney bought back the company in 2006.\n\nAs part of the takeover, Disney converted Pixar shares into Disney shares, which made Jobs one of Disney’s largest shareholders for a short amount of time.\n\nHe has over 300 patents to his name.\n\nThe exact number of patents that include Jobs’ name as either sole inventor or co-inventor varies across the board.\n\nJobs has 43 patents on “inventions” to his name, whilst the rest are all design-related.\n\nHe has patents for speakers, staircases, packages, power adaptors, phones, etc.\n\nJobs received the patent for the Mac OS X Dock user interface the day before he died.\n\nSince his death, he has received another 141 patents to his name. Thus, there are hundreds of patents that contain Jobs’ name.\n\nJobs wore the same outfit daily.\n\nNot the exact same garments, but the same style.\n\nJobs adopted a dress code that consisted of a black turtleneck, jeans, and sneakers.\n\nHis style was simple, but he became known for it.\n\nHe would only wear Levis jeans, and it is rumored that he owned around 100 pairs of them.\n\nJobs had a liver transplant.\n\nIn 2003 Steve Jobs was diagnosed with cancer, a tumor in his pancreas.\n\nInitially, Jobs ignored suggested medical treatment in search of alternatives.\n\nIt is thought that the alternative treatment is possibly why jobs experienced such an early death.\n\nIn 2004 he finally underwent surgery to remove the tumor from his pancreas. Sadly in 2006, his tumor returned, but not everyone knew.\n\nTim Cook offered Jobs a part of his liver as they both have a rare blood type.\n\nIn April 2009, Jobs had a liver transplant in Memphis, Tennesse, at the Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute.\n\nIn January 2011, Apple granted Jobs medical leave to focus on his health.\n\n2007 was a good year for Jobs.\n\nIn 2007 Jobs was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.\n\nIt is located in The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts.\n\nThe first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, after being worked on since 2005.\n\nAlso, in 2007, Fortune Magazine named Jobs the most powerful person in business.\n\nHe had a net worth of $10.2 billion the year of his death.\n\nIn 1978, at the young age of 23, Steve Jobs’ net worth was $1 million. Just two years later, Jobs was worth $250 million.\n\nAt the time of his death in 2011, his net worth was $10.2 billion.\n\nMost of this was from his stock in Disney as opposed to Apple.\n\nJobs’ biography was released 19 days after his death.\n\nIn 2009 Steve Jobs began to open up about his life and take part in interviews with journalists.\n\nJobs allowed Walter Isaacson to write his only biography.\n\nIsaacson was given all the rights to create the biography except for the cover image.\n\nJobs allowed Isaacson to get truthful interviews from friends, family, and coworkers to make the book a true account of his life.\n\nIsaacson based the book on over 40 interviews with Jobs and conducted hundreds of interviews with people who were part of his life.\n\nJobs stated that he did not want to read the book before it was published as he wanted it to be a true account and not have any influence.\n\nSadly Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, and his biography wasn’t published until October 24, just 19 days after his death.\n\nSteve Jobs has his own statue in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nThere is a nearly 7-foot (2.1 meters) tall bronze statue of Jobs in the capital city of Hungary.\n\nArtist Erno Toth made the sculpture for Graphisoft, a Hungarian software company.\n\nThe statue was erected on December 21, 2011, following his death that year.\n\nThe statue was put up to commemorate Jobs’ contributions to the tech industry and the support he gave Graphisoft during their communist rule.\n\nThe statue is located at Graphisoft Park, where other tech and science companies are based.\n\nSteve Jobs has had an interesting life, starting with being adopted but finding a spiritual path through Buddhism.\n\nHis interest in electronics and computers was his gateway to a successful and innovative future, creating Apple Inc.\n\nJobs shaped personal computer systems and technology so much that even today, his work is a part of everyday life.\n\nHis legacy will live on as Apple continues to create and invent."
