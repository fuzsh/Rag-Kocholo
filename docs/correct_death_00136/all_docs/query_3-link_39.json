        "text": "One of Steve Jobs' closest friends and business allies has said the former Apple boss's own self-belief and mindset led him to put off having his cancer treated.\n\nAvie Tevanian said Mr Jobs had a \"reality distortion field\" - a force of will that helped him get people to achieve the impossible.\n\nThat same belief system caused him to refuse conventional treatment for his cancer in the critical early stages after diagnosis.\n\nHe decided instead to explore alternative therapies and go on a special diet.\n\nMr Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, died aged 56 on 5 October 2011 - eight years after first being diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer.\n\nHe was diagnosed with insulinoma, which unlike other pancreatic cancers, is curable and can be treated with surgery.\n\nDoctors recommended an early operation but Mr Jobs could not be persuaded to stop his pursuit of alternative remedies.\n\n\"Being Steve, it was easy for him to find people who would agree that it was worth a try.\n\n\"Many of us around him, myself included, his wife and other people were saying: 'Steve, you know, maybe you should just have some surgery here and get it over with,'\" said Mr Tevanian, who was chief technology officer at Apple until 2006 and a long-standing friend of Mr Jobs - even organising his stag party.\n\n\"He was the kind of person that could convince himself of things that weren't necessarily true or necessarily easy, maybe easy is the better way to think of it.\n\n\"That always worked with him for designing products, where he could go to people and ask them to do something that they thought was impossible.\n\n\"But he would keep asking and say: 'You know, it's impossible but I still want you to try' - and because of his sheer will, they would actually make it happen, or make something like it happen.\""
