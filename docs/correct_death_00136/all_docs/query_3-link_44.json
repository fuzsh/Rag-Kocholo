He learned from Japan's Soto school of Zen Buddhism and, in a biography, said that Zen Buddhism was aesthetically sublime, and that the sublimity of Kyoto's gardens were a reflection of that faith.\n\nA visit to Japan's ancient capital reveals aspects of Kyoto that Jobs found inspirational, as do conversations with some of the people who encountered him during his trips to the city."
