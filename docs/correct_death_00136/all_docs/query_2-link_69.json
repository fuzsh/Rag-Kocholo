        "text": "The claim: Steve Jobs' last words were a commentary on wealth\n\nSteve Jobs’ last words were about his admiration of his family, not a critique of wealth, as a viral post claims.\n\nA post that has been circulating in different forms since 2015 claims the Apple founder and billionaire died disillusioned with his wealth.\n\n“In other eyes, my life is the essence of success, but aside from work, I have a little joy. And in the end, wealth is just a fact of life to which I am accustomed,” the post claims Jobs said.\n\n“At this moment, lying on the bed, sick and remembering all my life, I realize that all my recognition and wealth that I have is meaningless in the face of imminent death,” it goes on to say. “You can hire someone to drive a car for you, make money for you — but you can not rent someone to carry the disease for you. One can find material things, but there is one thing that can not be found when it is lost — life.\n\n“Your true inner happiness does not come from the material things of this world. Whether you’re flying first class, or economy class — if the plane crashes, you crash with it.”\n\nThe post, made by Sergio Cardenas, then goes on to talk about the importance of seeking happiness, health and love in how you live your life over material possessions. The post has over 36,000 shares.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Cardenas for comment.\n\nFact check: Camping World CEO is misquoted in viral meme\n\nWhat did Steve Jobs say on his death bed?\n\nWhen Jobs died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, his sister Mona Simpson spoke about his last words as part of her eulogy.\n\nShe said, “With that will, that work ethic, that strength, there was also sweet Steve’s capacity for wonderment, the artist’s belief in the ideal, the still more beautiful later.\n\nJobs' final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times.\n\n“Before embarking, he’d looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life’s partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them,” she continued.\n\n“Steve’s final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'”\n\nFact check: Ernest Hemingway quote falsely attributed to Joe Biden\n\nWhere did the other speech come from?\n\nNo one who was close to Jobs has ever said the often-circulated essay was ever written or said by Jobs, according to a fact check by Snopes.\n\nSnopes found the speech didn’t start circulating until 2015, four years after his death.\n\nThe version being fact-checked in this article contains slightly different language than the one Snopes checked, but there are enough similarities that there is a clear thread between them.\n\nFact check: NBA legend Larry Bird did not tell players to 'shut up and play the damn game'\n\nOur rating: False\n\nWe rate this claim FALSE, because it is not supported by our research. There is no evidence Steve Jobs used his final moments to deliver a speech against materialism. Instead, a relative has recounted that he looked at those he loved for a long moment before saying “Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow.”\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nFacebook post\n\nSnopes, Nov. 8, 2015, \"Steve Jobs Deathbed Speech\"\n\nNew York Times, Oct. 30, 2011, \"A Sister’s Eulogy for Steve Jobs\"\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.
