        "text": "Apple announced tonight that co-founder and chairman Steve Jobs, the Silicon Valley legend who returned to engineer the computer company’s dramatic turnaround, has died at 56.\n\n“He was a guy who set out to change the world with computers, and he actually did,” said Carl Howe, an analyst at Yankee Group, a tech research firm in Boston. “It’s safe to say he touched more people with his products than any other single person on earth today. That’s quite a legacy to leave behind.”\n\nApple said it was “deeply saddened” by Jobs’ death. The company posted a statement on its Web site and offered an e-mail address (rememberingsteve@apple.com) for messages of condolence. View Apple statement here\n\n“Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius and the world has lost an amazing human being,” the company said. “Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.”\n\nJobs, who has been ailing for years, stepped down as CEO on Aug. 24.\n\n“I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know,” Jobs said in a statement then. “Unfortunately, that day has come.”\n\nHowe doesn’t expect much negative impact for the company, which he said Jobs left in good hands.\n\n“You’ve got to give him credit for planning,” he said. “He said there was a succession plan all along, and it was flawlessly executed. I don’t think anybody there is going to miss a beat. It’s a testament to his design sense that his passing will have no effect on the business he founded.”\n\nJobs was part of the inaugural class of Cambridge’s Entrepreneur Walk of Fame unveiled last month in Kendall Square. Honorees included inventor Thomas Edison, Microsoft’s Bill Gates and Hewlett-Packard’s founders.\n\n“On the one hand you can’t love the guy because of some personal flaws, but on the other hand you have to respect the art that the artist produced,” said Bill Aulet, managing director of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center. “He’s the entrepreneur of our generation, really.”\n\nJobs, whose company revolutionized the computer industry with products such as the Macintosh and later became a retail titan with its iPod and iconic stores, was one of the world’s best-known CEOs and has enjoyed perhaps the greatest second act in corporate history since returning to the company he co-founded.\n\nWhen Jobs stepped down in August, Tim Cook took over as CEO, and yesterday unveiled Apple’s latest iPhone, the 4S, to mixed reviews. Cook previously served as CEO in 2004, while Jobs was treated for pancreatic cancer, and in 2009, when Jobs had a liver transplant.\n\nJobs, who co-founded the company at the age of 21, was ousted by the board in 1985. When he returned 12 years later, Apple had run up $1.86 billion in losses over two years. It was 90 days away from bankruptcy, Jobs would later say.\n\nSince then, Jobs led Apple’s transformation into a seller of everything from smartphones to music. He engineered the Cupertino, Calif.-based company’s comeback by honing Apple’s industrial design, tightly integrating software and hardware, and pushing into new markets.\n\nPerhaps most influentially, Jobs in 2001 launched the iPod, which offered “1,000 songs in your pocket.” Over the next 10 years, its white earphones and thumb-dial control seemed to become more ubiquitous than the wristwatch.\n\nThe touchscreen iPhone, introduced in 2007, has become Apple’s best-selling product and turned the company into the world’s biggest smartphone maker.\n\nBy 2011, Apple had become the second-largest company of any kind in the United States by market value. In August, it briefly surpassed Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company."
