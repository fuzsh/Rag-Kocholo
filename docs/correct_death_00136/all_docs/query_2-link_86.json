        "text": "Steve Jobs's rail-thin appearance a year ago shocked Apple watchers. An Apple flack tried to claim it was \"a common bug.\" But Jobs, who has been battling pancreatic cancer, was in mortal danger, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"He was one real sick guy,'' said the Journal's source. \"Fundamentally he was starving to death over a nine-month period. He couldn't digest protein.\"\n\nJobs is on the mend after a six-month medical leave, and is expected to reassume his post as Apple's CEO at the end of the month -- a return that investors and Macolytes alike will cheer. The way the company handled Jobs's illness, though, leaves lingering questions.\n\nLast December, weeks before Jobs was expected to take the stage at the annual Macworld conference, the company's highest-profile showcase for new products, Apple belatedly announced that the company's best showman would be a no-show. A spokesman tried to pass the decision off as a strategic move to bypass trade shows like Macworld in favor of smaller, more frequent product unveilings. But Gizmodo, a gadget blog, revealed that Jobs's rapidly declining health was the real reason for his absence.\n\nMany scoffed at the story, which the blog attributed to an Apple insider. But the Wall Street Journal reports that a person familiar with Jobs's health said he was extremely ill.\n\nJobs is widely believed to have undergone a form of gastrointestinal surgery known as a Whipple procedure similar to a gastric bypass in 2004. Hormone deficiencies and related digestive problems are common in people who have undergone the Whipple, according to Fortune's Apple 2.0 blog."
