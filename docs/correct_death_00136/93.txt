PALO ALTO, Calif. — Neighbors, business leaders and others are gathering outside the Palo Alto home of Steve Jobs as they pay their respects to the Apple co-founder and former CEO.

Chetan Patwardhan, the CEO of San Mateo-based Stratogent Corp. told an Associated Press reporter that Jobs was – quote – the “only one who figured out how to create the technolgy that connect people.”

Patwardhan described Jobs as an “inspiration.”

Bouquets of flowers were left outside the downtown Palo Alto home, while others left chalk drawings on the sidewalk to remember Jobs.

One drawing was a basic sketch of an iPhone, with the words “thanks for the iPhone technology.”

The words in another drawing said “thanks for changing the world.”

Jobs died Wednesday at age 56 after battling pancreatic cancer.
