The name Livland/Livonia refers to the Livs, a people closely related to the Ests; this name is often (early and late) used for the whole \"Baltic provinces,\" covering present-day Latvia and Estonia. During much of the country's history, from c.1209 until 1918, the dominant elite, under all regimes, consisted of German merchants and landholders, who provided much of the administration; Riga was a Hanseatic city.\n\nChairman of the Latvian (to 23 Oct 1918 Provisional) National Council\n\n29 Nov 1917 - 17 Nov 1918 Voldemārs Zāmuēls (b. 1872 - d. 1948) Non-party\n\n(underground to 11 Nov 1918)\n\nChairman of the Joint Council of Livonia, Estonia, Riga, and Ösel\n\n12 Apr 1918 - 8 Nov 1918 Adolph Konstantin Jakob Baron (b. 1851 - d. 1925) Non-party\n\nPilar von Pilchau\n\nHead of the Military Administration of the Baltic Lands (Baltikum)\n\n1 Aug 1918 - 4 Dec 1918 Alfred Freiherr von Gossler (b. 1867 - d. 1946) Mil Reichskommissare for the Baltic Sea Region (Ostseeraum)\n\n1 Aug 1918 - 8 Nov 1918 Friedrich Karl Alexander Cäsar (b. 1869 - d. 1946) Non-party\n\nFreiherr von Falkenhausen\n\n8 Nov 1918 - 14 Nov 1918 August Winnig (b. 1878 - d. 1956) Non-party\n\nDuke (nominated, but did not assume office)\n\n8 Nov 1918 - 28 Nov 1918 Adolf Friedrich Albrecht Heinrich (b. 1873 - d. 1969)\n\nHerzog zu Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nChairman of the Baltic Council of Regency\n\n6 Nov 1918 - 17 Nov 1918 Adolph Konstantin Jakob Baron (s.a.)
