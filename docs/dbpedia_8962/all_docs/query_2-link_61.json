        "text": "Latvia was created in WW I and comprises the main, southern part of the former mediaeval Terra Mariana, itself consisting of the territories of the Livonian Order, the bishoprics of Riga, Dorpat and Oesel-Wiek. together with the Duchy of Estonia.\n\nThe territory was for a long time a part of the Russian Empire when it was divided into the Governorates of Courland and Livonia.\n\nIn the 19th century, the first Latvian National Awakening began among ethnic Latvian intellectuals, a movement that partly reflected similar nationalist trends elsewhere in Europe. This revival was led by the \"Young Latvians\" (in Latvian: jaunlatviei) from the 1850s to the 1880s.\n\nDuring WWI the Germans captured most of the country between 7 May and 3 September 1917. A Latvian National Council was proclaimed on 16 November 1917. On 30 November 1917, the Council declared an autonomous Latvian province within ethnographic boundaries, and a formal independent Latvian republic was declared on 15 January 1918. On 12 April 1918, a Provincial Assembly composed of 35 Baltic Germans, 13 Estonians, and 11 Latvians passed a resolution calling upon the German Emperor to recognize the Baltic provinces as a monarchy and make them a German protectorate.\n\nOn 8 March and 12 April 1918, the local Baltic German-dominated Kurländische Landesrat and the Vereinigter Landesrat of Livland, Estland, Riga, and Ösel had declared themselves independent states, known as the Duchy of Courland (Herzogtum Kurland) and the Baltic State (Baltischer Staat), respectively. Both states proclaimed themselves to be in personal union with the Kingdom of Prussia, although the German government never responded to acknowledge that claim.\n\nThe Baltic lands were nominally recognized as a sovereign state by emperor Wilhelm II only on 22 September 1918, half a year after Soviet Russia had formally relinquished all authority over its former Imperial Baltic provinces to Germany in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. On 5 November 1918, a temporary Regency Council (Regentschaftsrat) for the new state led by Baron Adolf Pilar von Pilchau was formed on a joint basis from the two local Land Councils.\n\nThe capital of the new state was to be Riga. It was to be a confederation of seven cantons: Kurland (Courland), Riga,Lettgallen (Latgale),Südlivland (South Livonia),Nordlivland (North Livonia), Ösel (Saaremaa), and Estland (Estonia), the four first cantons thus covering the territory corresponding to today's Latvia and the latter three corresponding to today's Estonia.\n\nAt the German capitulation on 11 November 1918 Latvia was recognized de facto by Great Britain, confirming a prior verbal communication of 23 October to Meierowitz by the British Minister for Foreign Affairs, A. J. Balfour. On 18 November 1918 Latvia proclaimed its independence.\n\nIn December 1918 Soviet Russia invaded the new republic and rapidly conquered almost all the territory of Latvia. The Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic was proclaimed on 17 December 1918 with the political, economic, and military backing of the Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia. Riga itself was captured by the Soviet Army on 4 April 1919\n\nOn January 3, 1920 united Latvian and Polish forces launched an attack on the Soviet army in Latgalia and took Daugavpils. By the end of January they reached the etnographic border of Latvia. On August 11, 1920 according to the LatvianSoviet Peace Treaty (Treaty of Riga) Soviet Russia relinquished authority over the Latvian nation and claims to Latvian territory once and for all times.\n\nAs a result of the the MolotovRibbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany on August 23, 1939 however, Latvia was incorporated into the Soviet Union on August 5, 1940.\n\nNazi troops occupied Riga on July 1, 1941 and occupied Latvia until 13 October 1944 when the Republic of 1940 was restored.\n\nOn May 4, 1990. the Latvian SSR Supreme Council, adopted a declaration restoring independence which resulted in complete independence on 21 August 1991. At that date the name of the country was changed into Latvijas Republika\n\nIn July-August 1915, to serve against the German invaders, the Russian General Headquarters organized eight regular and one reserve Latvieu Strēlnieki (Latvian Riflemen) battalions which were named after Latvian towns. Its badge consisted of an eight-pointed sun inscribed with the initials of the battallion in cyrillic and latin script, charged with a sword per bend sinister, crested with the Russian eagle and surrounded by a garland of oak and laurel. [1]\n\nOn the banners of the several battalions the sun was depicted differently and so served as the model on which the first national emblem was based. This showed also a sun but charged with three ears of grain encircled by a ring, symbolizing the union of the three parts of the new Republic: Vidzeme, Latgale and combined Kurzeme-Zemgale.\n\nThe emblem was printed on stamps issued 1918-1921\n\nA new national emblem was printed on paper money issued 1919-20. This consisted of a disc charged with an L and three five-pointed stars surrounded by 17 flames and rising from a national flag.\n\n10 ruble note, 1919\n\nIn this emblem the L symbolizes Latvija, the three stars represent the three parts Courland, Livonia and Letgalle and the seventeen flames the 17 districts of the republic. The colors of the flag were adopted together with the proclamation of the republic on 18 November 1918\n\nA similar emblem was at the heart of an achievement displayed behind the chairman of the Constituent Assembly of 1 May 1920, with two human beings standing in a field for supporters.\n\nConstituent National Assembly, 1 May 1920"
