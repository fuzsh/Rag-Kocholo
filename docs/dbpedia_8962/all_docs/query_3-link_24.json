        "text": "Reichskommissariat Moskowien is a colony of the Greater Germanic Reich in Eastern Europe, comprised of most of the former European parts of the Russian SFSR. Reichskommissariat Moskowien borders Reichskommissariat Ostland to the west, Reichskommissariat Ukraine to the south-west, Reichskommissariat Kaukasien to the south, the Republic of Finland to the north, and various Russian warlords to the east. Moskowien is the largest European Reichskommissariat. The colony is operated by Reichskommissar Siegfried Kasche, the former German Ambassador to Croatia. The Reichskommissar has his work cut out for himself, dealing with the radioactive 'Eastern Dead Zone' within his territory and various hostile Russian warlords to his East. Moscow itself is in the process of revival, but scientists in the Reich estimate it will be decades before radioactivity subsides enough within the city before it becomes habitable again.\n\nHeisenberg Device\n\nIn 1942 the war in the East ground to a halt. Progress was too slow for Hitler, who ordered to deployment of his most destructive weapon yet: The Heisenberg Device. Harnessing the power of the atom itself, the Brunhilde bomber crew dropped the first A-Bomb at 09:13 local time, ending life for Russians as they knew it. No one knows how many died in the aftermath, but when Stalin refused to relent the Germans unleashed their entire remaining arsenal - even the bombs meant for the US and Britain - on the Soviet Union. The relentless nuclear bombing transformed the landscape into a hellscape. Hundreds of thousands are estimated to have died before Stalin was shot by one of his officers, who quickly ended the war, fearing further nuclear devices would be dropped on their helpless population.\n\nThe Eastern Dead Zone\n\nFormer Western Russia has been transformed through the relentless nuclear bombing. The lands have turned to toxic marshes and swamps, and all major cities reduced to rubble. It was here that Kasche first ordered Walkers instead of the usual tanks in order to navigate the wasteland with his troops more effectively. The pioneering of Walker technology was quickly adopted by various Russian warlords who, using guerrilla tactics, stole various frames and walkers from the Reichskommissariat and adapted them considerably. The Eastern Dead Zone is marked by the rotting structures of its cities, most notably Moscow. Though it is the official capital of the puppet state, few still live here besides scavengers. Instead, most officials and civilians have moved further west, behind the various hills that spared some of the Moscow suburbs from the nuclear blast. Even so, Nazi officials are few and far between, and those who are sent here rarely venture outside. Most German troops stationed here are penal battalions or various \"Ostlegionen\" - SS troops that were marshaled from the various Eastern European states.\n\n\"Freedom through Strength\"\n\nCapital:\n\nMoskau\n\nPopulation:\n\n11,920,000\n\nHead of State:\n\nReichskommissar Siegfried Kasche\n\nFounding Date\n\n1942\n\nAlternative Names\n\nEastern Dead Zone\n\nOstlegion Soldier assigned to the Eastern Dead Zone"
