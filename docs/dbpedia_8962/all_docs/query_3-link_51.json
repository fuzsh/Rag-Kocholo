Where ghettos or camps are set up they will be distributed through them for the care of the inmates.\n\nThe following is decreed for the handling of Jewish property:\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe property of the Jewish population is to be confiscated and placed in safekeeping.... All Jewish property is to be registered...\n\nCompulsory Surrender:\n\nJewish property is to be surrendered on special demand. The demand may be made by general proclamation or by order to certain individuals.\n\nThe following further measures are to be strived for vigorously, with due consideration for local, and particularly economic, conditions."
