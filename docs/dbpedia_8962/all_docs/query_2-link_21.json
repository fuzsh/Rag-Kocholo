        "text": "The Reichskommissariat Ostland (RKO; lit. 'Reich Commissariat of Eastland')[lower-alpha 1] was established by Nazi Germany in 1941 during World War II. It became the civilian occupation regime in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and the western part of Byelorussian SSR. German planning documents initially referred to an equivalent Reichskommissariat Baltenland.[1] The political organization for this territory – after an initial period of military administration before its establishment – involved a German civilian administration, nominally under the authority of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories led by Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg, but actually controlled by the Nazi official Hinrich Lohse, its appointed Reichskommissar.\n\nQuick Facts Status, Capital ...\n\nClose\n\nThe main political objectives of the Nazis for the Reichskommissariat, as created by Adolf Hitler and laid out by the Reich Ministry was Lebensraum, which included the genocide of the local Jewish population, as well as the settlement of Germanic peoples along with the expulsion and murder of some of the native population and the Germanization of the rest. These policies applied not only to the Reichskommissariat Ostland but also to other German-occupied Soviet territories. Through the use of the Order Police battalions and Einsatzgruppen A and B, with active participation of local auxiliary forces, over a million Jews were killed in the Reichskommissariat Ostland.[2] The Germanization policies, built on the foundations of the Generalplan Ost, would later be carried through by a series of special edicts and guiding principles for the general settlement plans for Ostland.[3]"
