        "text": "Basically I have an iMac and brought Logic Pro 9 off the Apple store a few years ago. I'm going to get a Macbook pro in the next few months and was wondering how do I transfer Logic Pro and everything with it onto my Macbook pro? Also do I need to get another Serial Code or can I keep the same one?\n\nAlso, another problem I'm having is Logic Pro 9 doesn't show up on my purchase list.\n\nHi,\n\nI have a similar issue, only I have a iMac 21\" (Snow Leopard edition, recently upgraded to Mavericks) and when I bought the iMac I purchased it along with Logic Pro 9 from the local Apple dealer, physical instal CD's box and stuff, and I'm about to buy a new iMac 27\" (2014 edition).\n\nThe thing is I wanted to run Logic pro 9 on both machines - can I just install Logic Pro 9 on the new machine and have running at the same time or do I need to get some permission from Apple to do so?\n\nThere must be some issues about the licence and serial number...\n\nCan you help?\n\nThanks\n\nFrancis Mann\n\nRegarding the Logic app, you, open to the App Store app, login with the same Apple ID on your new Mac that you used to purchase Logic and click on the \"Purchases\" tab. There is a list with all the purchases you made with this Apple ID. Click the download for Logic and that's it.\n\nRegarding the other files, you might want to copy the following files over\n\n\"userfolder\"/Music/Audio Music Apps/ Most of the settings files should be in this folder unless you used an older Logic version, then some files might also be in you user Library.Aplication Support/ folder\n\n\"userfolder\"/Music/Logic/ These should be all your Logic Projects unless you saved them to other location that his default location\n\n\"user folder\"/Library/Preferences/com.apple.logic10.plist/ This is your Logic settings file\n\n\"user folder\"/Library/Preferences/com.apple.logic.pro.cs/ This is the settings file if you made configurations in the Controller Assignment Window\n\n\"user folder\"/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/ If you have saved custom Apple Loops\n\nIn addition you might have to re-install any plugins or other related apps/files that you use in Logic.\n\n(Plus, copy all the other important files that I forgot to mention ðŸ˜‰)\n\nHope that helps\n\nEdgar Rothermich\n\nhttp://DingDingMusic.com/Manuals/\n\n'I may receive some form of compensation, financial or otherwise, from my recommendation or link.'\n\nThe ' network check' code was removed in 9.1.6 so.... So long as you update both versions to the 9.1.6 version, ( and in your case you will probably need to install 9.1.8 anyhow due to issues with earlier versions and Mavericks ) technically speaking there is nothing network check wise... stopping you from running both copies at the same time.\n\nHowever, the user agreement for the boxed edition of Logic Studio still states that while you can install on one laptop and one desktop you are not allowed to run both copies at the same time.... This was changed for those people who purchased Logic Pro 9.1.6 or later via the App Store..... where so long as you 'own or control' all computers concerned you can run Logic 9 on all of them without any restrictions..So it's a bit of a grey area.... given you can update Logic pro 9 via the App Store itself.. so then which T&C still applies? The older one for Logic Studio/Logic pro 9 or the newer one for the App Store version.. that supersedes it according to Apples user Agreement.\n\nPersonally, i dont think Apple would care if you ran your copy of LP on two different computers at the same time given you own both of them,,,, and you paid for Logic Studio which includes Logic Pro 9... and they removed the code to prevent you from doing so in 9.1.6... but strictly speaking, it could still be against the terms and conditions of the version of Logic you bought... So read into that, what you will.\n\nHi Nigel, always helping out, thanks man.\n\nI'm working with Logic Pro 9.1.8. I purchased back in 2010 in a Logic Studio 2.0 Retail package.\n\nYes, I remember reading somewhere that we can install Logic 9 on both a desktop and a portable machine. Maybe I can do it on two iMacs I own.\n\nThe main thing would be if I install Logic 9 on the new iMac, most likely won't be any upgrades currently available to 9.1.8.\n\nThat's not a big issue, I'm just being cautious having the new iMac (thunderbolt connection) running Logic 9 and Logic X, dealing with my Motu 828 Mk3 (firewire plugs), before letting go of my current gear that is working smoothly (after those clicks and poffs went away). You can check some bits of it on utube if you like.\n\nI read lots of stuff (you know about) concerning the new iMac addressing Motu and other sound cards, but, if I have it right, most issues occur with Fusion Drives, and I intend to stay on HD (for now). I think with a Thunderbolt to Firewire plugging I won't be having any problems - we'll see, and before jumping on the new horse, Logic X, I'll try to have Logic 9 running first and later I'll get Logic X and try to run both on the new Mac, so I can sort things out if issues occur.\n\nI cannot afford being stuck with a non communicating iMac and Motu 828Mk3, so I'll go step by step - if the new gear has issues I'll have the old gear to hold on to while trying to solve those issues.\n\nThanks again Nigel\n\nTake care\n\nI recently did a Migration from a 2012 iMac 3.4 GHz, iCore 7, 1 TB Fusion running Yosemite 10.10.1 to a 2014 iMac 3.7 Ghz, iCore 7, 1 TB Fusion running Yosemite 10.10.1.\n\nFor some peculiar reason @ 400 GB of info did not transfer. Including none of my Logic X files (which I now have transferred to a 3.0 USB external HD). What I cannot find is \"user Library.Aplication Support/ folder\" or any of the subsequent items in your clear instructions. Intact, I cannot find a User Library at all. I have a recollection that Apple dispensed with User Libraries -- perhaps with Yosemite. Is that correcty/ If so, what should I do to accomplish the points you're indicating?\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nIn addition, imho... Its never wise to use Migration to move Logic and its various parts over to a new Mac.\n\nToo many reports of missing this and that files have come from users who have tried that method... and it can be a real pain and much more time consuming in the long term to fix everything.\n\nPersonally, I always install from scratch again... and then manually copy over my own data like projects, audio files, photos, docs etc.... using an external HD...\n\nNever had any issues using this way of doing things...\n\nHey, so you mentioned that as long as I own both of the computers then its ok, but I am in a bit of a different situation.\n\nI have a producer friend who is currently saving up money to buy Logic. I already own it, but I don't know how to produce anything worth listening too XD\n\nIs there someway that I can transfer my already-purchased Logic onto his computer? Two different homes, but I would be giving mine away, not copying. Is that possible?"
