        "text": "There are 2 node allocations used in the graph:\n\nThe single node is specified by the sandbox code used in the URLs of input data. The following dialog shows the File URL value: sandbox://data/path-to-csv-file, where data is the ID of the server sandbox containing the specified file. And it is the data local sandbox which defines the single node.\n\nThe part of the graph demarcated by the four Cluster components may have specified its allocation by the file URL attribute as well, but this part does not work with files at all, so there is no file URL. Thus, we will use the node allocation attribute. Since components may adopt the allocation from their neighbors, it is sufficient to set it only for one component.\n\nAgain, dataPartitioned in the following dialog is the sandbox ID.\n\nThis project requires 3 sandboxes: data, dataPartitioned and PhoneChargesDistributed.\n\nIf the graph was executed with the sandbox configuration of the previous figure, the node allocation would be:"
