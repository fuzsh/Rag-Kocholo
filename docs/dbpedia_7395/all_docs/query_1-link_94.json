        "text": "This topic guides you through installing the Foundry Licensing Utility (FLU). After installation, the FLU can run from either a desktop icon, an explorer or Finder window, or from the command line using arguments.\n\nQualified Operating Systems\n\nâ¢ macOS Mojave (10.14)\n\nâ¢ Windows 11, Windows 10, or Windows Server 2019 Standard (64-bit)\n\nâ¢ CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 19 (64-bit)\n\nOther operating systems may work, but have not been fully tested.\n\nInstalling on Mac\n\n1. Download the installer from our website at www.foundry.com/licensing/tools\n\n2. Run the .dmg installer.\n\n3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the Foundry Licensing Utility. By default, the FLU is installed to the following location:\n\n/Applications/FoundryLicensingUtility\n\nInstalling from the Command Line\n\nTo install the Foundry Licensing Utility from the command line, do the following:\n\n1. Download the installer from our website at www.foundry.com/licensing/tools\n\n2. Open a command-line tool for your operating system. For example, Terminal.\n\n3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the installation file using the cd command. For example, if you saved the installation file in /Users/<user_name>/ use the following command and press Enter:\n\ncd /Users/<user_name>/\n\n4. To mount the .dmg installation file, use the hdiutil attach command. For example:\n\nhdiutil attach FoundryLicensingUtility_<version>.dmg\n\n5. Enter the following command:\n\npushd /Volumes/FoundryLicensingUtility <version>/\n\nThis stores the directory path in memory, so it can be returned to later.\n\n6. Copy the FLU into the /Applications directory:\n\ncp -r FoundryLicensingUtility.app /Applications/\n\n7. Change to the directory stored by the pushd command:\n\npopd\n\n8. Finally, use the following command to eject the mounted disk image:\n\nhdiutil detach /Volumes/FoundryLicensingUtility\n\nInstalling on Windows\n\n1. Download the installer from our website at www.foundry.com/licensing/tools\n\n2. Run the .exe installer.\n\n3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the Foundry Licensing Utility. By default, the FLU is installed to the following locations depending on whether you installed for all users or only the current user:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\FoundryLicensingUtility\n\nOR\n\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\FoundryLicensingUtility\\\n\nInstalling from the Command Line\n\nTo install the Foundry Licensing Utility from the command line, do the following:\n\n1. Download the installer from our website at www.foundry.com/licensing/tools\n\n2. Open a command-line tool for your operating system. For example, Command Prompt.\n\n3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the installation file using the cd command. For example, if you saved the installation file in C:\\Users\\<user_name>\\Downloads\\ use the following command and press Enter:\n\ncd C:\\Users\\<user_name>\\Downloads\\\n\n4. Run the installation file from the current directory. For example:\n\nFoundryLicensingUtility_<version>.exe\n\n5. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.\n\nInstalling on Linux\n\nDownload the installer for your Linux distribution from our website at www.foundry.com/licensing/tools\n\nâ¢ .AppImage - Most distributions, other than CentOS 6.\n\nâ¢ .deb - Debian/Ubuntu based distributions.\n\nâ¢ .rpm - CentOS/RHEL distributions.\n\nNote: If you're running CentOS/RHEL 6, the new FLU will not work due to dependencies on certain libraries. Search CentOS 6 on https://support.foundry.com for more information.\n\nInstalling .AppImage Archives\n\nAppImage bundles are not actually installed, they're downloaded and executed directly.\n\n1. Move the AppImage to permanent file path, such as your home directory. For example:\n\nmv ~/Downloads/FoundryLicensingUtility_<version>.AppImage ~/\n\n2. Add executable permissions to the file using the chmod command:\n\nchmod +x <file path>\n\nFor example:\n\nchmod +x ~/FoundryLicensingUtility_<version>.AppImage\n\n3. Check that the +x permissions are applied to the file using the ls -l command:\n\n[biff@localhost FLU]$ ls -l\n\ntotal 62928\n\n-rwxrwxr-x. 1 biff biff 64435230 May 23 12:11 FoundryLicensingUtility_<version>.AppImage\n\n[biff@localhost FLU]$\n\nNote: Your Linux distribution may handle AppImage files automatically or ask if you want to integrate the application with the desktop environment. This does not affect the normal operation of the FLU.\n\nInstalling .deb Archives\n\nDouble-click the .deb file and follow the onscreen prompts,\n\nOR\n\nOpen the Terminal and enter:\n\nsudo apt-get install <downloaded file>\n\nFor example:\n\nsudo apt-get install /Users/biff/Download/FoundryLicensingUtility_<version>.deb\n\nThe FLU is installed in /opt/FoundryLicensingUtility by default.\n\nInstalling .rpm Archives\n\nOpen the Terminal and enter:\n\nsudo yum localinstall <downloaded file>\n\nFor example:\n\nsudo yum localinstall /Users/biff/Download/FoundryLicensingUtility_<version>.rpm\n\nThe FLU is installed in /opt/FoundryLicensingUtility by default.\n\nLaunching the FLU\n\nMost installation methods create a Desktop icon or menu item to launch the Foundry Licensing Utility, but you can run the app from the command line as well, if you prefer. The location of the launcher is listed by operating system:\n\nâ¢ Mac:\n\n/Applications/FoundryLicensingUtility.app/Contents/MacOS/FoundryLicensingUtility\n\nâ¢ Windows:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\FoundryLicensingUtilty\\FoundryLicensingUtility.exe\n\nOR\n\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\FoundryLicensingUtility\\FoundryLicensingUtility.exe\n\nâ¢ Linux - /opt/FoundryLicensingUtility/foundry-licensing-utility\n\nNote: If you're using an .AppImage, run the file directly from its location on disk. For example, on CentOS 7: /home/<username>/FoundryLicensingUtility_<version>.AppImage\n\nUninstalling the FLU\n\nTo uninstall the Foundry Licensing Tools, follow the steps shown by operating system:\n\nâ¢ On Mac, delete the application file here:\n\n/Applications/FoundryLicensingUtility.app\n\nâ¢ On Windows, run the uninstaller in:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\FoundryLicensingUtilty\\\n\nOR\n\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\FoundryLicensingUtility\\\n\nâ¢ On Linux, run the distribution specific uninstall command from the install directory:\n\nâ¢ AppImage - delete the .AppImage file.\n\nâ¢ .deb\n\nsudo apt remove foundry-licensing-utility\n\nâ¢ .rpm\n\nsudo yum remove foundry-licensing-utility"
