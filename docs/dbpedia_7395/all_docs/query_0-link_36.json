The Lite+ version is free, but all options are available, so you can fully evaluate our product before purchasing. A Single+ License grants you the right to install and use Limagito file mover on a single machine within and used by your organization. A Single+ User License key is generated for a specific hostname (= not transferable). A Site+ License allows you the right to install and use Limagito file mover across multiple machines within and used by your organization at 1 site (physical site or geographic location) of your organization. A Corporate+ License allows you the right to install and use Limagito file mover across multiple machines within and used by your organization at a max. of 5 physical sites or geographic locations of your organization. These licenses cannot be transferred between ‘organizations’.\n\nNone of these File Mover Licenses allows you to redistribute our software or to use our software as “SaaS”. We offer a special Redistribution+ license that allows other “service providers”/”developers”/”integrators” to use our file mover software as “SaaS” or to include with their own products. With this license you can add our file mover within your own product/service either as “SaaS” or “On-Premise” installation.
