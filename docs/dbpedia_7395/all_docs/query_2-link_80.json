        "text": "Until asteri clarified the question, I thought John1024 had the answer. Now it seems that the following will work without the --color option:\n\nls -d $(ls | head -30)\n\nUnfortunately this is too simplistic and will fail if there are blanks in the file names. To take account of that you need the more elaborate:\n\nls -b | head -30 | xargs ls -d\n\nIn both cases the principle is the same: ls | head gets the first 30 files, one per line, which are then presented as an argument list to another ls command, which needs the -d option in case any of the files are directories.\n\nTo get coloring:\n\nls -l --color=always | head -30\n\nNormally, ls produces color only when the output is going directly to a terminal. This is generally a good thing. To override that, use --color=always\n\nThe above produces output with one file per line. If you want, space allowing, more files per line, then try:\n\nls -l | head -30 | column\n\nThe column utility formats its input into multiple columns. The use of color may, however, confuse it."
