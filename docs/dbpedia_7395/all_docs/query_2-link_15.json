        "text": "Update: 2023-04-18 (image added), previously 2021-05-06\n\nThanks to \"Dmitry Jemerov\" from JetBrains/IntelliJ for a update on this old topic.\n\nDmitry says:\n\n\"In 2021.2+ the limit is configurable in\n\nSettings\n\nAdvanced Settings\n\nMaximum number of results to show in Find In Path/Show Usages preview \"\n\nPoint 3) above last I checked was under the headeding \"Find/Replace\"\n\nIntelliJ Settings Screenshot\n\nIf you don't see the above and your version is older then the below might still apply.\n\nUpdate: 2018-08-20\n\nhttps://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-157855\n\nhttps://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206164739--More-than-100-matches-in-search\n\nThanks to \"Andrey Dernov\" from JetBrains/IntelliJ for answer.\n\nAndrey said:\n\nYou can set ide.usages.page.size - IntelliJ Registry option. (Help | Find Action... type Registry and set the value in dialog):\n\nThis has helped me a lot for large project refactoring.\n\nIntelliJ Idea Registry Screenshot\n\nIntelliJ Idea Find in Path Screenshot\n\nEdit: This answer is outdated. You can now set the parameter ide.usages.page.size to increase the number of displayed findings. See RoryGS' answer for details.\n\nOld answer:\n\nCurrently you only have the option to hit the Open in Find Window button (in the bottom right). But there is an open issue for IntelliJ to change this limit: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-16377 https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-157855\n\nMy guess is that you want to see more than 100 matches in the preview so that you can easily skim through the search results, including the context of the lines before and after each occurrence. You can get the same effect, with more than 100 matches, by turning on the Preview Occurrences mode after finding all results by clicking Open in Find Window.\n\nFor anyone wanting to update it outside of the IDE this registry property lives in the file:\n\nYourInstall/options/ide.general.xml\n\nand looks like this:\n\n<application> ... <component name=\"Registry\"> <entry key=\"ide.usages.page.size\" value=\"1001\" /> ... </component> ... </application>\n\n( To clarify, since someone downvoted ... :-D\n\nDoing it outside of the IDE, allows you to create an automatic script that updates this value for all developers on a team or in a company... )"
