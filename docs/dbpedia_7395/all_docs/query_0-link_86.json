        "text": "These release notes describe the changes made in Preps 10.x software. Where applicable, the release notes refer you to additional documents for more information.\n\nThe Preps software is a prepress tool that you use to create press run layouts for bound-work impositions, ganged flat work, and step-and-repeat work. You can work on the fly in an interactive workspace, use stored templates for frequently repeated layouts, and print the production output to common file formats. It also supports varying degrees of workflow automation.\n\nYou can impose PDF input files or unpopulated job pages for sheetfed or web press-run layouts, and packaging label and flexible bag printers, and send the output to any PostScript-compatible device such as a computer-to-plate (CTP) device, imagesetter, on-demand printer, digital printer, wide-format imposition proofer, or laser printer.\n\nSystem requirements\n\nSee Requirements.\n\nIntegrated with the Prinergy Workflow software or Standalone\n\nYour version of Preps 10.x may be integrated and supported with Kodak Prinergy Workflow 10.x. Prinergy Evo 8.2 or later can accept Preps 10.x files. (Note: To run Preps 10.x with a Evo floating license (FLIM) you will need Prinergy Evo 10.x with the Preps 10.x license option.)\n\nPreps 10.x is also available as standalone software.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note PREPS integrated with PRINERGY will use the resources located within the PRINERGY serverâ€™s AraxiPreps folder by default. Using a customized workflow where PREPS is directed to an alternate folder of assets may cause unexpected results. Kodak technical support does not engage in creating or troubleshooting this type of workflow. If the customer creates this type of workflow on their own, they acknowledge and accept the risks associated.\n\nLicenses for Preps 10.x\n\nSee Licensing.\n\nLicenses for Preps 10.x that is integrated with Prinergy Workflow 10.x software\n\nPreps 10.x is automatically installed with the Workshop/Workspace client software when you upgrade your Prinergy Workflow.\n\nUpgrades to Preps 10.x from Preps 6.x or earlier are chargeable for customers who do not have a service contract that includes software upgrades. A Prinergy Workflow or Prinergy Evo license key containing a Preps 10.x license is required in order to upgrade. You must upgrade the Preps software together with your Kodak Prinergy Workflow software. In this case, Kodak Prinergy Workflow version 10.x is required.\n\nIf you are using a floating license, you must upgrade the Preps software together with your Kodak Prinergy Workflow software. In this case, Kodak Prinergy Workflow version 10.x is required to run Preps 10.x.\n\nLicenses for Preps 10.x standalone software\n\nPreps 10.x requires a Preps 10.x license key and can be licensed as a standalone application in two ways, using:\n\nSoftware-based licensing\n\nPrinergy's floating license manager (FLIM)\n\nThe software-based licensing in Preps 10.x replaces the previously used dongle-based licensing. Follow the instructions in the Licensing section to replace your dongle-based license with a software license or to activate your freshly-installed Preps 10.x standalone software.\n\nTo convert a software-based Preps license to a Prinergy floating license, you must upgrade to the minimum version supported by Prinergy before converting the license. Floating licenses provide additional flexibility by allowing a seamless transfer of licenses between workstations."
