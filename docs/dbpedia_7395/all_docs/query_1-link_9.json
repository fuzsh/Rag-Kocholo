Replay operators or media managers need to be able to not only import last minute content but also to import content coming from other shows. To facilitate this, EVS has been increasing the codec compatibility. This way, EVS solutions can be easily integrated with each other as well as with other 3rd party systems and post-production tools.\n\nWhat has always been important for EVS is maintaining the clip metadata and the superslomo frames which you want to use for the next show and which you'd like to keep with your archived media.\n\nFor Multicamera recording, XFile3 allows real-time streaming of all camera angles from the server to your storage using an intuitive user interface and including crash-record capabilities and time-based scheduling of these streams."
