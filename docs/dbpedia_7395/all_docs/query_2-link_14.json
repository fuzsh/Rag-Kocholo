        "text": "In the Microsoft Defender Portal, under Cloud Apps, go to Policies -> Policy management. Select the Information Protection tab.\n\nSelect Create policy and select File policy.\n\nGive your policy a name and description, if you want you can base it on a template, for more information on policy templates, see Control cloud apps with policies.\n\nGive your policy a Policy severity. If you have set Defender for Cloud Apps to send you notifications on policy matches for a specific policy severity level, this level is used to determine whether the policy's matches trigger a notification.\n\nWithin Category, link the policy to the most appropriate risk type. This field is informative only and helps you search for specific policies and alerts later, based on risk type. The risk may already be preselected according to the category for which you chose to create the policy. By default, File policies are set to DLP.\n\nCreate a filter for the files this policy will act on to set which discovered apps trigger this policy. Narrow down the policy filters until you reach an accurate set of files you wish to act upon. Be as restrictive as possible to avoid false positives. For example, if you wish to remove public permissions, remember to add the Public filter, if you wish to remove an external user, use the \"External\" filter and so on.\n\nNote\n\nWhen using the policy filters, Contains searches only for full words â separated by commas, dots, spaces, or underscores. For example if you search for malware or virus, it finds virus_malware_file.exe but it does not find malwarevirusfile.exe. If you search for malware.exe, then you find ALL files with either malware or exe in their filename, whereas if you search for \"malware.exe\" (with the quotation marks) you find only files that contain exactly \"malware.exe\". Equals searches only for the complete string, for example if you search for malware.exe it finds malware.exe but not malware.exe.txt.\n\nFor more information about File Policy Filters, see File filters in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.\n\nUnder the first Apply to filter, select all files excluding selected folders or selected folders for Box, SharePoint, Dropbox, or OneDrive, where you can enforce your file policy over all files on the app or on specific folders. You're redirected to sign in the cloud app, and then add the relevant folders.\n\nUnder the second Apply to filter, select either all file owners, file owners from selected user groups or all file owners excluding selected groups. Then select the relevant user groups to determine which users and groups should be included in the policy.\n\nSelect the Content inspection method. You can select either Built-in DLP or Data Classification Services. We recommend using Data Classification Services.\n\nOnce content inspection is enabled, you can choose to use preset expressions or to search for other customized expressions.\n\nIn addition, you can specify a regular expression to exclude a file from the results. This option is highly useful if you have an inner classification keyword standard that you want to exclude from the policy.\n\nYou can decide set the minimum number of content violations that you want to match before the file is considered a violation. For example, you can choose 10 if you want to be alerted on files with at least 10 credit card numbers found within its content.\n\nWhen content is matched against the selected expression, the violation text is replaced with \"X\" characters. By default, violations are masked and shown in their context displaying 100 characters before and after the violation. Numbers in the context of the expression are replaced with \"#\" characters and are never stored within Defender for Cloud Apps. You can select the option to Unmask the last four characters of a violation to unmask the last four characters of the violation itself. It's necessary to set which data types the regular expression searches: content, metadata and/or file name. By default it searches the content and the metadata.\n\nChoose the Governance actions you want Defender for Cloud Apps to take when a match is detected.\n\nOnce you've created your policy, you can view it by filtering for the File policy type. You can always edit a policy, calibrate its filters, or change the automated actions. The policy is automatically enabled upon creation and starts scanning your cloud files immediately. Take extra care when you set governance actions, they could lead to irreversible loss of access permissions to your files. It's recommended to narrow down the filters to exactly represent the files that you wish to act upon, using multiple search fields. The narrower the filters, the better. For guidance, you can use the Edit and preview results button next to the filters.\n\nTo view file policy matches, files that are suspected to violate the policy, go to Policies -> Policy management. Filter the results to display only the file policies using the Type filter at the top. For more information about the matches for each policy, under the Count column, select the number of matches for a policy. Alternatively, select the three dots at the end of the row for a policy and choose View all matches. This opens the File policy report. Select the Matching now tab to see files that currently match the policy. Select the History tab to see a history back to up to six months of files that matched the policy."
