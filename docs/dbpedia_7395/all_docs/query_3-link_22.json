        "text": "Abandonment may be either of the invention or of a patent application. An abandoned patent application, in accordance with 37 CFR 1.135 and 1.138, is one which is removed from the office docket of pending applications. A patent application becomes abandoned for failure to file a complete and proper reply as the condition of the application may require within the time period provided under 37 CFR 1.134 and 1.136 unless an office action indicates otherwise.\n\n-- see MPEP 711\n\n-- see express abandonment\n\nThe Automated Interview Request (AIR) form is a way for applicants to schedule an interview using the Internet, e.g., an alternative to leaving an examiner voicemail to schedule an interview. After the form is submitted, the examiner will respond to confirm the request or propose a new date/time. The examiner may request additional information, e.g., requesting an agenda if one is not provided. The AIR form links to form SB/0439 which can be used for internet authorization.\n\nYou can find the AIR form on USPTO.gov by typing “AIR form” in the search box or by clicking on “Complete the form” on the external interview practice website.\n\nAn applicant’s written submission that they're using their trademark in commerce with specified goods or services, which is required for intent-to-use applications. Among other requirements, it must include a specimen showing actual use of the trademark in commerce for each class of goods or services. It's filed as either an Amendment to Allege Use (AAU) or a Statement of Use (SOU), depending on when it's submitted.\n\nAn applicant’s written submission that they're using their trademark in commerce with specified goods or services, submitted before approval for publication. This is a form of allegation of use, which is required in intent-to-use applications. Among other requirements, it must include a specimen showing actual use of the trademark in commerce for each class of goods or services.\n\nAn applicant for a patent application, reissue application, or reexamination proceeding dissatisfied with the primary examiner’s second adverse decision or final rejection may appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) for review of the examiner’s rejection. An appeal will be entered upon filing a notice of appeal, a brief in support of an appeal, and paying the fees as set forth in MPEP 1204 within the time as set forth by 37 CFR 1.134.\n\n-- see PTAB\n\n-- see MPEP 1200\n\nInventor or all of the joint inventors, or the persons who are applying for a patent as provided for in 37 CFR 1.43, 1.45 or 1.46 .\n\n-- see 37 CFR 1.42 and MPEP 602.08 and 605.01\n\n-- see MPEP 605.02 for information regarding the applicant in applications filed before September 16, 2012. For the applicant in an international application see MPEP 1806. For the applicant in an international design application see MPEP 2920.02.\n\nThe Contracting Party or one of the Contracting Parties from which the applicant derives its entitlement to file an international design application under the Hague Agreement by virtue of satisfying, in relation to that Contracting Party, at least one of the conditions specified in Article 3 of the Hague Agreement (nationality, domicile, habitual residence, or a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment). Where there are two or more Contracting Parties from which the applicant may, under Article 3, derive its entitlement to file an international design application, \"applicant's Contracting Party\" means the one which, among those Contracting Parties, is indicated as such in the international design application.\n\n--see Appendix T Rule 18.1\n\nA sheet or set of sheets containing bibliographic data, which is arranged in a format specified by the office. An ADS must comply with the requirements of 37 CFR 1.76.\n\n--see 37 CFR 1.76 and MPEP 601.05 and form PTO/AIA/14 available on the PTO forms page\n\n--for applications filed before September 16, 2012 see MPEP 601.05(b)\n\nIn general, the act of transferring to another the ownership of one’s property, i.e., the interest and rights to the property. In 37 CFR 3.1, assignment of patent rights is defined as “a transfer by a party of all or part of its right, title and interest in a patent [or] patent application....” An assignment of a patent, or patent application, is the transfer to another of a party’s entire ownership interest or a percentage of that party’s ownership interest in the patent or application.\n\nFor an assignment to take place, the transfer to another must include the entirety of the bundle of rights that is associated with the ownership interest, i.e., all of the bundle of rights that are inherent in the right, title, and interest in the patent or patent application. Use Assignment Center to record all assignments with the USPTO’s Assignment Recordation Branch and maintain a clear title to pending patent applications and patents.\n\n-- see Patent Assignments: Change and search ownership\n\n-- see Assignments on the Web (AOTW)\n\n-- see also Assignment Recordation Branch (ARB)\n\n-- see MPEP 300\n\nBoolean logic (named for the British-born Irish mathematician George Boole) express relationships in logic arguments using the following three operators: \"and\", \"or\", \"not\".\n\nThe patent search systems use \"AND\", \"OR\", and \"ANDNOT\" as Boolean operators, in combination with parentheses to build nested logical subsets - example: needle ANDNOT ((record AND player) OR sewing), which would return anything with the word \"needle\" in a document as long as it does not also contain the word \"record\" and \"player\" in the same document or the word \"sewing\" in the same document. It also uses some symbols such as \"->\" to indicate a range, where you enter the field code and start date, ->, and then the end date - example: ISD/1/1/1995->2/14/1995.\n\n-- see help for patent searches for more information on how to use Boolean operators in a patent search\n\nA certificate for each piece of correspondence mailed used to determine whether the correspondence was deposited within the filing period, on or prior to the expiration of the set period of time for response, stating the date of deposit with the U.S. Postal Service, transmitted by facsimile or transmitted via the USPTO electronic filing system Patent Center and including a signature. If the date stated is within the period for reply, the reply in most instances will be considered to be timely. This is true even if the paper does not actually reach the office until after the end of the period for reply. The certificate of mailing procedure may not be used for certain filings described in 37 CFR 1.8(a)(2) or when sending mail to the USPTO from a foreign country.\n\n-- see MPEP 512 and 37 CFR 1.8\n\nThe first phase under the Patent Cooperation Treaty that includes performance of an international-type search and issuance of an international search report and written opinion by the International Searching Authority, and publication of the international application and international search report by the International Bureau of WIPO. The content of the written opinion is made available by the International Bureau to the designated offices in the form of an International Preliminary Report on Patentability (Chapter I) after the expiration of 30 months from the priority date, unless it is superseded by the issuance of an International Preliminary Report on Patentability (Chapter II).\n\nDefines the invention for which patent protection is sought. The specification must conclude with a claim particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention or discovery. The claim or claims must conform to the invention as set forth in the remainder of the specification and the terms and phrases used in the claims must find clear support or antecedent basis in the description so that the meaning of the terms in the claims may be clearly understood by reference to the description. (See 37 CFR 1.75).\n\n-- see MPEP 608.01(i)\n\nAn inventor who is named with at least one other inventor in a patent application, wherein each inventor contributes to the conception (creation) of the invention set forth in at least one claim in a patent application.\n\n-- see MPEP 602.09 and 2137.01 and 37 CFR 1.45\n\n-- see also joint application andjoint inventor\n\nA four-digit number that is assigned to each newly filed patent application. The confirmation number, in combination with the application number, is used to verify the accuracy of the application number placed on correspondence filed with the office to avoid misidentification of an application due to a transposition error (misplaced digits) in the application number. The office recommends that applicants include the application's confirmation number (in addition to the application number) on all correspondence submitted to the office concerning the application.\n\n-- see MPEP 503\n\nA trademark that’s similar to yours, and that is used with goods or services that are related to your goods or services. When two or more trademarks that conflict with each other are in use in commerce, it can cause confusion because consumers may not be able to determine the source of the goods or services.\n\nA transitional phrase that limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or steps and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed invention.\n\nFor the purposes of searching for and applying prior art under 35 USC 102 and 103, absent (without) a clear indication in the specification or claims of what the basic and novel characteristics actually are, \"consisting essentially of\" will be construed (understood) as equivalent to \"comprising.\"\n\n-- see transitional phrase\n\n-- see MPEP 2111.03 for more information\n\nProtect works of authorship, such as writings, music, and works of art that have been tangibly expressed. Copyrights may be federally registered with the Library of Congress through the U.S. Copyright Office.\n\n-- see Copyright policy\n\nThere is an area of overlap between copyright and design patent statutes where the author/inventor can secure both a copyright and a design patent. Thus, an ornamental design may be copyrighted as a work of art and may also be subject matter of a design patent.\n\n-- see MPEP 1512\n\nAs a work of the United States government, this glossary falls under the provisions of 17 USC 403, which requires that works including all or part of this material in a copyrighted work contain a statement in their copyright that clearly identifies what portions of the work consist of a work of the U.S. government. Failure to do so could result in loss of copyright protection for the entire work.\n\n-- see Editorial Standards\n\n(Previously referred to as \"payor number.\") A number assigned by the office that is used to correlate all filings and correspondence simplifying the submission of an address change, to appoint a practitioner, or to designate the fee address for a patent. Customer numbers are primarily used by attorneys and law firms, and must be requested using the \"Request for Customer Number\" form (PTO/SB/125) or \"Request for Customer Number Data Change\" form (PTO/SB/124).\n\n-- see 37 CFR 1.33(a), 1.76 and MPEP 403\n\nA trademark application or registration that is no longer active, so it can’t be used to bar another pending trademark application from federal registration. The trademarks in dead applications or registrations may still be in use in commerce, and the owner may have common law rights. In some cases, the application or registration can be revived or reinstated, making them \"live\" again.\n\nA named inventor who has died prior to the filing of a patent application or during the prosecution of a patent application.\n\nFor information regarding applications for patent filed on or after September 16, 2012 on behalf of a deceased or legally incapacitated inventor, see MPEP 409.01(a). For information regarding applications for patent filed on or after September 16, 2012 where the inventor or at least one joint inventor is unavailable, see MPEP 409.02, 604, and 605.\n\n-- see 35 USC 117, 37 CFR 1.43\n\nFor information regarding applications for patent filed before September 16, 2012 on behalf of a deceased inventor or legally incapacitated inventor, see MPEP 409.01(b). For information regarding applications for patent filed before September 16, 2012 where at least one inventor is unavailable, see MPEP 409.03 – 409.03(j).\n\n-- see 35 USC 117 and pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.42 and 1.43\n\nThe Contracting States or Contracting Parties for which protection of an invention is sought in an international application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) or in an international design application filed under the Hague Agreement. The filing of a Request in an international PCT application constitutes the designation of all Contracting States bound by the PCT on the international filing date. In an international design application filed under the Hague Agreement, Contracting Parties for which protection is sought must be indicated in the official application form (Form DM/1).\n\n--see Request\n\n--see Form DM/1\n\n-- see 37 CFR 1.432\n\n-- see MPEP 1821\n\nA patentee, whether of the whole or any sectional interest therein, may, on payment of the fee required by law, make disclaimer (giving up all or part of the owner's rights to enforce claims) of any complete claim(s), stating therein the extent of their interest in such patent. Such disclaimers are required to be in writing and recorded in the USPTO, and are considered as part of the original patent to the extent of the interest actually possessed by the disclaimant and by those claiming under him. Any patentee or applicant may disclaim or dedicate to the public the entire term, or any terminal part of the term (from a certain point in time through the projected end of the entire term), of the patent granted or to be granted. There are two types of disclaimers: a statutory disclaimer and a terminal disclaimer.\n\n-- see MPEP 1490\n\ndata reference model - also known as a \"data and information reference model\" - describes the data and information that support program and line operations. Helps describe the types of interactions that occur between the Federal Government and others. Purpose of a DRM is to establish a commonly understood classification for Federal data that will lead to the identification of duplicative data resources.\n\n-- see Federal Enterprise Architecture for more\n\nAt any time during the enforceability of a patent any person may file a request for the USPTO to conduct a second examination of any claim of the patent on the basis of prior art patents or printed publications which that person states to be pertinent and applicable to the patent and believes to have a bearing on the patentability (see 37 CFR 1.501). In order for the request for reexamination to be granted, a substantial new question of patentability must be present with regard to at least one patent claim. The request must be in writing and must be accompanied by payment of a reexamination request filing fee as set forth in 37 CFR 1.20(c).\n\n-- see MPEP 2200, 37 CFR 1.501-1.570\n\n-- see also Reexamination Proceeding\n\nA patent that is no longer in force due to the termination of its patent term or for failure to timely pay a maintenance fee. If the most recent maintenance fee due has not been paid and the 'payment window closing date' has passed, the patent is considered expired as of that 'closing date,' with the exception of certain cases where a petition and fee have been filed (recorded in the File History/Transaction History). If a petition has been filed and 'granted,' the patent remains intact but the maintenance fee statement will not be viewable because the fee was paid with the petition fee.\n\n-- see fees and payment\n\n-- see Patent Term Calculator\n\nA patent application may be expressly abandoned by filing a written declaration of abandonment identifying the application signed by an authorized party under 37 CFR 1.33(b)(1) or (b)(3) in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Express abandonment becomes effective when an appropriate official of the office takes action thereon. Express abandonment of the application may not be recognized by the USPTO before the date of issue or publication unless it is actually received by appropriate officials in time to act.\n\n-- see MPEP 711.01\n\n-- see also abandonment\n\nFinal Data Capture. When the issue fee is paid and all other requirements have been met (e.g., drawings) for issuance as a patent, the application is then electronically exported to the Final Data Capture (FDC) stage. The FDC makes any updates necessary to the electronic file and places the allowed patent application in issue. The average time that an allowed application is in the FDC process is five weeks (two weeks of processing time for assignment of issue date). The \"Issue Notification\" is mailed approximately three weeks prior to the issue date of the patent.\n\n-- see MPEP 1309\n\nFor non-provisional and provisional applications after December 18, 2013, the date of receipt in the office of an application which includes a specification with or without claims. For design applications, except for a continued prosecution application (CPA), after December 18, 2013, the date of receipt in the office of an application which includes at least one claim, and any required drawings.\n\nFor non-provisional applications, except continued prosecution applications, before December 18, 2013, the date of receipt in the office of an application which includes a specification containing a description, at least one claim, and any required drawings. For provisional applications, before December 18, 2013, the date of receipt in the office of an application which includes a specification and any required drawings.\n\nFor continued prosecution applications (CPA), the date of receipt in the office of a request on a separate paper for an application under 37 CFR 1.53(d).\n\n-- see MPEP 506 and 601.01\n\n-- see 37 CFR 1.53\n\nA correspondence mailed to the attorney or agent, if any, otherwise to the applicant, at the correspondence address of record for each application filed which meets the minimum requirements to receive a filing date. The filing receipt includes the application number, filing date, a confirmation number, a suggested class in the U.S. Patent Classification System, and the number of an art unit where the application is likely to be examined. The filing receipt also includes other information about the application as applicable, such as continuing data, national stage data, foreign priority data, foreign filing license data, entity status information, and the date the office anticipates publishing the application.\n\n-- see MPEP 503\n\nAn office action on the second or any subsequent examination or consideration by an examiner that is intended to close the prosecution of a non-provisional patent application.\n\n-- see MPEP 706.07(b) for when a final rejection is proper on a first office action\n\nApplicant's reply under 37 CFR 1.113 to a final rejection is limited either to an appeal in the case of rejection of any claim to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (37 CFR 1.191) or to an amendment complying with the requirements set forth in the office action (37 CFR 1.114 or 1.116). Reply to a final rejection must comply with 37 CFR 1.114 or include cancellation of, or appeal from the rejection of, each rejected claim. If any claim stands allowed, the reply to a final rejection must comply with any requirements or objections as to form (37 CFR 1.113(c)).\n\n-- see MPEP 706.07\n\n-- see Responding to office Actions\n\nUnder certain conditions and on fulfilling certain requirements, an application for patent filed in the United States may be entitled to the benefit of the filing date of a prior application filed in a foreign country. The prior application must be a prior foreign application, a prior international (PCT) application designating at least one country other than the United States, or a prior international design application designating at least one country other than the United States.\n\n-- see 35 USC 119(a)-(d) and (f), 172 , 365(a) and (b) , 386(a) and (b) , 37 CFR 1.55 , and MPEP 213\n\nInitial Data Capture - the first phase of the publication process for a patent where the patent file is electronically captured. It takes approximately six weeks from the date that the allowed file is received for the completion of the Initial Data Capture of the application. The application is then sent to the File Maintenance Facility (FMF) for matching of the issue fee and any other correspondence. The application may stay in the FMF for approximately one to two weeks. However, if all requirements are not yet fulfilled the application will remain at the FMF until the requirements are met. Once all files are matched, the application will move to the FDC.\n\nAs an electronic message concerning the allowed application is received in the Office of Data Management, immediately after the Notice of Allowance has been mailed. The application is then electronically exported to Initial Data Capture (IDC) for electronic capture of the patent filed. This process takes approximately six weeks. Upon IDC completion, an electronic message is then sent to the File Maintenance Facility to ensure that all post allowance correspondence, fees and drawings have been updated. The application may stay in FMF for one to two weeks or until all post-allowance requirements are met.\n\nAn electronic system for storage and maintenance of records associated with patent applications. All applications are electronically scanned and loaded into the image file wrapper system upon filing. The image file wrapper contains a complete record of proceedings in the USPTO. The image file wrapper of a patent application that is maintained by the office is the electronic file and is the \"official record” of that application. The IFW, if available, is accessible through Patent Center.\n\n-- see MPEP 719\n\n--see electronic file\n\nA list of all patents, publications, U.S. applications, or other information submitted for consideration by the office in a non-provisional patent application to comply with the duty to disclose to the office information which is material to patentability of the invention claimed in the non-provisional application.\n\nFor non-provisional patent applications, individuals associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application have a duty to disclose to the office all information known to that individual to be material to patentability as defined in 37 CFR 1.56. The provisions of 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98 provide a mechanism for compliance with the duty of disclosure provided in 37 CFR 1.56.\n\nThe IDS must include a list of all patents, publications, U.S. applications, or other information submitted for consideration by the office. The USPTO provides forms for use in the submission of an IDS, the PTO/SB/08a, PTO/SB/08b, and SB08a – Patent Center.\n\n-- see 37 CFR 1.56, 1.97 and 1.98and MPEP 609\n\nLegal basis you can use to file a trademark application if you haven't started using your trademark in commerce but have a bona fide intention to do so. Your trademark cannot actually be registered until you show that you’ve started using it in commerce and file the proper TEAS form. This filing basis is also called Section 1(b).\n\nThe inter partes reexamination statute and rules permit any third party requester to request, prior to September 16, 2012, inter partes reexamination of a patent which issued from an original application filed on or after November 29, 1999, where the request satisfies certain requirements (see 37 CFR 1.915(b)) and is accompanied by the appropriate fee.\n\n-- see reexamination proceeding\n\nInter partes reexamination practice primarily differs from ex parte practice in that the third party requestor may file written comments addressing issues raised by the patent owner in a response to office action.\n\n-- see 35 USC 311 and 37 CFR 1.902-1.997 and MPEP 2609\n\nThe unique number assigned to a patent application when it is filed, consisting of a three-letter code PCT, a slant, the two letter code of the receiving office, a four digit year indicating the year in which the papers were first received, a slant, and a six digit serial number. (e.g., PCT/SE2004/000001”).\n\n--see WIPO Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation for a code list\n\nA preliminary, non-binding report on whether the claimed invention appears to be patentable. It is issued by the International Bureau on behalf of the International Searching Authority under Chapter I of the PCT where an international preliminary examination report has not been or will not be established. The report has essentially the same contents as the written opinion of the International Searching Authority.\n\nInternational Preliminary Examination Report (Form PCT/IPEA/409) - produced by an International Preliminary Examining Authority, is a preliminary and non-binding opinion on whether the invention claimed in an international application appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step (to be non-obvious), and to be industrially applicable. As of 1 January 2004, this report is also known as the “international preliminary report on patentability (Chapter II of the PCT).”\n\nAn application in which the invention is presented as that of two or more persons.\n\n(AIA) If multiple inventors are named in a non-provisional application, each named inventor must have made a contribution, individually or jointly, to the subject matter of at least one claim of the application and the application will be considered to be a joint application under 35 USC 116. If multiple inventors are named in a provisional application, each named inventor must have made a contribution, individually or jointly, to the subject matter disclosed in the provisional application and the provisional application will be considered to be a joint application under 35 USC 116.\n\n(Pre-AIA) If multiple inventors are named in a non-provisional application, each named inventor must have made a contribution, individually or jointly, to the subject matter of at least one claim of the application and the application will be considered to be a joint application under 35 USC 116(pre-AIA). If multiple inventors are named in a provisional application, each named inventor must have made a contribution, individually or jointly, to the subject matter disclosed in the provisional application and the provisional application will be considered to be a joint application under 35 USC 116(pre-AIA).\n\n-- see MPEP 602.09; also joint inventor\n\nJPG file type extension or JPEG - \"Joint Photographic Experts Group\" - is one of several digital image formats that are viewable in web browsers. JPEG image files are encoded using a standard for file compression (making the files smaller) that preserves essential color and display information in a fairly photorealistic way, with smooth edges, shapes and color blends. JPEG files are generally preferred for displaying still image photographs in digital form. The JPEG format is \"lossy,\" meaning some information is lost when an image is compressed. This accounts for the \"fuzziness\" and patchy color areas what you may see when lower resolution JPEG images are enlarged to fill a space on the screen.\n\nWIPO Standard ST. 16 codes (kind codes) include a letter, and in many cases a number, used to distinguish the kind of patent document (e.g., publication of an application for a utility patent (patent application publication), patent, plant patent application publication, plant patent, or design patent) and the level of publication (e.g., first publication, second publication, or corrected publication).\n\n-- see USPTO kind codes\n\nDetailed information on Standard ST. 16 and the use of kind codes by patent offices throughout the world is available on the WIPO website.\n\nGrounds to refuse to register the trademark in your application when it conflicts with a similar trademark that's registered for goods or services related to yours. If both trademarks were in use in commerce at the same time, it would likely cause confusion for consumers, who may not be able to determine the source of the goods or services.\n\nA series of related images, however fixed or encoded — (1) having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product; and (2) in which series the relation of the images to one another is that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product.\n\n-- see MPEP Appendix R, SUBCHAPTER C, PROTECTION OF FOREIGN MASK WORKS PART 150\n\nAn office action made by the examiner where the applicant is entitled to reply and request reconsideration and/or further examination, with or without making an amendment.\n\nOn taking up an application for examination or a patent in a reexamination proceeding, the examiner is required to make a thorough study of the application and of the available prior art relating to the subject matter of the claimed invention. This examination must be complete with respect to:\n\ncompliance of the application or patent under reexamination with the applicable statutes and rules\n\nthe patentability of the invention as claimed\n\nmatters of form, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n-- see MPEP 706; 37 CFR 1.104\n\n-- see Responding to office actions\n\nFor purposes of small entity determination per MPEP 509.02 - (1) a university or other institution of higher education located in any country; (2) an organization of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 USC 501(c)(3)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 USC 501(a)); (3) any nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified under a nonprofit organization statute of a state of this country (35 USC 201(i)); or (4) any nonprofit organization located in a foreign country which would qualify as a nonprofit organization under paragraphs (e) (2) or (3) of MPEP 509.02 if it were located in this country.\n\nA non-provisional application is either a U.S. national application for patent which was filed in the office under 35 USC 111(a), an international application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty in which the basic national fee under 35 USC 41(a)(1)(F) has been paid, or an international design application filed under the Hague Agreement in which the office has received a copy of the international registration pursuant to Article 10 of the Hague Agreement. An application for patent filed under 35 USC 111(a) includes utility, design, plant, and reissue applications but does not include provisional applications. Non-provisional applications satisfying the applicable requirements will be examined in due course. A non-provisional utility patent application includes a specification, including a claim or claims; drawings, when necessary; an oath or declaration; and the prescribed filing fee.\n\n-- read the Patent basics section for guides for each type of patent application\n\nWritten notice from the USPTO that an applicant's Statement of Use is due within six months, and that they may request to extend the deadline if they need more time to show proper use of their trademark in commerce with the goods or services in the application. Notices of Allowance are only sent to applicants who filed their application based on intent to use in commerce.\n\nA correspondence sent to an applicant for patent if, on examination, it appears that the applicant is entitled to a patent under the law. Such correspondence shall specify a sum constituting the issue fee and any required publication fee which, both of which must be paid within three months from the mail-date of the notice of allowance to avoid abandonment.\n\n-- see MPEP 1303 and 37 CFR 1.311\n\nA notification sent by an office of a designated Contracting Party in an international design application refusing the effects of international registration, in whole or in part, in the territory of that Contracting Party, where the conditions for the grant of protection under the law of that Contracting Party are not met in respect of any or all of the designs that are the subject of an international registration.\n\nAn oath or declaration under 35 USC 115. An oath or declaration must be filed in each application for patent (other than a provisional application).\n\nAIA: for applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, an oath or declaration which includes the new statutory statements:\n\nThe application was made or authorized to be made by the person executing the declaration,\n\nThe individual believes himself or herself to be the original inventor or an original joint inventor of a claimed invention in the application, and\n\nAn acknowledgment of penalties clause referring to fine or imprisonment of not more than five years, or both.\n\nPre-AIA: for applications filed before September 16, 2012, an oath or declaration which an applicant for patent (1) states that he or she is the original or sole inventor, (2) states his or her citizenship, (3) states that he or she has reviewed and understands the contents of the specification and claims which the oath or declaration refers to, and (4) acknowledges the duty to disclose information that is material to patentability as defined by 37 CFR 1.56.\n\n-- see 35 USC 115; 37 CFR 1.63, 1.64 and 1.66; MPEP 602 and form AIA/01 (for applications filed on or after September 16, 2012 and form PTO/SB/01 (for applications filed before September 16, 2012)\n\n-- see AIA inventor’s Oath or Declaration Quick Reference Guide\n\n-- see also substitute statement\n\n-the government trademark office in a country that is a member of the Madrid Protocol.\n\nFor applicants who file for an extension of protection of an international registration to the United States under Trademark Act Section 66(a), the country of the office of origin is where the applicant is a national, domiciliary, or has a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment.\n\n-- see Madrid Protocol\n\nPublic Advisory Committee\n\nThe Public Advisory Committees for the USPTO were created by statute in the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999 to advise the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO on the management of the patent and the trademark operations. The Public Advisory Committees consist of citizens of the United States chosen to represent the interests of the diverse users of the USPTO. The Public Advisory Committees review the policies, goals, performance, budget, and user fees of the patent and trademark operations, respectively, and advise the Director on these matters. Appointments to the Public Advisory Committees are made by the Secretary of Commerce.\n\nA property right granted by the government of the United States of America to an inventor \"to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention throughout the United States or importing the invention into the United States\" for a limited time in exchange for public disclosure of the invention when the patent is granted.\n\n-- see also design patent, non-provisional patent application, plant patent, provisional patent application, reexamination proceedings, reissue application, utility patent\n\nA library designated by the USPTO to receive copies of patents, CD-ROMs containing registered and pending marks, and patent and trademark materials that are made available to the public for free. As of October 1st, 2011 these libraries have been renamed and are referred to as Patent and Trademark Resource Centers (PTRCs). The term \"PDTL\" is no longer used.\n\n-- see PTRC for a list of locations\n\nA phrase that often appears on manufactured items. It means that someone has applied for a patent on an invention that is contained in the manufactured item. It serves as a warning that a patent may issue that would cover the item and that copiers should be careful because they might infringe if the patent issues. Once the patent issues, the patent owner will stop using the phrase \"patent pending\" and start using a phrase such as \"covered by U.S. Patent Number XXXXXXX.\" Applying the patent pending phrase to an item when no patent application has been made can result in a fine.\n\nFor purposes of small entity determination per MPEP 509.02, a person is defined as any inventor or other individual (e.g., an individual to whom an inventor has transferred some rights in the invention), who has not assigned, granted conveyed, or licensed, and is under no obligation under contract or law to assign, grant, convey, or license any rights in the invention.\n\n-- see 37 CFR 1.27(a) and MPEP 509.02\n\nReviews and decides petitions, requests, and related inquiries, regarding the filing of patent applications, revival of abandoned applications, reinstatement of expired patents, withdrawal of patent applications from issue, small entity entitlement, review of previous decisions of the Technology Centers, suspension of regulations, and questions not specifically provided for by regulations. The Office of Petitions also manages the Inventor Assistance Center (IAC). THE IAC provides patent information and services to the public. The IAC is staffed by former Supervisory Patent Examiners and experienced Primary Examiners who answer general questions concerning patent examining policy and procedure.\n\n-- see MPEP 711.03 and Petitions Practice within the USPTO on Patent Matters\n\nA procedure for expedited review of a utility or plant patent application for an additional fee. The USPTO’s goal for prioritized examination is to provide a final disposition within twelve months of prioritized status being granted. The rule applicable to prioritized examination is 37 CFR 1.102(e). Prioritized examination of newly filed applications is also known as “Track One” or “Track I.” Prioritized examination will not be accorded to design applications, reissue applications, provisional applications, international applications that have not entered the national stage under 35 USC 371, or reexamination proceedings. For expedited examination of design applications see Expedited Examination of design applications.\n\n--see USPTO's Prioritized Patent Examination Program\n\n--see also MPEP 708.02(b) and form AIA/424 available on the PTO forms page\n\nLegal basis you can use to file a U.S. trademark application if you've filed an application in a foreign country within the last six months. Both applications must be for the same trademark with the same goods or services. This filing basis gives your U.S. application the same effective filing date as your foreign application. It's also called Section 44(d).\n\n-See TMEP section 1001\n\nPatent and Trademark Office Society\n\nThe Patent and Trademark Office Society is for Patent and Trademark professionals and other interested individuals. Founded in 1917, the Society is today internationally recognized for its activities in the patent and trademark fields. From its inception, the Society has actively influenced the patent and trademark systems - promoting the systems' growth and well-being, recalling our rich heritage and promoting the social and intellectual welfare of our members.\n\nPatent and Trademark Resource Centers are libraries designated by the USPTO to receive copies of patents, CD-ROMs containing registered and pending marks, and patent and trademark materials that are made available to the public for free. Prior to October 1st, 2011 these libraries were referred to as Patent and Trademark Deposit Libraries (PDTLs). The term \"PDTL\" is no longer used.\n\n-- see PTRC program\n\nAt any time during the enforceability of a patent any person may file a request for the USPTO to conduct a second examination of any claim of the patent on the basis of prior art patents or printed publications which that person states to be pertinent and applicable to the patent and believes to have a bearing on the patentability (see 37 CFR 1.501). In order for the request for reexamination to be granted, a substantial new question of patentability must be present with regard to at least one patent claim. The request must be in writing and must be accompanied by payment of a reexamination request filing fee as set forth in 37 CFR 1.20(c).\n\n-- see 37 USC 302, 37 CFR 1.510 and MPEP 2209, et seq.\n\nA registered patent attorney/agent is assigned a registration number that they must include on patent correspondence and forms when representing others before the USPTO; individual applicants do not have a registration number and should leave this field blank on patent forms.\n\n-- see the searchable online Patent Attorney Agent Roster to locate registered patent attorneys and agents\n\nThe request (Form PCT/RO/101) is the part of the international application that contains a petition for the international application to be processed according to the Patent Cooperation Treaty and which also contains certain indications relating to designated States in which protection is sought, the invention, applicant(s), inventor(s), and any agent.\n\nIf two or more independent and distinct inventions are claimed in a single application, the examiner may require the applicant to elect (designate) a single invention to which the claims will be restricted (limited to). This requirement is known as a requirement for restriction (also known as a requirement for division). Such requirement will normally be made before any action on the merits; however, it may be made at any time before final action (final rejection).\n\n-- see 37 CFR 1.141 and 1.142\n\nIn the examination of an application for patent, an examiner must conduct a thorough search of the prior art. The examiner, after having obtained a thorough understanding of the invention disclosed and claimed in the non-provisional application, then searches the prior art as disclosed in patents and other published documents, i.e., non-patent literature (NPL). An inventor name search is also performed to identify other applications and/or patents which may be applicable as references for double patenting rejections. A proper search normally includes both a textual search and a classification search. Inventors are encouraged to search the USPTO's patent database to see if a patent has already been filed or granted that is similar to your patent. Patents may be searched in the Patent Public Search tool, which houses full text for patents issued from 1976 to present and images for all parents, 1790 to present. The USPTO houses full text for patents issued from 1976 to present and PDF images for all patents from 1790 to present.\n\n-- see Search for patents\n\n-- see MPEP 904-904.03\n\nStatutory Invention Registration - a published statutory invention registration contains the specification and drawings of a regularly filed non-provisional application for a patent without examination if the applicant: (1) meets the requirements of section 112 of this title; (2) has complied with the requirements for printing, as set forth in regulations of the Commissioner; (3) waives the right to receive a patent on the invention within such period as may be prescribed by the Commissioner; and (4) pays application, publication, and other processing fees established by the Commissioner. A request for a statutory invention registration (SIR) may be filed at the time of filing a non-provisional application for patent, or may be filed later during pendency of the non-provisional application.\n\n-- see MPEP 1100\n\nA written description of the claimed invention and the manner and process of making and using the claimed invention. The specification is required to be in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which the invention or discovery appertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the claimed invention. The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention.\n\n-- see 35 U.S.C. 112 and MPEP 608.01\n\nReal-life example showing how you use your trademark in commerce with your goods or services. It could show the trademark on your goods, their packaging, or in point-of-sale displays, or in the sale, rendering, or advertising of your services. Specimens must be submitted for certain applications and registration maintenance filings.\n\nService Reference Model - also known as a Service Component Reference Model -- a business and performance-driven, functional framework that classifies Service Components with respect to how they support business and/or performance objectives; structured across horizontal and vertical service domains that, independent of the business functions, can provide a leverage-able foundation to support the reuse of applications, application capabilities, components, and business services.\n\n-- see Federal Enterprise Architecture for more\n\nDepiction of the trademark you want to register if it only includes text, numbers, punctuation, or a combination, with no design, color, or stylization. Provides the broadest protection for a trademark. When registered, you have rights to use the trademark regardless of font style, color, or other stylization of the text.\n\nCompares fees earned to costs incurred during a specific period of time. It is not necessarily an indicator of net income or net cost over the life of a patent or trademark. Net income or net cost for the fiscal year is dependent upon the phases of work that have been completed. The net income calculation is based on fees earned during the fiscal year being reported, regardless of when those fees were collected. Maintenance fees play a large part in whether net income or net cost is recognized. Maintenance fees collected in fiscal year 2004 are a reflection of patent issue levels 3.5, 7.5, and 11.5 years ago, rather than a reflection of patents issued in fiscal year 2004. Therefore, maintenance fees can have a significant impact on matching costs and revenue. In addition, the statement of net cost calculation looks at groups of work that begin and end the fiscal year in various phases of their life cycle.\n\n--see Financial Statements in the Annual Performance and Accountability Reports.\n\nAn applicant’s written submission that they're using their trademark in commerce with specified goods or services, submitted after a Notice of Allowance (NOA) has issued. This is a form of allegation of use, which is required in intent-to-use applications. Among other requirements, it must include a specimen showing actual use in commerce of the trademark for each class of goods or services.\n\nA statement made by an applicant for patent in lieu of an oath or declaration if the inventor is deceased, under a legal incapacity, has refused to execute the oath or declaration, or cannot be found or reached after diligent effort.\n\n-- see 37 CFR 1.64 and MPEP 604\n\nOffice action asking the applicant for the status of the issue impacting their application. For example, if the applicant requested a suspension during a lawsuit related to their trademark, the letter will ask if the lawsuit is still pending, has been suspended, or has been terminated.\n\nAlso known as a “TD\" - a statement filed by an owner under 35 USC 253 (paragraph 2) and 37 CFR 1.321(b) or (c) to disclaim or dedicate to the public the entire term or any portion of the term of a patent or patent to be granted. A TD may be filed for the purpose of overcoming a non-statutory double patenting rejection.\n\n-- see MPEP 1490 and 37 CFR 1.321\n\nA word or phrase that serves to link or create a relationship between one idea or concept and another. In patent law it is used to designate the transition from the preamble of a claim to the body of the claim as well as indicate whether the scope of the claim is open or closed to other elements or limitations.\n\nIn the following example, \"consisting of\" is the transitional phrase between \"an item\" and \"one or more parts\":\n\nEXAMPLE: an item consisting of one or more parts.\n\nBona fide use of a trademark in the trade of goods or services. The trademark must be either:\n\nOn the goods, packaging, labels, tags, or displays where the goods are sold or transported in commerce, or\n\nUsed to sell or advertise services rendered in commerce\n\nFor federal registration, your goods or services must be offered in more than on U.S. state or territory, or in the U.S. and at least one other country.\n\nLegal basis you can use to file a trademark application if you are using your trademark in commerce with the goods and services in your application. You must include evidence of your use in commerce, called a “specimen,” in your application for this basis. This filing basis is also called Section 1(a).\n\nTime period after which a utility patent (that issues from an application filed on or after 12 December 1980) expires if a maintenance fee has not been paid. A petition must be filed along with the appropriate fees to reinstate a patent, which has expired due to failure to pay maintenance fees.\n\n-- see MPEP 2590\n\nA non-elected claim. \"Withdrawn\" is the status identifier that should be used for claims that were not elected (chosen by the applicant to remain under consideration) in response to a restriction requirement.\n\n-- see MPEP 803.01, 803.02 and 803.03\n\nFurther, an appellant (one who is appealing an examiner's rejection to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board) may withdraw some of the appealed claims (i.e., claims subject to a ground of rejection that the appellant did not present for review in the Brief).\n\n-- see MPEP 1214.05\n\nAn allowed application for patent in which the applicant files correspondence to withdraw the patent from issue; thus preventing it from issuing on the patent issue date. The printed document is sometimes available on the day of publication, but is later retracted and will not be available in the patent database. No copy of the patent document will appear on the official USPTO website.\n\n-- see 37 CFR 1.313 and 1.114\n\nWorkflow or the \"flow of work.\"\n\nWorkflow diagrams are a formal way to identify procedural steps and the logic employed in a process used to complete a task or job. Workflow diagrams include each interim step and product(s); the direction of movement through the process (indicated by arrows); decision points, alternative processes and repeated steps, and dependencies (steps or processes that must be completed before, during or after completion of a particular step); and can include the estimated time required for each step, who performs or reviews each step, and resource requirements. Depending on the type of workflow diagramming method used, the start and end points of each interim step may be listed separately or the entire process step can be indicated by a single notation.\n\nIn the 46 years prior to the Great Fire of 1836, the United States government had issued about 10,000 patents. Most of these could never be revived again, but Congress acted to restore those records that could be reconstructed from private files and reproduce models which were deemed critical. Patents whose records were not restored were cancelled. There were a total of 2,845 patents restored, most of which were eventually given a number beginning with \"X.\" All patents after the date of the establishment of the Patent Office in July 1836 were numbered as a new series (without the X), beginning with a new Patent No. 1 to John Ruggles. A small number of the new series patents had been destroyed in the Great Fire but they were quickly recovered from their owners' records. X files bear numbers that range from X000001 to X011280. X0000001 is the first patent, issued to Samuel Hopkins in 1790."
