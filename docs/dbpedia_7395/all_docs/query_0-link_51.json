        "text": "You’ve come to the right place. With Nuke Non-commercial, you get access to free, non-watermarked versions of Nuke, NukeX and even top-of-the-line Nuke Studio for as long as you like, so you can learn, explore and have fun on your own schedule.\n\nWhat can’t you do with Nuke Non-commercial?\n\nNuke Non-commercial has some license restrictions you need to know about. Visit our FAQ page for full details.\n\nThere are also a few functional differences between commercial and non-commercial versions of the Nuke family. Here are the most important limitations of using the non-commercial versions:\n\nOutput resolution is limited to HD (1920 x 1080).\n\nThe WriteGeo, Primatte, Ultimatte, and GenerateLUT nodes are disabled.\n\n2D format support is disabled for MPEG4 and h264.\n\nThere’s no support for third-party plug-ins—only plug-ins that ship with Nuke are supported.\n\nData storage is encrypted, meaning that you cannot open Nuke Non-commercial files in the commercial version of Nuke.\n\nPython scripting is limited.\n\nIf you’re looking to evaluate the full commercial version, get our 30-day free trial."
