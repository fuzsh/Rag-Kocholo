        "text": "WizTree 4.20 (29 July 2024)\n\nNew tweak option added (Options->Tweaks):\n\n\"Scan MFT (if possible) when a folder is selected for analysis\" - default is off\n\nNormally, when a folder is selected for analysis WizTree will scan using the Windows API (MFT scanning is not used). This method is generally quicker when analyzing small to medium sized folders, but for very large folders it can be much quicker to scan the entire MFT file instead.\n\nIf this option is enabled WizTree will always scan the MFT file (is possible) when a folder is selected. You can also force WizTree to scan the MFT when a folder is selected by holding down the CTRL key when starting a new scan. The CTRL key must be down when the scanning process starts for this to work.\n\nFixed possible reverse order sorting issue in File View when scanning multiple drives/folders\n\nCut/Copy files to clipboard working again on Windows XP/2000/2003 (stopped working in 4.18 due to compatibility issues with new code)\n\nProcessing of folders with millions of files with unique file extensions greatly sped up. Previously WizTree could appear to stop responding when loading such folders into the tree view or when generating the tree map.\n\nTree map export now always processes files and folders in size order as the resulting output looks much nicer this way\n\nWindows Explorer context menu shortcut key for WizTree changed from W to Z (from &WizTree to Wi&zTree) to prevent conflict with \"New\" option\n\nFixed issue where file sizes/allocated sizes could incorrectly be set to 0 for hard linked files in some cases\n\nMFT scanning speed up to 15% faster in certain cases over previous version\n\nWizTree 4.19 (5 March 2024)\n\nWizTree can now locate duplicate files by Name and Size, or Name, Size and Date.\n\nWizTree considers file names that have been automatically renamed by Windows as equivalent.\n\ne.g. \"NAME.EXT\", \"NAME (1).EXT\", \"NAME (2).EXT\", \"NAME - COPY.EXT\", \"NAME - COPY (1).EXT\" are equivalent\n\nNote that WizTree currently doesn't compare the file contents, so take care before deleting files that might not be true duplicates.\n\nTo locate duplicates, select the \"File View\" then select the duplicate detection method from the \"Duplicate Files\" drop down box. If any duplicate files are located while scanning, they will be indicated by a \"+\" symbol next to the file name - click on the plus to expand the list of duplicate files which will be displayed under the original file.\n\nNew \"Dup Count\" (number of duplicates the file has) and \"Dup Size\" (total size of all other duplicate files) columns will appear and the list can be sorted by these to quickly locate duplicates. Select the \"Duplicates only\" checkbox to quickly display only files that have duplicates.\n\nA new separate \"File Name\" column has been added to the \"File View\" that displays just the file name, excluding the path\n\nFile view might not have shown all relevant files when \"max files\" was not set to \"ALL\" and sorting was not by size - fixed\n\nFile view sorting is much quicker now\n\nRegular expression filters would incorrectly be applied to \"entire path\" when match by \"name only\" was selected if the reg expression contained a backslash - fixed\n\nThemes are now automatically disabled when WizTree is running as local system account (\"SYSTEM\") as this would cause some display elements not to render correctly when using remote access tools such as ScreenConnect\n\nStability improvements when scanning network folders and drives\n\nWizTree 4.18 (2 February 2024)\n\n\"Include\" filter is now no longer applied WHILE scanning as this causes files and folders to be filtered out incorrectly - it is now applied after scanning. Only the \"Exclude\" filter is applied while scanning now.\n\nImproved \"=folder\" filter processing. It's now possible to locate folders of a certain size by using a filter like:\n\n=folder >1g\n\n(This finds folders larger than 1 Gig in size)\n\nfixed bug in allocated size filtering (file size was used instead of allocated size when filtering by allocated size, e.g. a>100m)\n\nCopy/Cut/Delete and other operations now work correctly with multiple files from different folders selected. Previously it would only work if all files were in the same folder.\n\nprogress bar tweaked to be a little smoother\n\nprogress was not being updated on screen when loading CSV files - fixed\n\nWizTree 4.17 (22 January 2024)\n\n\"Include\" and \"exclude\" filters are now applied WHILE scanning non NTFS drives (folders, network shares, mobile phones, etc.) This can greatly speed up scans by prevening certain folders from being scanned at all, and can also greatly reduce memory use. This also works when exporting via the command line.\n\nToggle filters on/off by clicking on the filter button under the Scan button, or Options->Filter Scan Results (Ctrl+Shift+F)\n\nFor example, if you use Synology NAS, you can get WizTree to ignore snapshot and recycle folders by setting the \"exclude filter\" to: #snapshot|#recycle|@recycle\n\nbefore starting a scan. Note that there should not be any spaces between the vertical pipes (vertical pipes are interpreted as \"OR\" and spaces interpreted as \"AND\"). The example above will exclude any file or folder name that contains \"#snapshot\" OR \"#recycle\" OR \"@recycle\".\n\nAnother example:\n\nTo exclude the \"C:\\Windows\\WinSxS\" and \"C:\\Program Files\" folders from being scanned, you would set the exclude filter to C:\\Windows\\WinSxS\\|\"C:\\Program Files\\\"\n\nNote that double quotes are required around filter items that contain spaces.\n\nExploring a folder containing an exe with the same name as the folder would launch the exe instead of opening the folder - fixed\n\nWizTree will now automatically remove any spaces between vertical pipes in filter and search fields to ensure they work as expected\n\nSlovak, Turkish and Swedish translations updated\n\nWizTree 4.16 (13 November 2023)\n\nNew \"Tweaks\" option added to Options menu:\n\n- Drag/drop can be enabled/disabled\n\n- Open file on double click can be enabled/disabled\n\n- File system monitoring can be enabled/disabled (disabling it will prevent WizTree from detecting deleted files and folders)\n\n- Max modified date diaplayed can toggle between maximum date of all sub folders and files or the last modified date of the folder itself\n\n- WizTree classic theme can be enabled/disabled. Some users claim the classic theme makes the UI snappier\n\n- Grid horizontal lines can be enabled/disabled\n\n- Alternate row colors for grids can be enabled/disabled\n\n- Gradient colors in treemap can be enabled/disabled\n\n- Number of decimal places can be set\n\nSelecting files now also shows total allocated size of selected, along with total file size\n\nSorted column will now be highlighted\n\nFixed rare issue where WizTree would sometimes incorrectly flag files as deleted when scanning very large drives\n\nFile and folder icons in tree/file views tweaked to look better when scaled\n\nUnicode characters were not being saved to search and filter drop down history correctly - fixed\n\nEmojis were not being displayed correctly in file search and filter fields - fixed\n\nTweaked mobile phone scanning code to be more robust. It should now work on phones that failed to scan previously\n\nWizTree 4.15 (14 August 2023)\n\nUI tweaked to look like Windows 11 style\n\nWizTree can now export/import \".tsv\" (tab separated values) files. Simply set the file name extension to \".tsv\" when saving to enable this, otherwise it will use a comma to separate the values\n\nSome UI elements would be slightly blurry on high DPI screens - fixed\n\nDeleted files will now be marked with a red outline in the treemap as they are detected\n\nFixed treemap hover glitch which could happen in certain situations when deleting files\n\nVarious translations updated\n\nWizTree 4.14.0.1 (6 June 2023)\n\nFixed row height scaling issue with high DPI screens - if you already downloaded 4.14 (5 June 2023) please download again and reinstall. Apologies for any inconvenience.\n\nWizTree 4.14 (5 June 2023)\n\nFixed rare bug that might cause some folders not to be detected by WizTree when parsing MFT file due to unusual MFT record ordering\n\nTree, file and extension views text size can be increased/decreased by using Ctrl+MouseWheel\n\nWhen importing CSV files WizTree will now display the line number containing invalid data that caused the import to fail. Useful for those who create WizTree compatible CSV files\n\nAdded new \"Reset Configuration to default values\" function to the File menu. This will set all but the licencing info back to default values. Use this if you notice anything weird happening (like very large or small column widths, font sizes, etc)\n\nWizTree will now by default display the maximum \"last modified date\" for all files and folders within a folder instead of the standard Windows last modified date. This will only apply to new installations or when resetting the configuration. To disable this edit the WizTree3.ini file and change the following setting:\n\nShowMaxModifiedDate=0\n\nWizTree will now default to sorting by \"Allocated\" space instead of \"Size\" as this better reflects actual space used by files. Allocated space will now also be displayed on the Treemap by default. This will only apply to new installations or when resetting the configuration\n\nInstaller has been updated to use the correct configuration file location when being installed to a non \"Program Files\" location. If WizTree detects it's running from the \"Program Files\" folder it assumes it's the \"installed\" version and keeps the config file in the %appdata%\\WizTree3 folder, otherwise it will keep the config file in the same folder it's running from. Previously the installer would always assume the config file was in %appdata% folder, which would be incorrect when installing to a non default location.\n\nThis is useful for Enterprise users running automated installs as the \"SYSTEM\" user as the various config command line parameters will now be applied to the correct configuration file.\n\ne.g. to do a silent install of WizTree into the \"C:\\WizTreeApp\" folder with no desktop icon, auto configuring it to not run as admin, disable checking for updates, and setting the license key:\n\nwiztree_4_14_setup.exe /DIR=\"C:\\WizTreeApp\" /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /SP- /MERGETASKS=!desktopicon /runasadmin=false /checkforupdates=false /supportercode=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx\n\nInstaller will now update the registry to make mapped network drives that were created by non elevated processes visible to elevated processes like WizTree. This will require a restart to take effect if not already enabled.\n\nWizTree 4.13 (15 March 2023)\n\nRegular Expression search added. To perform a regex search, type in a forward slash followed immediately by the regex, e.g.:\n\n/[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]\\.csv$\n\nIf the regex contains spaces, enclose it in double quotes, like this:\n\n/\"[0-9]{4} [0-9]{2} [0-9]\\.csv$\"\n\nRegular expression searches can be used for file search and include/exclude filters\n\nSearch history dropdown added to File Search and Include/Exclude filters\n\nInclude/Exclude Filters can now be applied to entire path (default) or file name only\n\nNew command line parameter /filterfullpath=[0|1] added to control whether filters are applied to full path or file name only. Default is full path.\n\ne.g. WizTree64.exe /filterfullpath=0\n\nSupport for DrivePool, Storage Spaces and other similar \"virtual\" drives added (WizTree would crash or stop working when scanning these types of drive before)\n\nImporting a CSV file would display incorrect file dates/times due to timezone adjustment error - fixed\n\nFixed possible \"Access Violation\" error on startup when scanning for devices such as mobile phones\n\ndefault sorting can now be set via command line /sortby=sortoption, where sortoption can be\n\n1 = sort by file size (desc), file name\n\n2 = sort by allocated size (desc), file name\n\n3 - sort by modified date (desc)\n\nPercent of Drive calculations (File View) were incorrect when multiple drives were selected - fixed\n\nWizTree will now remember if tree and file view data is being sorted by size or allocated and use the same sort order when restarted\n\nNew Indonesian translation added (thanks to Marcellinus Ferdinand Suciadi)\n\nWizTree 4.12 (1 December 2022)\n\nFixed issue with file size filters (e.g. >1g) not handling folders correctly\n\nFixed file filter bug that could cause matching files not to appear in some cases\n\nNew Czech translation added (thanks to Masterix)\n\nWizTree 4.11 (26 October 2022)\n\n\"Today\" file search filter (=today) was not working correctly in some time zones - fixed\n\nCommand line parameters for /filter and /filterexclude now support literal double quotes. This is useful when filtering paths containing spaces, to prevent the filter from treating the space as an \"AND\" operator.\n\nUse a single quote character to represent the double quote, like this:\n\nWizTree64.exe /filter=\"'C:\\Program Files\\'|'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\'\"\n\nThe example above would set the \"include filter\" to\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\\"|\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\\"\n\nThe filter above will match file names containing \"C:\\Program Files\\\" OR \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\\"\n\nTwo single quotes in a row will be treated as one literal single quote:\n\nWizTree64.exe /filter=\"'C:\\Program Files\\'|'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\'|'C:\\Bob''s Folder\\'\"\n\nThis would set the \"include filter\" to\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\\"|\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\"|\"C:\\Bob's Folder\\\"\n\nWithout the quotes the filtering will not work as expected:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\|C:\\Program Files (x86)\\\n\nThis would match any file names containing \"C:\\Program\" AND ( \"Files\\\" OR \"C:\\Program\" ) AND \"Files\" AND \"(x86)\\\"\n\nPreviously the way to work around this problem was to replace the spaces with wildcard question marks, like this:\n\nWizTree64.exe /filter=\"C:\\Program?Files\\|C:\\Program?Files?(x86)\\\"\n\nWizTree 4.09/4.10 would crash when run as \"SYSTEM\" user (\"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\") due to some issues with the newly added drag/drop functionality - fixed\n\nFixed some cosmetic issues with Italian translation\n\nWizTree 4.10 (29 August 2022)\n\nTreemap would not be rendered correctly when \"show free space\" option not selected in some cases (such as mapped Google Drives or when scanning a mobile phone) - fixed\n\nIt is now possible to disable the new drag/drop and double click to open functionality added in 4.09. To do this close WizTree and edit the WizTree3.ini file and change these 2 settings in the [frmWizTreeMain] section:\n\n[frmWizTreeMain]\n\nenabledragdrop=0\n\nenabledoubleclickopen=0\n\nFixed rare command line export error when using \"/exportalldates\" parameter\n\nFixed error that would occur when using the \"save treemap as png file\" option with multiple selections and show free space enabled\n\nKorean, Serbian and Polish translations updated\n\nWizTree 4.09 (15 August 2022)\n\nDisk free space on treemap will now be displayed separately for each selection when using the \"select multiple\" option\n\nExport functions updated to always format floating point values (like percentages) using a point as currency separator. Previously it used the system locale character which is a comma in some countries. This extra comma would create problems when importing the data into other applications (like spreadsheets)\n\nDouble clicking a file or folder in the tree or file view will now automatically open it\n\nFiles/folders can now be dragged out of WizTree and into Windows Explorer windows to copy/move them. Hold Ctrl key while dragging to copy the file, otherwise it will be moved. Dragging will only work when dragged from the file name column. Dragging in other columns will select all files in the selection rectangle.\n\nCopy (Ctrl+C)/Cut (Ctrl+X) menu items added to File Menu. Copy path shortcut changed from Ctrl+C to Ctrl+Alt+C\n\nCopy Path function will no longer include a trailing carriage return if only one item is selected\n\nDrive name now displayed in tree view and treemap\n\nMenu accelerator keys were not working in dark mode (fixed)\n\nnew command line parameter added to select size or allocated space for treemap image export (default is size):\n\n/treemapimageshowallocated=[0|1]\n\ne.g.\n\nWizTree64.exe C: /treemapimagefile=\"C:\\temp\\cdriveimage_%d.png\" /treemapimagewidth=1024 /treemapimageheight=768 /treemapimagefreespace=0 /treemapimageshowallocated=1\n\nWizTree 4.08 (14 February 2022)\n\nAdded new \"Filter Scan Results\" option which allows entire scan results to be filtered using a user defined filter.\n\nToggle the filter on or off by clicking on the filter icon under the Scan button, or select Options->Filter Scan Results, or press Ctrl+Shift+F\n\nThe \"Include Filter\" will include only matching files in the results\n\nThe \"Exclude Filter\" will exclude any matching files from the results\n\nClick on the \"Apply Filter\" button (or press Enter after making a filter change) to apply any filter changes made. Files are matched using the entire file path and file name. The filters support all standard file search functionality, such as wild cards, file size, file date etc. See this link for all search options: https://diskanalyzer.com/guide#search\n\ne.g. To filter only files of type mp3 or wav, larger than 5MB, excluding anything in the C:\\Windows folder, you'd enter:\n\nInclude Filter: *.mp3|*.wav >5m\n\nExclude Filter: C:\\Windows\\\n\nWildcard search for file extensions was not working correctly when \"match entire path\" option was used - fixed\n\ne.g. searching for *.c would include files including \".c\" anywhere in the file name, which would include *.cpp or *.c.bak files too.\n\nTotal space, space used, space free display fields widened to correctly display very large TB drive values when displaying as Bytes\n\nWindow position was not being restored to correct position if Windows taskbar was not positioned at bottom of screen - fixed\n\nFixed some dark mode display issues on older versions of Windows (2003, XP)\n\nWizTree 4.07 (6 December 2021)\n\nfile name search will now ignore character accents (like é and ö) when searching.\n\ne.g. searching for \"melee\" will now correctly match file names containing \"mêlée\" or \"MÊLÉE\"\n\nWizTree was not handling MTP/PTP devices that did not provide a \"friendly name\" correctly - fixed\n\nMFT dump would fail on Windows XP - fixed\n\nRemovable USB devices formatted with NTFS would not be detected for high speed scanning or allow MFT dump - fixed\n\nChecks if Windows Imaging Component is installed before starting up (cannot run without it). This is required for Windows 2003 and possibly some versions of XP\n\nWizTree 4.06 (19 November 2021)\n\nFile size info will now also be displayed on the treemap (if \"show file and names in treemap\" option enabled)\n\nWizTree will now actually work on older versions of Windows like Windows XP (\"fix\" in 4.05 was incorrect)\n\ntreemap image can now be exported via command line. Use the following command line parameters:\n\nSet image file name (use %d and %t for current date and time in file name):\n\n/treemapimagefile=<png image file name>\n\nSet image width (default is 1920 if omitted):\n\n/treemapimagewidth=<image width (numeric)>\n\nSet image height (default is 1080 is omitted):\n\n/treemapimageheight=<image height (numeric)>\n\nExport image in gray scale. Defaults to 0 if omitted\n\n/treemapimagegray=0|1\n\nShow free space on tree map. Defaults to 1 if omitted\n\n/treemapimagefreespace=0|1\n\ne.g. To export the entire C: drive to an image file of size 1024x768 without free space included:\n\nWizTree64.exe C: /treemapimagefile=\"C:\\temp\\cdriveimage_%d.png\" /treemapimagewidth=1024 /treemapimageheight=768 /treemapimagefreespace=0\n\nExporting of the image file can be combined with exporting CSV data as well, e.g.:\n\nWizTree64.exe C: /export=\"C:\\temp\\cdrive_%d_%t.csv\" /treemapimagefile=\"C:\\temp\\cdrive_%d_%t.png\" /treemapimagewidth=1024 /treemapimageheight=768 /treemapimagefreespace=0\n\nWizTree 4.05 (17 November 2021)\n\nWizTree 4.04 would display some error messages on PCs without MTP support (e.g. old versions of Windows XP) - fixed\n\nToggling Windows Explorer integration off did not fully remove WizTree from Windows Explorer context menus (bug introduced in 4.04) - fixed\n\nFixed title bar display issues issues with very high DPI screens (maximize/minimize buttons were too small)\n\nWizTree installer now supports the following (optional) command line parameters:\n\nSet the supporter code license on install:\n\n/supportercode=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx\n\nSet the \"always run as admin\" setting:\n\n/runasadmin=TRUE|FALSE\n\nSet the \"check for updates\" setting:\n\n/checkforupdates=TRUE|FALSE\n\ne.g. wiztree_x_xx_setup.exe /supportercode=1234-5678-abcd-1234 /runasadmin=false /checkforupdates=false\n\nWizTree 4.04 (4 November 2021)\n\nWizTree can now scan mobile phones, music players, storage devices, cameras and other portable devices that support MTP/PTP (Media Transfer Protocol/Picture Transfer Protocol)\n\nFor example, to scan files on your mobile phone, connect it to your PC using a USB cable. Your phone will then prompt you to select either \"file transfer\" or \"photo transfer\" mode. Once you've done this, your phone will appear in WizTree's drop down drive list and can be selected to perform a scan.\n\nMTP/PTP device folders may now be selected when using the \"select folder\" option\n\ndrawing treemap for multiple large drives may have left status message as \"Show Treemap\" even after drawing complete - fixed\n\nNot (!) operator was not working correctly when followed by quoted search text - fixed\n\nsome results were not being included when using \"?\" wildcard and searching entire path - fixed\n\nFile search box and highlighted text were not handling right to left languages like Arabic correctly - fixed\n\nWizTree 4.03 (22 September 2021)\n\nTreemap may have failed to render on some very large hard drives - fixed\n\nZooming in on treemap will now hide \"free space\" if \"show free space on treemap\" is enabled\n\nA limited context menu will now be available when loading CSV or MFT files from other PCs. Previously no context menu would appear if the file/folder didn't exist on the local PC.\n\nWizTree 4.02 (20 September 2021)\n\nTreemap now displays file and folder names for large files and folders.\n\nDouble click on a folder or file in the treemap to \"zoom\" the treemap into that folder. Use new \"..\" and \"\\\" buttons on treemap to unzoom one level or to reset the treemap to the root. You can also select \"Zoom in Treemap\" and \"Zoom out treemap\" from the file or folder context menu (right click menu)\n\nFile and folder name display can be toggled via \"Options->Show File and Folder Names in Treemap\"\n\nThe \"explore folder\" option will now automatically select the file in Windows explorer if a file was selected\n\nNew search terms added to file search for files or folders only:\n\nType in =folder or =folders in search to display folders only.\n\nType in =file or =files in search to display files only.\n\nnew file length and path length search terms added:\n\nUse \"namelen\" and \"pathlen\" to search by file name length and path length\n\ne.g. to find files with path length (includes file name) greater than 255:\n\npathlen>255\n\nto find file names with exactly 1 character:\n\nnamelen=1\n\nnew export command line parameters:\n\nTo export \"percent of parent\" data, include the parameter:\n\n/exportpercentofparent=1\n\nTo set the maximum folder depth to be exported, include the parameter:\n\n/exportmaxdepth=n\n\nWhere n is the maximum folder depth.\n\ne.g. to export the root folders and files only:\n\n/exportmaxdepth=1\n\nA max depth of 0 means unlimited (default)\n\nGradient in treemap can be now disabled by editing the WizTree3.ini file and setting\n\nGradientEnabled=0\n\nWizTree 4.01 (21 June 2021)\n\nSupporter codes purchased before version 4.00 was released have been automatically converted to \"lifetime\" licenses and will now work on all future releases of WizTree\n\nSome drive types were not displaying total and free space (fixed)\n\nTreemap context menu now displays various treemap configuration options (show treemap, show allocated space, show free space)\n\nPolish translation updated\n\nTurkish translation updated\n\nWizTree 4.00 (10 June 2021)\n\nMultiple drives and folders may now be selected and scanned at once (use the \"Select multiple\" option in the drop down, or press Alt+F3 to select drives and folders)\n\nWhen selecting multiple drives or folders, you can add custom folders to the list by clicking on the \"add folder\" button. These new user defined folders will also appear in the main drop down selection box for quick access.\n\nThe file search has been updated to work the way WizFile does. These new search filter options can also be used as filters when calling WizTree from the command line.\n\nUse operators \"=\", \">\", \">=\", \"<\", \"<=\" to filter files based on size or modified date. NB: Don't put any spaces between operators and values!\n\ne.g. to find files less than 100 bytes in size:\n\n<100\n\nAppend a 'k', 'm', 'g', or 't' to the number to search in Kb, Mb, Gb, Tb\n\ne.g. to find files between 500MB and 1Gb:\n\n>=500m <=1g\n\n'kb', 'mb', 'gb', 'tb' can also be used, e.g.:\n\n>=500mb <=1gb\n\nTo filter by \"allocated\" size, use \"a=\", \"a>\", etc.\n\ne.g. To find files with allocated size between 100MB and 200MB:\n\na>=100m a<=200m\n\ne.g. to find files with 0 allocated size and greater than zero file size:\n\na=0 >0\n\nTo filter by date, specify a date in the format: yyyy/mm/dd\n\ne.g. Filter files modified before 2020/01/01:\n\n<2020/01/01\n\nUse the constant \"today\" to reference today's date. Optionally add or subtract a number of days from this constant.\n\ne.g. to find files modified in the last 7 days:\n\n>=today-7\n\ne.g. to find all files larger than 1gb that were modified in the last month (last 30 days):\n\n>=1gb >=today-30\n\nPlace the search item in quotes to force a file name search.\n\ne.g. to find file names that contain \"=0\" instead of displaying files with zero size:\n\n\"=0\"\n\nFile search speed has been increased\n\nMatching text will now be highlighted in the file search results\n\nThe wiztree web site has moved to from \"wiztreefree.com\" to \"diskanalyzer.com\"\n\nLicensing has changed. Commercial users will now purchase licenses based on their business size. These licenses will be valid for all versions of WizTree released within one year of purchase. For example, if a user purchases a license on 1 July 2021, it will work with all versions of WizTree that are released before 1 July 2022 (one year from 1 July 2021).\n\nWizTree 3.41 (5 May 2021)\n\nFixed bug introduced in 3.40 that could prevent mapped network drives from being scanned correctly\n\nFixed bug where cluster size may have been incorrect leading to incorrect \"allocated size\" calculations\n\nFixed bug where right clicking on drive letter would not display context menu\n\nFixed inconsistency with how \"percent of parent\" was calculated when displaying individual files that had been grouped together within a folder (\"x files in folder\"). The percentage displayed is now the percentage size of the individual file within the group.\n\nWizTree 3.40 (4 May 2021)\n\nIncorrect allocated space value was being displayed for cloud based files (like OneDrive) - fixed\n\nSearch filter text and number of files drop down on \"files\" view invisible on some older versions of Windows - fixed\n\nupdated EULA\n\nWizTree 3.39 (15 April 2021)\n\nLaunching WizTree with a command line parameter path containing a trailing backslash would cause scanning problems (bug introduced in 3.38, fixed)\n\nChinese (Simplified) translation updated\n\nNote that many of the WizTree translations are out of date as the original translators are no longer available.

Label color issue on Windows XP fixed.\n\nUpdated Turkish translation (thanks to Ferhat MURAT)\n\nNote that many of the WizTree translations are out of date as the original translators are no longer available. If you find that the translation for your language is not correct and you'd like to update it please contact us.\n\nWizTree 3.37 (23 February 2021)\n\nTweaked tree map display drawing. Will now only display drawing progress when dealing with more than 1,000,000 files as it's quicker to not display anything.\n\nDrive selection box would not work correctly if \"display drive letters\" option in Windows File Explorer was turned off (fixed)\n\nDigital signature verification method changed as previous Windows API method (WinVerifyTrust) would trigger unwanted Internet access if required digital certificates were not already installed on the PC\n\nWizTree 3.36 (16 February 2021)\n\nsupport for Windows 10 \"dark mode\". Theme can be changed via Options->Colors->UI Theme\n\nRescanning the same drive or folder (by clicking Scan or pressing F5) will now preserve the current state of the tree and file views so folders and files that were visible or selected before the rescan will remain visible and selected if they still exist after the rescan. This makes \"refreshing\" the view much easier than before.\n\nWizTree may have incorrectly decoded some MFT records on very large hard drives which could lead to extremely large allocated size information being displayed for some files (fixed)\n\n.mft and .csv files created by WizTree can now be dragged into WizTree to be processed. Note that due to the way Windows implements security, you won't be able to drag files from Windows explorer into WizTree if Windows explorer is running non elevated (non admin rights) and WizTree is running elevated (admin rights). You either have to start up Windows explorer in admin mode, or start WizTree in non admin mode (disable \"always run as administartor\") for this to work.\n\nAllocated size for files compressed using NTFS LZX compression would appear as 0 when scanning folders (fixed)\n\nFile search filtering sped up significantly\n\nsupport for very high DPI (200%+ scaling)\n\nWhen dealing with extremely large numbers of files WizTree will display a progress bar after scanning when loading tree data and/or drawing the tree map. We recommend turning the tree map off (toggle with F9) when dealing with very large numbers of files as it can take some time to draw a tree map for millions of files.\n\nminor UI changes\n\nDutch translation updated (thanks to Jan Verheijen)\n\nWizTree 3.35 (31 August 2020)\n\nFixed bug introduced in 3.34 that might cause WizTree to hang when scanning certain hard drives\n\nFixed integer overflow issue that would cause problems when dumping extremely large MFT files\n\nMulti selection on file view did not unselect when Ctrl+Clicking selected item (fixed)\n\ndebug logging is now possible by using the new command line parameter \"/debug=1\". This will create log files in the %appdata%\\WizTree3\\DebugLogs folder. Send these to us if you have any problems.\n\nWizTree 3.34 (29 August 2020)\n\nWhen sorting by allocated size, the percentage of parent calculation will now use allocated size values\n\nImproved MFT file scanning method. Should greatly improve scanning speed on drives with very large MFT files.\n\nMenu items using non English alphabet will no longer have auto generated shortcuts added to them\n\nsome minor UI tweaks (file groups now line up properly, percentage display slightly wider, progress bar lagging fixed)\n\nWizTree can now be configured to display the maximum \"last modified date\" for all files and folders within a folder instead of the standard Windows last modified date.\n\nTo do this edit the WizTree3.ini file and change the following setting:\n\nShowMaxModifiedDate=1\n\nDefault setting is off (0). WizTree3.ini is located in %appdata%\\WizTree3\\WizTree3.ini (for installed version) or in the same folder as the WizTree exe file for the portable version.\n\nUpdated translations for Russian (thanks to Dmitry Yerokhin), Japanese (thanks to maboroshin), Korean (thanks to Kim YoungCheon)\n\nWizTree 3.33 (14 May 2020)\n\nNetwork and substituted drives that may not have been visible to WizTree when running as administrator will now be selectable. This is a work around for a Windows bug/feature that does not allow elevated applications to access network and substituted drives that were created by a non elevated process. See: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee844140(v=ws.10).aspx\n\nIn such a case WizTree will display the contents of the network drive using the UNC name (e.g. \\\\servername\\sharename) instead of the mapped drive letter. Similarly substituted drives will display the contents of the local folder the drive is mapped to instead of the mapped drive letter.\n\nAdded option to display values in TB. Values larger than 1024GB will be displayed in TB in dynamic value display mode.\n\n/filterexclude would not work unless a /filter was specified (fixed)\n\nFolder names will now be matched against the filter specification using a trailing backslash\n\n(setting a /filterexclude to \"C:\\windows\\\" would export the \"C:\\windows\\\" folder record incorrectly as it would filter using \"C:\\windows\" instead of \"c:\\windows\\\")\n\nFiles without an extension can now be filtered for by using \"*.\" filter. This did not work previously as the period was not included in the filename used to match against the filter.\n\nImporting a CSV file that was exported with folders only ( \"/exportfiles=0\") will now display total file and folder info correctly\n\nImporting a CSV file that did not contain complete folder information could cause file names to become corrupted. This would prevent context menu from working correctly.\n\nImporting a CSV file from a network share (e.g. \\\\servername\\sharename) would drop the leading \"\\\\\" when importing (fixed)\n\nrow height can be set in the WizTree3.ini file (\"rowheight=xx\"). Default is 19. Useful if you've increased the fontheight setting in this file.\n\nwhen sorting by allocated size, the percentage of parent calculation will now use allocated size values\n\nView complete change log for all versions.\n\nOlder versions of WizTree can be downloaded on this page."
