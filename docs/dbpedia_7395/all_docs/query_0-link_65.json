        "text": "I am trying to use .X files (whoa.. huh? lol), but I found no good software for importing .X files then editing them then exporting them.. all this with animations, all this in text format (optional, but would be great), all this with having multiple meshes in one .X file. Found some good software to do the half of the jobs done, but is there any way to do it in one step? (I mean really - what do other programmers use at all? I found no good stuff on net.. am I to implement one myself, or such?)\n\nSo any good suggestion would be great, and without garbage: .X files in text with animations with multiple meshes to import and then edit and then export.\n\nThanks: PÃ©ter\n\nedit: I already tried Blender. The 2.49b was the last version supporting import directx in text. After these versions blender is not even importing .x, only exports. 2.49b can export animated .x, but can not import animation. 2.49b can export multiple meshes but will only import one of the meshes - from the same export it did (unmodified). Thanks for the suggestion, but blender is no solution for this, unless you can suggest a working script too please?\n\nsolution: for above mentioned problem there were some solutions. Here I try to sum up stuff:\n\nBlender is a partially working solution; see edit above.\n\nMilkshape seemed to work with directx files, but for my tests it showed up, that only preview worked well, on main screen the textures were bad and no animations were imported. Versions checked are: 1.7.0 and 1.8.4 or something like that, I don't remember.\n\nTrueSpace seemed to not work for any of the .X files. No idea why; tried with tiny.x provided by the DirectX SDK, but nope. *- Good solution is to use quick converter - see post bellow, marked as good answer. Found this allright, because it is closest to my goal.\n\nFound a program (UU3D - Ultimate Unwrap 3D) that loads .X well, with more meshes and multiple animations and the textures are just fine too. Because it is not free, I could not try that if it can save with text as well (saving is simply disabled in demo). For those, who can afford such I could only recommend, because it looks promising.*\n\n\\$\\begingroup\\$\n\nHow about blender?\n\n----- Edit -----\n\nLooking more into it, Blender now only support exporting .X files with a script that needs to be activated via User Preferences, see this forum post.\n\nYou could try converting your .x files into another format to import them fo the tool you want, Milkshape may work.\n\n----- Edit -----\n\nAfter looking even more into it, I see that people reccommend TrueSpace 7.6 which is now completely free and should allow you to import .x files.\n\nIf you don't like the modeller after that, you can just export to a different format and use your favourite modeller.\n\n----- Edit -----\n\nAfter managing to find this on CodeProject, DirectX apparently once provided a tool to convert from .x to .3ds. The link (not tested) should be a Dx8 Extras pack that comes with the conv3ds.exe utility. Here it is, good luck.\n\nGlorfindel\n\n98611 gold badge99 silver badges1616 bronze badges\n\nanswered Jun 9, 2011 at 9:47\n\nJonathan ConnellJonathan Connell\n\n2,7981919 silver badges2727 bronze badges\n\n\\$\\endgroup\\$"
