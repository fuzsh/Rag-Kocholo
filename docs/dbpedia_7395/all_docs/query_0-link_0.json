Its features are mostly congruent with those accessible by generic Unix systems.\n\nSome examples of the more advanced features are a consequence of the above. Operating only with generic Unix APIs Xfile is capable of dealing with a wide variety of file systems and not limited to the operating system's native HFS+.\n\nThe interface of Xfile is navigational in nature, although Xfile windows can be seen as \"document\" windows and behave as such.\n\nComparison of file managers\n\nFile manager"
