For a long time, it has been running on many heavily loaded Russian sites including Yandex, Mail.Ru, VK, and Rambler. Here are some of the success stories: Dropbox, Netflix, FastMail.FM.\n\nThe sources and documentation are distributed under the 2-clause BSD-like license.\n\nCommercial support is available from F5, Inc.\n\nBasic HTTP server features\n\nServing static and index files, autoindexing; open file descriptor cache;\n\nAccelerated reverse proxying with caching; load balancing and fault tolerance;\n\nAccelerated support with caching of FastCGI, uwsgi, SCGI, and memcached servers; load balancing and fault tolerance;\n\nModular architecture. Filters include gzipping, byte ranges, chunked responses, XSLT, SSI, and image transformation filter. Multiple SSI inclusions within a single page can be processed in parallel if they are handled by proxied or FastCGI/uwsgi/SCGI servers;\n\nSSL and TLS SNI support;\n\nSupport for HTTP/2 with weighted and dependency-based prioritization;\n\nSupport for HTTP/3.\n\nOther HTTP server features\n\nName-based and IP-based virtual servers;\n\nKeep-alive and pipelined connections support;\n\nAccess log formats, buffered log writing, fast log rotation, and syslog logging;\n\n3xx-5xx error codes redirection;\n\nThe rewrite module: URI changing using regular expressions;\n\nExecuting different functions depending on the client address;\n\nAccess control based on client IP address, by password (HTTP Basic authentication) and by the result of subrequest;\n\nValidation of HTTP referer;\n\nThe PUT, DELETE, MKCOL, COPY, and MOVE methods;\n\nFLV and MP4 streaming;\n\nResponse rate limiting;\n\nLimiting the number of simultaneous connections or requests coming from one address;\n\nIP-based geolocation;\n\nA/B testing;\n\nRequest mirroring;\n\nEmbedded Perl;\n\nnjs scripting language.\n\nMail proxy server features\n\nUser redirection to IMAP or POP3 server using an external HTTP authentication server;\n\nUser authentication using an external HTTP authentication server and connection redirection to an internal SMTP server;\n\nAuthentication methods:\n\nPOP3: USER/PASS, APOP, AUTH LOGIN/PLAIN/CRAM-MD5;\n\nIMAP: LOGIN, AUTH LOGIN/PLAIN/CRAM-MD5;\n\nSMTP: AUTH LOGIN/PLAIN/CRAM-MD5;\n\nSSL support;\n\nSTARTTLS and STLS support.\n\nTCP/UDP proxy server features\n\nGeneric proxying of TCP and UDP;\n\nSSL and TLS SNI support for TCP;\n\nLoad balancing and fault tolerance;\n\nAccess control based on client address;\n\nExecuting different functions depending on the client address;\n\nLimiting the number of simultaneous connections coming from one address;\n\nAccess log formats, buffered log writing, fast log rotation, and syslog logging;\n\nIP-based geolocation;\n\nA/B testing;\n\nnjs scripting language.\n\nArchitecture and scalability\n\nOne master and several worker processes; worker processes run under an unprivileged user;\n\nFlexible configuration;\n\nReconfiguration and upgrade of an executable without interruption of the client servicing;\n\nSupport for kqueue (FreeBSD 4.1+), epoll (Linux 2.6+), /dev/poll (Solaris 7 11/99+), event ports (Solaris 10), select, and poll;\n\nThe support of the various kqueue features including EV_CLEAR, EV_DISABLE (to temporarily disable events), NOTE_LOWAT, EV_EOF, number of available data, error codes;\n\nThe support of various epoll features including EPOLLRDHUP (Linux 2.6.17+, glibc 2.8+) and EPOLLEXCLUSIVE (Linux 4.5+, glibc 2.24+);\n\nsendfile (FreeBSD 3.1+, Linux 2.2+, macOS 10.5+), sendfile64 (Linux 2.4.21+), and sendfilev (Solaris 8 7/01+) support;\n\nFile AIO (FreeBSD 4.3+, Linux 2.6.22+);\n\nDIRECTIO (FreeBSD 4.4+, Linux 2.4+, Solaris 2.6+, macOS);\n\nAccept-filters (FreeBSD 4.1+, NetBSD 5.0+) and TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT (Linux 2.4+) support;\n\n10,000 inactive HTTP keep-alive connections take about 2.5M memory;\n\nData copy operations are kept to a minimum.\n\nTested OS and platforms"
