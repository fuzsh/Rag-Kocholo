        "text": "After 13 years, the truth is still out there, and FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully have never stopped searching for it.\n\nFox released a preview video to the official X-Files YouTube channel on Monday, taking fans of the series behind the scenes for an in-depth look at what to expect from Mulder (David Duchovny), Scully (Gillian Anderson), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and the rest of The X-Files cast in the upcoming season.\n\nThe 21-minute featurette includes interviews with series creator Chris Carter as well as Duchovny and Anderson and other key cast members as they reveal secrets from the set and take you on the epic journey of bringing this classic series back to Fox:\n\nVisual effects for the series reboot are provided by Image Engine and Psyop under the lead of production VFX supervisor William Powloski.\n\nCheck out the Saul Bass-inspired animated trailer created for the series:\n\nHere’s the official synopsis and trailer:\n\nThirteen years after the original series run, the next mind-bending chapter of THE X-FILES is a thrilling, six-episode event series from creator/executive producer Chris Carter, with stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson re-inhabiting their roles as iconic FBI Agents FOX MULDER and DANA SCULLY. Mitch Pileggi also returns as FBI ASST. DIR. WALTER SKINNER, Mulder and Scully’s boss, who walks a fine line between loyalty to these investigators and accountability to his superiors. This marks the momentous return of the Emmy- and Golden Globe Award-winning pop culture phenomenon, which remains one of the longest-running sci-fi series in network television history. THE X-FILES debuts with a special two-night event beginning Sunday, Jan. 24, 2016 (10:00-11:00 PM ET/7:00-8:00 PM PT), following the NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, and continuing with its time period premiere on Monday, Jan. 25 (8:00-9:00 PM ET/PT). The upcoming event series will encompass a mixture of stand-alone episodes and those that further the original show’s seminal mythology. In the opening episode, Mulder and Scully take on a case of a possible alien abductee. The all-new episodes will feature appearances by guest stars, including Joel McHale (“Community”), Robbie Amell (“The Flash”), Lauren Ambrose (“Dig,” “Six Feet Under”), Annabeth Gish (“The Bridge”), Annet Mahendru (“The Americans”), Rhys Darby (“Flight of the Conchords”), Kumail Nanjiani (“Silicon Valley”) and William B. Davis, who reprises his role as “Cigarette Smoking Man.” Three of the episodes are written and directed by Chris Carter, with the remaining new episodes written and directed by original series veterans Glen Morgan, Darin Morgan and James Wong.\n\nThe X-Files premieres on Fox Sunday, January 24 at 10:00ET/7:00PT.\n\nSource: The X-Files"
