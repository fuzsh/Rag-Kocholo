        "text": "First, you should create your variable as XFile\n\nBecause this is what you get from image picker.\n\nXFile photo;\n\nvoid _pickImage() async { final ImagePicker _picker = ImagePicker(); photo = await _picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.camera); if (photo == null) return; }\n\nAnd then you can use your image as a file image.\n\nImage.file(File(photo.path))\n\nThis happens because the package (image_picker ) you are using is relying on XFile and not File, as previously did.\n\nSo, first you have to create a variable of type File so you can work with later as you did, and after fetching the selectedImage you pass the path to instantiate the File. Like this:\n\nFile? selectedImage; bool _isLoading = false; CrudMethods crudMethods = CrudMethods(); Future getImage() async { var image = await ImagePicker().pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery); setState(() { selectedImage = File(image!.path); // won't have any error now }); } //implement the upload code"
