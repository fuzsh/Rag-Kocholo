        "text": "Client-side Installation and Instantiation\n\nCAB Installation in Non-Admin mode\n\nAs of version 2.5.1, XFile's CAB installation fully supports non-administrative ActiveX installation in Internet Explorer 8on platforms running Windows Vista and later. In prior versions of XFile, regardless of the version of Internet Explorer or Windows OS, the user needed to have administrative privileges to be able to install XFile through Internet Explorer. Now with version 2.5.1, on Windows Vista and later, a standard user can install XFile through IE8 in per-user mode, which does not require UAC elevation for administrative privileges and installs the control under the user's profile on the machine.\n\nFor non-admin mode installation, the user will just need to select the \"Install This Add-on...\" option from the information bar in IE8 when prompted for \"This website wants to install the following add-on: 'SoftArtisans XFile' from 'Software Artisans, Inc'. If you trust the website and the add-on and want to install it, click here...\". If the user selects the \"Install This Add-on for All Users on This Computer...\" option (which is the machine-wide install mode), then the user will be prompted a UAC dialog to enter an admin password.\n\nInstallation of XFile on the client is handled by the browser when it encounters a request to instantiate and XFile object. If the browser cannot locate the needed dlls, it will make a request to the server for the XFile cab, and install these dlls. All of this depends on proper use of the HTML <OBJECT> tag, which is used to instantiate XFile in the browser.\n\nThe <OBJECT> tag\n\nTo create client-side instances of XFile's main objects, SoftArtisans FileManager, or SoftArtisans Archive, use the HTML <object> tag with the appropriate classid.\n\nclassid\n\nThe classid specifies which control to create (the various classids are listed below). For example, to create an instance of XFileSE's visual upload control, use,\n\n<OBJECT classid=\"CLSID:230C3D02-DA27-11D2-8612-00A0C93EEA3C\" id=\"AXFFile\" codebase=\"[path]/saxfile.cab#version=x,x,x,x\">\n\nid\n\nThe attribute id specifies a name for the object instance you create. You can supply any name as an id. Use the id to refer to the object in your script. For example, if you named your instance of the visual control \"AXFFile,\" use the following to add a file to this object's file collection via script:\n\n<script> ... AXFFile.AddFile \"x:\\filename.ext\" ... </script>\n\ncodebase\n\nThe codebase attribute specifies the location of XFile's cab file on the webserver. If the classid of the object you are trying to instantiate is not found in the client registry, the browser will make a request to download a copy of the cabfile, register the dlls and then instantiate the object in your code.\n\ncodebase... #version\n\nThe version property of the codebase attribute should be specified in order to force the client to run the version of the object that you specify. If the version property is specified, the browser will check to make sure that the dll registered on the client is at least that version or higher. If the client has a lower version of the dll installed, the browser will make a fresh request for the cab file and register the newer dlls.\n\nTo find the version number for a control:\n\nExtract the appropriate file from the SAXFile.cab (see thetable below to match objects with appropriate dlls)\n\nRight-click on the dll.\n\nChoose \"Properties\"\n\nSelect the \"Version\" tab\n\nCopy the dll version number to the codebase...#version attribute of the <OBJECT> tag, remembering to replace the period separators with comma separators to comply with <OBJECT> tag syntax.\n\nLet's say the version number of the visual control (AXFFile object, SAAXFile.dll file) is 2.0.1.0. Add \"version=2,0,1,0\" to the codebase attribute:\n\n<OBJECT classid=\"CLSID:230C3D02-DA27-11D2-8612-00A0C93EEA3C\" id=\"AXFFile\" codebase=\"/SAXFileSamples/saxfile.cab#version=2,0,1,0\">\n\nThis will assure that your end users are running at least this version of the control. Please see Upgrading XFile for more information on this topic.\n\nA Note on Proxy Servers:\n\nProxy servers may cache a copy of the cab file and return this cached copy to the browser. It is possible that although the browser detects an outdated version and requests a new copy of the cab file, the request may be fulfilled by the proxy, which may contain a copy of an outdated cab file. In this circumstance, you will not be able to force a client upgrade until the content expiration value of the cached copy of the cab file is reached. In order to prevent this kind of scenario, be sure to set the HTTP content expiration header of the cab file to expire immediately. These should be done as part of your application planning from the beginning. In order to do this:\n\nOpen the IIS console on the webserver.\n\nLocate the XFile cab file in your web application directory.\n\nRight-click on the cab file, choose \"Properties\".\n\nOn the \"HTTP Headers\" tab, check \"Enable Content Expiration\" then check \"Expire Immediately\"\n\nThe following tables list the objects you can create using the <object> tag, the dlls containing the objects, and their classids. Note that the objects of XFileSE and XFileEE have different classids. When setting an object's classid, be careful to set the classid for the version of XFile that you are using.\n\nXFileEE\n\nObjectDllClassidXFRequestXFileEE.dll8B3512EF-4FF5-4aa4-9CDE-56BB03E04B9FAXFFileSAAXFileEE.dll7B7929AB-E06A-4508-BE68-1CC7A6997808AXFFileDownloadSAAXFileEE.dllAD58C149-8AE2-4878-99DC-3A164E32F814AXFFileProgressSAAXFileEE.dll9C6E12BB-F8AE-44aa-9694-9912396B6033XFResumeResume.dll53B29E97-9753-44B4-AE57-D51322B2BD49SoftArtisans ArchiveSAArch.dllD3400FEE-041F-11D3-B1C5-00A0C9B4587ASoftArtisans FileManagerSAFilMgr.dllE7B62F4E-82F4-11D2-BD41-00105A0A7E89\n\nXFileSE\n\nObjectDllClassidXFRequestSAXFile.dllC3A57B60-C117-11D2-BD9B-00105A0A7E89AXFFileSAAXFile.dll230C3D02-DA27-11D2-8612-00A0C93EEA3CAXFFileDownloadSAAXFile.dllB82FA17C-F3A9-11D2-B5DD-0050041B7FF6AXFFileProgressSAAXFile.dllC3EAF164-E06A-11D2-B5C9-0050041B7FF6SoftArtisans ArchiveSAArch.dllD3400FEE-041F-11D3-B1C5-00A0C9B4587ASoftArtisans FileManagerSAFilMgr.dllE7B62F4E-82F4-11D2-BD41-00105A0A7E89"
