Builds have never failed before installing oracle jdk 8, and now they are, yet I haven’t changed anything.\n\nFurthermore, I have many other projects (e.g. 2, 3) that also use oraclejdk8 and build without error.\n\nCan anyone offer insight as to what is going on? For example, why is it the project at 0 the only one to be affected (as far as I can tell)? Why is the build breaking even though I haven’t made changes to the build environment?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nElliot\n\nThanks for all the replies, adding “dist: trusty” fixed my issue.\n\nthe question is: why did my build environment change under my feet? Kind of defeats the purpose if your build environment changes underneath of you without you knowing.\n\nI have many many repositories that use Oracle JDK 8, and only a handful have been affected by this issue: as if some of my environments have been migrated to Xenial, while some have not."
