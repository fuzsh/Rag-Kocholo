Remember that if you are wanting to share a game created DAZ 3D content you will need to buy one or more Game Developer Licenses, and limit the content used to that from vendors covered by the license(s).\n\nThe most versatile and complete 3d animated mesh conversion software is (IMO) Ultimate Unwrap 3D. Its way more than just UV unwrapping. You can convert to almost any animated 3d mesh format and even adjust animations, rigging and joint weighting for comparability.\n\nOther perhaps less versatile but \"slicker\" mesh conversion options include \"DeepMesh 3d\", and \"FragMosoft\". And Blender with plugin.\n\nI did manage to save Sonemasons streets of Asia 2 as an .x file from Carrara and open it in MikuMikuDance as a prop\n\nso know it is possible."
