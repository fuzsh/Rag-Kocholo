It presents the file system as is, without imaginary locations, trashcans etc. XFile uses its own file type/association database in typical Unix/RC like syntax, which is easily editable. Mounting support for file systems defined in fstab, and integration with mount daemons that manage a dedicated media directory is also included.\n\nXFile is easily configurable and customizable with X resources, and has no dependencies, save for X and Motif.\n\nDocumentation and more on the project homepage: https://fastestcode.org/xfile.html\n\nFeatures\n\nFile Manager\n\nSee All Activity >\n\nCategories\n\nFile Managers\n\nLicense\n\nMIT License\n\nFollow XFile - File Manager\n\nXFile - File Manager Web Site\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nA Complete Platform for Home Care Providers\n\nDesigned By Caregivers For Caregivers\n\nSmart, Intuitive, and Affordable – A Complete Platform for Home Care Providers.
