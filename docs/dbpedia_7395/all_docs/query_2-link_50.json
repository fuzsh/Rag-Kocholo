        "text": "What is New in Cisco ISE, Release 2.7?\n\nAuto-Logon of Self-Registered Guest after Sponsor Approval\n\nYou can now enable automatic logon for a self-registered guest after sponsor approval.\n\nBusiness Outcome: The guest user is automatically logged in when the sponsor approves the guest access request. This simplifies the process and improves customer experience.\n\nCisco Support Diagnostics Connector\n\nThe Cisco Support Diagnostics Connector helps Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) and Cisco support engineers to obtain deployment information from the primary administration node.\n\nBusiness Outcome: TAC can now get support information of any particular node in a deployment through the connector. This data enables quicker and better troubleshooting.\n\nCLI Show Logging Enhancement\n\nWhen you run the show logging command in the Command Line Interface (CLI), the content is displayed in the Unix less environment. You can see the supported less commands by typing “H”.\n\nBusiness Outcome: Less is more useful for viewing the content of large files. This saves time when examining log files.\n\nEAP TEAP Support\n\nCisco ISE 2.7 supports the Tunnel Extensible Authentication Protocol (TEAP). The type-length-value (TLV) objects are used within the tunnel to transport authentication-related data between the EAP peer and the EAP server. You can use EAP-MS-CHAPv2 or EAP-TLS as the inner method. EAP chaining is supported for TEAP. EAP chaining allows Cisco ISE to run both the inner methods for user and machine authentication inside the same TEAP tunnel. This enables Cisco ISE to correlate the authentication results and apply the appropriate authorization policy, using the EAPChainingResult attribute.\n\nBusiness Outcome: TEAP is a tunnel-based EAP method that enables secure communication between a peer and a server by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to establish a tunnel and encrypt further communications.\n\nEndpoint Ownership Enhancement\n\nThe Endpoint Ownership information is now stored across all the Policy Service nodes (PSNs) with the help of the Light Session Directory (LSD).\n\nBusiness Outcome: This avoids endpoint ownership flapping.\n\nFeed Service Update\n\nIf you have customized your profiler conditions and do not want the profiler feed to replace those conditions, you can manually download OUI updates without downloading the policy updates.\n\nBusiness Outcome: Improved profiler accuracy with less overhead.\n\nGrace Access\n\nYou can grant 5 to 30 minutes of internet access to self-registered guests who are waiting for sponsor approval to your corporate network.\n\nBusiness Outcome: The guest users can access the internet while waiting for approval.\n\nGuest Password Recovery\n\nYou can now enable the Reset Password option in the Guest portal for self-registered guests. Self-registered guests with valid guest account can use this option when they forget their password. When you click this option, the self-registration page is launched. You can enter your phone number or email address (whichever you are registered with) and enter a new password.\n\nBusiness Outcome: Improves the customer experience and reduces calls to Customer Support team.\n\nInteractive Help\n\nThe Interactive Help provides tips and step-by-step guidance to complete tasks with ease.\n\nBusiness Outcome: This helps the end users to easily understand the work flow and complete their tasks with ease.\n\nPhone Number as the Guest User Identifier\n\nIn addition to email address or username, guest users can now use their phone numbers as their user ID for guest access.\n\nBusiness Outcome: Guest users can now use their mobile numbers as their user ID. This makes it easier for them to remember their user ID.\n\nProfiler Forwarder Persistence Queue\n\nThe Profiler Forwarder Persistence Queue stores incoming events before they are sent to the profiler module for further processing.\n\nBusiness Outcome: This reduces the loss of events due to a sudden burst of events. This queue uses the ISE Messaging Service, and is enabled by default. It requires port 8671 to be open between all Cisco ISE nodes.\n\nRole Based Access Policy\n\nIn the Cisco ISE admin portal, the Policy menu option under Administration > Admin Access > Authorization has been renamed to RBAC Policy. The RBAC Policy window is used to add and configure policies for administrator groups.\n\nSecure SMTP\n\nGuest email notifications can now be sent through a secure SMTP server.\n\nBusiness Outcome: Improved security for Guest emails in your network.\n\nSecure Unlock Client\n\nThe Secure Unlock Client mechanism is used to provide root shell access on Cisco ISE CLI for a certain period of time.\n\nBusiness Outcome: The Secure Unlock client feature has been implemented using the Consent Token tool, which securely grants privileged access for Cisco products in a trusted manner.\n\nTrustSec Enhancements\n\nThe HTTPS REST API replaces the existing RADUIS protocol to provide all the required TrustSec information to the network devices.\n\nBusiness Outcome: It enhances the efficiency and ability to download large configurations in a short period of time as compared to the existing RADIUS protocol.\n\nCaveats\n\nThe Caveats section includes the bug ID and a short description of the bug. For details on the symptoms, conditions, and workaround for a specific caveat, use the Cisco Bug Search Tool (BST).\n\nNote\n\nThe Open Caveats sections list the open caveats that apply to the current release and might apply to releases earlier than Cisco ISE 2.7. A caveat that is open for an earlier release and is still unresolved applies to all future releases until it is resolved.\n\nResolved Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 10\n\nThe following table lists the resolved caveats in Release 2.7 cumulative patch 10.\n\nIdentifier\n\nHeadline\n\nResolved Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 9\n\nThe following table lists the resolved caveats in Release 2.7 cumulative patch 9.\n\nCaveat ID Number\n\nDescription\n\nNew Features in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 8\n\nSupport for Cisco Secure Client\n\nCisco ISE 2.7 Patch 8 supports both AnyConnect and Cisco Secure Client for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. The following Cisco Secure Client versions are supported for these operating systems:\n\nWindows: Cisco Secure Client version 5.00529 and later\n\nmacOS: Cisco Secure Client version 5.00556 and later\n\nLinux: Cisco Secure Client version 5.00556 and later\n\nYou can configure both AnyConnect and Cisco Secure Client for your endpoints on these operating systems but only one policy will be considered at run time for an endpoint.\n\nResolved Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 8\n\nThe following table lists the resolved caveats in Release 2.7 cumulative patch 8.\n\nPatch 8 might not work with older versions of SPW. MAC users must upgrade their SPW to MACOSXSPWizard 2.2.1.43 or later, and Windows users must upgrade their SPW to WinSPWizard 2.2.1.53 or later.\n\nBefore installing Patch 8 on Cisco ISE 2.7 Patch 7, uninstall the hotpatch to fix CSCwa47133 from Patch 7.\n\nIdentifier\n\nHeadline\n\nOpen Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 8\n\nCaveat ID\n\nDescription\n\nResolved Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 7\n\nThe following table lists the resolved caveats in Release 2.7 cumulative patch 7.\n\nPatch 7 might not work with older versions of SPW. MAC users must upgrade their SPW to MACOSXSPWizard 2.2.1.43 or later, and Windows users must upgrade their SPW to WinSPWizard 2.2.1.53 or later.\n\nIdentifier\n\nHeadline\n\nOpen Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 7\n\nCaveat ID Number\n\nDescription\n\nThe following hot patch files are available on CCO for CSCwb29140.\n\nTo install the hot patch:\n\nise-apply-CSCwb29140_2.7.0.356_patch7-SPA.tar.gz\n\nTo rollback the hot patch:\n\nise-rollback-CSCwb29140_2.7.0.356_patch7-SPA.tar.gz\n\nResolved Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 6\n\nThe following table lists the resolved caveats in Release 2.7 cumulative patch 6.\n\nPatch 6 might not work with older versions of SPW. MAC users must upgrade their SPW to MACOSXSPWizard 2.2.1.43 or later, and Windows users must upgrade their SPW to WinSPWizard 2.2.1.53 or later.\n\nCaveat ID Number\n\nDescription\n\nOpen Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 6\n\nThere are no open caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7 Patch 6.\n\nResolved Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 5\n\nThe following table lists the resolved caveats in Release 2.7 cumulative patch 5.\n\nPatch 5 might not work with older versions of SPW. MAC users must upgrade their SPW to MACOSXSPWizard 2.2.1.43 or later, and Windows users must upgrade their SPW to WinSPWizard 2.2.1.53 or later.\n\nNote\n\nIf Cisco ISE patch 5 is installed and rolled back only on the PAN and not on the node that is registered to PAN, the application server on the node will be stuck in the initializing state. You must install and roll back Cisco ISE patch 5 on the node before registering the node to the PAN to avoid this issue.\n\nCaveat ID Number\n\nDescription\n\nOpen Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 5\n\nCaveat ID Number\n\nDescription\n\nNew Features in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 4\n\nFull Upgrade and Split Upgrade Options Added to Cisco ISE GUI\n\nYou can select one of the following options in the Administration > System > Upgrade> Upgrade Selection window to upgrade your Cisco ISE deployment:\n\nFull Upgrade: Full upgrade is a multi-step process that enables a complete upgrade of your Cisco ISE deployment sequentially. This method will upgrade all nodes in parallel and in lesser time compared to the split upgrade process. The application services will be down during this upgrade process because all nodes are upgraded parallelly.\n\nSplit Upgrade: Split upgrade is a multi-step process that enables the upgrade of your Cisco ISE deployment while allowing services to remain available during the upgrade process. This upgrade method allows you to choose the Cisco ISE nodes to be upgraded on your deployment.\n\nLicensing Method for Air-Gapped Networks\n\nSmart Software Manager (SSM) On-Prem is a connection method in which you configure an SSM On-Prem server that manages smart licensing in your Cisco ISE-enabled network. With this connection method, Cisco ISE does not require a persistent connection to the Internet.\n\nFor more information, see the Licensing Chapter in the Cisco Identity Services Engine Administrator Guide.\n\nResolved Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 4\n\nThe following table lists the resolved caveats in Release 2.7 cumulative patch 4.\n\nPatch 4 might not work with older versions of SPW. MAC users must upgrade their SPW to MACOSXSPWizard 2.2.1.43 or later, and Windows users must upgrade their SPW to WinSPWizard 2.2.1.53 or later.\n\nCaveat ID Number\n\nDescription\n\nOpen Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 4\n\nCaveat ID Number\n\nDescription\n\nNew Features in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 3\n\nHealth Check\n\nAn on-demand health check option is introduced to diagnose all the nodes in your deployment. Running a health check on all the nodes prior to any operation helps identify critical issues, if any, that may cause downtime or blocker. Health Check provides the working status of all the dependent components. On failure of a component, it immediately provides troubleshooting recommendations to resolve the issue for a seamless execution of the operation.\n\nEnsure that you run Health Check before initiating the upgrade process.\n\nBusiness Outcome: Identify critical issues to avoid downtime or blockers.\n\nDNS Cache\n\nThe DNS requests for hosts can be cached, thereby reducing the load on the DNS server.\n\nThis feature can be enabled in the configuration mode using the following command:\n\nservice cache enable hosts ttl ttl\n\nTo disable this feature, use the no form of this command.\n\nno service cache enable hosts ttl ttl\n\nAdmin can choose the Time to Live (TTL) value, in seconds, for a host in the cache while enabling the cache. There is no default setting for ttl. The valid range is from 1 to 2147483647.\n\nBusiness Outcome: Load on DNS Server is reduced.\n\nConfigure TCP Parameters\n\nTo configure the TCP parameters use the Configure TCP params option (option 25) in the application configure command. Make sure you are in the Admin CLI.\n\nFor the changes to take effect, reload the Cisco ISE server on modifying any of the parameters using the Admin CLI reload.\n\nExample\n\nTo configure the TCP parameters, use option 25.\n\nise/admin#application configure ise Selection configuration option [1]Reset M&T Session Database [2]Rebuild M&T Unusable Indexes [3]Purge M&T Operational Data [4]Reset M&T Database [5]Refresh Database Statistics [6]Display Profiler Statistics [7]Export Internal CA Store [8]Import Internal CA Store [9]Create Missing Config Indexes [10]Create Missing M&T Indexes [11]Enable/Disable ACS Migration [12]Generate Daily KPM Stats [13]Generate KPM Stats for last 8 Weeks [14]Enable/Disable Counter Attribute Collection [15]View Admin Users [16]Get all Endpoints [17]Enable/Disable Wifi Setup [18]Reset Config Wifi Setup [19]Establish Trust with controller [20]Reset Context Visibility [21]Synchronize Context Visibility With Database [22]Generate Heap Dump [23]Generate Thread Dump [24]Force Backup Cancellation [25]Configure TCP params [0]Exit 25 This CLI allows admins to modify the TCP parameters recycle/reuse/fin_timeout For the changes to take effect, RELOAD ISE server on modifying any of the parameter using the admin cli 'reload'.

Exit [1/2/3/4/0]:\n\nResolved Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 3\n\nThe following table lists the resolved caveats in Release 2.7 cumulative patch 3.\n\nPatch 3 might not work with older versions of SPW. MAC users must upgrade their SPW to MACOSXSPWizard 2.2.1.43 or later, and Windows users must upgrade their SPW to WinSPWizard 2.2.1.53 or later.\n\nCaveat ID Number\n\nDescription\n\nKnown Limitations in Cisco ISE 2.7 Patch 3\n\nChange in SNMP User Password Format and SNMP Hash Minimum Length\n\nAfter applying Cisco ISE 2.7 Patch 3, SNMP user configuration might be removed due to the change in the SNMP user password format. SNMP user passwords are now displayed in hash format. You must reconfigure the SNMP user settings again.\n\nSNMP hash with less than 80 characters will not work and you will see the below error:\n\nsnmp-server user FT10 v3 hash fe7c35f09ff1238e369968a0be273f22 fe7c35f09ff1238e369968a0be273f22 % Error: Decryption Failed. Could not add SNMP User\n\nSpecial Characters Usage Limitations in Name and Description Fields\n\nThe following special characters cannot be used in the Description field for TACACS+ profiles and Device Administration Network conditions: [%\\<>*^:\"|',=/()$.@;&-!#{}.?]. Supported characters are: alphanumeric, underscore(_ ), and space.\n\nThe following special characters cannot be used in the Name and Description fields for Authorization Profiles: %\\<>*^:\\\"|',=. Supported characters for the Name and Description fields are: alphanumeric, hyphen(-), dot(.), underscore(_ ), and space.\n\nThe following special characters cannot be used in the Name and Description fields for Time and Date conditions: [%\\#$&()~+*@{}!/?;:',=^`]\"<>\". Supported characters for the Name and Description fields are: alphanumeric, hyphen(-), dot(.), underscore(_ ), and space.\n\nNew Features in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 2\n\nUser Defined Network\n\nUser Defined Network is a Cisco DNA Center solution. User Defined Network is supported in Cisco ISE Release 2.7 Patch 2 through a hotfix. User Defined Network allows end users to create private networks, or User Defined Network rooms, and group their personal devices.\n\nFor example, a student in a university dorm that has User Defined Network enabled in its network can register their devices and add them to a personal User Defined Network room.\n\nUser Defined Network end users will be able to invite other users to temporarily bring their devices into their User Defined Network room, and vice versa.\n\nTo enable User Defined Network, Cisco ISE must be added to the on-premise Cisco DNA Center account.\n\nValidate the integration of Cisco ISE with Cisco DNA Center from your Cisco ISE administrator portal. Choose Administration > pxGrid Services > All Clients.Choose Administration > pxGrid Services > Client Management > Clients. Cisco DNA Center should appear in the list of pxGrid clients.\n\nWhen the User Defined Network solution is enabled, the Cisco DNA Center Cloud automatically sends to Cisco ISE the configuration information of all the User Defined Network-registered devices on the network. This includes information on the User Defined Network room that each device currently resides in.\n\nCisco ISE then shares this information with the Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) that are configured to be part of the User Defined Network solution. This sharing is accomplished as part of the normal RADIUS protocol exchanges between Cisco ISE and the connected Cisco WLCs.\n\nFor profiling and logging changes in Cisco ISE due to User Defined Network, see the Cisco ISE Administrator Guide for your release. See Chapter \"Segmentation\" for the related profiling changes, and Chapter \"Troubleshooting\" for the related logging changes.\n\nResolved Caveats in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 2\n\nThe following table lists the resolved caveats in Release 2.7 cumulative patch 2.\n\nPatch 2 might not work with older versions of SPW. MAC users must upgrade their SPW to MACOSXSPWizard 2.2.1.43 or later, and Windows users must upgrade their SPW to WinSPWizard 2.2.1.53 or later.\n\nCaveat ID Number\n\nDescription\n\nNew Features in Cisco ISE Release 2.7.0.356 - Cumulative Patch 1\n\nMulti-DNAC Support\n\nCisco DNA Center systems cannot scale to more than the range of 25 to 100 thousand endpoints. Cisco ISE can scale to two million endpoints. Currently, you can only integrate one Cisco DNA Center system with one Cisco ISE system. Large Cisco ISE deployments can benefit by integrating multiple DNA Center clusters with a single Cisco ISE. Cisco now supports multiple Cisco DNA center clusters per Cisco ISE deployment, also known as Multi-DNAC.\n\nBusiness Outcome: This feature for the Access Control app in Cisco DNA Center allows you to integrate up to four Cisco DNA Center clusters with a single Cisco ISE system.\n\nCisco AI Endpoint Analytics Support\n\nCisco AI Endpoint Analytics is a solution on Cisco DNA Center that improves endpoint profiling fidelity. It provides fine-grained endpoint identification and assigns labels to various endpoints. Information gathered through deep packet inspection, and probes from sources like Cisco ISE, Cisco SD-AVC, and network devices, is analyzed for endpoint profiling.\n\nCisco AI Endpoint Analytics also uses artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to intuitively group endpoints with similar attributes. IT administrators can review such groups and assign labels to them. These endpoint labels are then available in Cisco ISE if your Cisco ISE account is connected to an on-premise Cisco DNA Center.\n\nThese endpoint labels from Cisco AI Endpoint Analytics can be used by Cisco ISE administrators to create custom authorization policies.
