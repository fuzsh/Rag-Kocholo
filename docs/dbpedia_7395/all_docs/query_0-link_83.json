        "text": "frestepi — Jan 19, 2023\n\nThis App Is A Must-Have\n\nIf you know what DaisyDisk is, then you know how amazing it is... But if you DON'T know what it is, then just know that it's worth getting 100%. DaisyDisk allows you to EASILY see what files are taking up your disk space and WHERE they are located. I use it to locate large files, archive them if needed, then once youre done you can move it all to the \"collector\" and delete them, effectively freeing up more HD space. I am a creative and use my local disk for apps and current projects. But I only have 1 tb and it fills fast. Daisy Disk allows me to quickly browse all my folders based on their disk size and nuke what's not necessary. It has saved me SOOO much time when managing my hard drive storage. It sounds like a boring app, but trust me... it is a Must-Have app for everyone. I can't believe Apple hasn't bought them out and made it a default app on new Macs.\n\nUberMuffinPwning — Dec 28, 2022\n\nThe Best Disk Cleaner Hands Down\n\nI purchased this app years ago when decluttering an old personal MacBook and it has been a staple on any Mac device that I own. As a photographer, it is easy to lose track of how large some folders of images can get, so this helps me narrow down what is taking up the majority of my hard drive so I can get it offloaded onto a backup drive and keep working without worrying about running out of space. This app has paid for itself time and time again.\n\nKaisertod — Jan 19, 2023\n\nIntuitive and effective\n\nI have used a TON of apps to try and reclaim drivespace, and DaisyDisk is by far the most intuitive and effective. I just reclaimed 496GB of space on my primary disk, and I thought it was being eaten up by sample libraries, where in fact it was being eatn up by old backups of huge projects. I never would have found them, they were nested so deeply, but DaisyDisk immediately led me to the problem and gave me a fast solution. Highly recommended.\n\nTheNameIsPeter — Jan 18, 2023\n\nRest assured you will free up space.\n\nI can't think of any way to write a positive review for this without sounding at least somewhat like a bot or a shill. No matter what anyone tells you, it is not capable of clearing up most of your storage. That being said- it is most definitely able to clear up SOME. With my 256 GB Macbook Air, I had just a few gigs left and was desperately looking for a solution. I spent hours avoiding these 'analyzer' apps but my other research was to no avail. I scoured the internet, particularly on Reddit and other forum boards and concluded that this was the most reputable one. The $14 CAD was a complete gamble, but I was prepared to purchase a new laptop anyway so it was a marginally small cost. Perhaps it was because I entered with zero expectations that I was blown out of the park with the results. I managed to locate several cache folders amounting to over 60 GB of space. This is merely 25% of my entire disk storage, but for $14 CAD I consider that an absolute deal. People who claim it \"tells you only what you know\" are fools who can't infer which folders can be deleted and which can't. For example, my main issue was Telegram caches. My built-in software only indicated the memory space of the Telegram application itself, not its caches (which I have now removed, and as mentioned on Telegram's site, your data is still stored in the cloud). That concludes my review. Peace out"
