        "text": "Apogee enables you to keep track of all required steps in the prepress process working from one place. Extended JDF and JMF support also improves the connection between software and devices, and thus the communication with the user. Moreover, Apogee users can now split JDF files, making your production process easier than ever.\n\nThanks to its unique Digital Quick Strip (DQS) mechanism, Apogee provides you with unprecedented efficiency and user-friendliness. It lets you process each page separately before integrating it into a place holder, which turns page revision into a swift and simple task. As your layout is also rendered as a separate file, updating it only takes a few minutes. By relying on DQS, you increase throughput and optimize the usage of all available output resources.\n\nAccessible automation is part of the Apogee DNA: The user interface offers multiple ways to automate standard and repetitive tasks such as job archival and deletion. You can also effortlessly set up page placement rules according to naming conventions. Automation is now lifted to the next level with ATP or Automate Task Processor. Using an interface, rules are defined to take action depending on a pageâs content or meta data.Â This means that pages and orders can be routed to specific production plans. In case of a high copy count, an order is sent to your offset press. A digital job may be split between your B&W and color digital presses to guarantee the lowest possible production cost. ATP is not limited to the rules set in the interface. If dedicated actions need to be taken, specific scripts can be written and added. This leads to the highest possible degree of automation of your prepress production.\n\nApogee can combine print jobs intelligently to optimize press time while keeping track of the actual order. It caters to the needs of printers faced with shortening run lengths and looking for ways to keep their presses running as efficiently as possible to maintain sustainable margins. The automation goes beyond combining orders (or parts of orders) on a single press sheet. Apogee makes it easy to still keep track of the separate orders and allows for proper finishing. Collation marks, signature barcodes and all other marks remain in place and refer to the original order."
