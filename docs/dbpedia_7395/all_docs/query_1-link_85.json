        "text": "Alright, I'm feeling excited about this. No, really. There aren't a ton of games based on The X-Files. There's a PlayStation/PC game that's good, a PlayStation 2 game that's way overpriced, and a J2ME game that I can't find. I don't know what to expect from these DVD games.\n\nRight away there's a problem. Shockwave is required but not included on the DVD. The URL it's looking for is long gone.\n\nThis is not a crisis though as everything is on archive.org. I would not install something from archive.org on a PC I cared about but this is a virtual machine.\n\nThe loading screen, which I suspect isn't loading anything at all, has a book ad. The X-Files was lacking in video games but definitely not in books about the lore or episode guides.\n\nAt the beginning you need to register a name. I don't think anything you enter here matters.\n\nI found the interface confusing. You land on a map with this PDA device on the right. None of the buttons on it go anywhere that makes sense. I think clicking on the blinking red dot is the right way to start.\n\nOK, getting somewhere.. that goes to a screen with some case files to review and an obvious link to follow.\n\nThis leads to a quiz screen. I looked up this answer on the internet, on the internet I tell you, and it was wrong. Maybe multiple dates were given throughout the run of the show and the internet only has a \"canon\" answer that is different than the \"canon\" answer when this DVD was produced. No worries though because clicking the submit link enough times eventually advances the game.\n\nNext there are some autopsy reports to review. It turns out you need to because there are trivia questions about them later. See that little puzzle piece in the corner... every time one appears it needs to be dragged into the black box on the PDA. This stores it for later use.\n\nA few more reports to read through and we'll be on to the first puzzle.\n\nBefore that - a quiz about something in the autopsy reports. There are a couple different questions but they are all easy like this.\n\nThe first puzzle involves decoding words inscribed in code on the infamous metal implants. It starts with one example translation.\n\nClicking on the letter grid shows a second example. Neat, also helpful.\n\nOK, the book tie-in is coming together now. The solutions are all references to things in episode scripts. All the episode transcripts can be found online now, hosted by a page owned by the same corporate overlord that owns GameFAQs.\n\nAfter solving a puzzle, the names need to be dragged over to the empty box on the PDA thing. They then appear in the evidence bin.\n\nWith those strings decoded, it's time to move on to the next case.\n\nA new map destination can now be reached. It's possible to return to the previous case if (like me) you missed a puzzle piece.\n\nOn the second quiz I found it is a little picky about how answers are worded.\n\nThis leads to the second set of case files.\n\nI don't know what's going on here. The map now has all kinds of points. The red ones are travel locations and the orange ones are.. uh, I guess links to episode recaps?\n\nChoosing the next map destination leads to another quiz.\n\nThis next game is difficult and likely would have been a nightmare on a Windows 98 PC. I was only able to solve it through the magic of screenshots, resizing, and color adjustments. All those could be done on Windows 98, it's just a lot easier 25 years later.\n\nThe audio itself is just static. The goal is to find hidden words in the audio analysis. A colorblind person could not handle this puzzle. I had to capture and enhance the image to find it.\n\nSolving it creates another piece of evidence. It's also clear at this point that these solutions will be keywords from episodes.\n\nSeriously, how are you supposed to see this?\n\nThis one doesn't even enhance well. It looks like \"MOW SIGMAI\" to me.\n\nThe next one is at least easy to make out if you mess around with the colors.\n\nHere are all the solutions so you don't have to figure them out if you ever play this.\n\nOK, on to the next case file.\n\nTime for another trivia question.\n\nThere are some new photos to review.\n\nAnd one more trivia question.\n\nThis puzzle can... well, I'll try to keep this site as clean as I can. Let's say this is a no good puzzle that I don't care for. It involves decoding a message inscribed on a tissue sample.\n\nAfter staring at it a while, I decided to start at the root node and go left for a 0 and right for a 1. When it hits a terminating node that means we've found the letter.\n\nAlright, that produced a name which is good. Since I'm so nice, here's a list of all the letters:\n\nThis approach did not pan out for the other two codes.\n\nLuckily, once you solve the first you can assume what the other names might be based on the episode it's referencing.\n\nNow we have a whole bunch of evidence. It turns out none of it really matters. Solving the game just requires finding all the puzzle pieces.\n\nWhile clicking through everything again to find puzzle pieces I missed, I ran into another trivia question.\n\nOnce you have all the puzzle pieces you go to the clueboard and assemble them.\n\nSo this looks totally finished to me.\n\nThe game disagreed though and said I only had 34 of 35 pieces.\n\nAfter taking every piece off.. and clicking the submit button after re-adding each piece to make sure the count incremented.. the game is over.\n\nThose were some obtuse puzzles. Not the worst ever, just kind of mildly confusing. I wonder if this improves in the later games...\n\nRelated\n\nAll source code and software on this site is distributed under The MIT License (copyright 2000-2024 Hugues Johnson) unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll other content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll opinions on this site reflect my personal views and do not represent views of my current, or any former, employer.\n\nSite theme is based on Bootstrap licensed under The MIT License.
