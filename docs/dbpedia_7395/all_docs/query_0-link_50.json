In the future, information about obtaining NetWare and related networking products as well as electronic request forms will be available on the LAN Support page. Until that time, support providers may call the Support Center at 855-6789, choose option 4 and ask for the LAN Lab to obtain the software or send email to lansup@indiana.edu.\n\nThe 5-user version of NetWare 4.x for personal use is available. Because the 4.x files are installed from a shared CD, individuals wishing to obtain a personal copy for personal servers should contact the Support Center to arrange lab time to install their copy. The 5-user version of NetWare 3.12 is not available."
