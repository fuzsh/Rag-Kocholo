Scully catches Mulder looking at a model in a 'girlie' magazine, which he attempts to cover up by saying she was an abductee.\n\nBeyond the Sea - Scully tells him \"Last time you were that engrossed, it turned out you were reading the Adult Video News\"\n\nBlood - Mulder tells the Lone Gunmen that he must have overlooked their August issue because it arrived on the same day as his issue of \"Celebrity Skin\".\n\nOne Breath - Can't tell for sure, but what was that tape he was watching when he gets the call that Scully has reappeared?\n\nExcelsius Dei - Mulder claims that the tape Scully found in the VCR wasn't his, and she replies that she put it back in the drawer with the rest of the tapes that aren't his\n\nPaper Clip - Mulder tells Frohike that the he will have to wait a little bit longer for Mulder's video collection (implying that Mulder will leave it to him when he dies).\n\nD.P.O. - Upon finding Darren's copy of Playboy, Mulder comments (at Scully's jibe) that he already has that issue\n\nClyde Bruckman's Final Repose - While attempting to find Claude Dukenfield's body, Bruckman casually comments to Mulder that while there are worse ways to go, he can't think of anything less dignified than auto-erotic asphyxiation. Mulder, confused by this turn of topic, asks why Bruckman is telling him this, to which Bruckman quickly replies that it's none of his business and to forget that he mentioned it. While I doubt Mulder will really meet his end this way, I think that Bruckman choosing this way to rattle Mulder is a semi-reference to Mulder's porn-habit.\n\nNisei - after asking Scully to watch a video \"that came in the mail\", she mentions that \"it's not your usual brand of entertainment\".\n\nPusher - after being fitted with the 2-lux video camera, Mulder asks \"Think I can get the Playboy Channel?\"\n\nSmall Potatoes - Eddie (as the faux Mulder) finds an answering machine message to Mulder from a phone-sex company\n\nChinga - Mulder is watching a suspiciously pornographic-sounding tape titled \"Alien Probe\"\n\nAll Souls - Mulder hurries Scully so he can return to \"A Decade of Dirty Delinquents\"\n\nThe End - so it isn't porn, but it is rather telling when the mind-reading kid informs Mulder that \"You've got a dirty mind\"\n\nDreamland I - Mulder settles down for a good night's sleep to the soothing sounds of the porn station SIZL\n\nDreamland II - Mulder's long-lost bedroom is filled with boxes of files and at least one copy of \"PlayPen\".\n\nThe UnNatural - Mulder mentiones his \"obscenely overdue triple-X bill\" during his list of things that baseball makes you forget\n\nHollywood A.D. - while talking about ambient sounds we usually tune out, Chuck Burks mentions the sound of \"Mulder's porn tapes on pause\".\n\n(Season 1: 2 / Season 2: 3 / Season 3: 4 / Season 4: 1 / Season 5: 2 / Season 6: 3 / Season 7: 1)\n\nDanny & Chuck Burks Sightings!\n\nWhile not as well-known as the Lone Gunmen, Mulder does have other friends that he calls on to help him out from time-to-time. Mulder's oft-called but never seen friend Danny has helped Mulder and Scully through many-a-case. Here's a look at some of his \"appearances\"...\n\nConduit - Mulder faxes a page of Kevin's ones & zeros to \"Danny Bernstein\", who agrees to check it out in exchange for tickets to a Redskins game.\n\nThe Erlenmeyer Flask - Mulder calls Danny to run a partial license plate for him.\n\nThe Erlenmeyer Flask - Mulder calls Danny again, this time to track down the address for a telephone number (for Zeus Storage). Note: this marks the only time we get to hear Danny's voice.\n\nAubrey - Scully(!) calls Danny (although this time his last name is Valladeo(?)) for help in checking out adoption records.\n\nOur Town - Mulder had Danny run a search on all missing persons last seen within a 200 mile radius of the town.\n\nAvatar - Mulder calls on Danny to attempt to identify the face from the airbag.\n\nWetWired - Mulder has Danny research the calls last made from the faux-doctor's hotel room.\n\nLeonard Betts - Scully has Danny run Leonard Betts' fingerprints - leading them to his \"Albert Tanner\" alter ego.\n\nChristmas Carol - Scully calls on Danny to send her the case files on her sister Melissa.\n\nRoadrunners - Doggett(!) calls Danny\n\n(Season 1: 3 / Season 2: 2 / Season 3: 1 / Season 4: 1 / Season 5: 1 / Season 6: 0 / Season 7: 0 / Season 8: 1)\n\nAnother of Mulder's friends, Chuck Burks, is only called in when the case is extremely weird and Chuck's \"special talents\" are in order.\n\nThe Calusari\n\nLeonard Betts\n\nBiogenesis\n\nHollywood A.D.\n\nBadlaa\n\n(Season 1: 0 / Season 2: 1 / Season 3: 0 / Season 4: 1 / Season 5: 0 / Season 6: 1 / Season 7: 1 / Season 8: 1)\n\nWhen bad things happen to a good boss (Skinner, of course)\n\nEnd Game - fights with Mr. X\n\nAnasazi - Mulder punches him\n\nThe Blessing Way - Scully pulls her gun on him\n\nPaper Clip - Scully and Mulder point their guns at him, he later gets beat up in a stairwell\n\nPiper Maru - Shot in the stomach by Luis Cardinal\n\nApocrypha - assassination attempt by Luis Cardinal\n\nPusher - beaten up by secretary\n\nAvatar - accused of murder\n\nUnrequited - grazed by a bullet\n\nZero Sum - set up by Cancerman, Mulder points his gun at him, altogether a bad situation for Skinner\n\nRedux - Scully believes that Skinner is the one who gave her cancer\n\nRedux II - Blevins asks Mulder to implicate Skinner in the investigation\n\nThe Beginning - Repremanded for helping Mulder\n\nSR 819 - nearly killed by Alex Krycek and nanotechnology\n\nBiogenesis - Krycek cashes in on his nanotechnology threat\n\nThe Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati - attacked by Krycek in his office\n\nWithout - attacked and injured by the caustic blood of the Alien Bounty Hunter\n\nExistence - Alien-Billy Miles hits Skinner in the head (Season 1: 0 / Season 2: 2 / Season 3: 6 / Season 4: 2 / Season 5: 2 / Season 6: 3 / Season 7: 1 / Season 8: 2)\n\nWhat do you call a man without a name?\n\nThis is a compilation of the names that our agents and their associates have called the man billed in the credits as \"The Cigarette Smoking Man\".\n\nOne Breath - \"Cancer Man\" (twice) by Mulder\n\nOne Breath - \"The Cancer Man\" by Skinner\n\nOne Breath - \"You son of a bitch\" by Mulder\n\nAnasazi - \"black lunged son of a bitch\" by Mulder\n\nPaper Clip - \"Double-Crossing son of a bitch\" by Krycek\n\nPaper Clip - \"you son of a bitch\" by Skinner\n\nPaper Clip - \"your cigarette smoking friend\" by Mulder\n\nWetWired - \"Cancer Man\" by Scully\n\nTalitha Cumi - \"The Smoking Man\" by Mulder\n\nTalitha Cumi - \"The Cancer Man\" by Mr. X\n\nMusings of a Cigarette Smoking Man - \"Cancer Man\" by Mulder\n\nMemento Mori - \"Cigarette Man\" by Mulder\n\nMemento Mori - \"our chain-smoking friend\" by Mulder\n\nZero Sum - \"the Smoking Man\" by Mulder\n\nRedux II - \"Smoking Man\" by Skinner\n\nThe End - \"Old Smokey\" by Mulder\n\nTwo Fathers - \"Cigarette Smoking Man\" by Scully\n\nTwo Fathers - \"Smokey\" by Mulder\n\nTwo Fathers - \"The Smoking Man\" by Mulder\n\nOne Son - the \"Biggest Bastard of All\" by Cassandra\n\nOne Son - \"C.G.B.\" by Mulder\n\nOne Son - \"The Cigarette Smoking Man\" by Mulder\n\nEn Ami - \"Smoking Man\" by Mulder\n\nRequiem - \"Cigarette Smoking Man\" by Marita\n\nRequiem - \"Cancerman\" by Marita\n\nRequiem - \"Cigarette Smoking son of a bitch\" by Krycek\n\n(Season 1: 0 / Season 2: 4 / Season 3: 6 / Season 4: 4 / Season 5: 2 / Season 6: 8 / Season 7: 4)\n\nMulder's slide shows\n\nYou know them.

It has been requested by various people down through the seasons, and I've always avoided adding it here -- partially because some blunders are open to interpretation (especially with the now-muddled mythology), but mostly because I like to keep a positive feel to my website, and this one is pretty negative. However, comments made by the powers-that-be during Season 8 made me feel that maybe this list does need to be available for all to see -- maybe those guys need to be reminded that we do indeed keep up with this stuff. I'm not aiming to list every nitpick, just what I consider to be the \"big blunders\" and inconsistencies between episodes and plot points.\n\nWhere Scully's cross necklace came from:\n\nOriginal: \"Ascension\" - given to her on her 15th birthday\n\nBlunder: \"Christmas Carol\" - given to her at Christmas\n\nAttempt at Explanation: maybe she broke one, and was given another?\n\nTruth: The writers knew that they were messing up the history when they changed the cross-backstory, but thought it was \"too good of an opportunity to pass up\". I personally wish that they had passed. How long was Scully missing during her abduction:\n\nOriginal: \"Duane Barry\"/\"One Breath\" - Abducted in August, returned in November\n\nBlunder: \"Emily\" - missing for 4 weeks!\n\nAttempt at Explanation: Perhaps her file said that she was only missing for 4 weeks because she had 2 months vacation saved up???\n\nMulder's regression on 6/16/1989:\n\nOriginal: \"Conduit\" - audiotape contains Mulder speaking about being in bed - only able to hear Samantha call his name, he cannot see her\n\nBlunder: \"Closure\" - videotape contains Mulder describing the abduction as first seen in \"Little Green Men\"\n\nAttempt at Explanation: I was willing to believe that using different regression techniques might provide different answers, and was always willing to believe that the scenes from \"Little Green Men\" were more accurate than those from \"Conduit\" - coming from a Mulder who had recovered more of his memories with time than the one on the audiotape from 1989, but \"Closure\" attempted to \"do-over\" what had occurred in \"Conduit\", which I think is sloppy storytelling.\n\nWas Samantha alive:\n\nOriginal: \"End Game\" - bounty hunter tells Mulder she is alive, female clones say that they know so much about her because they know where she is.\n\nOriginal: \"The Blessing Way\" - Bill Mulder's \"spirit\" tells Mulder that Sam is not dead.\n\nOriginal: \"Paper Clip\" - there is a recent tissue sample in Samantha's file.\n\nOriginal: \"Two Fathers\" - Cassandra tells Mulder that Samantha did not visit Mulder in \"Redux II\", that the \"real\" Samantha is with \"the aliens\".\n\nBlunder: \"Closure\" - shows the \"ghost\" of Samantha, who has been dead since she was 14.\n\nAttempt at Explanation: I realize that some of these -- particularly the Cassandra & bounty hunter ones, could have easily been them lying or simply not knowing the truth. But the tissue sample in particular was such a cool plot-point at the time -- seems like such a shame to ruin it all by having her be dead all these years.\n\nDana Scully: the first woman to be pregnant for 12 months\n\nOriginal: \"Within/Without\" - Mulder's rental car receipts from just before he disappeared are dated in May (and Scully discovered she was pregnant right after his disappearance)\n\nOriginal: \"The Gift\" - Skinner states that Mulder has been missing since \"last May\"\n\nBlunder: \"Redrum\" - Date-stamps galore place this episode in December (thus Scully, who conceived in May at the latest, is seven months pregnant and not showing during this episode)\n\nBlunder: \"Medusa\" - getting home to watch \"Survivor II\" is mentioned -- episodes of \"Survivor II\" started airing in February -- which makes her 9 months pregnant and still not showing in this episode.\n\nAttempt at Explanation: Alien babies have a 12 month gestation period? All kidding aside, there really is no explanation for this one -- the guys at 1013 just hope we won't notice.\n\nMulder in Jeopardy, with Scully to the rescue:\n\nDeep Throat\n\nThe Jersey Devil\n\nTooms\n\nGhost in the Machine\n\nErlenmeyer Flask\n\nLittle Green Men\n\nRed Museum\n\nExcelsius Dei\n\nAubrey\n\nColony/End Game\n\nDod Kalm (kinda)\n\nAnasazi\n\nClyde Bruckman's Final Repose\n\n731 (over the phone)\n\nPusher\n\nHome\n\nTeliko (cool drool!)\n\nDemons\n\nDetour\n\nKitsunegari\n\nKill Switch\n\nBad Blood\n\nFolie A Deux\n\nTriangle\n\nThe Sixth Extinction parts I & II\n\nMillennium\n\nSigns & Wonders\n\nFirst Person Shooter\n\n(Season 1: 5 / Season 2: 7 / Season 3: 3 / Season 4: 3 / Season 5: 5 / Season 6: 1 / Season 7: 4)\n\nScully in Jeopardy, with Mulder to the rescue:\n\nSqueeze\n\nGenderbender\n\nLazarus\n\nShapes\n\nDuane Barry/Ascension/One Breath\n\nFirewalker (but she handles it herself)\n\nIrresistible\n\nEnd Game\n\nOur Town\n\nBlessing Way/Paper Clip (but Skinner would never hurt her, right?)\n\nWet Wired\n\nUnruhe\n\nMemento Mori (well, he sends Byers)\n\nRedux II\n\nThe Movie (in a big way)\n\nMilagro (although he doesn't make it in time)\n\nOrison (but she handled it herself)\n\nSigns & Wonders\n\nTheef\n\n(Season 1: 4 / Season 2: 5 / Season 3: 2 / Season 4: 2 / Season 5: 1 / Season 6: 2 / Season 7: 2)\n\nTag Line Changes\n\nEvery so often the line 'The Truth Is Out There' during the opening theme is changed. Here are the changes so far:\n\nThe Erlenmeyer Flask - Trust No One\n\nAscension - Deny Everything\n\nAnasazi - EL 'AANIGOO 'AHOOT'E\n\n731 - Apology is Policy\n\nHerrenvolk - Everything Dies\n\nTeliko - Deceive, Inveigle, Obfuscate\n\nTerma - E Pur Si Muove\n\nGethsemane - Believe the Lie\n\nRedux - All Lies Lead to the Truth\n\nThe Red and the Black - Resist or Serve\n\nThe End - The End\n\nTriange - DIE WAHRHEIT IST IRGENDWO DA DRAUßEN\n\nThe Unnatural - In the Big Inning\n\nThe Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati - Amor Fati\n\nClosure - Believe to Understand\n\nNothing Important Happened Today Part 2 - Nothing Important Happened Today\n\n4-D -\n\nTrust No 1 - They're Watching\n\nImprobable - Dio Ti Ama\n\n(Season 1: 1 / Season 2: 2 / Season 3: 1 / Season 4: 4 / Season 5: 3 / Season 6: 2 / Season 7: 2 / Season 8: 0 / Season 9: 4)\n\n(Please see the season-based in-jokes pages by episode title for further information/definitions on the tag line changes.)"
