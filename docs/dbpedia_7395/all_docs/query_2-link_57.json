        "text": "Season 10, Episode 1: “My Struggle”\n\nWhen I heard that “The X-Files” was coming back to TV, it was like hearing that I would see some dear old friends again. I spent every Friday night of my young adulthood with Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. News of their coming six-week mini-series started me on a mega rewatch — I mainlined the original episodes in five-hour chunks.\n\nDespite the problems with this episode, which may have been more evident to me because I tend to like the stand-alone story lines as opposed to the mythology arcs, it was thrilling to hear Mark Snow’s spine-tingling theme and to see the opening credits unchanged from their original form. And the connection between Mulder and Scully, though it has frayed through the years, is still strong. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson have moved on to other roles, but they have not been able to completely shed these skins.\n\nScully was still sporting her small gold cross and improbable heels. Mulder was still cocooned in the Kaczynski-esque existence in which we last saw him in “X-Files: I Want to Believe,” the grim 2008 movie that focused on a clairvoyant pedophile priest. From that film, we confirmed that Mulder and Scully’s professional relationship had grown into a personal partnership and that they had a son together. Here, we learn right away that they are no longer a couple.\n\nScully and Mulder are now in an uncomfortable place. And so is this unsatisfying episode. When young Mulder was spouting his conspiracy theories, those ideas were rebellious and exciting. He made a skeptical Scully want to believe because he did. And he believed because he had seen the most incredible things, and they didn’t make him afraid, only more determined to find the truth, which (let us not forget) was out there."
