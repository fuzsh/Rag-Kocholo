Choose the Personal license if you plan to use it as a solo user and use the end product only for your own commercial profit.

A "user" is anyone using Frames X files and products, either as an editor or as a user of an entitled Team, Corporation, Agency, or any other form of organization where the files are published, inspected, and edited as Figma UI assets.

Important note: You can share access to the Figma files or publish the Frames X product as a library and share it with other users ONLY if you've bought a Team or Unlimited license!

A personal license gives you the right to use Frames X products for a set period for your personal and commercial projects. The active license grants you the right to receive updates and support via direct email.

Due to the nature of digital products, after the license expires, the user can still use the Frames X products in their current state without being able to access new functionality or features.

Retaining the files, however, still obligates the user to bond to the following license.

Important Note: The expired license does not grant you any rights to use Frames X in commercial projects, so all work done after the license expires will be considered BuninUX LLC's intellectual property.
