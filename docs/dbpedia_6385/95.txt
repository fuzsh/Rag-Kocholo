Sagina is a Hindi film from 1974 directed by Tapan Sinha and starring the legendary duo Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu. The film is a social drama that portrays the struggles of the working-class people in India during the post-independence era. The plot revolves around the life of Sagina Mahato, a poor worker from West Bengal who dreams of owning his land and house.

Sagina's story begins with his introduction as a lone survivor of his family. He works in a jute mill where he faces exploitation and poverty. He shares a small house with other workers and is always in search of some extra money to support his family. Sagina's only hope is to purchase the same mill where he works, but it seems impossible as the owner is a cruel and manipulative person who has no regards for the workers' welfare.

The story takes a turn when Sagina comes across Ganguli, a businessmen who is looking to purchase the jute mill. Sagina seeks his help in buying the mill but soon realizes that Ganguli is not interested in helping the workers but only looking to make profit out of the situation. Sagina then decides to take matters into his own hands and starts a movement to unite the workers against the mill's owner and bring about a change.

Throughout the film, Dilip Kumar does a commendable job portraying Sagina's character, a man who is kind-hearted, honest, and determined to bring justice to his fellow workers. Saira Banu plays the role of Sagina's love interest, Renu, who supports him throughout his struggles. The chemistry between the two actors is heartwarming, and their scenes together are some of the film's most memorable moments.

Apart from Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu, the film's supporting cast also delivers a fantastic performance. Aparna Sen, who plays the daughter of the mill's owner, brings out the stark contrast between the rich and the poor in the film. Her character undergoes a transformation throughout the story, realizing the plight of the workers and ultimately joining Sagina's movement. The other actors who played the roles of the workers in the mill also did a fine job, showcasing the harsh realities of their lives.

The music of the film is another highlight, with songs composed by Salil Choudhary and lyrics by Yogesh. The songs are melodious and uplifting, doing justice to the film's theme of hope and resilience. The title song, âSagina Mahato,â sung by Kishore Kumar, is particularly memorable and remains popular to this day.

Overall, Sagina is a thought-provoking film that sheds light on the underprivileged working-class people of India. It emphasizes the importance of unity, determination, and hope in the face of adversity. The film's realistic portrayal of the workers' struggles and Dilip Kumar's exceptional performance make it a must-watch for fans of Hindi cinema.
