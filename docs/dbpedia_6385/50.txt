Sagina Mahato is a 1971 Indian Bengali-language political drama film directed by Tapan Sinha. The film stars Bollywood legends Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu with Anil Chatterjee in a pivotal role. The movie was based on the novel Sagina Mahato written by Gour Kishore Ghosh. The story of the film is set in the pre-independence era of India, where Sagina Mahato, the protagonist, is a labourer in a tea plantation in rural Bengal. The plantation is owned by the British, and Sagina is exploited and oppressed by his British employers. He leads a life of severe poverty and suffering, making just enough money to survive. Despite the harsh treatment at the hands of his British employers, Sagina remains hopeful for a better future.

The story takes a turn when Sagina meets a village girl named Durga, played by Saira Banu. Durga is a fearless and confident woman who motivates Sagina to fight against the oppression and injustice that he has endured for years. Under her guidance, Sagina initiates a fight against the British plantation owners to stand up for his rights and the rights of his fellow labourers. The struggle he leads, along with his comrades, brings them face to face with the ruthless British authorities and makes the lives of Sagina and his comrades far more challenging.

The story of Sagina Mahato is a portrayal of poverty, oppression, and exploitation of the working class. The film highlights the lack of respect and dignity for labour in a capitalist society that values profits over people. Dilip Kumar's character Sagina is a representation of the struggles of the working class who are at the mercy of their wealthy employers. Sagina's struggle to gain respect and dignity for himself and his fellow labourers is a powerful statement of hope for the working classes at a time when India was fighting for its independence.

The film effectively presents the social and economic conditions of the time and the struggles of the grassroots labour movement. The film showed the power of collective action that the workers can take against their well-indulged capitalists. In many ways, Sagina Mahato can be considered as an exultant political and social commentary that reflected the societal situation of India during its pre-independence era.

The performances of Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu are exemplary in this film. Dilip Kumar brings Sagina to life with his nuanced and immersive performance that portrayed the hardships of his character with utmost conviction. Saira Banu, on the other hand, plays the bold village girl, Durga, with the right amount of confidence and assertiveness. Her performance showcased her talent and versatility as an actress.

Anil Chatterjee also played a significant role as Advocate Biswanath, who is a lawyer that supports the workers in their struggle for their rights. His character provides legal assistance to the working class and creates awareness about the law among the exploited workers.

The music in the film, composed by Salil Chowdhary, is another highlight of Sagina Mahato. The songs "Chal Chal Re Naujawan" and "Babul Mora Naihar Chhooto Hi Jaye" are still loved and cherished by audiences all over the country.

In conclusion, the film Sagina Mahato is a poignant political drama that portrays the struggles of the working class during pre-independence India. The film is both an eye-opener and a call to action for people to stand up and fight against oppression and injustice. With exemplary acting by Dilip Kumar, Saira Banu, and Anil Chatterjee, and fantastic music by Salil Chowdhary, the film remains one of the most powerful cinematic declarations on social justice in Indian cinema.
