        "text": "Indian film director\n\nFor the Indian Navy vice admiral, see Tapan Sinha (admiral).\n\nTapan Sinha (2 October 1924 – 15 January 2009)[1] was one of the most prominent Indian film directors of his time forming a legendary quartet with Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen. He was primarily a Bengali filmmaker who worked both in Hindi cinema and Bengali cinema, directing films like Kabuliwala (1957), Louha-Kapat, Sagina Mahato (1970), Apanjan (1968), Kshudhita Pashan and children's film Safed Haathi (1978) and Aaj Ka Robinhood. Sinha started his career in 1946, as a sound engineer with New Theatres film production house in Kolkata, then in 1950 left for England where he worked at Pinewood Studios for next two years,[2] before returning home to start his six decade long career in Indian cinema, making films in Bengali, Hindi and Oriya languages, straddling genres from social realism, family drama, labor rights, to children's fantasy films. He was one of the acclaimed filmmakers of Parallel Cinema movement of India.[3][4][5]\n\nPersonal life and background\n\n[edit]\n\nSinha was born in Kolkata, West Bengal. His empathy for films began from his student life. He was admitted in the Durgacharan M. E. School of Bhagalpur in the fifth standard. Later it went on to become a secondary school. His Principal was Surendranath Gangopadhyay who happened to be Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's maternal uncle.[6] He studied physics at the University of Patna and later earned an M.Sc at the Rajabazar Science College, University of Calcutta.[7]\n\nHe married Indian actress Arundhati Devi. Their son is Indian scientist professor, Anindya Sinha.\n\nOn 15 January 2009, he died of pneumonia and septicaemia.[8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nCharles Dickens's novel, A Tale of Two Cities and the cinematic adaptation featuring Ronald Colman inspired Sinha to get involved in film-making. Tapan Sinha went to London in the 1950s to learn film-making. On reaching London, he contacted CryHearsth, Manager of Pinewood Studios. Through his help, he managed to obtain his first assignment. He got to work in director Charles Crichton's unit as a sound engineer. Cryton, who made some British comedies like The Lavender Hill Mob etc. was then working for a film called The Hunted. Sinha started as a sound recording engineer and gradually shifted to directing.\n\nTapan Sinha was greatly influenced by contemporary American and British Cinema, in his youth. Among his favourite directors were John Ford, Carol Reed, and Billy Wilder. He used to think that he had to make films on the lines of his favourites. Rabindranath Tagore's work had been a great source of inspiration to him as well. Different Tagore works had special significance to him in various moments of his life.[9]\n\nSinha's first film, Ankush, is based on the Narayan Ganguly's story Sainik, which had an elephant as the central character.[10] Sinha's Ek Je Chilo Desh is a fantasy film, based on a story by Shankar. He made a few documentaries, including a biographical film on scientist Jagadish Bose. He also used Rabindrasangeet in other films. Sinha's Sagina Mahato might be categorized as a political film, although it was reactionary in nature and was a direct attack on left-wing politics. It tried to disrepute organized struggle by championing the individual heroism of a worker. The Hindi version of the film, named \"Sagina\", also stars Dilp Kumar as the central character. The film was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival.[11]\n\nSinha's 5 part feature film Daughter of this Century marked a new beginning in Indian Cinema. Starring Shabana Azmi, Jaya Bachchan, Nandita Das, Deepa Sahi, and Sulabha Deshpande in central roles.\n\nRaja Sen's documentary on Tapan Sinha is entitled Filmmaker for Freedom.\n\nSinha's wife, filmmaker Arundhuti Devi, died in 1990.\n\nSinha's final venture, the children's filme Anokha Moti, was incomplete. The film stars Arjun Chakravorty, and is being made in Hindi.[12]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 15 January 2009, he died of pneumonia and septicaemia.[8]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2010, the then railway minister Mamata Banerjee, laid the foundation stone of the Tapan Sinha Memorial Metro Hospital, at Tollygunge, Kolkata.[13] Tapan's works left an impact and influence on Bollywood filmmakers like Hemen Gupta, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Gulzar,[14] Ashutosh Gowariker[15][16] and Bengali filmmakers like Raja Sen, Kamaleshwar Mukherjee.[17] His work highly influence and impact and popular culture by Bengali filmmaker Tarun Majumdar and Nowadays, Suman Ghosh (director). While in London, he was exposed to the works of Italian directors Federico Fellini, Vittorio De Sica and Roberto Rossellini. Tapan Sinha has also served as a member of the jury in the popular film festivals at Tashkent and San Francisco among others.[18] Tapan Sinha has been selected for the Dada Saheb Phalke Award for the year 2006 for his outstanding contribution to Indian cinema.\n\nTelevision career\n\n[edit]\n\nAadmi Aur Aurat is based on a story by Prafulla Roy. Amol Palekar and Mahua Roy Choudhury act in this piece. Sinha's telefilm Aadmi Aur Aurat was remade in Bengali as Manush (starring Samit Bhanja and Devika Mukherjee) by the director himself.[19] Sinha made another telefilm Didi with Deepti Naval as the central character.[20][21] Sinha made a detective TV serial Hutumer Naksa.\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nCivilian award\n\nPadma Shri (1992)[22]\n\nNational Film Awards\n\n1956: National Film Award for Best Feature Film – Kabuliwala[23]\n\n1956: National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali – Kabuliwala[23]\n\n1957: National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali – Louha-Kapat[24]\n\n1960: National Film Award for Second Best Feature Film – Kshudhita Pashan[25]\n\n1965: National Film Award for Second Best Feature Film – Atithi\n\n1967: National Film Award for Best Feature Film- Hatey Bazarey\n\n1968: National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali- Apanjan\n\n1971: Best Screenplay – Ekhonee\n\n1977: National Film Award for Best Children's Film - Safed Haathi\n\n1984: Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration - Aadmi Aur Aurat\n\n1990: Best Direction – Ek Doctor Ki Maut\n\n1990: National Film Award for Second Best Feature Film- Ek Doctor Ki Maut\n\n1994: National Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues- Wheelchair\n\n2006: Dadasaheb Phalke Award\n\nInternational Awards\n\nBest Film-Cork festival, Ireland for Khudhita Pashan\n\nSilver Bear Extraordinary Prize of the Jury at 7th Berlin International Film Festival for Kabuliwala\n\nJury Award-Sanfransisco Film Festival for Hansuli Banker Upokotha\n\nSilver Peacock-2nd best film, International Film Festival of India & Audience Award, Sydney Film Festival for Nirjan Saikate\n\nInternational Certificate of Merit, Venice Film Festival for Atithi\n\nDiploma of Merit, London Film Festival for Aarohi\n\nSilver Leopard, Locarno Film Festival for Aarohi\n\nAward for Best Film-Royal Cup, Cambodia Asian Film festival for Hatey Bazarey\n\nAward for Best film in 13th Asia Pacific Film Festival for Hatey Bazarey\n\nSilver trophy (Cup of honour) in Phnom Penh Film Festival for Hatey Bazarey\n\nAfro-Asian Award, Moscow Film Festival for Sagina Mahato\n\nGolden Crown for Best Music, Seoul Asian Film Festival for Harmonium\n\nSpecial Award 'Child of our Time', Vii Film Festival, Milano for Safed Haathi\n\nUNICEF Award(Honorable Mention), Berlin Film festival for Aaj Ka Robin Hood\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nAnkush (1954)\n\nUpahaar (1955)\n\nTonsil (1956)\n\nKabuliwala (1957)\n\nLauha Kapat (1958)\n\nKala Mati (1958)\n\nKhaniker Atithi (1959)\n\nKshudhita Pashan (1960)\n\nJhinder Bandi (1961)\n\nHansuli Banker Upakatha (1962)\n\nAamar Desh (1962, Documentary)\n\nNirjan Saikate (1963)\n\nJatugriha (1964)\n\nArohi (1964)\n\nAtithi (1965)\n\nGalpo Holeo Satti (1966)\n\nHatey Bazarey (1967)\n\nApanjan (1968)\n\nSagina Mahato (1970)\n\nEkhoni (1971)\n\nZindagi Zindagi (1972)\n\nAandhar Periye (1973)\n\nSagina (1974, Hindi)\n\nRaja (1975)\n\nHarmonium (1976)\n\nEk Je Chhilo Desh (1977)\n\nSafed Haathi (1978)\n\nSabuj Dwiper Raja (1979)\n\nBanchharamer Bagan (1980)\n\nAdalat o Ekti Meye (1982)\n\nAadmi Aur Aurat (1982)\n\nManush (1983)\n\nDidi (1984)\n\nBaidurya Rahasya (1985)\n\nAtanka (1986)\n\nAaj Ka Robin Hood (1987)\n\nEk Doctor Ki Maut (1991)\n\nAntardhan (1992)\n\nWheel Chair (1994)\n\nAjana Shatru (1994, Documentary)\n\nHutumer Naksha (1998, TV)\n\nAjab Gayer Ajab Katha (1998)\n\nAnokha Moti (2000)\n\nDaughters of This Century (2001)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAparna Sen\n\nTarun Majumdar\n\nShiboprosad Mukherjee\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
