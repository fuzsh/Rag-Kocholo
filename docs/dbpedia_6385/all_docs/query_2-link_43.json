        "text": "My association with Tapan Da goes back about 35 years or more. I recollect being introduced to him through my friend in Kurseong where he was shooting for ‘Sagina Mahato’ with Dilip Kumar. The friendship which started in those days stood the test of time and with the passing away of Tapanda, I feel I have lost an elder brother as our relationship was more of personal than professional. We were in regular touch with each other and he would often discuss his ideas with me which, over the years, developed a close bond and mutual affection for each other.\n\nA lot has been spoken and written about Tapan Da and his achievements. My production company, Gaurang Films, has been fortunate to make four classic films with him since 1976, viz., ‘ Harmonium’ (Bengali/1976/Black & White), ‘ Safed Haathi’ (Hindi/1978), ‘Aaj Ka Robinhood’ (Hindi/1988), & ‘Anokha Moti’ (Hindi/2000) . Recently, we had started work on ‘Teen Murti’ (Bengali) based on his story, screenplay and music for which songs were also recorded. However, he was taken ill just before the commencement of the shooting. This is the last script of TapanDa which would be appropriate to be filmed.\n\nNot only this is a personal loss to me but it is certainly a loss to the Indian Film Industry as well. Each of the 42 films made in his life time is remarkably different, providing wholesome entertainment with meaningful content which is thought provoking and enduring.\n\nAt Garuang Films, we will sorely miss him and pray to the Almighty for the departed soul to rest in peace. In our hearts, we carry with us his affectionate smile and blessings always……."
