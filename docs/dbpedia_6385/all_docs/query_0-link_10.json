        "text": "THERE WAS a time when workers were heroes in this country. It was a golden period that started with the hope of a newly-independent nation and lasted a couple of decades, perhaps more. The films of that era reflected this perception. Plots usually featured a factory hand who stood up against the seth (owner) and his violent henchmen. Sometimes, the seth would see the light—that exploitation and unfair practices hurt everyone—and have a change of heart. My earliest memory of this is the 1959 Dilip Kumar classic Paigham where the conflict ended on a happy labour-and-capital-must go-hand-in-hand note. Later, Sagina Mahato brought together the more complex story of the Left capture of trade unions (TUs) and the helplessness of the worker."
