        "text": "Veteran actor Saira Banu took a trip down memory lane on Sunday and spoke about her 1974 film Sagina. In a post on Instagram, Banu shared several stills and a clip from the film and also talked about her late husband, actor Dilip Kumar, who was a part of the movie too.\n\nSaira Banu remembers Sagina, calls Dilip Kumar’s performance “Spell-binding, enthralling”; check post here\n\nBanu called Dilip Kumar's performance in the film one of his \"most spell-binding and enthralling\" ones. She also shared an anecdote on how while shooting in Gayabari for the film, Dilip set up a badminton court for everyone.\n\n\"Sagina is one of my most loved films,\" Banu wrote. \"It is based on the true story of the labour movement. Sagina, a factory labourer...is an honest, aggressive and loveable character who was the first to fight against the tyranny of the British bosses in the tea gardens of Northern-Eastern India. Sagina becomes a Welfare Officer and brings about justice.\"\n\nBanu also wrote about how she and Dilip Kumar enjoyed working on the film together. \"I was so happy when Sahib and revered Tapan Sinha worked together... they were such good friends and like-minded that they brought ease and cordiality while filming Sagina in the most relaxed atmosphere at Gayabari where we worked in the outdoors,\" she wrote.\n\nShe further added, \"The first thing that Sahib set up in the garden was a Badminton court for all the team of the shooting to play together in the evenings and then cosily huddle in the house to sing and joke together turn by turn.\"\n\nSagina, released in 1974, was directed by Tapan Sinha. The film stars Dilip Kumar, Saira Banu, Aparna Sen, and Om Prakash among others. It was a remake of the 1970 Bengali movie Sagina Mahato directed by Tapan Sinha with the same lead pair in the cast.\n\nAlso Read: Dilip Kumar once aspired to be a cricketer, reveals Saira Banu; recalls he taught her how to bowl\n\nMore Pages: Sagina Box Office Collection\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES"
