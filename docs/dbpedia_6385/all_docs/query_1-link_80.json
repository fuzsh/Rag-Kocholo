        "text": "This article focuses on the production and mass circulation of locally produced videos in and across socially marginalized areas of Bengal. It emerges from the research conducted on the video industry located in Purulia District, West Bengal. These videos, known as \" Manbhum videos, \" signifying both place and idiom, are connected to video cultures proliferating across the Global South since the last decade. While new media cultures have become a crucial part of contemporary cinema studies, production of Manbhum videos (and videos produced in other local languages) point toward a new understanding of both cinema in India and categories like regional films. It raises questions regarding the ways in which \" regional cinema \" has been described so far, and the manner in which it may be redefined in the new media context. Such small-scale and localized video production in West Bengal and its circulation across disparate districts of India and Bangladesh, inform us that frameworks like \" Bengali cinema \" are deeply fragmented. Therefore, by studying the videos and its growth, this article shows in what way alternative settings and landscapes, narratives tropes, styles of performance and speech become pertinent in these videos, which effectively address a longer history of marginalization and political tussle. Rodowick's (2007) work on the \" virtual \" and afterlife of celluloid-films, as well as specific interventions such as Sundaram's (2010) Pirate Modernity, on the reception and circulation of pirated videos in India, have analyzed the present-day media practices and its implications. 1 Indeed, cheaply produced consumer items, including DVD players, consumer cameras, and cellular phones, and their easy availability in the suburban and rural market (of India) during the last decade has played a crucial BioScope 7(1) 58â€“79\n\nThis essay is a critical genealogy of Bengali cinema roughly between 1955 and 1965, as the story unfolded in the pages of Filmfare, the preeminent mainstream cinema periodical in India. It locates the question of Bengali cinema in a greater textualization of a burgeoning Indian film in the world. The account covers three lines of vision, in terms of how Bombay, as film capital, was looking to Calcutta to supply a literaryreformist guidance to an emerging national form, how Calcutta was conversing with Europe and America in a manner that almost totally bypassed the pan-Indian scenario, and how the west was also frequently looking at the cinematic universe of Satyajit Ray and his peers without any necessary refractive mediation by an all-India prism. Along the way, the essay also revisits crucial moments in the history of the Bengali film industry, both in terms of its commercial and artistic accomplishments as well as its failures to set up regular lines of exchange with other major industries like Bombay and Madras, as well as neighbours like Orissa, Assam, Burma, and what eventually became the independent country of Bangladesh.\n\n\"A River Called Titas\" is based on the autobiographical novel by Advaita Malla Barman. The Writer himself came from fisherman family. Locally these fisherman community is known as \"Malo.\" As a result, the struggle life of these fishermen community had been observed and felt by Barman from a realistic perspective. His novel was published in 1956, and in 1936 another novel called \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (Boatman of the River Padma) by Manik Bandopadhyay was published: both of them are about the ethnic-social group who live in the river bank. In between \"Boatman of the River Padma\" and \"A River Called Titas,\" there was no book on these ethnic-social group, the Malo community. Though Manik observes this community as an outsider, he tried to build the biosphere of this endangered society. In contrast, Barman's origins as a Malo, helped him to observe, realize the struggle of this lower caste community, which leads him to write about them thoroughly. And when this novel was publishedin1956, the writer was passed away, and after two decades, Ritwik Kumar Ghatak captures the river called Titas on celluloid. As media film and literature has enormous differences and Ritwik has to break down the novel into too few different parts to bring out the central gesture of the story and build a unique form of narration. Following this, for better analysis of \"A River Called Titas,\" I have planned to separate this whole cinema into four significant episodes. Reasons are many, but I concentrate on how Ritwik tried to create the Verfremdungseffekt1 or the alienation effect. His engaging editing style and the narrative style is more episodic, and it strongly follows Bertolt Brecht's epic theatre2 than dramatic theatre. So the cinema mainly structured from four points of view, with the first part focused on its historical development. The beginning title sequence tires to develop a narrative, visual structure of the village, its villagers and the Titas river, introducing the main characters from the villagers, young Basanti, Basanti's mother, Kishore, Subol, Ramprashad, and RajarJhi. 1. Means distancing effect which is a technique that used in theater and cinema to prevents the audience from losing itself completely in the plot or characters. 2. Epic theatre is divided by based on a structure, staging, design, music, acting, and characters of a production. Where dramatic theatre has a plot or story, and it implicates spectators in actions and down into the plot; allow its audience to have emotions and where feelings are more preserved; suspense about the outcome of the story and one scene exists for another; linear development of the sequences and thought determines to exist, on the contrary, epic theatre does not follow these characteristics. Epic theatre is performed with narration which is remind the aidance that they are watching a presentation of a story. The characters in epic theatre sometimes break the sequence by commenting upon their character as an actor and sometimes speaking to the stage direction. It turns the spectator into observer but awakens his capacity for action and demands decisions from the event. This is a more episodic and disconnected montage of scenes, and each scene exists for itself. An additional piece of written information might present onstage like as a placard, multimedia or a powerpoint slideshow can be used for alienation effect. It also breaks the imaginary wall between the actors and audience and they become the active audience of the theatrical experience as they are kept thinking all the time of not turning off. This term is also known as breaking the fourth wall."
