Kapur\n\nHemen GangulyStarringMusic byAnup Ghoshal\n\nAssistant\n\nTapan Sinha\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n148 minutesCountryIndiaLanguageBengali\n\nSagina Mahato is a 1970 Bengali film produced by Shri J. K. Kapur and directed by Tapan Sinha. The film stars Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu, two acting giants of Indian cinema. The film is based on the true story of the labour movement of 1942â€“43, told through with fictional characters, and the mock trial of Sagina Mahato, the trade union leader of a factory in Siliguri.[1] It was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival.[2] The film was shot on locations in Kurseong, near Darjeeling.[3] A diamond-jubilee hit, it created box-office records in Bengal.[citation needed] The film was remade as a Hindi film titled Sagina in 1974, by Sinha with the same leads, produced by the same producers team J.K. Kapur and Hemen Ganguly, though this version wasn't commercially successful.[1] Film music composed by playback singer Anup Ghoshal.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is story of a tea estate labour leader in the north eastern region of India during the British Raj. Sagina Mahato fights for the rights of the labourers and has the courage to face the tyranny of the British bosses. He is helped by a young communist Amal who comes to the place to upraise the poor and downtrodden masses. Amal, an outsider, turned Sagina as a leader and thus alienated him from the mass by elaborating, appropriating, codifying, approximating his social hierarchy. The story by Gour Kishor Ghosh (first published in Desh25:12, 18 January 1958, reveals the problems of vulgar vanguardism from the radical humanist standpoint.\n\nCasts\n\n[edit]\n\nDilip Kumar as Sagina Mahato\n\nSaira Banu as Lalita\n\nAnil Chatterjee\n\nBhanu Bandopadhyay\n\nSwarup Dutta\n\nSumita Sanyal\n\nRomi Chowdhury\n\nKalyan Chatterjee\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nBFJA Awards in 1971\n\nBest Actor: Dilip Kumar\n\nBest Actor in Supporting Role: Anil Chatterjee\n\nBest Art Direction: Suniti Mitra\n\nBest Music: Tapan Sinha\n\nBest Male Playback Singer Award: Anup Ghoshal[4]\n\n8th Moscow International Film Festival\n\nBest Afro-Asian Film[5]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nHistory of tea in India\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
