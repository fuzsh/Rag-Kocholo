        "text": "Rarely in the history of cinema has an actor taken on the persona of a country so immensely as Dilip Kumar did. From the perspective of social reality, Dilip Kumar represented a young country. Around him, India was transforming. It was a new nation charioteered by Nehru's, scarred but proud in its destiny in the community of nations. Dilip Kumar was a role model, an idol, and always so exemplary. He was compassionate yet strong, passionate yet thoughtful, and he was the epitome of the Nehruvian man.\n\nIf one tries to encapsulate Dilip Kumar and his movies between 1944 and 1964, we see the epitome of young India. It is important to introspect the thespian’s commitment to focus on issues of the people. To this end, he invested his stardom as well as his skills as an actor. The more he seasoned, the deeper he dove to fathom how complex his milieu was.\n\nAs we discuss the politics of development in today's \"liberalised\" India with its 1 billion hand-held 4G powered displays constantly spewing hate and nonsense to reduce minds to the lowest common denominator, my astonishment grows at how early proponents of a progressive India leveraged the screen.\n\nWho could forget Dilip Kumar’s quiet monologue from the 1953 film Footpath, in which he played a black marketeer who rose from poverty to affluence by stockpiling food and medication? When an epidemic breaks out, the main character realises the harm he has caused to society and his loved ones; the poor and the starving, from whom he rose, were the victims for no fault of theirs.\n\nFilms like Zia Sarhadi’s Footpath, Guru Dutt's Pyasa, Raj Kapoor's Shree 420, and the Dev Anand-starring Baazi served as early warning signals to India, which was yet in the throes of gaining independence, that the road ahead was anything but simple. While doing exceptional business at the box office, these movies also performed a fine job of educating the general public, which Nehru was quite aware of and appreciated.\n\nMahatma Gandhi said that villages are where the soul of India dwells. The soul took sustenance from a variety of livelihoods, some of which were threatened by new Western technology. At the expense of the producers, the pace of output began to rise. As India's first ten years of independence came to a conclusion, BR Chopra's Naya Daur was released. Its captivating story of friendship, competition, and romance was placed against the backdrop of how mechanisation destroys people's livelihoods and destabilises communities.\n\nThis blockbuster forewarned an industrialising India that modernization driven by private capital would concentrate wealth and production assets in the hands of a select few, escalating societal inequality. It outlined a plan of action: mass unification and cooperation.\n\nNaya Daur’s subject resonated well across the country. Only one Hindi film released in 1957 was a bigger hit than Naya Daur, it was none other than Mehboob Khan’s magnum opus Mother India, a ground-breaking examination of rural India and feudal tyranny that caused the world of film to sit up and take notice.\n\nIn Ganga Jumna, Dilip Kumar himself took up the issue of feudal rule. He created the plot and the screenplay for the movie about two brothers, one defending the law and the other rebelling against the evil zamindar and the wealthy and powerful. He also oversaw its production.\n\nTo great acclaim, Dilip Kumar's portrayal of the rebel broke the mould of heroes as Mr. Goody Two Shoes. The Hindi heartland was chosen for the setting of the movie with great care. A rare for Hindi movies, Ganga Jumna created quite the impression at international film festivals. Approximately 32 million people in the former Soviet Union watched.\n\nThen, there was Paigham, in which Dilip Kumar played a young man who attempts to organise his mill co-workers after learning that the owner was exploiting the employees. There was a duel between Dilip Kumar and aristocratic Motilal where the later mocks him to be Mahatma Gandhi. The thespian responds by saying “ It is indeed a great fortune that he lives in a country where the great soul set his foot, he is making a weak attempt to follow the path guided by the father of this nation”. In the 1970s, when workers all over the country were seeking a better deal, the notion gained a lot of traction.\n\nThe only full-length Bangla film starring Dilip Kumar, Sagina Mahato by Tapan Sinha, was released in 1970. Shot in black and white, this was a comprehensive examination of labour, community, the trade union movement, and its flaws, based on a Gour Kishore Ghosh short story. It was set in the Darjeeling Hills during the tea economy's boom years of 1942–1943, when, as it remarked, people were resisting both Nazism and imperialism and \"a new India was being born in this cataclysm.\" When the idea for the movie was being developed, the Naxal movement had just begun to emerge in that area.\n\nIn a highly charged political environment, the collaboration of the two erudite minds to critically examine labour movements resulted in this enormously successful film. At the Moscow International Film Festival, it was named \"Best Afro-Asian film.\"\n\nEventually, Dilip Kumar showed that he was more than just an actor and a celebrity. He stood for a generation that was dedicated to creating a diverse India and never shied away from the country's shortcomings. He never limited the art of cinema to being a purely entertaining medium, but rather saw it as one of the most effective and influential ways to address a range of societal concerns through a nuanced screenplay. In his acting roles, Dilip Kumar embodied the voice of the people while adhering to a Nehruvian socialism. On July 7, 2021, India lost not only a beloved matinee idol but also a politically brave icon who, whenever the opportunity presented itself, demonstrated that he was more than just an actor par excellence."
