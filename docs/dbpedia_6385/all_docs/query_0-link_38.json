Labour concepts and their class, community, culture have not come to focus in Bengali Cinema during post-colonial period. The cinema can be used as an instrument to help people get rid of obscurantism and also to guide them along the right path. It can help in removing ignorance from our society. Not only this, several much needed social reforms can be introduced and brought about with the help of the cinema (debate.org). Itâ€™s a debatable that how literacy base cinema came to take gigantic plea on social matter. Literature is a wealth of the society that is very important role for knowing a society in every aspect. In Bengali literature labour related discussion had not come in wide range but the issues are reflected in some great Bengali cinemas such as Chinnamul (1950), Ajantrik (1958), Abhijaan (1962), Hansuli Banker Upakatha (1962), Sagina Mahato (1970), Dhanraj Tamang (1978), Heerak Rajar Deshe (1980), Padma Nadir Majhi (1993), Chokh (1982) etc.\n\nKeywords: Bengali cinema, Marginal workers, Unorganised labour, Migration, Untouchability, Racism, Agriculture labour\n\nHow to cite : Chakraborty A , Reflection of labour issues in bengali cinema in post colonial era.
