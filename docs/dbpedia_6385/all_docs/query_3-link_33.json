        "text": "In Satyajit Ray the Bengali cinema had touched two keystones: on the one hand, it encapsulated a modernist imaginary of the Indian nation, on the other, it enunciated an unparalleled spirit of ‘Bengaliness’. Bengali cinema of the 1960s and 1970s was unmistakably inﬂuenced by the Ray factor. In Ray’s hands there evolved a genre of ﬁlm acting and a breed of actors who inﬂuenced the trend of Bengali ﬁlms of subsequent years. Ray also inﬂuenced his contemporaries like Tapan Sinha and Tarun Majumdar, who were auteurs in their own right. Yet, Ray’s humanistic vision had its constraints in the turbulent years of the 1960s and 1970s, when West Bengal underwent drastic social and political transformation, culminating in the shift of state power to political parties from the Left. It was a period of unprecedented political activism and political ferment in the state, and in the face of incredible social pressures Bengali society at large lost its idealism and ‘feel good’ factors, which it had held on to even in the years after 1947 and the country’s Partition. In these years, the Bengali cinema as a whole showed an important transformation, moving beyond its existing patterns and throwing up new ideological aspects and prototypes, which this chapter examines. However, the Bengali cinema’s most remarkable transmutation happened in the 1980s, when it turned on its head the cultural paradigm that was its mainstay. In the 1980s popular cinema, the industry not only harnessed a different audience, it ﬁnally also departed from its order of a ‘bhadralok Bengaliness’. This chapter traces these transitions of the Bengali cinema, showing how over these years the ﬁlmic imaginary of ‘a cultured Bengaliness’was gradually dissolved to produce more contemporary conﬁgurations.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s Bengali cinema showed a host of trends. On the one hand was the genre of romantic drama, with Uttam Kumar now being paired with a new crop of ‘heroines’, including Supriya Devi, Sandhya Roy and Anjana Bhoumik. Comedies remained popular, shading off into the ubiquitous ‘social’. For the greater part, the Bengali ﬁlms of these years remained wedded to the ‘good story’ index, with an ingredient of ‘bhalo gaan’ (good songs), and several literary adaptations were box ofﬁce successes. From the 1960s, however, the Bengali\n\nmarket felt the impact of Hindi cinema’s new commercialism. In 1964 one of Bombay cinema’s biggest ﬁlms ever, Raj Kapoor’s Sangam, was released. It was Kapoor’s ﬁrst ﬁlm in colour, and had an extended honeymoon sequence shot in Europe – Venice, Paris and Switzerland. Sangam initiated the ‘foreign’ location shoot in Indian cinema (which would become more popular from the 1970s onwards), and in one go changed the idea of the Hindi ﬁlm. Speaking of this ﬁlm, Rajat K. Ray, then Professor at Calcutta’s Presidency College, said in a private conversation, ‘Sangamwas the ﬁrst Hindi ﬁlm that the boys and girls of Presidency College acknowledged having been to see’.1 Presidency College was Calcutta’s premier elitist institution, and this in itself was a certain sign of change. Yet, for the 1960s, and even the early 1970s, the Bengali ﬁlm held its ground, principally through its ‘good story’ index and the presence of Uttam Kumar. During the 1960s and 1970s, Tapan Sinha and Tarun Majumdar were two of the\n\nmost successful Bengali directors. Tapan Sinha had started his career as sound recordist at New Theatres in the 1940s, and made his mark with ﬁlms like Kabuliwala (1957) and Jhinder Bondi (Prisoner of Zenda, 1961). In the 1960s he made other literary adaptations like Jatugriha (1964). Sinha’s ﬁlms were often identiﬁed in terms of their ‘good story and good acting’ quotient. Tapan Sinha also made Bengali ﬁlms in which he cast Bombay stars – Hate Bajare (1967) with Ashok Kumar and Vaijanthimala and Sagina Mahato (1970) with Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu – and as such stood located in the interstices of ‘mainstream’ and ‘art’. Tarun Majumdar, the other successful Bengali director of this period, had his ﬁrst big hit in Balika Badhu (1967), a sentimental drama about young love. Like Sinha, Majumdar was associated with his ability to tell a story well, and made successful literary adaptations like Tarashankar Bandopadhyay’s Ganadevata (1979). Yet, both Sinha and Majumdar’s work also showed overlaps with the new trends\n\nof these years. Sinha’s Sagina Mahato told the story of a labour leader Sagina in an industrial belt of the north-east. Sagina ﬁghts against the British management to get the workers their rights, and gets drawn into a political vortex as the Left movement spreads in the region. Sinha also made the landmark ﬁlm Apanjan (1968) – a super-hit, which spoke about the unemployed Bengali youth and their loss of faith in the values of old. Set in the contemporary, Aponjon was one of the ﬁrst ﬁlms to bring up the issue of a new generation that was conditioned by cynicism rather than a values system, and who were turning to crime and political violence as the result of a systemic breakdown. As early as 1952 Ritwik Ghatak, in his ﬁrst ﬁlm Nagarik, had painted this spectre of unemployment and despair, and the disintegration of the lower middle class in the face of inexorable social pressures. In the 1970s, the same discourse found a political voice in Mrinal Sen’s ﬁlms Interview (1970) and Calcutta ’71 (1972). These were also the years that saw the high point of the ﬁlm society movement,\n\nwhich had originated with the Calcutta Film Society’s formation in 1947, and the growth of a critical public of cinema which sought to distance itself from the popular mainstream. The mainstream ﬁlm also came under sharper focus against the rise of a ‘parallel cinema’, which was inspired by an international avant-garde, and projected an ideological perspective that was linked to the new politics of the\n\ntime. The parallel cinema that emerged in this period was a part of the leftist avantgarde and has since occupied a key position in the Bengali intellectual imaginary. In effect, Bengali cinema of the 1960s and after has been treated mainly in terms of a ‘non-mainstream’ of cinema – be it Ray’s ﬁlms, or the work of his two leading contemporaries Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen. This may have also been a function of the wane of the iconic pair of Uttam-Suchitra, who did not work together for some years after their great hit Saptapadi. After the relatively unimportant Bipasha (1962), they were seen together after a long gap inGrihadaha (1967) but the magic of their golden years now ﬁnally seemed to be ending. While Uttam Kumar remained Bengal’s top star, he was unable to produce a comparable romantic pairing with younger heroines, and by the early 1970s had started playing ‘character’ roles that were now being written for him. An actor like Soumitra Chatterjee was equally a part of the mainstream and ‘non-mainstream’, yet, has been most pervasively identiﬁed with the ‘serious’ cinema of Satyajit Ray. (Ray, however, also made his very popular ‘Feluda’ ﬁlms with Chatterjee in the lead role of the Bengali detective Prodosh Mitter.) As such, there has been a somewhat strict bifurcation of ‘mainstream’ and\n\n‘parallel/art’ in the understanding of the Bengali cinema of the 1960s onwards. Yet, as this chapter shows, for a signiﬁcant part, this split gets smoothed over when we consider the key tropes of the Bengali cinema of this period, which traversed the boundaries of ‘mainstream’ and ‘parallel’, or ‘commercial’ and ‘art’. Undoubtedly, there was differentiation in terms of form and style, which worked to set apart ‘the mainstream’ from ‘the parallel’. Yet, overall, the Bengali cinema of the 1960s and 1970s is best understood, sociologically, with respect to some basic issues which concerned ﬁlm-makers across the board, whether they chose to locate themselves within the mainstream, or beyond it. Bengali ﬁlms of this period – across the categories of ‘mainstream’ and ‘parallel’ – became markedly contemporary texts, as it were, imprints of that era, which signiﬁed a new order of the Bengali middleclass society. This was a society which was becoming debilitated by the crisis of its youth, who had rejected the idealism of the post-independence years, and nurtured a cynicism which struck at the very roots of the bhadralok culture. It had produced contemporary prototypes – the bhadralok loafer and shikkita bekar (educated unemployed), or the middle-class woman prostitute, and these attained an almost iconic signiﬁcation in the ﬁlms of the time."
