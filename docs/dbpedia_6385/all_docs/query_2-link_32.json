        "text": "As the film industry and cinema lovers across generations mark the birth centenary of the silver screen icon, film historian Amrit Gangar believes it is interesting that the celebrations coincide with times when \"we are talking not just about Hindi cinema but the pluralistic Indian cinema as a whole\".\n\nIn his 20s, he decided to pursue acting professionally with Jwar Bhata being his first film. It was the beginning of the journey of one of the biggest screen icons witnessed by Indian cinema-Dilip Kumar, a name suggested by legendary actor-producer Devika Rani.\n\nFrom Jwar Bhata in 1944 to Qila in 1998 Kumar had a 56-year-long illustrious career. The decades 1950s and 1960s marked his golden period so it was Indian cinemas. Mehboob Khan's 1949's Andaz, alongside Nargis and his childhood neighbour Raj Kapoor, brought him superstardom and he reunited with Nargis the next year for Jogan.\n\nWhile 1970s was a lean phase for the actor, he rose back in 1980s and 1990s with films such as Subhash Ghai-directed Karma, Saudagar, Vidhata and Ramesh Sippy's Shakti. which was the first collaboration between him and megastar Amitabh Bachchan, who has been vocal about his love for the late cinema legend and considers him his idol.\n\n\"He once shared with me that he was never a method actor... He never tried to dramatize or act it out rather he would surrender to the scene. He would say, 'You create your own method while evolving yourself, you create your grammar through working',\" the filmmaker recalled.\n\n\"He is one of those who did very little work, always chose what he wanted to do and worked very hard on it. Sometimes it would be two or three years when his film came, while most of the actors did two-three films a year. It takes a lot of courage to do little work. He concentrated a lot on the work he did, he would put in a lot of effort behind it. I have no hesitation in endorsing him as the best ever,\" Sippy said.\n\n\"Dilip Sahab has been a huge influence on all of us. We all have learnt a lot subconsciously from him like his intensity, the way he would emote scenes with honesty. He was the tragedy and comedy king, he could do anything,\" Sinha said.\n\n\"He was someone who would think beyond his work, like for the nation, society and people. He would not flaunt anything. He would silently contribute towards a lot of things and causes for cine workers, blind children, handicap people, and others. This is the difference that I could see between him and other stars or celebrities of the show business,\" the director added.\n\n\"Dilip Kumar sahab would treat us like his own children, he would take care of us and protect us. He would treat us like his own children. He would never sit alone and eat. He would make sure everybody -- from spot boy to Dilip Kumar -- is sitting on one table. It is very rare to find a man like him today. He would treat everyone equally,\" she said.\n\nThough a people's person, Kumar remained away from the spotlight in the later years of his life. He spent most of his time with his wife, veteran actor Saira Banu and met a few colleagues, who were frequent to his house till his passing away last year."
