        "text": "\"I graduated in civil engineering. I never thought about doing films -- it just happened. I was in this play, Taash Ke Patey. Comedian Aghasaab saw the play and told #DilipKumar that he should see the play, which was written and directed by Kader Khan. I got a phone call from Dilip Kumar. I asked who was speaking, and the person on the other end said, \"Main Yusuf Khan bol Raha hoon.\" I said, \"Kaun Yusuf Khan?\"? He said, \"Log jisse Dilip Kumar ke naam se jaante hai.\" The phone slipped from my hand, and I fell! He saw the play, and he loved it so much that he came on stage and said, 'I am lucky that I was invited to see the play. I never knew there were so many good stage artists. All of them should be given a break in the film industry. But, for the time being, I will give Kader Khan a role in my next film Sagina Mahato, the shooting for which starts tomorrow. After a week, my other film Bairaag will start; I will give him an important role in that too.' That's how my film acting career started.\" - #KaderKhan on how Dilip Kumar spotted him and gave him his first project in Bollywood in an interview with Rediff. #Cinema #Legend #DeathAnniversary #Icon #akshitkennedia"
