The girl and her mother work in a hospital and soon become aware that the Taliban have dismissed all the people working there and have closed its gate.\n\nThe Taliban make sure that no women can get out of their houses without a legal companion (without any member of their family). If they do so they will be punished.\n\nTo support the family, the girl’s mother, who has lost her job, decides together with the girl’s grandmother to change the appearance of the girl in order to look like a boy. This decision terrifies the girl. She is afraid of what will happen if the Taliban finds out that she is a girl.\n\nSIDDIQ BARMAK\n\nSiddiq Barmak (September 7, 1962) is an Afghan film director and producer. In 2004, Barmak won Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globes for his first feature film, Osama. He received an M.A. degree in cinema direction from the Moscow Film Institute (VGIK) in 1987.\n\nThere is a stylistic echo in Osama featured in Afghan films by the Iranian Makhmalbaf dynasty. Barmak directed Osama with significant funding and assistance from Mohsen Makhmalbaf. The Iranian director invested in the film, lending Barmak his Arriflex camera and encouraging him to send the movie to international festivals, which eventually generated further funding from Japanese and Irish producers. Barmak received “UNESCO’s Fellini Silver Medal” for his drama, Osama, in 2003.\n\nBarmak is also director of the Afghan Children Education Movement (ACEM), an association that promotes literacy, culture and the arts, which was also founded by Makhmalbaf. The school trains actors and directors for newly emerging Afghan cinema. Barmak is one of the celebrated figures in Persian cinema as well as the emerging cinema of Afghanistan.\n\nFILMOGRAPHY\n\nDivar – (1984) director\n\nCircle – (1985) director\n\nBigana – (1987) director\n\nUruj – (1995) scipt writer\n\nOsama – (2003) director\n\nKurbani – (2004) executive producer\n\nEarth and Ashes – (2004) co-producer\n\nOpium War – (2008) director\n\nApple from Paradise (2008) – producer\n\nNeighbor (2009) executive producer\n\nCONTACT\n\nbarmakfilm@gmail.com\n\nTalking with Rivers\n\nMohsen Makhmalbaf\n\nIran. 2023. 50 min\n\nTalking with Rivers is a conversation between Iran and Afghanistan, two neighbouring countries that used to be one land. The two countries are now sharing their stories after they parted from each other, from the era of Soviet invasion to the civil war and the Taliban era, up to and including the rise and fall of America and the return of the Taliban.\n\nMOHSEN MAKHMALBAF\n\nMohsen Makhmalbaf is an Iranian director, writer, producer. He is known as one of the most influential filmmakers and founders of the new wave of Iranian cinema in the world today.\n\nDuring his career, Makhmalbaf has made numerous critically-acclaimed films including Salam Cinema (Cannes 1995), Time of love (Cannes 1995) Gabbeh (Cannes 1996), A Moment of Innocence (Locarno1996), The Silence (Venice 1998), Tales of Kish (Cannes 1999), Testing democracy (Venice 1999), Kandahar (Cannes 2001), Scream of the Ants (Montreal 2007), The President (Venice 2014) and The Night of Zayandeh-Rood (Venice 2017) …\n\nHe is the recipient of more than 60 international awards from some of the most prestigious film festivals across the world.\n\nHis film Kandahar has been chosen as one of the top 100 best movies of history of cinema by Times Magazine. And his film A Moment of Innocence has been selected as one of the top ten best films of the ’90s amongst the director of world international film festivals.\n\nAs a writer-director, Makhmalbaf has also published more than 30 books, many of which have been translated and published in many languages.\n\nDIRECTOR,S NOTE\n\nDuring the past 40 years, I have directed and produced ten feature and documentary films about Afghanistan. I have launched and completed dozens of cultural and educational projects in Afghanistan and for that matter, for years I lived in various times in different cities around Afghanistan, closely witnessing the contemporary history of Afghanistan and the lives of the people. In all these years I have felt that the world has forgotten Afghanistan and unaware of the sufferings of the Afghan people and those who intended to help but failed, had no concrete knowledge and notion of Afghan society. This film is an attempt to explain the complexities of this situation in a plain and intelligible language.\n\nPOSTER\n\nCONTACT\n\nmay@makhmalbaf.com\n\nThey call me Chino\n\nJesús Rivera\n\nSpain. 2023. 17 min\n\nChino has returned to Adra after being away for some time.

Bachelor in Media and Communication, graduated by the University of Malaga. He has developed his career on theater, radio, advertising and cinema all around Spain.

He lives alone. His taxi (an old 1920 Chevrolet jalopy which he named Jagaddal) is his only companion and, although very battered, it is the apple of Bimal’s eye. The film shows episodes from his life in the industrial wasteland, delivering people from one place to another.\n\nFilm critic Georges Sadoul shared his experience of watching the film in this way. He said, “What does ‘Ajantrik’ mean? I don’t know and I believe no one in Venice Film Festival knew…I can’t tell the whole story of the film…there was no subtitle for the film. But I saw the film spellbound till the very end”. According to the noted Bengali poet and German scholar Alokeranjan Dasgupta, “The merciless conflict of ethereal nature and mechanised civilization, through the love of taxi driver Bimal and his pathetic vehicle Jagaddal seems to be a unique gift of…modernism.”\n\nRITWIK GHATAK\n\nRitwik Kumar Ghatak; 4 November 1925 – 6 February 1976) was a noted Indian film director, screenwriter and playwright.

In the course of the journey he gets acquainted with a group of 4 Bengali widows accompanying their niece, also going to Puri. The writer was going to just get out of his day to day Kolkata life whereas these ladies were actually going to calm down their niece who had just suffered a breakup with her lover. The rest of the story revolves around these people and their attraction and involvement with the writer. The writer is amused with them and for his part tries to calm the girl. The story guides us around the different relationships the writer develops with each of the character he meets. The movie tries to show the social taboos for widows and teaches the philosophy that life is ahead of us and not behind. There is a pretty good description of Puri, Konark and Rambha. At the time this movie was shot it was possible for Tapan Sinha to shoot inside the Konark sun temple, also the bullock cart way to Konark is an extra for the viewer.\n\nTAPAN SINHA\n\nTapan Sinha (2 October 1924 – 15 January 2009) was one of the most prominent Indian film directors of his time forming a legendary quartet with Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen.
