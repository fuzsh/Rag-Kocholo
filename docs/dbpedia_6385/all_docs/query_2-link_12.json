        "text": "Kader Khan stated \"I never thought about doing films - it just happened.I was in this play, Taash Ke Patey. Comedian Aghasaab saw the play and told Dilip Kumar that he should see the play, which was written and directed by Kader Khan.I got a phone call from Dilip Kumar. I asked who is speaking, and the person on other end said, \"Main Yusuf Khan bol raha hoon.\"I said, \"Kaun Yusuf Khan?\"?He said, \"Log jisse Dilip Kumar ke naam se jaante hai.\"The phone slipped from my hand and I fell down!He saw the play and he loved it so much that he came on stage and said, 'I am lucky that Kader Khan invited me to see the play. I never knew there were so many good stage artistes. All of them should be given a break in the film industry. But, for the time being, I will give Kader Khan a role in my next film Sagina Mahato, the shooting for which starts tomorrow. After a week, my other film Bairaag will start; I will give him an important role in that too.'That's how my film acting career started.\"."
