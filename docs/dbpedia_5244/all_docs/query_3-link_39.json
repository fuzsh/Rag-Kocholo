This is the first prospective and randomized study to compare the effects of dapagliflozin and an active comparator (gliclazide MR) on GV and glycemic control through the use of CGM parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment naïve or not controlled on a stable dose of metformin.\n\nObjective: This study aims to evaluate whether there is a difference between the effects of dapagliflozin and gliclazide MR (modified release) on glycemic variability (GV) and control, as assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), in individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2DM).\n\nMethods: An open-label, randomized study was conducted in uncontrolled T2DM individuals drug naïve or on steady-dose metformin monotherapy which were treated with 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily or 60 to 120 mg of gliclazide MR once daily. CGM and GV indices calculation were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks.\n\nResults: In total, 97 patients (age: 57.9 ± 8.7 years, male sex: 50.5%, baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c): 7.9 ± 0.9) were randomized and 94 completed the 12-week protocol. Per protocol analysis demonstrated that the reduction of GV, as measured by the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), was superior in the dapagliflozin versus gliclazide MR group (− 17.8 ± 33.3 vs. − 3.3 ± 42.9 mg/dL, mean ± SD, p = 0.037). The improvement of GV, as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the standard deviation (SD) was also superior in the dapagliflozin group (p = 0.021 and 0.024, respectively). Moreover, dapagliflozin increased the time in range (TIR, between 70 and 180 mg/dL) by 28.6 ± 24.4% vs. 19.8 ± 33.1% (p = 0.041). The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was also performed and did not alter the significance of the results.\n\nConclusions: Dapagliflozin reduced glycemic variability and increased the TIR more efficiently than gliclazide MR in individuals with T2DM after 12 weeks of treatment as demonstrated by continuous glucose monitoring evaluation.\n\nFinancial support: AstraZeneca do Brasil.\n\nO2 Association between pre-gestational BMI and adverse obstetric outcomes\n\nFilipe Dias de Souza, Patricia Medici Dualib, Rosiane Mattar, Sergio Atala Dib, Bianca de Almeida Pititto\n\nUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O2\n\nIntroduction: Previous studies have shown a higher incidence of obstetric complications in patients with increased body mass index (BMI). However, few studies provide details about the relation between obstetric complications and obesity degree.\n\nObjectives: To compare occurrence of adverse obstetric outcomes in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) according to pre-gestational BMI.\n\nMethods: 788 patients with GDM (IADPSG criteria) from a high-risk prenatal service between 2007 and 2019, were divided into five groups according to BMI: normal weight (18.5 to 24.5 kg/m2), overweight (25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2), grade I obesity (30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2), grade II obesity (35.0 to 39.9 kg/m2) and grade III obesity (≥ 40.0 kg/m2). Metabolic profile and occurrence of obstetric outcomes were compared between BMI groups using ANOVA or Chi square test. Obstetric outcomes included gestational hypertension (GHP), preeclampsia, c-section and others (hypothyroidism, pseudotumor cerebri, psychiatric disorders, thromboembolic events, HIV infection, dyslipidemia). Logistic regression was performed—preeclampsia and GHP as dependent variables.\n\nResults: Mean age of the sample was 33.4 years and did not differ between BMI groups (p = 0.257). HbA1c levels increased (p = 0.006), while weight gain during pregnancy decreased (p < 0.001) progressively across the BMI degrees. Frequencies of previous GDM/macrosomia or preeclampsia were not different between groups (p = 0.51), but higher frequencies of prior hypertension were observed according to the increase in BMI (p < 0.001). Increase in frequencies of GHP (0.6 vs. 2.1 vs. 3.4 vs. 0 vs. 9.8%, p = 0.004) and preeclampsia (0.6 vs. 1.7 vs. 6.3 vs. 1.2 vs. 12.2, p < 0.001) were observed according to the progression of BMI degrees, respectively normal, overweight, GI, GII and GIII, while no difference was seen in occurrence of hypothyroidism, cesarean delivery or other maternal complication between groups. In logistic regression, BMI—used as independent variable as a continuous variable—was associated with preeclampsia (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04–1.20), adjusted for prior hypertension and weight gain during pregnancy, and GHP (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.002–1.16) adjusted for weight gain during pregnancy.\n\nConclusions: Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is positively associated with pre-gestational BMI in women with GDM independent of weight gain and metabolic profile.\n\nFinancial support: CAPES.\n\nO3 Bean consumption improves biochemical parameters and antioxidant capacity in female rats\n\nJosilene Lopes de Oliveira1, Luiz Antônio Alves de Menezes Júnior2, Jonathas Assis de Oliveira2, Alice Helena de Souza Paulino2, Mayara Medeiros de Freitas Carvalho2, Ana Maria Fernandes Viana2, Joyce Ferreira da Costa2, Maria Lucia Pedrosa2\n\n1Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil; 2Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O3\n\nIntroduction: Oxidative damage caused by overproduction of reactive species is related to the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease. The beans have shown numerous benefits beyond the supply of macro and micronutrients, highlighting the antioxidant activity.\n\nObjective: To determine the in vitro antioxidant capacity of the three most consumed beans in Brazil and to verify if this effect is confirmed in vivo.\n\nMethodology: The antioxidant capacity of carioca (C), black (B) and red (R) beans was determined by the DPPH method, the polyphenols by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. In the in vivo analysis, 32 wistar rats were used, divided into 4 groups: C (control), CB (C + 10% bean), H (hyperlipidic) and HB (H + 10% bean), they consumed the diets for 6 weeks. The blood and liver were used for dosing.\n\nResults: Regarding antioxidant capacity, “C” (51%) presented lower value, when compared to “R” (81%) and “B” (87%), in the polyphenol quantification there was a direct correlation with antioxidant capacity. We attribute this result to the fact that “R” and “B” beans have a colored peel, the phenolic compounds, important exogenous antioxidants, are responsible for this coloration. Knowing the important antioxidant capacity of beans, we evaluated whether this profile results in antioxidant effect in vivo, since the in vitro study does not take into account the bioavailability of these compounds, their metabolism, tissue retention and cellular activity. In vivo, superoxide dismutase and catalase had a reduction in “HB” (3.8/138.5) when compared to “H” (5.4/195.6), suggesting that these enzymes were less likely to have had bean components contributing to antioxidant defenses, it is known that the activity of these enzymes is increased under oxidative stress. The bean also had a hypocholesterolemic effect, the “HB” group had a 40% decrease in serum cholesterol when compared to “H” among the possible mechanisms, we may mention the presence of soluble fibers, tannins, proteins and saponins. This legume also has a hypoglycemic effect, the “HB” (6.9) group presented lower glycemia in “H” (10.6) and may be associated with the presence of saponins and phytates. Or the presence of phaseolamin, which inhibits alpha-amylase, a starch glucose converting enzyme.\n\nConclusion: In addition to providing various nutrients, beans also have exogenous antioxidant function and can reduce cholesterol and blood glucose.\n\nFinancial support: CAPES.\n\nO4 Beneficial effect of using carbohydrate counting in type 1 diabetic patients stature: data from the largest Brazilian multicenter study of type 1 diabetes mellitus\n\nLuana Matos de Souza1, Natasha Vasconcelos Albuquerque1, Milena Silva Sousa1, Ana Paula Dias Rangel Montenegro2, Virgínia Oliveira Fernandes2, Carlos Antônio Negrato3, Marília de Brito Gomes4, Renan Magalhães Montenegro Junior2\n\n1Programa de Pós Graduação em Saúde Pública-PPGSP/UFC, Fortaleza, Brazil; 2Universidade Federal do Ceará-UFC, Fortaleza, Brazil; 3Sociedade Brasileira de Diabetes-SBD, São Paulo, Brazil 4Universidade Estadual do Rio de Janeiro-UERJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O4\n\nIntroduction: Inadequate glycemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) may interfere with growth. Thus, nutritional strategies that contribute to good control, such as carbohydrate counting, may be associated with adequate growth in this population.\n\nObjective: To verify the impact of carbohydrate counting on the height of patients with T1DM.\n\nMethods: This is a cross-sectional study, approved by the Ethics Committee (CPEA: 2.521.547), with participants from the Brazilian Type 1 Diabetes Study Group (BrazDiab1), conducted from 2008 to 2010. Participants aged < 19 years and with at least 12 months of follow-up in specialized services, were selected. Patients were categorized into two groups according to the use or no use of carbohydrate counting. For height analysis, the data were transformed into height-for-age Z score (Z H/A). Individuals with Z H/A < 0 were considered below average in relation to the general population. The glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) collection method was defined according to the American Diabetes Association (2015) recommendations and considered as adequate glycemic control with HbA1c < 7.5%. Multiple logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI), with the Z H/A < 0 as the dependent variable, while the independent variable of interest was type of diet (use or no use of carbohydrate counting).\n\nResults: A total of 1,441 participants were selected, from which 56% (807) were female, mean age was 12.1 ± 4.0 years and disease duration 5.0 ± 3.7 years. Only 34.6% (499) of the participants performed the carbohydrate counting technique. Regarding height, the mean Z H/A was 0.15 ± 1.21 in those who did carbohydrate counting and 0.02 ± 1.29 in those who did not (p = 0.39). Although both groups presented HbA1c values above the cutoff point, those who executed the technique, compared to those who did not, had significantly lower HbA1c values (9.1 ± 2.3 vs 9.5 ± 2.6, p = 0.00). In addition, there was a beneficial association between carbohydrate counting and Z H/A. Once, when the dependent variable was Z H/A < 0, it was found that individuals who performed the technique had a protection factor of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.60–0.97) in relation to the other participants.\n\nConclusions: Patients who performed carbohydrate counting had better glycemic control and lower chances of Z H/A < 0, suggesting a possible beneficial association between the technique and height in this population.\n\nO5 Chemotherapy treatment increases insulin resistance in breast cancer women\n\nJordana Carolina Marques Godinho Mota1, João Felipe Mota2, Raquel Machado Schincaglia2, Leonardo Ribeiro Soares1, Larissa Vaz Gonçalves1, Karine Anusca Martins1, Ruffo Freitas-Júnior1\n\n1Centro Avançado de Diagnóstico da Mama, Hospital das Clínicas, Federal University of Goiás, Goiânia, Brazil; 2Clinical and Sports Nutrition Research Laboratory (Labince), Federal University of Goiás, Goiânia, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O5\n\nIntroduction: Chemotherapy is a type of systemic treatment commonly used in breast cancer with different adverse effects related to nutritional status. However, the side effects of chemotherapy on glycemic profile, according to the menopausal status and type of chemotherapy treatment still need to be better investigated.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on glycemic profile of women with breast cancer according to the menopausal stage and type of chemotherapy.\n\nMethods: This is a longitudinal study that included 99 newly diagnosed women in stage I to III of breast cancer during adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Glycemic profile was assessed in the first month and after the end of the last chemotherapy session by fasting glucose and insulin, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) indexes, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI).\n\nResults: After chemotherapy, fasting insulin (9.62 ± 4.06 vs 13.37 ± 6.92 μU/mL, p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (2.37 ± 1.20 vs 2.83 ± 1.36, p = 0.01), and HOMA-B (136.05 ± 70.56 vs 162.34 ± 77.76, p = 0.01) were higher compared to the baseline. The quicki index decreased after the treatment (0.34 ± 0.03 vs 0.32 ± 0.02, p < 0.001). The adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment was associated with greater increases in glycemia (9.82 95% CI: 3.27–16.37; p < 0.01). No differences were observed between women in pre and post-menopausal stage.\n\nConclusions: The chemotherapy treatment increased insulin resistance in women with breast cancer. The adjuvant chemotherapy has higher positive association with glycemia.\n\nO6 Comparison between the 2010 and 2018 EWGOP sarcopenia criteria in elderly with type 2 diabetes\n\nPaula de Campos Calassara, Ana Luiza Nicoletti Dias, Paulo Sergio Chagas Gomes, Luciane Pires da Costa, Jefersson Teixeira, Roselee Pozzan, Lucianne Righetti Monteiro Tannus, Roberta Arnoldi Cobas\n\nUniversidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O6\n\nIntroduction: The loss of muscle mass and strength/function related to aging, sarcopenia, represents a diagnostic challenge.\n\nObjectives: the first purpose of the study was to compare sarcopenia prevalence in a sample of elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes, based on two different criteria of the European Working Group in Older People: EWGSOP—2010 and EWGSOP2—2018. The second purpose was to describe the clinical differences of patients classified according the each criterion.\n\nMethods: a cross-sectional sample including elderly subjects with T2DM were submitted to the following testing protocol: muscle strength/function (sit-to-stand chair, get up and go, gait speed, handgrip strength, “Short Physical Performance Battery”), body composition (bioimpedance), clinical features, cognition and depression. The EWGSOP 2010 and 2018 (severe sarcopenia) criteria were applied and compared.\n\nResults: A total of 77 patients were included, 46 (63%) women, age 73.8 ± 6.8 years, duration of diabetes 19.5 [10–25] years, glycohemoglobin (%) 7.9 ± 1.3%, BMI (kg/m2) 27.8 ± 4.6. Of the total, 37% did not meet any criteria for sarcopenia (subgroup 1), 38.4% only 2010 (subgroup 2), 9.6% only 2018 (subgroup 3) and 15.2% both criteria (subgroup 4). The 2018 criteria did not diagnose sarcopenia in men. Differences were observed when subgroups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were compared: Body mass index (kg/m2) = 29.6 ± 5.1 vs 27.4 ± 4.2 vs 29.5 ± 3.7 vs. 23.9 ± 2.8, p = 0.004); abdominal circumference (cm) = 100.9 ± 11.6 vs 101.4 ± 12 vs 103 ± 7.92 vs 89.95 ± 8.94, p = 0.023; glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI ml min−1 1.73 m−2) 60.5 ± 16.6 vs 50.4 ± 18.7 vs 70.9 ± 16.8 vs. 59.4 ± 14.2, p = 0.013); presence of peripheral neuropathy (%) = 29.2 vs 73.1 vs 42.9 vs 20, p = 0.004; history of bone fracture (%) = 4 vs 14.8 vs 28.9 vs 45.5, p = 0.019; history of cardiovascular event (%) = 7.4 vs 10.7 vs 0 vs 45.5, p = 0.009; possible dementia (%) = 65.4 vs 63 vs 57.1 vs. 18.2, p = 0.049). There was no difference regarding age, duration of diabetes, A1c, blood pressure, retinopathy, history of fall and depression.\n\nConclusion: The EWGSOP 2018 criterion diagnosed sarcopenia in fewer patients compared to the 2010 version. The criteria compared were able to detect sarcopenia in patients, but with somewhat different clinical characteristics.\n\nO7 Comparison of glycated hemoglobin levels in type 1 diabetic patients with diabulimia\n\nLuiza Costa Monteiro Hadler1, Raquel Oliveira Gomes1, Andreia Ribeiro de Carvalho Cavalcante1, Maria Claret Costa Monteiro Hadler2, André Neves Mascarenhas3, Isabela Fernandes Araujo3, Iago Barbosa Pinto Rodrigues3, Amanda Cristine Amador de Moura3\n\n1Unidade de Endocrinologia e Diabetes do Hospital Regional de Taguatinga (HRT), SES/DF, Brasília, Brazil; 2Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), Goiânia, Brazil; 3Escola Superior de Ciências da Saúde (ESCS), SES/DF, Brasília, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O7\n\nIntroduction: Diabulimia is a specific diabetes eating disorder (ED) whose main feature is limiting and/or skipping insulin dosing and it is more likely to be presented among women with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Worse metabolic control requiring hospitalization and higher risk to develop microvascular complications are frequent clinical issues related to those with ED compare to those without it. Moreover, the hypothesis that T1DM patients with diabulimia have divergent HbA1c levels compared to patients without ED has not yet been tested.\n\nObjective: To compare the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels between T1DM patients who omitted insulin and those who did not.\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional, observational and analytical study involving all patients diagnosed with T1DM1 who have been followed up at an Endocrinology and Diabetes United (UENDO) at a secondary level hospital, during 2 years (2016 to 2017).\n\nA questionnaire was developed in order to evaluate socio-epidemiological information. Questionnaire included a question about omitted insulin doses focusing weight loss. The Mann–Whitney test was applied to compare medians among HbA1C levels between those who omitted insulin and those who did not. All data were analyzed with the SPSS—Statistical Package for Social Science version 18.0. Protocol was approved by local Ethics Committee.\n\nResults: Original sample involved 138 eligible individuals, 26 refused to participate. Thus, final sample was 112 subjects aged 16 to 54 years (29.94 ± 9.30 years), there were 51 males, mean age 31.45 ± 10.05 years and 61 females (28.67 ± 8.5 years). Among those who answered the question about insulin omission (n = 110), 9.1% of patients reported omitting insulin doses for the purpose of weight loss, mainly were female (90%). Concerning median HbA1c, no difference between groups who omitted insulin and those who did not was found (p = 0.757).\n\nConclusions: The prevalence of diabulimia reported in the study was high, especially among female patients, a common previous finding. However, HbA1c levels were not higher in patients with diabulimia, despite ED patients have worse metabolic control. Other features need to be evaluated to clarify the present finding.\n\nO8 Diabetes and transplantation: what is the relationship to the gravity of peripheral neuropathy?\n\nGeyse Gomes de Oliveira1, Emanuel Davi Simões dos Santos2, Edson Bruno Vidal de Sousa2, Camylla Bandeira Miranda2, Cristiany Azevedo Martins1, Hortência Diniz Teixeira2, Taciana Benevides Rocha1, Daniela Gardano Bucharles Mont’Alverne2\n\n1Hospital Universitário Walter Cantídio | Universidade Federal do Ceará, Fortaleza, Brazil; 2Universidade Federal do Ceará, Fortaleza, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O8\n\nIntroduction: Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (DM) has been attributed to corticosteroid therapy. However, studies do not talk about the behavior of patients who were already diabetic before transplantation (TX). Does this population, when undergoing therapy after TX, worsen their condition, when compared with those who develop DM only after TX?\n\nObjective: To compare, in patients with previous diabetes and in diabetic patients after transplantation, the incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy.\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional quantitative approach study was conducted in people with kidney or liver TX, regardless of sex and over 18 years old. All participants were evaluated for age, gender, time of TX, time since diagnosis of DM, last HbA1c value. The presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was assessed by the Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) and Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS) in the lower limbs and the prayer sign test in the upper limbs. Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and/or percentage. For the comparisons, the t-test was used, being considered as statistically significant when p less than or equal to 0.05.\n\nResults: One hundred and fifteen individuals who underwent liver or renal TX were evaluated, 53 of whom had DM before TX and 62 developed DM after TX. There was no statistical difference regarding gender (p = 0.325) and age (p = 0.120), and of the total, most were men (n = 64–55.7%) with a mean age of 57.8 ± 10.4 years old. When comparing the time since diagnosis of DM, a statistically significant difference was observed between the groups (p = 0.0001; 16.1 ± 7.8 years and 5.7 ± 3.6 years) and time since diagnosis of TX, being the group that developed DM after TX with the longest years of surgery (p = 0.001; 4.6 ± 4.4 years and 9.3 ± 5.9 years). There was also a difference regarding the NDS, and the group with previous DM had higher mean scores (p = 0.0001). When assessing the severity of DPN, it was found that patients who already had DM before TX had higher severity of DPN (p = 0.043), and 25% of them had a risk of ulceration while no patient in the DM group after TX had this risk. As for the sign of prayer, there was no difference between the two groups (p = 0.418).\n\nConclusions: A high incidence of DPN was observed in all participants, however people who had DM before TX had higher neuropathy disability score. This impairment was greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs.\n\nO9 Effects of aerobic, strength and combined training on expression of diabetic mice heart contractible proteins\n\nJonathan Nícolas dos Santos Ribeiro, Patricia Luana Barbosa da Silva Ribeiro, Bruno de Melo Carvalho, Stéfani Mendes da Silva, Fátima Lúcia Rodrigues Guimarães, Ruy Bandeira de Vasconcelos Júnior, Amanda Mota Vieira, Denise Maria Martins Vancea\n\nUniversidade de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O9\n\nIntroduction: Diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by ventricular diastolic/systolic dysfunction resulting from a malfunction of the proteins responsible for maintaining calcium (SERCA2a, PLP, FKBP 12.6) thus reducing the contractile performance of the heart, and physical exercise is one of the methods to reduce the progress of cardiomyopathy in diabetes.\n\nObjective: To analyze the effects of aerobic, strength and combined training on the expression of contractile proteins in the heart of diabetic mice.\n\nMethods: The study was approved by the Animal Use and Ethics Committee (No. 002/2018) and conducted with 22 male Swiss mice randomly randomized into five groups: Sedentary Normoglycemic Group (SNG, n = 5), Sedentary Diabetic Group (SDG, n = 5), Diabetic Aerobic Group (DAG, n = 4), Diabetic Strength Group (DSG, n = 4) and the Diabetic Combined Group (DCG, n = 4). Induction of type 1 diabetes mellitus in the SDG, DAG, DSG and DCG groups was performed by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg). Exercise protocols were performed three times a week for 8 weeks. The Aerobic Training (AT) was performed in mouse specific pools, with weight overload of 1% to 3% of the animals body weight. The Strength Training (ST) was performed in a rodent climbing apparatus, with weights attached in the syrup, with progressive overload from 50% to 100% of the maximum climbing. The combined training used the TA system plus the characteristics of the TF. Cardiac proteins: FKBP 12.6, SERCA2a, PLB; were obtained by extraction of the heart still in contraction and later analyzed by western blotting. Statistical analysis was performed using the one way ANOVA test together with their respective Bonferroni post hoc test and the paired student t test, always adopting the significance level of p ≤ 0.05.\n\nResults: The analysis of protein expression of FKBP 12.6 (DGA = 9.5%/DSG = 32% and DCG = 33%) and PLB (DGA = 21.9%/DSG = 38.3% and DCG = 77.0%) showed significant increases (p = 0.00) for the use of combined training. The total concentration of SERCA2a showed a significant increase (p = 0.00) in DGA (40.714 ± 1206) when compared to DSG (14.746 ± 4158) and DCG (22506 ± 1542).\n\nConclusions: Aerobic, strength and combined training were effective in the modulation of cardiac proteins in diabetic mice, with PLB and FKBP 12.6 proteins being more expressed in combined training and SERCA2a presenting a greater expression in aerobic training.\n\nO10 Epigenetic regulation by micrornas in pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy\n\nMariana Borges Lopes1, Renata Caroline Costa de Freitas2, Flávio Santos Silva3, Bento José Abreu4, Adriana Augusto de Rezende1, Gabriela Placoná Diniz5, Raul Hernandes Bortolin2, André Ducati Luchessi1\n\n1Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyzes, UFRN, Natal, Brazil; 2Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyzes, USP, São Paulo, Brazil; 3Department of Health Sciences, UFERSA, Mossoró, Brazil; 4Life Science Center, Morphology department, UFRN, Natal, Brazil; 5Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Anatomy department, São Paulo, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O10\n\nIntroduction: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a recognized disease that affects cardiomyocytes, is a complication caused by chronic hyperglycemia and has high rates of mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients. However, despite medical advances in DCM, the molecular basis of this complication is not fully elucidated. In this context, the present study intends to validate the prediction regarding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and their possible regulatory miRNAs with the molecular mechanisms involved in development of DCM through in vitro and in vivo approaches.\n\nMethods: Myoblast lineage was cultivated under normoglycemic (NG, 5.5 mmol/L of glucose) and hyperglycemic (HG, 25 mmol/L of glucose) conditions for 24 h, after was performed total RNA extraction by Trizol reagent and gene expression analyzes using real time PCR (RTqPCR). Wistar rats used in in vivo model had diabetes pharmacologically induced by streptozotocin (40 mg/kg, i.v.; n = 7) than was compared with control group (citrate buffer, n = 7), after 30 days from induction the animals was euthanized, the DCM was characterized and their left ventricles was used for total RNA extraction by Trizol Reagent, mRNA and miRNA expression was analyzed by RTqPCR. The protocols used in this study were approved by the ethics committee at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (017/2009).\n\nResults: Pla2g2a expression was upregulated on the online datasets evaluated in our previous study using in silico strategies to predict gene expression in DCM, it result was also observed in the H9c2 cell culture under hyperglycemic conditions (3-fold increased, p-value = 0.043) and in left ventricles of diabetic rats from the in vivo study (3-fold increased, p-value = 0.004). miR-214 was reduced in the databases analysis and also in the in vitro (p-value = 0.043) and in vivo (p = 0.025) studies. Furthermore, there was a tendency for decreased expression of Hk2 in H9c2 cell culture under hyperglycemic conditions, and significant decrease in diabetic rats compared to their respective controls (p-value = 0.010). miR-187 increased 3-fold in diabetic rats as well as in the H9c2 culture (p-value = 0.028 and p-value = 0.019, respectively) and miR-17 was decreased (p-value = 0.015).\n\nConclusions: The experimental data performed in this study, validate the result of our in silico study previously published, as well as ratify prediction of these genes to participate in the pathophysiology of DCM.\n\nFinancial support: CAPES, CNPQ, FAPESP.\n\nO11 Evaluation of insulin application by diabetic patients\n\nMarielle De Araújo Melo, Dandara Sampaio Leão De Carvalho, Isabella Carvalho Oliveira, Raíssa Carneiro Rezende, Guilherme Borges De Andrade, Daniela Espindola Antunes, Estela Muszkat Jatene, Daniela Pultrini Pereira De Oliveira Viggiano\n\nUniversidade Federal de Goiás – UFG, Goiânia, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O11\n\nIntroduction: Insulin application is the therapy used in patients with Type 1 Mellitus Diabetes and a lot of attention is needed when it is used. The inadequate use and insecurities in the insulin auto-application can interfere in an adequate disease control.\n\nObjective: To evaluate insulin application by patients and the connection with glycemic control.\n\nMethodology: A cross-sectional study with 95 individuals with T1MD accompanied by the Endocrinology department in a university hospital. The data was collected between April and September in 2018 with the application of a standard questionnaire according to the Brazilian Diabetes Society published in 2017. The variables used were age, gender, schooling, the application object, knowledge on how to apply it, storage, expiration date, complications when applying it and glycated hemoglobin.\n\nResults: From the 95 patients, 62.1% were women, 36.8% were in high school with 28.4% aged between 21 and 30 years old. From the sample, 67.4% were using the insulin pen. In this group, 40.6% showed number of application errors bigger then 7, while the percentage was higher in the disposable syringe (74.2%; p = 0.008). Most of the patients using the pen (89.6%) and syringe (93.5%) made the application in different parts of the body, properly. When it comes to sanitation, the patients that were using the pen showed the worst habit: 57.8% wash their hands, 25% clean the insulin bottles and 29.7% clean the skin versus 93.5%, 51.6% and 61.3% from those who used the syringe, respectively. About the storage of the insulin and the patients who were using the pen: 79.7% knew the ideal temperature for the insulin bottle, 73.4% knew the right place to store it but only 54.7% knew the expiration date when the insulin bottle is opened versus 90.3%; 80.6% and 51.6% from those who were using the syringe, respectively. In relation with complications like lipodystrophy, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, the proportion for the use of the pens was 57.8%, 56.4% and 42.2% versus 48.4%; 71% and 41.9% in syringes, respectively. The needles reutilization for more than 5 times was verified in 32.8% of the patients who used the pen and 31% with the syringe, with a bigger risk association of lipodystrophy (p = 0.014). The results didn’t show a statistical significance with glycated hemoglobin.\n\nConclusion: The results showed the importance of an intensive and continued education in diabetes for the conduction of a safe treatment and complications reductions.\n\nO12 HLA in patients with type 1 diabetes from an admixed population: a nationwide study in Brazil\n\nDeborah Conte Santos1, Marcela Haas Pizarro1, Bianca Senger Vasconcelos Barros1, Laura Gomes Nunes de Melo1, Luiza Harcar Muniz1, LuisCristovão Porto2, Dayse Aparecida Silva3, Marilia Brito Gomes1\n\n1Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Departamento de Medicina Interna, Diabetes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 2Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Laboratorio de Histocompatibilidade e Criopreservação (HLA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 3Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Laboratorio de Diagnostico DNA (LDD), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O12\n\nIntroduction: HLA region on chromosome 6p21 is known to be responsible for almost 50% of the genetic risk and it has been studied for decades. The highest prevalence of T1D is observed on Caucasian population and most of the studies are concentrated on populations with small degrees of miscegenation. However, previous data show that the frequency of HLA haplotypes, and their effects on T1D risk or protection varies among populations. There is scarcity of data on the genetics of T1D population in Brazil.\n\nObjective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the HLA class II genetic profile of T1D patients from all the five regions of the country.\n\nMethods: This was a nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study conducted between August 2011 and August 2014 in 14 public clinics located in 10 Brazilian cities in five geographical regions (North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and South). For the present study, we included 1019 type 1 diabetes patients and 5116 controls pared for region of birth and self-reported color/race. Control individuals belonged to the bone marrow transplant donor’s bank of Brazil (REDOME), which is the largest HLA data repository in the country. The study was approved by each center’s local ethics committee. HLA-class II alleles (DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1) were genotyped using the SSO and NGS method.\n\nResults: The most frequently risk haplotype found in our population were DRB1*03:01 ~ DQA1*05:01 g ~ DQB1*02:01 (OR 5.8, p < 0.00001), DRB1*04:05 ~ DQA1*03:01 g ~ DQB1*03:02 (OR 5.34, p < 0.00001), DRB1*04:02 ~ DQA1*03:01 g ~ DQB1*03:02 (OR 3.43, p < 0.00001). Most prevalent protection haplotypes were DRB1*07:01 ~ DQA1*02:01 ~ DQB1*02:02 (OR 0.54, p < 0.0001), DRB1*13:01 ~ DQA1*01:03 ~ DQB1*06:03 (OR 0.30, p < 0.00001) and DRB1*01:02 ~ DQA1*01:01 g ~ DQB1*05:01(OR 0.45, p < 0.00001). The HLA-DR3/DR4 genotype presented the greatest risk (OR 12.1, p < 0.0001) in 23.6% of the patients, followed by –DR3/DR3 (OR 10.6, p < 0.0001) in 9.8% and –DR3/DR9 (9.01, p < 0.0001) in 2.7%.\n\nConclusion: Regarding the most prevalent risk alleles, such as DR3, DR4, our findings are in accordance with previous studies both in European and in admixed population. It is important to notice that DR7 allele which is usually protective only in European population showed to be protective also in our population. This fact could be explained by the higher proportions of European ancestry, compared to African ancestry proportions in type 1 diabetes Brazilian patients demonstrated in previous studies from our group.\n\nO13 Impact of the use of the flash glucose monitoring system as diagnostic tool for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus\n\nLeticia Bernardes Cunha, Luiza Macedo Travalloni, Julia Bruno Vieira, Pedro Felisberto dos Santos Neto, Isabella Sued Leão, Joana Rodrigues Dantas, Lenita Zajdenverg, Melanie Rodacki\n\nDepartamento de Clínica Médica-Serviço de Nutrologia-Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O13\n\nIntroduction: Glycemic control reduces the risk of micro and macrovascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but it is still a big challenge. Flash glucose monitoring system for intermittent continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) may detect hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes not perceived by capillary blood glucose monitoring, which could be helpful for these patients, especially those with labile glucose control.\n\nObjectives: (1) To identify, through iCGM, hyperglycemic peaks and hypoglycemic episodes not identified by capillary blood glucose monitoring in patients with T1D, labile glucose control but adherent to treatment; (2) To identify if there is improvement in 14 days in time in glucose range (between 70 and 180 mg/dL; TIR), time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and estimated glycated hemoglobin after intervention in insulin therapy based on data obtained from iCGM.\n\nMethods: In this prospective study, adults with T1D used Flash monitoring system for 14 days as a diagnostic tool. After this period, insulin was titrated and each patient underwent more 14 days of iCGM. TIR, time in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and estimated HbA1c were recorded before and after the alteration.\n\nResults: The study included 40 individuals (19 men and 21 women), with a mean age of 25.6 ± 7.2 years old and a mean duration of diabetes of 15.3 ± 7.8 years. Their mean HbA1c was 7.8 ± 1.3. All patients were on basal-bolus insulin therapy (9 used NPH and 31 used long-acting analogs; 6 used Regular insulin and 34 used ultra-rapid insulin analogs). 9 had HbA1c < 7%. In the first 14-days iCGM evaluation, only 3 patients had TIR > 70% and 50% subjects had TIR < 50%. Patients with HbA1c < 7% did not have superior TIR than others (p = 0.058). There were no differences in TIR (52% vs 53%; p 0.027), percentage of hypoglycemia (22% vs 21%; p 0.018) and of hyperglycemia (25% vs 25%; p 0.33) between the first and second evaluation.\n\nConclusions: The use of iCGM for 14 days as a diagnostic tool detected significant hyper and hypoglycemic episodes in individuals with T1D and labile glycemic control despite good adhesion to treatment. Only one medical intervention after 14-days iCGM was not sufficient to improve patients’ glycemic control over the next 14 days in these individuals. It is possible that a longer follow-up and further titration would enable significant changes.\n\nO14 Posttransplant diabetes mellitus impact on kidney transplantation related outcomes\n\nLuisa Penso Farenza1, Thizá Massaia Londero Gai2, Roberto Ceratti Manfro1, Cristiane Bauermann Leitão1, Andrea Carla Bauer1\n\n1Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil; 2Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O14\n\nIntroduction and objective: Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a frequent complication after solid organs transplantation, occurring in 10–50% of kidney transplanted patients. This study’s objective is to determine the impact of different glycemic status at transplantation on death and graft loss in kidney recipients.\n\nMethods: 1167 patients received a kidney graft between January 2000 and December 2013 at a southern Brazilian reference center and were included in this cohort study. Recipients were classified in three categories regarding glycemic status: PTDM, non-PTDM and pre-transplantation DM. PTDM diagnosis was adjudicated according to the 2014 International Consensus. Evaluated variables included sex, ethnicity, type of donor and recipients’ age at transplantation. Effect of these variables on death after transplantation and kidney graft loss was assessed by regression analysis. Survival analysis was also performed. Data were collected by electronic medical record review and the study was approved by the hospital’s ethical committee.\n\nResults: From 1167 patients, 160 (15.3%) developed PTDM and 142 (13.6%) were diagnosed with pre-transplantation DM. On multivariate regression analysis, death incidence was higher in patients with PTDM (OR 3.23, CI 1.35–7.61, p = 0.008) and in patients with pre-transplantation DM (OR 4.27, CI 1.73–10.48, p = 0.001), compared to NPTDM. Death risk was also higher in older patients and those who received graft from deceased donor. Only pre-transplantation DM was associated to higher incidence of kidney graft loss (OR 3.48, CI 1.36–9.04, p = 0.009). Patients with PTDM did not present higher risk of kidney graft loss (OR 1.47, CI 0.69–2.89, p = 0.28). On Kaplan–Meier analysis, pre-transplantation DM recipients died earlier (991 (357–1626) days) than PTDM (p = 0.006) and non-PTDM (p = 0.02) patients. Time until graft loss also was earlier only in pre-transplantation DM group (p = 0.04).\n\nConclusions: After 167 months of follow-up (mean time since transplantation, 123 ± 47 months) in this kidney recipients’ cohort, PTDM does not impact in precocious mortality nor in early graft loss. PTDM seems to be a death risk factor, but it seems to be not due to kidney graft loss or events immediately related to the transplantation, as occurs in pre-transplantation DM group. PTDM could be associated to later death after transplantation related to chronic-metabolic and cardiovascular disease.\n\nO15 Preliminary performance of a new patch biosensor (LIVSEN®) for glucose monitoring\n\nMonike Lourenço Dias Rodrigues, João Otávio Sedovski Garcia, David Evangelista da Silveira Junior, Aécio Marques Teixeira, CleytonLouredo Xavier, Raul Hilário Amaral, Larisse Silva Dalla Libera, Nelson Rassi\n\nHauttis Health Technology, Goiânia, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O15\n\nIntroduction: A new patch sensor for sweat glucose detection was recently developed (Livsen®). After glucose-oxidase enzymatic reaction, continuous ruptures in a specific metal substrate are produced, and amperometric interference in radio signals by timely ruptures in the metal substrate are reflected by sensor´s built-in antenna to cell phone. Each glucose reading is based on radio signal interpretation by Near-Field-communication (NFC) technology and the corresponding app for iPhone.\n\nObjective: The present study aimed to investigate the clinical performance of this sensor.\n\nMethods: Nineteen patients (11 women) with diabetes (13 Type 1 DM, 6 Type 2 DM), aged 19–71 years (mean 42 years), were tested. Patients had the sensor attached to left forearm, during a 4-h test, during three consecutive days. Each patient returned to the test room in the same period (morning or afternoon). Sensor warm—up was 60 min, after an initial calibration with capillary blood glucose. After sensor warm-up in the first day, patients were guided to a room with stable temperature (23o C), and stood seated during most part of the test. Two controlled meals were allowed during the 4-h test, and blood glucose calibration was not again performed. Fasting measurements, than postprandial measurements were obtained in 15 min intervals during 120 min, than hourly (180 and 240 min). Each measurement was a simultaneous assessment of capillary blood glucose in 2 glucometers (Accu-Chek Guide®, Roche and Freestyle Lite ®, Abbott) and a sensor reading by Livsen App for Iphone with NFC technology.\n\nResults: The mean value of glucometers readings was compared to Livsen readings; 600 valid pairs of measurements were obtained (183, 210 and 207 in first (D1), second (D2) and third days (D3), respectively). The mean average relative difference (MARD) between mean glucometer values and Livsen readings was 11.1%. Mard of D1 was 8.7%, D2 was 11.86% and D3 was 12.36%, with ANOVA testing showing statistical difference between D1 MARD and D3 MARD. (Tukey multiple comparisons, p = 0.00078, IC = 95%). Clarke error grid analysis showed 98.6% of measurements in Clarke Zones A and B in D1, 98.8% in D2 and 98.2% in D3.\n\nConclusion: The new patch Livsen sensor showed adequate MARD and Clarke error grid Zone performance overall. The study will be extended to a greater sample, and the MARD difference among days 1 to 3 can be minimized with repeated calibrations.\n\nO16 Suboptimal glycaemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes in Latin America: characteristics, glycaemic control, hypoglycaemia and disease management. Results from sage analyses\n\nAndre Gustavo Daher Vianna1, Balduíno Tschiedel2, Jose Fernando Botero3, Maurício Aguiar de Paula4, Juan Jose Gagliardino5\n\n1Centro de Diabetes de Curitiba, Curitiba, Brazil; 2Instituto da Criança com Diabetes - Grupo Hospitalar Conceição, Porto Alegre, Brazil; 3Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Medellín, Colombia; 4Sanofi, São Paulo, Brazil, 5CENEXA. Centro de Endocrinología Experimental y Aplicada, La Plata, Argentina\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O15\n\nIntroduction: Although achievement of glycaemic target effectively prevents the development/progression of diabetes complications, many people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) do not achieve their goal. SAGE study evaluated the glycaemic control in adults with T1D in LatAmcountries.\n\nMethods: SAGE was a multinational, observational, cross-sectional study of patients aged ≥ 26 years with T1D for ≥ 1 year. Primary endpoint: percentage of participants in predefined age groups (26–44; 45–64; ≥ 65 years old) achieving HbA1c < 7%. Secondary endpoints: other glycaemic outcomes, hypoglycaemia, therapeutic management and diabetes technology use.\n\nResults: SAGE included 488 eligible patients from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia; 61.5% female, mean (SD) age 45.6 (13.8) years, BMI 25.5 (4.2) kg/m2 and ≥ 10 years T1D duration was found in 83%. Hypertension or dyslipidaemia were present in 24.1% and hypothyroidism in 15.1%. Mean (SD) HbA1c was 8.15 (1.64) %. Only 23.8% achieved HbA1c < 7.0%; this proportion was higher (27.9%) in the older subgroup. Mean (SD) FPG and PPG was 152.0 (77.59) and 168.3 (70.27) mg/dL, respectively. Mean (SD) total insulin dose was 49.5 (25.5) U/day (0.71 (0.34) U/kg/day) and 68.9% were on a basal-bolus regimen. Only 34.9% titrated basal insulin at least once a week. Insulin devices used were injections/pens (84.6%) or insulin pump (15.2%). 14.0% had at least one severe hypoglycemia within 6 months and 82.8% had one symptomatic hypoglycemia within the last 3 months. Incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis was 4.5% mainly related to infection (27.3%) and missing insulin dose (22.7%). 96.9% of patients were in use of finger-stick blood glucose meter and 77.6% used it at least once daily in the last 7 days; 21.1% were using continuous glucose meter and only 4.1% blood ketone meter.\n\nConclusion: Despite guidelines recommendations, glycaemic control is suboptimal in adults with T1D in LatAm, irrespective of age groups. The low and infrequent insulin titration may partly explain the lack of glycaemic control. Further action is required globally including training of physicians and patients for appropriate insulin titration and carbohydrate counting. Use of new technologies and advanced insulin formulations may benefit HbA1c target achievement in this population.\n\nStudy sponsored by Sanofi.\n\nO17 Teleophthalmology screening for diabetic retinopathy in São Paulo metropolitan area, Brazil: economic assessment\n\nFernando Korn Malerbi1, Rubens Belfort Junior1, Olimpio J. Nogueira V. Bittar2, Paulo Henrique Morales1\n\n1Department of Ophthalmology, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; 2Health State Secretary São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O17\n\nIntroduction and objectives: Diagnosis and timely treatment of diabetic retinopathy are the mainstay for diabetic blindness prevention; however, proper screening is limited by several barriers. Ampliation of access to retina examination is a global challenge. Brazil has the fourth largest diabetic population in the world, with increasing demand for diabetic retinopathy screening. The objectives of this study are: (1) to evaluate the rate of detected cases in a telemedicine program for diabetic retinopathy screening, and (2) to compare costs for such screening with those of a conventional program.\n\nMethods: Retrospective study which assessed the outcomes of a diabetic retinopathy screening program undertaken at peripheral areas of Sao Paulo city and its Metropolitan Area, with a protocol that combined fundus photographs and telemedicine. Fixed costs for telemedicine screening were calculated, as well as the costs for conventional screening. Direct and indirect costs were taken into account; the former comprised diagnostic expenditures and the latter considered travel costs and lost working days. Different scenarios, depending on the resolutivity and the presence of a local ophthalmologist, were evaluated.\n\nResults: A total of 28,842 patients were evaluated; treatment was indicated in 18.99%: cataract surgery (10.84%) or diabetic retinopathy treatment—laser photocoagulation (6.93%) or vitrectomy (1.21%). The remaining 81.01% were non-referrable patients who could be followed at the primary care setting; such protocol prevented unnecessary travel and consultation expenses, as well as less lost working days. The cost per case detected would be 2.65 to 5.35 higher if conventional screening protocols were used, the variables being the presence of a local ophthalmologist and the resolutivity of the service.\n\nConclusion: The present data indicate that diabetic retinopathy screening with telemedicine is feasible in Brazil, and such strategy addresses important barriers such as cost and availability of the specialist. Telemedicine screening has a good cost-effectivity profile for the public health system as it delivers a lower cost per case detected, mainly in areas lacking specialists. The present results encourage the implementation of such protocols in underserved areas, provided that treatment can be offered to the detected cases.\n\nO18 The effect of transcranial direct current stimulation associated with hypocaloric diet on food intake and weight loss in overweight or obesity: a double-blind, randomized clinical trial\n\nCarina de Araujo1, Raquel Crespo Fitz1, Daniela Albugeri Nogara1, Amanda Farias Osório3, Gabriella Richter da Natividade1, Paula Nunes Merello3, Pedro Schestatsky2, Fernando Gerchman1\n\n1Endocrine and Metabolic Unit, Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil; 2Neurology Service, Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil; 3Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O18\n\nIntroduction: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays an important role in appetite and food intake regulation and may be a target for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a treatment modality that has shown to reduce food craving and calorie intake. Thus, we tested the effect of active tDCS associated with a hypocaloric diet (HD) on weight loss and food consumption in overweight or obese adults.\n\nMethods: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, overweight or obese adults were selected to completed a 4-wk (20 sessions; 5 weekdays) of fixed-dose tDCS (2 mA, 20 min) delivered over the right DLPFC associated whit a HD. Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) and stratified by sex to active tDCS + HD (AG), or sham tDCS + HD (SG). The primary outcomes were weight loss and the secondary outcome were changes in food intake and in desire to eat. Body weight was assessed weekly at baseline (t0), and at days 5 (t5), 10 (t10), 15 (t15), 20 (t20), and at the end of the study (tF). Habitual food intake was assessed at t0, t10 and t20 using a 3-day weighed dietary records. A 100-mm visual analog scale was used to assess desire to eat something sweet, salty, savory, or fatty at t0 and tF. All analyses were performed in intention-to-treat (ITT) using generalized estimating equations. All participants provided written informed consent. ClinicalTrials.gov ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02683902\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02683902\"}}NCT02683902).\n\nResults: 28 individuals were randomized and included in the ITT (mean age, 37.6 ± 5.8 years; BMI, 31.5 ± 2.4 kg/m2); 23 received all 20 planned sessions. Although there was a greater weight loss in the AG than in the SG at tF (− 4.5 kg [95% CI: − 9.4, 0.5] vs. − 2.3 kg [95% CI: − 5.0, 0.3]), this difference was not statistically significant. The energy intake was not statistically different between groups at t0, t10 and t20. There was a significant interaction in the desire to eat sweet foods (p = 0.005). The AG showed a significant 23.7 percentage points reduction (95% CI: − 40.2, − 7.1) in the desire for sweets over the study, whereas the SG had a non-significant 1.0 percentage point increased (95% CI: − 13.3, 15.2).\n\nConclusions: Although we might not show that repetitive active tDCS is able to optimize weight loss and decrease calorie intake, it was able to reduce the desire to eat sweet foods. These findings open a new perspective for this therapeutic modality as a potential strategy for the treatment of food craving and metabolic disorders related to carbohydrates consumption.

The aim of the study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the IDSRQ for Brazilian users as well as evaluate the validation of selected psychometric aspects.\n\nMaterials and methods: methodological study carried out in the following stages: forward translation, synthesis, back-translation, assessment by Judge Committee, pre-test and validation. International guidelines for translation and cross-cultural adaptation of measurement tools were followed. The validation provided information about the reliability (internal consistency, test–retest) and the construct validity of the studied tool.\n\nResults: Regarding content validation, the instrument performed well in the Judges’ assessment with a mean Content Validity Index of 0.87 (± 0.2). Pre-test step involved 30 T1DM in face to face discussions. The IDSRQ validation study involved 113 T1DM patients, 46% male, mean age 32.61 (± 12.59) years and mean age at diagnosis of diabetes of 17.51 (± 12.41). 27.4% were using vial and syringe; 61.1% using pen and 11.5% using insulin pump. 76.5% of the patients administer insulin > 5 times daily. NPH was the most used basal insulin (39.8%), followed by glargine U100 (34.5%). Lispro was the most used fast insulin, by 60.2% of the patients. The scale presented acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.785).\n\nConclusions: The translated and cross-culturally adapted Brazilian Portuguese version may be used to assess HRQoL and treatment preferences for insulin delivery systems in T1DM Brazilian patients.\n\nKeywords: Diabetes mellitus; Type 1; Quality of life; Insulin\n\nO20 Triglycerides levels could be a marker of large for gestational age in gestational diabetes?\n\nMicaela Frasson Montero, Filipe Dias de Souza, Rosiane Mattar, Sergio Abbud Dib, Patrícia Medici Dualib, Bianca de Almeida Pititto\n\nEscola Paulista de Medicina - Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):O20\n\nIntroduction: One of the complications of gestational diabetes (GDM) is the higher frequencies of elevated birth weight, which has also been associated with mother’s previous body mass index and weight gain during pregnancy. Recent studies have shown a positive association between triglyceride (TG) levels at late pregnancy and birth weight of newborns in pregnant women without gestational diabetes (GDM), but there is lack of knowledge regarding the relation of TG and birth weight in GDM.\n\nObjective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of birth weight with levels of triglycerides (TG) in the third trimester of gestational diabetes (GDM).\n\nMethods: The study included 645 pregnant women with GDM in follow-up at DM and Gestation service, from 2008 to April/2019 and data were collected from the participants’ medical records. Participants were stratified by median of TG (median = 173.0 mg/dL). Metabolic characteristics and birth weight were presented as mean (standard deviation) and compared by Student’s t-test; and the frequency of large for gestational age (LGA, weight > 90th percentile at birth) was presented as percentage(n) and compared using Chi Square test, p < 0.05.\n\nResults: The sample had mean age of 34 (5) years, body mass index of 29.9 (9.5) kg/m2, HbA1c of 5.6 (0.6)% and weight gain during pregnancy of 9.5 (5.9) kg, that did not differ between groups. Both groups had also similar frequency in using insulin during pregnancy, 38% in the group above and 41% in the group below the median. Women with TG above de median had greater levels of total cholesterol [233 (45) vs. 202 (39) mg/dL, p < 0.001], LDL-cholesterol [126 (42) vs. 109 (34) mg/dL, p < 0.001] and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol [61 (14) vs. 67 (15) mg/dL, p < 0.001] comparing to the group with TG below the median; while birth weight of the newborn did not differ [3.2 (0.5) vs. 3.1 (0.5) kg, p = 0.29] between groups. Pearson correlation was also not significant between birth weight and TG. There was a borderline significance for the comparison of frequency of LGA [10% (32) vs. 6% (19), p = 0.056] considering the groups above and below the median of TG respectively.\n\nConclusions: In this homogeneous group of GDM women regarding age, BMI, weight gain and use of insulin during pregnancy, higher TG was associated with greater frequency of LGA. We hypothesize that TG might be representing a higher insulin resistance and could be a biomarker to consider preventive strategies against LGA in GDM.\n\nPoster presentations\n\nP1 10 years follow up of first degree relatives of type 1 diabetes patients - presence of autoimmune biomarkers and the progression to diabetes\n\nIsabella Sued Leão1, Débora Batista Araujo2, Bianca Barone3, Matheus dos Santos Mantuano2, Joana Rodrigues Dantas Vezzani1, Lenita Zajdenverg2, Melanie Rodacki2\n\n1Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho - HUCFF, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 2Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro - UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 3Instituto Estadual de Diabetes e Endocrinologia Luiz Capriglione – IEDE, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P1\n\nIntroduction: In caucasian first degree-relatives (FDR) of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), the presence of diabetes-related multiple autoantibodies is strongly associated with progression to the disease, but most individuals with only one antibody do not develop T1D. However, a long-term prospective evaluation of these individuals in the Brazilian population is still lacking.\n\nObjective: To assess the autoimmunity in FDR of patients with T1D and the progression to T1D after 10 years of follow-up.\n\nMethods: In this prospective study, non-diabetic FDR of T1D patients were interviewed and blood was drawn for autoantibodies measurement (GADA, IA-2A, IAA, ZnT8A). Serum samples were analyzed by standard radioligand binding assays (GADA, IAA, IA2A and ZnT8A). The FDR were interviewed by phone after 10 years to determine if they had developed T1D. The study was approved by the institutional Ethical Committee. Mann–Whitney U test and Chi square were used for comparing groups. Spearman coefficient and Fisher’s exact t-test were used to test correlation between variables.\n\nResults: 81 individuals were analyzed (50 siblings and 31 offspring), with a median age of 20 years old. 16 subjects lost follow up.13 subjects presented positivity for autoantibodies associated with T1D.10 were positive for 1 autoantibody and 3 subjects were positive for multiple autoantibodies (1 of them showed positivity for 2 autoantibodies—GADA and ZnT8A—and the other two were positive for 3 autoantibodies—GADA, IA2A, ZnT8A). The 3 subjects with multiple positive autoantibodies developed T1DM within 10 years. None of the other individuals developed the disease.\n\nConclusions: After a 10-year follow-up, in Brazilian FDR of T1D patients, the positivity for two or more autoantibodies indicated a greater chance of progression to T1D, similar to that observed in Caucasians. ZnT8A enhanced T1D development prediction when combined with other autoantibodies, since it detected multiple antibody-positivity in one individual that later develop T1D. This suggests that ZnT8A might be useful for autoimmunity in FDR of patients with T1D in our population, but larger studies are still required to address this question.\n\nP2 A classification for non classified types of diabetes in a tertiary diabetes center\n\nFernanda Izabel Heckert, Alessandra Saldanha Matheus Fernandes Da Costa, Lucianne Righeti Monteiro Tannus, Livia Furtado Leba, Pâmela Suelen De Moraes, Ronaldo Gama Pena, Roberta Arnoldi Cobas, Marília Brito Gomes\n\nUniversidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P2\n\nIntroduction: Classifying diabetes (DM) type is a challenge for a subset of patients especially if it is based on clinical data alone. This uncertainty can lead to difficulties in guiding the best therapy for the patient.\n\nAims: To apply pancreatic autoimmunity and beta cell function assessment for previously doubtful DM classification.\n\nMethods: We retrospectively evaluated pancreatic autoimmunity (antiGAD, anti-insulin [IAA], anti-islet, antiIA2, antiZnT8) and fasting C-peptide levels of patients with unclassified Diabetes from 2016 to June/2019. Patients were then classified according to presence (A+) or absence (A−) of pancreatic autoantibodies and for preserved (β+) and non-preserved (β−) β cell function defined as fasting C-peptide level above or below 0.6 ng/mL. Type 1 DM was defined when classical acute Diabetes symptoms or Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) were present at onset, associated with the continuous need of insulin since the diagnosis. LADA was defined as latent symptoms associated with no insulin use at the onset of the diagnosis ot Type 1DM in adults. Type 2 DM was considered when mild symptoms and a family history of Diabetes were present. MODY was considered when a relevant Diabetes family history was present associated with mild clinical symptoms. Results are presented as mean ± SD, median [interquartile range] or n(%). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-IBM 22.0 package.\n\nResults: We included 47 patients, aged 27.4 ± 15.1 years (2–66) with age at DM diagnosis of 20.7 [11–31] years, duration of DM of 49 [12–84] months. Of the 26 patients classified as A−β+, 11 (42.3%) had Type 2 DM, 2 (7.7%) had recent onset Type 1 DM, 1 (3.8%) ketosis-prone DM, 2 (7.7%) “probably” MODY, 1 (3.8%) corticosteroids-induced DM and 9 (34.7%) persisted clinically non classified. Of the four A−β− patients, 2 (50%) had type 1B DM, 1 (25%) fulminant type 1 DM and 1 (25%) type 2 DM. Of the 5 A+β+ patients, 3 (60%) had type 1 DM, 1 (20%) had type 2 DM and 1 (20%) persisted non-classified. Of the 12 A+β− patients, 9 (75%) had type 1 DM and 3 (25%) LADA.\n\nConclusion: In addition to clinical features, evaluation of beta cell autoimmunity and function helped to classify the type of diabetes in the vast majority of our previously unclassified patients allowing us to withdraw insulin therapy, safely, in some cases when not necessary anymore. However, a small part of them may need longer clinical follow-up for their proper classification.\n\nP3 A screening of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)’ complications in a private clinic and a public outpatient clinic in Joinville - SC\n\nRejane Baggenstoss, Lucas Irineu Medeiros de Oliveira, Eloise Mariani Salamaia, Guilherme Thomaz, Goretti Silveira Rodrigues, Suely Keiko Kohara\n\nUNIVILLE - Universidade da Região de Joinville, Joinville, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P3\n\nIntroduction: T1DM is linked to micro and macrovascular long-term complications that result in a lower quality of life and life expectancy. The absence of data on prevalence of complications in T1DM patients in our city led us to conduct this study.\n\nObjective: To determine the clinic and metabolic control and prevalence of complications in T1DM patients from a private clinic and a public outpatient clinic.\n\nMethods: This was a retrospective, observational study with patients from a private (PV) and a public (PB) outpatient clinic. The inclusion criteria were: patients with T1DM for more than 10 years and above 18 years of age. The following variables were obtained from medical records: age, gender, height, weight, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, comorbidities, smoking status, type of insulin therapy, levels of HbA1c, total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, triglycerides, presence of microvascular complications.\n\nResults: We evaluated 64 T1DM patients: 25 from PB and 39 from PV clinic. Patients from PB had mean age of 34.0 years (± 14.0), 7 (28%) had hypertension (sBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or dBP ≥ 90 mmHg), 3 from 23 patients (12.5%) referred smoking. Patients from PV had mean age of 33.0 years (± 11.0), 7 (18%) had hypertension, 34 were non-smoking. Mean number of clinical visits in the last year was 1.92 (± 1.22) in PB and 3 (± 1.32) in PV (p = 0.0017). Thirteen patients from PB (52%) (10F/3M) and 14 (35.9%) from PV, had BMI > 25 kg/m2 (7F/7 M).\n\nMean HbA1c levels in PB group was 9.11% (± 2.03) and 8.45% (± 1.78) in PV group (p = 0.17 ns). Mean triglycerides was 118 mg/dL (± 89) in PB group and 77.2 mg/dL (± 38.99) in PV group (p = 0.014). There was no statistical difference in total cholesterol and HDL-c between the groups. Only 2 patients (8%) from PB and 10 (25%) from PV had HbA1c < 7.0%.\n\nIn the PB group, we found information about retinopathy in 4 from 23 patients (17.4%), about nephropathy in 5 from 24 patients (20.8%) and neuropathy in 2 from 20 patients (10%). In the PV group, we found information about retinopathy in 4 from 25 patients (16%), about nephropathy in 7 from 30 patients (23.3%) and neuropathy in 6 from 30 pacientes (20%).\n\nConclusions: Although the limited number of patients, our results are similar to previous national studies and emphasize the difficulties associated with the treatment of T1DM patients in routine clinical care and the need for improved treatment quality.\n\nP4 AAV9-mediated enhanced fatty-acid oxidation reverts obesity-induced hepatic steatosis\n\nMineia Weber Blattes1, Paula Mera2, Fina Casas3, David Sebastián4, Raquel Fucho5, Vicenta Llorente6, Laura Herrero2, Dolors Serra2\n\n1Universidade Franciscana, UFN, Santa Maria, Brazil; 2Department of Biochemistry and Physiology, Universitat de Barcelona, UB, Barcelona, Spain; 3Centro de Investigación Biomédica enRed de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas (CIBEREHD), Barcelona, Spain; 4Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), Universitat de Barcelona, UB, Barcelona, Spain; 5Centro de Investigación Biomédica enRed de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas, Barcelona, Spain; 6Institute of Biomedical Research of Barcelona (IIBB), Barcelona, Spain\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P4\n\nIntroduction: Despite the enormous efforts of health care providers and the research community, rates of obesity continue to rise. Unfortunately, safe and efficient treatments are currently unavailable. Of great concern is the parallel increase in the prevalence of obesity-associated pathological conditions such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Hence it is vital to develop novel therapeutic strategies for combating this epidemic.\n\nObjective: In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of safe nonimmunoreactive adeno-associated virus (AAV) to mediate the expression of a permanently active mutant form of the human carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (hCPT1AM), the key enzyme in fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), in the liver of a mouse model of high-fat diet-induced obesity and NAFLD. Moreover, we searched for new potential lipid biomarkers for monitoring liver steatosis in humans.\n\nMethods: We used two viruses to express in mouse liver a human mutated isoform of CPT1A(hCPT1AM) or green fluorescent protein (GFP), which was used as a control (AAV9-hCPT1AM and AAV9-GFP, respectively).\n\nResults: Our results showed that obese mice expressing hCPT1AM enhanced hepatic FAO which resulted in increased production of CO2, ATP, ketone bodies and heat. The increase in FAO activated autophagy, lipolysis and cholesterol mobilization in liver. As a result, the blood glucose levels and liver steatosis was reduced in hCPT1AM-expressing mice. In addition, the increase in hepatic FAO altered the mice liver and serum lipidomic profile, which drew attention to the specific C20:0 ceramide C38:5 diacylglyceride and C50:1 triacylglyceride (TAG) species which could act as potential biomarkers for NAFLD reversion.\n\nConclusions: In summary, AAV-mediated expression of hCPT1AM in the liver of obese mice is sufficient to improve NAFLD. Moreover, our study revealed a potential circulating biomarker that might be useful to monitor hepatic steatosis and NAFLD improvement.\n\nP5 Action of antioxidant therapy on oxidative stress and systemic inflammation of diabetic rats\n\nHilary Barros de Carvalho, Natan Reyges Castro da Purificação, Melyna Soares de Souto, Mário Fernando da Costa Pinto Neto, Mariana Braga Sampaio, Luan Carvalho de Assunção Rocha, João Vitor Ferreira Assunção de Araújo, Naianne Kelly Clebis\n\nUniversidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte - Laboratório de Microscopia Celular e Tecidual/DMOR, Natal, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P5\n\nIntroduction: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a disease that leads to hyperglycemia and increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, which can cause morphofunctional changes in different organs, with severe damage to the body.\n\nObjective: This study aimed to analyze the effects of antioxidant treatment on the oxidative stress and systemic inflammation indicators in rats with diabetes mellitus.\n\nMethodology: Twenty male rats were divided into four groups (n = 5): N (normoglycemic); D (diabetic); NT (normoglycemic treated with antioxidants) and; DT (diabetic treated with antioxidants). DM was induced by streptozotocin (35 mg/kg body weight). Antioxidant treatment was performed with: quercetin (100 mg/kg body weight), l-glutamine 1% and α-tocopherol 1% for 60 days. Blood glucose, MDA, GSH, IL-1β and IL-10 levels were analyzed. Fisher’s test was used (p < 0.05).\n\nResults: Hyperglycemia was observed in D and DT, being higher in DT than in D. MDA and GSH levels were similar in D and N, and higher in DT than NT. There was no difference in IL-1β levels between D and N, and between DT and D. However, the concentration of 1L-10 was lower in D than in N and higher than DT and D. In NT there was a reduction of 1L. -10 compared to N.\n\nConclusions: The findings indicate that the combined treatment with antioxidants did not change the plasmatic glucose levels in DT. In addition, the experimental model used in this research did not generate oxidative stress in the untreated groups, while in the treated groups there was an increase in MDA (pro-oxidant) and GSH (antioxidant) levels suggesting a tentative of the organism in balancing the oxidative-antioxidant system. No induction of systemic inflammation (IL-1β levels) was identified, but antioxidant treatment promoted to increased activity of the anti-inflammatory pathway (IL-10 levels) in DT animals, indicating that antioxidants may be adjuvant in diabetes mellitus treatment, but further studies are needed to better elucidate these findings.\n\nKeywords: Hyperglycemia; Oxidative stress; Inflammation.\n\nP6 Acute effect of isometric handgrip exercise on the glycemic response of physically active type 2 diabetics: randomized clinical trial\n\nTheo Victor Alves Soares do Rêgo, Pedro Cauê Nunes De Oliveira e Silva, Gabriel Lima De Souza, Ricardo Azevedo Cavalcanti Aragão, Rodrigo dos Santos Rodrigues Alves, Jonathan Nícolas Dos Santos Ribeiro, Cláudio Barnabé Dos Santos Cavalcanti, Denise Maria Martins Vancea\n\nUniversidade de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P6\n\nIntroduction: The possibility of obtaining specific benefits with exercises for small muscle groups, such as those of handgrip, is already known in the current literature, however, the relationship of this type of exercise on the glycemic response of type 2 diabetics is not clear.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the effect of a single session of an isometric handgrip protocol on the glycemic response of physically active type 2 diabetics.\n\nMethods: It was a randomized controlled clinical trial (Ethics Commitment: 36498714.7.0000.5207). The research was conducted in the morning, in a laboratory of a Northeastern Public University. The sample was non-probabilistic, consisting of 16 physically active type 2 diabetics aged 68 ± 12 years. Diabetic patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the control group (CG—n = 8) and the intervention group (GI—n = 8). With a dynamometer, the maximum voluntary contraction force (MVCF) was measured in both hands. For the session, 50% of the load found in the MVCF test was used, applying the unilateral protocol of four sets of five repetitions, kept 10” in isometric contraction and 20” in recovery, with 60” rest between series and alternation of the hands. Capillary blood glucose was collected pre-intervention, immediately after, 30 and 60 min after the intervention with isometric handgrip protocol in both groups. The ANOVA parametrictest for repeated measures was performed. The program used was SPSS 20.0. A significance level of p ≤ 0.05 was considered.\n\nResults: According to the data analysis, GI capillary blood glucose showed a significant decrease between pre-intervention and immediately after (pre 164.1 ± 36.7, post 137 ± 24.9, p = 0.01) and also between the moments immediately after and 60 min after the intervention (pre 137 ± 24.9, post 118.3 ± 20, p = 0.04).\n\nConclusion: The isometric handgrip protocol was able to promote a decrease in capillary blood glucose in physically active type 2 diabetics.\n\nP7 Acute effects of a moderate intensity exercise session on cognitive function and serum concentration of neurotrophic factors in type 1 diabetics\n\nNascimento MCC, Prado LS\n\nUniversidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P7\n\nIntroduction: Previous studies indicate that the cognitive function (executive function) of people with type 1 diabetes can be affected by the sudden glycemic variation in the first years of life. However, studies also show improvement of cognitive function with regular exercise, regardless of modality. The explanation for this may be associated with the production of some neurotrophic factors, such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).\n\nObjective: To compare cognitive performance responses and serum concentrations of neurotrophic factors in patients with type I diabetes after a single session of coordinative and aerobic exercise.\n\nMethods: After approval by the Research Ethics Committee, the sample was selected by convenience and consisted of 23 individuals aged 8 to 18 years, diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and at least 3 years of disease duration. Two groups were defined: (I) Aerobic Exercise and (II) Coordinating Exercise, according to the activity they would perform in the first experimental session. The stages were performed in a weekend colony for type 1 diabetic patients for 2 days and consisted of blood collection, application of cognitive tests and exercise session previously elaborated. Blood collection and cognitive tests were applied before and immediately after each exercise session.\n\nResults: It was observed that the coordinative exercise caused greater positive changes (reduction of time and number of errors, and increase of correct answers) in 6 variables of the applied psychological tests, while the aerobic exercise caused changes in only 2 of these variables. However, when adjusted by the baseline, this difference becomes significant for only two variables. Regarding blood dosages, before and after the coordinating exercise session, BDNF values (17.56 ± 3.40 and 17.73 ± 2.50, p = 0.959) and IGF-1 (1.32 ± 0.95 and 1.59 ± 1.17, p = 0.384), respectively. Before and after the aerobic exercise session, the results were BDNF (17.56 ± 1.79 and 17.89 ± 3.31, p = 0.959) and IGF-1 (1.58 ± 1, 17 and 1.92 ± 1.43, p = 0.384), respectively.\n\nConclusions: The results obtained suggest that improvements in executive function may be greater after exercises with more pronounced demands for motor coordination and sensory integration (coordinative exercise). Plasma concentrations of BDNF and IGF-1 did not change as a result of the physical exercises studied.\n\nKeywords: Diabetes; Exercise; Cognition\n\nP8 Acute physical exercise promotes peripheral analgesia by activation of the opioidergic system in mice with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)\n\nWilliam Valadares Campos Pereira, Douglas Lamounier de Almeida, Igor Dimitri Gama Duarte, Sérgio Henrique Sousa Santos, Thiago Roberto Lima Romero\n\nDepartamento de Farmacologia, Instituto de ciências Biológicas, ICB-UFMG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P8\n\nIntroduction: Diabetic neuropathy is the most prevalent complication of diabetes in the population and affects the life’s quality of patients. The painful symptoms are difficult to control, leading researchers to investigate alternative treatment strategies. Few studies has investigated the role of peripheral endogenous modulation of pain caused by exercise in this pain.\n\nObjective: The aim of this study was to investigate peripheral activation of the opioid system in diabetes-induced hyperalgesia in a maximal progressive exercise session in Swiss mice.\n\nMethods: This study was approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (CEUA, Brazil). Diabetes was induced with a high fat diet consisting of 39% carbohydrate, 17% protein and 44% fat, totaling 4.27 kcal per gram of diet. The rats underwent 12 h of fasting to perform insulin resistance and glucose intolerance tests. Allodynia was measured according to the paw pressure test (Kawabata et al., 1992). To perform this protocol, a treadmill operated by an electric motor was used. After acclimation with the device, the mice were subjected to fatigue exercise, where the speed was increased at a rate of 1 m per minute every 3 min until fatigue (American Physiological Society, 2006), maintaining a constant inclination of fatigue. 5% Naloxone, a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, was kept in the freezer in a stock solution dissolved in saline.\n\nResults: Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance tests showed differences between groups. Insulin resistance (p = 0.0018) and glucose intolerance (p = 0.0065). Allodynia was observed in rats fed DHF were observed at the thirteenth week of treatment (p = 0.0322). There was a significant difference in nociceptive threshold in the groups submitted to the progressive maximal exercise protocol until the time fatigue (p = 0.0003) in relation to the groups kept at rest. There was a significant difference in nociceptive threshold following the progressive maximal exercise protocol for fatigue between the groups receiving naloxone (p < 0.0001)) and the groups receiving saline. The effects of naloxone were observed up to 60 min after injection, when the nociceptive threshold returned to baseline levels.\n\nConclusions: The progressive-maximal physical exercise protocol until fatigue, induces peripheral analgesia via the opioid system in the diabetic neuropathic pain model in Swiss mice fed 40% high fat diet.\n\nP9 Acute supplementation with flavanol-rich cocoa improve glycemic control after incremental treadmill exercise and decrease expression of TRB3 in liver and skeletal muscle on type 2 diabetic (T2DM) rats\n\nBruno Pereira Melo1, Pedro Henrique Madureira Ogando1, Aline Cruz Zacarias1, Joyce Camila Cruz de Oliveira1, João Gabriel da Silveira Rodrigues1, Elsa Heyman2, Romain Meussen3, Danusa Dias Soares1\n\n1Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; 2Université de Lille, Lille, France; 3Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P9\n\nIntroduction: Tribbles homolog 3 protein (TRB3) is a pseudo-kinase capable of binding to protein kinase B (Akt), inhibiting its phosphorylation, hindering glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Physical exercise and flavanol consumption improvesglucometabolism, oxidative stress and vascular function, but the effects of this combination have been poorly investigated.\n\nObjective: To verify the acute effects of flavanol-rich cocoa supplementation alone or associated to exercise on insulin, glucose and in TRB3 expression in liver and skeletal muscle of T2DM rats.\n\nMethods: 64 Wistar rats (250 ± 10 g) had T2DM induced by consumption of high-fat diet (46%Fat; 43%CHO; 11%Pro) plus fructose diluted in water for 30 days. The rats were allocated into non diabetics (CON) and diabetic group (T2DM) and performed an incremental treadmill exercise test (EXE) or rested (SED), supplemented with flavanol (COCOA) or placebo (PLA, same substance without flavanol). The cocoa powder (NATUREX©, France) was diluted in water (1.8 ml kg−1) and administered one hour before the EXE via oral gavage (45 mg kg−1). The EXE consisted of running on a treadmill (Panlab®) at a speed of 10 m min−1, increased by 1 m min−1 every 3 min until fatigue. TRB3 expression was quantified by quantitative PCR real time and serum insulin concentrations by ELISA. Blood glucose levels were assessed before gavage, before and after EXE and during 60 min of recovery with a glucometer (Accu-chek Performa, Roche®).\n\nResults: The physical performance parameters were not different between groups and situations (p > 0.05).T2DM rats supplemented with flavanol showed an attenuation on the elevation of blood glucose concentrations during recovery after exercise, with glucose values similar to CON supplemented with placebo (p = 0.001). In addition, both flavanol supplementation and exercise reduced insulin concentrations when compared to the placebo and non-exercise supplemented group (4.76 ± 0.57; 4.82 ± 0.34 vs. 7.15 ± 0.61 ng mL−1, respectively). When combined, exercise and flavanol reduced (p = 0.001) the expression of hepatic and skeletal muscle TRB3 in the T2DM group.\n\nConclusion: Acute supplementation of cocoa flavanol may help glycemic control after exercise in T2DM and in non-diabetic rats by diminishing hepatic glucose production and increasing muscle glucose uptake through reduction on liver and muscle TRB3 expression.\n\nFinancial support of Minas Gerais State Agency for Research and Development (FAPEMIG).\n\nP10 Adherence and persistence for dulaglutide (DU) vs. basal insulin (BI) in injection- naïve patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D): the dispel TM study\n\nAnderson Leandro Couto Peres Ribeiro1, Reema Mody2, Qing Huang3, Maria Yu4, Xian Zhang3, Liya Wang3, Michael Grabner3, Hiren Patel2\n\n1Eli Lilly and Company, São Paulo, Brazil; 2Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, USA; 3HealthCore, Inc., Wilmington, USA; 4Eli Lilly and Company, Toronto, Canada\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P10\n\nIntroduction and Objectives: Adherence and persistence are key considerations in patient-centric treatment selection for T2D management. The objective of this retrospective real-world study was to assess 1-year adherence and persistence using different measures among injection-naïve patients with T2D initiating DU vs. BI. Methods: A US claims database was used to identify patients with T2D initiating DU or BI between Nov’14–Apr’17 (index date = earliest fill date). Patients ≥ 18 years, with no claim for any antidiabetic injectable in the 6 months pre-index period (baseline), continuous enrollment and ≥ 1 HbA1c result at baseline and 1-year post-index were included. Two widely used measures for assessing persistence of injectables in the real-world were implemented. DU users were propensity-matched 1:1 to BI users.\n\nResults: Matched cohorts (903 pairs) were balanced in baseline patient characteristics with mean age of 54 years. At 1-year follow-up, matched DU patients were significantly more likely to be adherent [PDC ≥ 80%, n (%)] than BI patients [516 (57.1%) vs. 262 (29%); p < .001). When measuring persistence as no gap between fills > 45 days [n (%)], more BI [605 (67.0%)] vs. DU [367 (40.6%)] patients discontinued their therapy but more BI [422 (69.8%)] vs. DU [141 (38.4%)] patients restarted their index therapy. More DU [519 (57.5%)] vs. BI [317 (35.1%)] patients discontinued based on the 90th percentile measure, and more DU [320 (61.7%)] vs. BI [126 (39.7%)] patients restarted their index therapy.\n\nConclusion: In this real-world study, DU demonstrated higher adherence than BI. Given the results, the most appropriate persistence measure may vary for different classes of antidiabetic injectables.\n\nP11 Adhesion of diabetic patients to dietary treatment\n\nTiciane De Oliveira Albuquerque, Alesson Silva Damasceno, Aldona Kubica2, Helena Alves De Carvalho Sampaio, Mayanne Iamara Santos De Oliveira Porto, Luiza De Carvalho Almeida, José Tercio Pereira De Carvalho, Carlos Cardoso Neto\n\nUniversidade Estadual do Ceará, Fortaleza, Brazil; 2Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P11\n\nIntroduction: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease of multifactorial nature, considered a public health problem, with high rates of morbidity and mortality.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the adherence of diabetic individuals to dietary treatment.\n\nMethodology: The study was conducted in the city of Fortaleza, in a Primary Health Care Unit (UAPS). The sample consisted of 37 users with diabetes, aged 18 years or older, both sexes and literate, with no previous history of heart atack or coronary surgery. In addition to people who did not meet the above criteria, pregnant women and those with cognitive problems that compromised their understanding of the interview topics were excluded. An adherence scale was applied, which is in the process of validation and contains 10 questions. The scale was developed in partnership with researchers from Brazil and Poland. Each item has 5 answer alternatives, with scores ranging from 0 to 4 on each item, with a maximum total of 40 points. The scale contained areas that included questions about knowledge of adequate nutrition, following the guidelines offered by professionals, discussing feeding with professionals and behaviors related to changing eating habits with or without professional consent. To classify the quality of adherence, the cutoff point of 75% was adopted, so that adherence was considered satisfactory if the individual reached at least 30 points. The study was submitted and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the State University of Ceará, through PlataformaBrasil, CAAE 180546130.0000.5534. Results: Of the 37 patients, 34 were women. Low adherence was prevalent, 22 (59.5%) patients. This is a matter of concern, considering the importance of proper dietary management in the presence of T2DM.\n\nConclusion: The evaluated diabetic patients have low adherence to the oriented diet. The situation demands educational actions to promote the improvement of this adherence.\n\nP12 Adhesion of hypertense patients to dietary treatment\n\nAnael Queirós Silva Barros1, Alesson Silva Damasceno1, Aldona Kubica2, Helena Alves De Carvalho Sampaio1, Mayanne Iamara Santos De Oliveira Porto1, Luiza De Carvalho Almeida1, José Tercio Pereira De Carvalho1, Carlos Cardoso Neto1\n\n1Universidade Estadual do Ceará, Fortaleza, Brazil; 2Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P12\n\nIntroduction: Systemic Arterial Hypertension (SAH) is a chronic multifactorial disease and constitutes a risk factor for the development of other cardiovascular diseases. Diet therapy is a non-drug treatment strategy for hypertension, but loses much of its effectiveness due to the low adherence of patients to nutritional recommendations.\n\nObjective: To verify the adherence of hypertensive individuals to dietary treatment.\n\nMethods: Validation clipping of the dietary adherence scale developed by researchers in Brazil and Poland. Data were collected at Primary Health Care Units (UAPS) in Fortaleza. A sample of 91 hypertensive patients, aged ≥ 18 years, both sexes, literate, with no previous history of heart atack or coronary surgery. Pregnant women with cognitive problems that compromised the understanding of the interview were excluded, as well as those who did not meet the above requirements. A 10-item dietary adherence scale was applied, with 5 alternatives and a score ranging from 0 to 4. Final score ranges from 0 to 40. The scale contained areas that included questions about knowledge of adequate nutrition, following the guidelines offered by professionals, discussing feeding with professionals and behaviors related to changing eating habits with or without professional consent. Satisfactory adherence was considered when 75% (≥ 30 points) were achieved. The study was submitted and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the State University of Ceará, trough PlataformaBrasil, CAAE 180546130.0000.5534.\n\nResults: 68.1% (62) of respondents had poor adherence. This situation puts patients at risk to health because it can prevent proper control of blood pressure levels.\n\nConclusion: There is a need for the development of educational actions that sensitize this public to adherence to dietary guidelines to improve the control of hypertension.\n\nP13 Adhesion to diabetes mellitus type 2 medical treatment\n\nVicente Rubens Reges Brito, Mariana Rodrigues da Rocha, Letícia Gonçalves Paulo, Patrícia Regina Evangelista de Lima, Rafaela Pereira Lima, Bruna Araújo Gomes, Mayla Rosa Guimarães, Ana Roberta Vilarouca da Silva\n\nUniversidade Federal do Piauí, Picos, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P13\n\nIntroduction and objectives: Adherence to drug treatment is critical for a good diabetic patient response to therapy. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate drug treatment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nMethods and results: Analytical study and cross-sectional, conducted with 78 users with type 2 diabetes mellitus, accompanied by five Family Health Strategies in the city of Picos-Piauí. Data were collected through a form concerning sociodemographic data and the Brazilian version of the Treatment Adherence Measure, which one is used for to evaluate the behavior patient regarding daily use of prescription drugs. Data were collected from February to April 2018 and analyzed using the descriptive and analytical statistics. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Piauí, according opinion n. 2.429.535. The results indicated the predominance of female (71.8%), had between 50 and 60 years of age (61.5%), brown (56.4%), married or cohabiting with a partner (66.7%), with 0 to 9 years of study (52.6%), attended public schools (82.0%), retired people (52.6%), with a habit of reading at least one textual source (65.4%), monthly income greater than one salary to three minimum wages (47.4%), economy class C2 (21.8%). In the sample selection, 43.6% of people have never forgotten to take diabetes control drugs, 35.9% were rarely careless with the hours of taking medications, 87.2% never forgot to take their medication because they felt better, 89.7% never forgot to take them because they felt worse, 94.8% never took more pills than the prescribed amount, on his own initiative, for feeling worse, 65.4% never interrupted treatment because they let their drugs finished, and 89.7% never stopped taking their medications for any other reason, unless the doctor’s recommendation. The mean score for adherence to medication treatment was 5.51 ± 0.491 (mean ± standard deviation) which reveals that 87.2% of the patients were considered adherent to the therapy.\n\nConclusion: Thus, conclude that the most of the participants in the sample had adherence to drug treatment. The study is of fundamental importance for health professionals, since it allows knowing the profile of users with diabetes and promoting actions that encourage their participation in treatment.\n\nKeywords: Medication adherence; Diabetes Mellitus; Adherence to treatment.\n\nP14 Allogenic adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells and vitamin d supplementation in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus: a 3-month follow-up study\n\nDébora B. Araujo de Pina Cabral1, Joana Rodrigues Dantas1, Leandra S. Baptista2, Carmen Lúcia Kuniyoshi Rebelatto3, Carlos Eduardo Barra Couri4, José Egídio Paulo de Oliveira1, Lenita Zajdenverg1, Melanie Rodacki1\n\n1Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Nutrology and Diabetes Department, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 2National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology (Inmetro), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; 3Core Cell Technology, Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil; 4University of Sao Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P14\n\nAdipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells (ADMSCs) and vitamin D has emerged as a potential treatment for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) due to their intrinsic regenerative capacity and immunomodulatory properties.\n\nObjective: To evaluate safety and efficacy of ADMSCs infusion from healthy donors and daily cholecalciferol (VitD) supplementation in patients with recent-onset T1D, after a 3-month follow-up.\n\nMethods: This is a prospective, dual-center, open trial, phase II, in which patients with recent onset T1D received a single dose of ADMSCs (1x106 cells/kg) and cholecalciferol 2000UI/day for 3 months. They were compared to controls with standard insulin therapy. Adverse events, C-peptide (CP) after mixed meal, insulin dose, HbA1c and CD45+CD3+CD4+FoxP3+ T-cells frequencies (flow cytometry) were measured at baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T3). Time in range (TIR) and glycemic variability were calculated by retrospective analysis of 72 h continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM).\n\nResults: 13 patients were included (8 received ADMSCs + VitD or group 1 and 5 standard insulin therapy or group 2), with a mean age of 26.7 ± 6.1 years and mean T1D duration of 2.9 ± 1.05 months. Adverse events were transient headache (n = 8), mild local reactions (n = 7), tachycardia (n = 4), abdominal cramps (n = 1), thrombophlebitis (n = 4), scotomas (n = 2), central retinal vein occlusion (n = 1, complete resolution). After intervention, insulin requirement was lower in group 1 than in group 2 (0.22 ± 0.17 vs 0.61 ± 0.26 IU/kg, p = 0.01), respectively. Two patients in group 1 became insulin free, for 4 and 8 weeks each. At T3, group 1 had larger reduction of HbA1C (1.21 ± 0.18 vs 0.94 ± 1.28%; p = 0.04), larger area under the curve of CP (211.20 ± 100.42 vs 106.05 ± 47.25 ng/ml min;p = 0.05) and more glucose reading in TIR (89.4 ± 13.5 vs 57.50 ± 9.19%; p 0.02) than group 2. Moreover, at T3 all patients (n = 8) of group 1 were in honeymoon phase (insulin dose ≤ 0.5 IU/kg and HbA1c < 7.5%) vs none in group 2 (p = 0.01). There was an inverse correlation between VitD vs insulin dose (p = 0.01; r = 0.77) and HbA1C (p = 0.03; r = 0.67). CD4 + FoxP3 + had a negative correlation with HbA1C (p = 0.01; r = 0.71), SD (p = 0.01, r = 0.82) and MODD (p = 0.04, r 0.77), but not with MAGE (p = 0.77; r = 0.12).\n\nConclusion: Allogenic ADMSCs infusion + cholecalciferol without immunosuppression proved to be safe and may be an effective approach for the treatment of patients with recent onset T1D, but a larger follow up is still required.\n\nP15 Analysis of cost–benefit of the most consumed sweeteners currently\n\nAna Paula Varela Sanches1, Josilene Lopes de Oliveira1, Maíra Schuchter Ferreira1, Camila Neves Rodrigues2\n\n1Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil; 2Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P15\n\nIntroduction: Sweeteners are products that have emerged, as an alternative to the use of sugar, it has been described for use by diabetic people or people who need sugar restriction by medical recommendation. The most consumed sweeteners are non-caloric, including aspartame, sucralose, sodium saccharin and steviol glycoside. With this great tendency to always follow the physical pattern that is imposed by society, many people end up changing their habits, and include in their routine the use of sweeteners. Comparing the price of these products in the market, people often end up opting for the product that has the lowest price. The consequences are that the lowest price can have adverse effects on other parameters. From the exposed data, the objective of this study was to verify the sweetener types that are most consumed today and to identify their cost–benefit.\n\nMethodology: We searched for information regarding the categories of sweeteners present in the food market and compared the sweetener cost with the advantage of the product.\n\nResults: We listed 23 types of sweeteners, including liquid and powders sweeteners, which can be used at high temperatures for recipe preparation, and those common, used day-by-day. Among them is cyclamate/Saccharin, that is a bitter taste sweetener, some studies have shown that it can have adverse effects on rats, but is widely used for its price, our research showed that this type of sweetener is among the cheapest. Sucralose is the intermediate sweetener, its structure is formed by two carbohydrate molecules, high sweetening power and under normal temperatures is not carcinogenic. However, when heated becomes harmful, can generate mutations, be absorbed and accumulated in the body. Aspartame is among the most expensive sweeteners, is made from two natural proteins, has no bitter taste and is more similar to sugar, compared to other sweeteners, no carcinogenic effect of this compound has been reported in experimental studies. However, it is the more expensive sweetener wich makes buying difficult, especially for people who make continuous use.\n\nConclusion: Currently we can find various types of sweeteners in the food market, but those with less adverse effects are usually more expensive and consequently less consumed.\n\nP16 Analysis of the efficacy of ginger in reducing glycemic levels of adults with type 2 diabetes\n\nGerdane Celene Nunes Carvalho1, Márcio Flávio Moura de Araújo3, José Cláudio Garcia Lira Neto2, Laise Maria Formiga Moura Barroso1, Vírginia Leyla Santos Costa Urtiga2, Fabiana Nayra Dantas Osternes1, Fabrícia Kelly Moura Dantas1, Marta Maria Coelho Damasceno2\n\n1Universidade Estadual do Piauí, Teresina, Brazil; 2Universidade Federal de Ceará, Fortaleza, Brazil; 3Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nDiabetology & Metabolic Syndrome 2019, 11(Suppl 1):P16\n\nIntroduction and objectives: Controlling type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been a challenge, and factors such as insufficient knowledge about the d"
