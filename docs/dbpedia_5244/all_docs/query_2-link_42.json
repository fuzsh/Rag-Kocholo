        "text": "“A 300 game and an 800 series,” said Steve Pinto, 67, of New Bedford, “are the two things I ever wanted to accomplish (in bowling). Now that I have done them, whatever I get is gravy.”\n\nLast year the right-handed bowler bowled his first 300 and recently, in the Twilight League at Wonder Bowl, he bowled his first 800, an 803, surpassing his previous career-high 778 series that he bowled last year.\n\nHe claims he was just bowling along, not really thinking about an 800 and didn’t know he had bowled one until the end of the third game when team captain, Bob Faria, told him he went 803.\n\n“I was in the zone all night,” said Pinto. “I knew I was bowling well, but I was talking to the guys and I wasn’t feeling any pressure. I think if I had known I was close, the outcome would probably have been different. Who knows what would have happened.”\n\nHe bowled 257, 278 and 268 games all considerably over his 208 average.\n\nJust prior to his career-high series, Pinto purchased a new ball, a DV8 Hooligan.\n\n“Since I purchased the ball,” he said, “I’ve been bowling a lot better and my average has improved. Ryan Sanchez (from F/X Pro Shop at Wonder Bowl), who drilled the ball, just used the measurements from my old ball.”\n\nHe says he’s had more good days than bad since using the new ball.\n\n“These days,” he said, “the bowling equipment makes it easier to score better than the equipment that was available 20 or more years ago.”\n\nPinto started bowling in the early 1960s in the Junior Program at Wonder Bowl. As a member of the junior’s, he was on the Travel League and bowled in centers all around the area.\n\n“We bowled the full circle,” he said. “We bowled at (the former) Bowlers Country Club in Fairhaven, (the former) Holiday Lanes in Dartmouth, Holiday Lanes in Somerset, Taunton Ten Pin and Westgate Lanes in Brockton.”\n\nAfter the juniors, he attended college at William Penn University in Oskaloosa, Iowa, and after he graduated and returned to the area, he picked up a bowling ball again bowling at Bowlers Country Club where he bowled until they closed their doors about 15 or so years ago.\n\nNow he bowls at Wonder Bowl in only the Twilight League.\n\n“I used to bowl the Center League, as well,” said Pinto, “but due to a wrist injury, I had to cut down to one league.”\n\nWhen the wrist has healed properly, he intends to pick up the Center League again.\n\nIn the meantime, Pinto finds bowling relaxing and likes to be with his friends, the same group he’s bowled with for the last 30-40 years.\n\n“I hope I have a few more good years ahead of me,” he said.\n\nUpcoming events\n\nThe Massachusetts State USBC Bowling Association’s 56th annual Championship Tournament is today and May 16-17 at Westgate Lanes in Brockton. Walk-ins are welcome based on lane availability.\n\nA NEBA Singles Tournament is May 16-17 at Lang’s in Cranston. For information, or to sign up, visit www.BowlNEBA.com.\n\nBack by popular demand is the Sport Shot Challenge 7 p.m. Monday nights starting May 18 at Holiday Lanes in Westport. Weekly fee is $10 per bowler. Format is three games across three pair of lanes. There will be three, four-week sessions with a shot change each session. It’s not a league, it’s a challenge, so missed weeks are not a problem.\n\nWonder Bowl has an Adult/Child Doubles League starting May 14 at 6:30 p.m. One adult and one youth bowler comprise a team that will bowl four games per week. Weekly fee is $10 per bowler.\n\nWonder Bowl has an Adult/Child League starting May 18 at 6:30 p.m. Three or four bowlers comprise a team and each team needs to have at least one youth bowler. Weekly fee is $10 per bowler.\n\nWonder Bowl has a Junior Doubles League starting May 26 at 6:30 p.m. Two youth bowers comprise a team that will bowl four games a week. Weekly fee is $10 per bowler.\n\nIn case you’re looking for the popular Summer Classic League (sponsored by Columbia 300) at Wonder Bowl, it doesn’t start until June 3 beginning with warmups at 6:50 p.m. and league competition starting at 7 p.m. Three bowlers (any combination of males or females) comprise a team that will bowl four games a week with two different games bowled against two different opponents. Last summer this league had 34 teams and if the league can get 40 teams this summer, $500 will be added to the prize fund. Early sign-up is encouraged. Weekly fee last year was $25 (league meeting prior to first squad of bowling, may change the fee for this summer).\n\nHighlights\n\nJosh Carroll, in the Gary’s Best League at Wonder Bowl, bowled an 816 series that included 289, 248 and 279 games.\n\nTyler Perry, in the Massachusetts USBC Youth Association annual Championship Tournament in\n\nChicopee, bowled an 837 series that included a 300 game on May 2, in the singles event.\n\nKevin Baptiste, in the Westport Trios at Holiday Lanes in Westport, bowled a 300 game on April 27.\n\nDennis Bedard, in the Twilight League at Wonder Bowl, bowled a 300 game on May 1.
