        "text": "Felipe Saad was born on 11 September 1983 in Santos, Brazil. He currently plays as a central defender forÂ Caen.\n\nA young player began his professional career playing for homeland clubs VitÃ³ria and Paysandu. On 10 July 2007, Saad signed a two-year contract with a French club FC Guingamp. Having successfully passed all hardships in the club, Felipe became the undisputed leader of the team, being trained by Steven PelÃ© (one of the best defenders from LigueÂ 2).\n\nUnlike most of his countrymen, the player settled down to the new life quite fast. The footballer was assisted by his fellows Eduardo Ribeiro and Steven Pinto-Borges, who also performed for Guingamp and were quite popular among the team fans. The players appreciated such good qualities of Saad as kindness andÂ generosity.\n\nFelipe won the Coupe de France with the squad in the match against Stade Rennais Football Club in May,Â 2009.\n\nIn July 2010, after three years at Guingamp, the footballer moved to Ligue 1 side Evian Thonon Gaillard FC. During a two-year stint at the club he made a total of 19Â appearances.\n\nIn 2012, Felipe Saad joined AC Ajaccio for one season and later switched toÂ Caen."
