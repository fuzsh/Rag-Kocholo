        "text": "In Jurassic Park, Richard Attenborough’s John Hammond marvels at his involvement as genial ringmaster of what would surely be the biggest animal show ever staged, considering that he got his start running a flea circus. Like his character, Attenborough had done it all in show business, acting in some 65 movies, ranging from the forgettable to some of the biggest hits of all time (Jurassic Park among them) and having directed a dozen more, including several celebrated epic biopics (most notably, Gandhi). If nothing else, Attenborough, who died at the age of 90 after a long stretch of poor health, was a showman.\n\nBorn in 1923 in Cambridge, England, Attenborough studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, then interrupted his newborn stage career to serve as an air-gunner cameraman in the Royal Air Force during World War II, in which post he suffered permanent ear damage. After the war, he resumed his acting career, but while his early breakthrough in Brighton Rock (both the play and the film) was in the role of vicious gangster Pinkie Brown, Attenborough came to be known for playing military men. He made his screen debut in the naval-themed In Which We Serve (1942) and played an airman in Journey Together (1945). He played sailors again in Morning Departure (1950), The Gift Horse (1953), and The Baby and the Battleship (1956). There was also the comedy Private’s Progress (1956), Dunkirk (1958), 1959’s Breakout (his first movie about British prisoners plotting their escape from a POW camp), and Desert Patrol (1962).\n\nHe finally made his Hollywood debut playing both soldier and schemer in the 1963 classic The Great Escape. As Roger “Big X” Bartlett, he’s the one who comes up with the complicated plan to escape from the POW camp, and he’s a standout among a cast that includes Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Coburn, and Charles Bronson. His triumph led to more military roles (Guns at Batasi, The Sand Pebbles), but also to roles in more unusual fare, like Séance on a Wet Afternoon (as the husband of a medium behind a kidnapping scheme), air crash survivor drama The Flight of the Phoenix, musical Doctor Dolittle, and crime drama 10 Rillington Place, in which Attenborough played a serial killer.\n\nAttenborough moved into directing in 1969 with Oh, What a Lovely War, an anti-war musical inspired by the horrors and absurdities of World War I. He followed that with his first biographical film, Young Winston (1972), where the youthful Churchill’s (Simon Ward) military career was the subject of Attenborough’s comprehensive and exhaustive approach. An epic Allied failure in World War II was the subject of Attenborough’s 1977 drama A Bridge Too Far, with an all-star cast that included Laurence Olivier, Sean Connery, Gene Hackman, and James Caan.\n\nHis directing career peaked with 1982’s Gandhi, tracing the Mahatma’s journey from lawyer to nonviolent liberator of India. The epic, whose quiet, contemplative tone suited its subject, made an instant star out of Ben Kingsley. Nominated for 11 Oscars, it won eight, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor.\n\nAttenborough continued to make large-scale biographical dramas, including 1987’s Cry Freedom (giving Denzel Washington one of his first major screen roles as anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko), 1992’s Chaplin (which earned Robert Downey Jr. an Oscar nomination as the silent comedy legend), 1994’s Shadowlands (with Anthony Hopkins as Narnia author C.S. Lewis), and 1996’s In Love and War (starring Chris O’Donnell as Ernest Hemingway, seen during the World War I events that inspired the author’s \"A Farewell to Arms\").\n\nIn 1993, after a 14-year hiatus from acting, Steven Spielberg lured the 69-year-old back in front of the camera to play the visionary but foolhardy impresario behind Jurassic Park. His John Hammond could have been a villain, but Attenborough gave him charm, charisma, and pathos. The role suddenly revived his acting career, which continued with roles in Miracle on 34th Street (as Kris Kringle), Jurassic sequel The Lost World, and Elizabeth, where he played a wary adviser to Cate Blanchett’s naïve Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nFittingly, his last work as a director was the 2007 film Closing the Ring, a story of a World War II romance whose loose ends are tied up half a century later. Attenborough himself was married for nearly 70 years to his fellow RADA student Sheila Sim; their marriage produced three children and lasted from 1945 until his death/her death in 2014. As actors, Attenborough and Sim co-starred in the original 1952 London production of Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap, which, at 60+ years, is still the longest-running play ever. His brother was famed naturalist David Attenborough, who survives him.\n\nIn 2008, Attenborough suffered a stroke that left him confined to a wheelchair, effectively ending his 65-year film career. Nonetheless, that year, he and longtime business partner Diana Hawkins published a joint memoir, Entirely Up to You, Darling. Promoting the book, Attenborough said he dismissed much of his early movie work as fluff, movies that had no positive impact outside the cinema. “Unless you use this extraordinary invention to some degree to make the cry for compassion or the plea for tolerance or whatever it is,” he said, “then you deny the genius of its invention.”\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump’s GOP Swings and Misses With Desperate Attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nRepublicans built a campaign around assailing Joe Biden.
