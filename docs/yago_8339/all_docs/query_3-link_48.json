        "text": "It almost goes without saying that Sir David Attenborough is a national treasure.\n\nThe natural historian and TV documentary presenter, age 97, has given the public more than 100 programmes – covering the majesty of nature, the wonders of wildlife and the dangers of climate change.\n\nFans have recently enjoyed the likes of the Giant Sea Monster, Dinosaurs: The Final Day, and Planet Earth 3 on the BBC, as well as Apple TV’s Prehistoric Planet, while recent shows Our Planet and A Life On Our Planet remain streamable on Netflix.\n\nRead all the latest David Attenborough news here.\n\nLittle is known about Sir David’s family life, though on occasion he has spoken of his late wife Elizabeth.\n\nBut did the couple, who were married for almost 50 years, share any children?\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\nWho are David Attenborough’s children, Robert and Susan?\n\nSir David Attenborough has two children: a son named Robert and a daughter named Susan.\n\nAnd it seems the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, as Robert is a senior lecturer in bioanthropology for the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University in Canberra.\n\nIt’s also widely-reported that daughter Susan is a former primary school headmistress.\n\nLittle else is known about them, as they appear to both have opted for a life away from the glare of the camera lens.\n\nBut given the grand old age of Sir David, it’s safe to assume they are approaching retirement age themselves. Back in 2017, they were reported to be in ‘their 50s’.\n\nIn the past, BBC presenter has spoken about wishing he were around more for his children when they were young.\n\nSpeaking to Louis Theroux in Radio Times, he said: ‘If I do have regrets, it is that when my children were the same age as your children, I was away for three months at a time.\n\n‘If you have a child of six or eight and you miss three months of his or her life, it’s irreplaceable, you miss something.’\n\nRobert and Susan’s mum, Elizabeth, married Sir David in 1950. They were married for 47 years. Very sadly, she passed away in 1997 at the age of 70 from a brain haemorrhage.\n\nMORE : Sir David Attenborough issues warning to children over ‘dangerous’ exploits\n\nMORE : Sir David Attenborough, 97, seriously impressed by rare mating ritual\n\nMORE : Bizarre creature named after David Attenborough found after 60 years\n\nFollow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram"
