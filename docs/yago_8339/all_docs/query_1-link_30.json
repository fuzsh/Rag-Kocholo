        "text": "Sheila Sim, the British actress who was the widow of British actor and director Richard Attenborough, and starred with him in several films as well as in the original stage production of Agatha Christie’s “The Mousetrap,” died on Tuesday. She was 93.\n\nHer death was announced after a performance of “The Mousetrap” in Nottingham’s Theatre Royal. In the world premiere of the whodunit there in October 1952, she starred as Mollie Ralston, the proprietor of Monkswell Manor, opposite Attenborough. The couple moved with the production to the West End, where it has been playing continually ever since.\n\nSince 2013 Sim had been living in Denville Hall, a London retirement home for actors, and she had been suffering from dementia.\n\nSim and Attenborough were married from January 1945 until his death in August 2014 at age 90.\n\nOn the big screen the couple worked together in 1947’s “Dancing With Crime,” 1948’s “The Outsider” and 1951’s “The Magic Box."
