        "text": "Tributes are being paid to Oscar-winning director Richard Attenborough, who dominated the British film business for more than half a century.\n\nLord Attenborough, who won two Academy Awards for directing and producing Gandhi in 1983, died at lunchtime on Sunday. He was 90.\n\nThe British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) described its former president as a \"titan of British cinema\" who set an example of \"industry, skill and compassion\" that business would do well to live up to.\n\nHe was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) and championed the British film business for more than 60 years as an actor, director and prolific movie-maker.\n\nGandhi was the highlight of his career, winning eight Oscars, including best film. He also directed Young Winston, A Bridge Too Far, Chaplin and Cry Freedom.\n\nAs an actor he won acclaim for starring roles in films such as Brighton Rock, The Great Escape and 10 Rillington Place.\n\nLord 'Dickie' Attenborough was born in Cambridgeshire in 1923 and educated at Wyggeston Grammar School and Emmanuel College Cambridge.\n\nHe was the older brother of naturalist Sir David Attenborough.\n\nHe married the actress Sheila Sim when he was 21. His son Michael was born in 1949, followed by two daughters, Jane and Charlotte.\n\nTragedy struck on Boxing Day 2004 when his elder daughter Jane Holland, her daughter Lucy, and her mother-in-law, also Jane, died in the south-Asian tsunami.\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg said: \"Dickie Attenborough was passionate about everything in his life - family, friends, country and career.\n\n\"He made a gift to the world with his emotional epic Ghandi and he was the perfect ringmaster to bring the dinosaurs back to life as John Hammond in Jurassic Park.\n\n\"He was a dear friend and I am standing in an endless line of those who completely adored him.\"\n\nDavid Cameron said: \"His acting in Brighton Rock was brilliant, his directing of Gandhi was stunning - Richard Attenborough was one of the greats of cinema.\"\n\nBaroness Royall of Blaisdon, Labour's leader in the House of Lords, said she was \"proud\" that the actor was a Labour peer.\n\nFormer Cabinet minister Peter Hain also paid tribute to the \"brilliant actor and film director\" who he also hailed as an \"anti-Apartheid, Labour and Chelsea Football Club stalwart\".\n\nIn a statement on their website, Chelsea said: \"Chelsea Football Club is tonight deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our Life President Lord Attenborough.\n\n\"His personality was woven into the tapestry of the club over seven decades. He will be greatly missed.\""
