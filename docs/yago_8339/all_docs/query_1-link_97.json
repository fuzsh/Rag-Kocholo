        "text": "Lord Attenborough, the celebrated director of Oscar-winning film Gandhi, is reportedly living in a care home in London with his wife Sheila Sim.\n\nAccording to his family, he is now too unwell to care for himself.\n\nThe couple is under full-time care by trained staff at a care home in west London, the Daily Express reported.\n\nEarlier it had been reported that Attenborough, 89, and his actress wife Sim, 90, had sold their house in Richmond, south-west London, for $11.5million.\n\nTheir son, Michael, has now confirmed that the family home had been sold and that his father has been at a care home with his wife since then.\n\nHe further added that the director never fully recovered after a stroke in 2008 that left him in a coma for several days.\n\nSince then he had been in a wheelchair and found it hard to communicate and move around.\n\nAttenboroughâ€™s wife was also reported to be suffering from senile dementia."
