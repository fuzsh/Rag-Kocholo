        "meta_description": "Attenborough was born in Isleworth, west London, but grew up in College House on the campus of the University College, Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal. He is the middle of three sons (his elder brother, Richard, became an actor and his younger brother, John, an executive at Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo). During World War II, through a British government initiative known as Kindertransport, his parents also fostered two Jewish refugee girls from Europe.\r\n\r\nAttenborough spent his childhood collecting fossils, stones and other natural specimens. He received encouragement in this pursuit at age seven, when a young Jacquetta Hawkes admired his \"museum\". A few years later, one of his adoptive sisters gave him a piece of amber filled with prehistoric creatures; some 50 years later, it would be the focus of his programme The Amber Time Machine.\r\n\r\nAttenborough was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and then won a scholarship to Clare College,",
