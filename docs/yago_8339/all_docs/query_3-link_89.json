        "text": "The beloved Sir David Attenborough has long been a firm household name. As a naturalist, this is all the more remarkable considering his area of expertise is not exactly what you’d describe as mainstream pop culture.\n\nBorn on May 8, 1926, the 95-year-old pretty much began his broadcasting career at the BBC and is still producing programmes for the Beeb, like tonight’s (December 3) Attenborough’s Wonder of Song.\n\nSir David is the only person to have won BAFTAs in all of the categories black and white, colour, high-definition, 3D and 4K resolutions - and he was knighted in 1985.\n\nREAD MORE:BBC Richard Osman's House of Games: Stephen Mangan's Holby City star wife and parents who tragically both died of cancer\n\nThe broadcaster is arguably best known for writing and presenting the innovative nine natural history documentary series forming the Life collection, a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth.\n\nThese feats are all, again, especially remarkable considering the 95-year-old did not own a TV when starting out in his career - and had only seen one programme in his life.\n\nNow the naturalist is a vocal advocate in support of environmental causes, such as the protection of endangered species and the conservation of nature around the world.\n\nBut behind the success of his nature documentaries like Planet Earth, Blue Planet and Dynasties, was the sadder reality that his work was helping him cope with his wife’s death, reported The Express .\n\nDavid was married to Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel for 47 years before her death in 1997.\n\nJane was from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, and died after collapsing with a brain haemorrhage aged 70.\n\nThe presenter had been filming The Life of the Birds in New Zealand as Jane fell ill, but he made it back to the UK to be with his wife before she died.\n\nIn his memoir Life on Air, David wrote about Jane’s final moments.\n\nWhen he flew home he found her in a coma, and a doctor suggested he hold her hand.\n\nHe wrote: “She did, and gave my hand a squeeze.\n\n“The focus of my life, the anchor had gone…now I was lost.”\n\nHe said in 2009, according to The Express : “I coped by working. It was the most fantastic luck that I was able to work.\n\n“If my life had gone a different way - say I had gone into the oil business, which I once considered doing - I would have been out at 60.”\n\nDavid and Jane had two children, Robert and Susan, who are believed to both be in their 50s.\n\nTheir daughter is a former primary school headmistress and still lives in the UK, while their son is a senior lecturer in biological anthropology at the Australian National University in Canberra.\n\nDavid still lives in his family home in Richmond Upon Thames, London, after his wife died over 24 years ago.\n\nDo you have a story you think we should be covering?
