        "text": "Richard Samuel Attenborough, Baron Attenborough, CBE (/ˈætənbərə/; 29 August 1923 – 24 August 2014), was an English actor, filmmaker, entrepreneur, and politician. He was the President of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). Attenborough joined the Royal Air Force during World War II and served in the film unit. He went on several bombing raids over Europe and filmed action from the rear gunner's position. He was the older brother of Sir David Attenborough, a naturalist and broadcaster, and John Attenborough, an executive at Alfa Romeo. He was married to actress Sheila Sim from 1945 until his death.\n\nAs a film director and producer, Attenborough won two Academy Awards for Gandhi in 1983, receiving awards for Best Picture and Best Director. The BFI ranked Gandhi the 34th greatest British film of the 20th century. He also won four BAFTA Awards and four Golden Globe Awards. As an actor, he is perhaps best known for his roles in Brighton Rock, The Great Escape, 10 Rillington Place, The Sand Pebbles, Miracle on 34th Street (1994) and Jurassic Park.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nTemplate:Moresources Attenborough was born on 29 August 1923[1] in Cambridge, the eldest of three sons of Mary Attenborough (née Clegg), a founding member of the Marriage Guidance Council, and Frederick Levi Attenborough, a scholar and academic administrator who was a fellow at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and wrote a standard text on Anglo-Saxon law.[2][3] Attenborough was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and studied at RADA.\n\nIn September 1939, the Attenboroughs took in two German Jewish refugee girls, Helga and Irene Bejach (aged 9 and 11 respectively), who lived with them in College House and were adopted by the family after the war when it was discovered that their parents had been killed. The sisters moved to the United States in the 1950s and lived with an uncle, where they married and took American citizenship; Irene died in 1992 and Helga in 2005.[4][5]\n\nDuring World War II, Attenborough served in the Royal Air Force. After initial pilot training he was seconded to the newly formed Royal Air Force Film Production Unit at Pinewood Studios, under the command of Flight Lieutenant John Boulting (whose brother Peter Cotes would later direct Attenborough in the play The Mousetrap) where he appeared with Edward G. Robinson in the propaganda film Journey Together (1943). He then volunteered to fly with the Film Unit and after further training, where he sustained permanent ear damage, qualified as a sergeant, flying on several missions over Europe filming from the rear gunner's position to record the outcome of RAF Bomber Command sorties.[6]\n\nActing career[]\n\nAttenborough's acting career started on stage and he appeared in shows at Leicester's Little Theatre, Dover Street, prior to his going to RADA, where he remained Patron until his death. Attenborough's first major credited role was provided in Brian Desmond Hurst's The Hundred Pound Window (1944) playing Tommy Draper who helps rescue his accountant father who has taken a wrong turn in life. Attenborough's film career had, however, began in 1942 in an uncredited role as a sailor deserting his post under fire in the Noël Coward/David Lean production In Which We Serve (his name and character were accidentally omitted from the original release-print credits), a role which would help to type-cast him for many years as a spiv or coward in films like London Belongs to Me (1948), Morning Departure (1950) and his breakthrough role as Pinkie Brown in John Boulting's film adaptation of Graham Greene's novel Brighton Rock (1947), a part that he had previously played to great acclaim at the Garrick Theatre in 1942.\n\nIn 1949, exhibitors voted him the sixth most popular British actor at the box office.[7]\n\nEarly in his stage career, Attenborough starred in the West End production of Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, which went on to become the world's longest running stage production. Both he and his wife were among the original cast members of the production, which opened in 1952 at the Ambassadors Theatre and as of 2014 is still running at the St Martins Theatre. They took a 10 percent profit-participation in the production, which was paid for out of their combined weekly salary (\"It proved to be the wisest business decision I've ever made... but foolishly I sold some of my share to open a short-lived Mayfair restaurant called 'The Little Elephant' and later still, disposed of the remainder in order to keep Gandhi afloat.\")[8]\n\nAttenborough worked prolifically in British films for the next 30 years, including in the 1950s, appearing in several successful comedies for John and Roy Boulting, such as Private's Progress (1956) and I'm All Right Jack (1959).[9]\n\nIn 1963, he appeared alongside Steve McQueen and James Garner in The Great Escape as RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (\"Big X\"), the head of the escape committee, based on the real-life exploits of Roger Bushell. It was his first appearance in a major Hollywood film blockbuster and his most successful film thus far.[9] During the 1960s, he expanded his range of character roles in films such as Séance on a Wet Afternoon (1964) and Guns at Batasi (1964), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM). In 1965 he played Lew Moran opposite James Stewart in The Flight of the Phoenix and in 1967 and 1968, he won back-to-back Golden Globe Awards in the category of Best Supporting Actor, the first time for The Sand Pebbles, again co-starring Steve McQueen, and the second time for Doctor Dolittle starring Rex Harrison. He won the 1967 Best Supporting Actor Award for The Sand Pebbles. [9]\n\nHis portrayal of the serial killer John Christie in 10 Rillington Place (1971) garnered excellent reviews. In 1977, he played the ruthless General Outram, again to great acclaim, in the Indian director Satyajit Ray's period piece The Chess Players.[9]\n\nHe took no acting roles following his appearance in Otto Preminger's version of The Human Factor (1979) until his appearance as John Hammond in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993) and the film's sequel, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). He starred in the remake of Miracle on 34th Street (1994) as Kris Kringle. Later he made occasional appearances in supporting roles, including as Sir William Cecil in the historical drama Elizabeth (1998), Jacob in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and as \"The Narrator\" in the film adaptation of Spike Milligan's comedy book Puckoon (2002).[10]\n\nHe made his only appearance in a film adaptation of Shakespeare when he played the English ambassador who announces that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead at the end of Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996).[9]\n\nProducer and director[]\n\nIn the late 1950s, Attenborough formed a production company, Beaver Films, with Bryan Forbes and began to build a profile as a producer on projects including The League of Gentlemen (1959), The Angry Silence (1960) and Whistle Down the Wind (1961), appearing in the cast of the first two films.[9] His performance in The Angry Silence earned him his first nomination for a BAFTA. Seance On A Wet Afternoon won him his first BAFTA award.\n\nHis feature film directorial debut was the all-star screen version of the hit musical Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), after which his acting appearances became sporadic as he concentrated more on directing and producing. He later directed two epic period films: Young Winston (1972), based on the early life of Winston Churchill, and A Bridge Too Far (1977), an all-star account of Operation Market Garden in World War II.[9]\n\nHe won the 1982 Academy Award for Best Director for his historical epic Gandhi, and as the film's producer, the Academy Award for Best Picture; the same film garnered two Golden Globes, this time for Best Director and Best Foreign Film, in 1983. He had been attempting to get the project made for 18 years.[9] He directed the screen version of the musical A Chorus Line (1985) and the anti-apartheid drama Cry Freedom (1987). He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Director for both films.[9]\n\nHis later films as director and producer include Chaplin (1992) starring Robert Downey Jr., as Charlie Chaplin and Shadowlands (1993), based on the relationship between C. S. Lewis and Joy Gresham (the star of the latter was Anthony Hopkins, who had appeared in four previous films for Attenborough: Young Winston, A Bridge Too Far, Magic and Chaplin).\n\nBetween 2006 and 2007, he spent time in Belfast, working on his last film as director and producer, Closing the Ring, a love story set in Belfast during World War II, and starring Shirley MacLaine, Christopher Plummer and Pete Postlethwaite.[11]\n\nDespite maintaining an acting career alongside his directorial roles, Attenborough never directed himself (save for an uncredited cameo appearance in A Bridge Too Far).[citation needed]\n\nLater projects[]\n\nAfter 33 years of dedicated service as President of the Muscular Dystrophy campaign, Attenborough became the charity's Honorary Life President in 2004. In 2012, the charity, which leads the fight against muscle-wasting conditions in the UK, established the Richard Attenborough Fellowship Fund to honour his lifelong commitment to the charity, and to ensure the future of clinical research and training at leading UK neuromuscular centres.[12]\n\nAttenborough was also the patron of the United World Colleges movement, whereby he contributed to the colleges that are part of the organisation. He was a frequent visitor to the Waterford Kamhlaba United World College of Southern Africa (UWCSA). With his wife, they founded the Richard and Sheila Attenborough Visual Arts Centre. He founded the Jane Holland Creative Centre for Learning at Waterford Kamhlaba in Swaziland in memory of his daughter who died in the tsunami on 26 December 2004.\n\nHe was a longtime advocate of education that does not judge upon colour, race, creed or religion. His attachment to Waterford was his passion for non-racial education, which were the grounds on which Waterford Kamhlaba was founded. Waterford was one of his inspirations for directing the film Cry Freedom, based on the life of Steve Biko.[citation needed]\n\nHe founded The Richard Attenborough Arts Centre on the Leicester University campus in 1997, specifically designed to provide access for the disabled, in particular as practitioners.[citation needed]\n\nHe was elected to the post of Chancellor of the University of Sussex on 20 March 1998, replacing The Duke of Richmond and Gordon. He stood down as Chancellor of the university following graduation in July 2008.[13] There now hangs a 42 inch by 46 inch portrait of him in the newly opened Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts on the university campus.[citation needed]\n\nA lifelong supporter of Chelsea Football Club, Attenborough served as a director of the club from 1969–1982 and between 1993 and 2008 held the honorary position of Life Vice President. On 30 November 2008 he was honoured with the title of Life President at the club's stadium, Stamford Bridge. He was also head of the consortium Dragon International Film Studios, which was constructing a film and television studio complex in Llanilid, Wales, nicknamed \"Valleywood\". In March 2008, the project was placed into administration with debts of £15 million and was considered for sale of the assets in 2011.[14]\n\nA mooted long-term lease to Fox 21 fell through in 2015 though the facilities continue to be used for filmmaking.[15]\n\nHe had a lifelong ambition to make a film about his hero the political theorist and revolutionary Thomas Paine, whom he called \"one of the finest men that ever lived\". He said in an interview in 2006 that \"I could understand him. He wrote in simple English. I found all his aspirations – the rights of women, the health service, universal education... Everything you can think of that we want is in Rights of Man or The Age of Reason or Common Sense.\"[16][17][18] He could not secure the funding to do so.[19] The website \"A Gift for Dickie\" was launched by two filmmakers from Luton in June 2008 with the aim of raising £40m in 400 days to help him make the film, but the target was not met and the money that had been raised was refunded.[20][21]\n\nThere are a sound studio at Pinewood, a dubbing studio at Twickenham and a cinema in Knightsbridge all named after him and RADA are building a new theatre to be named after him.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nAttenborough's father was the principal of University College, Leicester, now the city's university. This resulted in a long association with the university, with Attenborough becoming a patron. The university's Embrace Arts at the RA centre,[22] which opened in 1997 is named in his honour. He had two younger brothers: naturalist and broadcaster David; and John (died 2012), who had made a career in the motor trade.\n\nAttenborough married actress Sheila Sim in Kensington on 22 January 1945.[23][24] From 1949 until October 2012 they lived in Old Friars on Richmond Green in London.\n\nIn the 1940s, he was asked to 'improve his physical condition' for his role as Pinkie in Brighton Rock. He was asked to train with Chelsea Football Club for a fortnight, subsequently becoming good friends with those at the club. He went on to become a director during the 1970s, helping to prevent the club losing its home ground by holding onto his club shares and donating them – worth over £950,000 – to Chelsea. In 2008, Attenborough was appointed Life President of Chelsea Football Club.[25]\n\nOn 26 December 2004, the couple's elder daughter, Jane Holland (30 September 1955 – 26 December 2004), along with her mother-in-law, Audrey Holland, 81, and Attenborough's 15-year-old granddaughter, Lucy, were killed when a tsunami caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake struck Khao Lak, Thailand, where they were on holiday.[26][27][28]\n\nA service was held on 8 March 2005 and Attenborough read a lesson at the national memorial service on 11 May 2005. His grandson Samuel Holland, who survived the tsunami uninjured, and granddaughter Alice Holland, who suffered severe leg injuries, also read in the service.[citation needed] A commemorative plaque was placed in the floor of St Mary Magdalen's parish church in Richmond. Attenborough later described the Boxing Day of 2004 as \"the worst day of my life\". Attenborough had two other children, Michael (born 13 February 1950) and Charlotte (born 29 June 1959). Michael is a theatre director formerly the Deputy Artistic Director of the RSC and Artistic Director of the Almeida Theatre in London and has been married to actress Karen Lewis since 1984; they have two sons, Tom and Will. Charlotte is an actress, and has two children.[citation needed]\n\nHe publicly endorsed the Labour Party in the 2005 General Election, despite his opposition to the Iraq War.[29]\n\nAttenborough collected Picasso ceramics from the 1950s. More than 100 items went on display at the New Walk Museum and Art Gallery in Leicester in 2007, in an exhibition dedicated to family members lost in the tsunami.[30]\n\nIn 2008 he published an informal autobiography entitled Entirely Up to You, Darling in association with his colleague Diana Hawkins.[citation needed]\n\nIllness and death[]\n\nIn August 2008, Attenborough entered hospital with heart problems and was fitted with a pacemaker. In December 2008, he suffered a fall at his home after a stroke[31] and was admitted to St George's Hospital, Tooting, southwest London. In November 2009, Attenborough, in what he called a \"house clearance\" sale, sold part of his extensive art collection, which included works by L. S. Lowry, Christopher R. W. Nevinson and Graham Sutherland, generating £4.6 million at Sotheby's.[32]\n\nIn January 2011, he sold his Rhubodach estate on the Scottish Isle of Bute for £1.48 million.[33] In May 2011, David Attenborough said his brother had been confined to a wheelchair since his stroke in 2008,[31] but was still capable of holding a conversation. He added that \"he won't be making any more films.\"[34]\n\nIn June 2012, shortly before her 90th birthday, Sheila Sim entered the professional actors' retirement home Denville Hall, for which she and Attenborough had helped raise funds. In October 2012, it was announced that Attenborough was putting the family home, Old Friars, with its attached offices, Beaver Lodge, which come complete with a sound-proofed cinema in the garden, on the market for £11.5 million. His brother David stated: \"He and his wife both loved the house, but they now need full-time care\".[35] It simply isn't practical to keep the house on any more.\"[36] In December 2012, in light of his deteriorating health, Attenborough moved into a nursing home in London to be with his wife, as confirmed by their son Michael.[31]\n\nAttenborough died on 24 August 2014, five days before his 91st birthday.[37][38] He was survived by his wife of 69 years, their two children, six grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, and his younger brother David. His widow died on 19 January 2016.[citation needed]\n\nHonours and styles[]\n\nBritish state honours[]\n\nIn the 1967 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).[39] He was made a Knight Bachelor in the 1976 New Year Honours,[40] having the honour conferred on 10 February 1976[41] and on 30 July 1993 he was created a life peer as Baron Attenborough, of Richmond upon Thames in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.[42][43]\n\nAlthough the appointment by John Major was 'non-political' (it was granted for services to the cinema) and he could have been a crossbencher, Attenborough chose to take the Labour whip and so sat on the Labour benches. In 1992 he had been offered a peerage by Neil Kinnock, then leader of the Labour Party, but refused it as he felt unable to commit himself to the time necessary \"to do what was required of him in the Upper Chamber, as he always put film-making first\".[44]\n\nStyles of address[]\n\n1923–1967: Mr Richard Attenborough\n\n1967–1976: Mr Richard Attenborough CBE\n\n1976–1993: Sir Richard Attenborough CBE\n\n1993–2014: The Rt Hon. The Lord Attenborough CBE\n\nOther honours[]\n\nAttenborough was the subject of This Is Your Life in December 1962 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Savoy Hotel, during a dinner held to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Agatha Christie play The Mousetrap, in which he had been an original cast member.[9]\n\nIn 1983, Attenborough was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian award,[45] and the Martin Luther King Jr. Nonviolence Peace Prize by the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change.[46]\n\nIn 1992 he was awarded the Shakespeare Prize for his life's work by the Alfred Toepfer Foundation in Hamburg.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1993, Attenborough was appointed a Fellow of King's College London.[47]\n\nOn 13 July 2006, Attenborough, along with his brother David, were awarded the titles of Distinguished Honorary Fellows of the University of Leicester \"in recognition of a record of continuing distinguished service to the university\".[48][49]\n\nOn 20 November 2008, Attenborough was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Drama from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD) in Glasgow.[50]\n\nAttenborough was an Honorary Fellow of Bangor University for his contributions to film making.[51]\n\nPinewood Studios paid tribute to his body of work by naming a purpose-built film and television stage after him. The Richard Attenborough Stage has an area of 30,000 sq ft. In his absence because of illness, Lord Puttnam and Pinewood Chairman Lord Grade officially unveiled the stage on 23 April 2012.[52]\n\n\"Journalism News Network\", Arts for India to honour Sir Richard Attenborough posthumously, September 16, 2016\n\nArts for India charity committee to honour Sir Richard Attenborough posthumously on 19 October 2016 at an event hosted at the home of BAFTA.[53]\n\nCorporate appointments[]\n\nActors Charitable Trust.

Attenborough is portrayed by Eric Idle as effusive and simpering.\n\nA similar portrayal to that seen in Monty Python can be seen in the early series of Spitting Image, when Attenborough's caricature would regularly appear to thank others for an imagery award.\n\nIn 2012 Attenborough was portrayed by Simon Callow in the BBC Four biopic The Best Possible Taste about Kenny Everett.\n\nStyles[]\n\nRichard Attenborough, Esq.
