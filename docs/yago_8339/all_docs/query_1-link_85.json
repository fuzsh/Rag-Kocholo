        "text": "This is a somewhat minor though quite memorable British noir from the postwar period. It stars real-life couple Richard Attenborough and Sheila Sim (married for 69 years) in the lead roles.\n\nAttenborough is an ex-military twenty-something who has been through the war and now works as a cab driver. Sim plays his girlfriend who goes with him to meet up with one of Attenborough pals (Bill Owen) from the service. While having drinks and soaking up the atmosphere at a local Palais de Danse (public dance hall), the two guys catch up on old times.\n\nIt is obvious that while Attenborough is on the right side of the law, Owen is not. A short time later, Owen is seen consorting with black marketeers, some of whom run the dance hall. Mixed into this is a club hostess (Judy Kelly) who dances with customers and enjoys a relationship with both Owen and the head of the gang (Barry K. Barnes). To say she’s playing with fire is an understatement.\n\nOwen feels cheated on a deal, so there is a skirmish with him and Barnes, and he takes a bullet. While running from the dance hall, he spots the cab Attenborough drives, which had been left unattended for a few moments. Owen hops in the back and hides. Attenborough returns to the car and takes off, not realizing his friend is in the back, unconscious and dying.\n\nWhen Attenborough discovers his friend, it’s too late because Owen has died. This sets up the rest of the movie with Attenborough deciding to avenge Owen’s death and nail Barnes. One of the problems is getting evidence against Barnes, since all Attenborough has is a vague suspicion of Barnes’ guilt. The police show up at the dance hall to investigate since it was known Owen had dealings there.\n\nBarnes and his boss (Barry Jones) try to get their story straight. And Kelly will keep quiet, since she is afraid of being bumped off herself if she says too much to the authorities.\n\nIn order to obtain necessary evidence against Barnes, Attenborough’s girlfriend (Sim) decides to go undercover at the dance hall to work there alongside Kelly and the other molls. Sim is almost a bit too prim for the role, and she is not exactly believable as a ten-cents-a-dance chick. But she does provide a sincere performance.\n\nMuch of the movie involves Sim and assorted shady types in the dance hall, while Attenborough is out on the streets in his taxi trying to learn about the black market scheme, to make inroads against Barnes and the rest of the gang that way.\n\nThere are ongoing bits of business with the coppers still investigating everything, but we know Attenborough, set up as the hero of the story, will be the one who actually brings Barnes down. For the most part, the film moves at a quick enough pace; we have engaging performances from nearly all the cast; and there’s plenty of atmosphere with the dance hall at the center of everything.\n\nSome of the supporting players are just as good as Attenborough and Sim…in particular, I thought Judy Kelly went the extra mile to convey the frightened yet still independent nature of her character. Eventually she realizes she’s on the wrong side of the law and tells the police everything she knows. Her soft resignation in that moment is one of the better scenes."
