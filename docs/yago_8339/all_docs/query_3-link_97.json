        "text": "LONDON — British actor and film director Lord Richard Attenborough died yesterday, the BBC reported, citing his son, Michael. He was 90.\n\nOne of Attenborough’s greatest achievements was making the cinematic tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, for which he won an Oscar for best director. But he also won acting fame for roles such as a theme-park owner in Jurassic Park.\n\nAttenborough was born in Cambridge, England. Knighted in 1976 and made a life peer as Baron Attenborough in 1993, he was the elder brother of naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough.\n\nRichard Attenborough played his first film part in Noel Coward’s 1942 movie In Which We Serve. He later joined the Royal Air Force as a pilot.\n\nAttenborough starred in such movies as The Great Escape, Seance on a Wet Afternoon, The Flight of the Phoenix, The Sand Pebbles, Doctor Dolittle, 10 Rillington Place, Brannigan, Jurassic Park and The Lost World: Jurassic Park.\n\nGandhi, a $22 million epic, won eight Oscars, including best picture, in 1982. That was a record for a British film.\n\nThe movie was the culmination of Attenborough’s 20-year effort to bring Gandhi’s life story to the big screen, an obsession that began when he read a biography of him in 1962. To keep his project alive, Attenborough is said to have mortgaged his house, sold his cars, hocked his paintings and taken roles in what he deemed “crap movies.”\n\nHe also directed 10 other movies, including Young Winston, A Bridge Too Far, A Chorus Line, Cry Freedom, Chaplin and Shadowlands.\n\nAttenborough, a tireless worker for charities, had a stroke in 2008 and had to use a wheelchair thereafter. He had been living in a home for those in the theatrical profession with his wife, Sheila Sim."
