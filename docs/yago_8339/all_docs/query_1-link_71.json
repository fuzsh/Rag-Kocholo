        "text": "The Haileybury Society was delighted to hear from John Knights (Ha 46) recently about his years at Haileybury, including when the school was used in the making of the 1948 film, the Guinea Pig, starring Richard Attenborough.\n\nThe Guinea Pig was a well-intentioned if somewhat whimsically optimistic film in which Attenborough, playing the son of a working class tobacconist, is given a scholarship to the fictional Saintbury public school. The film was based on Warren Chetham-Strode’s response to the issues of social mobility in education arising from the 1940s Fleming Report for the Board of Education.\n\nSomeone draws the eye\n\nThe film was largely shot at Sherborne in Dorset but Haileybury, being close to Britain’s cinema making centres in Hertfordshire and the south east, formed the backdrop for some of the scenes. It was during the filming of these scenes that Sheila Sim (later to become Lady Attenborough) and other actors (including Anthony Nicholls and Robert Flemyng) were to appear in the school grounds during a few halcyon days back in the 1940s.\n\nYet despite all the celebrity, it seems that there were other attractions that day. As John writes,\n\n“Sheila Sim came to Haileybury in 47/48 to take part in a film , probably the Guinea Pig , as they needed our pavilion and cricket pitch . Very exciting , especially as one of the extras was absolutely gorgeous , we all fell in love with her!”\n\nIt is not clear whether any of the boys succeeded in winning the gorgeous extra but John was able to obtain a wonderful photograph of Sheila (above) and also obtained her autograph – the photo is signed in ink on the back.\n\nA familiar backdrop?\n\nEagle-eyed film buffs watching the film will recognise Haileybury’s familiar cricket pavilion in the backdrop to one scene. While Sherborne gets the credit for the bulk of the locations, there’s no denying that the pavilion is grand enough to grace the greatest of films!\n\nWe are always grateful to hear from OHs about their memories of the time at the school. Please do send us your stories – we would love to share them with the entire OH community.\n\n(images: Apart from the photograph of Silvia on set, and her autograph, the remainder of the images in this article come from I Thank You Arthur, an excellent film blog celebrating films from many decades.)\n\nMore from The Haileybury Society\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all content and images on this website and blog © The Haileybury Society, 2024, all rights reserved\n\nSearch stories by date"
