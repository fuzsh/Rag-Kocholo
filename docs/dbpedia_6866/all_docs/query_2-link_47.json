        "text": "“When faced with making decisions about our children’s education, someone introduced us to New Horizon Christian Academy. New Horizon fits the perfect balance our family was looking for in both a quality, Christian education and a classroom of fun, friends and recess time together. My children come home learning both how to handle typical school situations with friends, as well as quoting Scripture and singing songs that glorify our Creator God. Parents are also given ample opportunity to volunteer in the school, getting to know the other children and the teachers/staff. We are so thankful for the impact that New Horizon Christian Academy has on our family.”\n\n“New Horizon Christian Academy has been a true blessing for our family. When our children were born, we talked about school and how we would never be able to afford to send them to a Christian school. The thought of sending our babies to public school pierced our hearts. We prayed for a Godly school that we could afford when it was time. We learned about NHCA from a friend and, took a tour. We fell in love with the teachers, staff and, the overall mission of NHCA. We currently have two children attending the school, K4 and 1 st grade. It has been remarkable to witness their growth academically and spiritually. Not only are they receiving quality education, they are also learning about Jesus. As a public-school social worker and Police officer, we recommend NHCA to any family who is wanting a safe place for their children to receive quality education not based on standardized testing but, geared to share the gospel and keep worldly influences out. We are thankful for NHCA.”\n\n“When we had both of our sons, we dedicated them to the Lord, promising God that we would, in our greatest effort, raise them in the knowledge and admonition of Jesus Christ. We believe that includes the eight hours a day they are away from us at school.\n\nLuke 6:40 says that when a student is fully trained, they will be like their teacher. In searching for a Christ-centered school, we saw at New Horizon Christian Academy the love that the teachers and staff had for the Lord and for the students. They did not look at their position as a job, but rather a ministry, even going without pay at times. That motivation behind their mission gave us as parents, the confidence and peace in trusting New Horizon Christian Academy with our son’s education. After seven years at the Academy, including the pilot year, we have seen the fruit of our decision without any regret, and look forward to attending many more years when our second son is old enough to attend.”"
