        "text": "This school used to be a fantastic place where everyone felt like family. In recent years, it has gone incredibly downhill. While most of the teachers are compassionate, talented, caring individuals, the administration is lacking those qualities. Bullying is prevalent but no official investigations are conducted. Test scores are embarrassingly low. Several teachers either don't have a teaching license or are licensed inappropriately. The older students will manipulate administrators into giving them privileges that other students do not have. Sexism is a huge issue. The school seems to be more of a money-making project for the church, rather than a mission to serve families. Not a single person on the administration team has an administrator license. Most have never taught full-time (or even have a teaching license/been through a teaching program), yet they feel comfortable making decisions that impact classroom learning.\n\nI had nine years at this school. The kids are perfectly fine and overall, they aren't nearly as bad as in a public school. The dress code isn't the greatest, but it's not the worst possible situation. What gave it a 2/5 is the administration and the head of school. A lot happened, and I do not agree at all with the way they handled it. My mother was also a teacher here and they fired her for not being a good enough christian, though they said she was an amazing teacher. They also backed up a coach who wasn't going to let me be involved in senior night for volleyball, even though I was a senior. Now, my sisters are leaving the system because of how much they hate it. There is also slight racism, I would say. One kid got expelled for having a nose peircing who was mixed, and another kid can get off with a warning if they're white. Overall, I don't want to go back to this school anymore, after everything that they had done to my family and I over this past year at the school.\n\nI am a senior at Horizon Christian School and I have been extremely blessed to attend a school with a very strong Christian community with awesome teachers. They encourage us to stay strong in the Lord and teach us how to build our relationship with Him! Staff is super kind and is there to talk to if you are struggling with anything. They really care about each student and their individual needs. Chapel is awesome with worship and a message lead by our head of school. The staff and faculty do an amazing job of showing the love of Christ to us. I would recommend this school to anyone who is looking for a great faith based school!! I hope you really consider this school. I have had an incredible experience.\n\nI love my school very much. It is a small Christian school with a beautiful campus. The small community makes for a lot of attention in the areas of school I struggle with, and accountability in my spiritual growth. The teachers are loving, caring, and supporting of all students. The campus is also a beautiful part of the school that they like to take advantage of wherever they can. i.e. walks in the woods, rock clibing wall during P.E., class outside when the weather is nice, and praying in various locations on campus. I would change the unity of the school though. Although it is very nice, I think there is room for improvement. I believe they are going to try to achieve that this year.\n\nMy experience with Horizon Christian school was amazing. The teachers were so helpful. It didn't matter whether they were busy with some of there own work or if they just got done helping four or five kids that came before you. They always found time to help you no matter what. Not to mention the atmosphere at Horizon was great. The teachers and administration made it a priority to make everyone feel needed and welcomed. I feel like the main reason that it felt that way was because of a saying that Horizon had, \"Be third\". The meaning of this saying is, God first, others second and yourself last. this wasn't just some saying that the teachers had on their walls and that they would say every now and then. This was a moto that they lived by. the only regret that I had while I was attending Horizon was that I only got to spend my junior and senior year there. I wish that I had my whole high school career there.\n\nI am SO glad my parents sent me here in middle school. This school is so amazing. Every teacher cares about every student and wants to guide them. Academics are amazing. I currently have a 4.0 GPA and I don't find it hard to keep it that way. There are many club options including robotics, chess, and more. This school has improved even my home life as it's helping me to grow in so many aspects. This school is unquestionably the best school I've ever attended."
