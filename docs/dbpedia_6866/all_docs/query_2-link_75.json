        "text": "Dear Parents and Friends of Horizon Prep,\n\nIn Mark 12:30 Jesus provides what is Biblically described as The Greatest Commandment. Citing Deuteronomy 6:5 Jesus declares we are to: “…love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and all your strength.” In Deuteronomy 6:7 Moses commands the people to “repeat” this teaching “again and again\" to their “children”. Clearly we are directed to instruct our children in the context of knowing this as The Greatest Commandment.\n\nHere at Horizon Prep we are committed to providing our children with an educational environment that declares the reality of this decree. Our commitment is to strive to provide our students with an education that is intellectually stimulating, academically sound, socially maturing, physically strengthening, and spiritually invigorating. We do this in a context that declares we are all called to love the Lord our God with our whole being. Horizon is dedicated to ensuring that your children will receive a Christ-centered education second to none.\n\nAcademic excellence and intellectual growth are of utmost importance to your child’s teacher and the staff of the school. However, simply providing an academically sound education is akin to getting to first base in a game. Getting to first base is important, but it’s not the game. We believe it is as your sons and daughters come to know and become knowledgeable about the world around them, in the context of knowing that the Lord our God, the Creator of all things, can be known and calls us to love and know Him, that they will be best positioned to play and ultimately succeed at the game of life.\n\nThe staff and I feel blessed to be a part of the ministry of Horizon Church. Serving at Horizon Prep is an honor. Being a part of your children’s lives is a high calling. We are excited about the new school year and look forward to all we will do together.\n\nTo God be the Glory,"
