        "text": "A New Beginningâ€¦\n\nEvery day New Horizon School (NHS) is making education accessible to students with learning disabilities, attention deficits and other learning differences that live in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nLocated in Renton, NHS serves grades 4-12 along with a transition program for after graduation. We meet students' needs by fostering an environment of acceptance, opportunity, and achievement.\n\nAcceptance comes from students knowing that the staff, faculty, and other students welcome them right where they are. Each student is recognized for their individual academic, social, and emotional growth and celebrated.\n\nOpportunity defines one of our core beliefs. We create an environment where students can succeed. Each student has the chance to try out different interests and fully experiment with different types of activities, giving them ideas for their choice of career or lifelong hobbies.\n\nAchievement is the pride a student feels when their grades reflect their hard work at an appropriate level. Each student learns to see themselves as successful and capable. They begin to recognize their unique abilities to learn."
