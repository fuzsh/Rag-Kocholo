        "text": "Our desire is for our students to be “rooted and built up in Him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness” Colossians 2:7\n\nBy providing an optimized learning environment, our educators are able to challenge our students with a robust academic curriculum that encourages critical thinking from a Biblical worldview. Key aspects of our comprehensive mission include character development, a Christ-centered college-prep curriculum including AP and honors classes, dual enrollment, fine and performing arts, athletics, daily Bible classes, and weekly chapel.\n\nI invite you to schedule a tour, meet our team, and see why our families and staff love being a part of the Horizon Christian Academy Community.\n\nThen he said to them all, “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.”\n\nLuke 9:23\n\n“Jesus replied: ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment.” Matthew 22:37‐38\n\n“Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all of its many parts for one body, so it is with Christ. For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body ‐ whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free ‐ and were all given the one Spirit to drink.”\n\n1 Corinthians 12:12‐13\n\n“Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.” Proverbs 22:6\n\n“And whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, and not human masters.” Colossians 3:23\n\n“I am sure of this, that he who started a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.” Philippians 1:6\n\n“These words that I am giving you today are to be in your heart. Repeat them to your children. Talk about them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.” Deuteronomy 6:6‐7\n\n“For you were called to be free, brothers and sisters; only don’t use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love. For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement: Love your neighbor as yourself.” Galatians 5:13‐14\n\n“... whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you will be a slave to all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” Mark 10:43‐45\n\n“And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone.” 1 Thessalonians 5:14\n\n“And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” Matthew 22:39‐40\n\n“A new command I give to you: Love one another. As I have loved you. So you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” John 13:34‐35\n\nThere is one God, eternally existent in three persons ‐ Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ was fully God, yet fully man, born of a virgin, and lived a sinless life, performing many miracles. We acknowledge His substitutionary death, resurrection, ascension and individual mediation for us, and eagerly await His personal return in power and glory.\n\nMatthew 28:19; Deuteronomy 6:4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Isaiah 7:14; Hebrews 4:15; 1Peter 2:24; 1 Corinthians 15:3; John 11:25; Mark 16:19; Acts 1:11\n\nAll people are created uniquely in the image of God to have fellowship with him but became alienated in that relationship through sinful disobedience. A reunion, called salvation, is possible only by faith in Jesus Christ, apart from works, through the regeneration of the Holy Spirit.\n\nTitus 3:5; Romans 3:23; Ephesians 2:8‐9; 1 Corinthians 12:12‐13; Genesis 1:26\n\nHCA is committed to its institutional mission to prepare students to be world changers by partnering with families through Christ-centered education and community. Since the founding of the school in 2000, those core beliefs have formed the foundational truths from which it operates as an educational ministry.\n\nAs a Christian community, HCA distinguishes itself by its covenantal commitments guided by our statement of faith and core values with participating families and staff members. In addition, due to the complexities of the operations of a K-12 school that includes multiple denominations, we want to be clear on some of the beliefs that will guide everyday decisions, policies, and school life. Our faculty, as ministers to our community, have committed to this statement and we ask all participating families understand and be aware of it.\n\nOur desire to be a God-honoring community requires that we seek to understand each other’s perspectives, extend grace often, and hold reasonable and realistic expectations of our community’s participants. It is the aim of HCA to promote Christian freedom by encouraging personal responsibility without becoming legalistic.\n\n“In the essentials unity, in nonessentials diversity, and in all things charity.” – Meldenius"
