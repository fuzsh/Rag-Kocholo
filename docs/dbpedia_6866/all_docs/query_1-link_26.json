Herdaughter Melody was bornwith Down syndrome andhas all of the difficulties thatcome with it, but she saysthat’s just what they are—difficulties.Rather than beingintimidated, they workedthat much harder to achievetheir goals, and Melody’s goalis to show her horse at theKlickitat County Fair.Melody is proof that no challengeis insurmountable.Melody’s older sister Mariahwas the Klickitat CountyFair and Rodeo Queen lastyear. Like many younger siblings,Melody wanted to belike her sister; showing herhorse at the fair. Last yearMelody and Diane weren’tquite prepared, but this yearwith the help of their 4-Hgroup, the Mount AdamsCommunity 4-H Club HorseDivision, they’re ready toroll. No member of the grouphas ever shown at the fair before,though two of the horseshad appeared.

He was reportedlyheaded south onSR97.“Within 30 seconds, wehad seven officers (includingSheriff’s deputies and StatePatrol) responding, cuttingoff roads to the south,” saidLt. Reggie Bartkowski.“When our officer arrived atthe scene and interviewedwitnesses, we discovered hethree times a week either atthe Glenwood arena or athome. Because Melody’s confidencetends to vary fromday to day, sometimes theywill get in a five-minute ride,sometimes an hour. “Melodyis very visual so we tried todo as much visually as possible,and I had to slow downand break it down for Mel,”says Doneva Vest-Brown, the4-H group’s leader. To makethings more visual, they’duse cones or markers to helpMelody. Seeing a visual representationhelped her to focus.The girls in the grouphelped Melody become amore confident rider. Theyencouraged her to do the exercisesand were patient,slowing down to help her.“Melody is such a fun, kind,loving, and sincere person.Having Mel involved for meand my kids is so wonderful.When she sees a need, shefills it,” says CynnamonHawkins, the assistant leaderof the group.Everyone in the 4-H grouphas worked to help Melodyand Diane overcome the challengesthat they have facedon their way to being preparedfor the fair this year.The help from each and everyperson has been invaluablein helping Melody and Dianeachieve their goals in beingable to participate in the fair.They turned their can’ts intocans as they made their waytowards this goal.Vehicle stolen fromMcDonalds’ parking lothad actually headed north.”Lt. Bartkowski says the originalcall to the dispatcher hadthe information correct. Subsequentcalls led to the wrongdirection being sent out bythe dispatcher. It was enoughof a head-start to allow thethief to escape.Police learned that a mandescribed as an adult NativeAmerican was in McDonaldsand had told a witness that hehad recently been releasedfrom prison. Witnesses saidthe man was in the parkinglot asking people for a ride. Averbal altercation occurredbetween the man and theowner of a white, 1993 Nissanpick-up. The suspect orderedthe man out of the pick-up atknife point. He complied andwas unharmed.The <strong>Goldendale</strong> Police Departmentcontacted the Departmentof Corrections(DOC) and local jails to seewho might have been recentlyreleased.
