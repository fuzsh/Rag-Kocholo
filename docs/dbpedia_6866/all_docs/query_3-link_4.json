        "text": "As a premier education provider in the Gorge, Horizon believes classrooms are a space to foster strong academics, nurture trusting relationships, where students feel respected, appreciated, and loved by the teachers, all while developing personal responsibility, self-control, decision making skills, self-confidence, and character building with high moral values based on Biblical truth. This is the Horizon way.\n\nWe continue to stand firmly on our mission to build a solid foundation for life by providing student with an excellent education that integrates our “ABC’s” – Academic achievement, Biblical truth, and Christian character development.\n\nWe proudly display sponsor banners on our athletic fields and gymnasium, provide advertising opportunities in our yearbook and all concert/athletic programs, promote business partners on our website, and more. Your support is of great value, and we desire to return that value by promoting your business to our growing community. Responses by August 9th ensure banners are in place for fall sports."
