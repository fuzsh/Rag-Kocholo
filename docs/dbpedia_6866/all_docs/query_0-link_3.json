        "text": "High School\n\nAt Horizon Christian High School we are committed to developing each student’s unique, God-given talents and gift, from football to math; music to language—are seen as a way to address, Jesus Christ, the ever-present, unchanging “audience of one.”\n\nOur curriculum is rigorous and balanced, and core subjects satisfy credits mandated by the State of Oregon for graduation and all courses are presented from a Biblical, Christ centered perspective.\n\nOver 70% of the students participate in one or more sports. Our Drama, choir and art programs open doors for students of all skill levels to be involved.\n\nStudent activities take center stage with the Harvest Party, 12 Days of Christmas, Color Wars, and Spring Formal. Clubs are another venue for students to be involved, develop leadership skills and serve God and the community.\n\nBy teaching students to love God and to love each other, Horizon Christian High School builds scholars and champions ready to both engage in intellectual and athletic pursuits and serve the community."
