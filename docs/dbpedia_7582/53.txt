Portrait in English

Nestling against the western slope of the Uetliberg, Uitikon offers a setting in close touch with nature and an environment in which it is a pleasure to live. Uitikon belongs to the district of Dietikon and hence to the Limmat Valley region. The advantages of our tax-sheltered commune (2020: 80%) are currently enjoyed by 4'661 residents (correct as end of 2019, percentage of non-Swiss residents 16%). In the authentic village centre we run the “Üdiker-Huus”, our attractive and much-used Community Centre.
