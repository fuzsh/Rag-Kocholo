        "text": "New employees\n\nInitially, you may want to participate in the UZH Welcome Day to get an overview of your new workplace and also get to know other new employees. This orientation event for all new employees is organized by HR and takes place twice a year either in German or English, either on Irchel Campus or in the center.\n\nUZH Human Resources (in German)\n\nPhD candidates and postdocs\n\nThere are several events taking place regularly at UZH, which are interesting for newcomers. VAUZ co-organizes a monthly get-to-know pub for PhDs and postdocs of UZH and ETH. It is a great opportunity for informal socializing. The Graduate Campus holds regular events such as Grüezi@UZH or the Postdoc Meet Up! These are also great networking and socializing opportunities. For more information visit their respective homepage.\n\nVAUZ events\n\nGRC events\n\nStudent Organizations and Associations\n\nUZH has a wide range of student associations: associations by subject, political associations and others, ranging from the AACZ (Academic Alpine Club of Zurich) to the philosophical circle \"Utopia\". Many of these associations also welcome PhD candidates and postdocs. A list of official student associations can be found on the UZH website.\n\nUZH student organizations and associations\n\nCity and Canton of Zurich\n\nThe Canton and the city of Zurich both offer information, events and courses to support the integration of newcomers. To learn more about their offers visit their websites:\n\nCity of Zurich Integration Support Services\n\nCanton of Zurich information for newcomers\n\nCanton of Zurich information for newcomers (more detailed, in German)\n\nDistricts and municipalities\n\nYour district or neighborhood area may also organize events. In the city of Zurich, you can find your local district’s community (“Quartierverein”) on the following website.\n\nCity of Zurich district communities (in German)\n\nMost districts have a list of societies and other information about the area published on their website. For an overview of the district websites, visit the website of the Social Services Department of the city of Zurich.\n\nCity of Zurich Social Services Department (in German)\n\nIf you live elsewhere in the Canton of Zurich, first choose your municipality from the website indicated below and then browse the municipality’s website in order to find information on events for newcomers or local associations.\n\nCanton of Zurich municipalities (in German)\n\nTo speak or at least understand the local language contributes to a large extent to a quick and smooth integration. But language classes also are great opportunities to meet and get to know new people. As they are probably in the same situation as you, it is easier to bond and you can exchange experiences and challenges you are facing in finding your way in your new surrounding.\n\nThere are many offers for German language classes in and around Zurich. The Language Center of UZH/ETH has classes for all levels and also organizes tandems. We're happy to support you in your search for the best language learning opportunity.\n\nLanguage Learning\n\nIn Switzerland it is more common that newcomers introduce themselves. To get to know your Swiss neighbors, you may have to take the lead and introduce yourself first or even invite them over for drinks. It may take a while to really get to know your neighbors – if you give it some time, you will eventually be invited in return.\n\nA good way to get to know like-minded people is joining a sports club. A great option for this are the ASVZ intensive courses, skiing camps or hikes, where you have more time to get familiar with new acquaintances and the nature and surroundings of your new home. Another possibility is to find people who share your interests, whether it be food, knitting or art, for instance in a meet-up group. You can either look for a matching group, or start your own.\n\nASVZ\n\nMeetups in Zurich\n\nIf you would like to also keep in touch with peers from your home country, there are plenty of expats platforms with branches in Zurich. These may be helpful to meet or exchange information with people in the same situation as yours. You will find the link to some popular organizations below.\n\nGlocals\n\nInterNations\n\nA listing of expats groups in Zurich and a magazine and city guide for expats can be found on these websites.\n\nExpatica\n\nTimeout"
