        "text": "Uitikon is a village and municipality in the district of Dietikon in the canton of Z端rich in Switzerland. Besides the village of Uitikon itself, the municipality includes the villages of Waldegg and Ringlikon.\n\nUitikon lies on the northern end of the Albis hills that include the Uetliberg mountain and form the western bound of the city of Z端rich. The Uetliberg itself lies some 3 kilometres to the south-east, but its north-western flanks lie within the municipal boundary. The municipality is some 8 kilometres west of, and 150 metres higher than, Z端rich city centre, and straddles the main road west from Z端rich to Birmensdorf. The village of Uitikon lies to the north of the road, whilst Waldegg and Ringlikon lie to the south.\n\nSource\n\nSource: Wikipedia.org\n\nCopyright: Creative Commons 3.0\n\nMore information\n\nStatistics"
