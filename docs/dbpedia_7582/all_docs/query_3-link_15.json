        "text": "The conference and workshops were held in Zurich, Switzerland, from 8-12 September 2013. The workshops took place on Sunday and Monday, September 8-9, on the ETH Zurich Downtown Campus (street address: Universitätstrasse 6, 8006 Zurich). The main conference took place from Tuesday to Thursday, September 10-12, on the ETH Science City Campus (street address: Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 14, 8049 Zurich). Below you will find more information about the venues.\n\nAbout Zurich\n\nWith a population of some 370,000 inhabitants, Zurich is the largest city in Switzerland. It is surprisingly compact, though, with a wealth of old churches, fountains, and cobbled streets with buildings, some of them more than 700 years old, housing charming galleries and small shops. The city of Zurich was established as a Roman customs post (called \"Turicum\") in 15 B.C. It is situated some 400 metres (1,340 ft) above sea level at the northern end of the 27 km (17 miles) long Lake of Zurich. Its well-preserved Old Town is to be found on both banks of the River Limmat, which flows out of the lake in a northerly direction. In Mercer’s annual “Quality of Living” survey, Zurich regularly claims one of the top spots, as it does on Monocle’s “Most Liveable Cities Index”.\n\nView Ubicomp 2013 in a larger map.\n\nHotels\n\nThere is no dedicated conference hotel. Discounted rates for several close-by hotels were available until August 5 and cannot be booked anymore. You can book your hotel room with Zurich Tourism, the official city tourism agency, using your favorite hotel reservation engine (e.g., Tripadvisor, Expedia, HRS, booking.com), or contacting hotels directly. We can recommend any of the hotels below, though they do not offer (anymore) any special conference rate (updated August 16):\n\nHotel Krone Unterstrass* $$$\n\nHotel Novotel Zürich Airport Messe* $$-$$$\n\n25hours Hotel Zürich West* $$-$$$\n\nHotel Coronado** $$ (single rooms only)\n\nHotel Ibis Zürich Messe-Airport* $$\n\nHotel Limmathof** $$ (rooms available only for September 8 - 10)\n\nHotel St. Georges* $\n\nYouth Hostel* $-$$\n\n*These hotels have rooms accessible for people on wheelchairs. Also, access to the lobby and hotel restaurant is not hampered by the presence of stairs.\n\n**These hotels are not equipped to assist guests on wheelchairs. Also, access to the lobby and hotel restaurant is hampered by the presence of stairs.\n\nYou are of course free to use your favorite hotel reservation engine (e.g., Tripadvisor, Expedia, HRS, booking.com), or contact the hotels directly to compare rates. We can additionally recommend any of the hotels below, though they do not offer any special conference rate (updated August 16):\n\nKafi Schnaps* $\n\nZum Guten Glueck* $\n\nHotel Marta** $$-$$$ (rooms available only on September 8 and 12)\n\nTown House** $$$\n\n*These hotels have one room accessible for people on wheelchairs.\n\n**These hotels are not equipped to assist guests on wheelchairs.\n\nMake sure to check out the exact location of the Conference Venue (and how to get there) and the Workshop Venue (and its directions) to find the most suitable hotel location for you. Given the size of the city (compact) and the state of its public transport system (excellent) you should be able to reach either location quickly from most city center hotels.\n\nRestaurants and Bars\n\nZurich offers a large number and variety of restaurant and bars. The map below shows places recommended by the Local Organizing Committee.\n\nView Zurich-UbiComp2013 Restaurants and Bars in a larger map\n\nBack to the top.\n\nGetting to Zurich\n\nZurich is extremely easy to reach by train and air, as well as by car.\n\nBy Plane\n\nZurich airport is a major European hub. It is served by over 80 different airlines that offer over 170 direct flights world-wide. The main carriers are Swiss International Airlines and German Lufthansa (through its hubs in Munich and Frankfurt), which through their “Star Alliance” network offer excellent world-wide connections.\n\nBy Train\n\nBy rail, Zurich is just 4 hours away from major European hubs, such as Frankfurt, Paris, or Milan. Additionally, direct trains link it to Amsterdam, Vienna, Berlin, and Hamburg, making it possible to reach Zurich from most major European cities with only a single change of trains.\n\nBy Car\n\nMajor European highways connect Zurich in 3.5 hours to Frankfurt or Munich, and in 3 hours to Milan. Cities in southern Germany (e.g, Karlsruhe or Stuttgart) are less than 2.5 hours away, eastern France (e.g., Grenoble) only 3 hours, and northern Italy (Genova, Torino, Bologna) only 5 hours.\n\nBack to the top.\n\nAbout ETH Zurich\n\nThe Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, or - to use its German acronym - the ETH Zurich, was founded by the Swiss government in 1854 as a polytechnic and opened its doors in Zurich in 1855. Until 1969, when the Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (known by its French acronym as EPFL) was established, ETH Zurich was the only national university in Switzerland. In its core areas of engineering, natural sciences, architecture, and mathematics it is one of the leading academic research institutions worldwide.\n\nThe ETH itself comprises 16 departments. Over 500 professors and more than 10,000 staff members - with a 30% proportion of women – work in teaching, research and administration. Current statistics of the ETH show 17,780 registered students. Each year about 3,100 receive a Bachelor or Master degree and a further 650 complete a doctoral thesis. Current annual expenditure is 1.47 billion Swiss francs. ETH Zurich regularly appears at the top of international rankings as one of the best universities in the world. 21 Nobel Laureates have studied, taught or conducted research at ETH Zurich, underlining its excellent reputation.\n\nThe Computer Science department features more than 30 professors from over 10 countries, 200+ PhD students and research assistants, and over 50 postdocs and senior scientists. In research and education, the department covers a broad spectrum of thematic areas with focuses on Software Engineering, Networks and Distributed Systems, Algorithms and Theory, Information Security, Computer Graphics and Vision, and Computational Sciences. The strong links between the department and a wide range of industry and business foster a mutually beneficial climate of academic rigor and practical relevance. In particular, the department maintains a set of long-term research collaborations with such global high-tech players as IBM, Microsoft, Google, SAP and Disney.\n\nBack to the top.\n\nConference Venue\n\nThe main conference was held at the ETH Science City Campus, located on the \"Hönggerberg\" some two miles from the city center.
