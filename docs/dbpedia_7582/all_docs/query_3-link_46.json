        "text": "The aim of the foundation is to enable and secure barrier-free access to published information, culture and education for blind, visually and print impaired people. The foundation achieves this purpose in particular through: a. Representation of the interests of the blind, visually impaired and hard copy people in those areas that are closely related to the fulfillment of the purpose; b. Maintaining a positive perception of the foundation and its concerns in politics, business and the general public; c. Outsourcing the operative business to a non-profit corporation of the same name and possibly to other organizations that pursue the same purpose; d. Granting of a contractual free usufruct of the property at Grubenstrasse 12/14 in Zurich to the corporation of the same name for its operational activities. The foundation is active in Switzerland within the scope of its purpose. The foundation is of a non-profit nature and does not pursue any self-help or profit-making purposes."
