        "text": "Want to know where to live in Zurich? Or where to find the best Zurich neighborhoods? Your good old friend Homelike is here to help—we’ve covered it all in this handy guide.\n\nZurich isn’t all boring bankers and money launderers.\n\nInstead, it’s genuinely one of the world’s most livable cities, with allure and appeal for endless types of people.\n\nClean, efficient and attractive, the quality of life in Switzerland’s biggest city is famously good. But on top of that, Zurich has much more to offer—it’s a fantastic place to find a lucrative job, the scenery is beautiful, and there’s a surprisingly vibrant cultural scene, with good nightlife and endless great places to eat and drink.\n\nBecause of all that and more, Zurich is home to a hefty number of diverse foreigners and expats—more than 30% of the city’s residents are non-Swiss, and many more people come here to work remotely and live short-term.\n\nIn short, Zurich is a popular choice for a relocation. So if you decide to make the move yourself, you’ll be surrounded by lots of other friendly foreigners, along with a warm and welcoming local population.\n\nBut when you move, it’s important to choose the right neighborhood to find the best Zurich apartments. Zurich is broken down into several smaller districts, all with different atmospheres, prices and people. So you’ll get a different experience depending on which neighborhood you move to.\n\nIf you want to know where to live in Zurich, Homelike is here to help you out—we’ve brought you the 10 best neighborhoods to live in Zurich.\n\nWe’ve brought you the best places in Zurich for families, the best places in Zurich for expats, the most affordable places in Zurich, and the best places in Zurich for students. No matter which of those groups you fit into, there are some beautiful and brilliant Zurich neighborhoods for you.\n\nIn our prestigious top 10, we’ve included:\n\nNiederdorf\n\nLindenhof\n\nDistrict 1\n\nAussersihl\n\nZurich West\n\nEnge\n\nSeefeld\n\nRiesbach\n\nUniversity Quarter\n\nZurich Noord\n\nThere’s some crossover between those 10 districts, but we’ll unpack all that and more coming up. No matter who you are, why you’re moving, or what you’re looking for, we’ve covered the best Zurich neighborhoods—and you’ll absolutely find one you love.\n\nAnyway, enough of all the introductions, here are the 10 best neighborhoods to live in Zurich…\n\nBest for: Nice sights, short-term stays, and living in the center of the city\n\nLet’s kick this list off with Zurich’s most famous neighborhood, and the area you’ve probably all already heard of.\n\nBroadly speaking, Neiderdorf is the small eastern stretch of Zurich’s lovely old town, and it’s the most charming part of the city. If you like cobbled streets, medieval squares, labyrinthine lanes, and being right in the heart of a city, you’ll love living in Niederdorf.\n\nSome of Zurich’s most iconic sights are in and around the area, including Grossmünster and Predigerkirche (two big churches), Kunsthaus (an excellent art museum and gallery), and the eastern banks of the river Limmat.\n\nThe tiny area of Niederdorf has a large concentration of hotels, restaurants, bars and boutiques. The vast majority of tourists stay in and around this area, so if you want to feel like a tourist, or if you’re only staying in Zurich for a short while, it’s a great place to base yourself—but it’s not one of the best neighborhoods in Zurich for long stays.\n\nIt’s also mega expensive (even for Swiss standards!), so living in Niederdorf isn’t a good option if you’re on a budget.\n\nBest for: Panoramas, historical sites, and living like a long-term tourist\n\nWhile Niederdorf is the eastern part of Zurich’s old town, Lindenhof is the western (and slightly larger) part of the same area. All that separates the two is the southern section of the Limmat, the river that runs through the city.\n\nBecause of that, the two districts are pretty similar to one another, with old-town sights, charming alleys, tucked-away corners, and lots of places to eat and drink.\n\nThat said, Lindenhof is a little bigger, vaguely quieter, and not so full of tourists. Because of that, it’s one of the best places in Zurich for expats who are hanging around for a short few months.\n\nSome of the most famous sights here include Fraumünster church, Zurich Observatory, and the iconic Bahnhofstrasse, one of the most expensive shopping streets on the planet.\n\nAnd last of all, the neighborhood is home to a hugely popular city park (which also goes by the name of Lindenhof!). A lovely chillout space right in the center of the city, this hilltop area offers beautiful panoramas of Zurich and its surroundings.\n\nAgain, if you’re looking for affordable places in Zurich, don’t move to Lindenhof. Like neighboring Niederdorf, it can be very expensive. But if you can afford it, it’s a great place to live—and a great place to get a serviced apartment in Zurich.\n\nBest for: Making friends, seeing the sites, and being a long-term tourist\n\nLindenhof and Niederdorf are actually part of District 1, a larger neighborhood encompassing the entire central part of the city.\n\nMost of District 1 is made up of Lindenhof and Niederdorf, but its confines actually spread a little wider than those two small neighborhoods. Hopefully that makes sense!\n\nIf you want to live in the heart of Zurich without getting a place in the most expensive parts, consider moving to the areas of District 1 that lie outside of Lindenhof and Niederdorf. Broadly speaking, that’s west of Bahnhofstrasse (that big shopping street we mentioned earlier), and east and south of Niederdorf, in a busy area known as Hochschulen.\n\nYes, these areas are still busy and expensive, but they’re not quite as busy and expensive as Lindenhof and Niederdorf. That makes them a good pick for single people, long-term tourists, young couples, and anyone who wants a busy life without feeling like a city-break weekender.\n\nThroughout all of District 1, you get great places to hang out, with lots of eateries, bars, cafes, shopping and more. But if you’re looking for trendy, hip and happening, it’s best to head just outside the area, which brings us to…\n\nBest for: Drinking, partying, hip hangouts, and spending time with Zurich’s younger crowd\n\nOkay, we’re now moving away from the very center of the city. We’re heading west of District 1, to a surprisingly big (and still very central) neighborhood.\n\nZurich isn’t known for being edgy or alternative (and nor is any part of Switzerland). But if that’s the type of neighborhood you like, Aussersihl is pretty much the closest you’ll get.\n\nBrimming with alternative clubs, second-hand stores, diverse eateries, independent venues, arty cinemas, self-declared Instagram influencers and some great city-center green spaces, Aussersihl offers lots of fun places to hang out. Because of that, the area is very popular with students, hipsters, and Zurich’s younger population.\n\nAlso inside Aussersihl is the iconic Langstrasse, once a red light district, now a very cosmopolitan shopping area. The name of the place literally translates into ‘long street,’ and there’s plenty to eat, drink and enjoy along its length. It’s one of the most fun, famous and hip streets in the city.\n\nIf you want to live in Zurich without being surrounded by businesses, commuters and people in suits, you should definitely consider living in Aussersihl. It’s one of the best places in Zurich for students, and one of the best places in Zurich for expats who like to party and play.\n\nBest for: Bohemian vibes, living relatively affordably, and hanging with hipsters\n\nDirectly north of Aussersihl, on the other side Zurich’s main train station, is Zurich West. Its official name is ‘District 5’, while others know it as the Industriequartier.\n\nWhatever you want to call it, it’s another great pick for people who like living in and around hip hangouts.\n\nIf you want to party, have fun, and make friends with top-knotted avocado munchers, it’s one of the best neighborhoods to live in Zurich. In some ways, it’s even more bohemian than Aussersihl, because it’s lesser-known, it’s still pretty up and coming, and it’s not quite as cool or cosmopolitan. Because of that, it’s one of the most affordable places in Zurich’s city center.\n\nAnd because the area is home to (and close to) lots of universities and young people, it’s also one of the best places in Zurich for students.\n\nOnce the industrial heart of the city, Zurich West’s factories and warehouses have now been torn down and transformed to be made into (or make way for) bars, galleries, thrift stores, wacky venues, shipping containers and other hipster clichés.\n\nIf you’re young, moving solo, like making friends and enjoy eating absurd amounts of brunch food, you’ll probably love living in Zurich West. And as an extra added bonus, the neighborhood is located in a very central part of the city.\n\nAll in all, for the right person, Zurich West is a great place to get a flat in Zurich.\n\nBest for: Great green spaces, strolling and cycling along Lake Zurich, and finding good schools and jobs\n\nWith this neighborhood, we’re getting away from all the business and busy-ness, and into the greener parts of the city. If you’re looking for parks, trees, and a relaxing little life in Zurich, Enge is our first recommendation.\n\nSouth of Aussersihl and District 1 (and bordering them both), it’s one of central Zurich’s most beautiful neighborhoods by far.\n\nAs you probably know, Zurich sits on the northern shores of massive Lake Zurich, one of the nation’s most famous and accessible beauty spots. For that reason, Enge is hugely popular with swimmers, cyclists, hikers, sunbathers, and everyone in between. Enge somehow feels Mediterranean, even though there are no beaches, and you’re nowhere near the region.\n\nBecause it’s so scenic and serene, Enge is one of the best places in Zurich for families. For people with kids, it’s perfect—you get great green spaces, little pollution, and even good schools. One of the best is SIS Swiss International School, one of the most reputable in the city.\n\nEnge isn’t the cheapest place to raise kids in Zurich, but if you have the money to live here, it’s genuinely one of the best quality-of-life neighborhoods on the planet.\n\nIt’s also a good place to get a job—lots of big businesses, employers and recruitment companies are based in and around the area. Some of the biggest include Qatar Reinsurance Company, Google and Regus, but there are plenty more.\n\nBest for: Pricey living, beautiful sights, and getting an apartment right on the shores of Lake Zurich\n\nAcross from Enge, on the northeastern shores of Lake Zurich, is the sought-after neighborhood of Seefeld.\n\nA tiny, narrow strip of a district, it’s an expensive place to live (even more so than Enge). But if you can afford it, the quality of life is absolutely incredible. Again, it’s one of the best places in Zurich for families.\n\nJust like Enge, you get to live on the shores of Lake Zurich, and enjoy swimming, boating, paddleboarding, sunbathing, cycling, strolling, and living in an outrageously beautiful part of the city.\n\nOne of the top hangout spots in Seefeld is the Chinagarten, a zen and zany haven with Chinese pavilions, bridges and architecture. Right next door is Zürichhorn, another popular green space with a play park, outdoor cinema, and loads of lovely places to chill out.\n\nOverall, Seefeld is a little more residential, quiet and laid-back than Enge. Because of that, it’s not the best place in Zurich to hunt for a job, but it’s a great neighborhood to raise kids if you can afford the lofty prices. One of the biggest perks for families here is the handy proximity to Hull’s School, which many reckon is the best international school in the city.\n\nBest for: University students, relatively affordable living, and raising a family\n\nMost commonly known as District 6, the University Quarter is just north of Zurich’s central area.\n\nLarge, diverse and attractive, it’s one of the city’s most popular residential districts.\n\nIn many ways, the University Quarter offers lots of appealing contrasts—it’s close to the city center, but not so close that it’s perpetually busy. It’s relatively affordable (well, for Swiss standards) without lingering too far from the city’s central sprawl. It’s pretty fun and interesting without being a pure party place.\n\nFor sheer diversity, and its varied appeal to several types of people, it’s absolutely one of the best neighborhoods in Zurich for expats. Whoever you are, and no matter why you’re moving to the city, you’ll probably enjoy a good life here. It’s especially good if you’re moving to Zurich with kids.\n\nIf you’re a student, listen up: because the neighborhood and its surroundings are home to lots of university campuses (and this won’t be a surprise given the district’s name!), it’s one of the best places in Zurich for students.\n\nBest for: Getting a job, finding an affordable home, and living the family life\n\nOf all the Zurich districts we’ve featured, this is the most residential. Just north of the University Quarter, Zurich Nord (or District 6) isn’t very central, but it’s a great place to live if your priorities are working, raising a family, and living a quieter life.\n\nIt’s not the most fun district in the city, but it’s absolutely one of the best places in Zurich for families. And because it’s on the outskirts of the city, it’s also one of the most affordable places in Zurich.\n\nThe district has some nice green spaces, lots of accessible places to eat, drink and shop, and plenty of family-friendly attractions and events. And because it’s close to Zurich’s airport, it’s a good choice if you regularly fly to other countries and cities for work.\n\nAll in all, Zurich Nord isn’t massively well-known—but it’s one of the best neighborhoods in Zurich for people who plan on living in the city for a while."
