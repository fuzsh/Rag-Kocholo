        "text": "According to the provisional results currently available, seasonally adjusted GDP excluding sporting events increased by 2.1 % in 2022, compared with 3.9 % in the previous year.\n\nOn the one hand, the economic trend was characterised by the post-coronavirus recovery; on the other hand, the tense energy situation in Europe and the difficult international environment had a negative effect on the data.\n\nIn 2014, the Swiss population adopted a popular initiative ‘Against Mass Immigration’, supporting a change in Switzerland’s immigration policy.\n\nOn 16 December 2016, the Parliament approved the amendment to the Foreign Nationals Act concerning implementation of Article 121a of the Federal Constitution. The aim of this amendment is, in particular, to make better use of the domestic labour market potential. In practical terms, employers are required to report job vacancies to the public employment centres first, to promote the employment of registered domestic jobseekers.\n\nThe requirement to report job vacancies, initially restricted to the occupational categories with a national unemployment rate of 8 % or higher, has been in force since 1 July 2018. On 1 January 2020, the threshold rate was reduced to 5 %.\n\nThe Federal Council activated the safeguard clause with effect from 1 January 2023. Under the safeguard clause, Croatian nationals wishing to take up gainful employment in Switzerland need a residence permit subject to a quota as from 1 January 2023. Since that date, both short-term L residence permits and B residence permits are subject to quotas for Croatian workers.\n\nIn Switzerland, 5.242 million people were in employment in the fourth quarter of 2022, 0.8 % more than in the same period of 2021. Part-time work is more common than in most Member States of the European Union (2022: 37 %). At 41.07 hours, weekly working hours are more than one hour above the EU average.\n\nIn terms of distribution by sector, 77.4 % of workers are employed in the services sector, 20.2 % in industry and crafts and around 2.3 % in the primary sector (data from 2022).\n\nLike many other countries, Switzerland has also experienced considerable population growth. In 1970, it had 6.1 million inhabitants, but by 2020 the resident population had risen to 8.7 million, of whom 25 % were foreigners (2018 figures).\n\nThe foreign population plays a significant role in the Swiss labour market. Around two thirds of that population originate from EU countries. The countries with the highest number of citizens living in Switzerland are Italy, Germany, Portugal, France and Kosovo, in addition to foreign nationals with permanent residence. In the first quarter of 2023, the number of cross-border workers totalled 386 331, the majority of whom came from neighbouring countries.\n\nThe high rate of nationals from EU and EFTA countries in the labour force is partly explained by the fact that migration primarily involves highly qualified professionals who are in high demand from Swiss companies.\n\nAccording to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), in the fourth quarter of 2022 there were 206 000 unemployed persons in Switzerland, which is 15 000 fewer than the previous year. These unemployed persons made up 4.1 % of the active population, which is a lower proportion than that observed in the fourth quarter of 2021 (4.4 %).\n\nSources: UFS/SECO/SEM\n\nLinks:\n\nTitle/name\n\nURL\n\nEURES Switzerland\n\nhttps://www.arbeit.swiss/secoalv/it/home/menue/stellensuchende/berufliche-mobilitaet-in-der-eu-efta---eures.html\n\nSECO – State Secretariat for Economic Affairs\n\nwww.seco.admin.ch\n\nAssociation of staff leasing companies in Switzerland\n\nwww.swissstaffing.ch\n\nRecognition of qualifications > Training > Recognition of foreign diplomas\n\nhttp://www.sbfi.admin.ch\n\nState Secretariat for Migration\n\nwww.sem.admin.ch\n\nFederal Social Insurance Office\n\nwww.bsv.admin.ch/\n\nDirectory of private employment agencies\n\nwww.avg-seco.admin.ch/WebVerzeichnis/ServletWebVerzeichnis\n\nGovernment agencies\n\nwww.admin.ch\n\nPublic job search site\n\nwww.lavoro.swiss\n\nSwiss employers’ association\n\nwww.arbeitgeber.ch\n\nSwiss Federal Statistical Office\n\nwww.bfs.admin.ch\n\nSwissworld\n\nwww.swissworld.org\n\nThe Swiss authorities online\n\nwww.ch.ch\n\nSwiss Workers’ Federation\n\nwww.travailsuisse.ch\n\nAccording to employment statistics, total employment (number of jobs) in Switzerland increased by 2.3 % in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter of the previous year. This marked a new employment record of 5.398 million jobs and a year-on-year increase of 2.3 %.\n\nEmployment rose in the secondary sector (industry and construction) and in the tertiary sector (services), by 0.9 % (+9 500 jobs) and 2.2 % (+87 900 jobs) respectively. In the tertiary sector, the part-time employment share was 47.2 %, while in the secondary sector only 16.6 % of employed persons worked at a level of under 90 %.\n\nOn an annual basis, there was an increase in employment in all economic branches. As in 2022, the highest growth in percentage terms was recorded in 'accommodation and food services' (+18 800, +7.8 %). In terms of the number of jobs, the branch with the largest increase in staff was ‘health and social affairs’ (+22 300, +2.8 %). Figures in the ‘construction’ branch were also high (+9 300, +2.6 %).\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, all of Switzerland's major regions recorded an increase in employment of between 1.9 % (Lake Geneva region and Espace Mittelland) and 3.7 % in Ticino. The Greater Ticino region also achieved significant growth in the tertiary sector, of 4.1 %.\n\nIn the secondary sector, the Lake Geneva region (+3.3 %) recorded the largest percentage increase in jobs, while the figures for Central Switzerland stagnated at the previous year’s level.\n\nSources: UFS/SECO\n\nAccording to employment statistics, total employment (number of jobs) in Switzerland increased by 2.3 % in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter of the previous year.

This mainly affected enterprises active in the ‘manufacture of computers and peripheral equipment and watches’ (62.9 %; +9.3 percentage points).\n\nSources: UFS/SECO\n\nEspace Mittelland includes the cantons of Bern, Fribourg, Neuchâtel, Jura and Solothurn and had approximately 1.89 million inhabitants as at 2017. Bern, Biel, Thun, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Fribourg and Neuchâtel are the largest towns in this region, which includes both German-speaking and French-speaking municipalities. The cantons of Neuchâtel and Jura border France.\n\nMore than a quarter of Switzerland’s French-speaking population live in Espace Mittelland, which, as highlighted by its bilingual name, plays a key role in connecting German-speaking and French-speaking Switzerland.\n\nEspace Mittelland is characterised by a highly diversified economic structure, which generates great employment stability.\n\nThe canton of Bern plays a major role within Espace Mittelland.\n\nThe services sector, which is strongly influenced by the presence of the Federal Administration, the headquarters of the Swiss Federal Railways (FFS), the Post Office, Swisscom, and the public health service and educational institutions, accounts for more than a quarter of the tertiary sector. Transport, communication and tourism also have an above-average presence here. The canton of Bern is followed by the three cantons of Fribourg, Neuchâtel and Solothurn, which represent an equally significant portion of Espace Mittelland. In these three cantons, the traditional service sectors are under-represented. The canton of Jura makes a minor contribution to the total services output of Espace Mittelland.\n\nAs concerns the secondary sector, the regions of Bern Jura and Bern Biel and the canton of Jura are the home of the watchmaking industry, and are known as ‘Watch Valley’. Brands such as Omega, Rolex, Longines and Swatch are world-famous. The main industries in the canton of Fribourg are the food industry, the capital goods industry and the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. In the canton of Solothurn, technology and the paper industry are major players, while other important sectors include medical technology, logistics and distribution, microelectronics, telecommunications, watches, turned parts for the watch and clock industry and services. In the canton of Neuchâtel, the pharmaceuticals industry continues to grow, especially thanks to subsidiaries of companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Bugnon Pharma, which generate high turnovers. The precision and watchmaking industry and their suppliers (precision engineering and turned parts) continue to play an important role in the region. Indeed, 28 % of employees are to be found in the watchmaking industry alone.\n\nThe predominantly French-speaking Lake Geneva region encompasses the metropolitan region of Lake Geneva, consisting of the cantons of Genève, Vaud and Valais. In 2015, it had 1.537 million inhabitants. Some 37 % of residents in the Lake Geneva region are foreign nationals. This makes this region the one with the highest proportion of foreign nationals in the whole of Switzerland. In recent years, the number of cross-border workers has risen significantly. In the first quarter of 2023, 153 610 cross-border workers were recorded. The largest towns in the region are Geneva, Lausanne and Sion.\n\nThe economy of the cantons of Genève, Vaud and Valais is predominantly service-based. Around 80 % of jobs are to be found in the tertiary sector. For the past several years, the canton of Vaud has been an area of exceptional economic dynamism. This is shown by the high growth in population, rate of employment and the creation of wealth. One of its key strengths is the structure of its economy, with its numerous multinational companies which are highly specialised in high-tech industries, commodities trading and business services.\n\nThe largest tertiary sectors include healthcare and social services, business services, the retail trade, the financial sector, education, the wholesale trade, tourism and public administration. Geneva is an important financial centre which is home to numerous private banks but also to high-tech companies and research institutes such as CERN. Furthermore, Geneva is the home of many international organisations and NGOs. A number of manufacturers of luxury watches are based in the Jura Vaudois – mainly in the Vallée de Joux (Audemars Piguet, Bréguet, Jaeger-LeCoultre). This is also the location of ‘Watch Valley’, which stretches from Geneva to Basel. In and around Lausanne there are major globally active food and tobacco companies as well as the headquarters of international sports federations. Of particular importance for the canton of Vaud is the EPFL, the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne). The Valais canton is known for its tourism, the electricity sector and wine-growing.\n\nSource: UFS\n\nOver the past few years, Central Switzerland has emerged as one of the fastest-growing regions in Switzerland. It consists of the cantons of Luzern, Nidwalden, Obwalden, Schwyz, Uri and Zug, which, together, had 790 458 inhabitants in 2015.\n\nIts central position in Switzerland is very important for this region, which is why well over half of all employees in the region work in the services sector. This geographical advantage makes the region a very suitable base for distribution and logistics centres. In addition, owing to the low tax rate, many wholesale and retail companies operating internationally have established their operations there. Companies working in the fields of sports articles and marketing are worthy of note, as are the schools in the region. In the cantons of Schwyz and Zug, a hub of specialist financial services companies has formed in recent years, offering employment to highly qualified employees. Tourism also plays an important role. The town of Lucerne is a brand with an international reputation. Tourism, and to some extent agriculture, have traditionally featured prominently too in parts of Schwyz, Uri, Obwalden and Nidwalden.\n\nIn this region, the weight of the industrial sector is markedly greater than the national average. A long-standing major sector of the economy is the capital goods industry, especially the production of machine tools, metal and metal products, rubber and plastics processing, vehicle manufacturing and primary and ancillary construction work. The same applies for the food industry and wood processing. Moreover, a number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Central Switzerland follow a successful niche production strategy. This is the case in particular in the cantons of Obwalden, Nidwalden and Zug, for example in the medical technology, micro-technology, optics and electronics sectors. In the past few years, highly innovative high-tech companies have been set up in the southern parts of Central Switzerland.\n\nThe region of North-Western Switzerland consists of the cantons of Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft and Aargau. The largest city in North-Western Switzerland is Basel. The region has a resident population of 1 128 723 (2015). In the first quarter of 2023, more than 74 077 cross-border workers worked in this region.\n\nThe mainstays of the economy in the Basel region are the life sciences sectors; the ‘Bio-Valley’ network is now known all over the world. The chemical-pharmaceutical industry is growing at a fast pace and is therefore increasingly becoming the leading growth driver of the Swiss national economy. Both Basel cantons host the registered offices of major multinational companies, around which a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) gravitate; these also make an important contribution to strengthening the region’s economy. Around 25 % of workers in the canton of Basel-Stadt are employed in the national chemical-pharmaceutical industry. The international logistics sector, in which the operations of around 200 shipping companies provide a boost to international trade from Switzerland’s ‘gateway to the world’, enabling around 15 % of all Swiss goods intended for foreign markets to be exported, is also of great importance. Furthermore, around 40 % of oil imports are handled here. Basel is the headquarters of the BIS, the Bank for International Settlements. All major financial service providers and insurance companies are also represented in the region.\n\nIn addition to the services sector, the strongly industrialised canton of Aargau is dominated by economic activities such as mechanical engineering, metalworking, electrical engineering, the chemicals and food industry, construction, and by the presence of hydraulic and nuclear power plants. Around 40 % of workers are employed in the industrial sector. The region’s economic hub is located in the Baden-Brugg area.\n\nZurich is the third-largest Swiss region and is regarded as the country’s economic powerhouse. With about 1 466 424 residents (as at 2015) of 176 different nationalities, its population is exceeded only by that of the Lake Geneva region and of Espace Mittelland. The region ranks first in terms of economic importance. The canton of Zurich is characterised by the great diversity of its industries. In addition to the strong financial sector, other industries have been gaining ground for years.\n\nThe economic area of Zurich boasts a long tradition in the development and production of medical technology. In addition, over the past few decades, it has become a leading location for the life science economy and skills. Most of the 57 000 companies registered are small and medium-sized enterprises, and account for almost two thirds of the active population. As a business centre, Zurich holds a leading position internationally. As a driving force of the Swiss economy, Zurich generates almost one fifth of the national income, wealth and jobs.\n\nZurich is world-famous not only as a financial centre but also as a city of ambitious projects and innovative ideas. The structure of the canton of Zurich’s economy is essentially service-based. Business services and the banking and insurance industries play a dominant role, exceeding the national average. Around one fifth of employment in the canton is to be found in these sectors; in the city of Zurich, the proportion rises to 30 %.\n\nWith regard to business services, employment is mainly concentrated in accountancy, tax consultancy, trusts, business consultancy, architects’ and engineering practices, as well as the media. Other sectors with above-average presence include healthcare, wholesale trade (in particular, data processing equipment and machines for industry), commerce and shipping, as well as education, especially due to the presence of top-ranking universities (ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich)."
