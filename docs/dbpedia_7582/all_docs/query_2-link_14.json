        "text": "The best places to live in Zurich\n\nWherever they look for accommodation in Zurich, expats will need to consider commute times to work and schools, their budget and the kind of property they're looking for.\n\nChildren in kindergarten and primary school can be expected to come home for lunch every day. Secondary school students often need to travel some distance, so access to public transport is important.\n\nHowever, many residents commute to work and school, so getting around in Zurich shouldn't be a problem. Hour-long commutes are rare, and expats probably won't need to spend too much time on the road.\n\nExpats who are used to large properties should remember that Switzerland is a small country – space is limited, and the market is quite tight.\n\nAccommodation in Zurich mostly consists of apartments and houses. City apartments won't differ much from other large cities around the world, while nearby towns and villages often have terraced apartments. There are usually four to eight apartments per building that have terraces rather than balconies or gardens. These offer outdoor space without the work associated with maintaining a garden. Houses usually have small gardens, while swimming pools are rare.\n\nUnfortunately, house prices in Zurich reflect its position as one of the world's best cities to live in. Being close to the lake easily doubles or triples rental prices, so it might be worth doing the proper research and budgeting before relocating.\n\nCity living in Zurich\n\nLiving in the city centre is probably easier for single expats or those with older children. Most people live in apartments, so space is limited and children have less room to play. Enge and Seefled are popular with bankers and lawyers, but keep in mind that most restaurants in this area are closed on Sundays. Older, more affluent Swiss residents tend to live in Fluntern and Zürichberg, which are located near the city's zoo.\n\nTrendier areas include Kreis 5, which has loft apartments, restaurants and bars. Oberstrass and Unterstrass, located around the university, as well as Oerlikon and Affoltern, which used to be industrial areas, are popular with young people.\n\nLake living in Zurich\n\nLake Zurich\n\nFew things beat living in an area with a view of Lake Zurich. The right side of the lake is called the Gold Coast because it catches the sun, and the left side is called the Silver Coast. Many expats live here because there are international schools on either side. Popular lakeside villages include Kilchberg, Thalwil, Rüschlikon and Horgen on the Silver Coast, and Zollikon, Küsnacht, Erlenbach and Meilen on the Gold Coast.\n\nMany facilities and stores around the lake cater to the English-speaking expat community. However, property prices are steep and most people can only afford the area if they receive a housing allowance from work or are willing to compromise on space.\n\nPfannenstiel and Albis regions\n\nThe villages up on the Gold Coast's ridge are in the Pfannenstiel region, and those on the Silver Coast are in the Albiskette region. They don't necessarily have a view of the lake, but their proximity to the international schools and the city make them popular. Prices are also high here, but it is possible to find affordable accommodation. After-school activities, stores and other places often don't offer English-speaking services, but are still in easy reach of the city.\n\nGreifensee\n\nThe other lake in the canton of Zurich is called Greifensee. It's a nature reserve and residents will see many cyclists, rollerbladers and joggers in the area. There are many villages around the lake with minimalistic infrastructure, with some larger towns such as Uster and Volketswil. Numerous expats live here, and send their children to a nearby local or international school. Prices are more moderate and residents usually get more for their money in this area.\n\nOther areas of Zurich\n\nUnless expats speak German, living in other areas in the canton of Zurich can be more challenging. Areas such as the Zürcher Oberland and the Weinland are beautiful, but there aren't many expats aside from those who want to integrate fully and don't live a typical expat life.\n\nThe Zürcher Unterland is the area around the airport, north of Zurich. More foreigners are coming to work and live in Zurich without the support of generous expat packages, and are moving to the villages around Bülach and Dielsdorf. Prices are far more affordable than around Lake Zurich, and the English-speaking population is ever growing. Residents are subjected to aeroplane noise, but it isn't intolerable.\n\nAt the end of the day, living in Zurich is great. Finding the right area will be determined by an individual's budget and if they are willing to give up on English-speaking conveniences. If expats can live beyond their comfort zone, they will most likely be rewarded with a lovely home and many local friends."
