        "text": "Zurich has a very well developed public transportation system within the city. This system also serves the airport, which is located 13 km from downtown Zurich. Using the tram or bus lines from anywhere in the city you can get to the main railway station, Zurich Hauptbahnhof. From this station you can easily take a train or tram to the airport. Zurich Airport is accessible by train, bus, tram, and taxi.\n\nTrain\n\nTaking the train to the airport from the city center is very practical. Trains depart from the main railway station and get to the airport in about 12 minutes. Trains also run every 12 minutes.\n\nTrains depart on time and are very reliable, unless there is a special circumstance that is causing a delay. The train provides transportation directly to the Airport Station, which is located on Level -2, next to the airport shopping center. Zurich’s main station experiences a lot of passenger traffic because trains operate not only within the city but to neighboring cities and countries like France and Germany as well.\n\nOther areas that regional trains travel to include the Glattbrugg Railway Station, Regensdorf Railway Station, Schlieren Railway Station, Waldburg, Wollishofen and Uetliberg. If you have time before your flight we recommend visiting the ShopVille mall, which is located beneath the main railway station.\n\nBus\n\nThe city is famous for its public transportation network and the bus network throughout the city is especially advanced and comprehensive. Taking a bus to the airport is another convenient transportation alternative. You can take a bus from the main railway station, which is easily accessible from every part of the city. Buses provide direct transportation to the Airport Centre. Buses are on time and reliable under normal circumstances; in case of snow there can be delays.\n\nTram\n\nThe city’s tram network is also very advanced. The tram network extends to most parts of the city but the lines surround the city center. If there is a part of the city that is not accessible by tram you can transfer to a bus or train to get to your destination. Tram Line 10 provides transportation to the Airport Centre from the main railway station.\n\nThe following tram lines operate throughout Zurich: Line 2, which operates between Farbhof and Tiefenbrunnen Railway Station, 3, which operates between Albisrieden and Kluspla, Line 4, which operates between Werdhölzli and Tiefenbrunnen Railway Station, Line 5, which operates between Enge Railway Station and the zoo, Line 7, which operates between Wollishofen and Stettbach Railway Station, Line 9, which operates between Triemli and Hirzenbach, Line 10 which operates between Seebach and the Main Railway Station, Line 11, which operates between Oerlikon Railway Station and Rehalp, Line 13, which operates between Albisgütli and Frankental, and Line 14, which operates between Tremli and Seebach.\n\nTaxi\n\nTaxis are another convenient transportation alternative to get to the airport from the city center. However, taxis are more expensive when compared to public transportation options. Public transportation in Zurich is very comfortable and reliable, so you can enjoy the same comfort-level using public transportation for a fraction of the price.\n\nRental Car\n\nIf you don’t want to take public transportation consider renting a car, which can be more affordable than taking a taxi. You can rent a car from various rental car companies located throughout the city or book a vehicle in advance online. Renting a car to get to the airport is both fast and convenient.\n\nAirport Information\n\nZurich Airport is located 13 km from the city center and is the primary international airport serving the city. It is also the largest airport in the entire country. In addition to offering convenient transportation alternatives to and from the airport, Zurich Airport also features services to meet passengers’ pre-flight and post-flight needs. Zurich Airport contains many shops, located both before security and after. The general area before security check features stores such as Migros, Herren Globus, and Inter Discount and places you can get a bite to eat or something to drink like Starbucks and McDonald’s.\n\nOnce passengers go through security they have access to a variety of services and venues. Passengers can go shopping for quality products at stores like Schweizer Heimatwerk, Porsche Design, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Greider, Omega, Swatch, Swarovski, Tommy Hilfiger, and Victorinox. The Duty Free shops offer passengers luxury products at reasonable prices. The airport also contains bookstores and gift shops where passengers can buy small items and knickknacks.\n\nThere are a variety of restaurants located in the passenger zone, including Burger King, Center Bar, Chalet Suisse, Montreux Jazz Café, and Walter.
