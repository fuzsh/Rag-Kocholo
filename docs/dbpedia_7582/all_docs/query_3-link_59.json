The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day.\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in June in Uitikon\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in June in UitikonJun11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303012 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMMayJulcoldcoldcoolcomfortablevery cold\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nHope, British Columbia, Canada (5,118 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Uitikon (view comparison).\n\n© OpenStreetMap contributors\n\nCompare Uitikon to another city:\n\nClouds\n\nThe month of June in Uitikon experiences rapidly decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 56% to 42%.\n\nThe clearest day of the month is June 30, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 58% of the time.\n\nFor reference, on November 23, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 62%, while on July 22, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 62%.\n\nCloud Cover Categories in June in Uitikon\n\n0% clear 20% mostly clear 40% partly cloudy 60% mostly cloudy 80% overcast 100%\n\nPrecipitation\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Uitikon, the chance of a wet day over the course of June is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 47% and ending it at 44%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 48% on June 11, and its lowest chance is 27% on February 29.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during June in Uitikon is essentially constant, remaining about 4.4 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 6.9 inches or falling below 2.1 inches.\n\nThe highest average 31-day accumulation is 4.5 inches on June 7.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of June in Uitikon, the length of the day is essentially constant. The shortest day of the month is June 1, with 15 hours, 42 minutes of daylight and the longest day is June 21, with 15 hours, 57 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Uitikon is 5:33 AM on June 1 and the earliest sunrise is 4 minutes earlier at 5:28 AM on June 15.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 9:15 PM on June 1 and the latest sunset is 12 minutes later at 9:27 PM on June 25.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Uitikon during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during June, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 5:29 AM and sets 15 hours, 57 minutes later, at 9:26 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:10 AM and sets 8 hours, 27 minutes later, at 4:38 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in June in Uitikon\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in June in UitikonJun11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303012 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMMayJul00101020202030304040505050606000010102020303030404050506060\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for June 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in June in Uitikon\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in June in UitikonJun11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303012 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMMayJulMay 85:23 AMMay 85:23 AMMay 233:54 PMMay 233:54 PMJun 62:38 PMJun 62:38 PMJun 223:09 AMJun 223:09 AMJul 612:58 AMJul 612:58 AMJul 2112:18 PMJul 2112:18 PM5:47 AM5:47 AM9:47 PM9:47 PM9:35 PM9:35 PM5:40 AM5:40 AM4:50 AM4:50 AM9:59 PM9:59 PM9:38 PM9:38 PM5:09 AM5:09 AM4:22 AM4:22 AM9:45 PM9:45 PM9:13 PM9:13 PM5:12 AM5:12 AM\n\nJun 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 32%2:50 AME3:13 PMW-8:59 AMS228,974 mi 2 22%3:07 AME4:34 PMWNW-9:46 AMS228,728 mi 3 13%3:26 AMENE5:56 PMWNW-10:35 AMS229,026 mi 4 6%3:47 AMENE7:20 PMWNW-11:27 AMS229,949 mi 5 2%4:14 AMNE8:43 PMNW-12:22 PMS231,530 mi 6 0%4:50 AMNE9:59 PMNW-1:20 PMS233,732 mi 7 1%5:36 AMNE11:03 PMNW-2:19 PMS236,432 mi 8 5%6:35 AMNE11:53 PMNW-3:17 PMS239,437 mi 9 11%7:44 AMNE--4:12 PMS242,504 mi 10 18%-12:29 AMNW8:56 AMNE5:02 PMS245,385 mi 11 26%-12:56 AMWNW10:09 AMENE5:48 PMS247,845 mi 12 36%-1:16 AMWNW11:19 AMENE6:30 PMS249,694 mi 13 45%-1:33 AMWNW12:26 PMENE7:10 PMS250,794 mi 14 50%-1:48 AMW1:31 PME7:49 PMS251,071 mi 15 65%-2:01 AMW2:37 PME8:27 PMS250,514 mi 16 74%-2:15 AMW3:43 PMESE9:07 PMS249,180 mi 17 82%-2:30 AMWSW4:51 PMESE9:50 PMS247,184 mi 18 89%-2:47 AMWSW6:03 PMESE10:36 PMS244,691 mi 19 95%-3:09 AMWSW7:16 PMSE11:27 PMS241,902 mi 20 97%-3:37 AMSW8:30 PMSE-- 21 99%-4:16 AMSW9:38 PMSE12:23 AMS239,039 mi 22 100%-5:09 AMSW10:35 PMSE1:23 AMS236,323 mi 23 99%-6:17 AMSW11:19 PMSE2:26 AMS233,944 mi 24 95%-7:35 AMSW11:53 PMESE3:27 AMS232,037 mi 25 89%-8:58 AMWSW-4:25 AMS230,666 mi 26 80%12:18 AMESE10:21 AMWSW-5:19 AMS229,830 mi 27 70%12:39 AMESE11:42 AMW-6:09 AMS229,484 mi 28 50%12:57 AME1:02 PMW-6:57 AMS229,562 mi 29 46%1:14 AME2:22 PMW-7:44 AMS230,005 mi 30 35%1:31 AMENE3:42 PMWNW-8:31 AMS230,776 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Uitikon is essentially constant during June, remaining within 1% of 1% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 10, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 1% of the time, while on October 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Uitikon is essentially constant during June, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 5.8 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on February 6, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.0 miles per hour, while on August 9, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 5.0 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Uitikon throughout June is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 50% on June 29.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Uitikon typically lasts for 6.4 months (195 days), from around April 19 to around October 31, rarely starting before April 1 or after May 6, and rarely ending before October 12 or after November 22.\n\nThe month of June in Uitikon is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in June in Uitikon\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Uitikon are increasing during June, increasing by 353Â°F, from 360Â°F to 713Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Uitikon is essentially constant during June, remaining within 0.2 kWh of 6.4 kWh throughout.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Uitikon are 47.369 deg latitude, 8.457 deg longitude, and 1,844 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Uitikon contains very significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 1,424 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 1,716 feet. Within 10 miles also contains very significant variations in elevation (1,837 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (11,073 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Uitikon is covered by trees (41%), artificial surfaces (29%), and cropland (29%), within 10 miles by cropland (40%) and artificial surfaces (29%), and within 50 miles by trees (36%) and cropland (28%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Uitikon, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Uitikon.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Uitikon according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Uitikon is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Uitikon and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nZurich Airport (LSZH, 41%, 8 mi, northeast, -430 ft elevation change)\n\nDÃ¼bendorf Air Base (LSMD, 40%, 9 mi, east, -374 ft elevation change)\n\nEmmen Air Base (LSME, 15%, 20 mi, south, -446 ft elevation change)\n\nEuroAirport BaselâMulhouseâFreiburg (LFSB, 4.5%, 46 mi, west, -961 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Uitikon and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
