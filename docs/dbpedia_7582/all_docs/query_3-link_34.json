        "text": "Consistently ranked one of the world's most liveable cities, Zurich is smart, scenic and stylish. The Swiss city may harbour a reputation for banking and finance, but there’s also a smorgasbord of arts, culture and history to explore. Not to mention a trendy post-industrial scene. Think music venues in converted warehouses, restaurants in abandoned shipbuilding yards and clothing boutiques in old railway viaducts.\n\nThings to Do\n\nZurich is anchored by a postcard-perfect Old Town, dotted with winding lanes, stone churches and towering steeples. Don’t miss the mighty twin towers of Grossmünster, Zurich’s iconic 12th-century Romanesque cathedral.\n\nBy far, one of Zurich’s biggest attractions is its shimmering lake. Pack a picnic and join locals as they soak up the sunshine. For a bird’s-eye view, why not hike up Üetliberg? You’ll work up a sweat, but the panoramic views are well worth it.\n\nThere’s plenty on offer for culture buffs, with a colourful line-up of museums and galleries to explore. Dive headfirst into history at the Swiss National Museum, part of the prestigious Musée Suisse Group. Admire masterpieces at Kunsthaus Zürich, or take a look at contemporary art at the Museum of Design.\n\nFor a dose of retail therapy head to Bahnhofstrasse, one of the most exclusive shopping strips on the planet. Catch a show at the elegant Zürich Opera House, or hit up the trendy Züri-West district for craft cocktails, boutique shopping and glitzy nightclubs.\n\nGetting Around\n\nZurich has a reputation for efficiency, and its public transport system doesn’t disappoint. Serviced by trams, buses and trains, Zurich is easy to navigate. Punctuality is legendary, which means you’ll never have to wait long. In addition to servicing its central neighbourhoods, Zurich’s main train station also offers connections to other Swiss and European cities."
