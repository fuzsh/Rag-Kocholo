        "text": "Host your next business or personal event at one of these 20 amazing Zurich event venues!\n\nZurich is the largest city in Switzerland with approximately 1.83 million people calling the metropolitan area home. It’s a picturesque land with a rich history dating back thousands of years. These days, Zurich is an internationally important city and a global center for the banking and finance industries. It’s also an excellent place to host an event!\n\nIn this article, we’ll look at the 20 best Zurich event venues the city has to offer. Whether you plan to hold a business powwow, a fundraiser gala, or a personal party, you’ll find a space on this list to suit your needs.\n\nIs your venue missing from this article? Submit your event venue, and we could feature it on the Bizzabo blog.\n\n20 Zürich Event Venues\n\n1. Hallenstadion Zurich\n\nSource: Hallenstadion Zurich\n\nLocation: Oerlikon\n\nCapacity: 15,000\n\nLet’s start with one of the largest Zurich event venues: Hallenstadion Zurich. The space has been hosting sports competitions, concerts by world-renowned artists (such as the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, and Elton John), and even exhibitions (like the circus) for the past 80 years. But the stadium welcomes small, intimate gatherings as well. It features a foyer and multiple meeting rooms for rent. Each space is outfitted with the latest technology (think projector screens and WiFi).\n\nNo matter which space you choose for your next business meeting, conference, or international rock show, you’ll have access to an experienced event and catering team. We should also mention that in 2004, Hallenstadion Zurich was refurbished and modernized. We can’t think of anything to not like about this event venue!\n\n2. Technorama\n\nSource: TripAdvisor\n\nLocation: Winterhur\n\nCapacity: 180\n\nThe Technorama is a science center that, “allows hands-on experiences of hundreds of natural phenomena and technology.” And if you don’t mind a quick drive to Winterhur, it’s also a fantastic venue for small and medium-sized events. Event planners get access to eight distinct spaces (including an auditorium/lecture hall complete with a projector and screen, microphones, and internet access as well as the center’s restaurant). Whether you plan to host a company seminar, international convention, or private party, the Technorama venue, and events team is ready and willing to help make it memorable for your guests.\n\n3. Schloss Greifensee\n\nSource: Hikr\n\nLocation: Greifensee\n\nCapacity: 100\n\nWant to give your guests an experience they won’t soon forget? Then host your next business meeting, concert, or wedding reception at Schloss Greifensee, a real-life castle with centuries of history baked into its stone walls. There are multiple rooms for rent as well as a bright cellar and a beautiful garden. Schloss Greifensee also partners with a wide variety of well-respected caterers so you won’t have to worry about your guests getting hungry. Much like Technorama (mentioned above), Schloss Greifensee is a bit outside of Zurich, but the fairytale-like setting is more than worth the quick drive to it.\n\n4. The Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute (GDI)\n\nSource: The Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute (GDI)\n\nLocation: Rüschlikon\n\nCapacity: 300\n\nThe Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute is a fascinating place. Branded as a “think tank in business, society, and consumption,” the Institute is on the cutting edge of scientific research in the social and economic fields. But did you know it also hosts stellar events? It’s true! Event planners can rent one of many different spaces including halls, foyers, a restaurant, a library, a media room, and a terrace. All together there are 21 spaces available. But no matter which you choose, you’ll have access to state-of-the-art technology as well as delicious food and drink menus.\n\n5. The Folium and Paper Hall\n\nSource: Folium\n\nLocation: Alt-Wiedikon\n\nCapacity: N/A\n\nThe Folium and Paper Hall are two of the most unique Zurich event spaces on this list, each with its own rich history. The venues are housed in an old paper factory that began operation in 1886. These days, though, it’s a spot where more memories than papers are being made. When you see the outside of the Folium and Paper Hall, you’ll notice that it has three levels. The first is where the restaurant is located. The second is occupied by the Folium. And the third is where the Paper Hall resides. But no matter which space you choose to rent, you’ll have access to top-of-the-line sound, lighting, and image equipment along with bar and catering services plus some fun entertainment options too!\n\n6. CLOUDS Bar and Bistro\n\nSource: Newly Swissed\n\nLocation: Industriequartier\n\nCapacity: 270\n\nCLOUDS is an upscale restaurant and event venue that is sure to delight your guests. The bistro sits 35 stories in the air and offers breathtaking views of the city and lake. The space itself is modern, elegant, and exclusive and the food served is delicious. From company meetings to private parties to wedding receptions, CLOUDS is an excellent space for your next gathering. But can we make one suggestion? Host your CLOUDS event at sunset and take full advantage of that view. Your guests will thank you, we promise!\n\n7. Storchen Zurich\n\nSource: Luxury Launches\n\nLocation: Altstadt\n\nCapacity: 200\n\nThe Storchen Zurich (located in the heart of the old city) is a first-class hotel and event space. It has a restaurant and cigar bar, six banquet rooms, and a waterside terrace available for rent. Each space is luxuriously appointed and equipped with the latest technology. But Storchen Zurich is more than just an elegant space – it’s also a one-stop event solution made possible by its banqueting team who will work with you to ensure your business meeting, fundraiser dinner, or private birthday bash goes off without a hitch. Event planners looking for the perfect balance between an upscale experience and a convenient planning process should look long and hard at Storchen Zurich.\n\n8. Halle 622\n\nSource: MCH Group\n\nLocation: Oerlikon\n\nCapacity: 2,000\n\nDoes your event strategy call for the perfect blend between space, technology, and convenience? Then move Halle 622 to the top of your list. This venue has room for up to 2,000 people. It also has state-of-the-art audio, light, and visual technology specs. And you can count on modern conveniences like cleaning, security, and medical crews.\n\nHost a catered corporate luncheon or a public comic book convention in the column-free hall. Or release your inner rockstar and throw a concert or dance party. It’s all been done before at Halle 622 and the team behind the venue would love to do it again for your next shindig.\n\n9. Westhive\n\nSource: Westhive\n\nLocation: Escher Wyss\n\nCapacity: 120\n\nWesthive is a popular co-working space with a tasty restaurant, plenty of private rooms, and great views of the city. As an event planner, you have options when booking this venue. Planning a small investors lunch? Reserve one of the nine private meeting rooms equipped with screens, video projectors, whiteboards, and internet. Looking to host something a little bigger? If you rent the entire space for your next conference or product launch you’ll get access to in-house catering plus all the state-of-the-art tech and meeting rooms previously mentioned.\n\n10. Lake Zurich Shipping Company\n\nSource: YouTube\n\nLocation: District 2\n\nCapacity: N/A\n\nMaybe your ideal event setting isn’t inside a building, but outside, in nature. If you’ve ever dreamed of hosting a client appreciation meeting, team building event, or private soiree on the beautiful waters of Lake Zurich, we recommend the Lake Zurich Shipping Company. This water-bound business will sail your guests across the lake while serving them tasty food and drinks as you all enjoy the natural beauty of your surroundings. Give your guests an unforgettable experience and book your next gathering on a boat.\n\n11. Volkshaus\n\nSource: Volkshaus\n\nLocation: Langstrasse\n\nCapacity: 1,600\n\nWhen it comes to amazing event venues in Switzerland, Volkshaus has to be mentioned. The 1,100 seat theater hall first opened in 1910 and many popular musicians have graced its stage. Looking for something a bit more intimate? Volkshaus also has other (smaller) halls available for rent as well as meeting rooms equipped with tables and chairs. From musical performances to company brainstorming sessions, Volkshaus is ready to host.\n\n12. Samsung Hall\n\nSource: YouTube\n\nLocation: Dubendorf\n\nCapacity: 5,000\n\nSamsung Hall is a fairly new player in the Zurich event venues game but it’s definitely hit the ground running. Since opening in 2017, the space has already hosted concerts by the likes of John Legend, Macklemore, the Gorillaz, and Sting (just to name a few). How have they been able to achieve so much success so quickly? By being completely awesome!\n\nThe building’s modern, modular design is completely flexible and has the space available to accommodate many different event types. Samsung Hall also has an in-house catering team, state-of-the-art A/V equipment, and two open-air terraces. If you’re planning the next big, Zurich-area concert, consider booking Samsung Hall. If you want to host a fundraiser dinner for a few hundred of your closest friends, consider booking Samsung Hall. And if you just need a quiet space to meet with your company’s board of directors, consider booking Samsung Hall!\n\n13. Kramer Gastronomie – Metropol\n\nSource: Metropol\n\nLocation: Hard\n\nCapacity: 600\n\nKramer Gastronomie has multiple restaurants and event locations under its wide umbrella and each is special in its own way. Our personal favorite spot, though, is the Metropol — a fine dining Japanese restaurant, champagne bar, and café with state-of-the-art technology and meeting rooms. This venue is ideal for dinner parties (obviously) but is equally suited to corporate seminars, business banquets, and personal soirees. For event planners looking for a stylish setting with modern conveniences, we recommend the Kramer Gastronomie Metropol.\n\n14. House by the Lake\n\nSource: House by the Lake\n\nLocation: District 2\n\nCapacity: 400\n\nHouse by the Lake is a beautiful event venue just outside of the city. The bright brick building is, unsurprisingly, right on the banks of Lake Zurich and dates back to the 1900s. Believe it or not, it was originally built to house a sunscreen factory but has been renovated since then. Still, the stylish building has retained an industrial charm that many guests seem to appreciate. Besides the main structure, event planners also have a lush garden, a private pier, and plenty of outdoor seating at their disposal. Any event — corporate powwow, private get-together, romantic wedding ceremony — will feel at home at House by the Lake, guaranteed.\n\n15. X-TRA\n\nSource: X-TRA\n\nLocation: Gewerbeschule\n\nCapacity: 2,000\n\nX-TRA is equal parts quality hotel and rockin’ events space. The building was originally designed by Swiss architect Karl Egende in 1931 but has been completely remodeled since then. Today, the space is totally modern and features a slick black, white, and wood color scheme that’s very pleasing to the eye. The venue portion of the building is divided into different rooms for rent, each unique and completely flexible. Event planners have access to top-of-the-line A/V equipment, in-house catering, and event planning help from the professional X-TRA events team. All in all, X-TRA is a great venue and worthy of any business or personal get-together.\n\n16. Zunfthaus zur Saffran\n\nSource: Zunfthaus zur Saffran\n\nLocation: Altstadt\n\nCapacity: 250\n\nThe motto at Zunfthaus zur Saffran is, “Time has created space for stylish hospitality.” We think it’s safe to say the goal of “stylish hospitality” has been reached! Zunfthaus zur Saffran is a gorgeous venue which features four distinct spaces: the Great Guild Hall, the Small Guild Hall, the Hall to the White Rose, and the Ratstube. Each space is luxuriously appointed and exquisitely decorated. But the style doesn’t stop there. Zunfthaus zur Saffran also has excellent catering options. For any event, corporate or private, we wholeheartedly recommend this venue.\n\n17. Stage One Event and Convention Hall\n\nSource: Stage One\n\nLocation: Oerlikon\n\nCapacity: 840\n\nThe Stage One Event and Convention Hall combines the, “open-air atmosphere of a historic industrial hall with state-of-the-art event technology.” The main event space is large and can be used for a variety of purposes. There are also 10 separate workshop and seminar rooms at event planners’ disposal. And, if needed, banquet furniture such as tables and chairs can be made available as well. Oh, and did we mention that Stage One also provides catering and entertainment options? Looks like this venue has thought of just about everything. That’s why it’s a consistent favorite among top Zurich event spaces.\n\n18. Zurich Marriott Hotel\n\nSource: Marriott\n\nLocation: Unterstrass\n\nCapacity: 650\n\nChoosing the right event venue is never easy. So why not make things easy on yourself and go with a tried and true classic? Marriott hotels make for excellent event venues in just about every country around the world. The Zurich location has 12 individual event spaces, over 15,000 square feet of total event space, and 16 breakout rooms. It also features in-house catering options, top-of-the-line technology specifications, and access to group rates on hotel rooms for event planners. Whether you plan to host a business conference, car show, or just want to get married to your darling sweetheart, Marriott has the space and requirements to make it happen in style.\n\n19. Giardino Verde\n\nSource: Fama Cubana\n\nLocation: Uitikon\n\nCapacity: 1,300\n\nThe countless plants at Giardino Verde make for a perfectly relaxing backdrop to any business meeting, conference, or personal get-together. Book one of the four gardens (three covered, one open-air) located here and get access to unquestioned beauty, banquet furniture, and catering and drinks options. Or rent the entire venue and host a large public event or throw a party for your entire company. Quality tech equipment is also available.\n\n20. FIFA World Football Museum\n\nSource: FIFA World Football Museum\n\nLocation: Enge\n\nCapacity: 120\n\nThe FIFA World Football Museum is the “Home of Football History.” If you and your guests are big football (aka soccer, for you Americans) fanatics, you’ll especially love this venue. You can choose to host your event in one of five spaces: the Banquet Hall, Maracana (pictured above), Columbes, Wembley, and the Events Hall. Each will give you access to fun and interesting museum exhibits, a modern infrastructure, plenty of catering options, and state-of-the-art technology. And don’t worry if you’re feeling overwhelmed with the whole “event planning” process. The FIFA World Football Museum has a dedicated team ready to help you make your next business meeting, corporate workshop, or nonprofit fundraiser a big success.\n\nMake Your Zurich Area Event Extraordinary\n\nIf you want your next event to be memorable, you have to choose the right venue. Fortunately, Zurich has plenty of quality options! Whether you’re looking to host a business or personal event, one of the spaces mentioned above will fit the bill.\n\nJust remember your venue is important, but it’s really just one piece in the event planning puzzle. To make sure you get every little detail locked down tight, we recommend event management software. Never plan an event without it!\n\nDid you enjoy this article? Then you might also like:"
