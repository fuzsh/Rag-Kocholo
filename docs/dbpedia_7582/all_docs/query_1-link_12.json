        "text": "Portrait in English\n\nNestling against the western slope of the Uetliberg, Uitikon offers a setting in close touch with nature and an environment in which it is a pleasure to live. Uitikon belongs to the district of Dietikon and hence to the Limmat Valley region. The advantages of our tax-sheltered commune (2020: 80%) are currently enjoyed by 4'661 residents (correct as end of 2019, percentage of non-Swiss residents 16%). In the authentic village centre we run the “Üdiker-Huus”, our attractive and much-used Community Centre.\n\nSport and recreation\n\nA variety of clubs, spacious sports grounds and an indoor swimming pool with a popular sauna on the Allmend all contribute to the exceptional quality of life available in Uitikon. Those with an interest in astronomy will want to visit the observatory with sun laboratory on the Allmend. A network of hiking paths through woods and different natural settings also provide rest and recreation.\n\nTraffic connections\n\nZurich City, Selnau, Sihlporte and Zurich Main Station are just 12 minutes away with the half-hourly regional SZU train service. The local bus brings you in just a short time to the SZU station in Uitikon or to the train station in Schlieren and frequent ‘Postauto’ coaches link Zurich-Wiedikon with Uitikon-Post and Uitikon-Village.\n\nSchools\n\nUitikon has schools for all ages ranging from preschool to secondary school. The schools’ function with block times and there is a choice of lunchtime meal services. The choice available for your children even includes international schools such as “The Zurich International” in Wädenswil or “The Inter-Community School” in Zumikon."
