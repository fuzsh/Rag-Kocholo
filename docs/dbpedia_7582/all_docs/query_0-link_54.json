        "text": "Our two-day detour to Zurich, Switzerland was more about meeting up with longtime friends than it was about visiting the city itself. However, that didn’t keep us from discovering the best sights of the Old Town on a Zurich Walking Tour!\n\nWe devised a Zurich Self-Guided Walking Tour that would take us through the pristine city. Beginning down the famous shopping streets, then to a few churches and viewpoints. All while allowing enough time for lunch, chocolates and beers!\n\nAbout this Free Zurich Walking Tour\n\nWe love creating our own free walking tours in cities where we can set our pace, make detours and stop at any places that catch our eye. Our outlined Zurich Old Town Walking Tour is ideal for visitors – like us – who enjoy discovering destinations on their own two feet.\n\nZurich Walking Tour Map and Directions\n\nWhat makes this one of the best walking tours in Zurich that you can complete it on your own. We include a pin drop for each stop – making it easy to route your way from one sight to the next.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that you will need an internet connection. We use a Pocket WiFi device to stay connected while traveling abroad. In fact, we would literally be lost without it!\n\nAdditionally, we have included a Zurich Old Town Walking Map at the end of this article. It offers an overview of our sightseeing Zurich walk that is simple to follow.\n\nMore Walking Tours of Zurich\n\nOur Zurich Free Walking Tour is a self-guided adventure to the top sights in the city. Fellow travelers who would rather join a guided walking tour have many options. We highlight a few of the highly rated Guided Walking Tours of Zurich after we share the details of our Zurich Walking Tour Free Route.\n\nZurich Self-Guided Walking Tour\n\nOur Zurich sightseeing focused on the sights in the center of town. While there are many tourist attractions – our list includes 12 top things to see in Zurich. Our Zurich walking tour route is about 3 miles long (mostly flat), which should take about an hour to complete without any stops.\n\nEven if you only have one day in Zurich, our walking tour is a great way to get an introduction to the city!\n\nSave, Pin or Bookmark our Zurich Walking Tour for your trip to Switzerland!\n\n#1 Bahnhofstrasse\n\n{MAP} We started our Zurich Self-Guided Walking Tour at the Paradeplatz tram station in the city center. Heading north on Bahnhofstrasse, we gawked at the expensive watches glittering in the window displays.\n\nThe street is flooded with fashionable retailers, posh boutiques, fine architecture and a bevy of Swiss Banks. The famous shopping street is a Zurich must see!\n\n#2 Detour onto Augustinergasse and Rennweg Street\n\n{MAP} On our Zurich city tour, we were sidetracked more than once by the colorful streets in the center. We turned right down the bright and colorful Augustinergasse.\n\n{MAP} At Widdergasse we turned left…and left again onto Rennweg. This was the main thoroughfare during the Middle Ages and features quaint craft houses. We followed Rennweg north to where it meets back up with Bahnhofstrasse.\n\n#3 Zurich Bahnhofplatz\n\n{MAP} The Bahnhofplatz is the next stop on our Zurich Self Guided Walking Tour. Ranking as the biggest train station in Switzerland and one of the busiest in the world, it also marks the north end of Zurich Old Town (or Zurich Altstadt).\n\nTop Tip: If you are traveling to the city on a day trip and arriving by train, you can begin your Walking Tour Zurich Old Town route here. Continue from the station to the next sight – and then visit the first sights on our list at the end of the tour, which circles back to the heart of the Old Town.\n\n#4 Central Polybahn\n\n{MAP} From the main train station, continue our Zurich free tour by crossing the Limmat River on the Bahnhofbrucke Brigde. Head to the funicular, Central Polybahn, for a ride up the hill to a lookout point. Unfortunately, it was one of the few Zurich sights that was closed during our visit, so you will have to let us know how the view is!\n\n#5 Niederdorfstrasse\n\n{MAP} Continuing our Zurich Old Town walking tour, we turned south on Niederdorfstrasse, a pedestrian street filled with cafes, restaurants and bars. It was perfect timing because we were getting hungry for lunch!\n\nKris decided on a kebab, and I found a café near Stussihofstatt serving traditional dishes, deli-style, which are loaded up into containers and paid for by weight. I opted for an inexpensive Zurich lunch special: bratwurst with a roll and mustard for $6.50. However, I couldn’t resist adding the creamy potatoes au gratin to my meal for about $2 more!\n\n#6 Zurich Rathaus & River Views\n\n{MAP}, Walking back to the Limmat River, by the Zurich Town Hall (Rathaus), we couldn’t stop taking pictures of the idyllic waterfront buildings.\n\nThere, we were approached by a woman who told us that the flag flying above the front door of Town Hall indicated that the local government was in session. She also said that we were free to go in to watch the proceedings.\n\nWe passed through security and then walked upstairs to a balcony overlooking a beautiful room. it was filled with a (surprisingly) casual bunch of politicians. Taking a peek inside the Rathaus is one of the best free things to do in Zurich (besides our walking tour Zurich, of course!).\n\n#7 Grossmunster\n\n{MAP} Next up on our Zurich itinerary: the Grossmunster Cathedral. Built in 1220, the Cathedral is one of the top Zurich tourist attractions. The two towers were added in 1787 and the 187 steps can be climbed for great views (for a small fee).\n\nThe interior of the Grossmunster is rather plain, but has bright stained glass windows. A crypt beneath the altar houses an original sculpture from one of the towers.\n\n#8 Lake Zurich and Opernhaus Zurich\n\n{MAP} Continuing on our Zurich one day tour, we walked south to Lake Zurich and the Opera House (Opernhaus Zurich). On the lakeside, a man played the traditional Swiss alphorn for tips.\n\nBehind him, on the lake, dozens of swans were gliding on the water and in the background the majestic snowcapped Swiss Alps completed the idyllic scene.\n\n#9 Limmat Riverwalk and St. Peter Church\n\n{MAP} While we could have continued walking along the lake, there were more Zurich Old Town attractions we wanted to see! Crossing back to the west side of the river at Quaibrucke Bridge, we strolled along the water.\n\n{MAP} We cut into the old city center near St. Peter Church, which has the largest church clock in all of Europe.\n\n#10 Lindenhof\n\n{MAP} We wound through the tangle of streets up to Lindenhof. A raised park with views over the river and one of the best places to visit in Zurich. Two men played bocce ball, a younger group contemplated the next move on the giant chess board. Several others sat along the wall enjoying the pleasant view of Zurich and the soaring Swiss Alps in the distance.\n\n#11 Zurich Chocolate Shop: Confiserie Teuscher\n\n{MAP} There is a long history of chocolate production in the city. Touring Zurich wouldn’t be complete without a taste of chocolate!\n\nDuring your Zurich self-guided walking tour you will undoubtedly pass by numerous chocolate shops. However, we recommend seeking out Confiserie Teuscher.\n\nColorfully decorated for Easter, it was difficult to tell if it was a chocolate shop or a florist, but the sweet scent of cocoa floated out the door. Unable to resist the temptation any longer, we splurged for three truffles: caramel, Grand Marnier and the store’s signature Champagne.\n\nTop Tip: Join the Chocolate and Sweets Walking Tour for a more indulgent taste of Zurich!\n\n#12 Zeughauskeller\n\n{MAP} We ended our ‘Zurich in a day’ tour at Zeughauskeller for a pint of local beer. Built in 1487, the building was used as an armory. Then in 1926 it was transformed into a place for social gathering and beer drinking. The old-time, Zurich beer hall atmosphere survives today.\n\nThoughts on our Zurich Self-Guided Walking Tour\n\nWe felt we got a great introduction to the beautiful city with our Zurich self-guided walking tour. In the bustling metropolis of historic buildings, clock towers and row houses, the people and trams move at a fast pace.\n\nAt the same time, the distant Alps, wide river, open squares and iconic fountains slow things down a bit. The scenic diversity creates a pleasant atmosphere that is ideal for a stroll on a Zurich walking tour.\n\nZurich Self-Guided Walking Tour Map\n\nThis Zurich city map highlights the top places to visit in Zurich in 1 day.

While we think the best place to stay in Zurich is in the heart of the city, accommodations are pricey.\n\nZurich Short Term Apartments\n\nDuring our visit to Zurich, we stayed in a super Airbnb Apartment.

As well as US gateways like New York, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, and San Francisco!\n\nThe Zurich Airport (ZRH) is the largest international airport in Switzerland and is located 6 miles north of the Zurich Old Town.\n\nWhen we start our search for affordable plane tickets, we look for the best deals on airline tickets on Skyscanner.\n\nZurich by Train, Bus or Car\n\nTo get between destinations when flights are not feasible, we usually rely on public transportation. These include trains or buses – of which there are several to Zurich.\n\nUse Rail Europe to find train tickets. Our preferred bus company is FlixBus. It is economical, clean and comfortable (and sometimes has on-board Wi-Fi, seat-back entertainment, refreshments and a toilet).\n\nWe aren’t keen on driving abroad, but renting a car can often save time and money (especially when traveling with more than two people).
