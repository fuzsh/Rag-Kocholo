        "text": "Clean and comfortable rooms with soft beds. Great location - very close to Zurich and with a beautiful area to explore on foot behind the hotel. The staff is well-trained and friendly - making check-in - dining, and checking out a smooth experience. All in all - a fine run place with the typical friendly Swiss flair. The restaurant serves perfect food and the breakfast is good - although it could have more options for vegetarians and vegans.\n\nWould recommend.\n\nWe'd had an extremely stressful trip to Zurich with flights being cancelled and having to reroute, so we got to the hotel rather late. However, within minutes of being greeted by our very friendly and hospitable host, all the stresses of the day disappeared. Our room was spacious and very comfortable. Our only regret is that we were not staying longer but hopefully, in the near future, we will return to Landgasthof Leuen and spend longer there. We would definitely highly recommend this gasthof to anyone considering a trip to Zurich.\n\nDuring my Easter stay, I enjoyed the amazing food and friendly staff. the breakfast had a wide selection of delicious bread and pastry. the hotel's location was great being near public transportation and some shops. they have a beautiful garden where I spent one afternoon relaxing and enjoying the surroundings.\n\nI did not appreciate the noise from other guests during the night. the walls seemed to be thin, making it difficult to sleep with the disturbance.\n\nThis place is located in a beautiful summer destination, offering breathtaking views of the valley. The hotel is conveniently situated in the city center, making it easily accessible for tourists. The room amenities, including the heating and air conditioning, ensure enhanced comfort throughout your stay. The staff provide excellent service, ensuring a pleasant experience from check-in to check-out.\n\nI highly recommend this hotel to everyone.\n\nThis hotel is located in a nice suburb close to Zurich center with beautiful surroundings; however, it is not close to the city center. The rooms are clean and well presented, with comfortable beds and fresh linens. The breakfast is excellent with homemade bread, and the staff is courteous and friendly. The hotel has ample parking and offers a beautiful garden terrace to its guests.\n\nThe walls between the rooms are quite thin, which makes it quite noisy at times with people talking and watching television.\n\nEnjoyed a peaceful weekend getaway in a quaint country-style hotel. The rooms were comfortable and well-equipped with pleasant views of the surrounding greenery. The staff was friendly and accommodating, making us feel right at home. We appreciated the convenient bus stop nearby and the good connection to the city. the on-site restaurant was top-notch, offering delicious and well-prepared dishes.\n\nThe breakfast was rather basic, with no hot options available. if you're a light sleeper, it may be best to request a room away from the busy road outside as there was some noise when the window was open.\n\nWe had a lovely stay at Landgasthof Leuen. the traditional hotel, with its renovated interior, was tastefully done. the combination of old wooden beams and white plastering created a charming ambiance. the staff were friendly and efficient, and the breakfast, although lacking vegetarian and vegan options, was fresh and enjoyable. Our room, although small, was quiet and cozy. The area behind the hotel was worth exploring on foot, offering beautiful surroundings. Cons: Nothing - everything was great! ðŸ˜Š."
