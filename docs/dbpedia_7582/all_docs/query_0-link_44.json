        "text": "What kind of goods are transported in these collective transports?\n\nCollective transport and additional loads are suitable for single items, individual furniture, luggage and suitcases, as well as small items or paletts. We transport antiques that are professionally packed for transport by our specialists, and paletts can also be loaded on the tour. We basically transport everything that is quickly loaded and unloaded. If you need transportation from Zurich to Bern, from Bern to Geneva, from Olten to Solothurn, or from Zug to Lausanne, no matter where, we combine the goods and transport them for you. We can also transport art objects professionally. Our vehicles are designed for furniture transportation and we guarantee a trustworthy service.\n\nHow often are these collective transports carried out?\n\nIn June 2020 we will conduct the first such collective tour. In the future we will carry out group transports between Zurich, Lucerne, Bern, Lausanne and Geneva at least once a month. Depending on the request, we schedule the trips and carry them out as quickly as possible so that the customer does not have to wait too long for the delivery. Our goal is to offer these groupage shipments as often as possible. Pick-ups in the city of Zurich and neighboring municipalities as well as in Geneva can be arranged almost daily, we store your items in our furniture warehouse until delivery. This storage is absolutely free of charge for you. Our partner in Geneva is also available for pick-up and store items in their warehouse. The trips are carried out in both directions, i.e. Zurich to Geneva and Geneva to Zurich. Ask us about pickups in other regions of Switzerland. Along the entire route, we work with various partners who can pick up your furniture and goods and transport them on time and will store them for you until we collect and deliver the goods. We offer this service in all major cities in Switzerland. Zurich, Bern, Lucerne, Zug, Baden, Olten, Solothurn, Biel, Neuchatel, Lausanne and Geneva are the focus of the municipalities and cities on the route. Do you need transportation from Basel, Chur, Tesin, or other regions of Switzerland? Here too we will find a suitable transport option for you. In the future, we will also expand our routes and also regularly visit these locations. In principle, collections and deliveries are possible throughout Switzerland. Partner companies throughout Switzerland are helping us here to make this possible for you. Send us a non-binding inquiry if you have a need for a transport. We organize the entire logistics for you.\n\nWhich locations do we serve?\n\nThe A1 is the main traffic axis between Zurich and Bern and Bern and Geneva and runs across Switzerland. We control all municipalities and larger cities on this route. These naturally include (from east to west) Zurich, Aarau, Olten, Baden, Bern, Solothurn, Lausanne, Neuchatel, and Geneva. Of course we offer the routes in both directions. Zug and Lucerne are also very well connected with Zurich and Bern through the Uetliberg tunnel, so we can also combine towns on this route and in the whole of Centralschweiz. Depending on the volume of orders, we plan the route via Lucerne and / or Bern.\n\nCan moving goods or even an entire move be carried out as a \"collective shipment\"?\n\nIn principle, moves can also be combined. We can include additional loads with your move, or we can combine a smaller move as an additional load for our group trip. It always depends on the size and volume of the move, as well as your ability to be flexible with pick-up and delivery dates. Ask us about the possibilities. We are happy to examine possible combinations and then offer you discounts on your move. We also try to avoid empty trips as much as possible from an ecological perspective, so groupage and additional loads are an optimal way to avoid these empty trips."
