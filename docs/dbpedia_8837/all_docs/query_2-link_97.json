        "text": "Class Criteria Reader's experience Editing suggestions Example FA The article has attained featured article status by passing an in-depth examination by impartial reviewers from WP:Featured article candidates.\n\nMore detailed criteria\n\nThe article meets the featured article criteria:\n\nA featured article exemplifies Wikipedia's very best work and is distinguished by professional standards of writing, presentation, and sourcing. In addition to meeting the policies regarding content for all Wikipedia articles, it has the following attributes.\n\nIt is:\n\nwell-written: its prose is engaging and of a professional standard;\n\ncomprehensive: it neglects no major facts or details and places the subject in context;\n\nwell-researched: it is a thorough and representative survey of the relevant literature; claims are verifiable against high-quality reliable sources and are supported by inline citations where appropriate;\n\nneutral: it presents views fairly and without bias;\n\nstable: it is not subject to ongoing edit wars and its content does not change significantly from day to day, except in response to the featured article process; and\n\ncompliant with Wikipedia's copyright policy and free of plagiarism or too-close paraphrasing.\n\nIt follows the style guidelines, including the provision of:\n\na lead: a concise lead section that summarizes the topic and prepares the reader for the detail in the subsequent sections;\n\nappropriate structure: a substantial but not overwhelming system of hierarchical section headings; and\n\nconsistent citations: where required by criterion 1c, consistently formatted inline citations using footnotesâ€”see citing sources for suggestions on formatting references. Citation templates are not required.\n\nMedia. It has images and other media, where appropriate, with succinct captions and acceptable copyright status. Images follow the image use policy. Non-free images or media must satisfy the criteria for inclusion of non-free content and be labeled accordingly.\n\nLength. It stays focused on the main topic without going into unnecessary detail and uses summary style where appropriate.\n\nProfessional, outstanding, and thorough; a definitive source for encyclopedic information. No further content additions should be necessary unless new information becomes available; further improvements to the prose quality are often possible.\n\n(as of June 2018) FL The article has attained featured list status by passing an in-depth examination by impartial reviewers from WP:Featured list candidates.\n\nMore detailed criteria\n\nThe article meets the featured list criteria:\n\nProse. It features professional standards of writing.\n\nLead. It has an engaging lead that introduces the subject and defines the scope and inclusion criteria.\n\nComprehensiveness.\n\n(a) It comprehensively covers the defined scope, providing at least all of the major items and, where practical, a complete set of items; where appropriate, it has annotations that provide useful and appropriate information about the items.\n\n(b) statements are sourced where they appear, and they provide inline citations if they contain any of the four kinds of material absolutely required to have citations.\n\n(c) In length and/or topic, it meets all of the requirements for stand-alone lists; does not violate the content-forking guideline, does not largely duplicate material from another article, and could not reasonably be included as part of a related article.\n\nStructure. It is easy to navigate and includes, where helpful, section headings and table sort facilities.\n\nStyle. It complies with the Manual of Style and its supplementary pages.\n\n(a) Visual appeal. It makes suitable use of text layout, formatting, tables, and colour; and a minimal proportion of items are redlinked.\n\n(b) Media files. It has images and other media, if appropriate to the topic, that follow Wikipedia's usage policies, with succinct captions. Non-free images and other media satisfy the criteria for the inclusion of non-free content and are labeled accordingly.\n\n(c) Accessibility. It uses proper formating to be accessible to all readers. Bulleted and unbulleted lists and tables are structured correctly. Visual media, if included, utilize alternative (alt) text.\n\nStability. It is not the subject of ongoing edit wars and its content does not change significantly from day to day, except in response to the featured list process.\n\nProfessional standard; it comprehensively covers the defined scope, usually providing a complete set of items, and has annotations that provide useful and appropriate information about those items. No further content additions should be necessary unless new information becomes available; further improvements to the prose quality are often possible.\n\n(as of May 2018) A The article is well organized and essentially complete, having been examined by impartial reviewers from a WikiProject or elsewhere. Good article status is not a requirement for A-Class.\n\nMore detailed criteria\n\nThe article meets the A-Class criteria:\n\nProvides a well-written, clear and complete description of the topic, as described in Wikipedia:Article development. It should be of a length suitable for the subject, appropriately structured, and be well referenced by a broad array of reliable sources. It should be well illustrated, with no copyright problems. Only minor style issues and other details need to be addressed before submission as a featured article candidate. See the A-Class assessment departments of some of the larger WikiProjects (e.g. WikiProject Military history).\n\nVery useful to readers. A fairly complete treatment of the subject. A non-expert in the subject would typically find nothing wanting. Expert knowledge may be needed to tweak the article, and style problems may need solving. WP:Peer review may help.\n\n(as of June 2014) GA The article meets all of the good article criteria, and has been examined by one or more impartial reviewers from WP:Good article nominations.\n\nMore detailed criteria\n\nA good article is:\n\nWell-written:\n\nthe prose is clear, concise, and understandable to an appropriately broad audience; spelling and grammar are correct; and\n\nit complies with the Manual of Style guidelines for lead sections, layout, words to watch, fiction, and list incorporation.\n\nVerifiable with no original research:\n\nit contains a list of all references (sources of information), presented in accordance with the layout style guideline;\n\nreliable sources are cited inline. All content that could reasonably be challenged, except for plot summaries and that which summarizes cited content elsewhere in the article, must be cited no later than the end of the paragraph (or line if the content is not in prose);\n\nit contains no original research; and\n\nit contains no copyright violations or plagiarism.\n\nBroad in its coverage:\n\nit addresses the main aspects of the topic; and\n\nit stays focused on the topic without going into unnecessary detail (see summary style).\n\nNeutral: it represents viewpoints fairly and without editorial bias, giving due weight to each.\n\nStable: it does not change significantly from day to day because of an ongoing edit war or content dispute.\n\nIllustrated, if possible, by media such as images, video, or audio:\n\nmedia are tagged with their copyright statuses, and valid non-free use rationales are provided for non-free content; and\n\nmedia are relevant to the topic, and have suitable captions.\n\nUseful to nearly all readers, with no obvious problems; approaching (though not necessarily equalling) the quality of a professional publication. Some editing by subject and style experts is helpful; comparison with an existing featured article on a similar topic may highlight areas where content is weak or missing.\n\n(as of April 2019) B The article meets all of the B-Class criteria. It is mostly complete and does not have major problems, but requires some further work to reach good article standards.\n\nMore detailed criteria\n\nThe article is suitably referenced, with inline citations. It has reliable sources, and any important or controversial material which is likely to be challenged is cited. Any format of inline citation is acceptable: the use of <ref> tags and citation templates such as {{cite web}} is optional.\n\nThe article reasonably covers the topic, and does not contain obvious omissions or inaccuracies. It contains a large proportion of the material necessary for an A-Class article, although some sections may need expansion, and some less important topics may be missing.\n\nThe article has a defined structure. Content should be organized into groups of related material, including a lead section and all the sections that can reasonably be included in an article of its kind.\n\nThe article is reasonably well-written. The prose contains no major grammatical errors and flows sensibly, but does not need to be of the standard of featured articles. The Manual of Style does not need to be followed rigorously.\n\nThe article contains supporting materials where appropriate. Illustrations are encouraged, though not required. Diagrams, an infobox etc. should be included where they are relevant and useful to the content.\n\nThe article presents its content in an appropriately understandable way. It is written with as broad an audience in mind as possible. The article should not assume unnecessary technical background and technical terms should be explained or avoided where possible.\n\nReaders are not left wanting, although the content may not be complete enough to satisfy a serious student or researcher. A few aspects of content and style need to be addressed. Expert knowledge may be needed. The inclusion of supporting materials should be considered if practical, and the article checked for general compliance with the Manual of Style and related style guidelines.\n\n(as of January 2024) C The article is substantial but is still missing important content or contains irrelevant material. The article should have some references to reliable sources, but may still have significant problems or require substantial cleanup.\n\nMore detailed criteria\n\nThe article cites more than one reliable source and is better developed in style, structure, and quality than Start-Class, but it fails one or more of the criteria for B-Class. It may have some gaps or missing elements, or need editing for clarity, balance, or flow.\n\nUseful to a casual reader, but would not provide a complete picture for even a moderately detailed study. Considerable editing is needed to close gaps in content and solve cleanup problems.\n\n(as of June 2018) Start An article that is developing but still quite incomplete. It may or may not cite adequate reliable sources.\n\nMore detailed criteria\n\nThe article has a meaningful amount of good content, but it is still weak in many areas. The article has one or more of the following:\n\nA useful picture or graphic\n\nMultiple links that help explain or illustrate the topic\n\nA subheading that fully treats an element of the topic\n\nMultiple subheadings that indicate material that could be added to complete the article\n\nProvides some meaningful content, but most readers will need more. Providing references to reliable sources should come first; the article also needs substantial improvement in content and organisation. Also improve the grammar, spelling, writing style and improve the jargon use.\n\n(as of September 2014) Stub A very basic description of the topic. Meets none of the Start-Class criteria. Provides very little meaningful content; may be little more than a dictionary definition. Readers probably see insufficiently developed features of the topic and may not see how the features of the topic are significant. Any editing or additional material can be helpful. The provision of meaningful content should be a priority. The best solution for a Stub-class Article to step up to a Start-class Article is to add in referenced reasons of why the topic is significant.\n\n(as of December 2014)"
