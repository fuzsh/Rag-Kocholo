        "text": "English footballer (born 2002)\n\nJay Stansfield (born 24 November 2002) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Fulham. He began his football career with Exeter City, joined Fulham as a 16-year-old, and spent the 2022–23 season on loan at Exeter City. He has represented England at under-18, under-20 and under-21 levels.\n\nClub career\n\n[edit]\n\nSon of former Yeovil Town, Hereford United and Exeter City footballer Adam Stansfield, he began his footballing career in the academy of Exeter City. In August 2019, Stansfield signed for Championship side Fulham for an undisclosed fee.[3] On 4 January 2020, Stansfield made his debut for Fulham in an FA Cup third round match against Aston Villa, coming on in the 82nd minute for Josh Onomah.[4] Later that month, he made his league debut as an 88th-minute substitute in Fulham's EFL Championship match away at Charlton Athletic, again replacing Josh Onomah.[5] He scored his first goal for the club in the 26th minute of Fulham's EFL Cup tie against Birmingham City on 24 August 2021.[6]\n\nOn 2 September 2022, Stansfield returned to his boyhood club, Exeter City, on a season-long loan.[7] Stansfield made his Exeter debut on 3 September as a 79th minute substitute in a 1–0 victory over MK Dons. He wore the no. 9 shirt, which had previously been retired after the previous holder, his father, Adam Stansfield, died of cancer in 2010.[8] A run of four goals and two assists saw Stansfield win the EFL Young Player of the Month award for October 2022.[9] Stansfield completed his first career hat-trick, whilst wearing his dad's number 9 shirt, scoring all three goals in a 3-2 home victory for the Grecians against Morecambe in the final game of the EFL League One season.[10]\n\nStansfield signed for Championship club Birmingham City on 24 August 2023 on loan for the 2023–24 season.[11]\n\nInternational career\n\n[edit]\n\nHaving represented England at under-18 level, Stansfield made his under-20 debut on 7 October 2021 during a 1–1 draw with Italy at Technique Stadium in Chesterfield.[12]\n\nAfter Rico Lewis and Cole Palmer were moved up to the England senior squad because of injury withdrawals, Stansfield was added to the under-21 squad for European Championship qualifiers against Serbia and Northern Ireland in November 2023.[13] He came on against Serbia on 18 November, replacing Liam Delap after 67 minutes,[14] and twice came close to scoring, first with a turn and shot that hit the post and then with a shot that was blocked.[15] He started against Northern Ireland, and played 71 minutes in a 3–0 win.[14] Stansfield was again called up for qualifiers in March 2024; he was an unused substitute against Azerbaijan, and played 62 minutes without scoring in a 7–0 win against Luxembourg.[14]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of match played 16 August 2024\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League FA Cup EFL Cup Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Fulham 2019–20[16] Championship 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2020–21[17] Premier League 0 0 0 0 0 0 — 0 0 2021–22[18] Championship 1 0 0 0 1 1 — 2 1 2022–23[19] Premier League 3 0 0 0 1 0 — 4 0 2023–24[20] Premier League 0 0 — — — 0 0 2024–25[21] Premier League 1 0 0 0 0 0 — 1 0 Total 6 0 1 0 2 1 — 9 1 Fulham U23 2020–21[17] — — — 1[a] 0 1 0 Exeter City (loan) 2022–23[19] League One 36 9 2 0 — 1[a] 0 39 9 Birmingham City (loan) 2023–24[20] Championship 43 12 3 1 1 0 — 47 13 Career total 85 21 6 1 3 1 2 0 96 23\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nIndividual\n\nEFL Young Player of the Month: October 2022[9]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
