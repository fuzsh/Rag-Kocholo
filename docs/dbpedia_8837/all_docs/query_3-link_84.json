        "text": "Tony James, the Hereford United captain, may want to forget his 300th appearance for the Bulls this afternoon.\n\nHe was responsible for allowing Grays to score their first goal when he tried to dribble the ball out of danger but was dispossessed.\n\nIt was a similar mistake by James that let Cambridge score their first goal last Tuesday week.\n\nEveryone is human and everyone makes mistakes, but James has cost the Bulls two goals out of the four scored against them this season so far.\n\nThe management decided to leave James on the pitch, probably to try and rebuild his confidence, until the 71st minute when he was subbed.\n\nThe sarcastic cheers from sections of the crowd as he left the field will not have helped matters. A player with 300 games for the Bulls deserved better.\n\nGraham Turner and John Trewick have a difficult decision to make about James. If he is put on the bench for Monday's game it could dent his confidence further. To drop a player after a poor performance is not always easy, to drop the captain will be even harder.\n\nThe management will need to think whether a reshuffle at the back after just four games would improve matters. In general, Mkandawire, James and Beckwith look fairly solid and are getting used to playing with each other.\n\nAs regards taking the captain's arm band away from James, that too would dent his confidence. But, on the other hand, a captain should lead by example and James could be said to be failing to do that at present. Not only have he made mistakes which have led to goals but his distribution has been sub-standard recently.\n\nGraham Turner has been very loyal to Tony James, especially after James seemed to be thinking of a move away from Hereford last season. He will probably keep James as captain on Monday, but will expect better things from a player who is unlikely to be at Edgar Street next season.\n\nHereford United put in a poor performance at Edgar Street this afternoon and fell to their second defeat of the season. Newly promoted Grays Athletic looked a dangerous outfit that should do well in this league. However, they did not have to work too hard to gain victory today.\n\nManager Graham Turner kept the faith in the same side that defeated Crawley Town a week ago with Rob Purdie keeping his place in the middle of the park. The only change was on the bench where Darren Blewitt failed to recover from a foot injury and so Graham Evans took his place. Andy Ferrell was on the bench again; it is thought that he did not play today because Turner wants him to start against Tamworth, who will be a more physical side than Grays.\n\nHereford started brightly and were in control for the first quarter of an hour before disaster struck once again for Tony James. Jon Brady had fired an early shot over the bar before Guy Ipoua set up his strike partner Adam Stansfield with a ball in behind the defence, but Stansfield hit the side netting.\n\nWith fifteen minutes on the clock, Craig Mawson rolled the ball out to skipper James, who had been impressive until then, in the Hereford defence, and James was quickly closed down. Instead of clearing the ball to safety, or knocking it to Dean Beckwith who had given James an option to his left, he attempted to dribble the ball out of defence. He was soon tackled and Tony Battersby made no mistake in smashing the ball into the bottom corner beyond the reach of Mawson. This is not the first time that James has stupidly lost the ball in defence this season, leading to a goal for the opposition.\n\nIt was down hill for Hereford from then on, as heads dropped and Grays got a foot hold in the game. Chances were few and far between for the remainder of the half; Dennis Oli saw a shot after a Gray's break saved by Mawson while Ipoua's header from Ryan Green's cross was no trouble for Ashley Bayes in the visitors goal. On the stroke of half time Brady came close again with a free kick that was not too far away from the intended top corner.\n\nA far more eventful second period started with Stuart Thurgood curling an effort just wide. Brady was close yet again to equalising soon after; his half volley was just inches over the cross bar from twenty yards. John Nutter's left footed free kick on the flank bypassed everyone in the Hereford box although Gary Hooper almost connected with a header at the far post.\n\nRob Purdie spread play to Green on the right and the Welshman burst towards the box was ended as he was fouled twenty yards out. Alex Jeannin's free kick hit the wall though and a Gray's break away ended with man of the match Dean Beckwith heading a dangerous cross behind. Craig Stanley replaced the injured Rob Purdie with a hour gone. Stansfield headed Jeannin's free kick goal bound but once again Bayes wasn't troubled, while at the other end a misunderstanding between James and Beckwith resulted in a good recovering challenge from the latter.\n\nThis may have been the final straw for Turner and within minutes he replaced his captain, James, with Danny Carey-Bertram as The Bulls reverted to a 4-4-2 formation with Carey-Bertram on the left wing. Green kept the score at 1-0 when he cleared a header off the line following a corner before John Martin hit the post from close range, when he really should have doubled the visitors advantage. United broke quickly but Carey-Bertram's cross was cleared, triggering a counter attack for Athletic. Substitute Jamie Slabber beat the offside trap and had a clear run on goal, but shot wide with Tamika Mkandawire putting in a last ditch tackle to put him off.\n\nHereford had their best spell of the game after this with some good chances to level things up, but thanks to Bayes they failed to do so. Brady's corner was knocked on before Mkandawire's shot was blocked. It fell to Stansfield and his shot was blocked too before Beckwith volleyed over. At the other end a double goal line clearance by Green saved United further embarresment before Hereford felt sure they should have had a penalty. A shot by Carey-Bertram, after Stanley's free kick, hit the arm of a defender but the referee dismissed appeals.\n\nAfter hitting the defenders hand, the ball fell back to Stanley, who saw his drive go out for a corner. Mkandawire came close with a low left footed drive from twenty five yards, that almost caught Bayes unaware. However, the ex-Woking stopper scrambled across his line to push it out for a corner. Carey-Bertram then went close at the game came to an end after some good, patient, build-up play, when Stansfield knocked a short ball to him in the box but once again Bayes tipped the ball wide.\n\nHereford failed to make use of the five added minutes at the end and were punished right at the end. Martin had hit the side netting already before a cross in from the right was tapped in from close range by Hooper much to the delight of the 57 away fans. A fair number of the home fans in a crowd of 2,997, rose to their feet and left the stadium before the end of the game.\n\nAll in all, this was a poor performance by Hereford and they will definatly not be able to afford many more of that sort if they are to meet their ambition of automatic promotion this season. There were far too many players on the pitch today who, for one reason or another, did not seem to put the effort required in. Although short term memories of this result may be forgotten with a win at Tamworth on Monday, it may prove more costly come the end of the season.\n\nHUFC Team: Mawson, Mkandawire, James, Beckwith, Jeannin, Green, Coldicott, Purdie, Brady, Stansfield, Ipoua. Subs: Brown, Stanley, Ferrell, Carey-Bertram, Evans.\n\nGAFC: Bayes, Bruce, Stuart, Mawer, Nutter, Hooper, Thurgood, Martin, Poole, Oli, Battersby. Subs: Brennan, Matthews, Kightly, Ayres, Slabber.\n\nMichael Rose has told the Western Daily Press that he is hoping to make an impact at Cheltenham which will impress Gary Johnson, his manager at Yeovil. The 23 year-old is expected to play for his new club in the left of midfield tomorrow against Leyton Orient\n\nThe former Hereford United player has moved to Whaddon Road for a month as cover for Craig Johnson, who is injured.\n\n\"It's been frustrating so far this season and I have spoken to the gaffer (Gary Johnson) about it,\" said Rose.\n\n\"We agreed it would be good for me to go out on loan and play some games.\n\n\"I understand why I haven't been playing because the gaffer brought in Nathan Jones as an experienced left-back and he's done well.\n\n\"But it's an unusual situation for me because I've played regularly for both Yeovil and Hereford over the last few seasons. I've got to make sure I do well at Cheltenham and then wait for a chance to prove what I can do to Gary Johnson.\n\n\"I've spoken to John Ward and he's told me what his plans are. I can't expect to go to a new club and be playing straightaway but if I'm in the team I'll be delighted.\n\n\"As a footballer you just want to be playing in competitive games and I've only been in the reserves so far this season. So if I am playing on Saturday I've got to make sure I do well and keep my place.\"\n\nHereford United entertain Grays Athletic tomorrow at Edgar Street in what is beleived to be the first meeting between the two clubs.\n\nThe Bulls, who are now in second place in the Conference, will be hoping for a repeat of the home form which saw them put four goals past Scarborough two weeks ago. However Grays Athletic started the season off by putting six goals past Gravesend, so hopefully there will be some goals to be seen at the game.\n\nSince those first games, both sides have had set-backs. The Bulls lost at Cambridge, but won last Saturday at Crawley, whereas Grays have drawn their last two games.\n\nGraham Turner will have at least 18 of his 21 strong squad available. Long term injuries to Jamie Pitman and Simon Travis will keep them out although Pitman is close to being fully fit. Loan signing Darren Blewitt could be in contention although he may have a late fitness test on his foot which was x-rayed earlier this week.\n\nTurner is expected to keep to the same format as in the previous three games although as he told BBC Hereford and Worcester yesterday, it is taking time to bed in.\n\n\"With so many new faces in the side, it will take a little bit of time for it all to gel. There are occasions when there is a little bit of misunderstanding between players.\n\n\"The shape of the side is different from last season when we played 4-4-2. We've playing with the free player behind the front two strikers.\n\n\"The system is not working as smoothly as we would like, but it's comimg on.\n\n\"We could always revert back to the other system if we need to, but right at the moment I'm prepared to stick with it and hope it works.\n\n\"When you look at the results so far, the goals we've scored, the chances we've created, two clean sheets as well, it's not going bad at all.\"\n\nGrays Athletic are managed by 36 year old Mark Stimson, who had a playing career with over 240 league appearances at Tottenham, Newcastle, Portsmouth, Southend and Leyton Orient. However several of the players will perhaps be better known to Hereford United supporters.\n\nAaron McLean was with Aldershot when Hereford met them in the Conference play-offs in 2004. Described as a pacy 21-year-old striker McLean was with Leyton Orient initially and came to Grays on loan during 2002 before moving on to Aldershot Town in the Conference before being released by Shots manager Terry Brown and rejoining Grays. McLean didn't feature for Grays last Saturday.\n\nDean Brennan was with Stevenage, so should be well known to Jon Brady. He signed a two yeay deal with Grays in August 2004.\n\nAnd the BBC have picked out Gray's Stuart Thurgood as one to watch. The midfielder started almost 50 games for Southend before dropping out of the Football League but has time to make it back. Still only 24, Thurgood captained Grays to the Conference South and FA Trophy double last season.\n\nGrays are thought to have plenty of pace in their side. When asked about this Tony James, the Hereford United captain told BBC H&W:\n\n\"Should be interesting. They're a side that goes forward and tries to score lots of goals, it's the kind of game we enjoy ourselves. We like a big open game.\"\n\nBBC Radio Essex will have commentary on the game.\n\nIn his weekly column in today's Hereford Times, Graham Turner comments on how to play the game in the Conference.\n\n\"You either knock it long and run after it, which I understand Exeter, who have gone top of the league are doing. They have not strung two passes together yet - I have spoken to a number of people, in particular Stuart Watkiss at Kidderminster who played against them last week. From what he told me they had to sedate the ball at half time, it was battered so much!\n\n\"We want to get the ball down and pass it with a purpose. When we deviate from that pattern we look a poor side, but it needs 10 out-field players clued in to being available to receive the ball.\n\n\"It is obviously a more difficult way to play than just kicking the ball forward but also more pleasing on the eye and it can create a lot more chances.\n\n\"But with so many new faces in the side it will take a little time to get that understanding.\"\n\nSwansea City are to hold a press conference this morning at which it could be announced that Gavin Williams is to join the club on-loan for the season.\n\nFormer Hereford United player, Williams moved to West Ham last season from Yeovil for a reported £250,000 but has been unable to get in the first team on a regular basis.\n\nSwansea chairman, Hugh Jenkins, has admitted that they would like to sign Williams.\n\n\"We will keep pursuing it. Gavin wants to come to us and we want to sign him. The only stumbling block is Alan Pardew.\n\n\"He has said the player can go out on loan somewhere, but he has made it known to us that he would like him to play for a Championship side.\n\n\"A lot of Premiership sides think like that - they want to see what the players might be able to do for them in the future. It's a similar case to the one we had with Darren Pratley and Fulham.\n\n\"We think West Ham are going to make a final decision this week and, until he signs for someone else, nothing will be dead and buried as far as we're concerned.\"\n\nHereford United are to play Walsall this week behind closed doors. Its come about because the Saddlers want to look at Spanish goalkeeper Rafael Gonzalez Robles.\n\nThe former Real Oviedo keeper has been on trial with Saddlers for the last two weeks and will be hoping impress further according to the Express and Star.\n\nWalsall manager Paul Merson has arranged the private clash with Conference outfit Hereford to give Rafael the chance to shine again after he caught the eye with some smart saves against Redditch last week.\n\nSaddlers had been hoping to run the rule over the former Spain under-23s man in this week's opening reserves match of the season at Sheffield Wednesday, but a lack of international clearance prevented him from playing.\n\nNew rules prevent foreign players gaining clearance until they sign for a new club, and without it rules prevent them playing in Pontin's League action.\n\nMerson is keen to recruit another goalkeeper before the closure of the August transfer window, with inexperienced teenager Dean Coleman currently the only backup for No 1 Andy Oakes.\n\nFormer Hereford United stopper, Ben Scott, recently had a trial at Walsall.\n\nMeanwhile Bulls manager Graham Turner could use the match to allow those in his 21 man squad who haven't played any or much Conference football to have a game.\n\nAfter an 18-month absence from the terraces, the Independent Hereford United Supporters Magazine, \"Talking Bull\" will be back on sale from around 1:30 pm this coming Saturday, as the Bulls entertain Grays Athletic at Edgar Street.\n\nSelling at just £1, the fanzine is written by the fans - for the fans - and, as always, the new issue is a mixture of features, interviews, quizzes, plus the usual banter and extreme opinions - both positive and negative. It's what being a Hereford United fan is all about!\n\nThis season marks the 16th anniversary of the magazine, which was first published as a simple eight page typed, black-and-white edition way back in September 1989. The aim today is exactly as it was in the days of Ian Bowyer, Chris Hemming, and Jon Narbett, with the first ever editorial by Chris Jones and Keith Benjamin insisting \"Talking Bull will fill a gap in the lives of Hereford United fans everywhere, and will provide an alternative and witty look at the great game of football. We will take a critical look at the state of football in general, and at Edgar Street in particular.\"\n\nThis season, the fanzine's 44-pages are crammed full of articles, information and letters on a variety of subjects, and thanks to an affiliation with The Football Supporters' Federation, includes the latest information on football campaigns.\n\nThe fanzine is produced entirely voluntarily, and all profits are received by Hereford United - primarily in the form of player, match and match ball sponsorships, but also through ground advertising and donations.\n\nSupporters are urged to get their hands on a copy early this season, as with crowds topping the 3,300 mark, this the 90th issue of the fanzine, is likely to sell out. If there are any copies remaining after Saturday they will go on sale at Tamworth on Bank-Holiday Monday. To avoid missing out a subscription service is available to fans across the UK at just £11 for 8 issues, which includes postage.\n\nBulls News would like to thank Keith Hall for his help with this article.\n\nNext Saturday will be the first time Grays Athletic have visited Edgar Street for any fixture let alone a Conference game.\n\nThe Essex side come to Hereford as current top goalscorers in the league and with just one point less than the Bulls. They put six goals past Gravesend in their first game this season although were held to a 1-1 draw by York City last Saturday.\n\nBelow is a liitle information about Grays taken from their Official Website:\n\nGrays Athletic had to wait 115 years to reach the top flight of non-league football, but when the Club did make the grade, it did so in style.\n\nIn May 2005, the Club completed a remarkable double of league and FA Trophy success in a season of firsts.\n\nGrays clinched promotion to the Football Conference, becoming the first club to win the newly-inaugurated Conference South league, wrapping up the title by the end of March, scoring 118 goals in the process.\n\nThen, having claimed the scalps of Conference sides Exeter City and Burton Albion on the way, Grays faced Conference North side Hucknall Town in the FA Trophy final at Villa Park. A closely-contested game watched by over 8,000 fans went to extra time and then penalties, where 'keeper Ashley Bayes was the hero saving from Russell Cooke to claim the biggest knockout prize in non-league football.\n\nGrays were the first Club outside of the Football Conference to achieve this league and FA Trophy double.\n\nElsewhere Grays produced their first non-league internationals, with captain Stuart Thurgood playing two games for Paul Fairclough's England National Game XI and teammates Mitchell Cole and Dennis Oli also getting callups.\n\nHereford United came away from The Broadfield Stadium with an eventually comfortable 2-0 victory against Crawley Town. A generally poor first half lacked any real skill from either side, as the long ball tactic was adopted by both providing a frustrating spectacle.\n\nGraham Turner made one change from the side that has started the last two games with Rob Purdie being promoted from the bench, swapping places with Andy Ferrell. Otherwise, The Bulls were unchanged.\n\nHereford started well and created an early opening after a good run to the corner by Adam Stansfield, who crossed to the far post where Ryan Green layed the ball on to Jon Brady, but his effort was drilled over the bar. Stansfield tested 'keeper Phil Smith with a shot on the turn but Smith gathered easily before Richard Hodgson was booked for the hosts. Jamie Cade went close to opening the scoring for Crawley after a free kick from the left led to a scramble in the box before Cade forced it wide with the goal gaping.\n\nStansfield supplied his strike partner with a ball through on goal but Ipoua was forced wide by Smith but, having rounded the goalkeeper, had to cut back as he fired a tame effort wide. Ipoua then danced his way between two defenders and saw his effort deflected safely into the 'keepers arms while, at the other end, Steve Burton smashed a twenty five yard effort towards goal that needed the fingertips of Craig Mawson to push it over the bar.\n\nBurton then was gifted a chance to put the home side in front but was denied by the post after Stacy Coldicott was disspossesed and the ball was flicked through to Burton. Brady attempted an overhead kick from Stansfield's cross after Tamika Mkandawire had found the attacker, but it was off target as the half came to a close.\n\nThe game had faded towards the end of the first half and it also lacked incident until Hereford opened the scoring after fifty eight minutes. On one of the few occasions that The Bulls actually managed to get the ball on the ground and put together a series of passes, they tore Crawley apart and took the lead. Coldicott provided the defining pass after United had broke down the right, finding the run of Green in behind the defence and he slid the ball across the face of goal to give Ipoua the simple task of firing Hereford into the lead.\n\nBrady then had a great chance to double the advantage but his bullet header at the near post, from Ipoua's cross, was the wrong side of the post. Craig Stanley was introduced in place of Coldicott with twenty minutes to go while ex-Bulls Danny Davidson came on for Crawley. Brady's free kick caused all sorts of problems in the home sides penalty area with two crucial blocks keeping the scoreline down before a break saw a good chance for Burton, but he smashed his volley wide.\n\nFirst half sub, Stuart Douglas, shot on the turn but it was wide before Davidson almost equalised from the edge of the box. His low shot came off the foot of Tony James and totally wrong footed 'keeper Mawson. However, he managed to readjust quickly and throw himself down to tip the ball around the post for a corner. He then had to be alert as the corner dropped in the danger-zone and he was quickly down once again to claim.\n\nPurdie fired over the bar from twenty yards after man of the match Stansfield had past two defenders and cut back for him before Danny Carey-Bertram replaced Ipoua. The sub was involved in the build up to the second goal for Hereford, as he won them a corner on the right in the eighty third minute. Smith made a mess of clearing Alex Jeannin's corner and the ball fell into the path of Mkandawire who fired into the roof of the net for 2-0.\n\nStansfield was blantantly brought down as United broke late on and Ian Simpemba saw yellow for this act. The resulting free kick, in injury time, was worked down the right where Stansfield eventually crossed for Jeannin but he fired wide at the far post.\n\nAlthough the eventual outcome was reasonably comfortable for Hereford, there were stages in the game where the tactics appeared to be all wrong and it was difficult to see where a goal would come from. However, when decided to get the ball down it paid off. The first time they did this in the second half resulted in the opening goal. The overall performance was not the best, but the 300 or so travelling supporters in a crowd of 1,842 will be more than happy with the result.\n\nHUFC Team: Mawson, Mkandawire, James, Beckwith, Jeannin, Green, Coldicott, Purdie, Brady, Stansfield, Ipoua. Subs: Blewitt, Brown, Ferrell, Stanley, Carey-Bertram.\n\nCTFC: Smith, Judge, Simpemba, Hodgson, Elam, Wormwull, Cade, Blackburn, Woozley, Jenkins, Burton. Subs: Ward, Opinel, Douglas, Davidson, Brown.\n\nTony James, the Hereford United captain was interviewed by Keith Hall for BBC Hereford and Worcester after this afternoon's game at Crawley.\n\n\"It's been a difficult game. I think they only lost two games all season at home so we're glad to get three points.\n\n\"We've got some good defenders here now. We're getting to know each other a lot better. We're all strong players. We've just got to work a bit more as a team.\n\n\"It should pay off for us, it can only get better.\n\nReviewing the game James thought that his side had started very brightly and passed the ball well.\n\n\"But then we dropped off a bit and most of their efforts at goal were probably from our own mistakes.\n\n\"Second half we defended really well and did our job.\"\n\nThe interview turned to Ipoua who has scored three in three games and Jeannin.\n\n\"Guy Ipoua is on fire now. He can be frustrating at times but as long as he keeps scoring we won't mind that.\n\n\"Alex, great delivery from corners. We're not the biggest of teams, but delivery helps and if it's a good ball you have a chance of scoring.\"\n\nBulls News recently came across this potted history of Hereford United.\n\nArticle taken from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, although it was probably adapted from Ron Parrot's Hereford United book.\n\nHereford United F.C. are a football team from Hereford, currently playing in England's Conference National.\n\nThe geographical location of Hereford and a lack of local interest meant a senior football team was formed comparitavely late when Hereford United were founded in 1924.\n\nAn amalgamation of two local clubs - St. Martins and RAOC - meant the first semi-professional football side in the county. They were to play in the Birmingham Combination and ground-share the Edgar Street stadium with Hereford City, the leading amateurs in the town. United played their first ever match against Atherstone United, losing 3-2, and soon after they played their first ever FA Cup game - against Kidderminster Harriers - losing 7-2 in an extra preliminary round.\n\nBy 1932, Hereford were playing in the FA Cup first round but lost in a replay to Accrington Stanley, one of the former greats of English football. United progressed through the local leagues and into the Southern League by the outbreak of World War II in 1939. The Southern League provided the club with much interest in the non-league game and as time progressed, the Bulls became known as one of the top teams outside of the Football League. For twenty one successive seasons, United reached the first round of the FA Cup until election to the Football League, and constantly reminded the Football League of their potential.\n\nThe FA Cup provided highlights in the early years, an 11-0 win over Thynnes and a 18,000 crowd to watch Sheffield Wednesday defeat United 3-0 in 1958 were highlights. John Charles, the Leeds, Juventus and Wales legend took over as player/manager in the late 1960's and led the club to great things in the league, but it was his successor who achieved the ultimate aim. BBC Television followed Hereford's FA Cup 3rd round replay at Edgar Street in 1972 against Division One side Newcastle United. After a 2-2 draw at St James' Park, Hereford looked to be going out when Malcolm McDonald put the Magpies a goal up just eight minutes from time, but Ronnie Radford and Ricky George fought back to secure United a 2-1 victory - the biggest FA Cup shock of all time. The FA sat up, and United were duly elected to the Football League in the summer of that year.\n\nColin Addison led United to Division Three in their first season in the league, but he soon left and his assistant John Sillett took over, taking United up yet another rung in the Football League pyramid. However, everything happened slightly too quickly and United couldn't compete with the likes of Chelsea and Wolves, and were relegated back to Division Four by the summer of 1978.\n\nSince then, United have frequently battled against relegation from the Football League, and their battle was hampered through a limited catchment area and insufficient financial resources. However, they came close to gaining promotion in both 1985 and 1996, and missed out on beating Manchester United by one goal at Edgar Street in 1990. They did, though, beat Wrexham in the Welsh Cup final that year.\n\nWith automatic relegation from the Football League implemented in 1987, United clung on but the unimaginable happened in 1997 when they were relegated after a season-ending home draw with Brighton. A win would have meant relegation for the Seagulls.\n\nConference life hasn't been too good for United after several disappointing seasons, but two FA Cup runs have taken Hereford to the third round, and also to the semi-final of the FA Trophy in 2001. The club was taken over by Graham Turner, the former Shrewsbury Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers boss, in 1998, after he had initially come to the club as Director of Football in 1995. He remains in this position, and also as chairman.\n\n2003/04, though, was a different story. Hereford finished in second position, having won 91 points throughout the season and scored 103 goals, including a 9-0 win at Dagenham and Redbridge and two 7-1 victories, over Forest Green Rovers and Halifax Town. Nevertheless, they stumbled in the play-offs, losing on penalties to Aldershot Town after a 0-0 draw at Edgar Street and a 1-1 tie in the first leg at the Recreation Ground.\n\nUnfortunately in 2005, they failed again to be promoted to the League due to losing 2-1 on aggregate to Stevenage in the play-offs.\n\nJohn Trewick, the Hereford United coach has spoken to the Worcester News about tomorrow's game at Crawley.\n\nCrawley are not going to be a pushover,\" said Trewick. \"Statistics will tell that they had among the top two best home records in the division last year.\n\n\"They have drawn their first two games. The law of averages tells you that a third goalless draw is unlikely, but you never know.\n\n\"Crawley have got something that they want to build on this year. But we've got to go there positive, impose ourselves and play our normal game.\n\n\"We had a good away record last year and our approach will not change. We've always had a positive approach, whether we are at home or away. We want to win every game - that's how it is.\n\n\"We went to Cambridge looking to win, but it did not quite happen for us.\n\n\"We were denied a clear penalty after five minutes. The guy handled the ball on the line and should have been sent off. But the referee never gave it.\n\n\"Not that Cambridge were any better than us. They had a little bit of fortune and they were very up for it in their first home game. It was like a cup final for them.\"\n\nHereford United travel to the Broadfield Stadium tomorrow, home of Crawley Town, for their third Conference fixture of the season. United will be eager to put the disappointment of the defeat at Cambridge on Tuesday night behind them and get back on course with three points.\n\nThe sides met at the Broadfield Stadium on the second day of the season last time round and although the outcome was a point each, United were unlucky to concede from a late free kick that hit Jonathan Gould on the back and went in after Simon Travis cleared off the line. Hereford will be wanting to go one better and take all three points this time around though.\n\nCrawley have drawn twice so far and are yet to score a goal, but manager Francis Vines has been pleased with the two clean sheets that have been kept. \"I'm happy to have started the season with two clean sheets. Now we want a lot more of those, to keep making the chances and start taking them,\" he said, speaking to their official website.\n\nDanny Brown should be back to face the favourites after missing the tie with Dagenham & Redbridge with a foot injury. Midfielder Robbie Kember is likely to miss the game with Hereford as he is meeting a specialist about an eye problem. Defender James Donovan serves the final game of a three-match ban and is the only other player unavailable.\n\nOther than that, Vines has no other injury worries. He also hopes that now Crawley have become a full time club, the extra training will help his eight summer signings to gel in with the rest of the squad quickly.\n\nFor the visitors only Jamie Pitman and Simon Travis are ruled out. However, after the defeat on Tuesday, Graham Turner may choose to change things around a bit. He will not be forced to do so though, and he may well keep the faith with the side that has started the last two games.\n\n\"It's a setback it's not a disaster,\" said Turner, speaking to BBC H&W. \"What we have got to do now is pick ourselves up at Crawley. Pay attention to what we do well and that is getting the ball down and pass it. Don't knock so many long balls and be a liitle bit tight at the back. If we do that we can come away from Crawley with three points.\"\n\nIt is thought that under 16's can get into the game for free, as long as they enter through turnstile 9. However, it is not confirmed whether this offer is avaliable for away fans. The Bulls will hope that a good away following will spur them on to a first away victory, and help to forget the unfortunate result at Cambridge.\n\nBBC Hereford and Worcester have announced that they hope to bring commentary from Crawley tomorrow.\n\nTrevor Owens, head of sport, has sent the following:\n\nBBC Hereford and Worcester (in the shape of Keith Hall) is planning to bring first half updates, and then full second half commentary on the game on our 94.7 FM frequencies; but...and this is something of a bigger than normal \"but\"...\n\nThere have been problems with the ISDN line out of Crawley in the past; assuming this works, you will get the commentary. Colleagues in the deep south assure me it is now far more reliable than previously, but I am putting this proviso in place through my own bitter experience of having flogged round the M25 in the past (for a Worcester City game) only to find the line didn't work.\n\nAssuming all is well, Herefordshire listeners will get the United game; Worcestershire frequencies will get the Harriers game from Scarborough. I will inevitably age by about twenty years in forty-five minutes trying to make sure it all works when it should... United fans should also get the commentary on the internet at www.bbc.co.uk/hereford Go to the home page and click on the \"Listen Live\" button.\n\nEx-Hereford United player Gavin Williams is said to be considering a move to Swansea City\n\nWilliams played at the new Swansea stadium last night for Wales and was said to be impressed.\n\n\"This stadium is fantastic,\" the 25-year-old told the Evening Post after making his international bow.\n\n\"I've heard a few things about Swansea being interested in me and obviously I wouldn't rule out coming here. I suppose we will just have to see what happens.\n\nWilliams, famous for his Cardiff City-inspired Ayatollah goal celebration at Vetch Field two seasons ago, left Yeovil for the Hammers in a £250,000 switch last winter.\n\nBut he has not figured in the first team since the East London club's promotion to the Premiership, and Kenny Jackett, the Swansea manager, wants him to spruce up his midfield.\n\n\"I have spoken to the manager at West Ham (Alan Pardew) and he has told me I'm in his plans,\" Williams added.\n\n\"But I'm not involved at my club at the minute so I'm not sure what's going to happen.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I'm looking to move, but obviously I'm not playing first-team football so I have to consider my future.\n\n\"It's all right just staying at West Ham, but I need to be playing football so we'll wait and see.\"\n\nIronworks Gazette recently interviewed Gavin Williams. He talks about team-mate Darren Blewitt coming to Edgar Street. Below is part of the interview:\n\nWhilst Darren Blewitt still awaits to make his loan debut for Hereford United, his West Ham United colleague and former Bull Gavin Williams believes that Darren has made the right choice. Gavin told IG:\n\n\"I think that when you go out on loan you have got to go to the right club, it is no use going to any old club - it has to be the right club for that person. Obviously as you know I was at Hereford and one thing about that club is that they try to play football. I think that it will be a great experience for Darren and I think that he will do well there. He needs to get some first team games\"\n\nIt will be a big jump from reserve team football despite the Hammers being in the Premiership and the Bulls being in the Conference and Gavin explained:\n\n\"It is not the same really because obviously the three points at first team level means a lot more than three points at reserve team level. So it adds much more of a competitive edge to it\"\n\nWhilst Gavin is still very popular at Edgar Street, Hereford United fans are well known on the international scene as big followers of the England national team. But Gav will be thinking of his native Wales as they shortly face England in the World Cup qualifiers:\n\n\"Hopefully I will be in the squad and they don't come much bigger than a Wales v England World Cup qualifier, you know for a Welshman playing against England at Cardiff so fingers crossed. If I am selected that would be the biggest game of my career so far\"\n\nCrawley are advertising next Saturday's fixture against Hereford United as being free for kids. The Crawley Town press release states the following:\n\nKids Go Free During Holidays\n\nChildren under 16 years of age can gain free admission to the terraces for the two remaining Conference matches during the school holidays.\n\n(Bulls News will try and confirm if this applies to Hereford supporters tomorrow.)\n\nHowever the match will be segreated and the newly-refurbished social club will be open to Crawley supporters only.\n\nDirections to Crawley: (from the Official Crawley Town website)\n\nBy Car:\n\nFrom the M25 take the M23 southbound and exit at Junction 11.

It may be sensible to allow a little extra time for the journey from Herefordshire and surrounding areas.\n\nUnited's recent signing Stacy Coldicott says the side must now regroup after last night's 2-1 defeat at Cambridge, with the experienced midfielder urging the squad to commit themselves fully to achieving a result in Saturday's game at Crawley.\n\nSpeaking after the match to Keith Hall, who provided 'live' second half commentary on the match for BBC Hereford & Worcester, Coldicott gave his reaction to the defeat:\n\n\"Obviously we're all very disappointed. Although we probably haven't played as well as we could've done we still had opportunities to score quite a few goals. To get caught by a sucker-punch really, after we'd got ourselves back in the game, was disappointing.\"\n\nDid you think Fola Onibuje, who caused you problems in that first half, caught you by surprise?\n\n\"Maybe a little bit, maybe a lot of it was self-inflicted. We didn't really get to grips with him, and we didn't really get our game going. Like you said, he was a bit of a handful, but second half I think we coped a lot better. We started the second period well - we got the equaliser - and we felt there was only one winner then. But they hit us with the second goal, and caught us a little bit cold. If we'd have carried on playing to our strengths most of the time we'd have gone on to win.\"\n\nYou managed to close them down on the left side much tighter in the second half. Mark Angel appeared able to get a lot of crosses in from the left flank in the opening forty-five minutes?\n\n\"Yes, it was a decent supply. I used to play with him at West Brom and he's got a decent left-foot on him. They looked quite dangerous at times, but like I said, we should have won a lot more of the ball than we did.\"\n\nThe delivery from set-pieces from Alex Jeannin and Jon Brady must have given you some encouragement though?\n\n\"Yes, both players have good technique. We had an opportunity first half when 'Brades' sent over a free-kick to the back stick, but we had no-one attacking it really, and a few chances went to waste. It was good to see the goal coming from a set-piece again.\"\n\nHow exactly did the second goal come about?\n\n\"I think it was a deflection. We charged down a shot and it just looped off Tony's head, and the lads just ghosted in around the back and he's stuck it through 'Maws' legs. I think some of the times you just have to say - he's taken a chance - he's had a bit of luck - it's fallen right to his feet - and he's finished it quite well.\"\n\nOne positive from the game was the sides determination to play right to the final whistle, and Tamika had a great chance there - right at the death.\n\n\"Yea, Tam's obviously disappointed he didn't get that on target, but we got ourselves into a good position. We didn't play well in the first half, but we dug ourselves out, and it's unfortunate to lose it like we did in the end. We've now got to re-group and commit ourselves on Saturday.\n\n\"We've got to put it right at Crawley, and hopefully we'll be able to get a positive result down there.\"\n\nGraham Turner spoke to Sky after last night's game at Cambridge.\n\nAsked what cost his side the game the Hereford United manager replied:\n\n\"Suicidal defensive play. The first goal was ridiculous.\n\n\"I don't think they had too many chances. Not caused us any problems at all apart from the odd ball that got in the box for their big lad.\n\n\"Generally we defended that quite well. We defended the second ball quite well, but out of the blue we tried to run with it and got caught in possession and paid the penalty for it.\n\n\"I thought we had some good situations. I thought we had some decent chances and we should not have gone in one down. And I thought when we equalised, we would go on and win it.\n\n\"To be fair to Cambridge, they showed a lot of spirit, a lot of tenacity.\n\n\"We didn't play as well as we can, but we still created some good situations and should have done better from them.\"\n\nHereford United fell to their first defeat of the season last night away at the Abbey Stadium live on Sky TV. Cambridge United took the lead before half time and went on to win 2-1, after Guy Ipoua had netted an equaliser for the visitors. Graham Turner named, as expected, an unchanged side following the first day victory.\n\nThe Us started well with John Turner forcing a save from Mawson after his strike partner, Folawiyo Onibuje, flicked on a cross. Onibuje was at the heart of most of the hosts attacks and caused endless problems for the Hereford defence with his physical presence and power. The Bulls had a good penalty claim early on when Ipoua headed Brady's cross and the ball appeared to hit a defenders arm but the referee waved away the shouts.\n\nDavid Bridges headed over after attacking a cross from the left with a late run while Dean Beckwith nodded Alex Jeannin's corner over. Hereford began to take a hold of the game and it was Andy Ferrell who went close after a good break from defence. Man of the match Ryan Green collected a cross field ball and swung the ball into the near post where Ferrell beat the 'keeper to the ball but his shot was off target. Adam Stansfield headed wide before Brady went as close as anyone had came. Tamika Mkandawire broke up a prolonged Cambridge spell and brought the ball out of defence, played a one-two and the delivered a cross for Brady, who volleyed towards the far post but the ball bounced inches wide.\n\nHowever, moments before the half time break, the hosts were in front. Tony James, for some reason known only to him, attempted to dribble the ball out of defence between two opposing players. Inevitably, he was dispossessed and The Us had fired the ball beyond Craig Mawson before you knew it. Steven Smith fired the ball in from twenty yards to make it 1-0. Ipoua attempted to level things up before the break but his shot on the turn was off target.\n\nStacey Coldicott saw his volley held after Brady's corner was only half cleared at the start of the second half before David Chick was booked for hand ball on the edge of his own penalty area. Brady was unable to take advantage of the chance and shot wide though. Turner made his first change with Rob Purdie replacing Ferrell early on in the half and within five minutes Hereford had equalised, not before Onibuje had headed wide and Brady had fired over from twenty yards.\n\nThe Bulls won a corner and on hand at the far post was Ipoua who powered a header into the bottom corner from Jeannin's deep cross. The goal spurred the Bulls on and for a while it looked as though there would only be one winner. Green played a neat ball down the flank to Ipoua, who held up play before finding Stansfield in the box. Stansfield layed it on for Green who hammered a left footed drive towards the top corner, but it was superbly kept out by Darren Behcet. He dropped the ball though and Brady was quickly on the scence to hit a rebound but Behcet completed a great double save.\n\nBeckwith picked out Jeannin on the left with a good long ball and Ipoua was unfortunate not to get on the end of the Frenchman's cross as it was turned behind by Chick. Then, against the run of play, The Us found themselves in front once again. A high ball into the box was headed away by Mkandawire but fell nicely for Turner. His volleyed shot was closed down by James, but it fell kindly to Bridges who managed to slip the ball in from a tight angle. Coldicott was replaced by Danny Carey-Bertram in attempt to change fortunes by the Hereford manager.\n\nThere was more poor play by Hereford at the back and they almost gifted Cambridge a third goal. Sub Parys Okai dispossed a defender and delivered a perfect cross for Onibuje at the far post but he managed to head wide while unmarked at the far post. The Whites were given one final chance in injury time when Ipoua was felled on the edge of the box having already skinned two opponents. Brady hit the free kick off the wall and it fell to Mkandawire, but he scooped a volley over the bar from three yards.\n\nHaving not built on the home success of the first day of the season will be very dissapointing for Hereford. They will be even more frustrated with the defeat as it was not really deserved. The Bulls will feel that they did enough to gain at least a draw from the game but in the end a defensive mistake has cost them dearly. There is, though, plenty of time to make up any lost ground following this 2-1 defeat in front of a gate of 2,924.\n\nHUFC Team: Mawson, James, Mkandawire, Beckwith, Jeannin, Green, Coldicott, Ferrell, Brady, Ipoua, Stansfield. Subs: Blewitt, Brown, Purdie, Stanley, Carey-Bertram.\n\nCUFC Team: Behcet, Gleeson, Peters, Duncan, Chick, Smith, Bridges, Quinton, Angel, Turner, Onibuje. Subs: Okai, Daniels, Nolan, Robbins, Duffy.\n\nThis report is from Amber and Black:\n\nCambridge United clawed back some pride after their embarrassing opening day defeat by ten-man Forest Green with a victory against Hereford United.\n\nRoared on by a crowd of almost 3,000 despite the match being televised live on Sky, the U's got off to a slow start, but gathered momentum after Hereford squandered early chances.\n\nThey got a huge boost two minutes before the break when youth team midfielder Steve Smith hammered a 20-yarder past goalkeeper Craig Mawson.\n\nAnd although Hereford equalized through the always dangerous Guy Ipoua just after the hour, they never looked like causing the kind of damage which brought them four second-half goals against Scarborough on Saturday.\n\nCambridge, who were only hours away from going out of business during the summer, sent their faithful fans wild in the 70th minute when John Turner's shot was deflected to the feat of David Bridges who drove a low angled drive inside the far post.\n\nSmith's goal was also a quality strike from 20 yards, whereas Hereford's was something of a gift, Ipoua heading home from only three yards following a corner.\n\nHereford were ruing their first-half carelessness when Jon Brady sliced the ball across the face of goal and Adam Stansfield had an effort blocked on the goal-line by centre-back Andy Duncan.\n\nIt took some time for Cambridge's nerves to settle in their first match outside the Football League in front of their own fans for 35 years, but the side which contained only four survivors from the League Two line-up began to knit together well in the second half.\n\nThere was an anxious end for them however as Hereford were awarded a free-kick on the edge of the box in stoppage time. Brady blasted the ball in and the rebound fell to Tamika Mkandawire, who could only scoop it over the crossbar from close range.\n\nHereford United will bounce back from the defeat at Cambridge last night, but will need to give some thought as to why the defence let in two goals.\n\nThose supporters at the game were dismayed to see Tony James lose the ball when attempting to dribble forward, which resulted in Cambridge's first goal.\n\nThe second goal appeared to come off a defender into the path of a Cambridge forward. Those watching on Sky would have had a better view of this goal than the 261 Bulls' fans who were at the far end of the ground.\n\nAt least we were lucky to see the game. Some Hereford United supporters caught up in the travel problems in Worcestershire failed to reach the ground.\n\nWith an accident on the M5 and one on the M42, many were caught up in the jams. There was a fatality in both accidents.\n\nLuckily we were alerted by the travel news on BBC Hereford and Worcester that there were problems ahead and so took the Stratford route out of Worcester. Although this route was very slow we arrived at the ground in good time. Had it not been for H@W, we could have been stuck for sometime.\n\nBefore entering the ground, we had to walk over a cattle grid and through a small field which had been grazed by cattle. They had left their mark all over the path.\n\nCambridge United claim that their bacon rolls have won an award, so having entered the ground, several were purchased. They were awful. It appears that the bacon pre-cooked before reaching the ground. Perhaps it was left over from last season. They did give us a refund.\n\nAfter Saturday's four goals, fans were looking for a repeat. And when the messeage came through that Stevenage's Maamria had been sent off, spirits rose. The first half was a well contested affair and when Cambridge took the lead, the feeling was that the Bulls would bounce back. They did but it wasn't enough.\n\nThe journey back was less eventful, until motorway signs showed the M5 still shut. Luckily the signs were incorrect.\n\nHereford United travel to the Abbey Stadium this evening for their first away fixture of the Conference season against Cambridge United, just relegated from the Football League. Kick off is at 8.05 p.m. because the game is being screened live on Sky Sports.\n\nThe U's found out that life in the Conference could be difficult as they suffered a 1-0 defeat at the hands of lowly Forest Green Rovers, who had been reduced to ten men. Cambridge will be wanting to put it a big performance after the opening day disappointment, especially in front of their home fans for the first time this season and with the game being live on Sky.\n\nRob Newman has to make one forced change to the side he named against FGR because eighteen year old defender Adam Davies is involved in the Wales under 21 international fixture. New signing Rob Duffy may feature instead.\n\nThe two sides haven't met since January 1997, when The Bulls defeated their opponents 1-0 at Abbey Road. However earlier that season Cambridge came to Edagr Street and won by the same margin.\n\nGraham Turner has no fresh injury worries following the impressive first day victory over Scarborough. Jamie Pitman and Simon Travis remain the only players on the sidelines and it will be a few weeks before either return. It is thought that Turner will keep the faith with the side that started on Saturday.\n\nFollowing the excellent display on Saturday, The Bulls will be intending to continue in the same vein of form and take all three points from Cambridge, who will also be aiming to put right the wrongs from the showing at The Lawn. It would be dissapointing to say the least if Hereford did not take anything from the game, having given themselves a great base to start from with the demolision of The Seadogs.\n\nCambridge United are pulling all the stops out for the visit of Hereford United to the Abbey Stadium tomorrow evening.\n\nWith the special offer of free entrance for children under 16, provided they are with an adult, and pre-match entertainment, the evening should be a colourful event.\n\nThe home supporters will be dressed in yellow and it is hoped Hereford fans will wear white. (It might help the Sky commentators!)\n\nCambridge United have sent Bulls News the following press release:\n\nTomorrow evening Cambridge United is bringing the flavour of Sun, Music and Football to the Abbey Stadium and their home match against Hereford.\n\nWith the weather forecast being predicted Hot, Dry and Sunny, the club via CFU is bringing the sound of Samba to the match to help provide a carnival atmosphere for the crowd via local community Samba band Arco Iris (http://www.arcoiris.org.uk/)\n\nArco Iris (Portuguese for rainbow) was first formed in 1992 by the local council to provide a means to involve the community in Samba music.

Blewitt was named on the bench for Hereford United last Saturday, but was not required.\n\nBlewitt was said by the official Hereford United website to have signed for the Bulls on a season long loan deal, but there is some doubt whether that is strictly correct.\n\nSources have told Bulls News that the deal may only be until January when it will be reviewed. Blewitt is said to want first team action and was wary of agreeing to committ himself for the whole season.\n\nBlewitt comes to Edgar Street with somewhat of a reputation as a strong tackler. It has even been suggested that Teddy Sheringham at West Ham asked for him not to train with the first team as he had been on the receiving end of Blewitt' tackles.\n\nHe was interviewed recently by the West Ham United fanzine Ironworks Gazette after his loan spell at Southend was over.\n\nAsked about any future loan move Blewitt replied: \"I would tell the manager concerned what I want to get out of my loan which is to actually play first team football and then I would listen to what that manager had to say to me.\"\n\nHe was asked about his discipline.\n\n\"You know a couple of years ago I was getting what ten? Twenty yellow cards a year?\"\n\nBut last season was better?\n\n\"I think that I had two yellows but then I got booked in four games in a row. So I think that I ended up with about six cards all season, six or seven yellows which is good for me.\"\n\nAnd you weren't sent off last season?\n\n\"I think that it is, yes it is definitely the first season I can ever remember at any level where I haven't been sent off, but I still cannot understand how it happened. You know in some of the games I played in I was definitely near the mark but I think that the referees are getting to know me and they speak to me a lot more. When I was on the bench for Southend and was doing warm ups, a referee came and spoke with me whilst I trying to warm up. The referee who was in charge for a Southend first team game had been in charge at a few West Ham reserve team games. He just came up to me and said \"Alright Blewitt?\" so a few of them are getting to know me now so it was good.\n\n\"My temperament is something that I have had to work on both on and off the pitch, I do feel a lot calmer but if I hadn't got my act together I wouldn't still be here would I? I've still got a bit of an aggressive edge to my game, you cant lose it completely because you would lose the player. When I am playing I will never shy away from a tackle and I will always be shouting, that will never change. I will always be geeing the boys up because that is the way that I am on the pitch. Off the pitch I have changed a lot as well.\"\n\nJimmy Quinn, the former Shrewsbury Town manager, is backing Stevenage to win the Conference title, and took a swipe at Graham Turner being both chairman and manager at Edgar Street in this mornings NLP.\n\n\"I'm going to stick my neck out and back Stevenage Borough for the title,\" said Quinn who then said that strikers Elding and Maamria are the key.\n\n\"Hereford, as ever, will be knocking on the door, but there are a lot of teams who have a shout.\n\n\"Hereford will probably be favourites and Graham Turner's teams always play good football. But with him being chairman as well as manager, he has to be careful he gets his budget right and that footballing matters don't get in the way of that.\n\n\"Certainly, his side played the most entertaining football last year and were a joy to watch. Their key player is Adam Stansfield and, if he's on form, they should do well.\"\n\nMeanwhile the NLP reports that Terry Fearns may move from Southport. The striker who bagged 41 goals for his side last season is said to be wanted by Mark Wright at Peterborough. Fearns scored against Hereford United in the FA Cup last season.\n\nJohn Trewick told BBC Hereford and Worcester that today's win was a great result.\n\n\"We had to be a little patience in the first half. We hit the post, had a really good chance which we missed. So it looked as though we were going to have to work really hard to get opportunities. But we kept plugging away and we got our reward,\" said the Hereford United coach.\n\n\"In the end we won by four, hit the woodwork a couple of times and had another couple of situations when we might have scored.\n\n\"But we must not get carried away, it's the first game of the season.\"\n\nTalking about Guy Ipoua, Trewick said he's a well travelled player.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity for Guy, even though he has come out of the league, to reignite his last three, four or five years of his career.\n\n\"He can score goals. he's got a good touch. He turns very, very well with the ball. He's got a lot of assetts. Hopefully we'll be good for each other.\n\nRelecting on the mid-field Trewick said Ferrell and Coldicott are two tough cookies.\n\n\"Stacy has got a lot of experience. He puts messages around on the field, gets people in the right areas, drives people through.\n\n\"Andy is very, very busy. He gets around the field, tackles people. He heads it, gets forward.\n\n\"They have both got a lot to offer us. You play against those two over ninety minutes and you'll know you've been in a game.\"\n\nAfter a goalless first half, Hereford United ripped Scarborough apart at Edgar Street with four goals after the break. Graham Turner handed debuts to Dean Beckwith, Alex Jeannin, Andy Ferrell, Stacy Coldicott, Jon Brady and star of the show, Guy Ipoua. (pictured at the open day)\n\nScarborough enjoyed the opening spell with some prolonged possession although it was the hosts who threatened first when Jeannin's dangerous cross from the left was headed behind. Clear cut chances were hard to come by in this tough opening half, which saw two very determined teams foil each others attacks.\n\nIt was United who almost took the lead midway through the half after some good build up play. Ferrell played the ball into Ipoua who, with his back to his marker, flicked the ball around the defender, and sprinted through on goal. The Cameroonian did everything right and fired beyond the reach of Leigh Walker in the Boro goal, but was denied by the near post.\n\nRyan Green had a good opportunity when his run into the box from the right was picked out with a good pass, but he took an extra touch forcing him wide. The Welshman managed to cut the ball back across goal where Adam Stansfield attempted to force the ball over the line but the danger was cleared.\n\nScarborough's first chance did not come until just in the second half, but they will look back on this missed opportunity and perhaps mark that as a changing point in the game. Jeannin mis-judged a left wing delivery, allowing it to go over his head and Ashley Lyth was behind him to direct a header goalwards. Craig Mawson came to Jeannin's rescue and plucked the ball out of the air to keep the scoreline level.\n\nIpoua, whose power and pace caused problems for the Seadog's defence all afternoon, hit a Green cross against the cross bar, triggering a goalmouth scramble where Stansfield also had a good chance to net. Then, United were incensed as they were denied what appeared to be a fairly clear cut penalty. Jeannin went to head a cross at the far post, and in doing so was caught on the head by a flying Scarborough foot. The referee, though, amazingly ignored the claims and allowed play to continue, even though Jeannin was on the floor with a head injury.\n\nFinally though, The Bulls did get their breakthrough and it was a debutant who opened his Hereford account. Jeannin took a corner from the right and up leapt Beckwith at the near post to glance a header towards goals. It flew beyond Walker and hit the underside of the bar before bouncing into the gaping net in front of a packed Meadow End.\n\nFrom then on it was all one way traffic as the floodgates opened and the Bulls did not hesistate in taking full advantage. Other than a one off attack for the visitors, in which Mawson did well to come out and deny Mark Quayle, The Bulls dominated fully and played some fantastic football much to the delight of the Edgar Street crowd of 3105.\n\nHereford's second goal followed five minutes later when Green knocked the ball back to Brady on the right flank and he swung in an inch perfect cross to Ipoua. Ipoua held off the challenge from his marker and met the ball with a diving header, sending the ball underneath the diving goalkeeper.\n\nRob Purdie was introduced in Brady's place, he had been booked, with fifthteen minutes remaining and Carey-Bertram replaced Stansfield on eighty three minutes, two minutes before the Bulls made it three. The Bulls broke quickly after a Boro corner through Green. He raced forward before releasing a pass to Ipoua, but his shot was pushed away. Luckily though, it fell right into the path of Green, who'd continued his run, and he hammered the ball into the back of an empty net.\n\nIpoua received a standing ovation as he left the field of play, and Craig Stanley took his place. In the final minute the rout was completed in a move that involved all three of the substitutes. Rob Purdie burst forward before sliding a pass into the path of Stanley's run, just in the penalty box, but his low show was pushed away by Walker, but Carey-Bertram was on hand to fire home to make it 4-0 to the Bulls.\n\nThere were many happy faces seen leaving Edgar Street this afternoon, having witnessed what was a very good opening day of the season for United. The team was organised in defence and looked full of ideas going forward. After a tough first half, Hereford broke down their opponents and went on to demolish them, sending out a stern message to the rest of the Conference. They will be eager to follow this result up though, when they make the trip to Cambridge United on Tuesday night, in front of Sky TV cameras.\n\nHUFC: Mawson, James, Mkandawire, Beckwith, Green, Jeannin, Coldicott, Ferrell, Brady, Stansfield, Ipoua.
