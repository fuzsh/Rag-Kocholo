Self-nominated at 23:36, 18 August 2015 (UTC).\n\nNew article of more than sufficient length, created and nominated on the same day, citations are plentiful, and hook facts are properly cited, interesting, and of proper length. Tone is neutral and close paraphrasing appears to have been avoided. QPQ checks out. Good to go for all three hooks but I have a strong preference for ALT2. - Dravecky (talk) 09:37, 29 August 2015 (UTC)\n\nALT2 works fine for me, I have no preference over any of the hooks. :) - Neutralhomer • Talk • 14:39, 29 August 2015 (UTC)"
