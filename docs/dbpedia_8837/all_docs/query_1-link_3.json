I think if there were an image in the infobox it would also naturally appear in the page preview for Principia College? However, if I don't want to go so far as to put an image in the infobox, is there a way to redirect the first image of the page to be used as the page preview image?\n\nThanks Archivingperson (talk)\n\nCourtesy link: Draft:Shua Hoffman\n\nHey, my wiki page keeps getting rejected. its for an artist (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shua_Hoffman) ‚Äî Preceding unsigned comment added by Shua Hoffman (talk ‚Ä¢ contribs)\n\nHello, Shua Hoffman. Your draft was not rejected, but rather it was declined. These are two different things. As for your draft, it utterly fails to show that this person is a notable musical performer. Wikipedia is not a social media site and is not a directory of every musician on Earth who has a social media account. Please read WP:AUTOBIOGRAPHY to understand why your effort is a bad idea and unlikely to be successful. Cullen328 (talk)\n\n@Shua Hoffman: Welcome to the Teahouse. Please see what is considered a reliable source; understand while writing about yourself isn't forbidden, it is strongly discouraged; and that Wikipedia is not for promotional purposes. ‚ÄîTenryuu üê≤ ( üí¨ ‚Ä¢ üìù )\n\nHey, I was wondering if anyone would like to give an unbiased, informative, constructive interview with the artist known as Henry Reyes, aka PhilmyPortraits. I've been in contact with him in several informal scenarios, and his philosophies and policies are interesting, to say the least. He's beginning to work on NFTs, and I think it would be in the best interest of his audience to know the artist behind the works.\n\nHe's a bit terse and elusive, so any information that can be gathered about his individual is vital. For anyone interested, I'll be willing to share notes on the artist's professional life. I've also asked permission to publish an article on him, for valuable informative points he makes. Watsoncreativemedia (talk)\n\nWatsoncreativemedia Hello and welcome to the Teahouse. Please see your user talk page for important information about your username and conflict of interest.\n\nThis isn't really the forum to solicit an interview with who I presume is your client. Interviews are primary sources and do not establish notability as Wikipedia defines it for artists. Privately held notes or other information is also not acceptable; it must be in a published, publicly available independent reliable source. An article would need to summarize what independent reliable sources with significant coverage have chosen on their own to say about Mr. Reyes. His permission is not required for there to be an article about him on Wikipedia; articles are typically written by independent editors without any involvement from the subject. Mr. Reyes may wish to read this essay about why an article about him might not necessarily be a good thing. 331dot (talk)\n\nWatsoncreativemedia, Wikipedia is not interested in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is only interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. --ColinFine (talk)\n\nSo, if I write my article to a reliable news source, then get someone else to reference the article, that would work, right? And I don't get to edit the wiki?\n\nHe already has articles out there about him, I could reference those easily. I also know folks who know nothing about the subject, and they wouldn't be paid to do so. It's just easier to get information straight from the horse, so i thought that would be the first step. ‚Äî Preceding unsigned comment added by Clynnwat (talk ‚Ä¢ contribs)\n\nAlso, I don't have a personal interest in his work, but he's gaining popularity. I'm not being paid for this article, i think it would be informative to note someone who has a profound effect on the art world. I have no interest in promoting his work, and I won't even link to his social media. The guy has a bachelor's degree in liberal arts, and he's become a point of interest for people who think negatively of him. I just want to put the real story out there from a professional point of view.\n\nClynnwat Not exactly. Wikipedia is not a place to get information straight from the horse- it gets information from the people who got the information from the horse, so to speak. If you \"get someone else to reference the article\", that simply transfers the conflict of interest to them. Same if you approach \"folks who know nothing about the subject\". If there are already independent reliable sources that cover Mr. Reyes in depth, you may create a draft at Articles for Creation that summarizes those sources, and then submit it for a review, but you should review WP:COI and WP:PAID first(you don't have to be specifically paid to edit to be a paid editor, any paid relationship triggers the disclosure requirements). If you just want to tell the world about him as you see fit, you should use social media or a website owned and operated by you or Mr. Reyes. 331dot (talk)\n\nClynnwat, I'm struck by something that you wrote: I have no formal association with Mr. Reyes, I just believe his subject of choice is strange enough to merit notability. And if it is such an issue, i will see to it that he makes his name in the US news. (My emphasis.) You seem to have it the wrong way around. Articles in Wikipedia are written about people who have already made their name (whether in the US news or elsewhere). Moreover, it sounds as if you are intent on publicizing Reyes on Wikipedia. If this is so, please don't: you'd only be wasting time, primarily your own. -- Hoary (talk)\n\nHello I had a question, Is there a way to add a honorific prefix or something that does the same thing to a royalty info box? Orson12345 (talk)\n\nHello Orson12345, and welcome to the Teahouse. You can add an honorific prefix to the infobox title itself in some cases, only when appropriate. See MOS:HONORIFIC for better understanding. Kpddg (talk)\n\nKpddg Thank you for responding. I tried adding a honorific prefix to a royalty info box but it doesn‚Äôt let me. I‚Äôve added honorific prefix‚Äôs to nobility info boxes and officeholder info boxes and it let me but for some reason it doesn‚Äôt let me with royalty info boxes. So I wanted to know if there‚Äôs a way around that. Orson12345 (talk)\n\n@Orson12345, could you tell which page you are having probelms with? Kpddg (talk)\n\nI would just like to point out the honorofic 'His Grace' you added in the article John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. According to MOS:HONORIFIC, such prefixes should not be added before the name, but can be discussed in the article. Honorofics are used in cases only when it is so commonly attached to the name that reliable sources without it are not found. (Example: Mother Teresa). We do not usually add such prefixes in the infobox, but they can be mentioned in the article. Thank You. Kpddg (talk)\n\n@Kpddg I wanted to add His Serenity to Leonardo Loredan. Orson12345 (talk)\n\nThis article does not have an infobox, that is why you are not being able to make the additions. You can mention this title in the text of the article itself. Kpddg (talk)\n\nWell I guess most editors don‚Äôt follow that rule because almost every duke in Wikipedia have his His Grace attached to there name. Orson12345 (talk)\n\nI might be mistaken, but I checked articles on many Dukes to clarify (like listed in Duke of Cornwall, List of dukes in the peerages of Britain and Ireland, Duke of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence, Duke of York, etc.) and did not find any honorific prefix in the infobox. I know I have written this several times, but please do read MOS:HONORIFIC. A good way to resolve this would be to discuss on the article talk page. If you still think I am mistaken, please do ask another editor as well for their opinion. Thanks again. Kpddg (talk)\n\nIs it acceptable to refer to a source that is behind a paywall? Does that still count as being in the public domain? Occasionalpedestrian (talk)\n\nFor info on sources behind a paywall, see WP:PAYWALL. It is not necessarily public domain. --David Biddulph (talk)\n\nIt is acceptable to use paywalled and offline sources (like, you know, books), although most editors prefer easily accessible sources. Paywalled sources do count as published (in fact, most academic literature these days has a \"preprint\" version not behind a paywall, and a \"published\" version behind a paywall that is considered authoritative). This is different from public domain, which refers to copyright. ‚ÄîKusma (talk)\n\nHello! I have recently undertaken a project where I am translating a featured article (–ì–æ—Ç–æ –ü—Ä–µ–¥–µ—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞—Ü–∏—è) from the Russian Wiki. Would it be better for me to purely translate the article, or fact check every piece of information with the source? I am concerned in doing the later as Google Translate may not translate correctly the many Russian sources, thus making my corrections factually incorrect. As it is a featured article, it should be reviewed enough where all the information is correct. Everything in the article correlates with the little information in English, and at a brief review everything looks sound. I plan in not being blind to the information, but not correlating every fact. Is this the correct course of action? GGOTCC (talk)\n\nYou should not translate articles in languages you do not speak. You especially should not use Google Translate to perform article translations. Typically research is required for translating an article, which is why it is best left to those who are fluent in both languages. ‚Äì‚ÄìFormalDude talk\n\n@GGOTCC I agree that you need to read each source yourself and base what you write on what they actually say. You really do need to have a very basic grasp of the other language to be able to wade through those sources, although Google Translate can be used to do the ‚Äòheavy lifting‚Äô.\n\nBy way of example, I only know schoolboy French (last studied 45 years ago!), yet could get enough out of the French sources I found with the help of GT to create this article which got into DYK last week. Although articles on this Frenchman already exist in 3 other languages, I never felt the need to look any of them, other than the quickest of skims. It took week‚Äôs of hard work, but was worth it. Good luck! Nick Moyes (talk)\n\nI understand; thank you both! GGOTCC (talk)\n\nHi,I'd very much appreciate your help, if possible! ..I'm trying to upload an image to the page Islamic Reporting Initiative - specifically, a picture of the chairman, who is himself already on Wikipedia - Mohamed Amersi - but not yet with an image. I'm in contact with him and he has given me permission to use a picture for use on Wikipedia, which is a picture to which he holds all the rights. I have completely read through the Wikipedia page Wikipedia:Uploading images, plus some of its subpages, but I'm still not entirely sure that after I publish it on the page - which in itself seems simple enough - it won't be immediately removed.. I think my questions are: a) Does my image qualify as a 'fair use image'?, b) Am I allowed to upload this image directly to the English Wikipedia?, and c) If I do (upload to English Wikipedia) what are the downsides vs uploading to Wikimedia Commons? Again, I'd be extremely grateful for your guidance. Thank you and have a great day! Julianross CSR (talk) 10:56, 2 February 2022 (UTC) Julianross CSR (talk)\n\nHello, Julianross CSR, and welcome to the Teahouse. Thank you for wanting to help improve Wikipedia. First, please notice that \"upload an image to the page\" is not an accurate description: you upload an image, and (separately) use it on one or more pages. Now about using it: there are two quite separate paths for using images. Either the image is freely licensed and can be uploaded to Commons and then used on English Wikipedia and any other Mediawiki project; or its use meets all the requirements of English Wikipedia's non-free content criteria (which are more restrictive than \"fair use\"), and it may be uploaded to English Wikipedia and used in an article.\n\nOne of the NFCC is that there is no possibility of obtaining a free image, so I'm afraid it is almost never acceptable to upload an image of a living person in that way. So the only way that you could use Amersi's image is by the \"free licence\" route. That would require the copyright holder (who is usually not the subject, unless it is a selfie, or it was taken under a contract which specifically assigns the copyright to the subject) to explicitly license it under CC-BY-SA: giving permission to use it on Wikipedia is not sufficienct. So you would need the photographer (probably) to follow the procedure in donating copyright materials, and then you could upload the picture to Commons, using the Upload wizard. It is tortuous, because copyright is such a tortuous issue. --ColinFine (talk)\n\nMany thanks for your superfast reply Colin! Seriously appreciated. Wow, yes this does sound like quite a process - which I kind of saw coming - but extremely helpful to now have such clear directions. So will first follow up with the photographer, and then follow through accordingly from there. All sounds doable. Thanks again! Julianross CSR (talk)\n\nI was about to put an entry into a well-known boxer's Wikipedia about an assault conviction then realised it might not be there at present because of the UK's Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. I've checked a couple of other actors who I know from older reportage have what are called 'spent' convictions and see they are not in their Wikipedia articles either. This seems fair enough, and there are legal reporting restrictions on spent convictions in the UK, but I wonder if that is a Wikipedia policy? On reflection, I might not put the spent convictions in anyway, but it'd be interesting and useful for the future to have a thought on the matter from someone more experienced. All the best Emmentalist (talk)\n\nHello Emmentalist. It's not part of policy, and most legal things are related to US law. The ROA article actually discusses the different UK and US positions in the 'libel' section (this is not legal advice). It also has to be said that on Wikipedia as in real life, the US has an unforgiving fixation with words such as 'felon' which UK articles do not. However two policies do spring to mind across the board: WP:BLP and WP:DUE, which basically say that it depends on context and should be proportionate (as well as impeccably sourced). In a lot of cases, minor convictions, or lists of convictions, are going to be disproportionate. For a boxer and an assault conviction? I couldn't say. -- (talk)\n\nThanks very much,zzuuzz. I've had a read of those references. I think it's probably best to go with common sense and proportion, as those policies and you suggest. In this case, I was looking at a boxer who'd been cleared of a serious offence and noticed that a minor actual one isn't mentioned. I think it's best left out; it' not pertinent to anything in any case. Thanks again, and all the best, Emmentalist (talk)\n\nHow do I add images to links?\n\nI'm trying to make my user page less barebones, and more attractive, so I want to add\n\n[[User Talk:QuickQuokka| [[File:Gnome User Speech.svg]] Talk]] [[Special:EmailUser/QuickQuokka| [[File:Mail-closed.svg]] Email]]\n\nto the top of my page, but it shows up as:\n\nUser Talk:QuickQuokka Special:EmailUser/QuickQuokka\n\nHow do I add an image as part of a hyperlink?

If you want to retain a version of it, copy it to your computer. In general, new editors (you) are strongly advised to follow directions at WP:YFA on how to create a draft and then submit the draft to Articles for Creation (AfC) for review.

I could upload a bunch, but as a not-quite-autoconfirmed editor I apparently ought not to upload non-free images. Also, I don't feel confident about following the directions in the File Upload Wizard regarding non-free requested images (placement in article, notification in Talk). Perhaps I should just upload them in the Commons and hope they are noticed? Or perhaps someone could walk me through the first one? Thanks in advance for your advice. Anne.erickson (talk)\n\n@Anne.erickson: Welcome to the Teahouse! Could you please provide a link to this list? Thanks! GoingBatty (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) Hi Anne.erickson. Unless you're fairly certain the the book covers would meet c:Commons:Licensing, I'd avoid uploading any such files to Commons. Commons doesn't accept fair use content of any type as explained here; so, such files are likely going to end up deleted (perhaps rather quickly) if the covers are clearly not within the public domain for some reason or can be soon to have been release under an acceptable free license by their copyright holders. Book covers, album covers, magazine covers, etc. can often be uploaded locally as non-free content for use in Wikipedia articles as per item 1 given here for certain types of uses. This generally means that the cover art is being used for primary identification purposes in the main infoboxes or at the tops of stand-alone articles about the works they represent; other types of uses or uses in other types of articles is much trickier to justify. So, if you feel you've found some book cover images that probably would satisfy Wikipedia's non-free content use policy but are a bit leery about uploading them yourself or can't quite do so just yet, you can always ask someone else for assistance at Wikipedia:Files for upload. -- Marchjuly (talk)\n\nI would like to ask for help regarding my page Dale A.

Howver, now that it is an article, your COI means that you should no longer edit the article directly, but instead recommend changes on the Talk page. David notMD (talk)\n\nYou're asking for \"help\"; what kind of help do you hope to get? I don't understand why a discussion at WP:COIN needs a mediator. If it's help with the content of the article, and if this person is notable by Wikipedia standards (which I doubt), then it's likely that the notability would be demonstrated by sources in Hungarian. I can't read Hungarian, and I imagine that most people reading this \"Teahouse\" page also cannot. -- Hoary (talk)\n\nDear Hoary, I'm hoping that someone would go through the article and see how much of the removed/changed parts were warranted to be removed. Thank you in advance! Pelicanegg (talk)\n\nI removed non notable trivial content for example being a member of the board of the German-Hungarian Chamber of Industry and Commerce is not something noteworthy, Wikipedia is not a CV hosting service. Theroadislong (talk)\n\nPelicanegg, the article, as it was before it was \"gutted\" (in your view), had a lot of material. A lot of this was, or appeared to be, supported by references in Hungarian. In principle, there's nothing wrong with either a lot of material or with Hungarian-language references; in practice, it's unlikely that you'll get anyone to go through all of these assertions/references. You might start by specifying the two deletions that, in your view, were the most egregious; and somebody here might comment on each of these. In line with what David Biddulph suggests below, name your top two not here but on Talk:Dale A.

LongJohn42 (talk)\n\nI have protected the article. If her name is out there in public sources it will be difficult to keep it out of the article, but in any event, it should be discussed. 331dot (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) Since the article has been protected now by 331dot, the best place to probably discuss this would be at Talk:CodeMiko. However, please keep in mind that things like WP:BLPPRIVACY apply to all pages; so, if content was removed for BLP concerns by other editors, then you probably will need to try and discuss it without specifically re-adding it to the talk page. Things like WP:BLPPRIVACY (and WP:BLPREMOVE) probably need to be dealt with extra carefully even when you may strongly feel they're not as applicable as others might think they are. If you start a talk page discussion about this and are unable to come to a resolution, then you can try to seek further input at WP:BLPN. Just for reference, WP:OTHERCONTENT existing doesn't necessary mean similar content should exist in this article; it could mean that the other content shouldn't also be there or that other things are being considered that don't apply equally to both articles. -- Marchjuly (talk)\n\nThe two or three editors (not LongJohn) who have been raising this issue, apparently have some COI in the matter, but have not made proper disclaimers or disclosure. --Orange Mike | Talk\n\nWhen you can go from draft to publication?.

On my mac laptop when I hover over James Semple with my mouse I just see text, however when I hover over a page like Elsah, Illinois I see text and an image along with it, if that helps clarify? It seems like there should be an image showing up for James Semple because the image is in the infobox, but for some reason it's not on my laptop. Thanks. Archivingperson (talk)\n\n@Archivingperson: that's bizarre. On my windows desktop, hovering over both of those titles gives images, displayed in just the same way (except the Semple one is taller due to portrait orientation). Looking at the coding, I can't see anything that would cause a difference. I just have one thought, and it's a long shot - try clearing the browser cache on your laptop. On a Windows machine this can be done by pressing the keys [Ctrl], [Shift] and [Del]. Not sure how to do it with an i-thing. Then I recommend closing the browser (all windows) and try again.--Gronk Oz (talk)\n\n@Gronk Oz: It looks good on my end now, even though I didn't do anything on my end until wait till the next morning.

Are you planning to gather a screenshot from that video as an infobox image for your draft article? If that is the case, I'm afraid you cannot do that because the video is not published under a CC-BY licence (see more here) and thus is non-free content. You may use such an image, accompanied by a fair use rationale, when you use it in an infobox in an article for a notable album or album track, but in this context I don't think that's acceptable. „Äú ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç elias. üß£ ‚Äç ‚Äç üí¨reach out to me!„Éªüìùsee my work!\n\nResmise, I invited you to describe the copyright status of the video. You haven't. I see nothing about it or its presentation that suggests that it's anything other than conventional (\"all rights reserved\") copyright. Therefore we must assume that this is its copyright status, and it may not be uploaded to Commons. Use of the image might be \"fair\" for an article on the particular pop song, but not for an article on the pop group, and not for any draft. (No non-free content can be used for any draft.) -- Hoary (talk)\n\n@Troubled.elias: and @Hoary:Ok!, I will think about uploading images later after completing the draft.

I am in contact with them, and as far as I can tell the citations in the rejected draft are from DietPi. Please forgive my newby ignorance. Dherkes (talk)\n\nDoes \"asked to help\" mean paid?\n\nSTATUS: Declined four times and resubmitted. Yes, many of the refs are to the company website or somehow connected, and need to be removed. Are there at least three references which are ABOUT the company? David notMD (talk)\n\nDherkes, Thank you for your candor. Your reward is please review WP:COI and WP:PAID. Then head over to guide to your first article and take a look at WP:GNG, WP:N and WP:RS.\n\nTo summarize all those links, certain disclosures are required when you have a relationship with an article subject and that the best way to get an article published is to have multiple independent reliable secondary sources discuss the subject. Wikipedia cares very little about what a subject has to say about itself and any publications from the subject or affiliates will not count towards notability, which determines if a page will be published. The rule of WP:THREE is a good start for any articleSlywriter (talk)\n\n(edit conflict) Hello, Dherkes, and welcome to the Teahouse. If you have been asked to help get Draft:DietPi published, then you certainly have a conflict of interest, and if this is in any way part of your job, then you are a paid editor. These do not prevent you working on the draft, but you need to be aware of the restrictions, and you should make appropriate declarations. (See the links I have provided). Wikipedia is not interested in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is only interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. So unless they can direct you to further independent sources, the developers have nothing to contribute to a Wikipedia article about their work. Please see WP:NSOFTWARE and WP:REFB. --ColinFine (talk)\n\nJust to be clear: I am not being paid, nor do I have any affiliation with DietPi except as an unpaid editor. I take it that I cannot use the company sourced web links? --dherkes ‚Äî Preceding unsigned comment added by Dherkes (talk ‚Ä¢ contribs)\n\n@Dherkes: For the most part, Wikipedia has no interest in what the company says about themselves. The article should be a summary of what independent, reliable sources have said about them. So start by gathering your sources - the books that have been written about them, the newspaper articles that covered them in detail (not just passing references), etc. Company websites can be used only in very limited ways, as described at WP:ABOUTSELF, but they do not contribute at all to showing their notability.--Gronk Oz (talk)\n\nHi, I am an avid fan of the book series The Storm Testament and I wanted to find some information on it, so I looked for the Wiki page and could not find it. I then saw some logs that looked like it might have been deleted and I feel like it deserves a page on Wikipedia. I would just like to know if there is any reason that it was deleted or if there is any way to make a page? I would be willing to help and I think it would be really awesome to have a Wiki page for someone who hears about the book and wants to know more, or if someone just needs informatiom from it. FrostyPosty (talk)\n\nHi FrostyPosty, welcome to the Teahouse, reasons for the deletion can be found in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Storm Testament, it seems that it's been deleted due to the subject failing our notability standards. If you think the article is now notable (see WP:GNG), then feel free to recreate it, but please first read through WP:1st as it provides instructions for new editors wanting to create articles. Please note that creating articles is one of the hardest things for a beginner to do, so consider choosing another task. Justiyaya\n\n(edit conflict) Hello, FrostyPosty. Please read Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Storm Testament, a discussion that took place over 14 years ago. As an administrator, I can read deleted articles and this one was terrible. It resembled a school book report written by a pre-teen who is about to flunk their class. Please read the Notability guideline for books. The most common way to establish that a book (or book series) is notable, is to provide references to independent, reliable sources that review the book in depth. Please read Your first article for information about your next steps. An important thing to keep in mind is that you need to set aside your \"avid fan\" frame of mind, and do no more than neutrally summarizing in your own words what reliable sources say about this series of books. Cullen328 (talk)\n\n@FrostyPosty: Hello! Looking at the corresponding \"articles for deletion\" (AFD) discussion on the topic, the reason why the page does not exist is because at the time, there were not enough reliable, independent sources about the book series. For a topic to warrant an article on Wikipedia, (1) multiple sources must directly discuss the topic of interest, (2) the sources in question must have a reputation for fact-checking, and (3) the sources must not be affiliated with the subject of the article to make sure pages follow the guidelines for neutral point of view. If you wish to write an article about the book series, please do keep these guidelines in mind, and read through WP:1ST to get a rundown of other important information!\n\nWhile I appreciate your willingness to contribute to Wikipedia by planning to make a new page, it can be a very arduous task for people only starting off here. You may try out any of the tasks from this page to slowly, but surely, build up experience and get an idea of what editing here is like. Have a good day! „Äú ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç elias. üß£ ‚Äç ‚Äç üí¨reach out to me!„Éªüìùsee my work!\n\nAs best I can tell, the 'Storm' book series is nine books published 1982-1996. If you want to write about the series, can you find three or more references that discuss the series? In some detail? References that confirm the books were published are not enough to establish notability of the series. As noted, for newbies to create articles is hard, as they are ignorant of Wikipedia's rules and guidelines. Creation success is more likely if you first learn by improving existing articles.

As a newbie here I have but one simple goal and that is to ensure that the details included in wiki are true and accurate. I think we can all agree on that for sure. I am finding it difficult to understand a couple of items. First, how does the wiki community define \"reliable published source (s)\" and secondly, how does first hand participant details (not previously published) ever make into this database. When a significant person, like a US president, writes his memoir of time in office, and raises matters not ever published before, are you saying that such information is not deemed credible? If so, all personal memoirs would be excluded. If you accept them as \"credible\" then you are simply picking who is and is not \"credible\" by a means of life importance. If former President Obama said something for the first time in his book - does that mean it is true? Because a well known book publisher prints millions of copies, does that also make the words of one man become \"credible\"? Is the New York Post more or less \"credible\" than the New York Times or Washington Post? Thus back to my point - what really is a \"reliable published source\" ? I look forward to more open discussion on this matter and hope ALL enter with an open mind. Thanks. AmIntelAgent32 (talk)\n\n@AmIntelAgent32: See WP:RS for what we consider reliable sources. Unpublished first hand accounts cannot be included. See WP:V, all information must be verifiable. See WP:TRUTH for more info. RudolfRed (talk)\n\nAmIntelAgent32 Many readers and new editors of Wikipedia find it surprising that the encyclopaedia values verifiability over truth but that's how it works. So first hand participant details (not previously published) are never appropriate for our articles because no published source can be cited and readers can't verify the \"facts\". However, once (ex)-president Obama publishes his memoir, then it can be cited because it is a source. Wikipedia doesn't claim what his memoir says is \"credible and/or true\", only that he stated it. Others reliable sources may back up what he says but if they contradict any of his statements then an article here can present both sides of the argument and let readers decide. That's why all our citations need to be able to be verified and be reliable. Mike Turnbull (talk)\n\n@AmIntelAgent32: In addition to the above, what source is considered reliable depends on the context. A source is considered reliable if there is reason to think it would report accurately on certain topics. For instance, the memoirs of Obama would be a good source for the sentence Obama‚Äôs preferred cook at the White House was Mrs. Jones, but not for the sentence Obama‚Äôs legislative agenda was stalled because Republicans were unreasonable and uncompromising (surely he would say that).\n\nFor instance, the New York Post that you mentioned above has been discussed enough times that it has an entry on our \"perennial sources\" list. That entry says that in general it is not a reliable source, in particular about politics / NYPD, but pre-1976 issues are fine.

Very apt here, I must say!\n\nThe templates you're referring to at the very bottom of the page are known as navboxes, and are designed to help users navigate their way to related topics. I think they're usually closed (collapsed) by default - especially the big, fat ones - and require the user to open (show) them. If I understand you correctly, you want to force them open at all times? Just for yourself, or for everyone? If the latter, I'd say that was not OK, especially for the larger navboxes. If the former, I'd suggest this might need some special script to do it for you on every page you visit. But each template does have its own state= command (collapsed/uncollapsed). So these could be switched, but I'd not advice that on the CIA page you linked to as they're far too big to be presented in their uncollapsed state. In contrast, article content shown in collapsible tables should always be shown uncollapsed by default, and simply give the reader the chance to hide (collapse) the table if they don't want all that expanded content to get in the way. You should probably read more in the documentation associated with each navbox type.

Sergecross73 msg me\n\nI plan to write an article about an algorithm called \"PH-Tree\". The [\"Your_first_article\" page] page suggest I should evaluate notability of the topic in the Teahouse.\n\nThe algorithm was originally published in a well known Conference (SIGMOD) in 2014 and has since been cited 55 times (Google Scholar). About 50 of those are independent citations.\n\nI have implemented the algorithm in Java, the implementation has been forked 17 times and liked 94 times (GitHub page), I think this is a lot for such a specialized algorithm.\n\nThere is an independent C++ implementation here (https://github.com/mcxme/phtree)\n\nThere is a new C++ implementation by Improbable Worlds here (https://github.com/improbable-eng/phtree-cpp). I was hired by this company specifically to support them in using this algorithm (though I am not affiliated with them any more).\n\nProbably irrelevant: I have also been contacted by two other developers who are working on open-source implementations in other programming languages: Python and C#, but I cannot make this public just yet without their consent.\n\nConsidering that this field is rather specific, I think these references would qualify a Wiki site about the algorithm as \"notable\". What do people here think? TilmannZ (talk)\n\n@TilmannZ Welcome to the Teahouse, and many thanks for coming to ask your question here first. When we talk about Notability we mean to ask the question \"Has the world at large taken notice of this thing, and has it been written about in detail and in depth by independent sources? If so, what are they?\" Whilst technical computing matters are way outside my area of knowledge, I'm afraid I don't see anything in the links you've supplied to show me anything more that something exists and that a few people like it, and have mentioned it in places. The key to answer your question is \"does it meet WP:NSOFTWARE, and I don't think those sources get me anywhere near concluding that it does. Has someone else written a book about it, for example? Or has it taken the world y storm and has it been written about in detail in computing magazine? I fear that, by it's very nature, it may not meet that criterion until it someone does. You might find further advice at WP:WikiProject Computing, but I fear your hopes for a page about it here might not come to fruition. Maybe is it simply WP:TOOSOON? Nick Moyes (talk)\n\n@Nick Moyes Thanks for the feedback and suggestions. I think these criteria may be very difficult to meet.\n\nBooks and magazines: I think the last book in this area was published in 2006, and since this area (multidimensional indexing) is not as \"flashy\" (excuse my language) as other algorithms such as Blockchain or Cryptography, there may not soon be a new book. Actually, in computer science most knowledge is nowadays online, i.e. books are somewhat unfashionable and there may not ever again be a book in that field. The same is true for magazines, I am a professional in computer science and I haven't read a magazine in probably a decade. The last book I bought myself was actually the one from 2006.\n\nScientific references on Google Scholar: Most of those are peer-reviewed, i.e. they have been counter-checked by academic professionals and been considered worthy of publishing in Journals or Conferences. Yes, some of the mention the PH-Tree only in passing, but some actually look at the algorithm in depth. I think these references/citations may be the closest thing to a \"book\" that can happen.\n\nWide interest in the topic? I am afraid the world at large will probably never be interested in this. While the algorithm can be important for things that are widely used like Computer Games, Maps (such as Google Maps or OSM) or AI (artificial intelligence), it will never be known outside the computer science world. However, there are already 10+ very similar algorithms described in Wikipedia (basically everything listed [[1]]), so despite being a very specific field that most people will never be interested in, this is an important field in today's technology and well represented on Wikipedia.\n\nGitHub Forks: Just for reference, a \"fork\" typically means that someone plans to adapt it. Adapting this type of code typically takes weeks or months to do so I suspect they they are quite convinced that the algorithm is worth their while.\n\nI looked at WP:NSOFTWARE, specifically the \"Scope\" and I don't think it is applicable. The \"PH-Tree\" is not a software or computer program (and is not associated with a company). It is an algorithm that everybody can use/program in their programs/software if they want. Maybe as an example: this is similar to Bitcoin being a software/implementations and Blockchain being the underlying algorithm.\n\nSo I have some more questions:\n\nSince most of the 50 citations have probably been published in Journals or Conference Proceedings, they probably have a ISBN and are available as printed books. I think that means they count as books?\n\nDo you think it is maybe worthwhile trying to contact one of the Wikipedia editors in the Computer Science area to get their take on notability?\n\nHello, TilmannZ. I don't think the issue is with what kind of publication the references are in (reputable journals are fine as sources) but whether they give significant coverage. Normally, \"passing mentions\" are not adequate, but I'm aware that for articles on academics citations are counted: I don't know much about this, and whether these different criteria might apply here. I think it would be a very good idea to ask at WikiProject Computer science. --ColinFine (talk)\n\nThanks @Nick Moyes and @ColinFine for your help.

The song was illicit, underground, never published anywhere. Soviet copyright law starts in effect with the creation of a work, though under Soviet copyright law in either the 1925 or 1928 laws it would now be out of copyright (the song's date is not known exactly but thought to be from the late 20s). Soviet Copyright law from this period also guaranteed the right to translation.\n\nIf you look at The Song of the Volga Boatmen, a Russian folk song with no recorded author, the WP article reproduces the lyrics in full, along with a transliteration and two English translations. The lyrics section cites no sources for the original, the transliteration, or either translation; as such, all of those are either copy-pasted from some source and not cited or (it seems to me) constitute original research. I'm not very familiar with WP's translation policy, particularly of works in the public domain.\n\nMy question is thus, how can I include the lyrics of the song I'm writing about? I have in my possession the seminal source about Soviet popular music, which features the Russian lyrics and the translation. I'd like to include both and cite that source. However, doing so would be copy-pasting, which is against policy. If I instead include just the Russian lyrics and do my own translation, would that not amount to original research? If I include the Russian lyrics, would I not have to cite them? Would it be best to just not include the lyrics at all? The Russian version of the article I'm writing features lyrics in a lyrics section and cites a source for those lyrics; however, they seem to be copy-pasted from that source. The German version of that article does not feature lyrics.\n\nApologies if I made any incorrect assumptions; I'm still fairly new to WP. Lkb335 (talk)\n\nLkb335, copying public-domain material is allowed, though the status of unpublished material can be complicated. The translation would usually have additional copyright as a derivative work (depends on the jurisdiction of the translator, not the original). What happens if your own translation ends up almost identical to the other? I don't know. ‚Åì Pelagic ( messages )\n\nwhy does everything i post to Wiki get deleted? even when i provide COPIOUS sources i just get told i didn't provide any sources and my work is deleted. every single time. it's worthless to participate.

GoingBatty (talk)\n\nStripping (linguistics) ¬ß Not-stripping states that\n\n[...] the ellipsis analysis of not-gapping is the only plausible analysis.\n\nMy immediate gut reaction was that such statements are innately unencyclopedic, no matter what the subject matter and how reliable the source is. I couldn't quite put my finger on why, though. Having now gone through the 83 search results for \"only plausible\", I think it's because it's a bit of a corner case.\n\nOn the one hand, for one option to be \"the only\", every other option must have been ruled out. That's not necessarily problematic, of course: \"The emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica\" makes sense, as the number of penguin species is quite small, so ruling out the rest is quite straightforward - in principle, anyway. But it can be problematic, especially for immaterial things like \"analyses\", which are potentially innumerable. Subject matter expert or not, how could anyone ever be certain that there do not exist other analyses that would qualify, yet simply have not occurred to them?\n\nOn the other hand, \"plausible\" is a way more subjective criterion than the likes of \"during the winter\" and \"in Antarctica\". Its use may still be fine in a scientific publication, but only because in that context it will be implicitly read as \"plausible in our, the authors', estimation\". Which doesn't work in an encyclopedia article, however.\n\nEither issue can be easily addressed, of course. Here's an occurrence in a footnote in another article that accomplishes both by softening \"is\" to \"would seem to be\":\n\nThe only plausible explanation would seem to be that suggested above for our Temple inscription, i.e. that it was placed inconspicuously, and therefore no one cared.\n\nThis simultaenously acknowledges that other plausible explanations may have been missed, and that plausibility is somewhat in the eye of the beholder. Plus, the entire footnote is attributed, so even an \"is\" would work here. The instigating occurrence, as well as a handful of others from the search, fail to do any of that, though.\n\nOr am I being too demanding?\n\n- 2A02:560:42D2:CE00:81B4:4813:CBCE:5025 (talk)\n\nWelcome to the Teahouse, IP editor.

Wonder if they just recently enabled that notification or if there was a bug that caused it to get sent out again to all eligible users. ‚Äï Blaze WolfTalkBlaze Wolf#6545\n\nBased on the eligibility criteria stated by Mike Turnbull, I seem to have been eligible for a long time, odd that I have only just received the message, but I am still happy for it! Anyways, I am just waiting for a response from Mr. Walton for my other questions, hopefully this doesn't get archived. Thanks again everyone, RandomEditorAAA (talk)\n\nI believe it started getting sent out to all editors at 3,000 edits or more. I got my notification immediately upon getting my 3,000th edit. It doesn't check whether you have it or not already. Skarmory (talk ‚Ä¢ contribs)\n\nHi RandomEditorAAA :) Nothing nefarious going on here, just free stuff for active editors! In terms of personal data, by default when you login the only people who can see your email address or other information you input are Wikimedia Foundation staff (and even so there are only like 5 of us with access). If you file an application for certain content, then specific volunteer contributors might also be able to see this information. These volunteers are all active community members, have been vetted by us, and have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements to ensure the privacy of your data. And yes, to the broader point about this notification, we've been rolling it out in waves of decreasing edit count, including to users who were already using the library. You can track progress in T288070. Samwalton9 (WMF) (talk)\n\nHello Sam Walton, thank you for your helpful response, I will now make a Wikipedia Library account. Thank you! - RandomEditorAAA (talk)\n\nRandomEditorAAA, Several friends ask me, \"Does Wikipedia pay you for your works and contributions that you make?\" I just say, \"I've got instant access of over 30 libraries including the Cambridge, JSTOR, and the Edinburgh; and this is very much for a student like me.\" Enjoy with all of those resources, improve the encyclopedia and gain more and more knowledge. TWL is something I'm proud of, among several other things on this platform. ‚îÄ The Aafƒ´ (talk)\n\nRandomEditorAAA, the notifications are now described in the Books and Bytes newsletter m:The Wikipedia Library/Newsletter/November-December 2021 ‚Åì Pelagic ( messages )\n\nHey there! Just seeing if a mod would be willing to look over my edit request for the ACORD page. It was recommended by one editor that I seek out another editor for review. Thank you! Morrissey35 (talk)\n\nIt seems that Panini! has now done it, Morrissey35. (Please correct me if I misunderstand.) -- Hoary (talk)\n\nWhat do you do when you've started a draft and then while you're working on the draft someone else creates a page in mainspace for the same thing? I've had it happen a couple of times, but I just noticed that Kai Wright recently had a page created when I had started a draft at Draft:Kai Wright. TipsyElephant (talk) 03:16, 4 February 2022 (UTC) TipsyElephant (talk) 03:16, 4 February 2022 (UTC) I didn't have much more than an outline, but I figured it be nice to know for future reference. TipsyElephant (talk)\n\n@TipsyElephant you may want to read Ownership of content. The person who wrote Kai Wright does not own the article and, as long as you have good references, you can improve / expand the article with additional, verified, information. Make sure you add edit summaries to explain the changes you have made. Best wishes on your Wikipedia work. Karenthewriter (talk)\n\nFrom the \"Hey! I was first!\" angle, there's no specific rights. It is polite to check for existing drafts first and consider cooperation if the drafter seems active, but we can't expect all people to know/think about that. Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng (talk)\n\nBtw, that article seems to have a problem with many sources not being independent. I wonder if there's some COI involved. Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng (talk)\n\n@Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng: it's possible, but I think it's more likely that there just aren't many independent sources. I'm not sure it matters too much though because I believe Wright passes WP:NENTERTAINER for being the host of multiple notable radio shows and podcasts. TipsyElephant (talk)\n\nFair enough. Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng (talk)\n\nHello, my page was moved into the draftspace. I think it is fairly important as it is the highest state honour which Hungary awards. I feel like it is cited and written well... Any help would be appreciated! Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Hungarian_Order_of_Saint_Stephen Pelicanegg (talk)\n\nhi Pelicanegg and welcome to the teahouse! since it seems like the page hasn't been denied yet, you may keep working on the page and improving it for now while waiting for an article review, although for now, moving it directly from draft to article space without going through the review process is discouraged. happy editing! melecie t -\n\nHi Melecie, thank you! But I find it has been unfairly moved to the draftspace. Could a third-party properly review the page? Also a similar thing happened to my other page. Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Dale_A._Martin Thank you in advance! :) ‚Äî Preceding unsigned comment added by Pelicanegg (talk ‚Ä¢ contribs)\n\nBearcat, would you be able to comment on why you moved the article to draft-space? The template-comments added on draftification include the sentences \"Do not resubmit this draft without addressing the comments of the previous reviewer. If you do not understand why this article was sent back to draft space, ask the reviewer rather than simply resubmitting\". It is very hard for an editor to address the issues if there aren't any obvious comments to address. Having looked at the article and checked, admittedly just one, of the references, nothing leaps out as obviously appalling about the article, so I can understand Pelicanegg's need for help on this. Elemimele (talk)\n\nIn regards to the second article they mentioned, it appears that Onel5969 has requested that Pelicanegg clear up the question about a potential connection or COI with the subject. The draft says that @Pelicanegg has declared a connection but I don't see where that occurred. Regardless, that shouldn't keep an article from being moved from draft to main space if the sources check out. Having a COI and creating an article about the subject with which you have a COI is not against policy. Disclosing your COI is required but that's not a content issue. Hopefully these two reviewers can clear up this and give the editor solid reasons beyond what I see right now. --ARoseWolf\n\nIt's really quite simple: you are not entitled to bypass the AFC process by submitting a draft to the AFC queue for review and then immediately moving it into mainspace yourself just one minute later with the AFC review template still on it: once you submit it to the AFC queue for review, you have to wait for it to be reviewed and processed by the AFC queue reviewers. Nobody's saying it can never have an article, but you have to respect and follow the proper process, and the process does not allow you to just arbitrarily move the page into mainspace yourself while it's still waiting for review. Bearcat (talk)\n\nBearcat, do I have to wait for other reviewers or can I just take the AFC template off? With this much energy it makes more sense to review the page rather than move it here and there... Thank you in advance :)\n\n@Pelicanegg: you are not obliged to use the AfC process at all. It can be a good idea to do so, because the reviewers may make helpful comments. But it was set up such that unconfirmed and unregistered users could continue to submit articles indirectly, after they were prevented from doing so directly in main-space following some problematic incidents. If you physically can place an article directly in main-space, you are entitled to do so. It won't be listed on Google until it has been approved by a new page reviewer, or until 30 (I always get this wrong!??) days are up. As for removing the template, see below. Elemimele (talk)\n\n@Bearcat:, I believe you are mistaken in this, but would welcome input from a more experienced editor. AfC is a project, set up by someone to help those who needed help. It's only a project, not a rule, and if you look at its project page, you will find that while there are instructions for reviewers, there are no instructions for those who submit an article. Also please note that it is described as a \"Peer review\" process, which implies that the editors doing the reviewing are equals of those whose articles are being reviewed, not superior gate-keepers. That is the meaning of the word Peer. There are also no instructions on the \"pending\" template telling the author not to remove the template. Articles that have been rejected at AfC do indeed regularly get moved to main-space, and then often turn up at AfD. Remember, AfD is actually the final test, not AfC: the criteria at AfC are basically \"accept if you think AfD won't delete it again\", but it is consensus at AfD that matters, not the individual views of the AfC (peer) reviewer. It's unhelpful if people remove their AfC tag, but I'm not sure if it's against any rule? Elemimele (talk)\n\nWhat I was more concerned about is the mixed messaging that is given. We told this editor that they shouldn't circumvent the process and that's why this article was draftified, however, in the comments we told them that they should not resubmit until they had addressed the issues laid out by the reviewer that draftified the article. In the same comment we told them that they needed to improve the article before resubmitting or risk it being rejected and/or deleted. From what I see here the article wasn't draftified due to a content issue but due to a perceived procedural issue. And if @Bearcat reverted the article to draft status for the reason they stated which is evidenced by the edit summary then what is there to address and why shouldn't they resubmit immediately? I don't think it's correct to chastise this editor for being confused when the directions given are very confusing. --ARoseWolf\n\nNobody removed the AFC tag from the article. The page was moved to mainspace with the pending AFC review template left on it. And as for allowing page creators to submit drafts for AFC review and then immediately move the page themselves, keep in mind that doing that defeats the entire purpose of AFC, because if every editor is given free rein to do that and no edit actually has to wait for review, then what the hell else is the point of having AFC review at all? Lots of rules get broken around here all the time, but it doesn't mean they aren't still rules. Bearcat (talk)\n\nI'm inclined to agree with ARoseWolf that the current process for AfC gives very mixed messages. Since AfC isn't compulsory, there really need to be explicit instructions on how to withdraw from it in an orderly fashion. It was reasonable for Pelicanegg to take a look at the review-queue and decide they didn't want to wait; the best thing would probably be for the AfC template to contain instructions, such as \"if you choose to go it alone, without AfC, please remove this template before you move a new article to main-space\". This lack of definition obviously put Bearcat in a difficult position of having to decide whether something was a rule or not, and if so, how to deal with it. I shall ask someone at AfC! Elemimele (talk)\n\nWe simply can't tell editors that \"withdrawing their work from AFC\" is a choice they're allowed to make. If we give them language indicating that they're allowed to do that, then every editor will always do that, and the entire purpose of the AFC process will have been disembowelled because nobody will ever actually follow it anymore. The entire purpose of AFC requires that the process is respected and followed, and the entire process is completely pointless if new editors are always free to just exempt themselves from it at will. Bearcat (talk)\n\nWe already tell editors when they no longer have to use the AfC process. I have seen discussions where it was suggested editors avoid the process altogether. I'm not of that opinion but I understand the frustration. Twice now I've been involved in helping to eliminate some number of backlogged requests. I'm not a reviewer and I believe reviewers are amazing and do a great service for the encyclopedia but AfC should not be gatekeeping. It should be there to help guide editors through the process of creating drafts and improving their editing skills in article creation by offering them peer reviewed suggestions/comments. As pointed out it is not compulsory meaning not every editor is required to submit their draft for review. By saying they are bound to the process sends mixed messages to editors and only serves the purpose of having editors mistrust the process rather than embrace it. A clearly defined set of instructions, as defined by @Elemimele, for those editors which qualify would be an important step for showing the true purpose of the AfC process. I personally don't want to see the AfC process removed or diminished in importance but, in my opinion, more harm has come to the process by reverting this article than would have done so otherwise. This editor and many others that see this are less likely to use the process going forward because of it and that is a net loss. --ARoseWolf\n\nThe process has no value or purpose at all if everybody who uses it is free to pull their own work back out of it by their own personal discretion after the fact. It has no value or purpose at all if editors are allowed to short-circuit it by submitting their draft for review but then immediately moving it into mainspace themselves the moment they've unlocked the page-move privilege. It has no value or purpose at all if nobody ever actually has to follow it.\n\nIt's true that AFC isn't mandatory for all editors ‚Äî established editors don't have to use it, for example ‚Äî but it certainly is mandatory for new editors. And if an editor isn't new and doesn't need to use the AFC process, then they also automatically have the userspace sandbox option. So an established editor should be using userspace instead of draftspace to sandbox articles that need time to be worked on, because the core point of draftspace is to guide new editors through the Wikipedia process. So there's no need to create a new path for people to exempt themselves from the AFC process, because established editors already have alternatives to the AFC process. If you don't need to use the AFC process, then start your incomplete articles in userspace instead of draftspace ‚Äî but if you do use the AFC process, then you should respect the AFC process.\n\nSo, in reality, this is a \"user education\" issue ‚Äî be better at teaching people that if they don't have to use AFC, then they can and should use their own userspace ‚Äî much more than an \"AFC should relax the rules\" issue, because AFC has no purpose at all if everybody's free to bypass the process at their own personal discretion. Bearcat (talk)\n\nMy point is nothing suggested about this entire situation was guidance. It was gatekeeping to preserve a process that isn't mandatory and no comment or edit summary offered any guiding principles clearly defined outside of your own personal view of the process itself. No policy was linked. No loc"
