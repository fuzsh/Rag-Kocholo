        "text": "So, this week was a big week for many reasons. We have built a business up over the last 32 years with a simple purpose 'to inspire and serve chefs in every kitchen'. Our role is to help forage and find the very best products from across the Mediterranean and Middle-East'. It's a role we take seriously. For us we don't set out to be an award-winning business but it's humbling when we do win awards. It's because, it's not just us saying we source, make and sell great products. It's independent verification. Anyone who deals with us knows we are a super passionate team who love food and sharing that passion with others. When this product first was tasted in our 'Pembury innovation kitchen' a while back, we knew we had a winner. Everyone in the kitchen, everyone in the office, everyone in the car park was talking about how good it was. Have you tasted the sour cherry molasses? It's unbelievable(!!) was most people's reaction and it has just continued to 'dance' around peoples mouths and on alot of our dishes ever since. We recently were informed by the lovely people at the Guild of Fine Food that we had won 3 great taste stars (the highest score), which in itself is an exceptional achievement. As a consequence, that meant we had a chance of winning the 'Golden fork'. Which in simple terms is like winning best actor/actress at the Oscars, a lifetime goal. The best of the best three star products. On Monday night this week, that became a reality! In the pic below is Bob (our product guru) and Alice (our PR manager) from our team with the prize, in front of some canape's we prepared (I think) - Medjool dates, filled with sour cherry molasses and mascarpone dipped in chocolate. If that's a little too adventurous (for me being a simple boy from Northern Ireland) then drizzled over Vanilla ice-cream works equally well (I was always taught less is more). If you haven't tried it the message is simple, you must. We are already on with continuing our search to bring you many more wonderful products. Thanks for all you support and to the epic team Belazu | B Corp‚Ñ¢ - delighted to be part of it üôè\n\nMeet Tony Vernon, Cordata Grocery Manager and Staff Board Director!‚Å† ‚Å† His Co-op experience:‚Å† ‚Å† Tony has been a Co-op member for 25 years and has worked at the Community Food Co-op for three. ‚Å†He has always believed in the Co-op's values and products, and decided to pursue that in his career as well. He also noted that people will always need food, making grocery a stable industry. ‚Å† The values of the Co-op were the biggest reason for his career switch, though. ‚Å† \"Those values are community, sustainability, and high-quality products. Both the community of our stores and the community that we serve.\" With a love for our products‚Å† as well as our values, Tony is currently serving as the Staff Board Director. \"It‚Äôs been helpful to learn the parliamentary procedures and I am deeply invested in the Co-op‚Äôs success,\" he said. \"I can contribute more with the more information I have. The more I understand, the more I can ask meaningful questions and push us in new directions.\" Tony has a sweet spot for our wine department. Prior to working at the Co-op he spent 16 years in wine, beer, and spirits retail, wholesale, and production. ‚Å† His wine recommendations: We currently have both still and sparkling Elbling wines, made from a German white grape.‚Å† Tony says either variety is great! Additionally, it's almost ros√© season! Keep an eye out for a wide variety of ros√©s. #FoodCoop #SupportLocal #Wine #EmployeeRecognition\n\nMy oldest memories of \"fast food\" are being taken to Burger King by the Jewish neighbors... only later I learned where the meat and cheese, and their level of belief was - for me, as a kid, it was the best. Feeding it to me as a treat, set me and millions in later life, for obesity, a sad outcome, and one where now I've lost 195 lbs :) Eating #Akua Kelp Burgers, I'm healthy and happy vs. Fast Food. Did the math with the kiddo (hoping he'll turn into an MBA ;) and realized how many burgers they would have to sell, that even with the upsales, and so forth, meant there was no way they could be profitable without hundreds of visits based on a low average purchase price for a meal - for the money he was spending, they'd need 1000+ visits in a day. They could NOT supply 200/300 meals in the key time windows. For him, we also looked at the personal costs, packing your own lunch - planning ahead, which is also the secret to weight loss - was going to be adopted all over - lunch boxes will be a thing again.... (Writer has it 100% wrong, New Delhi is FAR less likely to have a BEEF burger - we'll see if healthy choices (myself), or rising costs passed on to customers, were also a factor, or were they just outmatched by others?) Customer service - the market is open to buying elsewhere, and if sales drop, harder to retain talent, which becomes a wicked downward cycle... Quality - I want to know I'm going to get good food - now replaced by the online Review system, most of us would rather support a local place, which not having to pay a franchise fee (think Chick-fil-a, as well as private places...) and being forced to source product from the mother Corp... the benefits of ads, vs. becoming a known, trusted location - No one wants waiting in long long lines, and the food hasn't been fast in a long time. I loved Boston Market, & remember RAX - en.wikipedia.org Rax_Roast_Beef - they tried in the 1980's, and people want to know what they will get each time - certainty. Price yourself out of a market, fail to provide the one key element - HOT FOOD - vs. the WAWA model seems most likely to win over a food only model, a small store with food, and fuel, vs. a drive in squeezed to take in so many people, and leading only to frustration for people who buy the unhealthy food on offer. WAWA has it all, static food which can be picked off the shelf and taken away rapidly-effects of smart phone use, less patience - as well as food ordered without human contact, removing the process down to it's most basic. Publix, is not there yet - I'd placed an online order and they completely messed it up - they are not ready for the volume online can bring - and didn't staff nearly enough to meet a common sense busy time on a Friday evening... Online ordering sounds great, however... if you can't deliver at Amazon level standards, and fall back on being open 24 hours.... it's not going to end well.\n\nNext Monday, you‚Äôll be on the 2nd day of October. Have you made plans to closeout 2023 very strong? My recommendation: Start yesterday. If you already haven‚Äôt made plans to do your very, VERY best work as you close this year ‚Äî there‚Äôs still time. And if you do, it‚Äôll springboard you into 2024. Yet it starts to slip away quickly next Monday ‚Äî as October will already be upon us. Can you define your road through the woods? This week bear down with everything you have as you‚Äôll have 13 weeks to finish strong for 2023. You can do this or you can‚Äôt ‚Äî it‚Äôs on you. Period. Simply ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to beat a person who never gives up.‚Äù ‚Äî Babe Ruth ‚öæÔ∏è Will you give up? Or will you choose to win?
