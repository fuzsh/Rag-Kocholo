Edsel are reissuing all the Arista albums of British singer-songwriter Lisa Stansfield this October.

Each of the five albums, Affection (1989), Real Love (1991), So Natural (1993), Lisa Stansfield (1997) and Face Up (2001), will be issued individually as 2CD+DVD casebound book deluxe editions which will feature the remastered album, rare tracks, remixes plus videos, live footage, specially recorded interview with Lisa. The booklet for each release will boast 28-pages of photos, memorabilia, lyrics and brand new sleeve notes.

Accompanying the album reissues will be a brand new remix compilation. People Hold On… The Remix Anthology is a three-CD set that will contain over thirty rare and previously unheard full-length mixes.

All 18 discs that make up these six releases (13CDs and 5DVDs) are brought together for a special The Collection 1989-2003 box set that is available via both the Official Lisa Stansfield Online Store as well as Amazon UK (a purchasing option if you’re in the US).

The official store offers an attractive incentive, since you get a free signed bonus 12-inch single called Classic Lisa that contains the Frankie Knuckles Mix of Change together with the late DJ’s previously unreleased Classic Club Mix of Never, Never Gonna Give You Up.

No track listings as yet, but we’ve been promised them very soon. Each individual title is currently under £15, emphasising how off the mark the Kylie Minogue sets are in terms of pricing. The Lisa Stansfield box set and the individual releases will be released on 20 October 2014.
