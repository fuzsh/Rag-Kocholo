Ia m pleased to say that barring Yeovil Town drawing Brighton in the quarter finals of the FA cup (away) I have visited this abomination of a football ground for the last time.

No more evil stewards, no more binoculars to view the football, no more plastic ponchos as a feeble protection against the West Sussex thunderstorms- hurrah!

No more ridiculous anit-smoking regulations, no more non-existent program sellers , no more Withdean– hurrah- next year- in the unlikely event that YTFC and Brighton are in the same division, we will enjoy the brand spanking new 22,000 capacity stadium up the road.

As the sign on the stand at the Withdean says-

Hello Amex-goodbye Withdean!

Or maybe I’ll take the advice of the Albion fans who amusingly taunted us with

You’re only here for the nightlife

Then again, maybe I’ll give the Brighton thing a miss for the foreseeable.

For the record, we lost 2-0 to a good team.
