The family of Stansfield, or Stansfeld as anciently written, trace their descent from one of the companions-in-arms of William the Conqueror, who obtained the grant of the lordship of Stansfeld. His descendants have remained ever since enjoying high respectability in the county of York, and their ancient residence, Stansfield Hall, in still to be seen in the once beautiful valley of Todmorden.

Candidates Work List

This is my working list of candidates to include -- I'm not yet sure if they are related to me! As candidates are eliminated (proven not related) they are marked appropriately (THUS) and an explanation included. They are kept in the list in case future research proves they can be included. (And to keep them from popping up on the list again!) Never discard good research!

Proven candidates' names are marked with an asterisk (*) until they can be added to the database.
