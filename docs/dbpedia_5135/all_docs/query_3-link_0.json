        "text": "Shakespeare writes in a combination of prose and verse. Verse is like poetry and it has a set structure and rhythm. The rhythm Shakespeare uses in his plays is called iambic pentameter, which is like a heartbeat, with one soft beat and one strong beat repeated five times. Sometimes it’s also interesting to look at lines that don’t match the rhythm of iambic pentameter and to think about why.\n\nIn Shakespeare’s plays, you will find examples of antithesis, which is when two opposites are put together, like hot and cold or light and dark. Characters also often end speeches with rhyming couplets, which are two lines written in iambic pentameter that end in the same sound, or a rhyme.\n\nTeacher Notes\n\nMore Info\n\nThe quick test on this page can be used in class to help students recall information about key language terms.\n\nYou may also want to use some of the activities in the videos on this page to help you explore different aspects of language with your students."
