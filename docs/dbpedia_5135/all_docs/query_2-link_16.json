        "text": "Just stumbled upon this article. It’s rather short, but it addresses what I’ve been thinking lately about conscious Vs unconscious language learning.\n\nI’m becoming more and more convinced that sound recognition is key, not word/sentence structure recognition.\n\nI feel like languages are made up of a series of lots of common blocks (that follow regular patterns) of sound. As native speakers, we don’t really hear the words being spoken, or even notice them, but rather the sounds they make in combination. That’s why, as native speakers, we instantly notice when someone says something incorrectly, no matter how subtle. It’s like a pianist striking the wrong key.\n\nDuring my immersion, I’ve been trying to move away (it’s very hard to do this for a lot of us) from analysing what I hear, but instead to just hear the sounds and infer meaning.\n\nI catch myself doing this at times, before my adult, analytical brain takes over once more. I’m at the stage where I can hear pieces of my TL and understand it, without really knowing exactly what words were used. My thinking is that if that’s even possible - and it is - then surely it’s a huge clue that sound recognition is the key to acquistion, and any form of analysis is potentially useless (in the big picture).\n\nI’ve also noticed that the faster I read the more overall understanding I get from each sentence. When I read slowly, paying close attention in an attempt to analyse the language, my ability to infer overall meaning is reduced.\n\nThe difficult thing is to get your brain to stop immeditately switching to ‘analytical mode’ each and every time it detects TL.\n\nAs a sidenote, the more level-appropriate content I consume, the more I’m able to shut off the analytical brain, which would fall in line with what Krashen’s ‘comprehensible input’ theory tells us.\n\nAnyway, I hope I’m making sense. Here’s the article:\n\nYes, sound is the base but we have messed up a lot with grammar since the beginning, because we didn’t understand and we still don’t understand, how people really communicate. Otherwise our books and methods would be totally different (Imho). And we wouldn’t have thousands of exceptions to rules that don’t make sense and that we keep perpetuating because we just like to do so (ironic!).\n\nBut now we have to deal with the structure of the language we have created on the top of the sound foundation we had.\n\nAt the end, the goal would be to reach that point where you understand that that particularly word “doesn’t sound right”, that sentence “probably is not good”, the orthography is not correct “because something is wrong”.\n\nYou start to have that connection with the language that you can’t explain but you start to “feel” the language. Both in sound and in writing.\n\nSo probably now we need to feed a double beast: the connection with the sound and the connection with the structure we have created.\n\nAnd each time you learn a new language or you are at that breaking point, all other languages start to shatter and you lose certainty on many things, until your brain integrate everything and magically create an entire integration of all.\n\nEDIT: I’ve just answer because I feel a Tired Adult!\n\nI have the same experience as you, @helion, and I’m certain we’re not unique. I will often prefer listening over reading (sometimes at enhanced speeds) to more easily ingest certain content. And like you, when “in the groove”, won’t hear individual words but absorb the meaning. Of course, my target language is different than many in that it uses a different alphabet which also slows me down even though I know it very, very well. i just can’t scan it like I can English or others in the Latin alphabet.\n\nIt’s very interesting to see young children acquire language. My oldest started speaking with grammatically correct full sentences almost from the beginning. My wife was concerned when his younger sister started speaking very poorly, but was reassured that she was the “normal” one. Her pronunciation was also very poor, but her brother could “interpret” for us when we couldn’t understand her.\n\nNow I have two young granddaughters. Their progression is very interesting, and since I don’t see them every single day their advances are perhaps more noticeable. The younger of the two is the more verbal. She started babbling to herself in very conversational tones, imitating full sentences, well before she was 2. I find that very interesting, and it is perhaps germane to your ideas. But I’m no developmental psychologist.\n\nK so I’m just gonna shoot some armchair philosophy from the hip here…\n\nTLDR: If you want to avoid the bar-room long spiel below, I agree with you: sound is the thing for building up a subconscious language specific language module in your brain.\n\nMy personal theory is that humans are optimized for learning languages by listening/speaking and that since reading/writing is less than 4,000 years old, those of us who are good at learning from reading/writing are in fact co-opting an entirely different system to be used in the service of language learning. One that not everyone has.\n\nAdditionally to that I think we develop separate language centers when we cross the threshold of fluency: a language center is a subconsciou module if you will that doesn’t include translation: the sounds of the words just hit the language center and you know what the meaning is without having to relate it back to your native language (in this case English).\n\nI’m already there with Spanish. There are words in my language center that I have learned within Spanish that I didn’t learn by means of English. I have to think about it to translate to English but I just know what it means in Spanish. For example “me caes gordo” translates as “to me you fall fat”. Doesn’t make much sense in English but in Spanish the correct translation is “you annoy me”. There are also words in Spanish that I have connected somehow right back to my internal representation of meaning which I got from my initial/original exposure to the concept when learning English. For example: for me a “pot” is a black pot with a black handle, mid-size and a “dog” is a medium-large size dog: those are my personal concepts of those two things.\n\nI think as you say, it’s repeated exposure to the sounds of the language over time. I think that is what builds up the subconscious language center.\n\nThe crux is, however, it has to build up gradually from smaller chunks.\n\nThat’s why TPRS works.\n\nI surmise therefore that if there was a way to do TPRS all the way up with every single word/phrase explained in the language then that would be the natural way to go.\n\nAnyhow, that was a ramble, TLDR I agree with you.\n\nThe observation that you have to get auditory processing happening in order to develop capacity with a language is valid enough, but I don’t think we should construct an (ideo)logical opposition between auditory and visual modes of representation. Having a mapping between multiple modalities - the auditory and visual modalities - can be helpful in bootstrapping consciousness. That’s why (I think) reading while listening helps. You have an extra modality to use to make meaning out of the auditory stimulus.\n\nWhile I was typing this out my four-year old came up to me with a long strong of letters he just wrote, spelling an unbroken series of nonsense-words, and asked me to “read” it. We both found it hilarious. What does this say about how children learn language? How quickly in development can “non-ancestral” modes of language acquisition help? Do children start engaging analytical-like modes of information processing before they can reflective grasp what they are doing, and therefore communicate it to us in adult-friendly ways? I don’t know. Maybe scientists know. Maybe they don’t.\n\nI am a musician and so an analogy between music theory and grammar (understood as all reflective, non auditory, non “ancestral” processing of linguistic information) comes quickly to mind.\n\nA musician who “knows” theory operates in a different way than a musician who does not, even though the theory is not being processed in music-making through the same conscious system that is used to analyze a score. Really successful musicians tend to enjoy that reflective, higher order engagement with the music, and can easily “re-virtualize” it when they play and listen. They know how to “let it be there” without it distracting them from “immersion” in the act of music making. They also respond well to intelligent preparation of these processes by an experienced musician.\n\nThis is how I feel about grammar. I also found school-like textbook grammar exercises boring - mostly because they were busy work designed to trick me into memorizing something that it is useful to memorize, but in a stupefying “spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down” way - but I don’t have a hostile relationship with grammar as such. I use grammar in teaching my kids foreign languages, but I try to use it in an artful way, prompting reflective awareness when it seems necessary and interesting and helpful, but also doing a ton of immersion (they are listening to Italian TV right now while they play together). If they can handle memorizing paradigms, and they do it effortlessly and quickly, I encourage them to do so, because I think it primes the pump of their listening-module. If they don’t do it effortlessly and quickly, I back off a little, but don’t throw it out entirely. There is a fine line between busy work and flirting with the mind to help it open up. The art of deliberate teaching is mostly about identifying that line and staying on the right side of it.\n\nBTW, and to reinforce your point about the importance of auditory processing (now that I’ve qualified it a bit) I think the idea of surfing the meaning in sound that I am so used to doing as a musician translates to language acquisition. I can tell you that having personal experience with the process of “filling my ears with consciousness,” as well as shutting off unhelpful conscious cognition in performance, has taught me how to listen in a way that I deliberately use when I immerse in Italian. Passing information from analytic to non-analytic subsystems of the mind is a very useful skill that can be encouraged and somehow consciously guided."
