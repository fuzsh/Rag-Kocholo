        "text": "“Blood Knot,” the 1961 play that vaulted Athol Fugard into international prominence, features two young South African men, one black and one white, grappling over what the world owes them. “The Train Driver,” which Mr. Fugard, left, wrote in 2010, features two older South African men, one black and one white, grappling over what they owe the world. These works bookend a rich career for Mr. Fugard, who turns 80 this June and is being honored this season with four major New York productions. These two plays, along with the 1989 political drama “My Children! My Africa!,” make up a big part of the Signature Theater Company’s inaugural season in its new home.\n\nBut first comes “The Road to Mecca,” which opens Jan. 17 at the Roundabout Theater Company’s American Airlines Theater. Rosemary Harris stars in the 1984 drama as Miss Helen, an Afrikaner widow who earns the mistrust of her village when she begins filling her yard with ambitious, whimsical sculptures after the death of her husband.\n\nMr. Fugard, whose efforts toward the abolition of apartheid and the creation of a multiracial theater resulted in banned plays and a revoked passport, is not finished chronicling South Africa’s tumultuous past and future. He recently finished a one-act play that he plans to perform with his 8-year-old grandson, and the desk in his temporary apartment — which is conveniently situated in the same building as the Signature Center — has a longhand draft of a new play nestled alongside his iPad and a neat pile of English- and Afrikaans-language books by Pablo Neruda, Breyten Breytenbach, Ted Hughes and Antjie Krog. (“That’s glorious, isn’t it?” he said. “Everything is exactly in place.”) The creative instinct that both liberates and imperils Miss Helen comes into play in all four of these dramas.\n\n'THE ROAD TO MECCA,' with Rosemary Harris, left, and Carla Gugino in the coming revival at the Roundabout:\n\n“Something that has always intrigued me, as I think it does any sort of artist of any description, is the nature, genesis and consequences of a creative energy. Where did it come from? How does it work? And what prices do you pay for having it? Because there are consequences. Sometimes it's a marvelous thing, and sometimes it's a curse. And sometimes it's both. And sometimes the discovery of what your life should really be about comes to you very late. I’m an alcoholic — I don’t try to keep that a secret — and I wrote this play when I’d just decided I was going to stop drinking. There’s a line in the play when Miss Helen says, ‘I’ve reached the end of my journey.’ The other night, at the first preview, I suddenly realized: ‘Wow, you’re reaching the end of your journey. You wrote this play for yourself.’ And it turns out to be the story of this moment in my life, because in a way I’m not far away from the moment that all my candles are going to be blown out. So there we are.”\n\n'MY CHILDREN! MY AFRICA!,' in which Mr. Fugard uses the story of a high school literature competition to reflect on the African National Congress's incendiary rhetoric of the time (Courtney B. Vance, left, and John Kani in a 1989 production):\n\n“That play came out of the darkest period of apartheid years, a period when my faith in writing as a response to the situation was really being challenged. Do you use bombs or bullets, or do you use words when you are living with the most appalling brutality and violence against the majority of the people? I was almost traumatized that maybe I was impotent because I was using language and words. [Mr. Fugard points to a pocket dictionary on his desk.] Sixty-four thousand words. The greatest souls of the English language have used the words in that little book to unleash their fears, their loves, their dreams. And I emerged out of the writing of that play with an unshakable faith that putting words on paper is a form of action not only equally potent as placing a bomb, but possibly even more so.\n\n\"Because once the explosion is gone, all you're left with is the devastation. Words in someone else's head will be there for a long time.”\n\n'BLOOD KNOT,' in which two brothers of different races, Zachariah and Morris (Louis Gossett, left, and Nicholas Coster in a 1964 production), rely on pretense when they unwittingly strike up a correspondence with a white woman:\n\n“The genesis of this play doesn’t lie so much in the politics of South Africa but in the relationship of me and my brother. My deceased brother. What I realized with time is that it actually deals with the existential dilemma of me and the Other, and South Africa gave me the perfect visual maker for highlighting the differences between me and you.\n\n\"Then, using all these specifics of the South African reality, I explore the way the power structure can change. Morris dictates everything, and then the play changes when Zach says, ‘No, I want this white girl.’ And suddenly he dictates what’s going to happen. It’s a parable. A strange sort of parable.”\n\n'THE TRAIN DRIVER,' which is set in a makeshift graveyard overseen by a caretaker who decorates the anonymous graves with hubcaps and other pieces of detritus (Harry Groener, left, and Anthony Chisholm in the 2010 Long Wharf Theater production):\n\n“The graveyards of the unnamed in South Africa stretch seemingly to infinity. And as you walk among them, from time to time you find that somebody has thought to put a bottle filled with seashells on the ground.\n\n\"That is where my idea of Simon [the caretaker] comes from. Although these are nameless people that he buries, he’s trying to do what I’ve tried to do in my writing. You can’t give them a name, but you can say, ‘Here lies a human being.’ That’s all you can say about them. ‘Here lies a bubble of dreams and hopes that came to nothing.’”"
