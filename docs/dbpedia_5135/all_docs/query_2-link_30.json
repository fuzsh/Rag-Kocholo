        "text": "What goes through our minds just before we fall asleep could affect the content of our dreams.\n\nFor example, during exam time, students may dream about course content. People in a relationship may dream of their partner. Web developers may see programming code.\n\nThese circumstantial observations suggest that elements from the everyday re-emerge in dream-like imagery during the transition from wakefulness to sleep.\n\nCharacters\n\nStudies have examined the “characters” that appear in dream reports and how they the dreamer identifies them.\n\nA study of 320 adult dream reports found:\n\nForty-eight percent of characters represented a named person known to the dreamer.\n\nThirty-five percent of characters were identified by their social role (for example, policeman) or relationship to dreamer (such as a friend).\n\nSixteen percent were not recognized\n\nAmong named characters:\n\nThirty-two percent were identified by appearance\n\nTwenty-one percent were identified by behavior\n\nForty-five percent were identified by face\n\nForty-four percent were identified by “just knowing”\n\nElements of bizarreness were reported in 14 percent of named and generic characters.\n\nAnother study investigated the relationship between dream emotion and dream character identification.\n\nAffection and joy were commonly associated with known characters and were used to identify them even when these emotional attributes were inconsistent with those of the waking state.\n\nThe findings suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, associated with short-term memory, is less active in the dreaming brain than during waking life, while the paleocortical and subcortical limbic areas are more active.\n\nMemories\n\nThe concept of ‘repression’ dates back to Freud. Freud maintained that undesirable memories could become suppressed in the mind. Dreams ease repression by allowing these memories to be reinstated.\n\nA study showed that sleep does not help people forget unwanted memories. Instead, REM sleep might even counteract the voluntary suppression of memories, making them more accessible for retrieval.\n\nTwo types of temporal effects characterize the incorporation of memories into dreams:\n\nthe day-residue effect, involving immediate incorporations of events from the preceding day\n\nthe dream-lag effect, involving incorporations delayed by about a week\n\nThe findings of one study suggest that:\n\nprocessing memories into dream incorporation takes a cycle of around 7 days\n\nthese processes help further the functions of socio-emotional adaptation and memory consolidation\n\nDream lag\n\nDream-lag is when the images, experiences, or people that emerge in dreams are images, experiences, or people you have seen recently, perhaps the previous day or a week before.\n\nThe idea is that certain types of experiences take a week to become encoded into long-term memory, and some of the images from the consolidation process will appear in a dream.\n\nEvents experienced while awake are said to feature in 1 to 2 percent of dream reports, although 65 percent of dream reports reflect aspects of recent waking life experiences.\n\nThe dream-lag effect has been reported in dreams that occur at the REM stage but not those that occur at stage 2.\n\nMemory types and dreaming\n\nTwo types of memory can form the basis of a dream.\n\nThese are:\n\nautobiographical memories, or long-lasting memories about the self\n\nepisodic memories, which are memories about specific episodes or events\n\nA study exploring different types of memory within dream content among 32 participants found the following:\n\nOne dream (0.5 percent) contained an episodic memory.\n\nMost dreams in the study (80 percent) contained low to moderate incorporations of autobiographical memory features.\n\nResearchers suggest that memories of personal experiences are experienced fragmentarily and selectively during dreaming. The purpose may be to integrate these memories into the long-lasting autobiographical memory.\n\nA hypothesis stating that dreams reflect waking-life experiences is supported by studies investigating the dreams of psychiatric patients and patients with sleep disorders. In short, their daytime symptoms and problems are reflected in their dreams.\n\nIn 1900, Freud described a category of dreams known as “biographical dreams.” These reflect the historical experience of being an infant without the typical defensive function. Many authors agree that some traumatic dreams perform a function of recovery.\n\nOne paper hypothesizes that the main aspect of traumatic dreams is to communicate an experience that the dreamer has in the dream but does not understand. This can help an individual reconstruct and come to terms with past trauma.\n\nThemes\n\nThe themes of dreams can be linked to the suppression of unwanted thoughts and, as a result, an increased occurrence of that suppressed thought in dreams.\n\nFifteen good sleepers were asked to suppress an unwanted thought 5 minutes prior to sleep.\n\nThe results demonstrate that there were increased dreams about the unwanted thought and a tendency to have more distressing dreams. They also imply that thought suppression may lead to significantly increased mental disorder symptoms.\n\nResearch has indicated that external stimuli presented during sleep can affect the emotional content of dreams.\n\nFor example, the positively-toned stimulus of roses in one study yielded more positively themed dreams, whereas the negative stimulus of rotten eggs was followed by more negatively themed dreams.\n\nTypical dreams are defined as dreams similar to those reported by a high percentage of dreamers.\n\nUp to now, the frequencies of typical dream themes have been studied with questionnaires. These have indicated that a rank order of 55 typical dream themes has been stable over different sample populations.\n\nSome themes are familiar to many people, such as flying, falling, and arriving late.\n\nThe 55 themes identified are:\n\nschool, teachers, and studying\n\nbeing chased or pursued\n\nsexual experiences\n\nfalling\n\narriving too late\n\na living person being dead\n\na person now dead being alive\n\nflying or soaring through the air\n\nfailing an examination\n\nbeing on the verge of falling\n\nbeing frozen with fright\n\nbeing physically attacked\n\nbeing nude\n\neating delicious food\n\nswimming\n\nbeing locked up\n\ninsects or spiders\n\nbeing killed\n\nlosing teeth\n\nbeing tied up, restrained, or unable to move\n\nbeing inappropriately dressed\n\nbeing a child again\n\ntrying to complete a task successfully\n\nbeing unable to find toilet, or embarrassment about losing one\n\ndiscovering a new room at home\n\nhaving superior knowledge or mental ability\n\nlosing control of a vehicle\n\nfire\n\nwild, violent beasts\n\nseeing a face very close to you\n\nsnakes\n\nhaving magical powers\n\nvividly sensing, but not necessarily seeing or hearing, a presence in the room\n\nfinding money\n\nfloods or tidal waves\n\nkilling someone\n\nseeing yourself as dead\n\nbeing half-awake and paralyzed in bed\n\npeople behaving in a menacing way\n\nseeing yourself in a mirror\n\nbeing a member of the opposite sex\n\nbeing smothered, unable to breathe\n\nencountering God in some form\n\nseeing a flying object crash\n\nearthquakes\n\nseeing an angel\n\npart animal, part human creatures\n\ntornadoes or strong winds\n\nbeing at the movie\n\nseeing extra-terrestrials\n\ntraveling to another planet\n\nbeing an animal\n\nseeing a UFO\n\nsomeone having an abortion\n\nbeing an object\n\nSome dream themes appear to change over time.\n\nFor example, from 1956 to 2000, there was an increase in the percentage of people who reported flying in dreams. This could reflect the increase in air travel.\n\nWhat do they mean?\n\nRelationships: Some have hypothesized that one cluster of typical dreams, including being an object in danger, falling, or being chased, is related to interpersonal conflicts.\n\nSexual concepts: Another cluster that includes flying, sexual experiences, finding money, and eating delicious food is associated with libidinal and sexual motivations.\n\nFear of embarrassment: A third group, containing dreams that involve being nude, failing an examination, arriving too late, losing teeth, and being inappropriately dressed, is associated with social concerns and a fear of embarrassment.\n\nBrain activity and dream types\n\nIn neuroimaging studies of brain activity during REM sleep, scientists found that the distribution of brain activity might also be linked to specific dream features.\n\nSeveral bizarre features of normal dreams have similarities with well-known neuropsychological syndromes that occur after brain damage, such as delusional misidentifications for faces and places.\n\nDreams and the senses\n\nDreams were evaluated in people experiencing different types of headache. Results showed people with migraine had increased frequency of dreams involving taste and smell.\n\nThis may suggest that the role of some cerebral structures, such as amygdala and hypothalamus, are involved in migraine mechanisms as well as in the biology of sleep and dreaming.\n\nMusic in dreams is rarely studied in scientific literature. However, in a study of 35 professional musicians and 30 non-musicians, the musicians experienced twice as many dreams featuring music, when compared with non-musicians.\n\nMusical dream frequency was related to the age of commencement of musical instruction but not to the daily load of musical activity. Nearly half of the recalled music was non-standard, suggesting that original music can be created in dreams.\n\nPain\n\nIt has been shown that realistic, localized painful sensations can be experienced in dreams, either through direct incorporation or from memories of pain. However, the frequency of pain dreams in healthy subjects is low.\n\nIn one study, 28 non-ventilated burn victims were interviewed for 5 consecutive mornings during their first week of hospitalization.\n\nResults showed:\n\nThirty-nine percent of people reported pain dreams.\n\nOf those experiencing pain dreams, 30 percent of their total dreams were pain-related.\n\nPatients with pain dreams showed evidence of reduced sleep, more nightmares, higher intake of anxiolytic medication, and higher scores on the Impact of Event Scale.\n\nPatients with pain dreams also had a tendency to report more intense pain during therapeutic procedures.\n\nMore than half did not report pain dreams. However, these results could suggest that pain dreams occur at a greater frequency in populations currently experiencing pain than in normal volunteers.\n\nSelf-awareness\n\nOne study has linked frontotemporal gamma EEG activity to conscious awareness in dreams.\n\nThe study found that current stimulation in the lower gamma band during REM sleep influences on-going brain activity and induces self-reflective awareness in dreams.\n\nResearchers concluded that higher order consciousness is related to oscillations around 25 and 40 Hz.\n\nRelationships\n\nRecent research has demonstrated parallels between styles of romantic attachment and general dream content.\n\nAssessment results from 61 student participants in committed dating relationships of six months duration or longer revealed a significant association between relationship-specific attachment security and the degree to which dreams about romantic partners followed.\n\nThe findings illuminate our understanding of mental representations with regards to specific attachment figures.\n\nDeath in dreams\n\nResearchers compared the dream content of different groups of people in a psychiatric facility. Participants in one group had been admitted after attempting to take their own lives.\n\nTheir dreams of this group were compared with those of three control groups in the facility who had experienced:\n\ndepression and thoughts about suicide\n\ndepression without thinking about suicide\n\ncarrying out a violent act without suicide\n\nThose who had considered or attempted suicide or carried out violence had were more likely to have dreams with content relating to death and destructive violence. One factor affecting this was the severity of an individual’s depression.\n\nLeft and right side of the brain\n\nThe right and left hemispheres of the brain seem to contribute in different ways to a dream formation.\n\nResearchers of one study concluded that the left hemisphere seems to provide dream origin while the right hemisphere provides dream vividness, figurativeness and affective activation level.\n\nA study of adolescents aged 10 to 17 years found that those who were left-handed were more likely to experience lucid dreams and to remember dreams within other dreams."
