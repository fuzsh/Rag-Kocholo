        "text": "The Conflict of Conscience, a morality play by Nathaniel Wood, was printed in London, 1581, in a black-letter quarto. This is the only known edition of the work; it appeared, however, in two issues. The first of these gives the name of “Frauncis Spera” on the title-page and in the Prologue, and at the end of the piece the Nuntius announces that Philologus, the character representing the Italian, Francesco Spiera, had committed suicide. The second issue does not mention the name of the historical prototype of the chief character in the drama, and in it the Nuntius announces that Philologus had been reconverted to Protestantism before his death.\n\n1 The facts that are known of the life of Nathaniel Wood or Woodes, as the name appears on the title-page of his play, are limited. The record of his matriculation as a sizar at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Michaelmas term, 1567, constitutes the first definite information about his life. He graduated B.A. from Cambridge in the spring of 1572 and M.A. two years later. In the meantime he was ordained priest at Norwich in 1571, and in 1572 he became rector of South Walsham St. Mary's, a small parish about nine miles from Norwich. In 1586 this living was given to another, and nothing is known of Wood's whereabouts until 1594, when he was incorporated at Oxford. After that time no more information regarding him is to be found. See John Venn and J. A. Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses (Cambridge, 1922), iv, 453.\n\n7 The difficulty of acting a play with asides arranged in this fashion was pointed out to me by Professor Charles Read Baskervill. A. W. Ward, A History of English Dramatic Literature (London, 1899), i, 139, considers the use of the seven-line stanza to be evidence that the play was hardly intended for presentation. But a considerable number of the early plays were written in the seven-line stanza.\n\n10 Such a ballad is Thomas Knell, An Answer at large, to a most hereticall, trayterous, Papistical Byll, … (London, 1570), reprinted in Northampton, 1881, by John Taylor. Other ballads of this type are reprinted by Joseph Lilly, A Collection of Seventy-Nine Black-Letter Ballads and Broadsides (London, 1867), pp. 30–32; 33–36; 224–227. H. E. Rollins, “An Analytical Index to the Ballad-Entries (1557–1709) in the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London,” SP, xxi (1924), 14, 23, 84, 107, passim, has entries of ballads that obviously must have been of the type under discussion here.\n\n25 This title is taken from Mary Augusta Scott, Elizabethan Translations from the Italian (Boston and New York, 1916), p. 253. A copy of this edition of Gribaldi's work in English is to be found in the Bodleian Library. The Catalogus Librorum Impressorum Bibliothecae Bodleianae in Academia Oxoniensi (Oxford, 1843), ii, 200, does not give the place where the work was printed nor the printer.\n\n42 The British Museum Catalogue, under F. Spira, supplies the date 1637 in brackets. I have not seen a copy of the first edition but have used the second edition which has the title: A Relation of the Fearefull Estate of Francis Spira, in the yeare, 1548 (London, 1640).\n\n63 See John Bale, A declaration of Edmonde Bonners articles (London, 1561), Sig. * ii recto, fols. 12 recto, 24 recto, 55 recto, 62 verso, passim; “A Comedy concerning Three Laws of Nature, Moses and Christ” and “A Tragedy of John, King of England” in The Dramatic Writings of John Bale, edited by J. S. Farmer (London, 1907), pp. 1–82 and 171–294; “Lusty Juventus” and “New Custom” in Hazlitt's Dodsley, ii, 41–102 and iii, 1–52; and the recently discovered Fable of Philargyrie, printed by Robert Crowley and probably written by him, which has been published in facsimile with a short introduction by W. A. Marsden (London, 1931).\n\n84 Eduard Eckhardt, Die Dialekt- und Ausländertypen des älteren Englischen Dramas (Louvain, 1910), i, 94–97, has made a study of the dialect of Caconos. His conclusions are that Wood probably intended Caconos to speak Scottish, but that Wood must have known the dialect very imperfectly, for while Scottish and Northern forms predominate, there are also many Midland forms in Caconos' dialect, as well as many that are invented."
