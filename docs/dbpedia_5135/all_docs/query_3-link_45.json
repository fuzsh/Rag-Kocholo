Summary\n\nAlice Munro is a Canadian Nobel-Prize-winning author of short stories, and Runaway, first published in 2004, is a collection of eight such stories (though kind of actually only six, because three of them are sequential). These stories examine the lives of Canadian women throughout the last century, but not all of them are necessarily realistic to what daily life actually looks like. Rather, Munro uses borderline-supernatural events (which some critics say feel staged or contrived) to shed light on the tensions and challenges of gender in modern life.\n\nThis can mean that some of the stories are quite hard to follow; they go through all these twists and turns, and the lines between stories start blurring after a while. Letâs go through each in a bit more detail before jumping into our analysis.\n\n2. Story-by-Story Characters and Summary\n\nRunaway\n\nThe titular story is about a woman Carla, her husband Clark, their goat Flora, and their elderly neighbour Sylvia Jamieson. There are many runaways in the story: Carla ran away from her middle-class home to marry Clark, Flora the goat literally runs away, a scandalous lie about Sylviaâs late husband gets a bit out of hand, and now Sylvia is helping Carla run away once again, this time from Clark. Few of these runaways are really very successful: this story is really interrogating why and how.\n\nChance/Soon/Silence\n\nThe next three stories are sequential, and revolve around Juliet, a well-educated classicist who is working as a teacher in the first story, âChanceâ - it is set in 1965 and she is 21. In this story, she meets her lover Eric Porteous on a train, then finds him again six months later. Eric is sleeping around with a few women in light of his wifeâs declining health and eventual passing, but by âSoonâ he and Juliet have settled down and had a baby together - Penelope.\n\nâSoonâ focuses more on the relationship between Juliet and her parents, in particular her mother Sara. Juliet feels a bit out of place now at home, and feels guilty about not being more present for Sara. In turn, âSilenceâ depicts her own daughter running away from her. Juliet returns to her studies and only hears about Penelopeâs life through a chance encounter with a friend who reveals that Penelope is now a mother herself.\n\nPassion\n\nThe next story is about Grace, an older woman revising the family home of her husband Maury Travers. Their marriage never had a lot of passion in it really - Grace was always more interested in Mauryâs family - but both of them were just doing what was expected of them. The contrast comes from Mauryâs brother Neil, a doctor who accompanies Grace on a hospital trip when she cuts her foot. This trip becomes longer and more sensual, feeling adulterous even though very little actually transpires between them - the story raises questions around what counts as cheating, and what marriages should entail.Â\n\nTrespasses\n\nâTrespassesâ is slightly deliberately disorienting from the start (which is actually the end of the story). We go on a flashback in the middle to learn about a father, Harry, and his daughter Lauren. One day when moving house, Lauren finds a cardboard box - Harry explains that it contains the ashes of a dead baby who he and his wife Eileen (Laurenâs mother) had had before Lauren. This leads to Lauren questioning if she was adopted, which is further complicated by Delphine, a worker at a hotel who seems to think Lauren is her biological daughter. The ending (which was teased at the beginning) is the evening of confrontation between the four characters where the truth is finally revealed.Â\n\nTricks\n\nConversely, âTricksâ has a more linear plot to follow. Robin is a carer for her asthmatic sister Joanne, but sheâs taken to watching Shakespeare plays in the next town once a year. One year, she meets a European clockmaker Danilo who plans to meet her next year when she is back in town - but this doesnât go to plan at all. Itâs only 40 years later that Robin finds out Danilo had a twin brother, which is why the plan had gone downhill.\n\nPowers\n\nThe last story in the collection is arguably the most complex, and itâs broken into 5 parts to reflect that complexity. It follows Nancy as she ages from a fresh high school graduate to an old woman by the end of the sequence, including her marriage to the town doctor Wilf. Importantly, the stories also cover her friendship with Tessa, who has the supernatural powers mentioned in the title. However, by the third story, Tessa has been abandoned in a mental hospital and she has lost her powers. Throughout the stories, we also see Ollie, Wilfâs cousin (or a figment of Nancyâs imagination according to this analysis), who seems to be responsible for Tessaâs demise.\n\n3. Themes\n\nLetâs start tracing some of the common themes between the stories.\n\nMarriage\n\nA key theme explored throughout many of the stories is marriage and domesticity. Thereâs a strong sense that itâs an underwhelming experience: it doesnât live up to expectations and it particularly dampens the lives of the women involved. Nancyâs marriage to Wilf in âPowersâ only happens because she feels guilty - 'I could hardly [turn him down] without landing us both inâ¦embarrassment' - but, as a result, she loses her fun, intellectual streak as he tells her to put down her book, 'give Dante a rest'. A similar fate befalls Juliet, who gives up her study in the process of becoming married.\n\nÂ Marriage is also sometimes explored as a deliberate choice, even if it might have unintended consequences - for example, Carlaâs marriage to Clark is described as a life that she 'chose'. This interpretation is more unclear though, and is contradicted in other stories like Passion, where Graceâs marriage is described as 'acquiescence ', acceptance without protest. Itâs even contradicted to some extent in the same story: Munro compares Carlaâs marriage to a 'captive' situation, where she mightâve chosen to enter the marriage, but after that has little say in how it goes.\n\nRunaways\n\nThis sounds a bit trite, but the title is a key theme as well - just not necessarily in the physical sense. Consider all of these different definitions and how they pop up in the stories. In âRunawayâ, Carla and the goat run away, but also the lie Carla tells Clark about Leon, a runaway lie that taints his relationship with Sylvia completely. Some runaways are described as accidents - 'she â Flora â slipped through' - while others are much more deliberate. The question here is how much control we actually have over our own lives. Not a lot, it would seem.\n\nThe other side of runaway/s is to think about who the victim in each runaway is. Does somebody run away because they are 'in a bad situation, the way it happens', a victim of circumstance, or do they run away because they feel guilty, or because theyâre abandoning someone else, the true victim of being left behind? Carla does seem like more of a victim of circumstance with good reason to run away, but think about Nancy leaving Tessa behind in âPowersâ: ââIâll write to youâ, she saidâ¦she never did.â\n\nThis question about who the real victim is might be the hardest to answer for âSilenceâ. Julietâs daughter abandons her, but itâs not like thereâs a strong history of positive mother-daughter relationships in their family: Juliet wasnât able to give Sara what she needed ( 'she had not protected Sara') and in turn isnât able to quite give Penelope what she needs either (Penelope having a 'hunger for the things that were not available to her in her home '). At the same time, Penelopeâs abandonment does feel quite callous and inexplicable, even if Juliet feels like itâs what she deserves; Munro suggests at the end of the story that a reunion would be an 'undeserved blessing[]'. The intertextuality with Aethiopica reveals Julietâs good intentions, her similarity to the 'great-hearted queen of Ethiopia', but it doesnât quite give us the satisfaction of a neat resolution either.\n\nEthics and Morality\n\nFinally, Munroâs stories also raise questions around morality. Besides what weâve already covered - adultery, runaways - there are further questions raised around parenthood, particularly in âTrespassesâ. Harry seems to share a bit too much information with his child, who really doesnât need to know about the dead baby just yet. Lauren is 'not short of information', and itâs worth questioning where that boundary should be for a child of her age.\n\nBut not all ethical questions have simple answers: as in âTricksâ they can sometimes just have 'outrageous', cruel punchlines that donât reveal themselves for decades. Munro doesnât necessarily have all the answers on this one. She brings up complex moral situations but does not pass judgment on any.\n\n4. Symbols & Analysis\n\nGreek Elements\n\nThroughout the stories, Munro brings in a few elements of Greek mythology or literature. The intertextuality in âSilenceâ is one example, drawing on the classical text Aethiopica, but there are a few more scattered throughout the stories: the constellations of Orion and Cassiopeia in âChanceâ and an oracle-like figure in Tessa, a main character in âPowersâ. All of these elements have some significance:\n\nCassiopeia is known for her arrogance and vanity, which parallels with the way Juliet detaches herself from her life ('she had made herself into a rather superior, invulnerable observer' - despite her very real vulnerabilities)\n\nOrion is known for his forbidden romance with the virgin goddess Artemis, which parallels with Ericâs romance with Juliet (Juliet being relatively inexperienced with men herself, with all of her experiences being 'fantasy')\n\nOracles in mythology are like mouthpieces of the gods who can prophesy about the future. They were often women, so oracles were unusually influential in their male-dominated societies. The question is whether this parallels with Tessa at all: even though she has these supernatural powers, are there other forms of power she might lack instead?\n\nIn general, intertextuality is a way to enrich a text by drawing parallels and linking characters to existing stories or archetypes. Here, Munro uses classical texts to add dimension to her characters in a way that is almost-but-not-quite commentary. Pre-existing Greek myths are a way for us to see whatâs really going on.\n\n(Rail)Roads and Transit\n\nThe other symbol that comes up a few times in the stories is roads or railroads - basically places where runaways might happen. âChanceâ is set in the middle of a train journey, âTricksâ involves a couple of train journeys, âRunawayâ maps the roads leading in and out of Carlaâs home, and almost all of âPassionâ takes place on the road. If we broaden âplaces where runaways might happenâ to include planes as well, then we can add âPowersâ and âSilenceâ to the list.\n\nAll of these spaces are what might be called liminal - theyâre âin-betweenâ spaces with an air of suspense about what can happen. Itâs probably most prominent in âPassionâ, where Grace describes the events of that road trip as a 'passageâ in her life, both physically and metaphorically. In general though, theyâre the settings where the wildest and most significant events tend to happen.\n\n5. Quotes\n\nRunaway\n\n'SheâFloraâslipped through.'\n\n'She (referring to Carla) chose this life with Clark.'\n\n'She is just in a bad situation, the way it happens.'\n\n'She saw him as the architect of the life ahead of them, herself as the captive, her submission both proper and exquisite.'\n\n'She might be free.' - this is the second last line in the story. Note the ambiguity here (and through all these quotes, to be honest) about which âsheâ is being referred to (Carla, Flora or even Sylvia)\n\nChance/Soon/Silence\n\n'Juliet was twenty-one years old and already the possessor of a B.A. and an M.A. in classics.'\n\n'The problem was that she was a girl. If she got marriedâwhich might happenâ¦âshe would waste all her hard work.'\n\n'She had made herself into a rather superior, invulnerable observer.'\n\n'â¦the two of them (referring to Sara and Juliet) intertwined. And then abruptly, Juliet hadnât wanted any more of it.'\n\n'But she had not protected Sara. When Sara had said, soon Iâll see Juliet, Juliet had found no reply. Could it not have been managed?â¦She had put everything away.'\n\nPenelope supposedly had a 'hunger for the things that were not available to her in her home.'\n\n'Penelope does not have a use for me.'\n\n'She hopes as people who know better hope for undeserved blessings, spontaneous remissions, things of that sort.'\n\nPassion\n\nGrace, watching a movie with Maury, felt 'rageâ¦because that was what girls were supposed to be like. Thatâs what men - people, everybody - thought they should be like. Beautiful, treasured, spoiled, selfish, pea-brained. That was what a girl should be, to be fallen in love with.'\n\n'It was not in her nature, of course, to be so openly dumbfounded, so worshipful, as he was.'\n\n'Describing this passage, this change in her life, later on, Grace might say - she did say - that it was as if a gate had clanged shut behind her. But at the time there was no clang - acquiescence simply rippled through her.'\n\nTrespasses\n\nLauren 'had been brought up to believe that children and adults could be on equal terms with each other.'\n\n'How could she be sure that they had not got her as a replacement? If there was one big thing she hadnât known about, why could there not be another?'\n\n'Forgive us our trespasses' - note the ambiguity of âtrespassesâ (does it mean sins as in the prayer, or overstepping boundaries, or both?)\n\nâTricks\n\n'Some of the best-looking, best-turned-out women in town are those who did not marry.'\n\n'A means to an end, those tricks are supposed to be.'\n\nPowers\n\n'I couldnât stand for the poor man (referring to Wilf) to have had two girls turn him downâ\n\n'I used to have a feeling something really unusual would occur in my life, and it would be important to have recorded everything. Was that just a feeling?'\n\n'She could be upset to see you leave without her. So Iâll give you an opportunity just to slip away.'\n\n'He has nearly forgotten that he ever believed in her powers, he is now only anxious for her and for himself, that their counterfeit should work well.'\n\nHaving great quotes is one thing, but you also want to make sure you know How To Embed Quotes in Your Essay Like a Boss!\n\n6. Sample Essay Topics\n\nWhat does Runaway teach us about romance?\n\nCarla, Grace and Tessa are more similar than different in terms of their relationships with the men in their lives. Do you agree?\n\nHow does Munro contrast younger and older women in Runaway?\n\nWhat does the setting contribute to the overall effect of Runaway?\n\n'Forgive us our trespasses.' What types of boundaries are created and overstepped in Runaway?\n\n7. Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will give you a brief glimpse on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nâForgive us our trespasses.â What types of boundaries are created and overstepped in Runaway?\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThis quote is from âTrespassesâ and captures the double meaning of the word as both overstepping physical boundaries and sinning in the moral or religious sense. Itâs likely weâll want to talk about both interpretations - physically trespassing but also encroaching on boundaries in immoral ways. Note that the prompt also includes the action words âcreatedâ and âoversteppedâ, meaning that thereâll be a pretty diverse range of examples that weâll need to use to answer this prompt comprehensively.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nLetâs start with physical boundaries: Carlaâs marriage and the fences on her property and the US-Canada border in âPowersâ come to mind. Then, weâve got non-physical boundaries: emotionally as in âChanceâ and ethically as in âTrespassesâ. This is where we start getting into whether these boundaries are created or overstepped.\n\nClark creates boundaries for Carla and her attempts to break free from them are unsuccessful. The border in âPowersâ is more of an excuse for Nancy to neglect Tessa, a boundary she creates and never makes the effort to overstep. Finally, the ethical boundaries in âTrespassesâ are overstepped from the get-go. How can we synthesise these ideas into one essay?\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nI think the trick with questions like this is not to just allocate different types of boundaries and/or different action words to each paragraph. Try to think of creative ways to string these ideas together that also build towards a bigger picture or overall contention about the text as a whole. This example plan explores physical and emotional boundaries but makes a bigger argument that they are often associated with regret in Munroâs stories.\n\nâParagraph 1: Physical boundaries are both the most intentional and the most difficult to overstep.\n\nCarlaâs farmstead is isolated and bordered by roads; her marriage to Clark and her life on this farmstead is likened to a 'captive' situation, with Clark being the 'architect' of it all\n\nMunro ends Runaway on a pessimistic note about Carlaâs ability to leave this boundary: 'She might be free'\n\nInternational borders also constitute physical barriers, and these are used by Nancy in âPowersâ to avoid responsibility; because this is an active decision (ââIâll write to youâ, she saidâ¦she never did.â), itâs a barrier that never really gets broken. Similar to Penelope in âSilenceâ\n\nParagraph 2: Munroâs stories, however, focus more on emotional boundaries, and the way these are applied varies greatly. This variation underscores their complexity.\n\nEmotional boundaries when created can prevent intimacy: Juliet 'ma[kes] herself into a rather superior, invulnerable observer' so as to avoid commitment. These boundaries come back to bite when she has a daughter\n\nConversely, they cause a great deal of harm when overstepped: for example, âTrespassesâ sees 'crazy and dangerous' adults toy with the life of a child, constantly assuming that she 'can take it' when in fact this is not the case\n\nParagraph 3: Regardless, Munroâs characters often come to regret the boundaries they erect or overstep.\n\nCarlaâs ambivalence about her marriage is tinged with regret either way: when sheâs there, she wants to escape, and when she escapes, she questions if she has 'anything left in [her]'\n\nJuliet reflects on the boundaries she puts up between herself and Penelope and realises that 'spontaneous remissions' between them are undeserved and impossible\n\nIn âPowersâ, Nancy struggles with the guilt of abandoning Tessa: many years later, she still wants to 'open [the past] up' and understand her motives. However, it is too late, and the boundaries are already there\n\nMunro does not suggest that boundaries are inherently good or bad, but her stories show how they can be sources of regret when treated improperly\n\nRunaway is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Creative Response.

Always so much you want to write, never as much time as you need and they always seem to come around sooner than you think. But there is never as much cause for alarm as you think and Iâm willing to guarantee that almost everyone reading this is so much better than they think at English.Â\n\nYouâve already come so far from where you started in your high school English journey. Iâd like to challenge anyone reading this to go and find the earliest English essay youâve got tucked away somewhere. Iâve done this myself and, if yours is anything like mine, youâll be almost disgusted by what you find. Year-7-me just loved to retell the story, cling to my rigid TEEL formulas and leave my quotes just dangling, write the same basic paragraph three times and call it a complete essay. Not a pretty read and Iâm sure a couple of you can relate. But, this exercise does at least prove a very valuable point: you are capable of improving at English.\n\nSo letâs start thinking about that essay youâve got coming up again. Youâve just given yourself a nice confidence booster with that walk down memory lane, reminding yourself that you are a more-than-capable English student these days. But all you now want to do is your very best for this next essay. But how do you keep improving between now and then? After all, if you knew what you had to do to improve your English, youâd already be doing it, right? So what weâre going to do now is to have a look at what taking your essays to that next level really looks like; how you can improve your writing between now and then, whenever that might be.Â\n\nSo to do this, weâre going to take an already good paragraph and improve it together. Take this one, one that I conveniently prepared earlier to a Station Eleven prompt that has to do with the theme of memory/history.\n\nPart 1: The Good Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: In Station Eleven, the characters often find meaning from the creation of enduring legacies. Mandel demonstrates this idea through the naming of Jeevanâs son after his brother, Frank. By creating such an enduring legacy for a character who believes in the power of such legacies - 'theyâre all immortal to me' - Mandel implies that characters like this are able to achieve meaning and fulfilment by preserving these legacies. Mandel also uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of legacies to provide meaning where Miranda lacks it in her day-to-day life. Even though Mirandaâs life is left incomplete by her sudden death, the beauty in the scene of her death suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters: 'its extravagant sunsets and its indigo sea'. Hence, the meaning in her life comes from the legacy that she creates from the art she makes in her 'independent' life. This is contrasted against the character of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world, because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, implying less fulfilment in his life. Therefore, Mandel uses her text to demonstrate the value of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past.\n\nLetâs call this our good paragraph. Iâve modelled this off of an essay I found from my Year 10 self, as happy as Year-10-me would have been with this performance, itâs far from perfect. But, it is a very functional paragraph that does all that a paragraph really needs to do. It introduces an idea, justifies it with evidence, links back at the end and doesnât waste too much time retelling the story. So now we get to the fun bit: weâre going to take this already good paragraph, and turn it into a better paragraph.\n\nSo how do we make a good paragraph better?Â\n\nWell, for a start, we can integrate our quotes so that the paragraph reads better. Youâll see in just a second how much of a difference this can make. This is something I learnt to do between Years 10 and 11. Other improvements that could be made include answering the prompt more directly and using some of the language of the prompt within our answers. So letâs change this and see now what these small differences do to our paragraph.\n\nPart 2: The Better Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: In Station Eleven, the characters often find meaning from the creation of enduring legacies that allow others to remember the individuals who came before. Mandel demonstrates this idea through the naming of Jeevanâs son after his brother, Frank. By creating this symbolic memorial for a character who believes that such legacies can allow individuals such as actors to become 'immortal', Mandel implies that characters like this are able to achieve meaning and fulfilment through their legacies. Furthermore, Mandel also uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of creating a legacy through oneâs art to provide meaning where Miranda lacks it in her day-to-day life. Although abruptly killed off in the middle of the text, Mandel imbues her death with a certain beauty through its 'extravagant sunsets and indigo sea'. In doing so, Mandel provides a sense of completion about Mirandaâs life and suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters. Hence, the meaning in her life comes from the legacy that she creates from the art she makes in her 'independent' life. This is contrasted against the character of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world, because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, implying less fulfilment in his life. Therefore, Mandel uses her text to demonstrate the importance of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past.\n\nThere we have it. The paragraph has been rewritten based on the ones I wrote in Year 11 and we have the first signs of improvement. The topic sentence now references the âremembering the pastâ aspect of the prompt. The linking sentence now uses the âimportanceâ part of the prompt. All of the same quotes are used but are now integrated (check out How To Embed Quotes in Your Essay Like a Boss if you need more help with this).Â\n\nWeâve made sure not to have more than one sentence starting with Mandel (a small nitpick but still a nice addition). It flows better. It answers the prompt more directly and suddenly we have a better paragraph. Year-11-me has shown improvement and with this comes better scores and more confidence: something thatâs very important for success in English. If youâre confident and proud of what youâre writing, then youâll have higher marks and, even better, more fun!\n\nWe havenât changed much and the paragraph is already better. But itâs not my best paragraph. Between Years 11 and 12, I learnt even more things. I was taught to write about not only the world of the text but also the world around us that we and Mandel live in: youâll notice that this better paragraph talks more about âcharactersâ that live âin the textâ whereas my best paragraph would talk more about the text in the context of the world you and I live in. I learnt to make my topic sentences more abstract and broad so that they relate more to our own world and less to the world of the text and remind whoeverâs assessing that my ideas apply to everyone and not just within the texts. I learnt to respond more directly to different types of prompts (Discuss, To what extent is this true?, How does Mandelâ¦ and others) and I learnt to be more direct in discussing the views and values of Mandel (what she likes, what she doesnât like, what she wants to see more of in the world)\n\nSo letâs apply some final changes, and see what our paragraph looks after two more years of refining English. This final paragraph is almost exactly the same as one I wrote in timed conditions before my final exam.\n\nThe Final Part: The Best Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: Mandel explores the importance of legacies, not only as sources of meaning for their creators, but also for their roles in allowing others to remember the roles of those who came before. Such an idea is explored through the naming of Jeevanâs son, securing the legacy of Frank. By affording such a permeating influence to an individual who writes of and appreciates the 'immortal[ity]' of long-dead actors, Mandel implies that an appreciation of the inherent value in a legacy and its ability to influence future events is a key quality in individuals. Furthermore, Mandel uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of creating a legacy that outlives oneself to provide meaning. Although abruptly killed off in the middle of the text, Mandel imbues her death with a certain beauty through its 'extravagant sunsets and indigo sea'. In doing so, Mandel provides a sense of completion about Mirandaâs life and suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters. Hence, Mandel suggests that the meaning in Mirandaâs life comes from the legacy that is the art she makes in her 'independent' life that continues to influence events and allow others to remember the past long after her death. Mandel provides contrast through her exploration of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, reinforcing Mandelâs view that individuals who forfeit control of their own legacies, as Arthur does, lead far less completed and fulfilled lives. Therefore, Mandel highlights the immense importance of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past and encourages greater appreciation of the value of legacies in contemporary society.\n\nSo, two years later, and weâve got what is still essentially the same paragraph, just brushed up to an even better, or best, standard. So if weâre using the same evidence, exploring the same characters and introducing the same ideas, why is this paragraph better than the last two?Â\n\nWell, if you study the topic and linking sentences, they discuss the concept of a legacy being a means of allowing others to remember the past and the importance of such a thing and everything in-between links this concept to the text. 'Mandel highlights the immense importance' represents a subtle but nice nod to the wording of the prompt by giving an âextentâ to which Mandel âshowsâ or highlights. Every piece of evidence is discussed in reference to what Mandel believes about the world around us and how individuals should act in modern society.Â\n\nAnd thereâs something very nice that we can now reflect on. This paragraph has gone from good to much better without having to introduce any new ideas. There are no overly complex interpretations of the text, weâve just taken the same skeleton of a paragraph and made it look better without changing its real substance.Â\n\nAnd one of the wonderful things about making efforts to improve the quality of your writing is all the confidence that comes with this, whether this be from getting better at discussing views and values, learning to integrate your quotes or any achievement like this. I know that my confidence surged as my English got better and, as I got more confidence in my writing, I got more confidence in what I wrote about. My interpretations of the text became more and more obscure and a bit whacky at times and I had fun writing about these things. If you improve your writing, youâll improve what youâre writing about which will mean youâll have more fun writing and the cycle of improvement will just continue.Â\n\nSo to cap off, I thought it might be nice to have a checklist of sorts that you might be able to put against your own writing.\n\nWhatâs the next step I could take in improving my English?\n\nAre all my quotes properly integrated? (Hint: if the sentence doesnât make sense without quotation marks, the answer is no)\n\nHave I got more than a couple of sentences starting the same way or could I vary my sentence structure a bit more?\n\nHave I explicitly used some parts of the prompt in my own writing so that I can directly answer the question in my essays?\n\nAm I writing about both the world of the text and the world we live in outside of the text instead of just the characters and relationships within the text?\n\nAre my topic and linking sentences describing a concept that relates to the prompt with everything in-between relating this concept to the text? (I found this a very useful way of thinking of paragraphs)\n\nIs all of my evidence being discussed in relation to the views of the author?\n\nDoes my essay/paragraph explain what the author would like to see more of/less of in modern society based on what is explored in the text?\n\nIs my essay/paragraph specific to the exact wording and type of prompt?\n\nAnd these are just some of the improvements that could be made. Iâm sure each of you could ask teachers and past students and find many, many more tips on improvement. Just as long as youâre thinking about what the next step in your English might be, then youâre already headed in the right direction.

For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Secret River is a historical novel telling the story of William Thornhill, a poor Englishman from the early 19th century who was deported and transported to New South Wales, Australia in 1806 for theft. This novel tells the story of Australia's founding and the moral choices made when Â Europeans colonised land that was already inhabited by Aboriginal people.\n\nBackground\n\nDuring 18th century to mid 19th century, 162,000 men and women were transported to Australia, with majority from England. These people, known as âconvictsâ, had committed crimes such as larceny and robbery â acts which were considered severe offenses and demanded heavy sentences. In order to deal with the overwhelming masses of criminals, the government exported crowds of convicts to Australia to serve their term as labourers. The reason driving the deportation included an attempt to decrease poverty and crime in England while concurrently developing the British colony in Australia.\n\nMany of the fleets from England were destined for New South Wales, Australia. Those on the fleets included the criminals, marines, and their families. Living in a penal colony, the criminals were employed depending on their various skills: farmer, boatman, servant etc. The settlers were award a âticket of leaveâ if they presented good behaviour during labour. This meant that settlers would become emancipists, where they were set free from the governmentâs sentence and could begin a life for themselves by making their own living. This suited the governmentâs goal for a successful and thriving colony since it would only be possible if people were to work for themselves, and not under the terrain of the government.\n\nAlthough Australia was chiefly populated with Indigenous Australians, the first century of colonisation saw a drastic decline in their population. This was due to a clash of desire for the land; the nativeâs innate protection of their land and the white settlers struggle to declare their right to an area already inhibited by natives â possibly for 40,000 years. The two cultures failed to ever create a peace agreement or compensation and as a result, the frontier was often marked with blood. Overtime, a successful of the British colony meant that white settlement overpowered any possibility of the natives retaining their land. The Secret Riverâs exploration of this powerful change in Australiaâs history is a poignant reflection of the past, and demands attention to the sensitive issue of Australian and native relationship that is still present today.\n\nSetting\n\nSet during the early 19th century. Located in London, Sydney and on the Hawkesbury.\n\nChapter 1: Strangers\n\nPlot\n\nThe Alexander, a transport ship for convicts has reached New South Wales, Australia after a travelling across the world for majority of the year. William Thornhill, an Englishman convicted to sentence his ânatural life in the Year of Our Lord eighteen hundred and sixâ [pg 3] will serve as a labourer.\n\nDuring his first night in New South Wales, where their homes are âonly a flap of bark, a screen of sticks and mud,â Thornhill digested the new land with its ârich dank smellsâ¦restless waterâ¦no Pole starâ; an environment vastly differentiated from England. The unfamiliar situation is overwhelming as âhe had not cried, not for thirty yearsâ¦.but now his throat was thickening.â In his despair, Thornhill describes how being sentenced to New South Wales could potentially be worse than dying itself.\n\nInitially, Thornhill believed his tears are clouding his vision since the âdarkness moved in front of himâ [pg 5]. However, he then realised that a human, âas black as the air itselfâ stood before him. The unusual appearance of this human struck Thornhill since âhis skin swallowed the lightâ¦[and] eyes were set so deeply into the skull.â Although clothed, Thornhill ironically felt âskinlessâ against the other who was completely naked and holding a spear. Thornhill repeatedly demanded that the man âbe offâ, for fear of his family and himself being attacked. Despite his shouting, this only impelled the man to move closer to the point where they almost touched. The âblack manâ [pg 6] reproduced âbe offâ in Thornhillâs exact tone. While Thornhillâs fear of this strange human is prominent, he grappled the strength to exert a bold, intrepid veneer, as âhe was not about to surrender to any naked black manâ. When he glanced back to his wife and children however, the man promptly disappeared, leaving only the darkness behind. Thornhill returned to his hut where he laid back down to rest yet âevery muscle was tensedâ¦the cold moment of finding that unforgiving thing in his flesh.â\n\nAnalysis\n\nEnvironmental / Landscape conflict\n\nFor Thornhill, who has spent a lifetime in England, the confrontation of a new environment evokes a powerful sense of unfamiliarity. The unknown land presents him with various intrapersonal conflicts, one of which is the difference between England and Australian stars. While the physical distance of this new land from Thornhillâs home is demonstrated by the lack of a âPole Star, a friend to guide him on the Thames, [and] no Bear that he had known all his life,â [pg 4] the unrecognisable stars above Australia only depict a âblaze, unreadable, [and] indifferent.â His conflict demonstrates his physical and emotional distance from Thames, a place he grown up surrounded by compared to Australia, where learning begins from the very basics, as shown when he absorbs the natural landscape around him. The night described as âhuge and damp, flowing in and bringing with it the sounds of its own lifeâ [pg 3] highlights how the Australian land is unique, possessing qualities of existence.\n\nThornhillâs sense of negligence in the vast forest that continues âmile after mileâ is illustrated through the imagery of the âtrees [which] stood tall over him,â depicting that nature is a powerful and dominant force over the Europeans. While the trees render him insignificant, it also demonstrates his alienation from the environment. The âAlexander,â a common traditional English name, represents an intrusion of the Europeans onto the Australian land, further highlighting the idea that they do not belong on this island.\n\nThe Australian land is depicted to be harsh and unforgiving, as highlighted through the imagery of âdirt chill...sharp stab...alien stars' [pg 4] This conflict with the brutal landscape, along with the unknown leaves Thornhill apprehensive of what is to come. His feeling that he was ânothing more than a flea on the side of some enormous quiet creatureâ [pg 4] depicts the Australian land almost like a monster. Additionally, the words ârestlessâ draw to the idea that the land is at discomfort or uneasy to have new inhabitants.\n\nRacial/Cultural conflict\n\nThe conflict between two cultures is shown through the initial encounter between Thornhill and an Indigenous Australian. Without any conversation, the tension between the two is clear, merely through their actions in each otherâs prescence. Thornhill notes the Aboriginal maleâs tattoos, yet regards them as âscarsâ since he is unaware to their culture. Even before this man, Thornhill is still infused with a sense of nakedness because of his unfamiliarity.Â His feeling that âevery muscle was tensedâ¦the cold moment of finding that unforgiving thing in his fleshâ highlights the tension of his first encounter of an Australian Aboriginal while it also foreshadows a suffering and anguish for his time ahead.\n\nIf you'd like to see the all Chapter plots, their analysis, along with important quotes, then have a look at our The Secret River Study Guide.\n\nQuotes\n\nConflict with land quotes\n\nâNow it had fetched up at the end of the earth.â [pg 3]\n\nââ¦this prison whose bars were ten thousand miles of water.â [pg 3]\n\nâforeign darknessâ [pg 3]\n\nââ¦soughing of the forest, mile after mile.â [pg 3]\n\nâHe was nothing more than a flea on the side of some enormous quiet creature.â [pg 4]\n\nThornhillâs inner conflict quotes\n\nâHe had not cried, not for thirty years, not since he was a hungry child to young to know that crying did not fill your belly.â [pg 4]\n\nâBut every muscle was tensed, anticipating the shock in his neck or his belly, his hand going to the place, the cold moment of finding that unforgiving thing in his flesh.â [pg 6]\n\nRacism quotes\n\nâIt took a moment to understand that the stirring was a human, as black as the air itself.â [pg 5]\n\nâClothed as he was, Thornhill felt skinless as a maggot.â [pg 5]\n\nâThis was a kind of madness, as if a dog were to bark in English.â [pg 6]\n\nâHe was not about to surrender them to any naked black man.â [pg 6]\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\n1.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nTheme-Based essay prompt: The Secret River depicts many layers of conflict, within but also between its key characters. Discuss\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe key term of this prompt is conflict, but I think itâs also important to analyse how itâs discussedâas something that exists in layers, and something that can happen both within and between characters. This seems to hint at the idea that conflict can be internalâthat is a single character can feel conflicted about somethingâas well as externalâthat is two or more characters can have some kind of dispute. This prompt will require us to think about all these different types of conflict.Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nLetâs start with the most internal layerâconflicts with the self. In terms of key characters, consider William but also Sal: what debates do they have with themselves, or what do they say or do that shows they feel conflicted or unsure about something?Â Â\n\nThen, letâs broaden that out to interpersonal conflicts between characters. How do William and Sal, for example, come into conflict with their neighboursâboth their white neighbours and their Aboriginal neighbours? How do they come into conflict with each other, even?\n\nMaybe itâs worth separating the racial conflict into another categoryâconflicts between groups of characters, rather than individual characters. If we make this distinction, we need to be prepared to back it upâin what ways is this conflict of a different nature?\n\nStep 3: Create a plan\n\nI think we can pretty justifiably separate out our layers of conflict into those categories: interpersonal, interpersonal and interracial. This gives us three neat(-ish) paragraphs and a clear, affirmative contention: yes, there are many layers of conflict, and those are the three layers.Â\n\nP1: At its most intimate layer, conflict is internalâthe moral dilemmas of William and Sal are particularly strong examples.\n\nP2: Conflict can also be interpersonalâwe can see this between William and Dan, or William and his neighbours, or between William and Sal even. Itâs up to you which way you cut this paragraph.\n\nP3: However, perhaps the central conflict that the novel is built around is interracial conflict between white colonisers and the Aboriginal people whose land they occupied. To extend the prompt a little, we can talk about conflict not just between characters or people, but also between value systems. For example, the way colonisers saw land and property were fundamentally incompatible with how Aboriginal people saw itâthis is another type of conflict.\n\nIn this sense, weâre largely agreeing with the prompt, backing up the distinction between interpersonal and interracial conflict, and finding a way to extend on it a little towards the end. We can build this into the contention as well: there are many layers of conflict, but they occur not just between characters. They can also exist between the broad cultural values of entire groups of people as well.Â\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our The Secret River Study Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays (written by a 50 study scorer!) with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!

If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nHere, weâll be breaking down an All the Light We Cannot See essay topic using LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nWithout further ado, letâs get into it!\n\nââIn All the Light We Cannot See there is a fine line between civilised and uncivilised behaviour.â Discuss.\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nTaking a look at this prompt, the first thing to note is that it is theme-based. Specifically asking about the line that separates civilised and uncivilised behaviour within the novel, this prompt focuses directly on the theme of human behaviours and how you ultimately interpret the fine line (i.e. seamless, difficult, changing, manipulative) between such ideas. Fundamentally, you have to discuss how this theoretical line drawn between the contrasting behaviours is explored within the novel in various ways throughout Doerrâs examination of humanity.Â\n\nThe question tag of Discuss is the most flexible type of prompt/topic you will receive, providing you with a broad and open-ended route to pretty much discuss any ideas that you believe fit within the promptâs theme of uncivilised and civilised behaviour. Although this may seem hard to know where to start, this is where Step 2: Brainstorm, comes into play. You can read through LSGâs Question Tags You Need To Know section (in How To Write A Killer Text Response) to further familiarise yourself with various ways to tackle different prompt tags.\n\nIf youâre not sure what it is meant by âtheme-based prompt,â take a look atThe 5 Types of Essay Prompts.Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nA fundamental aspect of writing a solid Text Response essay is being able to use a diverse range of synonyms for the keywords outlined in the prompt. Our keywords are in bold. When you are brainstorming, if any words pop into your head, definitely list them so you can use them later. You may want to have a highlighter handy when unpacking prompts so you can do just this!!\n\nââIn All the Light We Cannot See there is a fine line between civilised and uncivilised behaviour.â Discuss.\n\nHow people have grown up determines the civil and uncivilised behaviours shown by individuals of different backgrounds and childhoods\n\n- Bastian is symbolised as the eagle that circles the youth camp, which is an uncivilised/unwanted form of hawk-like behaviour. This compares to Fredrick's love of birds as a young boy which makes him a softer character.\n\n- Bernd had âno friendsâ as a child - showing his isolated past - which could be described as the reason he leaves his father and goes off to join the Hilter Youth âjust like the other boys.â (find this analysis in the chapter âThe Death of Walter Berndâ)\n\nThere is a fine line that Doerr draws between the stereotypes of women and their ability to remain civilised despite being suppressed by uncivil livelihoods and experiences.\n\n- Jutta is characterised as a strong and independent woman instead of the traditional âpretty girl in a propaganda posterâ. Society expects most women to stand on that side of human behaviour and representation however she defies this.\n\nThe strength of women to cross/overcome the line of uncivilised behaviour is significant within the sexual abuse and misconduct driven by soldiers. Can remain true to oneself despite the horrific behaviours a woman faces.\n\n- The role of women on the homefront (i.e. Fredrickâs Mother) highlights the stark contrast between men fighting and thinking about the âmen they killedâ and mothers who put on a âfake smile to appear braveâ (the line between barbaric behaviours of many soldiers and caring/loving behaviours of those on the homefront) - women and their sacrifices is an important topic here\n\nIt is oneâs ability to adapt to change that draws the line between civil and uncivilised behaviours.\n\n- Marie Laureâs ability to look past being a âblind girlâ, and move on from this hardship. She adapts to the âchanging timesâ around her despite others who are suppressed in such an environment (e.g. Etienne and his âdreadâ).\n\nThe game of flying couch is a symbol of escaping the uncivilised world around them (metaphorical line of the human imagination).\n\n- Werner is predominantly overwhelmed by the world around him, which reflects his inability to no longer ask questions as he did as a young boy. Instead, he succumbs to the uncivilised world of death and destruction as he is unable to change.Â\n\nSymbolic use of Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ in epilogue - symbolises his loss of perspective and wonder of the world,\n\nUltimately it is this line that makes the human existence so unique\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nAfter having brainstormed all the ideas that came to mind, Iâll be approaching the essay prompt with the following contention.Â\n\nIn a world where society is grounded by behaviours both civil and uncivil, there is a clear distinction between humanity's response and representation of these behaviours.\n\nComing up with a clear contention allows you to put together a cohesive and strong essay that answers all aspects of the prompt question.Â\n\nNow, onto developing our topic sentences for each paragraph!\n\nP1: Embedded within Doerrâs nonlinear narrative*, the environment in which individuals have grown up consequently influences their behaviours later in life.\n\n*A nonlinear narrative is a storytelling technique Doerr uses to portray events out of chronological order.Â\n\nP2: Encompassing the social paradigms that pervade a womanâs existence, the strength and civilisation of females allow them to traverse a line of unjust behaviours that suppress them.\n\nP3: In essence, it is the human response to change that divides individuals from ultimately displaying civil or uncivil acts in the world.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nEssay\n\nThe art of recognising the ephemera of the human existence is painted by Anthony Doerrâs All the Light We Cannot See as a fine line between behaviours of civilisation and extreme brutality (1). In the inordinate scheme of history, Doerr fosters the dichotomy between those who remain socially aware and others who are marred by desolation as a reflection on one's past. Further subverting the traditional depiction of women in a âwar storyâ, the strength of women is established as a key turning point for individuals to escape barbaric behaviours and cross the line to civilisation. Fundamentally, however, it is the overall response to change that crafts human behaviours that Doerr underpins within society (2).\n\nAnnotationsâ\n\nâ(1) it is important to include synonym variation in your opening sentence to ensure that it does not look like you have just copied the prompt and placed it on your page. This idea should be carried out throughout your essay - vary your words and try not to repeat anything, this will ensure you are clear and concise!\n\n(2) In order to improve the flow of your writing, the final topic sentence of your introduction can be a concluding statement on why/how the topic is OVERALL expressed within the novel. When you formulate your contention, it is not enough just to state it, you must also provide reasoning as to why you are writing from this point of view or how you came to this conclusion. For example, my final topic sentence here is a concluding sentence about how I believe a fine line between uncivilised and civil behaviour has an influence throughout the entire novel and Doerrâs intention, oneâs response to change. As you read on, youâll also see that this sentence relates to my final paragraph, thus linking together ideas throughout my essay.\n\nEmbedded within Doerrâs nonlinear narrative, the environment in which individuals have grown up consequently influences their behaviours later in life. The initial illustration of the âsmokestacks humeâ and the âblack and dangerousâ imagery (3) of the war paints a clear picture of the destruction and trauma that individuals have lived amongst, thus why people were âdesperate to leaveâ. Empathising with an âold woman who cuddles her toddlerâ on the streets, Doerr laments how young individuals who end up âsurg[ing] towards one cause,â which this toddler may similarly grow up to do in the Hitler Youth, directly reflects the âintense maliceâ of their childhood. This idea that oneâs past affects the future behaviours of a generation is further captured within the chapter âThe Death of Walter Berndâ (4), which outlines how Berndâs upbringing with âno friendsâ promotes him to âjust leaveâ, in order to experience something new, despite knowing this something new would bring unjust decisions into his life. Becoming âjust like the other boysâ, Doerr suggests that the line between civil and uncivil behaviours is so thin (5) that a mere need to escape oneâs past is enough to create feelings of negativity and at worst death. Encapsulating the darkness that prevails over such individuals, the symbolism of Bastianâs âsharp eyesâ (6) poetically describes the eagle that circles the youth camp where Doerr seeks to paint a metaphorical cruel depiction of Bastian as a harmful hawk. Underpinning the fine line between human behaviour, Fredrickâs âlove of birdsâ is âso beautiful[ly]â representative of his respectful nature and approach to life while Bastianâs immersion in âthe self interest of the worldâ ultimately explains how his fallacious behaviour towards others is embodied by his environment within the war. Overall, the behaviours displayed by humanity are a reflection of past experiences and how they shape the individual.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(3) Imagery is a key aspect of All the Light We Cannot See and goes hand in hand with the vast symbolism Doerr uses within his novel. When including imagery, it is great to include a few related quotes; however, you must then ensure you analyse and delve into how this technique (imagery) demonstrates the idea you are writing about. In this case, the imagery of the chimneys and foggy/dirty air illustrates the desolate environment individuals lived in during the war.\n\n(4) This chapter is something not many students analyse or touch on so if youâre looking to add some spice to your writing I would definitely take a look and see what you can extract from some of those more unique and nuanced chapters!\n\n(5) Referencing the âfine lineâ continually throughout your essay ensures that you are staying on track and not talking about topics away from the prompt.Â\n\n(6) Symbolism is very important in All the Light We Cannot See. The use of the quote âsharp eyesâ, really shows that you have considered not only how Doerr simply explores the behaviour of each character but also the physical interpretations of how individuals may demonstrate a certain persona within the novel. This focus on character description on top of dialogue adds extra layers to your writing.Â\n\nEncompassing the social paradigms that pervade a womanâs existence, the strength and civilisation of females allow them to traverse a line of unjust behaviours that suppress them. Instead of characterising Jutta as a âpretty girl in a propaganda posterâ, whom the soldier will âfight and die forâ, Doerr proffers the unconventional humanisation of women on the home front to pay tribute to the power of staying true to oneself (7). Despite facing the barbaric reality of âsex crazed torturersâ, Doerr illuminates Juttaâs capacity to âlook them in the eyeâ rather than shy away from them as a meditation on her own morals of (8) âwhat is rightâ. The tragic nature (9) of such abuse is specifically chronicled by Doerr to concatenate (10) the continual brave behaviours Jutta portrays even when succumbing to the line that attempts to draw women away from strength and independence. Further referencing her desire to âlock away memoriesâ of the past in her life after the war, the novel posits the importance of women during a period of inordinate history as a powerful force that remained civil even in times of âabsolute blacknessâ. From the perspective of Fredrickâs mother, Doerr seeks to display how her âfake smile to appear braveâ outlines how many mothers and women had to remain strong for their children, such as Fredrick with brain damage, even though they were so close to falling into a world of sorrow and isolation. A clear segregation between soldiers who thought about âthe men they killedâ and women who were made to âfeel complicit in an unspeakable crimeâ (11) they did not commit overall affirms the sacrifices women made during the war and without such sacrifices and strength the thin line between behavioural acts would be broken.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(7) Here I have included an analysis of Doerrâs message - what he is trying to say or show within his novel. Ultimately an author has a message they seek to share with the world. Providing your own interpretation of certain messages the author may be attempting to send to his readers adds real depth to your writing, showing that you are not only considering the novel itself but the purpose of the author and how this novel came to explore the fundamental ideas of the essay prompt.\n\n(8) This quote directly relates to the keyword: civilised behaviour. Finding quotes that are also specific to your prompt is crucial to producing an essay that flows and has meaning.Â\n\n(9) The use of adjectives within the essay paints the picture of whether an act is civil or uncivil which is ultimately what we are attempting to discuss from the prompt. Here the phrase âtragic natureâ, underpins the essence of unjust behaviours shown by the soldiers.\n\n(10) Concatenate - link/connect ideas together\n\n(11) Comparing aspects within the novel is a great way to show your understanding and how the same theme or idea can be shown in many different ways.Â\n\nIn essence, it is the human response to change that divides individuals from ultimately displaying civil or uncivil acts in the world. Established by Marie Laureâs characterisation as a âblind girlâ who can âproject anything onto the black screen of her imaginationâ, Doerr illuminates her ability to adapt to the âchanging timesâ around her. She is seen to be âcarried away by reveriesâ rather than a plethora of voices who âforgo all comfortsâ and âeat and breathe nationâ. Through the chapter and make-believe game âflying couchâ (12), Marieâs nature to âsurrender firearmsâ with Etienne in their imagination is a symbolic adoption to escape the world around them, hence the uncivilised society they are learning to live in. Doerrâs congruent imagery of Etienneâs changing voice of âdreadâ to âvelvetyâ as he becomes intertwined within âMarieâs braveryâ underpins the ability for individuals to seamlessly cross the line from a lack of cultured behaviour to a world of hope and prosperity. Contrasting this, however, Werner, an individual who was initially curious about âhow the world worksâ, is so âoverwhelmed by how quickly things are changing around [him]â that his âinterest in peaceâ is stripped away and no longer exists due to his inability to change with a changing world. Doerr, therefore, laments the transmogrification of his character as a reflection of his uncivil thoughts and ideals as a soldier, ultimately resulting in his loss of ability to ask questions. This idea places emphasis on Volkheimer receiving Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ in the epilogue (13) where the translation of the bookâs title âFragenâ - to âaskâ in English - is symbolic of the moment Werner decided to âwork, join, confess, dieâ he immediately lost the open mind and curiosity he once had. Ultimately, the dichotomy between these two lives and their opposing character transformations resembles the line between remaining calm or acting out of haste when subject to change.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(12) Analysing not only the game but the whole meaning behind chapters and why Doerr has given them certain names is an interesting avenue to take. Here âflying couchâ not only underpins the imagination of Marie Laure but also symbolises freedom and bravery within just the name itself.\n\n(13) The analysis and evidence used from the epilogue is a crucial part of this paragraph and is significant to Doerrâs novel. Unpacking All the Light We Cannot See, there is a lot of evidence and juicy ideas you can draw from the beginning and end of the novel. Here I have almost analysed the meaning of Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ to the bone; however, this adds a lot of depth to your writing as Iâm sure your ultimate goal is to make your essays as unique as possible?!\n\nAs a project of humanism, Doerr seeks to portray a fine segregation in people's behaviours as the microcosm (14) of what makes the human existence so unique. Following the journeys of individuals who even âsee a century turnââ the novel displays how oneâs past has an immense influence on how their future values, actions and behaviours grow and develop. Further subverting the stereotypical representation of women living in a war, Doerr establishes an acknowledgment of their roles and strength in the face of cruel situations. Ostensibly, it is the human capacity to adapt to change that marks the difference between what is just and unjust in a society that weighs both on a very unstable scale.Â\n\nAnnotationsâ\n\nâ(14)Â Microcosm - a community, place or situation regarded as encapsulating in miniature the characteristics of something much larger.\n\n---\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our All the Light We Cannot See Prompts blog post.

CONVERGENT ideas lead to similar conclusions and messages, while DIVERGENT ideas take us to different conclusions. If youâd like to learn more about this strategy which can help you build more insightful discussions of the text by finding unique points of comparison, then Iâd recommend you check out the LSGâs How To Write A Killer Comparative study guide. In the meantime, letâs start with some CONVERGENT ideas.Â\n\nPower, Race and Oppression\n\nIn both texts, we see racial systems that take power away from Bla(c)k people. In the play, settler-colonialism is a big one. Itâs depicted as a home invasion, a ship taking up a whole harbour, and as a process of devaluing land and ignoring its custodians. This trickles into contemporary institutions (widely understood patterns, rules or structures within society) which perpetuate these dynamics of race and power, such as the police and the media. Oppression is similarly maintained inÂ The Longest Memory, where physical violence, and even just the threat of possible physical violence, is used to enslave African Americans. Plus, all of this racial violence was justified by the socio-economic interests of enslavers. Both texts see Bla(c)k people disempowered by a range of white institutions.Â\n\nCheck out our comparative scene analysis where we explore this theme in more depth.\n\nFamily and Community\n\nOn the other hand, family and the wider community are depicted as a galvanising or healing force in both texts. InÂ The 7 Stages of Grieving, we see how death can bring together entire communities to commiserate, dance and mourn collectively, drawing on one anotherâs strength. Depictions of families in projections of photographs also outline how joy and solidarity can be drawn from community. In the novel, family ties are also important. Whitechapel and Cook build a committed relationship to one another; she even says, âhe proves he loves me every day.â At the same time, Cook also provides her unconditional love and support to Chapel, whose education and eventual relationship with Lydia are facilitated by her.\n\nMemory and Grief\n\nBoth texts show how memory and grief are significant burdens for Bla(c)k people and operate at multiple dimensions. The play is sort of built around the five stages of grief but demonstrates how First Nations grief isnât neat or linear. It can go from highly expressive to numb in moments. It also has roots in Australiaâs genocidal history such that the death of any First Nations personâbut especially eldersâis felt widely. InÂ The Longest Memory, thereâs a physical dimension to Whitechapelâs grief. He earns the name âSour-faceâ because of the worry lines that developed after Chapelâs death. He feels extremely guilty and only after Chapel dies does he realise why Chapel disagreed with him so stubbornly in life. He actually learned the tough lesson that heâd been hoping to teach Chapel.\n\nWhat about divergent ideas? Letâs break down two now.\n\nStruggle and Resistance\n\nBoth texts offer ideas about what the fight against racism might look like, but at times these ideas are more different than similar. InÂ The 7 Stages of Grieving, the main struggle is to be heard and understood. In the play and in real life even, we can see how the media is stacked against First Nations peoples, so their fight is about cutting through the bias and making sure they are fairly represented. InÂ The Longest Memory, the fight against slavery is portrayed quite differently. In a scenario where physical violence was used the way it was in order to oppress, self-emancipation was seen by many as the only path out. Enslaved workers werenât fighting to be heard, they were fighting to survive. Itâs also worth bearing in mind the history of abolition, which happened in Northern states first. This gave them a destination, as well as hope.Â\n\nThe Generation Gap\n\nThe other thing that the texts diverge on is the relationship between parents and children. In the play, family is consistently shown to provide support and community. As the woman speaks about her father and brother, the unconditional love and support between them is palpable. However, the novel depicts a bit more conflictâ Whitechapel argued with Chapel based on his lived experience, and the many young people he had seen be killed for trying to free themselves. However, Chapel was far more committed to freedom than to survival. There isnât necessarily a ârightâ answer either way, but this definitely isnât a tension that we see in the play.\n\nI discuss all these themes in further detail in A Killer Comparative Guide: The 7 Stages of Grieving & The Longest Memory. In this guide, I offer you a deep dive into these two texts through plot summaries and analyses, structural features, critical readings, and best of all, 5 sample A+ essays fully annotated so you can understand exactly how to achieve better marks in your own essays.\n\nEssay Topic Breakdown\n\nAs with all our essay topic breakdowns, we'll follow LSG's THINK and EXECUTE technique, as taught in our How To Write A Killer Text Response. The LSG's THINK and EXECUTE technique follows three steps in the THINK phase - Analyse, Brainstorm, and Create a Plan. Learn more about this technique in this video:\n\nLet's use essay topic #1 from the section below.\n\nCompare the ways in which the two texts explore the possibility of social change.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nâSocial changeâ is a key term here, but the word âpossibilityâ also stands out to me. Social changeâprobably towards equalityâisnât something that just happens, so the prompt also wants us to think about how to get there, and whether that seems achievable in the contexts of these stories. The prompt is phrased as an instruction (âCompareâ) which invites you to analyse both texts together, but you totally knew that already!\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nIâd probably start by brainstorming what exactly needs to be changed. In each text, we see institutions and structures which are violent and harmfulâfrom the play, police and the media, and from the novel, the economy itself. However, these institutions are upheld in different ways, and require different mechanisms of changeâwhile the play emphasises grieving and unity, the novel focuses more on emancipation.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nBecause weâve got two sets of ideas for each text, letâs alternate the texts (Essay Structure 1, as discussed in How To Write A Killer Comparative) to cover these ideas in four paragraphs.\n\nP1: Starting with The 7 Stages of Grieving, social change is required at the institutional level. Police and the media are racially biased, and Aboriginal people arenât given a platform to tell their stories. Reconciliation needs to include Aboriginal voices.\n\nP2: With The Longest Memory, social change is required across the economy that depends on enslaving people and stealing their labour, while others have an economic interest in the status quo.\n\nP3: Because of this, change seems more possible in the play, and we start seeing it happen towards the end, as the ice thaws and people, Bla(c)k and white, march across the bridge together.\n\nP4: On the other hand, emancipation is seen as the only path to change in the novel, as intergenerational social pressures among the enslaving class in the South are insurmountable.\n\nSo our contention will probably revolve around the idea that âsocial changeâ means different things in each text as social inequalities exist at different levels (Paragraph 1&2)âas such, the âpossibilitiesâ for that change look different as well (P3&4), particularly the extent to which white people can be involved in that change.\n\nIf you'd like to see the sample A+ essay we wrote up for this essay topic, then you might want to check out our A Killer Comparative Guide: The 7 Stages of Grieving & The Longest Memory!\n\nSample Essay TopicsÂ\n\nNow it's your turn!

You're moments away from having to deliver your 5-6 minute long oral to all of your classmates and your teacher, and you're still trying to memorise that one bit that you just can't seem to get down pat. It sucks.\n\nFor many VCE English students, the oral presentation is the scariest part of the course; itâs often also the first.\n\nDoing a speech can indeed be dauntingâ youâre marked in real time, you canât go back and edit mistakes, and the writing part itself is only half the battle. Nonetheless, the oral SAC can also be one of the more dynamic and engaging tasks you complete in VCE English, and thereâs plenty of ways to make it more interesting and also more manageable for yourself.\n\nWeâll break the whole process down into three parts (donât worry, one of these will be the delivery itself) and have a look at ways to tackle each; hopefully, youâll feel more empowered to give it a go on your own terms. Don't forget to also check out Our Ultimate Guide to Oral Presentations for everything you need to know for Oral Presentations.\n\nPart One: Choosing a good topic\n\n(In this sectionâresearching events & issues, topic ideas)\n\nFor a bit of a head start on this step, be sure to check out our blog post filled with Oral Presentation Topics for 2020. It's one of our best kept secrets!\n\nIn the study design, the description thatâs given for the Oral Presentation is:\n\nâA point of view presented in oral form using sound argument and persuasive language. The point of view should relate to an issue that has appeared in the media since 1 September of the previous year.â\n\nBesides this restriction on how current/recent your issue is, the expectations themselves for this task are pretty standard (and therefore pretty broad): you\n\nselect a topic or point of view\n\nresearch arguments and supporting evidence; and\n\nposition the audience accordingly in your speech\n\nGetting started on this first part can be tricky though, especially if you want to choose something a bit more original or fresh.\n\nIn any case, the first thing you need is an event. As a reminder, an event in the VCE English context is anything that happens which also generates opinionated media coverageâso, itâs not just an event but it has to be an event that people have published opinions about, and they have to have been published since September 1.\n\nYou might wonder why we donât go to the issue straight away. Hereâs a hypothetical to illustrate: if you asked me to name an issue, the best I could probably come up with off the top of my head is climate change. However, if you asked me to name an event, Iâd pretty easily recall the bushfiresâsomething much more concrete which a) has generated specific and passionate opinions in the media; and b) can easily be linked to a wider issue such as climate change.\n\nSo where do you find an event? If you canât think of a particularly interesting one right away, you could always try Wikipedia. Seriously, Wikipedia very helpfully has pages of things that happened in specific years in specific countries, so â2019 in Australiaâ might well be a starting point. The ABC news archive is also really helpful since you can pick dates or periods of time and see a good mix of news events from then.\n\nI wouldnât underestimate your own memory here either. Maybe you attended the School Strike for Climate and/or you feel vaguely disappointed in the government. Maybe there was something else happening in the news you remember (even though it is often about the environment these days). It doesnât have to be from the news thoughâmaybe there was a movie or TV show you watched recently that you have thoughts about. You could really do a speech on any of these, as long as you suspect there might be recent, opinionated media coverage.\n\nOnly once you have an event should you look for an issue. This will be a specific debate that comes out of the event, and can usually be framed as a âwhether-or-notâ question. The bushfires, for example, might generate debate around whether or not the Australian government is doing enough to combat climate change, whether or not Scott Morrison has fulfilled his duties as Prime Minister, whether or not itâs appropriate to discuss policy already when people are still grieving. All of these issues are going to be more current and more focused than just âclimate changeâ, so pick one that resonates for your speech. For a list of 2019-20 issue-debate breakdowns (i.e. topic ideas!), give this a read!\n\nFrom there, you might delve a little deeper into viewpoints around your chosen issue, and youâd do this mostly by reading opinion or analysis articles (rather than hard news reports). Opinion is great to see what other people are thinking, and could help you bolster or reinforce your own arguments, whereas analysis is good to get a little deeper into the implications of and evidence behind the issue. The actual contention itself comes lastâeven though you might already have an idea what you think about the issue, youâll be best prepared to articulate it after doing the research first.\n\nPart Two: Writing a good speech\n\n(In this sectionâregister/tone selection, personas, openings, how formal you need to be, drafting & rehearsing)\n\nFor this part of the task, Iâd keep in mind a specific snippet of its description: the need to use sound argument and persuasive language.\n\nTo be fair, persuasive language mightnât necessarily be something you actively think about when you write persuasivelyâyou wouldnât ever really be like âhey, this is a great spot to include an appeal to compassion.â However, while you donât need to start now, itâs good to have in mind a general register for your speech before you start. Itâs one of the first things you might analyse in a written essay for good reasonâitâs broad and it sets the tone for your argument/s.\n\nWith the bushfires for instance, you might contend that even though grief is a strong emotion, it should also be a trigger for resolute, permanent policy reform. But will you come from a frustrated, this-is-what-weâve-been-saying-for-years register, or a compassionate look-at-the-damage-caused register, or an assertive, we-need-to-bring-the-community-together-first register?\n\nMaybe you can incorporate a bit of each, or maybe (probably) there are more options, but in any case, making this decision first will help with stringing together arguments and incorporating more persuasive language techniques (PLTs). Note that most PLTs can be used across a number of registers, but there are some that might work more effectively with some of these.\n\nFor example:\n\nRegister Arguments PLTs Frustrated Climate activists have been stating the facts for years now; we suffered more extensive damage this bushfire season than ever before and our politicians are still clinging to coal; if this doesnât trigger change, what will? Statistics + other evidence Attacks (on government, climate denialists etc.) Calls to action Emotive language Compassionate Thereâs been so much damage, and grief is an understandable and necessary response; if we donât do something now though, how many more years will we have to suffer through the same (if not worse)? Appeals to sympathy Anecdotes (especially if you adopt a persona) Rhetorical questions Imagery Assertive Never before has the community been so united on combating an issue; even international communities are involved; we have to take advantage of how the issue has brought everyone together to enact meaningful, permanent change now. Inclusive language Generalisations (ALL Australians want change) Appeals to community and/or hope, optimism Repetition/emphasis\n\nThese are things youâll have to think about for your written explanations, and might also help you shape future research if you need to shore up the speech a little more.\n\nSomething you may consider as well is adopting a persona, that is a character and a context for your speech. You donât have to, but it may help you get started. It can be hard to just write a speech from scratch, but if youâre the mayor of a township affected by the fires and youâre outlining a course of action, itâll help with your register and outlook.\n\nOpenings in general can be tricky though. Try to avoid stating your event, issue and contention outrightâthe audience doesnât need to know that ârecently, Australia experienced a horrific bushfire season and Iâm going to talk about why now is the time to act on climate change.â Theyâll figure it out.\n\nInstead, try to start with something that clearly communicates your register and/or persona (if you have one). If youâre a frustrated climate activist, start by illustrating the historical patterns of bushfires getting worse and worse. If youâre a compassionate community-builder, start with anecdotes of the damage. If youâre an assertive leader, explain who you are, what your experience is and how you want to create change. Donât worry if you feel like the issue wonât be clear enoughâagain, theyâll figure it out!\n\nThe opening also sets the bar for formality in your speech, and itâs honestly up to you how formal youâll want to be. As a rule of thumb, donât be so formal that you canât use contractions (such as âyouâllâ and âcanâtâ)âavoid those in essays for sure, but theyâre a natural part of speaking and itâll feel strange if you donât use them.\n\nIâd also recommend you draft and rehearse in front of others, highlighting areas where you think are the weakest and asking them for specific advice on those sections at the end. Having specific questions to ask, such as âshould I include more data/quantitative evidence in x section?â or âis this specific appeal to x obvious enough?â, also means you get better feedback (since these are much easier to answer than âWas that fine?â).\n\nPart Three: Delivering an engaging presentation\n\n(In this sectionâbody language, eye contact, rehearse rehearse rehearse, tone variation)\n\nMost of you probably find this the most daunting part of the SACâhonestly, me tooâbut this is the part with the most tried-and-tested tips for success.\n\nWith regard to body language, stand with your feet shoulder width apart and, more importantly donât move your legs. Especially if youâre nervous, swaying or shuffling will be noticeable and make you appear more nervousâwhen you practise, pay attention to the lower half of your body and train it to stay still if possible. That being said, do use your arms for gestures. Those are more natural and will help engage the audience, though donât overdo it eitherâusually, holding cue cards in one hand frees up the other but also stops you from going overboard.\n\nAnd cue cards brig us up to another important considerationâeye contact. Hold cue cards in one hand as high as you can without it feeling uncomfortable. This means you donât have to take your eyes away from the audience for too long or too noticeably to check your notes.\n\nOf course, knowing your speech better means having to check your notes less frequently. When I did my speech, Iâd read it out aloud to myself 3-5 times a day for a week or two in advance, which made me feel like I was going insane but also meant that my speech was basically memorised. The cue cards were there in case of emergency, but I really didnât need them at all. Absolutely make sure to rehearse your speech.\n\nFurther, when you rehearse, try to pretend that youâre actually delivering the speech. This means:\n\nlooking up ahead\n\nholding the cue cards in the right spot; and\n\nnot just reading the words but speaking as if to an audience.\n\nThis last point is really importantâtone variation might come naturally to some but not to others. I always found that building it into rehearsal helped with getting it consistent and natural. Tone variation involves things like emphasising certain words, using pauses or slowing down for effect, or modifying volume. Incorporating some of these elementsâeven writing them into your notes by bolding/italicising/underliningâwill help you break out of monotony and make the speech more engaging as well. Be sure to emphasise things like emotive language and any evidence you might use to illustrate your arguments.\n\nAnd one last thingâdonât speak too quickly! Easier said than done, but often the icing on the cake for a speech that is memorable for the right reasons.\n\nâ\n\nWondering where to go from here?

Plot Summaries\n\nSummary - The Hate RaceÂ\n\nMaxine Beneba Clarkeâs seminal novel, The Hate Race, follows the childhood and adolescence of its author, who is the main protagonist. The book is a memoir, meaning that it is based around a recollection of her life and filtered through her psyche and experiences.\n\nThe book begins with Clarkeâs family, British citizens of Afro-Carribean descent, moving to Sydney, New South Wales. They settle in the town of Kellyville, which is known as a âwhite picketâ community. Although these communities largely don't exist anymore, what they once described was suburban environments where only Anglo-Australians lived. As you can probably imagine, this immediately caused problems for Clarkeâs family, with suspicion from neighbours and racist interactions with other kids in the neighbourhood.\n\nClarke initially focuses on her experiences in kindergarten, revealing how prejudice and discrimination can be inculcated (meaning, âtaught toâ) in children even from such a tender age. Clarke meets her first tormenter - Carlita Allen. Carlita makes every effort to exclude Clarke from participation in usual preschool activities, hurling insults across playgrounds and calling her âdirtyâ. Literally, of course, Carlita is referring to Clarkeâs black skin colour, but, metaphorically, it reflects the deeply hateful implication that anyone with a dark complexion is inherently inferior and lesser than white Australians.\n\nThe bullying doesnât stop by the time Clarke reaches primary school. In fact, it intensifies, aided and abetted by teachers who consistently turn a blind eye to the constant, gut-wrenching racial abuse. One of the most salient (meaning, âimportantâ) scenes arises when Clarke is asked by a teacher what her parents do for a living. Upon informing the teacher that her mother is an actor, and her father is a Mathematics Professor - the first British citizen of Afro-Carribean descent to attend a British university - she is met with the patronising assumption that she must be lying. Surely black people wouldnât have the emotional and intellectual intelligence to perform such high-powered jobs? Clarke also develops eczema during her primary school years, leaving patches of lighter-coloured skin covering her face, and a newfound hope that, bit by bit, God is answering her prayers and making her white.\n\nIn high school, the racist rot sets in even further. Clarke develops a new habit for scratching her skin at night to the point of bleeding and bruising. Looking back at this experience, Clarke theorises that this was her bodyâs way of expressing her extreme discomfort with being black. It gives us a picture of how horrific racism can truly be, and the ways in which it forces minorities into believing that thereâs something wrong with them, instead of there being something wrong with the people hurling abuse in the first instance!\n\nIt is this stage of her life when Clarke deals with one of the most difficult parts of being a minority in a majority white country. Through her interactions with teachers, friends and boyfriends alike, she becomes deeply angry at those people who abhor racism themselves, but seem unable to step in when racist events are actually occurring. Clarke also deals with more nuanced experiences of racism - people who donât intend to be racist, but end up making insensitive comments anyway. Whether intentional or not, these comments still hurt, and are still part of the challenges of growing up black in a white country.\n\nNonetheless, Clarke continues to rise above the odds, becoming a prolific high school debater, maintaining her position at the top of the academic cohort, and forming a small but tight-knit group of friends whom she can trust.Â\n\nClarkeâs recollection of her childhood ends on a relatively abrupt note, with Clarke returning home to realise that her father has left the family for another woman. In a note to the family, he provides no explanation other than that he had a secret affair for many years. Suddenly, Clarke, her brothers, sisters and mother are left to pick up the pieces.\n\nIn the epilogue, Clarke is now an adult with a child of her own. Walking down Melbourneâs North Road, she reflects on the challenges and opportunities to which her child will be witness. Clarke portrays it as the dual sadness and happiness of knowing that, in Australia, her children will surely have access to more opportunity than in most parts of the world - but it will come at a cost. Namely, they will also have to contend with the remaining undercurrent of racism that, even now, still seeps through Australian society.\n\nThe unsatisfying end to the novel reflects the nature of racism and the experience of a minority growing up in a white country itself: there is no happy ending. Rather, life becomes a series of painful incidents interspersed with minor victories; those who stand up against racism, those who fail to do so and the hundreds of thousands of Australians who will forever grapple with a society that sees them as âlesser thanâ due to the colour of their skin.Â\n\nSummary - Charlieâs Country\n\nCharlieâs Country, an Australian movie directed by Dutch-Australian Rolf De Heer, follows the story of Charlie, a First Nations man living in late-2000s Australia.\n\nThe movie is set in the wake of the 2007 Northern Territory Intervention. As a bit of quick context, this was an action taken by the Commonwealth Government under Coalition Prime Minister John Howard to send Australian Defence Force troops into the Northern Territory. It came in response to the âLittle Children are Sacredâ report, which raised allegations of child sexual abuse and neglect of children in Aboriginal communities. The intervention also involved restricting alcohol consumption, quarantining a portion of welfare payments to Indigenous residents (with the justification that this would prevent it being spent on alcohol, pornography, cigarettes, etc.) and hefty fines as well as jail sentences for those forced to comply.\n\nIt is important to note that, throughout the whole intervention, not a single person was prosecuted for child sexual abuse or any related offence. Nonetheless, this intervention had real world, drastic consequences - and thatâs exactly what Charlieâs Country explores.\n\nAt the time of de Heerâs film, Charlie lives in a remote Indigenous community. Signs of the intervention are all around - alcohol is banned from most communities, many individuals face personal bans on procuring alcohol, police officers dot the streets and citizens live under constant watch. Charlie, on a surface level, is a fairly happy-go-lucky individual; he exchanges jokes with police, is friendly with other elders and people in his community and doesnât seem to do much else.\n\nAs always with a movie like this - thereâs a bigger story behind this all! Rolf de Heer takes us through an increasingly concerning image of Aboriginal communities in the wake of the intervention. Charlie visits his local housing officer and is unable to obtain a house. Here, we see that Charlie is willing to work and wants stable accommodation, but the government is unwilling to provide.\n\nGoing on a hunting trip with his friend, âBlack Peteâ, the two are stopped by police and have their guns, as well as the water buffalo they killed, confiscated. Yet again, two Indigenous men try to provide for themselves - but are stopped by a legal system more concerned with rules and procedure than listening to First Nations communities themselves. Charlie decides heâs had enough of having his every move and action monitored, and takes a stolen police car into the bush.\n\nAbandoning the car, he tries to live amongst nature for an unidentified amount of time. Cooking fish, performing traditional First Nations dances, painting on the bark and looking for shelter, Charlie finally appears to be home. Yet, as usual, itâs too good to be true - the extreme cold makes Charlie incredibly sick, and, before we know it, he wakes up in a Darwin hospital. After refusing further treatment from the white doctors who fail to understand Charlieâs situation and why he is so angry at whatâs happened to him, the predictable cycle begins again: Charlie returns to his community, they all share alcohol as a way of coping with their current situation and flee when the police come running to confiscate the liquor.\n\nCharlie isnât civil with the police this time. In a fit of anger - an outburst of emotion after decades upon decades of control and being denied access to any opportunity - he picks up a bat and smashes the police officerâs car window. Brutally beaten into submission, Charlie is imprisoned as the police officer remarks that he should never have 'gone soft on a blackfellaâ.Â\n\nDragged before the courts, Charlie is imprisoned for assault. When the judge asks him to make a comment, he gives a lengthy speech in his native language. For de Heer, this acts as a symbolic assertion of the First Nationsâ rights to their own culture, and a proud statement against the many governments that have continually placed barriers in the way of Indigenous Australians having the same opportunities as any one of us.\n\nEventually, Charlie is released on parole. He expresses a deep desire to go home - but also a sense of defeat. He resolves, in the end, to believe that even if he will always live under the watchful eyes of the Australian Government, he can at least fight back and contribute by doing his bit to maintain the many cultures of our First Nations Peoples. Charlie teaches young Indigenous boys traditional dances, speaking proudly of when he performed a dancing ceremony for Queen Elizabeth in 1973 at the Sydney Opera House.\n\nThe movie ends with Charlie staring mournfully into the camera, almost looking at the audience themselves. There seems to be no happiness in his eyes - nothing left but a sense of sadness and resignation. I know that, upon approaching the end of the film, I started to feel the same sadness that Charlie so evidently shows us. Itâs a different type of emotion; one centered around the pain of knowing that we live in a country that still has not made peace with its past, and refuses to listen to the First Nations Peoples who know it best.\n\nCharlieâs Country exposes to us that Australia is a country where, even today, our First Nations citizens are not treated as equals. As such, de Heerâs film is a stark reminder that this state of affairs is not good enough - and that the responsibility for change doesnât just lie with politicians and decision-makers. Itâs our job too: and failure is not an option.\n\n2. Themes, Motifs and Key Ideas\n\nThrough discussing Themes, Motifs and Key Ideas, weâll gain a clearer unde"
