Amen. Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. It has been (how long?) since my last confession and these are my sins…(confess all your sins…be not afraid!).\n\nFather will give you a penance and then ask you to pray the Act of Contrition. Feel free to use this one:\n\nACT OF CONTRITION\n\nO my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended You, and I detest all my sins because of Your just punishments, but most of all because they offend You, my God, who are all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Your grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen.\n\nThe priest will then say the prayer of forgiveness (absolution).\n\nIf your penance was to say some prayers please immediately go back to your seat and say your prayers.\n\nThat’s it! You’re forgiven!\n\nIndividual Examination of Conscience – 7 Deadly Sins\n\nPride: “Pride is an untrue opinion of ourselves, an untrue idea of what we are not.” Have I a superior attitude in thinking, or speaking or acting?
