        "text": "Facts\n\nMeyer, a teacher, taught German to a 10-year-old child. He was convicted of violating a Nebraska law that prohibited teaching any language other than English.\n\nOpinions\n\nMajority\n\nJames Clark McReynolds (Author)\n\nWilliam Howard Taft\n\nJoseph McKenna\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\n\nWillis Van Devanter\n\nLouis Dembitz Brandeis\n\nPierce Butler\n\nEdward Terry Sanford\n\nGeorge Sutherland\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment vision of liberty includes the right of a teacher to teach German and the right of parents to control the upbringing of their children as they see fit. While the state has a legitimate interest in encouraging the growth of a homogenous population that can engage in discussions of civic matters, the means that it has chosen to pursue this objective is excessive.\n\nCase Commentary\n\nThis law probably derived from the First World War, when nationalist sentiment ran high. It could be constitutional during wartime or emergency to ban teaching foreign languages in the interest of protecting American ideals."
