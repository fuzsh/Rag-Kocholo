        "text": "Conscience has been succinctly described as the \"soul distinguishing between what is morally good and bad, prompting to do the former and shun the latter.\"\n\nWebster defines conscience as the sense or consciousness of the moral goodness or blameworthiness of one’s own conduct, intentions, or character together with a feeling of obligation to do right or be good.\n\nIn addition to an innate awareness of God’s law, men have a warning system that activates when they choose to ignore or disobey that law. It's that instinctive, built-in sense of right and wrong that activates guilt.\n\nAll mankind has an innate inner sense of right and wrong which Scripture refers to as conscience. And so sociologist have encountered in all cultures a sense of sin and fear of judgment which leads that culture to make some attempt to appease whatever gods are feared and this built in \"moral/ethical radar detector\" (so to speak) is what Paul is alludes to in Romans 2.\n\nConscience is like a sundial\n\nWhen the truth of God shines on it,\n\nIt points in the right direction.\n\nWhere is your \"sundial\" pointing today dear reader?\n\nConscience is a trustworthy compass when God's Word is your true north.\n\nA good conscience is one of the best friends you'll ever have.\n\nTo ignore your conscience is to invite trouble.\n\nConscience is a safe guide when guided by God's Word.\n\nA clear conscience is a soft pillow.\n\nIf God’s Word guides your conscience, let your conscience be your guide.\n\nIf you can't hear God speaking, check the volume control of your conscience.\n\nF F Bruce - Paul uses conscience (and perhaps he was the first to do so) in the sense of an independent witness within, which examines and passes judgment on one’s conduct. In Christians this examination and judgment should be specially accurate because their conscience is enlightened by the Holy Spirit (cf. Ro 9:1).\n\nJohn MacArthur recounts an interesting illustration of the human conscience - It is reported that a tribe in Africa had an unusual but effective way to test the guilt of an accused person. A group of suspects would be lined up and the tongue of each would be touched with a hot knife. If saliva was on the tongue the blade would sizzle but cause little pain. But if the tongue was dry, the blade would stick and create a vicious, searing burn. The tribe knew that a sense of guilt tends to make a person’s mouth dry, and a seared tongue therefore was taken as proof of guilt. The making of such a dry mouth is, of course, the work of the conscience. (MacArthur, J: Romans 1-8. Chicago: Moody Press)\n\nPritchard offers a hypothetical illustration - This week I read an ancient tale about a court magician who wanted to give his king a very special gift. After much work, he designed a magic ring which had a very special property. Every time the king had an evil thought or an unworthy ambition, the ring began to shrink tightly around his finger, thus warning him of impending danger. The human conscience is like that. It is a ring around the heart, which tightens every time we begin to violate our own standards. It warns of impending danger. We disregard our conscience at our own peril. And, Paul says, every man has a conscience, a \"ring around the heart.\" No one can say, \"I've never done wrong,\" because every man has violated his conscience at least once, and most of us many times. That's why God can fairly judge the Gentiles. The law \"written in their hearts\" will be the standard by which they will be judged. Their guilty consciences will one day rise up to condemn them.\" (Romans 2:1-16: Mr. I.M. Okay Meets His Maker)\n\nConscience is like an inner judge that accuses and condemns us when we have done wrong and approves and commends us when we have done right. The conscience varies in sensitivity, depending on the degree of one’s knowledge of and feeling about right and wrong. The person who has considerable knowledge of God’s Word will have a more sensitive conscience than someone who has never had opportunity to know Scripture. Furthermore, repeated sinning hardens the conscience so that it becomes “seared” like scar tissue (1Ti 4:2). To continually reject God’s truth causes the conscience to become progressively calloused, hardened and less sensitive to sin, as if covered with layers of unspiritual scar tissue. There is an interesting parallel in tropical medicine which has discovered that the gross disfigurement so commonly seen in individuals with leprosy is not due to the leprosy bacterium per se, but is secondary to the organism's destruction of the nerve fibers that convey a sense of pain and touch. Unprotected by the body's natural warning signals the leper repeatedly injures the extremity with cuts, burns, infections, etc, all without even realizing that he is injured! This is exactly the picture of the seared conscience which becomes insensitive to sin and may eventually cease sending warning signals. Thus, though God has His work within every man resulting in conscience, man can corrupt that work, so that the \"sin sensitivity\" rating of the conscience varies from person to person.\n\nConscience (4893) (suneidesis is derived from sun/syn = with + eido = know) literally means a \"knowing with\", a co-knowledge with oneself or a being of one's own witness in the sense that one's own conscience \"takes the stand\" as the chief witness, testifying either to one's innocence or guilt. It describes the witness borne to one's conduct by that faculty by which we apprehend the will of God.\n\nThe Greek noun suneidesis is the exact counterpart of the Latin con-science, “a knowing with,” a shared or joint knowledge. It is our awareness of ourselves in all the relationships of life, especially ethical relationships. We have ideas of right and wrong; and when we perceive their truth and claims on us, and will not obey, our souls are at war with themselves and with the law of God\n\nSuneidesis is that process of thought which distinguishes what it considers morally good or bad, commending the good, condemning the bad, and so prompting to do the former and avoid the latter.\n\nGilbrant on suneidesis in Classical Greek - Formally a compound made up of sun (4713), “with, together,” and eidēsis, “knowledge,” suneidēsis (cf. the parent verb sunoida [4774]) means “knowledge, communication, information.” Sometimes the term occurs in legal contexts of witnesses who share testimony. In a second, reflexive sense, suneidēsis signifies “consciousness” (in a neutral sense) and from that it means “inner consciousness,” i.e., “conscience.” “Conscience” particularly carries moral implications; it is a “knowledge” of right from wrong (Liddell-Scott; cf. Maurer, “suneidēsis,” Kittel, 7:898-902). Maurer concludes that suneidēsis as “conscience” generally has a negative nuance, because self-examination usually results in condemnation (ibid., 7:900). This is especially true among pre-Christian Greek authors, although Roman writers might speak of a “good” or “clear” conscience (Hahn, “Conscience,” Colin Brown, 1:348f.).

Rather, it means that the underlying direction and motive of life is to obey and please God, so that acts of sin are habitually recognized as such and faced before God (1Jn 1:9, cp David's attitude Ps 139:23 24, cp Ps 19:13-note) Spurgeon commenting on these passages in Ps 139 says…\n\nHe (David) will have God Himself search him, and search him thoroughly, till every point of his being is known, and read, and understood; for he is sure that even by such an investigation there will be found in him no complicity with wicked men. He challenges the fullest investigation, the innermost search: he had need be a true man who can put himself deliberately into such a crucible. Yet we may each one desire such searching; for it would be a terrible calamity to us for sin to remain in our hearts unknown and undiscovered.\n\nTry me, and know my thoughts. Exercise any and every test upon me. By fire and by water let me be examined. Read not alone the desires of my heart, but the fugitive thoughts of my head. Know with all penetrating knowledge all that is or has been in the chambers of my mind. What a mercy that there is one being who can know us to perfection! He is intimately at home with us. He is graciously inclined towards us, and is willing to bend His omniscience to serve the end of our sanctification. Let us pray as David did, and let us be as honest as he. We cannot hide our sin: salvation lies the other way, in a plain discovery of evil, and an effectual severance from it.\n\nAnd see if there be any wicked way in me. See whether there be in my heart, or in my life, any evil habit unknown to myself (Ed: cp a \"clean conscience\"). If there be such an evil way, take me from it, take it from me. No matter how dear the wrong may have become, nor how deeply prejudiced I may have been in its favour, be pleased to deliver me therefrom altogether, effectually, and at once, that I may tolerate nothing which is contrary to thy mind. As I hate the wicked in their way, so would I hate every wicked way in myself.\n\nAnd lead me in the way everlasting. If thou hast introduced me already to the good old way, be pleased to keep me in it, and conduct me further and further along it. It is a way which thou hast set up of old, it is based upon everlasting principles, and it is the way in which immortal spirits will gladly run for ever and ever. There will be no end to it world without end. It lasts for ever, and they who are in it last for ever. Conduct me into it, O Lord, and conduct me throughout the whole length of it. By thy providence, by thy word, by thy grace, and by thy Spirit, lead me evermore.\n\nThink and be careful what thou art within,\n\nFor there is sin in the desire of sin:\n\nThink and be thankful, in a different case,\n\nFor there is grace in the desire of grace.\n\n--John Byron, 1691-1763.\n\nDwight Edwards explains that \"A \"clear conscience\" consists in being able to say that there is no one (God or man) whom I have knowingly offended and not tried to make it right (either by asking forgiveness or restoration or both). ). Acts 24:16. Christ spoke of this very issue in the Sermon on the Mount where He made it clear that our priestly service must be done with a clear conscience to be acceptable before God. \"Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother and then come and offer your gift.\" Mt. 5:23 24 25-note. We are being told here that a clear conscience must precede priestly service. (2 Timothy Call to Completion)\n\nPaul wanted Timothy to have no doubt that he endured his present physical afflictions, as he had countless others, because of his unswerving faithfulness to the Lord, not as a consequence of unfaithful, ungodly living. So as Paul neared his death, he could testify that his conscience did not accuse or condemn him. His guilt was forgiven, and his devotion was undivided. To continually reject God’s truth causes the conscience to become progressively less sensitive to sin, as if covered with layers of unspiritual scar tissue. Paul’s conscience was clear, sensitive, & responsive to its convicting voice. Click on the books below to study the NT picture of conscience.\n\nConscience is like a window that let's in the light. When the window becomes soiled, the light gradually becomes darkness. Once conscience is defiled (Titus 1:15-note), it gradually gets worse, and eventually it may be so \"seared\" that it has no sensitivity at all (1Ti 4:2). Then it becomes an \"evil conscience\" (He 10:22-note), one that functions just the opposite of a good conscience (1Pe 3:16-note).\n\nJ C Ryle in his comments on a woman caught in adultery (Jn 8:1-11) speaks of\n\nThe power of conscience. We read of the woman's accusers, that when they heard our Lord's appeal, \"being convicted by their own conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even into the last.\" Wicked and hardened as they were, they felt something within which made them cowards. Fallen as human nature is, God has taken care to leave within every man a witness that will be heard.\n\nConscience is a most important part of our inward man, and plays a most prominent part in our spiritual history. It cannot save us. It never yet led any one to Christ. It is blind, and liable to be misled. It is lame and powerless, and cannot guide us to heaven. Yet conscience is not to be despised. It is the minister's best friend, when he stands up to rebuke sin from the pulpit. It is the mother's best friend, when she tries to restrain her children from evil and quicken them to good. It is the teacher's best friend, when he presses home on boys and girls their moral duties. Happy is he who never stifles his conscience, but strives to keep it tender! Still happier is he who prays to have it enlightened by the Holy Spirit, and sprinkled with Christ's blood. (John - chapter 8)\n\n(Ryle in \"Looking Unto Jesus\") We need inward peace. So long as our conscience is asleep, deadened by indulged sin, or dulled and stupefied by incessant pursuit of the things of this world—so long can that man get on tolerably well without peace with God. But once let conscience open its eyes, and shake itself, and rise, and move—and it will make the stoutest child of Adam feel ill at ease. The irrepressible thought that this life is not all—that there is a God, and a judgment, and a something after death, an undiscovered destiny from which no traveler returns—that thought will come up at times in every man's mind, and make him long for inward peace.\n\nIt is easy to write brave words about \"eternal hope,\" and strew the path to the grave with flowers. Such theology is naturally popular: the world loves to have it so. But after all, there is something deep down in the heart of hearts of most men, which must be satisfied. The strongest evidence of God's eternal truth, is the universal conscience of mankind. Who is there among us all, who can sit down and think over the days that are past—school days, and college days, and days of middle life, their countless things left undone that ought to have been done, and done that ought not to have been done—who, I say, can think over it all without shame, if indeed he does not turn from the review with disgust and terror, and refuse to think at all? We all need peace. (Ryle Looking Unto Jesus!)\n\n(Ryle in \"Without Christ\") Moreover, to be \"without Christ\" is to be without peace. Every man has a conscience within him, which must be satisfied before he can be truly happy. So long as this conscience is asleep or half dead, so long, no doubt, he gets along pretty well. But as soon as a man’s conscience wakes up, and he begins to think of past sins and present failings and future judgment, at once he finds out that he needs something to give him inward rest. But what can do it? Repenting and praying and Bible reading, and church going, and sacrament receiving, and self–mortification may be tried, and tried in vain. They never yet took off the burden from anyone’s conscience. And yet peace must be had!\n\nThere is only one thing can give peace to the conscience, and that is the blood of Jesus Christ sprinkled on it. A clear understanding that Christ’s death was an actual payment of our debt to God, and that the merit of that death is made over to man when he believes, is the grand secret of inward peace. It meets every craving of conscience. It answers every accusation. It calms every fear. It is written \"These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me you might have peace.\" \"He is our peace.\" \"Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\" (Jn 16:33; Eph 2:14; Ro 5:1). We have peace through the blood of His cross: peace like a deep mine—peace like an ever–flowing stream. But \"without Christ\" we are without peace. (Without Christ)\n\nJ C Philpot writes that there can be\n\nthere is a receiving of the gospel as the word of men into the natural CONSCIENCE; for there is a natural conscience as well as a spiritual conscience. This is very evident from the language of the apostle when speaking of the Gentiles–\n\n\"Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or excusing one another.\" (Ro 2:15.)\n\nAnd do we not read of those in the case of the woman taken in adultery, who were\n\n\"convicted by their own conscience, and went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even to the last.\" (Jn 8:9.)\n\nThe apostle also speaks of\n\n\"commending himself to every man's conscience, in the sight of God.\" (2Co 4:2.)\n\nNow as he preached to thousands, he could not have done this unless there was a conscience in every man, as well as in every good man. Scarcely anything seems to approach the work of grace so nearly as this; and yet we see in the cases of Saul, Ahab, and Herod, that there may be the deepest convictions of conscience and yet no saving conversion to God. Thus there is a receiving the gospel into the natural conscience, producing moral convictions, and a work that seems at first sight to bear a striking similarity to the work of God upon the soul; and yet the whole may be a mere imitation of grace, a movement of nature floating upon the surface of the mind, and at times touching upon the domain of conscience, yet not springing out of the word of God as brought with a divine power into the heart. (The Word of Men and the Word of God)\n\nArchibald Alexander - Peace of conscience is a fruit of reconciliation with God. The blood which reconciles, when sprinkled on the conscience, produces a sweet peace which can be obtained in no other way. If the atonement of Christ satisfies the law which condemned us, and we are assured that this atonement is accepted for us, conscience, which before condemned, as being the echo of the law, is now pacified. (The Peace of God)\n\nJohn Calvin - The torture of a bad conscience is the hell of a living soul… There is no greater torment than an evil conscience.\n\nSee excellent message by Adrian Rogers - A Clean Conscience\n\nTimothy Lin - In the mid 1950’s near Ashville, NC, an adult male walked into the police station and openly confessed to a murder he had committed 13 years earlier. He gave the deceased person’s name and related to the authorities how he had murdered this person by shooting him in the back of the head with an arrow. The police reviewed his story from their files and found that the local coroner had ruled the deceased man’s death to be from natural causes. However, when they dug up the dead man’s remains, they found a hole in the base of his skull made by an arrow. The murderer was brought to justice, not by the police, but by his own conscience… At the Children’s Hospital seven-year-old Jimmy was a constant troublemaker. One day a weekly visitor who knew him well said to him, “Jimmy, if you are a good boy for a week, I will give you a quarter when I come back.” A week later she again stood by Jimmy’s bed and said, “Jimmy, I am not going to ask the nurse how you have behaved. You must tell me yourself. Do you deserve to have the quarter?” There was a moment’s silence. Then from under the sheets came a small voice saying, “Gimme a penny.” This illustrates that conscience speaks very clearly even in small children, (Conscience: The Voice of God Within - {I'm not sure I fully agree with all his points - Be a Berean} - Lin has more on conscience on page 50-54 in Genesis - Biblical Theology)\n\nKenneth Osbeck writes that \"The conscience has been described as the “rudder of the soul” or the believer’s “principle within.” One of the prime responsibilities of Christian living is to keep the conscience clear as to the things of God so that we might live worthy lives before our fellowmen. But the conscience must be continually enlightened and developed by an exposure to God’s Word if it is to serve as a reliable guide for our lives. A conscience that is allowed to become hardened and insensitive to sin will ultimately lead to spiritual and moral disaster. We must allow God to develop our consciences and then our consciences are able to develop us.

Investigators studying the accident made an eerie discovery. The \"black box\" cockpit recorders revealed that several minutes before impact a shrill, computer-synthesized voice from the plane's automatic warning system told the crew repeatedly in English, \"Pull up! Pull up!\"\n\nThe pilot, evidently thinking the system was malfunctioning, snapped, \"Shut up, Gringo!\" and switched the system off. Minutes later the plane plowed into the side of a mountain. Everyone on board died.\n\nWhen I saw that tragic story on the news shortly after it happened, it struck me as a perfect parable of the way modern people treat guilt--the warning messages of their consciences.\n\nThe wisdom of our age says guilt feelings are nearly always erroneous or hurtful; therefore we should switch them off. But is that good advice? What, after all, is the conscience--this sense of guilt we all seem to feel?\n\nThe conscience is generally seen by the modern world as a defect that robs people of their self-esteem. Far from being a defect or a disorder, however, your ability to sense your own guilt is a tremendous gift from God. He designed the conscience into the very framework of the human soul. It is the automatic warning system that cries, \"Pull up! Pull up!\" before you crash and burn.\n\nThe conscience, Puritan Richard Sibbes wrote in the seventeenth century, is the soul reflecting upon itself. Conscience is at the heart of what distinguishes the human creature. People, unlike animals, can contemplate their own actions and make moral self-evaluations. That is the very function of conscience.\n\nThe conscience is an innate ability to sense right and wrong. Everyone, even the most unspiritual heathen, has a conscience: “When Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness, and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them” (Rom. 2:14–15, emphasis added).\n\nThe conscience entreats us to do what we believe is right and restrains us from doing what we believe is wrong. The conscience is not to be equated with the voice of God or the law of God. It is a human faculty that judges our actions and thoughts by the light of the highest standard we perceive. When we violate our conscience, it condemns us, triggering feelings of shame, anguish, regret, consternation, anxiety, disgrace, and even fear. When we follow our conscience, it commends us, bringing joy, serenity, self-respect, well-being, and gladness.\n\nThe word conscience is a combination of the Latin words scire (“to know”) and con (“together”). The Greek word for “conscience” is found more than thirty times in the New Testament—suneidēsis, which also literally means “co-knowledge.” Conscience is knowledge together with oneself; that is, conscience knows our inner motives and true thoughts. Conscience is above reason and beyond intellect. We may rationalize, trying to justify ourselves in our own minds, but a violated conscience will not be easily convinced.\n\nMultitudes today respond to their conscience by attempting to suppress it, overrule it, or silence it.\n\nThe Hebrew word for conscience is leb, (see also lebab) usually translated “heart” in the Old Testament. The conscience is so much at the core of the human soul that the Hebrew mind did not draw a distinction between conscience and the rest of the inner person. Thus when Moses recorded that Pharaoh “hardened his heart” (Exod. 8:15), he was saying that Pharaoh had steeled his conscience against God’s will. When Scripture speaks of a tender heart (cf. 2 Chr. 34:27), it refers to a sensitive conscience. The “upright in heart” (Ps. 7:10) are those with pure consciences. And when David prayed, “Create in me a clean heart, O God” (Ps. 51:10), he was seeking to have his life and his conscience cleansed.....\n\nMultitudes today respond to their conscience by attempting to suppress it, overrule it, or silence it. They conclude that the real blame for their wrong behavior lies in some childhood trauma, the way their parents raised them, societal pressures, or other causes beyond their control. Or they convince themselves that their sin is a clinical problem, not a moral one—and therefore define their alcoholism, sexual perversion, immorality, or other vices as “diseases.” To respond to the conscience with such arguments is tantamount to telling the conscience, “Shut up, Gringo!”\n\nIt is possible virtually to nullify the conscience through repeated abuse. Paul spoke of people whose consciences were so convoluted that their “glory is in their shame” (Phil. 3:19; cf. Rom. 1:32). Both the mind and the conscience can become so defiled that they cease making distinctions between what is pure and what is impure (cf. Tit. 1:15). After so much violation, the conscience finally falls silent. Morally, those with defiled consciences are left flying blind. The annoying warning signals may be gone, but the danger certainly is not; in fact, the danger is greater than ever.\n\nFurthermore, even the most defiled conscience will not remain silent forever. When we stand in judgment, every person’s conscience will side with God, the righteous judge. The worst sin-hardened evildoer will discover before the throne of God that he has a conscience which testifies against him.\n\nThe conscience, however, is not infallible. Nor is it a source of revelation about right and wrong. Its role is not to teach us moral and ethical ideals, but to hold us accountable to the highest standards of right and wrong we know. The conscience is informed by tradition as well as by truth, so the standards it holds us to are not necessarily biblical ones (1 Cor. 8:6–9). The conscience can be needlessly condemning in areas where there is no biblical issue. In fact, it can try to hold us to the very thing the Lord is trying to release us from (Rom. 14:14, 20–23). The conscience, to operate fully and in accord with true holiness, must be informed by the Word of God. So even when guilt feelings don’t have a biblical basis, they are an important spiritual distress sign. If they’re only signaling a weak conscience, that should spur us to seek the spiritual growth that would bring our conscience more in harmony with God’s Word.\n\nThe conscience reacts to the convictions of the mind and therefore can be encouraged and sharpened in accordance with God’s Word. The wise Christian wants to master biblical truth so that the conscience is completely informed and judges right because it is responding to God’s Word. A regular diet of Scripture will strengthen a weak conscience or restrain an overactive one. Conversely, error, human wisdom, and wrong moral influences filling the mind will corrupt or cripple the conscience.\n\nIn other words, the conscience functions like a skylight, not a light bulb. It lets light into the soul; it does not produce its own. Its effectiveness is determined by the amount of pure light we expose it to, and by how clean we keep it. Cover it or put it in total darkness and it ceases to function. That’s why the apostle Paul spoke of the importance of a clear conscience (1 Tim. 3:9) and warned against anything that would defile or muddy the conscience (1 Cor. 8:7; Tit. 1:15).\n\nOr, to switch metaphors, our conscience is like the nerve endings in our fingertips. Its sensitivity to external stimuli can be damaged by the buildup of callouses or even wounded so badly as to be virtually impervious to any feeling. Paul also wrote of the dangers of a calloused conscience (1 Cor. 8:10), a wounded conscience (v. 12), and a seared conscience (1 Tim. 4:2). (from his book which is recommended - The Vanishing Conscience - 2005 - one wonders what he would title it in 2016 - perhaps \"Gone Conscience!\")(See John MacArthur's full article \"The Conscience Revisited\")\n\nConscience is a dainty, delicate creature, a rare piece of workmanship of the Maker. Keep it whole without a crack, for if there be but one hole so that it break, it will with difficulty mend again. (S. Rutherford)\n\nThe Christian can never find a “more faithful adviser, a more active accuser, a severer witness, a more impartial judge, a sweeter comforter, or a more inexorable enemy.” (Bp. Sanderson.)\n\nA gnawing conscience keeps the memory terribly alert. (W. E. Sangster)\n\nConscience in everything: — Trust that man in nothing who has not a conscience in everything. (Sterne)\n\nConscience is the still small voice that makes you feel still smaller. (James A. Sanaker)\n\nConscience makes cowards of us; but conscience makes saints and heroes too. (J. Lightfoot)\n\nConscience is a marvelous gift from God, the window that lets in the light of His truth. If we sin against Him deliberately, that window becomes dirty, and not as much truth can filter through. Eventually, the window becomes so dirty that it no longer lets in the light. The Bible calls this a defiled, seared conscience… Do you keep a clean conscience? It is a part of your inner being that responds to God's truth. When you sin, the window of your conscience becomes dirty and filters out truth. Avoid sin in your life and live with a clean conscience. Every day feed yourself truth from the Word of God. (Wiersbe, W: Prayer, Praise and Promises: Ps 51:3-6)\n\nHurt not your conscience with any known sin. - S. Rutherford\n\nConscience is that faculty in me which attaches itself to the highest that I know, and tells me what the highest I know demands that I do.\n\nWhen there is any debate, quit. There is no debate possible when conscience speaks.\n\nOnce we assuage our conscience by calling something a “necessary evil,” it begins to look more and more necessary and less and less evil. - Sidney J. Harris\n\nConscience is God’s spy and man’s overseer. -John Trapp\n\nA good conscience and a good confidence go together. -- Thomas Brooks\n\nConscience is a small, still voice that makes minority reports. -- Franklin P. Jones\n\nConscience is also what makes a boy tell his mother before his sister does.\n\nPop used to say about the Presbyterians, 'It don't prevent them committing all the sins there are, but it keeps them from getting any fun but of it.' - Christopher Morley\n\nA good conscience is able to bear very much and is very cheerful in adversities. An evil conscience is always fearful and unquiet. Never rejoice except when you have done well. You shall rest sweetly if your heart does not accuse you.\n\nSinners never have true joy or feel inward peace, because ‘there is no peace for the wicked,’ says the Lord (Isaiah 57:21).\n\nThe glory of the good is in their consciences, and not in the tongues of others, The gladness of the just is of God, and in God; and their joy is of the truth.\n\nA person will easily be content and pacified whose conscience is pure. If you consider what you are within, you will not care what others say concerning you. People consider the deeds, but God weighs the intentions.\n\n“Conscience is that faculty in me which attaches itself to the highest that I know, and tells me what the highest I know demands that I do.\n\n(Conscience) is the eye of the soul which looks out either toward God or toward what it regards as the highest authority.\n\nIf I am in the habit of steadily facing toward God, my conscience will always introduce God’s perfect law and indicate what I should do.\n\n“The point is, will I obey?

She doesn’t want to take advice from a total stranger.” Bob Goddard,\n\nThe antagonism between life and conscience may be removed in two ways: by a change of life or by a change of conscience. Leo Tolstoy\n\nConscience tells us that we ought to do right, but it does not tell us what right is—that we are taught by God’s word. H.C. Trumbull\n\nWhat is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel bad after. - Ernest Hemingway (WRONG!!!)\n\nThe late General Omar Bradley was more serious in commenting on conscience \"The world has achieved brilliance without conscience,\" he conceded. \"Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants.\"\n\nILLUSTRATION - In 1984 an Avianca Airlines jet crashed in Spain. Investigators studying the accident made an eerie discovery. The \"black box\" cockpit recorders revealed that several minutes before impact, a shrill, computer-synthesized voice from the plane's automatic warning system told the crew repeatedly in English, \"Pull up! Pull up!\" The pilot, evidently thinking the system was malfunctioning, snapped, \"Shut up, Gringo!\" and switched the system off. Minutes later the plane plowed into the side of a mountain. Everyone on board died. When I saw that tragic story on the news shortly after it happened, it struck me as a perfect parable of the way modern people treat guilt — the warning messages of their consciences. (John MacArthur)\n\nTroubled Conscience - A man consulted a doctor, “I’ve been misbehaving, Doc, and my conscience is troubling me,” he complained. “And you want something that will strengthen your willpower?” asked the doctor. “Well, no,” said the fellow. “I was thinking of something that would weaken my conscience.” Bits & Pieces, May 27, 1993, Page 21\n\nThe Highest - Conscience is that faculty in me which attaches itself to the highest that I know, and tells me what the highest I know demands that I do. It is the eye of the soul which looks out either toward God or toward what it regards as the highest authority. If I am in the habit of steadily facing toward God, my conscience will always introduce God’s perfect law and indicate what I should do. The point is, will I obey? I have to make an effort to keep my conscience so sensitive that I walk without offense. I should be living in such perfect sympathy with God’s Son that in every circumstance the spirit of my mind is renewed. The one thing that keeps the conscience sensitive to Him is the habit of being open to God on the inside. When there is any debate, quit. There is no debate possible when conscience speaks. - Oswald Chambers - Source unknown\n\nBruce Weinstein is known as “The Ethics Guy.” His books and seminars challenge people to make choices based on principle rather than convenience or self-interest. In his business workshops, he often asks the participants, “Why should we be ethical?” He says that most responses center on the benefits of honesty and morality—avoiding punishment and having a clear conscience. While acknowledging that there are long-term benefits, Weinstein emphasizes doing the right thing because it’s the right thing to do.\n\nYour heart and conscience cannot safely guide,\n\nFor they are darkened by the sin inside;\n\nBut if you want to have a picture true,\n\nThe Word of God will mirror what is you.\n\n—Hess\n\nThe Bible will tell you what is wrong before you have done it!\n\n—D.L. Moody\n\nMorally Handicapped - The haunting story of fourteen-year-old Rod Matthews serves as a warning to a culture gone adrift. Rod was not interested in the things that normally interest teenagers. Neither sports nor books were enough to quench his insatiable boredom. Only one thing excited him: death. He spent hours watching the video Faces of Death, a collection of film clips of people dying violently. Rod’s curiosity about death led him to want to see death personally, not just on the television or movie screen. Eventually, he found a way to satisfy his curiosity. One winter afternoon he lured a friend out into the woods and proceeded to beat him to death with a baseball bat. During his trial for murder, the most telling remark was made by a child psychiatrist who was asked to give a clinical evaluation of Rod’s condition. The doctor’s assessment was that Rod was not insane in the conventional sense but that he simply didn’t “know right from wrong. … He [was] morally handicapped” (emphasis mine)” - Mark DeVries, Borrow Family-based youth ministry : reaching the been-there, done-that generation, (Downers Grove, IL, InterVarsity Press, 1994, p. 53\n\nOnly God has the right to define what’s wrong.\n\nRecently I read about a private investigator in the US who would knock on a door, show his badge to whoever answered, and say, “I guess we don’t have to tell you why we’re here.” Many times, the person would look stunned and say, “How did you find out?” then go on to describe an undiscovered criminal act committed long ago. Writing in Smithsonian magazine, Ron Rosenbaum described the reaction as “an opening for the primal force of conscience, the telltale heart’s internal monologue.” - David C.

The story is told about an old Indian chief who was converted. Later a missionary asked him:\n\n\"Chief, how are you doing spiritually? Are you experiencing victory over the devil?\"\n\n\"It's like this,\" the chief replied. \"I have two dogs inside me: a good dog and a bad dog. They are constantly fighting with each other.\"\n\n\"Which dog wins?\" asked the puzzled missionary.\n\n\"Whichever one I feed the most,\" retorted the wise old man. His conscience was being shaped by the Scriptures.\n\nBilly Graham set out the importance of a clear conscience - \"To have a guilty conscience is a feeling. Psychologists may define it as a guilt complex, and may seek to rationalize away the sense of guilt, but once it has been awakened through the application of the law of God, no explanation will quiet the insistent voice of conscience.\"\n\nThe Friend Inside - Throughout his administration, Abraham Lincoln was a president under fire, especially during the scarring years of the Civil War. And though he knew he would make errors of office, he resolved never to compromise his integrity. So strong was this resolve that he once said, “I desire so to conduct the affairs of this administration that if at the end, when I come to lay down the reins of power, I have lost every other friend on earth, I shall at least have one friend left, and that friend shall be down inside of me.” - Today In The Word, August, 1989, p. 21\n\nA Necessary Evil - Once we assuage our conscience by calling something a “necessary evil,” it begins to look more and more necessary and less and less evil. - Sidney J.

God has given us a faithful witness inside of our own being...It is able to single a man out and reveal his loneliness, the loneliness of a single soul in the universe going on to meet an angry God. That’s the terror of the conscience. Conscience never deals with theories. Conscience always deals with right and wrong and the relation of the individual to that which is right or wrong. Remember the conscience is always on God’s side! It judges conduct in the light of the moral law, and as the Scripture says, excuses or accuses.\"\n\nC H Spurgeon spoke frequently about conscience as seen in the following quite pithy quotations… beloved if you are contemplating sinning as you read this or are caught in the web of some sin, may the Holy Spirit of the Living God convict you of sin, righteousness and the judgment to come, not only for your sake of your Christian life but even more so for the sake of His name…\n\nConscience may tell me that something is wrong, but how wrong it is conscience itself does not know. Did any man's conscience, unenlightened by the Spirit, ever tell him that his sins deserved damnation? Did it ever lead any man to feel an abhorrence of sin as sin? Did conscience ever bring a man to such self-renunciation that he totally abhorred himself and all his works and came to Christ?\n\nA man sees his enemy before him. By the light of his candle, he marks the insidious approach. His enemy is seeking his life. The man puts out the candle and then exclaims, \"I am now quite at peace.\" That is what you do. Conscience is the candle of the Lord. It shows you your enemy. You try to put it out by saying, \"Peace, peace! Put the enemy out!\" God give you grace to thrust sin out!\n\nConscience is like a magnetic needle, which, if once turned aside from its pole, will never cease trembling. You can never make it still until it is permitted to return to its proper place.\n\nI recollect the time when I thought that if I had to live on bread and water all my life and be chained in a dungeon, I would cheerfully submit to that if I might but get rid of my sins. When sin haunted and burdened my spirit, I am sure I would have counted the martyr's death preferable to a life under the lash of a guilty conscience\n\nO believe me, guilt upon the conscience is worse than the body on the rack. Even the flames of the stake may be cheerfully endured, but the burnings of a conscience tormented by God are beyond all measure unendurable.\n\nThis side of hell, what can be worse than the tortures of an awakened conscience?\n\nHe was a fool who killed the watchdog because it alarmed him when thieves were breaking into his house. If conscience upbraids you, feel its upbraiding and heed its rebuke. It is your best friend.\n\nGive me into the power of a roaring lion, but never let me come under the power of an awakened, guilty conscience. Shut me up in a dark dungeon, among all manner of loathsome creatures—snakes and reptiles of all kinds—but, oh, give me not over to my own thoughts when I am consciously guilty before God!\n\nFire such as martyrs felt at the stake were but a plaything compared with the flames of a burning conscience. Thunderbolts and tornadoes are nothing in force compared with the charges of a guilty conscience.\n\nWhen a swarm of bees gets about a man, they are above, beneath, around, everywhere stinging, every one stinging, until he seems to be stung in every part of his body. So, when conscience wakes up the whole hive of our sins, we find ourselves compassed about with innumerable evils: sins at the board and sins on the bed, sins at the task and sins in the pew, sins in the street and sins in the shop, sins on the land and sins at sea, sins of body, soul, and spirit, sins of eye, of lip, of hand, of foot, sins everywhere. It is a horrible discovery when it seems to a man as if sin had become as omnipresent with him as God is.\n\nThe conscience of man, when he is really quickened and awakened by the Holy Spirit, speaks the truth. It rings the great alarm bell. And if he turns over in his bed, that great alarm bell rings out again and again, \"The wrath to come! The wrath to come! The wrath to come! \"\n\nNothing can be more horrible, out of hell, than to have an awakened conscience but not a reconciled God—to see sin, yet not see the Savior—to behold the deadly disease in all its loathsomeness, but not trust the good Physician, and so to have no hope of ever being healed of our malady.\n\nI would bear any affliction rather than be burdened with a guilty conscience.\n\nIt is a blessed thing to have a conscience that will shiver when the very ghost of a sin goes by—a conscience that is not like our great steamships at sea that do not yield to every wave, but, like a cork on the water, goes up and down with every ripple, sensitive in a moment to the very approach of sin. May God the Holy Spirit make us so! This sensitiveness the Christian endeavors to have, for he knows that if he has it not, he will never be purified from his sin.\n\nThere are thousands of people in this country who would be greatly troubled in their minds if they did not go to church twice on Sundays. And they get comfort in this because their conscience is dead. If their conscience were really awakened, they would understand that there is no connection between conscience and outward forms.\n\nI sometimes get this question put to me, concerning certain worldly amusements, “May I do so-and-so?” I am very sorry whenever anyone asks me that question, because it shows that there is something wrong, or it would not be raised at all. If a person’s conscience lets him say, “Well, I can go to A,” he will very soon go on to B, C, D, E, and through all the letters of the alphabet… When Satan cannot catch us with a big sin, he will try a little one. It does not matter to him as long as he catches his fish, what bait he uses. Beware of the beginning of evil, for many, who bade fair to go right, have turned aside and perished amongst the dark mountains in the wide field of sin.\n\nRay Stedman has some interesting thoughts on conscience writing that...\n\nWe each have a conscience. We may not be able to analyze it, and we certainly cannot control it, but we know we all possess one. Conscience has been defined as \"that still, small voice that makes you feel smaller still,\" or, as one little boy put it, \"It is that which feels bad when everything else feels good.\" Conscience is that internal voice that sits in judgment over our will. There is a very common myth abroad that says that conscience is the means by which we tell what is right and what is wrong. But conscience is never that. It is training that tells us what is right or wrong. But when we know what is right or wrong, it is our conscience that insists that we do what we think is right and avoid what we think is wrong. That distinction is very important and needs to be made clear. Conscience can be very mistaken; it is not a safe guide by itself. It accuses us when we violate whatever moral standard we may have, but that moral standard may be quite wrong when viewed in the light of God's revelation. But conscience also gives approval whenever we fulfill whatever standard we have, though that standard is right or wrong. And conscience, we have all discovered, acts both before and after the fact -- it can either prod or punish. (A Clear Conscience)\n\nBarclay gives an interesting historical perspective on \"conscience\" referring to it as...\n\nthe instinctive knowledge of right and wrong. The Stoics said that in the universe there were certain laws operative which a man broke at his peril—the laws of health, the moral laws which govern life and living. The Stoics called these laws phusis, which means nature, and urged men to live kata phusin, \"according to nature\". It is Paul’s argument that in the very nature of man there is an instinctive knowledge of what he ought to do. The Greeks would have agreed with that. Aristotle said: “The cultivated and free-minded man will so behave as being a law to himself.” Plutarch asks: “Who shall govern the governor?” And he answers: “Law, the king of all mortals and immortals...which is not written on papyrus rolls or wooden tablets, but is his own reason within the soul, which perpetually dwells with him and guards him and never leaves his soul bereft of leadership.\" (The Daily Study Bible - Romans 2)\n\nUnless of course it becomes seared as did the \"inner moral compass\" of the Roman Emperor Nero, whose evil exploits are too despicable to even be reviewed in these notes.\n\nExpired License When Sgt. Ray Baarz of the Midvale, Utah, police department opened his wallet the other day, he noticed his driver’s license had expired. Embarrassed at having caught himself red-handed, he had no alternative. He calmly and deliberately pulled out his ticket book and wrote himself a citation. Then Baarz took the ticket to the city judge who fined him five dollars. “How could I give a ticket to anyone else for an expired license in the future if I didn’t cite myself?” Baarz asked.\n\nThe trouble with the advice, “Follow your conscience” is that most people follow it like someone following a wheelbarrow—they direct it wherever they want it to go, and then follow behind. - Source unknown\n\nThis was how Susannah Wesley defined “sin” to her young son, John Wesley: “If you would judge of the lawfulness or the unlawfulness of pleasure, then take this simple rule: Whatever weakens your reason, impairs the tenderness of your conscience, obscures your sense of God, and takes off the relish of spiritual things—that to you is sin.”\n\nBarclay quotes William Temple, the renowned archbishop of Canterbury, as defining worship as quickening the conscience by the holiness of God, feeding the mind with the truth of God, purging the imagination by the beauty of God, opening the heart to the love of God, and devoting the will to the purpose of God\n\nConscience Fund - Did you know that ever since 1811 (when someone who had defrauded the government anonymously sent $5 to Washington D.C.) the U.S. Treasury has operated a Conscience Fund? Since that time almost $3.5 million has been received from guilt-ridden citizens. Swindoll, The Quest For Character\n\nDon’t Cross that Line\n\nThere is a time, we know not when,\n\nA place, we know not where;\n\nWhich marks the destiny of men\n\nTo glory or despair.\n\nThere is a line, by us unseen,\n\nWhich crosses every path,\n\nWhich marks the boundary between\n\nGod’s mercy and his wrath.\n\nTo pass that limit is to die,\n\nTo die as if by stealth;\n\nIt does not dim the beaming eye,\n\nNor pale the glow of health.\n\nThe conscience may be still at ease,\n\nThe spirit light and gay;\n\nAnd that which pleases still may please,\n\nAnd care be thrust away.\n\nBut on that forehead God hath set\n\nIndelibly a mark;\n\nUnseen by man, for man as yet,\n\nIs blind and in the dark.\n\nHe feels perchance that all is well\n\nAnd every fear is calmed;\n\nHe lives, he dies, he walks in hell,\n\nNot only doomed, but damned!\n\nO, where is that mysterious line\n\nThat may by men be crossed,\n\nBeyond which God himself hath sworn,\n\nThat he who goes is lost?\n\nAn answer from the skies repeats,\n\n“Ye who from God depart,”\n\nToday, O hear His voice,\n\nToday repent and harden not your heart.\n\n- Joseph Addison Alexander\n\nHudson Taylor - Years ago the communist government in China commissioned an author to write a biography of Hudson Taylor with the purpose of distorting the facts and presenting him in a bad light. They wanted to discredit the name of this consecrated missionary of the gospel. As the author was doing his research, he was increasingly impressed by Taylor’s saintly character and godly life, and he found it extremely difficult to carry out his assigned task with a clear conscience. Eventually, at the risk of losing his life, he laid aside his pen, renounced his atheism, and received Jesus as his personal Savior. Whether we realize it or not, our example leaves an impression on others.\n\nOnce there was a man who was such a golf addict that he was neglecting his job. Frequently he would call in sick as an excuse to play.\n\nOne morning, after making his usual call to the office, an angel up above spotted him on the way to the golf course and decided to teach him a lesson. “If you play golf today, you will be punished,” the angel whispered in his ear.\n\nThinking it was only his conscience, which he had successfully whipped in the past, the fellow just smiled. “No,” he said, “I’ve been doing this for years. No one will ever know. I won’t be punished.”\n\nThe angel said no more and the fellow stepped up to the first tee where he promptly whacked the ball 300 yards straight down the middle of the fairway. Since he had never driven the ball more than 200 yards, he couldn’t believe it. Yet, there it was. And his luck continued. Long drives on every hole, perfect putting. By the ninth hole he was six under par and was playing near-perfect golf. The fellow was walking on air.\n\nHe wound up with an amazing 61, about 30 strokes under his usual game. Wait until he got back to the office and told them about this! But, suddenly, his face fell. He couldn’t tell them. He could never tell anyone.\n\nThe angel smiled.\n\nUpright Character\n\nIn China’s later Han era, there lived a politician called Yang Zhen, a man known for his upright character. After Yang Zhen was made a provincial governor, one of his earlier patrons, Wang Mi, paid him an unexpected visit. As they talked over old times, Wang Mi brought out a large gold cup and presented it to Yang Zhen. Yang Zhen refused to accept it, but Wang Mi persisted, saying, “There’s no one here tonight but you and me, so no one will know.”\n\n“You say that no one will know,” Yang Zhen replied, “but that is not true. Heaven will know, and you and I will know too.”\n\nWang Mi was ashamed, and backed down. Subsequently Yang Zhen’s integrity won increasing recognition, and he rose to a high post in the central government.\n\nHuman nature is weak, and we tend to yield to temptation when we think nobody can see us. In fact, if there was no police force, many people would not hesitate to steal. This is not to say that when we do something bad, we feel no compunction at all, just that man is weak and prone to yield to temptation.\n\nBut even if nobody witnesses our sins, and not a soul knows of them, we cannot hide the truth from the eyes of our conscience. In the end, what is important is not that other people know, but that we ourselves know. When Yang Zhen told Wang Mi that “Heaven will know,” he meant that the gods would know what he had done: in other words, his own conscience.\n\nA person who sins neither in thought nor deed, and is fair and just, gains enormous courage and strength. As a leader, you need courage born of integrity in order to be capable of powerful leadership. To achieve this courage, you must search your heart, and make sure that your conscience is clear and your behavior is beyond reproach. Konosuke Matsushita,\n\nThings that will destroy us\n\nPolitics without principle,\n\npleasure without conscience,\n\nwealth without work,\n\nknowledge without character,\n\nbusiness without morality,\n\nscience without humanity,\n\nworship without sacrifice.\n\nMohandas K. Gandhi,\n\nStirring the Conscience\n\nThe great 19th century British statesman and prime minister, William Gladstone, once said, “One thing I have against the clergy both of the country and in the towns. I think they are not severe enough on congregations. They do not sufficiently lay upon the souls and consciences of their hearers their moral obligations, and probe their hearts and bring up their whole lives and actions to the bar of conscience.\n\n“The class of sermons which I think are most needed, are of the class which once offended Lord Melbourne. He was seen coming from church in the country in a great fume. Finding a friend, he exclaimed, ‘It is too bad I have always been a supporter of the church, and I have always upheld the clergy, but it is really too bad to have to listen to a sermon like that we have heard this morning. Why, the preacher actually insisted upon applying religion to a man’s personal life!”\n\nGladstone concluded,\n\n“That is the kind of preaching I like best, the kind of preaching which men need most, but it is, also, the kind of which they get the least.” Morning Glory\n\nPs. 51:3 Dirty Windows\n\nRead Psalm 51:3-6\n\nSin is much more than a word in the dictionary. It is a powerful evil that damages our lives and our world. David describes a guilty conscience: \"For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me\" (Psalm 51:3). Conscience is a marvelous gift from God, the window that lets in the light of His truth. If we sin against Him deliberately, that window becomes dirty, and not as much truth can filter through. Eventually, the window becomes so dirty that it no longer lets in the light. The Bible calls this a defiled, seared conscience.\n\nDavid covered his sin for about a year. He refused to be broken. He refused to humble himself before God. And what was his life like? \"He who covers his sins will not prosper\" (Prov. 28:13). Did David prosper? No. Wherever he looked he saw his sin.\n\nBefore he sinned, David saw God wherever he looked. His heart was pure. \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God\" (Matt. 5:8). Your heart affects your eyes; what you love in your heart, your eyes will seek.\n\nGod wants truth in our inner being. \"Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom\" (Psalm 51:6). David confessed because he wanted to see God again--in nature, in His Word and in the temple.\n\nDo you keep a clean conscience? It is a part of your inner being that responds to God's truth. When you sin, the window of your conscience becomes dirty and filters out truth. Avoid sin in your life and live with a clean conscience. Every day feed yourself truth from the Word of God. - Warren Wiersbe - Prayer, Praises, and Promises\n\nRestitution\n\nI once heard the late Dr. F.E. Marsh tell that on one occasion he was preaching on this question and urging upon his hearers the importance of confession of sin and wherever possible of restitution for wrong done to others.\n\nAt the close a young man, a member of the church, came up to him with a troubled countenance. “Pastor,” he explained, “you have put me in a sad fix. I have wronged another and I am ashamed to confess it or to try to put it right. You see, I am a boat builder and the man I work for is an infidel. I have talked to him often about his need of Christ and urged him to come and hear you preach, but he scoffs and ridicules it all. Now, I have been guilty of something that, if I should acknowledge it to him, will ruin my testimony forever.”\n\nHe then went on to say that sometime ago he started to build a boat for himself in his own yard. In this work copper nails are used because they do not rust in the water. These nails are quite expensive and the young man had been carrying home quantities of them to use on the job. He knew it was stealing, but he tried to salve his conscience be telling himself that the master had so many he would never miss them and besides he was not being paid all that he thought he deserved. But this sermon had brought him to face the fact that he was just a common thief, for whose dishonest actions there was no excuse.\n\n“But,” said he, “I cannot go to my boss and tell him what I have done or offer to pay for those I have used and return the rest. If I do he will think I am just a hypocrite. And yet those copper mails are digging into my conscience and I know I shall never have peace until I put this matter right.”\n\nFor weeks the struggle went on. Then one night he came to Dr. Marsh and exclaimed, “Pastor, I’ve settled for the copper nails and my conscience is relieved at last.”\n\n“What happened when you confessed to your employer what you had done?” asked the pastor.\n\n“Oh,” he answered, “he looked queerly at me, then exclaimed, ‘George, I always did think you were just a hypocrite, but now I begin to feel there’s something in this Christianity after all. Any religion that would make a dishonest workman come back and confess that he had been stealing copper nails and offer to settle for them, must be worth having.’”\n\nDr. Marsh asked if he might use the story, and was granted permission.\n\nSometime afterwards, he told it in another city. The next day a lady came up and said, “Doctor, I have had ‘copper nails’ on my conscience too.” “Why, surely, you are not a boat builder!” “No, but I am a book-lover and I have stolen a number of books from a friend of mine who gets far more that I could ever afford. I decided last night I must get rid of the ‘copper nails,’ so I took them all back to her today and confessed my sin. I can’t tell you how relieved I am. She forgave me, and God has forgiven me. I am so thankful the ‘copper mails’ are not digging into my conscience any more.”\n\nI have told this story many times and almost invariably people have come to me afterwards telling of “copper nails” in one form or another that they had to get rid of. On one occasion, I told it at a High School chapel service. The next day the principal saw me and said, “As a result of that ‘copper nails’ story, ever so many stolen fountain pens and other things have been returned to their rightful owners.”\n\nReformation and restitution do not save. But where one is truly repentant and has come to God in sincere confession, he will want to the best of his ability to put things right with others. Illustrations of Bible Truth by H.A. Ironside\n\nFalse Testimony - The great attorney, orator, and statesman Daniel Webster was such an imposing figure in court that he once stared a witness out of the courtroom. Apparently Webster knew the man was there to deliver false testimony, so he fixed his “dark, beetle-browed” eyes on the man and searched him. According to the story, later in the trial “Webster looked around again to see if [the witness] was ready for the inquisition. The witness felt for his hat and edged toward the door. A third time Webster looked on him, and the witness could sit no longer. He seized his chance and fled from the court and was nowhere to be found.” - Today in the Word,\n\nIn a number of languages it would be entirely misleading to speak of `a guilty conscience,' for this would seem to imply that there is something sinful about the conscience itself. In reality, it is the conscience that says that a person is guilty, and therefore it may be necessary to translate Heb10:22 as `with hearts that have been purified from a condition in which their conscience has said that they are guilty.\n\nThere is a treasure you can own\n\nThat's greater than a crown or throne;\n\nThis treasure is a conscience clear\n\nThat brings the sweetest peace and cheer. --Isenhour\n\nSee 1Pe 3:19 where Peter is encouraging the believers who are suffering (or will soon go thru a fiery trial) with the doctrinal truth that \"baptism now saves you\" and he equates this \"baptism\" not with water baptism of Christianity or ritual Jewish baptismal washing for \"purification\" but with the obtaining of a \"good conscience\". And in these verses in Hebrews we see the only way one can obtain a clean conscience is by having one's heart sprinkled (with the blood of Jesus) (1Pe1:2) representing the blood of the New Covenant in which the unregenerate person is born from above and receives a new heart (with a new conscience).\n\nThe 50-Year Desire -- Years ago I was standing by the deathbed of an old minister down in Alabama. The old man had been a preacher for fifty years. I saw his son, who also was a minister, kneel by his father’s bed. “Father, you have preached for fifty years, and have done more good than any man I know.” The old man, with feeble but distinct voice, said: “Don’t tell me about that, son. Tell me about the blood of Jesus. Nothing but the blood of Jesus will do for a dying man.” If a man who had preached for fifty years and who had lived a pure, straight life, in his dying hour had to rely upon the blood of Jesus Christ, don’t you ever think there is any hope for you aside from this atoning blood?\n\nBoard Room Policy - Few executives can afford the luxury of a conscience. A business that defined right and wrong in terms that would satisfy a well-developed contemporary conscience could not survive. When the directors and managers enter the board room to debate policy, they park their private consciences outside. If they didn’t they would fail in their responsibility to the company that pays them. The crucial question in board rooms today is not, “Are we morally obligated to do it?” but rather “What will happen if we don’t do it?” or “How will this affect the rate of return on our investment?” No company employs a vice president in charge of ethical standards, and sooner or later the conscientious executive is likely to come up against a stone wall of corporate indifference to private moral values. In the real world of today’s business, he is almost surely a troubled man. - Dan Miller, Chicago\n\nI recently saw the story of a high school values clarification class conducted by a teacher in Teneck, New Jersey. A girl in the class had found a purse containing $1,000 and returned it to its owner. The teacher asked for the class’s reaction. Every single one of her fellow students concluded the girl had been “foolish.” Most of the students contended that if someone is careless, they should be punished. When the teacher was asked what he said to the students, he responded, “Well, of course, I didn’t say anything. If I come from the position of what is right and what is wrong, then I’m not their counselor. I can’t impose my views.” It’s no wonder that J. Allen Smith, considered a father of many modern education reforms, concluded in the end, “The trouble with us reformers is that we’ve made reform a crusade against all standards. Well, we’ve smashed them all, and now neither we nor anybody else have anything left.” Senator Dan Coats\n\nConscience Free - \"I desire so to conduct the affairs of this administration that if at the end, when I come to lay down the reins of power, I have lost every other friend on earth, I shall at least have one friend left, and that friend shall be down inside of me.\" —Abraham Lincoln\n\nYour Conscience - Oh child of many prayers; Oh child of baptism and covenants; Oh child of the Sabbath-school and the early Church—if you are going from glory to glory, how joyful is your lot! But if you are going on from insensibility to insensibility, if you sin more and feel less, if you are becoming harder and harder, if moral waste is more and more manifest in you, if death already begins to show itself in the supernal and superior part of your nature, if conscience ceases any more to speak and hope is gone, and faith is lost, and wreck and ruin have come upon the crystalline sphere of your being—then woe is you! —Henry Ward Beecher\n\nNever Go Against Conscience - In the primitive days of our American history a wealthy man came to a poor sadler on Saturday night, leaving a bridle with orders that it should be finished Monday. \"That is not possible,\" said the proprietor of the shop. \"What nonsense! There is all day tomorrow.\" \"We do not work on Sunday, sir.\" \"Then I shall go to those who do.\" \"We can get it done by Tuesday.\" \"That will not do, put it in the carriage.\" Not a moment did the sadler linger. Quietly he did as he was told. Hours afterward a neighbor came and said, banteringly, \"I thought the least I could do was to come and thank you, and tell you I should be glad of as many more customers as you like to send.\" \"I shall not send you those I can keep, but God helping me, I will never go against my conscience, not for any man, nor for any money.\" Weeks went by, weeks of trouble to this faithful sadler, and a military man came into his shop. \"So you are the impudent fellow who will not work on Sunday.\" \"I do not work on Sunday, but I hope I am not wanting in respect to my employers.\" \"My friend said you refused to do his work, do you not call that impertinence?\" \"I had no choice, sir.\" \"Yes you had, you were free to choose between serving God and pleasing man, and you made your choice, and because of that I am here today. I am General Downing. I have been looking for a man on whom I could rely, to execute a large government order. The moment I heard of you, I made up my mind you should have it, for I felt sure the man who would serve God fearlessly would serve his neighbor faithfully.\" The general gave him the order, and it laid the foundation of the sadler's prosperity.—Selected\n\nGuilty Conscience - At a missionary conference in a southern church, Rev. Leon Cramer was leading the singing. Many of the poorer folk had no money to give to missions, but they laid aside a hen, pig, calf, or sheep and brought in the money when the animal was sold. One brother had promised a calf, but meat prices went a-soaring and said he to himself, I'll not give it. Even the rich won't give that much.\" Many came with their offerings but he still refused. One Sunday afternoon Mr. Cramer led in singing, \"The Half Has Never Yet Been Told.\" This brother was coming up over the hill. He heard the singing and came running in onto the platform shouting, \"Stop singing about it and I'll bring the money in for missions tomorrow.\" A guilty conscience needs no accuser. He thought they were singing, \"The Calf Has Never Yet Been Sold.\" Perhaps some of us have \"a calf\" on hand that should be given to God. —W.

Rogan was a US Representative from a district in California, he was faced with a crucial decision. He had been elected by the slimmest of margins in an area that usually voted for the other party. An extremely important public issue with immense moral implications was being considered. If he followed his conscience, it would cost him re-election. If he followed political expediency, he could be certain of another term. The congressman went with his convictions and voted for what he knew in his heart to be right. He was not re-elected. Afterward, he said, “It hurt to lose. But I’ll never regret my vote . . . . It is easy for elected officials to succumb to the illusion that the greater good is served by their self-perpetuation in office. But something larger gets lost. . . . the ability to lead.”\n\nOur conscience is like a moral monitor. An important way we discern whether a spiritual communication has God as its source is to ask: Does the message agree with the Bible, God's written Word? If it does not align with God’s previously revealed truth, then we cannot put our stamp of approval on it. - Amy Boucher Pye\n\nJesse Jacobs has created an apology hotline that makes it possible to apologize without actually talking to the person you’ve wronged. People who are unable or unwilling to unburden their conscience in person call the hotline and leave a message on an answering machine. Each week, 30 to 50 calls are logged, as people apologize for things from adultery to embezzlement. “The hotline offers participants a chance to alleviate their guilt and, to some degree, to own up to their misdeeds,” said Jacobs. Are any of your relationships broken or estranged because of something you said or did? Take the initiative. Go now and do all you can to be reconciled.\n\nA prisoner waiting on death row had a deep sense of guilt. He had killed a man in the presence of the victim’s two children during a robbery attempt. The convict was bothered so much that he refused to allow his lawyer to appeal for a stay of execution. For him, departing this life was an escape from his nagging conscience and the reproach of an angry society. He said, “It’s my way out of this living hell.” How mistaken he was!\n\nAfter bearing the burden of a guilty conscience for more than four decades, an elderly man decided he couldn’t go on any longer without confessing his crime. When he was brought to trial, he told the judge, “After living with this thing hanging over my head for 40 some years, it got heavier and heavier until I just couldn’t stand it any longer.” What a clear illustration that guilt is inescapable! And the power of conscience!\n\nIf you can't hear God speaking, check the volume control of your conscience.\n\nResearchers at the University of Toronto reported in 2006 that people who are suffering from a guilty conscience experience “a powerful urge to wash themselves.” To study this effect, the researchers asked volunteers to recall past sins. They were then given an opportunity to wash their hands as a symbol of cleansing their conscience. Those who had recalled their sins washed their hands at “twice the rate of study subjects who had not imagined past transgressions.” The Bible proposes the only effective way of dealing with sin—confession\n\nA Clear Conscience\n\nRead: Hebrews 3:7-15\n\nWash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. —Psalm 51:2\n\nIn 1971 he killed a man. Even though he was the prime suspect in the murder, no one could prove it and the case was abandoned. So, he got away with it. Or did he? Nearly three decades later, in failing health and living in a nursing home, he confessed to the crime. A detective who headed the original investigation said, \"He was looking over his shoulder for the last 26 years, not only for the law, but for his Maker. I think he wants to clear his conscience before he meets his Maker--or try to at least.\"\n\nHow's your conscience today? Clear or clouded? What would it take to be ready to meet your Maker? How can you be made clean?\n\nIt may seem strange to speak of blood as a cleansing agent, but that's how the Bible connects the death of Jesus on the cross to our standing before God (Heb. 10:19). Christ shed His blood so that we might be forgiven and made clean inside. Because of what He has done, we can have a clear conscience and \"draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith\" (Heb 10:22).\n\nNo matter who you are or what you've done, Jesus Christ can give you a clear conscience. Why not confess your sin and make things right with your Maker today. -- David C.

Despite the adulation she received, something troubled her. Guilt overtook her and pushed her to the brink of a nervous breakdown.\n\nWhat was bothering her? “I shouldn’t be remembered as the first woman to walk around the world,” she finally admitted. “I cheated.” During her worldwide trek, she broke the guidelines of the Guinness Book of World Records by riding in a truck part of the way. To clear her conscience, she called her sponsor and confessed her deception.\n\nGod has given each of us a conscience that brings guilt when we do wrong. In Romans, Paul describes our conscience as “accusing or else excusing [us]” (Ro 2:15+). For the obedient follower of Christ, care of the conscience is an important way of maintaining a moral compass despite moral imperfection. Confessing sin, turning from it, and making restitution should be a way of life (1 John 1:9+; Lev. 6:2-5+).\n\nPaul modeled a well-maintained conscience, saying, “I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man” (Acts 24:16NIV+). Through confession and repentance, he kept short accounts with God. Is sin bothering you? Follow Paul’s example.

It didn’t hurt when they stepped in a fire or cut their finger with a knife, so they left their wounds untended. This led to infection and deformity.\n\nDr. Brand constructed a machine that would beep when it came in contact with fire or sharp objects. It signaled the warnings of injury in the absence of pain. Soon machines were attached to the patients’ fingers and feet. That worked well until they wanted to play basketball. They took the machines off, and often became injured again without knowing it.\n\nLike physical pain to our bodies, our conscience alerts us to spiritual harm. But habitual and unrepentant sin can numb the conscience (1 Tim. 4:1-3). To keep a clear conscience, we need to respond to the pain of appropriate guilt by confession (1 John 1:9), repentance (Acts 26:20), and restitution to others (Luke 19:8). Paul could say with confidence, “I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men” (Acts 24:16). Like him, we should not grow numb to God’s painful reminder of sin but allow it to produce in us godly character.\n\nMy conscience must be well-informed\n\nFrom God’s own sacred Word,\n\nFor conscience may be much deformed\n\nWhen standards pure are spurned.\n\n—Fraser\n\nA clear conscience is a soft pillow.\n\nBy Dennis Fisher - March 22, 2007 (For the full devotional including a beautiful related picture and a link at the bottom of the page to one of their excellent devotional booklets please click here to go to Our Daily Bread, Copyright RBC Ministries — Reprinted by permission.

A. Ironside tells about a man who was getting ready to attend a banquet. He wanted to put on a white shirt he had worn on a previous occasion, so he was inspecting it carefully to see if it was too dirty. His wife noticed what he was doing and called out, “Remember, dear, if it’s doubtful, don’t.” The issue was settled. The man threw the shirt into the laundry hamper.\n\nThat wife’s advice reminds me of the principle in today’s text. It’s a principle that can be applied to questionable matters of conscience. If doubtful, don’t.\n\nThe doubtful things the apostle Paul wrote about in Romans 14 had to do with meat and wine considered to be “unclean” by some but not by others (Ro 14:14,21). He indicated that if we have doubts about whether an action is right or wrong and we do it anyway, our action is not from faith and is therefore a sin (Ro 14:23). He also pointed out that it is wrong to do anything by which a brother in Christ “stumbles or is offended or is made weak” (Ro 14:21). We must never give another Christian a reason to violate his or her conscience.\n\nWhen faced with questionable practices and a troubled conscience, we would do well to make this our guideline: If it’s doubtful, don’t!\n\nThere is a treasure you can own\n\nThat's greater than a crown or throne;\n\nThis treasure is a conscience clear\n\nThat brings the sweetest peace and cheer.\n\n—Isenhour\n\nOne little word can spare us a lot of trouble.

When he arrived home, his wife would not let him in. Instead, she called their pastor, who found the man sleeping in his car.\n\nThe pastor took him to a motel to sleep off his drunkenness. He knew him well and was confident that a strong rebuke would not be needed. Instead, he asked God to convict the man and bring him to repentance. In this case the pastor chose the right course. The young man later said that he had learned a valuable lesson through this experience and that the Lord had “taken all the fun out of sin.”\n\nA “good conscience” will disturb us when we do something we know is wrong. We keep it “good” by heeding it and turning away from sin. Paul said the faith of Hymenaeus and Alexander “suffered shipwreck” because they rejected the voice of their good conscience (1 Timothy 1:19-20). By doing so, they had deadened their conscience and then apparently twisted the truth to justify their conduct.\n\nTrue faith and a sensitive conscience will take all the fun out of sinning and remove the desire to twist the truth to justify what is wrong. Faith and a good conscience are a winning combination. Let’s keep them strong.\n\nOur conscience is a gift from God,\n\nIt is a guiding light;\n\nAnd when aligned with faith and truth,\n\nIt tells us wrong from right.\n\n—Sper\n\nConscience is a safe guide when guided by God's Word.\n\nBy Herbert Vander Lugt 2004/05/08/ (For the full devotional including a beautiful related picture and a link at the bottom of the page to one of their excellent devotional booklets please click here to go to Our Daily Bread, Copyright RBC Ministries — Reprinted by permission.

Their home was equipped with a smoke detector that was in good working order, but it hadn’t gone off. Why? Fire inspectors concluded that the device had been deactivated for a party the night before. The unit had been disconnected to keep it from sounding off because of the smoke from cooking and candles.\n\nIn Acts 5 we have another example of two people who apparently deactivated an alarm system that could have saved their lives. Ananias and Sapphira must have quenched the Holy Spirit by turning a deaf ear to their consciences, believing they had plenty of good reasons for doing what they did. But their action cost them their lives.\n\nWe need to realize that the Holy Spirit was not given to annoy us like a sensitive smoke detector. He doesn’t sound false alarms. When He activates our conscience by bringing to mind a principle or warning from God’s Word, it is really His love and wisdom in action.\n\nBy weighing the warnings of His love against the cost of our foolishness, we’ll soon realize that it’s always better to be safe than sorry. —MRD II\n\nOur conscience is a gift from God,\n\nIt is a guiding light;\n\nAnd when aligned with God's true Word,\n\nIt shows us what is right.\n\n—Sper\n\nTo ignore your conscience is to invite trouble.\n\nBy Mart DeHaan 2002/07/22 (For the full devotional including a beautiful related picture and a link at the bottom of the page to one of their excellent devotional booklets please click here to go to Our Daily Bread, Copyright RBC Ministries — Reprinted by permission.

Well, if we could go through life without ever breaking any of God’s laws, we would have nothing to feel guilty about. But I don’t know anyone with that kind of record. Only Jesus Christ could confidently ask, “Which of you convicts Me of sin?” and have no fear of being accused (Jn. 8:46).\n\nYet the apostle Peter told his readers to commit their hearts to the Lord God, “having a good conscience” (1 Pet. 3:15-16). And Paul encouraged Timothy to wage a good warfare, “having faith and a good conscience” (1 Tim. 1:19). On one occasion, when brought before some religious leaders who didn’t like what he was saying, Paul even asserted, “I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day” (Acts 23:1).\n\nHow is it possible for you to have a good conscience? The New Testament book of Hebrews presents Jesus Christ and His sacrificial death as your only hope of achieving it. Through faith in Him your heart can be “sprinkled from an evil conscience” (Heb. 10:22). And His blood can “cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God” (Heb 9:14).\n\nDo you know the joy of a good conscience?\n\nThere is a treasure you can own\n\nThat's greater than a crown or throne;\n\nThis treasure is a conscience clear\n\nThat brings the sweetest peace and cheer.\n\n—Isenhour\n\nA good conscience is one of the best friends you'll ever have.\n\nBy Dennis J.

But this vital monitor of morality does not say the same thing to everyone. In some cultures vengeful killing is seen as honorable. In others, a person is still considered good even when he betrays a friend.\n\nA story from The Philadelphia Inquirer illustrates this problem. A 12-year-old boy was caught stealing a watch. He told police that previously he had shoplifted a gift for his mother, and he felt he had to do the same for his dad. Although troubled about slighting his father, he had no qualms about stealing.\n\nBecause of sin, conscience is unreliable and needs a continual adjustment. This begins with a right relationship to God through faith in Jesus Christ. He paid sin’s penalty, and now our hearts are “sprinkled from an evil conscience” (Heb. 10:22). But this does not make conscience obsolete. As we study the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit puts our inner monitor on a frequency that brings us in tune with the words, deeds, and attitudes of the Lord Jesus.\n\n“Let your conscience be your guide” is valid only if God’s Word is guiding your conscience.\n\nThere is a treasure you can own\n\nThat's greater than a crown or throne:\n\nA conscience good with which to live,\n\nThat only God Himself can give.\n\n—Isenhour\n\nConscience is like a sundial: when the truth of God shines on it, it points in the right direction.\n\nBy Dennis J.

But a cleansed conscience brings freedom.\n\nSome people have no strong basis for making godly decisions. Their conscience is weak, and they can be easily swayed by the behavior of others. Then there are those whose conscience is defiled. The standard by which they measure good and evil is corrupted, polluted, and impure (Titus 1:15). But saddest of all are those who have a “seared” conscience (1 Timothy 4:2). They have resisted that inner voice for so long that they no longer hear what it has to say.\n\nBut you ask, “How can we have a cleansed conscience?” We must repent of our sin and return to our Creator. We must ask Him to conform our desires and behavior to His Word and then be careful to obey it.\n\nThere is a treasure you can own\n\nThat's greater than a crown or throne;\n\nThis treasure is a conscience clear\n\nThat brings the sweetest peace and cheer.\n\n—Isenhour\n\nConscience is a trustworthy compass when God's Word is your true north.\n\nBy David H.

Whenever Bullet heard a squirrel, a rabbit, or a person, he would take off like a shot in the direction of that sound. It didn’t matter that he was tied up. By the time he reached the end of his rope, he’d be traveling at maximum velocity, heading straight for his target. But in an instant, his strong rope would pull taut and jerk Bullet to a jarring, sprawling halt. That beagle never learned his limits.\n\nGod has built into us a moral tug on the soul whenever we go beyond what is good for us. It’s called conscience. Unlike Bullet’s rope, however, it doesn’t stop us from going too far. Furthermore, conscience can be deadened when we violate it repeatedly, and it can be programmed with wrong information so that we may feel guilty when no real guilt exists, or we may be guilty and not feel it.\n\nWe must learn the moral limits God places on us for our own good and then choose to live within them. By reading God’s Word and trusting His Spirit to teach us, our conscience becomes attuned to God’s standard of right and wrong. This helps us to know our limits and to experience the freedom and joy that living within them brings.\n\nMy conscience must be well-informed\n\nFrom God's own sacred Word;\n\nFor conscience may be much deformed\n\nWhen standards pure are spurned.\n\n—Fraser\n\nConscience can be our compass if the Word of God is our chart.\n\nBy Dennis J.

But if not, . . . we do not serve your gods. —Daniel 3:17-18\n\nNearly every day we face questions of conscience. We must choose between doing what pleases God and what appeals to our own selfish desires.\n\nGovernment officials may be tempted to accept bribes and to make unethical decisions. Employees are sometimes asked to rearrange numbers or file false reports. Students often face temptations such as cheating and plagiarism.\n\nAs Christians, we face situations in our daily lives that are conscience-testers. They help us to see whether we are serious about the integrity God expects of us. We know our choices will have good or bad consequences, but the real test comes when we must decide what to do.\n\nWhat is the greatest protection against making the wrong decision? It is trusting God to take care of us as we choose to do what’s right, regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn Daniel 3, Shadrach and his friends made a decision not to bow down to the gold image. They dared to disobey the king because they trusted God. They said that even if the Lord did not deliver them, they would still trust Him (vv.17-18).\n\nWhen we face matters of conscience, we too can do the right thing—and leave the consequences with God.\n\nLet the road be rough and dreary,\n\nAnd its end far out of sight;\n\nFoot it bravely, strong or weary—\n\nTrust in God and do the right.\n\n—Macleod\n\nIf God's Word guides your conscience, let your conscience be your guide.\n\nBy Dave Branon 2000/01/10 (For the full devotional including a beautiful picture and a link at the bottom of the page to one of their excellent devotional booklets please click here to go to Our Daily Bread, Copyright RBC Ministries — Reprinted by permission.

An interest in the workings of navigational compasses stayed with him during his work as a clergyman. His research led to the discovery that all newly built iron ships had their own magnetic influence on compasses. This influence would change at sea for various reasons—lead"
