As Nate explained by way of an example, “If you have a U.S. multinational company that licenses its IP to its operating headquarters in some other country, not Germany ... the idea is that to the extent that the royalties relate to German-registered rights, Germany would assert the ability to withhold even though they’re not on either side of the transaction.”\n\nNew Regulation: Statutes, Pillars and the Build Back Better Act\n\nIn the new episode of our tax podcast, “GILTI Conscience,” partners Nate Carden and David Farhat speak with Skadden of counsel Paul Oosterhuis and associate Huzefa Mun about tax legislation, including how the potential failure to pass the Build Back Better Act might impact the Treasury Department’s implementation of future guidance, including Pillar One and Pillar Two.\n\nThe Tax Legislation Process and What to Expect in 2022\n\nIn the new episode of Skadden's \"GILTI Conscience\" podcast, partners Nate Carden and David Farhat talk with about the \"art\" of drafting and passing tax legislation with Loren Ponds, a former tax counsel for the House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee. \"Taxpayer feedback is kind of essential to the process,\" Loren says. \"Thinking about policy and how we think the rules should or will operate is very different when faced with taxpayer-specific fact patterns.\"\n\nSpotlight Series: The Importance of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in Tax Law\n\nIn the latest episode of Skadden's tax podcast \"GILTI Conscience,\" hosts Nate Carden and David Farhat talk with associates Eman Cuyler and Stefane Victor about Black identity and lawyering, particularly among tax practitioners.

Implicit Support: What's the Way Forward?\n\nIn episode two of \"GILTI Conscience,\" tax partners Nate Carden and David Farhat talk with economist Bram Isgur of Keystone Strategy about the transfer pricing implications for intercompany loans and guarantees. \"The stakes are huge,\" David says. \"A lot of clients have to fund themselves.
