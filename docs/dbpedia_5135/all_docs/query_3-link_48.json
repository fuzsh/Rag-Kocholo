        "text": "Today on EerdWord, Matthew Levering shares why he wrote The Abuse of Conscience: A Century of Catholic Moral Theology. This book presents and deconstructs the work of twenty-six noteworthy theologians from the recent past in order to work through core matters of Catholic moral theology. The Abuse of Conscience is available for order at Eerdmans.com, Barnes & Noble, and Amazon.com.\n\nThe motivating factor was the discovery of how popular conscience-centered moral theology remains in the Catholic Church. Conscience will always and should always play a role in Catholic moral theology and in the moral life of Christians. After all, conscience is a reality in human experience, and it is also a biblically attested reality. The great Doctors of the Church have always given a significant place to conscience in helping people to discern right from wrong. Prior to the Baroque period, however, conscience did not receive the central role in the Christian moral life. Instead, the central role was given to the beatitudes, the virtues, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and so forth.\n\nThere have always been ‘cases of conscience’ in which the Christian lacks clarity about whether it is permissible to do X or Y, or whether it is better to do X rather than Y. In cases of conscience, the best adjudicator has always been the judgment of prudence; and indeed, for Aquinas, conscience is rightly understood as a judgment that takes place within virtuous prudence. It is prudence, not conscience, that makes the final determination to act in this way or that. Conscience can deliver the correct judgment, but without virtuous prudence, we may resist conscience and act against its judgment; and, besides, conscience’s judgment requires a deliberation (grounded in the principles given by synderesis) and this deliberation can be ill-informed. We may think we are following conscience while actually acting wrongly; and this makes infused prudence, which assists in the formation of conscience, even more important. The heart of the Christian life is charity and configuration to Christ, and conscience cannot take the place of this.\n\nThe heart of the Christian life is charity and configuration to Christ, and conscience cannot take the place of this.\n\nCatholic moral theology, however, has had trouble avoiding placing conscience at the center. In part, this may be due to the needs of the confessional; Catholics have to discern whether we have crossed the line and need to receive the sacrament of reconciliation.\n\nCatholic moral theology has been conscience-centered for at least the past four hundred years, though this perspective has mingled with other more virtue-centered traditions as well. Prior to the Second Vatican Council, Catholic theologians were making a strong push to develop a moral theology that would be more biblical and virtue-centered. They almost succeeded, and one sees the fruits of their efforts in the postconciliar influence of Servais Pinckaers. However, mainstream academic Catholic moral theology never followed this path.\n\nImmediately after the Council, there already emerged a new, conscience-centered moral theology. This new, conscience-centered moral theology is found in such theologians as Bernhard Haring, Josef Fuchs, and numerous others. It differs from the older conscience-centered moral theology in a variety of ways, but two are most significant. First, it downplays the impact of law upon the conscience (and therefore downplays sin, developing instead a notion of the ‘fundamental option’); and second, it expands the conscience into a multifaceted interior hub that becomes the very center of human interiority and personality, rather than being a quite limited instrument. So the result is what Reinhard Huetter terms ‘sovereign subjectivity’ run amuck, while retaining a strong moralism—though now a moralism that takes its stand upon whatever seems to represent the increase of freedom and autonomy. In the realm of the Christian moral life, the notion of ‘collective conscience’ also comes to play a role so that moral judgments are now predicated upon the interaction of conscience with conscience, building up a certain communal sense (grounded in what seems reasonable to consciences, not grounded in revelation), even while the new, conscience-centered morality rejects the notion that any specific kind of act can ever be universally wrong or ‘intrinsically evil’.\n\nTo try to get to the bottom of how the new, conscience-centered morality (so-called “progressive” morality) replaced the old one (that of the moral manuals) just at the very moment when it seemed as though the biblical and virtue-centered approach was going to take over, I began to research this book. Essentially, the book is something of a textbook-style introduction (albeit a rather difficult one) or a short ‘history’ of twentieth-century Catholic moral theology. It has four chapters. The first two are preparatory. In chapter one, I trace the emerging critique of conscience-centered moral theology among biblical scholars and moral theologians interested in the Bible, along with the defense of conscience-centered moral theology as ‘biblical’ by some Catholics, as well as the influence of classically liberal theology that attempted to measure revelation by the norms of conscience as part of reducing Christianity to ethics. The second chapter treats the moral manuals, which were conscience-centered, but which most people have heard about only in name and have never read. The final two chapters get to the heart of the matter. The third chapter displays the renewal movement that took place during the twentieth century from within Thomistic circles, pushing toward a virtue-centered moral theology. The fourth chapter shows the roots and emergence of the new, conscience-centered moral theology from within German circles influenced especially by the existentialist ethics of Heidegger and Jaspers, and combining this existentialist ethics with the old conscience-centered moral theology to produce the postconciliar hybrid. I should note that each of these chapters proceeds rather ploddingly as surveys or summaries of 6–8 key figures spanning the period. The result is intended to be a fair, accurate rendering of the major figures and movements in twentieth-century Catholic moral theology, showing how we arrived at the place where we are today.\n\nTo try to get to the bottom of how the new, conscience-centered morality (so-called “progressive” morality) replaced the old one (that of the moral manuals) just at the very moment when it seemed as though the biblical and virtue-centered approach was going to take over, I began to research this book.\n\nIf Catholic moral theology wants to move forward today, it needs to part ways with the sovereign-subjectivity and reason-centered outlook of the new, conscience-centered morality, and to turn to the deeper sense of configuration to Christ offered by biblical and virtue-centered morality. This allows for a much more accurate understanding of conscience itself, in its limited but valuable role. The heart of the matter is that the radical and life-giving Gospel is not going to be preached until the Catholic Church is able to recall believers to the depths of charity and the other virtues, measured by Jesus Christ and guided by his Spirit.\n\nThe Abuse of Conscience is available for purchase at Eerdmans.com, Barnes & Noble, and Amazon.com."
