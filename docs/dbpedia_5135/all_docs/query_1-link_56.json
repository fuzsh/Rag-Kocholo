        "text": "Emotional intelligence (AKA EI or EQ for \"emotional quotient\") is the ability to perceive, interpret, demonstrate, control, evaluate, and use emotions to communicate with and relate to others effectively and constructively. This ability to express and control emotions is essential, but so is the ability to understand, interpret, and respond to the emotions of others. Some experts suggest that emotional intelligence is more important than IQ for success in life.\n\nHow Do I Know If I'm Emotionally Intelligent?\n\nSome key signs and examples of emotional intelligence include:\n\nAn ability to identify and describe what people are feeling\n\nAn awareness of personal strengths and limitations\n\nSelf-confidence and self-acceptance\n\nThe ability to let go of mistakes\n\nAn ability to accept and embrace change\n\nA strong sense of curiosity, particularly about other people\n\nFeelings of empathy and concern for others\n\nShowing sensitivity to the feelings of other people\n\nAccepting responsibility for mistakes\n\nThe ability to manage emotions in difficult situations\n\nHow Is Emotional Intelligence Measured?\n\nA number of different assessments have emerged to measure levels of emotional intelligence. Such tests generally fall into one of two types: self-report tests and ability tests.\n\nSelf-report tests are the most common because they are the easiest to administer and score. On such tests, respondents respond to questions or statements by rating their own behaviors. For example, on a statement such as \"I often feel that I understand how others are feeling,\" a test-taker might describe the statement as disagree, somewhat disagree, agree, or strongly agree.\n\nIf you are taking an emotional intelligence test administered by a mental health professional, here are two measures that might be used:\n\nMayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) is an ability-based test that measures the four branches of Mayer and Salovey's EI model. Test-takers perform tasks designed to assess their ability to perceive, identify, understand, and manage emotions.\n\nEmotional and Social Competence Inventory (ESCI) is based on an older instrument known as the Self-Assessment Questionnaire and involves having people who know the individual offer ratings of that person’s abilities in several different emotional competencies. The test is designed to evaluate the social and emotional abilities that help distinguish people as strong leaders.\n\nThere are also plenty of more informal online resources, many of them free, to investigate your emotional intelligence.\n\nTry Our Free Emotional Intelligence Test\n\nOur fast and free EQ test can help you determine whether or not your responses to certain situations in life indicate a high level of emotional intelligence:\n\nThis EQ test was reviewed by Steven Gans, MD.\n\nWhat Are the 4 Components of Emotional Intelligence?\n\nResearchers suggest that there are four different levels of emotional intelligence including emotional perception, the ability to reason using emotions, the ability to understand emotions, and the ability to manage emotions.\n\nPerceiving emotions: The first step in understanding emotions is to perceive them accurately. In many cases, this might involve understanding nonverbal signals such as body language and facial expressions.\n\nReasoning with emotions: The next step involves using emotions to promote thinking and cognitive activity. Emotions help prioritize what we pay attention and react to; we respond emotionally to things that garner our attention.\n\nUnderstanding emotions: The emotions that we perceive can carry a wide variety of meanings. If someone is expressing angry emotions, the observer must interpret the cause of the person's anger and what it could mean. For example, if your boss is acting angry, it might mean that they are dissatisfied with your work, or it could be because they got a speeding ticket on their way to work that morning or that they've been fighting with their partner.\n\nManaging emotions: The ability to manage emotions effectively is a crucial part of emotional intelligence and the highest level. Regulating emotions and responding appropriately as well as responding to the emotions of others are all important aspects of emotional management.\n\nThe four branches of this model are arranged by complexity with the more basic processes at the lower levels and the more advanced processes at the higher levels. For example, the lowest levels involve perceiving and expressing emotion, while higher levels require greater conscious involvement and involve regulating emotions.\n\nWhy Is Emotional Intelligence Useful?\n\nInterest in teaching and learning social and emotional intelligence has grown in recent years. Social and emotional learning (SEL) programs have become a standard part of the curriculum for many schools.\n\nThe goal of these initiatives is not only to improve health and well-being but also to help students succeed academically and prevent bullying. There are many examples of how emotional intelligence can play a role in daily life.\n\nThinking Before Reacting\n\nEmotionally intelligent people know that emotions can be powerful, but also temporary. When a highly charged emotional event happens, such as becoming angry with a co-worker, the emotionally intelligent response would be to take some time before responding.\n\nThis allows everyone to calm their emotions and think more rationally about all the factors surrounding the argument.\n\nGreater Self-Awareness\n\nEmotionally intelligent people are not only good at thinking about how other people might feel but they are also adept at understanding their own feelings. Self-awareness allows people to consider the many different factors that contribute to their emotions.\n\nEmpathy for Others\n\nA large part of emotional intelligence is being able to think about and empathize with how other people are feeling. This often involves considering how you would respond if you were in the same situation.\n\nHow You Can Practice Emotional Intelligence\n\nEmotional intelligence can be used in many different ways in your daily life. Some different ways to practice emotional intelligence include:\n\nBeing able to accept criticism and responsibility\n\nBeing able to move on after making a mistake\n\nBeing able to say no when you need to\n\nBeing able to share your feelings with others\n\nBeing able to solve problems in ways that work for everyone\n\nHaving empathy for other people\n\nHaving great listening skills\n\nKnowing why you do the things you do\n\nNot being judgemental of others\n\nEmotional intelligence is essential for good interpersonal communication. Some experts believe that this ability is more important in determining life success than IQ alone. Fortunately, there are things that you can do to strengthen your own social and emotional intelligence.\n\nUnderstanding emotions can be the key to better relationships, improved well-being, and stronger communication skills.\n\nFollow Now: Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts\n\nAre There Downsides to Emotional Intelligence?\n\nHaving lower emotional intelligence skills can lead to a number of potential pitfalls that can affect multiple areas of life including work and relationships. People who have fewer emotional skills tend to get in more arguments, have lower quality relationships, and have poor emotional coping skills.\n\nBeing low on emotional intelligence can have a number of drawbacks, but having a very high level of emotional skills can also come with challenges. For example:\n\nResearch suggests that people with high emotional intelligence may actually be less creative and innovative.\n\nHighly emotionally intelligent people may have a hard time delivering negative feedback for fear of hurting other people's feelings.\n\nResearch has found that high EQ can sometimes be used for manipulative and deceptive purposes.\n\nCan I Boost My Emotional Intelligence?\n\nWhile some people might come by their emotional skills naturally, some evidence suggests that this is an ability you can develop and improve. For example, a 2019 randomized controlled trial found that emotional intelligence training could improve emotional abilities in workplace settings.\n\nBeing emotionally intelligent is important, but what steps can you take to improve your own social and emotional skills? Here are some tips.\n\nListen\n\nIf you want to understand what other people are feeling, the first step is to pay attention. Take the time to listen to what people are trying to tell you, both verbally and non-verbally. Body language can carry a great deal of meaning. When you sense that someone is feeling a certain way, consider the different factors that might be contributing to that emotion.\n\nEmpathize\n\nPicking up on emotions is critical, but we also need to be able to put ourselves into someone else's shoes in order to truly understand their point of view. Practice empathizing with other people. Imagine how you would feel in their situation. Such activities can help us build an emotional understanding of a specific situation as well as develop stronger emotional skills in the long-term.\n\nReflect\n\nThe ability to reason with emotions is an important part of emotional intelligence. Consider how your own emotions influence your decisions and behaviors. When you are thinking about how other people respond, assess the role that their emotions play.\n\nWhy is this person feeling this way? Are there any unseen factors that might be contributing to these feelings? How to your emotions differ from theirs? As you explore such questions, you may find that it becomes easier to understand the role that emotions play in how people think and behave."
