        "text": "1888–91: Vegetarianism and Spiritualism in London\n\nDuring his three-year student life in London, Gandhi actively associated with the London Vegetarian Society. He read books on vegetarianism in conjunction with his legal training. Strikingly, the growth of the vegetarian movement during this era was concordant with the rise of modern spiritualism.Footnote 21 The books that Gandhi read were on matters beyond bio-physical concerns. For instance, he read The Perfect Way in Diet (1881) by Anna Kingsford, an eminent writer of the Theosophical Society and a strong promoter of vegetarianism. Kingsford argued that there was an intimate connection between vegetarianism and the cultivation of one’s spiritual-moral sensibility: “For with all these the first essential step towards [spiritual] perfectionment…was so to regulate life that its sustenance should involve no shock to the moral conscience” (1881: 118).Footnote 22\n\nThrough his interaction with theosophical friends, Gandhi met Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society, in 1889. Gandhi eventually became an associate member of the Society in 1891. He read her book, The Key to Theosophy (Blavatsky 1889), which elaborated on metaphysical and occultist connotations of the concept of conscience. Blavatsky wrote: “By the use of our higher reason, spiritual intuition and moral sense, and by following the dictates of what we call ‘the still small voice’ of our conscience, which is that of our EGO, and which speaks louder in us than the earthquakes and the thunders of Jehovah, wherein ‘the Lord is not’” (1889: 240).Footnote 23\n\nGandhi also recalled in Satyanā Prayogo athvā Ātmakathā, his so-called Autobiography, that he had carefully read H. S. Salt’s A Pea for Vegetarianism (1886). The book played a fundamental role in establishing his early conviction concerning vegetarianism. It was crucial in arousing Gandhi’s interest in terms of the economic benefits of the practice and furnishing him with the idea to connect vegetarian issues with socio-moral reform.Footnote 24 According to Salt, the flesh diet in Europe existed not primarily for nutritious reasons, but because of people’s zest for “good taste.”Footnote 25 Being “fed on the loathsome carcases of slaughtered sheep and bullocks” was, said Salt, degrading for men and should unquestionably go against one’s “conscience” (1886: 28).\n\nGandhi only noted a self-conscious impression from the New Testament’s Sermon on the Mount in terms of biblical references. Yet, he may have come across several descriptions of conscience in the Book of Acts and the Epistles of Paul and Peter. In addition to the influences discussed here, we must add that Gandhi was also exposed to the “non-conformist conscientious objection” prevalent in British society.Footnote 26 These books and the wind and tide of the late Victorian era contributed to the intellectual evolution of Gandhi’s concept of conscience.\n\n1893–1914: Politico-Spiritual Maturation in South Africa\n\nAs earlier works have pointed out, the very basis of Gandhi’s political and religious identity was formed during his twenty-one-year sojourn in South Africa, where he developed his concept of conscience.Footnote 27 The first reference to the idea of conscience during his South African years is in his unpublished handbook entitled Guide to London, written sometime in 1893–94.Footnote 28 While recalling his student years in London, Gandhi recommended readers adopt simple living by avoiding “all the luxuries” such as “tea, coffee, tobacco and wines, last but not least, flesh foods” (CWMG 1: 88). As support, Gandhi cited Tolstoy (1903: 31) concerning “the warning voice of conscience” (CWMG 1: 89).\n\nIn his early years in South Africa, Gandhi passionately searched for cultural identity and read more than eighty books on various world religions.Footnote 29 Among them, Tolstoy’s writings professedly had a profound influence on Gandhi. In particular, his The Kingdom of God Is Within You had a lasting impact on him throughout his life.Footnote 30 In it, Tolstoy elaborated on the concept of the “(irrefutable voice of) conscience” as he insisted upon the ineluctable duty of “non-resistance” when confronting malevolent social systems:\n\nOur whole life is in flagrant contradiction with all that we know and believe to be necessary and right.…We seem to have forgotten what we know and to have put aside for the present what we believe in (and cannot but believe in for it is the sole basis of our life), and to do the very opposite of what our conscience and common sense require (1960: 136–37).Footnote 31\n\nContemporaneously, Gandhi diligently read works by Henry David Thoreau, particularly his essay “On the Duty of Civil Disobedience.”Footnote 32 From September 1907 onwards, Gandhi repeatedly introduced Thoreau’s idea of civil disobedience in his weekly journal Indian Opinion because he believed the essence of his satyāgraha was brilliantly conceptualized in Thoreau’s essay.Footnote 33 Thoreau wrote that civil disobedience was chiefly a vehicle for privileging his “[higher law of] conscience” over unjust law: “It is truly enough said, that a corporation [with an unjust legislator] has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with a conscience. Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice” (2015: 191; emphasis in the original).Footnote 34\n\nEthical Religion by William M. Salter, a prominent lecturer for the Ethical Culture Society in Chicago, also made a considerable impression on Gandhi.Footnote 35 It was originally issued in 1889 by the Rationalist Press Association, whose president at the time was Gorge Jacob Holyoke; the publisher was one of the major promoters of Charles Bradlaugh’s books. Ethical Religion underscored an essential requisite of following one’s internal “voice of conscience,” which was viewed as the basis of all human moral sensibility and was compatible with one’s rational intellect.Footnote 36\n\nIn addition to his contact with “Western” thought, we should also examine non-Western influences upon Gandhi during his stay in South Africa, though many were hybrid. Throughout his life, Gandhi confessed several times that his most significant religious influence was Śrīmad Rājcandra, an ingenuous Jain ascetic in Gandhi’s native land Gujarat.Footnote 37 Through Gandhi’s reading of Rājcandra’s Mokṣamāḷā (“The Garland of Liberation,” 2010) and his correspondence with him between 1894 and 1896, Gandhi reported having become well acquainted with the philosophy of ātmā/ātman or ātmajñān (knowledge of ātmā).Footnote 38 Gandhi wrote in Satyanā Prayogo that Rājcandra was the first thinker to convince Gandhi that “there is no other religion than Hindu religion (hindūdharm) where there are subtle and deep/mystic ideas (sūkṣam ane gūḍh vicaro), [teachings of] introspection of ātmā (ātmanirīkṣaṇ), and compassion (dayā)” (AK: 146). When considering the development of Gandhi’s concept of conscience, Rājcandra’s ideas on ātmajñān had a decisive effect in terms of two points. First, Rājcandra reiterated that a spiritual seeker (mumukṣ) could attain the perfect knowledge (jñān) and the realization/liberation of ātmā (mokṣ) during their lifetime by their conscious efforts.Footnote 39 Such an idea of ātmajñān was entirely different from the justificatio sola fide, the prevalent Christian Protestant soteriology which Gandhi encountered while interacting with his Evangelical friends during his early years in South Africa.Footnote 40 And second, Rājcandra alleged that to attain ātmajñān, strict bodily discipline was indispensable. His idea was explained through the Jain/Hindu concept of brahmacarya (asceticism, celibacy). From 1902 onwards, due to his interaction with Rājcandra, Gandhi became gradually aware of the importance of practicing brahmacarya to strictly control his sexual desire and change his dietary habits.Footnote 41\n\nPrimarily due to his contact with Rājcandra,Footnote 42 Gandhi became progressively more mindful of the need to find Gujarati philosophical terms corresponding to the English concept of conscience.Footnote 43 Although the word “antarātmā” did not yet appear, various Gujarati expressions were employed in its place during Gandhi’s South African period, such as āpṇuṃ antar śuṃ kahe che (what our insides say),Footnote 44potāno rūh athvā ātmā ([one’s] own spirit and soul/self),Footnote 45tenā dilmāṃ khudā vasśe ne kaheśe (in his heart, God will inhabit and tell), khudā teonā dilmāṃ āvśe (God will come in their heart),Footnote 46śuddh bhāv (pure sentiment/emotion),Footnote 47jñānpūrvak (knowingly/consciously),Footnote 48man sākṣī pūre che ([my] mind fully testifies),Footnote 49lāgnī (emotion/feeling),Footnote 50man sākṣī che ([my] mind testifies),Footnote 51 and tenā ātmā udgāro (the utterances of his soul/self).Footnote 52\n\nGandhi’s understanding of the conceptual relationship between ātmā and brahmacarya was also deepened by reading Svāmī Vivekānanda’s English translations of Sanskrit texts and his own analysis of them.Footnote 53 Gandhi first read Vivekānanda’s Raja Yoga (1908), a commentary on Patañjali’s Yogasūtra, in 1903.Footnote 54 In Raja Yoga, Vivekānanda explicitly wrote that “all the orthodox systems of Indian philosophy have one goal in view, the liberation of the soul [ātman] through perfection” (1908: ii). He emphasized that the vow of brahmacarya was inevitable when it came to the liberation of ātmā. This was not only because the vow was, argued Vivekānanda, beneficial in terms of moral perfection, but also because it provided the practitioner with miraculous spiritual power. The essential significance of brahmacarya was, according to him, to transform one’s vital/sex energy/semen (vīrya) into spiritual power (ojas), which would then have a positive effect on the physical world.Footnote 55 By observing the vow of brahmacarya, a man’s “chaste brain” would acquire “tremendous energy and gigantic will power” (Vivekānanda 1908: 142–43). “The gigantic will powers of the world, the world-movers, can bring their Prana into a high state of vibration, and it is so great and powerful that it catches others in a moment, and thousands are drawn towards them, and half the world think as they do” (Vivekānanda 1908: 32). We can see Vivekānanda’s influence on this subject in Gandhi’s Hind Svarāj and other writings on brahmacarya published during his first satyāgraha campaign.Footnote 56\n\nTherefore, during his years in South Africa, Gandhi became deeply acquainted with ideas of conscience expressed in English by Thoreau and Salter, as well as those ideas of Tolstoy expressed in translation from Russian into English, while he was also learning about Rājcandra’s and Vivekānanda’s ideas concerning ātmā and brahmacarya. By combining ideas from the (putative) “West” and the (putative) “non-West,” Gandhi eventually established his unique understanding of conscience/ātmā.\n\nAfter absorbing these ideas, Gandhi reported in May 1906 that he experienced a “churning of the heart” (hṛdaymanthan) while organizing the Indian volunteer ambulance corps in response to the Zulu Rebellion.Footnote 57 Because of this, in late July 1906, Gandhi decided to take a lifelong vow of brahmacarya. Significantly, it was only about a month after taking this vow that Gandhi, while insisting upon the duty to be obedient to one’s law/voice of conscience, or ātmā, suddenly embarked upon his mass satyāgraha campaign to combat the racial injustice imposed on Indian immigrants in South Africa.Footnote 58 Gandhi referred to satyāgraha as “ātmabaḷ” (the force of ātmā). He believed that his campaign could only be undertaken when his vital energy, an essential ingredient for ātmabaḷ, was boosted by observing brahmacarya.Footnote 59 Gandhi’s concept of conscience/ātmā had entered a distinctly new phase by this juncture.\n\nThe Intellectual Evolution: From 1915 to 1948\n\nIn this section, I will divide Gandhi’s thirty-three-year stay in India into five parts: (1) 1915–19, (2) 1919–22, (3) 1922–30, (4) the 1930s, and (5) the 1940s. This will enable an exploration of the chronological evolution of Gandhi’s concept of conscience, or antarātmā, from his return to India until the period after Partition.\n\n1915–19: The Indigenization of Terminology\n\nThe first two references to the concept of conscience in English after Gandhi’s return to India can be found in Gandhi’s speeches upon Gopal Krishna Gokhale’s death on February 19, 1915. The next day, on February 20, Gandhi said in a speech at Śāntiniketan: “He [Gokhale] had a great struggle during the latter days of his life, a struggle with his conscience” (CWMG 13: 27). Then, on March 3, at a condolence meeting in Poona, he said, as reported in The Amrita Bazar Patrika (March 5, 1915): “One thing he [Gandhi] would like to mention and that was the deep-seated religious feelings of the man [Gokhale] from which sprang a thoroughness which was one of his chief characteristics. He also possessed a conscience” (CWMG 13: 33).\n\nIt is important to note that Gandhi regarded Gokhale not only as his “political guru” (CWMG 13: 226), but also for “the deep-seated religious feelings of the man” (33), for Gokhale was generally acknowledged as a secularist politician. Indeed, the idea of “the spiritualization of politics” was addressed by Gokhale more than a decade before Gandhi’s return to India.Footnote 60 Gandhi’s idea of conscience was thus to be defined beyond the ambit of the religious-secular dichotomy: “God is conscience. He is even the atheism of the atheist” (YI, March 5, 1925).\n\nThen, from April 1917 onwards, Gandhi began to investigate Campāraṇ farmers who had allegedly been suffering under the foreign owners of indigo plantations. During his research, Gandhi was ordered to leave by the state government, but he refused to comply, resulting in his arrest and a court appearance. There, Gandhi gave one of his famous speeches explaining the reason for his disobedience of the law by referring to the concept of conscience: “I have ventured to make this statement not in any way in extenuation of the penalty to be awarded against me, but to show that I have disregarded the order served upon me, not for want of respect for lawful authority, but in obedience of the higher law of our being—the voice of conscience” (CWMG 13: 375).Footnote 61\n\nFollowing Gandhi’s return to India, the first possible Gujarati equivalent term for the concept of conscience appears in a private letter written by Gandhi to his second cousin, Jamnādās Gāndhī, on May 12, 1917. After 1911, Jamnādās lived with Gandhi for four years at his āśrams in South Africa. Gandhi may have seen in Jamnādās the same as he saw in Jamnādās’ elder brother Maganlāl Gāndhī: the potential to become a future eminent satyāgrahī. Gandhi, therefore, had an invariably keen interest in Jamnādās’ moral and intellectual development. Jamnādās was just twenty-one or twenty-two years old. Gandhi’s hopes for Jamnādās led to write to him that “if you would not prove to be [an ideal man] according to [my] expectation, [that means that] my ability of judging/assessing (parīkṣāśakti) [people] would be estimated to zero” (GA 13: 356). Yet, in order not to place Jamnādās under an excessive pressure of expectation, Gandhi also told him that “my ātmā also clearly testifies (māro ātmā paṇ em j sākṣī pure) that I am not a [good] man of judgement” and was careful to bless Jamnādās regardless of the lifepath he would take thereafter (GA 13: 356).\n\nSeveral months after this letter, the word “antarātmā” was likely to have appeared in Gandhi’s Hindi speech at the Bihar Students’ Conference held in Bhagalpur on October 15, 1917.Footnote 62 At this conference, Gandhi opined that while he admitted that English was practical as the “administrative language” (rājyanī bhāṣā) (GA 14: 7) in India, Hindi should be the “national language” (rāṣṭrīya bhāṣā) so that Indian education could be carried out via their “mother tongue” (mātṛbhāṣā) (GA 14: 5).Footnote 63 Gandhi contended that\n\nwe have been disrespecting [our] mother tongue. [Therefore,] we must suffer an arduous consequence of this sin (pāp).…It is indeed our own duty (kartavya) to shape and enhance [our own] language.…If we cannot elevate (unnati) [our] mother tongue and we hold such a principle that we can show and develop [our] higher thoughts (ūñcā vicāro) only by English, there is not the slightest doubt that we may forever remain to be slaves (gulām) [of foreign rule] (GA 14: 5–6).\n\nHe further emphasized that the purpose of education was to make a man “virtuous” (sadācārī) by cultivating his “character” (cāritr) so he may acquire his “ātmajñān” and observe the “religious vows” (vrato) such as satya (truth), ahiṃsā (non-killing), brahmacarya (chastity), aparigrah (non-possession), asteya (non-stealing), and nirbhaytā (fearlessness) (GA 14: 7). At the end of his speech, Gandhi questioned students on whether they were leading a “native” (deśī) way of life. He finally suggested that they find their answers by reflecting upon themselves and “satisfy[ing] your [their] antarātmā” (tamārā antarātmāne santośjo) (GA 14: 12).\n\nInsofar as I can see, this is the first text where the word “antarātmā” appears in GA and SGV. However, the original Hindi report on this speech has been lost. The available Gujarati article in GA is a reproduction of the report included in Mahātmā Gāndhīnī Vicārsṛṣṭi (“Mahātmā Gandhi’s Thought”) published and translated by Mathurādās Trikamjī in 1919. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive claim that Gandhi himself referred to the term “antarātmā” in his original speech. Regardless, this speech is vital because Gandhi had disclosed his sincere regard for the political issues revolving around national/native languages. It is likely to assume that Gandhi began to use the term “antarātmā” sometime around this period.Footnote 64\n\nMoreover, in a Gujarati letter to Candulāl written on November 22, 1917, Gandhi again explained the equivalent Gujarati idea of conscience in relation to Hindu religious vows. Gandhi elaborated on the metaphysical connotation of the vow of truth (satya) and the concepts of brahm/brahman, brahmacarya, and ahiṃsā by referring to a proverbial saying from the Manusmṛti.Footnote 65 After explicating these, Gandhi said that an opponent of a truth follower would spontaneously recognize the truthfulness of the truth follower via the opponent’s ātmā: “His [opponent’s] ātmā testifies that (teno ātmā sākṣī pure ke) what was said about him [by the truth follower] was purely motivated and true” (GA 14: 86).\n\nFrom February 22 to March 18, 1918, Gandhi led a strike, or satyāgraha struggle, for textile millworkers in Ahmedabad to increase their low wages. During this period, Gandhi hit on the idea of using a public fast as critical leverage for his peaceful protest. Before taking up his fast that lasted three days, on March 1, 1918, Gandhi wrote a Gujarati letter to Ambālāl Sārābhāī, a millowner as well as a secret donor to Gandhi’s Sābarmatī Āśram, suggesting that he “listen to the tiny sound/voice [that] occurred in your [Ambālāl’s] heart (āpnā hṛdaymāṃ thatā jhīṇāFootnote 66nād)” to discern the right course of action (Desāī 1950: 48). Besides, on the first day of the fast, Gandhi remarked in Gujarati that his satyāgraha struggle was carried out under the perspective of “my ātmā” (mārā ātmā)Footnote 67 (GA 14: 223).\n\nTwo months after the Kheḍā Satyāgraha in Kheda District, Gujarat, Gandhi suffered seriously from dysentery and reluctantly began drinking goat’s milk to aid his recovery. This incident marked his violation of the vow of milk renouncement (dūdhnā tyāg) taken with Herman Kallenbach in South Africa in 1912.Footnote 68 Gandhi had first learned from Rājcandra that drinking milk caused “sexual desire” (indriyavikār, kām), which posed the most significant obstacle to observing the vow of brahmacarya.Footnote 69 Gandhi’s Gujarati letter to Maganlāl Gāndhī on January 10, 1919, reported that drinking goat’s milk never ceased to prick his “antarātmā”: “Despite of this permission [to drink milk], not for a single moment, [my] antarātmā did not ask me, ‘Why [are you doing] this much of labor?’” (GA 15: 69). This, according to my research, is Gandhi’s first recorded reference to the concept of antarātmā in Gujarati. From then onwards, the word “antarātmā” became Gandhi’s most used equivalent term for the English idea of conscience in Gujarati and Hindi.\n\n1919–22: Innovating Nationalist Discourse\n\nBefore the inauguration of the all-India hartāl (strike) against the Rowlatt Bills, Gandhi made a public speech on satyāgraha in English on March 18, 1919, stating that “there are times when you have to obey a call which is the highest of all, i.e., the voice of conscience, even though such obedience may cost many a bitter tear, nay, even more, separation from friends, from family, from the State to which you may belong, from all that you have held as dear as life itself” (CWMG 15: 138). From then, Gandhi’s English concept of conscience became one of the key pillars in his nationalist speeches on satyāgraha.Footnote 70\n\nSoon after launching the hartāl, several mass riots in Northern India broke out and Colonel Reginald Edward Harry Dyer ordered the British Indian army to fire on peaceful protesters during the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Gandhi realized that people were not yet ready for undertaking a peaceful satyāgraha, and thus he decided to suspend his campaign on April 18, 1919. Gandhi was faced with an urgent need to develop a “disciplined conscience” and to provide his countrymen with more specific techniques to control their physical instincts (that is, sexual desire, appetite, anger, and hatred), or yamaniyamas.Footnote 71\n\nA few months before the first Non-Cooperation movement, Gandhi and his colleagues published, on March 25, 1920, the Report of the Commissioners Appointed by the Punjab Sub-Committee of the Indian National Congress. In it, Gandhi, for the first time, referred to the concept of conscience while recounting the stories of the Hindu saints Prahlād and Mīrābāī.Footnote 72 And during the movement, Gandhi began to use Gujarati expressions such as antarnād (inner sound/voice),Footnote 73antarno avāj (inner voice),Footnote 74 and ātmanād (sound/voice of ātmā)Footnote 75 alongside those he had used before the movement, such as antarātmā,Footnote 76māro ātmā to sākṣī pūre che (my ātmā clearly testifies),Footnote 77 and māro ātmā (my ātmā).Footnote 78\n\n1922–30: The New Terminology of the “Inner Voice”\n\nGandhi’s abrupt announcement of the cessation of the first Non-Cooperation movement astonished Congress leaders and nationwide patriotic supporters. He confessed to his “Himalayan miscalculation” and recognition of “the warning” of “God” conveyed to him through the “Caurī Caurā incident,” where twenty-three police officers were killed in a furious peasant revolt.Footnote 79 Gandhi believed that their failure to observe brahmacarya, and thus control their passions, was one of the root causes of the violent incident.Footnote 80 Gandhi was imprisoned in the Yaravadā Jail in Pune soon after the suspension of the movement. Yet, this two-year period in jail was not without its benefits; Gandhi was permitted access to a stack of books, allowing him to garner new knowledge and reconsider his nationalist agenda.\n\nFollowing his release from jail, Gandhi, still insisting upon the necessity of “self-control/discipline,” deliberately began to make frequent use of the English expression “inner voice,” which corresponded with the Gujarati concepts of antarnād or antarno avāj, in his official publications.Footnote 81 At the same time, references to the English word “conscience” were gradually diminished in number though not entirely displaced.\n\nDuring his incarceration, Gandhi read Bal Gangadhar Tilak’s Śrīmad Bhagavadgītā-Rahasya or Karma-Yoga-Śāstra (1935)Footnote 82 and learned that there was no equivalent word for “conscience” in Sanskrit literature. In the Navajīvan of September 16, 1928, Gandhi stated in Gujarati:\n\nṬiḷak Maharāj has said: among us, there is no word corresponding to “kŏnśyans.”Footnote 83 We do not believe that there is “kŏnśyans” in everyone, [but] in the West [they] believe.…Therefore, Ṭiḷak Maharāj turned down “kŏnśyans.”Footnote 84 Our ṛṣi [and] munis have said that in order to listen to antarnād, the antarkān (inner ear) was indispensable, [and also] the antarcakṣu (inner eye) was indispensable. In order to acquire these [spiritual organs], saṃyam (self-control) was indispensable.Footnote 85\n\nFurthermore, Gandhi also explored the etymology of the English word “conscience” in Young India of September 23, 1926:\n\nHave all people a conscience? Has a cannibal a conscience? Must he be allowed to act according to the dictates of his conscience, which tells him that it is his duty to kill and eat his fellows? Now, the etymological meaning of conscience is “true knowledge.” The dictionary meaning is “faculty distinguishing between right and wrong and influencing conduct accordingly.” Possession of such a faculty is possible only for a trained person, that is, one who has undergone discipline and learned to listen to the inner voice.\n\nFrom the mid-1920s onwards, although not rigorously, Gandhi started to differentiate between the English word “conscience” and the phrase “inner voice.” Gandhi explained that the latter signified the “Indian” concepts of antarnād or antarno avāj which were linked with the Hindu ascetic tradition of saṃyaṃ/(self-)discipline. On the contrary, the former concept of conscience was, strictly speaking, only believed to exist in the West universally. His growing awareness of the importance of brahmacarya made Gandhi prefer the concept of inner voice over conscience.\n\nThe 1930s: The Fasts and the “Mysterious” Experience\n\nFrom the first Independence movement onwards, Gandhi consistently insisted that untouchability was against his “ātmā.”Footnote 86 His conviction concerning this was most obvious during the early 1930s. He enthusiastically committed himself to several public fasts to abolish untouchability during this period. The best known of these was conducted in September 1932 against the Communal Pact, namely, “the fast-unto-death.” One month before undertaking this fast, Gandhi wrote a Gujarati letter to Premābehen Kaṇṭak regarding the relationship between the fast and the nature of his “inner voice” (andarno avāj). “The inner voice,” he wrote:\n\nis something ineffable (andarno avāj na varṇavī śakāy evī vastu).Footnote 87 But sometimes it seems to us that some inspiration (prerṇā) has occurred from within. It can be said that the time I learned to recognize [the voice] was the time of my prayer. That is, around 1906. Because you are asking, I write this by recalling my memory. Else, I am not aware of any [experience] in my life [that felt like], “hey, now some new experience occurred [to me].” I believe that [just] as hair grows on us [=our body] without knowing, my spiritual life (ādhyātmik jīvan) has grown (GA 50: 326).\n\nHere, Gandhi stated that his “inner voice” was “something ineffable” and expressed the concept equally as an “inner inspiration.” He further remarked that he had perceived this feeling of accessing his inner voice since 1906, the year of his embarkment upon his first satyāgraha campaign in South Africa.\n\nIn May 1933, Gandhi suddenly set out on a twenty-one-day fast.Footnote 88 He reported that he had undergone an unprecedented “mysterious” experience before launching his fast. In his Gujarati journal Harijanbandhu of July 9, 1933, he explained:\n\nFor me, God’s inspiration (īśvarprerṇā), mysterious voice (gebī avāj),Footnote 89 inner inspiration (antaḥprerṇā), delivery of truth (satyano sandeś), etc., are the words which signify one meaning.…During the night in which I had such an inspiration, there was an immense churning in my heart (hṛdaymaṃthan). [My] mind (citt) was in confusion. I could not take it anymore. The burden of responsibility was to crush me. Suddenly, I, then, heard a voice (avāj) [that ordered me to undertake a fast]. I felt it coming from afar, but also felt it very close to me. This experience was special (asādhārṇ). The voice was as if a human being (manuṣya) was saying something to me and was certain.\n\nGandhi expressed this overwhelming experience as “special” and referred to it recurrently in his later life.Footnote 90 He further explained in the same article that to experience such an inspiration, brahmacarya or certain kind of sādhānā (spiritual ascetic practice) was indispensable: “If some efforts and some sādhānā are indispensable [in order] to achieve ordinary things in ordinary life, why is it surprising if [special] efforts and sādhānā to acquire the ability to get inspiration from God (īśvarnī prerṇā) are indispensable?” (HJB, July 9, 1933).\n\nFrom the early 1930s onwards, Gandhi’s idea of inner voice, though no less level-headed, came to be tinged with a “mysterious” (gebī) or “mystical” (gūḍh)Footnote 91 aspect. This indicates a significant shift from his previous approach under the influence of Tolstoy and Salter, where the “mystical” or “irrational” nature of religion was disregarded.Footnote 92\n\n1940s: The Last Phase or “Mahāyajña”\n\nWhen considering Gandhi’s life-long intellectual development, rumination upon his last years during Partition’s turmoil is inevitable. It is now well acknowledged, particularly after Vinay Lal’s (2000) hermeneutic work, that from 1946 onwards, Gandhi entered the last phase of his experiment with brahmacarya. This was called mahāyajña (the great sacrifice) and entailed him sleeping naked next to his nineteen-year-old grandnieceFootnote 93 Manubahen Gandhi.Footnote 94 In an “entirely private” conversation with Svāmī Ānand and Kedār Nāth held March 15/16, 1947,Footnote 95 Gandhi revealed one of the key sources behind his experiments:\n\nEven today, so far as the people, in general, are concerned, I am putting before them for practice what you call my old ideas. At the same time, for myself, as I have said, I have been deeply influenced by modern thought. Even amongst us, the Tantra school has influenced Western savants like Justice Sir John Woodroffe. I read his works in Yeravada prison. You have all been brought up in the orthodox tradition. According to my definition, you cannot be regarded as true brahmacharis (CWMG 87: 91).Footnote 96\n\nGandhi disclosed that during his incarceration period in Yaravadā Jail, he had been “deeply influenced” by the modern Tantric thought described by John Woodroffe. Elsewhere Gandhi reported that he had read Woodroffe’s book, Shakti and Shâkta (1918), in the jail.Footnote 97 Then, how did Tantric ideas, in which the power of śakti (spiritual-sexual energy) is symbolically revered as the Goddess consort of Śiva, affect Gandhi’s understanding of conscience? After Gandhi’s release from the Yaravadā Jail in 1924, he was increasingly inclined to associate his concept of conscience or inner voice with cosmological śakti, which was deemed transcendental to his reason or intellect.Footnote 98 For instance, in discussion with George Joseph, a freedom fighter, on January 13, 1933, Gandhi was asked, “What is the voice of antarātmā?” He answered:Footnote 99\n\nThe voice of antarātmā is our external force (āpṇī bahārnuṃ baḷ), but it is not an exterior force (bāhya baḷ) [which may have no relation to the secular world]. “Our external” means external force [only] from our ahaṅkār [ego, misconceiving self-recognition]. When ahaṅkār is sleeping [=ceases to be functioning], upon it, the two forces [may] function (kām kare che). Sat (being) or asat (non-being). When we are absorbed one with sat force (sat baḷnī sāthe tadākār thaīe chīe), it is said that God (īśvar) is speaking through us in a mystical language (gūḍhFootnote 100bhāṣā).\n\nWe can find more proofs when [we look into] many instances which show only one thing [truth]. Among them, many great people (mahān puruṣo) such as Buddha, Kṛṣṇa, Mahammad are included, and they did not utter (uccāryaṃ) the truth (satya) by their own ability, but through them, some supernatural śakti (alaukik śakti) [functioned and] made them utter it. Some people are such authorities (adhikārī) through whom [such a] supernatural śakti functions (Desāī 1949b: 49–50).\n\nIn 1940, Gandhi further explained his concept of the inner voice concerning “an unseen power” in an English newspaper: “It [the fast] can only be taken in obedience to the promptings of an unseen power, call it the inner voice, God or whatever other name you like to give to that power” (CWMG 73: 156). In his miscellaneous writings in English on February 3, 1946, he again referred to the transcendental essence of his inner voice: “Man is endowed with intellect and with an inner voice which transcends the intellect” (CWMG 83: 408). In the Harijanbandhu of June 22, 1947, Gandhi in turn clarified his ideas in Gujarati concerning the nature of God as śakti: “As a matter of fact, God (īśvar) is śakti, is the essence (tattva); it is pure consciousness (śuddh caitanya), is all-pervading (sarvavyāpak).…There is a great śakti (mahā sakti) we call God (īśvar), which has its laws of usage; but it is quite clear that in order to find such laws, we have to work much harder. The name of such a law [expressed] in one word is brahmacarya.”Footnote 101 Although Gandhi did not outrightly reveal the name of Woodroffe until his last years, the abundance of references to the inner voice as the transcendental power of śakti, as well as his deliberate emphasis on the feminine principle of ahiṃsā, unlike his prior masculine nationalist discourse,Footnote 102 reverberate with Tantric metaphysics.Footnote 103"
