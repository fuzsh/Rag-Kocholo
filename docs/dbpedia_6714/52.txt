Where are solar turbines usually located?

Solar turbines are usually located in sunny, dry areas with abundant land available. Some of the places where solar turbines are commonly located include:

Southern California

Arizona

Nevada

New Mexico

Texas

Chile

Morocco

Algeria

Egypt

Saudi Arabia

These areas receive a lot of sunlight throughout the year, which is essential for solar power generation. They also have large, open spaces that are suitable for solar farms.

Solar turbines can also be located in other areas, but they may be less efficient in places with less sunlight or less available land.
