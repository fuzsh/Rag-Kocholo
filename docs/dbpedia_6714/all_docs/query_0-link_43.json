        "text": "Unlike a conventional combined cycle, the stored energy permits the evaporator to operate independently of the combustion turbine. By preheating the steam cycle using stored energy, the steam turbine can be made ready for operation without fuel consumption, so it can be immediately loaded in coordination with the combustion turbine. LSCC provides the flexibility of a peaking plant with lower fuel consumption than a conventional combined cycle.\n\nConventional practice to boost power (supplemental firing using a duct burner) worsens the fuel heat rate and increases emissions. In contrast, thanks to the large increase in steam flow made possible by the novel arrangement, LSCC has an exceptionally low fuel Heat Rate, less than 5000 kJ/kWh LHV.\n\nThe LSCC approach stores and time-shifts renewable electricity, to displace fuel. This reduces the marginal cost of energy to make the LSCC system more profitable than alternative dispatchable generation.\n\nThe LSCC charges from the grid when electricity prices are low due to renewable over-generation, and discharges when power is needed.\n\nCharging. Liquid salt stored in the cold tank at about 250°C (482°F) is pumped through an electric heater which heats it to 427°C (800°F) for storage in the hot tank. At this temperature, low-cost carbon steel is suitable for vessels and piping. Medium voltage heaters, such as from Chromalox, are economical and efficient, respond quickly to variations in renewable generation, and are infinitely controllable.\n\nStorage. The salt is held in insulated storage tanks, with heat losses typically less than 1°C per day. This type of tank has been used for decades by the Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) industry in the U.S., Spain, and North Africa to provide thousands of Megawatt-hours of energy storage.\n\nLSCC typically uses a low freezing point (142°C/288°F) eutectic salt such as Hitec® salt from Coastal Chemical, to provide months of standby without risk of freezing in the tanks. This also reduces the need to operate heat tracing on piping and valves.\n\nDischarging. Hot liquid salt is pumped from the Hot Tank, through a Steam Generator, and then to the Cold Tank. On the steam side, feedwater is pre-heated by exhaust gas, evaporated in the Steam Generator using stored energy, and then superheated by exhaust gas. Superheated steam produces power in the steam turbine generator, condenses and is recycled as feedwater. In parallel, a combustion turbine produces power and exhaust gas, which is used as described above."
