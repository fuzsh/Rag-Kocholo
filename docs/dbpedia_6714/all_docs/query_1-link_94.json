Sun Historically, people in areas all over the world have ridden Tauros, but the practice is said to have started in Alola. Moon Although it’s known to be a fierce Pokémon, Tauros in the Alola region are said to possess a measure of calmness. Ultra Sun They live in groups. The one with the longest, thickest, and most-scarred horns is the boss of the herd. Ultra Moon The climate seems to be related to the reason Tauros in Alola are a little calmer than those in other regions. Let's Go Pikachu\n\nLet's Go Eevee A rowdy Pokémon with a lot of stamina.
