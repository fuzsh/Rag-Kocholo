        "text": "UConn’s energy requirements are growing as the University continues to construct a number of new buildings as part of its UConn 2000, 21st Century UConn and Next Generation projects.\n\nUConn’s state-of-the-art Co-generation Facility began operation March 15, 2006, replacing several oil-fired utility boilers and enabling the University to meet its own energy needs at the main campus.\n\nCogeneration is defined as the sequential production of both electrical or mechanical energy and useful thermal energy from a single energy source.\n\nThis allows over 80% of the fuel energy to be harnessed, versus 33% from a conventional electric power plant.\n\nHusky Power Meets Storrs Campus Energy Requirements\n\nElectric Capacity: 24.9 Megawatts/Hour\n\nSteam Capacity: 600,000 Pounds/Hour\n\nChilled Water Capacity: 10,300 Tons/Hour\n\nDuring May each year the Husky Power Team takes the Cogeneration Facility off line for maintenance. This maintenance is performed to ensure the Facility continues to operate with high reliability in the most efficient manner. The PowerPoint link below is the May 2022 outage. Many thanks to the dedicated staff and contractors who support this work every year.\n\nSpecial recognition to Edward Ramos Riguard, our student intern, for the media concepts\n\nThe Cogeneration facility provides a two-fold reduction in emissions:\n\n1. Natural gas, a cleaner burning fuel, is used by the facility to generate electricity and steam for heating and evaporative cooling.\n\n2. Steam production in the process removes the need to construct separate steam-production facilities that would burn their own fuel and have their own emissions.\n\nMost power plants on the electric grid are considerably less efficient than co-generation facilities because they do not capture and utilize the steam for heating and cooling. Also, “distributed generation”, like UConn’s Central Utility Plant, prevents the efficiency loss and congestion that occurs during transmission and distribution of electricity from the point of generation to distant electricity customers.\n\nElectrical Description\n\nThe UConn Central Utility Plant uses natural gas, with fuel oil as a back-up fuel source, to fire three Solar Taurus 70 combustion turbine generators to produce electricity. The combustion turbines have a rated thermal efficiency of 34 percent. Waste heat from the turbines is used to produce steam, which is then used in a steam turbine generator to produce additional electricity. Low-pressure steam is distributed for campus use.\n\nThermal Description\n\nHigh pressure 600 psig saturated steam from the RenTech Heat Recovery Steam Generators drives a Tuthill-Murray steam turbine or is reduced by Pressure Control Valves. The medium pressure 127 psig steam turbine exhaust or reduced steam is supplied to internal plant use, to provide Chilled Water via the three York centrifugal chillers or to the UConn Campus Distribution network. The network reduces the steam to low pressure 65 psig for building heating and kitchen service."
