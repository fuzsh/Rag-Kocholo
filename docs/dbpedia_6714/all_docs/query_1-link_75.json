        "text": "GE Vernova’s aeroderivative gas turbine specialists support aero units in all sorts of situations – on land and at sea! As vacationers head to exotic locales aboard their favorite cruise ships, odds are they’ll see a GE One Field Services team aboard too, supporting the turbines that help keep the lights on, the kitchens operating, and the WiFi working. And when it comes time to replace one of the turbines, it’s a delicate operation to get the old engine safely off the ship and install the new one without damaging the vessel in the process.\n\n\"Brigalow Peaking Power Plant can provide… multiple start/stop cycles per day and the ability to ramp up to full power output within a few minutes. This project is an example of how we plan to create clean energy hubs at our power stations to deliver the energy mix needed to reliably transition the grid to renewable energy.\"\n\nDarren Busine\n\nCEO, CS Energy\n\n\"The ESB of Ireland will work with GE Vernova to supply and maintain several LM2500XPRESS aeroderivative gas turbines to the Shannonbridge power plant in central Ireland. The plant is expected to operate as a temporary reserve plant during the 2023-2024 winter season and up through the end of the 2026-2027 winter season.\"\n\nJoseph Anis\n\nPresident & CEO, Europe, Middle East & Africa at GE Vernova’s Gas Power business\n\n\"We’re pleased to be working with technology providers such as GE Gas Power as part of our goals to accelerate the coal-to-gas transition, manage energy shortages, stabilize the grid, and support the growth of renewables in Taiwan. We trust that GE’s aeroderivative gas power technology will help provide fast, flexible and more sustainable power for the people of Taiwan.\"\n\nDirector Hsu\n\n\"We are delighted that we were awarded the contract for the Biblis site. The excellent existing infrastructure there and our reliable and flexible concept for the plant have won out. We will thus be able to make an important contribution towards security of supply in Southern Hesse. We have a long-standing relationship with GE and we’re proud to work together to install the world’s first LM2500XPRESS.\"\n\nRoger Miesen\n\nCEO of RWE Generation\n\n\"The LM2500XPRESS units were purchased to provide safe, affordable and reliable generation to support the increased use of renewable solar and wind power. These natural gas units will help us better integrate renewable energy sources, further reduce CO2 emissions and accelerate the retirement of the Martin Drake Power Plant.\"\n\nAram Benyamin\n\nCEO of Colorado Springs Utilities\n\n\"As the sole distributor of electricity in Jamaica, we see the use of LNG as resulting in greater stability in the price of electricity for our customers. By replacing a 19-year old unit with GE's advanced aeroderivative technology, we’ll be able to deliver more efficient power to our people, our businesses, and our critical facilities.\"\n\nJoseph Williams\n\nSenior Vice President of Generation, JPS\n\n\"The island of Tobago is poised for productive growth, and to fuel that growth it made sense to tender for an additional generator. Our GE LM2500 aeroderivative, with its small footprint and high level of reliability was chosen, and we look forward to its performance for years to come.\"\n\nCourtenay Mark\n\nChief Technical Officer of the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission"
