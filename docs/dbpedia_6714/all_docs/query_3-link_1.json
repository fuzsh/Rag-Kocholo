        "text": "At its Bainbridge, Georgia facilities, Taurus Holdings companies manufacture an incredible array of products from traditional single action revolvers, to pistols and revolvers of various designs, and long guns ranging from classic single shots to modern semi-autos. We employ over three hundred skilled workers and staff, who support manufacturing, importation, service, sales and marketing of Taurus and subsidiary branded firearms.\n\nTaurus International (TIMI) manufactures some models of Taurus brand firearms in the US, and imports the remainder from Taurus Armas. TIMI handles servicing for all Taurus branded firearms in the US either imported or manufactured by TIMI.\n\nBraztech services and imports Rossi branded firearms which are made in Brazil by Taurus Armas.\n\nAll Heritage branded firearms are made and serviced in the US at our facilities in Bainbridge, Georgia.\n\nBased in Porto Alegre, Brasil, Taurus Armas is a diversified, international company and one of the largest small arms manufacturers in the world. The company produced its first revolver in 1941. In 1970, Bangor Punta, which owned Smith & Wesson, purchased a controlling interest in Forjas Taurus. During the next seven years, a great deal of technology and methodology was passed between the two companies.\n\nIn 1974 Beretta had won a contract to produce small arms for the Brazilian Army. The contract required Beretta to build a Brazilian factory and use Brazilian labor. When the contract ran out in 1980, Beretta sold the plant to Forjas Taurus. By that time, Forjas Taurus had new Brazilian controlling owners that had purchased Forjas Taurus from Bangor Punta in 1977. Forjas Taurus now owned everything that once belonged to Beretta, including drawings, tooling, machinery, and employed a very experienced work force. Forjas Taurus was in the pistol business, and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus PT-92 and PT-99 9mm pistols.\n\nThe next milestone for Taurus Armas came in 1982. Taurus Armas formed Taurus Holdings, Inc., in Miami, Florida. Taurus Holdings, in turn formed Taurus International Manufacturing, Inc. The Taurus brand was unknown in the United States at that time. This situation was to change dramatically in the next few years.\n\nIn 1984, Taurus made an announcement that had a tremendous impact on the entire industry. TIMI became the first company to offer its customers an unqualified LIFETIME REPAIR POLICY. This changed the course of the company in the U.S. market. Only recently has this policy been matched. It has never been exceeded. This innovative policy made everyone sit up and take notice of Taurus brand firearms."
