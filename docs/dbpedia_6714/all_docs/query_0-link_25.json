        "text": "Hydroelectricity helped Aotearoa New Zealand decrease its greenhouse gas emissions in 2022. There was more renewable electricity on the grid in 2022 - mainly from hydro - which meant the country used less coal and gas. This was one of the biggest drivers behind a 4% decrease in the country’s gross emissions, compared to 2021. The proportion of hydroelectricity generation in any given year can fluctuate with the weather, but wet conditions were good for generation in 2022. Hydroelectricity made up 60% of all electricity generation in 2022. Wind power on the grid also increased, but as wind only represented 6.5% of total electricity generation, this had a smaller overall impact. The decreases were recorded in New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory, the annual report of all human-induced emissions and removals in New Zealand, which was published on 18 April. As well as energy, other sectors – agriculture, waste and industrial processes - also produced fewer emissions in 2022 than they did in 2021.
