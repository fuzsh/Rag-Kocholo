        "text": "Our most recent look at global LNG takes a look at the crucial roles of China and Russia in driving demand. Our report indicates that natural gas fundamentals in these two areas alone will play a significant role in shaping the future of liquid natural gas (LNG) over the next eight years, and LNG will contribute to approximately 65% of global gas demand growth by 2030. Notably, the report's base case suggests no significant global LNG overbuild until 2030, with around 16 Bcf/d of additional LNG projects expected to come online in North America by that time. https://lnkd.in/e5-zExyN\n\nEuropeâ€™s gas supply may have temporarily stabilized since 2022, But there many challenges left on the horizon. IOGP Europe will soon release fresh data to answer fundamental questions left open: ðŸ”¹ What options does Europe have to rebalance its #naturalgas supplies? ðŸ”¹ Will gas supplies remain safe in the short and long-term? ðŸ”¹ What implications does this have for policymaking? Join us, Rystad Energy and API - American Petroleum Institute as we share the latest insights during our webinar. Register here: https://bitly.ws/33V7d Rob Jennings, Axel Scheuer, Simon SjÃ¸thun, GIE, ENTSOG\n\nWhat does Summer 2024 hold for North American gas and #LNG? In a recent webinar, our experts provided an in-depth view on low gas prices, production deferrals, increased Mexican imports and the recent flipping of the power market import/export dynamic between the US and Canada. in our latest insight, discover our highlights from our #gas webinar: https://okt.to/PEvuLC\n\nWhat does Summer 2024 hold for North American gas and #LNG?

It highlights NEDC long term view of Natural gas, LNG and H2 along with an NEDC patent pending system for cryogenic storage. First, The US uses approximately 100 Quadrillion BTU/year of energy. Natural Gas and LNG are critical components to bridge the gap to a carbon neutral future. H2 energy markets are slow to develop in the US and E-methane and LNG provide a bridge as well. In this article, NEDC presents a Patent Pending system: Full containment, Double SS walls with no bottom penetrations and no internal pumps needed. This is a significant innovation in cryogenic storage and the first major innovation in cryogenic technology in a long time. https://lnkd.in/eUp2mwDU As always, I look forward to your questions and thoughts.
