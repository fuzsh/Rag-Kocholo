Did some reading.\n\nDid i understand it right: Taurus 65 doesn't have flat spot milled on barrel for cylinder clearance, so less chance of cracked barrel mouth than S&W model 65?\n\nI have gp100, blackhawk and Colt 357.\n\nKind of lime a smith action design in 357 also, but not for $700+. In california-used is limited.\n\nAny thoughts on these two?\n\nSent from my SM-G930P using Tapatalk\n\nMany years ago, I once considered picking up a Taurus revolver despite numerous recommendations to avoid them. I read an article that stated Taurus revolvers shouldn't be dry fired or the firing pin might break. I thought that might be Internet nonsense, so I called Taurus customer service and they confirmed it and indeed recommended I don't dry their revolvers or the firing pin mighty break. That was all I needed to know about their quality and durability, so no Taurus wheelguns for me.\n\nI only have experience with one Taurus revolver, a Model 83. This is basically similar to a S&W Model 15.\n\nNo, it's not \"that bad\" I guess depending on your standards. Mine is not accurate. Well it's accurate enough for defensive use and is reliable. But shooting for accuracy I find it inadequate. It adds a couple of inches to my off-hand groups compared to my S&W's. No doubt due to the .361 cylinder throats. I might buy another but I'd have to slug the barrel and take my pin gauges to check the throats.\n\nNow that lack of precision accuracy isn't going to make any difference on a man-sized target at 10 yards. But I'd think twice about trying a head shot.\n\nPlus I keep seeing things like....\n\nAttached Images\n\nscreenshot-www.tkcustom.com 2017-01-29 14-12-02.jpg (19.9 KB, 133 views)\n\nLast edited by glenwolde; 01-29-2017 at 05:12 PM.\n\nIf you buy a Taurus I hope you get a good one, and at that point you will be a big fan and wonder what some of us are complaining about. If you get a bad one, you will understand.\n\nI have a number of S&W revolvers. Love them. I also have some recent Taurus and Rossi revolvers that are remarkably well made. The triggers and fit and finish are excellent. They must have updated the factory in Brazil.\n\nBTW, all hammer-nosed firing pins weaken with extended dry-firing. Most Taurus revolvers though use frame mounted firing pins as does S&W. Many Rossi firing pins though are hammer mounted.\n\nI have a pair of Taurus model 431s, the 5-round 44 Specials made in the 90s. One's a 3\" stainless, the other is the 2 1/2\" blue. I like them both. The fit and finish is excellent and they're pretty darn accurate. Guess that means I'm lucky...\n\nI had a few Taurus revolvers in the late 80's to early 90's, and I had problems with most of them (I got rid of ALL of them and will likely never purchase another).\n\nI have various S&W, Ruger, and Colt revolvers and can't remember ever having problems with any of them, not related to ammo.\n\nI'll let you figure out what I think of Taurus.\n\nI have only had 1 Taurus revolver. Just a 990 .22. It was super accurate. It looked great, and never had any problems. It sold at a decent price too, when I could not get any ammo. In general from what I've seen, people tend to shy away from Taurus be it right or wrong.
