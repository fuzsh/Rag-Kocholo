Specification No. ES 9-62 2 3.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 3.1 SPECIFICATIONS - The following documents of the latest issue in effect on the release date of this specification form a part of this specification to the extent specified herein. Solar ES 9-98 Fuel, Air and Water (or Steam) for Solar Gas Turbine Engines Military MIL-D-16791 Detergents, General Purpose (Liquid, Nonionaic) MIL-F-16884 Fuel Oil, Diesel, Marine MIL-E-9500 Ethylene Glycol, Technical American Society for Testing Materials ASTM D482 Standard Test Method for Ash from Petroleum Products ASTM D512 Chloride Ion in Water and Waste Water, Test for ASTM D770 Standard Specification for Isopropyl Alcohol ASTM D857 Standard Test Methods for Aluminum in Water ASTM D858 Standard Test Methods for Manganese in Water ASTM D1068 Standard Test Methods for Iron in Water ASTM D1293 pH of Water, Test for ASTM D1428 Sodium and Potassium in Water and Water-Formed Deposits by Flame Photometry, Tests for ASTM D1688 Standard Test Methods for Copper in Water ASTM D1888 Particulate and Dissolved Matter, Solids, or Residue in Water ASTM D2699 Standard Specification for Kerosene 4.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 4.1 ON-CRANK VERSUS ON-LINE CLEANING - In general, on-crank cleaning tends to be more effective to remove deposits in the compressor air path. On-line cleaning may be performed in between on-crank cleaning cycles to extend time between on-crank cleaning and to minimize further deposition on to cleaned airfoils. Because the engine is firing during on-line cleaning, the cleaning liquid (either water or cleaning solution) ingested must meet the more stringent requirements defined in this specification to minimize introduction of corrosive/fouling contaminants. 4.2 INTERVALS BETWEEN ENGINE CLEANING – Appropriate intervals for both on-crank and on-line cleaning should be determined by recording and trending engine performance\n\n5. Specification No. ES 9-62 3 degradation. Cost of the maintenance outage versus that of continued operation with compromised performance. must also be considered. However, one should not delay cleaning so long that contamination becomes impossible to remove completely by on-crank cleaning. On- crank cleaning is recommended at maximum intervals of every 4,000 hours operation, and before full load power degrades more than 5%. For two shaft turbines operating at full load on T5 topping this typically corresponds to a 2.5% drop in Pcd. For two shaft turbines operating at full load on Ngp topping, degree of compressor fouling is more difficult to quantify. As the compressor fouls, T5 will increase with little change in power or Pcd until T5 topping is achieved. On-line cleaning intervals should be determined by observing the effectiveness in restoring performance. On-line cleaning is best suited to remove the initial buildup of contamination from already clean airfoils. If the airfoils become significantly fouled between on-line cleaning intervals, cleaning will be less effective. Initial on-line cleaning interval should be at most 48 hours of operation. Performance should then be evaluated to determine effect of each cleaning operation, and overall rate of performance degradation. After completing an on-crank cleaning, on-line cleaning interval can be increased to 72 hours of operation. If no significant difference in on-line cleaning effectivenes is observed, the interval may be increased again by 24 hours. Typically, the maximum interval for an effective on-line cleaning program is no more than 96 hours of operation. Recommended minimum intervals between cleaning operations to avoid excessive ingress of cleaning product into the oil system are: On-Crank Cleaning - at least 96 operating hours between each on-crank cleaning cycle On-Line Cleaning - at least 24 operating hours between each on-line cleaning cycle 4.3 CLEANING PROCEDURES - Detailed cleaning procedures are described in the Operation and Maintenance Instruction (OMI) manual provided with each package. An outline of typical procedures are provided here: On-Crank: • Shut down turbine normally • Cool until turbine case temperature at compressor to diffuser flange is less than 66C (150F) • Open air inlet access covers • Open air inlet drain port • Disconnect and isolate Pcd, buffer air and air sensing lines at connection points to compressor or diffuser • Disconnect combustor, torch and exhaust drain lines • Prepare cleaning product and cleaning equipment • Crank turbine on the starter motor and allow speed to stabilize • Apply cleaning product • Stop turbine and allow cleaning product to soak for a period of 20 minutes • Crank turbine on the starter motor and allow speed to stabilize • Apply rinse water • Verify that rinse water exiting from drains is clean, indicating that compressor cleaning was effective and repeat cleaning operation as necessary • Continue crank for 5-10 minutes after rinse water is consumed • Stop turbine • Inspect inlet housing and compressor inlet to verify cleanliness • Reassemble and reconnect all components and lines • Restart turbine and operate for at least one hour to evaporate remaining rinse water\n\n6. Specification No. ES 9-62 4 On-Line: • Verify that unit is operating normally with steady load and speed • Prepare cleaning product and cleaning equipment • Apply cleaning product • Apply rinse water • Isolate cleaning equipment 4.4 CLEANING EQUIPMENT - Use of cleaning equipment designed specifically for each turbine model is important to ensure that adequate and uniform atomization occurs at the compressor inlet. This is particularly important for on-line cleaning to avoid overloading of airfoils that can result from non-uniform distribution or excessively large liquid droplets. Use of inappropriate equipment may result in compressor damage. Cleaning product is introduced to the turbine inlet through manifolds and nozzles mounted directly to the turbine inlet duct, with separate systems for either on-crank or on-line cleaning. Cleaning product can also be introduced manually using a hand held sprayer wand, but only for on-crank cleaning procedure. With either application method, cleaning product volume and flow rates must comply with the requirements defined in Section 4.8 of this specification. 4.5 AMBIENT TEMPERATURE DURING ENGINE CLEANING – On-line engine cleaning is permitted only at ambient temperatures above 4°C (39°F). On-crank engine cleaning is permitted only at ambient temperatures above -20°C (-4°F). When the ambient temperature is between -20°C (-4°F) and 4°C (39°F), a mixture of water and freeze point depressant must be used for on-crank cleaning. The ratio of the water/freeze point depressant mix depends upon the type of freeze point depressant used, and recommended ratios are listed in Table 1. In order to be effective, the solution must be well mixed immediately prior to use. Table 1. On-Crank Requirements for Water/Freeze Point Depressant Mix Volume Ratio in Cold Ambient Temperatures Ambient Temperature Freeze Point Depressant Volume Ratio Freeze Point Depressant : Water -20°C(-4°F) to 4°C(39°F) Methanol 2 : 3 -20°C(-4°F) to 4°C(39°F) Mono-ethylene Glycol 2 : 3 -10°C(14°F) to 4°C(39°F) Isopropyl Alcohol 1 : 1 4.6 ENGINE TEMPERATURE DURING ENGINE CLEANING - Prior to on-crank cleaning, the engine casing surface temperature, measured at the compressor to diffuser flange shall not exceed 65°C (150°F). 4.7 RECUPERATED CYCLE APPLICATIONS - Water and/or cleaning solutions are not permitted in recuperators except for Harrison and GEA models. For all other recuperator models, on-crank cleaning must be performed at a reduced crank speed of 800 - 900rpm to avoid depositing cleaning refuse in the recuperator. On-line cleaning is not permitted for any recuperated units.\n\n7. Specification No. ES 9-62 5 4.8 FLOW REQUIREMENTS - Tables 2 and 3 list the total volume of fluid and flow rate required for on-crank and on-line cleaning for each model turbine. Table 2.

Failure to comply with these limits can cause corrosive attack and/or other harmful effects resulting in rapid engine deterioration. When the cleaning product consists of a mixture of cleaning solution concentrate and water, the limits in Table 5 apply to the resulting cleaning product. Solar offers various cleaning solutions that that when properly mixed as a cleaning product, comply with both on-crank and on-line requirements of Table 5. These are available through the Solar Service Parts support network and part numbers are listed in Table 6. Three different types of cleaning solutions are available, each in either concentrate or ready mixed solutions: 5.2.1 Solar Gas Turbine Cleaner No. 1 – Petroleum solvent based solution is the most effective type for cleaning oil and Carbon based fouling. However, local environmental regulations may require special treatment of the waste from on-crank cleaning. Disposal is not typically a consideration for on-line cleaning because the cleaning product is combusted completely in the turbine. 5.2.2 Solar Gas Turbine Cleaner No. 2 - This biodegradable type of solution is formulated with natural solvents and detergents and is generally less effective than pretroleum based solution. Warming solution to approximately 30°C (86°F) and allowing longer soak time can improve effectiveness.\n\n9. Specification No. ES 9-62 7 Table 5.
