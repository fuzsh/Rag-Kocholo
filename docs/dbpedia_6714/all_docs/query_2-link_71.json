Owing to several advantages including increased efficiency, implementation of strict carbon emission regulations, and cost reduction offered by the usage of these turbines, the gas turbine demand is expected to grow further over the next few years.\n\nWhat is Gas Turbine and How Does it Work?\n\nA gas turbine is a type of internal combustion engine that converts chemical energy of fuels into mechanical energy in the form of rotational power. This mechanical energy can be used for powering various industrial processes. The advantages of a gas turbine include high reliability, low operating costs and high-power density. The gas turbines can also be operated with clean and renewable sources of energy thus reducing carbon emissions. Gas turbines used in cogeneration or Combined Heat and Power (CHP) process increase the efficiency of the plant by utilizing the exhaust gases to generate steam which can again be used for various purposes without consuming additional fuel. These benefits of gas turbines along with stricter carbon emission norms will drive the demand for gas turbines in the coming years.\n\nRead more: The Top 10 Global Wind Turbine Companies\n\nGas Turbine Industry Analysis\n\nThe rising demand for efficient turbines around the world is encouraging gas turbine manufacturers to invest heavily in the development of high-efficiency gas turbines.
