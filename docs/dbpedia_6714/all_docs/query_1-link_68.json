        "text": "So far as is material the Act on the Promotion of Energy Production from Renewable Energy Sources, which was adopted on March 31, 2005 and entered into force on August 1, 2005 (the \"Act on Promotion\"),26 provided that\n\n(1) investors would have a connection to the grid on a preferential basis (Section 4(1));\n\n(2) investors would have a period of 15 years for recovery of their investment through the feed-in tariff (the \"FiT\") (Section 6(1)(b)(1));\n\n(3) the level of revenues per unit of electricity from renewable sources would be maintained, as a minimum, with promotion by FiT, for a period of 15 years from the year of putting the plant into operation, taking into account the price index of industrial products (Section 6(1)(b)(2));\n\n(4) As from 2007, the FiT set by the Energy Regulatory Office (the \"ERO\") for the subsequent calendar year was not to be lower than 95% of the value of the FiT valid in the year during which a decision was made on their new values (Section 6(4)), the effect of which was that the FiT granted to photovoltaic plants put into operation in any given year could not be reduced by more than 5% with respect to the FiT granted to photovoltaic plants put into operation in the previous year (the \"5% Break-Out Rule\").\n\nSection 6 provided under the heading \"Amounts of Prices for Electricity from Renewable Sources and Amounts of Green Bonuses\"\n\n(1) The Office sets, one calendar year in advance, the purchasing prices for electricity from Renewable Sources (the \"Purchasing Prices\"), separately for individual kinds of Renewable Sources, and sets green bonuses, so that\n\n(a) the conditions are created for the achievement of the indicative target so that the share of electricity produced from Renewable Sources accounts for 8% of gross electricity consumption in 2010 and\n\n(b) for facilities commissioned\n\n1. after the effective date of this Act, there is attained, with the Support consisting of the Purchasing Prices, a fifteen year payback period on capital expenditures, provided technical and economic parameters are met, such parameters consisting of, in particular, cost per unit of installed capacity, exploitation efficiency of the primary energy content in the Renewable Source, and the period of use of the facility, such parameters being stipulated in an implementing legal regulation,\n\n2. after the effective date of this Act, the amount of revenues per unit of electricity from Renewable Sources, assuming Support in the form of Purchasing Prices, is maintained as the minimum [amount of revenues], for a period of 15 years from the commissioning year of the facility, taking into account the industrial producer price index; the commissioning of a facility is also deemed to include cases involving the completion of a rebuild of the technological part of existing equipment, a change of fuel, or the completion of modernization that raises the technical and ecological standard of an existing facility,\n\n3. prior to the effective date of this Act, there is maintained for a period of 15 years the minimum amount of Purchasing Prices set for the year 2005 in accordance with the legal regulations to date and taking into account the industrial producer price index.\n\n(2) When setting the amounts of green bonuses, the Office also takes into account a heightened degree of risk associated with off-taking electricity from Renewable Sources in the electricity market.\n\n(3) When setting Purchasing Prices and green bonuses, the Office proceeds on the basis of differing costs for the acquisition, connection and operation of individual types of facilities, including the development thereof [the development of such costs] over time.\n\n(4) Purchasing Prices set by the Office for the following calendar year shall not be less than 95% of the Purchasing Prices in effect in the year for which the setting decision is made. This provision shall be used for the prices set for 2007.\n\nOn July 1, 2009 Mr Firt wrote to the Minister of Industry and Trade and to the Minister of Environment pointing to the \"fairly dramatic\" rise in preliminary connection requests for photovoltaic installations and urging the Government to abolish the 5% Break-Out Rule so that the ERO could reduce the incentives for investments made in 2010.62 The letter said:\n\nI am writing to you with an urgent request concerning Act No. 180/2005 Coll., on promotion of production of power generated from renewable energy sources.\n\nThe Energy Regulatory Office is responsible for promotion of power generated from renewable energy sources under the law. The situation with regard to requests for connecting new sources to the grid (primarily photovoltaic plants) is currently fairly dramatic. The growth in installed capacity for photovoltaic plants between 2007 and 2008 amounted to nearly 1,500% (starting at 3.4 MW and finishing at 54.29 MW). The installed capacity hit 77 MW at the end of June this year. Regional distribution system operators predict that at least another 250 MW will be connected and put into operation by the end of 2009.\n\nAt the same time, photovoltaic plants have seen a sharp decline in specific investment costs by approx. 30%. However, the Energy Regulatory Office cannot respond to this situation with the appropriate decrease in the feed-in tariff for power generated from these sources, which puts investors in this area at an unprecedented advantage over investors and producers of other types of renewable resources.\n\nThis situation also leads to a speculative block of connection capacities at the level of the distribution systems. For this reason it is no longer possible to grant a request for connection for any applicant in a large part of the Czech Republic for the foreseeable future. This applies not only to renewable resources, but also to sources for combined power and heat production.\n\nThe provisions of Section 6(4) need to be amended, because at present they are making it impossible for the Energy Regulatory Office to lower the feed-in tariff on power from renewable resources by more than 5% year-on-year.\n\nI would also like to stress the financial and social aspect of this problem, since the current uncontrollable growth in photovoltaic plants already means that all customers in the Czech Republic, including households, will be making a contribution of more than CZK 3 billion in 2010 just for new photovoltaic plants, while the total fund for promoting all types of renewable resources for 2008 was CZK 2,658 billion. In simplified terms, all customers in the Czech Republic will pay about CZK 50/MWh more for power just due to the growth in photovoltaics.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Energy Regulatory Office proposes that Section 6(4) of Act No. 180/2005 Coll. should be repealed. This will make it possible to adjust the feed-in tariff for photovoltaics to match the actual situation.\n\nIn my opinion the issue described in this letter is extremely serious. I am also sending this letter to the Minister for the Environment as the co-sponsor of Act No. 180/2005 Coll. I will be happy to meet in person to discuss the issue, if needed.\n\nOn August 24, 2009 the Ministry issued a press release stating that \"the grant policy from the part of the state has ceased to fulfil its primary function, because support for solar power stations has shifted from an area of necessary state support for its existence to the position of a branch where profit is guaranteed regardless of the situation on the market,\" that it was \"planning to change the maximum 5% limit by which the ERO can reduce the purchase price of electricity from renewable energy sources annually\" and that it was \"trying to ensure that the new act comes into force on 1 January next year.\"66 The press release read:\n\nMinistry of Industry and Trade equalises support for renewable energy sources\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade is preparing an amendment to Act No 180/2005 Coll., concerning support for electricity generation from renewable energy sources. The Ministry of Industry and Trade is planning to change the maximum 5% limit by which the Energy Regulation Office can reduce the purchase price of electricity from renewable energy sources annually. The system for support of renewable energy sources must guarantee a fair competition environment for all renewable sources, it must respect the realistic technical— economic parameters of the individual types of RES, and it must also ensure a commensurate attractiveness for investors. The Ministry of Industry and Trade is trying to ensure that the new act comes into force on 1 January next year.\n\nThe reason for the amendment of the act is primarily the situation in the area of photovoltaic devices, where the grant policy from the part of the state has ceased to fulfil its primary function, because support for solar power stations has shifted from an area of necessary state support for its existence to the position of a branch where profit is guaranteed regardless of the situation on the market.\n\nBetween the years 2007 and 2008 the installed capacity of solar power stations grew by almost 1500 % from an original 3.4 MW to 54.29 MW. By the end of June this year the installed capacity had risen to 80 MW.\n\nThe ongoing reduction in the prices of photovoltaic panels is leading to the uncontrolled development of solar power stations. Whereas technological advances have reduced the price of photovoltaic panels by more than 40%, by law the Energy Regulation Office can only reduced the purchase price of electricity for new renewable sources by 5% per year. So at present a significant advantage is being provided to newly built photovoltaic power stations compared to other sources of renewable energy.\n\nGiven the current parameters, customers in the Czech Republic, including households, will contribute more than CZK 3 billion in support of electricity generation from new photovoltaic sources alone in 2010. If the law were to remain unchanged, in the years to come the contribution for photovoltaic devices would rise dramatically.\n\nPut simply, if the current state were maintained the price for the delivery of electricity would rise by more than CZK 50/MWh for all customers in the Czech Republic just as a result of increase in photovoltaic devices. In 2011 the price for customers would be even higher.\n\nThe purchase prices for electricity from photovoltaic devices are guaranteed for 15 years, but thanks to new technology in certain cases the return on the investment is a mere 5 years. The level of the purchase price for electricity from a photovoltaic device is almost CZK 13/kWh, whereas the market price for electricity is around CZK 2/kWh.\n\nThe Parties do not agree whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims under the ECT. As summarized above, the Respondent contends that all of the Respondent's amendments to the Incentive Regime - the introduction and extension of the Solar Levy, the repeal of both the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period - qualify as \"Taxation Measures\" under of Article 21 of the ECT and therefore are excluded from the scope of the ECT.212 Article 21(1) of the ECT provides:\n\n(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\nArticle 21(7)(a) of the ECT describes the term \"Taxation Measures\" as including:\n\n(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; and\n\n(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.\n\nParagraph (7) of Article 21 further specifies:\n\n(b) There shall be regarded as taxes on income or on capital all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital or on elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, or substantially similar taxes, taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital appreciation.\n\n(c) A \"Competent Tax Authority\" means the competent authority pursuant to a double taxation agreement in force between the Contracting Parties or, when no such agreement is in force, the minister or ministry responsible for taxes or their authorised representatives.\n\n(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"tax provisions\" and \"taxes\" do not include customs duties.\n\nAs is usual in these cases, the Parties have adduced many published awards (in this case more than 50) on the interpretation or application of the FET (\"fair and equitable treatment\") standard, and the FPS (\"full protection and security\") and non-impairment standards. Most of them are well-known, and, although formulations of the principles differ in detail, it is only necessary to summarize the present state of international law and practice in these general propositions (several of which overlap with each other):\n\n(1) There will be a breach of the FET standard where legal and business stability or the legal framework has been altered in such a way as to frustrate legitimate and reasonable expectations or guarantees of stability.535\n\n(2) A claim based on legitimate expectation must proceed from an identification of the origin of the expectation alleged, so that its scope can be formulated with precision.536\n\n(3) A claimant must establish that (a) clear and explicit (or implicit)537 representations were made by or attributable to the state in order to induce the investment, (b) such representations were reasonably relied upon by the Claimants, and (c) these representations were subsequently repudiated by the state.538\n\n(4) An expectation may arise from what are construed as specific guarantees in legislation.539\n\n(5) A specific representation may make a difference to the assessment of the investor's knowledge and of the reasonableness and legitimacy of its expectation, but is not indispensable to establish a claim based on legitimate expectation which is advanced under the FET standard.540\n\n(6) Provisions of general legislation applicable to a plurality of persons or a category of persons, do not create legitimate expectations that there will be no change in the law; and given the State's regulatory powers, in order to rely on legitimate expectations the investor should inquire in advance regarding the prospects of a change in the regulatory framework in light of the then prevailing or reasonably to be expected changes in the economic and social conditions of the host State.541\n\n(7) An expectation may be engendered by changes to general legislation, but, at least in the absence of a stabilization clause, they are not prevented by the fair and equitable treatment standard if they do not exceed the exercise of the host State's normal regulatory power in the pursuance of a public interest and do not modify the regulatory framework relied upon by the investor at the time of its investment outside the acceptable margin of change.542\n\n(8) The requirements of legitimate expectations and legal stability as manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the State's rights to exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt its legal system to changing circumstances.543\n\n(9) The host State is not required to elevate the interests of the investor above all other considerations, and the application of the FET standard allows for a balancing or weighing exercise by the State and the determination of a breach of the FET standard must be made in the light of the high measure of deference which international law generally extends to the right of national authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.544\n\n(10) Except where specific promises or representations are made by the State to the investor, the latter may not rely on an investment treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes in the host State's legal and economic framework. Such expectation would be neither legitimate nor reasonable.545\n\n(11) Protection from arbitrary or unreasonable behaviour is subsumed under the FET standard.546\n\n(12) It will also fall within the obligation not to impair investments by \"unreasonable... measures\" (Article 10(1), ECT) or \"arbitrary... measures (Article 2(2), Czech Republic/Germany BIT).547\n\n(13) The investor is entitled to expect that the State will not act in a way which is manifestly inconsistent or unreasonable (i.e. unrelated to some rational policy).548\n\nIn Micula v Romania the tribunal said:\n\n525.... [F]or a state's conduct to be reasonable, it is not sufficient that it be related to a rational policy; it is also necessary that, in the implementation of that policy, the state's acts have been appropriately tailored to the pursuit of that rational policy with due regard to the consequences imposed on investors.\n\n…\n\n669. There must be a promise, assurance or representation attributable to a competent organ or representative of the state, which may be explicit or implicit. The crucial point is whether the state, through statements or conduct, has contributed to the creation of a reasonable expectation, in this case, a representation of regulatory stability. It is irrelevant whether the state in fact wished to commit itself; it is sufficient that it acted in a manner that would reasonably be understood to create such an appearance. The element of reasonableness cannot be separated from the promise, assurance or representation, in particular if the promise is not contained in a contract or is otherwise stated explicitly. Whether a state has created a legitimate expectation in an investor is thus a factual assessment which must be undertaken in consideration of all the surrounding circumstances.\n\n…\n\n672. The Claimants must also have relied on that expectation when they made their investments. However, it is not necessary for the entire investment to have been predicated solely on such expectation. Businessmen do not invest on the basis of one single consideration, no matter how important. In the Tribunal's view, that expectation must be a determining factor in an investor's decision to invest, or in the manner or magnitude of its investments.\n\nThe point that investment in 2010 would not be affected was taken up by specialists. In a German language article of December 16, 2009 entitled \"An 'all-clear' for Investors\" by members of the Renewable Energy team at the Czech law firm Ueltzhoffer Balada, it was said:\n\nInvestors in the photovoltaic industry can thus largely be given the \"all-clear\". The proposed new provision changes nothing for facilities that connect to the network before the end of 2010. For those facilities, the prices of 23 November 2009, set by the regulator, will still apply. In subsequent years of operation, the reduction in feed-in tariffs will remain limited to 5 percent as before. There is thus about a year left to complete and connect a project in order to benefit from the already fixed prices.\n\n…\n\nFrom the point of view of both investors and lawyers, the proposed law sends a positive signal in terms of investment and protection of legitimate expectations. The current tariffs, which are still very high, will not bring investors much in the long term if they are highly controversial and so create a permanent risk of a change in the law. With this bill, the government has finally made a clear statement regarding the future development possibilities for photovoltaics in the Czech Republic.608"
