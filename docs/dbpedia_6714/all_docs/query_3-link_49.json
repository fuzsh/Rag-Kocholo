        "text": "Post by AdamARM on\n\nHi,\n\nI am thinking about getting myself a new gun for Christmas. These two 357 guns look interesting to me.\n\nTaurus Model 65\n\nor\n\nS&W 586 classic line\n\nI assume that the S&W is a superior gun in every way, but are there in pros to the Taurus Model 65 that I might not have considered.\n\nThanks,\n\n-Adam\n\nPost by azshaun on\n\nNot quite sure about the ‘in every way’ part... Taurus model 65 is the fixed sight version of their 66 line, which I see as the cheaper comparison to the 586. I have had a Taurus 66 for 8 years, and it has been nothing but good to me. Sweet trigger, which I never appreciated until I picked up a couple of Rugers.\n\nI have no experience with a 586, but for the price point the Taurus 66/65 line are solid revolvers if you can get passed its stigma of NOT being a Smith or Ruger.\n\nFor advice from Taurus owners check out Taurusarmed.net. They are fans of all brands, not just Taurus.\n\nPost by needsmostuff on\n\nI 100% prefer adjustable sights on a hand gun. Plus you did not state what the intended purpose is or length of needed gun. Target shooting, plinking or pocket carry /nightstand use all make a difference.\n\nIn the sour grapes department 3 contacts with Taurus Int. customer service left me with a solid feeling they would NEVER have another dollar from me. Yup, they are that bad.\n\nIf money is an issue I would prefer a used S&W or Ruger to a brand new Taurus.\n\nPost by JM on\n\nThe Taurus mentioned above is my only experience with that company.\n\nFor a mid-sized, K or L-Frame sized .357, I would prefer an older S&W or Ruger Security Six with a 3\" to 5\" barrel.\n\nAdjustable sights are highly desirable. Especially for something as versatile as the .357.\n\nPost by AdamARM on\n\nPlus you did not state what the intended purpose is or length of needed gun. Target shooting, plinking or pocket carry /nightstand use all make a difference.\n\nIn the sour grapes department 3 contacts with Taurus Int. customer service left me with a solid feeling they would NEVER have another dollar from me.\n\nMy intended purpose for the gun is primarily target shooting, but also as a night stand gun (I do not carry). I prefer longer barrels (around 5-6 inch) because I am recoil sensitive. Money is not a factor (well, only because I have saved money and I can afford about $800-850 on the purchase).\n\nAnother thing I want out of the gun is to be able to fire 125 gr 357 factory loads without having to worry about cracking the forcing cone.\n\nPost by petep on\n\nIf I were in your place I would look for a used S&W 686.They are in the price range you are talking about and are so much better than a Taurus.The main difference betwen a Smith and Taurus,assuming both are good guns is inside.If you look at the inside of a S&W you will see a major parts difference from the Taurus.This difference makes the Smith a better long term gun,especially if you shoot it a lot.It would be nice if you could try the revolver out first and then make your decision.You say you are recoil sensitive and I can understand that but a 4 inch 686 with a full underlug barrel is muzzle heavy and will really \"soak up\" a lot of recoil.\n\nPost by saleen322 on\n\nMy experience with Taurus has been okay but I have had better luck with Smith. The two issues I have with Taurus is they are not as careful as they should be in quality control letting guns out of the factory that should not have been and if you ever sell the gun, you get your money back from a Smith as they are worth more if you sell. My view in cost and value, the net cost of a Smith is no more and you will likely get a better piece. Good luck with your purchase.\n\nPost by crazycarl on\n\nIf I found an older (early-mid '90's) Taurus for the right price I'd consider it, as a 2 1/2\" model 66 has been my faithful truck gun for well over 20 years. That said, given OP's stated purpose & budget, I'd vote for a pre-lock, 4\" or 6\" 686."
