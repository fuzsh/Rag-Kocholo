        "text": "Gas Turbine Overhaul and Kian Turbo Tec offers a competitive alternative for gas turbine owners and operators in the overhaul of rotors. Dedicated rotor overhaul engineers offering knowledgeable advice. experience of commercial operation.\n\nCommissioning Gas Turbine Installing a gas turbine in this power plant, in addition to increasing productivity, will bring many financial benefits by reducing environmental pollution and saving maintenance and support costs.\n\nKian Turbo Tec Services for MARS 90 Gas Turbine\n\nKian Turbo Tec offers major overhaul of MARS 90 Gas Turbine with high efficiency and services such as:\n\nPre-Strip down balance and inspection\n\nRotor disassembly\n\nIndividual blade and wheel coating\n\nLatest coating technologies\n\nIndividual wheel balancing\n\nRotor re-blade\n\nRotor reassembly\n\nRotor Balance and run-outs\n\nRotor Storage containers\n\nGas Turbine Efficiency\n\nThe Gas Turbine Efficiency works by igniting the difference between compressed air and fuel and passing the product through a series of rotating disks of the turbine, which causes the rotational power of a shaft or creates a driving reaction force or a combination of these two phenomena.\n\nIran has a high potential for using solar energy in power generation systems due to its abundant sunny areas. Solar gas turbine is one of the power generation systems that has been highly regarded by researchers and scholars in recent years.\n\nIn these systems, the solar thermal energy is used to preheat the air and the fuel entering the combustion chamber of the gas turbine cycle. The results show that the use of these systems can increase efficiency, save energy, reduce pollution from fossil fuels and ultimately reduce the costs associated with energy production."
