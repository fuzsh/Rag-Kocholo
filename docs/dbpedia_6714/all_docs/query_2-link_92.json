Similar to a refrigerator, this type of heat pump uses electricity to take advantage of the difference in temperature between the outdoors and inside the building for cooling and heating. In other words, the heat pump extracts heat from the outdoors into the building during the winter. During cooling mode (summer), the heat pump operates in reverse, pulling heat out of the building.\n\nAmbient ground temperatures: The natural temperature of the Earth in a specific location. The ground temperature is typically constant below a depth of 30 ft (9 m). In Illinois, the temperature at this depth is between 50°F and 55°F (10°C and 14°C). Above this depth, the ground temperature is usually close to the annual average air temperature; the ground is primarily impacted by the average air temperature and secondarily by the thermal energy absorbed from the sun.\n\nAntifreeze: Typically, methanol alcohol or propylene glycol is added to water to make antifreeze solutions, which are circulated in closed-loop systems to lower their freezing temperature. Both antifreeze solutions are nontoxic and environmentally friendly, and their use is approved in the United States by state and county or local health departments. Like the antifreeze in your car, the composition of the antifreeze solution in geothermal energy systems needs to be monitored, tested, and adjusted at regular intervals.\n\nAquifer: A geologic layer containing sufficient permeable material (sand, gravel, or both) to conduct groundwater and to yield significant quantities of water to wells and springs.\n\nAquifer thermal energy storage (ATES): An open-loop geothermal technology for the long-term storage of thermal energy underground by using groundwater (aquifer) as the heat-transfer medium. The storage and recovery of thermal energy seasonally is achieved by extracting and injecting groundwater by using well doublets. Suitable hydrogeological conditions are required for storing heat, including a highly permeable aquifer and low groundwater flow velocities, among others. The storage system takes advantage of the high heat capacity of groundwater and the large volumes available. Typically, ATES systems are used for large-scale heating and cooling applications, such as office buildings, hospitals, airports, or universities, and in district thermal networks.\n\nAquitard: A hydrogeologic unit (or confining unit) composed of geologic materials of low permeability (e.g., clay, silt, unfractured bedrock, etc.) that does not transmit significant quantities of groundwater on a regional scale or over geologic time.\n\nBedrock: A general term for rock, usually solid, that underlies soil, unconsolidated material, and overburden, or that outcrops at ground surface.\n\nBorefield: A collection of boreholes in the ground that contain closed-loop ground heat exchange U-bend piping loops.\n\nBorehole: A hole, typically drilled, bored, cored, driven, hydraulically advanced, or otherwise constructed into the ground to extract water, oil and gas, and geothermal energy.\n\nBorehole heat exchanger (BHE): A ground heat exchanger installed in a borehole.\n\nBorehole thermal energy storage (BTES): A geothermal technology used to store heat seasonally underground for later use. It is the most common method for seasonal thermal energy storage around the world and uses heat-transfer fluid in a borehole heat exchanger (BHE) to move the heat into the ground.

LEED Certification can be applied to new or existing buildings and homes looking to become sustainable.\n\nLevelized cost of energy (LCOE): Also referred to as the levelized cost of electricity, it is a measurement used to assess and compare alternative methods of energy production. For an energy-generating facility, it is thought of as the average total cost of building and operating the asset per unit of total electricity generated over an assumed lifetime.

In some states, rights to the surface and subsurface may be held by different entities. According to the British Geological Survey, one key challenge with ownership and regulation of geothermal energy resources is that in some jurisdictions, it is regarded as a physical property, not a recoverable (raw) material, such as minerals or aggregates. As such, “heat” is not a legally defined entity, which causes some difficulties when assigning legal ownership and regulating it.\n\nPermeability: A measure of the relative ease with which a fluid moves through the pore spaces of a bedrock or unconsolidated sediment.\n\nPhotovoltaic (PV): Materials and devices that convert sunlight into electrical energy.\n\nPhotovoltaic–thermal (PVT): Materials and devices that convert sunlight into both electricity and hot water.\n\nPower purchasing agreement (PPA): An arrangement in which a third-party developer installs, owns, and operates an energy system on a customer’s property.
