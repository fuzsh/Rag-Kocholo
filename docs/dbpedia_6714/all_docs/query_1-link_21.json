        "text": "IMMI Turbines is a specialist in the acquisition, refurbishment, and overhaul of turbines for power applications. Services include maintenance, major inspections and gas turbine repairs worldwide.\n\nIn addition, IMMI Turbines has a large inventory of surplus, new and used solar and gas turbine parts available. Some of our typical stock include exchange fuel controls, both liquid and gas, including black boxes, switches, servo actuators, thermocouples, speed boxes, speed and temperature sensors, exhaust gas temperature (EGT) harnesses, blades, discs, tip shoes, fuel valves, fuel nozzles, compressor blades and vanes, hot section components and rotating and stationary seals.\n\nSee our solar gas turbine parts inventory list for a complete breakdown of the thousands of parts available.\n\nGas turbine spare parts supply and inventory\n\nIMMI Turbines has an in-house inventory of OEM spare parts for solar gas turbines, including Solar Saturn, T3000, Solar Centaur, T4000, T4500, T4700, Single and Split Shaft, and Solar Taurus, T60, T70.\n\nIMMI Turbines supplies original OEM, refurbished, used, surplus new and refurbished, and reversed engineered parts for components that are no longer easily found or available.\n\nWe supply large gas turbine assemblies such as rotors, skids, auxiliaries and complete gas turbine parts locator services. We offer gas turbine control systems, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), control system software and control system and PLC repair.\n\nWe have a comprehensive computerised spare parts database for most solar gas turbine components, which includes manufacturers, model numbers, part numbers, descriptions, drawing numbers, quantities, conditions and material designations. We also manufacture and install re-engineered spare parts.\n\nHot gas path and combustion components\n\nFor the solar gas turbine models Saturn, T3000, T4000, Centaur, T4500 and T4700 Taurus, Ruston Gas Turbines TA1500, TA1750, TB4000 and TB5000, we have hot gas path and combustion components: complete gas turbine rotors, first, second and third stage buckets, blades and stage nozzles, as well as combustion liners, transition pieces, cross-fire tubes and shroud blocks.\n\nRoutine maintenance and inspection for gas turbines\n\nIMMI Turbines performs routine maintenance and major inspections on solar and Ruston gas turbines. The company also carries out overhauls and repairs worldwide on Solar Saturn, Solar Centaur, Solar Taurus and Ruston gas turbines.\n\nIn addition, the company performs overhaul and performance testing, component repair and field services. It supplies and installs new and refurbished solar gas turbine parts, control system repairs and upgrades, as well as fuel system repairs. Customised long-term maintenance agreements are also available.\n\nThe company provides the purchase, sale, design and installation of power generation packages and offers solar gas turbine exchange engines.\n\nGas turbine control system retrofits\n\nIMMI Turbines can remove old relay logic control systems and replace them with state-of-the-art PLC-based control systems. IMMI Turbines can use Allen Bradley, GE, Siemens, or any other PLC you have.\n\nThe company carries out gas turbine control system upgrades and replacements, distributed control system (DCS) and PLC controls service, support and troubleshooting.\n\nIMMI Turbines also provides callout services on control systems, installation and site supervision.\n\nOther services provided in this area include:\n\nTurnkey site services\n\nLong-term service agreements\n\nControl systems online monitoring and remote data services support\n\nHuman machine interface (HMI) upgrades, sales and services\n\nGas turbine overhaul support\n\nIMMI Turbines has gas turbine overhaul engineers who are experienced at working with gas producers, power turbines, accessory drives, compressors, C16, C30, C28, gear reduction units, Solar Saturn, Solar Centaur, Solar Taurus, Ruston and more.\n\nComponents are inspected thoroughly to determine if a non-destructive testing (NDT) is required. Quality control personnel keep a close eye on the material as it passes through the overhaul process. Once this is complete, it is then moved to our state-of-the-art gas turbine test facility for a full factory test.\n\nDuring the factory testing process, vibration, fuel flow, exhaust gas temperature, air inlet temperature and lube oil temperature are measured in our Gas Turbine Test Cell. This facility meets or exceeds OEM requirements, guaranteeing the highest levels of quality and service, staffed by approved factory-trained technicians.\n\nRefurbishments packages for gas turbines\n\nIMMI Turbines offers a competitive alternative to purchasing a new gas turbine package, reducing lead-time and costs for customers.\n\nWe provide:\n\nFull major overhaul\n\nRotor refurbishment\n\nNew, refurbished and engineered gas turbine parts\n\nGas turbine gear box inspection and overhaul\n\nGas turbine generator inspection, maintenance and overhaul\n\nComplete gas turbine package re-wire\n\nControl panel upgrades and replacements\n\nInlet and exhaust plenum design repair or replacement\n\nIMMI Turbines has extensive experience in full refurbishment of either our own surplus equipment or customer provided packages. All equipment is assigned to the appropriate department for 100% zero-time and gas turbine overhaul testing. The generator or compressor and all system components are overhauled, repaired or replaced to that of a new equivalent gas turbine package. The control system or PLC is either updated or provided."
