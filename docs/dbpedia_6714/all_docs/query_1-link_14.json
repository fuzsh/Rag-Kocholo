        "text": "Liquefied natural gas, often abbreviated to LNG, is a hotly debated topic that attracts both supporters and critics. However, reliable industrial valves are essential for LNG plants. These valves ensure the safe transport, storage and processing of the liquefied gas within the facilities. üõ≥Ô∏è Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dnVZ6t6S #ValvesIndustry #VWE #LNG\n\nOur most recent look at global LNG takes a look at the crucial roles of China and Russia in driving demand. Our report indicates that natural gas fundamentals in these two areas alone will play a significant role in shaping the future of liquid natural gas (LNG) over the next eight years, and LNG will contribute to approximately 65% of global gas demand growth by 2030. Notably, the report's base case suggests no significant global LNG overbuild until 2030, with around 16 Bcf/d of additional LNG projects expected to come online in North America by that time. https://lnkd.in/e5-zExyN\n\nFreeport LNG is almost wrapped up with an expansion project that would further increase its 15.3 mtpa capacity. As the #UnitedStates continues to maintain its prominence in the global #LNG market, the domestic market will need to increase the supply of gas available for both domestic consumers and for export facilities. How can one quickly gain insight into all facets of the U.S. domestic #naturalgas market?
