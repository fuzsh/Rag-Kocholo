        "text": "Taurus Electro G2.5 can use a shorter runway, climbs faster and it performs much better than the gasoline-powered version when it comes to high altitude operations. All this is possible thanks to the specially-developed emission-free Pipistrel’s 40 kW electric power-train.\n\nThe tailor-developed heated and ventilated Lithium-technology batteries come in two configurations, capable of launching the airplane 2500 m (8500 ft). They are placed in self-contained boxes, monitored constantly by the Pipistrel’s own battery management system (BMS), complete with data-logging and battery health forecasting.\n\nThe propulsion motor weighs an impressive 11 kg and generates 40 kW power.\n\nWith the Taurus Electro G2.5 we are introducing a World’s first – a full set of on-board networked avionics providing for a fly-by-wire powertrain management with built-in multi-layer protection logic.\n\nThe first element of this networked system is the state-of-the-art hybrid battery management system which was developed entirely in house to be able to function with tighter tolerances than commercially available systems, yielding better performance and longer battery life. The Battery Management system monitors the specially developed batteries. They represent the absolute pinnacle of today’s battery technology, combining low weight, high power and high energy density. The batteries are placed in boxes with dedicated power and signal connectors. Each battery cell’s performance is monitored, temperature controlled with heating and ventilating, and future performance predicted.\n\nThe system is able to forecast when a battery cell is mal-performing and signals the need for a premature replacement. All parameters are also logged in the on-board flight data recorder. The two (2) battery boxes are removable and replaceable.\n\nThe second element is the power inverter/motor controller. It features self-protection logic against current spikes, over temperatures and other potential abnormal situations. In other words, the controller is not only driving the motor, but also providing for the low-level protection of both itself, the batteries and the motor.\n\nThe most noticeable addition to the networked system is the color-display cockpit interface instrument. The screen is really bright, in fact brighter than most displays out there, and is readable in the strongest of sunshine! It indicates the drive mode and important parameters to the pilot and provides the interface for engine retraction and extension. Everything is operated via two (2) toggle switches and a rotatable knob. The first toggle switch is the power on/off switch and does exactly that – powers up the motor controller.\n\nThe second toggle switch is the motor position selector »up/down« i.e. extended or retracted. This process is fully automated – the propeller is positioned and held in place while the motor extends or retracts. The pilot only selects the desired mode with the toggle switch. The rotary encoder acts as the throttle selector.\n\nDue to the nature of electric propulsion system, we decided to employ the computational power of this cockpit interface instrument and gave it the role of the master on board computer. This means it not only displays data to the pilot, but also »talks« to every other powertrain component on board via CAN bus and makes everything sing together. It is able to detect overheating of individual components and reduce power gradually in order to maximize the climb potential with the given system status. Not only that, it provides systems diagnostics and all necessary warnings to the pilot. The display’s USB port is also used for software-updates of the Taurus Electro G2.5 systems.\n\nPipistrel is presenting another World’s first – the concept of Flying For Free. the Solar Trailer(R), which can charge-up the Taurus Electro G2.5 absolutely free and with zero emissions! Charging with the help of the Solar Trailer offers 1.5 kW of usable power to charge the Taurus Electro in the middle of nowhere without the need to connect it to the grid.\n\nFurthermore, when the Taurus Electro is stored in the trailer during a week of bad weather, it will still be charged and ready to fly by the weekend. The Solar Trailer and Taurus Electro are perfect companions and demonstrate how it is possible to fly free of charge, quietly and with absolutely zero emissions, with today’s technology!\n\nThe trailer offers Multiple 12VDC and 240 VAC (24VDC and 110VAC available on request) electrical outlets, and 3.6 kWh Integrated storage battery. Also present is the solar-system by-pass, so you can charge the aircraft inside the trailer when parked in the hangar/garage, for example. The Integrated storage battery energy of the trailer can be transmitted directly into the Taurus Electro. The Solar Trailer gathers energy also when you are flying, so you charge the Taurus Electro G2 also during the night with the energy that has accumulated during the day!"
