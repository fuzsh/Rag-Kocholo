        "text": "Solar Turbine has been an active agent in the field of industrial power generation for about 65 years. Solar Turbines have manufactured and designed sustainable and innovative products for oil and natural gas production.\n\nSOLAR Taurus Gas Turbine\n\nKian Turbo Tec. is trying to meet as many industrial needs as possible with the aim of supplying and equipping all kinds of sensitive Mechanical and Electronic Components of Gas Turbines. Due to self-sufficiency, supplying all kinds of sensitive parts of SOLAR Taurus Turbine such as stator and rotating Blades in the hot section is another significant activity of this company.\n\nSolar Turbine Services\n\nSolar Turbine services are comprised of Solar Turbine parts. gas turbine overhaul, gas turbine field service, flexible service agreements, digital solutions, and technical training in addition to remote web based monitoring and predictive diagnostic capabilities .\n\nMany existing Gas Turbine Overhaul use an electric motor to start the turbine. This electric motor is powered by mains or adjacent units and gradually increases the speed of the gas turbine.\n\nSolar Taurus are comprised of Solar Turbine parts, gas turbine overhaul , field service, flexible service agreements, digital solutions. and technical training in addition to remote web based monitoring and predictive diagnostic capabilities.\n\nWhere are solar turbines usually located?\n\nSolar turbines are usually located in sunny, dry areas with abundant land available. Some of the places where solar turbines are commonly located include:\n\nSouthern California\n\nArizona\n\nNevada\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTexas\n\nChile\n\nMorocco\n\nAlgeria\n\nEgypt\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nThese areas receive a lot of sunlight throughout the year, which is essential for solar power generation. They also have large, open spaces that are suitable for solar farms.\n\nSolar turbines can also be located in other areas, but they may be less efficient in places with less sunlight or less available land."
