        "text": "Murata ceramic capacitors have earned a good reputation and are now adopted in fields requiring a high level of reliability, artificial satellites and submarine optical cable relay stations among them, in recognition of Murata's design technologies, mass production technologies and evaluation/analysis technologies, which it has developed over many years Murata is the only domestic multilayer ceramic capacitors company approved by JAXA and have been widely adopted in the well-known asteroid probe, Hayabusa, the weather and communication satellite, Himawari, the robotic cargo spaceship (HTV) Konotori, which supplies the International Space Station, and in other areas of international communications.\n\n*Asteroid Probe \"Hayabusa\n\nThe Hayabusa was launched on May 9, 2003 to bring surface material from the asteroid \"Itokawa\" back to earth, and returned on June 13, 2010. This probe was launched with a plan to establish sample return technology for the first time in history.\n\nMurata does business with manufacturers across the globe, and Murata parts are utilized in all kinds of electronics worldwideâ€”from the home appliances we use in our everyday lives, to equipment that demands absolute reliability such as automobiles, aerospace instruments, and implanted medical devices like pacemakers. The total number of multilayer ceramic capacitors Murata has sold overall is close to nine trillion and still increasing! If nine trillion 0603 Size (1.6 x 0.8mm) capacitors were lined up one next to the other, they would stretch from the Earth to the Moon and back almost 18 times! The applications where Murata capacitors play a vital role will only continue to grow."
