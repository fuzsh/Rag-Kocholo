        "text": "Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (Murata), a semiconductor company supplying to companies such as Apple, HP, and Intel, ranks 26th out of 40 companies. It discloses less information on its forced labor policies and practices than its peers across all themes. However, since 2016, it has moved from the bottom quartile to the third quartile. While in 2016 the company disclosed it did not engage with stakeholders on forced labor, it now discloses that it participates in the Responsible Minerals Initiative and the Japan Electronics and Industries Association, and states that both initiatives address forced labor. Further, the company improved by disclosing it has established a human rights and labor committee that delivers forced labor training to production workers at least once a year. The company has an opportunity to improve its performance and disclosure on the themes of traceability and risk assessment, worker voice, and monitoring."
