        "text": "You can search for a variety of products for system development, from high-performance, highly reliable devices to modules using different methods and principles.\n\nWe have selected tried-and-true and recommended items from the diverse lineup of Murata sensors that read the status and acquire surrounding information from a variety of things, including consumer equipment, automobiles, and industrial devices.\n\nThis is an electronic component whose resistance value changes in accordance with changes in temperature, and can be used in a variety of applications such as temperature sensors, circuit protection, and temperature compensation by applying the functions of heating elements and thermo-sensitive devices.\n\nWe offer a versatile lineup of products according to shape and application that are equipped with elements featuring high-precision and superior thermal responsiveness.\n\nBy emitting ultrasonic waves into the air and then detecting the waves reflected off objects, this product is used for object detection such as in intruder alarms and automatic doors, and in range meters such as automotive parking assistance systems.\n\nWe have a lineup of high-performance sensors thanks to our unique piezo-ceramic technology cultivated over many years.\n\nThis is a sensor that uses the pyroelectric effect of our pyroelectric ceramics based on the principle of infrared detection, and is the optimal product for detecting people movement.\n\nThis product is designed with unique high quality thanks to our ceramic technology cultivated over many years.\n\nThis is a vibration sensor device that can be utilized in the predictive maintenance of production equipment through the monitoring of vibrations.\n\nIt is ideal to be equipped into machine element components because it has a small SMD shape.\n\nIt detects high-frequency vibrations up to 11 kHz to contribute to the predictive maintenance of bearings and other components.\n\nThis inertial sensor is designed for measuring acceleration and inclination, and is suited to safety-critical applications on automobiles and industrial applications. We offer a high-performance, highly reliable digital lineup.\n\nThis sensor is equipped with an acceleration sensor and gyro sensor for detecting object acceleration and angular velocity. It is suitable for safety-critical applications on automobiles and industrial applications.\n\nHere you will find information on non-contact solutions that monitor people lying in beds at hospitals and other facilities using the BCG (Ballistocardiographic) principle.\n\nThe sensor extracts biosignals such as pulse, respiratory rate, and breathing time and aggregates the data on the customer's system to detect when the patient gets out of bed, and analyzes their sleep state.\n\nThis sensor measures CO2 concentration, and was developed for smart farming and building air conditioning control applications.\n\nIt offers long-term stability and high precision measurements thanks to our unique mechanism design and auto calibration utilizing two wavelength NDIR, as well as maintenance free operation.\n\nThis is a magnetic switch that uses AMR elements whose resistance value changes according to magnetic field strength and orientation, and when combined with magnets, allows for non-contact rotation detection and position detection.\n\nMagnetic switches are being used for cylinder-position detection applications, rotation detection applications such as in gas and water meters, and opening/closing detection applications such as in single-lens reflex cameras, video cameras, and refrigerators.\n\nThe lineup consists of barometric pressure sensors that can detect atmospheric pressure and pressure sensor elements.\n\nThe barometric pressure sensor can be used in indoor navigation, activity tracking, and weather monitoring. Pressure sensor elements are capable of measuring absolute pressure and can be used in special applications such as medical instruments.\n\nOur sensor elements are designed using capacitance technology for superior stability even at low current consumption, low noise, and temperature changes.\n\nMurataâ€™s soil sensor has been developed to continuously monitor and visualize the condition of the soil and water quality in agriculture. Three sensors are built into a single package, which enables simultaneous measurement of electrical conductivity (EC), moisture (volumetric water content: VWC), and temperature in the soil or water.\n\nIn particular, the industryâ€™s first-ever nine-electrode EC sensor has multiple measuring patterns and original algorithms that help eliminate uncertainty.\n\nThis flexible and thin sensor is capable of highly sensitive pressing force detection. It can be mounted in smaller spaces, is thinner than conventional sensors, and can be used to improve the assembly and durability of products.\n\nThanks to our unique piezo-ceramic technology cultivated over many years, this high-performance, unique acceleration sensor detects vibrations and jolts.\n\nCurrently only HDD jolt detection and vehicle-mounted TPMS Wake Up are supported.\n\nMurata manufactures a wide variety of high-quality, high-precision sensors thanks to knowledge accumulated over many years, starting with our advanced circuit technologies This includes unique Murata technology such as 3D-MEMS technology for MEMS sensors covering acceleration, gyro, and tilt sensors, as well as piezo-ceramic technology such as shock sensors, and pyroelectric infrared sensors.\n\nSensing covering a wide range of information is possible, including vibration, acceleration, tilt, ultrasonic waves, magnetism, impacts, infrared light, temperature, CO2, barometric pressure, and soil.\n\nWe offer a versatile lineup of high-precision sensors that cater to all situations and needs, from detecting the movement of people via machines and surrounding information, to weather and environmental information."
