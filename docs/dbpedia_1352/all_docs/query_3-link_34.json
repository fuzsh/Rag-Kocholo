        "text": "Nationals of many countries are allowed visa-free entry into Chile for up to 90 days for tourism purposes. Those who don’t fall into this category will need to apply for a visa in advance of entering Chile.\n\nExpats moving to Chile for work will need a work permit known as a Visa Subject to Contract. This is usually taken care of by one’s employer and is valid for up to two years.[1]\n\n[1] http://www.expatarrivals.com/chile/visas-for-chile\n\nExpats on the hunt for accommodation in Chile will find a wide range of options. Apartments are mainly available in the city centers, while freestanding houses can be found in more suburban areas. Most expats prefer to rent rather than buy, at least initially.[2]\n\nIn Chile, making use of personal connections is often the best way to get something done, and finding somewhere to live is no exception. It’s not unusual for landlords to connect with potential tenants through word of mouth before advertising a property publicly, so it helps to spread the word among as many locals as possible. Other sources include the internet, local newspapers and real estate agents.[3]\n\nThe standard lease length is 12 months, and a deposit equivalent to at least one month’s rent is paid upfront. In some cases, expats will need a local to act as a guarantor for them before the lease can be signed – this role is often fulfilled by the expat’s employer. If a guarantor can’t be found, expats may be able to negotiate paying a larger deposit instead. Utilities are usually paid for by the tenant in addition to the cost of rent.[4]\n\n[2] https://www.expatarrivals.com/chile/accommodation-in-chile\n\n[3] https://www.consultchile.com/single-post/2016/08/18/Looking-for-Property-in-Chile\n\n[4] https://www.bretagne.cl/finding-apartment-santiago/\n\nFamilies moving to Chile have a variety of options when it comes to education. There are public schools, which are entirely funded by the government, and private schools, which may be partially subsidized by the government or completely self-funded.[5] Most expat parents prefer to send their children to private schools, as public schools teach entirely in Spanish and have been known to offer below-par education.\n\nPrivate schools may be run by a variety of entities, such as religious or non-profit organizations, private corporations, or, in the case of international schools, foreign governments or entities authorized to teach foreign curricula, such as that of the UK, the US or the International Baccalaureate. Teaching is usually either bilingual, in English or in the language of the curriculum’s country of origin.[6]\n\nThough international school fees can be pricey, the standard of education and facilities is generally good. As a result, many international schools have a high demand so it’s advised that expats apply as early as possible, in case they’re put on a waiting list.\n\n[5] https://teachingchile.com/about_chile_overview.htm\n\n[6] http://www.expatarrivals.com/chile/education-and-schools-in-chile\n\nSpanish is Chile’s official language, spoken by 99.5% of the population.[8] However, even expats familiar with Spanish may struggle to understand locals. Chilean Spanish can differ quite radically from Spanish spoken elsewhere, and has a distinctive accent. “S” sounds are often dropped, as are last syllables of words, while some consonants are pronounced very softly. Chilean locals also tend to speak at a rapid pace.\n\nThose learning Spanish for the first time would do well to take a course specifically teaching Chilean Spanish, and those who already have a good grasp of Spanish may benefit from a refresher course focusing on Chilean Spanish.[9]\n\nThough English isn’t native to Chile, expats will find that it is spoken to some extent in Santiago, mostly as a natural extension of its status as an international business and tourism hub. However, English proficiency can be very limited in rural areas, so those venturing outside of Chile’s larger cities should bear this in mind.\n\nSpanish is Chile’s official language, spoken by 99.5% of the population.[10] However, even expats familiar with Spanish may struggle to understand locals.

Breakfast is a light and simple meal of bread and tea or coffee, while lunch is the main meal of the day and is often served in two or more courses over one or two hours. Extended afternoon meals are often used as an opportunity to do business over lunch before returning to the workplace. In the early evening, Chileans break for once, a light meal akin to British teatime. Dinner is substantial but not as heavy as lunch, and is eaten in the late evening.[12]\n\nThanks to Chile’s lengthy coastline, seafood is a staple of the country’s diet and is eaten grilled, steamed, or fried. Highlights include ostiones a la parmesana (grilled scallops with parmesan cheese), congrio frito (deep-fried eel) and Chilean ceviche (raw fish in lime juice).\n\nCorn is one of the country’s indigenous crops and is the core ingredient of many traditional dishes, such as pastel de choclo, a meaty pie with a ground corn crust.[13]\n\nAs in many South American countries, empanadas are a popular snack. The most traditional of these pastries comes packed with a filling of pino – a combination of meat, onions, raisins, olives, and hard-boiled egg. Other popular fillings include cheese and seafood.[14]\n\nFor expats craving a taste of home, it should also be easy to find familiar favorites, whether in restaurants, fast food joints or grocery stores.\n\n[12] http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Chile.html\n\n[13] https://traveltips.usatoday.com/everyday-food-chile-11786.html\n\n[14] https://www.chileculture.org/food-in-chile/\n\nIncome is taxed progressively according to earnings and ranges from 0 to 40%. If an expat is living in Chile for six months or more during a twelve-month period, they are considered a tax resident and will be taxed on their worldwide income as well as income from within the country. Non-residents only pay tax on locally earned income.[26]\n\nChile is a popular retirement destination, offering the attractive combination of a relatively low cost of living and a high quality of life.[27] Expats planning on retiring in Chile will need to apply for a temporary residence permit, in the Retirement and Periodical Income category. Proof of a recurring source of income is required.[28]\n\n[26] https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights/2015/11/chile-income-tax.html\n\n[27] https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/on-retirement/2015/01/08/8-reasons-to-retire-in-chile\n\n[28] https://www.visahunter.com/visa/chile/how-to-get-a-temporary-resident-visa-for-chile/\n\nIn Chile, the business atmosphere tends towards formal. A great deal of importance is placed on appearances, so particular care should be taken to dress neatly and conservatively. Dark suits are appropriate, with the color navy being particularly popular.[29]\n\nThough meeting times are set in advance, expats may find that their Chilean counterparts arrive late. However, it would be rude to express disapproval or irritation at the lateness of locals, so it’s best to arrive on time and wait patiently.[30]\n\nRelationships are an important part of successfully doing business in Chile. Family and friends in particular tend to get preferential treatment. Business lunches are fairly commonplace and may last more than an hour. In general, the pace of business dealings is slow in Chile, but expats should never try to rush proceedings as this puts the relationship at risk. Showing aggression or going for the “hard sell” are also ill-advised courses of action.\n\nThere’s a definite hierarchy in Chilean businesses, with respect and status being of the utmost importance. Employees at various levels throughout the company may contribute to the decision-making process but ultimately those at the top make all final decisions.\n\n[29] https://www.southamerica.cl/Chile/Business.htm\n\n[30] https://www.communicaid.com/country/chile/\n\nDespite Chile’s sprawling length, it’s surprisingly easy, cheap and efficient to get around. The country has a comprehensive public transport system and roads are generally well maintained.[31] The close proximity of other countries such as Peru and Argentina also offers opportunities for easy travel to other regions of South America.\n\nBuses are the most popular form of public transport among locals and are a cost-effective way to travel within Chile’s main cities. Rail transport isn’t widely used in Chile as a whole, but the cities of Santiago, Valparaíso and Concepción have clean, cheap and efficient metro systems available.\n\nThough convenient, taxis can be expensive and are notorious for overcharging foreigners. An alternative is colectivos – these are shared taxis that run along a fixed route. They’re cheaper than regular taxis and only slightly more expensive than buses.[32]\n\nExpats can drive in Chile with an international driver’s permit until permanent or temporary residency status is granted, at which point they’ll need to obtain a local license.\n\nIf travelling to a neighboring country or going a long distance to the north or south within Chile, taking a plane is usually the best option. [33]\n\n[31] https://www.aboutchile.com/info-about-chile/transportation-services-in-chile/\n\n[32] https://www.contactchile.cl/en/discover/santiago/transport.html\n\n[33] https://www.expatarrivals.com/chile/transport-and-driving-in-chile\n\nThe cost of living in Chile is among the highest in South America, outdone only by the other continental economic powerhouses Brazil and Argentina.[36] That said, it’s still much cheaper to live in Chile than in many European or North American countries, and it offers a similar quality of life.\n\nAccommodation isn’t particularly expensive and with a bit of shopping around, expats can find some great deals, particularly outside of city centers. Generally, food and groceries are reasonably priced and eating out is an affordable luxury. However, those sending their children to an international school can expect fees to be a fairly hefty expense.[37]\n\n[36] https://mobilityexchange.mercer.com/Portals/0/Content/Rankings/rankings/col2017a986532/index.html\n\n[37] https://www.expatarrivals.com/chile/cost-of-living-in-chile"
