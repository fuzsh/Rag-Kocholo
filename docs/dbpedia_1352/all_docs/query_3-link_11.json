        "text": "Bordering Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, and the Pacific Ocean, Chile is an underestimated but fascinating destination for expats and digital nomads, who are increasingly attracted by the country's cost of living, the peaceful and relaxed lifestyle it offers, and the stunning landscapes it offers, running all along the Andes mountains.\n\nChile has also simplified the process of obtaining permanent residency for foreigners. It offers various visa programs designed to suit different individual needs and preferences.\n\nWhile moving to Chile is often a rewarding experience, it does require careful planning and preparation. There can be obstacles to navigate and potential issues to avoid. Thorough preparation is crucial. Our guide provides you with the necessary steps for a successful start in Chile.\n\nStep 1: Prepare your documents\n\nBefore moving to Chile, you must determine your eligibility to stay in the country and apply for an appropriate visa. Hereâs what you need to consider.\n\nRegardless of nationality, all individuals planning to work in Chile must obtain a Chile work visa. While some foreign nationals are exempt from obtaining a tourist visa for short-term purposes (up to 90 days), anyone intending to stay for work or any purpose exceeding 90 days must apply for a visa before arriving in Chile.\n\nVisa types\n\nThe Chilean government offers a variety of visas to allow foreigners to enter the country:\n\nâ Â Passport (plus copies):Â Your passport should have a minimum of six months of validity beyond your intended stay and at least two empty pages\n\nâ Â Passport-sized photos:Â The standard dimensions are 35mm by 45mm, and the photo must be no less than six months old\n\nâ Â Visa application form:Â You can download, fill, and sign the application form based on your specific visa type's requirements\n\nâ Â Proof of outbound travel:Â This can be a copy of your boarding pass from your airline or other means of transport\n\nâ Â Health insurance:Â Proof that you have health coverage for your stay\n\nâ Â Accommodation details:Â Information on where you'll be staying during your visa's duration\n\nâ Â Proof of employment:Â If you're applying for a work visa, you will need your job offer letter or signed employment contract\n\nâ Â Criminal record check:Â Could be required depending on the type of visa\n\nâ Â Educational certificatesÂ (where applicable)\n\nâ Â Financial records:Â This is to show that you can support yourself financially during your stay in Chile and not depend on public funds\n\nâ Â Marriage and birth certificates:Â required if you are relocating with your family for dependent visa applications\n\nStep 2: Manage your finances\n\nChile is known among expats for its relatively affordable cost of living. If youÂ budget well, you could save money while enjoying a good quality of life. Letâs look at what you need to consider:\n\nCost of living in Chile\n\nHereâs a list of the costs you can expect when living in Chile:\n\nRenting:Â A one-bedroom apartment costs around 500,000 CLP ($650) in big cities like Santiago and drops to 350,000 CLP ($450) in smaller cities and towns\n\nBuying property:Â Real estate is generally cheaper compared to other countries in South America but has high initial setup costs\n\nFood and drink:Â Groceries are generally affordable, and thereâs a wide range of local products for those on a tight budget. Local restaurants are also inexpensive, costing as little as 8,000 CLP ($10) for a meal for two\n\nTransport:Â Gas costs and tolls are comparable to most South American countries. To save even more, you can use public transport for around 800 CLP ($1) one-way\n\nUtilities:Â Chile has stable electricity rates, although prices may vary depending on your location\n\nTaxation\n\nWhen budgeting for your life in Chile, consider how much tax youâll have to pay.Â Chile has a progressive taxation system, meaning your tax rate will depend on your income bracket. Taxes are subject to change but generally range between 0% and 40%.\n\nExpats may qualify for Chile's Non-Permanente residency (NPR) program. If you haven't been a resident in the country for the past five years, you can pay a flat rate of 20% on foreign income for up to five years.\n\nAside from income tax, you must also pay property tax, known asÂ Impuesto Territorial. This tax is usually a small percentage of the property value.\n\nItâs also important to check ifÂ Chile has a tax treaty with your home countryÂ to avoid double taxation and stay updated on any changes in tax regulations.\n\nBanking and currency exchange\n\nThere are several local and international banks in Chile where you can open a bank account. You will need to visit a branch and bring proof of identity, address, and employment.\n\nYou must also obtain a tax identification number called aÂ RUT (Rol Ãnico Tributario). Visit the nearest tax office to register for this number before opening a bank account.\n\nChile uses the Chilean peso (CLP) as its official currency. You can easily exchange your local currency, from the American Dollar (USD) to the European Euro, at currency exchange offices or banks in major cities.\n\nStep 3: Arrange housing and accommodation\n\nFinding suitable accommodation is not only a visa requirement but also essential for setting up quickly in Chile. Here, weâll look at Chile's housing options and the steps you need to take to secure your new home.\n\nRenting vs. buying\n\nProperty prices in Chile are relatively affordable, so you may consider buying property. Ensure you have sufficient funds to cover the upfront costs, including a deposit, transfer tax, and insurance fees.\n\nProperties in Chile may require renovation, so budgeting for repairs is important.\n\nIf you're only staying for a few years or are still determining where you want to live in Chile, renting may be a more suitable option. If you're planning to move to popular cities like Santiago or Valparaiso, booking your accommodation well in advance is recommended, especially during peak seasons.\n\nFinding suitable housing\n\nChile offers a range of housing options, from modern apartment buildings to older, traditional homes. Older homes may have plumbing and electricity issues due to outdated systems.\n\nSearch local websites likeÂ Portalinmobiliario,Â ChilePropiedades, orÂ ToctocÂ to browse available properties. You can search by accommodation type, budget, and location.\n\nItâs easy to find accommodations tailored to expats andÂ digital nomadsÂ in Chile, with amenities like strong internet connections and modern furnishing. Landlords often cater to this demographic, making negotiation and finding your perfect place easier.\n\nOnce you've chosen a property, thoroughly read the lease agreement. The contract should include:\n\nA description of the accommodation\n\nThe amount of rent you'll pay\n\nAny required security deposits (typically equivalent to two months' rent)\n\nThe length of the lease (usually a year)\n\nYour responsibilities regarding the property\n\nPet policies\n\nStep 4: Job market and working arrangements\n\nChile offers a vibrant job market characterized by sectors such as mining, which is a major driver of the economy, and agriculture, with its world-renowned wine and fruit exports, renewable energy, and a budding tech industry in Santiago, often referred to as \"Chilecon Valley.\"Â\n\nThe monthly income can vary greatly depending on the industry and job role, with a noticeable trend towards remote work and freelancing, making it an attractive option for digital nomads. For employment opportunities, job seekers can utilize popular platforms like LinkedIn,Â Laborum.cl, andÂ Computrabajo.cl.Â\n\nThe Chilean work culture emphasizes punctuality, respect in professional interactions, and the importance of personal connections, known as \"pituto,\" in securing positions.\n\nStep 5: Accessing healthcare and education\n\nHealthcare system\n\nChile boasts a high-standard healthcare system, allowing expatriates to choose between the public healthcare system, known asÂ FONASA, and private health insurance, or ISAPREs, which offer more comprehensive coverage and faster access to specialists. Registration with either system is necessary to access healthcare services.\n\nEducation options\n\nThe education system in Chile provides various options, including public schools, which offer free education, and international or private schools, which deliver globally recognized curricula. The country also prides itself on its higher education institutions, such as the Universidad de Chile and Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile, attracting international students with a range of programs.\n\nStep 6: Ensuring your safety\n\nSafety overview\n\nWhile Chile is one of theÂ safest countries in Latin America for expatriates, maintaining vigilance, especially in crowded areas and while using public transport, is advised. The nation's geographical location makes it prone to natural events like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Thus, being prepared and familiarizing oneself with safety procedures is essential.\n\nEmergency contacts and protocols\n\nFor emergencies, the essential numbers in Chile are 133 for police assistance, 131 for ambulatory services, and 132 to report fires.Â\n\nWhile English may work in more international settings, expatriates will find that learning essential Chilean Spanish phrases or having a translation app can be crucial for clear communication in emergencies.\n\nStep 7: Embracing culture\n\nCultural insights\n\nChileanÂ Customs:Â Adopt the âbeso,â a single cheek kiss, as a common greeting among friends. Handshakes are reserved for more formal or first-time encounters\n\nDress Codes:Â While casual wear is widely accepted, many Chileans dress smartly for work and social occasions. Understanding the context is key\n\nSocial Norms: Chile is a Latin American country with deep-seated respect for family and social hierarchies. Being polite and punctual is appreciated\n\nCafÃ© Culture:Â The coffee scene in cities like Santiago is thriving, offering a cozy spot for both leisurely chats and business meetings, complete with a taste of local staples like âempanadasâ and âcortado,â a local espresso\n\nKick off your new life in Chile\n\nFrom the bustling streets of Santiago to the serene landscapes of Patagonia or the vast Atacama Desert, (did you know Easter Island/ Rapa Nui is also part of the country?) Chile offers expats a vibrant and diverse experience. You can benefit from the country's thriving job market, affordable cost of living, excellent healthcare, and rich cultural heritage.\n\nIf youâre considering making Chile your new home, careful research and planning can ensure a smooth relocation and limited culture shock.
