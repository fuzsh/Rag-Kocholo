        "text": "Argentina has three tax jurisdictions that can be applicable to an Argentine branch or subsidiary: national, provincial and municipal. The taxes applicable in each jurisdiction will depend on the location of the activities and the assets held by the entity.\n\nNational tax jurisdiction imposes corporate and personal income tax on its residents (including permanent establishments in Argentina) in respect of income earned anywhere in the world. National income tax is imposed under the Income Tax Act (ITA). Non-residents are only subject to taxation on Argentine-source income.\n\nThe ITA also imposes a withholding tax on non-residents who receive the payment of dividends, interest, royalties, technical assistance or financial advisory or management fees from Argentina. The withholding tax rate depends on the type of income.\n\nThe Argentine payer of any such amounts is liable for withholding and remitting this tax on behalf of the non-resident recipient. Argentina has entered into 22 double-taxation treaties, which will reduce or eliminate the withholding tax rate on such types of income. For example, the Argentina-Brazil Tax Convention of 1982 (updated 2018) reduces withholding tax on cross-border interest payments to 15% and reduces the rate on dividends to 15% or 10% depending on the percentage ownership interest.\n\nArgentina is a signatory to the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) and has agreed to adopt the minimum standards (principal purpose test and dispute resolution). The ratification process has not yet been completed.\n\nIn addition to income tax, a value-added tax (VAT) is levied at the federal level. This tax applies to the sale of goods located in Argentina, the provision of services and the importation of goods and services.\n\nAll of Argentina’s provinces impose a revenue tax on the regular activity of commerce, industry, services or any other activity carried out within their jurisdictions (City of Buenos Aires, Province of Buenos Aires, etc.). The taxable base is the taxpayer’s total gross revenue. The tax rate varies by provincial jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, all provinces levy a stamp tax on public or private instruments executed in Argentina or, if executed abroad, to the extent that those instruments are deemed to have effects in one or more relevant jurisdictions within Argentina.\n\nThe stamp tax rate varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but it generally amounts to 1% of the entire economic value of the agreement, except for the deeds of sale for any kind of property, which in general amount to between 2% and 4%.\n\nIn this chapter\n\nLegal systems\n\nTaxation authorities\n\nBusiness vehicle\n\nFinancing a corporate subsidiary\n\nTax on credits and debits in bank accounts\n\nPayroll taxes\n\nIndirect taxes\n\nLegal system\n\nArgentina and its provinces (including the municipalities) operate under a common law legal system.\n\nWhile the ability to make certain laws is in the exclusive domain of the federal government, others are within the scope of provincial authority. For example, while the federal government has the authority to regulate foreign trade and impose duties on imports and exports, the provinces have the right to impose revenue tax and stamp tax.\n\nTaxation authorities\n\nThe federal tax system in Argentina is administered by the Federal Administration of Public Revenues (AFIP). Each provincial and municipal jurisdiction administers and collects the taxes of its own jurisdiction.\n\nBusiness vehicles\n\nA non-resident may either establish an Argentine business vehicle to carry on business in Argentina or operate directly through a foreign entity (with or without an Argentine permanent establishment). Argentina business vehicles are corporations (limited liability or unlimited liability) and partnerships.\n\nPartnerships\n\nA partnership is generally treated as fiscally transparent for Argentine income tax purposes. Partnerships are required to file annual information returns. The resident partners, rather than the partnership itself, are subject to income tax under the ITA. However, partnerships have the option to file and pay income tax instead of their partners.\n\nAny individual who is a non-resident partner will be treated as a foreign beneficiary and is subject to 35% withholding tax. Additionally, any entity whose owner does not reside in Argentina will be considered as a local branch of a foreign company.\n\nCorporations\n\nPrivate corporations (SA), limited liability companies (SRL) and foreign company branches are the most common entities.\n\nCorporations where shareholders are not liable for the corporation’s debts have to be incorporated either federally and in any of the provinces or municipalities. The jurisdiction of incorporation does not impact on the corporation’s federal income tax liability, but it may vary the revenue tax liability since it depends on the different tax rates applicable by each province.\n\nThe establishment of an SA requires a capital of ARS 30,000,000. SRLs and foreign company branches have no minimum capital requirement, though an SRL must receive a nominal amount of capital according to the activities to be carried out and in order to issue quotas.\n\nForeign corporation (with or without an Argentine branch)\n\nA foreign corporation that carries on business in Argentina is subject to tax under the ITA in respect of such income. Non-residents and foreign legal entities without a permanent establishment (PE) in Argentina are taxed only on income from Argentine sources.\n\nAmong other situations, the PE definition includes:\n\nA building site, construction, assembly or installation project, or supervisory activities in connection therewith, but only when the site, project or activities are developed in Argentina and last more than six months.\n\nThe furnishing of services by a foreign resident, including consultancy services, directly or through employees or other personnel engaged by the enterprise for such purpose, but only if the activities continue in the country for a period or periods aggregating more than six months within any 12-month period.\n\nPersons acting in the country on behalf of a foreign legal entity, who have and habitually exercise authority to conclude contracts, or perform an influential role to conclude those contracts or assume business risks that correspond to the foreign entity or receive a compensation independently of the results obtained from the activities carried out in the country.\n\nAn entity will not be deemed to have a PE merely due to the business conducted in the country through brokers, commission agents or any other independent intermediary.\n\nCertain activities that have a preparatory or auxiliary character are not included within the definition of PE.\n\nWhere the foreign corporation or individual is resident in a country with which Argentina has a double-taxation treaty pursuant to which the corporation may claim treaty benefits, the corporation will generally be exempt from Argentine income taxation on its business profits except to the extent that the profits were earned through a PE situated in Argentina.\n\nTo apply for the treaty benefits, the foreign corporation or individual must complete and sign a sworn affidavit informing his tax residence and the application of the treaty benefits, duly certified by the competent tax authority and apostilled.\n\nA corporation that operates through an Argentine PE (such as a branch or local subsidiary) will be subject to Argentine income tax.\n\nThe ITA imposes a withholding tax of 31.5% on all payments made to non-residents in respect of services rendered in Argentina.\n\nFinancing a corporate subsidiary or a branch\n\nEquity financing\n\nContributions for shares\n\nWhere an equity investment is made into an Argentine corporation in exchange for shares, the amount of the investment is added to the corporation’s “stated capital” account. Subject to certain adjustments, a corporation’s stated capital is generally the same as its paid-up capital for tax purposes.\n\nContributions without taking additional shares\n\nWhere an equity contribution is made by a shareholder to a federally incorporated company without the issuance of additional shares, the amount is added to the “contributed surplus” account of the corporation and not stated capital. The contributed surplus can be transferred to stated capital without incurring negative tax consequences.\n\nDistributions of paid-up capital\n\nA corporation (other than a public corporation) is permitted to make distributions of its paid-up capital to a non-resident shareholder without incurring Argentine withholding tax. In contrast, the ITA does not permit the tax-free distribution of contributed surplus that has not been converted into stated capital except where the contributed surplus is being distributed to a non-resident shareholder who is the same person who previously paid in the contributed surplus.\n\nDebt financing\n\nWithholding tax implications\n\nArgentine corporations are permitted to borrow funds from related or third parties without tax implications. Furthermore, there are no Argentine tax implications on the repayment of the principal amount of such debt. Interest payments (other than participating interest) made by an Argentine resident corporation to a non-resident is subject to a withholding tax of 35%, which is reduced to 15.05% where (i) the borrower is a financial institution, (ii) the lender is a bank or financial institution not located in a low- or no-tax jurisdiction, (iii) the transaction involves the financing by a seller of depreciable movable property (cars excluded). As previously mentioned, the withholding tax rate can be reduced under an applicable double-taxation treaty. For example, the Argentina-Brazil Tax Convention reduces the withholding tax rate to 15% on cross-border interest payments (other than participating interest).\n\nThin capitalization\n\nThin capitalization rules apply as a restriction on the deductibility of interest and foreign exchange losses arising from financial loans that are entered into between an Argentine corporation and related corporations (whether local or foreign). The taxpayer is entitled to carry forward excess non-deductible interest for 5 years and unutilized deduction capacity for 3 years.\n\nThe limit equals to 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or the amount of ARS 1 million, whichever is higher. The limit does not apply to interest paid to a non-resident that was subject to withholding tax, even when the provisions of a tax treaty (e.g., reduced withholding rates or exemptions) were applied.\n\nStamp tax\n\nArgentina imposes a stamp tax on a private loan agreement in respect of debt or equity financing.\n\nStamp tax is a provincial tax levied on public or private instruments executed in Argentina or, if executed abroad, to the extent that those instruments are deemed to have effects in one or more relevant jurisdictions within Argentina.\n\nThe Argentine Supreme Court ruled that agreements entered into through written offers with a tacit acceptance or through separate documents are not subject to stamp tax.\n\nCorporate income tax\n\nIncome tax rate\n\nLocal corporations are subject to the federal income tax. A segmentation of the income tax rate must be considered for fiscal periods beginning on January 1, 2021. The taxable net amount for each segment is adjusted for inflation annually. For instance, the following amounts are applicable for the fiscal period beginning on January 1, 2024: up to 34.7 million pesos (rounded US$40,000): 25%; + 34.7 million pesos up to 347 million pesos (rounded US$400,000): 30%; + 347 million pesos: 35%.\n\nCapital gains\n\nAn Argentine resident corporation, including an Argentine subsidiary of a foreign corporation must include all capital gains (referred to as “taxable capital gains”) in its taxable income. Taxable capital gains are taxed in the same manner as ordinary income.\n\nA non-resident corporation is taxable on gains arising from the disposition of “taxable Argentine assets,” other than gains exempted under an applicable double-taxation treaty. Taxable Argentine assets includes all assets (e.g., a property located in Argentina). The withholding income tax is 17.5% of the transfer price or, at the option of the non-resident, 35% of the net actual income (income less its local deductible expenses). In the case of the gains arising from the disposition of shares of an Argentine corporation, the withholding income tax is 13.5% of the transfer price or, at the option of the non-resident, 15% of the net actual income (income less the cost of the shares). An exemption is applicable for the shares listed in stocks markets authorized by the Argentine Stock Exchange (CNV).\n\nAdditionally, a non-resident (individual or corporation) is taxable on the gains arising from the disposition of shares of a foreign corporation, partnership units or interests in a trust or permanent establishment if, at any time during the 365 days preceding the disposition, they derived more than 30% of their fair market value from shares of Argentine corporations, partnership units or interests in a trust or permanent establishment or from any other asset located in Argentina and the disposal of shares represents at least the 10% of the equity of the foreign corporation at any time during the 365 days preceding the disposition. The tax rate is 13.5% of the transfer price or, at the option of the non-resident, 15% of the net actual income, in both cases applicable on the portion of the disposal derived from Argentine participations or assets.\n\nBranch tax\n\nThe federal income tax rate for a branch is equivalent to an Argentine subsidiary of a foreign corporation.\n\nA segmentation of the income tax rate must be considered for fiscal periods beginning on January 1, 2021. The taxable net amount for each segment is adjusted for inflation annually. For instance, the following amounts are applicable for the fiscal period beginning on January 1, 2024: up to 34.7 million pesos (rounded US$40,000): 25%; + 34.7 million pesos up to 347 million pesos (rounded US$400,000): 30%; + 347 million pesos: 35%.\n\nThere is no additional branch profits tax. The ITA imposes a withholding tax applicable on the after-tax profits earned by a branch and distributed to the parent company (subject to the same treatment as dividends). The withholding income tax is 7% for fiscal periods beginning on January 1, 2018.\n\nComputation of taxable income\n\nTaxable base\n\nA taxpayer is subject to tax on its profits from carrying on its business. Profit is generally considered to be its revenues less its deductible expenditures.\n\nIncome tax is payable upon the net income earned during a given fiscal year. As a general rule, income is allocated to the fiscal year in which it accrues.\n\nTo determine Argentine income tax, transactions must be valued in Argentine currency. Consequently, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may generate foreign exchange gains or losses.\n\nThe negative tax results (tax loss carry-forwards) can be computed in the following 5 fiscal years. The carryback of losses is not permitted.\n\nDeductions\n\nA taxpayer is generally permitted to deduct its current expenses in computing business income. Additionally, the ITA includes the deduction of interests incurred for the purpose of earning income (subject to the thin capitalization rules discussed above) and depreciation expense of fixed assets (referred to as capital cost allowance).\n\nIncome tax reporting\n\nArgentine resident individuals and corporations are required to file an annual corporate income tax return. Corporate tax returns must be filed within five months of the fiscal year-end of the corporation in order to avoid late filing penalties. Individuals must file their tax returns within six months of the calendar year-end. Advanced payments are required in respect of current-year taxes.\n\nCross-border payments\n\nTransfer pricing\n\nArgentina’s transfer pricing treatment generally conforms to the arm’s length principle of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nTransfer pricing practices are considered to take place when an Argentine company enters into business transactions with (i) a related corporation located abroad, or (ii) a non-related corporation located in a low tax jurisdiction or that it qualifies as “non-cooperative” for tax transparency purposes.\n\nPursuant to the provisions relating to transfer pricing, any transactions between related companies or unrelated companies located in a low-tax jurisdiction or are qualified as “non-cooperative” are deemed not to be at arm's length, unless evidence to the contrary is provided.\n\nLow-tax jurisdictions are those with a corporate income tax rate lower than 15%.\n\nNon-cooperative jurisdictions include any country or jurisdiction that has not entered into an agreement for the exchange of information on tax matters or a convention to avoid double taxation, providing for the broad exchange of information, with Argentina. In addition, countries that have entered into any such agreement or convention but do not effectively comply with the exchange of information clause will also be considered non-cooperative countries or jurisdictions.\n\nIn order to establish that the terms of the transaction are equivalent to an arm’s length transaction (“arm’s length compliance”), an Argentine entity must submit special reports containing detailed data and supporting documentation.\n\nAdditionally, the transfer price analysis requires the issuance of an annual report opinion by an independent public accountant or economist.\n\nWithholding tax on passive income\n\nPayments made by a resident of Argentina to a non-resident on certain types of passive income are subject to the following income tax rates:\n\nDividends: 7% in respect of income obtained since January 1, 2018,\n\nInterest: 35%, which is reduced to 15.05% in certain cases (see our comments above)\n\nRoyalties: 28% if the agreement under which the royalties are paid is registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI); if this condition is not met, the effective withholding rate is 31.5%\n\nTechnical service fees for assistance, engineering or consulting services: 21% if the agreement under which the fees are paid is registered with the INPI and the services cannot be obtained in Argentina; the effective rate is 28% if the agreement is registered with the INPI but the services can be obtained in Argentina, or 31.5 % if the agreement does not fall within the scope of the transfer of technology\n\nAdvisory services, management fees or other services: 31.5%\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the withholding tax rate may be reduced under an applicable double-taxation treaty.\n\nMultilateral Instrument\n\nArgentina is a signatory to the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) since June 2017 and has agreed to adopt the minimum standards. The ratification process by Congress has not yet been completed.\n\nArgentina has listed 17 treaties to be covered by the MLI at the time of its incorporation as a signatory to the MLI. Argentina has made a reservation in general, which relates to not applying the modifications proposed by the MLI to CDIs that already provide similar provisions.\n\nNotable exclusions are Argentine’s treaties with Germany, Brazil, and Bolivia. Argentina is currently in updated treaty negotiations with Germany to incorporate elements of the MLI in the new treaty and has recently amended the treaty with Brazil incorporating MLI clauses. The treaty with Bolivia was signed in accordance with the guidelines of the principle of territoriality established in the Andean Pact Model.\n\nArgentina has adopted the minimum provisions of the MLI, in particular the preamble declaration and the PPT clause combined with the LOB clause in its simple version, as well as Article 4 (agreement on dual resident entities), Article 8 (dividends), Article 9 paragraph 4 (capital gains) and Articles 10, 12 & 13 (permanent establishment).\n\nInternational tax reform\n\nOn October 8, 2021, Argentina, along with 135 countries in the OECD Inclusive Framework (IF) on BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting), approved a two-pillar plan providing a framework to reform international tax rules with the ambition of resolving the tax challenges created by digitalization.\n\nAlthough multilateral negotiations regarding the convention to implement Pillar One have not been completed, it is expected that Argentina will sign the convention once it is concluded. Considering that Argentina has the status of \"Market Jurisdiction,\" Pillar One would allow Argentina to receive a portion of the profits of the largest multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the world providing digital services.\n\nUntil now, Argentina has not created an income or specific tax (DST) levied on foreign companies providing digital services, although there are some indirect taxes (VAT, revenue tax) levied on digital service users. These taxes are -in general- applicable to the customers if the foreign company is listed by the tax authorities as a digital service provider.\n\nArgentina has proposed a draft legislation to implement Pillar Two-related rules. However, a domestic minimum top-up tax applicable to Argentinian entities of MNEs has not been introduced yet. For instance, Argentina currently has a specific promotional regime in the Province of Tierra del Fuego that exempts from federal taxes the business that it is carried out in the territory of Tierra del Fuego or the assets located in such jurisdiction.\n\nTax on credits and debits in bank accounts\n\nThis tax is levied upon debits and credits in bank accounts and upon other transactions which could be used in substitution for a bank account. Transfers and deliveries of funds also fall within the scope of this tax, regardless of the person or entity that performs them, when those transactions are made through organized systems of payment in substitution for bank accounts.\n\nThe general rate of the tax is 0.6% over each credit and debit transaction. The 33% of the tax over each credit and debit transaction can be computed as a credit for the income tax.\n\nPayroll taxes\n\nArgentine Social Security System\n\nThe Argentine Social Security System is financed with monthly employees’ contributions (11% of salary), which the employer is liable to withhold, as well as with monthly employers’ contributions (20.4% calculated upon employees’ salaries for companies in commerce or services activities and 18% calculated upon employees’ salaries for companies in other activities or small entities).\n\nThe employee’s contributions have a cap which is currently of ARS 2,081,258.67 per month, which means that if the employee has a higher monthly salary (e.g., ARS 2,100,000), the employer should not withhold beyond the mandatory cap. The employer’s contributions have no limitations or caps.\n\nEmployment insurance health\n\nEmployment insurance health is financed by monthly employees’ contributions (3% of the salary) which the employer is liable to withhold, as well as with monthly employers’ contributions (6% of the salary).\n\nInsurance health for those retired (locally known as “Programa de Atención Médica Integral – PAMI”) is financed by monthly employees’ contributions (3% of the salary) which the employer is liable to withhold.\n\nThe employee’s contributions have a cap which is currently of ARS 2,081,258.67 per month, which means that if the employee has a higher monthly salary (e.g., ARS 2,100,000), the employer should not withhold beyond the mandatory cap. The employer’s contributions have no limitations or caps.\n\nLabor Accidents – Workers Compensation Act\n\nLaw 24,557 requires the hiring of insurance coverage in favor of the employees through specific insurance companies (locally known as “Aseguradoras de Riesgos del Trabajo – ART”), which were created by such law for protecting employees injured at work or becoming sick due to their work. This coverage provides for the necessary medical care and the payment of salaries and indemnities in case of labor accidents. This contribution depends on the agreement reached with each ART.\n\nMandatory Life Insurance\n\nEmployers in Argentina must also obtain mandatory life insurance which has a monthly cost equivalent to ARS 175.89 (US$ 0.20, approximately). Given the inadequate amount of this coverage, large employers will often provide an additional private insurance policy covering death and total disability risks.\n\nIndirect taxes\n\nValue-added tax (VAT)\n\nThis federal tax applies to the sale of goods located in Argentina, the provision of services and the importation of goods.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, services rendered outside Argentina that are effectively used or exploited in Argentina (usually called “importation of services”) are deemed rendered in Argentina, and are therefore subject to VAT.\n\nVAT is paid at each stage of the production or distribution of goods or services upon the value added during each of the stages.\n\nThe tax is levied on the difference between the so-called \"tax debit,\" which is the tax levied on the sales, and the \"tax credit,\" which is the tax levied on the purchases. This is because the VAT is intended to be a consumption tax, which is ultimately borne by the final consumer.\n\nThe difference between the \"tax debit\" and the “tax credit,\" if it is positive, constitutes the amount to be paid to the tax authority.\n\nThe general rate for this tax is 21%. Sales and imports of capital goods are in some cases subject to a lower VAT rate of 10.5%.\n\nThe VAT affidavit is submitted on a monthly basis. The VAT credit that is not offset with VAT debit in the same fiscal period can be offset with VAT debit in the following fiscal periods.\n\nRevenue tax\n\nThis provincial tax is levied on the regular activity of commerce, industry, services or any other activity carried out within the respective jurisdiction (City of Buenos Aires, Province of Buenos Aires, etc.)\n\nThe taxable base is given by the total gross revenue. The tax rate depends on the activity and the jurisdiction, since each province applies its own tax rate.\n\nThe provinces and the City of Buenos Aires have entered into the Multilateral Agreement to prevent double taxation of activities performed in more than one jurisdiction. As an example, the tax rate is 3% on gross revenue for retail sales performed in Buenos Aires City. This tax rate increases to 5% for taxpayers with annual gross revenues higher than ARS 129,450,000 (roughly US$150,000).\n\nThe revenue tax affidavit is submitted on a monthly basis.\n\nStamp tax on property transfer\n\nThe stamp tax is payable in all provinces on any acquisition of property. This stamp tax is paid equally by all parties, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.\n\nThe stamp tax rate is 3.5% in the City of Buenos Aires. The tax base is the property transfer value or the fiscal value, whichever is the highest.\n\nIncentive regime for major investments (Régimen de Incentivo para Grandes Inversiones-RIGI)\n\nCongress approved the Incentive regime for major investments (Régimen de Incentivo para Grandes Inversiones - RIGI) on June 28, 2024.This incentive regime project includes the following activities: (i) forestry; (ii) tourism; (iii) infrastructure; (iv) mining; (v) gas and oil; (vi) energy; (vii) technology; and (viii) iron and steel industry.\n\nAdherence to the RIGI will only be applicable for single project vehicles (SPVs) holding a project that qualifies as a major investment in the sectors mentioned. Consequently, the SPVs should not engage in activities or possess assets not related to said project, except for temporary investments of their working capital that contribute to the prudent management of the company's funds.\n\nThe following will be considered an SPV: (i) corporations (including sole shareholder corporation (SAU) and limited liability companies); (ii) branches established by companies incorporated abroad; and (iii) joint ventures and other associative contracts.\n\nThe interested investor will have 2 years to adhere the RIGI, starting from the entry into force of the regime, and the Executive Power of the Argentine President may extend the term to adhere to the RIGI for a period of up to 1 year from the expiration of the previous term.\n\nIn order to join the RIGI, an investment plan in computable assets must be foreseen for an amount equal or higher than the amount of US$200 million that might be increased by the Executive Power up to US$900 million. The acquisition, production, construction and/or development of assets allocated to the activities included in the RIGI are considered computable assets.\n\nProjects that may result in Argentina being a long-term supplier to global markets and that involve a minimum investment in assets of at least US$1 billion dollars may be classified as long-term strategic exports.\n\nThe Executive Power will establish the percentage of the minimum investment, which must be completed during the first and second year commencing from the date of notification of the administrative act approving the application for adherence to the RIGI. This percentage may be different for each of the first 2 years, but it must be sufficient to reach, at the end of those first 2 years, at least 40% of the minimum investment amount as a condition for remaining in the RIGI.\n\nAdditionally, the investments must have a long-term nature. They will be considered long-term if they have a quotient no greater than 30% between, the present value of the expected net cash flow, during the first 3 years from the first capital disbursement, and the net present value of the planned capital investments during that same period.\n\nOne of the objectives of the regime is to promote the development of local production chains associated with investment projects that join the RIGI. The Congress strengthened this objective by imposing on investors a commitment to hire local suppliers regarding goods and/or works for the development of the project equivalent to at least 20% of the total amount of the investment destined to pay local suppliers corresponding to the project adhered to the RIGI, as long as the offer from local suppliers is available and under market conditions in terms of price and quality. This minimum percentage must be maintained during the construction and operation stages.\n\nThe main incentives established by the project for the RIGI are the following:\n\ni. Tax benefits\n\nCorporate Income tax: Beneficiaries who are registered with this regime will be subject to a fixed tax rate of 25%. The progressive tax scale between 25% and 35% will not apply.\n\nAdditionally, the tax depreciation of the mobile fixed assets purchased, manufactured, or imported can be computed considering a useful life of fixed assets of 2 years, meanwhile the depreciation for infrastructure work can be computed considering 60% of the useful life.\n\nThe tax loss carry-forwards can be computed in the following fiscal years without a time limit. Furthermore, the tax loss carry-forwards will be adjusted for inflation from the closing of the fiscal year in which the amount was generated. The tax loss carry-forwards can also be transferred to a third party, once 5 years have passed.\n\nPayment of dividends will be subject to a 3.5% income tax withholding (instead of the 7% rate) provided that 7 years have passed since the date of registration with the RIGI.\n\nVAT: A system based on \"Tax Credit Certificates\" is established to pay obligations, based on the following considerations.\n\nUnder certain conditions, the SPVs may pay VAT to their suppliers, or to the Argentine tax authorities -in the case of imports of goods-, through the delivery of tax credit certificates.\n\nTax credit certificates shall be considered by suppliers as a VAT tax credit. If the supplier requests the refund of this VAT tax credit and the Argentine tax authorities do not proceed with the refund within a period of 3 months, the supplier may transfer said VAT tax credit to third parties without the need for prior approval.\n\nTax on credits and debits in bank accounts: This tax may be computed 100% (instead of 33%) as a credit for the income tax.\n\nii. Customs benefits\n\nSPVs included in the RIGI will be exempted from import duties, statistical fee, and any other advanced payment regime on the definitive imports of capital goods, parts, pieces, components, and raw materials.\n\nAdditionally, exports will also be fully exempted from duties once 3 years have passed since the date of registration with the RIGI. The term is reduced to 2 years for the exports carried out by the SPVs holders of declared long-term strategic export projects.\n\nSPVs included in the RIGI regime will not be subject to direct or indirect restrictions or prohibitions for importing or exporting other than non-economic prohibitions.\n\nCustoms stability is also guaranteed under this regime for 30 years.\n\niii. Foreign Exchange Regime\n\nThe proceeds from exports products under this RIGI are exempted from their obligation to be repatriated and settled in the official exchange market according to the following percentages:\n\n20% as from the second year since SPVs is adhered to the RIGI\n\n40% as from the third year and\n\n100% as from the fourth year.\n\nThese proceeds will be considered freely available funds for the SPVs.\n\nThe proceeds from exports carried out by SPVs holders of projects declared “long-term strategic exports,” are exempted from their obligation to be repatriated and settled in the official exchange market according to the following percentages:\n\n20% as from the first year since SPVs is adhered to the RIGI\n\n40% as from the second year and\n\n100% as from the third year.\n\nThe provisions set forth in this article will be applicable to the SPVs provided that those provided in the Foreign Exchange Regime are not more favorable.\n\niv. Stability\n\nThe regime provides for tax, customs, and foreign exchange stability for 30 years.\n\nFor instance, taxes to be applied to the SPVs are the ones in force at the date of adherence to the regime. New taxes created after such date will not be applicable to such vehicles, nor will increases in existing taxes. Some exceptions to this stability are the changes that might occur in the social security contributions or an increase in VAT rates.\n\nAdditionally, the provinces, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, and the municipalities that adhere to the RIGI may not impose new local taxes on the VPU, except the fees for services actually rendered.\n\nSPVs might also benefit from the elimination or reduction of taxes established in the future.\n\nv. Compatibility with other promotion regimes\n\nThe benefits provided for in this regime may not be accumulated or combined with incentives of the same nature existing in other pre-existing promotional regimes."
