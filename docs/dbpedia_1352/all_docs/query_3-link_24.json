        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1816, the United Provinces of the RÃ­o de la Plata declared their independence from Spain. After Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay went their separate ways, the area that remained became Argentina. European immigrants heavily shaped the country's population and culture, with Italy and Spain providing the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Until about the mid-20th century, much of Argentina's history was dominated by periods of internal political unrest and conflict between civilian and military factions.\n\nAfter World War II, former President Juan Domingo PERÃN -- the founder of the Peronist political movement -- introduced an era of populism, serving three non-consecutive terms in office until his death in 1974. Direct and indirect military interference in government throughout the PERÃN years led to a military junta taking power in 1976. In 1982, the junta failed in its bid to seize the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) by force from the United Kingdom. Democracy was reinstated in 1983 and has persisted despite numerous challenges, the most formidable of which was a severe economic crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent public protests and the successive resignations of several presidents. The years 2003-15 saw Peronist rule by NÃ©stor KIRCHNER (2003-07) and his spouse Cristina FERNÃNDEZ DE KIRCHNER (2007-15), who oversaw several years of strong economic growth (2003-11) followed by a gradual deterioration in the governmentâs fiscal situation and eventual economic stagnation and isolation. Argentina underwent a brief period of economic reform and international reintegration under Mauricio MACRI (2015-19), but a recession in 2018-19 and frustration with MACRIâs economic policies ushered in a new Peronist government in 2019 led by President Alberto FERNÃNDEZ and Vice President Cristina FERNÃNDEZ DE KIRCHNER. Argentina's high public debts, its pandemic-related inflationary pressures, and systemic monetary woes served as the catalyst for the 2023 elections, culminating with President Javier MILEI's electoral success. Argentina has since eliminated half of its government agencies and is seeking shock therapy to amend taxation and monetary policies.\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSouthern South America, bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, between Chile and Uruguay\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n34 00 S, 64 00 W\n\nMap references\n\nSouth America\n\nArea\n\ntotal : 2,780,400 sq km\n\nland: 2,736,690 sq km\n\nwater: 43,710 sq km\n\ncomparison ranking : total 9\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly less than three-tenths the size of the US\n\nArea comparison map :\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 11,968 km\n\nborder countries (5): Bolivia 942 km; Brazil 1,263 km; Chile 6,691 km; Paraguay 2,531 km; Uruguay 541 km\n\nCoastline\n\n4,989 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24 nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200 nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin\n\nClimate\n\nmostly temperate; arid in southeast; subantarctic in southwest\n\nTerrain\n\nrich plains of the Pampas in northern half, flat to rolling plateau of Patagonia in south, rugged Andes along western border\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Cerro Aconcagua (located in the northwestern corner of the province of Mendoza; highest point in South America) 6,962 m\n\nlowest point: Laguna del CarbÃ³n (located between Puerto San JuliÃ¡n and Comandante Luis Piedra Buena in the province of Santa Cruz) -105 m\n\nmean elevation: 595 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nfertile plains of the pampas, lead, zinc, tin, copper, iron ore, manganese, petroleum, uranium, arable land\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 53.9% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 13.9% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 0.4% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 39.6% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 10.7% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 35.4% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n23,600 sq km (2012)\n\nMajor lakes (area sq km)\n\nfresh water lake(s): Lago Buenos Aires (shared with Chile) - 2,240 sq km; Lago Argentino - 1,410 sq km; Lago Viedma - 1,090 sq km; Lago San MartÃ­n (shared with Chile) - 1,010 sq km; Lago ColhuÃ© Huapi - 800 sq km; Lago Fagnano (shared with Chile) - 590 sq km; Lago Nahuel Huapi - 550 sq km\n\nsalt water lake(s): Laguna Mar Chiquita - 1,850 sq km;\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\nRÃ­o de la Plata/ParanÃ¡ river mouth (shared with Brazil [s], Paraguay, and Uruguay) - 4,880 km; Paraguay (shared with Brazil [s], and Paraguay [m]) - 2,549 km; Uruguay (shared with Brazil [s] and Uruguay [m]) - 1,610 km\n\nnote â [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nAtlantic Ocean drainage: ParanÃ¡ (2,582,704 sq km)\n\nMajor aquifers\n\nGuaranÃ­ Aquifer System\n\nPopulation distribution\n\none-third of the population lives in Buenos Aires; pockets of agglomeration occur throughout the northern and central parts of the country; Patagonia to the south remains sparsely populated\n\nNatural hazards\n\nSan Miguel de TucumÃ¡n and Mendoza areas in the Andes subject to earthquakes; pamperos are violent windstorms that can strike the pampas and northeast; heavy flooding in some areas\n\nvolcanism: volcanic activity in the Andes Mountains along the Chilean border; Copahue (2,997 m) last erupted in 2000; other historically active volcanoes include Llullaillaco, Maipo, PlanchÃ³n-Peteroa, San JosÃ©, Tromen, Tupungatito, and Viedma\n\nGeography - note\n\nnote 1: second-largest country in South America (after Brazil); strategic location relative to sea lanes between the South Atlantic and the South Pacific Oceans (Strait of Magellan, Beagle Channel, Drake Passage); diverse geophysical landscapes range from tropical climates in the north to tundra in the far south; Cerro Aconcagua is the Western Hemisphere's tallest mountain, while Laguna del CarbÃ³n is the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere; shares IguazÃº Falls, the world's largest waterfalls system, with Brazil\n\nnote 2: southeast Bolivia and northwest Argentina seem to be the original development site for peanuts\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\ntotal: 46,994,384\n\nmale: 23,274,794\n\nfemale: 23,719,590 (2024 est.)\n\ncomparison rankings : female 33; male 33; total 34\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Argentine(s)\n\nadjective: Argentine\n\nEthnic groups\n\nEuropean (mostly Spanish and Italian descent) and Mestizo (mixed European and Indigenous ancestry) 97.2%, Indigenous 2.4%, African descent 0.4% (2010 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nSpanish (official), Italian, English, German, French, indigenous (Quechua, Guarani, Mapudungun)\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nLa Libreta Informativa del Mundo, la fuente indispensable de informaciÃ³n bÃ¡sica.

Argentina's fertility decline began earlier than in the rest of Latin America, occurring most rapidly between the early 20th century and the 1950s, and then becoming more gradual. Life expectancy has been improving, most notably among the young and the poor. While the population under age 15 is shrinking, the youth cohort - ages 15-24 - is the largest in Argentina's history and will continue to bolster the working-age population. If this large working-age population is well-educated and gainfully employed, Argentina is likely to experience an economic boost and possibly higher per capita savings and investment. Although literacy and primary school enrollment are nearly universal, grade repetition is problematic and secondary school completion is low. Both of these issues vary widely by region and socioeconomic group.\n\nArgentina has been primarily a country of immigration for most of its history, welcoming European immigrants (often providing needed low-skilled labor) after its independence in the 19th century and attracting especially large numbers from Spain and Italy. More than 7 million European immigrants are estimated to have arrived in Argentina between 1880 and 1930, when it adopted a more restrictive immigration policy. European immigration also began to wane in the 1930s because of the global depression. The inflow rebounded temporarily following WWII and resumed its decline in the 1950s when Argentina's military dictators tightened immigration rules and European economies rebounded. Regional migration increased, however, supplying low-skilled workers escaping economic and political instability in their home countries. As of 2015, immigrants made up almost 5% of Argentina's population, the largest share in South America. Migration from neighboring countries accounted for approximately 80% of Argentina's immigrant population in 2015.\n\nThe first waves of highly skilled Argentine emigrant workers headed mainly to the United States and Spain in the 1960s and 1970s, driven by economic decline and repressive military dictatorships. The 2008 European economic crisis drove the return migration of some Argentinean and other Latin American nationals, as well as the immigration of Europeans to South America, where Argentina was a key recipient. In 2015, Argentina received the highest number of legal migrants in Latin America and the Caribbean. The majority of its migrant inflow came from Paraguay and Bolivia.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 23.3% (male 5,632,983/female 5,301,778)\n\n15-64 years: 63.9% (male 15,071,215/female 14,956,069)\n\n65 years and over: 12.8% (2024 est.)
