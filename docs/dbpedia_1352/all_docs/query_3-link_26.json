This long, skinny country is located in South America and is known for its stunning scenery, friendly people and delicious food. But packing your bags and heading to the airport, there are a few things you should know about living in Chile.\n\nChile is one of the most organized, economically stable and safest countries in the entire region, but it’s a Latin American country that will is almost certainly different from your home country.

So if you’re curious about what it’s like to live in this beautiful country, keep reading!\n\nWhat’s It Like to Live in Chile?\n\nWhen it comes to quality of life, Chile is a Latin American powerhouse. The country consistently ranks high in global surveys, thanks to its strong economy, safe streets and abundance of leisure activities.\n\nBut before packing your bags and moving to Chile, it’s important to understand that life in this South American country is nothing like what you’re probably used to. From the moment you arrive, you’ll be bombarded with new sights, sounds and smells – so prepare yourself for a healthy dose of culture shock!\n\nThat said, there are plenty of reasons to live living in Chile. For starters, the cost of living is relatively low when compared to other countries around the world. You can expect to pay reasonable prices for food, transportation and entertainment.\n\nChile is also a great place to raise a family. While there are petty crimes that ravage other tourist hot spots, the country is known for its safe streets, relatively low crime and stringent gun laws. That means it’s fairly safe to let your children play outdoors without fear of being harmed. Additionally, Chilean schools are considered to be some of the best in Latin America.\n\nChile is also extremely well-known for its beautiful nature and has been named the best destination for travelers for many years. Whether you’re into vast desert landscapes or clusters of lakes and glaciers, you’ll find every landscape you can think of here.\n\nSo if you want to live in Chile and make the country your new home, be sure to remember the following:\n\nLearn some Spanish! Although English is widely spoken in Chile’s larger cities, it’s important to learn some basic Spanish phrases before moving to a smaller town or a more rural area. Learning some Spanish will make life much easier for you and make it easier to integrate into Chilean society.\n\nBe prepared for massive amounts of change. As briefly mentioned before, life in Chile is nothing like what you’re probably used to. So be prepared for a lot of change once you move. From the food to the culture and weather, everything will be different and may take some time to get used to.\n\nGet involved in your local community. One of the most efficient ways to adjust to life in Chile after your move is to get involved in your local community. Join a wine club or organization, attend community events or meet others on a cruise around the country to meet as many people as possible. This will help you get acclimated to Chilean culture and make friends along the way!\n\nSource: iStockPhoto/abriendomundo\n\nThe Pros of Living in Chile\n\n1. Safety\n\nChile is well-known for its safe streets and low crime rates, making it a great place to call home. Crime in Chile is relatively low when compared to other countries in the region.\n\nWhile petty crimes, such as theft and robbery, may be common, they usually only occur in larger cities or the more popular tourist areas. However, it still pays to know which areas you can go to and which areas you should avoid at all costs.\n\nChilean law enforcement is also considered to be one of the best in Latin America, so you can feel that much more confident that you’re safe when walking the streets or attending one of the many festivals.\n\n2. Plenty of Nature\n\nChile is a nature lover’s paradise. From the snow-capped Andes to the Magellan penguin-filled islands and massive geothermal geysers, some of the most breathtaking and jaw-dropping landscapes call this country home.\n\nIf you’re an outdoor enthusiast, Chile is definitely the place for you. Avid hikers will find some of the best trails in South America here, as well as world-class skiing and snowboarding resorts in the mountains.\n\nThe country is also home to a wealth of marine life, making it a great place for scuba diving and snorkeling. Whatever you’re into, you’re sure to find it here!\n\n3. Friendly People\n\nThe people of Chile are known for being some of the friendliest and most welcoming in the world. They’re always extremely lively and willing to help a neighbor out.\n\nChileans are also known for their sense of humor and love of storytelling. So be prepared to enjoy plenty of laughs with your new Chilean friends. However, it pays to remember that no social commitment is written in stone. You’ll find that many times people will say they will show up to a commitment and change their mind without notice.\n\n4. World-Renowned Wine\n\nWhen it comes to wine, Chile is a world-renowned destination. The country’s unique climate and soil make it the perfect place to grow a variety of grapes, resulting in some of the best wines in the world.\n\nIn addition to its award-winning wines, Chile is also known for its affordable prices. Many of the country’s wineries offer tours and tastings that are open to the public. This makes it super simple to sample some of the best wines that Chile has to offer!\n\n5. Technologically Advanced\n\nChile is a technologically advanced country with a well-developed urban infrastructure. The country has fast and reliable internet, and most major cities have reliable public transportation systems. The country is also home to a number of universities that offer courses in STEM subjects.\n\nThe Cons of Living in Chile\n\n1. Super Slow Immigration Process\n\nIf you want to live in Chile, be prepared for a slow and bureaucratic visa process. The process can take months, or even years, to complete, so be sure to start the process well in advance of your planned move.\n\nYou will likely need to hire a visa consultant to help you navigate through the bureaucratic red tape because it can be almost impossible to get someone on the phone to inquire about your visa.\n\n2. Everything Is Laid Back, Especially the Time\n\nIn Chile, everything happens at its own pace. The people are laid-back and always willing to take things slow. This can be extremely frustrating, especially for those from the US who are used to a more fast-paced lifestyle. Additionally, you can expect at least half the party to show up a few hours late, whether it’s a work meeting or a live performance.\n\nLiving in Chile\n\nOverall, Chile is a great place to live. The country has a wealth of natural beauty, friendly people and world-renowned wine. In addition, Chile is a technologically advanced country with a well-developed infrastructure that’s best enjoyed on foot or on a cruise along the country’s edge.\n\nWith careful planning, your desire to live in Chile can become a reality without any problems! So if you’re looking for a new place to call home, be sure to consider Chile.\n\nIf you found this blog helpful, check out some of our other recent posts!"
