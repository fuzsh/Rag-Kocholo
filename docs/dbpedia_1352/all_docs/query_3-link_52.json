        "text": "Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.\n\nExercise increased caution in Chile due to crime and civil unrest.\n\nCountry Summary: Street crime (e.g., muggings, pick-pocketing, theft) is common in Chile. Rates of violent crime, such as assaults, homicide, carjackings, and residential break-ins, are increasing.\n\nLarge-scale demonstrations periodically occur in Santiago and other cities in Chile. Demonstrations can take place with little or no notice, and often result in disruptions to transportation, including public bus and Santiago metro services.\n\nRead the country information page for additional information on travel to Chile.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Chile:\n\nDo not leave luggage unattended, even in locked vehicles.\n\nAlways carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location.\n\nAvoid demonstrations.\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities including movement restrictions and obey all curfews.\n\nFind a safe location and shelter in place if in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests.\n\nReview the Country Security Report for Chile.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nFollow the U.S. Embassy and Department of State on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.\n\nPrepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel.\n\nYour passport must be in good condition and valid for the period of your stay. You do not need a visa for a tourist or business stay of 90 days or fewer (if traveling on a tourist passport). Upon arrival, you will receive a Tourist Card (Tarjeta de Turismo) valid for up to 90 days, which you can extend for another 90-day period by paying $100 US at the Chilean Immigration Office. You must return the Tourist Card upon departure. Failure to return it may delay your departure from Chile. If the Tourist Card is lost or stolen, you must replace it at an International Police Office or at the airport before leaving. You will face a fine if you remain longer than allowed, and you will not be able to leave Chile until the fine is paid. If applicable, pay the fine before your departure by going to the Chilean Immigration Office or you may face significant delays.\n\nTravel on Diplomatic or Official Passports: U.S. citizens traveling to or through Chile on diplomatic or official passports are required to obtain a visa before travel.\n\nEntry / Exit Requirements for Dual Nationals: Dual nationals must enter and exit Chile using their Chilean passports, and they must enter and exit the United States using their U.S. passports.\n\nEntry / Exit Requirements for Minors (under 18): Parents traveling with a minor must show evidence of their relationship to the child when entering or departing the country. Carry an original apostilled birth certificate.\n\nMinors departing Chile must submit to Chilean airport officials an original notarized authorization from any non-traveling parent(s), a photocopy of the authorization, and an original apostilled birth certificate at the time of departure. For non-traveling parent(s) in Chile, the notarization can be done by a local Chilean notary public. For non-traveling parent(s) in the United States, the notarization can be done at the Chilean Embassy or a Chilean Consulate. If a U.S. notary executes the authorization, it must be apostilled to be valid in Chile. An apostille should be obtained well in advance of travel as the process is lengthy.\n\nThe Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides more information on entry and exit requirements for children.\n\nVisit the Embassy of Chile website for the most current visa information.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Chile.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nDemonstrations occur frequently, especially on March 29, May 1 and 21, September 11, and October 18. Although most are peaceful, they can become violent. Avoid demonstrations if possible. Strikes are also common and can cause significant travel delays, especially if you are traveling to remote areas, such as Easter Island, Punta Arenas, or Chiloe.\n\nAnarchist groups have placed explosive and incendiary devices in public spaces throughout Santiago, such as ATMs, metro stations, and government facilities. Remain vigilant and avoid suspicious or unattended packages.\n\nAraucanía Conflict: Some individuals or groups claiming affiliation with the Mapuche indigenous community have sought redress for grievances by burning churches, homes, and pastures, and attacking trucks, buses, and farming/logging equipment, causing property destruction, injuries, and deaths. In 2022, the Government of Chile implemented a State of Emergency in the area that is reevaluated every 15 days. While these groups have mainly targeted forestry corporations and landowners, you should exercise caution in the Araucanía region.\n\nCrime: Street crime, carjackings, telephone scams, credit card fraud, and residential break-ins are common, especially in Santiago, Valparaiso, Viña del Mar, Antofagasta, Calama, and Iquique. Exercise significant caution when touring Cerro Santa Lucia, Cerro San Cristobal, Mercado Central, Plaza de Armas, Bellavista, Yungay, Barrio Lastarria, Persa BioBio, Barrio Meiggs, Patronato, Centro Cultural Estación Mapocho and Los Dominicos in Santiago, or other popular tourist sites as pickpocketing and muggings occur frequently. Small bags and purses have been stolen from hotel lobbies, crowded tourist locations, Santiago’s subway, taxis, and the backs of chairs and floors at bars, restaurants, and cafés. Cell phones are often stolen from restaurant tables. Criminals have drugged and robbed U.S. citizens, leaving them with no memory of events. The murder of a U.S. citizen occurred in 2023 in the neighborhood of Yungay. Carjackings and vehicle thefts are a serious problem in Santiago, Valparaiso, and northern Chile (from Iquique to Arica). Thieves have punctured rental car tires to distract foreigners and steal their belongings from the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, though not typical touring areas, exercise significant caution when traveling through or in Villa Francia, El Castillo, La Victoria, La Pincoya, Bajos de Mena y Mahuidanche, and the municipalities of Cerro Navia, Pudahuel, Quilicura and San Bernardo in Santiago,\n\nIn particular:\n\nKeep all valuables on you when taking buses, especially to or from Calama and San Pedro de Atacama. Thefts are common and are often done by people posing as bus employees.\n\nNever allow your credit card to be charged outside of your view.\n\nDo not accept assistance if your clothes are splashed with a wet, sticky substance - keep moving and do not let go of your bags.\n\nDo not accept any beverages from strangers.\n\nDo not leave luggage unattended, even in locked vehicles.\n\nDo not physically resist any robbery attempt. Criminals rarely work alone, and things are not worth the possibility of physical harm or death.\n\nDo not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches or jewelry.\n\nUse caution when walking or driving at night, especially if alone.\n\nDo not use unauthorized taxi services. Individuals should use regulated taxis with orange or yellow license plates or ride-share applications. See Travel and Transportation section for more information\n\nAlways carry a copy of your U.S. identification (passport, driver’s license) and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location.\n\nCounterfeit and pirated goods are generally illegal in Chile. Bringing them to the United States may result in forfeitures and/or fines. See the intellectual property section of the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.\n\nSee the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.\n\nVictims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police at 133 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(56) 2 2330-3716. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nHelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nAssist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\nContact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nExplain the local criminal justice process in general terms\n\nProvide a list of local attorneys\n\nProvide information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.\n\nProvide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nHelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nReplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance or call local police at 149.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules about best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand to support organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\n\nSee our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, visit our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nSpecial Circumstances: Chile is prone to major earthquakes, wildfires, landslides, tsunamis, floods, and volcanic eruptions. The Chilean National Disaster Prevention and Response Service (SENAPRED) provides alerts and guidance for these types of events. There are emergency preparedness guides available on the Ready.gov and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) websites. It is important to make a plan and to keep emergency supplies accessible. There are recommendations for preparing a disaster supply kit available here.\n\nCitizens are advised to consult with authorities and/or hotel management if in doubt of the need to leave an area. All U.S. citizens are encouraged to monitor the news closely, including the SENAPRED website.\n\nThere are minefields on Chile's border with Peru and Bolivia, and Argentina in Patagonia. Follow clearly identified roads and trails when in minefield areas. Consult with national park or other local officials concerning minefields.\n\nFor outdoor and adventure sports along the border with Argentina, Bolivia or Peru, register with Chile’s Dirección Nacional de Fronteras y Limites del Estado, which can provide a permit allowing travelers to temporarily cross borders to engage in outdoor activities.\n\nDespite the best efforts of local authorities, assisting persons lost or injured in isolated and wilderness areas is difficult. You should only undertake organized adventure activities with a well-established and insured company. If you intend to hike, never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company. Inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to return. Register with park officials, when available, or the nearest police station when pursuing outdoor activities in remote areas. Obtain detailed information on hiking trails before setting out and do not venture off marked trails. Distances between centers for outdoor sports and top-notch hospital care can be extreme. You should consider getting medical evacuation insurance.\n\nBefore you go, consult:\n\nChilean Meteorological Service (weather forecasts)\n\nSENAPRED (Chilean National Disaster Prevention and Response Service)\n\nChilean Forestry Service (national parks and wilderness areas)\n\nFederación de Andinismo de Chile (mountain climbing)\n\nChilean National Tourist Office\n\nUnder Chilean law, you can be expelled from the country for damaging national heritage objects or places. Travelers should learn and adhere to all the rules of visiting national parks.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTQIA+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on adult same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTQIA+ events in Chile.

Laws also prevent transgender persons from changing gender markers on government-issued identity documents.\n\nSee our LGBTQIA+ Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Many public places and transportation are not adapted to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities.
