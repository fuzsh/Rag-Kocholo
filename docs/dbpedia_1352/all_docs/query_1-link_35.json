The distribution of this allele has been explored by several groups including ours. Here, we studied the frequency of HP(del) in addition to the distribution of common HP genotypes in 293 Vietnamese. The HP(del) was encountered with the frequency of 0.020. The present result suggested that this deletion allele is restricted to East and Southeast Asians. Thus, this allele seems to be a potential ancestry informative marker for these populations. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Being homozygous for the haptoglobin gene deletion allele (HPdel) is the only known cause of congenital anhaptoglobinemia, and detection of HPdel before transfusion is important to prevent anaphylactic shock. In this study, we developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based screening for HPdel. Optimal primer sets and temperature for LAMP were selected for HPdel and the 5â² region of the HP using genomic DNA as a template. Then, the effects of diluent and boiling on LAMP amplification were examined using whole blood as a template. Blood samples diluted 1:100 with 50 mmol/L NaOH without boiling gave optimal results as well as those diluted 1:2 with water followed by boiling. The results from 100 blood samples were fully concordant with those obtained by real-time PCR methods. Detection of the HPdel allele by LAMP using alkaline-denatured blood samples is rapid, simple, accurate, and cost effective, and is readily applicable in various clinical settings because this method requires only basic instruments. In addition, the simple preparation of blood samples using NaOH saves time and effort for various genetic tests.

Being homozygous for the Hp gene deletion (HP(del)) is the only known cause of congenital anhaptoglobinemia, and clinical diagnosis of HP(del) before transfusion is important to prevent anaphylactic shock. We recently developed a 5'-nuclease (TaqMan) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. A SYBR Green I-based duplex real-time PCR assay using two forward primers and a common reverse primer followed by melting curve analysis was developed to determine HP(del) zygosity in a single tube. In addition, to obviate initial DNA extraction, we examined serially diluted blood samples as PCR templates. Allelic discrimination of HP(del) yielded optimal results at blood sample dilutions of 1:64 to 1:1024. The results from 2231 blood samples were fully concordant with those obtained by the TaqMan-based real-time PCR method. The detection rate of the HP(del) allele by the SYBR Green I-based method is comparable with that using the TaqMan-based method. This method is readily applicable due to its low initial cost and analyzability using economical real-time PCR machines and is suitable for high-throughput analysis as an alternative method for allelic discrimination of HP(del).\n\nAssociation between haptoglobin gene and insulin resistance in Arab-Americans.\n\nPubMed\n\nBurghardt, Kyle J; Masri, Dana El; Dass, Sabrina E; Shikwana, Sara S; Jaber, Linda A\n\n2017-11-01\n\nTo analyze associations between variation in the HPÂ gene and lipid and glucose-related measures in Arab-Americans. Secondary analyses were performed based on sex. Genomic DNA was extracted from samples obtained from a previous epidemiological study of diabetes in Arab-Americans. The HP 1 and 2 alleles were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis. Associations were analyzed by linear regression. Associations were identified between the heterozygous haptoglobin 2-1 genotype and insulin resistance, fasting insulin and fasting c-peptide. The effect of sex did not remain significant after adjustment for relevant variables. HPÂ genetic variation may have utility as a biomarker of insulin resistance and diabetes risk in Arab-Americans, however, future prospective studies are needed.\n\nHaptoglobin gene polymorphisms in peri-implantitis and chronic periodontitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nEbadian, Ahmad R; Kadkhodazadeh, Mahdi; Naghavi, Seyed Hamid Hosseini; Torshabi, Maryam; Tamizi, Mahmood\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe haptoglobin-hemoglobin (Hp-Hb) complex plays a significant role in regulating immune responses and acts as a bacteriostatic agent. Haptoglobin polymorphisms result in different Hb binding affinities. This study sought to assess whether HpÂ 2-2 could be a genetic determinant for increasing the risk of peri-implantitis and chronic periodontitis. Of the Iranian subjects referred to the Department of Periodontics, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, 203 were entered into the study, including 117 patients and 86 periodontally healthy individuals. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for genotyping. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test using the SPSS statistics software package. The prevalence of HpÂ 2-2, 2-1, and 1-1 did not differ significantly between patients and healthy subjects (PÂ >Â 0.05). The highest frequencies of HpÂ 1-1, 2-1, and 2-2 genotypes were seen in the control (7%), peri-implantitis (51%) and periodontitis (64%) groups, respectively. Haptoglobin polymorphisms may not play a role in development of peri-implantitis or chronic periodontitis among Iranians but we strongly suggest researchers to evaluate this polymorphism in further studies on larger sample sizes, different populations, and other types of periodontitis.

The expression of cytokines is regulated by genetic mechanisms however the effect of haptoglobin polymorphisms on these cytokines is not fully understood. This study aimed to compare the frequency of haptoglobin genotypes and the interleukin-6 and -8 concentrations in sickle cell anemia patients and controls to investigate the association between haptoglobin genotypes and cytokine levels. Methods Sixty sickle cell anemia patients and 74 healthy individuals were analyzed. Haptoglobin genotypes were determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction, and the interleukin-6 and -8 levels by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The association between haptoglobin genotypes and cytokines was investigated by statistical tests. Results Hp2-1 was the most common genotype in both the cases and controls while Hp1-1 was less frequent among sickle cell anemia patients. Interleukin-6 and -8 levels were higher in patients than controls (p-value <0.0001). There was no significant difference in interleukin-6 and -8 concentrations between the genotypes (p-value >0.05). A similar trend was observed among the controls. Conclusion Although, levels of interleukin-6 and -8 were higher in the sickle cell anemia patients, they appeared not to be related to the haptoglobin genotypes. Further investigations are necessary to identify factors responsible for increased secretion of the interleukin-6 and -8 pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with sickle cell anemia.

Haptoglobin polymorphism in humans, characterized by the Hp*1 and Hp *2 alleles, results in distinct phenotypes known as Hp1-1, Hp2-1 and Hp2-2, whose frequencies vary according to the ethnic origin of the population. The Hp*1 allele has two subtypes, Hp *1F and Hp *1S , that also vary in their frequencies among populations worldwide. In this work, we examined the distribution frequencies of haptoglobin subtypes in three Brazilian population groups of different ethnicities. The haptoglobin genotypes of Kayabi Amerindians (n = 56), Kalunga Afro-descendants (n = 70) and an urban population (n = 132) were determined by allele-specific PCR. The Hp*1F allele frequency was highest in Kalunga (29.3%) and lowest in Kayabi (2.6%). The Hp*1F/Hp*1S allele frequency ratios were 0.6, 1.0 and 0.26 for the Kayabi, Kalunga and urban populations, respectively. This variation was attributable largely to the Hp*1F allele. However, despite the large variation in Hp*1F frequencies, results of F ST (0.0291) indicated slight genetic differentiation among subpopulations of the general Brazilian population studied here. This is the first Brazilian report of variations in the Hp*1F and Hp*1S frequencies among non-Amerindian Brazilians.

Cis-acting elements responsible for this response are localized within the first 186 bp of the 5'-flanking region. Site-specific mutants of the Hp promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene were analysed by transient transfection into uninduced and IL-6-treated Hep3B cells. We identified three regions, A, B and C, defined by mutation, which are important for the IL-6 response. Band shift experiments using nuclear extracts from untreated or IL-6-treated cells revealed the presence of IL-6-inducible DNA binding activities when DNA fragments containing the A or the C sequences were used. Competition experiments showed that both sequences bind to the same nuclear factors. Polymers of oligonucleotides containing either the A or the C regions confer IL-6 responsiveness to a truncated SV40 promoter. The B region forms several complexes with specific DNA-binding proteins different from those which bind to the A and C region. The B region complexes are identical in nuclear extracts from IL-6-treated and untreated cells. While important for IL-6 induction in the context of the haptoglobin promoter, the B site does not confer IL-6 inducibility to the SV40 promoter. Our results indicate that the IL-6 response of the haptoglobin promoter is dependent on the presence of multiple, partly redundant, cis-acting elements.

This technique provides a highly specific, single-step purification method without the contamination of extraneous serum proteins reported by previous studies. Complex formation between the haptoglobin isolate and swine hemoglobin confirmed that biological activity was maintained during the purification process. Immunoelectrophoretic and Ouchterlony immunodiffusion methods revealed that the swine haptoglobin isolate cross-reacted with polyvalent antisera against human haptoglobin. Images Fig. 2. Fig. 3.

The SGD mutant collections contain (1), 3517 mutants in which a single gene is replaced by a cassette containing a kanamycin resistance (KanR) gene oriented in the sense direction (SGD-K), and (2), 3376 mutants with a chloramphenicol resistance gene (CamR) oriented in the antisense direction (SGD-C). A combined total of 3773 individual genes were deleted across these SGD collections. The MGD collections contain mutants bearing deletions of contiguous regions of three or more genes and include (3), 198 mutants spanning 2543 genes replaced by a KanR cassette (MGD-K), and (4), 251 mutants spanning 2799 genes replaced by a CamR cassette (MGD-C). Overall, 3476 genes were deleted in at least one MGD collection. The collections with different antibiotic markers permit construction of all viable combinations of mutants in the same background. Together, the libraries allow hierarchical screening of MGDs for different phenotypic followed by screening of SGDs within the target MGD regions. The mutants of these collections are stored at BEI Resources (www.beiresources.org) and publicly available.\n\nDexamethasone-induced haptoglobin release by calf liver parenchymal cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nHiguchi, H; Katoh, N; Miyamoto, T; Uchida, E; Yuasa, A; Takahashi, K\n\n1994-08-01\n\nParenchymal cells were isolated from the liver of male calves, and monolayer cultures formed were treated with glucocorticoids to examine whether haptoglobin, appearance of which is associated with hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver) in cattle, is induced by steroid hormones. Without addition of dexamethasone, only trace amounts of haptoglobin were detected in culture medium. With addition of dexamethasone (10(-12) to 10(-4) M), considerable amounts of haptoglobin were released into the medium. Maximal release was observed at concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-6) M dexamethasone. Haptoglobin release was similarly induced by cortisol, although the effect was less potent than that of dexamethasone. Actinomycin D (a known protein synthesis inhibitor) dose-dependently reduced amounts of haptoglobin released in response to 10(-8) M dexamethasone. Dexamethasone also induced annexin I, which is known to be synthesized in response to glucocorticoids. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in reduced protein kinase C activity in the cell cytosol, which has been shown to be an early event in dexamethasone-treated cells. Other than glucocorticoids, estradiol induced haptoglobin release, whereas progesterone was less effective. The association of haptoglobin with hepatic lipidosis can be reasonably explained by the fact that haptoglobin production by the liver is induced by glucocorticoids and estradiol, and these steroid hormones are triggers for development of hepatic lipidosis in cattle.\n\nSTAT3/NF-ÎºB interactions determine the level of haptoglobin expression in male rats exposed to dietary restriction and/or acute phase stimuli.\n\nPubMed\n\nUskokoviÄ, Aleksandra; DiniÄ, Svetlana; MihailoviÄ, Mirjana; GrdoviÄ, Nevena; ArambaÅ¡iÄ, Jelena; VidakoviÄ, Melita; BogojeviÄ, Desanka; IvanoviÄ-MatiÄ, Svetlana; MartinoviÄ, Vesna; PetroviÄ, Miodrag; PoznanoviÄ, Goran; Grigorov, Ilijana\n\n2012-01-01\n\nHaptoglobin is a constitutively expressed protein which is predominantly synthesized in the liver. During the acute-phase (AP) response haptoglobin is upregulated along with other AP proteins. Its upregulation during the AP response is mediated by cis-trans interactions between the hormone-responsive element (HRE) residing in the haptoglobin gene and inducible transcription factors STAT3 and C/EBP Î². In male rats that have been subjected to chronic 50% dietary restriction (DR), the basal haptoglobin serum level is decreased. The aim of this study was to characterize the trans-acting factor(s) responsible for the reduction of haptoglobin expression in male rats subjected to 50% DR for 6Â weeks. Protein-DNA interactions between C/EBP and STAT families of transcription factors and the HRE region of the haptoglobin gene were examined in livers of male rats subjected to DR, as well as during the AP response that was induced by turpentine administration. In DR rats, we observed associations between the HRE and C/EBPÎ±/Î², STAT5b and NF-ÎºB p50, and the absence of interactions between STAT3 and NF-kB p65. Subsequent induction of the AP response in DR rats by turpentine administration elicited a normal, almost 2-fold increase in the serum haptoglobin level that was accompanied by HRE-binding of C/EBPÎ², STAT3/5b and NF-kB p65/p50, and the establishment of interaction between STAT3 and NF-ÎºB p65. These results suggest that STAT3 and NF-ÎºB p65 crosstalk plays a central role while C/EBPÎ² acquires an accessory role in establishing the level of haptoglobin gene expression in male rats exposed to DR and AP stimuli.\n\n[Chromosomal large fragment deletion induced by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system].\n\nPubMed\n\nCheng, L H; Liu, Y; Niu, T\n\n2017-05-14\n\nObjective: Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to achieve a number of genes co-deletion on the same chromosome. Methods: CRISPR-Cas9 lentiviral plasmid that could induce deletion of Aloxe3-Alox12b-Alox8 cluster genes located on mouse 11B3 chromosome was constructed via molecular clone. HEK293T cells were transfected to package lentivirus of CRISPR or Cas9 cDNA, then mouse NIH3T3 cells were infected by lentivirus and genomic DNA of these cells was extracted. The deleted fragment was amplified by PCR, TA clone, Sanger sequencing and other techniques were used to confirm the deletion of Aloxe3-Alox12b-Alox8 cluster genes. Results: The CRISPR-Cas9 lentiviral plasmid, which could induce deletion of Aloxe3-Alox12b-Alox8 cluster genes, was successfully constructed. Deletion of target chromosome fragment (Aloxe3-Alox12b-Alox8 cluster genes) was verified by PCR. The deletion of Aloxe3-Alox12b-Alox8 cluster genes was affirmed by TA clone, Sanger sequencing, and the breakpoint junctions of the CRISPR-Cas9 system mediate cutting events were accurately recombined, insertion mutation did not occur between two cleavage sites at all. Conclusion: Large fragment deletion of Aloxe3-Alox12b-Alox8 cluster genes located on mouse chromosome 11B3 was successfully induced by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system.\n\nTargeted Gene Deletion in Cordyceps militaris Using the Split-Marker Approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nLou, HaiWei; Ye, ZhiWei; Yun, Fan; Lin, JunFang; Guo, LiQiong; Chen, BaiXiong; Mu, ZhiXian\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe macrofungus Cordyceps militaris contains many kinds of bioactive ingredients that are regulated by functional genes, but the functions of many genes in C. militaris are still unknown. In this study, to improve the frequency of homologous integration, a genetic transformation system based on a split-marker approach was developed for the first time in C. militaris to knock out a gene encoding a terpenoid synthase (Tns). The linear and split-marker deletion cassettes were constructed and introduced into C. militaris protoplasts by PEG-mediated transformation. The transformation of split-marker fragments resulted in a higher efficiency of targeted gene disruption than the transformation of linear deletion cassettes did. The color phenotype of the Tns gene deletion mutants was different from that of wild-type C. militaris. Moreover, a PEG-mediated protoplast transformation system was established, and stable genetic transformants were obtained. This method of targeted gene deletion represents an important tool for investigating the role of C. militaris genes.\n\nA high-throughput method for the detection of homoeologous gene deletions in hexaploid wheat\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Mutational inactivation of plant genes is an essential tool in gene function studies. Plants with inactivated or deleted genes may also be exploited for crop improvement if such mutations/deletions produce a desirable agronomical and/or quality phenotype. However, the use of mutational gene inactivation/deletion has been impeded in polyploid plant species by genetic redundancy, as polyploids contain multiple copies of the same genes (homoeologous genes) encoded by each of the ancestral genomes. Similar to many other crop plants, bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is polyploid; specifically allohexaploid possessing three progenitor genomes designated as 'A', 'B', and 'D'. Recently modified TILLING protocols have been developed specifically for mutation detection in wheat. Whilst extremely powerful in detecting single nucleotide changes and small deletions, these methods are not suitable for detecting whole gene deletions. Therefore, high-throughput methods for screening of candidate homoeologous gene deletions are needed for application to wheat populations generated by the use of certain mutagenic agents (e.g. heavy ion irradiation) that frequently generate whole-gene deletions. Results To facilitate the screening for specific homoeologous gene deletions in hexaploid wheat, we have developed a TaqMan qPCR-based method that allows high-throughput detection of deletions in homoeologous copies of any gene of interest, provided that sufficient polymorphism (as little as a single nucleotide difference) amongst homoeologues exists for specific probe design. We used this method to identify deletions of individual TaPFT1 homoeologues, a wheat orthologue of the disease susceptibility and flowering regulatory gene PFT1 in Arabidopsis. This method was applied to wheat nullisomic-tetrasomic lines as well as other chromosomal deletion lines to locate the TaPFT1 gene to the long arm of chromosome 5. By screening of individual DNA samples from 4500 M2 mutant wheat\n\nHomozygous hereditary C3 deficiency due to a partial gene deletion.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBotto, M; Fong, K Y; So, A K; Barlow, R; Routier, R; Morley, B J; Walport, M J\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe molecular mechanism of C3 deficiency in an Afrikaans patient with recurrent pyogenic infections was studied. Restriction enzyme analysis showed a gene deletion of 800 base pairs (bp) mapping to the alpha chain of C3. Amplification of genomic DNA, using the PCR, demonstrated that the deletion included exons 22 and 23 of the C3 gene. Truncated mRNA was shown in an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line by PCR amplification of first-strand cDNA. A consequence of this deletion was that the RNA transcribed 3' to the deletion was out of frame, resulting in formation of a stop codon 19 bp downstream from the deletion. The molecular basis of the deletion was compatible with homologous recombination between two Alu sequences located in introns 21 and 23. An unrelated nonconsanguineous relative and two of a sample of 174 Afrikaans-speaking individuals were heterozygous carriers of the same gene deletion. The wide prevalence of this null allele in this population is probably due to the effects of a small founder population. The presence of this deletion in the C3 gene is not compatible with production of any functional C3, supporting the idea that study of such patients offers a valid model for understanding physiological activities of C3 in vivo in humans.

To investigate the contribution to variability by genes either contiguous to or contained within the NF1 gene, the authors screened six NF1 patients with mild facial dysmorphology, mental retardation, and/or learning disabilities, for DNA rearrangement of the NF1 region. Five of the six patients had NF1 gene deletions on the basis of quantitative densitometry, locus hemizygosity, and analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines. Analysis of hybrid lines carrying each of the patient's chromosomes 17, with 15 regional DNA markers, demonstrated that each of themoreÂ Â» five patients carried a deletion >700 kb in size. Minimally, each of the deletions involved the entire 350-kb NF1 gene; the three genes - EVI2A, EVI2B, and OMG-that are contained within an NF1 intron; and considerable flanking DNA. For four of the patients, the deletions mapped to the same interval; the deletion in the fifth patient was larger, extending farther in both directions. The remaining NF1 allele presumably produced functional neurofibromin; no gene rearrangements were detected, and RNA-PCR demonstrated that it was transcribed. These data provide compelling evidence that the NF1 disorder results from haploid insufficiency of neurofibromin. Of the three documented de novo deletion cases, two involved the paternal NF1 allele and one the maternal allele. The parental origin of the single remaining expresses NF1 allele had no dramatic effect on patient phenotype. The deletion patients exhibited a variable number of physical anomalies that were not correlated with the extent of their deletion. All five patients with deletions were remarkable for exhibiting a large number of neurfibromas for their age, suggesting that deletion of an unknown gene in the NF1 region may affect tumor initiation or development. 69 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.Â«Â less\n\nSmoking, haptoglobin and fertility in humans\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBottini, N; Magrini, A; MacMurray, J; Cosmi, E; Nicotra, M; Gloria-Bottini, F; Bergamaschi, A\n\n2003-01-01\n\nA prospective study on two samples of consecutive puerperae (total nÂ° 667) from two populations has been carried out in order to investigate the possible effect of smoking habit on relationship between fertility and haptoglobin phenotype. In both populations the negative association previously reported between age of pueperae and Haptoglobin *1/*1 phenotype is present only in women with smoking habit pointing to an interaction between Hp and smoke on human fertility. This suggests that the effects of smoke on fertility are dependent on the Hp phenotype.\n\nLarge-scale deletions of the ABCA1 gene in patients with hypoalphalipoproteinemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nDron, Jacqueline S; Wang, Jian; Berberich, Amanda J; Iacocca, Michael A; Cao, Henian; Yang, Ping; Knoll, Joan; Tremblay, Karine; Brisson, Diane; Netzer, Christian; Gouni-Berthold, Ioanna; Gaudet, Daniel; Hegele, Robert A\n\n2018-06-04\n\nCopy-number variations (CNVs) have been studied in the context of familial hypercholesterolemia but have not yet been evaluated in patients with extremes of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. We evaluated targeted next-generation sequencing data from patients with very low HDL cholesterol (i.e. hypoalphalipoproteinemia) using the VarSeq-CNV caller algorithm to screen for CNVs disrupting the ABCA1, LCAT or APOA1 genes. In four individuals, we found three unique deletions in ABCA1: a heterozygous deletion of exon 4, a heterozygous deletion spanning exons 8 to 31, and a heterozygous deletion of the entire ABCA1 gene. Breakpoints were identified using Sanger sequencing, and the full-gene deletion was also confirmed using exome sequencing and the Affymetrix CytoScanTM HD Array. Before now, large-scale deletions in candidate HDL genes have not been associated with hypoalphalipoproteinemia; our findings indicate that CNVs in ABCA1 may be a previously unappreciated genetic determinant of low HDL cholesterol levels. By coupling bioinformatic analyses with next-generation sequencing data, we can successfully assess the spectrum of genetic determinants of many dyslipidemias, now including hypoalphalipoproteinemia.

To analyse the restriction of salivary IgG subclasses, we used unstimulated whole saliva and sera collected at the same time from individuals with homozygous gene deletions, two with G1 deletion, one with G4 deletion, six with both G2 and G4 deletions and from eight individuals without IGHG gene deletions and expressing all four IgG subclasses. The median values of salivary IgG from individuals with homozygous G1, or G4, or both G2 and G4 deletions, and from individuals expressing all four subclasses were 24.2 mg/l and 23.4 mg/l, respectively. The median values of serum IgG were 13.7 g/l and 15.9 g/l, respectively. Our results show that the salivary and serum IgG levels were both within the normal range in individuals with homozygous gene deletions of either G1, or G4, or both G2 and G4.

Haptoglobin phenotype determination by radioimmunoelectrophoresis on Hp O samples.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nConstans, J; Viau, M; Gouaillard, C; Clerc, A\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe haptoglobin (Hp) polymorphism is investigated in 11 African groups living in an area from the Algerian Sahara to Central Africa. More than 4,000 samples were examined. In the Saharian samples, the Hp1 gene frequency is higher than in any other African group. From north to south, a decrease in the Hp1 gene frequency is observed; in the Pygmy sample only, this frequency is lower than the frequency of the Hp2 gene. By means of a sensitive radioimmunoelectrophoresis, the presence of a residual Hp in Hp O sera in which the Hp polymorphism can also be determined can be revealed. Absence of Hp 1-1 and significant excess of Hp 2-2 individuals were observed. More Hp 2-1M phenotypes were detected in the Hp O population than in the non-Hp O population examined. In the Hp O samples, the influence of the phenotype distribution on the Hp gene frequencies is discussed. The heavy polymers of the Hp related to the presence of the alpha 2 chain (Hp2 gene product) are involved only in the biological mechanisms responsible for the presence of Hp O and Hp 2-1 M phenotypes among African groups.

However, the method is time-consuming because it requires restriction digestion of the PCR products in DNA cloning and the construction of new vectors containing a suitable antibiotic resistance cassette for the selection of A. baumannii merodiploids. Moreover, the availability of restriction sites and the selection of recombinant bacteria harboring the desired chimeric plasmid are limited, making the construction of a chimeric plasmid more difficult. We describe a rapid and easy cloning method for markerless gene deletion in A. baumannii, which has no limitation in the availability of restriction sites and allows for easy selection of the clones carrying the desired chimeric plasmid. Notably, it is not necessary to construct new vectors in our method. This method utilizes direct cloning of blunt-end DNA fragments, in which upstream and downstream regions of the target gene are fused with an antibiotic resistance cassette via overlap extension PCR and are inserted into a blunt-end suicide vector developed for blunt-end cloning. Importantly, the antibiotic resistance cassette is placed outside the downstream region in order to enable easy selection of the recombinants carrying the desired plasmid, to eliminate the antibiotic resistance cassette via homologous recombination, and to avoid the necessity of constructing new vectors. This strategy was successfully applied to functional analysis of the genes associated with iron acquisition by A. baumannii ATCC 19606 and to ompA gene deletion in other A. baumannii strains. Consequently, the proposed method is invaluable for markerless gene deletion in multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.

We found two separate deletions of nearly 8.0 and 6.0 kb in the GALNS gene, including some exons. There are Alu repetitive elements near the breakpoints of the 8.0-kb deletion, and this deletion resulted from an Alu-Alu recombination. The other 6.0-kb deletion involved illegitimate recombinational events between incomplete short direct repeats of 8 bp at deletion breakpoints. The same rearrangement has been observed in a heteroallelic state in four unrelated patients. This is the first documentation of a common double deletion a gene thatmoreÂ Â» is not a member of a gene cluster. 39 refs., 5 figs.Â«Â less\n\nA large homozygous deletion in the SAMHD1 gene causes atypical AicardiâGoutiÃ©res syndrome associated with mtDNA deletions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeshinsky-Silver, Esther; Malinger, Gustavo; Ben-Sira, Liat; Kidron, Dvora; Cohen, Sarit; Inbar, Shani; Bezaleli, Tali; Levine, Arie; Vinkler, Chana; Lev, Dorit; Lerman-Sagie, Tally\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAicardiâGoutiÃ©res syndrome (AGS) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder with clinical symptoms mimicking a congenital viral infection. Five causative genes have been described: three prime repair exonuclease1 (TREX1), ribonucleases H2A, B and C, and most recently SAM domain and HD domain 1 (SAMHD1). We performed a detailed clinical and molecular characterization of a family with autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder showing white matter destruction and calcifications, presenting in utero and associated with multiple mtDNA deletions. A muscle biopsy was normal and did not show any evidence of respiratory chain dysfunction. Southern blot analysis of tissue from a living child and affected fetuses demonstrated multiple mtDNA deletions. Molecular analysis of genes involved in mtDNA synthesis and maintenance (POLGÎ±, POLGÎ², Twinkle, ANT1, TK2, SUCLA1 and DGOUK) revealed normal sequences. Sequencing of TREX1 and ribonucleases H2A, B and C failed to reveal any mutations. Whole-genome homozygosity mapping revealed a candidate region containing the SAMHD1 gene. Sequencing of the gene in the affected child and two affected fetuses revealed a large deletion (9âkb), spanning the promoter, exon1 and intron 1. The parents were found to be heterozygous for this deletion. The identification of a homozygous large deletion in the SAMHD1 gene causing atypical AGS with multiple mtDNA deletions may add information regarding the involvement of mitochondria in self-activation of innate immunity by cell intrinsic components.

CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 is a rapidly developing technology used to produce gene-specific modifications in both mammalian and plant systems. Most CRISPR-induced modifications in plants reported to date have been small insertions or deletions. Few large target gene deletions have thus far been reported, especially for Indica rice. In this study, we designed multiple CRISPR sgRNAs and successfully deleted DNA fragments in the gene DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE1 (DEP1) in the elite Indica rice line IR58025B. We achieved deletion frequencies of up to 21% for a 430Â bp target and 9% for a 10Â kb target among T0 events. Constructs with four sgRNAs did not generate higher full-length deletion frequencies than constructs with two sgRNAs. The multiple mutagenesis frequency reached 93% for four targets, and the homozygous mutation frequency reached 21% at the T0 stage. Important yield-related trait characteristics, such as dense and erect panicles and reduced plant height, were observed in dep1 homozygous T0 mutant plants produced by CRISPR/Cas9. Therefore, we successfully obtained deletions in DEP1 in the Indica background using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing tool at relatively high frequency.\n\n[Orthopoxvirus genes for kelch-like proteins. III.

A complete set of insertion plasmids was constructed to allow the production of recombinant ectromelia viruses with targeted deletions of one to four genes of kelch family both individually (single mutants) and in different combinations (double, triple and quadruple mutants). It was shown that deletion of any of the three genes EVMO18, EVM027 or EVM167 resulted in reduction of 50% lethal dose (LD50) by five and more orders in outbred white mice infected intraperitoneally. Deletion of mousepox kelch-gene EVM150 did not influence the virus virulence. Two or more kelch-genes deletion also resulted in high level of attenuation, which could evidently be due to the lack of three genes EVM167, EVM018 and/or EVM027 identified as virulence factors. The local inflammatory process on the model of intradermal injection of mouse ear pinnae (vasodilatation level, hyperemia, cutaneous edema, arterial thrombosis) was significantly more intensive for wild type virus and virulent mutant deltaEVM150 in comparison with avirulent mutant AEVM167.\n\nVIP Gene Deletion in Mice Causes Cardiomyopathy Associated with Upregulation of Heart Failure Genes\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSzema, Anthony M.; Hamidi, Sayyed A.; Smith, S.

Elimination requires a better understanding of the epidemiology and clinical evolution of HAT. In addition to the classical clinical evolution of HAT, asymptomatic carriers and spontaneous cure have been reported in West Africa. A genetic component to human susceptibility to HAT has been suggested to explain these newly observed responses to infection. In order to test for genetic associations with infection response, genetic polymorphism in 17 genes were tested (APOL1, IL1B, IL4, IL4R, IL6, IL8, IL12B, IL12RB1, IL10, TNFA, INFG, MIF, HLA-G, HLA-A, HP, HPR and CFH). A case-control study was performed on 180 blood samples collected from 56 cases and 124 controls from Cameroon. DNA was extracted from blood samples. After quality control, 25 samples (24 controls and 1 case) were eliminated. The genotyping undertaken on 155 individuals including 55 cases and 100 controls were investigated at 96 loci (88 SNPs and 8 indels) located on 17 genes. Associations between these loci and HAT were estimated via a case-control association test. Analyses of 64 SNPs and 4 indels out of 96 identified in the selected genes reveal that the minor allele (T) of rs8062041 in haptoglobin (HP) appeared to be protective against HAT (p = 0.0002395, OR 0.359 (CI95 [0.204-0.6319])); indicating higher frequency in cases compared to controls. This minor allele with adjusted p value of 0.0163 is associated with a lower risk (protective effect) of developing sleeping sickness. The haptoglobin related protein HPR and HP are tightly linked and both are duplicated in some people and may lead to higher activity. This increased production could be responsible of the protection associated with rs8062041 even though this SNP is within HP.\n\nA polymorphism in the haptoglobin, haptoglobin related protein locus is associated with risk of human sleeping sickness within Cameroonian populations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOfon, Elvis; Noyes, Harry; Mulindwa, Julius; Ilboudo, Hamidou; Simuunza, Martin; Eboâo, Vincent; Njiokou, Flobert; Koffi, Mathurin; Bucheton, Bruno; Fogue, Pythagore; Hertz-Fowler, Christiane; MacLeod, Annette\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected disease targeted for elimination as a public health problem by 2020.

One of the many advantages of yeast is the many genetic tools available to manipulate gene expression, but there are still limitations. To complement the many methods used to control gene expression in yeast, we have established a conditional gene deletion system by using the FLP/FRT system on yeast vectors to conditionally delete specific yeast genes. Expression of Flp recombinase, which is under the control of the GAL1 promoter, was induced by galactose, which in turn excised FRT sites flanked genes. The efficacy of this system was examined using the FRT site-flanked genes HSP104, URA3 and GFP. The pre-excision frequency of this system, which might be caused by the basal activity of the GAL1 promoter or by spontaneous recombination between FRT sites, was detected ca. 2% under the non-selecting condition. After inducing expression of Flp recombinase, the deletion efficiency achieved ca. 96% of cells in a population within 9 h. After conditional deletion of the specific gene, protein degradation and cell division then diluted out protein that was expressed from this gene prior to its excision. Most importantly, the specific protein to be deleted could be expressed under its own promoter, so that endogenous levels of protein expression were maintained prior to excision by the Flp recombinase. Therefore, this system provides a useful tool for the conditional deletion of genes in yeast.

In this study, using a T7 mutant phage, where a 31-bp segment of TÏ was deleted from the genome, we discovered that deletion of TÏ from T7 reduces the phage burst size but delays lysis timing, both of which are disadvantageous for the phage. The burst downsizing could directly result from TÏ deletion-caused upregulation of gene 17.5, coding for holin, among other TÏ downstream genes, because infection of gp17.5-overproducing Escherichia coli by wild-type T7 phage showed similar burst downsizing. However, the lysis delay was not associated with cellular levels of holin or lysozyme or with rates of phage adsorption. Instead, when allowed to evolve spontaneously in five independent adaptation experiments, the TÏ-lacking mutant phage, after 27 or 29 passages, recovered both burst size and lysis time reproducibly by deleting early genes 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 of class I, among other mutations. Deletion of genes 0.5 to 0.7 from the TÏ-lacking mutant phage decreased expression of several TÏ downstream genes to levels similar to that of the wild-type phage. Accordingly, phage T7 lysis timing is associated with cellular levels of TÏ downstream gene products. This suggests the involvement of unknown factor(s) besides the known lysis proteins, lysozyme and holin, and that TÏ plays a role of optimizing burst size and lysis time during T7 infection.

This region harbours the tumor suppressor gene prefoldin subunit 5 (PFDN5) and the deletion correlated with a higher Ki-67 score. PFDN5 has been described to repress c-MYC and is, therefore, a candidate tumor-suppressor and cancer-driver gene in canine mammary cancer. Aim of this study was to confirm the recurrent deletion in a larger number of tumors. Methods Droplet digital PCR for PFDN5 was performed in DNA from 102 malignant, 40 benign mammary tumors/dysplasias, 11 non-neoplastic mammary tissues and each corresponding genomic DNA from leukocytes. The copy number of PFDN5 was normalized to a reference amplicon on canine chromosome 32 (CFA32). Z-scores were calculated, based on Gaussian distributed normalized PFDN5 copy numbers of the leukocyte DNA. Z-scores â¤ -3.0 in tissue were considered as being indicative of the PFDN5 deletion and called as such. The Ki-67 proliferation index was assessed in a subset of 79 tissue samples by immunohistochemistry. Results The deletion was confirmed in 24% of all malignant tumors, detected in only 7.5% of the benign tumors and was not present in any normal mammary tissue sample. The subgroup of solid carcinomas (n = 9) showed the highest frequency of the deletion (67%) and those malignomas without microscopical high fraction of benign tissue (n = 71) had a 32% frequency (p<0.01 vs. benign samples). The Ki-67 score was found to be significantly higher (p<0.05) in the PFDN5-deleted group compared to malignant tumors without the deletion. Conclusions A somatic deletion of the PFDN5 gene is recurrently present in canine mammary cancer, supporting a potential role in carcinogenesis. The association of this deletion with higher Ki-67 indicates an increased proliferation rate and thus a link to tumor aggressiveness can be hypothesized. The confirmation of earlier results warrants further studies\n\nPrevalence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions in Puerto Lempira, Honduras.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdallah, Joseph F; Okoth, Sheila Akinyi; Fontecha, Gustavo A; Torres, Rosa Elena Mejia; Banegas, Engels I; Matute, MarÃ­a Luisa; Bucheli, Sandra Tamara Mancero; Goldman, Ira F; de Oliveira, Alexandre Macedo; Barnwell, John W; Udhayakumar, Venkatachalam\n\n2015-01-21\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated the deletion of the histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) gene (pfhrp2) in field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum, which could result in false negative test results when PfHRP2-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are used for malaria diagnosis. Although primary diagnosis of malaria in Honduras is determined based on microscopy, RDTs may be useful in remote areas. In this study, it was investigated whether there are deletions of the pfhrp2, pfhrp3 and their respective flanking genes in 68 P. falciparum parasite isolates collected from the city of Puerto Lempira, Honduras. In addition, further investigation considered the possible correlation between parasite population structure and the distribution of these gene deletions by genotyping seven neutral microsatellites. Sixty-eight samples used in this study, which were obtained from a previous chloroquine efficacy study, were utilized in the analysis. All samples were genotyped for pfhrp2, pfhrp3 and flanking genes by PCR. The samples were then genotyped for seven neutral microsatellites in order to determine the parasite population structure in Puerto Lempira at the time of sample collection. It was found that all samples were positive for pfhrp2 and its flanking genes on chromosome 8. However, only 50% of the samples were positive for pfhrp3 and its neighboring genes while the rest were either pfhrp3-negative only or had deleted a combination of pfhrp3 and its neighbouring genes on chromosome 13. Population structure analysis predicted that there are at least two distinct parasite population clusters in this sample population. It was also determined that a greater proportion of parasites with pfhrp3-(and flanking gene) deletions belonged to one cluster compared to the other. The findings indicate that the P. falciparum parasite population in the municipality of Puerto Lempira maintains the pfhrp2 gene and that PfHRP2-based RDTs could be considered for use in this region; however\n\nA Catalog of Genes Homozygously Deleted in Human Lung Cancer and the Candidacy of PTPRD as a Tumor Suppressor Gene\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKohno, Takashi; Otsuka, Ayaka; Girard, Luc; Sato, Masanori; Iwakawa, Reika; Ogiwara, Hideaki; Sanchez-Cespedes, Montse; Minna, John D.; Yokota, Jun\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA total of 176 genes homozygously deleted in human lung cancer were identified by DNA array-based whole genome scanning of 52 lung cancer cell lines and subsequent genomic PCR in 74 cell lines, including the 52 cell lines scanned. One or more exons of these genes were homozygously deleted in one (1%) to 20 (27%) cell lines. These genes included known tumor suppressor genes, e.g., CDKN2A/p16, RB1, and SMAD4, and candidate tumor suppressor genes whose hemizygous or homozygous deletions were reported in several types of human cancers, such as FHIT, KEAP1, and LRP1B/LRP-DIP. CDKN2A/p16 and p14ARF located in 9p21 were most frequently deleted (20/74, 27%). The PTPRD gene was most frequently deleted (8/74, 11%) among genes mapping to regions other than 9p21. Somatic mutations, including a nonsense mutation, of the PTPRD gene were detected in 8/74 (11%) of cell lines and 4/95 (4%) of surgical specimens of lung cancer. Reduced PTPRD expression was observed in the majority (>80%) of cell lines and surgical specimens of lung cancer. Therefore, PTPRD is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in lung cancer. Microarray-based expression profiling of 19 lung cancer cell lines also indicated that some of the 176 genes, such as KANK and ADAMTS1, are preferentially inactivated by epigenetic alterations. Genetic/epigenetic as well as functional studies of these 176 genes will increase our understanding of molecular mechanisms behind lung carcinogenesis.

This cross sectional study was carried out to investigate the existence or not of an association between haptoglobin genotypes and prevalence of ischemic cardiovascular events (stable angina, unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction), systemic arterial hypertension, refractory hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia in 120 type-2 diabetes mellitus patients followed up at Hospital de ClÃ­nicas da UNICAMP in Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo state, southeastern Brazil. Haptoglobin genotyping was performed by allele-specific polymerase chain reactions. The frequencies of the haptoglobin genotypes were compared with the presence/absence of cardiovascular disease, systemic arterial hypertension, refractory hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia; systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements; plasma levels of glucose, cholesterol (total, high density lipoprotein-HDL and low density lipoprotein-LDL) and triglycerides; and serum creatinine levels. Although no association between haptoglobin genotype and the presence of cardiovascular disease could be identified, we found a significant excess of patients with Hp2-1 genotype among those with refractory hypertension, who also had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total and LDL cholesterol levels. Our results suggest that type-2 diabetes mellitus patients with the Hp2-1 genotype may have higher chances of developing refractory hypertension. Further studies in other diabetic populations are required to confirm these findings.\n\nLysis delay and burst shrinkage of coliphage T7 by deletion of terminator TÏ reversed by deletion of early genes.\n\nPubMed\n\nNguyen, Huong Minh; Kang, Changwon\n\n2014-02-01\n\nBacteriophage T7 terminator TÏ is a class I intrinsic terminator coding for an RNA hairpin structure immediately followed by oligo(U), which has been extensively studied in terms of its transcription termination mechanism, but little is known about its physiological or regulatory functions. In this study, using a T7 mutant phage, where a 31-bp segment of TÏ was deleted from the genome, we discovered that deletion of TÏ from T7 reduces the phage burst size but delays lysis timing, both of which are disadvantageous for the phage. The burst downsizing could directly result from TÏ deletion-caused upregulation of gene 17.5, coding for holin, among other TÏ downstream genes, because infection of gp17.5-overproducing Escherichia coli by wild-type T7 phage showed similar burst downsizing. However, the lysis delay was not associated with cellular levels of holin or lysozyme or with rates of phage adsorption. Instead, when allowed to evolve spontaneously in five independent adaptation experiments, the TÏ-lacking mutant phage, after 27 or 29 passages, recovered both burst size and lysis time reproducibly by deleting early genes 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 of class I, among other mutations. Deletion of genes 0.5 to 0.7 from the TÏ-lacking mutant phage decreased expression of several TÏ downstream genes to levels similar to that of the wild-type phage. Accordingly, phage T7 lysis timing is associated with cellular levels of TÏ downstream gene products. This suggests the involvement of unknown factor(s) besides the known lysis proteins, lysozyme and holin, and that TÏ plays a role of optimizing burst size and lysis time during T7 infection. IMPORTANCE Bacteriophages are bacterium-infecting viruses. After producing numerous progenies inside bacteria, phages lyse bacteria using their lysis protein(s) to get out and start a new infection cycle. Normally, lysis is tightly controlled to ensure phage progenies are maximally produced and released at an optimal time. Here, we have\n\nHaptoglobin Preserves Vascular Nitric Oxide Signaling during Hemolysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchaer, Christian A; Deuel, Jeremy W; Schildknecht, Daniela; Mahmoudi, Leila; Garcia-Rubio, Ines; Owczarek, Catherine; Schauer, Stefan; Kissner, Reinhard; Banerjee, Uddyalok; Palmer, Andre F; Spahn, Donat R; Irwin, David C; Vallelian, Florence; Buehler, Paul W; Schaer, Dominik J\n\n2016-05-15\n\nHemolysis occurs not only in conditions such as sickle cell disease and malaria but also during transfusion of stored blood, extracorporeal circulation, and sepsis. Cell-free Hb depletes nitric oxide (NO) in the vasculature, causing vasoconstriction and eventually cardiovascular complications. We hypothesize that Hb-binding proteins may preserve vascular NO signaling during hemolysis. Characterization of an archetypical function by which Hb scavenger proteins could preserve NO signaling during hemolysis. We investigated NO reaction kinetics, effects on arterial NO signaling, and tissue distribution of cell-free Hb and its scavenger protein complexes. Extravascular translocation of cell-free Hb into interstitial spaces, including the vascular smooth muscle cell layer of rat and pig coronary arteries, promotes vascular NO resistance. This critical disease process is blocked by haptoglobin. Haptoglobin does not change NO dioxygenation rates of Hb; rather, the large size of the Hb:haptoglobin complex prevents Hb extravasation, which uncouples NO/Hb interaction and vasoconstriction. Size-selective compartmentalization of Hb functions as a substitute for red blood cells after hemolysis and preserves NO signaling in the vasculature. We found that evolutionarily and structurally unrelated Hb-binding proteins, such as PIT54 found in avian species, functionally converged with haptoglobin to protect NO signaling by sequestering cell-free Hb in large protein complexes. Sequential compartmentalization of Hb by erythrocytes and scavenger protein complexes is an archetypical mechanism, which may have supported coevolution of hemolysis and normal vascular function. Therapeutic supplementation of Hb scavengers may restore vascular NO signaling and attenuate disease complications in patients with hemolysis.\n\n[Gene Diagnosis and Analysis of Clinical Hematological Phenotype of Thailand Deleted Î±-Thalassemia 1].\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Na; Huang, Hai-Long; Wang, Yan; Zheng, Lin; Fang, Xiang-Qun; Cai, Mei-Ying; Wang, Lin-Shuo; Liu, He-Kun; Xu, Liang-Pu; Lin, Yuan\n\n2016-08-01\n\nTo investigate the hematologic characteristics and gene diagnosis of patients with Thailand deleted Î±-thalassemia 1, so as to provide the information for clinical genetic counseling. The clinical data of 32 patients with Thailand delated Î±-thalassemia 1 were analyzed retrospectively; the hematologic characteristics and gene diagnosis of Thailand deleted type were investigated by using routine hematologic examination, genetic detection of common thalassemia and Thailand deleted Î±-thalassemia 1. Among 32 cases, the Thailand deleted Î±-thalassemia 1 heterozygote was found in 29 cases, the Thailand deleted Î±-thalassemia 1 and Î±(3.7) gene deletion double heterozygote were found in 1 case, the Thailand deleted Î±-thalassemia 1 with Î²-thalassemia (1 case with codons 41-42 mutation heterozygous, 1 case with CD17 mutation heterozygous) was found in 2 cases by detection. The MCV and MCH levels were decreased in all cases of Thailand deleted thalassemia 1, there were significant differences in RBC, MCV, MCH (P<0.05) between normal control and Thailand deletion Î±-thalassemia 1 group; there were also significant differences in MCHC (P<0.05) between Southeast asia thalassemia and Thailand deleted Î±-thalassemia 1 group. There are no significant differences in hematological parameters except MCHC between Southeast asia thalassemia and Thailand deleted Î±-thalassemia 1 group. moreover the Thailand deleted Î±-thalassemia 1 in a certain proportion exists in area with high incidence of thalassemia, therefor the clinicians should pay more attention to the screen and diagnosis of Thailand delated Î±-thalassemia and can exactly diagnose the Thailand delected Î±-thalassemia 1 on the basis of comprehensive analysis of conventional and Thailand delected Î±-thalassemia 1 detection results, clinical presentation, hematologic parameters and ultrasonic examination, so as to avoid the birth of child with severe and intermidiate type Î±-thalassemia caused by Thailand deleted Î\n\nFucosylated haptoglobin is a novel marker for pancreatic cancer: detailed analyses of oligosaccharide structures.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyoshi, Eiji; Nakano, Miyako\n\n2008-08-01\n\nChanges in oligosaccharide structures have been reported in certain types of malignant transformation and thus can be used as tumor markers in certain types of cancer. In the case of pancreatic cancer (PC) cell lines, a variety of fucosylated proteins are secreted into the conditioned media. To identify fucosylated proteins in the sera of patients with PC, we performed Western blot analysis using Aleuria Aurantia Lectin (AAL), which is specific for fucosylated structures. An approximately 40 kD protein was found to be highly fucosylated in PC and N-terminal analysis revealed that it was the beta chain of haptoglobin. While the appearance of fucosylated haptoglobin has been reported in other diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma, liver cirrhosis, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer, the incidence was significantly higher in the case of PC. Fucosylated haptoglobin was observed more frequently at the advanced stage of PC and disappeared after operation. Haptoglobin has four sites of N-glycans and site-directed oligosaccharide analysis involving MS was performed. Site-specific increases in fucosylation of bi-antennary glycans of sites 2 and 4, and of tri-antennary glycans of all sites were observed in PC, compared to in normal volunteers and chronic pancreatitis. Therefore, increases in fucosylation seem to be not due to inflammation, but cancer itself. Coculturing of a human hepatoma cell line, Hep3B, with PC cells-induced production of fucosylated haptoglobin, suggesting that PC produces a factor that induces the production of fucosylated haptoglobin. On clinical investigation of 100 cases of colorectal cancer, cases in which it was located near the liver showed a higher positive rate of fucosylated haptoglobin, suggesting that the location of the cancer might also be an important factor for fucosylated haptoglobin if cancer tissues produce such inducible factors. Thus, fucosylated haptoglobin could become a novel tumor marker for PC and complicated mechanisms\n\nFOXP2 gene deletion and infant feeding difficulties: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nZimmerman, Emily; Maron, Jill L\n\n2016-01-01\n\nForkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) is a well-studied gene known to play an essential role in normal speech development. Deletions in the gene have been shown to result in developmental speech disorders and regulatory disruption of downstream gene targets associated with common forms of language impairments. Despite similarities in motor planning and execution between speech development and oral feeding competence, there have been no reports to date linking deletions within the FOXP2 gene to oral feeding impairments in the newborn. The patient was a nondysmorphic, appropriately and symmetrically grown male infant born at 35-wk gestational age. He had a prolonged neonatal intensive care unit stay because of persistent oral feeding incoordination requiring gastrostomy tube placement. Cardiac and neurological imagings were within normal limits. A microarray analysis found an â¼9-kb loss within chromosome band 7q3.1 that contains exon 2 of FOXP2, demonstrating a single copy of this region instead of the normal two copies per diploid gene. This case study expands our current understanding of the role FOXP2 exerts on motor planning and coordination necessary for both oral feeding success and speech-language development. This case report has important consequences for future diagnosis and treatment for infants with FOXP2 deletions, mutations, and varying levels of gene expression.\n\nDeletion of the \"OPHN1\" Gene Detected by aCGH\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMadrigal, I.; Rodriguez-Revenga, L.; Badenas, C.; Sanchez, A.; Mila, M.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground: The oligophrenin 1 gene (\"OPHN1\") is an Rho-GTPase-activating protein involved in the regulation of the G-protein cycle required for dendritic spine morphogenesis.

The glutathione S-transferases form the major detoxifying group of enzymes responsible for eliminating products of oxidative stress. We have therefore proposed GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes as candidates for studying the genetics of osteoporosis. The aim of the present study was to examine possible association of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletion polymorphisms, alone or in combination, with bone mineral density at femoral neck (BMD_fn), lumbar spine (BMD_ls) and total hip (BMD_th) in Slovenian elderly women and men.GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletion polymorphisms in 712 elderly people were analyzed using the triplex PCR method for the presence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene segments. BMD_fn, BMD_ls and BMD_th were measured by the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) method. Results were analyzed using univariate statistic model adjusted for sex, body mass index (BMI) and age. Our results showed the significant differences in BMD_th, BMD_ls and BMD_fn values (p=0.031, 0.017 and 0.023, respectively) in subgroups of GSTT1 gene deletion polymorphism. For GSTM1 gene deletion polymorphism borderline significant association was found with BMD_ls (p=0.100). Furthermore, subjects with homozygous deletion of GSTT1 gene showed higher BMD values on all measured skeletal sites and, in contrast, subjects with homozygous deletion of GSTM1 gene showed lower BMD values. Moreover, a gene-gene interaction study showed significant association of GSTM1-null and GSTT1-null polymorphisms with BMD_ls values (p=0.044). Carriers with a combination of the presence of GSTT1 gene and the homozygous absence of GSTM1 gene fragment were associated with the lower BMD values at all skeletal sites. The significant association of combination of GSTT1 gene presence and homozygous absence of GSTM1 gene with BMD was demonstrated, suggesting that it could be used, if validated in other studies, as genetic marker for low BMD.\n\n[Deletion of two genes from the genome of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Genetic manipulation and phenotype study].\n\nPubMed\n\nPetrescu, Elena; Voicu, Pia-Maneula; PoiÅ£elea, M; Stoica, B; StÄnescu, Raluca; Rusu, M\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to delete two genes from the genome of the fission yeast S. pombe in order to search for their functions in the cell. These genes are SPAC869.02c (MRI) and SPBC21C3.19 (MR2) and previous studies reported their significant induction after gamma irradiation. We carried out the deletions of the two genes and we replaced them with the selection marker ura4. Among the phenotype characteristics we tested the viability, the sexual behaviour and the radiosensitivity to ultraviolet and gamma irradiation. Our results indicate that MR1-deleted strain is sensitive to both UV and gamma irradiation, while the survival of the irradiated MR2-deleted strain doesn't appear to be influenced by the deletion. This suggests an involvement of MR1 gene in the adaptive response triggered by these types of genotoxic aggression. The comparison of MR1-d and MR2-d with the double deleted strains containing the deletion of MR1 or MR2 combined with the deletion of sty1 or rad3 genes led to a surprising result: the double mutants MR1-d sty1-d and MR1-d rad3-d were more resistant to both UV and gamma irradiation than the simple deleted strains sty1-d and rad3-d, respectively. This suggests a possible contribution of MR1 gene to the lethal process taking place in irradiated cells.\n\nSeven gene deletions in seven days: Fast generation of Escherichia coli strains tolerant to acetate and osmotic stress\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJensen, Sheila I.; Lennen, Rebecca M.; HerrgÃ¥rd, Markus J.; Nielsen, Alex T.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nGeneration of multiple genomic alterations is currently a time consuming process. Here, a method was established that enables highly efficient and simultaneous deletion of multiple genes in Escherichia coli. A temperature sensitive plasmid containing arabinose inducible lambda Red recombineering genes and a rhamnose inducible flippase recombinase was constructed to facilitate fast marker-free deletions. To further speed up the procedure, we integrated the arabinose inducible lambda Red recombineering genes and the rhamnose inducible FLP into the genome of E. coli K-12âMG1655. This system enables growth at 37âÂ°C, thereby facilitating removal of integrated antibiotic cassettes and deletion of additional genes in the same day. Phosphorothioated primers were demonstrated to enable simultaneous deletions during one round of electroporation. Utilizing these methods, we constructed strains in which four to seven genes were deleted in E. coli W and E. coli K-12. The growth rate of an E. coli K-12 quintuple deletion strain was significantly improved in the presence of high concentrations of acetate and NaCl. In conclusion, we have generated a method that enables efficient and simultaneous deletion of multiple genes in several E. coli variants. The method enables deletion of up to seven genes in as little as seven days.

The potential of this microorganism as a platform cell factory for isoprenoid production has been recognized because of high flux through its native terpene pathway. Recently, we developed a multiple gene expression system in X. dendrorhous and enhanced the mevalonate synthetic pathway to increase astaxanthin production. In contrast, the mevalonate synthetic pathway is suppressed by ergosterol through feedback inhibition. Therefore, releasing the mevalonate synthetic pathway from this inhibition through the deletion of genes involved in ergosterol synthesis is a promising strategy to improve isoprenoid production. An efficient method for deleting diploid genes in X. dendrorhous, however, has not yet been developed. Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous was cultivated under gradually increasing concentrations of antibiotics following the introduction of antibiotic resistant genes to be replaced with target genes. Using this method, double CYP61 genes encoding C-22 sterol desaturases relating to ergosterol biosynthesis were deleted sequentially. This double CYP61 deleted strain showed decreased ergosterol biosynthesis compared with the parental strain and single CYP61 disrupted strain. Additionally, this double deletion of CYP61 genes showed increased astaxanthin production compared with the parental strain and the single CYP61 knockout strain. Finally, astaxanthin production was enhanced by 1.4-fold compared with the parental strain, although astaxanthin production was not affected in the single CYP61 knockout strain. In this study, we developed a system to completely delete targetÂ diploid genes in X. dendrorhous. Using this method, we deleted diploid CYP61 genes involved in the synthesis of ergosterol that inhibits the pathway for mevalonate, which is a common\n\nA novel large deletion mutation of FERMT1 gene in a Chinese patient with Kindler syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Ying; Bai, Jin-li; Liu, Xiao-yan; Qu, Yu-jin; Cao, Yan-yan; Wang, Jian-cai; Jin, Yu-wei; Wang, Hong; Song, Fang\n\n2015-11-01\n\nKindler syndrome (KS; OMIM 173650) is a rare autosomal recessive skin disorder, which results in symptoms including blistering, epidermal atrophy, increased risk of cancer, and poor wound healing. The majority of mutations of the disease-determining gene (FERMT1 gene) are single nucleotide substitutions, including missense mutations, nonsense mutations, etc. Large deletion mutations are seldom reported. To determine the mutation in the FERMT1 gene associated with a 7-year-old Chinese patient who presented clinical manifestation of KS, we performed direct sequencing of all the exons of FERMT1 gene. For the exons 2-6 without amplicons, we analyzed the copy numbers using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with specific primers. The deletion breakpoints were sublocalized and the range of deletion was confirmed by PCR and direct sequencing. In this study, we identified a new 17-kb deletion mutation spanning the introns 1-6 of FERMT1 gene in a Chinese patient with severe KS phenotypes. Her parents were carriers of the same mutation. Our study reported a newly identified large deletion mutation of FERMT1 gene involved in KS, which further enriched the mutation spectrum of the FERMT1 gene.\n\nPurification of a protein from serum of cattle with hepatic lipidosis, and identification of the protein as haptoglobin.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshino, K; Katoh, N; Takahashi, K; Yuasa, A\n\n1992-06-01\n\nA protein that has 2 subunits with molecular weight of 35,000 and 23,000 was detected in serum of cattle with hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver). The protein was purified from serum obtained from a cow with fatty liver, and was identified as haptoglobin, which is known to have hemoglobin-binding capacity and to be an acute-phase protein. To assess the relevance of haptoglobin in fatty liver, cattle were classified in 3 groups (healthy control, haptoglobin-positive, and haptoglobin-negative); liver triglyceride content and several serum biochemical variables were evaluated for the 3 groups. Compared with the control and haptoglobin-negative cattle, haptoglobin-positive cattle had significantly (P less than 0.01) higher liver triglyceride content, serum bilirubin concentration, and aspartate transaminase activity. Serum haptoglobin concentration was high in slaughter cattle (27 of 40 cattle tested), particularly in cows (20/28).\n\nThe frequency of previously undetectable deletions involving 3' Exons of the PMS2 gene.\n\nPubMed\n\nVaughn, Cecily P; Baker, Christine L; Samowitz, Wade S; Swensen, Jeffrey J\n\n2013-01-01\n\nLynch syndrome is characterized by mutations in one of four mismatch repair genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2. Clinical mutation analysis of these genes includes sequencing of exonic regions and deletion/duplication analysis. However, detection of deletions and duplications in PMS2 has previously been confined to Exons 1-11 due to gene conversion between PMS2 and the pseudogene PMS2CL in the remaining 3' exons (Exons 12-15). We have recently described an MLPA-based method that permits detection of deletions of PMS2 Exons 12-15; however, the frequency of such deletions has not yet been determined. To address this question, we tested for 3' deletions in 58 samples that were reported to be negative for PMS2 mutations using previously available methods. All samples were from individuals whose tumors exhibited loss of PMS2 immunohistochemical staining without concomitant loss of MLH1 immunostaining. We identified seven samples in this cohort with deletions in the 3' region of PMS2, including three previously reported samples with deletions of Exons 13-15 (two samples) and Exons 14-15. Also detected were deletions of Exons 12-15, Exon 13, and Exon 14 (two samples). Breakpoint analysis of the intragenic deletions suggests they occurred through Alu-mediated recombination. Our results indicate that â¼12% of samples suspected of harboring a PMS2 mutation based on immunohistochemical staining, for which mutations have not yet been identified, would benefit from testing using the new methodology.

To increase the production of pestalotiollide B, we attempted to eliminate competing polyketide products by deleting the genes responsible for their biosynthesis. We successfully deleted 41 out of 48 putative polyketide synthases (PKSs) in the genome of NK17. Nine of the 41 PKS deleted strains had significant increased production of pestalotiollide B (PÂ <Â 0.05). For instance, deletion of pks35, led to an increase of pestalotiollide B by 887%. We inferred that these nine PKSs possibly lead to branch pathways that compete for precursors with pestalotiollide B, or that convert the product. Deletion of some other PKS genes such as pks8 led to a significant decrease of pestalotiollide B, suggesting they are responsible for its biosynthesis. Our data demonstrated that improvement of pestalotiollide B production can be achieved by eliminating competing polyketides.\n\nHaptoglobin Phenotype Modifies Serum Iron Levels and the Effect of Smoking on Parkinson Disease Risk\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCosta-Mallen, Paola; Zabetian, Cyrus P.; Agarwal, Pinky; Hu, Shu-Ching; Yearout, Dora; Samii, Ali; Leverenz, James B.; Roberts, John W.; Checkoway, Harvey\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIntroduction Haptoglobin is a hemoglobin-binding protein that exists in three functionally different phenotypes, and haptoglobin phenotype 2-1 has previously been associated with Parkinson disease (PD) risk, with mechanisms not elucidated. Some evidence is emerging that low levels of serum iron may increase PD risk. In this study we investigated whether PD patients have lower serum iron and ferritin than controls, and whether this is dependent on haptoglobin phenotype. We also investigated the effect of Hp phenotype as a modifier of the effect of smoking on PD risk. Methods The study population consisted of 128 PD patients and 226 controls. Serum iron, ferritin, and haptoglobin phenotype were determined, and compared between PD cases and controls. Stratified analysis by haptoglobin phenotype was performed to determine effect of haptoglobin phenotype on serum iron parameter differences between PD cases and controls and to investigate its role in the protective effect of smoking on PD risk. Results PD cases had lower serum iron than controls (83.28 ug/100ml vs 94.00 ug/100 ml, p 0.006), and in particular among subjects with phenotype 2-1. The protective effect of smoking on PD risk resulted stronger in subjects with phenotype 1-1 and 2-2, and weakest among subjects with phenotype 2-1. Ferritin levels were higher in PD cases than controls among subjects of White ethnicity. Conclusions Our results report for the first time that the haptoglobin phenotype may be a contributor of iron levels abnormalities in PD patients. The mechanisms for these haptoglobin-phenotype specific effects will have to be further elucidated.

The most common mutations in western populations are deletions that are spread non-randomly throughout the gene. Molecular analysis of the dystrophin gene structure by hybridization of the full length cDNA to Southern blots and by PCR in 62 unrelated Israeli male DMD/BMD patients showed deletions in 23 (37%). This proportion is significantly lower than that found in European and North American populations (55-65%). Seventy-eight percent of the deletions were confined to exons 44-52, half of these exons 44-45, and themoreÂ Â» remaining 22% to exons 1 and 19. There was no correlation between the size of the deletion and the severity of the disease. All the deletions causing frameshift resulted in the DMD phenotypes. 43 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.Â«Â less\n\nAssessment of the Toxicity of CuO Nanoparticles by Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mutants with Multiple Genes Deleted\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBao, Shaopan; Lu, Qicong; Dai, Heping; Zhang, Chao\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo develop applicable and susceptible models to evaluate the toxicity of nanoparticles, the antimicrobial effects of CuO nanoparticles (CuO-NPs) on various Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) strains (wild type, single-gene-deleted mutants, and multiple-gene-deleted mutants) were determined and compared. Further experiments were also conducted to analyze the mechanisms associated with toxicity using copper salt, bulk CuO (bCuO), carbon-shelled copper nanoparticles (C/Cu-NPs), and carbon nanoparticles (C-NPs) for comparisons. The results indicated that the growth inhibition rates of CuO-NPs for the wild-type and the single-gene-deleted strains were comparable, while for the multiple-gene deletion mutant, significantly higher toxicity was observed (P < 0.05). When the toxicity of the CuO-NPs to yeast cells was compared with the toxicities of copper salt and bCuO, we concluded that the toxicity of CuO-NPs should be attributed to soluble copper rather than to the nanoparticles. The striking difference in adverse effects of C-NPs and C/Cu-NPs with equivalent surface areas also proved this. A toxicity assay revealed that the multiple-gene-deleted mutant was significantly more sensitive to CuO-NPs than the wild type. Specifically, compared with the wild-type strain, copper was readily taken up by mutant strains when cell permeability genes were knocked out, and the mutants with deletions of genes regulated under oxidative stress (OS) were likely producing more reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hence, as mechanism-based gene inactivation could increase the susceptibility of yeast, the multiple-gene-deleted mutants should be improved model organisms to investigate the toxicity of nanoparticles.

Dot blot analysis showed its mRNA to be gene is first detectable at 18 h p.i. and reaching the highest transcriptional level at 48 h p.i. The result suggested that BmvPK-1 gene is a late or very late gene. The most conserved 365 bp of the BmvPK-1 gene was deleted in a transfer vector (pUCPK-lac), and a report gene (lacZ) was inserted in the deleted position. Cotransfection of BmN cells with pUCPK-lac DNA and BmNPV DNA resulted in the recombinant virus which expressed detectable product of lacZ gene. But the virus with the deleted BmvPK-1 gene could not be isolated from the wild BmNPV by plaque purification method. The result showed that the BmvPK-1 gene deleted virus can multiply only with the help of the product of this gene from the wild type virus, and the gene is necessary for the virus to finish its life cycle in the cultured cells.\n\nFirst report of a deletion encompassing an entire exon in the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase gene causing alkaptonuria.\n\nPubMed\n\nZouheir Habbal, Mohammad; Bou-Assi, Tarek; Zhu, Jun; Owen, Renius; Chehab, Farid F\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAlkaptonuria is often diagnosed clinically with episodes of dark urine, biochemically by the accumulation of peripheral homogentisic acid and molecularly by the presence of mutations in the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase gene (HGD). Alkaptonuria is invariably associated with HGD mutations, which consist of single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions. Surprisingly, the presence of deletions beyond a few nucleotides among over 150 reported deleterious mutations has not been described, raising the suspicion that this gene might be protected against the detrimental mechanisms of gene rearrangements. The quest for an HGD mutation in a proband with AKU revealed with a SNP array five large regions of homozygosity (5-16 Mb), one of which includes the HGD gene. A homozygous deletion of 649 bp deletion that encompasses the 72 nucleotides of exon 2 and surrounding DNA sequences in flanking introns of the HGD gene was unveiled in a proband with AKU. The nature of this deletion suggests that this in-frame deletion could generate a protein without exon 2. Thus, we modeled the tertiary structure of the mutant protein structure to determine the effect of exon 2 deletion. While the two Î²-pleated sheets encoded by exon 2 were missing in the mutant structure, other Î²-pleated sheets are largely unaffected by the deletion. However, nine novel Î±-helical coils substituted the eight coils present in the native HGD crystal structure. Thus, this deletion results in a deleterious enzyme, which is consistent with the proband's phenotype. Screening for mutations in the HGD gene, particularly in the Middle East, ought to include this exon 2 deletion in order to determine its frequency and uncover its origin.\n\nFirst Report of a Deletion Encompassing an Entire Exon in the Homogentisate 1,2-Dioxygenase Gene Causing Alkaptonuria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHabbal, Mohammad Zouheir; Bou-Assi, Tarek; Zhu, Jun; Owen, Renius; Chehab, Farid F.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAlkaptonuria is often diagnosed clinically with episodes of dark urine, biochemically by the accumulation of peripheral homogentisic acid and molecularly by the presence of mutations in the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase gene (HGD).

Surprisingly, the presence of deletions beyond a few nucleotides among over 150 reported deleterious mutations has not been described, raising the suspicion that this gene might be protected against the detrimental mechanisms of gene rearrangements. The quest for an HGD mutation in a proband with AKU revealed with a SNP array five large regions of homozygosity (5â16 Mb), one of which includes the HGD gene. A homozygous deletion of 649 bp deletion that encompasses the 72 nucleotides of exon 2 and surrounding DNA sequences in flanking introns of the HGD gene was unveiled in a proband with AKU. The nature of this deletion suggests that this in-frame deletion could generate a protein without exon 2. Thus, we modeled the tertiary structure of the mutant protein structure to determine the effect of exon 2 deletion. While the two Î²-pleated sheets encoded by exon 2 were missing in the mutant structure, other Î²-pleated sheets are largely unaffected by the deletion. However, nine novel Î±-helical coils substituted the eight coils present in the native HGD crystal structure. Thus, this deletion results in a deleterious enzyme, which is consistent with the probandâs phenotype. Screening for mutations in the HGD gene, particularly in the Middle East, ought to include this exon 2 deletion in order to determine its frequency and uncover its origin.

Mutations in the WAS protein (WASP) gene are responsible for WAS. To date, WASP mutations, including missense/nonsense, splicing, small deletions, small insertions, gross deletions, and gross insertions have been identified in patients with WAS. In addition, WASPâinteracting proteins are suspected in patients with clinical features of WAS, in whom the WASP gene sequence and mRNA levels are normal. The present study aimed to investigate the application of next generation sequencing in definitive diagnosis and clinical therapy for WAS. A 5 monthâold child with WAS who displayed symptoms of thrombocytopenia was examined. Whole exome sequence analysis of genomic DNA showed that the coverage and depth of WASP were extremely low. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated total WASP gene deletion in the proband. In conclusion, high throughput sequencing is useful for the verification of WAS on the genetic profile, and has implications for family planning guidance and establishment of clinical programs.\n\nContiguous gene deletion of chromosome 2p16.3-p21 as a cause of Lynch syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalo-Mullen, Erin E; Lynn, Patricio B; Wang, Lu; Walsh, Michael; Gopalan, Anuradha; Shia, Jinru; Tran, Christina; Man, Fung Ying; McBride, Sean; Schattner, Mark; Zhang, Liying; Weiser, Martin R; Stadler, Zsofia K\n\n2018-01-01\n\nLynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Although commonly associated with clinical features such as intellectual disability and congenital anomalies, contiguous gene deletions may also result in cancer predisposition syndromes. We report on a 52-year-old male with Lynch syndrome caused by deletion of chromosome 2p16.3-p21. The patient had intellectual disability and presented with a prostatic adenocarcinoma with an incidentally identified synchronous sigmoid adenocarcinoma that exhibited deficient MMR with an absence of MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression. Family history was unrevealing. Physical exam revealed short stature, brachycephaly with a narrow forehead and short philtrum, brachydactyly of the hands, palmar transverse crease, broad and small feet with hyperpigmentation of the soles. The patient underwent total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis for a pT3N1 sigmoid adenocarcinoma. Germline genetic testing of the MSH2, MSH6, and EPCAM genes revealed full gene deletions. SNP-array based DNA copy number analysis identified a deletion of 4.8Â Mb at 2p16.3-p21. In addition to the three Lynch syndrome associated genes, the deleted chromosomal section encompassed genes including NRXN1, CRIPT, CALM2, FBXO11, LHCGR, MCFD2, TTC7A, EPAS1, PRKCE, and 15 others. Contiguous gene deletions have been described in other inherited cancer predisposition syndromes, such as Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. Our report and review of the literature suggests that contiguous gene deletion within the 2p16-p21 chromosomal region is a rare cause of Lynch syndrome, but presents with distinct phenotypic features, highlighting the need for recognition and awareness of this syndromic entity.\n\nDeletion "
