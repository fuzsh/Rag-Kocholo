In addition, the child can later adopt Argentine citizenship upon reaching the age of 18.\n\nNaturalization\n\nNaturalization allows a foreign citizen to obtain Argentine citizenship. The procedure is different in each individual case.\n\nWhat is naturalization?\n\nNaturalization is the last step in the process of integration into the Argentine way of life. This gives you the right to vote and run for office.\n\nSince Argentina recognizes dual citizenship, applicants for an Argentine passport do not risk losing their original citizenship, provided the country of origin also allows dual citizenship.\n\nYou can apply for naturalized Argentine citizenship if you have lived in the country for at least two years. You will need to confirm employment and continuous residence, as well as provide other important documents, including your passport and DNI (residence card).\n\nWhat are the basic requirements for obtaining citizenship by naturalization?\n\nApplicants must:\n\nbe over 18 years of age\n\nlive in Argentina for at least 2 years\n\nfile an application for naturalization with a federal judge.\n\nNaturalization may be denied if applicants:\n\nduring the last 5 years were in prisons for more than 3 years\n\nare under criminal prosecution\n\nhave an illegal source of income\n\nworking without legal permission is considered by the majority of the appeals chamber not to be a legitimate source of income.\n\nWhat documents are required to obtain citizenship through naturalization?\n\nMarriage certificate or proof that the applicant has lived continuously for 2 years in Argentina. If the marriage was concluded outside of Argentina, it is necessary to first register the marriage certificate in Argentina\n\nPhotocopy of identification number and/or passport\n\nInformation about criminal records\n\nCertificate of residence\n\nConfirmation of the availability of funds: employment contract, a certificate from the place of work or a receipt for wages\n\nIf there are Argentine children: photocopies of birth certificates and DNM certificate.\n\nCitizenship by marriage\n\nIf you plan to obtain Argentine citizenship through marriage, you will need the following documents to apply:\n\nBoth parties must present identity documents. One party who is a foreigner must present a passport and legal immigration status in the country\n\nIf a person is divorced or widowed, he or she must provide a certified copy of the divorce decree or the death certificate of the deceased spouse. This copy must be certified in the issuing country at the Argentine consulate or by apostille. The certificate of previous marriage and/or divorce decree must be registered in the Argentine civil registry office in a judicial manner\n\nIf a minor (under 18) intends to marry in Argentina, he/she must present a birth certificate legalized in his/her country of issue with an apostille or at an Argentine consulate, identity documents, a marriage license issued by parents or guardian of a minor, or documents proving the identity of the parents by an Argentine court."
