        "text": "Universities in Argentina\n\nNot only is Argentina one of the most popular places to study within Latin America, it’s also one of the fastest-growing centers of university education, with 39 institutions featuring in the QS Latin America University Rankings 2018, This growth, which is largely thanks to the economic boom enjoyed by the country in the early 21st century, has led the following universities to be considered among the continent’s finest.\n\nUniversidad de Buenos Aires\n\nThe nation’s highest-ranked university is the Universidad de Buenos Aires. It’s ranked 75th in the QS World University Rankings 2018 and ninth in the QS Latin America University Rankings 2018.\n\nThe largest university in Argentina, and one of the largest by enrollment in Latin America, the Universidad de Buenos Aires is a public university with 13 departments, 10 museums and six hospitals under its umbrella. Founded in 1821, the institution has also produced four Nobel Prize laureates, more than any other Spanish-speaking university, and counts the famous Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara among its alumni. The school does not have a main campus, but has buildings scattered across the city of Buenos Aires.\n\nNotable subject strengths for the Universidad de Buenos Aires, based on the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2017, include anthropology, art and design, sociology, law and anatomy & physiology. For each of these, the university is ranked within the top 100 in the world.\n\nUniversidad Austral\n\nEstablished in 1979, Universidad Austral is a private, Catholic university currently ranked joint 331st in the world and 24th in Latin America. Its main campus is in Buenos Aires, but the school also has faculties and departments based in Rosario (the faculty of business science) and Pilar (Austral University Hospital, the faculty of biomedical science, IAE Business School and Parque Austral – a research and development enterprise park for science, technology and business).\n\nPontificia Universidad Católica Argentina Santa María de los Buenos Aires (UCA)\n\nPontificia Universidad Católica Argentina Santa María de los Buenos Aires, otherwise known as Universidad Católica Argentina, or just UCA, is joint 364th in the latest world rankings and 36th in the 2018 Latin American rankings. Established in 1958, the Universidad Católica Argentina is another private, Catholic university, and its chancellor is the Archbishop of Buenos Aires. The school’s main campus is situated in Puerto Madero, one of the most modernized areas of Buenos Aires.\n\nInstituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires (ITBA)\n\nAlso located in Buenos Aires, the Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires is a private university, ranked 551-600 in the world and 60th in Latin America. The school has a current enrollment of almost 2,000 students with a primary focus on business, engineering and information technology.

For the full list of internationally ranked universities in Argentina take a look at the latest QS Latin America University Rankings.\n\nDiscover more top universities in Argentina with the QS Latin America University Rankings\n\nStudent cities in Argentina\n\nBuenos Aires\n\nNicknamed the ‘Paris of South America’, Buenos Aires is the capital city of Argentina and the second-largest metropolitan area in Latin America after the Brazilian city of São Paulo.\n\nThe city is divided into neighborhoods (or barrios) which, while differing largely from one another – some firmly traditional and others overtly modern – all share a strong South American identity. Argentinean color and passion can be seen in the multitude of cafés, restaurants and nightclubs, each more bustling and vibrant than the last.\n\nWhile European architecture is a noticeable feature in the city, the flair of Argentina is evident in its lively streets and on its fast-moving dance floors. Arts and culture are also a big deal in Buenos Aires, and this is undoubtedly one of the best places to study in Argentina – or Latin America – if these are your passion. Boasting palatial history among its numerous plazas, a world-class opera house, numerous theaters and a collection of avant-garde art galleries, the city also makes space for stylish shops and state-of the art museums such as MALBA.\n\nBut students aren’t just coming to soak up the eclectic culture of Buenos Aires because this is also where the majority of leading universities in Argentina are based. Eight internationally ranked universities are located in or near Buenos Aires, including the country’s two highest ranked offerings, the Universidad de Buenos Aires and Universidad Austral. Due to this large rankings presence, the affordability of the city and a number of other factors, Buenos Aires claims a place among the world’s top 100 cities for students in the QS Best Student Cities 2017 index.\n\nRosario\n\nHosting the Universidad Nacional de Rosario is the city of Rosario, approximately three hours’ drive north-west of the capital in the Santa Fe Province. Birthplace of Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara and, of more recent sporting fame, Lionel Messi, Rosario is an important river port which has recently seen much cultural development. Many once-derelict buildings here now function as art galleries, while the people are as friendly and down-to-earth as ever.\n\nOff the beaten track\n\nOther notable towns and cities in Argentina include Salta, San Miguel de Tucuman, Mar del Plata, Mendoza, the central city of Córdoba and Ushuaia, the world’s most southerly city, on the beautiful waterfront of the Beagle Chan.\n\nThis diverse landscape makes the region perfect for international students with a taste for adventure and exploration. Adrenalin junkies can raft, ski, hike and ride, while those looking for slightly slower-paced pleasures might want to take a tour of the country’s renowned vineyards or sun-bathe along the coast.\n\nEquestrian enthusiasts will also be aware that horses and horse-riding are an essential part of the country’s national heritage and identity, making Argentina a popular destination for horse-riding holidays.\n\nExplore other study destinations in Latin America\n\nApplying to universities in Argentina\n\nThere are 40 national universities in Argentina which receive funding from the government and cater to the majority of undergraduate students in the country. There are also around 45 private universities in Argentina, which are often smaller and charge higher fees.\n\nBoth the public and private sectors also have a number of ‘institutes’, which are differentiated from ‘universities’ by their focus on specific subject areas.\n\nThe academic year in Argentina runs from March to November. Foreign students apply directly to the educational institution they have chosen, and must show copies of school certificates. After being offered a place, students then apply for a student visa, usually valid for two years at a time.\n\nVisa information\n\nVisa guidelines vary depending on your nationality, so make sure to check with the Argentinean embassy in your home country for full details and fees. Here are the general rules and steps:\n\nThose undertaking study in Argentina for more than 90 days will require a student visa. Without this, you risk not being able to receive your student transcripts at the end of your stay.\n\nTo gain a student visa, students will enter the country as tourists and upgrade to a student visa once in Argentina. To apply for this, you will need to provide a passport (which must be valid for at least six months beyond the end of your studies), a letter showing proof of enrolment (provided by your university once you arrive), and a visa processing fee of up to US$100.\n\nThe average student visa lasts six months, but if you are studying for longer you will also need to gain a police certificate showing you have no criminal record in Argentina (citizens outside of the MERCOSUR states will need to gain two of these – one from their home country and one upon arrival). A birth certificate may also be needed.\n\nIf you are staying longer than a year for your studies, you will need to leave Argentina before your existing visa expires and then reapply for another when you return after the first visa’s expiration. If you are unable to leave then you must contact the ISA (Study Abroad Argentina) to discuss an alternative arrangement. It will be up to you to ensure that you complete this process legally.\n\nIt is also often advised that you carry a copy of your passport identification page and visa page with you at all times when in Argentina.\n\nLanguages in Argentina\n\nKnowledge of Spanish is essential for undertaking study in Argentina. Although English is recognized as a business language, Spanish is the language of day-to-day life and the language all university courses are conducted in.\n\nThere is also a growing trend of foreigners coming to Argentina specifically to gain a Certificate of Spanish Language and Use (CELU), accredited by the Department of Education and the Foreign Affairs Department, which confirms the holder’s proficiency in the language. The exam is held twice a year at certain universities.\n\nLiving costs in Argentina\n\nArgentina offers both affordable higher education and relatively low living costs – particularly when compared to the majority of North American and European study destinations.\n\nFees are higher at private universities in Argentina and vary widely between courses, but are still relatively low. These costs can range from ARS8,000 to 24,000 (US$1,000-$3,000) a year and, combining fees with living expenses, students can expect to spend somewhere in the region of ARS15,700-31,700 (US$2,000-$4,000) each year.\n\nForeign students are allowed to work alongside their studies, provided they satisfy all the legal requirements, which are to obtain a work permit and be granted legal residence in the country.\n\nSee the latest QS Latin America University Rankings"
