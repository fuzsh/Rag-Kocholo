        "text": "Richard Blanco’s injury time header has salvaged a 3-3 draw for Chilean club O’Higgins against Cerro Porteno in the Copa Sudamericana.\n\nHaving only gone behind five minutes earlier, O’Higgins pulled off a last-gasp comeback when Blanco made a late run to the back post to head the ball into the net and earn a draw in the first stage first leg.\n\nBlanco had given the home side the lead in the 11th minute on Thursday when the Cerro Porteno defence failed to deal with a cross and the 30-year-old striker slotted the ball past the visiting goalkeeper.\n\nBut the Paraguayan visitors drew level 14 minutes later when Carlos Bonet smashed a loose ball home from the top of the penalty area.\n\nCerro Porteno went ahead in the 72nd minute when Jonathan Fabbro controlled Fidencio Oviedo’s cross on his chest and volleyed into the bottom corner.\n\nA brilliant curling free-kick from O’Higgins midfielder Ramon Fernandez made it 2-2 with 11 minutes to play but Cerro Porteno looked to have stolen the victory when Walter Lopez scored in the 87th minute.\n\nHowever, Blanco had time to score his second goal of the game and ensure that the scores remain level before the return leg in Asuncion, Paraguay on August 8.\n\nElsewhere, Bolivia’s Oriente Petrolero won 1-0 away to Guarani of Paraguay thanks to Danilo Carando’s 53rd-minute goal.\n\nBolivian side Aurora were 2-1 victors at home to Cerro Largo as the hosts had Ronald Rodriguez and Vladimir Castellon on the scoresheet against the Uruguayans."
