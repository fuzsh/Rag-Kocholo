        "text": "Olimpia vs Flamengo\n\nEstadio Defensores del Chaco\n\n28/03/2012, 22.00\n\nRonaldinho has come to town with his Flamengo team looking for revenge against Olimpia who ‘did a Liverpool’ two week’s ago in Rio de Janeiro. Whenever Olimpia or Cerro Porteño play a big Copa Libertadores game the whole country shifts its attentions from the major topics (currently the invasion of bats and cold weather) and focuses on football. At the garage, in the bank, even in the police station all the talk today has been about tonight’s match and whether this current Olimpia side really is as good as those vintage crops of 1979, 1990 and 2002. A win would be the best way to prove it.\n\nGerardo Pelusso makes just one change from the Rio de Janeiro starting XI, Pablo Zeballos is in hot scoring form (three in three) so he replaces Maxi Biancucchi in a 4-4-2. Olimpia’s defence struggled against the dribbiling ability of Wagner Love last time round but Gerardo Pelusso indicated he won’t try and kind of man marking on him or the other offensive bright lights. As anybody who has watched El Decano this season will know their best quality is their spirit, this group of players refuse to be beaten whatever the circumstances and have showed it time and again in 2012. In fact they’ve only tasted defeat once (against Emelec) in the last 19 competitive matches.\n\nFlamengo will be an intriguing prospect, Joel Santana is naturally an attack-minded coach but he might be more cautious having felt the full force of Olimpia’s firepower in those crazy fifteen minutes two weeks ago. The group is very tight too, a home win would see Flamengo relegated into third place with another away game to come next week against Emelec. The key will be to get the ball to Ronaldinho or Wagner Love as much as possible if they are to do some damage, there is no doubt the quality of that pair is too much for the Paraguayan champions to contain, therefore Olimpia will be most concerned about cutting the supply to these world class stars. Their efficacy in that task will decide the result\n\nOlimpia XI (confirmed): M.Silva; F.Najera, A.Romero, E.Meza, S.Ariosa; E.Aranda, S.Orteman, F.Caballero, V.Marín; P.Zeballos, L.Caballero\n\nPrediction: You must be joking after last time!\n\nSELECTED ODDS: Olimpia win 2.6, Draw 3.35, Flamengo win 3.05; 1-0 scoreline 9.0, 3-3 scoreline 80.0, Over 2.5 goals 2.1\n\nBEST BET: Don’t write off Olimpia, a small bet on them outright is what I’ll be doing\n\n===================================================\n\nSTATS & TRIVIA\n\nOlimpia last 6 vs Flamengo\n\nPld 6 W 2 D 2 L 2 GF 9 GA 8 – this includes three Copa Mercosur games (the forerunner to Copa Sudamericana)\n\nOlimpia last 6 vs Brazilian sides in Copa LibertadoresPld 6 W 1 D 3 L 2 GF 13 GA 8 – includes 2002 final 2nd leg against São Caetano\n\nOlimpia go into the game having only lost once in the last 19 outings in all competitions.\n\n==================================================\n\nBy Ralph Hannah\n\nAuthor’s Note: All odds up to date at the time of writing, vía Betfair\n\nFlamengo vs Olimpia\n\nEstadio Joao Havelange\n\n(1-0) 3-3 – Dario Botinelli 38′, Ronaldinho (pen) 59′, Luiz Antonio 64′; Pablo Zeballos 75′, Luis Caballero 84′, Vladimir Marín 89′\n\nA night for Olimpia fans to savour in Rio de Janeiro as once again a team in red and black raced to a 3-0 lead only to see it clawed back by the weaker side on paper but with more steel, determination or in local vernacular garra. Ronaldinho began with his ponytail wagging imperiously about as he played ‘no-look’ passes and by the hour mark he was winning plaudits for his game-winning performance. That Flamengo didn’t win this game was thanks to an extraordinary comeback by Olimpia in the final fifteen minutes led by substitute Pablo Zeballos which earned El Decano a valuable point in this ultra-competitive group.\n\nThe Paraguayan champions were the better side in the first 20 minutes, rather than sitting back and countering they looked to keep possession and try and build play in and around the Brazilian’s box. Captain Sergio Orteman should have put them ahead on 13 minutes but his crashing header was denied by an amazing save on the line from Paulo Victor. Other than that chance Olimpia had a problem creating clear chances, they seemed to be short of ideas once they got into the final third. Flamengo nearly made them pay on 16 minutes, a swift move down the right and Wagner Love had the ball poked off his toes by a vital Adrian Romero interception.\n\nFlamengo started to grow into the game before half time and Ronaldinho and Love began winning fouls and the referee found himself reaching for his yellow card three times in three minutes as Fabio Caballero, Eduardo Aranda and Orteman were booked. That might explain why, on 38 minutes, the Paraguayans backed off Love as he went on an intricate and incisive run close to the penalty area before slipping the ball to Argentine Dario Botinelli, the ex-San Lorenzo man chipped Martin Silva to put his side in front. Love would have the ball in the net before half time, with Ronaldinho playing the pass but was correctly ruled offside, it was a sign of things to come.\n\nThe first half an hour of the second half was catastrophic for Paraguay’s most successful club, less than a minute into the half and Silva had to make a jawdropping save to deny Ronaldinho. Olimpia were breaking quickly when they won the ball but by the time it got into Luis Caballero (nearly always with his back to goal) or Maxi Biancucchi, things slowed down and they seemed indecisive. Ronaldinho was purring at the other end, a ‘no look’ pass to Junior Cesar nearly brought a goal then minutes later Love turned Silva only to be tripped by the Uruguayan. Ronaldinho was made to wait, as Silva was being attacked by a laser pen from the crowd, but it was worth it – not for his emphatic finish but the ‘Kong’ dance afterwards, perfectly choreographed. It was game over at that point, Olimipa’s stamina was lacking as they took longer to reorganise after losing the ball, Friday’s game played with nine men clearly taking its toll. On 64 minutes Luiz Antonio put the final nail in the coffin with a cool finish following a breathtaking pass from Ronaldinho, cue more dancing.\n\nOsvaldo Hobecker came on for a shattered Orteman in what was a defensive move but stimulated a resurgence within the away team that started with another substitute Pablo Zeballos. The striker has been struggling for fitness and been out of favour of late but made a case for his reinstatement in the starting lineup with a free kick that rocketed into the top corner. Even that seemed little more than a consolation but with six minutes to go Luis Nery Caballero continued his hot streak, a precise left foot shot from the edge of the box was his fourth in as many games. Fla then got a warning of what was to come, Vladimir Marín’s free kick found Enrique Meza and his header was well saved by the excellent Victor. But then with just a minute left on the clock Olimpia found their equaliser, good work by Zeballos found Biancucchi and the little Argentine dragged in players before released Marín on the left who drilled the ball home. “Que grande sos, Olimpia!” screamed Bruno Pont on Paraguayan radio and there can be no denying this was a huge result.\n\nAs Olimpia celebrated, Ronaldinho and co looked bewildered as if their party had been gatecrashed by ‘Bigger Boys’ who bullied their way back into a match and showed a tremendous desire not to lose under any cirumstances. The return game in Asunción is going to be unmissable.\n\nOlimpia XI: M.Silva; F.Najera, A.Romero, E.Meza, S.Ariosa; E.Aranda, S.Orteman, F.Caballero, V.Marín; M.Biancucchi, L.Caballero\n\nSubs: Pablo Zeballos for Eduardo Aranda, Osvaldo Hobecker for Sergio Orteman, Salustiano Candia for Luis Caballero\n\nFlamengo vs Olimpia\n\nEstadio Joao Havelange\n\n15/03/2012, 22.00\n\nThe Paraguayan champions and only local side with an unbeaten league record renew their long-standing rivalry with Brazilian giants Flamengo in Rio de Janeiro tonight. Even with injuries to key players Flamengo must be favourites going into this but Olimpia have proved recently they have tremendous team spirit and morale couldn’t be higher after holding on to beat rivals Libertad on Friday with just nine men. The sides last met in 2002 in the group stages and maybe ominously Olimpia went on to win the title that year.\n\nGerardo Pelusso has set up with his usual side, a narrow 4-4-2 with Pablo Zeballos consigned to the bench owing to the good form of Luis Caballero (scored in 3 consecutive games) and Maxi Biancucchi’s pace which will suit the them on the counter attack. Olimpia’s defence was huge against Libertad and with Adrián Romero back in for Salustiano Candia they are on paper even stronger as they try and keep out Ronaldinho and Wagner Love. As ever the performance of Olimpia will be directly related to that of their captain, Sergio Orteman, the two-time winner of the competition has seen this all before and was part of the side that battled to a 0-0 draw in Rio de Janeiro against Fla ten years ago. The most likely source of an Olimpia goal will be Orteman recuperating the ball quickly to launch a counter attack and release either Biancucchi or Caballero with a trademark pinpoint through ball.\n\nFlamengo come off the back of a big victory in the Fla-Flu derby which has buoyed the side and handed Joel Santana’s side their third straight victory. A win for Flamengo would open up a three point gap over Lanús and they have been solid defensively at home conceding just twice in six games so far. One potential weakness could be Paulo Victor the substitute goalkeeper but that is unlikely after his derby day display where he excelled. With that in mind I see this being a tight game with Flamengo just edging it.\n\nOlimpia XI (confirmed): M.Silva; F.Najera, A.Romero, E.Meza, S.Ariosa; E.Aranda, S.Orteman, F.Caballero, V.Marín; M.Biancucchi, L.Caballero\n\nPrediction: 1-0\n\nSELECTED ODDS: Flamengo win 1.6, Draw 4.1, Olimpia win 7.0; 1-0 scoreline 6.8, 1-1 scoreline 8.8, Under 2.5 goals 1.9\n\nBEST BET: I can’t see Olimpia getting beaten out of sight, they are too good for that so I think backing a low scoring game or even 0-0, 1-0, 1-1 with small stakes is the best option. Bear in mind there has only been 1.75 goals per game in the four Copa Libertadores matches involving theses sides so far.\n\n===================================================\n\nSTATS & TRIVIA\n\nOlimpia last 5 vs Flamengo – see some video footage here\n\nPld 5 W 2 D 1 L 2 GF 6 GA 5 – this includes three Copa Mercosur games (the forerunner to Copa Sudamericana)\n\nOlimpia last 5 vs Brazilian sides in Copa Libertadores\n\nPld 5 W 1 D 2 L 2 GF 10 GA 5 – includes 2002 final 2nd leg against São Caetano\n\nOlimpia go into the game having only lost once in the last 16 outings in all competitions.\n\nOlimpia coach Gerardo Pelusso beat Flamengo in Rio de Janeiro, during the 2010 Copa Libertadores quarter final with Universidad de Chile.\n\n==================================================\n\nFULL SQUAD LIST:\n\nGK: Martín Andrés Silva, Víctor Hugo Centurión\n\nDEF: Francisco Nájera, Adrián Marcelo Romero, Enrique Meza, Sebastián Ariosa, Salustiano Candia, , Renzo Revoredo\n\nMID: Eduardo Aranda, Fabio Caballero, Sergio Orteman, Vladimir Marín, Carlos Humberto Paredes, Osvaldo Hobecker\n\nATT: Maxi Biancucchi. Luis Caballero, Alberto Contrera, Pablo Zeballos, Arnaldo Castorino\n\n==================================================\n\nBy Ralph Hannah\n\nAuthor’s Note: All odds up to date at the time of writing, vía Betfair\n\nBelow my thoughts on each team’s chances this season and all the transfer ins and outs. Best to get a cup of tea before starting this one!\n\nCerro Porteño\n\nThe pressure on the azulgrana to win the Apertura title is enormous in this, their centenary year. With major rivals Libertad and Olimpia likely to be occupied with the Copa Libertadores the Barrio Obrero club should be able to capitalize. The midfield has seen the incorporation of Fidencio Oviedo and the problem left back position is set to be filled by Uruguayan Walter Lopez . The longest summer saga was that of ‘SaSa’ (Santiago Salcedo) but in the end he hasn’t rejoined El Ciclón despite being very close to re-signing.\n\nIns: Fidencio Oviedo (Independiente), Diego Godoy (returned from loan), Pablo Noguera (returned from loan), Walter Lopez (Peñarol)\n\nOuts: Digno Gonzalez (Atletico Huila), Nelson Cuevas (Luque), Fredy Bareiro (Estudiantes Tecos), Javier Villarreal (Nacional), Luis Nuñez (Deportivo Cúcuta), Juan Maldonado (Sol de América)\n\nPrediction: Champions\n\nOlimpia\n\nThe defending champions have seen some movement in the squad but crucially coach Gerardo Pelusso remains as does top scorer Pablo Zeballos, having been linked with most of Europe. El Decano have been excellent in pre-season but ultimately the league will be a distraction as club president Marcelo Recanate is interested in the prize money from Copa Libertadores progression. It will be interested to see how the shift to three at the back will affect the side in the early games.\n\nIns: Arnaldo Castorino (3 de Febrero), Osvaldo Hobecker (Rubio Ñu), Salustiano Candía (Colón de Santa Fe)\n\nOuts: Edgar Robles (Luque), Jamell Ramos (Once Caldas), Diego Benitez (Carapeguá), Blas Hermosilla (Independiente CG), Matías Donnet (Unión de Santa Fe)\n\nPrediction: 3rd\n\nGuaraní\n\nDespite plenty of interest in talented young striker Federico Santander and Dante López the aurinegro have kept most of their squad together and have a great blend of experience and youthful talent. Last year they seemed to suffer the loss of Jony Fabbro and then from an unsuitable manager, no excuses on the second count now with Pablo Caballero at the helm having done an excellent job at Independiente last year. The reinforcements all bring quality in key areas.\n\nIns: Edgar Aranda (3 de Febrero), Iván González Ferreira (Atlético Paranaense), Marcelo Palau (Cruz Azul), Luis Cabral (Sol de América), Diego Figueredo (Independiente de CG)\n\nOuts: Joel Benítez (Luque), Miguel Paniagua (Deportivo Cuenca), Jorge Brítez (Luque), David Mendieta (Sol de America), Victor Gómez (released), Pablo Caballero (released), Benigno Ruiz Diaz (Rubio Ñu)\n\nPrediction: Runners-up\n\nLibertad\n\nBrimming with players and money the title would be theirs if it wasn’t for the Copa Libertadores which is likely to distract them. Very much the Manchester City of Paraguay, money no object and have an unbelievable number of players out on loan and incredible talent coming through the reserves. Maurito Caballero is the most talented of the lot, he scored twice on his first start for the senior side, the striker is blessed with pace and a deadly left foot that makes you think Robbie Fowler.\n\nIns: Carlos Martinez Arce (returned from loan), Marcos Melgarejo (Nacional), Hugo Santa Cruz (returned from loan), Nestor Camacho (Newell’s Old Boys), Nery Bareiro (returned from loan), Joe Bizera (Bella Vista), Jonathan Santana (Kayserispor), Rodrigo Muñoz (Nacional, URU)\n\nOuts: Manuel Maciel, Robin Ramirez (Dep. Tolima), Ángel Orué (Nacional), William Mendieta (Sol de America), Ignacio Canuto (Figueirense), Tobias Vargas (Luque), Pedro Portocarrero (Patriotas)\n\nPrediction: Top half with title challenge inversely correlated to Copa Libertadores run\n\nNacional\n\nThe 2011 Apertura champions will enjoy six games in the Copa Libertadores and, like last season, will be sensible enough to give the league due importance as they hope to qualify for a continental tournament next year too. The loss of coach Juan Manuel Battaglia and talented midfielder Marcos Melgarejo is a blow but new boss Javier Torrente is a winner, having picked up titles with Cerro and Libertad previously. Expect them to be as dogged and effective as ever.\n\nIns: Denis Caniza (Irapuato), Germán Cano (Deportivo Pereira), Javier Villarreal (Cerro Porteño), Germán Caffa (La Equidad), Gustavo Cristaldo (Luque) Ángel Orue (Libertad), Sergio Gómez, David Mendoza\n\nOuts: Marcos Melgarejo (Libertad), Arnaldo Vera (Liga de Loja), Fabio Ramos, Roberto Gamarra (Luque), Gustavo Morínigo (FC Absheron)\n\nPrediction: Top half\n\nSportivo Luqueño\n\nNarrowly avoiding relegation last year, the Kure have made wholesale changes bringing in more than a dozen players to try and save them from the drop. They have both the Apertura and Clausura to gather as many points as possible and a good start is vital. Look out for talents Carlos Junior Florenciañez and Marcelo Ferreira promoted from youth squad while veteran César Cáceres Cañete has been in great goalscoring form in pre-season.\n\nIns: César Cáceres Cañete (3 de Febrero), Tobías Vargas (Libertad), Edgar Robles (Olimpia), Pablo Aguilar (Defensa y Justicia), Roberto Gamarra (Nacional), Guido di Vanni (Ferro Carril Oeste) Jorge Brítez (Guaraní), Ronald Huth (Tacuary), Rolando Bogado (Independiente CG), Leonardo Villagra, Juan Gamarra, Joel Benítez (Guaraní), Oscar Giménez (Olimpia), Éver Caballero (Deportes Copiapó), Nelson Cuevas (Cerro Porteño)\n\nOuts: Mario Villasanti (Inti Gas), Celso González Ferreira (Carabobo), Fidel Amado Pérez (Caracas), Wilson Quiñonez (Sportivo Carapeguá), Fredy Coronel (Rubio Ñu), Francisco Esteche (retired), Gustavo Cristaldo (Nacional), Aldo Vera (Independiente CG), Ángel Enciso (Sol de América), Osvaldo Díaz (Independiente CG), Jonathan Philippe (released), Diego Alfonso (released), José Arrúa (released), Jony Cabrera (released), Matías Passarelli (released), Martín Saríc (released), Milton Benítez (Huachipato), Luis Armando Ovelar\n\nPredictions: Mid-table\n\nRubio Ñu\n\nHaving lost loaned players as per usual the club have made key reinforcements to spine of side with Gilberto Velazquez (DEF) and Cesar Llamas (MID) in particular bringing experience and quality. The focus as ever will be on the younger players, the albiverde are bursting with precocious talent watch out for attacking players Bladimiro Ojeda and Francisco Vera. Benfica’s Derlís Gonzalez continues at the club on loan at least until he turns 18.\n\nIns: Gilberto Velázquez (Colo-Colo), César Llamas (3 de Febrero), Carlos Ortiz (3 de Febrero), Josías Cardozo (General Caballero ZC), Oscar Velázquez (Guaraní), Pedro Arce (Libertad), Fredy Coronel (Libertad), Alberto Espínola, Claudio Correa (Luque), José Devaca (Banfield), Benigno Ruiz Diaz (Guaraní)\n\nOuts: Diego Godoy (returned to Cerro Porteño), Fredy Vera (released), Osvaldo Hobecker (Olimpia), Osvaldo Cabral (released), Luis Closa, Diego Vieira (Tacuary), David Mendoza (released)\n\nPrediction: Juan Arce to get them in top half\n\nSol de América\n\nA bright young squad excelled under new coach Ricardo Dabrowski whose name is as obscure as the league he came from (Argentine Primera B Metropolitana). Low on resources but high on team spirit and talent they will be more concerned with relegation than continental qualification for now. The loss of captain Luis Cabral may not be felt so much if their pacey attacking front line can continue to score plenty of goals.\n\nIns: Juan Maldonado (Cerro Porteño), Aquilino Villalba (Aurora), Ángel Enciso (Sportivo Luqueño), José Ortigoza (returned from loan), Fidel Miño (Independiente CG), Sergio Escalante (3 de Febrero), William Mendieta (Libertad), David Mendieta (Guaraní), Roberto Acosta (Tacuary)\n\nOuts: Luis Cabral (Guaraní), Victor Ferreira (Caracas), Leandro Wagner (released), Jonathan Hereñú (released), Sergio Suffo (released)\n\nTacuary\n\nNot pleasing on the eye but their defensive record would bring a smile to Alan Hansen’s face. They have made a name for themselves as a gritty, determined side who also produce quality young talent – the best example being Brian Montenegro now at West Ham United. They managed to qualify for continental competition so will be present in the Copa Sudamericana in the second half of the year meaning the Apertura will be of maximum importance to obtain a good points tally.\n\nIns: Francisco Silva (3 de Febrero), Oscar Ruiz (Libertad), Gabriel Vieira (Cerro Porteño), Diego Vieira (General Caballero), Marcos Benítez (Newell’s Old Boys), Marcos Giménez (Libertad)\n\nOuts: Ronald Huth (Luque), Ramón Cardozo (León de Huánuco), Juvenal Cardozo (released), Nery Bareiro (Libertad), Roberto Acosta (Sol de América), Carlos Martinez Arce (Libertad)\n\nPrediction: Knocking about mid-table as per usual\n\nIndependiente de Campo Grande\n\nAn excellent year that saw them stay up was much in part to coach Pablo Caballero, midfielder Fidencio Oviedo and defender Mario Saldívar, now all departed. The mayan predictions for the end of the world in 2012 does apply to Independiente’s time in the Primera, they are staring into the abyss before we have even started. Their only hope is that the two-promoted sides are even worse…oh and that Roberto Martinez has bought some of La Masia with him from Barcelona.\n\nIns: Roque Cardozo (Nacional), Michel Godoy (3 de Febrero), Oscar Nadín Díaz (3 de Febrero), Leandro Gareca (Figueirense), Aldo Vera (Luque), Elvis Duré (Deportivo Santaní), Roberto Martinez (Lota Schwager), Sergio Álvarez (Nueva Chicago), Pablo Despósito (Independiente Medellín), Francisco Javier Garcia (Cerro Porteño), Richard Lugo (Colón de Santa Fe), Osvaldo Diaz (Luque), Blas Hermosilla (Olimpia), Alberto Ortega Rosa (Deportes Copiapó), Felix Vargas (Sol de America), Victor Dávalos (Libertad)\n\nOuts: Fidencio Oviedo (Cerro Porteño), Mario Saldívar (Figueirense), Derlis Gomez (released), Rolando Bogado (Luque), Luis Cupla (released), Emerson Matías (Defensa y Justicia), Diego Figueredo (Guaraní), Rafael Dos Santos (released), William Schuster (released), Fidel Miño (Sol de America), Jorge M. Nuñez (released), Richard Leite (released), Sergio Samudio (Cerro Porteño PF), Julio Augilar (released), Juan Cadelago (released)\n\nPrediction: Will be close to newly-promoted sides and looking over shoulder, especially if Luque have a good season\n\nCerro Porteño PF\n\nThe boys from the east will hope to do better than Ciudad del Este’s representatives from last year, 3 de Febrero, who were relegated. Things will be tough for coach Eduardo Rivera as they are set to struggle financially and have the disadvantage of being over 300 km away from the rest of the Primera sides. Nevertheless they impressed in the summer friendlies and have the two best strikers from last year’s Intermedia in their ranks in Leichtweis and Prieto.\n\nIns: Arístides Nuñez (Bolivia), Rafael Agüero, Nelson Figueredo, Arnaldo Recalde, Marco Prieto (Sportivo Carapeguá), Rogerio Leichtweis (Sportivo San Lorenzo), Sergio Samudio (Independiente CG), Matías Sliveira\n\nOuts: Israel Rodriguez (released), Gustavo Samaniego (released), Gustavo Orué (released), Derlis Espínola (released)\n\nPrediction: Likely to go into Clausura with relegation worries\n\nSportivo Carapeguá\n\nThe second side promoted to the Primera are also only the second side out of the Asunción/Central nucleus of teams. Concerns over the eligibility of the stadium have resided for now as the APF granted them an extension until June. Having lost coach Juan Arce to Rubio Ñu things will be even harder and the opening game against defending champions Olimpia is going to give us an idea of how they will fare.\n\nIns: Tom Ortiz (3 de Febrero), Jorge Cáceres, Hugo Fleitas, Rodrigo Cantero (General Caballero), Diego Benítez (Olimpia), Cristian Martinez (3 de Febrero), Esteban Ramirez (Unattached), Julio Irrazábal (Vasco de Gama), Wilson Quiñónez (Luque), Gustavo Arévalos, Alejandro Bernal, Aldo Olmedo (General Caballero), Ariel Frasqueri (Sportivo Iteño), Éver Barrientos (Sportivo San Lorenzo), Jorge Florentín (La Paz FC), Danilo Carando (Sportivo Patria), Cristian Santacruz\n\nOuts: Juan Cardozo (released), Victor Hugo Cabrera (released), Carlos Vera (released), Claudio Delgado (released), Miguel Rojas (released), Marco Prieto (Cerro Porteño PF)\n\nPrediction: Will be a fantastic experience for the city of Carapeguá to be in the Primera and by the end of the Apertura, pretty sure that a year is as long as it will last\n\nBy Ralph Hannah\n\nAuthor’s Note: If anybody can help with the destinations of some of the released players pleased contact me via Twitter or in the comments below"
