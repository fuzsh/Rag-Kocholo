        "text": "Are you considering moving to Buenos Aires?\n\nThis South American metropolis is has long been a popular destination for expats and wanderers.\n\nAnd as the digital nomad lifestyle has boomed in recent years, Buenos Aires has become a haven for nomadic workers and travelers.\n\nI’ve been living in Buenos Aires for more nearly 15 years now and while it’s not always been easy, I’m so happy to be living in Argentina.\n\nI moved here single and in my twenties. I’ve traveled and partied and transitioned to a mellow late-thirties married life with kids.\n\nAs far as expat in Buenos Aires life goes, I’ve done it all and have used all of my experience to write this guide.\n\nThis post will help you with all of the logistics from immigration to health care, allowing you relocate to Buenos Aires with confidence.\n\nLiving in Buenos Aires: A Complete Expat Guide\n\nBuenos Aires is a massive city and home to a large expat community, burgeoning culinary scene, lively nightlife, and countless cultural offerings.\n\nBut is moving to Argentina a good idea?\n\nThat depends on who you ask.\n\nBuenos Aires offers its own laundry list of challenges, just like any major city.\n\nAnd honestly, it’s just one of many great places to live in Argentina.\n\nI’ve been living in Buenos Aires as an expat for almost 15 years and my feelings about the city have been a roller coaster, ranging from love to loathing.\n\nContemplating moving to Buenos Aires?\n\nKeep reading for a complete guide with my personal advice and tips to make that move as close to love and as far as away from loathing as possible.\n\nManage Expectations: Is Buenos Aires a Good Place to Live?\n\nFirst and foremost, come with the proper expectations about the reality of expat life here.\n\nDaily life in the U.S. and North America, in general, is very comfortable.\n\nThings are efficient, friendly customer service is a priority, and everything is built and designed for comfort and ease from free 2-day (often same day!) shipping to central air conditioning.\n\nLife in Buenos Aires can feel challenging on those fronts.\n\nEfficiency?\n\nWhat’s that?\n\nPrepare to be challenged.\n\nAnd that’s supposed to be the joy of moving to a new country, isn’t it?\n\nWhile the day-to-day conveniences may not be as easy here, the big things are much more within reach.\n\nFantastic healthcare is available for all, regardless of income or immigration status.\n\nI really enjoy public transportation (which is nonexistent where I’m from).\n\nRelationships are a priority over work and meals with friends and family go on for hours.\n\nAnd wine is very, very cheap (that alone is worth a move, right?).\n\nSo if you move to Argentina and you’re angry that you can’t find good oat milk or affordable feta, focus on the good and you’ll do just fine.\n\nFor more, read my living in Argentina pros & cons list.\n\nCost of Living in Buenos Aires\n\nDue to a notoriously volatile economy, the cost of living in Buenos Aires can vary largely depending on the year and on whether you earn pesos or dollars.\n\nAt the moment (2024) it isn’t as cheap as it was in recent years. With new monetary regulations and big changes from the current president, prices are on the rise. Regardless of these changes it is still affordable for those earning dollars or another foreign currency. But those who earn pesos on a local salary will have a hard time.\n\nRent for one-bedroom apartments typically run around $500-1000 US a month, but recently I’ve heard complaints from friends who have had a hard time finding larger apartments for under $2,000 US.\n\nSo families who need more bedrooms may have a harder time finding affordable rent, but solo expats or couples should be fine.\n\nHey, I realize that’s not as cheap as you might be expecting, but temporary rentals of furnished apartments are not the same here as long term, unfurnished rental contracts, more on that later…\n\nMy monthly premium for private health insurance costs me $160 US a month at the moment to cover me and my two children. For a note on price increases since Milei took office, this is double what I paid a year ago.\n\nAnd dining out, groceries, etc, aren’t as cheap as they once were but compared to the US they are still a bargain.\n\nExpect to spend about 20-30 dollars on a dinner out including a bit of wine, for example. My supermarket hauls tend to run around $100 US for the basics for our family every two weeks (excluding meat and vegetables which I purchase at mom and pop shops).\n\nRead More: Currency Exchange in Buenos Aires & The Blue Dollar\n\nOpening a Bank Account in Buenos Aires\n\nTo my knowledge, it’s very hard to open a bank account with your foreign passport.\n\nYou need to be a permanent resident with a DNI or a citizen of Argentina.\n\nIf you’re banking from back home (I still keep all my money in my US account), choose a bank that will refund ATM fees like Charles Schwab as fees can be as high as U$10 per transaction!\n\nAn alternative to a bank account → Once you have a DNI you can open up a MercadoPago account. MercadoPago is similar to PayPal and can help with small things you’d otherwise need a bank account for.\n\nFor example, I deposit money into my MercadoPago account via Rapipago (mentioned later in this article) and use it for transferencias.\n\nThese bank transfers are a very common way to pay for just about anything in Argentina and for me, were the main incentive to open a bank account until I started using this app instead.\n\nPublic Transportation in Buenos Aires\n\nGetting around Buenos Aires is very easy (and cheap) with public transportation.\n\nYou definitely do not need your own car here.\n\nDon’t worry about importing yours or buying one (unless you work for the embassy and can bring your car in hassle-free and tax-free, then lucky you).\n\nDriving in Buenos Aires is like an Olympic sport and is not for the weak of heart.\n\nBut don’t worry, between ride-sharing apps, taxis, and public transportation, you don’t need your own vehicle.\n\nYou have to have a SUBE transport card for all forms of public transport.\n\nYou can purchase one in any subway station and in some kioscos throughout the city.\n\nLoad cash onto the card at subway and train stations and some kioscos (it can be a matter of checking in a few of them until you find one that offers the service). Then you’re good to go for train, bus, and subway.\n\nRides cost around $650 pesos (subte) to $450-650 pesos (bus) as of August 2024.\n\nTaxis are plentiful in the street, as are ride-sharing apps.\n\nUber is popular and easy to use. I also recommend using Cabify for an another option (use ERINM7 to get credit towards your first ride).\n\nUse Moovit or Google Maps to navigate the city on foot or via public transport.\n\nRead More: How to Conquer Buenos Aires Public Transport Step by Step\n\nArgentina Immigration Requirements\n\nArgentina has relaxed immigration laws.\n\nBetter put: Argentina has very relaxed immigration law enforcement.\n\nI lived here for two years before I even had a legal residency and this is a huge draw for many.\n\nArgentina is a very easy country to live in without the proper paperwork.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the infamous “Colonia runs”, overstay fines, and more.\n\nDigital Nomad Visas\n\nAfter the big you know what of 2020 and the rise of Digital Nomads, Argentina is finally offering their own digital nomad visa.\n\nBut is it worth it?\n\nYou be the judge.\n\nClick here to read the requirements and apply.\n\nYou have to detail your plans, submit a CV, your passport, a photo, and proof of your work (a work contract, proof of your earnings etc).\n\nThe digital nomad visa is good for 180 days. The short time frame boggles me a bit. Most tourists can be in Argentina legally for that same time frame with zero bureaucracy.\n\nOn this page it states that you can renew it for an extra 180 days, which does make it a bit more tempting, if true and easy.\n\nTo be honest, for all that work I’m not sure if it’s worth the hassle.\n\nWhat they’re asking for is technically straight forward but never has Argentine bureaucracy been easy for me.\n\nThe tourism board has created this helpful guide for digital nomads, which isn’t a legal visa in any way but it is a helpful initiative.\n\nColonia Visa Runs\n\nColonia, Uruguay is just across the river, close enough for a Uruguay day trip and a new stamp in your passport.\n\nI was guilty of a few (a lot) of these runs myself back in my day.\n\nBut to refer to them as “renewing your tourist visa” is erroneous.\n\nJust like most countries, when you enter Argentina, you receive a stamp in your passport that allows you to remain in the country as a tourist for 90 days.\n\nTechnically you can renew this once more to stay in the country for a maximum of 180 days as a tourist per year.\n\nThis is the same in most countries, like the United States. But unlike the US, it isn’t strictly enforced here.\n\nIt’s recommended to avoid these visa runs which can insult immigration officers.\n\nIf you plan on staying longer 90 days, even immigration lawyers will recommend that you overstay and pay the fine instead of doing repeated border runs.\n\nMy personal recommendation is – which is not valid legal advice – if you do choose to take the visa run route because you plan on traveling quite a bit, vary your trips up. Take advantage and travel across South America.\n\nVisit Chile, Brazil, Paraguay, etc., rather than going to and from Colonia every three months.\n\nThis is better for you (you’ll get bored of Colonia quickly), and the border agents in Colonia grow very tired of this habit.\n\nGrumpy immigration agents are sick of foreigners abusing the system and they can very well deny you entry or (most likely) threaten that this will be the last time they let you back in.\n\nOverstay and pay the fine\n\nIf you’re planning on staying in Argentina for an extended amount of time, the best route is probably to overstay your visa and pay the fine on your way out.\n\nYou’ll avoid interactions with immigration agents who could deny you re-entry.\n\nWhile overstaying you won’t be considered illegal.\n\nYour residency status will be classified as “irregular” and you aren’t risking arrest by overstaying.\n\nTo find out where to pay the fine and how much it currently is, check the official immigration site here.\n\nAs of August 2024, it costs $40,000 pesos for non-Mercosur residents, click here for the fees.\n\nThis fee in particular is called the habilitacion de salida and is titled “habilitación de documentación al solo efecto de hacer abandono del país de extranjero residente irregular” on the table (yes, that IS confusingly long).\n\nThey list the cost as UMSM, a unit that is worth $1,000 pesos so 40 UMSM= 40,000 pesos (yes, that IS unnecessarily confusing).\n\nPrórroga\n\nIf you feel uneasy with the previous two options, consider applying for a prórroga, or an extension of your tourist visa for another 90 days.\n\nYou can’t apply until within the ten days leading up to the expiration of your tourist visa.\n\nBring your passport, payment for the fee (currently $20,000 pesos as of August 2024), and your visa (passport with stamp) to the immigration office in Retiro (Av. Antártida Argentina 1355).\n\nNo appointments are given.\n\nShow up early (this service is allowed from 8 am-2 pm, but show up at/before 8) and allow between 1-4 hours.\n\nFor full information, read the official site here.\n\nIf you’ve overstayed your visa, you cannot apply for a prórroga extension, you’ll have to pay the habilitación de salida (overstay fine, see above).\n\nYou cannot apply for multiple extensions, you get one (since legally you can remain in the country for the length of two 90 day visas per year).\n\nIllegal vs. Irregular Status\n\nIn Argentina, overstaying your visa doesn’t mean you are in the country illegally like it does in the US.\n\nInstead, you will have irregular immigration status.\n\nNo aggressive immigration agent will hunt you down to deport you.\n\nYou’ll need to pay the fine on your way out, that’s it.\n\nNow, whether you are allowed back into Argentina or not depends on the mood of the agent at the time.\n\nThere are horror stories of frustrated agents threatening that the tourist won’t be allowed back in after multiple overstays/visa runs.\n\nHowever, I haven’t heard of people actually not being let back in.\n\nUsually, an apology, proof of a return flight leaving Argentina, or a promise to seek a legal residency are enough to get you through the door.\n\nIn summary, I don’t feel comfortable putting the advice to disobey a country’s immigration laws into writing.\n\nEvery situation is different, but I can write that it’s common, that I did it for two years, and I don’t believe the practice will end any time soon.\n\nPermanent & Temporary Residencies\n\nIf you’re lucky to come with a job sponsoring your visa, or you find that unicorn of a job after arriving, you’ll receive temporary residency.\n\nYou can renew this each year and after three years of renewals, you’ll be eligible for permanent residency.\n\nI received permanent residency after marrying my Argentine husband, and the process was very simple.\n\nFor more information about residency, requirements, and to make an appointment, click here.\n\nHow to Rent an Apartment in Buenos Aires\n\nIf you’ve decided to move to Buenos Aires, the first thing on your to-do list is probably to find a place to live.\n\nApartment hunting in Buenos Aires can be confusing at first so here’s a quick guide to get you started.\n\nRental Agreements & Contracts in Buenos Aires\n\nThere are two types of rental contracts: temporary or con garantia (with a co-signer).\n\nTemporary contracts last for 6 months, are furnished and are priced in USD.\n\nGarantia contracts last for two years, are unfurnished and are priced in pesos (usually with a set adjustment for inflation every 6 months). The catch? You need a “garantia”, or someone that owns property in Buenos Aires willing to co-sign for you. They’d be signing that they’re responsible for your debt if you fail to pay rent. So, unless you have family in town, you probably will be renting with a temporary contract.\n\nHouse Hunting Tips\n\nNow that you know what you’re looking for, here are some tips and advice on where to look:\n\nWhat’s an ambiente? Rather than be described as 1 or 2 bedroom units, apartments are listed by the number of ambientes they have, including the living room in this number. So a monoambiente is a studio apartment and a 2 ambientes is a one-bedroom.\n\nReach out to Airbnb rentals and ask if they’ll consider a long-term contract.\n\nPaying big deposits by bank transfer is very common in Argentina. I do it all the time, even car rentals and hotel stays. Renting direct from an owner will probably involve you wiring money into their account, it’s normal.\n\nWhere to search for an apartment:\n\nAirbnb – Rent a place to have a home to land in when you arrive, just for a month. If you like it maybe they’ll rent long term for a better price.\n\nZonaprop\n\nSolo Dueños\n\nFacebook groups\n\nAlquilerArgentina.com – Like a local Airbnb, prices are in pesos. But you’ll have to do it like the locals do – by messaging with an owner back and forth on WhatsApp and probably making a hefty deposit via a wire transfer into their account.\n\nWhere to Live in Buenos Aires: Neighborhoods\n\nWondering which neighborhood to live in?\n\nI have a complete guide here on where to stay in Buenos Aires as well as this complete neighborhood guide.\n\nThey’re written for tourists and travelers looking for hotels, but are still a great breakdown on neighborhoods for future expats as well.\n\nMost neighborhoods are safe for expats to live in, but if you are particularly concerned about safety in the city, read my guide that answers the question is Buenos Aires safe.\n\nInternational Schools in Buenos Aires\n\nIf you’re moving to Buenos Aires with your family in tow, their education must be at the top of your worries.\n\nLuckily, there are a lot of options for you here.\n\nThere are a lot of bilingual and international schools in Buenos Aires for you to help your child ease into life here.\n\nMost are in English, but there are also schools offering classes in German, French, and on it goes.\n\nWhatever your child needs, you’ll surely find it here.\n\nFor everything you need to know when choosing a school in Buenos Aires, read my guide to international schools in Buenos Aires.\n\nPago Fácil: How to pay your bills\n\nPago Facil and Rapipago are the top two ways to pay your bills.\n\nHowever, I’d say they’re anything but facil or rapido and are actually a bit stuck in the past.\n\nBut what can you do, cash is king in Argentina, and that’s how most people prefer to pay their bills.\n\nIf your apartment agreement requires you to cover your bills, you’ll likely need to bring them to either Pago Fácil or Rapipago, where they’ll scan the bar code and you can pay by cash or credit card.\n\nYou can also pay a lot of online purchases (even with airlines like FlyBondis) this way as many online storefronts offer this option at check out (usually via MercadoPago).\n\nIt’s something to consider if the website rejects your foreign card or you’d prefer to use cash.\n\nRead all about the dollar blue and exchanging money in Argentina here.\n\nApps like MercadoPago make it easier to pay for certain things online or with a card (when they would normally only accept cash).\n\nSide note that you need a DNI to open a MercadoPago account but once you can do so, it is a game changer.\n\nFor more, read my post all about the best apps to download in Buenos Aires.\n\nHow to get Health Insurance in Buenos Aires\n\nThere is excellent public healthcare in Argentina.\n\nThe care you’ll receive from the doctors in public hospitals is equal to that in private clinics.\n\nThe difference is in the wait times and quality of infrastructure.\n\nThese hospitals are underfunded and overloaded.\n\nIf you’re in a bind financially, you can and should feel comfortable turning to public healthcare here.\n\nHowever, if it’s within your budget, private healthcare options are abundant and affordable.\n\nAnd if you can afford it, then please do leave the limited resources of the public healthcare system for the locals who truly need it.\n\nYou don’t even need to have legal residency to sign for a private plan (I signed up on an expired tourist visa after living here for a year).\n\nMost jobs will include insurance in their benefits packages, covering a large portion of your premium.\n\nBut if you don’t have a job, it’s not expensive to pay out of pocket, I do as a freelancer.\n\nTo be expected, the younger you are, the cheaper your premium will be and it includes so much.\n\nMy insurance covers 40% of all prescriptions, 100% of any blood tests, scans, or ultrasounds (preventative care is encouraged), dental is covered 100%, and so on. And that’s with the cheapest plan available on Swiss Medical.\n\nTop Insurance Companies:\n\nOSDE\n\nSwiss Medical\n\nHospital Aleman – If you find yourself sick and looking for a one-off doctor’s appointment to pay out of pocket for, the German Hospital is great for this. They offer insurance plans also, but I’d stick with OSDE or Swiss for that since they have a wider network of clinics and hospitals to choose from.\n\nDigital Nomad Health Insurance\n\nSafetyWing is a travel health insurance that offers insurance tailored to digital nomads.\n\nIf you plan on living in Buenos Aires or Argentina for the long-term, then I recommend getting a local plan with OSDE or Swiss Medical.\n\nBut if you’ll be focusing more on the nomad part of digital nomad and plan to move around, I highly recommend the SafetyWing Nomad Insurance plan.\n\nIt costs $56 a month for excellent coverage, including coverage in your home country for those trips to visit family (up to 2 weeks in the US, 30 days elsewhere).\n\nThe only downside is the $250 deductible, which is why I don’t recommend using SafetyWing as your health insurance if you are setting roots down here.\n\n$250 can go a long way in Argentina and you’ll be unlikely to meet that deductible unless the emergency is a very serious one.\n\nBut if you want a plan to cover you as you move from country to country, there is no better option to keep you healthy and safe.\n\nClick here to read more about SafetyWing’s plan.\n\nPacking List: What to Bring to Argentina\n\nWhat to bring to Buenos Aires, you ask?\n\nEverything but the kitchen sink.\n\nHa, kidding, sort of, not really.\n\nShopping in Buenos Aires can be a challenge.\n\nI used to have a short section here on what to pack, but I recently wrote a complete guide because it really is a big topic.\n\nREAD IT HERE → What to pack for a move to Argentina\n\nAnd for more packing and shopping tips, read the following:\n\nArgentina packing list – This one is a vacation packing list but still helpful\n\nShopping in Buenos Aires Guide\n\nLeather Shopping Guide\n\nWhere to grocery shop in Buenos Aires\n\nSupermarkets in Argentina are underwhelming, to say the least.\n\nThere’s an entire aisle dedicated to different brands of plain crackers, and the condiment aisle is 75% mayonnaise.\n\nImports are expensive, there is little variety, and Argentines, as a rule, aren’t really into spicy food.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean you can’t get good quality ingredients, you just need to know where to shop.\n\nSmall neighborhood shops trump chain supermarkets, nearly every time.\n\nWhile the internet has slowly killed the mom-and-pop shop in the US, they’re alive and thriving in Argentina.\n\nI only shop in the chain supermarkets for dry goods like canned goods, dry pasta, canned tomato, cleaning products, and the like.\n\nHow to Shop Like a Local in Buenos Aires\n\nIf you know you’re not going to be cooking much at home, then this all may be irrelevant to you.\n\nBut if you fancy yourself a self-taught chef and want a fully stocked kitchen, this is where I’d do my shopping:\n\nSmall neighborhood shops such as Granjas (poultry and eggs), Carniceria (butcher shops), Verdulerias (best produce around), Casas de Pasta (house made fresh pasta shops), Fiambrerias (charcuterie shops), and so on.\n\nChino supermarkets: These small supermarkets are the cheapest places to buy wine. You’re welcome\n\nFerias Itinerantes/Neighborhood Weekly Markets: These markets rotate and move neighborhoods each day. They’re a government initiative to offer good quality at affordable prices to help fight inflation. They have great produce, meat, eggs, and meats and cheeses at low prices. Check here to find one near you.\n\nBarrio Chino: Chinatown in Belgrano is small (only four blocks) but it’s the best place to get imported goods, hard to find ingredients, and cheap bulk products (like rice, seeds, nuts, and quinoa).\n\nBolivian Market in Liniers: It’s a trek to get to Liniers, but I think it’s worth it if you’re up for an adventure. There’s a lot of variety and it’s very, very affordable (even more so than Chinatown). I go here and stock up on things like quinoa and chia seeds to last a couple of months. Take advantage and eat some amazing Bolivian food while you’re there, you won’t regret it.\n\nRead More: What to Eat in Buenos Aires: Food Experiences & Tours\n\nRead more: A Complete Guide for Digital Nomads in Buenos Aires\n\nOnline Resources\n\nWant to meet fellow expats?\n\nThere are a few great communities out there in the form of Expat Forums and Facebook Groups.\n\nLooking for reasons not to move to Buenos Aires, reason TO move to Buenos Aires, or the pros and cons of expat life from those in the thick of it?\n\nCheck out the following links:\n\nBuenos Aires City Guide\n\nArgentina Travel Tips: I run this Facebook group for travelers in Argentina looking for advice when planning travel here.
