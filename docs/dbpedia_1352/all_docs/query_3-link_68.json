The yacht club is now busy year-round, enrollment in private schools has swelled, and Italian developer Cipriani is breaking ground on what it says will be the “largest luxury complex in South America.”\n\nWedged between Argentina and Brazil, Uruguay has long attracted wealthy visitors from both countries, especially during the summer months of December through February. But in recent years, more rich foreigners, including Americans and Europeans, have been putting down stakes."
