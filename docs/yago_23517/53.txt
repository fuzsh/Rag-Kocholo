Empress Dowager Longyu (28 January 1868 â€“ 22 February 1913), born Jingfen, was the regent of the Qing dynasty from 2 December 1908 to 12 February 1912, succeeding Empress Dowager Cixi.

Biography[]

Jingfen was the second daughter of a Manchurian general and his Mongolian wife, as well as the niece of the Empress Dowager Cixi, and Cixi decided to have Jingfen marry the Guangxu Emperor in 1889 to strengthen her own clan.

Guangxu hated "Empress Longyu", and Cixi hated Longyu after finding out that she had overspent her allowance. When her husband and aunt died within one day of each other in 1908, Longyu became the regent for her nephew, Puyi, and that she adopted Puyi as her own son.
