Subsequently, on the 3rd day of the 2nd month, an edict entitled “Assuming personal rule” was promulgated by the government. On the following day, the emperor would preside at the Hall of Supreme to receive homage in celebration of the imperial wedding, which would later be announced in the form of an edict.
