In observance of Empress Dowager Cixi’s (1835-1908) imperial decree, Emperor Guangxu (1871-1908), who had been enthroned at a young age, was to marry her niece Yehe Nara Jingfen (1868-1913) as his empress consort. The daughter of Guixiang (1849–1913), a first-rank military official, Lady Yehe Nara came to be known as Empress Dowager Longyu who accepted the terms and conditions offered by the Republican government for her subsequent abdication on February 12, 1912. Written in black ink on a yellow paper, the edict was not stamped with the “Emperor’s Treasure” seal at the end where the date was indicated.
