        "text": "BEIJING â€” Arsenic poisoning killed the late Qing dynasty emperor Guangxu, who inspired the hopes of reformists but lost in power struggles with his conservative aunt, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nGuangxu, who lived from 1871 to 1908, was a favorite of Chinese intellectuals hoping to reform the decaying dynasty and save the country from encroachment by Western powers.\n\nGuangxu's support for a constitutional monarchy was destroyed by his aunt Cixi, the powerful Empress Dowager, who mounted a coup in 1898 that ended his Hundred Days of Reform - a period of sweeping new edicts that sought to modernize the country and succeeded only in alienating the bureaucracy.\n\nGuangxu's allies were executed or exiled and he spent the rest of his life under house arrest, dying just 22 hours before Cixi in 1908.\n\nHis death allowed Cixi to name the child Puyi as emperor. Puyi was deposed at the age of 6 years old, in 1912.\n\nThen 74 and seriously ill, \"Cixi was afraid that Guangxu would regain the throne and continue his reform plan after her death,\" Xinhua quoted the Qing Dynasty historian Dai Yi as saying.\n\nForensic experts tested two strands of hair taken from Guangxu's body and found they contained arsenic more than 2,000 times higher than that of ordinary people, Xinhua said Monday, citing a report by a committee in charge of Qing history.\n\nThe project to test Guangxu's body for signs of poisoning began in 2003 and was carried out by the China Institute of Atomic Energy, the forensic laboratory of the Beijing police and China Central Television, which plans to make a documentary.\n\nGuangxu's hair was compared with that of two contemporaries, his wife and a Qing official.\n\nThe arsenic found on the empress's hair was 261 times lower than Guangxu and that of the official was 132 times lower, Xinhua said, adding that arsenic was also found in his stomach and clothes."
