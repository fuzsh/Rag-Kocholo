        "text": "Both Guangxu and Longyu were said to be pawns of Empress Dowager Cixi, and Cixi first used Guangxu as a pawn, and later in order to continue to control Guangxu's pawn, she found Longyu as a pawn to monitor Guangxu.\n\nSpeaking of Empress Dowager Cixi's ability to govern the country, but seizing power is a good hand, the Manchu Qing relatives and ministers were stunned by Empress Dowager Cixi, and they did not dare to breathe when they saw Empress Dowager Cixi. After the death of Emperor Xianfeng, Empress Dowager Cixi and Empress Dowager Ci'an joined hands in a coup d'état, killing and degrading the eight ministers of Gu Ming, and took real power herself, thus beginning a half-century-long reign over the Manchu Qing.\n\nThe relationship between the Guangxu Emperor and Empress Dowager Cixi was a double kinship, with Guangxu's father, Yizhen the Prince of Alcohol, being the half-brother of the Xianfeng Emperor, and Guangxu's biological mother Yehenara Wanzhen being empress dowager Cixi's sister.\n\nBecause Cixi gave birth to the son of Tongzhi, the mother sat on the throne of the empress dowager by virtue of her son, Xianfeng was Tongzhi's son, and Tongzhi became the most undisputed and logical person to sit on the throne in the Qing Dynasty, but Tongzhi was a short-lived ghost, who died two years after returning to power in the two palaces, only nineteen years old, and there was not a single child left, and Tongzhi, who was originally the only son, was considered to have made Xianfeng a family of heirs.\n\nFaced with this situation, the Manchu imperial family and several ministers came to discuss who to appoint as emperor, and In order to be able to continue to control the government in a just manner, Empress Dowager Cixi personally designated Zai Xiang, the second son of Prince Yi Zhen, as the heir, which naturally had the reason that Zai Xiang was the son of Empress Dowager Cixi's younger sister, and that Zai Xiang was only four years old at the time, which was conducive to Empress Dowager Cixi's continued seizure of power, as to why she did not choose Zai Han, the eldest son of Yi Zhen, because Zai Han died early at the age of two.\n\nThe young Zai Xiang was proclaimed emperor, and he formed a \"mother-son\" relationship with Empress Dowager Cixi, who was also quite concerned about the little emperor, and also dictated the Four Books and Five Classics herself, adding and subtracting clothes. When the Guangxu Emperor grew older, the two people began to have contradictions, because when Guangxu became an adult, Empress Dowager Cixi was about to return to power, and she was willing to let go of the power Cixi easily, so she made a set of discipline and regulations, \"All events, first ask Yi Zhi, and then listen to the emperor's prelude.\" \"In essence, there is no difference between listening to the government and listening to the government.\n\nIn order to be able to control the Guangxu Emperor more effectively after returning to power, Empress Dowager Cixi also used her brain in Guangxu's marriage, designating her brother Guixiang's daughter Jingfen as the empress of the Guangxu Emperor, that is, Empress Longyu, in order to monitor Guangxu's every move, from here it can be seen that Guangxu and Longyu are cousins, Longyu is three years older than Guangxu, and is Guangxu's cousin.\n\nWhy did the Guangxu Emperor and Longyu cry bitterly on the day of their big wedding?\n\nFirst of all, the relationship between Guangxu and Longyu, these two people because they are cousins and brothers, they have been playing together since childhood, Longyu's father Guixiang although he has done nothing in his life, Empress Dowager Cixi hates iron and steel but still takes more care of him, Longyu is Empress Dowager Cixi's niece, often goes to the palace to play, Longyu, who is three years older than Guangxu, takes care of him like a younger brother, in Guangxu's view, Longyu is his cousin, suddenly became his own empress, very unacceptable.\n\nLongyu's appearance is ugly, and there are some hunchbacks, for Guangxu, Longyu is much worse than Zhenfei, as a cousin, it doesn't matter what kind of Guangxu Longyu looks like, but as an empress, Guangxu is still very disgusted, but under the obscenity of Empress Dowager Cixi, Guangxu does not dare to resist, and her heart is naturally extremely unhappy.\n\nIn order to continue to manipulate the power of the Qing court, Empress Dowager Cixi was mostly loyal to her in the appointment of civil and military officials, and in order to facilitate the grasp of the movements of the Guangxu Emperor, she changed Guangxu's study to the Xiyuan garden near the Summer Palace, required Guangxu to go to the Summer Palace every day to ask for peace, and set up various obstacles for Guangxu's pro-government, which made the aspiring Guangxu feel a sense of suffocation and unhappiness for a long time.\n\nIn the selection of the empress, Empress Dowager Cixi once again made Jingfen empress, and the two daughters of The Right Attendant Changxu of Hubu were named Zhen Concubine and Concubine Jin, and the beautiful and clever Zhen Concubine was loved by Guangxu, and her heart was also depressed that her Guangxu could not be crowned as a queen.\n\nAll kinds of unhappiness, on the day of Guangxu and Longyu's big wedding, in the cave room, Guangxu, who was in a very bad mood, couldn't help but pounce on Longyu's body, cry bitterly, and said to Longyu: \"Sister, I will always respect you, but you see how embarrassed I am.\" After Guangxu and Longyu got married, they were disheartened for a long time and have always been cold to Longyu.\n\nIn fact, Guangxu and Longyu are just pawns of Empress Dowager Cixi, when Empress Dowager Cixi felt that Guangxu's chess piece was not easy to use, she tried to get rid of him, and Longyu was weak, and she also had a sympathy for Guangxu, because it did not play a role in monitoring Guangxu, so she could not get the favor of Empress Dowager Cixi, saying that Longyu was also a poor person, not only did she not get the grace of Guangxu in the palace, that is, Empress Dowager Cixi did not have special grace for her, and every day in front of Empress Dowager Cixi, in addition to morning and evening, most of them closed the palace to keep themselves. Only melancholy!"
