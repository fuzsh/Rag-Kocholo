        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n161 Chapter Seven Moving to Shanghai Urban Women of Means in the Late Qing Yan Wang I n the autumn of 1891, the seventeenth year of the Guangxu emperor’s reign, a young woman of the Zhuang family married Sheng Xuanhuai (1844–1916), the leading official-merchant of the late Qing era and a pivotal figure in China’s history of capitalism, as his successor wife.1 It had been more than ten years since Sheng’s first wife, Lady Dong (1846–78), had died. The successor wife’s name was Zhuang Dehua (1866–1927), styled Wanyu. Such a match was satisfactory for both the Zhuang and the Sheng families . The former, a Changzhou local gentry family, had prospered for several generations in the high Qing period. In the family’s twelfth generation, ancestor Zhuang Peiyin (1723–59) had won the highest score, the first rank (zhuangyuan) of the jinshi metropolitan degree, in the civil service examination in 1755; but unfortunately, the talented scholar died young, in his thirties . Zhuang Peiyin’s elder brother Zhuang Cunyu (1719–88) acquired his jinshi degree in 1745 and started the Changzhou School of New Text Confucianism along with his nephew Zhuang Shuzu (1751–1816) and grandson Liu Fenglu (1776–1829). The Changzhou school planted the seeds for the Yan Wang 162 late-nineteenth-century radical thought of Kang Youwei (1858–1927).2 As a Changzhou gentry family, the Zhuangs also maintained a close relationship with the local Zhang family, whose talented women (cainü) had been brilliant poets for generations.3 But the glorious Zhuang clan had undergone a gradual decline in the late nineteenth century. By the fifteenth generation, no names ranked high in the civil service examinations. Zhuang Peiyin’s great-grandson Zhuang Yuying merely achieved the title of linsheng, which means “the most distinguished among those who passed the county-level examination.”4 Zhuang Yuying produced three sons and three daughters, of which the two elder sons and two elder daughters all died before reaching their teens. Only the youngest son and the youngest daughter by his concubine Lady Jin survived. In 1887, when the family composed its genealogy, the youngest daughter was not yet engaged.5 But several years later, she married upward into the powerful Sheng family: she is the protagonist of this chapter. The Sheng family felt content that they had found a suitable match, because the Zhuang family with its glorious past came from the same local county. In addition, the new bride was more than twenty years younger than the bridegroom. Lady Zhuang stood on the margins between the tradition of the “talented woman” and the modern “new woman.” She emerged from the place and time in which “talented women” had flourished. But unlike the Zhang women described by Joan Judge in chapter 6 of this volume, she had not acquired the education and political awareness that marked new-style talent in the late Qing.6 As an ordinary gentlewoman (guixiu)—a woman of means in the transitional period when “new women” superseded “talented women,” in the final twenty years of the Qing—Lady Zhuang was caught in an awkward position. She was not a poet and seldom expressed her talent through writing. She did write, however, mostly in family letters. These letters were written to her husband, her mother, her brother, and friends. Her handwriting in the letters seems unsophisticated, and the writing contains numerous errors. Rather than a valorized “new woman,” she belonged to the category of “leisured lady of means,” the type of woman who was harshly criticized by late Qing reformers for living off her father or husband, for having no idea what was happening in the contemporary world, and for paying attention only to jewelry and cosmetics.7 The histories of women like Lady Zhuang have been neglected owing to such discourse and to the scarcity of historical sources written in their own hands. Her story, however, provides a continuous and vivid picture of the transformation of leisured ladies in the [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-21 09:24 GMT) Moving to Shanghai 163 late Qing urban world. It demonstrates their critical role in the success of their families and their quick adaptation to and engagement with the modernizing urban world. Moving to the Shanghai Concessions Most of Lady Zhuang’s married life was spent in Shanghai’s “concessions,” the city districts controlled by foreign governments. Leaving the old house in Changzhou, a city that had long been..."
