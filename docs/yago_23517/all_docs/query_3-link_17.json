        "text": "mperor Guangxu (1871-1908) was only four when he was enthroned. On the 27th day of the 1st month of his 15th-year reign (1889), the emperor was married. As per the custom, Empress Dowager Cixi (1835-1908) was to return ruling power to Guangxu. This was done in observance of the imperial decree of Empress Dowager. Subsequently, on the 3rd day of the 2nd month, an edict entitled “Assuming personal rule” was promulgated by the government. On the following day, the emperor would preside at the Hall of Supreme to receive homage in celebration of the imperial wedding, which would later be announced in the form of an edict. Emperor Guangxu hosted the Imperial Wedding and assumed personal rule in the following year. At the same time, a new honorary title was bestowed on the Empress Dowager Cixi.\n\nItem No.\n\n038294\n\nPeriod\n\n1889\n\nDimensions\n\n76.5x210.7 cm\n\nMaterials\n\npaper"
