        "text": "Ruyi, a ceremonial scepter, is revered by Chinese people for its symbol of good fortune and longevity. But what many folk do not know is that ruyi was originally designed as a backscratcher.\n\nIn Chinese, ruyi means âeverything goes well,â and its popularity peaked during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).\n\nThe origins of ruyi can be traced back to the Warring States period.\n\nIn the past, sticks or bamboo of 3 feet long were used to relieve areas not easily reachable by oneâs own hands. A backscratcher allows you to scratch any areas you could not reach. The name ruyi, was derived as such, as it implies âaccording to oneâs wishes.â\n\nRuyi was first used among the common folk, before Chinese emperors and imperial officials took a fancy to it.\n\nTo suit imperial tastes, an exquisite ruyi was manufactured by the nationâs top craftsmen. But over time, ruyi lost its practical purpose. No longer used as a backscratcher, ruyi rose in status as a preferred choice for imperial gifts.\n\nRuyi can be made from a variety of materials, such as gold, silver, jade, copper, emerald, crystal, ruby or pearl. It also varies in the number of embellishments.\n\nMost ruyi came with a long tassel, which adds to its charm. Tassels can be red, green, yellow or blue in color. It also varies in the type of knot used.\n\nThe head of the scepter is often carved in the form of a lingzhi fungus, sunflower, cloud or a lotus. The lingzhi fungus remains the most popular form, as it symbolizes immortality in Chinese folklore.\n\nIn olden times, people believed that the lingzhi fungus was a type of immortality pill that had resurrection powers. It is said that an immortal lived up to 700 years due to his consistent intake of lingzhi fungi.\n\nThe lingzhi fungus is also a common symbol in many Chinese folktales. In âLegend of the White Snake,â the snake spirit braves danger and steals a magical herb to revive her lover. The herb was none other than lingzhi fungi.\n\nSuch folklore led people to associate the fungi with longevity. Needless to say, lingzhi ruyi gained popularity as it signifies longevity for the owner.\n\nOther common motifs used to decorate ruyi are the Three Abundances â peach, Buddhaâs hand and pomegranate. The fruits symbolize longevity, fortune and an abundance of descendants respectively.\n\nThe Chinese language has many homophones or words that share the same pronunciation. This creates room for symbolism, where objects are used to signify meaning when they share the same pronunciation.\n\nPersimmons (shÃ¬) are often carved on ruyi, as it shares the same sound as thing (also pronounced shÃ¬) in Chinese. Paired together, a persimmon carving on ruyi signifies that everything goes well.\n\nPut a pair of quails and grain ears together and it implies the message âMay you have peace year after year.â Quail (Än chÃºn) symbolizes peace (pronounced pÃ­ng Än), while grain ears represent year (both pronounced as suÃ¬).\n\nIf you have five bats (fÃº) surrounding the character for longevity, it represents five fortunes (also pronounced fÃº) and longevity. The five blessings are health, wealth, long life, love of virtue and peaceful death.\n\nRuyi was also an auspicious gift during the Qing Dynasty. The imperial court frequently gave ruyi during occasions such as enthronement, coronation, birthdays and weddings.\n\nFor Emperor Qianlongâs 60th birthday, his ministers prepared 60 gold ruyi â 43.5 kilograms of gold was used.\n\nTo curry favor, an imperial official even presented 81 ruyi to Empress Dowager Cixi for her 60th birthday. The Empress Dowager Cixi is said to have received over 1,000 ruyi for that occasion.\n\nRuyi also played a central role in royal wedding ceremonies. For Emperor Guangxu, the Empress Dowager Cixi chose five candidates for the empress. According to tradition, the emperor had one ruyi and two embroidered pursues. He would hand over the ruyi to whom he wished to be his empress, while the purse signified his concubine.\n\nOne of the candidates was Cixiâs beloved niece, who was eventually Empress Longyu. Two other candidates were Jiangxi governor Dexinâs daughters. The last two candidates were the vice minister of the Ministry of Rites Changxuâs daughters, who was made concubines Jin and Zhen.\n\nEmperor Guangxu did not like Cixiâs niece. He wanted to hand over the ruyi to Dexinâs daughter but was stopped by Cixi. Afraid to oppose the empress dowager, Guangxu reluctantly chose Longyu instead.\n\nCixi was still worried that the emperor might neglect Longyu if he chose Dexinâs daughter. Thus, she instructed her men to pass the embroidered purse to Changxuâs daughters.\n\nDespite Cixiâs influence on the emperorâs marriage, it backfired on her. She insisted on choosing concubine Zhen, who only became an eyesore to Cixi. Concubine Zhen supported the emperorâs reform attempts, crossing Cixi. It was said that Cixi plotted the death of Consort Zhen. In 1900, when the Eight-Power Allied Forces invaded Beijing, Cixi instructed a eunuch to kill Consort Zhen."
