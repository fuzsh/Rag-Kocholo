        "text": "Peking Opera - Death of Guangxu Emperor\n\nPublished on Apr 27, 2021\n\nRating:\n\nGenre: NCPA\n\nDates: May 22-23, 2021\n\nTimes: 7:30pm\n\nVenue: Multi-functional Theatre of NCPA\n\nPrices: 100, 180, 240\n\nFeatures: Nanjing Peking Opera Troupe and LI Zhuoqun studio will be performing the Death of Guangxu Emperor at multi-functional theatre of NCPA from May 22-23, 2021.\n\nBRIEF INTRODUCTION\n\nPeking Opera Death of Guangxu Emperor, produced by the Nanjing Peking Opera Troupe with support from the Nanjing Arts Fund in 2019, was the first opera to be released after the Nanjing Peking Opera Troupe established strategic cooperation with the Jingju Theater Company of Beijing, and first work to be created after the founding of the LI Zhuoqun Studio.\n\nDirector LI Zhuoqun spent several years polishing the libretto and also referred to two million Chinese characters of historical data. Other members of the production team include composer XIE Zhenqiang, LAN Ling, a talented stylist in the traditional opera scene, and ZHAO Xi, a young dancer who lives in the USA. ZHONG Liman, Facilitator of the Group for âResearch on the Cause of the Death of Emperor Guangxuâ, part of the National Qing Dynasty History Project, serves as historical consultant. Some performers include popular Peking Opera artists from North and South China, and veteran performers who have won the Plum Blossom Prize.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nPeking Opera Death of Guangxu Emperor, which starts with the important historical research finding that âEmperor Guangxu of Qing died from arsenic poisoningâ, tells a story about Emperor Guangxu's last 10 days with Empress Dowager Cixi, Empress Dowager Longyu, YUAN Shikai and LI Lianying, any of whom was the suspected poisoner, as well as the sincere love betrween Imperial Consort Zhen. The ten-day turbulent situation is a microcosm of the ten-year miserable life that Emperor Guangxu has spent after the failure in the Reform Movement of 1898.\n\nIn the form of a linear narrative in which stage acting and documentary evidence overlap each other, the whole story unfolds as an astounding truth about the death of Emperor Guangxu is revealed gradually. The treacherous political situation of the late Qing Dynasty leaps to the eyes as Emperor Guangxu wanders among family affection, love and friendship. Emperor Guangxuâs firm attitude toward the reform reflects the antagonism between the old and the new at a critical moment of great social transformation in feudal society.\n\nTickets for Peking Opera - Death of Guangxu Emperor are Available now!"
