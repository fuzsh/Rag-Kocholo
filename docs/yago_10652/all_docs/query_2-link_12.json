Captain Khorshid (Ali Nassirian) is a one-armed smuggler who spends his life savings on a plan to import black-market cigarettes. Customs officials are tipped off by the local crime boss, who does not appreciate competition from the Captain. The seaman turns his efforts to helping political refugees escape. When the Captain is threatened by officials, he risks his life and vessel to help a gang of crooks across the Persian Gulf to Dubai in a fun-filled finale."
