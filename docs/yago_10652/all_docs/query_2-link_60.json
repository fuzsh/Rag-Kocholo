        "text": "In an ifilm exclusive report, Iranian veteran actor Daryoush Arjmand playing a leading role of hit series 'Setayesh' reveals brand-new details.\n\nDaryoush Arjmand has always created some of our fond memories with his memorable roles in TV series and movies.\n\nifilm talked exclusively with the actor in the series. Below is a translation of the interview originally conducted in the Persian language.\n\nifilm’s interviewer says, “we went to this artist and talked to him. When he answered my questions, I sometimes saw a range of characteristics reflected from roles he has played in Iranian TV and cinema productions in his talk and manners. I felt the strength of Imam Ali’s (AS) famous commander Malik Ashtar, the authority of 'Captain Khorshid', the heart of gold in ‘Snowman’, and being a family man just like Heshmat Ferdows in the series ‘Stayesh’. Daryoush Arjmand, one of the products of the new generation of post-revolutionary cinema, is an artist emerging from the grassroots, representative of a generation that believes in traditions and symbolizes an upbringing peculiar to original and traditional Iranian families.\"\n\nifilmtv: Mr. Arjmand, when the series ‘Setayesh’ was broadcast, many people felt sympathized with \"Heshmat Ferdows\". What is your opinion?\n\nArjmand: When the script for the series was sent in to me, I read about the character of \"Heshmat Ferdows\" and realized that this character is not a bad person in the story. Incidentally, \"Heshmat Ferdows\" was a family man and wanted his children to live as they want to. In my opinion, \"Heshmat Ferdows\" was similar to the main character in ‘The Patriarch’ series and had many similarities. I don't know why \"Heshmat Ferdows\" is a bad person from the stand of the audience. Yet I am glad you say so about the audience’s sympathy with this character.\n\nifilmtv: I read somewhere that Dariush Arjmand has played three different characters in ‘Stayesh’ and \"Heshmat Ferdows\" seems to go under fundamental changes in each season. Do you agree with this?\n\nArjmand: All human beings constantly take up new forms, and this is what happens to Heshmat Ferdows. Over time, the audience realizes what happened to Heshmat Ferdows after watching three seasons, for example, it took a long time for Heshmat Ferdows to roll that Setayesh is his son’s wife, and this means drama, because all the characters in this series are growing as they play along. Heshmat had his own lifestyle and taught the audience many things. Of course, I would also like to say that in my opinion, Heshmat Ferdows, has changed some of his behavior, though he does not ignore his principles in life and believes in family ethics.\n\nifilmtv: In hindsight, if you were offered the role of \"Heshmat Ferdows\" again, would you accept it?\n\nArjmand: Certainly. I would have \"Heshmat Ferdows\" and I defend it as always and everywhere. I love not only \"Heshmat Ferdows\" but all my roles.\n\n\"Taher has just finished two years of military service, defending Iran against Saddam Hussein's war of aggression. His friend, who's deserted the frontline, wants Taher to help smuggle him out of the country. Despite his better judgment, and at the insistence of his friend's sister, Setayesh, he agrees. Taher and Setayesh eventually grow fond of each other and make plans to marry. But a tragedy causes a great gap between their families that threatens to keep the two from ever finding happiness together,\" a synopsis for the series reads.\n\nAG/AG"
