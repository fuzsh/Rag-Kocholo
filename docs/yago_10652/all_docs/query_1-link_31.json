        "text": "In 1980, after he had again been released, Kim Chi-ha became a symbol of resistance to the military regime.\n\nAs leader of the democratic opposition, Kim Dae-jung was repeatedly imprisoned and was kidnapped from exile in Japan and taken to South Korea.\n\nIn 1980, under the dictator General Chun Doo-hwan, he was sentenced to death.\n\nwww.kreisky.org\n\nFinally, Haid Haid explains how “ protection ” has become the legal and ethical cover for ignoring the personal and sexual rights of female Syrian refugees in neighboring countries.\n\nIn her article on early and often not formally registered marriages of Syrian refugees in Jordan Areej Abuqudairi shares her insights on the legal vulnerability of women and families in the context of exile.\n\nOf course, the many different facets of this topic make it nearly impossible to cover them all in only one issue of a magazine.\n\nwww.boell.de\n\nThe Helsinki Group of Turkmenistan was founded in July 2002 in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.\n\nThe group was forced to operate underground but nevertheless its members were systematically persecuted and repressed by the Turkmen authorities, and finally were forced to go into exile.\n\nThe Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights (TIHR), the successor organization of the Helsinki Group of Turkmenistan, was established as an independent public organization and registered on 17 November 2004 in Vienna, Austria.\n\nwww.wuk.at\n\nIn this series of readings, Robert Bosch Stiftung and literature centers in the German-speaking world aim to give the public a new look at the realities of life in the Balkans.\n\nEleven of the 21 authors in the anthology – some of whom live in their home countries, others in exile – will come to Frankfurt am Main, Cologne, Salzburg, Munich, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Berlin, and Leipzig to give readings and participate in discussions.\n\nAfter the successful publication of the anthology in German, eight editions of \" Der andere nebenan \" will appear in fall in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia.\n\nwww.bosch-stiftung.de\n\n“ Still Life ” by Sohrab Shahid Saless ( 1974 ), “ Prince Ehtejab ” by Bahman Farmanara ( 1974 ), “ The Runner ” by Amir Naderi ( 1985 ), “ Bashu the Little Stranger ” by Bahram Bayzai ( 1986 ), “ Captain Khorshid ” by Nasser Taghvai ( 1987 ) and “ The Need ” by Alireza Davood Nejad ( 1991 ).\n\nMany Iranian directors now live in exile in the hope of being able to work freely abroad.\n\nJafar Panahi, on the other hand, remained in his home country where, despite all the difficulties, he and Kamboziya Partovi made the most recent film “ Closed Curtain ” which will also be shown in the “ Iran Deluxe ” section.\n\nwww.filmfesthamburg.de"
