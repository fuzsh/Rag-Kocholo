In his village, due to its hot climate and hard living conditions, dangerous criminals are sent into exile. They want to escape from the area, so they ask a middleman to strike a deal with Khorshid. Khorshid is asked to illegally take them out of the country with his boat. At first he is reluctant, but because of the hardships of living he accepts the job.",

        "text": "Plays like an Iranian Western, set against the backdrop of a village located at the country’s edge, where a one-armed loner boat captain crosses paths with a group of exiled criminals, and an opportunistic \"business\" middleman visiting town to make an extra buck before hitting the next village — and slowly burns towards an exciting shootout. Extremely unique, funny at times, and entertaining.\n\nIt’s extremely unfortunate that the lead actor has become such an adamant regime supporter, as this film seemingly provides some unique social commentary regarding the poverty/suffering of the lower class, unethical power structures, and political corruption."
