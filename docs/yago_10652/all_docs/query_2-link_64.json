Hopefully it does the same for you.\n\nI start the set off with a song I heard in a cafe in Mexico City a couple of months ago. It was a moment: perfect song, perfect setting, perfect mood. Every time I hear it, it takes me back to that little corner cafe in Condesa.\n\nEnjoy the ride and take a trip with me. Just a tip, best enjoyed with headphones."
