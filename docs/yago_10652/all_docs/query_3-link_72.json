        "text": "This article investigates how the literary reception of Ernest Hemingway in Iran in the first two decades after the Islamic Revolution is formed by cultural and ideological implications. The theoretical framework of this study is based on S.S. Prawer and Roger Asselineau's notion of reception theory as a branch of study in comparative literature. The methodology entails a chronological study of translations, and cinematic adaptations of the author's oeuvres. This study devotes itself to the study of the two most reprinted and translated works which depict a huge difference in the number of translations and reprints compared to Hemingway's other works. As Such, the following outcomes are deliberated: besides the international fame of Hemingway, his continuing success in Iran can be related to the ideology of the translator, and the director, who deploy Hemingway's novels as a prism to reflect Iranians' stoic perseverance and mythical desire for freedom and fight against despotism as manifested in the legend of Jamshid. Hemingway's code hero, undergoing stoic perseverance in hardship and war embody Iranians' passage through a turbulent historical event after Revolution. Struggling with unemployment, war, and frustrated hopes, Iranians find Hemingway's novels as a way to cope with arising problems during and after war. This article also explicates why reception of this particular work in Iran differs from its universal trend.\n\nThis essay investigates the dynamics that led to the literary reception of Ernest Hemingway before the Islamic Revolution in Iran. This article deploys reception studies as a branch of Comparative Literature with a focus upon conceptions of Siegbert Salomon Prawer and the practical method of George Asselineau to unearth the ideological, political, and historical milieu that embraced Hemingway’s literary fortune in Iran. This investigation, unprecedented in the study of Iranian literature, discusses how and why Hemingway was initially received in Iran. As such, the inception of literary fortune of Ernest Hemingway in Iran is examined by the contextual features, Persian literary taste, and the translator’s incentives that paved the way for this reception. This article also uncovers the reasons for the delay in the literary reception of Hemingway in Iran and discussed why some of Hemingway’s oeuvres enjoyed recognition while others were neglected by the Iranian readership.\n\nFollowing the coup d'etat of 1953 and the trauma caused by it gradually in the 60s and 70s in Iran a new subjectivity, a new vision for the Iranian subject of modernity emerged. Iranians were called by their intellectuals to overcome the trauma, which was called \"occidentosis\", a state in which everything that they try to create and produce is \"stilborn\". They were asked to no longer accept predestination and quietism, developing courage instead, becoming militant and finding their own, authentic way of encountering technologies and the West. This paper systematically demonstrates that the new subjectivity, which can be seen in the Iranian prose and non-fiction in the 60s and 70s is heavily influenced by European intellectual ideas.\n\nThe first part of the volume on literature within Iran and the second part on global circulation complement each other. Covering such a wide range of materials as children’s literature, romance, and politico-religious “propagandist” literature, as well as diaspora literature, it offers a rather comprehensive picture of post-1979 literary field. Furthermore, the combination of quantitative and qualitative data resulted in a thorough analysis. For instance, based on quantitative data, it contradicts the common idea that governmental publishers publish a higher quantity of texts compared to independent ones. This volume will appeal to those in the field of modern Persian literature, more particularly those interested in the sociology of the literary field.\n\nThe present study begins with a brief translation history of Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms in France, Italy, and Spain, showing that, due to the novel's anti-war and anti-fascist nature, in many cases its translations were shaped not only by cultural and literary factors, but also by socio-political and economic factors. Following the introduction, based on Anthony Pym's \"humanizing\" (agent-based) approach to translation history, I explore the roles played by many Chinese publishers, translators, and editors in the novel's translation history in the first half of the twentieth century, with the intention to show why, compared to the translation boom of A Farewell to Arms since the second half of the twentieth century, translations of this novel were produced so infrequently from 1929 to 1949. Review of related historical facts indicates that at least two Chinese translations of A Farewell to Arms were published because Hemingway was identified by many Chinese intellectuals, including communists, as an anti-war and anti-fascist \"leftist writer\"; and even the allegedly pro-communist scholar-official John K. Fairbank was involved in a translation project of Hemingway's works. This study aims at showing that at least a part of the history of translating Hemingway in China has been determined by strategies and choices that the American translation theorist and historian Lawrence Venuti has identified as the \"cultural politics of translation,\" in which the translation process is shaped by political agendas and ideologies, not just by translators' poetic judgment."
