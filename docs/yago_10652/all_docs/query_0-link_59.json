        "text": "The novel was written in pieces, the first piece was entitled, \"One Trip Across\", and was published in \"Cosmopolitan Magazine\", three years before the novel, in 1934. Another portion of what became the novel, entitled, \"The Tradesman's Return\", was published in \"Esquire Magazine\", one year before the novel, in 1936. Both stories introduce Hemingway's \"Harry Morgan\", and the novel would have been written in 1936, but the \"Spanish Civil War\" broke out and reporter Ernest Hemingway left for Spain.\n\nThe Main Characters of the Actual Novel:\n\n\"Harry Morgan\", Hemingway's main character, owns a charter fishing boat out of Key West, Florida. He's a pragmatist, who goes through life looking at everything in terms of his own survival, others be damned. \"Morgan's\" mate and long time friend, \"Albert Tracy\", describes him saying that:\n\nSince he was a boy, he never had no pity for nobody. But he never had no pity for himself either.\n\n\"Marie Morgan\", \"Harry's wife\", was in her past a prostitute, but Hemingway presents her as a sympathetic character with three children that has gone to fat, but compared to the other women of the novel. \"Marie\" is a decent human being and a woman full of love, in contrast to her husband.\n\n\"Albert's\" wife, with her ever present loose dentures, and the \"Old Rummy Eddie\", who works for \"Harry\" on occasion, make-up the other, \"Have Nots\", of the novel's title.\n\n\"The Have's\", are represented by the character of \"Richard Gordon\". \"Gordon\" is based upon Hemingway's one-time friend, author, John Dos Passos, and is described as a second-rate writer. Whose success is based upon his changing political views, that reflect whatever the current popular social convictions are, obviously Ernest Hemingway changed his mind about his one-time friend.\n\n\"Gordon's\" wife, \"Helen\", presents herself as a highly civilized and well respected wealthy woman. However, in reality, \"Helen\" is described as a rich neurotic slut with the morals of the lowest prostitute in the Keys, and delights in treating \"Richard\" viscously.\n\nAnother, \"Have\", is the wealthy man, \"Johnson\", that bilks \"Harry Morgan\", by not paying for a three-week fishing charter.\n\nThe Novel's Basic Plot Concerning Harry and Marie Morgan:\n\nSet in \"Depression Era\" Florida, \"Harry Morgan\", runs a fishing charter between Key West, Florida and Havana, Cuba, but as a result of being bilked by \"Johnson\". \"Harry Morgan\" finds himself stranded, without gasoline for his boat, in Havana. He is approached by a Chinese man with a means for to purchase gasoline and make a quick profit in the deal. \"Harry\" agrees to smuggle a group of Chinese immigrants to Florida, but instead, double-crosses them, murders the go-between, and strands the immigrants on the Cuban shore.\n\nEnter, Sleazy lawyer, \"Bee-lips Simmons\", who needs someone to run guns to Cuba revolutionaries, and \"Harry\" agrees. However, at one point, \"Harry's\" boat is seized by the U.S. Coast Guard and impounded in the local Naval Yard. Next, \"Bee-Lips\" arranges a meeting with four alleged Cuban revolutionaries for \"Harry\" to smuggle into Cuba from the United States. \"Morgan\" plans another of his double-crosses, but after he gets his boat out of the Navy yard, it's spotted and taken once more. To complete his end of the deal, \"Harry Morgan\" acquires another man's boat to use, and at the dock, before he meets with the revolutionaries, \"Marie Morgan\", loads his Thompson submachine gun for him, and watches her husband leave to get his passengers and is experiencing a feeling of dread that she may not see him again.\n\nActually, \"Bee-lips\" has gotten \"Harry\" mixed up with Cuban bank robbers and murderers. At the pick-up point, they shoot and kill \"Albert\", and have to force \"Harry Morgan\" to take them to sea. In a gunfight on-board the boat, \"Harry\" shoots and kills \"Bee-lips\" and the Cubans, but gets himself \"Gut-Shot\" and will die in a hospital on shore.\n\nAt the end, \"Marie\" decides it useless to attend \"Harry's\" funeral and will reconsider what her life with him has been like.\n\nThe way the novel is constructed, it skips back and forth, between \"Harry's\" story and what happens to \"Helen\" and \"Richard Gordon\". It also speaks to other \"Have and Have Not's\", while the Coast Guard tows the boat containing \"Harry Morgan\" past them.\n\nThe First Motion Picture and a Warner Brothers Cartoon\n\nThree events took place prior to the start of filming for the 1944 feature version of \"To Have and Have Not\".\n\nThe first was back in May of 1939, when Ernest Hemingway sold the book rights to \"Hughes Tool Company\", owned by independent director Howard Hawks' friend, Howard Hughes.\n\nThe second, is according to an October 21 to 23, 1977 interview, by Howard Hawks to Joseph McBride, for the \"Directors Guild of America\". Howard Hawks stated that he and Ernest Hemingway took a ten-day fishing trip and during it. Hawks told Hemingway, that he could turn his worst novel into a motion picture. Howard Hawks considered \"To Have and Have Not\", that worse novel, and apparently the two men, while on the fishing trip, wrote a screenplay. The two agreed their screenplay wouldn't resemble the novel and would center upon how \"Marie\" met \"Harry\", with changes to both characters.\n\nThe third event took place in October 1943, when Howard Hawks purchased the rights to the novel from the \"Hughes Tool Company\". Upon learning that Hawks made ten-times more money on selling the rights than he did, according to writer Gene D. Phillips, in his 1980, \"Hemingway and Film\", Ernest Hemingway supposedly didn't speak to Howard Hawks for three-months,\n\nTO HAVE AND HAVE NOT released on October 11, 1944.\n\nThe obvious choice for director of the feature, was the co-producer with Jack L. Warner, Howard Hawks. His latest release was 1943's, \"Air Force\", starring John Garfield. Hawks had also, without credit, help direct, or maybe completely direct, his friend Howard Hughes, 1943, \"The Outlaw\", introducing Jane Russell, but that's another story. After this picture, Howard Hawks directed the motion picture version of author Raymond Chandler's, \"The Big Sleep\", in 1946, with the two leads from this feature.\n\nHawks had made a classic John Wayne Western in 1959, liked it so much, he remade it twice. My article, \"Howard Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' Remade (?) as 'El Dorado' and 'Rio Lobo' Starring John Wayne\", can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.bewaretheblog.com/2017/10/howard-hawks-rio-bravo-remade-as-el.html\n\nThis screenplay appears to be, at least, partly based upon the one Hemingway wrote with Hawks. The film's official listing only shows Hemmingway's novel and never mentions that other screenplay, or credits Hemingway for it. There are two credited screenplay writers for this motion picture.\n\nJules Furthman, is credited as the main writer and would work with Howard Hawks on several others, the next being, 1946's, \"The Big Sleep\". Furthman had written the screenplay for Howard Hughes version of the Billy the Kid legend, 1943's, \"The Outlaw\".\n\nHowever, Furthman's co-writer is of more interest, because this was novelist William Faulkner. Prior to this motion picture, among his other screenplays, Faulkner was the uncredited \"contributor\" to director George Stevens', 1939, \"Gunga Din\", director John Ford's, 1939, \"Drums Along the Mohawk\", and, Howard Hawks' own, 1943, \"Air Force\". William Faulkner would join Furthman on Hawks', 1946, \"The Big Sleep\", with a third writer, Leigh Brackett, known as \"The Queen of Space Opera\".\n\nHow Howard Hawks met Leigh Brackett and her writing the original screenplay for \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\", is part of my article, \"Leigh Brackett: Howard Hawks and John Wayne Meet the 'Queen of Space Opera\", for your enjoyment at:\n\nhttp://www.bewaretheblog.com/2018/06/leigh-brackett-john-wayne-meets-queen.html\n\nThe two uncredited screenplay writers were, Cleve F. Adams, and Whitman Chambers.\n\nHumphrey Bogart portrayed the renamed, \"Harry 'Steve' Morgan\". \" Bogie\" had just been seen in director Michael Curtiz's, 1944, \"Passage to Marseille\", co-starring Claude Rains and Michele Morgan. He would follow this picture with 1945's, \"Conflict\", co-starring with Alexis Smith and Sydney Greenstreet.\n\nI'm sure my reader associates Bogart with roles like the one and in the two other films I just mentioned, but I would like to introduce you to another Humphrey Bogart role. My article, \"Humphrey Bogart: Horror Movie Actor\", can be read at:\n\n\"The Sexy Gimmick\" married Humphrey Bogart on May 21, 1945, and remained married to him until his death on January 14, 1957.\n\nThe budget for \"To Have and Have Not\", was $1,684,000, 1944 dollars. The total Worldwide box office for the motion picture, on its initial release was, $5,257,000, 1944 dollars. Again disproving the majority of Hollywood Film Critics views on the Howard Hawks feature.\n\nBACALL TO ARMS released on August 3, 1946.\n\nThe title of this Warner Brothers \"Merrie Melodie\" cartoon is a parody of another Ernest Hemmingway title, \"A Farewell to Arms\". In the animated story, Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart are doing the \"Whistle Scene\" from 1944's, \"To Have and Have Note\", with typical \"Looney Tune\" style additions.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the following link will take my reader to the complete, \"Bacall to Arms\".\n\nhttps://www.b98.tv/video/bacall-arms/\n\nMost of my readers probably believe the 1944, Bogart and Bacall, \"To Have and Have Not\", is the only motion picture version of Ernest Hemingway's novel and they wouldn't be alone with those thoughts.\n\nThe Other Versions of Hemingway's Novel\n\nTHE LUX RADIO THEATRE radio production October 14, 1946.\n\nHumphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall starred in a shorten radio version of their motion picture \"To Have and Have Not\".\n\nAt the time of this writing, the following link will take my reader to the 59-minute and 42-second radio program on the \"Old Time Radio Downloads\" website:\n\nhttps://www.oldtimeradiodownloads.com/drama/lux/lux-radio-theater-46-10-14-541-to-have-and-have-not\n\nTHE BREAKING POINT released September 30, 1950.\n\nPhyllis Thaxter portrayed \"Lucy Morgan\". Thaxter had fourth billing in the Barbara Stanwyck and John Lund, 1950, \"No Man of Her Own\", and would follow this picture, with the Randolph Scott Western, 1951's, \"Fort Worth\".\n\nJuano Hernandez portrayed \"Wesley Park\". Hernandez had been seen in the Joel McCrea Western, \"Stars in My Crown\", and followed this motion picture portraying \"Mongtezuma\", on an episode of the anthology television series, \"You Are There\", entitled, \"The Conquest of Mexico\".\n\nWallace Ford portrayed \"F.R. Duncan\". Ford was a character actor going back to the 1930's. He starred in director Tod Browning's, 1932, \"Freaks\", co-starred with Bela Lugosi in 1934's, \"The Mysterious Mr. Wong\", co-starred in 1940's, \"The Mummy's Hand\", and 1942's, \"The Mummy's Tomb\". Ford was seventh billed in director Alfred Hitchcock's, 1943, \"Shadow of a Doubt\", and just before this motion picture, Wallace Ford was in the cast of the Barbara Stanwyck and Wendell Corey, Western, 1950's, \"The Furies\". He followed this feature with the James Stewart comedy fantasy, 1950's, \"Harvey\".\n\nThe Basic Plot:\n\nThis \"Harry Morgan\" is a sport-fishing boat captain, whose charters are on the skids and he feels the financial pinch to keep food on his family's table.\n\n\"Harry\" is approached by sleazy lawyer, \"\"F.R. Duncan\", with a proposition to smuggle eight Chinese men from Mexico into California on his boat the \"Sea Queen\". At the same time, \"Duncan\" introduces \"Harry\" to \"Leona Charles\", who is described as a \"Tramp\", the \"Hayes Censors\" again, in the motion picture.\n\nThe stated plan to smuggle the Chinese into California goes wrong and, afterwards, \"Harry\", finds himself being blackmailed by \"Duncan\". \"Duncan\" now wants \"Harry\" to take the crooks that robbed a Los Angeles horse racing track to safety in Mexico. \"Harry\" has talked himself into believing that his illegal activities will ultimately help his family, but his wife, \"Lucy\", suspects he's breaking the law and attempts to convince her husband to stop what he's doing.\n\nTHE GUN RUNNERS released on September 14, 1958.\n\nThis overlooked motion picture was directed by Don Siegel. Two years earlier, Siegel directed the classic anti-Joe McCarthy, depending on who you spoke too, 1956 science fiction, \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\". Just prior to this feature was the hard-hitting crime drama, 1958's, \"The Lineup\", starring Eli Wallach and Richard Jaeckel. Prior to that picture was 1957's, \"Baby Face Nelson\", starring Mickey Rooney and Carolyn Jones, that started a 1930's crime biography craze and led to the television series \"The Untouchables\". Immediately following this movie, Don Siegel directed another forgotten crime drama, 1959's, \"Edge of Eternity\", starring Cornel Wilde.\n\nThe screenplay was by two credited writers and a major uncredited one.\n\nThe two credited were Daniel Mainwaring, who used the pen name of Geoffrey Homes on screenplays between 1941 and 1956. Those included the 1947 film-noir, \"Out of the Past\", starring Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer, the 1951 story about the plot to assassinate President Lincoln, \"The Tall Target\", starring Dick Powell, and 1955, \"A Bullet for Joey\", starring Edward G.

His wife \"Lucy\" and his best friend and mate, \"Harvey\", have kept him out of trouble up until now, but unknown to both, \"Sam\" faces bankruptcy with what he owes the bookies. He is approached by a charismatic, but crooked gun smuggler named \"Hannigan\". Who offers to pay-off \"Sam's\" gambling debts, if he'll run some guns to Cuban Revolutionaries, \"Sam\" accepts and finds himself mixed-up with \"Hannigan's\" plans of double crossing the Cubans and murder!\n\nTrue to Ernest Hemingway, or not, \"The Gun Runners\", as presented, had a timely story line about the revolution in Cuba that caught audiences. The following link is from, \"The Department of State, Office of the Historian\", about a conversation that actually took place ten-days prior to the release of this motion picture.
