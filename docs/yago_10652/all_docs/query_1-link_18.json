        "text": "Saeed Rad, veteran actor of Iranian cinema, died.\n\nAccording to Artmag.ir, Saeed Rad, actor of Iranian cinema, passed away.\n\nThis artist, who was injured due to a fall some time ago, following deterioration of his physical condition, was admitted to hospital and died this morning due to complications of this injury at age of 79.\n\nNegah Rad, Saeed Rad’s daughter, confirmed death of her father and stated that he passed away in hospital at 9:30 am today, July 22st.\n\nSaeed Rad, born on October 26, 1944 in Tehran, started his acting career before Islamic Revolution.\n\nThis veteran actor returned to Iran in late 1990s after years away and started working in Iranian cinema again by starring in movie “Duel” by Ahmad Reza Darvish.\n\n“The Fourth Morning” directed by Kamran Shirdel, “Goodbye Rafiq” directed by Amir Naderi, “Sadegh Korde” directed by Nasser Taghvai, “The Journey of the Stone” and “Red Line” directed by Masoud Kimiai, “Eagles” directed by Samuel Khachkian, “Ch” directed by Ebrahim Hatamikia and “End of the Service” directed by Hamid Zargarnejad are among works of this actor in cinema.\n\n“Gildokht”, “Sarzamine Kohan”, “Silent Terror” and “In the Eye of the Wind” are also among series in which this late actor played a role.\n\nThe funeral ceremony of Saeed Rad, veteran actor of Iranian cinema, will be held on Wednesday, July 24, at 9:30 am, from Khane Cinema Building No. 2 (South Vesal Street, corner of Shafi’i Street) to Behesht Zahra (S) artists’ plot.\n\nEbrahim Hatamikia’s reaction to Saeed Rad’s death\n\nAfter death of Saeed Rad, cinema director Ebrahim Hatamikia mentioned him as a professional actor and expressed his regret over his death.\n\nEbrahim Hatamikia, who worked with Saeed Rad in movie “Ch”, said after death of old actor: “I got to know Saeed Rad in movie “Ch” as Timsar Falahi more. He was a professional actor who agreed to cooperate with us in this project without any marginalization and knowing role that was offered to him.\n\nThis director expressed his regret that he was unaware of his condition in the past year and at same time stated: Of course, according to my knowledge of Saeed Rad, he always liked to face his audience cheerfully and cheerfully, and it is natural to believe that Kanim himself had preferred that these days of his unhappiness should not be in limelight and that image of a solid actor would remain in our minds forever. The soul of this dear traveled happily.\n\nFrom sweet memories of “Duel” to margins made with name of Fardin and Vossoughi\n\n“I remember at first festival screening of movie “Duel” at Sepideh Cinema, when my name came at beginning of movie, people clapped happily and I cried tears of joy. After many years, I was watching movies with people again.”\n\nThese sentences are part of memories of Saeed Rad, famous actor of movie “Duel” who returned to cinema after years away with this expensive and noisy movie and died today at age of 79. An actor who said: “I, Saeed Rad, am actually Saeed Ahmed Haqprastrad, because my brother’s name was Hamid, they called me Saeed since I was a child, but my name is Ahmed in my birth certificate.” I was born in Sangelaj neighborhood. Of course, when I was five years old, I was with my grandparents and uncles, and I came with them from Sangelaj to Shemiran. In fact, I am Shamiran’s child.”\n\nSaeed Rad, who had an accident at his home last year and did not recover from it, lived a healthy life all his years to have an acceptable style and physique as an actor.\n\nA few years ago, he said in this context: Acting is not an easy job at all, and it should be respected. After all these years of acting, I’m still learning. Of course, unfortunately, an issue that is not paid much attention to is necessary care that actors must take of themselves. Acting is not a skill that can be acquired by training and studying. When I started acting, I had seen only four Iranian films. Acting must exist within a person, which I call janam acting. In my opinion, if there is acting in a Janam person, he can train it after discovering this ability by studying and working continuously.\n\nDuring his career, he acted in many films and had experience of working with famous filmmakers, among them Samuel Khachikian, Nasser Taghvai, Masoud Kimiai, Ahmad Reza Darvish and Ebrahim Hatamikia. Although he was banned from filming in 70s and left Iran, he returned to cinema in late 80s by starring in Darvish’s Duel.\n\nA few years ago, in an interview, Saeed Rad spoke about some of his films, which are among prominent works of Iranian cinema, which will be republished at same time as this actor’s death.\n\nHe said about movie “Eagles”: When Samuel Khachkian offered me to act in this movie, I saw how well pilot suit suits me and I believe it was a very good choice. The good scenario and high technique of Khachkian was one of points that this movie benefited from. The reason for audience’s acceptance of this film was presence of elements that audience was familiar with. About one million and eight hundred thousand people who went to see this movie was very remarkable with population of Tehran at that time, and I myself did not expect such a welcome.\n\nNasser Taghvai’s threat for “Sadegh Korde” without Saeed Rad\n\nHe said about his appearance in movie “Sadegh Korde” directed by Nasser Taghvai: The producer of this movie did not agree with my appearance in “Sadegh Korde”. One of actors even wrote to producer that if Saeed Rad plays role of Sadegh Karde, he will no longer act in that office, and this made me angry. I told Nasser Taghvai, I will not come again, and he replied to me, “Either you play Sadegh Korde or I will not make a film in that office” and finally I played role of film.\n\nHe also said about reason for producer’s opposition to this film: because Behrouz Vossoughi had worked on many films in that office, including “The Deer” and “Khak”, and this role was considered for him. I was supposed to play role of “Tangsir” which was given to Behrouz Vossoughi and it was right choice, maybe I could not play that role in way that Amir Naderi wanted. I was supposed to act in movie “Captain Khorshid” by Nasser Taghvai, which Dariush Arjamand played very well, but if I had been there, it would have been different, because I had a Winchester gun and was practicing at home, so it didn’t work. do\n\nMasoud Kimiai’s presence was a blessing\n\nThis actor, stating that “The Journey of the Stone” was a birth certificate for him, said: I learned a lot of lessons in acting from Masoud Kimiai. At beginning of filming, Kurdish theme did not come out and Masoud Kimiai said that there is something wrong with work, I was also very upset. Once Mr. Kimiai said loudly with speaker in his hand: Saeed, I found problem, take your steps higher and it was exactly what he wanted. This detailing means that director knows scene very well. In movie “Red Line”, which is one of my good works, Masoud Kimiai painted movements in such a way that I could easily understand what I should do, that is, he took me out of a normal atmosphere and into a nervous person who raises blood and in During security, he converted. At that time, there were not many good directors and it was a blessing to have directors like Masoud Kimiai.\n\nThe late Saeed Rad said about salary of actors in distant years: Mohammad Ali Fardin’s salary was more than all of us, and then Behrouz Vossoughi and then me. Of course, wages were variable. For example, salary I got for movie “Hadaf” was more than Fardin’s because of commission. When Fardin was paid 300 thousand tomans and Behrouz Vossoughi was paid 200 thousand tomans, my salary was 150 thousand tomans.\n\nHe said about movie “Eagles” and that it had a new story: In this movie, sequence where I was hitting Iraqis with a gun and Jamshid Hashempour was jumping from helicopter was very real and natural. I remember when we were watching this movie for first time in cinema, people clapped when Hashempour jumped from helicopter. People loved hero in movies and reacted to games in movie. Unfortunately, currently our cinema does not have a hero.\n\nDarvish rolled out red carpet for me\n\nRad also explained about his collaboration with Ahmad Reza Darvish in movie “Duel”: After 18 years of not being in Iran, when role of “Iskander” was offered, I saw that everything was right and it suits me in every way, and series It was very good for this movie. Ahmad Reza Darvish had worked a lot on role of “Iskander” and if it wasn’t for that, people wouldn’t have appreciated it. Mr. Darvish liked me very much and honestly stood by my side in movie “Duel”. At that time, when he invited me to appear in this movie, his movie “Born in month of Mehr” was also released, and he told me that “Born in the month of Mehr” is being screened in African cinema, I would like you to see this movie and Get to know my work. After watching movie, I went to his office and we talked about movie. Darvish rolled out red carpet for me in Duel. In Duel, I was given a multi-faceted negative role of Kholi Manesh, which I loved very much, by Mr. Darwish.\n\nSaeed Rad, stating that one of his best roles was “Duel”, said: I remember at first screening of festival at Sepideh Cinema, when my name came at beginning of movie, people stopped being happy and I cried tears of joy. After many years, I was watching movies again with people. In addition, Hedieh Tehrani, in an interview when she was asked why she accepted a very short role in movie “Duel”, she said, “My presence in this movie is to welcome Saeed Rad.” Such behavior only comes from a professional actor.\n\nIf I go back, I will still be an actor\n\nIn response to whether he was satisfied with process he went through in acting? He said: If I could go back, I would still be an actor. I’m still hungry for acting experience, I’m trying to keep in shape and I’m still waiting for a good role. I believe that being an actor depends on his constant presence and that is being in front of camera.\n\nSaeed Rad had his own views about best actors of Iranian cinema and stated: Peyman Maadi is a very physical actor and Hamed Behdad plays well. Amir Jadidi is a solid and extremely good athlete who I have seen some very good roles from him. Shahab Hosseini plays so well that he won an international award and Hedieh Tehrani has brilliant performances and I have seen all his films even his commercial films.\n\nHe also stated: I had many blockbuster movies, but I never attributed anything to myself and I believe that there were series in which I was also present. I have films that have not yet achieved audience record. At same time, my best movies and ones I like have been maybe my least sold ones, like Tangna, The Morning of The Fourth Day, Slaughterhouse, which I really like, and I played a kind of anti-hero. I work in form cinema, not dialogue cinema, and in this cinema I cannot claim how much influence I had. This effect is for person who chose me and effects of actor in a good set of factors can be positive.\n\nA review of Saeed Rad’s series and latest collaboration with IRIB:\n\nSaeed Rad, long-standing and veteran artist of Iran, who died today at age of 79, appeared in several successful TV series.
