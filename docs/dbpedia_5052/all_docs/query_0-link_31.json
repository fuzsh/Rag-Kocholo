It is also troublesome to get thoroughly sufficient and suitable bearings. Further advantages of three-cylinder locomotives are: easier starting, better acceleration of the train, and more uniform turning force on the driving wheels. With an ordinary two-cylinder locomotive the driving force on each revolution of the driving wheels varies from 28% above, to 35% below the mean driving force. For three-cylinder locomotives these figures are respectively 24% and 17%. It is remarkable, however, that with a three-cylinder compound locomotive this drivin g force is more uneven than with the two-cylinder engines, the variation being no less than 52% and 60% respectively. These figures refer to engines with the cranks set at an angle of 120°, which is nowadays generally used. To relieve the strain on the crank-axle it was decided to have separate axles tor the inside and outside cylinders, as if one driving axle only was used, the strain on this would be even greater than with the two-cylinder engines. Another advantage of adopting separate driving axles is that the ratio between the periphery force and the adhesion on the driving wheel, which of course will be more unfavourable the larger the number of coupled wheels, is more advantageous when divided between two driving axles. It is probable also that flat spots on the wheels, caused by slipping due to pressure changes in the bearings of the axles and coupling rods when worn, will be much reduced with this arrangement. The inside cylinder drives on to the second coupled axle, and the two outside on the third one. All three cylinders exhaust direct to the chimney. The leading coupled axle has a certain amount of side play in the horn blocks. Walschaerts valve gear is used for the three cylinders, coupled up to one reversing shaft.\n\n4-4-2 superheater express locomotive, Egyptian State Rys. 6-7. illustration, diagram (side elevation)\n\nBerlin Locomotive Works to specification of R.G.

Mclntosh joined the Scottish North Eastern Ry. at Arbroath in 1862. He was made locomotive inspector of the northern section of the C. Ry. in 1876, and six years later district locomotive foreman at Aberdeen, from which he was promoted to Carstairs Junction, and eventually given charge of the Polmadie sheds. He was appointed chief inspector of the running department in 1891, and took up his present duties as locomotive, carriage and wagon supt. in February, 1895. In October, 1911, His Majesty King George honoured Mr. Mclntosh by creating him a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, and when returning from Scotland last autumn, Mr. Mclntosh, in obedience to a command, attended at the Royal saloon at Carlisle, where His Majesty wished him good-bye.

H.L. Hopwood. 42\n\nCharles Dickens in his youth lived at two addresses in Chatham, firstly at 11, Ordnance Terrace (1817-1821), and afterwards at 18, The Brook (1821-1823). He went to school at Giles' Academy in Clover Lane, and it was near to this school that the \"playing fields\" were situated.\n\nIt is a pity that \"the difficulty about the playground does not appear to have struck Mr. H.F. Dickens\" (to quote from Mr. Bennett's letter) for, to me, the playground gives the all important clue to the spot. The following extract from Langton's Childhood and Youth of Dickens, also confirms my opinion :-\" .... On leaving the Cnathan: Station, which is here purposely confounded with the terminus of'the S.E.R. at Strood, the first discovery is 'that the station had swallowed up the playing field' (which) was immediately in front of Ordnance Terrace, and the writer .... can speak to the perfect accuracy of this description, for it was at one time his playing field too.\" (The italics are mine.) Whilst I do not wish to dispute the statement of such all authority as H.F. Dickens, I claim that Charles Dickens took a scene he witnessed at Strood Station and transposed it in the tale to Chatham Station, as stated in the September issue.\n\nI said that\" Dullborough \" referred to both Rochester and Chatham because I believed (and still believe) the playground itself was in Chatham, but the other incidents in the story certainly deal with Rochester.\n\nRoman stone or military roads. Clement E. Stretton. 42\n\nMy statement, p. 219, is perfectly correct. Harrison Whitlock, p. 268, will find details of the Roman Stone or Military Roads in Wood on Rail-roads, 1838, p. 3. [KPJ: Nicholas Wood] From the 9 April to the 17 September, 1838, the London and Birmingham Railway Company ran coaches over the road from Denbigh Hall to the Rugby Road Station, a distance of 37 miles. It is quite correct that in 1837 the Turnpike Commissioners improved some of the gradients and put the old stone road in good repair and this was done at the request of'the railway company, by whom the old stone track was used for five months.\n\nIt is hardly possible to believe that the Road Commissioners would purchase new stones for the track when there were old ones ready to their hands, especially as they knew that as soon as the railway was finished the London & Birmingham Railway coaches would cease to run upon their road.\n\nFragmentary notes on North Eastern Ry. engines. John Kitching, Jr.\n\nIn your issue of last month on p. 282 you state that 16 goods engines with 4-ft. wheels were built at Middleshro' -on-Tees for the Stockton & Darlington Ry., the numbers of which were 83 to 85. 90 to 97 and 102 to 107. I shall be glad if you will allow me to draw attention to the fact that there were only 14 such engines, seeing that Nos. 93 and 94 were- six-wheel single passenger engines with outside-cylinders. They were purchased from another railway company at a time when' the Middlesbro' & Guisbro\" line was nearly ready to be opened for passenger traffic. The Nunthorpe incline of 1 in 45 soon made it clear that \"single\" engines were quite unsuitable for this. service; and No. 55 Wolsingham, a very smart four-coupled passenger engine, which was designed and built by Alfred Kitching at the Hope Town Works. Darlington, was sent to take their place. This engine. driven by Ralph Coulson, of Guisbro', continued to perform the passenger service till 1869, when Elm Field, another Hope Town built engine, also driven by Coulson, took its place. I would also mention that the wheels of the 14 goods engines referred to above- were 4-ft. 2½-in. in diameter.\n\nLocomotive Carlisle, Bishop's Castle Ry, G.F. Tyas.\n\nIn reply to H. Summers and others, the Carlisle was built by Kitson & Co., about 1869 or 1870, and supplied to the late Thomas Nelson. of Carlisle, a well-known railway contractor employed chiefly on extensions of the North Eastern Ry. As originally built the engine very much resembled the early Cambrian locomotives by Sharp, Stewart & Co. It was a six-coupled tender engine with cy1inders 16-in. diameter, 24-in. stroke, with wheels about 4-ft. 6-m. diameter. The original boiler had a raised firebox with spring balance safety valves covered by a brass funnel. There was a good deal of brass work about the splashers, the name, Carlisle being ,horne on those covering the driving wheels. The chimney was of the bell-mouthed type similar to Kirtley's Midland engines, as was also the weather board. The tender, which was four-wheeled, was also fitted with a weather board. The engine was got up in first class style painted green. and lined similarly to those of the North Eastern Ry. She was, I believe, afterwards working at the extension of New Street Station, Birmingham, somewhere in the 1880s and it would be interestinz to trace her subsequent history down to the time when she went to the Bishop's Castle Ry. I recollect a good photograph of this engine in a photographer's window in Leeds. I also remember the engme coming to Kitson's works for heavy repairs, repainting, etc. I may also state that there is a good illustration of the Carlisle as' she appears on the- Bishop's Castle Ry. in the Railway Magazine .for February, 1909, p. 127. This shows the engme with a cab over the footplate and a chimney of Great Western type, but otherwise she appears very little altered from her original state.\n\nH. Carlton and H.E. Heath also send particulars of the Carlisle, from which we gather that the engine was built in 1869 (Kitson's, No. 1421), and was used first on the construction of the York and Doncaster line of the NER. It was, used later on the widening works of the L. & N.W. from Curzon Street to Aston Junction, Birmingham.\n\nReviews. 43\n\nThe history of the London & North Western Ry. Wilfred L. Steel. London: The Railway and Travel Monthly.\n\nThis history is intended for the non-technical reader, and from cover to cover he will find its pages interesting. The fact that the North Western has been built up by amalgamations, extensions and purchases has made the author's task a difficult one, but he details the particulars piecemeal and shows how the company possessed 420 miles of lines in 1846, when the L. & N. W. was formed, while to-day it has nearly 2,000 miles.\n\nIn many respects the history of the North Western is more interesting than other railways, for included in it are the Liverpool and Manchester, the first passenger line in the world, and the London and Birmingham, the first trunk line, as well as the Grand Junction, Chester and Holvhead and other lines. Details are given of the more notable locomotives, and a resume of the improvements in the train services, whilst the financial history of the company is also briefly dealt with. A number of the 100 illustrations have been provided by the L. & N. W. R., but some, we notice, are taken from the Locomotive Magazine, while the excellent views of modern trains are the work of H.G. Tidey, the well known photographer.\n\nThe theory of heat engines. W. Inchley. London: Longmans, Green & Co.\n\nThis work is a lucid exposition of the theory of heat engines for engineering- students. It should also prove useful to engineers desiring a thorough theoretical knowledge of the subject. The matter has been carefully collated and well arranged. After dealing with the general principles of thermodynamics, the author discourses on hot-air engines. Then there is a chapter on the properties of steam, and two devoted to the theory of the steam engine. Compound expansion and mechanical refrigeration are next noticed. Now that compressed air as a transmitter of power has increased so enormously, the chapter on the theory of air com- pressors is sure to be of interest. Other chapters are devoted to the steam turbine, gas engine, oil engine, internal combustion engine, valve diagrams and valve gears, governors, balancing, etc. Many numerical examples are worked out, and examples given for the student to work.\n\nThe microscopical analysis of metals. F. Osmond. Edited J.E. Stead. Revised and corrected by L. P. Sidney. London: C. Griffin & Co., Ltd.\n\nThis invaluable laboratory guide to metallography is now in its second edition. It is probably one of the most useful on the subject published in this language. Part I is devoted to the study of the structure of metals and alloys as a method of assay. Part 2 deals with the scientific methods of polishing specimens for examination under the microscope, while part 3 describes the apparatus for photo-micrography and practical applications for the micro-analysis of carbon steels. The conclusions to be obtained from microscopical investiga- tions are clearly explained with the aid of a large number of photo micrographs, diagrams, etc.\n\nBoilers; marine and land; their construction and strength. Thos. W. Traill, Fourth edition reprinted. London: C. Griffin & Co., Ltd.\n\nThis handbook will be a help to those who have to settle the scantlings for all classes of boilers, and to determine safe working pressures. It is full of labour- saving tables of dimensions of various parts for different pressures and sizes, and these have been specially computed, and each calculation checked over by re-working to ensure accuracy. There are about 75,000 results given in the tables, but also there are simple formulae for those who have the time and inclination to get the results independently.\n\nFirst number of the Hanomag Journal,\n\nIssued by the Hannoversche Maschinenbau Actien-Gesellschaft of Hanover, is to hand. This issue is chiefly devoted to a history of the firm. The works were founded by George Egestorff as far back as 1835. In 1900 an extensive programme for the rebuilding of the whole of the works was taken in hand. These extensions and alterations will be completed during 1914. The new equipment will afford facilities for an output of 400 to 500 locomotives per annum. The firm have also taken up the manufacture of other specialities, such as the Stirling water tube boilers, wheels, etc. The next number will contain particulars of the firm's specialities.\n\nRail Anchors. 44.\n\nThe Railway Track Supply Co. (of Great Britain), had placed on the market a patent rail anchor for use with bull-headed rails, which is known as the \" R.T.S.\" Rail Anchor. Tests, that have already been made with this device, prove that it will eliminate rail creep on bull-headed track. Prices and particulars can be obtained from the Railway Track Supply Co., who will also be pleased to .supply a few samples free of charge for trial purposes\n\nNumber 258 (14 February 1914)\n\nThe heaviest and most powerful tank locomotive in Europe: \"Mallet\" articulated 0-8-8-0 tank engine for the Bavarian State Rys. 45-6. illustration.\n\nBuilt by Maffei of Munich as bankers for the inclines between Laufach and Heigenbrücken and between Probstzella and Rothernkirchen\n\n4-6-0 superheated goods engine, Caledonian Railway. 46. illustration.\n\nMcIntosh superheater bogie engines for working express goods trains.

Beazley, 432 Sir Edward Fraser, 433 WaIter Burgh Gair, 434 Earl of Kerry, 435 Sir Clement Royds, 436 Sir Berkeley-Sheffield, 437 Charles Stuart Wortley, and 438 Worsley Taylor.\n\n4-6-0 mixed traffic engine, London and South Western Ry. 47. illustration.\n\nUrie simplified design as compared with Drummond designs. Schmidt and Robinson superheaters being evaluated. Two of ten to be left saturated. H15 class (but not mentioned intext)\n\nLondon & North Western Ry. 47\n\nThe following additional Prince of Wales 4-6-0 passenger engines had been completed at Crewe: Nos. 307 R.B. Sheridan, 637 Thomas Gray, 979 W.M.· Thackeray, and 1400 Felicia Hemans. A new series of the same type is in course of construction, the first of which would bear the name Mark Twain.\" Another engine of the Queen Mary class (4-4-0 non-superheater) is now running equipped with the Schmidt superheater, No. 896 George Whale.\n\nIt is reported that the ten new Claughtons which are on order will have slightly larger boilers than those now running. These engines, however, will not be put in hand just yet, nor is it anticipated they will be ready for the coming summer traffic. The latest order for new engines includes a new series of superheater goods, which will probably follow the series of Prince of Wales engines above referred to. The vacuum brake was being fitted to most of the larger passenger engines as they went through shops. It was not intended at present to so fit any of the Jubilee and Alfred the Great classes. The most recent engines to be turned out with the above-mentioned brake were Nos. 1452 Bonaventure and 1721 Defiance, both being of the Prince of Wales class (4-6-0 superheater)\n\nRecent withdrawals included three more of Webb's four-cylinder 4-6-0 mixed traffic engines, viz, Nos. 307, 637 and 1400, the latter being the first of the type built.\n\nGreat Eastern Ry. 48. illustration\n\nRebuilding Holden's earlier four-coupled express engines, the 700 class, and fitting superheaters to increase their efficiency. By the courtesy of A.J. Hill, locomotive superintendent, able to reproduce a photograph of engine No. 775, which is one of the first completed of the fifteen engines of this class which are to be altered. The addition of the Schmidt superheater has necessitated a longer smokebox, and it will be noticed that the framing of the leading end has been altered, and is now shaped like the 1900 Class.\n\nNorth Eastern Ry. 48\n\nThere were twelve of the new three-cylinder 4-4-4 tank engines running, Nos. 2143 to 2154, and eight more are under construction, numbered. up to 2162. These engines were illustrated and described in our December issue.\n\nTen more three-cylinder Atlantic express engines are on order at the Darlington shops. They will be numbered 2163 to 2172. Other work on hand includes ten electric locomotives for freight service. The electric equipment for these locomotives will be supplied by Siemens Bros., Dynamo Works, Ltd. The engines will be used on the Simpasture line when the electrification scheme is completed. This mineral line leads from the marshalling yard at Shildon (one of the largest in Great Britain} to the new Erimus hump yard at Newport, near Middlesborough, a distance of about 18 miles, It carries the whole of the heavy traffic passing from the south and south-west Durham coalfield to Teeside and the Cleveland district. The electric locomotives are to be able to start a 1,400 ton train load and to haul it on the level at a minimum speed of 25 miles an hour.\n\nSouth Eastern & Chatham Ry. 48\n\nAn order had been placed with A. Borsig of Berlin, through their London agent, E. C. Amos, for 10 locomotives for the S.E. & C.R. Excepting some tram engines and a few contractors' locomotives used on the L. & S.W.R. (Amesbury branch), and the widening of the Barnstaple line, we believe these engines. will be the first German steam locomotives used in this country. We understand that 15 Great Northern locomotives are being loaned to this line. At the time of writing the following seven engines have been transferred Nos. 206, 699, 756, 759, 992, 1067 (not 1066· as stated in our December issue) and 1069; These are 2-4-0 tender engines with 6-ft. 7-in. driving wheels and 17½-in. by 26-in. cylinders, of Stirling's and Ivatt's designs.\n\nLondon, Brighton & South Coast Ry. 49\n\nThe 0-6-0 side tanks of the E2 class, Nos. 103 and 104, were working motor trains of six bogie coaches (three at each end of the engine) between London Bridge and the Crystal Palace, via New Cross. The control was by a compressed air system,\n\nPersonal. 49\n\nC.G. Howsinhas been appointed locomotive superintendent of the Brazil North Eastern Ry. Mr. Howsin served in the locomotive shops and drawing office at Crewe, and went to China in 1897 as assistant locomotive superintendent of the Imperial Rys. of North China .. He was afterwards assistant locomotive superintendent of the Rajputana Malwa metre gauge line of the B.B. & C.I. Ry., and was then transferred to Bombay as works manager at Parel and divisional loco. supt.\n\nWm. Pickersgill, who will succeed J. F. McIntosh as locomotive superintendent of the Caledonian Ry. in May, served his time on the Great Eastern Ry. at Stratford. Heentered the service of the G. E: R. in 1876. and was appointed locomotive inspector in 1883. lie was given the post of district locomotive super- intendent at Norwich in 1891, and resigned in July, 1894, to succeed the late Mr. J. Johnson as locomotive, carriage and wagon superintendent of the Great North of Scotland Ry.\n\nW. Griggs has been appointed locomotive superintendent of the Jamaica Government Rys. in succession to Thornton. Griggs was formerly on the North London Ry., at Bow ..\n\nG. H. Pearson, or the G.W.R. Carriage Department, Swindon, has been appointed assistant loco. supt. of the S. E. & C. Ry.\n\nThe Late Mr. James Gresham. 49\n\nWe regret to have to record the death of James Gresham, of the firm of Gresham & Craven, of Salford, which occurred on the 13 January. at Woodheys Park, Ashton-upon-Mersey. Mr. Gresham was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, past President of the Manchester Asso- ciation of Engineers, and a Justice of the Peace. A native of Newark, he was educated at the Grammar School of that town. He served as a draughtsman in the Manchester Works of Messrs. Sharp, Stewart & Co., and in 1865 started works in Manchester for the manufacture of sewing machines and injectors. New works were started in Salford a few years later for the injector business, which had increased enormously. Mr. Gresham took out many patents in connection with the vacuum brake. and had a large share in the success of this brake for railway work. He was also patentee of the steam sanding apparatus for locomotives so largely adopted on railways, and inventor of passenger communication apparatus. .\n\nControlled relief valves for locomotive service. 49-50.. 2 diagrams\n\nIn connection with the new design of locomotive piston valves, illustrated and described on pages 35 and 36 of our last issue, the Knorr Brake Co. recommend the employment of their relief valves, either controlled mechanically, as in Fig. I, or by compressed air, as Fig. 2. It is claimed that piston valves have a disadvantage in not lifting in case of water entering the cylinder, and that, therefore, fracture of the steam cylinder is made possible. This short- coming, however, is entirely counterbalanced by the many advantages gained in using piston valves. In order to get rid of any water, safety valves. are placed on the cylinder covers as low as possible.\n\nE.L. Ahrons.

A judicious use of the expansion gear by a good driver over a road he knows well, and in similar manner systematic control of the feed, will make all the difference between a good and bad steaming locomotive. Some engines require a \"light\" fire, others a medium, and still others do best on a \"thick\" fire; but fuel, too, will influence this. There is a wide difference between firing with Welsh and Yorkshire coals. Whatever be the \"thickness\" of fire found best for either coal or engine, however, it may be taken for granted that the firebars should be kept evenly covered, and the fire kept as clean as possible. If a tendency is shown by the coal used to clinker, then the fire should be kept thin and on the move as much as possible. Coal should be thrown along the side and back of the firebox more than towards the centre, and the jolting of the engine may be relied on to shake it down towards the centre. Every effort, however, should be made to prevent holes in the fire developing and the engine drawing cold air through. The spacing of the bars naturally affects the question very much, and to secure good results the class and quality of the coal being used must be studied, but it is recommended by many experienced men to pack the bars closer at the sides, which can be done by grinding or chipping down the side lugs of a few standard bars. On some railways special \"side\" bars are provided. Warning should be given against the practice often adopted of cramming on more coal when an engine gets sluggish in steam; this only results in bad combustion, the manufacture of volumes of smoke, which coats the interior of the tubes with soot (a non-conductor of heat), and consequently a gradual dropping back from bad to worse so far as the making of steam is concerned. The far better procedure would be to maintain as thin, clean and bright a fire as possible and \"nursing\" the engine generally with the feed and expansion gear.\n\nThe locomotive history of the Cambrian Rys. 58-9. illustration\n\nSharp, Stewart 4-4-0 (designed by firm and four of same type supplied to Furness Railway)\n\nNo. Name WN Date 16 Beaconsfield 2789 1878 17 Hartington 2790 1878 20 3356 1886 21 3357 1886 50 3696 1891 60 3697 1891\n\nIn 1879 the LNWR supplied a Sharp Stewart 0-6-0 (WN 2510) with 4ft 6in coupled wheels which had been supplied to the Denbigh, Ruthin & Corwen Ry: it was given No. 18 Orleton\n\nThe railways of the Channel Islands.

Travis, D.R. Lamb, and J.A. Jenkinson. London: The Boswell Printing and Publishing Co., Ltd.,\n\nThe authors, in their introduction to this work, state that though Great Britain was the pioneer of the world's railways, English literature is deficient in matters per- taining to transportation as compared with that of other countries, few attempts having been made to discuss the principles of railway operation from the economic standpoint. They have therefore endeavoured to fill the void by writing a short series of elementary papers on railway operating economics, and appear to have covered the ground pretty thoroughly. Passenger traffic is discussed at some length, then follow chapters on goods and mineral traffic and terminal operation. Chapter 7 deals with the con- struction and maintenance of the road, and chapters 8 and 9 with locomotive design and practice and locomotive operation respectively. Under the heading of \" Statistics\" the\" ton mile\" is fully discussed, and the authors' conclusions regarding this very debateable point are that though, superficially, ton mile statistics appear useful, their application to British railway conditions appears very questionable, the ton mile limit having been tested and found wanting.\n\nAn introductory manual and catechism on the automatic vacuum brake. Chas. H. Gilbanks.

It appears to go rather fully into the rudimentary principles of the apparatus, although there is much of interest and value. The illustrations are not at all clear, and we are afraid they cannot be taken seriously. The absence of section lines will make it very difficult for a beginner to follow the descriptions, particularly as the handbook is likely to circulate among native railway employees in the East.\n\nThe inventors' adviser and manufacturers' handbook to patents, designs and trade marks.

London: The Railway News.\n\nThe Railway News, in order to celebrate its 50th year of publicaticn, has issued a sumptuous volume of some 700 pages and 750 illustrations dealing with the growth and progress of the railway system during the period 1864-1914. The Railway News was founded jointly in 1864 by Dr. Smiles and Mr. E. McDermott, two well- known literary men, the former being at that time the secretary of the South Eastern Ry., and well known as the author of the Lives of the Engineers and other books. In the volume under review, practically all departments of railway administration are dealt with in nearly 100 articles, many of which are by prominent officials in the railway service. \"Fifty years of Railway Engineering,\" \"Fifty yearsof Locomotive Engineering,\" and\" Railway Rolling Stock,\" will doubtless appeal to most of our readers. There are some 25 pages devoted to illustrations of early railway scenes, though it may be mentioned that many of these depict railways at a period prior to the year 1864.\n\nIn addition to the articles on British railways, there are others dealing with the railways of India, Canada, the United States, Africa. Australia, etc. In connection with the article on the \"Railways of Cuba,\" we note with interest that the first Cuban railwaythat from Havana to Guineswas opened so long ago as 1837. An interesting illustration of the earliest locomotive, a single driver with leading bogie, apparently built by Norris, of Philadelphia, is given. Our contemporary is to be congratulated on its 50 years' record and its remarkable commemorative issue.

A.R. Bennett.\n\nRe Hopwoocl's last letter and the quotation he gives from Langton that I was right in ascribing the scene depicted by Dickens to Strood. I reasoned on railway grounds only, assuming the playing field to be there as described. That it was not, entitles Hopwood to claim a hit also. Probably Dickens arrived from London at Strood, noted the scene and engine there, but wishing to bring in the playground, transferred that piece of land to Strood for the occasion. This explanation does less violence to the facts than shifting the S.E.R. station to Chatham. Then he may have desired to retain the South Eastern in the description owing to the conciseness and aptness of S.E.R. The name L.C. & D.R. was not adopted until 1859, the year before Uncommercial Traveller was published, and would not only have been clumsier for the text but not so readily understood by the average reader. Neither did the previous name, East Kent Railwav, lend itself very well to the required purpose.\n\nCharles Dickens and the railway. Clement Brewin.\n\nMay I venture to suggest that there is just a shadow of doubt whether Alfred R. Bennett is entirely justified in his criticism of Dickens' account of \"the boofer lady's\" railway journey? My memory goes back almost to the date of the publication of Our Mutual Friend; and this was the condition at Settle (now Giggleswick) Station, on the Midland Railway, at that time: the two semaphore arms were mounted upon one post, and were painted red on the obverse and black on the reverse sides. The lamps were revolved by means of a wheel or handle at the feet of the upright rods which supported them. The block system of course was not known. The normal position of the signals was at \"all right\"; they were set at \"danger\" only when a stopping-train was due, and for a certain number of minutes after a train (whether stopping or express) had passed. At night, therefore, they would actually shut their white eyes (green was unknown as an \"all-right\" signal on the Midland until 1890 or thereabouts) and open their red ones whenever a train was about to stop at the station. It is possible, therefore, that, with the substitution of green for white, this is exactly what Dickens saw.

London: The Locomotive Publishing Co., Ltd.\n\nThis book, which is now in its sixth edition, consists of a series of 13 lectures delivered by the author to the enginemen of the L. & S.W.R. with the intention of assisting them to get the best results into the performance of their duties on the footplate. The opening lecture naturally deals with the most important part of the Iocomotive:, the Boiler, whilst lectures 2 and 3 deal with \"Combustion of Fuel\" and \"Steam the Working Agent\" respectively. These are followed by chapters on \"Distribution of Steam\"-in which \"lap and lead\" are fully explained by full page diagrams- and \"How the Slide Valves are controlled.\" The Vacuum and Westinghouse brakes and their working are described at some length, and finally the author speaks of \"Ailments and Failures of Engines.\" The late D. Drummond was recognised as one of the leading authorities on the subject of the locomotive engine, and the volume under review will be read with avidity not only by enginemen, but also by students of the locomotive.

It is owned by the Huntsville Navigation Co. and operated by them in connection with their steamer service from Huntsville to Dwight. The line is one mile in length and crosses the portage between Fairy Lake and the Lake of Bavs. It is the only practicable way to connect the two, as there is a rise in the land which makes a canal impossible. There are two locomotives on the line, both four-wheeled saddle tanks built by the Porter Locomotive Works, of Pittsburg. They are not very powerful machines, and have some difficulty with a full train on the rising grades. There are about ten passenger cars in service, several being ancient tram cars formerly used in Toronto and Ottawa, and a luggage van which has been built by the staff of the railway. The permanent way is rough.\n\nElectriciiy v gas for train lighting. 102\n\nThe superiority claimed for electric train lighting over its competitor gas, on the score of safety, has not been very satisfactorily demonstrated in India. Only recently a first-class carriage on the Oude & Rohilkund Ry., lighted by electricity was burnt out, due it is supposed to a short circuit, whilst on the South Indian Ry. some cars similarly lighted were destroyed at the Egmore terminus, Madras.\n\nE.L. Ahrons. The early Great Western standard gauge engines. 102-\n\nContinued from page 77. Two single engines, Nos. 27 and 29, were supplied to the S. & C. Ry by Messrs. Sharp Bros. & Co., No. 27 (December, 1853), and No. 29 (October, 1853), and which were WN. 744 '- and 743 of Sharp's build. They are illustrated in Fig. 15 (page 77). The cylinders were 15-in. dia. by 20-in. stroke; driving wheels, 5-ft. 6-in. dia. ; L. & T. wheels, 3-ft. 6-in. dia. The boilers were 3-ft. 10-in. dia., and contained 161 2-in. tubes. The total heating surface was 916 ft2., and weight, 21 tons 13 cwt., of which 10 tons 8 cwt. were on the drivers. Comparing these with the earlier engines of the No. 10 class, it will be seen that they were somewhat larger.\n\nFour very interesting four wheels coupled goods engines [0-4-2] were constructed for the S. & C. Ry. by the Vulcan Foundry in 1853, as under, and are illustrated in Fig. 16 :-\n\nNo. 30, July WN342\n\nNo. 31, Aug.WN 343\n\nNo. 24, Sept.WN 344\n\nNo. 26, Sept.WN 345\n\nFor the period when they were built they were very modern engines. The outside frame was solid from end to end, as was also the inside frame, and the latter extended to the back buffer beam. The steam chests were inclined upwards, being placed below the centre line of the cylinders. They had copper-topped chimneys and brass safety valve covers. The wheels had balance weights when new, and the cast iron horn blocks were outside the frames with the spring pillars placed in front of the splashers. The latter were of cast-iron and of a heavy and clumsy looking pattern. The valve spindles were horizontal and placed on a level with the leading axle, to clear which, they had square frames which embraced the axles. The cylinders were 16-in. by 24-in. ; coupled wheels, 5-ft. dia., and trailing wheels, 3-ft. 6-in. dia. The boiller was 4-ft. dia., and contained 185 21/16 -in. tubes. Heating surface of tubes, 1125 ft2., of firebox 85 ft2.; total, 1211 ft2. ; total weight, 25 tons 14 cwt.\n\nNo. 30 exploded at Saltney in 1859, and was such a total wreck that the engine was scrapped. None of the others were rebuilt. Nos. 24 and 31 disappeared about 1872, and were the last to go, 26 having been broken up some years previously.\n\nA very interesting express engine was built by Jones & Potts in November, 1852, and was numbered 32 on the S. & C. Ry. In Jones & Potts's records there is no mention of an engine for the S. & C. Ry., but they give one as ordered by the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Ry., so that it appears probable that No. 32 was originally intended for, If not actually delivered to the latter line. That this was actually the case appears to be borne out by the fact that the engine began work before the end of 1852, some months before the S. & C. Ry. possessed engines 24 to 31. But it appears that she did hardly any work on the S. & B. Ry. before coming into the possession of the Shrewsbury and Chester Ry.\n\nFig. 17 shows this engine, and has been prepared from detailed descriptions supplied by several of the old superintendents and drivers who remembered her (including one who fired on the engine in 1854-55). to whom the drawing was submitted for criticism. No. 32 was stationed at Shrewsbury and was usually known by the sobriquet of \"The Flying Flogger.\" It had inside cylinder~. 15½-in. by 20-in., but the steam chests and the valve gear were outside. The framing was inside the wheels, and the crank axle was extended outwards to form bosses to carry the eccentric sheaves. The eccentrics were covered with plates of polished brass. The driving wheels were 6-ft. 6-in. dia., and the splashers were adorned with the coat of arms of the Shrewsbury & Chester Ry. A peculiarly shaped dome was placed upon the raised firebox, and there was a polished brass safety val~e on the centre of the boiler barre], of the Trevithick old Crewe pattern, similar to the one on engine No. 8.\n\n\"The Flying Flogger\" had but a short career, the chief incident in which appears to have been a collision with an itinerant horse, as a result of which, No. 32 sustained damage to the extent of one broken split pin on the outside valve gear. Structural alterations subsequently required by the horse were not stated.\n\nDuring its short life No. 32 appPars to have taken a fair share in the working of the expresses from Shrewsbury to Chester and to Wolverhampton, but is stated to have been \"shy of steam.'' Whether there was some other radical defect the writer does not know, but at the end of 1859, after only seven years' service, the \"Flying Flogger'' went into Wolverhampton Works, and a new 32, which will be mentioned later, emerged in March, 186o, of totally different dimensions. In the old official lists it was made to appear as if this was the old 32 rebuilt, and it is possible that some unimportant parts of the old engine were incorporated into the new one.\n\nThe last engines to be described tor the Shrewsbury & Chester Ry., Nos. 34 and 35, are illustrated in Fig. 18, and present several remarkable features. They were built by the Vulcan Foundry (Nos. 316 and 317),the records of which firm give the date of construction as 1848, but those of the S. & C. Ry. give March, 1853, as the date on which they began work. As the mileage of No. 34 up to 31 December 1854, was only 34,819, and that of No. 35, 25,726 miles; the 1853 date is probably correct.\n\nThey were probably amongst the earliest examples of Crampton's dummy crank shaft pattern. The cylinders were 16-in. dia. by 24-in. stroke, and the four coupled wheels 5-ft. 3-in. dia., spread over a base of 11-ft. 5-in. The boiler barrel was 13-ft. 4-in. long, and of oval section, the vertical axis being 4-ft. 21/8-in., and the horizontal one 3-ft. 61/8-in. Total heating surface, 1,293 sq. ft., of which the tubes supplied 1220 sq. ft. The bearing springs consisted of four pairs of small elliptical springs over each inside and outside bearing, and were enclosed so as not to be visible. Like all the old Vulcan engines the dome was painted, but the safety valve cover was of polished brass. These two engines ran until the end of 1865, when they were broken up. The boiler of No. 35, modified to have a circular section, was, however, utilised for a new or reconstructed \"short-coupled\" long boiler mineral engine, built at Wolverhampton early in 1866.\n\nGenerally speaking, the S. & C. locomotives continued throughout their career, after they became G.W. Ry. property, on their old line, but of course frequently worked as far south as Birmingham, for the S. & C. and the S. & B. Rys. were merged by the G.W. Ry. into one main line. They occasionally went south of Birmingham, though it was unusual. It is, however, interesting to note, that old No. 2, before being rebuilt as a tank engine, was for a time stationed at Reading in 1864, and is said to have been the first standard gauge engine to have been quartered there. No. 117, six-coupled saddle tank (formerly No. 1), was also stationed at Reading as shunting engine at a somewhat later date. No. 16, as mentioned previously, must also have drifted into the southern division, as she was overhauled at Swindon in I870\n\nNote.-The drawing for Fig. 17 may not be absolutely correct in every detail, but can be taken to be as near as it is possible to make it.\n\nThe locomotive history of the Cambrian Rys. 104-5. illustration\n\nConttinued from page 86.

The total height is only 7-ft. 9-in. Total width, 5-ft. 9-in., and length over buffers, 18-ft. 6-in. The weight in working order 14 tons 7 cwt, distributed 7 tons 8 cwt. on drivers and 6 tons 19 cwt. on leaders. The side tanks are carried well forward to ensure equal distribution of weight, and the engine rides very steadily for a four-wheeled locomotive. The following are the other leading dimensions : cylinders 9-in. diameter by 14-in. stroke, driving wheels 2-ft. 7-in. diameter; gauge 3-ft. A spark arrester is fitted in the smokebox. Further dimensions given in article\n\nMidland Ry. 123\n\nThe principal trains are worked by the 4-4-0 compounds, although it is stated that owing to the success which has attended the introduction of the simple superheater engines, no more compounds will be built. The first made its appearance in 1901, constructed to the designs of S.W. Johnson. It bore the number 2631, and four more were subsequently built, Nos. 2632-5.\n\nIn 1905 Deeley introduced a somewhat improved type of compound. Ten were built in that year, and were given the numbers 1000 to 1009. The following year saw another 20 put on the road, Nos. 1010 to 1029. When the general and drastic re-numbering took place, Nos. 2631-5 became 1000-4, and Nos. 1000-29 were altered to 1005-34. The last series were built in 1908-9, and were numbered 1035-44. To-day they have a large share of the fast main line service and perform some highly meritorious work. They are distributed over the system as follows: 1000-9 at Leeds, 1010-20 Manchester (Cornbrook), 1021-9 Nottingham, and 1030-44 London (Kentish Town). No. 1040 has been fitted with a Schmidt superheater.\n\nThe Midland now possesses more single-wheeled engines than any other line in the country, for 95 are still in active service. They are still seen on the fast trains and are often used as pilots.\n\nNew engines for the Northern Counties Committee, Ireland. 123-4.\n\nThe Midland Ry. had under construction at Derby Works two 4-4-0 type passenger superheated engines for their Northern Counties line, Ireland. The engines will be very similar to those at present in service there, but are non-compound, and have the addition of the Schmidt superheater and its special fittings. The superheater will have the patent header or collector and bypass valves invented by Fowler. On account of water difficulties brass tubes are found most satisfactory on this line, and these will be used in this instance; steel tubes will, however, be used for the superheater. The engines will have Laycock's system of carriage warming apparatus, Gresham & Craven's injectors and ejectors, and the Ross patent safety valves, thus following the usual practice on the line. The principal dimensions are as follows:Boiler pressure 170 psi; cylinders, diameter 19-in., stroke 24-in.; wheels, driving 6-ft., bogie 3-ft. 8-in.; heating surface 986 ft2., superheater surface 275 ft2, grate area 18 ft2.; wheelbase 40-ft. 11-in.; tender, water capacity 2,090 gallons, coal capacity 5 tons. According to the present rate of progress the engines should be delivered about the middle of the summer.\n\nIndo-Ceylon railway connection. 124-6. 2 illustrations, map\n\nOn 24 February the new route between India and Ceylon was jointly inaugurated by Lord Pentland, Governor of Madras, and Sir Robert Chalmers, Governor of Ceylon. The Governor of Pondicherry (French), the Rajahs of Puddakotta and Ramnad, and other notabilities, European and Indian, also attended the celebration on the sacred island of Rameswaram, when the new Indo-Ceylon connection was declared open, although through communication for public travel did not commence until 1 March. Hitherto the mainland terminus of the South Indian Ry. had been at Mandapam. The extension opened follows the Tonitoral promontory about 1%#190; miles to Point Raman, where it crosses the Pamban passage, first by a steel and cement viaduct, 1½ miles long, built on a partly submerged reef, and then by a Scherzer rolling lift bridge across the actual navigable channel to the Island of Rameswaram. The steel girder bridge is made up of 145 4O-ft. spans, while the rolling lift bridge consists of two cantilevers, each of 112½-ft., worked by high-geared hand-winches. The railway on Rameswaram Island to Dhanushkodi was built several years ago, for the pilgrim traffic to the great temple there. From Dhanushkodi a new line bifurcates to two new jettiesnorth and southeach 710-ft. long. The south pier is used in the north-east monsoon and the north pier in the south-west monsoon. On the Ceylon side piers have been constructed at Taliemanar on Manar Island to correspond with those at Dhanushkcdi.\n\nAt present the new route incurs changes from metre gauge railway cars to a steamer, and transfer thence to broad gauge rolling stock; the South Indian Ry. Line to the Indian terminal at Dhanushkodi is on the metre gauge, whilst the 66 mile branch which the Ceylon Government Rys. have built from the northern main line at Madawachi Junction to Talaimanaar is on the broad gauge (5-ft. 6-in.). The distance from Talaimanar to Colombo by rail is 208 miles. If the newly-established arrangement develops sufficient traffic to warrant the change, then it is understood a through physical connection of the broad gauge railways will be undertaken.\n\nAlready the South Indian Ry. is proposing to re-convert the section between Erode and Trichinopoly (see Locomotive Magazine, vol. 17, page 134), where large shops are to be built to accommodate both broad and metre gauge stock.\n\nThe next project is to link up Trichinopoly with Ranmad with a broad gauge railway, forming a chord line between the two places named. The map shows these lines. Conversion of the remaining- section recently opened will not offer serious difficulties. For the present, between the S.I. terminus at Dhanushkodi, and that of the C.G.R. at Talaimanaar, a distance of 23 miles, three geared turbine steamers named Elgin, Curzon, and Hardinge, in honour of the Viceroys in whose regime the scheme developed, will maintain the service, occupying about an hour.\n\nAlfred R. Bennett. The railways of the Channel Islands. 4.The Alderney Ry. 126-8. 3 illustrations\n\nConcluded from page 106. The Alderney breakwater was inaugurated in 1847. The railway extended the whole length of the breakwater to its base at Fort Grosnez; then turned sharply south, skirted the harbour and continued south-east and then east as far as the Admiralty quarry at Mannez, at the east corner of the island, the total length of the line being rather over two miles. During the building of the breakwater a short western branch was laid from Fort Grosnez to Craby Bay to bring up shingle for the concrete blocks, intended for the service of the breakwater only. The existence of the railway fostered an export trade in granite.\n\nThe railway with its locomotives and rolling stock, is owned, worked and maintained by the Admiralty, although it runs chiefly on land belonging to, and leased from, the War Office. This was one of the few instances ol State-owned railways in this country. The Woods and Forests Department, which acquired the manorial rights in Alderney in 1825, charge harbour dues on shipping, and royalty on stone quarried by private individuals on Crown land. About one -sixth, at the eastern end, is of sandstone, the cleavage following an almost straight line extending roughly S.S.W. across the island from Corblets Bay. The Admiralty quarry at Mannez is consequently a sandstone one, and its output is used principilly for \" foreshoring,\" that is, for protecting the foundations of the breakwater by depositing stone to seaward in order to compensate for the destructive scourage due to the prevailing tremendous currents. On the granite section of the island the railway served two quarries, the products of which were conveyed to several crushing mills at the harbour, where, after being reduced to road metal of different grades, and load ed onto small steamers and sailing barges for carriage to England. No official records of the original locomotives survived, but an old engine-driver still living on the Island says they were six-coupled engines with four-wheeled tenders, and named Veteran and Fairfield. Later, a small four-wheels coupled tank, named Waverley was added. They were succeeded at an unrecorded date by two six-coupled tank engines called Bee and Spider, which in turn gave place to the present pair.\n\nAbout 1893 a four-wheeled geared engine, named Gillingham, built by Aveling & Porter of Rochester (Figure 14), having cylinder and motion mounted on the top of the boiler was received and put to work, but for some reason not now remembered was returned to England after a time. Figurre 15 shows No. 1, an 0-6-0ST built by the Hunslet Engine Co., Leeds, in 1880 (Works No. 231), with inside cylinders 13-in. by 18-in., and wheels 3-ft. 1-in. in diameter. No. 2 (Figure 16), was built in 1898 by Peckett & Co., Bristol (No. 686) is a four-wheels coupled saddle tank, 0-4-0ST-with outside cylinders 12-in. by 18-in. and coupled wheels 2-ft. 9-in. in diameter. The engine came to Alderney in 1904 from Portland. On 28 November 1911, it was conveying a foreshoreing train along the breakwater in stormy weather when the driver found that he could not prevent the locomotive f alling into the raging sea beneath with the whole of the train, the men jumping clear at the last moment. It lay submerged for several weeks and was at last fished out by a salvage company for a fee of £200. The chimney, dome cover, cab, side sheets and all exposed piping and fittings were lost, while the smokebox and tank were indented and perforated ; but all damage was made good in the Alderney railway workshops and she is now running as shown in our illustration, which is from a photograph taken in October, 1913. As a rule the two engines spent alternately a week in steam and a week in the shed.\n\nThe locomotive history of the Cambrian Rys. 128-9. 2 illustraions\n\nAston 0-6-0 class of 1894\n\nNumbers.

London : Whitaker & Co.\n\nThis small handbook provides a series of workshop exercises, using the tools and appliances found in the ordinary engineering shop. The author, as workshop instructor at the L.C.C. School of Engineering, is fully alive to the needs of students in this particular field, and his lessons are well adapted to their requirements. The plan followed is to select a simple example of general fitting or machine work and describe how it is to be worked up, with the aid of illustrations, so that an intelligent beginner can easily grasp the correct method of using tools. Attention is given to screw cutting both by machine and by hand. At the end of the book are various useful notes on materials, tables of weights of metals and alloys, physical properties of metals, etc. underlying the design of details. The book is illustrated with about 200 illustrations and four sheets of working drawings of the latest Midland 4-4-0 superheater express engine as well as North Eastern 4-4-4 three cylinder passenger tank locomotive.\n\nThe Newcastle and Gateshead Incorporated Chamber of Commerce Year Book and Commercial Review; edited by Herbert Shaw,.

London: Gresham Publishing Co. 135\n\nThe seventh volume of this work contains the conclusion of the railway mechanical and electrical engineering section, with chapters on signalling and train control. The fourth and final section deals with railway economics. The importance of this subject has now become recognised, and the twenty-two chapters given in this volume are a valuable introduction to it. The working of the goods department is described by H.W. Ede, the principles of goods rates by H. L. Lister, and the economics of passenger traffic by F.J.C. Pole (G.W.R.) and J. Holme. A description of the nature and growth of passenger traffic, and the train services to cope with it, is followed by a chapter on train operation, while the preparation of time tables, working arrangements and statistics are thoroughly dealt with. The commercial aspect of railway works considers the subjects of fares, cheap tickets, workmen's trains, etj., while the concluding section gives attention to advertising, canvassing and other forms of inducing traffic. Reproductions of railway posters in colour form the presentation plates. The volume, like its predecessors, is profusely illustrated.\n\nMexican fuel oil. London: Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co., Ltd. 135\n\nIncreasing demand for fuel oil as a steam raiser for railway and marine purposes, as well as for industrial furnaces, gives this book present-day importance. It goes far beyond the ordinary limitations of an advertising publication. In the first chapter is given an account of the marvellous growth of the Mexican oil industry, with an analysis of the oil fuel. The next is devoted to its general advantages as fuel, with particulars of its calorific value, storage, etc., with a concise description of the many burners now on the market. Other chapters deal with the use of fuel oil in the Navy and the mercantile marine, liquid fuel on the railways, and for stationary boilers, with details of various oil furnaces. The appendix contains a number of useful tables, heating value of oils, etc. The book is profusely illustrated.\n\nWestinghouse Brake Co., Ltd., Kings Cross. 135\n\nLatest catalogue of silent, rocker-joint, chain drives (Morse Patents). This chain is of the inverted tooth type and runs on the wheels in the same manner as a belt, viz., over the face of the wheel. The special feature is the rockerjoint, made up of two pieces, the \"seat-pin\" and the \" rocker-pin.\" As the chain passes on and off the wheels the rocker-pin rocks or rolls on the plane surface of the seat-pin, reducing wear to the minimum. It has a wide range of service, the drives ranging from £ h.p. to 1,000 h.p. It is now manufactured in ten different pitches, and in all widths up to 24-in. for individual chains. Illustrations of a large number of applications are given.\n\nElectric drive indrive in railway workshops. 135-7. 2 illustrations\n\nContinued from page 116. It has been found that for machines requiring 20 b.h.p. and upwards a motor for each machine is most economical. The factors contributing to the consumption of power in woodworking machines are the quantity of timber and its nature, the depth of the cut or operation, the speed of the feed required, and the condition of the saw tooth, planing irons, or other tools. In regard to the latter, it will be found where methodical and correct records are kept, of the power consumed by each machine, that not only will the figures serve as a record of the powers, but comparisons may be made which will indicate the speed on different timbers and operations, whether the machine is being worked at its greatest efficiency, and, incidentally, whether the cutting edges of the tools are in good condition. The importance of an early indication of the tools being in bad condition cannot be over estimated. The power required with a dull tool will rapidly increase, and frequently reaches 200 and 300 per cent, of the original power required by the machine when started with the tool in good condition. A ready method of ascertaining the electrical horse power consumption of any machine under load is to take the readings of the voltage and amperes from the ammeter and voltmeter and multiply the one by the other, subsequently dividing by the \"constant\" 746. To convert this into b.h.p. a proper allowance must be made for the losses in the motor. Generally, if a motor efficiency of about 85 per cent, is assumed, the result may be regarded as on the safe side. The subject of controlling gear is an extremely important one, though frequently ignored. It is not generally known that the success or failure of electric driving depends almost entirely upon the installation of suitable control gear. This lack of knowledge is partly accounted for by the highly technical character of the subject, which has prevented its essential details being much understood outside the shops where such gear is manufactured.

A.R. Bennett\n\nI am inclined to agree with Clement Brewin that the described practice at Giggleswick. (Dickens would have liked that name!), if at all common, might account for the \" boofer lady \" incident. But the journey was in the neighbourhood of London where I cannot, with a memory going back to the 1850s, recollect a single instance of such a thing. Nor was it, I suspect, otherwise than exceptional in the North. Bella's train apparently passed many signals, so to justify the description it would be necessary to have a line on which not only all the station signals but all intermediate ones as well were allowed to be passed at danger ; and that, I feel pretty sure, never existed. Signals in the South were by no means elementary in Dickens'time. On the L.B: &S.C.R. they showed red, green and whitedanger, caution and clearthe corresponding arms being horizontal, sloping and vertical, the last being used when the previous train was belled as past the box in advance. Even with permissive stops, when a train was signalled to pick up passengers, a green light was, according to my observation, waved to bring the driver past the red.\n\nAtlantic type locos. Egyptian State Rys. Vormals l. Schwartzkopff. (Berliner Mmaschinenbau-Actien-Gesellschaft)\n\nIn the article which appeared in the January issue on the Atlantic type superheated steam express locomotives supplied by our firm to the Egyptian State Railways we have said in the second paragraph that \" these engines have been constructed by our firm from its own designs but to the specification of R.G. Peckitt, chief mechanical engineer of ihe Egyptian State Railways.\" A third person now draws our attention to the fact that in England it is not customary to speak of a manufacture from one's own drawings if in the original enquiry the builder uas supplied by the mechanical department of the railway with a blue print showing the design of the locomotive in question, if he was also told the type of engine, type, dimensions and position of cylinders, gear required, sizes of wheels, total weight of-engine and weight of coupled wheels and size of tender, and if he was supplied, too, with a design of the boiler to be fitted with a Schmidt superheater. This point of view is something new to us, for in Germany the usual practice is to speak of a manufacture from one's own designs if the builder must prepare the working drawings himself and if he is not supplied with these by the railway\n\nTo avoid any misunderstanding and to hurt on no account, unintentionally, the mechanical department of the Egyptian State Railways, in particular its chief, Peckitt, vve hereby beg to ask you kindly to publish this letter in the next issue of The Locomotive Magazine.\n\nSouth Eastern & Chatham Ry. 138\n\nGreat Northern locomotives transferred to the South Eastern & Chatham Ry. had the initials of this line painted on the tenders, and where the numbers clash the letter \" B\" had been added.\n\nA miniature locomotive. 139. illustration\n\nThe latest miniature locomotivefor we can no longer call them modelsproduced by the well-known firm, Bassett-Lowke, Ltd., of Northampton, is a splendid example of sound railway engineering -work. This little locomotive has been designed to deal with the heaviest loads on a 15-in. gauge railway, and performs its duties in an admirable manner, maintaining ample head of steam under full load at highest speeds. At present this engine is the most powerful is-in. gauge scale model locomotive in existence, and a few details and leading dimensions will no doubt interest our readers. The cylinders are best grain iron castings, 43/8-in. bore by 6¾-in. stroke. The motion work is of steel throughout with hardened parts. The wheels are steel castings with tyres shrunk on, the coupled wheels are 20-in. diameter, bogie wheels 9½-in., tender wheels 10¼-in. The boilerconstructed throughout in Bassett-Lowke's shops at Northampton was best mild steel plate; the barrel had a mean diameter of 19½-in., with 41 fire tubes, a grid superheater of ample capacity being situated in the smokebox. The tender is of the double bogie type, with capacity for 65 gallons of water and ample coal space. Hand brakes are fitted to the tender wheels, while vacuum brakes are provided on the engine, the ejector being specially arranged for braking throughout the train, and the tender is piped for the connections to the passenger vehicles. Boiler fittings are ample and of generous dimensions and include a \"push and pull\" steam regulator, water gauge, try cocks, steam gauge, vacuum gauge, blower, two injectors with check valves and regulators, while an automatic system of lubrication for the cylinders has been adopted. The engine works at a pressure of 150 psi, measures 18-ft. 2-in. in length, and weighs in running order approximately 3 tons. In service this engine will deal with loads of 120 adult passengers with ease, and being able to negotiate curves of 130-ft. radius can operate under restrictions of space with conspicuous success. The illustration shows the owner, J.E.P. Howey, and his locomotive John Anthony at his residence, Staughton Manor, near St. Neots.\n\nLondon & North Western electrification. 139\n\nElectric trains commenced running regularly between Earl's Court and Willesden (High Level) on 1 May. Pending completion of the L. & N.W. stock, the cars had been borrowed from the District Ry., but the drivers and conductors were L. &N.W. men. Current is taken from the District and G.W. Rys., as the L. & N.W. generating station at Stonebridge Park was not yet ready. Four trains per hour were run in each direction.\n\nCatalogues received and trade notices. 139\n\nThe European agents of the Titanium Alloy Manufacturing Co., Messrs. T. Rowlands & Co., Ltd., Sheffield, have sent us a series of sulphur prints of railway sections showing the elimination of excessive segregation in Titanium treated open hearth rails as compared with Standard open hearth rails. This excessive segregation dangerously weakens the rails, as breakage records of many railways corroborate. The increased wear of Titanium treated rails has been demonstrated by many practical service tests in America.\n\nNumber 262 (15 June 1914)\n\nSix-cylinder Mallet locomotive, Erie Railroad. 141. illustration\n\n2-8-8-8-2 compound with high pressure cylinders set in middle\n\nNew 2-6-0 mixed traffic engines, Great Northern Ry. 142. illustration, diagram (side & front elevations)\n\nH3 class with larger boiler\n\nNew side tank engine, Great Northern Ry.

The following engines of this class had since been turned out with superheaters, and the particulars which were the given are practically the same for the whole of these engines: Nos. 483, 485 to 522, 525 to 530, 532 to 537, 539, 541 to 543, 546, 548, 549, 551 to 558, 560 to 562. These engines were giving such satisfactory results that we understand the Midland Ry. are contemplating fitting more engines of this same class with superheaters, the Nos. of which will be 428 to 482. When the whole of the engines of this class down for superheating are fitted, the numbers will run consecutivel the from 403 to 562. In addition to these engines the Midland have fitted compound engine No.. 1040 with superheater; and have at present order for fitting compounds No. 1000 to 1004.

On 6 April 1819, an Act of Parliament (;9 Geo. IlL, c. 13) was passed authorising the \"making and maintaining of a navigable canal from the City of Carlisle to the Solway Frith\"; and the later Act of 1853 (16 and 17 Vic. c. 119), by which \"for the benefit of the mortgagees and of the public\" leave was given to convert the canal to a railway, and expressly refers to the canal as having been made under the powers granted in 1819. Possibly there was some earlier and smaller canal made as early as 1793; if so, I should be much obliged for any information with regard to it, as I have not been able to trace it.\n\nReviews. 184\n\nModern railway working.
