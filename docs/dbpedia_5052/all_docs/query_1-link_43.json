        "text": "MOTIVE POWER DEVELOPMENT ON SRI LANKAN RAILWAYS\n\nReferences: Hyatt, David Railways of Sri Lanka, Comrac London & Colombo, 2000 and Peeligama, Udaya Essays in Railroading, Darshana Enterprises, Colombo, 2016\n\n(This article and the research work behind it have been generously shared by Mr. Peeligama the author of this article. His knowledge and attention to detail have helped to keep this website on track )\n\nThe railroads of Sri Lanka or then Ceylon have been constructed mainly to the Broad Gauge of 5’-6”, the widest in the world in common with those of India and Pakistan. However, the loading gauge employed which dictates the profile of the rolling stock, is comparable to that of the Indian Metre Gauge. The first line to be built was the Main Line from Colombo to Kandy completed in 1867. The Coast Line to Matara was opened in 1895. The difficult extension of the Main Line to Badulla could not be completed till 1924. By 1928 railways had reached Kankesanturai on the Northern Line, Trincomalee and Batticaloa in the East and Puttalam and Talaimannar in the North-West. A Narrow Gauge 2’-6” line had also been laid on the Kelani Valley to Ratnapura in 1912 and between Nanu Oya and Nuwara Eliya in 1904. The current total track length is 1,508 km of Broad Gauge with no Narrow Gauge track. This paper traces the motive power development on the Broad Gauge.\n\nSteam Motive Power\n\nThe earliest locomotives on the Ceylon Railways had been the ML (Main Line) Class steam locomotives of 4-4-0 wheel arrangement with inside cylinders (Refer Fig: 1). Imported from numerous locomotive builders such as Robert Stephenson, Kitson, Beyer Peacock and Dubs in the UK over the years 1864 to 1895, they had total weights of around 60 tons and nominal tractive efforts of about 9,417 lbf. However, within the Class different batches had significant differences between them in cylinder size and driving wheel diameter. According to David Hyatt, the original locomotive No 1 “Leopold” an ML Class, had hauled the first ever train to run on the island between Colombo and Ambepussa in 1864. A more modern 4-4-0 was introduced beginning in 1911 prior to the opening of the Talaimannar Line known as the “Mannar” Class and which later formed the F1 and F2 Classes. The Class built by the Vulcan Foundry and North British Locomotive Works was equipped with square topped Belpaire fireboxes and outside cylinders with slide valves. Weighing a total of 80 tons with 17,336 lbf tractive effort they lasted well into the final days of steam until the late 1960s.\n\nProgress was made towards 6 and 8 driving wheel types culminating with the significantly successful NOA (“Nanu Oya”) Classes, later classified B1 to B6, the first batches of which were imported as early as 1883 and the last as late as 1948. Again, the locomotives forming this Class had substantial differences amongst them with some of the earlier examples having slide valves and the B2 to B6 Classes all having side tanks in addition to tenders (Refer Fig: 3). The side tanks in these unique 4-6-0 tank-tender design served purely as ballast for greater adhesion when filled, the boiler being supplied with water drawn from the tenders. As with earlier locomotives, several UK builders, namely Stephenson, Kitson, Neilson and the Vulcan Foundry supplied the Class. Hyatt indicates figures of approximately 85 tons as total weight and 22,620 lbf as tractive effort for the B2 to B6 Classes.\n\nFrom about 1915 superheated boilers came to be introduced in place of the earlier saturated steam boilers. The culmination in the ultimate development of the NOA Classes was the majestic B1 4-6-0s, the first batch of which arrived from famed Garratt builder Beyer, Peacock in 1927 (Refer Fig: 4). With Armstrong Whitworth and Stephenson delivering subsequent batches, the Class B1, many of which were named after British Governors of Ceylon, represented the finest and highly versatile steam locomotive type on the island. The most handsome of all steam Classes, they were the workhorses of the system hauling the fast expresses and heaviest goods trains in the steam era. With Belpaire fireboxes and Walschaerts motion, they weighed 98 tons in total and strangely, tractive efforts of only 22,620 lbf (in common with the tank-tender type 4-6-0s) with Load A rating are attributed to B1s despite their proven haulage prowess. Some were converted to oil-firing in the latter days of steam.\n\nLight axle load locomotives namely the Class B8 to B10 4-6-0s and Class A3 4-8-0s were imported from 1908 onwards for the originally lightly laid lines with 461/4 lb/yard rail to the North and the East to Batticaloa and Trincomalee. It is interesting to note that the Northern Line was re-laid with the standard 80 lb/yard rail by the early 1930s, but the Batticaloa and Trincomalee Lines remained unchanged till the late 1960s. These light locomotives came from builders such as Hunslet, Nasmyth Wilson and Bagnall. The highly successful A3 4-8-0s had axle loads as low as 9 tons for a total engine and tender weight of 86 tons and developed 20,266 lbf tractive effort. The latest of these 4-8-0s entered service as recently as 1951 and understandably, had relatively short working lives when steam working ceased by 1969.\n\nFor shunting purposes, 0-4-0ST and 0-6-0T (later rebuilt as Class E1 0-6-2Ts locally) tank locomotives had been received beginning from 1869. These locomotives were obtained from different manufacturers in Britain such as Dubs and Hunslet and though intended mainly for shunting, were used for other duties as well. The railway also received an additional five 0-6-2T tanks from Robert Stephenson in 1928 to complement the shunting locomotive stocks. They weighed around 47 tons, had non-superheated boilers with tractive efforts of 18,014 lbs and were equipped with Stephenson inside valve gear. They lasted well into the end of the steam era some having spent their entire lives attached to important rail hubs. E1 Number 93, built in 1898 and which had been the oldest operational steam locomotive in Sri Lanka spending most of its life at Rambukkana, is now displayed at the Kadugannawa Rail Museum.\n\nFor freight working on the heavily graded (1 in 44) Kadugannawa Incline on the Main Line to Kandy replete with 5 chain reverse curves, 0-6-0 locomotives had been obtained beginning from 1868, with one or two of them needed to bank the head-end unit. These were the original F Class and were withdrawn in 1912. Over the years 1911 and 1922 for assisting trains on Kadugannawa Incline, powerful 4-8-0 type “Big Bank” locomotives were imported from Kitson (Refer Fig: 5). Weighing a massive 117 tons they boasted tractive efforts of 33,475 lbf and were based at Kadugannawa Shed. Originally non-superheated and with slide valves, all were later converted to superheating with piston valves. The need for twin locomotives on the Up-country Main Line was avoided with the introduction of the 2-6-2+2-6-2 Class C1 Garratt locomotives from 1928 onwards (Refer Fig: 6). Built by Beyer, Peacock of Manchester, who had an almost monopolistic control of Garratt building, they had tractive efforts of 41,078 lbf, the highest of any steam locomotive in Ceylon.Though weighing 128 tons, their axle loads were a low 131/2 tons. They were equipped with Hadfield power reversers, the first such introduction on a Garratt by Beyer, Peacock and Nicholson thermic syphons to enhance boiler heat transfer. Used always at the head end of trains on the incline, the Garratts were never operated as bankers lest their formidable tractive effort cause derailment. Although later efforts at oil firing no doubt lessening the fireman’s chores, had some deleterious effects on the engine crew, the Garratts were the undisputed steam era Kings of the Hill Country, their thunderous and asynchronous four cylinder exhaust beat reverberating across the mountain sides.\n\nThe rapidly increasing suburban passenger traffic in and around the Colombo area resulted in the Class D1/D2/D3 2-6-4T tank locomotives built by Stephenson and Hawthorn Leslie, being introduced from 1907 onwards for shuttle services with quick turn-around capability (Refer Fig 2). These powerful 75 ton tanks developed an impressive tractive effort of 21,275 lbf and their 5’ diameter driving wheels lent them the capability of rapid acceleration. Several were named after leading Colombo colleges. It was a common and impressive site in the early post-war years to see these formidable machines take in their stride fully loaded 14 coach suburban trains at speed. The arrival of diesel multiple units in the mid-1950s spelt the death knell for these fine engines after decades of dedicated service.\n\nA number of Sentinel and Clayton steam railcars classified R1 to R4 were also deployed for local passenger duties commencing from 1925. Most had vertical boilers, but a few were equipped with horizontal ones. Remarkably, a few survived till the late 1950s being employed on the Matale Branch Line. Two were converted to diesel and were re-classified as Class T2.\n\nReclassification of 1937\n\nIt is pertinent to note here the Reclassification of 1937 which resulted in a classification system for locomotives and power unit stocks that saw out the end of steam and indeed which has survived to the current day. For steam the primary discriminator was wheel arrangement, a capital letter being used to denote each wheel arrangement type. Additionally R was used for steam rail cars, T for diesel rail cars, G for diesel electric shunting locomotives and S for diesel multiple units. In later years the system was extended to cover diesel electric main line locomotives classified under M, diesel hydraulic main line locomotives under W and diesel hydraulic shunting locomotives under Y. Under each main classification a sub-system of digits were used to denote the different makes and variants of motive power.\n\nDiesel Motive Power\n\nSri Lanka was one of the first countries in the region to experience the convenience and haulage capabilities of diesel power on its railways. The country’s involvement with diesel traction dates back to 1935 when twin 1-C-1 type diesel electric locomotives with 800 hp Sulzer 8LD28 engines were loaned by Armstrong Whitworth of UK for trial running (Refer Fig: 7). These proved troublesome and were returned to the builders who later sold them to the Great Southern Railway of Argentina. In 1938 English Electric supplied three 4 coach diesel-electric multiple unit train sets with twin 180 hp Willans and Robinson engines which were used on the Coast Line providing passengers the experience of train travel with speed, comfort and cleanliness for the first time. These units were classed S1. Heavy corrosion from sea spray caused the sets to be withdrawn in 1955. Following the success of these units, English Electric provided several 180 hp rail cars (Class T1) in 1947 for operation, each coupled to a non-powered trailer car. Mention needs to be made of a 20 ton 116 hp diesel-electric shunter obtained from Armstrong Whitworth in 1934. Its entire life of over 60 years was spent at the Ratmalana Workshops prior to withdrawal in the 1990s and display at the Kadugannawa Rail Museum.\n\nThe next diesels to arrive were the Class G2 54 ton 625 hp shunting locomotives with Bo-Bo wheel arrangement from the North British Locomotive Co in 1951, powered by Paxman 12RPHXL engines. The year 1953 saw the pioneering main line diesel electrics, the 1,000 hp Class M1 Brush-Bagnall locomotives in operation on the island’s railways (Refer Fig: 8). Equipped with de-rated Mirrlees JVS12T engines, the M1s of A1A-A1A wheel arrangement and of weight 88 tons, with 34,000 lbf starting and 25,000 lbf continuous tractive efforts, displayed some phenomenal haulage feats. These locomotives were to have a significant impact not just on the railways of Ceylon, but on the British diesel scene as well. Despite the partnership of Brush-Bagnall never having produced a main line diesel locomotive before, the M1s after much initial teething problems, but thanks to the efforts of the Brush engineers and the ingenuity of that celebrated railwayman B D Rampala, settled down to accumulate some 30 million miles on the island’s railways before withdrawal in the early 1980s. Brush, on the strength of the units produced for Ceylon, later went on to become Britain’s most successful Diesel locomotive manufacturer.\n\nIn 1954, the first batch of the legendary Class M2 General Motors (GM) Electro Motive Division (EMD) built locomotives of 1,425 hp was gifted by Canada (Refer Fig: 9). These were the export version G12 of that unrivalled machine, the GP7 produced by EMD for the North American market in the late 1940s. The first five locomotives arrived factory painted in two-tone orange and maroon livery, but later were re-painted locally in a striking three-tone scheme of silver, light blue and dark blue with a ‘smile’ at the ends. The Class powered by EMD’s fabled 12-567B two stroke engine and weighing 79 tons producing a starting tractive effort of 38,000 lbf, ultimately grew to 14 in total with the later units purchased by the Sri Lankan Railways. Of A1A-A1A wheel arrangement, two units were constructed as Bo-Bo, specially adapted to the Up-country Main Line. Thought by many to be the most reliable locomotive seen on Ceylon’s railways, all but one are said to be in service still after some sixty odd years, a tribute no doubt to the workmanship and quality of EMD, who dominated the world diesel locomotive scene for well-nigh sixty odd years.\n\nMention needs to be made of two locally built diesel electric locomotives in 1956, the Class M3 of 360 hp, for shunting purposes. Each of these utilised twin engines from the withdrawn S1 Class diesel multiple units.\n\nThe suburban services around the Colombo area were dieselised with the importation of 45 diesel multiple units (DMUs) (‘power sets’ as termed in Sri Lanka) with hydraulic drive (Classes S2 to S4) from MAN in Germany and Schindler in Switzerland over the years 1956 to 1962. The S2 were powered by 800 hp Maybach MD435V8 engines while the S3 and S4 had 880 hp MAN V12 L12V18 and 1,000 hp MAN V12 L12V21 engines respectively. These four car DMUs with a power car at one end were capable of quick acceleration and rapid turn-around and coupled with Centralised Traffic Control immensely enhanced the commuter services in the region.\n\nThe difficulty in keeping the still considerable steam fleet operating and the costs involved, caused the railway, in a somewhat hasty and later to be proved ill-conceived move, to import 60 diesel hydraulic locomotives in 1969, almost totally eliminating steam working. 45 of these (Class W1 of 1,200 hp) came from Henschel of West Germany and 15 (Class W2 of 1,600 hp) from VEB of East Germany, both Classes having high-revving British Paxman Valenta engines, 12YJXL in the W1s and 16YJXLs in the W2s. Sadly, all had working lives of little over 20 years. It is a proven fact in railway circles that diesel electric transmission is far superior to diesel hydraulics in terms of performance and longevity. Most countries of the world have opted in the main for electric transmission, except, not surprisingly, in Germany where Hermann Fottinger first designed a hydraulic transmission in 1905. A few W1s had been re-engined with Caterpillar diesels that appear to have extended their lives. A fleet of 28, 530 hp diesel hydraulic shunters (Class Y) with Rolls-Royce DV8 engines were obtained in 1969 from the famed builder Hunslet of UK to replace the G2s and the few remaining steam E1s. 1972 witnessed the unveiling of 8 locally built diesel hydraulic shunters (Class Y1) with 1,000 hp Paxman engines, a bold and if not, a commendable venture.\n\nThe next few decades resulted in the Sri Lankan Railways, no doubt hastened by the poorly performing diesel hydraulics, procuring a multitude of diesel electric locomotives and multiple units of varying makes. Often the choice of locomotives had been dictated by availability of credit facilities and whims of donor countries, a choice not conducive to the appropriate type of machine suited for the required service being procured. The Canadian built MLW 1,750 hp Co-Co Class M4s arrived in 1975, the Japanese Hitachi 1,600 hp Bo-Bo Class M5s and German Henschel 1,650 hp A1A-A1A Class M6s in 1979 and the British Brush 1,000 hp Bo-Bo Class M7s in 1981. The heavy 94 ton M4s were installed with the evergreen ALCO 12-251C3 engines while the M5s originally had MTU-Ikegai 12V652TD11 engines. The 66 ton M5s suffered from poor adhesion and unreliable power units and some were later re-engined with MTU V12M5B and Paxman Valenta 12YJXL engines. Both M6s and M7s had the renowned EMD engines, 12-645E in the M6s and 8-645E in the M7s.\n\nFresh Developments\n\nIn 1996, the Indian firm DLW supplied eight 2,800 hp Co-Co ALCO locomotives (Class M8), based on the ALCOs which form the backbone of the vast Indian Railway diesel fleet. Fitted out with the obsolescent ALCO V16 251-B engine they weighed 112 tons with a length of 56’. Two of the Class were equipped with V12 2,200 hp engines and shorter bogies intended for the Up-country Main Line. However trials on that line had been unsuccessful. The Class M9 French built Alstom 100 ton Co-Co locomotives of 2,500 hp saw service in 2000 (Refer Fig: 10). Powered by Ruston 12RK215T engines de-rated from 3,200 hp, they were based on Alstom’s well-known ‘Prima’ range of AC drive locomotives. With starting tractive efforts approaching 60,000 lbf from their state-of-the-art AC drives, these highly sophisticated machines were soon rendered inoperative due to their need for exacting maintenance and exorbitant cost of spares, the harsh and dusty environment and somewhat lacking capabilities of the Sri Lankan railways contributing in no small measure to the sad state of affairs. A few of the locomotives are understood to be refurbished currently with assistance from the Arthur C Clerk Centre for Technology. Beginning from 2012, DLW of India has also provided nine more ALCO Co-Co diesel electrics of 2,500 hp (Class M10) (Refer Fig: 11). At 117 tons and 61’ length, these are the heaviest and longest diesels to run on the island’s railways.\n\nThe Class Y, M4, M6, M7, M8 and M10 have performed adequately and are the only classes still in regular operation, not forgetting the renowned EMD M2s which are into their seventh decade of operation. It is a compliment to the dedication of the railway personnel involved that such an ageing and assorted fleet can be kept afloat despite inadequacies of resources and funding. Nevertheless, it appears that the M2, M6 and M7 classes of advancing years are the only locomotives from the current operating fleet that are able to traverse the steep and curvaceous Up-country Main Line, the weight and wheelbase of the others precluding them from doing so.\n\nFurther purchases of hydraulic drive DMUs (Classes S5 to S8) continued to be made for the commuter services between 1970 and 1991, this time all from Hitachi of Japan. Of these, only the Class S8 are still in operation. The S8s are powered by German MTU V12396TC13 engines of 1,413 hp. The railway’s penchant for hydraulic transmissions came to an end in 2000 when the Class S9 DMUs that came from the China South Locomotive and Rolling Stock Corporation (CSLRSC) were equipped with diesel electric transmission. With 1,580 hp MTU V12396TC14 engines and vestibule connections for the first time in DMUs, these six unit sets displayed swift acceleration and were a boon to the commuter services. The Class S10 followed in 2008 from the same manufacturer with even more MTU power from V12 4000R41 engines of 1,950 hp.\n\nThe S11 and S12 DMUs that were imported from India and China in 2011 and 2012 respectively marked a watershed in the annals of the Sri Lankan Railways’ operational protocols. These DMUs came equipped for long distance passenger operation, complete with vestibule connections, transverse seating, toilet facilities and air suspension. The Indian S11s have Cummins KTA50L V16 engines of 1,350 hp. The S12s manufactured by the China South Locomotive and Rolling Stock Corporation (CSLRSC) are powered by V12 4000R41 engines of 1,950 hp in common with the earlier S10s (Refer Fig: 12). A typical S12 long distance ten unit train consists of power cars at either end, grossing nearly 4,000 hp with air conditioned accommodation on 1st Class. Sadly it also spelt the death knell for most of the named locomotive hauled expresses, much loved by the travelling public, now replaced by these ubiquitous DMUs of unremarkable character.\n\nIn recent years it appears the Sri Lankan Railways have faced a monumental struggle in attempting to maintain a scheduled and dependable regular service, despite the arrival of new rolling stock. Additional to concerns on rolling stock, despite much new track being laid to places such as the North, the existing track in most areas are in a parlous state, requiring speed restrictions and slow running with disruption to services. Neglect, mismanagement, lack of funding, skewed priorities have all contributed towards this unacceptable situation. It is reliably learnt that the railways are contemplating the purchase of a batch of new locomotives from that iconic builder EMD. Though not of North American origin as in the case of the M2s, these locomotives are said to be EMDs (no longer GM owned, but now with Caterpillar) of Indian build. It is hoped the Up-country Line will once again reverberate to the familiar deep two stroke engine throb and echo of multi-chime horns of EMD locomotives and the new units will live up to the reliability and durability of that legendary moniker, breathing fresh life into the island’s ailing railways. Of course track rehabilitation too needs to keep pace if this is to be a reality.\n\nP.S. – Latest Developments\n\nThe EMD locomotives referred to above did arrive over the years 2018/19 (total 10) from DLW in Varanasi, India. Classed M11, fitted with EMD 12-710G engines and AC drive and of Co-Co wheel arrangement, they pack a whopping 3,000 hp and are a modified variant of the Indian domestic model WDG4D (Refer Fig:13). Complete with double-ended twin cabs of ‘dog-bone’ layout and with a weight of 130 tons and length nearly 70 ft, they are about the biggest locomotives to run on the island’s rails. Reports indicate their operation has been fraught with major issues, notably a tendency for the units to derail. “Jane’s World Railways” indicates a maximum axle loading of 18 tons for the Sri Lankan Railways. The M11’s axle loading of nearly 22 tons and considerable length may be factors in their disappointing and unacceptable performance.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020 the SLR also took delivery of new diesel electric DMUs suitable for long-distance express passenger services. These are the S13 and S14 Classes manufactured by ICF in India and CRRC of China respectively (Refer Figs: 14 & 15). A standard set of the S13 comprises a total of 11 coaches with twin power cars at either end, each installed with Cummins QSK45L engines of 1,800 hp and AC drive. The S14 power cars possess MTU Model 12V4000R41 engines of 1,950 hp, and the sets have air suspension.\n\nPhotographs: Fig 1, courtesy of ‘Lankapura’\n\nFigs 2, 3 & 5, courtesy of ‘Flickr’\n\nFigs 4, 6 & 11 courtesy of Basil Roberts\n\nFigs 7, 10 & 12 courtesy of ‘Wikipedia’\n\nFigs 8 & 9 courtesy of ‘Railpage Sri Lanka’\n\nRemembering the Railway’s Three Sisters\n\nThe prudent railway engineer and general manager of the railways B.D. Rampala came up with the brilliant idea to launch three trains to three popular destinations. These three trains were lovingly known as the Railway Sisters of Ceylon.\n\nWhen we pause to reflect on the past, it generously offers us a deeper insight to appreciate the present. Travelling by train is a lovely experience that all Sri Lankans enjoy. The dazzling views of the villages, mountains, green fields and beaches will leave you with splendid memories. The beautiful old railway stations are an iconic reminder of the golden days of train travel in Ceylon.\n\nBy 1845 the Ceylon Railway Company (CRC) was formed. The new railway projects were full of challenges: there were rocks to be blasted, water clogged lands had to be filled and tunnels to be bored. Railway bridges would spring up in rural areas. In 1861, the Ceylon Railway Company was terminated and the Ceylon Government Railway (CGR) formed.\n\nWe now fast forward to 1956 when plans were made to enhance train journeys and reduce travel time. The prudent railway engineer and general manager of the railways B.D. Rampala came up with the brilliant idea to launch three trains to three popular destinations. These three trains were lovingly known as the Railway Sisters of Ceylon. These ‘iron maidens’ were the Udarata Menike (Main Line from Colombo to Badulla), Yal Devi (Northern Line from Colombo to Jaffna) and Ruhunu Kumari (Coastal Line from Colombo to Matara). All of these trains were launched in April 1956, on the same day. They operate to this day, with modern changes to both trains and tracks.\n\nUdarata Menike\n\nThe Udarata Menike is endorsed by travellers as one of the best railway journeys in Asia, traversing mist-covered hills and lush green tea estates. This 10-hour journey has captivated thousands of schoolchildren. The train negotiates steep gradients adding an aura of adventure. It is testament to the commitment of the CGR men who worked hard to lay rail tracks.\n\nThe need for railways in Ceylon was mooted by a request for the transportation of coffee by European planters. The planters pressured the Governor to provide a rail line for transporting their coffee to Colombo. Upon calling for tenders, the selected contractor was W.F.G. Faviell. Building the Main Line was not easy. These lands had to be surveyed and maps drawn. By 1864, the first phase of the main line was ready, from Colombo to Ambepussa. The belching iron locomotive thundered down the tracks, spewing out flecks of charcoal.\n\nUnder the initiative of Sir Lindsey Molesworth, the first Director General of the CGR, the tracks were extended, reaching Kandy (1867), Nawalapitiya (1874), Nanu Oya (1885), Bandarawela (1894) and finally, Badulla (1924). The entire mission of laying rail tracks took 60 years. In the 1950s under the Colombo Plan initiative. It was one of these powerful engines that hauled the Udarata Menike on her first uphill journey on April 23, 1956.\n\nThe home base of the Udarata Menike is the Fort Railway Station. Since her inception 64 years ago, she always leaves the Fort Station from Platform No 3. The train covers a staggering 62 railway stations and cruises through 42 tunnels. Of these tunnels, the longest is Pool Bank (locals call it the ‘Singha Malai’ tunnel). It covers 562 metres and is located between Hatton and Kotagala. From Rambukkana the train begins her upward haul. At this point, an extra Pilot Engine is used to push the train from the rear guard’s carriage.\n\nToday, the Udarata Menike is powered by Chinese built Class S12 Diesel engines. The scenic route from Nawalapitya continues up to Watawala, Hatton, Great Western, Nanu Oya, Pattipola, Ohiya, Haputale, Diyatalawa and Bandarawela.\n\nFrom here, the iron princess gracefully begins her descent to Ella, Demodara and finally reaches her terminus station at Badulla. The Demodara station and its underpass loop are a marvel of Sri Lankan railway engineering.\n\nThe Nine Arch Bridge between Ella and Demodara is another engineering feat of that era. With the onset of World War I, the iron allocated for the project was reassigned for British war efforts. Therefore local contractor P.K. Appuhamy had to finish the task with stone, brick and cement. This bridge is 300 feet in length.\n\nAnother feature on the Main Line is the ‘tablet’ system. This is an innovative British safety system still in operation. From Kadugannawa the Station Master hands over a ‘tablet’ (a steel disc attached to a hoop) to the Engine Driver. This is handed down in a relay to corresponding stations. It facilitates the movement of the semaphore signal system. Pattipola is the highest point on the Main Line, nestled at an altitude of 6,225 feet.\n\nYal Devi\n\nSeeing clusters of palmyrah trees rising into the skyline is part of the long journey from Colombo to Jaffna. For decades, the Yal Devi has been a cultural bridge, fostering ties between North and South. There was a need to extend the railway line to Jaffna from Polgahawela. After years of surveying and intense labour, the track was laid. The Jaffna station was built in 1902. The first train reached Jaffna in 1905.\n\nDuring these early stages of the Northern Line, the entire journey covering 256 miles took 13 hours. There were 83 stations on this line. Almost 50 years after the inception of the Northern Line, the CGR introduced the concept of express trains to Ceylon. On April 23, 1956 the Yal Devi, painted in blue and white, completed her maiden run to Jaffna clocking exactly seven hours. The previous 13-hour journey was now thankfully reduced.\n\nThe launch of the Yal Devi express train would change the social and cultural fabric forever. CGR records indicate that during the 1970s, there were almost 6,000 people who travelled to Colombo and Jaffna daily on the Yal Devi, netting the highest revenue to the railways. The Jaffna youth got down bicycles transported on the goods wagon. The Yal Devi also brought patients to Colombo seeking the advice of medical experts. This happens even today.\n\nDuring the tenure of former President and current Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, steps were taken to reconstruct the damaged Northern Line. Hundreds of men worked day and night to install the tracks and the signal systems. The Jaffna station was beautifully restored. The project was completed in October 2014, and when the Yal Devi reached Jaffna station, jubilant citizens gathered to witness her arrival.\n\nRuhunu Kumari\n\nThe Ruhunu Kumari is the railway princess of the South. She is the third railway sister. Since 1956, she has connected the citizens of the Southern Province to Colombo. She is the iron star of the coastal line. The coastal line begins at Maradana and moves down to Fort passing through Kalutara, Katukurunda, Paiyagala North and South, Maggona, Beruwela, Aluthgama, Induruwa, Kosgoda, Balapitiya, Ambalangoda, Hikkaduwa, Dodanduwa, Gintota, Galle, Talpe, Ahangama, Weligama, Kamburugamuwa and Matara. Passengers taking this long route are blessed with picturesque views of rivers, estuaries and pristine beaches. In the old days, Europeans had stopped to visit the village of Moratuwa which thrived in the manufacture of furniture. These carpenters also made wooden tea chests. These boxes were transferred by train to the tea estates. Little did the carpenters of Moratuwa realize their silent contribution towards the country’s tea industry.\n\nThe large iron bridge signals that the train is crossing towards Kalutara. Passing Beruwela one could see the 122 foot high Imperial Light House. Galle was the once the main town of the Southern Province, and has a large station with a Signal Cabin. Today, the Ruhunu Kumari operates to the Beliatta station. Operating the three trains requires teamwork. The trains are serviced by nine sub divisions – Transport ( includes Guard service), Railway Stores, Stations Branch, Motive Power Sub Unit, Mechanical Ways and Works, Signal Telecommunication, Commercial Section, Security (Railway Protection Force) and Accounts. The railway sisters have served millions of passengers over the decades.\n\n==================================================\n\nTravel on an important island Railway system (Circa 1935) – Rail Transport in Ceylon\n\nRAILWAYS OF THE EMPIRE – 17\n\nCEYLON, one of the most interesting islands in the world, is an important British Crown Colony. For sport, big game shooting, pleasure, and historic interest there are few places which surpass this delightful island. Whether the visitor has plenty of time at his disposal or has only a few hours while his ship is in port, Ceylon has much to offer that is unique. Colombo, the capital and chief port, lies on the west coast. There are in the fine harbour rarely fewer than two or three liners on their way to and from all parts of the world, and the tropical luxuriance of the town and suburbs makes a drive round in rickshaw or motor car a pleasure not easily forgotten.\n\nThe Government-owned railways stretch over the greater part of the island, except the south-east coast; in the jungle districts they form practically the only available means of communication. There are 951 miles of railway, and of these 834 are broad gauge (5 ft 6-in) and 117 narrow gauge (2 ft 6-in).\n\nA PICTURESQUE SCENE on the South Coast Line of the Ceylon Government Railways. This photograph shows a section of the 5 ft 6-in gauge double-track line running through typical scenery near Mount Lavinia.\n\nThe principal lines radiate from Colombo. These are the West Coast Line, running north along the coast to Puttalam; the Northern Line, via Polgahawela, Maho, and Madawachchi to Talaimannar; the Main Line, from Polgahawela to Peradeniya, Nanuoya, and Badulla; and the South Coast Line to Galle and Matara. From Madawachchi, on the Northern Line, a branch runs to Jaffna and Kankesanturai, on the north coast. From Maho the Eastern Line runs to Gal-Oya, where it forks, one section running to Trincomalee and the other to Batticaloa. From Peradeniya, on the Main Line, a branch runs via Kandy to Matale. The narrow-gauge sections are from Colombo to Yatiyantota and to Opanake, and from Nanuoya, on the Main Line, to Nuwara Eliya and Ragalla.\n\nThe country traversed by the Coast and Northern Lines is fairly flat, but the Main and Eastern Lines have to cross ridges between the valleys of the rivers, while the lines above Rambukkana (on the Main Line east of Polgahawela) and in the upper reaches of the Kelaniya Valley have a series of sharp reverse curves between the hills and on the hillsides. The principal bridges are over the Pandura Lagoon, Kalu Ganga, and Bentota and Gin Ganga Rivers on the Coast Lines; over the Kelaniya and Maha Oya rivers on the Main Line; and over the Mahaweli Ganga and the Valaichchenai Estuary on the Eastern Line. Several short tunnels are encountered on the up-country Main Line. The rails are spiked direct to wooden sleepers, suitable local hardwood being used where available, but the majority of sleepers in use are of jarrah wood from Western Australia.\n\nThe total number of broad- and narrow-gauge locomotives in service is 270. The principal classes are the 4-6-0 super-heater tank engines, while there is a “Garratt” locomotive working on the Kadugannawa Incline, on the Main Line between Polgahawela and Peradeniya. Running sheds with repair shops are located at the three divisional headquarters and at Nanuoya. In all there are twenty-seven running sheds on the system. The coaching stock consists of 921 carriages and thirty rail-cars, some of which are “Sentinels” and others petrol cars. Freight stock consists of nearly 4,000 wagons, most of which are of the covered type, and of 13 tons capacity; the bogie stock is of 37 tons capacity. The main locomotive, carriage, and wagon workshops were formerly situated at Maradana (Colombo), but they have now been transferred to Ratmalana, where some 3,000 men are employed.\n\nAll stations on double-line sections are fully signalled and interlocked, points and signals being worked from the signal box in accordance with British practice, block working being on the lock and block system. Many of the principal stations are completely track-circuited between the outermost stop signals.\n\nThe Main Line from Rambukkana to Peradeniya and the section thence to Kandy are also fully signalled and interlocked. The single line block working of the railway is by Tyers Tablet system.\n\nTHE CEYLON GOVERNMENT RAILWAYS, which have their system centred on Colombo, have 834 miles of 5 ft 6 in gauge track open, and 117 miles of 2 ft 6 in gauge. The first section of line was opened in 1865\n\nA through service is provided between Ceylon and India. Through trains run from Colombo to Talaimannar, whence ferry steamers convey passengers and goods over the twenty-two miles across Palk Strait to Dannshkodi, and thence to all parts of India. Palk Strait is almost bridged by a line of coral reefs and sandbanks known as Adam’s Bridge, partly utilized by the railway to Talaimannar. For travellers to India who elect to go overland from Colombo the journey of 323 miles through Ceylon is one of great interest. Comfortable modern carriages are provided on the trains, including refreshment and sleeping cars, the latter equipped with bedding – not a universal provision in this part of the world.\n\nThe first place of importance on the Northern Line is Polgahawela, forty-five miles from Colombo. Here the line bifurcates, one portion (continuation of the Northern Line) going north to Maho Junction and the other (the Main Line) south-east to Peradeniya and the up-country section. A few miles farther on is Kurunegala, the administrative centre of the North-West Province of Ceylon. From Maho the Eastern Line branches off north-east to Trincomalee and to Batticaloa, two ports on the east coast. Some forty miles north of Maho is Anuradhapura, an ancient city of great historic interest which contains buildings erected 2,000 years ago, when it was at the zenith of its glory. The city is sacred to the Buddhists. At full moon every month hundreds of worshippers visit the shrines and temples. In June the annual “Poson” Festival is held, and thousands of pilgrims from all parts of Ceylon visit the city to pay homage to Buddha.\n\nAnuradhapura is 127 miles from Colombo, and is the headquarters of the northern division of the railway. In recent years the station goods depot and locomotive yard have been remodelled, and an island platform and modern offices have taken the place of the old platforms and buildings. There is also a separate pilgrim camp station, with sidings and connexions. The new locomotive yard includes a running shed, machine shop, coal stage, and carriage and wagon sidings.\n\nA few miles north of Anuradhapura is Madawachchi. Here connexion is made with trains tor the Jaffna Peninsula, the terminus of the line being Kankesanturai, situated at the most northerly point of Ceylon and 114 miles from Madawachchi. Jaffna is a large Government centre. In the town is an old Dutch fort, a relic of the days when not only Ceylon but also many parts of Southern India were under Dutch influence. The town carries on a brisk trade in tobacco, rice, and other products. The country around is peopled by Tamils, a hardworking and industrious race, but the arid nature of the soil makes cultivation extremely difficult. Kankesanturai is a health resort, with good sea-bathing.\n\nTHE RAILWAY IN THE EAST. A view of Kandy Railway Station showing a familiar feature of the East, the rickshaws with their native runners. Special trains are often run to Kandy, the ancient capital of Ceylon, when thousands of people travel to see the religious festivals held there. The station lies on a branch line diverging from the Main Line at Peradeniya.\n\nThe country north-west of Madawachchi consists of dense jungle, in which wild beasts may be seen in the glare of the engine headlights. Madhu Road is a lonely jungle station which wakes into life three times a year on the occasion of the Roman Catholic Festivals. Twenty-two miles farther on is Mannar, a provincial Government centre, and seventeen miles beyond Mannar Talaimannar Pier is reached, where the train runs up alongside the boat. For the last part of the journey the railway runs along Adam’s Bridge, which appears as a dry sandy desert punctuated by solitary palm trees.\n\nFrom Maho Junction, eighty-five miles from Colombo on the Northern Line just described, the Eastern Line runs north-east to Gal-Oya, where it continues in the same direction to Trincomalee (183 miles), while another line runs south-east to Batticaloa. These sections were opened only a few years ago, and to both places the railway passes through dense jungle which effectually shuts off the view on either side. Trincomalee, a naval base, is situated on one of the largest natural harbours in the world, large enough to contain the whole of the British Navy.\n\nOn the way from Gal-Oya Junction to Batticaloa is Polonnaruwa, an ancient city and former capital of Ceylon. It contains remains of temples, palaces, and monasteries, also a wonderful altar and figure of Buddha cut out of the solid rock. In recent years, through the excellent work of the Archaeological Survey, the city has been restored to view from the mass of ruins and jungle growth in which it was found.\n\nTwenty Miles of Climbing\n\nBeyond Polonnaruwa and about twenty miles from Batticaloa the railway emerges from the jungle, and passes through groves of coco-nut palms, from which copra, the staple product of the district, is obtained. Batticaloa is a small port and the distributing centre for the rice and coco-nut products of the district.\n\nThe Main Line, forming the railway route to the hilly portion of Ceylon, branches at Polgahawela from the Northern Line to Talaimannar. The station at Polgahawela has two island platforms connected by footbridges, a goods shed, and a depot run by the Immigration Department for the resting and feeding of the coolies who arrive by the boat trains before distributing them to their various destinations.\n\nSoon after leaving Polgahawela the railway begins to climb the Kadugannawa Incline, which rises in a distance of twenty miles from 126 ft to 1,690 ft above sea-level, the ruling gradient being 1 in 44. Beyond Rambukkana the limiting curve is ten chains (660 ft) radius and above Nawalapitiya five chains (330 ft). The low speed up the incline affords the traveller an opportunity of seeing the gorgeous hill scenery to advantage. The railway track is cut out of the solid rock on the sides of the hills, and at times there is a sheer drop of 1,000 ft to the plains below, while the view, as the train climbs higher and higher, is continually changing. At the top of the incline is Kadugannawa Station, where the banking engines are stabled.\n\nPeradeniya is the junction for the line to Kandy and Matale. In the Botanical Gardens at Peradeniya may be seen growing nutmegs, cloves, pepper, cinnamon, and other spices. There are also in the gardens some wonderful avenues of palm trees, all exactly the same height.\n\nKandy is the ancient capital of Ceylon. Built round an artificial lake, the town lies in a hollow surrounded by towering tree-covered hills. At the side of the lake stands the sacred Temple of the Tooth containing relics of the Buddha, including the sacred tooth, which is carried in procession at the religious festivals. Kandy, besides being the capital of the central province and an important Government centre, has a considerable trade in brass, silver, and lacquer ware. It has two good hotels and some modern shops.\n\nA “SENTINEL-CAMMELL” STEAM RAIL COACH operating on the 5 ft 6-in gauge lines of Ceylon. The seating capacity is fifty-eight third-class and eight first-class passengers. The weight of the coach, including seated passengers and baggage, is 32¾ tons, and its length is 56 ft. The diameter of the wheels is 2 ft 6-in. The six-cylinder engine has a designed output of 130 brake-horse-power.\n\nAt Katugastota, the next place along the route to Matale, as many as thirty elephants may frequently be seen bathing after their day’s work, some being cleaned by their mahouts (keepers) and others enjoying themselves by rolling over and over in the water. Matale, the end of the branch line and seventeen miles from Kandy, produces rubber, cocoa, and tea in large quantities. The railway runs through groves of cocoa trees, the various coloured pods of which are strikingly picturesque.\n\nThe most beautiful scenery in Ceylon is that through which the Main Line runs up-country from Peradeniya to Badulla. The terraced paddy fields on the lower levels gradually give place to bolder scenery as the line rises rapidly until it reaches the summit level at Pattipola, 6,226 ft above sea-level. Nawalapitiya is the divisional, headquarters of the railway. From this point the route is through tea plantations. The hill-sides are covered with tea bushes, and the estates are all dotted with factories, bungalows, and towns where tea planting is the staple industry.\n\nAt Hatton, the next station, hundreds of pilgrims detrain to undertake the arduous climb of Adam’s Peak – the sacred mountain – on which is said to be a footprint of Buddha. From the summit (7,353 ft) at sunrise the shadow of the mountain can be seen on the clouds below, a phenomenon which induces many to pass the night at the top to await the rising sun.\n\nA Popular Resort\n\nAt the junction of Nanuoya the tea plantations end, to be succeeded by alternate thick jungle and open rice fields intersected by streams which furnish excellent trout fishing during the summer months.\n\nNanuoya is the junction for the branch to Nuwara Eliya, to which in the months of March, April, and May all who can migrate from Colombo. Nuwara Eliya is reached by a narrow-gauge (2 ft 6-in) railway, with a ruling gradient of 1 in 26. This popular resort is situated 6,198 ft above sea-level, and its climate is the nearest approach to that of England, being cold, bracing, and healthy. Colombo’s humidity and uniformity temperature are very trying and make a stay in the hill country of great benefit to health. The social life of this beautiful place banishes boredom and monotony. Easter is the height of the season, and racing, golf and tennis tournaments, bridge, and dances provide recreation and amusement for the visitors. Nuwara Eliya is also a favourite residence for retired people, who find that money goes farther here than in the capital, or at any rate procures more comfort and more social life. The branch line ends at Ragalla.\n\nReturning to the broad-gauge line, the summit level is reached at Pattipola, in the heart of the jungle. Beyond the summit tunnel the jungle gives place to open country, with hills and valleys dotted with numerous villages. When the train is passing Haputale Station an extensive view across the low country to the south coast may be obtained, and on a fine night the lights of ships passing fifty or sixty miles away can be distinguished.\n\nBuildng the Deduru Oya Bridge:\n\nThe Deduru Oya bridge on the line to Puttalam. The West Coast Line runs north to Puttalam from Colombo, along the West Coast of Ceylon. The Deduru Oya Bridge has five spans each of 150 ft.\n\nAt Diyatalawa are rest camps for men of the Army and Navy, and Bandarawela is another of Ceylon’s health resorts, to which dwellers of Colombo flock during the hot season. Twenty-four miles farther, and still on a falling gradient, the railway reaches Badulla, the terminus and the capital of the province of Uva, where more tea plantations are to be found.\n\nThe Kelaniya Valley Railway serves a large rubber-growing district. As the traveller passes through the district by train he will see from time to time plantations of tall trees with slanting cuts across the bark near the base, from which exudes a white milky fluid. These are rubber plantations, basis of another great industry of Ceylon. The rubber tree, which attains an average height of eighty feet, flourishes best in a humid tropical climate where the rainfall averages from 150 to 175-in per annum and at elevations from sea-level to 1,000 feet. Land that has been virgin jungle is, when cleared, the type most suitable for planting purposes.\n\nThe South Coast Line is double to Kalutara, and the first important station from Colombo Fort is Slave Island, which is close to the ice and cold storage factories. Up and down platforms connected by an overhead bridge are provided. Farther down the line is Mount Lavinia, a popular seaside resort where excellent bathing is obtainable. Moratuwa, the first combined passenger and freight station, is a watering station, situated thirteen miles from Maradana. Beyond, the railway runs through groves of coco-nut palms to Galle, the capital of the Southern Province and noted for its tortoiseshell ware. Matara, ninety-nine miles from Colombo, is the present terminus of the South Coast Line, but it is proposed to extend the railway to Tangalla, farther along the coast. Both Galle and Matara were formerly Dutch, and at the former remains of the old fort and city are still standing.\n\nThe central station at Colombo is Colombo Fort, which deals with passengers and parcels only. There are several platforms and the usual public facilities are provided at platform level. The platforms, which are all roofed, are connected by a foot-bridge at either end.\n\nMaradana Station, the junction for the Northern and West Coast lines, is situated between the locomotive running shed and the Colombo main wagon depot. The station building consists of two wings connected by an overhead bridge.\n\nColombo Goods Station is the chief receiving station for freight traffic and consists of two outward and three inward warehouses and two sheds for the storage of tea chests and fibre respectively. There are also direct delivery sidings, one being at the lake front, where goods are delivered direct into barges. Other sidings are for delivery of bricks, fibre, and other goods. The goods sheds are in charge of a goods agent, with the assistance of warehousemen and a large staff of clerks, checkers, and policemen. The traffic handled yearly is over 300,000 tons, both inwards and outwards.\n\nColombo Port and Wharf are freight stations situated in the harbour area in the Port Commission premises and deal with import and export traffic. The allocation and dispatch of wagons are in charge of a “Trains and Goods Officer” under the harbour engineer, while loading, freighting, and accounting are performed by officers and checkers of the Transportation Department.\n\nThe business quarter of Colombo is known as the “Fort”, in which abound native shops containing jewellery, silks, and curios for the enticement of tourists. The real Colombo, however, does not lie there any more than it lies in the great hotels, but in the native quarter, or “Pettah”. Here, in narrow teeming streets in which the shops open from the pavement and strange odours fill the air, white-clad people hurry to and fro.\n\nThe Kala Oya Bridge, a substantial structure on the line to Trincomalee and Batticaloa. The ports of Trincomalee and Batticaloa are linked up with the main railway system by the Eastern Line, which leaves the Northern Line at Maho Junction\n\nLeading from the Fort to the outer part of the town is the renowned Galle Face Drive, running for a distance of a mile along the edge of the sea. The suburbs of Colombo stretch far out amid magnificent avenues of giant trees. The district known as Cinnamon Gardens, formerly covered with groves of cinnamon, is about three miles from the town, and is a favourite residential quarter, with pink or white-washed bungalows of unusual appearance. Coco-nut groves are everywhere, and flaming bougainvillaea and poinsettia add vivid touches of colour to the landscape.\n\nA large volume of suburban traffic is handled within a twenty-five miles radius of Colombo. The trains are used chiefly by the clerical staff employed in Government and mercantile offices, and by a large number of workmen.\n\nSuburban traffic is heavy on the coast-line between Colombo and Mount Lavinia, the distance of about nine miles containing five stations. On the narrow-gauge line there is an intensive traffic up to Nugegoda, a distance of five and a half miles. On the Northern Line up to Ragama, nine miles, and on the West Coast Line up to Jaela, thirteen miles, suburban traffic also is very heavy.\n\nThe peak periods of the rush into Colombo are between 7.30 and 9.30am, and out of Colombo from 4.30pm to 5.30pm. To deal with this traffic local suburban trains on the coast-line are run at intervals varying from five to fifteen minutes, terminals being Mount Lavinia and Moratuwa. On the Northern Line suburban trains are run out as far as Ragama, Gampaha, Veyangoda, and reversed at these points.\n\nThe religious festivals are a great feature of Ceylon railway traffic. The seven days in June during which the “Poson” Festival at Anuradhapura lasts tax the resources of the railway to the utmost, as many as 50,000 pilgrims travelling by rail on this occasion. For the Roman Catholic Festival at Madhu fully as many pilgrims may travel by the railway to Madhu Road. There are also the Harvest Festival at Kandy early in the year, and the “Esala Perahera” in August, the latter lasting thirteen days and drawing thousands of pilgrims from all parts of Ceylon.\n\nThe Kandy Festival of the New Rice (“Alutsal Perahera”) takes place on the full moon day in January each year. In the temple village of Gurudeniya, a short distance away, where rice crops are raised, the tenants of the Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth) have to set apart each year a portion of the harvest as an offering to the sacred Temple of the Tooth and other shrines in Kandy. This was an order of a former king of Kandy when granting the land, and has been obeyed for centuries.\n\nThe procession of elephants, tom-tom drummers, oboe players, temple officials, and servitors proceeds to Kandy, where the distribution of the “Alutsal” or new rice is made. The dancers in the procession are dressed in every imaginable costume, and perform marvellous evolutions while the playing of the oboe, the drumming of the tom-toms, and the banging of the kettledrums create an unearthly din. Many thousands of people come to Kandy to see the festival, and special trains are run to accommodate them. The “Esala Perahera” in August draws an even greater number of people, and the whole town rejoices for several days. Several other religious festivals require special train arrangements, but not on such an extensive scale.\n\nStandard Sinhalese express locomotives are of the 4-6-0 type, as stated earlier in this chapter. They have a peculiarity in that they are fitted with side tanks in addition to their tenders, giving them a high water capacity and an increased adhesion weight. Cowcatchers are invariably fitted, as the forests of Ceylon contain all manner of wild animals, and powerful headlights are mounted in front of the chimneys.\n\nMOUNT LAVINIA STATION in south-west Ceylon. There is heavy suburban traffic on the coast line between Colombo, the capital, and Mount Lavinia. There are five stations on the nine miles stretch between the two towns. The trains are used chiefly by the clerical staff in Government and mercantile offices, and by labourers.\n\nThe predecessors of these engines, from the earliest days until comparatively recently, were of the 4-4-0 type with outside cylinders, in appearance slightly reminiscent of those belonging to the North Eastern Railway in the ’seventies of the last century. For years these locomotives worked express trains on the level sea-coast section between Colombo and Galle. Sinhalese passenger coaches are a curious mixture of Eastern and Western practice. Their general arrangement resembles that of British passenger stock, but they naturally have to be provided with sun-shades to the windows, and various other devices for minimizing the effect of the fierce sun.\n\nRecently the Ceylon Government Railways have had some 880hp Diesel-electric locomotives built for hauling the broad gauge “Indian Mail” expresses. They are of the 1-CO-1 type; that is to say, they each have six uncoupled driving wheels with independent drive, and two carrying wheels at either end. They have been built on the Tyneside by Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co. (Engineers), Ltd."
