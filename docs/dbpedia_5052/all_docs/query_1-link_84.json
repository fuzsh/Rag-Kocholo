Brunel had argued that his design offered higher speeds, smoother\n\nrunning, more stability, and increased comfort for passengers when compared to standard-\n\ngauge railways. In many ways he was right, but the spread of the standard gauge not\n\nonly in Britain but also in many other parts of the world, including North\n\nAmerica, led to Brunel’s broad gauge becoming an anachronism.\n\nThe GWR’s last broad-gauge train ran on 21 May 1892.\n\nl GWR Fireﬂy Class Designed by Daniel Gooch, Fireﬂy was one of\n\nFire Fly, 1840 61 express passenger locomotives built for the\n\nGreat Western Railway by various builders\n\nWheel arrangement 4-2-2 between 1840 and 1842.

It operates at Didcot Railway Centre.\n\nl GWR Iron Duke Class\n\nIron Duke, 1846\n\nWheel arrangement 4-2-2\n\nCylinders 2 (inside)\n\nBoiler pressure 100 psi (7 kg/sq cm)\n\nDriving wheel diameter 96 in\n\n(2,440 mm)\n\nTop speed approx. 77 mph (124 km/h)\n\nTwenty-nine Iron Duke Class express\n\npassenger locomotives, designed by\n\nDaniel Gooch, were built at the Swindon\n\nWorks of the Great Western Railway\n\nand Rothwell & Co. of Bolton-le-Moors\n\nbetween 1846 and 1855. The\n\nworking replica Iron Duke, seen\n\nhere, was built in 1985 and is on\n\ndisplay at Didcot Railway Centre.\n\nTHE GWR’S BROAD GAUGE . 51\n\nl GWR Iron Duke Class Sultan, 1857\n\nWheel arrangement 4-2-2\n\nCylinders 2 (inside)\n\nBoiler pressure 100 psi (7 kg/sq cm)\n\nDriving wheel diameter 96 in (2,440 mm)\n\nTop speed approx. 77 mph (124 km/h)\n\nOne of the Great Western Railway’s Iron Duke Class\n\nexpress locomotives, Sultan was originally built in 1847,\n\nbut was involved in an accident at Shrivenham a year\n\nlater when it ran into a goods train. The prototype of\n\nthis class, Great Western, was originally ﬁtted with one\n\npair of carrying wheels at the front as a 2-2-2. As with\n\nother members of the class, Sultan’s driving wheels\n\nhad no ﬂanges to allow movement on curves.\n\nr GWR Iron Duke Class\n\nLord of the Isles, 1851\n\nWheel arrangement 4-2-2\n\nCylinders 2 (inside)\n\nBoiler pressure 140 psi (10 kg/sq cm)\n\nDriving wheel diameter 96 in (2,440 mm)\n\nTop speed approx. 77 mph (124 km/h)\n\nAnother express passenger locomotive\n\ndesigned by Daniel Gooch for the Great\n\nWestern Railway, Lord of the Isles was an\n\nimproved version of the Iron Duke Class\n\nwith higher boiler pressure, sanding gear,\n\nand a better driver’s “cab”. When new,\n\nit was exhibited at the Great Exhibition\n\nof 1851, and then in Chicago in 1893.\n\nIt was withdrawn in 1884.\n\nl GWR Rover Class, 1870/1871 Built between 1871 and 1888, the Great\n\nWestern Railway’s Rover Class of express\n\nWheel arrangement 4-2-2 locomotives was similar to the Iron Duke\n\nCylinders 2 (inside) Class, but with a small increase in boiler\n\nBoiler pressure 145 psi (10.19 kg/sq cm) pressure and more protective driver’s\n\nDriving wheel diameter 96 in cabs. They used names previously carried\n\n(2,440 mm) by Iron Dukes and stayed in service until\n\nTop speed approx. 77 mph (124 km/h) the end of the broad gauge in 1892.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nBattle of the Gauges\n\nThere were major problems for passengers who were forced to\n\nchange trains at stations where the Great Western Railway’s\n\nbroad gauge met standard-gauge tracks. In 1846 the British\n\nGovernment passed the Railway Regulation (Gauge) Act, which\n\nmandated the 4-ft 81⁄2-in (1.435-m) gauge for UK and 5ft 3in\n\n(1.6m) for Ireland. Brunel was overruled, and by 1892 all the\n\nGWR’s lines were converted to standard gauge.\n\nBreak of Gauge at Gloucester, 1846 This political cartoon depicts\n\nthe confusion caused at Gloucester station where passengers with\n\nluggage had to change trains from the broad-gauge Great Western\n\nRailway to the standard-gauge Midland Railway and vice versa.\n\nu GWR Broad Gauge Coach, 1840 This replica of a Great Western Railway,\n\nbroad-gauge, second-class carriage was\n\nType 6-wheel, Second Class built by London’s Science Museum to run\n\nCapacity 48 passengers with their replica Iron Duke locomotive,\n\nConstruction iron chassis, wooden to celebrate the anniversary of the\n\ncoach body railway in 1985. It now operates with\n\nRailway Great Western Railway Fire Fly at Didcot Railway Centre.\n\n52 . 1839–1869\n\nMass Movers\n\nAs railways expanded, so did their roles and with that the need for engines designed for\n\nspeciﬁc purposes. Express passenger engines had large driving wheels, which increased the\n\ndistance travelled in each rotation. For goods trains, haulage power was transmitted through\n\nsix, eight, or ten smaller wheels that provided the adhesion necessary for trains to move heavy\n\nloads. Suburban passenger services kept to timetables by using tank engines that could run\n\nequally well smokebox- or bunker-ﬁrst. For branch line and shunting engines, size and weight\n\nwere key factors, so the short wheelbase 0-4-0 and the 2-4-0 and 0-6-0 types were preferred.\n\n S&DR No. 25 Derwent, 1845 From the middle of the 19th century,\n\nthe six-wheel goods engine became the\n\nWheel arrangement 0-6-0 principal British locomotive. One of\n\nCylinders 2 the earliest, Timothy Hackworth’s\n\nBoiler pressure 75 psi (3.5 kg/sq cm) Derwent of 1845, served the Stockton\n\nDriving wheel diameter 48 in (1,220 mm) & Darlington Railway, in northeast\n\nTop speed approx. 10–15 mph (16–24 km/h) England, until 1869.\n\nr Met Class A No. 23, 1864\n\nWheel arrangement 4-4-0T\n\nCylinders 2\n\nBoiler pressure 120.13 psi\n\n(8.46 kg/sq cm); later 150 psi\n\n(10.53 kg/sq cm)\n\nDriving wheel diameter 601/2in\n\n(1,537 mm)\n\nTop speed approx. 45 mph (72 km/h)\n\nTank locomotives built by Beyer\n\nPeacock & Co of Manchester\n\nwere the mainstay of London’s\n\nMetropolitan Railway from the 1860s\n\nuntil the advent of electriﬁcation.\n\nTo cut pollution, exhaust steam was\n\nreturned to the water tanks where\n\nit was condensed for reuse.\n\nWagons u SH Chaldron Wagon, The design of the chaldron –\n\nand Carriages 1845–55 a medieval measure used for\n\nweighing coal – was adopted\n\nUnsurprisingly, the designs of the earliest Type Bucket-type coal wagon for the earliest type of wagon.\n\nrailway vehicles were based on proven Weight 31/3 tons (3.35 tonnes) This one was used on George\n\nideas.

They mainly worked between\n\nLondon and Birmingham. The nickname,\n\n“Large Bloomers”, is attributed to American\n\nreformer Amelia Bloomer who scandalized\n\nVictorian society by wearing trousers.\n\nr S&PR No. 5 Shannon, 1857\n\nWheel arrangement 0-4-0WT\n\nCylinders 2\n\nBoiler pressure 120 psi (8.43 kg/sq cm)\n\nDriving wheel diameter 35 in (889 mm)\n\nTop speed approx. 10–12 mph (16–19 km/h)\n\nLondon’s George England & Co. built this\n\nwell tank for the Sandy & Potton Railway\n\nin Bedfordshire. In 1862 Shannon was sold\n\nto the London & North Western Railway,\n\nspending 16 years as a works shunter\n\nbefore ending its career on the Wantage\n\nTramway in Oxfordshire.\n\nl L&BR Queen Adelaide’s u NBR Dandy Car No. 1, 1863 Between 1863 and 1914 passengers\n\nSaloon No. 2, 1842 on the Port Carlisle Railway in\n\nType Horse-drawn rail car northwest England travelled in this\n\nType Passenger carriage with Capacity 30 passengers (12 ﬁrst horse-drawn Dandy Car, the horse\n\nfold-down beds and second class, 18 third class) trotting between the rails.

This is the oldest\n\npreserved carriage in Europe and is in\n\nthe National Railway Museum, York.\n\nBuilding the Tube\n\nCongestion on London’s roads was a problem even during the\n\nmid-19th century. Charles Pearson, a city solicitor, decided to\n\ntackle the issue and was instrumental in raising the £1.3 million\n\nrequired to build the world’s ﬁrst underground railway line, the\n\n3.75-mile- (6-km-) long Metropolitan. The line would link the\n\nCity of London in the east and the Great Western Railway’s\n\nterminus at Paddington to the west, with intermediate stations\n\nserving King’s Cross and Euston.\n\nConstruction of the line alternated between open cuttings\n\nand tunnels, the latter mostly formed using a “cut-and-cover”\n\nmethod. This involved removing the street surface, cutting a\n\ntrench, installing the retaining walls, track, and tunnel roof,\n\nand ﬁnally relaying the street surface.\n\nINSTANT POPULARITY\n\nLondoners immediately took to the underground line. On the\n\nopening day, 10 January 1863, 38,000 people rode in wooden-\n\nbodied, gas-lit carriages pulled by steam locomotives. Although\n\ntheir exhaust made conditions in stations unpleasant, it did not\n\ndeter 9.5 million people from using the service in the ﬁrst year.\n\nThe Metropolitan expanded 50 miles (80 km) to the north,\n\nbut in London the future lay with deep-level lines, electric power,\n\nand narrower tunnels – what would become known as the Tube.\n\nThe ﬁrst deep-level Tube line opened with electric trains in 1890.\n\nThe tunnelling shield bore through soft, unstable soil such as clay during the\n\nexcavation process. It acted as a barrier and support while spoil was removed.\n\n56 . 1839–1869\n\nNations and Colonies\n\nThe success of the early British railways and steam engines attracted\n\ninterest from across Europe and North America. As a result the newly\n\nindustrialized countries such as US, France, and Germany began to lay\n\nthe foundations for their own national systems, so became less and less\n\ndependent on British expertise.\n\nHowever, Britain had a wider sphere of inﬂuence: its empire – the ﬁrst\n\nrailway outside Europe being built in the British colony of Jamaica. There\n\nwere both economic and political reasons for the British to build railways\n\nin Australia, Canada, South Africa, and elsewhere. The vastness of India\n\nwas controlled through its railway system, while the efﬁciency, and\n\ntherefore proﬁtability, of its mining, logging, and agriculture was\n\ncompletely transformed by the new transport.\n\n Borsig No. 1, 1840\n\nWheel arrangement 4-2-2\n\nCylinders 2\n\nBoiler pressure 80 psi (5.62 kg/sq cm)\n\nDriving wheel diameter 54 in (1,372 mm)\n\nTop speed approx. 40 mph (64 km/h)\n\nAugust Borsig opened a factory in Berlin in 1837\n\nand three years later delivered his ﬁrst locomotive\n\nto the Berlin–Potsdam Railway.

Originally designed\n\nby Robert Francis Fairlie and championed by the Ffestiniog Railway\n\nin North Wales, Double Fairlie articulated locomotives were able\n\nto negotiate tight curves thanks to their ﬂexible steam pipes and\n\npivoting power bogies. Fairlie’s patented design was also used in\n\nRussia, Mexico, Germany, Canada, Australia, and the US.\n\nON 21 JULY 1879, almost 10 years since the ﬁrst of Robert Fairlie’s TOP END BOTTOM END\n\ndouble-ended articulated locomotives had arrived on the Ffestiniog\n\nRailway (FR), Merddin Emrys was rolled out of the railway’s Boston\n\nLodge workshops. Designed by G.P. Spooner using Fairlie’s principles,\n\nNo. 10 Merddin Emrys was the third Double Fairlie to be employed on\n\nthe FR and it can still be seen there today. The locomotive could\n\ncomfortably haul 80-ton (81-tonne) loads uphill, from Porthmadog\n\nto the slate quarries at Blaenau Ffestiniog 13 miles (21 km) away.\n\nImpressively, some of these trains were up to 1,312 ft (400 m) long.\n\nThe design featured a double-ended boiler with two separate\n\nﬁreboxes in the centre. Unlike conventional steam locomotives that\n\ncarried their boilers on a rigid frame, the boiler and superstructure of\n\nthe Double Fairlie were supported at each end by a short-wheelbase\n\npower bogie, connected by ﬂexible steam hoses. This allowed the bogies\n\nto turn into a curve before the main body of the locomotive. It was\n\npossible to drive each “end” of the locomotive independently, with the\n\ndriver and ﬁreman standing on either side of the ﬁrebox.\n\nSix of the best SPECIFICATIONS FR Double Fairlie In-service period 1879–present (Merddin Emrys)\n\nBuilt in 1836, the Ffestiniog Class 0-4-4-0T Cylinders 4\n\nRailway used six “Double Fairlie” Wheel arrangement UK Boiler pressure 160 psi (11.25 kg/sq cm)\n\n0-4-4-0T locomotives to Origin R.

By 1973 it was converted to burn oil instead of\n\ncoal, and by 1984 it was in need of another overhaul. Its builders\n\ndecided to remake Merddin Emrys in its original 1879 appearance,\n\nbut retained its larger superstructure in line with the Ffestiniog\n\nRailway’s improved loading gauge restrictions.

These lines were suited to mountainous regions as\n\nthey were cheaper to construct and could cope with sharper curves and steeper\n\ngradients. In the 1870s India built its ﬁrst locomotive using parts imported from\n\nBritain, and in 1872 Japan opened its ﬁrst railway.

Developed by Werner von Siemens – a successful\n\nelectrical engineer and a pioneer in the development of electric\n\nmotors – it was unveiled in 1879 at a trade fair held in Berlin.\n\nEarlier attempts at electric traction generated power within\n\nthe locomotive, which limited the possibilites of rail travel.\n\nSiemens, however, established an alternative power source by\n\ndrawing a continuous current (150 volts) for his 2.2-kilowatt\n\nmotor from a conductor rail placed along the centre of the track.\n\nThe train operated for four months and carried 90,000 people,\n\ndespite advertising a top speed of just 4.4 mph (7 km/h) –\n\nthough it is said to have reached 8.12 mph (13 km/h).\n\nBUILDING ON SUCCESS\n\nThis experimental train set the future design for railways.\n\nAlthough energized lines were eventually superseded by safer\n\nand more efﬁcient electric overhead wires, the success of the\n\ntrain enabled Siemens to develop an electric tramway, which\n\nbegan operating in the Lichterfelde district of Berlin in 1881.\n\nBoth of these pioneering designs, created by Siemens with his\n\npartner, mechanical engineer Johann Halske, formed the\n\nbedrock of their worldwide electrical engineering business,\n\nwhich is still operating today.\n\nVisitors to the 1879 Berlin trade fair were carried around a 984-ft (300-m)\n\ncircular track by Siemens & Halske’s electric train.\n\n1895–1913\n\nGOLDEN\n\nAGE\n\n1895–1913 . 95\n\nGOLDEN AGE\n\nOne of the world’s oldest railways pointed the Key Events\n\nway forward when its ﬁrst mainline electric route r 1895 America’s Baltimore & Ohio\n\nRailroad launches the electric age with\n\nwas opened in 1895.

Some 45 were constructed.\n\n LNER Class C1 Developed from the Great Northern\n\nLarge Atlantic, 1902 Railway’s Class C2 Small Atlantic, 94 of\n\nthese large boiler express locomotives\n\nWheel arrangement 4-4-2 were built at Doncaster Works between\n\nCylinders 2 1902 and 1910. Under London & North\n\nBoiler pressure 170 psi (11.95 kg/sq cm) Eastern Railway’s ownership, it retained\n\nDriving wheel diameter 80 in (2,030 mm) its C1 classiﬁcation to distinguish it\n\nTop speed approx. 90 mph (145 km/h) from its small boiler relatives.\n\n GWR, 3700 Class or City\n\nClass, 1902\n\nWheel arrangement 4-4-0\n\nCylinders 2 (inside)\n\nBoiler pressure 200 psi (14.06 kg/sq cm)\n\nDriving wheel diameter 80 in (2,030 mm)\n\nTop speed approx. 100 mph (161 km/h)\n\nDesigned by George Churchward, 20 of these\n\nexpress locomotives were built at the Great\n\nWestern Railway’s Swindon Works between\n\n1902 and 1909. In 1904, No. 3440 City of Truro\n\nwas claimed to be the ﬁrst steam locomotive\n\nto reach 100 mph (161 km/h).\n\n GWR 4000 Class Another of George Churchward’s designs,\n\nor Star Class, 1907 73 Star Class express passenger\n\nlocomotives were built at the Great\n\nWheel arrangement 4-6-0 Western Railway’s Swindon Works between\n\nCylinders 4 (2 outside, 2 inside) 1907 and 1923. The prototype, No. 4, was\n\nBoiler pressure 225 psi (15.82 kg/sq cm) given the name North Star, then\n\nDriving wheel diameter 80 in (2,030 mm) renumbered 4000. This is No. 4005 Polar\n\nTop speed approx. 90 mph (145 km/h) Star, which remained in service until 1934.\n\n98 . 1895–1913\n\nBritish Evolution\n\nBy the end of the 19th century Britain’s railway network had expanded\n\nto serve nearly every part of the country. Coal mines, quarries, ironworks,\n\nfactories, ports, and harbours were all connected to the railway system,\n\nand the rapid growth of freight trafﬁc led to the development of more\n\npowerful steam locomotives capable of handling heavier and longer\n\ntrains. These freight workhorses were so successful that many remained\n\nin service for more than 50 years. At the same time, passenger\n\ntrafﬁc connecting cities with their suburbs also saw a rapid\n\nexpansion, with new types of tank locomotives capable of fast\n\nacceleration hauling commuter trains to tight schedules.\n\nu Met E Class No. 1, 1898 No. 1 was the last locomotive built at\n\nthe Metropolitan Railway’s Neasden\n\nWheel arrangement 0-4-4T Works and spent its early years hauling\n\nCylinders 2 (inside) commuter trains between Baker Street\n\nBoiler pressure 150 psi (10.53 kg/sq cm) and Aylesbury. As London Transport\n\nDriving wheel diameter 653/4in (1,670 mm) No. L44, it remained in service until\n\nTop speed approx. 60 mph (96 km/h) 1965 and is now preserved.\n\nu CR 812 Class, 1899 John F. McIntosh designed this\n\ntender locomotive for the\n\nWheel arrangement 0-6-0 Caledonian Railway. A total of\n\nCylinders 2 (inside) 79 of the 812 Class were built\n\nBoiler pressure 160 psi (11.25 kg/sq cm) between 1899 and 1909. Most\n\nDriving wheel diameter 593/4in (1,520 mm) remained in service for more\n\nTop speed approx. 55 mph (88 km/h) than 50 years.\n\nr NER Class X1, No. 66, 1902\n\nWheel arrangement 2-2-4T\n\nCylinders 2 (compound, inside)\n\nBoiler pressure 175 psi (12.30 kg/sq cm)\n\nDriving wheel diameter 673/4in (1,720 mm)\n\nTop speed approx. 55 mph (88 km/h)\n\nBuilt for the North Eastern Railway in 1869\n\nto haul its Mechanical Engineer’s saloon,\n\nNo. 66 Aerolite was rebuilt as a 4-2-2T\n\nin 1886 and as a 2-2-4T in 1902.\n\nShifting Freight l Alexandra Docks (Newport\n\nand South Wales) & Railway Co.\n\nThe railway companies built thousands No. 1340, 1897\n\nof four-wheel covered and open freight\n\nwagons to carry raw materials, ﬁnished Wheel arrangement 0-4-0ST\n\ngoods, and food perishables around Britain.\n\nIndividual companies also owned large Cylinders 2\n\nﬂeets of private-owner wagons and\n\ndisplayed their names on the sides.
