        "text": "Reaching Cornwall Brunel built the Royal Albert Bridge (1859) to carry the railway across the River Tamar into Cornwall, extending the network westwards. Here a prefabricated bridge span is being prepared to be raised into position. 50 . 1839–1869 The GWR’s Broad Gauge While other British railways were being built to the standard gauge of 4 ft 8½ in (1.435 m), engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel used the broad gauge of 7 ft ¼ in (2.14 m) when building the Great Western Railway, which opened from London Paddington to Bristol in 1841. Brunel had argued that his design offered higher speeds, smoother running, more stability, and increased comfort for passengers when compared to standard- gauge railways. In many ways he was right, but the spread of the standard gauge not only in Britain but also in many other parts of the world, including North America, led to Brunel’s broad gauge becoming an anachronism. The GWR’s last broad-gauge train ran on 21 May 1892. l GWR Fireﬂy Class Designed by Daniel Gooch, Fireﬂy was one of Fire Fly, 1840 61 express passenger locomotives built for the Great Western Railway by various builders Wheel arrangement 4-2-2 between 1840 and 1842. The class was known Cylinders 2 (inside) for its speed with the original Fire Fly travelling Boiler pressure 100 psi (7 kg/sq cm) from Twyford to Paddington in only 37 minutes. Driving wheel diameter 84 in (2,134 mm) Built in 2005, this working replica is the 63rd Fire Top speed approx. 58 mph (93 km/h) Fly. It operates at Didcot Railway Centre. l GWR Iron Duke Class Iron Duke, 1846 Wheel arrangement 4-2-2 Cylinders 2 (inside) Boiler pressure 100 psi (7 kg/sq cm) Driving wheel diameter 96 in (2,440 mm) Top speed approx. 77 mph (124 km/h) Twenty-nine Iron Duke Class express passenger locomotives, designed by Daniel Gooch, were built at the Swindon Works of the Great Western Railway and Rothwell & Co. of Bolton-le-Moors between 1846 and 1855. The working replica Iron Duke, seen here, was built in 1985 and is on display at Didcot Railway Centre. THE GWR’S BROAD GAUGE . 51 l GWR Iron Duke Class Sultan, 1857 Wheel arrangement 4-2-2 Cylinders 2 (inside) Boiler pressure 100 psi (7 kg/sq cm) Driving wheel diameter 96 in (2,440 mm) Top speed approx. 77 mph (124 km/h) One of the Great Western Railway’s Iron Duke Class express locomotives, Sultan was originally built in 1847, but was involved in an accident at Shrivenham a year later when it ran into a goods train. The prototype of this class, Great Western, was originally ﬁtted with one pair of carrying wheels at the front as a 2-2-2. As with other members of the class, Sultan’s driving wheels had no ﬂanges to allow movement on curves. r GWR Iron Duke Class Lord of the Isles, 1851 Wheel arrangement 4-2-2 Cylinders 2 (inside) Boiler pressure 140 psi (10 kg/sq cm) Driving wheel diameter 96 in (2,440 mm) Top speed approx. 77 mph (124 km/h) Another express passenger locomotive designed by Daniel Gooch for the Great Western Railway, Lord of the Isles was an improved version of the Iron Duke Class with higher boiler pressure, sanding gear, and a better driver’s “cab”. When new, it was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851, and then in Chicago in 1893. It was withdrawn in 1884. l GWR Rover Class, 1870/1871 Built between 1871 and 1888, the Great Western Railway’s Rover Class of express Wheel arrangement 4-2-2 locomotives was similar to the Iron Duke Cylinders 2 (inside) Class, but with a small increase in boiler Boiler pressure 145 psi (10.19 kg/sq cm) pressure and more protective driver’s Driving wheel diameter 96 in cabs. They used names previously carried (2,440 mm) by Iron Dukes and stayed in service until Top speed approx. 77 mph (124 km/h) the end of the broad gauge in 1892. TECHNOLOGY Battle of the Gauges There were major problems for passengers who were forced to change trains at stations where the Great Western Railway’s broad gauge met standard-gauge tracks. In 1846 the British Government passed the Railway Regulation (Gauge) Act, which mandated the 4-ft 81⁄2-in (1.435-m) gauge for UK and 5ft 3in (1.6m) for Ireland. Brunel was overruled, and by 1892 all the GWR’s lines were converted to standard gauge. Break of Gauge at Gloucester, 1846 This political cartoon depicts the confusion caused at Gloucester station where passengers with luggage had to change trains from the broad-gauge Great Western Railway to the standard-gauge Midland Railway and vice versa. u GWR Broad Gauge Coach, 1840 This replica of a Great Western Railway, broad-gauge, second-class carriage was Type 6-wheel, Second Class built by London’s Science Museum to run Capacity 48 passengers with their replica Iron Duke locomotive, Construction iron chassis, wooden to celebrate the anniversary of the coach body railway in 1985. It now operates with Railway Great Western Railway Fire Fly at Didcot Railway Centre. 52 . 1839–1869 Mass Movers As railways expanded, so did their roles and with that the need for engines designed for speciﬁc purposes. Express passenger engines had large driving wheels, which increased the distance travelled in each rotation. For goods trains, haulage power was transmitted through six, eight, or ten smaller wheels that provided the adhesion necessary for trains to move heavy loads. Suburban passenger services kept to timetables by using tank engines that could run equally well smokebox- or bunker-ﬁrst. For branch line and shunting engines, size and weight were key factors, so the short wheelbase 0-4-0 and the 2-4-0 and 0-6-0 types were preferred.  S&DR No. 25 Derwent, 1845 From the middle of the 19th century, the six-wheel goods engine became the Wheel arrangement 0-6-0 principal British locomotive.

To cut pollution, exhaust steam was returned to the water tanks where it was condensed for reuse.

However, increasing loads – both passenger and goods – faster speeds, and the call for greater comfort and facilities brought about rapid advances. MASS MOVERS . 53 l LNWR “Large Bloomers”, 1851 Wheel arrangement 2-2-2 Cylinders 2 Boiler pressure 100 psi (7 kg/sq cm); later 150 psi (10.53 kg/sq cm) Driving wheel diameter 84 in (2,134 mm) Top speed approx. 50–60 mph (80–96 km/h) Designed by James McConnell, 74 of these single-wheeler passenger engines were built for the London & North Western Railway up to 1862. They mainly worked between London and Birmingham. The nickname, “Large Bloomers”, is attributed to American reformer Amelia Bloomer who scandalized Victorian society by wearing trousers. r S&PR No. 5 Shannon, 1857 Wheel arrangement 0-4-0WT Cylinders 2 Boiler pressure 120 psi (8.43 kg/sq cm) Driving wheel diameter 35 in (889 mm) Top speed approx. 10–12 mph (16–19 km/h) London’s George England & Co. built this well tank for the Sandy & Potton Railway in Bedfordshire. In 1862 Shannon was sold to the London & North Western Railway, spending 16 years as a works shunter before ending its career on the Wantage Tramway in Oxfordshire. l L&BR Queen Adelaide’s u NBR Dandy Car No. 1, 1863 Between 1863 and 1914 passengers Saloon No. 2, 1842 on the Port Carlisle Railway in Type Horse-drawn rail car northwest England travelled in this Type Passenger carriage with Capacity 30 passengers (12 ﬁrst horse-drawn Dandy Car, the horse fold-down beds and second class, 18 third class) trotting between the rails.

Construction Wooden body, iron chassis Railway London & Birmingham Railway This “stagecoach on wheels” transported Adelaide, Queen Consort to Britain’s William IV. While the chassis was entrusted to the London & Birmingham Railway’s Euston Works, the body was the work of a London coach builder. This is the oldest preserved carriage in Europe and is in the National Railway Museum, York. Building the Tube Congestion on London’s roads was a problem even during the mid-19th century. Charles Pearson, a city solicitor, decided to tackle the issue and was instrumental in raising the £1.3 million required to build the world’s ﬁrst underground railway line, the 3.75-mile- (6-km-) long Metropolitan. The line would link the City of London in the east and the Great Western Railway’s terminus at Paddington to the west, with intermediate stations serving King’s Cross and Euston. Construction of the line alternated between open cuttings and tunnels, the latter mostly formed using a “cut-and-cover” method. This involved removing the street surface, cutting a trench, installing the retaining walls, track, and tunnel roof, and ﬁnally relaying the street surface. INSTANT POPULARITY Londoners immediately took to the underground line. On the opening day, 10 January 1863, 38,000 people rode in wooden- bodied, gas-lit carriages pulled by steam locomotives. Although their exhaust made conditions in stations unpleasant, it did not deter 9.5 million people from using the service in the ﬁrst year. The Metropolitan expanded 50 miles (80 km) to the north, but in London the future lay with deep-level lines, electric power, and narrower tunnels – what would become known as the Tube. The ﬁrst deep-level Tube line opened with electric trains in 1890. The tunnelling shield bore through soft, unstable soil such as clay during the excavation process. It acted as a barrier and support while spoil was removed. 56 . 1839–1869 Nations and Colonies The success of the early British railways and steam engines attracted interest from across Europe and North America. As a result the newly industrialized countries such as US, France, and Germany began to lay the foundations for their own national systems, so became less and less dependent on British expertise. However, Britain had a wider sphere of inﬂuence: its empire – the ﬁrst railway outside Europe being built in the British colony of Jamaica. There were both economic and political reasons for the British to build railways in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and elsewhere. The vastness of India was controlled through its railway system, while the efﬁciency, and therefore proﬁtability, of its mining, logging, and agriculture was completely transformed by the new transport.  Borsig No. 1, 1840 Wheel arrangement 4-2-2 Cylinders 2 Boiler pressure 80 psi (5.62 kg/sq cm) Driving wheel diameter 54 in (1,372 mm) Top speed approx. 40 mph (64 km/h) August Borsig opened a factory in Berlin in 1837 and three years later delivered his ﬁrst locomotive to the Berlin–Potsdam Railway. In 1840, No. 1 outpaced a British-built competitor, ending Germany’s reliance on imports and helping make Borsig one of the world’s leading engine builders. u I-class No. 1, 1855 One of four I-Class locomotives built by r EIR No. 22 Fairy Queen, 1855 Robert Stephenson & Co of Newcastle- Wheel arrangement 0-4-2 upon-Tyne, England, No. 1 was delivered to Wheel arrangement 2-2-2 Cylinders 2 the Sydney Railway Co. in January 1855.

TECHNOLOGY Challenging Railways With mountain ranges, deserts, and jungles to be overcome, India posed a huge challenge to railway builders. Nevertheless, the ﬁrst 25-mile (40-km) stretch between Bombay (now Mumbai) and Thane opened in November 1852, and by 1880 around 9,000 miles (14,484km) of track had been laid. Twenty years on, the network had extended to 40,000 miles (64,374km). A committee set up by the Governor General, Lord Dalhousie, led to the setting up of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, the East India Railway, and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway.

In the UK the famous “Races to the North” of 1888 and 1895 saw the railways of the rival East Coast and West Coast Main Lines between London and Scotland engage in a dangerous high-speed struggle for supremacy. In the US there was ﬁerce competition between the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad on their New York to Buffalo routes during the 1890s. This triggered electrifying performances by the latter company’s celebrity locomotive No. 999 while hauling the Empire State Express. l GNR Stirling Single Class, 1870 Wheel arrangement 4-2-2 Cylinders 2 Boiler pressure 170 psi (11.95 kg/sq cm) Driving wheel diameter 97 in (2,464 mm) Top speed 85 mph (137 km/h) Patrick Stirling designed this locomotive for the Great Northern Railway. A total of 53 of these single-wheeler locomotives were built at Doncaster Works between 1870 and 1895. The locomotives hauled express trains on the East Coast Main Line between London King’s Cross and York and were involved in the “Races to the North” of 1888 and 1895.

Hauling heavy expresses between London and Brighton, they were named after politicians, railway ofﬁcials, or places served by the railway. The last survivor was retired in 1933, and No. 214 Gladstone is preserved at the National Railway Museum in York. 64 . 1870–1894 London Locals Growing prosperity and personal mobility enabled people to move away from the centre of London. Railroads supplied transportation links from the new suburbs to the city, giving birth to the commuter train. While the Great Eastern Railway among others provided a peak-time, steam-hauled service, electric traction – overground and underground – was the future. The ﬁrst deep-level “tube” line, the City & South London Railway, which opened in 1890 was the nucleus of London’s underground system. Other cities soon followed London’s example: Liverpool in northwest England and Budapest and Paris in Continental Europe. In the US, the Boston subway opened in 1897 and, by 1904, had been joined by New York’s. u LB&SCR A1 Class, 1872 The London, Brighton & South Coast Railway’s Wheel arrangement 0-6-0T suburban network was the domain of William Cylinders 2 Stroudley’s small, six-coupled tanks.

Designed to be pushed by one or two steam engines along a single-track line, it was ﬁtted with a ﬂange that scraped snow and ice from the insides of the rails, creating a groove for the ﬂanges of engine and carriage wheels. IN WINTER, HEAVY SNOWFALLS and icy conditions regularly FRONT VIEW REAR VIEW closed railways in the US and Canada. Faced with a loss of business, the railway companies started to use wooden wedges attached to the front of locomotives to clear snow from the tracks. By the late 19th century this makeshift arrangement was superceded by the introduction of separate snow-plough wagons mounted on bogies and pushed by locomotives. Believed to be oldest snow plough of its type in existence, the C&PA Snow Plow is a wedge-style model that was built around 1890 under licence for the Russell Snow Plow Company by the Ensign Manufacturing Company in Huntingdon, West Virginia. A cupola was ﬁtted on the roof directly behind the plough blades to give the crew a view of the track ahead. The plough was used on the C&PA until 1945, when it was damaged in an accident. It later became the property of the Wellsville, Addison & Galeton Railroad before being donated to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in 1980, where it has since been restored.

Originally designed by Robert Francis Fairlie and championed by the Ffestiniog Railway in North Wales, Double Fairlie articulated locomotives were able to negotiate tight curves thanks to their ﬂexible steam pipes and pivoting power bogies. Fairlie’s patented design was also used in Russia, Mexico, Germany, Canada, Australia, and the US. ON 21 JULY 1879, almost 10 years since the ﬁrst of Robert Fairlie’s TOP END BOTTOM END double-ended articulated locomotives had arrived on the Ffestiniog Railway (FR), Merddin Emrys was rolled out of the railway’s Boston Lodge workshops. Designed by G.P. Spooner using Fairlie’s principles, No. 10 Merddin Emrys was the third Double Fairlie to be employed on the FR and it can still be seen there today. The locomotive could comfortably haul 80-ton (81-tonne) loads uphill, from Porthmadog to the slate quarries at Blaenau Ffestiniog 13 miles (21 km) away. Impressively, some of these trains were up to 1,312 ft (400 m) long. The design featured a double-ended boiler with two separate ﬁreboxes in the centre. Unlike conventional steam locomotives that carried their boilers on a rigid frame, the boiler and superstructure of the Double Fairlie were supported at each end by a short-wheelbase power bogie, connected by ﬂexible steam hoses. This allowed the bogies to turn into a curve before the main body of the locomotive. It was possible to drive each “end” of the locomotive independently, with the driver and ﬁreman standing on either side of the ﬁrebox.

In 1970 it was extensively rebuilt with a new boiler, which gave it a larger, less traditional look. By 1973 it was converted to burn oil instead of coal, and by 1984 it was in need of another overhaul. Its builders decided to remake Merddin Emrys in its original 1879 appearance, but retained its larger superstructure in line with the Ffestiniog Railway’s improved loading gauge restrictions.

These lines were suited to mountainous regions as they were cheaper to construct and could cope with sharper curves and steeper gradients. In the 1870s India built its ﬁrst locomotive using parts imported from Britain, and in 1872 Japan opened its ﬁrst railway.

For many years these small, yet powerful, locomotives have hauled trains on the adhesion-worked mountain railway that climbs from the plains of northwest India through tea plantations to the hill station of Darjeeling. The idyllic scenery of the route has inspired many poetic descriptions, including “halfway to heaven” and “railway to the clouds”. THE FIRST FOUR B Class for the Darjeeling FRONT VIEW OF ENGINE REAR VIEW OF BRAKE CARRIAGE Himalayan Railway (DHR) were built by UK-based Sharp, Stewart, & Company in 1889. By 1927 the North British Locomotive Company of Glasgow, the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia in the US, and the railway’s own Tindharia Works had built a further 25. An additional ﬁve had been built for the Raipur Forest Tramway in 1925. After decades of service, four from the DHR stock were transferred to the Tipong Colliery Railway in 1970. Nowadays, some B Class still run on the DHR, while several exist as retired exhibits around India, and one was transferred to operate on the Matheran Hill Railway in 2002. B Class No. 19 was sold to an American DHR enthusiast in 1962. After several years out of service the engine was bought by a British enthusiast, who restored it for use on the private Beeches Light Railway in Oxfordshire, UK.

Developed by Werner von Siemens – a successful electrical engineer and a pioneer in the development of electric motors – it was unveiled in 1879 at a trade fair held in Berlin. Earlier attempts at electric traction generated power within the locomotive, which limited the possibilites of rail travel. Siemens, however, established an alternative power source by drawing a continuous current (150 volts) for his 2.2-kilowatt motor from a conductor rail placed along the centre of the track. The train operated for four months and carried 90,000 people, despite advertising a top speed of just 4.4 mph (7 km/h) – though it is said to have reached 8.12 mph (13 km/h). BUILDING ON SUCCESS This experimental train set the future design for railways. Although energized lines were eventually superseded by safer and more efﬁcient electric overhead wires, the success of the train enabled Siemens to develop an electric tramway, which began operating in the Lichterfelde district of Berlin in 1881. Both of these pioneering designs, created by Siemens with his partner, mechanical engineer Johann Halske, formed the bedrock of their worldwide electrical engineering business, which is still operating today. Visitors to the 1879 Berlin trade fair were carried around a 984-ft (300-m) circular track by Siemens & Halske’s electric train. 1895–1913 GOLDEN AGE 1895–1913 . 95 GOLDEN AGE One of the world’s oldest railways pointed the Key Events way forward when its ﬁrst mainline electric route r 1895 America’s Baltimore & Ohio Railroad launches the electric age with was opened in 1895.

Engineering feats included the Victoria Falls Bridge across the Zambezi River in Africa, which opened in 1905; and the Simplon Tunnel, which opened in 1906. The structure, stretching more than 12 miles (20 km) under the Alps to connect Italy and Switzerland, became the world’s longest tunnel. “Railway termini ... are our gates to the u Jura-Simplon Railway glorious and the unknown.

Coal mines, quarries, ironworks, factories, ports, and harbours were all connected to the railway system, and the rapid growth of freight trafﬁc led to the development of more powerful steam locomotives capable of handling heavier and longer trains. These freight workhorses were so successful that many remained in service for more than 50 years. At the same time, passenger trafﬁc connecting cities with their suburbs also saw a rapid expansion, with new types of tank locomotives capable of fast acceleration hauling commuter trains to tight schedules. u Met E Class No. 1, 1898 No. 1 was the last locomotive built at the Metropolitan Railway’s Neasden Wheel arrangement 0-4-4T Works and spent its early years hauling Cylinders 2 (inside) commuter trains between Baker Street Boiler pressure 150 psi (10.53 kg/sq cm) and Aylesbury.
