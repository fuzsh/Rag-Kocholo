V. http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis REC'D I FILES sEcnoti DEC 14 1949 , DECISION OF THE RESERVE BANK ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE DETERMINING THE FEDERAL RESERVE DISTRICTS AND THE LOCATION OF FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE ACT APPROVED DECEMBER 23, 1913 APRIL 2, 1914 WITH STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE IN RELATION THERETO http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis APRIL 10, 1914 WASHINGTON GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 1914 http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis DECISION OF THE RESERVE BANK ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE DETERMINING THE FEDERAL RESERVE DISTRICTS AND THE LOCATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS. [Under the Federal Reserve Act approved December 23, 1913.1 The Federal Reserve Act directs the Reserve Bank Organization Committee to \"designate not less than eight nor more than twelve cities to be known as Federal reserve cities\"; to \"divide the continental United States, excluding Alaska, into districts, each district to contain only one of such Federal reserve cities,\" and to apportion the districts \"with due regard to the convenience and customary course of business.\" The act provides that the districts may not necessarily be coterminous with any State or States. In determining the reserve districts and in designating the cities within such districts where Federal Reserve banks shall be severally located, the organization committee has given full consideration to the important factors bearing upon the subject. The committee held public hearings in eighteen of the leading cities from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the Great Lakes to the Gulf, and was materially assisted thereby in determining the districts and the reserve cities. Every reasonable opportunity has been afforded applicant cities to furnish evidence to support their claims as locations for Federal Reserve banks. More than 200 cities, through their clearing-house associations, chambers of commerce, and other representatives, were heard. Of these, thirty-seven cities asked to be designated as the headquarters of a Federal Reserve bank. The majority of the organization committee, including its chairman and the Secretary of Agriculture, were present at all hearings, and stenographic reports of the proceedings were made for more deliberate consideration. Independent investigations were, in addition, made through the Treasury Department, and the preference of each bank as to the location of the Federal Reserve bank with which it desired to be connected was ascertained by an independent card ballot addressed to each of the 7,471 national banks throughout the country which had formally assented to the provisions of the Federal reserve act. Among the many factors which governed the committee in deter_ 11lining the respective districts and the selection of the cities which have been chosen were: vide First. The ability of the member banks within the district to prothe minimum capital of $4,000,000 required for the Federal http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 3 4 DECISION OF RESERVE BANK ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. Reserve bank, on the basis of six per cent of the capital stock and surplus of member banks within the district. Second. The mercantile, industrial, and financial connections existing in each district and the relations between the various portions of the district and the city selected for the location of the Federal Reserve bank. Third. The probable ability of the Federal Reserve bank in each district, after organization and after the provisions of the Federal Reserve Act shall have gono into effect, to meet the legitimate demands of business, whether normal or abnormal, in accordance with the spirit and provisions of the Federal Reserve Act. Fourth. The fair and equitable division of the available capital for the Federal Reserve banks among the districts created. Fifth. The general geographical situation of the district, transportation lines, and the facilities for speedy communication between the Federal Reserve bank and all portions of the district. Sixth. The population, area, and prevalent business activities of the district, whether agricultural, manufacturing, mining, or commercial, its record of growth and development in the past and its prospects for the future. In determining the several districts the committee has endeavored to follow State lines as closely as practicable, and wherever it has been found necessary to deviate the division has been along lines which are believed to be most convenient and advantageous for the district affected. The twelve Districts and the twelve Cities selected for the location of the Federal Reserve banks are as follows: DISTRICT No. I.

The committee was impressed with the growth and development of the States of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, but on the basis of six per cent of the capital stock and surplus of national banks and State banks and trust companies which have applied for membership, that section could not provide the $4,000,000 minimum capital stock required by the law. With the continued growth of that region it is reasonable to expect that in a few years the capital and surplus of its member banks will be sufficient to justify the creation of an additional Federal Reserve district, at which time application may be made to the Congress for a grant of the necessary authority. It is no part of the duty of the organization committee to locate branches of the Federal Reserve banks. The law specifically provides that \"each Federal Reserve bank shall establish branch banks within the Federal Reserve district in which it is located.\" All the material collected by the committee will be placed at the disposal of the Federal Reserve banks and the Federal Reserve Board when they are organized and ready to consider the establishment of branch banks.

Location. ON APRIL 10, 1914,THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE MADE PUBLIC THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT RELATING TO ITS DECISION OF APRIL 2, 1914, DEFINING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE DISTRICTS AND DESIGNATING THE LOCATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS. WASHINGTON, D. C., April 10, 1914. Congress imposed on the committee the duty of dividing the country into not less than 8 nor more than 12 districts, and the location of a Federal reserve bank in each. Thirty-seven cities asked to be chosen. The committee could select at most only 12. Necessarily 25 cities had to be disappointed. Following its policy declared at the very outset, the committee refused to be influenced by the purely local and selfish claims of cities or individuals, and discharged the duty imposed upon it by Congress after exhaustive investigation and study of the entire country, with unbiased minds and according to its best judgment. With so many conflicting claims, somebody had to judge. Congress constituted the committee a court and gave the Federal Reserve Board the power of review. Disappointed competitors should seek a remedy through the orderly processes the law prescribes. Considerable comment has been occasioned by the failure of the committee to create districts suggested by New Orleans, with New Orleans as the location for a reserve bank; by Baltimore, with Baltimore as the location for a reserve bank; by Omaha, with Omaha as the location for a reserve bank; and by Denver, with Denver as the location for a reserve bank. The committee realized that the division of the country into districts was far more important and complex than the designation of the reserve cities, and that the latter duty was subsidiary and relatively simple, waiving considerations of local pride or prestige. In arranging the districts the consideration of the character and growth of industry, trade, and banking, no less than the traditions, habits, and common understandings of the people was much more intimately involved. It became clear, in the hearings, that comparatively few people realized, or seemed to realize, what the act was intended to accomplish; what the nature and functions of the reserve banks were to be; and how little change would occur in the ordinary financial relations. 17 http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 18 STATEMENT OF RESERVE BANK ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. of the communities, the business establishments, and the individual banks. Critics of the decision of the committee reveal misunderstanding in these directions, and either do not know, or appear not to know, that the Federal reserve banks are bankers' banks and not ordinary commercial banks; that they are to hold the reserves and to clear the checks of member banks, make rediscounts for them, and engage in certain open-market operations. As a matter of fact, the ordinary every-day banking relations of the community, of business men, and of banks will not be greatly modified or altered. The purpose of the system is to remove artificiality, promote normal relations, and create better conditions under which everybody will transact business. Every city can continue to do business with individuals, firms, or corporations, within its own limits, or in its own region, or in any other part of the Union or the world in which it has heretofore done business. Reserves are to be held in a new way and in new places, so far as this act controls them, but banking and business generally will no more be confined within districts than heretofore, and it is simply misleading for any city or individual to represent that the future of a city will be injuriously affected by reason of its failure to secure a Federal reserve bank. Every city which has the foundations for prosperity and progress will continue to grow and expand, whether it has such a reserve bank or not, and well-informed bankers, especially, are aware of this. The facts which the committee had to consider will throw light on its decision in reference to these cities. NEW ORLEANS' CLAIMS. New Orleans selected a district extending from New Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, including all of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and that part of Tennessee south of the Tennessee River. It was represented by Texas that it would do great violence to her trade to connect her with New Orleans. It was claimed, and evidence was submitted in support of the claim, that her trade was with her own cities or with Kansas City and St. Louis. In a poll of the banks of Texas made by the Comptroller of the Currency, 212 banks expressed a first choice, 121 a second choice, and 30 a third choice for Dallas. No bank in Texas expressed a first choice for New Orleans, only 4 a second choice, and 44 a third choice. The whole State protested against being related to New Orleans. The banks of Alabama generally desired to be connected either with Birmingham or Atlanta, only three expressing a first choice for http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis STATEMENT OF RESERVE BANK ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. 19 New Orleans. The banks of Georgia desired to be connected with Atlanta, none expressing a first or second choice for New Orleans, and only 12 a third choice. They represented that it would do violence to them to be connected with a city to the west and claimed that their relations were mainly with Atlanta or cities to the northeast. Of 44 banks in Florida 19 gave Atlanta as their first choice, 19 as their second choice, and 5 as their third choice. Only 5 expressed a first preference for New Orleans, and these were in the western corner, 4 a second choice, and 3 a third choice. No bank in Tennessee expressed a first or second choice for New Orleans, and only 2 a third choice, while 7 expressed a first choice for Atlanta, 14 a second choice, and 13 a third choice. Generally speaking, the only banks which desired to be connected with New Orleans and expressed a first preference for her were 25 of the 26 banks reporting in Louisiana, and 19 of the 32 in Mississippi. On a poll made from the comptroller's office of all banks expressing their preference as to the location for a Federal reserve city, 124 expressed a first preference for Atlanta, 232 for Dallas, and only 52 for New Orleans. The views of the bankers were supported by chambers of commerce, other business organizations, and by many business men. It will thus be seen that if the committee was to give weight to the views of business men and bankers in the section of the country affected, to consider the opposition of the States of Texas, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee, and to be guided by economic considerations, it could not have designated New Orleans as the location for a reserve bank to serve either the western or the eastern part of the district that city asked for. The course of business is not from the Atlantic seaboard toward New Orleans, nor largely from the State of Texas to that city, and if Dallas and Atlanta had been related to New Orleans a better grounded complaint could and would have been lodged by them against the committee's decision than that made by New Orleans. Some of the banking statistics which the committee had to consider throw light on the problem. It should be borne in mind that the committee could consider primarily only the statistics with reference to assenting banks. In this section of the country, as in most others, the assenting banks were the national banks. In March, 1914, the capital stock and surplus, loans and discounts, and individual deposits of the national banks in the three cities named, as shown by the sworn reports to the Comptroller of the Currency, were as follows: Capital and surplus. Atlanta Dallas New Orleans http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis $8,600,000 5,900,000 6,730,000 Loans and discounts. $26,038,000 18,622,000 17,285,000 Individual deposits. $24,348,00C 18,551,006 16,857,00C 20 STATEMENT OF RESERVE BANK ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE.

While the committee could not figure on the resources of other than assenting banks which are in this section, the national banks, the following statistics of all reporting banks, including national banks, State banks, and trust companies, as of June 4, 1913, were regarded as significant and were given consideration: Atlanta reported capital stock and surplus $15,313,000, or $98 per capita; Dallas $9,997,000, or $108 per capita; and New Orleans $20,532,000, or $60 per capita. Individual deposits, per capita, Atlanta, $183; Dallas, $269; New Orleans, $209. The loans and discounts for all reporting banks for the three cities were as follows: Atlanta, $33,494,000, or $216 per capita; Dallas, $27,517,000, or $299 per capita; New Orleans, $64,845,000, or $194 per capita. The committee found that the total loans and discounts made by national banks in the cities named in the 13 Southern States on January 13, 1914, were as follows: Atlanta Dallas New Orleans $26,117,000 19,123,000 19,477,000 while the total loans made by the national banks of Dallas throughout the entire United States on the date mentioned exceeded the loans made by the national banks of New Orleans. Special reports, made under oath to the Comptroller of the Currency also show that on February 14, 1914, the credit balances of the banks http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis TION COMMITTEE. STATEMENT OF RESERVE BAN K ORGANIZA 21 and trust companies in the 13 Southern States with the national banks of Dallas exceeded in amount the credit balances of all banks and trust companies in these same States with the national banks of New Orleans. In view of the comparisons and criticisms from New Orleans in connection with the designation of Dallas, Atlanta, and Richmond, and the omission of New Orleans and Baltimore, the following table is instructive: Maryland, Georgia, Louisiana, National bank statistics for States of Texas, Virginia, 1914. and Mississippi as of March 4, [According to sworn reports made to Area (square miles). 265,780 State of Texas (including Dallas) 42,450 State of Virginia(including Richmond).

The capital and surplus of the national banks of the State of Virginia are 60 per cent greater than the capital and surplus of the national banks of the States of Louisiana and Mississippi combined, including the city of New Orleans, while the loans and discounts by the national banks of Virginia are more than three times as great as the loans and discounts in the national banks of Louisiana, including New Orleans. While the capital and surplus of the national banks of Georgia largely exceed the combined capital and surplus of the national banks of the States of both Mississippi and Louisiana; the loans and discounts made by the national banks of Georgia exceed by $13,000,000 the loans and discounts of all the national banks of Louisiana and Mississippi combined, including the city of New Orleans. The capital and surplus of the national banks of Texas amount to four times as much as the capital and surplus of the national banks of the States of Louisiana and Mississippi combined,and the individual deposits in the national banks of Texas also amount to about four times as much as the individual deposits of all national banks in Louisiana and Mississippi, the only- States from which New Orleans received as much as half a dozen votes as first choice for the location for a Federal reserve bank. http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 22 STATEMENT OF RESERVE BANK ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. KANSAS CITY DISTRICT. • The region in the middle and far West presented problems of difficulty. Careful consideration was given to the claims of Omaha, Lincoln, Denver, and Kansas City, which conflicted in this region. Denver asked for a district which included Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, and the eastern two-thirds of Arizona and Texas, Kansas and Nebraska west of the one-hundredth meridian, and the Deadwood portion of South Dakota. The district gave approximately the minimum capital provided by law. Of the territory included in this district Montana unanimously requested to be connected with Minneapolis or Chicago, saying that she had little or no trade relations with Denver. Idaho desired to go to Portland or San Francisco; Arizona preferred San Francisco, and the greater part of New Mexico asked for Kansas City. Western Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska unanimously protested against going to Denver. Kansas desired Kansas City; Nebraska preferred Omaha or Lincoln; and Texas wanted either a Texas city or Kansas City or St. Louis. In the poll of banks, Denver received 136 first-choice votes, of which 112 were from Colorado and 12 from Wyoming. With Montana, Idaho, Arizona, Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska in opposition, it was clearly impossible to make a district with Denver as the location of a bank. Part of the territory asked to be assigned to San Francisco and the other part to Minneapolis or Kansas City. Omaha asked for a district embracing western Iowa, all of Nebraska, part of South Dakota, part of Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. All but eight of the banks in South Dakota insisted upon being connected with Minneapolis; Iowa desired to go to Chicago; Kansas practically unanimously voted for Kansas City; Montana protested against any other connection than Minneapolis or Chicago. The preferences of the other States have already been indicated. Of the 218 banks which expressed a first preference for Omaha, 181 were from Nebraska. The committee had to consider the State of Oklahoma and part of Missouri in connection with this region, and in district No. 10, 497 banks expressed a first preference for Kansas City; western Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas, and part of New Mexico, especially asked for this connection. Thirty-seven banks in Colorado gave Kansas City as second choice and 26 gave Omaha. It seemed impossible to serve the great section from Kansas City to the mountains in any other way than by creating a district with Kansas City as the headquarters, or to provide for the northwestern section except by creating a district with Minneapolis as headquarters. The only other thing that could have been done with Nebraska under the conditions which presented themselves http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. STATEMENT OF RESERVE BANK 23 was to relate her to Chicago, and this seemed to be inadvisable in the circumstances. The Kansas City banks serve a very distinctive territory and will serve it more satisfactorily than St. Louis could have done. The relations of that territory on the whole are much more largely with Kansas City than with any other city in the Middle West with which it could have been connected. It will, of course, be recognized by those who are informed that of the four cities Kansas City is the most dominant banking and business center. The following statistics as of March, 1914, will throw light on the situation: Capital and surplus, Loans and discounts. $11,660,000 6,570,000 7,545,000 1,330,000 Kansas City Omaha Denver Lincoln Individual deposits. $66,205,000 32,848,000 28,022,000 6,066,000 $40,415,00( 27,258,00( 34,124,00C 4,439,00C r, The statistics of growth during the nine years from Septembe significant: 1904, to March, 1914, are CAPITAL AND SURPLUS.

The loans and discounts of the national banks alone in Kansas City also exceeded the sum total of the loans and discounts of all national banks in the cities of Omaha and Denver combined. The great preponderance in the movement of trade in district No. 10 is to the east. In order to place the Federal reserve bank for http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 24 STATEMENT OF RESERVE BANK ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. that region in Denver it would have been necessary to disregard these facts and the opposition and earnest protests of banks, both national and State, throughout the district. THE RICHMOND DISTRICT. The committee named as cities for the location of Federal reserve banks New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Boston, and Cleveland. In population these are the six largest cities in the United States; their geographical situation and all other considerations fully justified their selection. San Francisco and Minneapolis were the first choice of the great majority of the national banks in their respective sections, and their financial, industrial, and commercial relations and other factors entitled them to be chosen. Their selection appears to have evoked no criticism, but to have received general approval. Conditions relating to the Kansas City, Dallas, and Atlanta districts have been dealt with. For the territory from eastern Georgia to the Pennsylvania line, the committee, after fully considering all the facts, decided to create a district with the Federal reserve bank at Richmond. South Carolina and North Carolina had protested against being connected -with a bank to the south or west. They said that their course of trade was northeast. It seemed undesirable to place a bank in the 'extreme northeastern corner or at Baltimore, not only because of its proximity to Philadelphia, but also because the industrial and banking relations of the greater part of the district were more intimate with Richmond than with either Washington or Baltimore., The States of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North and South Carolina, and the District of Columbia had to be considered. North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia preferred to be connected with Richmond. West Virginia was divided in its preferences; Maryland and the District of Columbia, of course, desired Baltimore or Washington. In the poll of banks made directly by the comptroller's office, Richmond received more first-choice ballots than any other city in the district-167 against 128 for Baltimore, 35 for Pittsburgh, 28 for Columbia, S. C., 37 for Cincinnati, and 25 for Washington, D. C. Of the remaining 21 votes, 19 were for Charlotte, N. C., and 2 for New York. Leaving out the States of Maryland and Virginia, Richmond received from the rest of the district three times as many first-choice votes as were cast for Baltimore. District No.5 is composed of the States of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia (except four counties), North and South Carolina, and the District of Columbia. These States have always been closely bound together commercially and financially and their business dealings are large and intimate. The reports made to the Comptroller of the Cur- http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis STATEMENT OF RESERVE RANK ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. 25 rency on March 4, 1914, by all the national banks in each of these States show in every essential respect that the business of the national banks of Virginia, including Richmond, is greater than the business of the national banks of Maryland, including Baltimore, or any other of the five States embraced in district No. 5, as appears in the following table: Capital,surplus,and undivided profits.

An analysis and study of the actual figures will be found instructive and can lend no support to the claims of New Orleans. From the sworn special reports recently submitted to the Comptroller of the Currency, it appears that the national banks in Richmond were lending in the 13 Southern States, on 'January 13, 1914, more money than was being loaned in those States by the national banks of ally other city in the country except New York. The total loans and discounts in the 13 Southern States by the four cities referred to are as follows: $33,473,000 Richmond .. 6,891,000 Baltimore New Orleans............................................ 19,477,000 915,000 Washington The figures also show that in these portions of district No. 5 outside of the States of Virginia and Maryland the Richmond national banks are lending twice as much money as all the national banks in Baltimore and Washington combined. They also show that although Richmond is not a reserve city, the banks and trust companies in the 13 Southern States had on deposit in the national banks of Richmond on February 14, 1914, $9,876,000, or slightly more than the banks of this section had on deposit in the city of Baltimore, and four times as much as they carried in Washington, although these two cities have long enjoyed the benefits of being reserve cities. That southern banks. should carry larger balances in Richmond, where they could not be counted in their reserves, rather than in Baltimore or Washington,. where they could be counted, is suggestive. http://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 26 STATEMENT OF RESERVE BANK ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. The figures show that the capital and surplus of all reporting banks—national, State, and savings, and trust companies—per capita, in'Richmond, as of June 4, 1913, was $131; in Baltimore, $85; in Washington, $88; and in New Orleans, $60, while the loans and discounts made by all banks and trust companies in Richmond, on the same date, amounted to $393 per capita, against $190 in Washington, $213 in Baltimore, and $194 in New Orleans. The amount of money which banks and trust companies in the various parts of the country carried on deposit with Richmond, a nonreserve city, on February 14, 1914, amounted to $10,970,000, or nearly twice as much as the balances carried by outside banks with the national banks of Washington, which on the same day amounted to $5,516,000, and one and one-half times as much as they carried on the same day with the national banks of New Orleans, a reserve city. The statistics furnished the organization committee show that on March 4, 1914, the capital and surplus of the national banks of Richmond, per capita, amounted to more than twice as much as the capital and surplus, per capita, of the national banks of either Baltimore or Washington, and three and a half times as much as New Orleans, while the individual deposits of the national banks of Richmond amounted to $201 per capita, against $86 for Washington and $76 for Baltimore and $50 for New Orleans. The loans and discounts in the national banks of Richmond on the same date were reported at $279 per capita, against $77 for Washington, $108 for Baltimore and $51 for New Orleans.
