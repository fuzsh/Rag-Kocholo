No. 1 JULY, 1916 Whole No. 288 What Some Women Did By Mrs. Donald McLean Representing the New York City Chapter at the Continental Congress, February 23, 1893 Scarce among our own country's he- roes is there a name which awakens enthusiasm and kindling memories as does Lafayette's. Yet do we ever hear of that \"dearer I,\" his beloved second self — his wife. It seems to me in reck- oning up the heroines of our Revolu- tion great count should be made of those who also served, though they only stood and waited. Our own great grandmothers, when they gathered up their courage and stood with bold fronts (albeit such break- ing hearts) and sent to the enemies' bullets their husbands and their sons, had, at least, the comfort of the fellow feeling of sacrifice for home and coun- try. But what was consolation for the young and loving Anastasie de Noail- les? Married to Lafayette when a girl of fourteen and he a boy of sixteen, what was the world to her but a big garden of delight — to live in, to love in, to play in — but surely not to sacrifice and suffer in ! In the summer of 1776, when, in- sired by that devotion to the cause of liberty which has made his name fa- mous, Lafayette broke to his young wife the startling news that he wished to leave France and her and fight for liberty in a new world among stran- gers, did the fair girl cling to him, beg- ging that he leave not her and the sweet baby on her bosom? No! the de Noailles blood was Bourbon — \"no- blesse oblige.\" If her young lord could give his service for a principle — she could give her love! Naught to be gained in home or land for her ! Pos- sessed of all the world can give, there was no incentive for her sacrifice, yet it was nobly made and made for us. Shall we not delight to honor her? In 1777, when Lafayette sailed in the ship \"Victory\" — name of happy pres- age— he left his baby girl, Henriette, to console the brave young wife. Writing from other shores, he says, \"Henriette is so delightful that she has made me in love with little girls,\" and at that very hour the sweet, tiny daughter had been taken by relentless death from the arms of the mother, leaving her alone, indeed, while Lafayette fought our battles. In 1778 the General returned to France for a glimpse of his wife. In the same year, Voltaire, meeting Mme. de Lafayette at a great house in Paris, fell upon his knee before her and com- plimented her upon the \"wise and bril- liant conduct of her young husband in America.\" Later a son came to her and he was called George Washington, thus giving emphasis to the loyalty she felt toward the country her husband helped to save. DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION MAGAZINE A few years of bliss, following her husband's honors in America and France, and then, the French Revolu- tion ! The same chivalric spirit springs to her aid as to the peerless Marie Antoinette ; — then imprisonment — well nigh death. Finally, when prison doors opened, Anastasie de Noailles-Lafay- ette emerged a broken woman, yet with heart strong enough to treasure the thought and souvenirs of America. The Chateau of LaGrange, her last home, was hung with portraits of Washing- ton, Franklin, Morris, Adams and Jef- ferson. One room in the chateau was furnished entirely with articles from this country, and was styled \"Amer- ica.\" Only forty-seven when she died, Mme. de Lafayette had given to us and our country service true and gallant, faith, loyalty and a woman's heart ; for she gave him in whom she lived and loved. It is a subject of rightful pride to the New York City Chapter — so we feel — that not many months since, over $500.00 was raised by an entertain- ment, as part of a nucleus of a fund to procure a bronze statue of General Washington, to be presented to France in recognition of the gift to us by the French people of a statue of General Lafayette. Will you look now, for a moment, on the dark, reverse picture of an American woman false to this country, although the French woman had been so leal. Who knows but had \"Pretty Peggy Shippen\" been true, Benedict Arnold had not been so false! When Major Andre came to these shores he met the fair Peggy. She was the beautiful daughter of Judge Edward Shippen, of Pennsylvania, and unhappily a Tory. Life sped gaily in those days. Andre writes to England of the gala time in honor of Lord Howe, in which he and Margaret Shippen were the leading figures. The celebration was called a \"Mischi- anza,\" and included \"a regatta, a mock tournament, a ball, a supper and dis- play of fireworks.\" In the tournament Major Andre was one of the Knights of \"Pretty Peggy,\" one of fourteen chosen damsels in whose honor the jousting took place. The two sides adopted distinguishing devices, the one a burning mountain with the motto, \"I burn forever;\" the other a blended rose of red and white, with motto, \"we droop when separated.'\" Miss Ship- pen, as a Lady of the Blended Rose, was arrayed, so the chronicler tells us, in a \"flowing robe of white silk, a rose-colored sash covered with spangles, spangled shoes and stockings, a spangled veil trimmed with silver lace and a towering turban adorned with pearls and jewels.\" The tourna- ment took place upon the green, slop- ing banks of the Delaware. The guests arrived in boats and were marshalled to their places to stirring music from all the bands in the army, The tour- nament was over, fair damsels reward- ed brave men, but Pretty Peggy dis- missed Andre, and within a year mar- ried Benedict Arnold. What fatal dream of a false ambi- tion possessed her, we do not know, but certain it is that as Arnold ma- tured his treacherous plans, his wife aided and encouraged him. On that fell morning, when Wash- ington was to breakfast with General Arnold, was detained and said to La- fayette, \"Oh ! I know you young men are all in love with Mrs. Arnold — hurry and tell her I will reach her later.\" On that fateful morning, when at breakfast, in the latticed-windowed, quaint, low cottage, (which until a year ago, when fire destroyed it, was preserved in all its original interest on the banks of the Hudson) with Gen- eral Washington's staff, the news was brought Arnold and his wife that the treachery was discovered, and that but a bare chance of escape was possible, — what did her woman's wit? It is told of her that, after Washing- ton dispatched officers in pursuit of Ar- nold, he returned to West Point and asked instantly to see Mrs. Arnold. She was apparently distracted. Her condi- tion was pitiable to witness and con- vinced all present that she was not im- plicated in her husband's treason. She protested her innocence ; she wept ; she raved ; she evinced at times the utmost terror if approached, declaring wildly that the life of her child — a babe in WHAT SOME WOMEN DID arms — was endangered. In short, she appeared as if crazed with sorrow. Gen- eral Washington and his aides, touched with pity for her condition, left her to her grief. When Arnold was heard from, General Washington's first act was to turn to an aide and say, \"go to Mrs. Arnold and inform her that though my duty required that no means should be neglected to arrest General Arnold, I have great pleasure in acquainting her that he is now safe on board a British vessel of war.\" Mrs. Arnold's conduct had convinced Gen- eral Washington and his staff of her innocence, especially the young and ar- dent Hamiton, who has left us so mov- ing an account of her beauty and dis- tress. And yet, my fellow women, it has been indisputably proved that Mrs. Arnold had perfect knowledge of every traitorous step of her husband's life — nay, encouraged and abetted him through all. 440977 Mrs. Arnold, after Ihe unfia^y so- journ in England, where she rejoined her husband, returned to this country and died in Massachusetts on St. Valen- tine's Day, eighty-three years old. The wife of General Philip Schuyler is too well known in history and story to need save a touch of my faltering pencil. Only two lines form the tale of her life — yet to imaginative mind, what pretty story of gallant youth's devotion in the message sung out by young Philip Schuyler from a departing vessel, \"Love to sweet Kitty Van Rensselaer if you see her,\" succeeded by the later, more forceful chapter in her life's bouts, em- bodied in that staunch declaration of wifely courage and devotion : \"The Gen- eral's wife must not be afraid.\" For so said \"Sweet Kittty Van Rensselaer\" when as General Schuyler's wife, revo- lutionary storms gathered fast around her and warning friends augured dark and dangerous days. And indeed, she was not afraid, but walked step by step with her heroic husband through any deprivation and peril until the day when victory came, when she lay down to the well-earned rest not disturbed by earthly calls or cares. And now, having talked of the foreign wife of a famous man, faithful to Amer- ica— of the American wife false to it — of the brave woman true to husband and to country — there remains one more name which will, I make bold to say, interest every Regent here, because of that \"fel- low feeeling which makes us wondrous kind,\" the name of the grandmother of my own beloved Regent — the Regent of the New York City Chapter ; that grand- mother whose daring deed of fortitude saved the Continental Army the silver sinews of war, the money chests contain- ing all the coin which lay between the army and pauperism. The famous old Captain John Under- bill's daughter married him who be- came Captain Avery, paymaster of the Continental Army. Thirteen lovely boys and girls blossomed on the parent stem, and surrounded by these, Mrs. Avery kept watch and ward over the family es- tate in Westchester county, New York, while her husband hurled gauge of bat- tle in the enemies' teeth. One starless, murky night, Captain Avery made stealthy march home, sig- nalled low for his wife, who never failed response. A whispered word, under low, bending trees, hidden from children and from servants of the place, a silent slip- ping into the house of the women, and throwing wide of concealed trap-door beneath the dining-table, a shrill whistle from the captain, yet without, four men appeared from clump of trees, bearing a great chest of glistening silver. On into the house, through the trap-door, into walled and hidden recess ; the trap-door dropped in place, table above — is it all a dream? Surely, all is as before — no treasure here for marauding bands. \"All safe, and I'll stay with you to-night, my love,\" cries the captain, so brave in buff and blue. But in the wan, grey daylight, what comes to shock this fancied safe- ty ? \"My husband, wake ! wake ! the Hes- sians are upon us !\" and from every bush and tree trunk, from every knoll and vantage point emerges the hated red coat, and one, only one, of the buff and blue to meet them. Captain Avery will not, can not fly. Mrs. Avery rushes to the only other man within the house, the negro servant, gives to him her despair- ing cry for aid, to be carried to the army post, but one mile away. If only he can steal beyond the Hessians' line. False hope ! When nearly there, discovered, DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION MAGAZINE seized and bound to a tree, where, help- less, the man can only use his stentorian voice. Within the house the Hessians swarm. Before the burning, black log, in the hearth of the dining hall, stands the leader. \"Captain Avery, we are in- formed you have treasure here. Confess, deliver, and you are safe.\" \"I confess and deliver nothing,\" makes answer the valiant Captain. \"Brand him until he does confess,\" commands the Hessian. They strip him to the waist and from his own fireside comes his torture. \"Men, have mercy, — torture me, not him,\" pleads Mrs. Avery, but no heed. Again and again is laid on the hideous, sizzling, red-hot iron, until nature's limit is reached and Captain Avery falls (they think dead), mute unto the last. \"Now, madam, it is your turn. You know and shall tell. Where is that hid- den chest?\" \"What my husband betrays not, is sacred to his wife.\" Mrs. Avery stands white, rigid, and close-lipped. \"Oh, make short work of this,\" rages the Hes- sian Captain. \"Put a pistol to her heart and give her five minutes to tell ere the bullet pierces.\" Erect, unwavering, her motionless husband at her feet, her weep- ing children at her side, Mrs. Avery feels the cold muzzle of the pistol on her breast and is silent. One, two, three min- utes are gone — is there no help ? Four — \"Fly ! Fly ! the enemy is upon us, five to one ! Leave the money — save your- selves !\" So rings from the outside — pistol dropped — stampede, like flight. The ne- gro's lungs have done good service. His never-ceasing shouts caught the ear of a passing officer. He galloped for life to the nearby regiment, on horse. In an instant the men are here and have saved Mrs. Avery and the Captain by the frac- tion of a moment. It is such blood as this that gives us our heritage — Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution. This in our veins must needs make us true patriots as long as our country lives and its flag waves over us. This spirit gives us courage to cry with Whittier's Barbara Fritchie, when an enemy attack, even though years be heavy upon us and the golden cord well nigh broken — \" 'Shoot if you will this old gray head, But spare your country's flag,' she said.\" The above article, \"What Sorne Women Did,\" is the first public address of any length that Mrs. Donald McLean gave before the Daughters of the Amer- ican Revolution. It appeared in Vol. II of the American Monthly, and is printed almost entire. The account of Mme. de Lafayette's sufferings are given in a graphic manner ; but it may be news to some of our readers that she is said to owe her release from prison, and her escape from death, to an American woman, Mrs. James Monroe. Mr. Monroe was United States Minister at the time and was much af- fected by the rumor that their friend, Mme. de Lafayette, was to be executed the following morning. The United States was in its infancy and he hesitated about doing anything that might bring trouble to his country ; on the other hand, he could not sit idly by and let that patriotic woman be executed without some attempt to save her. He talked the situation over very carefully with his wife, and Mrs. Monroe agreed to call at the prison in the hope that the interest shown in her by the United States might be the means of affecting her jailers. So, arrayed in her most becoming garments, and with all possible pomp, she sallied forth that afternoon and called upon her friend. After half an hour spent in the most guarded conversation — for no one could tell who might be listening — she left in outward composure, promising to call again upon the following afternoon. Both she and her husband passed a sleepless night; but were overjoyed on the following morning to learn that the call had the desired effect. Within twenty-four hours Mme. Lafayette was liberated ; no further attempts were made on her liberty, and she was allowed to join her husband in Austria. Marking the Spot Where Washington Resigned His Commission as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army Old Senate Chamber Annapolis, Maryland On December 23, 1783, George Wash- ington, the hero and idol of the American nation, resigned his Commission as Com- mander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, in the Old Senate Chamber of the State House at Annapolis, Maryland. On Thursday, December 23, 1915, the one hundred and thirty-second anniver- sary of that great event, the Peggy Stew- art Tea Party Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, had the inestimable privilege of unveiling and presenting to the State of Maryland a bronze tablet set in the floor of the Old Senate Cham- ber, to mark the spot whereon Washing- ton stood on that momentous occasion. The Old Senate Chamber, which has been restored, and now looks as it did in General Washington's time, was attrac- tively decorated with palms and potted plants. The President's chair, which stands on the dais, was draped with the Stars and Stripes, while, from the arch above, there fell, in graceful folds, the American flag, entwined with the beauti- ful flag of Maryland. The spacious Old Senate Chamber was not large enough to accommodate the au- dience of three hundred or more distin- guished guests, including officials of the State as well as of Patriotic societies, and necessitated the use of the Ante-Room and Rotunda. The ceremonies were in charge of a Committee of Arrangements from the Peggy Stewart Tea Party Chapter, se- 8 DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION MAGAZINE lected with great care, consisting of Mrs. L. Dorsey Gassaway, great great niece of General Washington, at whose sugges- tion the work was taken up, Miss Nancy Weems Dashiell, great granddaughter of Col. John Weems, aide to Gen. Washing- ton, Miss Mildred Tisdale, great grand- daughter of Hon. William Worthington, who, while a member of the Legislature, nearly a century ago, suggested that the Legislature place a memorial to Washing- ton in the room where he resigned his Commission, Mrs. Ryland D. Tisdale, and Miss Katharine Walton, because of their lifelong familiarity with the location of the historic spot. The interested ef- forts of the Regent, Mrs. Daniel M. Gar- rison, direct descendant of Joseph Ball, grandfather of General Washington, also contributed much to the success of this occasion. The exercises were opened with an im- pressive invocation by the Reverend James M. Magruder, whose wife is a member of the chapter. The Regent, Mrs. Garrison, then made the following address of wecome: \"Governor Goldsborough, Our Guests, Daughters of the American Revolution, Ladies and Gentlemen : \"It gives me great pleasure to welcome you here this afternoon, and to assure you that the Peggy Stewart Tea Party Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, appreciate the interest shown, not only in their work, but in the work of the Daughters as a body. \"One of the greatest efforts of our So- ciety is the endeavor to keep alive that spirit of patriotism which first gained for our country its independence and has since brought it to the forefront amongst the nations of the earth. It is with that idea of inculcating a patriotic spirit amongst our people that many places as- sociated closely with our history have been marked with tablets, or otherwise, that the chance wayfarer may see, and seeing, recall to mind the sacrifices that our forebears were called upon to make, that our nation might live. \"And it is the marking of such a spot which calls us together to-day. One hundred and thirty-two years ago to- day there was enacted in this Senate Chamber one of the most impressive scenes of American history. \"George Washington had been called by an oppressed people to aid them in throwing off that yoke of oppression. His work completed and a new nation born to freedom, he traveled here to lay down the symbol of military command, and, as he himself expressed it, 'to become a pri- vate citizen on the banks of the Potomac/ \"At that time any gift in the power of the nation was his to command. Crowns have been gained and dynasties estab- lished for less service to one's country than Washington had given to his. But, instead, we see him true to the principles of the new democratic government, that the people, and not an individual, should rule. \"Let those who at the present day voice the fear that an adequate defense means militarism and military rule, picture to themselves Washington giving up the military control that civic control might be firmly established, and so picturing realize that the America of to-day still stands for government for and by the people.\" After this, the audience rose and sang one stanza of \"America,\" while the band played that patriotic air. The bugler then played the Presidential salute of four flourishes, while the tablet was being unveiled by Master Brice Goldsborough, son of the Governor of Maryland, and Master Mershon Garri- son, son of the Regent of the chapter. The tablet thus unveiled is in bronze and is set into the floor, level with the surface, so as to be in no wise an obstruc- tion. It represents in bas relief a spread eagle holding a sabre and these words: MARKING SPOT WHERE WASHINGTON RESIGNED STANDING ON THIS SPOT GENERAL WASHINGTON RE ) HIS COMMISSION AS C NDER-1N-CHIEF OF NTAL ARMY R 23rd, 1783 Q BY THE PEG \"A PARTY CHAPTER % a- 1915 < In presenting the tablet to the State of Maryland the Regent, Mrs. Garrison, spoke as follows : Governor Goldsborough : \"The Peggy Stewart Tea Party Chap- ter, Daughters of the American Revolu- tion, are particularly fortunate in being granted the use of this Old Senate Cham- ber as the place for their regular meet- ings, and it has seemed to us most appro- priate that such a hallowed spot should be so marked that the visitor to this Chamber should have recalled to his mind the scene which was enacted here one hundred and thirty-two years ago to-day. \"It, therefore, gives me great pleasure to present, on behalf of the chapter, this tablet, to mark the spot where General Washington stood when he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the American Armies, December twenty- third, 1783, and to ask you, Governor Goldsborough to accept it for the State of Maryland.\" Hon. Phillips Lee Goldsborough, in ac- cepting the tablet on the part of the State, spoke with earnestness, and, throughout his remarks, displayed deep feeling. He said: \"To-day marks a most conspicuous event, for we are gathered here to do honor to the memory of a man, George Washington, who, more than any other individual, contributed to the creation of this nation and stamped upon republican institutions a prosperity which made for their permanence. \"In youth, when I listened to the ora- tions common to this day, I was led to believe that his fame rested upon the fact that he was a delegate to the Continental Congress from the State of Virginia; that he was commander-in-chief of the Conti- nental forces during the Revolution, and that he was President of the Constitu- tional Convention, and was twice Presi- dent of the United States. \"Perhaps it was only in my maturity that I realized it was not these offices alone that had made him great, but rather was it his native powers and personal ac- complishments, which, thrusting these honors upon him, he used to such great glory, to his own fame, and in the inter- ests of mankind. \"Had Washington been a Caesar, or a Cromwell, or a Napoleon, he would have listened to the importunities of his friends, and seized the reins of govern- 10 DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION MAGAZINE ment, and considered, unselfishly, no doubt, the interests of them all, and would have welded the colonies together into one Empire that would have demanded the Western World. \"But he recognized too well that the independence so dearly bought belonged to those who had paid the price, and that to do this would be but to follow history, and the example of Caesar, and even with the best intention in the world, the result would not only be the beginning of a nation, but the beginning of its decline. \"Having these things, therefore, in mind, he was willing to retire and let the nation work out for itself its own destiny. But, no sooner had he retired from pub- lic office, than he set to work in a quiet and effective manner, to weld together the western portion of the nation with the eastern, and to create, as far as possible, a common interest in all the colonies in the development of the West, feeling that in this way could perhaps be accom- plished a solidarity which he sincerely hoped for. \"While he was doing this, he at the same time, through force of his person- ality, and through the influence of his friends, began to agitate the necessity of a stronger and more vigorous government than provided in the Articles of Confed- eration. \"But I am not here to tell you of the fulfillment of his work — of the glories of a great nation built upon the foundations which he so well laid — for a description of this man's life, and of its influence upon the nation and of that great nation's progress, is to be treated by the orator of the day, and courtesy reminds me that I should not encroach upon his time. \"Suffice it to say that, the lesson which I draw from the achievements of this man's life is, 'hold fast to that which is good, and persevere in the pursuit of that which is better/ \"It has been said of him: 'This is a man for the nations to trust and rever- ence, and for heroes and rulers to copy.' \"And so, with very great pleasure and unbounded thanks, I accept from the donors, on behalf of the State of Mary- land, this most attractive tablet, placed here through the generous impulses of your Society and you may be sure that it will ever be preserved to the end that when seen by those of the present and future generations, there may be paid to the 'Father of His Country' — to the greatest man of all times and of all lands — a token of reverence, respect and af- fection. \" After a few graceful words of thanks to the Governor the Regent then ex- pressed her pride and pleasure in intro- ducing one so well versed in the history of our State and country, and one so well known to the Daughters of the American Revolution as Mr. A. S. Goldsborough, of Baltimore, the orator of the occasion. He spoke without notes and made an earnest, forceful and patriotic address that inspired in the hearts of his hearers deeper veneration and love for General Washington. His theme was \"Washing- ton, the Ideal American Citizen;\" a man of high ideals who followed the dictates of his conscience, and whose keynote through life was \"Hold fast to that which is Good, and Persevere in that which is Better.\" Mr. Goldsborough began his remarks with reference to the architecture of a building, particularly the State House, whose dome is admired by connoisseurs of art. But, he said, the real, important phase of a building was not its embellish- ments or its architecture, but its founda- tion. A building is measured solely by the type of its foundation, and this be- loved \"Temple of the Republic of Amer- ica,\" this United States, has been built upon such, a safe and sound foundation with such a cornerstone as General George Washington. The orator depicted the personality of Washington and how far it played a part in the foundation of this Republic. He spoke of Yorktown and the years that intervened between then and the day when Washington became a private citi- zen. He told of its ambitious power, of the dissatisfaction of the Army, and its threatened disintegration. Nothing could have kept the Thirteen Colonies together, said Mr. Goldsborough, as did the per- sonality of Washington, a man of great strength of character and force of will. Each colony felt it could go on no further without losing its individuality, and the Continental Army had gone through the seven years' war without MARKING SPOT WHERE WASHINGTON RESIGNED 11 proper care or protection of the Conti- nental Congress. It was the intervention of the great personality of Washington that saved the day. Washington came between Con- gress and the Army. The Army wished to make him King, but he spurned the crown and royalty. It was not the pur- pose of George Washington, Mr. Golds- borough said, to turn the current of the Republic down stream. Washington always asked himself what conscientiously was the right thing for him to do. This was the dominating in- fluence that actuated Washington's life. He would rather rule a nation and lay down the sceptre at the feet of the peo- ple, as he did when he laid down his sword in the Old Senate Chamber, than to take the sceptre from the hands of the people. He was surrendering to the hands of posterity a greater power than that which they proffered him. Influence for good took hold of his soul as well as of his hand, and he said : \"I give back to you your power, and go back to my home to live as any private citizen.\" Such was the foundation Wash- ington laid for the Temple of the Re- public, which gave us genuine American citizenship. During the ceremony, an impressive and inspiring feature was the ringing of the bells of the city at the instant of the unveiling. First, St. Anne's bell rang, and gave the signal, which was taken up by all the church bells and fire bells of Annapolis, in honor of the commemora- tion of the great event that transpired here one hundred and thirty-two years ago. The exercises closed with the benedic- tion by the Reverend Sydney K. Evans, Chaplain of the Naval Academy, after which the audience stood at \"attention\" while the band played the \"Star Spangled Banner.\" After the close of the exercises, the Regent, Mrs. Garrison, gave a beautifully appointed tea for the members of the Peggy Stewart Tea Party Chapter, and specially invited guests, at her home in the Naval Academy. It was a source of deep regret to all that the illness of our beloved State Re- gent, Mrs. Arthur Lee Bosley, prevented her from being present. To hear this wonderful soldier, statesman, patriot, and Christian gentleman honored in the place where he, himself, stood ; to see the ora- tor, Mr. Goldsborough, take the same position that Washington took when on that very spot he voluntarily surrendered his power, while from the walls his pic- tured face looked down upon the audi- ence, and all the bells pealed out in his honor, gave the listeners a sense of uplift that will remain with them forever. — (Mrs. Weems) Edith Marden Ridout, Historian (now State Vice Regent.) CURRENT EVENTS One of the interesting events of the past month was the presentation to the Daughters of the American Revolution through the Curator General, Miss Catherine Brittin Barlow, of a beautiful mahogany desk, a replica of the desk used by the Secretary of the Continental Congress. It was given by Mr. George Seymour Godard, State Librarian of Connecticut, and his four brothers, in honor of their mother — Sabra Lavinia Beach, wife of Harry Godard, of Granby, Conn., who believed so earnestly in the spirit of true Americanism, and so thoroughly instilled its precepts into her children that although she did not live to become a Daughter of the American Revolution herself, her sons wished to have her memory connected with this society whose aims were so similar to her own. On May 17, the anniversary of her birth, the desk was unpacked, its top covered with old rose blotters to protect it from the dust, and put in place. On her arrival at the Hall, Miss Barlow placed a vase of white carnations, snapdragons, lilacs and Bridal wreath on the desk, thereby establishing a custom which she hopes will be continued of decorating it each year. Truly Mrs. Godard is one whose children have risen up and called her blessed. Twice during the past month has the Hall been filled with flowers ; and the sound of young happy voices has pervaded the lower floor as Commencement exercises were held. On another day the building was closed, and throughout the week the sad faces and hushed voices spoke of the sorrow at the death of a former President General. Of such vicissitudes is life. A service was held by the Molly Varnum Chapter, Lowell, Mass., at Spalding House, May 30, in memory of Mrs. Donald McLean, and of the deceased members of the chapter. Tribute to Mrs. McLean \"A perfect woman; nobly planned To warn, to comfort and command.\" For those Daughters of the American Revolution to whom the mention of Mrs. Donald McLean is but a name, one can- not hope to create, by mere words, a pic- ture that would do her justice even in a slight degree; but to others who have been stirred by her eloquence, charmed by her magnetic personality, impressed by her strong characteristics, and judicial mind, which made her an ideal presiding officer, for these Daughters there will al- ways remain the memory of a woman of commanding presence, vigorous in action, as well as of speech, quick to do battle for the right as she saw it, and ever looking onward and upward towards the patriotic ideals she so earnestly and en- thusiastically endeavored to reach ; striv- ing always to increase the influence of our Society and make it a power for good throughout the nation. Her belief in the national character of this Organization so filled all her thoughts that she had scant patience with anything savoring of sec- tionalism, and her eloquent words have many times sounded a warning that there can be more than one kind of what we now style hyphenated Americans, and that to be truly and thoroughly a Na- tional Society is our only excuse for ex- istence. To those, therefore, who knew her only in public life, she may well stand for the personification of sincere virile Ameri- canism. But there are some among us who were privileged to share in her home life, and to them another side of the picture was presented. A devoted wife and mother, a loving sister and a sympathetic friend, it was only within this intimate circle that her sweet womanliness was fully re- vealed. The very intenseness of her nature made all their joys or sorrows her own, and not one among those dear to her ever went down into the depths or up on the heights of human experience but she went with them, rejoicing or comforting, and so welded was her life with theirs that when her family circle was suddenly broken, those who knew her best were soon forced to realize that a chord hold- ing her to this world had broken and a light gone out of her life never to be re- lighted. She gave of her best to our So- ciety, and resolute and unafraid, took up the work laid down for her to do, and may \"God to Whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from Whom no secrets are hid\" lead us to Him, at our life's end, with a heart as pure, a nature as sweet and unspoiled as that of Emily Nelson Ritchie McLean. May she rest in peace, for her works do follow her. E. S. T. On the 22nd of May, 1916, the pretty old town of Frederick, Maryland, was in sorrow. Even the sky was gray. Though the main streets were filled with carriages and automobiles, an unusual quiet prevailed. Over the door bell of one of the old historic homes hung a long cluster of white flowers. Inside in a room glowing with choicest blossoms, and glorified with the Stars and Stripes, lay all that remained to earth of the superbly gifted, dearly loved Emily Nelson Ritchie McLean, her great triumphs, and her deep sorrows forever past, and on her quiet face the peace of eternity. Maryland friends and friends from neighboring States filled the large rooms. The little church with its softly tinted windows and beautiful altar was brightened still further with wealth of bloom and the Flag she loved so well. The burial service was chanted and the hymn \"O, Paradise\" was sung by the choir. When the long line of carriages moved toward the cemetery, between groups of uncovered heads, the town bells rang \"Maryland, My Maryland,\" \"America\" and \"For All the Saints Who From Their Labors Rest.\" Two clergymen in Episcopal robes read the last words of earth over the flower lined grave — and, wrapped in the Flag, she was left to the long rest. Against the sky, far on the horizon, the foot hills of the Blue Ridge stretch out in undulating curves. The nearer space is filled with great trees, now in their June greenery. The evening song of birds that seemed telling good-night to her, held a thrill in the notes that spoke of the resurrection morning, and the wonderful life beyond the grave. It was not an unthinking crowd that moved silently away. Tear-stained sorrowful faces bore sure testimony to the love that followed her to the end. — H. M. B. 12 Mrs. Donald McLean, President General N. S. D. A. R. 1905-1909 Born Frederick, Maryland, January 20, 1859 ; married, 1883 ; died, May 19, 1916. 13 WHAT THE DAUGHTERS ARE DOING ARKANSAS The D. A. R. in Arkansas decided to raise money for the support of their work in the Ozark Mountains by publishing a D. A. R. edition of the Pine Bluff Com- mercial May 11, 1916. This contains short sketches of the different chapters, greetings from prominent Daughters, notes of the Twenty-fifth Continental Congress, interesting accounts of the work in the Ozarks, and many other articles of especial interest to members of patriotic societies. One article seems peculiarly appropriate to mention just at this time — the account of the origin of the State Flag. Early in 1912 the Pine Bluff Chapter decided to present the new battleship Arkansas with a stand of colors, consist- ing of a United States Flag, a Naval Battalion Flag, and a State Flag, but much to the surprise of the members the Secretary of State informed them that Arkansas had no State Flag. Immedi- ately the chapter set to work to have one adopted by the next Assembly. Commit- tees were appointed; designs were asked for, and finally from the sixty-five sub- mitted designs one was selected which afterwards proved to be the one designed by a member of the Pine Bluffs Chapter, Miss Willie H. Hocker. Within a few days a resolution was introduced in each house to have the selected design adopted as the State Flag and passed. The flag design is a rectangular field of red on which is placed a large white diamond, bordered by a wide band of blue. Across the diamond is the word \"Arkansas\" and three blue stars, one above and two below the word. On the blue band are placed twenty-five white stars. The explanation of the symbols is as follows : Arkansas is one of the United States, therefore only National colors are used. The three blue stars typify the three nations, Spain, France and the United States, to which she has belonged in sucession. Their number, three, indi- cates that Arkansas was the third State carved from the Louisiana purchase ter- ritory. The three blue stars also are typical of 1803, the year when Arkansas became the property of the United States. The twenty-five white stars show that Arkansas was the twenty-fifth state in the order of admission to the Union. As it came in paired with Michigan there is a pair of stars on the lower angle of the blue band. Arkansas, containing the only known diamond mine within the possessions of the United States, should be known as the \"Diamond State.\" Heirlooms of the Ringgold Family Now Owned by John Ross Key When Lafayette visited this country in 1825 he spent several days at the beautiful residence of General Samuel Ringgold, Fountain Rock, in Maryland. While there the silver tea service, which had been in the Ringgold family for several generations, was in constant use. This service, a reproduction of which is on the opposite page, is now the property of General Ringgold's grandson, John Ross Key. * * * * ^ jjs jj: This vase was brought from Europe during the first Monroe Administration as a rare work of art, and presented to Mrs. Monroe at the White House by Mr. Robert Gilmor of Glen Ellen, Md., a well known art connoisseur of that day. When George Hay, United States Dis- trict Attorney, married Miss Monroe, his daughter by his first marriage, Marie Antoinette Hay, came to the White House as the guest of Mrs. Monroe. Miss Hay married Gen. Sam Ringgold of Fountain Rock, Md., in 1808. This vase was one of the wedding gifts from Mrs. Monroe. Upon the death of Mrs. Ringgold the vase became the property of her daugh- ter, Mrs. John Ross Key, mother of John Ross Key, the well known artist, who is now the owner. It is a unique and rare work of art and has been the subject of much investiga- tion and discussion among connoisseurs ;as to its origin. The color is a pale terra cotta. 14 Silver Tea-Set Used By Ringgold Family si ifK&k Mm Vase Presented by Mrs. James Monroe to Mrs. Samuel Ringgold 15 Real Daughters Mrs. Sarah Silvester Sisson Fort McArthur Chapter, Kenton, Ohio, mourns the loss of their only Real Daughter, Mrs. Sarah Silvester Sisson, who died January 1, 1916. Had her life been spared until January 17, she would have reached the eighty-seventh mile- stone of her years, having been born January 17, 1829. Her father was Joseph Silvester, of English descent. When the call for sol- diers came for the Continental army, he enlisted from Plymouth County and served through the war. After the treaty of peace he settled at Bangor, Maine, where he was a cabinet-maker. His first wife died, leaving four children, of whom two, the daughters, were mar- ried. He married the second time and came with his two sons to Rutland, Meigs County, Ohio, where his home was again made desolate by the death of his wife. His third wife was the mother of Mrs. Sisson. There were two children from this marriage, William and Sarah. Mr. Silvester died before the birth of this daughter and one of her earliest recollections was of a neighbor's request that she might be permitted to breathe into her baby's mouth to cure its sore throat in the superstitious belief that \"the breath of a child who had never seen its father could cure anything.\" As soon as she was old enough, she began to teach school and taught for eight years, then married G. W. Sisson, of Vinton County, Ohio, in 1857. They opened an Ambrotype gallery in Fort Smith, Ark., and remained there until the close of the Civil War, when they returned to Ohio, settling in McArthur, Vinton County, where Mr. Sisson died in 1907. After the death of her husband, Mrs. Sisson made her home with her daugh- ter, Mrs. Frederick Maglott, Professor of Mathematics at Ohio Northern Uni- versity, Ada, Ohio. She was the mother of four children, two sons and two daughters, both sons preceding her into the life beyond. Hers was a useful, happy life, serene in a consistent Christian faith and filled with good works. A short account of her life, told by her at the time she joined the Daughters of the American Revolution, may be found in the issue of March, 1909. Mrs. Sarah E. Hatch Mrs. Hatch was born in Portland, Maine, April 30, 1816, daughter of Jo- seph A. Crossman and his second wife Elizabeth Hutchings. Joseph Crossman was born at Dartmouth, R. I., Feb. 8, 1737, and died at Portland, Me., July 22, 1831. He fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and later was a mariner on board the Hogue (Deane) Frigate, which cruised to the West Indies. The Frigate captured five prizes, among them the ship Bail- ey of twenty guns, in which action Cross- man received three wounds. Mrs. Hatch died March 9, 1916, and was the widow of David Hatch, and a member of Eliza- beth Wadsworth Chapter. Her comfort has been looked after by that chapter and her grave will be marked before Memo- rial Day. We all hoped she would live to see her hundredth birthday. Mrs. Emma Gannett Morse, Chairman Real Daughters Committee. A member of the Polly Sumner Chapter, Quincy, 111., Miss Julia Sibley, is the proud possessor of a gown worn by her grandmother's grandmother during the Revolutionary War. It is cloth of gold and old blue, one of the trousseau dresses of Mrs. Vital Beauvais (nee Felicite Janice), who lived and was married in 1776 in Old Kaskaskia, Illinois. This Vital Beauvais is the hero under whom the present owner of the gown was admitted to the D. A. R. 16 Open Letter from Chairman of Work for the Immigrant Ellis Island from An Aeroplane Dear Madam Regent : The last year has brought a great na- tional awakening to the importance of the assimilation of our immigrant popula- tion. Much has been done in many states but the task is enormous. Three and a half million men of voting age in America are not naturalized. Many homes are not Americanized. Many a fine, strong immigrant of great potential value to this Republic fails through lack of knowledge. Since it is our patriotic duty to \"create an enlightened public opinion,\" it is ours to see to it that our foreign born neigh- bors understand their opportunities and learn to value our American ideals. No single book is perhaps more helpful to the stranger within our gates than the \"Guide to the United States for the Im- migrant\" by John Foster Carr. The pub- lication was first made possible through the generosity of the Connecticut D. A. R. It has been so widely appreciated that the \"Immigrant Publication Society\" has been formed around it; but, as women loyal to a great cause, it is no less our work than before. Believing that a study of what many communities are doing for the foreign born will increase your interest in our Guide, I commend to your attention the \"Immigrant in America Review,\" pub- lished quarterly at 20 West 34th Street, New York City, and make the following suggestions, which I believe will be help- ful for work in your own community : 1. A Survey of the Foreign-born. 2. Provision by the Board of Educa- tion for adequate night classes for for- eigners in English, Civics, American His- tory and Manual Training. 3. Co-operation with the Chamber of Commerce and employers in furthering the publicity of these classes. 4. Employment of \"home teachers'\" and \"friendly visitors\" to Americanized foreign born women and to make the im- migrant home an American home. 5. Celebration of February 22 and July 4 as National Americanization Days — when native born and foreign born may meet to emphasize the highest in our Na- tional life. 6. The placing of the \"Guide to the United States for the Immigrant\" and other interesting and helpful books for foreigners in your Public Library, Night School, Social Centre, Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A., and in the homes of the foreign- ers. I shall be interested to hear of any work which your Chapter may do for the Immigrant along the lines of these sug- gestions, and shall be most happy to an- swer any questions concerning the Guide or upon other Immigrant matters upon which I may chance to be informed. Sincerely yours, Alice Louise McDuffee. 17 Open Letter from Chairman of Magazine Committee In accordance with the order of the Twenty-fifth Continental Congress to send the magazine hereafter to all the members of the Society who are in good standing, the Sep- tember or October issue will be sent to each Daughter not now on the subscription list, who is in good standing. Those who are already subscribers will hereafter continue to receive the magazine at the expiration of their present subscription. This larger circulation starts with either the September or October number as it is for these issues that the adver- tisers place their appropriations. In order to bring our files up to date, those who are in arrears are requested to remit promptly. Statements of your arrears were sent in the March and April numbers of the magazine, and I trust you will give the matter your attention. State and Chapter Chairmen are earnestly requested to secure as many subscribers as possible who are not members. Libraries, historians, genealogists, and reading-rooms in public schools and institutions should be particularly interested subscribers. With a circulation of 92,000, local firms will find our magazine a splendid advertising medium. When the advertising rates are established, a schedule will be sent and you are requested to secure as many advertisements as you can. Again I would call your attention to certain passages in my letter of September 8, 1913, which are equally applicable now. \"Read not only the magazine but the ad- been read, thereby making his attitude toward vertisements as well and write to the adver- our publication a friendly one. tiser with reference to matters of personal . \"|£ individual members will do their part interest to you, whether the correspondence in fulfilling these requests the magazine will uncles.. j , ,„-•*:„„ j1M1,c soon be on a solid financial footing and your results in a sale or not, and in writing always efforts> both individually and collectively, will mention that you are referring to the adver- bHng not only a profit but a grati£ying and tisement appearing in the Daughters of the added prestige to our great society from the American Revolution magazine. It indicates position of prominence its official organ can to the advertiser that his advertisement has be made to occupy.\" \"No Chapter should send more than one report each year to the magazine. Do not send the same report that is prepared for the Proceedings of Congress or the Report to the Smithsonian Institution. Please confine the information embodied in the reports to matters that will be valuable and interesting to the Society as a whole. Material for insertion in the magazine should be sent to the Editor, Memorial Continental Hall, Washington, D. C, and not to the printers or to me. All Chapters kindly take note of this. \"Your Chairman makes a special appeal to each and every one of you to take a re- newed and stronger personal interest in the magazine and to work for it with perseverance and energetic loyalty. In reviewing past history pertaining to the varied situations that went to the making of our own and other countries, the world over, we know that the lack of loyalty in some form has been the factor in disintegration or led to the crippling if not the final overthrow of that very nation itself.\" Thanking you in advance for the assistance I know you will give your Chairman in her endeavor to carry out the order of Congress, I am Faithfully yours, 18 Florence G. Finch, Chairman. Miss Florence G. Finch, Chairman of the Magazine Committee. 19 State Conferences FLORIDA The Fourteenth Annual Conference of the Florida D. A. R. assembled in Jack- sonville February 10-11-12 at the Wind- sor Hotel, amid the palms, flowers and fountains, with many of our fair State's patriotic women in attendance. Our hostess, the Katherine Livingston Chapter, welcomed thirty-two delegates, twice as many alternates, and many vis- iting daughters and their friends. Mrs. William Cumming Story, the President General, honored the State with her presence and added greatly to the interest and benefit of the conference. Mrs. Story has a charming personality and is a most delightful and forceful speaker. These qualities, combined with great poise and grace, add much to the dignity of her high office. On Wednesday evening, Feb. 9th, the hostess chapter entertained at a reception in the Windsor Hotel in honor of the President General, the State Regent of Florida and prominent Daughters from other States. Thursday, Feb. 10th, at ten in the morning, the conference was opened with an invocation by the Rev. Thompson, curate of St. John's Episcopal Church, and pledge of allegiance led by the State Regent was given. Mrs. May S. Wiken- burg very delightfully sang \"Your Flag and My Flag,\" and Mrs. J. A. Craig, Regent of the hostess chapter, in a few well chosen words, welcomed the Daugh- ters. This was responded to by Mrs. H. M. Burrows, Regent of Col. Arthur Erwin Chapter. The State Regent, Mrs. M. W. Car- ruth, gave greetings to members of the conference and honor guests, and intro- duced to the Daughters and the club women present the President General. Mrs. Story gave a most delightful ad- dress, full of interesting facts, one of which was the great reduction of the debt on Memorial Continental Hall, a subject near the hearts of all Daughters. Following this, Mrs. Wikenburg sang Mrs. M. W. Carruth, State Regent \"Our Emblem,\" the song dedicated to Mrs. Story. The State Regent then called upon Mrs. Minnie Moore Wilson, who spoke on \"The Seminole Indians, Living Images in Bronze\" ; of their trials and harsh treatment by the white man. Mrs. J. G. Christopher, honorary State Regent, addressed the assembly, after which the State Secretary read a letter from Mrs. D. G. Ambler, also honorary State Regent, who expressed her regrets at her inability to be present. A rising vote of regards was given Mrs. Ambler. Following this, Mrs. Katherine Living- ston Egan, also an honorary State Re- , gent, spoke to the Daughters. \"The following then addressed the con- ference : Mrs. Young, one of the directors of the General Federation of Women's Clubs; Mrs. W. S. Jennings, State President of the Florida Federation of Women's Clubs ; Mrs. F. E. Jennings, President of the Jacksonville Woman's Club, who gave us greeting and talked regarding the work being done by the women; Miss 20 STATE CONFERENCES 21 Ella M. Rorabuck, State President of the Daughters of 1812, who read a very in- teresting paper on the work of her soci- ety. The Regent then called upon Mrs. Guernsey, State Regent of Kansas, and guest of the hostess chapter, who spoke of the work in her State. Mrs. Amos H. Norris, the Regent of DeSoto Chapter (of which Mrs. Carruth was the organizing regent and an enthu- siastic member) then stepped forward and in words full of love and kindly feel- ing presented the State Regent with the regent's bar. She said she did not doubt but that all of the Florida D. A. R. would gladly have contributed to the gift, but DeSoto Chapter wanted it to come from them to their ex-Regent and present State Regent. Mrs. Carruth responded in ap- preciative words. The report of the State officers, State Chairmen and Chapter Re- gents gave splendid accounts of a full year's work. The conference was a great success from start to finish. The social functions were numerous, the reception given by Mrs. John G. Christopher in honor of the President General, and the State Regent, being particularly brilliant, and the Jack- sonville Chapter meeting at Mrs. T. P. Denham's a charming tribute to Mrs. Story and Mrs. Carruth. The Daughters were guests for luncheons given by the hostess chapter both days of conference. On Thursday night about one hundred patriotic Daughters of the American Rev- olution gathered in the Windsor Hotel to enjoy a banquet planned by the Kath- erine Livingston Chapter for the pleas- ure of the delegates to the fourteenth annual conference in honor of the present and past State Regents of Florida. The tables were adorned with fragrant yellow jasmine, typical of Florida. During the serving of the sumptuous banquet a program of patriotic airs ren- dered by the Windsor orchestra added to the pleasure of the guests. The surprise of the evening was the birthday cake. Katherine Livingston Chapter was six years old on Friday and Thursday night celebrated the occasion with the delegate to the conference. A beautifully frosted birthday cake bearing six lighted tapers for each year, and one long taper to \"grow on\" was the signal for applause. Mrs. Edgar H. Lewis, Regent of the Cora Stickney Harper Chapter, of Fort Pierce, gracefully toast- ed the hostess chapter, and regents of other chapters in the state extended greetings from their chapters. Mrs. Melville W. Carruth, State Re- gent of Florida, paid a glowing tribute to the President General, in her toast, and Mrs. Story spoke feelingly on Patriotism in the broadest sense. Other toasts were enjoyed until a late hour. This was the first banquet enjoyed by the D. A. R. conference in Florida and proved a decided success. The election of the officers for the coming year resulted as follows : State Regent, Mrs. M. W. Carruth. State Vice-Regent, Mrs. A. L. Forde. Next year the conference will be held in DeLand, Colonel Arthur Irwin Chap- ter, hostess. — (Mrs. J. S., Jr.) Antoi- nette Arnold, State Historian. PENNSYLVANIA The Nineteenth State Conference of the Daughters of the American Revolu- tion of Pennsylvania was entertained in Pittsburgh by the Pittsburgh Chapter, October 25, 26 and 27, 1915. The busi- ness sessions were held in the Twentieth Century Club, with Miss Emma L. Cro- well, State Regent, presiding. After an invocation by the Right Rev- erend Cortlandt Whitehead, D. D., Bishop of Pittsburgh, and addresses of welcome by Mrs. Robert T. Reineman, Regent of the Pittsburgh Chapter, Mrs. William D. Hamilton, President of the Twentieth Century Club, and response by the State Regent, Miss Crowell, the Daughters had the privilege of hearing an extremely interesting address on \"Pennsylvania's Contribution to Science\" by Dr. John A. Brashear, who is himself considered the greatest contribution Pennsylvania has ever given to the scien- tific world. Reports of the officers and all Chair- men of Committees were heard and ap- preciated. These reports were inter- 22 DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION MAGAZINE spersed with music by members of the chapter, and a stereopticon lecture on \"Memorial Continental Hall,\" by Mrs. Samuel A. Ammon and Miss Denniston. The conference rules, which had been in use when the organization was an undelegated body, were replaced by by- laws, adopted after much careful thought and consideration. On Monday evening the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie Institute invited the delegates to visit the Institute. The only social feature of the confer- ence to which all the delegates and mem- bers of the chapter and visiting Daugh- ters were invited was a reception at the residence of Mrs. S. Jarvis Adams. On Wednesday afternoon a visit was made in automobiles to the historic Block House of Fort Pitt and other points of interest in and about Pittsburgh. The delegates were received at the Block House by the President, Mrs. Samuel A. Ammon, and the Board of Directors of the Daughters of the American Revolu- tion of Allegheny County. At the conclusion of this ride the fac- ulty of the Carnegie Institute of Tech- nology invited the delegates to visit the schools. They were afterwards the guests of the Pittsburgh Chapter at a buffet supper at the Margaret Morrison Memorial School. In the evening the students of the Department of the Drama gave a play in the theatre of the School of Design. Florence Jones Reineman, Regent of the Pittsburgh Chapter. The History and Significance of the American Flag By Emily Katharine Ide, 65 Rutland St. — Boston, Mass. The Etiquette of the Stars and Stripes. Being an Account of the National and Personal Salutes Required by the United States Army Regulations. These two books by the same author, giving the history of the American Flag in a concise manner, are especially ap- propriate at this time. Each of them has for a frontispiece a beautiful fac- simile of the Flag ; with a quotation from Henry Ward Beecher : \"Our Flag carries American ideas, American history, and American feelings. It is not a painted rag. It is a whole National history. It is the Constitution. It is the Government. It is the free peo- ple that stand in the Government on the Constitution. Forget not what it means ; and for the sake of its ideas, be true to your country's Flag.\" Three suggested programs for Flag Day are given, illustrations of the differ- ent Flags of our country, and a number of Flag tributes in poetry and prose, to- gether with a short sketch of Francis Scott Key and Rev. Francis Smith, and a copy of their respective poems. Under Miscellaneous Facts are found answers to many questions liable to be asked about the Flag. Every school teacher, or com- panion of children, should have a copy of each book as a reference guide, and any patriotic American will be happier to possess a copy. Correction Through a typographical error the name of the author of the very interesting article on Andrew Ellicott which appeared in the June issue was given as Sylvester Barber. It should have been Amherst Willoughby Barber, a gentleman distinguished for his own ability as well as for being the husband of the Regent of the Columbia Chapter, Mrs. Velma Sylvester Barber. Old Glory Twenty-three years older than the flag now in use in Great Britain and older than the flags now in use in Spain, Italy, France and Germany. Work of the Chapters Owing to the number of chapter reports awaiting publication the Editor has been obliged to omit a great many interesting descriptions of social affairs, or matters of local interest. The desire of the individual chapter or its members has to be sacrificed for the good of the whole. If the chapter historian will remember that there are over fifteen hundred chapters in existence ; that this Department is not established for the purpose of publishing an annual report — -that should be sent to the State Regent — but to record work which may be of value for other chapters ; and that all reports should be written on only one side of the paper, and if possible be typewritten, it will greatly facilitate matters. The reports are arranged alphabetically according to states and alphabetically according to chapters in the states. was presented to the city of Los Angeles by Mrs. W. W. Stilson, former State Regent, and present Regent of the Ca- brillo Chapter, who said in part: \"The women who organized our soci- ety have resolved to perpetuate the mem- ory of men and women responsible for the achievement of American indepen- dence, to encourage patriotism and the spirit of Americanism. The desire is to teach patriotism by the erection of mon- uments, thereby promoting the cause of education, especially the study of history and all that makes for good citizenship. Cabrillo Chapter (Los Angeles, Cali- fornia) celebrated the presence of the President General, Mrs. William Cum- ming Story, and National Officers, hr California, by unveiling Sunday after- noon, September 19, 1915, in the pres- ence of over one thousand persons, a tablet to Juan Roderigo Cabrillo, Dis- coverer of California. The memorial is in the form of a bronze tablet set in a block of granite and it was placed im- mediately in front of the museum build- ing. Following the invocation, the tablet Rosamond Stilson, unveiling tablet erected to Cabrillo, California's Discoverer by Los Angeles D. A. R. 23 24 DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION MAGAZINE \"Believing history to be a precious leg- acy, we present this tablet as a memorial to that intrepid explorer, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, a native of Portugal but in the employ of Charles I of Spain. Cabrillo was the first white man to visit this coast. He died a year after reaching here, but his comrades kept the log of events and it was placed in the archives of Madrid. \"I, the Regent and representative of those who have given the tablet, present it to the city of Los Angeles, hoping that it will be an incentive to the study of his- tory and will cause all to remember that brave sailor, Cabrillo, and the value of his service to California.\" The tablet was then unveiled by little Rosamond Stilson, the eight-year-old grandchild of the Regent. Little William Winter Stilson was to have assisted his sister in the unveiling ceremony, but owing to illness he was unable to be present. The tablet is inscribed with an old sailing ship bounded by the figures 1542 and 1915, the year that Cabrillo discov- ered California and the year of the mon- ument's erection. There also appears : \"Erected in memory of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo by members and friends of the Cabrillo Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.\" Mayor Sebastian then accepted the tablet in the name of the city, and after appropriate addresses by the President General, the State Regent of California, Mrs. Maynard Force Thayer, and others, the benediction was pronounced by Dean McCormack. — Mrs. W. W. Stilson, Regent. Norwalk Chapter (Norwalk, Connec- ticut) in its earlier days erected a monu- ment to the memory of Governor Lud- low, who purchased the town from the Indians. A granite slab marks the spot where General Tryon stood when he burned the town of Norwalk in 1779. Another stone stands where the battle of the \"Rocks\" took place; and where the patriots, though greatly outnumbered, made a heroic stand against the foe. A cannon ball found on Flag Hill, where a skirmish took place, is embedded in gran- ite to commemorate the event. All these things were done by the patriotic women of the chapter in the early days of the Society. Since then the chapter has done pro- gressive work. It has educated a girl in the Southern mountains; and now is aiding one of Connecticut's bright boys to become an honor to the State. Copies of the \"Loyalty Pledge\" were placed in the public libraries for signa- tures; and quite a large sum of money was raised for the Belgian Relief work. At a recent meeting it was decided to recommend the adoption of the apple blossom as the National flower. This blossom is grown in nearly all the States ; and its beauty, and promise of fruitful- ness make it a typical flower to repre- sent this beautiful and fruitful land of ours. Michigan and Arkansas have al- ready adopted it as a State flower, thus showing its popularity. — Minerva Helen Nash, Historian. Hannah Clarke Chapter (Quitman, Ga.) has striven since its organization in 1907 to follow the great ideals upon which the Daughters of the American Revolution were founded. This year has been no exception. Our meetings have been well attended, interesting historical programs carried out, fol- lowed by a delightful social hour. We have pledged a generous amount to the upkeep of the new Carnegie Library for three years, besides having already contributed to the equipment. A small sum was sent towards the indebtedness on Memorial Continental Hall, and an- other for the purchase of a foot of land adjoining. Our scholarship in special High School was finished in June. The sale of Bel- gium flags on King Albert's birthday was quite a success. The Historical Research Committee has not been idle, although the county history is not yet complete. Plans are under way to place memo- rial tablets in the Court House to Pres- ton S. Brooks and Gen. Quitman, for whom our town and county are named. In November, under the management of the Entertainment Committee, \"Mrs. Jarley's Wax Works\" added $60.00 to our funds. — Grace Gillam Davidson, Historian. WORK OF THE CHAPTERS 25 Cabin Built in 1845, Washington, Iowa Washington Chapter (Washington, Iowa) has the unique distinction of being the only woman's organization in Wash- ington County which can claim a house for its very own. This is all the more interesting because it is the cabin built by Alexander Young in 1845, and was given to the chapter by a son of the pioneer. In early days the cabin was noted for its hospitable shelter; and it is said that no one ever applied for food or shelter and was turned away. The chapter tries by many patriotic deeds to be the worthy owners of a house with such a reputation. One of its works of pleasure is to deco- rate each year on Memorial Day the monument to Timothy Brown, the only Revolutionary soldier buried within the confines of the county. — Clara Conger Wilson, Regent. «k A- ■\"#\" iL 4 Timothy Brown's Monument, Washington, la. Colonial Daughters Chapter (Farm- ington, Maine) celebrated the hundredth anniversary of the birth of one of their members August 31, 1915, at New Shar- on, Maine. The Regent and several other members of the chapter drove to her home in the morning carrying flowers, a birthday cake and other gifts, and in behalf of the chapter the Regent fastened a properly inscribed D. A. R. pin on the dress of the much honored member. Relatives came from near and distant homes bringing good will and numerous gifts, and townspeople and other friends vied with one another in manifestations of respect and love. The schools of the village formed in a procession, and, each grade led by its teacher, passed by the piazza where the lady sat. Their salu- tations as they marched by she acknowl- 26 DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION MAGAZINE edged by waving her hand. Through one of the teachers she gave the boys and girls a \" Godspeed\" in all their com- mendable endeavors. Mrs. White is a granddaughter of Elisha Holman of Sutton (now Mill- bury), Mass., who served the cause of independence as a sergeant in the Revo- lutionary army. He was a brother of Col. Jonathan Holman, the heroic com- mander of the 5th Massachusetts regi- ment, and the Revolutionary ancestor of ex-President William Howard Taft. Mrs. White is the widow of Orville White. She has been the mother of ten children, only two of whom are now living. With one of these, Andrew D. White, she resides and receives the kind- est care. September 25, 1915, a bronze tablet on one face of a granite boulder was unveiled, and dedicated by the chapter with appropriate ceremonies. It bears the following inscription: \"Near this Spot Benedict Arnold's troops Landed When on Their Expedition to Quebec in 1775. Here they Erected a Flag and From This Event The town of Flagstaff Received its Name. \"This tablet is placed by Albert B. Dolbin in memory of his mother, Mrs. Mary P. Dolbin, for Colonial Daughters Chapters, Daughters of the American Revolution, Farmington, Maine, 1915.\" The exercises were conducted by the chapter in connection with the Camp Fire Girls and Blue-birds of Flagstaff. In the address of Mrs. H. P. Keyes, Chap- lain of the chapter, on the pioneers of the town, she dwelt especially on Charles Dolbin, who was the principal owner of the tract of land now comprising the township. Mrs. Charles W. Steele, State Regent, gave a most interesting historical address, spoke of the work of the D. A. R. in various parts of the State and expressed her appreciation of herself and her asso- ciates for the generosity of Mr. Dolbin in placing the tablet as a memorial to his mother and to the patriotism and heroism of Arnold and his soldiers. Mrs. Steele then presented the tablet to the town of Flagstaff; it was accepted in behalf of the township by Maynard E. Wright, Principal of the High School; and the exercises closed with the salute to the Flag, led by the Regent, Mrs. A. M. Greenwood. — (Mrs. A. J.) Hattie E. Linscott, Historian. wmmm :■ : IBB! Mrs. Sophronia Holman White, New Sharon, Me. Frances Dighton Williams Chapter (Bangor, Maine) celebrated Washing- ton's Birthday at the home of Mrs. Co- relli Simpson, one of its members. The Regent, Mrs. Addie Harvey, announced that the gavel she was using was made from a beam of the old home of Francis Scott Key, author of the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" and was a gift from a Wash- ington Daughter, Miss May Hall. She also stated that Miss Emily Huntington Mason, who is compiling a book for the State Department on antique treasures of Maine, wished all members who owned old samplers or china to forward her descriptions and names of the same that they might appear in the book. After recitations, papers and speeches appropriate to the day the members with- drew to the dining-room, where for the first time in America was compounded and served Bouille-Baisse, mentioned by WORK OF THE CHAPTERS 27 Thackeray in his poem of the name, where he describes the recollections of a veteran who had in days of yore par- taken of this dish in some inn, with longing unutterable to do the same again. The recipe was obtained from a lady visiting \"before the war\" in Europe, who had attended a dinner given in honor of William Makepeace Thackeray, and was so pleased with the delicious dish that she copied the recipe, and obtained some of the China saffron, a necessary ingre- dient, which, on her return to America, she shared with Mrs. Simpson. Baltimore Chapter (Baltimore, Mary- land), of which Mrs. John F. Sippel is Regent, celebrated the one hundred and fifty-seventh wedding anniversary of George and Martha Washington, at Arundel Hall. The celebration was largely attended. Mrs. Arthur Lee Bos- ley, our beloved State Regent, was pres- ent, and made a very interesting address. A large wedding cake, with the date of that \"long ago\" wedding iced upon its top, was carried up the aisle by five young girls, dressed in the picturesque costumes of the Colonial period, to our Regent, who cut the first slice. One of the features of the event was the presen- tation to the directors of St. Mary's Sem- inary, St. Marys county, of a copy of an old law, authorizing a lottery to raise $30,000 for the building of a seminary. The law, which is handsomely framed, has been given by Mrs. Walter B. Swin- dell as a memorial to her grandfather, Henry Longitude Seal Ould. The original copy of the law was found by Mrs. George Washington Hodges (Librarian of Baltimore Chapter), of Annapolis, who has discovered many old relics in the cellar of the State House at Annapolis. A musical program was given and a number of patriotic songs were sung by the full chapter in chorus. A paper on the courtship and marriage of George Washington was read by the Historian, and Mrs. A. P. Gove gave a short talk on current patriotism. The meeting closed with the singing of the \"Star Spangled Banner.\" Our chapter is the largest organization of the Daughters in Maryland, having at the present time a membership of two hundred and fourteen. The introduction of choral music at the chapter meetings by our Regent has added greatly to the pleasure of the members. She has also formed a Hospitality Committee, which is very gracious in its work — (Mrs. J. W.) Mary W. Bonner, Historian. Abigail Batcheller Chapter (Whit- insville, Mass.) reports that although it has only fifty-nine members it has raised since its organization in 1903 over ($1200.00) twelve hundred dollars for Patriotic purposes. At its annual meet- ing, May 2, 1916, the Regent, Mrs. How- ard Burbank, was re-elected. During the year the chapter has been entertained as guests of members at Springfield, Wor- cester and Saundersville, has held a patriotic meeting with the Mendon His- torical Society, listened to several pa- triotic addresses and to lectures on Amer- ican Birds and on Historic Homes, and made a number of contributions for worthy objects in this and foreign coun- tries.— Clara A. Wood, Historian. The Boston Tea Party Chapter (Bos- ton, Mass.), under the leadership of its Regent, Mrs. Caroline A. D. Howe, cele- brated the Boston Tea Party December 16, 1915, at Copley-Plaza with an elabo- rate musicale, followed by a large re- ception. It has had several prominent men and women speakers at its monthly meetings, among them being the Lieut. Governor of the State, Hon. Grafton D. Cushing, and an ex-Governor, Hon. Louis A. Frothingham. In February a stereopticon lecture on \"Land of Evange- line and Canadian Rockies\" was given, and in November Mrs. Masury, a former State Regent, spoke on Conservation of the Home. Algonquin Chapter (St. Joseph, Michigan). — Through the persistent ef- forts of our honorary Vice-Regent, Mrs. Harvey J. Campbell, who has constantly kept before us the necessity of marking the old Territorial Road, the members of the Algonquin Chapter, D. A. R., of St. Joseph and Benton Harbor, had become very much interested in a realization of this work, and on Oct. 23, 1915, the fruits of this effort were realized in the un- veiling of two bronze tablets, one where 28 DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION MAGAZINE the trail passed through Benton Harbor and the other at the terminal of the Old Territorial Road at St. Joseph. As a token of respect and appreciation to the memory of those early men and women who first blazed the way for us, and made a pathway for the pioneer through the virgin forest of our State, the members of the chapter and many friends gathered on a beautiful autumn after- noon and unveiled the tablets with fitting ceremonies. Following the opening exercises of a prayer and the reading of the act of the Michigan Territorial Legislature of 1829, which created the commission and em- powered the members thereof to lay out and see to the building of the Territorial Road, a short and interesting talk was given by Hon. Nathan V. Lovell, a pio- neer of Michigan. He told in a graphic way of the early life and of the hard and exciting trips of a twenty miles jour- ney with an ox team over the Territorial Road — the only laid-out road in this cor- ner of the State. The boulder was then unveiled by Billy Minary and Luman Gray ; the latter lad's grandfather drove along this road seven- ty-five years ago, drawing his wheat from Keeler to St. Jospeh, then a four days' trip. Mrs. C. K. Minary, Regent of the chap- ter, presented the monument to the city \"as a proper token of gratitude for the work accomplished by our forefathers and to create and promote an historic sentiment in the minds of the present and future generations.\" She said in part: \"This boulder marks the. Old Terri- torial Road — one of the two lines by which emigration came into Michigan, and it is fitting that we thus express our appreciation of the courageous men and women who endured hardship and braved peril in the advancement of civilization. \"Through the interest of H. Stanley Morton this boulder was procured from the farm of Charles Reynolds, near Mil- burg. Mr. Reynolds donated it to Al- gonquin Chapter, and Mr. Morton had it brought in and erected on this spot. \"The inscription tablet has been placed on this boulder by Algonquin Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution. As their Regent I dedicate it to the mem- ory of the pioneer men and women of Berrien County and present it to the city.\" In his speech of acceptance, Mayor Ryno said: \"This large boulder with its bronze plate, in its present location, not only marks a State road, but stands as a monument to the sacrifices made and the energies expended in bringing Michigan from an area abounding in primeval for- ests to a State, first in its variety of hus- bandry and natural resources. The won- derful growth of our State can be at- tributed almost altogether to the foresight of our pioneer officials, who saw the ne- cessity of the early establishment of State roads.\" He continued with a brief his- tory of the road, which followed an old Indian trail from Detroit to Saranac, now St. Joseph, located as it is at the mouth of the St. Joseph river, for, like all old Indian trails, it followed the ridges in the \"timbered lands\" and the prairies in the \"oak openings.\" Business by stage coach was transact- ed over this highway for many years ; a stream of pioneers from New York and the other neighboring States were pour- ing into this region. \"In this locality St. Joseph was the first to profit through this thoroughfare and through the growth of this city is connected the birth of Ben- ton Harbor.\" Immediately following the ceremonies in Benton Harbor exercises of a like character were held at the unveiling of ., ,.n ~r, ..,.. . :..,, \"'' \" ' \"\"' : iU.M£ Tdl TEJiyJJiLO, Of Tli£ Aj'JSIUOili* lit yOLUTiOil ■ .^~;. 0? iiiZil SOU) if'/ l~J~l\"J Tablet Erected by the Algonquin Chapter D.

In his speech of acceptance Mayor Dickonson was very warm in his pra;se of the work of the D. A.

May they acquaint themselves with the pioneer effort which made for the comfort they are now able to enjoy.\" With the flag pledge by the members of the Algonquin Chapter and the sing- ing of \"America\" the services were con- cluded.— Grace V. Canavan, Historian. realized an account will be sent the maga- zine. Menominee Chapter (Menominee, Michigan) has continued its local patri- otic work throughout the last two years. On August 13, 1915, the chapter enter- tained the State Regent, Mrs. William Wait ; and later in the month organized a Boys' Club. December 5, 1915, a lecture on Yellowstone Park, illustrated with col- ored slides, was given by Col. Mott, Man- ager of Upper Peninsula Development Bureau, and eighty-five boys attended. Since then the club has grown to such an extent that it has been found neces- sary to engage the help of the High School Seniors in overseeing the games. Two rooms have been given the chapter in one of the school buildings by the School Board to carry on its work, and much enthusiasm has been shown. — Josephine Sawyer, Historian. Monument Chapter (Minneapolis, Minn.), being desirous to engage in some especial patriotic work, became interested in an account of an endowed flagstaff which had been raised in Lawrence, Mass., the only one in this country, and the second known in the world. With great enthusiasm the chapter decided to work for a similar flagstaff and to pre- sent it to the city of Minneapolis; com- mittees were formed, and a mammoth bazaar, called \"The Flagstaff Bazaar,\" was planned. This was held during the month of November, 1915, and four thousand dollars, within one thousand dollars of the desired sum, was raised. It is hoped that the entire sum will be raised and the flagstaff presented to the city July 4, 1916 ; and if our dreams are During the year 2,000 flags were given the Boy Scouts of St. Paul and Min- neapolis, asking them to keep in memory the words: \"Peace through Prepared- ness.\" The chapter has also sent a large basket of toys to a children's home, and a number of articles to the Girls' Friendly Society. At present the Relief Work is engaging the time and attention of the members. — (Mrs. A. L.) Clara Pea- body Crocker. Gallatin Chapter (Trenton, Mo.) is rejoicing in the passage of the act desig- nating the first Monday in October of each year as Missouri Day, as it is main- ly through the persistent efforts of one of its members that the bill became a law. The day was devised primarily to unite all organizations in bonds of fraternal feeling; to foster a love for the history of Missouri ; to teach the rising genera- tion of boys and girls the glories of Mis- souri ; and to encourage patriotism and promote all lines of interest in our for- ward march of progress. A copy of the bill with historical reference was put in a box and placed in the cornerstone of the new State Capitol; a framed copy hung in the Missouri Building at the Panama-Pacific Exposition; and another copy is on file in the Archives of the State Historical Society of Missouri at Columbia. October was selected for various rea- sons. Primarily, it commemorates the establishing of the seat of government at Jefferson City, October 1, 1826; Mis- souri is at her best in October; the weather conditions are most conducive to study and enjoyment after a period of mental rest; the state flower \"Golden Rod\" is blooming resplendent in vale and glen ; and the end of the harvest bespeaks the glory of Missouri's resources and lends material in demonstrating her great- ness, wealth and power. \"All praise to old Missouri, To her people, staunch and true ; To the flag that floats above her, Of the red, white and blue. And honor to our Country, And our God whom we adore, Whose guidance we petition Henceforth forevermore.\" 30 DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION MAGAZINE Muskingum Chapter (Zanesville, O.) reports a successful year, with increas- ing interest in the work of the Society. Our membership is now forty-one. All obligations have been met. We have col- lected and sent $46.80 to the Belgian Re- lief Commission in response to an appeal from the National Society. $5.00 has been paid towards the Ohio panel in Valley Forge Memorial Chapel, and $2.50 towards the purchase of land by Conti- nental Hall. The main topics of discussion at our meetings were relics and memorials of the past. The old books, the poetry, speeches, songs, the ornaments and the gardens of our ancestors were consid- ered and many valuable books and curios belonging to the Daughters were shown. The gala meeting of the year was on Flag Day, and was held at the residence of the Regent, Mrs. Wells. Flags formed the decorations and the program of songs and readings dealt with the National em- blem. Mention was made by several members of some recent instances where the flag had been misused, through igno- rance, and a better education of the peo- ple in this respect was urged. As the Fourth of July came on Sun- day, the Regent proposed that members of the chapter make addresses in the Sunday schools on the duty of respect for the emblem of our country. With the kind co-operation of friends, this was done. The Sunday schools of the city and the neighboring village of Dresden and the two Children's Homes were vis- ited and addressed, and we feel that much good was accomplished. — Hester Pills- bury, Historian. Chemeketa Chapter (Salem, Oregon) was formally organized Nov. 26, 1915, the State Regent, Mrs. Isaac Lee Patter- son, presiding. Officers, headed by Mrs. Sarah Carke Dyer, as Regent, were elect- ed for the new chapter. Its name, Che- meketa, is a Calapooia Indian name for the locality of the village where North Salem now stands, and means \"place of rest.\" Dr. William Willson, pioneer of 1837, was the original town proprietor of Salem, and the one who changed its name to Salem, naming it for Salem, Mass. He said that the Hebrew word \"peace\" was substantially the same as the Indian j one, Chemeketa. Therefore, whether the name continues to be Chemeketa or Salem, a \"City of Peace\" we must be. The father of our State Regent, Cyrus S. Woodworm, was a pioneer of 1849 from Vermont, and a lover of trees. When the town was young Dr. Willson gave us a park and Mr. Woodworth, then Councilman, planted the trees which we so much enjoy. Our twenty-seven members represent every part of the Union from Maine to California, and our chapter and State Regents are native Oregonians. We cele- brated the birthdays of Lincoln and Washington with appropriate exercises, and are now planning an exhibit of relics of the Revolution. We have some very enthusiastic members who are in close touch with the schools, where they em- phasize the American ideals and alle- giance to our Flag. — Lillian Gertrude Applegate, Historian. Andrew Hamilton Chapter (Abbe- ville, South Carolina), while only five years old, has much to its credit. Situ- ated as it is in a locality rich in historical interest, the members have directed their efforts mainly towards bringing to light and publishing hitherto unpublished rec- ords. Abbeville was settled by Scotch Irish, who came to a great extent from Penna. through Virginia ; and by Hugue- nots from France. Hundreds of the wills, etc., of these early settlers are in the Court House at Abbeville, and much historical data has been found there. Realizing the unquestionable value this is to the D. A. R. archives, we have undertaken to put it into the proper form, and to publish it as soon as possible. This year the chapter had a beautiful room given it in the Municipal Building of the town, and we are furnishing it as a chapter room. Next year we hope to hold our meetings there. We have contributed to many enter- prises embraced in the D. A. R. work; but we have decided to make our largest possible contribution in the future to the Industrial School for Mountain Girls, which the D. A. R. in S. C. are endeavor- ing to establish. — Antoinette Russell, Recording Sec'y. WORK OF THE CHAPTERS 31 MacPherson Chapter (Aberdeen, South Dakota) was organized April 2, 1913, with a membership of twenty. The first year's program consisted of papers and talks relative to the history of our own State; the second year's study was along the line of Colonial history ; and during the past year several very inter- esting papers have been presented per- taining to the various phases of Colonial life and the customs of that period. The chapter has now offered prizes to pupils in the eighth grade of the public schools for the best papers dealing with the Revolutionary War — the first prize to be a fine silk flag, the second prize a smaller flag. The regular meetings are very interesting and profitable ; and once or twice in the year the husbands of the members are invited and a feast is served, hinting of the days of Washington and his compatriots. — (Mrs. H. C.) Cor- nelia A. C. Andrews, Historian. Old Glory Chapter (Franklin, Tenn.) on March 15, 1916, placed a very hand- some bronze marker at the tomb of Gen. Andrew Jackson. Miss Louise G. Linds- ley, Regent of the Cumberland Chapter, D. A. R., and also First Vice-Regent of the Hermitage Association, extended the hospitalities of the place and greeted the guests. This was followed by an address on Andrew Jackson by Miss Susie Gen- try, founder of the chapter in 1897, and one of its most prominent members, who said in part: \"Men, like things, are measured in dif- ferent ways, standards, but all great men are best measured by the rule of three — length, breadth and depth: How long they have been remembered, how widely are they known, and how deeply have they impressed themselves on the public mind? \"Let us apply this rule to Andrew Jack- son and see if he measures up to a great man. We are to-day memorializing the fact that he was born one century and a half ago, lacking one year — he has been remembered. He is known wherever American history is read — therefore he is widely known. He impressed himself so deeply on the public mind that he be- came the seventh President of the United States, 'the hero of New Orleans/ and the governor of Florida, and, I may add, the first man to have an equestrian statue self-poised on the hind feet, and modeled and cast in the United States — still the rule of three applied. \"Andrew Jackson has been honored and memorialized in many ways, but Providence left it for the charter mem- bers of Old Glory Chapter, D. A. R., of Franklin, Tenn., to add one more leaf to his laurel wreath of fame, memorializing him as a Revolutionary soldier. \"History tells us that shortly after the death of Hugh Jackson, Andrew's elder brother — which occurred just after the battle of Stono, from fatigue and the heat of the day — that 'both Robert and Andrew joined the American army, and were present at the battle of Hanging Rock, on August 6, 1780, in which the corps to which they belonged particularly distinguished itself.' \"Knowing Andrew Jackson as we do, we know that wherever he was there was something doing. He was neither boy nor man to see others in the fray and he not have a part in it. We are here to- day to recall these facts — not that they do Andrew Jackson any good, but it bene- fits us to think on these things, as the seeing and thinking of the true, the beau- tiful and the good always makes better the person. \"Did you ever think why the soldier is so often, and more than other men, me- morialized in bronze and stone? For the reason that when he shoulders his mus- ket he says to himself and the world, 'I will face death for a principle and the good of my country,' which is but another name for 'my people.' \"It is the exalted spirit of abnegation that we admire and honor, not the man's pugilistic qualities. No statue has ever been erected to a mere 'fighter' ; none will ever be, until we retrograde to that dark age where 'might makes right.' Croesus has no statue, nor has or will have any of his mammon-followers until they come to themselves, clothed and in their right minds, and dispense their wealth in chari- ties. \"I feel most deeply the honor and pleasure of having been chosen by Provi- dence to organize Old Glory Chapter in 1897, and to have suggested to my co- 32 DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION MAGAZINE charter members the placing of this latest memorial to Andrew Jackson, the boy sol- dier of the Revolutionary War.\" Mrs. Atha Thomas placed, with appro- priate remarks, a wreath of ivy upon the marker, and Mrs. A. B. Dozier, the pres- ent Regent of Old Glory Chapter, planted a handsome silk flag near by. It is in- tended that a similar flag be always in the standard. There are now nine mark- ers at the tomb and nine patriotic socie- ties have honored themselves by paying their tribute to the old hero. William Scott Chapter (Bryan, Texas) was organized in January, 1916, at the home of its Regent, Mrs. W. G. Taliaferro, who had spent months in strenuous effort to collect the proper data, and arrange satisfactorily to the authori- ties in Washington all preliminary steps. After the election of officers, a gavel was presented by Mrs. Fulgham, a former Daughter of Miss., but now a member of the William Scott Chapter. This gavel was made from a section of a cedar tree, which grew in the yard of Mississippi's only Real Daughter, Mrs. Maria R. Ben- nett, National number 3454. The storm of March 2, 1913, blew down the tree and Mrs. Bennett sent a section of the cedar to the Copiah Chapter, Crystal Springs, Miss., to be made into gavels and sold to raise money for Continental Hall. Now the William Scott Chapter is the proud possessor of one, offered by Mississippi's daughter to a chapter whose first Regent is a native Mississippian. At our first regular meeting we appro- priated ten dollars to buy books for the Carnegie library in the town; and upon receiving the appeal for Belgium sent forty dollars accruing from the sale of the flags. — Mrs. Mary M. Raysor, His- torian. La Crosse Chapter (La Crosse, Wis- consin) has just completed the twentieth year of its existence. Education in pa- triotism and training for a higher and better quality of citizenship has from its founding been emphasized as the chief work of this chapter and a new and active campaign along these lines started Febru- ary 22, 1915, when the annual celebra- tion of Washington's Birthday was made the occasion of a large entertainment, one of the principal features of which was the presentation to the City Public Library of a silk Flag, which now floats on special occasions above the main entrance. The Flag talk given on that occasion has been repeated in various sections of the city ; and has done much to inculcate added respect for the National emblem through fuller knowledge of its origin, history and symbolism. A social center has been established at Bethany Center School, and a series of historical stories told each week. This course, starting with Miles Standish and the Plymouth Colony, covered most of the old-time favorites in Colonial and Revolutionary history, and included also an account of our well-known local pioneer and trader, Nathan Myrick, and the Story of the Mound Builders, illustrated by descrip- tion of our own park group of mounds. This series is to be continued next year, and will include much more of our own romantic State history. Still other Bethany work, in which our members have been interested, has been the organization of a Musical Chorus, the management of several social eve- nings for the people of the neighborhood and the formation of a Tooth Brush Bri- gade, organized along the lines suggested by the National Charity Officer, D. A. R. The contests have caused much interest and over two hundred young people have enrolled as brigade members. For many years the chapter has en- deavored to stimulate interest in history, and twenty-one prizes for essays have been distributed ; but these have been among the children of the lower grades. This past year, during the Regency of Mrs. George W. Burton, prizes of ten dollars each have been offered to the stu- dents of the city High and Normal Schools for the best essay on some sub- ject of American history. It is expected that ex-President Taft will deliver the prize given to the Normal student; and that the High School prize essay will be read at the graduation exercises. The chapter has recently voted one hun- dred dollars towards the Loan and Schol- arship Fund established and administered by the High School Alumni Assn. for WORK OF THE CHAPTERS 33 the purpose of assisting worthy and needy students of our town either to re- main in the local schools until graduation or to continue their education in higher institutions. The contribution was given with the recommendation that \"other things being equal, that applicant for financial aid be given preference who has done and expects to continue work along the lines of American history and insti- tutions.\" Along civic and philanthropic work the chapter has also aided the Summer Camp branch of the Baby Welfare Work, raised a year's salary for the City Visiting Nurse, and donated twenty-five dollars to the American Red Cross. Washington's Birthday was celebrated by a Colonial tea, to which the members were invited to appear in old-fashioned dress and bring with them their knitting or patch-work. The games, decorations and place cards were all in keeping with the day. Many cherished and handsome old costumes were displayed, one of the most interesting being a beautiful flow- ered white silk gown worn by the great- grandmother of its present owner at one of the official receptions given in the Presidential Mansion by General and Lady Washington. During the coming year we hope to mark the location of the first building in La Crosse, and also to aid in placing a boulder in Pettibone Park to mark the spot of the original Myrick trading sta- tion. Full particulars will appear in our next year's report. — Miss Helen Dor- set, Vice-Regent. Milwaukee Chapter (Milwaukee, Wis.) celebrated its twenty-third birth- day on February 14, 1916. A party was held at the home of one of the early members — each Daughter having re- ceived a small silken bag with a slip of paper, reading : YOUR OWN BIRTHDAY PARTY. The D. A. R. with greetings most hearty Feel sure you will come to your own birthday party. This birthday party is given for you, Tis something novel, 'tis something new. We send to each this little sack, Please either to bring it or send it back With as many pennies as you are years old, (We promise this number shall never be told.) The bags were brought to the party and handed to the Treasurer. The com- bined ages numbered 4,042 years. The honored guest was Mrs. Louisa K. Thiers, a beloved Real Daughter, 101 years old. This dear lady, in a gown of lavender brocade with trimmings of rare old lace, was presented with a Valentine in the form of a rose-bud bouquet. Mrs. Thiers has always taken a keen interest in Milwaukee Chapter's work, and her presence was a joy and inspiration to all. Upon the dining table was a cake with twenty-three red candles, and inscribed — \"MILWAUKEE CHAPTER D. A. R., 1893-1916.\" Several of the members, in- cluding Mrs. Edward Ferguson and Mrs. D. H. Johnson, talked upon the early history of the chapter, adding to the pleasure of the afternoon. Among its works, the chapter is proud of its Flag Lecture. This is given before children and adults to give information concerning our Flag, to show the rever- ence due it; and to awaken a keener in- terest in it and inspire love of Country. The lecture is illustrated with stereopti- con slides, and the evolution of the Flag interestingly told in story and picture. The lecture concludes with the singing of \"The Star Spangled Banner.\" The chap- ter plans to extend the field of its use- fulness by sending the Flag Lecture with its slides to any chapter or organization throughout the State desiring it. Milwaukee Chapter has shown its spe- cial interest in preventing the desecration of the Flag by the appointment of an energetic Committee. At the November meeting, the chapter entertained the Daughters from Wau- kesha, Kenosha, Racine, Port Washing- ton, Sheboygan, Plymouth and Fond du Lac. Luncheon was served at the Hotel Aberdeen and the Flag Lecture given in the Auditorium of the Public Museum, patriotic music being rendered by a V"
