        "text": "Adrian Shooter, former & founding MD of Chiltern Railways sadly passed away on 13th December.\n\nThis is the Darjeeling Railway / Sharp Stewart loco no 778 that he re-patriated & had restored running on his own Beeches Light Railway.\n\nThis image is © Copyright 2022 Tony Teague.

This is a photograph I made several attempts at during a five day stay, having found the spot within the first day.\n\nOf course the photo posted before this was taken just to the left a level below of the same train. And then I found this one hiding amidst a slide show arrangement whilst looking for something else. I thought I had something like it but could not recall exactly.\n\nAt the time I found that there was a clear view across from the top of a small hillock between the Batasi Loop and Ghum but on each day I tried, the clouds always won, always blocking out the sunlight, sometimes fleeting but mostly relentless. Not that it is an unattractive view beneath the clouds, but it is nice to have the best lighting possible to be in agreement with the times that the train runs.\n\nSo here it is, on my last day here it all worked out, and the oldest loco on the line was out working this train too. I think I may already have mentioned it !!, but this one is in its one hundredth year of service at this point in time, a Sharp Stewart design, leaving their Glasgow works in 1892.\n\nAll said and done, after the rigours of the plains below this was a very relaxing part of the trip, a lot of time was spent wandering just taking photos. I would not have been overly disappointed if I only took this view beneath the cloud layers, for the anxiety of missing out had become absent, at Dayangcha just a month prior I had discovered the benefits of time and patience..\n\nwww.flickr.com/photos/99466199@N05/49933296653/in/album-7...\n\nDecember the 20th 1992.\n\nFormer Furness Railway Company (FR Co) No.20, built in 1863, at Carnforth Steamtown on 5th September 1988. Soon surplus to requirements on the FR Co, it was sold on to the Barrow Haematite Steel Co. in 1870, converted from a tender locomotive to a saddle tank, for use at what was then the largest steelworks complex in the world supplying rails to railway companies around the globe. Upon its retirement from industrial use in 1960 after ninety years industrial service, it was presented to George Hastwell Special School in Abbey Road, Barrow, where it languished for over twenty years in their grounds as a static exhibit, until it was purchased privately in 1983 and moved to the Steamtown Railway Museum at Carnforth in Lancashire. In 1996, a Heritage Lottery Fund and other grants enabled the restoration of Furness Railway No. 20 to its original condition as an 0-4-0 tender locomotive. It is now to be found in working order at the Ribble Steam Railway, Preston.\n\n© Gordon Edgar - All rights reserved. Please do not use my images without my explicit permission\n\nThis is the second of Peter's Percy Main negatives, in it we see NCB 22,ex Barry Railway Sharp-Stewart SS4052/1895, it is having some oil added to the coupling rod bearing. Near to the camera is NCB number 33, this loco is a much more recent machine, it was built by the Vulcan Foundry (VF 5306/1945)\n\nAmbling along the main line is an 0-6-0 tender loco, it has 6 heavily laden unfitted coal wagons in tow, the tail lamp is just hung from the coupling. Being unfitted would mean that the only stopping power would be from the locomotive, I would have normally expected to see a brake van. Number 33 has three lamps, one on the front buffer beam facing inward, one on the locomotive lamp iron and a tail light dangling from the shunter's pole, I assume that lamp was for the back of a train.\n\nPeter Shoesmith 01/06/1959\n\nCopyright Geoff Dowling: All rights reserved\n\nOne of the first Royal Visits was in 1901, during the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York's (later King George V and Queen Mary) Tour of the British Empire. The Tour started just over a month after the death of Queen Victoria, with stops in Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, Canada, and Newfoundland\n\nThis photo, however, is not from the 1901 Tour. The trip, although extensive around the world, their stay in South Africa was brief on account of the threat of the flu epidemic. The royal couple, The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York aboard the cruiser the HMS Ophir, first docked in Durban and travelled by train behind a Natal Government Railways Dübs A Class (later SAR class A) from Durban station to Pietermaritzburg, eighty km approx. A few days later, they re-embarked and set sail for Simonstown in the Cape. Here they again travelled by train behind a CGR 3rd Class to Cape Town itself (forty km approx.) and back\n\nPrincess Christian (daughter of Queen Victoria) made a tour of the country in 1904, and the Duke of Connaught toured in 1906. The Prince of Portugal arrived in 1907\n\nJudging from the headboard, the photo shows the 1910 Tour of the Duke and Duchess of Connaught for the opening of the then unified South African Parliament. This was a grand tour of South Africa and the surrounding territories\n\nThe leading locomotive is ex-Orange Free State Railways Nr. 96. It later became CSAR type 6L-3 Nr. 372 and again SAR Class 6E Nr. 603. In 1910 only the CSAR had reboilered their 6th class with Belpaire boilers\n\nLeith Paxton adds the following information:\n\nThe first observation is that the two engines have Belpaire boilers. This, for the period (1910) would indicate that they were therefore CSAR. They introduced this feature in 1905 and at that time only approx sixteen Class 6C (6L-2) and the six Class 6E (6L-3) had these boilers. However, so successful were they that in 1914 SAR embarked on a major reboilering campaign and most (not all) of the class were given Belpaire boilers and bigger cabs\n\nThe running numbers of the CSAR locomotives were 337-345 (6L-1) with SAR 346-369, (6L-2) SAR 541-564 class 6C, and CSAR 333-335 & 370-372 (6L-3) SAR No. 598-603\n\nIf you take the train to Darjeeling you will have got on it at New Jalpaguri, the train will be facing west on the northern edge of the station, and your overnight train most likely started out in Calcutta. When you have gotten off the overnight train, mini bus drivers will have done their best to dissuade you from taking such and inconveniently slow journey up the hill. But of course this slow journey is precisely why you will have come here.\n\nThe train eventually trundles off on the level, pretty much a normal narrow gauge journey, until that is the train reaches the station of Sukna, 12 miles into a 55 mile journey. Here, if you look beyond the loco at the front you will be astonished to see the upwards angle that the track takes just beyond the station. The gradient cannot really be comprehended until you actually see it, around 1 in 20 give or take. Surely it is just a steep section? No it is not, this does not cease until the summit at Ghum, 39 miles later, and at times it gets as steep as 1 in 14. And this does not take into account the lines curvature! The first part of the hill climb up to Tindharia includes three zig zags, a cost effective way to gain height rapidly, and I was keen to get a picture of one. The line on the lower levels is shrouded by greenery, so heavy shadow presents a problem. The angle of the line to the sun also has to be considered, and at zig Zag number two I seize the chance.\n\nSo I have got myself into position at the top of the zig zag, the train having reversed up from the lower section on the near line and into the headshunt. The point operator can be seen squatting on the lever keeping the blades firmly in position as the train blasts out attacking the gradient. He will jump on as the last coach rolls past. I plan the same, though I am further away from the trains starting point then he! The train gains speed rapidly, though hardly going ton up it matches my running pace very well. I am left to run behind the train for half a mile or so until I can gain the space alongside to sprint alongside the last door and jump on. I can admit, the guard was not pleased at this performance!\n\nB class no. 779, a Sharp Stewart two foot gauge 0-4-0 saddle tank of 1892 with the 09:00 New Jalpaguri to Darjeeling.\n\nDecember the 15th 1992.\n\nHEAVY GOODS ENGINE FOR THE PASHA OF EGYPT\n\nThe goods engine, of which we give the accompanying illustrations, has been lately completed and sent to Egypt for the Pasha, by Messrs. Sharp, Stewart and Co., of the Atlas Works, Manchester\n\nThe general character of the engine may be fully understood from the illustratious with which we have been favoured by Mr. Forsyth, the manager of Sharp, Stewart's establishment\n\nThe tender has six wheels. The engine and tender are both very gorgeously decorated. As far os paint and varnish would go, nothing was apparently left undone to make the machinery suit the taste of orientals. The frames uf the engine, as also the funnel and steam chest, were elaborately ornamented, as was also the plating of the tender, which was divided Into panels\n\nIllustration from \"The Engineer\" 30 April 1858\n\nA METAMORPHOSED LOCOMOTIVE\n\nIT is not often that an ordinary locomotive undergoes the remarkable transformation that the engine we illustrate this week has undergone, and we therefore think a short account may be of interest to our readers.\n\nThe original engines were eighteen in number, or nine pairs, and were designed by Messrs. Sharp, Stewart, and Co., in conjunction with Mr. F. B. Trevithick for the Cornwall Minerals Railway, and were delivered in 1878-1874. They were arranged at the hind ends, so that they could be coupled together footplate to footplate and used in pairs. The general design of the engines, viz., the very small wheels and general compactness, was intended to adapt them to the heavy gradients and sharp curves which ruled on the railway in question, and which is now absorbed by the Great Western Railway.\n\nOn the line going into Chancery, owing to the fact that there were no minerals to bo carried, some of the engines were disposed of, and were purchased in 1881 for the Eastern and Midlands Railway, the engines being altered by being fitted with cabs and tenders. Owing to the small wheels the engines have never been suitable, as the Eastern and Midlands Railway is a long single line carrying a fast and highly competitive goods, cattle, and fish traffic, in addition to a growing and important summer passenger traffic to Yarmouth and other seaside resorts. As they were requiring heavy repairs and renewals, it occurred to Mr. Marriott, the company's engineer and locomotive superintendent, that they might, when in the shops, be made a serviceable engine and used for passenger traffic, which they have never been able to take, besides being able to haul the same loads at a higher rate of speed. The remodelled engine we illustrate is the first one so altered, and the result has been entirely satisfactory. The engine has been running passenger and goods trains at an average consumption of about 28lb. per mile over the gradients.\n\nIllustration by John Swain for \"The Engineer\" from October 31, 1890"
