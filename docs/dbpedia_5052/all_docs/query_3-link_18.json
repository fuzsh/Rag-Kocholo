        "text": "From the start of the twentieth century, southern African railways conveyed vast numbers of miners to and from the Rand gold mines in a fluid and contested political and economic setting. The need for a large, continually replenished and low-cost workforce was met by tapping new and distant labour pools. Railways mobilised miners by offering relatively inexpensive, quick, long-distance mass transport. They also curtailed desertion and exhaustion associated with walking. Yet the interests of state-owned railways and mining capital were not completely harmonious. The contribution of trains to migrancy was limited by the geography of a railway network built for other purposes, by geopolitical restrictions on recruiting, by complex and discriminatory tariffs, and by the inefficiency and disunity of railway operations. In the 1930s the reach of railways was enhanced by flexible road transport; thereafter, non-rail modes of transport operated by and for mine-labour agencies, conveyed an increasing share of the stabilising mine workforce. Railways facilitated massive migrancy but might have been even more effective in a better orchestrated and narrower economy. Essential in the first twenty years of industrialised gold mining, railways first entrenched and then prolonged migrancy. Railways were also significant in that they did more than temporarily relocate inert labourers: migration by train was, in addition, a socially and symbolically charged episode.\n\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1849, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jubbulpore branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km (4,000 mi). Hence it became possible to travel directly from Mumbai to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that “it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system”. In this case study I have tried to Historically represent the Introduction and expansion of Railways in British India.. also a look into the still serving oldest Locomotives in India and in the End a brief Chronology about Expansion and Progress of Indian Railway.\n\nIn recent years Industrial Heritage Studies have had a considerable interest in South American countries. Joint academic research conducted by neighbouring countries has become a new challenge, not only through the promotion of research programs but also by interest in finding ways to manage a railway's cultural landscape from a systemic view. Within this framework a comparative study is developing on railway heritage between Brazil (UNESP) and Argentina (UNT-CONICET), where we see convergent processes. The impact produced by the railway system has no similarity during the history of these countries, not after not before. In fact, these territories have the most extensive network in Latin America, nearly 34,059kms (Argentina) and 30,.129 km (Brazil) including undergrounds, urban trains and others. From the beginning of the installation of the railways to the closing down of a great part of the network, we can observe convergences in the railway's historical process. We believe that from a shared vision can be understand the processes of birth, growth and partial deactivation of the railroad, as well as identify the most appropriate tools for a comprehensive management process because of the infrastructure that currently has no rail operation. In this way, it will tend to conserve, as an ultimate aim, a valuable heritage that was the germ of the development of vast territories. Considering the hypothesis that there was a shared history between Brazil and Argentina regarding difficulties relating to railway heritage, the general problem arises from the question: what is the relationship between the railway processes installation of both countries, during the 19 th century and the early 20 th century? On the other hand, we ask: what are the problems related to the management of this heritage, particularly in terms of protection, that has architectural historic value and that are representative of that period? The studies will focus particularly on the State of São Paulo and the Argentine Northwest region whose railway extensions were about 4,000kms (1907) and 4,000kms (1914), respectively, as paradigmatic cases for this comparison. The aim of this research is to make a comparative historical analysis of the English intervention on railway infrastructures and to provide a brief summary of the heritage protection. Methodologically, this study is based on a complex historical process in which we intend to establish: common features, reciprocal influences, similarities and differences in development."
