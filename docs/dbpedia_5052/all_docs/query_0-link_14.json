        "text": "It bears repeating that the SAR & H Administration controlled a far wider spectrum of Government-owned infrastructure than just the railways. Under the SAR & H umbrella, the following:\n\nRailways\n\nHarbours and harbour craft\n\nA comprehensive Country-wide Road Motor Service\n\nLighthouses and other ancillary equipment\n\nSouth African Airways\n\nPipelines\n\nGrain Elevators\n\nHorticultural Nurseries\n\nChildren’s Homes – for railway servant’s families in need.\n\nIn this chapter we concentrate on the harbour craft with a few diversions covering the rail aspect as well as a statue of Queen Victoria mounted outside the Public Library in town.\n\nPort Elizabeth’s Harbour was very well situated, being right on the doorstep of the City with links to the rail system of both gauges – 3ft6in and 2ft. The harbour comprised of the following:\n\nThe Charl Malan Quay; No. 2 & 3 Quays; Bulk Cargo Berth; Tanker Berth.\n\nA 1200-ton slipway was also provided for harbour craft maintenance and the Port Captain’s Office was incorporated in the modern lookout tower.\n\nBefore we continue, I would like to acknowledge the numerous contributions from those listed below:\n\nBruno Martin for his detailed map\n\nThe following persons who contributed photos, captions and technical information.\n\nFr Andrew Scott Davidson, C.Ss.R. for technical info on the harbour craft;\n\nTrevor Jones for his beautiful photographs and captions to go with them;\n\nAlan Buttrum for a wide selection of excellent rail and shipping photographs;\n\nBruce Brinkman for more recent photos of a distinguished visitor and some fascinating WWII photos;\n\nYolanda Meyer for scanning THL photographs;\n\nEric Conradie for the scans of the two historic paintings (photos 1 & 2)\n\nJohannes Haarhoff and theDRISA Website for additional THL Photos;\n\nEurika Deminey who was in charge of the THL at a time when I had access to their SAR negatives of harbour craft and associated equipment which allowed me to print them in my darkroom;\n\nLiesl Hagen; Geoff Hall; Charlie Lewis; Brian Ingpen; David Marshall; Peter Micenko; John Phillips; David Rodgers; Peter Rogers; David Shackleton; Rupert Toms for their superb photos.\n\nLast but not least, Andrew Deacon for formatting this chapter on the website.\n\n4. The North Jetty, which abutted onto Jetty street in the City centre, was completed just in time for the Boer War. This undated photo came from the collection of the late Hans Huisman, for many years Harbour Engineer at Port Elizabeth as well as Chairman of the Historical Society and regular contributor to its magazine. Charlie originally described the engine as being one of the Harbour Board's Kitson saddle tanks but the authority on Harbour Board locomotives (as well as all South African industrials), John Middleton has written with suggested details about the locomotive: \"Although distant, the loco does not look like a Kitson 2-6-0ST to me but rather appears similar to the engine in photo 15 of the North Jetty, see the simple weather board/spectacle plates. The appearance is of a Fox Walker/Peckett product and that would suggest it may be PEHB “A” which was Fox Walker 330 of 1876, the first engine purchased by the Harbour Board, arriving in April 1877.\"\n\n8. Two PE Harbour tanks look ready to draw a heavy-looking load of munitions to the Harbour/CGR exchange yard at North End. Although they have intriguing detail differences (the nearer engine has a larger dome and possibly a larger saddle tank) they both appear to be 2-6-0Ts from the 1875 batch of Kitsons, originally built for the Midland section of the CGR.\n\nHere is South Africa's acknowledged authority on its Industrial and Harbour locomotives, John Middleton's comment:\n\n\"This is absolutely wonderful and provides much food for thought. The Kitson’s acquired by the PEHB have caused a huge amount of speculation over the years and Holland doesn’t help by getting details mixed up. The SAR Rolling Stock Register shows three of these with PEHB – Harbour letters “I”, “J” and “O”, scrapped between 1912-1932. The only one we know for certain is O which was supplied new by Kitsons as their No. 4245 of 1903 to almost the CGR design. The new loco Kitson 4245 is known to have had larger cylinders than its CGR predecessors and is therefore maybe the loco with the larger more modern dome in Photo 8. The other two were from the 1875 CGR batch bought from CGR between 1895 and 1901. The 1875 batch comprised 10 locos and what has confused matters is that five of those that remained with CGR and later passed into SAR stock numbered 0415/16/20/21/23 worked for SAR in Port Elizabeth (and East London) but they were variously scrapped between 1916-1946 and have separate entries in the SAR Rolling Stock Register to the PEHB locos. The other five (CGR M17-19/22/24) were withdrawn prior to 1899 and two of these went to the OVGS and became Bloemfontein Works shunters by 1892 and at least two (possibly three) were sold to PEHB. PEHB loco “H” has never been identified, it did not pass into SAR stock and therefore is not in the Rolling Stock Register, it arrived in PE between 1895-1901 and just possibly was the fifth of M17-19/22/24.\"\n\nIf John is correct then the front engine was built in 1903 which makes it impossible for this to be a munitions train, which in turn awakens an intriguing speculation as to what its cargo might be.\n\n12. We are indebted to Trevor Jones for identifying the subject of this picture:\n\n\"She is the Lady Elizabeth, built in 1928 by Jonker & Stans at Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht in the Netherlands. She only served in PE from 1928 to 1938, so that must be the time window of the photo. She was then sold to a British dredging company and returned to the the UK. She was named after Elizabeth Markham, who later become Lady Elizabeth Donkin, wife of Sir Rufane Donkin, so a famous name in PE history, She wasn't a pilot tug, by the way, but a rather larger tug intended to work lighters to vessel performing lighterage operations in Algoa Bay. When these fell away after better alongside facilities were provided, the need for these lighterage tugs also fell away, hence her sale after only ten years.\"\n\n27. Bruce thinks this is a River Class Frigate (since confirmed as such by Ken Fletcher) entering PE Harbour some time during WWII. Ken has sent us the following interesting notes:\n\n\"She was probably on her way to/or returning from the British Far East Fleet. Strange that she has no pennant number. It would be interesting to magnify her ID flags to try to identify her. Also strange is that while most photos of the Class show the Ship’s boat hung from goose-neck davits attached to the hull, this one is on a gravity-type davit fastened to the deck. I don’t know whether this is a later version of the class or a Canadian one. In some photos of Canadians that I have seen, the davit is not attached to the hull but is mounted on the deck. She is not one of the two Rivers that were crewed by the SAN in 1945.\"\n\n39. JOHN DOCK as seen from the deck of a mailship arriving at Port Elizabeth. For our technically-minded readers, here are her details provided by Fr Andrew Scott Davidson, C.Ss.R., an acknowledged expert on SAR harbour craft.\n\nJOHN DOCK\n\nBuilders: Harland & Wolff, Ltd., Govan, Yard No. 936G\n\nCompleted: October 1934 (launched 26th July 1934)\n\nDimensions: 153'9\" (46.83m) l.o.a., 145'0\" (44.19m) l.b.p., 32'0\" (9,75m) b.mld, 16'0\" (4.88m) d.mld, 14'101/4\" (4.53m) mean draft\n\nEngines: 4 Babcock & Wilcox water tube boilers, (she and her sister were the last two tugs built with water tube boilers as opposed to Scotch fire tube boilers)\n\n2 TE engines by Harland & Wolff, Ltd., Govan,\n\n17\", 29\" & 48\" by 30\" stroke\n\n2500 iHp [designed, in service given as 3000 iHp], 12 knots\n\nCoal: 209 tons\n\nTonnage: 551 grt\n\n(Her sister, the W. H. Fuller, is the one that was sunk in Bird Island Passage on the 22nd September 1944)\n\nThe Dock worked in PE until being transferred to Durban in 1967, being replaced by the C. F. Kayser’s sister, the T. Eriksen. She was seen as being underpowered (she and her sister were fitted with smaller propellers and were felt to be more manoeuvrable than their later sisters, but not as powerful) for the larger bulk carriers coming in to the new bulk terminal. Sold as scrap 9th August 1977.\n\n40. Here is John Dock again – this time, up on the slipway for her regular maintenance service. Father Scott again:\n\n\"This would be the normal annual lay-up. As such the hull would be scraped (later years they shot blasted the hulls) to remove all the marine growth and barnacles. Everything would then be red-leaded and a new coat of red anti-fouling paint would be applied to the lower hull.\n\nAbove the wind-and-water line, they wouldn't remove all the paint, just chip the rust from the hull, red-lead and then paint the whole tug. The teak would be scraped down and several layers of marine varnish would be applied.\n\nMeanwhile, all the overboard valves would be removed, overhauled and replaced. (Always a source of anxiety for us engineers when they begin to flood a dock after a dry docking ... would the new seals hold?). The propellers would be cleaned up as well and once the underhull painting was complete, all the sacrificial anodes would be replaced with new ones.\n\nOn board all other maintenance would take place. The boilers would be scraped fire- and water-sides, pumps would be stripped and overhauled, the engines would be checked, bearings re-white-metalled and scraped, etc., etc.\n\nOnce ready, the tug would hit the water rejuvenated.\"\n\n52. After Pretoria Castle was safely berthed I had a quick breakfast in the cabin class dining saloon and then left the ship to find trains to photograph. I first walked into town and saw the statue of Queen Victoria outside the Public Library. A feeling of pride rushed over me because my maternal grandfather was directly involved in its placement. My maternal grandmother – Ouma Kruger told me the story:\n\n\"The statue arrived by ship from the UK and had to be brought up from the harbour to the chosen site. A steam traction engine was to haul the statue into town, but the municipal driver had booked off sick. The municipality contacted the office of the Cape Government Railways and asked if they could provide an engine driver to stand-in and drive the traction engine. The old Loco Depot at North End was instructed to provide a driver on loan and my Oupa Kruger happened to be available. He was sent to the harbour where he took over the steam traction engine and hauled Queen Victoria to her final resting place.\"\n\nAt the time of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 1897 a movement to raise funds for the statue was started. E. Roscoe Mullins, a renowned sculptor from London at the time, was commissioned to sculpt the statue which is made from Sicilian marble. It was erected and unveiled by the Mayor of Port Elizabeth, J.C. Kemsley on the 30th of September 1903. My thanks to Nelson Mandela Bay Tourism for the additional information.\n\n56. The small coaster Adelaar was owned and operated by the Port Elizabeth-based Cape Recife Coasting Company that had bought her from her owner-master, Captain Otto Schneider, in 1957. With his wife, two daughters and some “hitch-hikers” as crew, Schneider had brought Adelaar from South America circa 1956 with a cargo of timber. Within a few months of Cape Recife Coasting Company taking her over, she broke down off Port Elizabeth, was towed into port and her cargo trans-shipped to the Thesen coaster Griqua Coast for onward shipment to Cape Town. Soon after that incident, the company went bankrupt, and, by 1958, she was owned by Senator S. M. Pettersen whose so-called “ghost fleet” of derelict ships lay abandoned for years in Table Bay Harbour. Adelaar spent a long period laid up at No 5 Quay before being scuttled in Table Bay [Brian acquired this photo from the George Young Collection].\n\n57. When export fruit blocks arrived at Humewood Road the locomotives would immediately uncouple and head for the shed. The load - minus its guards van - would then be worked down to the docks, in early years probably by an NG8 or 9, then by the first SAR Garratt, No 51 (after its arrival from Natal in 1946), or in later years, Nos 54 or 55, the later model NGG11s that were allocated to hauler duties after they were transferred from the Estcourt - Weenen line in 1965. In this magnificent panorama by David Mitchell of the Talyllyn Railway, an NGG11 is bringing one of these block loads to the underground pre-cooling sheds used for stacking fruit before loading into reefer vessels for shipping overseas. The engine itself was shy of going underground. It would park the wagons in the fan of tracks just ahead of the train, run around and then shove them into the shed in cuts of six or seven. Broad-gauge fruit used the same precoolers - the interlacing of the gauges was just ahead and to the left of the parachute tank in the middle background.\n\nThe clerestoried roof in the foreground belonged to the old Customs Shed, which in this 1973 photo was still very much in use.\n\n64. Referring to the date of his photograph – January 1983, Peter Rogers writes:\n\n\"How have the mighty fallen - six months ago 15AR 2024 would have been employed on the P.E. - Uitenhage locals. Now, with passenger duties gone, \"Uitenhage\" has been relegated to the harbour shunt. Of interest is the large rake of coaches (both clerestories and ellipticals) store in the harbour yard in the far background. One assumes most of these were doomed for scrapping. Another interesting item is the 4 wheeler still in use, although long lines of these were already being lined for disposal up in yards throughout the country. Don't know what the Health & Safety officers of today would make of the shunter riding on the end of the wagon...\"\n\n87. 30 Oct 1977, Winchester Castle and Good Hope Castle, I suspect in dock for the Valencia orange crop. The days of break-bulk cargo ships and wharf-side cranes was rapidly drawing to a close: the future lay in containers and ugly container vessels. This from Trevor Jones:\n\n\"a very interesting image, as it shows Good Hope Castle in her brief interlude of U-C service as a conventional reefer, after the cessation of the mailship service in September 1977. This subsequent use of the two fast cargo mailships was not a great success, and both were soon sold to Costa of Italy. That's also why the Good Hope Castle is not in the conventional mailship berth at No 2 Quay.\"\n\n97. Achille Lauro 14 Dec 1980, with diesel tugs in attendance -the steam tug era having come to an end.\n\nLaunched as the MS Willem Ruys in 1947 she had an eventful life that ended in tragedy. In 1965 she was converted into a 23,000 ton cruiseliner and renamed by her new owners, the Flotta Lauro line. In 1985 she was hijacked by four members of the Palestine Liberation Front, who murdered a Jewish-American passenger named Klinghoffer. After capture of the terrorists (who later escaped from Italian custody) she continued her career, eventually sinking off the coast of Somalia after an engine room fire in December 1994. Two passengers and a crew member lost their lives (thanks to Wikipedia for this information).\n\n105. A 2005 scene of the tug berths in PE Harbour. The SHIRAZ is nearest the camera. Father Scott provides her background:\n\nShe was originally the Ben Schoeman and was first of a class of four large Voith tractor tugs built by Dorbyl in 1980. She is 43 tons registered bollard pull. She started life in Durban alongside the last of the four, the Paul Sauer (now Pinotage). Then Cape Town claimed all of that class and the J. H. Botha and R. H. Tarpey were sent to Rickie's Vlei to join the W. H. Marshall Clarke and the Jan Haywood when the latter was brought down from Walvis. Later all the Schottels were consolidated in Durban so instead of providing a variety of tug sizes and powers in each port, the standardisation of spare parts idea was followed.\n\nThe next tug, further away from the camera is the Japanese-built Z-peller ASD (azimuth stern drive) tug, Brenton which was built as the P. J. C. du Plessis. She is 2700 bHp and 27 ton bollard pull.\n\nThe furthest tug is really hard to tell. I think I can make out '?ko' at the end of her name. That would then be the Ngqura (Coega) tug Lizibuko, built 2010 and 70 tonne bollard pull. Coega tugs sometimes help out in PE when extra power is needed.\n\nThanks Father Scott!\n\n109. The Port Elizabeth harbour tugs Shiraz (nearest the camera) and Imonti standing by to assist the container ship Safmarine Oranje to sea in September 2009. Shiraz (ex-Ben Schoeman) was built in Durban in 1980 as one of a flotilla of second generation multi-directional tugs for service in South African harbours. She was initially in service in Durban harbour and then in Cape Town before being transferred to Port Elizabeth. A series of nine new Durban-built tugs have entered service in the last two years as the fourth generation of these tugs. The Diesel Z-peller tug Imonti was one of three sister ships built in Japan in 1977 to replace the old steam harbour tugs that had been built in the 1930s. Imonti has since been withdrawn from service.\n\nThe informative captions for photos 97 to 100 were provided by Brian Ingpen (as well as the photos!).\n\nThat's all for this issue of \"Soul of A Railway\". Our next chapter covers the suburban and local freight services in and around Port Elizabeth."
