CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. รยง 119(e) to application Serial No. 5 60/399,673 filed July 29, 2002; Serial No. 60/443,949 filed January 31, 2003 and Serial No. 60/452,339 filed March 6, 2003. 2. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, intermediates and synthetic 10 methods of making the compounds and methods of using the compounds and compositions in a variety of contexts, such as in the treatment or prevention of autoimmune diseases and/or the symptoms associated therewith. 3. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Crosslinking of Fc receptors, such as the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcERI) 15 and/or the high affinity receptor for IgG (Fc-yRI) activates a signaling cascade in mast, basophil and other immune cells that results in the release of chemical mediators responsible for numerous adverse events. For example, such crosslinking leads to the release of preformed mediators of Type I (immediate) anaphylactic hypersensitivity reactions, such as histamine, from storage sites in granules via degranulation. It also leads 20 to the synthesis and release of other mediators, including leukotrienes, prostaglandins and platelet-activating factors (PAFs), that play important roles in inflammatory reactions. Additional mediators that are synthesized and released upon crosslinking Fc receptors include cytokines and nitric oxide. The signaling cascade(s) activated by crosslinking Fc receptors such as FceRI and/or 25 FcyRI comprises an array of cellular proteins. Among the most important intracellular signal propagators are the tyrosine kinases. And, an important tyrosine kinase involved in the signal transduction pathways associated with crosslinking the FcERI and/or FcyRI receptors, as well as other signal transduction cascades, is Syk kinase (see Valent et al., 2002, Intl. J. Hematol. 75(4):257-362 for review). 1 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 As the mediators released as a result of FceRI and FcyRI receptor cross-linking are responsible for, or play important roles in, the manifestation of numerous adverse events, the availability of compounds capable of inhibiting the signaling cascade(s) responsible for their release would be highly desireable. Moreover, owing to the critical role that Syk 5 kinase plays these and other receptor signaling cascade(s), the availability of compounds capable of inhibiting Syk kinase would also be highly desirable. 4. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the present invention provides novel 2 ,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds that, as will be discussed in more detail below, have myriad biological 10 activities. The compounds generally comprise a 2\n\n,\n\n4 -pyrimidinediamine \"core\" having the following structure and numbering convention: 6\n\nS\n\n1\n\nH\n\n2 N N\n\nNH\n\n2 3 The compounds of the invention are substituted at the C2 nitrogen (N2) to form a secondary amine and are optionally further substituted at one or more of the following 15 positions: the C4 nitrogen (N4), the C5 position and/or the C6 position. When substituted at N4, the substituent forms a secondary amine. The substituent at N2, as well as the optional substituents at the other positions, may range broadly in character and physico chemical properties. For example, the substituent(s) may be a branched, straight-chained or cyclic alkyl, a branched, straight-chained or cyclic heteroalkyl, a mono- or polycyclic aryl a 20 mono- or polycyclic heteroaryl or combinations of these groups. These substituent groups may be further substituted, as will be described in more detail below. The N2 and/or N4 substituents may be attached directly to their respective nitrogen atoms, or they may be spaced away from their respective nitrogen atoms via linkers, which may be the same or different. The nature of the linkers can vary widely, and can include 25 virtually any combination of atoms or groups useful for spacing one molecular moiety from another. For example, the linker may be an acyclic hydrocarbon bridge (e.g, a saturated or unsaturated alkyleno such as methano, ethano, etheno, propano, prop[l]eno, butano, but[l]eno, but[2]eno, buta[1,3]dieno, and the like), a monocyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon bridge (e.g., [1,2]benzeno,\n\n[\n\n2 ,3]naphthaleno, and the like), a simple acyclic heteroatomic or 2 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 heteroalkyldiyl bridge (e.g., -0-, -S-, -S-O-, -NH-, -PH-, -C(O)-, -C(O)NH-, -S(O)-, -S(O) 2 -, -S(O)NH-, -S(0) 2 NH-, -0-CH 2 -, -CH 2 -0-CH 2 -, -0-CH=CH-CH 2 -, and the like), a monocyclic or polycyclic heteroaryl bridge (e.g., [3,4]furano, pyridino, thiopheno, piperidino, piperazino, pyrazidino, pyrrolidino, and the like) or combinations of such 5 bridges. The substituents at the N2, N4, C5 and/or C6 positions, as well as the optional linkers, may be further substituted with one or more of the same or different substituent groups. The nature of these substituent groups may vary broadly. Non-limiting examples of suitable substituent groups include branched, straight-chain or cyclic alkyls, mono- or 10 polycyclic aryls, branched, straight-chain or cyclic heteroalkyls, mono- or polycyclic heteroaryls, halos, branched, straight-chain or cyclic haloalkyls, hydroxyls, oxos, thioxos, branched, straight-chain or cyclic alkoxys, branched, straight-chain or cyclic haloalkoxys, trifluoromethoxys, mono- or polycyclic aryloxys, mono- or polycyclic heteroaryloxys, ethers, alcohols, sulfides, thioethers, sulfanyls (thiols), imines, azos, azides, amines 15 (primary, secondary and tertiary), nitriles (any isomer), cyanates (any isomer), thiocyanates (any isomer), nitrosos, nitros, diazos, sulfoxides, sulfonyls, sulfonic acids, sulfamides, sulfonamides, sulfamic esters, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, amidines, formadines, amino acids, acetylenes, carbamates, lactones, lactams, glucosides, gluconurides, sulfones, ketals, acetals, thioketals, oximes, oxamic acids, oxamic esters, etc., 20 and combinations of these groups. Substituent groups bearing reactive functionalities may be protected or unprotected, as is well-known in the art.

Such prodrugs may be active in their prodrug form, or may be inactive until converted under physiological or other conditions of use to an active drug form. In the prodrugs of the invention, one or more functional groups of the 2,4 5 pyrimidinediamine compounds are included in promoieties that cleave from the molecule under the conditions of use, typically by way of hydrolysis, enzymatic cleavage or some other cleavage mechanism, to yield the functional groups. For example, primary or secondary amino groups may be included in an amide promoiety that cleaves under conditions of use to generate the primary or secondary amino group. Thus, the prodrugs of 10 the invention include special types of protecting groups, termed \"progroups,\" masking one or more functional groups of the 2\n\n,\n\n4 -pyrimidinediamine compounds that cleave under the conditions of use to yield an active 2 ,4-pyrimidinediamine drug compound. Functional groups within the 2\n\n,\n\n4 -pyrimidinediamine compounds that may be masked with progroups for inclusion in a promoiety include, but are not limited to, amines (primary and secondary), 15 hydroxyls, sulfanyls (thiols), carboxyls, carbonyls, phenols, catechols, diols, alkynes, phosphates, etc. Myriad progroups suitable for masking such functional groups to yield promoieties that are cleavable under the desired conditions of use are known in the art. All of these progroups, alone or in combinations, may be included in the prodrugs of the invention. Specific examples of promoieties that yield primary or secondary amine groups 20 that can be included in the prodrugs of the invention include, but are not limited to amides, carbamates, imines, ureas, phosphenyls, phosphoryls and sulfenyls. Specific examples of promoieties that yield sulfanyl groups that can be included in the prodrugs of the invention include, but are not limited to, thioethers, for example S-methyl derivatives (monothio, dithio, oxythio, aminothio acetals), silyl thioethers, thioesters, thiocarbonates, 25 thiocarbamates, asymmetrical disulfides, etc. Specific examples of promoieties that cleave to yield hydroxyl groups that can be included in the prodrugs of the invention include, but are not limited to, sulfonates, esters and carbonates. Specific examples of promoieties that yield carboxyl groups that can be included in the prodrugs of the invention included, but are not limited to, esters (including silyl esters, oxamic acid esters and thioesters), amides and 30 hydrazides. In one illustrative embodiment, the prodrugs of the invention are compounds according to structural formula (I) in which the protecting group of Rc and Rd is a progroup. 6 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 Replacing the hydrogens attached to N2 and N4 in the 2,4-pyrimidinediamines of structural formula (I) with substituents adversely affects the activity of the compounds. However, as will be appreciated by skilled artisans, these nitrogens may be included in promoieties that, under conditions of use, cleave to yield 2,4-pyrimidinediamines according 5 to structural formula (I). Thus, in another illustrative embodiment, the prodrugs of the invention are compounds according to structural formula (II): R6\n\nR\n\n5 'NN L2 L\n\nR\n\n4 ' NN N N' 'R 2\n\nR\n\n4 b R 2 b including salts, hydrates, solvates and N-oxides thereof, wherein:\n\nR\n\n2 , R4, R, R6, L' and L 2 are as previously defined for structural formula (I); and 10 R 2 b and R 4 are each, independently of one another, a progroup. In another aspect, the present invention provides compositions comprising one or more compounds and/or prodrugs of the invention and an appropriate carrier, excipient or diluent. The exact nature of the carrier, excipient or diluent will depend upon the desired use for the composition, and may range from being suitable or acceptable for veterinary 15 uses to being suitable or acceptable for human use. In still another aspect, the present invention provides intermediates useful for synthesizing the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds and prodrugs of the invention. In one embodiment, the intermediates are 4-pyrimidineamines according to structural formula (III):\n\nR\n\n6\n\nR\n\n5 2N R 'L\n\nR\n\n4 'N N LG\n\nR\n\n4 C 20 including salts, hydrates, solvates and N-oxides thereof, wherein R 4 , R, R 6 and L 2 are as previously defined for structural formula (I); LG is a leaving group such as, for example, -S(O) 2 Me, -SMe or halo (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I); and R 4 \" is hydrogen or a progroup. In another embodiment, the intermediates are 2-pyrimidineamines according to structural formula (IV): 7 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087\n\nR\n\n6 R5 N L1 LG N N R 2\n\nR\n\n2 e including salts, hydrates, solvates and N-oxides thereof, wherein R 2 , R , R 6 and L' are as previously defined for structural formula (I); LG is a leaving group, such as, for 5 example, -S(O) 2 Me, -SMe or halo (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I) and R 2 c is hydrogen or a progroup. In yet another embodiment, the intermediates are 4-amino- or 4-hydroxy-2 pyrimidineamines according to structural formula (V): R6 R 5 N -~N R 7 L\n\nR\n\n7 N N R 2\n\nR\n\n2 c 10 including salts, hydrates, solvates and N-oxides thereof, wherein R2, R 5 , R 6 and L' are as previously defined for structural formula (I), R7 is an amino or hydroxyl group and\n\nR\n\n2 c is hydrogen or a progroup. In another embodiment, the intermediates are N4-substituted cytosines according to structural formula (VI): R6\n\nR\n\n5 4L2\n\nR\n\n4 N N O 15 4c 15\n\nR\n\n4 including salts, hydrates, solvates and N-oxides thereof, wherein R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and L 2 are as previously defined for structural formula (I) and R 4 is hydrogen or a progroup. In yet another aspect, the present invention provides methods of synthesizing the 20 2\n\n,\n\n4 -pyrimidinediamine compounds and prodrugs of the invention. In one embodiment, the method involves reacting a 4 -pyrimidineamine according to structural formula (III) with an amine of the formula HR 2 cN-LI-R 2 , where L', R2 and R 2 are as previously defined for 8 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 structural formula (IV) to yield a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine according to structural formula (I) or a prodrug according to structural formula (II). In another embodiment, the method involves reacting a 2 -pyrimidineamine according to structural formula (IV) with an amine of the formula R 4\n\n-L\n\n2\n\n-NHR\n\n4 c where L 4 , 5 R4 and R4\"are as previously defined for structural formula (III) to yield a 2,4 pyrimidinediamine according to structural formula (I) or a prodrug according to structural formula (H). In yet another embodiment, the method involves reacting a 4-amino-2 pyrimidineamine according to structural formula (V) (in which R 7 is an amino group) with 10 an amine of the formula R 4\n\n-L\n\n2\n\n-NHR\n\n4 c, where L 2 , R 4 and R 4 c are as defined for structural formula (III), to yield a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine according to structural formula (I) or a prodrug according to structural formula (II). Alternatively, the 4 -amino-2-pyrimidineamine may be reacted with a compound of the formula R 4\n\n-L\n\n2 -LG, where R 4 and L 2 are as previously defined for structural formula (I) and LG is a leaving group. 15 In still another embodiment, the method involves halogenating a 4-hydroxy-2 pyrimidineamine according to structural formula (V) (R 7 is a hydroxyl group) to yield a 2 pyrimidineamine according to structural formula (IV) and reacting this pyrimidineamine with an appropriate amine, as described above. In yet another embodiment, the method involves halogenating an N4-substituted 20 cytosine according to structural formula (VI) to yield a 4-pyrimidineamine according to structural formula (III) and reacting this pyrimidineamine with an appropriate amine, as described above. The 2 ,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds of the invention are potent inhibitors of degranulation of immune cells, such as mast, basophil, neutrophil and/or eosinophil cells. 25 Thus, in still another aspect, the present invention provides methods of regulating, and in particular inhibiting, degranulation of such cells. The method generally involves contacting a cell that degranulates with an amount of a 2 ,4-pyrimidinediamine compound or prodrug of the invention, or an acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, N-oxide and/or composition thereof, effective to regulate or inhibit degranulation of the cell. The method may be practiced in in 30 vitro contexts or in in vivo contexts as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment or prevention of diseases characterized by, caused by or associated with cellular degranulation. While not intending to be bound by any theory of operation, biochemical data confirm that the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds exert their degranulation inhibitory 9 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 effect, at least in part, by blocking or inhibiting the signal transduction cascade(s) initiated by crosslinking of the high affinity Fc receptors for IgE (\"FcERI\") and/or IgG (\"Fc-yRI\"). Indeed, the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds are potent inhibitors of both FcERI-mediated and FcyRI-mediated degranulation. As a consequence, the 2,4-pyrimidine compounds may 5 be used to inhibit these Fc receptor signalling cascades in any cell type expressing such FceRI and/or FcyRI receptors including but not limited to macrophages, mast, basophil, neutrophil and/or eosinophil cells. The methods also permit the regulation of, and in particular the inhibition of, downstream processes that result as a consequence of activating such FEc receptor signaling 10 cascade(s). Such downstream processes include, but are not limited to, FcERI-mediated and/or FcyRI-mediated degranulation, cytokine production and/or the production and/or release of lipid mediators such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins. The method generally involves contacting a cell expressing an Fc receptor, such as one of the cell types discussed above, with an amount of a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound or prodrug of the invention, 15 or an acceptable salt, hydrate, solvent, N-oxide and/or composition thereof, effective to regulate or inhibit the Fc receptor signaling cascade and/or a downstream process effected by the activation of this signaling cascade. The method may be practiced in in vitro contexts or in in vivo contexts as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment or prevention of diseases characterized by, caused by or associated with the Fc receptor signaling cascade, 20 such as diseases effected by the release of granule specific chemical mediators upon degranulation, the release and/or synthesis of cytokines and/or the release and/or synthesis of lipid mediators such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins. In yet another aspect, the present invention provides methods of treating and/or preventing diseases characterized by, caused by or associated with the release of chemical 25 mediators as a consequence of activating Fc receptor signaling cascades, such as FceRI and/or FcyRI- signaling cascades. The methods may be practiced in animals in veterinary contexts or in humans. The methods generally involve administering to an animal subject or human an amount of a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound or prodrug of the invention, or an acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, N-oxide and/or composition thereof, effective to treat or 30 prevent the disease. As discussed previously, activation of the FcERI or FcyRI receptor signaling cascade in certain immune cells leads to the release and/or synthesis of a variety of chemical substances that are pharmacological mediators of a wide variety of diseases. 10 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 Any of these diseases may be treated or prevented according to the methods of the invention. For example, in mast cells and basophil cells, activation of the FceRI or FcyRI signaling cascade leads to the immediate (i.e., within 1-3 min. of receptor activation) release 5 of preformed mediators of atopic and/or Type I hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., histamine, proteases such as tryptase, etc.) via the degranulation process. Such atopic or Type I hypersensitivity reactions include, but are not limited to, anaphylactic reactions to environmental and other allergens (e.g., pollens, insect and/or animal venoms, foods, drugs, contrast dyes, etc.), anaphylactoid reactions, hay fever, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic 10 rhinitis, allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, eczema, urticaria, mucosal disorders, tissue disorders and certain gastrointestinal disorders. The immediate release of the preformed mediators via degranulation is followed by the release and/or synthesis of a variety of other chemical mediators, including, among other things, platelet activating factor (PAF), prostaglandins and leukotrienes (e.g., LTC4) and the 15 de novo synthesis and release of cytokines such as TNFa, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, etc. The first of these two processes occurs approximately 3-30 min. following receptor activation; the latter approximately 30 min. - 7 hrs. following receptor activation. These \"late stage\" mediators are thought to be in part responsible for the chronic symptoms of the above-listed atopic and Type I hypersensitivity reactions, and in addition are chemical mediators of 20 inflammation and inflammatory diseases (e.g., osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colon, etc.), low grade scarring (e.g., scleroderma, increased fibrosis, keloids, post-surgical scars, pulmonary fibrosis, vascular spasms, migraine, reperfusion injury and post myocardial infarction), and sicca complex or syndrome. All of these 25 diseases may be treated or prevented according to the methods of the invention. Additional diseases which can be treated or prevented according to the methods of the invention include diseases associated with basophil cell and/or mast cell pathology. Examples of such diseases include, but are not limited to, diseases of the skin such as scleroderma, cardiac diseases such as post myocardial infarction, pulmonary diseases such 30 as pulmonary muscle changes or remodeling and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diseases of the gut such as inflammatory bowel syndrome (spastic colon). The 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds of the invention are also potent inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase Syk kinase. Thus, in still another aspect, the present invention provides 11 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 methods of regulating, and in particular inhibiting, Syk kinase activity. The method generally involves contacting a Syk kinase or a cell comprising a Syk kinase with an amount of a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound or prodrug of the invention, or an acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, N-oxide and/or composition thereof, effective to regulate or inhibit 5 Syk kinase activity. In one embodiment, the Syk kinase is an isolated or recombinant Syk kinase. In another embodiment, the Syk kinase is an endogenous or recombinant Syk kinase expressed by a cell, for example a mast cell or a basophil cell. The method may be practiced in in vitro contexts or in in vivo contexts as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment or prevention of diseases characterized by, caused by or associated with Syk 10 kinase activity. While not intending to be bound by any particular theory of operation, it is believed that the 2 ,4-pyrimdinediamine compounds of the invention inhibit cellular degranulation and/or the release of other chemical mediators primarily by inhibiting Syk kinase that gets activated through the gamma chain homodimer of FcERI (see, e.g., FIG. 2). This gamma 15 chain homodimer is shared by other Fc receptors, including FcyRI, FcyRIII and FcoRI. For all of these receptors, intracellular signal transduction is mediated by the common gamma chain homodimer. Binding and aggregation of those receptors results in the recruitment and activation of tyrosine kinases such as Syk kinase. As a consequence of these common signaling activities, the 2\n\n,\n\n4 -pyrimidinediamine compounds described herein may be used to 20 regulate, and in particular inhibit, the signaling cascades of Fc receptors having this gamma chain homodimer, such as FcERI, FcyRI, FcyRIII and FcoRI, as well as the cellular responses elicited through these receptors. Syk kinase is known to play a critical role in other signaling cascades. For example, Syk kinase is an effector of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling (Turner et al., 2000, 25 Immunology Today 21:148-154) and is an essential component of integrin beta(l), beta(2) and beta(3) signaling in neutrophils (Mocsai et al., 2002, Immunity 16:547-558). As the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds described herein are potent inhibitors of Syk kinase, they can be used to regulate, and in particular inhibit, any signaling cascade where Syk plays a role, such as, fore example, the Fc receptor, BCR and integrin signaling cascades, as 30 well as the cellular responses elicited through these signaling cascades. The particular cellular response regulated or inhibited will depend, in part, on the specific cell type and receptor signaling cascade, as is well known in the art. Non-limiting examples of cellular responses that may be regulated or inhibited with the 2\n\n,\n\n4 -pyrimidinediamine compounds 12 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 include a respiratory burst, cellular adhesion, cellular degranulation, cell spreading, cell migration, phagocytosis (e.g., in macrophages), calcium ion flux (e.g., in mast, basophil, neutrophil, eosinophil and B-cells), platelet aggregation, and cell maturation (e.g., in B cells). 5 Thus, in another aspect, the present invention provides methods of regulating, and in particular inhibiting, signal transduction cascades in which Syk plays a role. The method generally involves contacting a Syk-dependent receptor or a cell expressing a Syk dependent receptor with an amount of a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound or prodrug of the invention, or an acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, N-oxide and/or composition thereof, 10 effective to regulate or inhibit the signal transduction cascade. The methods may also be used to regulate, and in particular inhibit, downstream processes or cellular responses elicited by activation of the particular Syk-dependent signal transduction cascade. The methods may be practiced to regulate any signal transduction cascade where Syk is not known or later discovered to play a role. The methods may be practiced in in vitro contexts 15 or in in vivo contexts as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment or prevention of diseases characterized by, caused by or associated with activation of the Syk-dependent signal transduction cascade. Non-limited examples of such diseases include those previously discussed. Cellular and animal data also confirm that the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds of 20 the invention may also be used to treat or prevent autoimmune diseases and/or symptoms of such diseases. The methods generally involve administering to a subject suffering from an autoimmune disease or at risk of developing an autoimmune disease an amount of a 2,4 pyrimidinediamine method or prodrug of the invention, or an acceptable salt, N-oxide, hydrate, solvate or composition thereof, effective to treat or prevent the autoimmune disease 25 and/or its associated symptoms. Autoimmune diseases that can be treated or prevented with the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds include those diseases that are commonly associated with nonanaphylactic hypersensitivity reactions (Type II, Type III and/or Type IV hypersensitivity reactions) and/or those diseases that are mediated, at least in part, by activation of the FcyR signaling cascade in monocyte cells. Such autoinmune disease 30 include, but are not limited to, those autoimmune diseases that are frequently designated as single organ or single cell-type autoimmune disorders and those autoimmune disease that are frequently designated as involving systemic autoimmune disorder. Non-limiting examples of diseases frequently designated as single organ or single cell-type autoimmune 13 disorders include: Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune atrophic gastritis of pernicious anemia, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, autoimmune orchitis, Goodpasture's disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, sympathetic ophthalmia, myasthenia gravis, Graves' disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic aggressive hepatitis, ulcerative colitis and membranous glomerulopathy. Non-limiting examples of diseases often designated as involving systemic autoimmune disorder include: systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, Reiter's syndrome, polymyositis dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, polyarteritis nodosa, multiple sclerosis and bullous pemphigoid.

In preferred embodiments, the heteroaryl group is a 5-14 membered heteroaryl, with 5-10 15 membered heteroaryl being particularly preferred. \"Heteroaryl-Heteroaryl\" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to a monovalent heteroaromatic group derived by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single atom of a ring system in which two or more identical or non-identical parent heteroaromatic ring systems are joined directly together by a single bond, where the number 20 of such direct ring junctions is one less than the number of parent heteroaromatic ring systems involved. Typical heteroaryl-heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, bipyridyl, tripyridyl, pyridylpurinyl, bipurinyl, etc. Where the number of atoms are specified, the numbers refer to the number of atoms comprising each parent heteroaromatic ring systems. For example, 5-15 membered heteroaryl-heteroaryl is a heteroaryl-heteroaryl 25 group in which each parent heteroaromatic ring system comprises from 5 to 15 atoms, e.g., bipyridyl, tripuridyl, etc. Preferably, each parent heteroaromatic ring system is independently a 5-15 membered heteroaromatic, more preferably a 5-10 membered heteroaromatic. Also preferred are heteroaryl-heteroaryl groups in which all of the parent heteroaromatic ring systems are identical. 30 \"Biheteroaryl\" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to a heteroaryl-heteroaryl group having two identical parent heteroaromatic ring systems joined directly together by a single bond. Typical biheteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, bipyridyl, bipurinyl, biquinolinyl, and the like. Preferably, the heteroaromatic ring 21 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 systems are 5-15 membered heteroaromatic rings, more preferably 5-10 membered heteroaromatic rings. \"Heteroarylalkyl\" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to an acyclic alkyl group in which one of the hydrogen atoms bonded to a carbon atom, typically a terminal or 5 sp carbon atom, is replaced with a heteroaryl group. Where specific alkyl moieties are intended, the nomenclature heteroarylalkanyl, heteroarylakenyl and/or heteroarylalkynyl is used. In preferred embodiments, the heteroarylalkyl group is a 6-21 membered heteroarylalkyl, e.g., the alkanyl, alkenyl or alkynyl moiety of the heteroarylalkyl is (Cl-C6) alkyl and the heteroaryl moiety is a 5-15-membered heteroaryl. In particularly 10 preferred embodiments, the heteroarylalkyl is a 6-13 membered heteroarylalkyl, e.g., the alkanyl, alkenyl or alkynyl moiety is (Cl-C3) alkyl and the heteroaryl moiety is a 5-10 membered heteroaryl. \"Halogen\" or \"Halo\" by themselves or as part of another substituent, unless otherwise stated, refer to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. 15 \"Haloalkyl\" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to an alkyl group in which one or more of the hydrogen atoms is replaced with a halogen. Thus, the term \"haloalkyl\" is meant to include monohaloalkyls, dihaloalkyls, trihaloalkyls, etc. up to perhaloalkyls. For example, the expression \"(Cl-C2) haloalkyl\" includes fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, 1 -fluoroethyl, 1,1 -difluoroethyl, 1,2-difluoroethyl, 20 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl, perfluoroethyl, etc. The above-defined groups may include prefixes and/or suffixes that are commonly used in the art to create additional well-recognized substituent groups. As examples, \"alkyloxy\" or \"alkoxy\" refers to a group of the formula -OR\", \"alkylamine\" refers to a group of the formula -NHR\" and \"dialkylamine\" refers to a group of the formula -NR\"R\", 25 where each R\" is independently an alkyl. As another example, \"haloalkoxy\" or \"haloalkyloxy\" refers to a group of the formula -OR\"', where R' is a haloalkyl. \"Protecting group\" refers to a group of atoms that, when attached to a reactive functional group in a molecule, mask, reduce or prevent the reactivity of the functional group. Typically, a protecting group may be selectively removed as desired during the 30 course of a synthesis. Examples of protecting groups can be found in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, 3 rd Ed., 1999, John Wiley & Sons, NY and Harrison et al., Compendium ofSynthetic Organic Methods, Vols. 1-8, 1971-1996, John Wiley & Sons, NY. Representative amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, 22 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (\"CBZ\"), tert-butoxycarbonyl (\"Boc\"), trimethylsilyl (\"TMS\"), 2-trimethylsilyl-ethanesulfonyl (\"TES\"), trityl and substituted trityl groups, allyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (\"FMOC\"), nitro veratryloxycarbonyl (\"NVOC\") and the like. Representative hydroxyl protecting groups 5 include, but are not limited to, those where the hydroxyl group is either acylated or alkylated such as benzyl and trityl ethers, as well as alkyl ethers, tetrahydropyranyl ethers, trialkylsilyl ethers (e.g., TMS or TIPPS groups) and allyl ethers. \"Prodrug\" refers to a derivative of an active 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compound (drug) that requires a transformation under the conditions of use, such as within the body, to 10 release the active 2,4-pyrimidinediamine drug. Prodrugs are frequently, but not necessarily, pharmacologically inactive until converted into the active drug. Prodrugs are typically obtained by masking a functional group in the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine drug believed to be in part required for activity with a progroup (defined below) to form a promoiety which undergoes a transformation, such as cleavage, under the specified conditions of use to 15 release the functional group, and hence the active 2,4-pyrimidinediamine drug. The cleavage of the promoiety may proceed spontaneously, such as by way of a hydrolysis reaction, or it may be catalyzed or induced by another agent, such as by an enzyme, by light, by acid or base, or by a change of or exposure to a physical or environmental parameter, such as a change of temperature. The agent may be endogenous to the conditions of use, 20 such as an enzyme present in the cells to which the prodrug is administered or the acidic conditions of the stomach, or it may be supplied exogenously. A wide variety of progroups, as well as the resultant promoieties, suitable for masking functional groups in the active 2,4-pyrimidinediamines compounds to yield prodrugs are well-known in the art. For example, a hydroxyl functional group may be 25 masked as a sulfonate, ester or carbonate promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the hydroxyl group. An amino functional group may be masked as an amide, carbamate, imine, urea, phosphenyl, phosphoryl or sulfenyl promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the amino group. A carboxyl group may be masked as an ester (including silyl esters and thioesters), amide or hydrazide promoiety, which may be 30 hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the carboxyl group. Other specific examples of suitable progroups and their respective promoieties will be apparent to those of skill in the art. \"Progroup\" refers to a type of protecting group that, when used to mask a functional group within an active 2,4-pyrimidinediamine drug to form a promoiety, converts the drug 23 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 into a prodrug. Progroups are typically attached to the functional group of the drug via bonds that are cleavable under specified conditions of use. Thus, a progroup is that portion of a promoiety that cleaves to release the functional group under the specified conditions of use. As a specific example, an amide promoiety of the formula -NH-C(O)CH 3 comprises 5 the progroup -C(O)CH 3 . \"Fc Receptor\" refers to a member of the family of cell surface molecules that binds the Fc portion (containing the specific constant region) of an immunoglobulin. Each Fc receptor binds immunoglobulins of a specific type. For example the Fca receptor (\"FcaR\") binds IgA, the FcER binds IgE and the FcyR binds IgG. 10 The FcaR family includes the polymeric Ig receptor involved in epithelial transport of IgA/IgM, the mycloid specific receptor RcaRI (also called CD89), the Fca/pR and at least two alternative IgA receptors (for a recent review see Monteiro & van de Winkel, 2003, Annu. Rev. Immunol, advanced e-publication. The FcaRI is expressed on neutrophils, eosinophils, moncytes/macrophages, dendritic cells and kupfer cells. The 15 FcaRI inclues one alpha chain and the FcR gamma homodimer that bears an activation motif (ITAM) in the cytoplasmic domain and phosphorylates Syk kinase. The FceR family includes two types, designated FceRI and FceRII (also known as CD23). FcRI is a high affinity receptor (binds IgE with an affinity of about 10\"M-) found on mast, basophil and eosinophil cells that anchors monomeric IgE to the cell surface. The 20 FceRI possesses one alpha chain, one beta chain and the gamma chain homodimer discussed above. The FceRII is a low affinity receptor expressed on mononuclear phagocytes, B lymphocytes, eosinophils and platelets. The FcERII comprises a single polypeptide chain and does not include the gamma chain homodimer. The FcyR family includes three types, designated FcyRI (also known as CD64), 25 FcyRII (also known as CD32) and FcyRIII (also known as CD16). FcyRI is a high affinity receptor (binds IgG1 with an affinity of 10 8\n\nM\n\n1 ) found on mast, basophil, mononuclear, neutrophil, eosinophil, deudritic and phagocyte cells that anchors nomomeric IgG to the cell surface. The FcyRI includes one alpha chain and the gamma chain dimer shared by FcaRI and FcERI. 30 The FcyRII is a low affinity receptor expressed on neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, platelets and B lymphocytes. The FcyRII includes one alpha chain, and does not include the gamma chain homodimer discussed above. 24 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 The FeyRIII is a low affmity (bindes IgG1 with an affinity of 5x1 0 5\n\nM\n\n1 ) expressed on NK, eosinophil, macrophage, neutrophil and mast cells. It comprises one alpha chain and the gamma homodimer shared by FcoRI, FOeRI and FcyRI. Skilled artisans will recognize that the subunit structure and binding properties of 5 these various Fc receptors, cell types expressing them, are not completely characterized. The above discussion merely reflects the current state-of-the-art regarding these receptors (see, e.g., Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health & Disease, 5 Edition, Janeway et al., Eds, 2001, ISBN 0-8153-3642-x, Figure 9.30 at pp. 371), and is not intended to be limiting with respect to the myriad receptor signaling cascades that can be regulated with 10 the compounds described herein. \"Fc Receptor-Mediated Degranulation\" or \"Fc Receptor-Induced Degranulation\" refers to degranulation that proceeds via an Fc receptor signal transduction cascade initiated by crosslinking of an Fc receptor. \"IRE-Induced Degranulation\" or \"FcERI-Mediated Degranulation\" refers to 15 degranulation that proceeds via the IgE receptor signal transduction cascade initiated by crosslinking of FcsRl -bound IgE. The crosslinking may be induced by an IgE-specific allergen or other multivalent binding agent, such as an anti-IgE antibody. Referring to FIG. 2, in mast and/or basophil cells, the FceRI signaling cascade leading to degranulation may be broken into two stages: upstream and downstream. The upstream stage includes all 20 of the processes that occur prior to calcium ion mobilization (illustrated as \"Ca 2 \" in FIG. 2; see also FIG. 3). The downstream stage includes calcium ion mobilization and all processes downstream thereof. Compounds that inhibit FcERI-mediated degranulation may act at any point along the FceRI-mediated signal transduction cascade. Compounds that selectively inhibit upstream FcERI-mediated degranulation act to inhibit that portion of the FceRI 25 signaling cascade upstream of the point at which calcium ion mobilization is induced. In cell-based assays, compounds that selectively inhibit upstream FecRI-mediated degranulation inhibit degranulation of cells such as mast or basophil cells that are activated or stimulated with an IgE-specific allergen or binding agent (such as an anti-IgE antibody) but do not appreciably inhibit degranulation of cells that are activated or stimulated with 30 degranulating agents that bypass the FceRI signaling pathway, such as, for example the calcium ionophores ionomycin and A23187. \"IgG-Induced Degranulation\" or \"FcyRI-Mediated Degranulation\" refers to degranulation that proceeds via the FcyRI signal transduction cascade initiated by 25 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 crosslinking of FcyRI-bound IgG. The crosslinking may be induced by an IgG-specific allergen or another multivalent binding agent, such as an anti-IgG or fragment antibody. Like the FcERI signaling cascade, in mast and basophil cells the FcyRI signaling cascade also leads to degranulation which may be broken into the same two stages: upstream and 5 downstream. Similar to FecRI-mediated degranulation, compounds that selectively inhibit upstream FcyRI-mediated degranulation act upstream of the point at which calcium ion mobilization is induced. In cell-based assays, compounds that selectively inhibit upstream FeyRI-mediated degranulation inhibit degranulation of cells such as mast or basophil cells that are activated or stimulated with an IgG-specific allergen or binding agent (such as an 10 anti-IgG antibody or fragment) but do not appreciably inhibit degranulation of cells that are activated or stimulated with degranulating agents that bypass the FcyRI signaling pathway, such as, for example the calcium ionophores ionomycin and A23187. \"Ionophore-Induced Degranulation\" or \"Ionophore-Mediated Degranulation\" refers to degranulation of a cell, such as a mast or basophil cell, that occurs upon exposure to a 15 calcium ionophore such as, for example, ionomycin or A23187. \"Syk Kinsase\" refers to the well-known 72kDa non-receptor (cytoplasmic) spleen protein tyrosine kinase expressed in B-cells and other hematopoetic cells. Syk kinase includes two consensus Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains in tandem that bind to phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (\"ITAMs\"), a \"linker\" 20 domain and a catalytic domain (for a review of the structure and function of Syk kinase see Sada et al., 2001, J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 130:177-186); see also Turner et al., 2000, Immunology Today 21:148-154). Syk kinase has been extensively studied as an effector of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling (Turner et al., 2000, supra). Syk kinase is also critical for tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins which regulate important pathways leading 25 from immunoreceptors, such as Ca 2 mobilization and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (see, e.g., FIG. 2) and degranulation. Syk kinase also plays a critical role in integrin signaling in neutrophils (see, e.g., Mocsai et al. 2002, Immunity 16:547-558). As used herein, Syk kinase includes kinases from any species of animal, including but not limited to, homosapiens, simian, bovine, porcine, rodent, etc., recognized as 30 belonging to the Syk family. Specifically included are isoforms, splice variants, allelic variants, mutants, both naturally occuring and man-made. The amino acid sequences of such Syk kinases are well known and available from GENBANK. Specific examples of mRNAs encoding different isoforms of human Syk kinase can be found at GENBANK 26 WO 2004/014382 PCT/US2003/024087 accession no. gil21361552[reflNM__003177.21, gil496899lembjZ29630.1|HSSYKPTK[496899] and gil15030258|gbIBC01 1399.1 IBC01 1399[15030258], which are incorporated herein by reference. 5 Skilled artisans will appreciate that tyrosine kinases belonging to other families may have active sites or binding pockets that are similar in three-dimensional structure to that of Syk. As a consequence of this structural similarity, such kinases, referred to herein as \"Syk mimics,\" are expected to catalyze phosphorylation of substrates phosphorylated by Syk. Thus, it will be appreciated that such Syk mimics, signal transduction cascades in which 10 such Syk mimics play a role and biological responses effected by such Syk mimics and Syk mimic-dependent signaling cascades may be regulated, and in particular inhibited, with the 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds described herein. \"Syk-Dependent Signaling Cascade\" refers to a signal transduction cascade in which Syk kinase plays a role. Non-limiting examples of such Syk-dependent signaling cascades 15 include the FcaRI, FceRI, FcyRI, FcyRIII, BCR and integrin signaling cascades. \"Autoimmune Disease\" refers to those diseases which are commonly associated with the nonanaphylactic hypersensitivity reactions (Type II, Type III and/or Type IV hypersensitivity reactions) that generally result as a consequence of the subject's own humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response to one or more immunogenic substances of 20 endogenous and/or exogenous origin. Such autoimmune diseases are distinguished from diseases associated with the anaphylactic (Type I or IgE-mediated ) hypersensitivity reactions. 6.2 The 2,4-Pyrimidinediamine Compounds The compounds of the invention are generally 2,4-pyrimidinediamine compounds 25 according to structural formula (I): R 6 R5 -~N L2L\n\nR\n\n4 'N N N R2 H H including salts, hydrates, solvates and N-oxides thereof, wherein: L and I 2 are each, independently of one another, selected from the group consisting 30 of a direct bond and a linker;
