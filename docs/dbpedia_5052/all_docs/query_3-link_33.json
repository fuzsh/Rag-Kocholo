        "text": "Until completion of the bulk ore and coal terminals at Saldanha and Richards Bay, the “Tavern of the Seas” as it is sometimes known, was South Africa’s second-largest Port.\n\nThe harbour is made up of:\n\n1. The Alfred Basin (opened in 1870)\n\n2. The Victoria Basin (opened in 1905)\n\n3. The Duncan Dock (opened in 1945)\n\n4. Ben Schoeman Dock (opened in 1977)\n\nCombined, they are officially known as “Table Bay Harbour”.\n\nTheir wharves provided berthing facilities for the mailships, and other passenger liners as well as general cargo vessels. However, nowadays only container vessels and cruise-liners use the Duncan and Ben Schoeman docks while the Victoria and Albert basins are used by trawlers and pleasure craft as well as berthing for the tugs. Also, at the eastern end of Duncan Dock is a yachting harbour.\n\nApart from numerous wharf cranes there is a floating crane that can handle loads of up to 60 tons, the James Cochrane floating dock with a length of 137ft 6in, 5 slipways (of which 4 are designed for small craft and yachts), the Robinson graving dock with a length of 529 feet (which was opened in 1882 and is said to be the oldest dry dock still in daily use) and finally, the massive Sturrock graving dock with a length of 1,181 feet which, at the time of opening in 1945, was the biggest such facility in the southern hemisphere.\n\nWith acknowledgement to Wikipedia for some of the information used in the captions, the bulk of the photos are THL images with thanks to Eurika Deminey for access to those negatives for printing in my darkroom, Yolanda Meyer, present day librarian of the Transnet Heritage Library, Eric Conradie for the scan of Thomas Bowler's magnificent painting of the ceremonial \"turning the first sod\" by Prince Alfred in 1860, Charlie for restoring some of the pre-1900 THL negs and David Werbeloff. Some of the remaining colour images are by the late Roger Perry plus a few of my own. The chapter continues with an exceptional batch of colour photographs by Trevor Jones and Brian Ingpen to whom I tender my gratitude and thanks. The chapter concludes with fine photos by Dick Manton that cover a later period in the Harbour when class S2 shunters were active, plus some scenes from John Carter and Peter Micenko.\n\nSpecial mentions for Father Scott Davidson who lent his knowledge of the tugs, and Len Ward of the Crankhandle Club who provided the makes and years of manufacture of the cars in the dockside scene in photo 32.\n\nThanks also to Bruno Martin who has again provided a splendid map of the Table Bay Harbour complex and Andrew Deacon who, as usual, has done the formatting.\n\nNote: Extracts from the late Captain Percy Sharp’s book “PILOT” published by T.V. Bulpin and Marischal Murray's book \"Union Castle Chronicle 1853-1953\" are acknowledged with thanks.\n\n3. Initially, Table Bay Harbour resorted under jurisdiction of the Cape Harbour Board which, in parallel with separate boards at Port Elizabeth and East London, had been founded in 1843. Building the breakwater without any heavy earth-moving machinery must have been tedious, although labour at that time was plentiful due to the severe penalties imposed on bushmen that required them to do manual labour on the harbour construction for offences like sheep-stealing. However, by the early 1870's the work was beyond the capacity of manual labour and animal-drawn carts. The Harbour board made the surprising decision to install a 7ft gauge railway to progress the harbour construction. According to Frank Holland, the engine shown in this rare print from the Heritage Library is Harbour Board No 1 (Fletcher Jennings 148 of 1874). It is shunting two end-tipping wagons in the quarry that provided fill for the breakwater.\n\nIt is thus worth mentioning that, over the years, South Africa used a much wider range of railway gauges than is generally supposed: 7ft, 4ft-8½ins, 3ft-6ins, 2ft-6ins and 2ft.\n\nAfter writing the above, John Middleton kindly provided more information (see below). As the author of the authoritative series on Industrial locomotives in South Africa, his information has to be more reliable. In defence of Frank Holland it should be mentioned that he did not have access to the numerous sources that John has used:\n\n\"The first 7’0” gauge locomotive at Table Bay (an inside cylinder 0-4-0ST) appears to have been built by Hughes of Loughborough for which a bill of lading exists which shows it arrived on the “Navarino” on 2 October 1862. On 19 July 1870 another report in the Cape Argus stated that “the wagons, which are of iron, discharged their loads through a trap in the bottom, were hauled along several lines of railway by two engines, one of them constructed at the works and being the first locomotive made in South Africa”. The identity of this second locomotive has remained a mystery since there is no reference to it in the Harbour Board minutes which is strange since the building of a locomotive would surely have been worthy of discussion at the time. Locomotive wheels were shipped to the Harbour Board in late 1863 and “castings” in late 1864, whether these were spare parts or parts for the second engine is unknown. There is a painting by Otto Lansberg of the breakwater under construction in 1869 showing a side or well tank locomotive at work. Since the Hughes locomotive was a saddle tank, this again suggests two locomotives were here prior to 1870.\n\nI wonder if Photo 3 is actually the mysterious second loco – I will put feelers out in the UK as to a possible builder.\n\nPhoto 4 incidentally depicts one of the three 7’0” gauge Black Hawthorns (Table Bay Nos 4, 5 and 8 delivered in 1881 (4/5) and 1893 (8))\".\n\n9. Shown departing Cape Town around the time of the Boer War, the racing lines of the Union Steamship Company's RMS \"Scot\" are apparent in this beautiful portrait by Peter Bilas.\n\nShe was fast. In 1893 she took the record for the Southampton - Cape Town run: 14 days, 18 hours, 57 minutes. This lasted for 43 years. In his \"Union Castle Chronicle 1853-1953\" Marischal Murray tells us:\n\n\"After the launch of the DUNOTTAR CASTLE in May, 1890, the new mail steamer for the Union Line was laid down, also on the Clyde. The DUNOTTAR CASTLE had given Scotland great advertisement. Not to be outdone in this respect, the Union Company announced that their new ship would be named the SCOT. On the Clyde, Captain de la Cour Travers, Commodore of the Union Line, and Mr Dusatoy, Superintendent Engineer, supervised the construction of the SCOT. Towards the end of 1890 the hull and clipper bows of the new liner took on bold outline against the background of Dumbarton Rock. As figurehead the vessel bore an effigy of the 'Great Scot' himself, Sir William Wallace, represented with hand on sword, ready to take up the latest challenge. Like the DUNNOTAR CASTLE, the SCOT, too, had her motto. That of the Castle ship was proud, defiant: 'They say what they say; let them say'. The motto of the Union liner was more apposite: 'Ex Unite Vires\": 'Strength out of Union'.\n\nOn December 30, 1890, the SCOT was launched by Miss Giles, daughter of the Chairman of the Union Line. In the Union fleet the new vessel represented a considerable advance in size, being of 6,884 tons, or half as large again as the MEXICAN (4,661 tons), hitherto the largest of the Company's ships. Her tonnage, moreover, was 1,000 greater than that of the DUNNOTAR CASTLE. Her twin screws marked an innovation and were indicative of the progressive policy now being adopted by the Union Line. The SCOT carried 208 first-, 100 second- and 100 third-class passengers, the first-class passengers being berthed amidships. The public rooms were in advance of anything seen before. Her clipper bows, tall funnels and graceful lines easily made her one of the most handsome ships afloat. She cost £254,000 to build.\"\n\n10. According to Holland the broad-gauge era at TBH ended in 1904. The sheer number of ships at anchor in the roadstead suggests that this photo was made during the Boer War (see also the next picture). A high resolution enlargement reveals that the S-shaped viaduct on the left, which carried the broad-gauge feeder track connecting the quarry to the breakwater, had only recently been taken out of use. To the right of the mobile shear-legs that were used to raise an end of the 7ft-gauge end-tip wagons, is a new-looking and incomplete 3ft-6ins gauge ramp leading up to the breakwater. Beneath the disused viaduct are 3ft-6ins tracks that served the piers and jetties with one of the Harbour Board's Black Hawthorne saddle tanks visible outside the arch-doored warehouse that today houses the Mitchell Brewery Company's tavern. A traction engine with four trailers is visible between the sheds in the foreground.\n\nBy the way, that rake of disused end-tipping wagons just beyond the shear-legs is staged almost exactly where the balcony of the V&A Spur is situated today!\n\n11. The four sailing ships moored at No 1 Jetty as well as the white-painted steamer in the left background tell us this view was made at the same time as photo 9. What looks like the Pilot's boat seems to be on its way to the inner (Alfred) basin and a steam tug is parked off adjacent to the front vessel at No 1 Jetty. The profusion of vessels in the roadstead suggest extraordinary circumstances and thanks to Brian Ingpen we are able to put a fairly accurate date on this and the previous picture, I quote:\n\n\"this photo is......likely to have been taken circa 1902 – the Harbour Café is under construction (completed 1902) and the 1904-vintage Port Office building on the western side of the cut into Alfred Basin is not there...... The number of ships would indicate it was perhaps [towards] the end of the Anglo-Boer war\".\n\n13. Laid down in 1915 as Amroth Castle but with construction delayed by WW1, the four-funnelled Union-Castle mailship was finally launched in September 1919 as Arundel Castle. She carried 234 passengers in magnificent first class accommodation, 362 in second class, and 274 in third class. The largest vessel on the South African service at the time arrived in Cape Town on her maiden voyage in May 1921, causing a sensation among local shipping folks and the general population. In January 1937 she returned to the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland, for a complete refit that included re-engining to enable her to maintain the service speed of the accelerated 14-day mail service between Cape Town and Southampton. Her four funnels were replaced with two and she was given a clipper bow.\n\nShe returned to service in October that year, but soon after the declaration of war in 1939, she was requisitioned for trooping operations throughout the war, except for a brief voyage to Sweden under diplomatic immunity in a Red Cross prisoner-of-war exchange operation. From April 1948, she returned to civilian service for about a year as an immigrant ship, and underwent another refit before resuming her role as a mailship on Union-Castle’s Southampton-South Africa service in September 1950. Her passenger capacity had been reduced during the various refits to 168 in first class and increased to 371 in tourist class.\n\nThe photograph shows her sailing for Southampton, probably in 1936, shortly before she underwent her major refit.\n\nThe tug at the bow is Ludwig Wiener, built for the South African Railways and Harbours Administration in 1913 for service in Cape Town. With the arrival of the new oil-burning steam tug F.T. Bates in Cape Town in 1951, Ludwig Wiener was transferred to Durban and was withdrawn from service ten years later when the last steam tug to be built for operations in South African harbours, J.R. More, entered service in Durban. [thank you Brian for this and the next two comprehensive captions]\n\n22. HMS VANGUARD was floodlit at night in Duncan Dock. Wikipedia provides a good potted history of this fine ship:\n\n\"HMS Vanguard was a British fast battleship built during World War II and commissioned after the war. She was the only ship of her class, the biggest and fastest of the Royal Navy's battleships, and the last battleship to be launched in the world. Work on the ship's design commenced before the war because the Royal Navy anticipated being outnumbered by the combined German and Japanese battleships in the early 1940s. The British had enough 15-inch guns and turrets in storage to allow one ship of a modified Lion-class battleship design to be completed faster than the ships of that class that had already been laid down. Work on Vanguard was started and stopped several times during the war and even after construction had begun, her design was revised several times to reflect war experience. These stoppages and changes prevented her from being completed during the war.\n\nVanguard's first task after completing her sea trial at the end of 1946 was..........to convey King George VI and his family on the first Royal Tour of South Africa by a reigning monarch.\"\n\n34. The R.B.WATERSTON and the DANIE HUGO lying astern at No 1 Jetty, await their next duty in the Victoria Basin. The grand building on the right was the Port Captain's office its twin gables carry its date of construction: 1904. The tablecloth indicates that a strong South-easter, the Cape Doctor, was in attendance.\n\nThe R.B.WATERSTON was launched in August 1954 and initially saw service in East London but later was transferred to Cape Town. She had a gross tonnage of 754 tons and her engines produced 2796 IHp. She had a flat-sided funnel similar to that fitted to a Durban tug - the J.D.WHITE. According to Father Scott: The Port Captain at East London at that time was unhappy with the WATERSTON which he described as \"sluggish, unmaneuverable and under-powered\"! [This seems due to the fact that Buffalo Harbour is a narrow river port and within its confines such characteristics could be a severe hindrance]\n\nBrian Ingpen has provided further information about the Waterston:\n\n\"this photo might have been taken during the time when RB Waterston was based in Walvis Bay and came to Cape Town for refit every few years. She often stopped at Lüderitz to pick up the tow of lighters for refit in Cape Town. In this photo, she looks really smart, but she does not have her bow fender or all her tyre-fenders, suggesting that she is about to return to Walvis Bay after such a refit. In the next photo she does have some tyre fenders which she might have needed when connecting the tow to the lighters to tow them back to Luderitz\".\n\n41. The finest SAR photo of all, as far as this author is concerned! The beautiful CARNARVON CASTLE is seen in a similar position to the previous photo leaving Duncan Dock with the T.H.WATERMEYER assisting the mailship out of Port. In 1956 I had the pleasure of sailing in Carnarvon Castle between Cape Town and Durban - one of many trips on Union Castle ships and I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the voyage on this gracious veteran.\n\nWikipedia provides the following details of Carnarvon Castle which serve to illustrate the eventful career she had - particularly during WW2.\n\n\"Carnarvon Castle was built by Harland and Wolff, Belfast and launched on 14 January 1926. She was completed on 26 June 1926 and entered service for the Union-Castle Line. She was named after Caernarfon Castle. She was the first of the Union-Castle mail ships to exceed 20,000 tons, and was the first motor ship to be used on the sailings between Britain and the Cape of Good Hope. She had two squat funnels, the forward-most of which was a dummy. She served on the route until 1936, when a revised contract to carry the mails required a speed of at least 19 kn (35 km/h; 22 mph), which would result in a voyage to the Cape lasting no more than 13 and a half days. Carnarvon Castle required a refit and was reworked by her original builders between 1937 and 1938. Her engines were replaced, a single funnel replaced the original two, and her passenger capacity was altered. After undergoing sea trials on 26 June 1938, she returned to her original route on 8 July, setting a new record for the passage to the Cape of 12 days, 13 hours, 38 minutes. The record stood until 1954.\n\nCarnarvon Castle was at Cape Town at the outbreak of the Second World War, and was requisitioned by the Royal Navy on 8 September 1939. She sailed to Simonstown naval base and was converted to an armed merchant cruiser. Commissioned as HMS Carnarvon Castle on 9 October, she sailed into the South Atlantic. On 5 December she encountered the German auxiliary cruiser Thor and had a five-hour running battle with her. She suffered heavily in the battle, sustaining 27 hits causing 4 dead and 27 wounded. Thor was apparently undamaged in the encounter. Carnarvon Castle put into Montevideo for repairs, and was repaired with steel plate reportedly salvaged from the German cruiser (pocket battleship) Admiral Graf Spee.\n\nCarnarvon Castle's career as an armed merchant cruiser came to an end when she was decommissioned in December 1943. There were plans to convert her into an aircraft carrier, but these were abandoned and she underwent a conversion to a troopship at New York City in 1944. She remained on trooping duties after the war, and was finally released from naval service in March 1947. Returned to her original owners, she was back on the route to South Africa by June 1947.\"\n\n44. The flagship of the Union Castle Line, WINDSOR CASTLE, being assisted to the quayside at A-berth from where she would sail for England in due course. Wikipedia describes her thus:\n\n\"The steam-turbine engined, Windsor Castle was the second in a series of three ships planned by Union-Castle in the 1950s as replacements for the company's oldest ships Arundel Castle, Carnarvon Castle and Winchester Castle. Windsor Castle was preceded by Pendennis Castle (delivered in 1958) and followed by Transvaal Castle (delivered in 1961).\n\nIn January 1956, Union-Castle merged with Cayzer, Irvine & Co Ltd's Clan Line and a number of other lines to form British and Commonwealth Shipping, although the constituents retained their individual identities. By the time the merger was finalised, the keel of Pendennis Castle had already been laid at Union-Castle's usually contracted builders Harland and Wolff - in November 1955. Initially conceived as a sister to the 1948 built Pretoria Castle and Edinburgh Castle, new owners B&C required substantial improvements to the plans for the ship, including lengthening the hull some 16 feet (4.9 m) to enable fin stabilisers to be fitted. Industrial disputes at Harland and Wolff delayed the construction of Pendennis Castle, culminating in the vessel being launched without ceremony on Christmas Eve 1957, 14 days after her naming and blessing. She was the last Union-Castle ship to be built at the Belfast yard. Windsor Castle thus became the first passenger, cargo and mail vessel for the South African service, ordered from inception by B&C and was a very different (and more modern) ship than her predecessors\n\nThe last flagship of the Union-Castle Line was built by Cammell Laird Shipbuilders at Birkenhead, Merseyside and launched on 23 June 1959 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Windsor Castle - the only Union-Castle ship ordered from Cammell Laird - was also, briefly, the largest liner built in England, until surpassed by the 41,910 GRT Orient Line's Oriana launched on 3 November 1959.\"\n\n45. An Ellerman & Bucknall “City” class passenger ship at F-berth in Duncan Dock. The following text is provided courtesy of Messrs. D. Hughes and P. Humphries from their book - \"In South African Waters - Passenger Liners since 1930\":\n\n\"This class of motor passenger liner was laid down in the early 1950s to replace the aging pre-war liners which were coming to the end of their economical lives. They were also the last passenger liners ordered by the Ellerman group. They plied the route between the United Kingdom and South Africa for almost 20 years before the drop in demand for sea passages forced their withdrawal. They did the voyage from London to Cape Town in 15 days; their accommodation and service was of the highest standard. The announcement of their withdrawal was received with great regret by the many who prefer an ocean voyage to a journey in an aircraft.\n\nDuring 1971, as each vessel arrived back in London, it was taken out of service. The four vessels were sold to the Mediterranean-based Greek company of Karageogis, who renamed them MEDITERRANEAN ISLAND, MEDITERRANEAN SEA, MEDITERRANEAN SKY & MEDITERRANEAN DOLPHIN respectively. They were converted to roll on/roll off style passenger and car ferries and [sailed] between Italy, Greece and the Greek and Aegean Islands.\"\n\n50. Built in 1925, T.S.McEWEN was an old stalwart of Cape Town. Of 793 gross tons she was rated at 2800 iHP (below: Capt. Percy Sharp refers to 3000 iHP). She was nick-named “Smokey Sue” in her home port. In this photo her forward mast was still mounted ahead of the bridge. The mast position was altered at a later date. Captain Percy Sharp, in his book “PILOT” wrote the following about “Smokey Sue”:\n\n\"I have a soft spot for an old ship. In both my naval and merchant service, the oldest ships evoke my happiest memories, so that I was not displeased when I was told of my appointment as Mate of the tug T. S. McEwen. Not that age was her only attraction. At the time she was in her thirty-second year of service, having been built at Paisley, Scotland, in 1925. More important was her reputation. Her four Scotch water-tube boilers provided a horsepower of fully 3 000, which was more than any other tug in the port could equal. She was well run and well maintained, and her gang of stokers were of the old breed, whose kit consisted of the well-known fifty-three articles — a pack of cards and a sweat-rag. Masters of shovel, slice and rake, they took a pride in the old tug's strength, and in their own ability to keep the steam \"on the blood\" under the most arduous conditions. Her tall, raking funnel, long, low hull and soaring masts were to be seen where the going was roughest. For all her famous smoke-making qualities, she was regarded with secret affection and grudging admiration by those who considered her out-dated. Today, her foremast has been shortened and re-located, but she approaches her half-century in the grand manner. Her exploits are legion, and her place in the history of Table Bay is unique.\"\n\n57. An interesting aerial view of Table Bay Harbour c 1960-62 featuring the Victoria Basin. There is a rather lonely-looking SANLAM BUILDING on the foreshore and who can miss the majestic Table Mountain as a backdrop!\n\nOne could spend several minutes studying this photo: observe the small break-bulk tramp steamers soon to make way for giant container ships, the comprehensive rail facilities, the newly-offloaded parcels vans at No 2 Jetty and the fleet of \"whalers that wintered in Cape Town prior to going south in about November when the European whaling fleets arrived at the Collier Jetty - the fleet was largely Dutch and I think the Dutch stopped whaling in 1964. Also at South Arm [berth 1] is a coaster that I think is Induna that was scrapped in 1962\"). (dating notes provided by Brian Ingpen).\n\nWith reference to Bruno's map, in the left foreground is the East Pier and those wharves to the south of it connect No's 2 and 1 Jetties respectively. Today almost everything around the Victoria Basin has been redeveloped into the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront residential and shopping complex and the rail tracks have disappeared.\n\n95. At the V&A Waterfront 31 years later, in November 1992, I photographed the retired pilot tug ALWYN VINTCENT and the RSA (a research vessel). The VINCENT has since been land-locked at Villiersdorp in the Western Cape in an effort to preserve her.\n\nThe \"Antarctic Legacy of South Africa\" states the following concerning the research ship \"RSA\" :\n\n\"On 31 December 1961, early in the morning, South Africa’s first Antarctic supply ship, the RSA, suitably dressed with flags, docked in Table Bay on its delivery voyage from Osaka, Japan. The 1572 gross ton ship was built by the Fujinagata Shipbuilding and Engineering Company. The keel was laid on 4 April 1961, the RSA was launched on 28 September, undertook sea trials in Osaka Bay over 28/29 November and set sail for Cape Town, South Africa on 30 November on a non-stop voyage.\n\nLoading for Antarctica commenced on the 2nd of January, and on the 6th the new ship sailed from the Table Bay Docks for Dronning Maud Land with members of the Third SANAE Overwintering team (S3) aboard, under the leadership of Radio Technician Marten du Preez. Her first voyage south followed the placement of the first two SANAE over-wintering teams in Norway Station by the Norwegian vessels Polarbjørn in 1959/60 and Polarhav in 1960/61.\"\n\nMore notes from Brian:\n\n\"RSA was South Africa’s polar supply vessel from 1961 to 1978 when she was replaced by S.A. Agulhas. Later, RSA was painted white and given a yellow funnel when she became a unit in the South African Navy to clandestine operations off the South West African & Angolan coasts. When this photograph was taken, she was used as a seamen’s training vessel, prior to her being scrapped\".\n\n109. Class 6D 579 at the South Arm in 1963. From here on the emphasis shifts towards the harbour railways and their role in providing a service for the thousands of cargo vessels that called on Table Bay Harbour.\n\nSoon after the arrival of South Africa's first standard-gauge locomotive, the contractors 0-4-2WT (later named \"Blackie\"), serving the wharves by locomotive instead of animal-drawn carts began. According to Holland this was most likely during 1860. Until 1873 when the first 3ft-6ins gauge engines arrived for Harbour Service, harbour shunting at Cape Town would have been done by the road engines of the Cape Town Railway and Dock Company. The workload would have only gradually have outgrown this arrangement but come the decision to adopt the 3ft-6ins gauge as the standard for new construction from 1st January 1873, the various Harbour Boards elected to order their own engines.\n\nThe 7ft-0ins gauge used for the breakwater and harbour construction work from 1874, as described and illustrated above, was not used for general freight and is therefore outside the scope of the next section of this chapter. Harbour boards were established by the Cape Colonial government in 1843 but only began to use rail to serve the ports with their own engines from 1873. The CGR took over from the Harbour Boards in 1908 and soon after Union in 1910 the ports as well as their rail operations were absorbed into the SAR&H. Some 60 harbour engines were inherited by SAR, which promptly classified them as obsolete. About 25 were eventually used by Table Bay Harbour but the exact number changed regularly and in any case needs considerably more research than can be devoted in a work such as SoAR.\n\nAfter 1910 the use of ex-road engines in the harbours was resumed by SAR, slowly at first but with increasing rapidity from the early thirties. By 1925 the number of ex-Harbour Board locomotives had dwindled to 25 and by 1945 none were left (although some still found employment in private industrial service). After the Simonstown line was electrified in 1928, sixth class engines previously used to haul commuters became the standard docks shunting power and this continued until they were gradually replaced by new Krupp S2-class 0-8-0s from 1952/3. After the opening of Bellville marshalling yard in 1955 the TBH sixes were mainly confined to the shunts.\n\n111. From 1955 the rail entrance to the harbour was at its eastern end via a direct connection off the avoiding line. This newly arrived hauler had just come in with empties from Bellville.\n\nAt this time 3Rs were common in Cape Western hauler service although, in truth several different classes were used. In spite of their diminutive 3ft-9½ins driving wheels they could handle 50mph with ease and thus became the preferred power for Bellville haulers until the 14CRBs took over this service. As an aside it is interesting to record that these Hendrie-designed engines were very large for Cape-gauge lines when introduced on the Natal Government Railways in 1909 and, incredibly, they retained their slide valves throughout their working lives (where else could you find a slide-valve 4-8-2 in the seventies?). During the thirties and forties all the 30 class 3s were reboilered with Watson std No 2 boilers, becoming class 3Rs in the process.\n\n116. Export fruit being loaded at South Arm into the Rustenberg Castle. The pallets seem to be coming out of an upper level of the Imperial Cold Storage warehouse and not from the type OZ fruit wagons along the wharf. The fact that none of the later type O wagons with fully-opening sides are visible and the attire of the ladies in the foreground appears to date this photo around the middle 1960s. The passenger liner in the left background is a Dutch \"Royal Inter-Ocean Line\" RUYS-class ship.\n\nConcerning the interesting example of Union Castle's cargo fleet, the following was extracted from Laurence Dunn's book on the subject (please note that for obvious reasons I have changed it to past tense):\n\n\"The Rustenburg Castle, 8,332 tons, was one of two post-war ships in this class. She and her sister Riebeeck Castle differed in having a more compact superstructure, with the third hatch placed in front of the bridge. These two vessels measured 474ft overall x 63ft breadth, had over 400,000 cubic feet of insulated space and accommodation for seven passengers. The Rustenburg Castle, launched on 5 March 1946, was named after a small town in the Transvaal which is the centre of a famous citrus fruit, tobacco and cotton growing district\".\n\n119. We have seen (photo 10) how the 7ft-gauge network was shut down early in the 20th century. Also around this time the big quarry that had been used to provide the stone that built the breakwater finally was closed and the area it occupied used to accommodate oil storage tanks. However, the breakwater work continued as it was extended twice more after WWI. This time the stone had to come from much further away, some 33 miles in fact - at Klipheuwel on the Malmesbury line. When this photo was made in April 1956, SAR was still using concrete blocks to construct the breakwater; those wooden boxes were the moulds and a few completed blocks can be seen on the left. Ever since the scrapping of the Harbour tank engines shunting the block yard was handled by sixth classes, in this case 6H 621. The huge block-yard straddle crane was a feature of the harbour landscape for almost a century.\n\nIn later years these oblong blocks were replaced by the more effective \"dolosse\" (also made of concrete but using sheet-steel moulds) an invention accredited to SAR Harbour Engineer Merrifield of East London in 1963. Dolosse have since become commonplace all around the world.\n\n120. In March 1980 Dick found two Class S2's shortly after sunrise shunting the main harbour reception/departure sidings adjacent to the Duncan Dock. These were the sidings from where incoming trains were collected by the harbour shunters and distributed to the various wharves. Today but one track remains here and all the catenaries and mast poles have disappeared. Reason: no more traffic (except for the brave efforts of Ceres Rail to revive some of it).\n\nThe S2 class short-wheelbase light-axleload 0-8-0's were synonymous with shunting in the Administration’s harbours from their arrival in 1952/3 right through to the end of steam in 1982. 23 class S2's were initially allocated to Paarden Eiland rising to over 30 by the mid 70's; 11 engines handled the dock shunting on a daily basis and six or seven locos could often be seen coupled together going to and from Paarden Eiland shed at shift changes. An interesting point to make here is that due to being restricted to 25mph the S2s were considered unsuitable for the dual role of hauling and shunting.\n\n125. Empty DZs being shoved to the East Pier by S2 3717. To the left are the warehouses of the North Pier which today are full of craft stuff and exotic foods you can buy. A couple of years ago the white-roofed shed was used to house the Titanic exhibition where Charlie's Auntie Amy's silver jewellery case, which went down with the ship and had been dredged off the ocean floor, was on display!\n\nNowadays this corner will be familiar to anyone who regularly visits the Waterfront, it is plumb in the heart of the show. Fast forward twenty years and the photographer could have had a jug of Bosun's Bitter in one hand - he would be standing outside the Mitchell's Brewery bar; its building first appeared in the bottom left-hand corner of photo 10.\n\nOh, one small detail: today there is no trace of the railway, let alone the locomotive.\n\n129. The same view today. No's 1 and 2 Jetties are where they always have been but the oil tanks have made way for upmarket apartments and there is not a railway line to be seen west of the Basins. The Alfred Basin, practically surrounded by the most expensive accommodations in the land, has been extended into the old quarry. Trust me, one needs to be a dollar multi-millionaire to be able to afford one of those flats on the edges of this inner, inner Alfred Basin. How many of those living in these opulent pads spare a thought for the wretches who dug that quarry more than 150 years ago?\n\nBeneath the sea-green roofs are the shopping malls of the V&A Waterfront, where one also needs to be pretty well-off to shop. That is, unless you're going for a hamburger, chips and onion rings."
