        "text": "If you’re in the mood to listen to music or tune into a podcast, it’s safe to say Spotify might be one of your go-to platforms. This streaming service offers a plethora of music and podcast genres, ensuring there’s something for everyone’s interests and moods.\n\nTo learn more about its users, listening data, and more, we’ve rounded up some essential Spotify statistics you need to know in 2024.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at Spotify on a global scale. Considering the service is available across so many markets worldwide, Spotify does have a pretty expansive user base to contribute to its success. Here are a few Spotify statistics that show just how popular it’s become over the years:\n\n1. As of the Fourth Quarter of 2023, Spotify Has 602 Million Active Users Worldwide\n\nAs a host to both music and podcasts, Spotify has become a go-to service for many. So, it’s no wonder they’ve amassed a whopping 602 million active users around the globe as of late 2023.\n\n2. There Are 379 Million Ad-Supported Monthly Active Users on Spotify\n\nOne of the great things about Spotify is that it gives users the option to use the service for free or pay for a premium account. Free users will hear and see ads every so often and are unable to access the full range of features the streaming service provides. As of the third quarter of 2023, Spotify reportedly had 379 million monthly active users, up from 295 million in the same quarter last year, on a free, ad-supported plan.\n\n3. The Service Has 236 Million Premium Subscribers Globally\n\nFor those who want to ditch the ads, it’s worthwhile to invest in Spotify’s premium plan. In Q4 2023, it was reported that Spotify has 236 million premium subscribers worldwide. That number has more than doubled since early 2017, showing how much the service has grown over the years.\n\n4. Spotify’s 2023 Revenue Was Over 13.2 Billion Euros\n\nA majority of Spotify’s revenue comes from premium subscriptions rather than ad placements. In 2024, the company generated over 13.2 billion euros in revenue, which was up from 11 billion in 2022. So, it’s clear that people are seeing the value of investing in a premium account.\n\nTo kick things off, let’s take a look at some Spotify statistics that are specific to the streaming service’s user base in the UK. Here’s what you need to know:\n\n5. Digital Music Enthusiasts in the U.S. Prefer Spotify\n\nApproximately 47% of digital music enthusiasts in the United States prefer Spotify. Interestingly, among the 91% of U.S. respondents familiar with Spotify, 52% hold a positive view of the brand. In terms of usage, 43% of U.S. digital music users engage with Spotify. This implies that among the 91% who are aware of the brand, 47% actively use its services.\n\n6. Spotify Dominates the Audio Subscription Market With 62% of UK Subscribers Holding a Spotify Account in 2020\n\nIn 2020, Kantar’s Entertainment on Demand service for the audio subscription market found that 62% of UK subscribers had a Spotify account. This made it the most popular among music streamers.\n\nBetween the music and podcasts, there’s so much content for users to consume on Spotify. And considering that content spans a wide array of genres, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. Here are some Spotify statistics that show what people are listening to when it comes to different genres:\n\n7. The Most Popular Podcast Genre for Men is Humor and for Women is Health and Fitness\n\nWorldwide on Spotify, the predominant podcast genre among men revolves around humor, with notable entries like \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" In contrast, women tend to gravitate towards health and fitness content. Spotify has reported that the most rapidly expanding podcast categories globally in 2023 include society and culture, education, religion and spirituality, health and fitness, as well as business and technology.\n\nNow, the question is… Who is using Spotify? Luckily, some helpful Spotify data gives us insight into their global user base. For instance, do men or women use Spotify more often? Where are Spotify’s users located? We can answer those questions with these Spotify statistics:\n\n8. Spotify is Accessible in over 180 Countries Across the Globe\n\nAn unparalleled number of listeners can explore, organize, and enjoy a diverse array of over 100 million songs, 6 million podcast episodes, and 350,000 audiobooks individually on Spotify. As the foremost global audio streaming subscription service, Spotify boasts a user base exceeding 615 million individuals, with over 239 million dedicated subscribers spanning across more than 180 markets worldwide.\n\n9. Females Make Up 56% of Spotify’s User Base in the U.S.\n\nData shows that Spotify is a bit more popular among females, as they make up 56% of the platform’s user base. Males are just 44% of Spotify’s users. As Spotify continues to grow, perhaps we’ll see that gap shrink over time.\n\n10. Most of Spotify’s Users in the U.S. Are Ages 25-34\n\nA majority of Spotify’s users are on the younger side, being that they’re under 35 years of age. The largest age group on Spotify is those between the ages of 25 and 34. They make up 29% of users.\n\n11. 30% of Americans Reportedly Used Spotify Every Month in 2021\n\nUp by 1% from the previous year, 30% of Americans were reportedly using Spotify monthly in 2021. Although it’s only a small increase, it does show the streaming service is securing more users. Weekly usage saw a spike as well. From 2020 to 2021, weekly Spotify usage in America increased from 22% to 28%.\n\nWhether you’re a Spotify user or not, you’re probably familiar with Spotify Wrapped. This feature gets a ton of attention around the holiday season at the end of the year because everyone wants to share their top artists and songs with friends and family on social media. Here are some Spotify statistics about the Wrapped feature and its success:\n\n12. Spotify Wrapped Officially Launched in 2017\n\nWrapped initially started back in 2015 but was known as the Year in Music at the time. This showcased the biggest songs of the year, as well as an individual user’s top 100 songs. It was renamed Wrapped in 2016. However, it wasn’t until 2017 that its functionality changed. It now features tons of personalised listening data for users to see what they loved over the course of the year.\n\n13. App Downloads Increased After Spotify Wrapped Shares\n\nIn the first week of December 2020, Spotify saw a 21% increase in mobile app downloads after the year’s Spotify Wrapped was released. Everyone wants to partake in the fun!\n\nSure, you can see your personal listening statistics on Spotify. But what if you want to know about the listening-related Spotify statistics of users around the world? Here are some helpful data:\n\n14. There Are Over 100 Million Tracks on Spotify\n\nNo matter what you’re in the mood to listen to, Spotify likely has you covered! There are over 100 million tracks on the platform, giving you a plethora of artists and genres to choose from.\n\n15. North American Users Spend the Most Time on Spotify\n\nWhen breaking down daily Spotify usage by region, North America comes out on top. Users based in North America spend an average of 140 minutes daily on Spotify.\n\nHave you ever wondered which artists reign supreme on Spotify? Well, some interesting Spotify statistics allow us to see the artists that gain the most streams, as well as which songs are the most popular. Check out this data:\n\n16. Taylor Swift Was the Most-Streamed Artist Globally in 2023\n\nThe confirmation is in: Taylor Swift claims the title of the most-streamed artist in 2023, as per Spotify's recent announcement.\n\nOn November 29, 2023, Spotify unveiled its 2023 Wrapped lists, revealing the year's most-streamed music. Swift's songs resonated with audiences, accumulating over 26.1 billion streams globally since January 1. This remarkable feat is perhaps influenced by the singer's consistent media presence, including her high-profile romance with NFL football star Travis Kelce and the attention-grabbing concert ticket controversies that marked the end of 2023.\n\n17. The Top Song of 2023 Was “Flowers” by Miley Cyrus\n\nMiley Cyrus' \"Flowers\" clinched the title of the most-streamed global track with 1.6 billion streams since its January release. Bad Bunny, the second most-streamed artist, featured solo with \"WHERE SHE GOES\" (No. 40) and collaborated with Grupo Frontera and Chenco Corleone on \"un x100to\" (No. 16) and \"Me Porto Bonito\" (No. 47).\n\nMorgan Wallen's \"Last Night\" secured the No. 28 spot, and Taylor Swift, Spotify's top artist of the year, claimed three spots with her hits \"Anti-Hero\" (No. 10), \"Cruel Summer\" (No. 6), and \"Blank Space\" (No. 38) on the year-end playlist.\n\n18. Over $7 Billion Was Paid to Spotify Artists in 2021\n\nOf course, Spotify does have to pay royalties to the artists who allow their music to be streamed over the platform. In 2021, Spotify paid over $7 billion to its artists.\n\nWhile Spotify may be a go-to for streaming music, you don’t want to skip out on their massive library of podcasts. It’s become a popular platform for podcast creators to upload episodes since it allows them to reach a wider audience. Check out these Spotify statistics regarding podcasts:\n\n19. There Are More Than 6 Million Podcast Titles on Spotify\n\nAccording to Spotify, the platform is home to over 6 million podcast titles, making it a common choice for podcast creators. Many podcasters have chosen to upload exclusively to Spotify and ditch any other podcasting platforms.\n\n20. Spotify Reaches 32.5 Million Podcast Listeners Per Month\n\nWhen looking at the data for 2022, it’s estimated that Spotify will reach 32.5 million podcast listeners monthly. On the other hand, it’s predicted that Apple Podcasts will only reach 28.5 million monthly listeners. So, that means Spotify seems to be coming out on top for the time being.\n\n21. The Joe Rogan Experience Was the Top Podcast in 2023\n\nThe top podcast globally in 2023 was The Joe Rogan Experience, which streams exclusively on Spotify."
