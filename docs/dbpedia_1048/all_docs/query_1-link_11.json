Please refer to the appropriate style manual or other sources if you have any questions.\n\nSelect Citation Style\n\nApril 14, 1912\n\nMorning\n\nCapt. Edward J. Smith cancels a scheduled lifeboat drill.\n\n5:50 PM\n\nAfter receiving iceberg warnings throughout the day, Captain Smith changes the Titanic's course, heading slightly south. However, the ship's speed is not lowered.\n\n9:40 PM\n\nThe Mesaba sends a warning to the Titanic about an ice field that includes “heavy pack ice and [a] great number [of] large icebergs.” Wireless operator Jack Phillips—who works for the Marconi Company—is handling passengers' messages and never passes the warning on to the Titanic's bridge.\n\n10:00 PM\n\nThe shift changes on the bridge, with First Officer William Murdoch relieving Second Officer Charles Lightoller as the officer of the watch.\n\nLookouts Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee begin their watch in the Titanic's crow's nest. The night is unusually calm, making icebergs more difficult to see—because there are no waves breaking at the icebergs. Adding to the difficulties is the fact that the crow’s nest's binoculars have been misplaced.\n\n10:55 PM\n\nThe nearby Californian radios the Titanic: “Say, old man, we are stopped and surrounded by ice.” An annoyed Phillips responds: “Shut up! Shut up! I am busy. I am working Cape Race.” (A wireless station is located at Cape Race, Newfoundland, Canada.)\n\n11:00 PM\n\nMost of the Titanic's passengers have retired to their rooms for the evening.\n\n11:35 PM\n\nThe wireless operator on the Californian turns off his radio.\n\nFleet sees an iceberg in the Titanic's path and rings the bell three times to indicate that something is ahead. He then calls the bridge. Murdoch orders the Titanic “hard-a-starboard” (to the left) and the engines reversed. He also closes the doors to the supposedly watertight compartments.\n\n11:40 PM\n\nThe starboard side of the Titanic scrapes along the iceberg.\n\nCaptain Smith arrives on deck and is told that the ship has struck an iceberg. Shortly thereafter he is informed that the mail room is filling with water. Other reports soon come in of water in at least five of the ship's compartments.\n\nDesigner Thomas Andrews surveys the damage. The Titanic was built to remain afloat with only four compartments flooded. Andrews predicts that the ship has only about one to two hours before sinking.\n\nApril 15, 1912\n\n12:00 AM\n\nThe lifeboats begin to be readied for launch. The 20 boats have space for only 1,178 of the more than 2,200 people on board. An order is later given for women and children to board first, with crewmen to row and guide the boats.\n\n12:15 AM\n\nCaptain Smith orders Phillips and Harold Bride to send out a distress signal. Although SOS became the official distress signal several years earlier, many still use CQD. (CQ signifies a general call, and the D means distress.) Over the next several hours, Phillips will send out both.\n\nThe Frankfurt is among the first to respond, but the liner is some 170 nautical miles (315 km) away, to the south. Other ships also offer assistance—including the Titanic's sister ship the Olympic—but are too far away.\n\n12:20 AM\n\nThe Carpathia receives a distress signal from the Titanic: “Come at once. We have struck a berg. It's a CQD, old man.” The Cunard liner immediately changes course to aid the stricken ship some 58 nautical miles (107 km) away. It will take the Carpathia more than three hours to arrive.\n\nFourth Officer Joseph G. Boxhall, tasked with determining the Titanic's position, revises the coordinates. The location is now given as 41°46’ N 50°14’ W in the distress signals.\n\nPassengers waiting to enter lifeboats are entertained by the Titanic's musicians, who initially play in the first-class lounge before eventually moving to the ship's deck. Sources will differ on how long they perform—until shortly before the ship sinks, according to some. Speculation will also surround the last song they perform—likely either “Autumn” or “Nearer My God to Thee.” None of the musicians will survive the sinking.\n\n12:45 PM\n\nNumber 7 on the starboard side is the first lifeboat lowered. It carries some 27 people even though it has room for 65. Many of the first lifeboats will be launched well below capacity, partially because of the crewmen's worry that the davits would be unable to hold a fully loaded lifeboat. In addition, many passengers are initially afraid to leave the ship, believing that the Titanic is unsinkable.\n\nThe Titanic fires the first of eight distress rockets. A ship has been sighted less than 10 nautical miles (18.5 km) away, but the crew is unable to contact it through telegraph or Morse lamp. The rockets also prove unsuccessful.\n\nCrewmen aboard the Californian see the rockets but fail to determine their source. Thought for some time to be the nearby ship seen by the Titanic, the Californian will later be believed to have been some 20 nautical miles (37 km) away. (The mystery ship will be thought to be a Norwegian fishing vessel that was illegally hunting seal.)\n\n12:55 AM\n\nNumber 5 is the second lifeboat to leave the Titanic. As it is being lowered, two male passengers jump into the boat, injuring one of the female occupants.\n\nNumber 6 is launched, containing passenger Molly Brown and lookout Fleet. The lifeboat is commanded by Quartermaster Robert Hichens, who was at the wheel when the Titanic struck the iceberg. His subsequent actions—notably his refusal to look for survivors because they will only find “stiffs”—draw the ire of other occupants, notably Brown, who threatens to throw him overboard.\n\n1:00 AM\n\nNumber 3 is lowered. It carries approximately 39 people, 12 of whom are part of the ship's crew.\n\nWater is seen at the base (E deck) of the Grand Staircase.\n\nNumber 1 is launched with only 12 people; it can hold 40. (An emergency cutter, it is smaller than a standard lifeboat and was designed for quick lowering, as in cases of a person overboard.) Among its occupants are first-class passengers Sir Cosmo Edmund Duff-Gordon and his wife, Lucy. Seven of the occupants are crewmen, and Duff-Gordon pays each of them £5, reportedly to replace lost clothing and gear but possibly—according to subsequent accusations—as a bribe to keep the crew from letting anyone else into the boat.\n\n1:10 AM\n\nNumber 8 is among the first lifeboats lowered on the port side. It is launched with only 28 people, including first-class passenger Lucy Noël Martha, countess of Rothes, who will later man the tiller. Isidor and Ida Straus are offered seats in the boat. However, Isidor refuses to disobey the order of “women and children first.” Ida, in turn, will not leave her husband's side, reportedly saying, “Where you go, I go.” Neither will survive.\n\n1:20 AM\n\nNumber 10 is launched. Among the occupants is nine-week-old Millvina Dean, who will become the last living survivor of the disaster; she will die in 2009 at the age of 97.\n\nNumber 9 on the stern starboard side is lowered. With some 56 people on board, it is nearly full. One of the occupants is American businessman Benjamin Guggenheim's alleged mistress. Guggenheim and his valet later change into formal attire, and he reportedly says, “We've dressed up in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen.” His body will never be recovered.\n\n1:25 AM\n\nPossibly not understanding the direness of the situation, the Olympic radios: “Are you steering southerly to meet us?” The Titanic responds: “We are putting the women off in the boats.” While still hours away, the Olympic will be informed by the Carpathia of the Titanic's sinking.\n\nNumber 12 is lowered with about half of its seats empty. However, it will eventually carry more than 70 people.\n\n1:30 AM\n\nAmid the growing panic, several male passengers try to board number 14, causing Fifth Officer Harold Lowe to fire his gun three times. He is later placed in command of the boat. After the sinking of the Titanic, Lowe will transfer people into lifeboats 4, 10, 12, and collapsible D so he can return to look for survivors in the water. He will pull several men to safety and rescue those in the partially flooded collapsible lifeboat A. (The collapsible lifeboats have canvas sides that can be folded for easy storage. Their capacity is 47.)\n\nPhillips continues to send out distress calls with growing desperation: “Women and children in boats. Cannot last much longer.”\n\nNumber 13 is launched and is soon followed by number 15, which holds many third-class passengers. As it is being lowered, number 15 nearly lands on number 13, which has drifted under it. However, the crewmen in number 13 are able to cut the launch ropes and row to safety.\n\n1:35 AM\n\nNumber 16 is launched.\n\n1:40 AM\n\nCollapsible C is lowered. Among its occupants is White Star chairman J. Bruce Ismay. Although he will later claim that no women or children were in the area when he boarded the lifeboat, others will refute that assertion. His decision not to go down with the ship will result in many branding him a coward.\n\n1:45 AM\n\nNumber 2, an emergency cutter, is launched under the command of Fourth Officer Boxhall. Aboard are some 20 people.\n\nNumber 11 is lowered with some 50 people aboard.\n\nNumber 4 is readied for launch. Madeleine Astor, some five months pregnant, is helped onto the boat by her husband, John Jacob Astor. When Astor asks if he may join her, Second Officer Lightoller—who has strictly followed the order of women and children first—refuses. Astor does not press the issue and steps away. His body will later be recovered.\n\n2:00 AM\n\nThe only lifeboats that remain on the Titanic are three of the collapsible boats.\n\nThe Titanic's bow has sunk low enough that the stern's propellers are now clearly visible above the water.\n\nCrewmen lower collapsible lifeboat D from the roof of the officers' quarters. More than 20 people are in the boat.\n\nAs the Titanic's bow goes under, collapsible A is washed from the deck. Some 20 people manage to get into the boat, which is partly filled with water. By the time Lowe in number 14 comes to their aid, only 12 are alive. Three bodies are left in the boat, which will be discovered a month later by the Oceanic.\n\nAs crewmen try to release collapsible B, it falls, and, before it can be righted, it is swept off the Titanic. Some 30 men find safety on the still-overturned lifeboat, including wireless operator Bride and Second Officer Lightoller. The men will later be taken aboard numbers 4 and 12.\n\nCaptain Smith releases the crew, saying that “it's every man for himself.” Smith is reportedly last seen on the bridge. His body will never be recovered.\n\n2:17 AM\n\nPhillips sends a final distress signal. He reportedly makes it to the overturned collapsible lifeboat B but succumbs to exposure. His body will not be found.\n\n2:18 AM\n\nThe lights on the Titanic go out, plunging the ship into darkness.\n\nAs the Titanic's bow continues to sink, the stern rises higher out of the water, placing great strain on the midsection, and the ship breaks in two between the third and fourth funnels. Reports would later speculate that it took some six minutes for the bow section, likely traveling at approximately 30 miles (48 km) per hour, to reach the ocean bottom.\n\nThe stern momentarily settles back in the water before rising again, eventually becoming vertical. It briefly remains in that position before beginning its final plunge.\n\n2:20 AM\n\nThe stern disappears into the ocean, and the Titanic is gone.\n\nWater pressure allegedly causes the stern, which still has air inside, to implode as it sinks. The stern lands some 2,000 feet (610 meters) from the bow.\n\nHundreds of people are in the freezing water. Although there is room in most of the lifeboats, crewmen are fearful that the boats will be swamped. Several boats eventually return, but too late. A few people are pulled to safety, but most die of exposure.\n\nOver the next several hours, numerous ships try in vain to contact the Titanic. At one point, the Birma's wireless operator, believing that he has heard the liner, sends a message: “Steaming full speed to you; shall arrive you 6 in morning. Hope you are safe.”\n\n3:30 AM\n\nThe Carpathia arrives in the area, firing rockets.\n\n4:10 AM\n\nNumber 2 is the first lifeboat to reach the Carpathia. It will take several hours for the ship to pick up all the survivors.\n\nIsmay writes a message to be sent to the White Star Line's offices: “Deeply regret advise you Titanic sank this morning fifteenth after collision iceberg, resulting serious loss life; further particulars later.”\n\n8:30 AM\n\nThe Californian—which at approximately 5:30 AM learned of the Titanic's sinking—arrives. It searches the area for several hours but fails to find any survivors.\n\n8:50 AM\n\nThe Carpathia, carrying the 705 Titanic survivors, heads to New York City, where it will arrive to massive crowds on April 18."
