        "text": "Why does he keep me around if he doesn’t want a relationship? Can’t he just let me go?\n\nWhy does he keep getting in touch and stringing me along?\n\n“It’s annoying! If he doesn’t want to be in a relationship with me, then just get out of my life!”\n\nI get this question a lot and here’s the short answer…\n\nIt benefits him more to keep you around than it benefits him to let you go.\n\nPretty simple right?\n\nA guy keeps you around because unless you’re super needy, a stalker, a violent woman, or causing him and the other people in his life too much grief, it benefits him more to keep you around.\n\nIt benefits him to keep you around because for men, women are a resource.\n\nDo the quiz: how commitment friendly is my man?\n\nSee, while I was thinking about this topic, I was pondering this concept of women being a resource to men. And whilst I was thinking, I came up with the perfect term that I think will help you understand this behavior in men.\n\nThis term is “the harem effect”.\n\nPerhaps if I describe it like this, it will help you understand the basic, biological reason why a man would want to try to keep you around if he doesn’t want a relationship.\n\nPlus, here’s a video I made which answers the question: why does he keep me around if he doesn’t want a relationship?\n\nWhat on Earth is “The Harem Effect”?\n\nThe definition of harem is: a group of female animals sharing a single mate. Or the women occupying a harem; the wives (or concubines) of a polygamous man.\n\nOk, so you’re not in a polygamous relationship with a man. In fact, you may be the only woman in this man’s life.\n\nBut just think about the harem effect like this:\n\nFor many men, having at least 1 woman around is better than not having any women around.\n\nHe doesn’t have to have many girlfriends, concubines or wives around. All he needs is a minimum – key word minimum – of one girlfriend. One is better than none.\n\nIf he were to just let you go, where would the benefit be in that?\n\nIf you’re not causing him too much trouble, why let you go?\n\nCausing trouble meaning, you know, like letting loose with your anger and scratching him. Biting him, egging his car, or stalking him, his family or his cat.\n\nIf you’re not that crazy, then why would he make the decision of his own accord to let you go?\n\nIf he made the choice to get rid of you, then he’d be cutting himself off from accessing sex.\n\nHave a think about that.\n\nIf he let you go, he’d be saying ‘no’ to sex.\n\nAnd what man would want to do that, unless:\n\nThe woman was extremely low value\n\nHe felt no attraction for the woman; or\n\nPerhaps she caused him serious trouble?\n\nBy the way, it’s imperative, if you don’t want a man to string you along for all the wrong reasons, that you not only test him, but also avoid showing all the common signs of low value.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause men can see it when a woman is showing up low value, and the toxic men will prey on her and try to take from her.\n\nBut not just the toxic men, the desperate men, too. The men who may otherwise be “nice”, but are just too sex deprived or morally corrupt to see themselves do the right thing by a woman.\n\nSo, always avoid showing up low value. The tricky part is that some behaviors that seem “innocent” and normal for women can be extremely low value in the eyes of men, who have a completely different reproductive agenda to us.\n\nDid you know that there are 7 common signs that a woman is perceived as low value to all men?\n\nDo You Know What They Are & How to Avoid Them Like the Plague?\n\nCLICK here to discover the 7 common signs that a woman is perceived as low value in the eyes of men in this special report. (Why is this important? Because men and women perceive value very differently and you don’t want to be making mistakes that would cause quality men to dismiss, abandon or alienate you.)\n\nNow: let me give you the short answer to the question of why he keeps you around…\n\nWhy Does He Keep Me Around If He Doesn’t Want A Relationship?\n\nBecause for him, the idea of a “relationship” means more investment and energy.\n\nThis investment and energy wouldn’t be as much of a problem for him if there was enough emotional attraction and emotional connection in the relationship.\n\nWith these two ingredients: emotional attraction and emotional connection, you can get any man to fall in love with you, and once a man falls in love, he forms a pair bond with you.\n\nThis pair bond leads to him actually desperately wanting to commit to you – for life.\n\nWithout emotional attraction and emotional connection, he’ll just keep you around and put in the bare minimum of effort.\n\nCUE:\n\nHow To Build Emotional Connection With A Man: Game Changer.\n\nCan A Man Sleep With A Woman Without Developing Feelings? The Honest Answer.\n\nHow Do Guys Get Emotionally Attached? 5 Triggers In Men You Must Know.\n\nNow: what’s the long answer to this question of why does he keep me around if he doesn’t want a relationship?\n\nHe Wants To “Hoard” You\n\nYes, indeed. He wants to hoard you. In other words, he wants to make sure he gets access to you (to the exclusion of other men) while he still can.\n\nBetter still if he can keep you locked away in his basement and keep you all to himself (I’m so joking here. But you get the picture).\n\nOnce you have gotten a woman to open up and have sex with you, then this woman can give you a steady supply of sex for as long as you are willing to keep her around in your life.\n\nRemember that men produce plenty of sperm. Too much, in fact.\n\nSo much that it has to get out. For a young guy, ONE DAY without masturbation or “release” feels like a lifetime.\n\nThe 300 million sperm that they produce per day just builds up!\n\nSPECIAL REPORT: How to Become the World’s Most Attractive & Feminine Goddess (Even if you have no self esteem or no man has ever paid you any attention…) CLICK HERE to download it at no cost.\n\nMen’s Sperm Production Is Like THIS?!\n\nOne day, my husband gave me an interesting analogy to help me understand this peculiar phenomenon.\n\nHe once compared this purely physical need that men have for ejaculation or “release” to my need to breastfeed our sons (wait what?). Bear with me on this one!\n\nSo I’ve exclusively breastfed all 3 of our sons for up to 2 years each.\n\nAs many breastfeeding moms would know, what happens if you breastfeed your baby exclusively and on demand, is that the supply of breast milk builds up in your breasts. And it builds up often!\n\nIn fact, when you produce enough milk to feed your baby exclusively for 6 months and beyond, your breasts will sometimes become engorged and painfully hard (and oh do I remember those days).\n\nSo, let’s say your baby is napping for longer than it normally would and he or she hasn’t “removed” the built-up milk from your breasts.\n\nThis becomes very uncomfortable for a mother, causing her to need release.\n\nBy release, I mean she needs to feed her baby in order to remove milk build up and to feel better.\n\nOtherwise the feeling distracts you and overtakes your life.\n\nWhen His Sperm Builds Up, That’s When He Needs YOU\n\nDo you understand where I’m getting at with this?\n\nIt’s the same with men and sperm. The sperm builds up quickly, and if there’s a woman around to “take” or “receive” that sperm in some way, that makes him one lucky man!\n\nIf there’s only one woman around (ie: you) to receive that sperm, that’s better than none.\n\nIt’s much better than just masturbating by himself to get rid of that sperm. For a man.\n\nAgain, unless you’re abusive, violent or a stalker. In that case, the cost of having you around would outweigh the benefits of keeping you around.\n\n(Just for the record, in case anyone takes the analogy regarding breastfeeding to mean that my husband pressures me into sex, nothing could be further from the truth.)\n\nHe was just helping me understand the reality of life as a man, since this phenomenon isn’t easy for me to understand as a woman. I wanted to appreciate the reason why many men always seem “ready to go”, and such is the analogy I got. lol.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nWhy Men Pull Away & How To Stay High Value.\n\nHow to Pull Away to Make Him Want You: 5 Fail Proof Steps.\n\n6 Traits of A High Value Woman (& 3 Habits to AVOID).\n\nMen Don’t Get Attached The Same Way You Do\n\nI’ve said this before so many times. Men can have sex with the same woman for ten years, and not become attached.\n\nYes, of course they also CAN get attached after having sex with a woman for 10 years, it is possible, when you look at the hormones of love in men and women.\n\nFor example, when men and women have sex, at the point of orgasm, levels of vasopressin dramatically increase in men, and levels of oxytocin dramatically increase in women.\n\nThis CAN cause a sense of “fusion” or feeling of attachment with your lover.\n\nHowever, this happens most often for a man with a woman whom he already felt an attachment with and already intended to commit to.\n\nThe act of sex itself doesn’t cause the attachment to you.\n\nAnd for most women out there who haven’t taken it upon themselves to understand men, this would be a foreign concept. They may not believe it to be true.\n\nIf you want to make smart choices, and appeal to the high value men, the smartest thing you can do is to seek to appreciate and understand men first.\n\nUnderstanding men give you power with men, and the reason for that is that it allows you to better predict their actions, and better add value to their lives.\n\nNot to mention, you become much more apt at being on the same page as a man, which inspires their trust in you as a woman.\n\nIf you would like to go deeper and gain a world-class understanding of men so that you can connect heart to heart with any man, CLICK here to join our most popular program Understanding Men.\n\n(The promise of this course is for you discover the secrets of the masculine perspective so that you can get through to any man, connect with him heart to heart, and inspire his deepest loyalty and commitment.)\n\nMen Don’t Fall In Love Because Of THIS…\n\nSo we were talking about the fact that sex doesn’t make men attach to you.\n\nThink about this for a minute:\n\nIf all you needed to do was have sex with a man and let him orgasm in order to “get” his undying love and emotional commitment, then the world would look very different.\n\nWe’d see proportionally a lot more casual sex or one night stands leading to forever love!\n\nIf a man feeling attached to a woman through sex were always true with every woman, then wouldn’t things be super easy for women?\n\nHere’s what I mean. Wouldn’t we see lots more adulterous married men leaving their families for the secretary that they had a tryst with?\n\nWouldn’t that act of casual sex invariably cause a man and woman to feel emotionally attached, fall in love and build a future together?\n\nIt can happen. Don’t get me wrong. But I would seriously caution you against assuming it will happen.\n\nMen don’t automatically get attached or even love you because you had sex.\n\nThere’s something I want you to understand.\n\nIf you want to date and successfully find love, remember that there really is no short-cut to becoming a man’s one and only woman.\n\nThe only way to avoid being the woman that men want to keep around for convenience is to be the one and only.\n\nYou Need To Be ‘The One & Only’\n\nYou simply have to allow yourself to show up as the ‘one and only’. If you’re not the ‘one and only’, then you’re in a man’s ‘one of many’ basket.\n\nAnd if you’re in the ‘one of many’ basket (which means he doesn’t truly want to invest in you), then often, he still won’t mind keeping you around in his life. That is until his one and only comes along.\n\nRemember, a man will either invest everything in you, or invest just enough to keep you around.\n\nThe only way to get him to invest everything in you is to show up as the one and only.\n\nIf you would like to discover how to show up as the one and only, I share the 5 secrets to have him fall in love with you and beg you to be his one and only in my program “Becoming His One and Only”.\n\n(The promise of this course is for you to have your chosen man fall in love with you & beg you to be his one & only by embodying these 5 feminine secrets, even if he’s been distant, avoidant, or losing interest…)\n\nHow Men See Their ‘One Of Many’ Woman\n\nNow, I thought long and hard before sharing the next part. I didn’t want to upset anyone. After all, that’s not my intent.\n\nHowever, when we as women want answers, it’s important to receive the truthful ones. Not the sugar-coated ones.\n\nWell, that’s what I think anyway. I’d rather see inside a man’s mind and truly understand what he’s thinking.\n\nThis is how I’d personally rather get my answer to the question “why does he keep me around if he doesn’t want a relationship”.\n\nSo, I had to make a difficult decision about what I’m about to share with you. I ultimately decided to share the screenshots I’m about to share, to help you understand.\n\nI’m not condoning his aggressive tone, I’m not saying he’s right. I’m not saying every man would describe it the same way he has.\n\nI’m just saying, this is how this man describes (albeit in a song), but still very accurately, how many men do secretly see their one of many woman. (The one of many woman, the one woman they will happily keep around, but never commit to or marry.)\n\nIt’s better that we understand than remain ignorant, right?\n\nIt’s good to have a different perspective than our own, right?\n\nIf you would like to get a feel for how one man sees his ‘one of many’ woman, then stay with me. Here’s a screenshot of some lyrics from a song called “Superman” by the famous rapper/singer Eminem, which (painfully) but necessarily describes the one of many woman.\n\nAnd this one. Notice how he’s happy to keep her around and “be friends”?\n\nAgain, I’m not condoning his language or his approach. He’s notorious for violent lyrics. But he’s also popular for a reason (other than great marketing):\n\nI believe it’s because he is not censored. His lyrics are real and authentic to him.\n\nDon’t take this to mean that he’s incapable of committing. Not at all. All men secretly love to commit to the right woman.\n\nSECRETS REVEALED… Discover how you too can use this little known “Dark Feminine Art” to weed out the toxic men whilst cultivating real emotional attraction with high value high esteemed men.

Testosterone can drive down feelings of attachment.\n\nAs such, men with high baseline levels of testosterone get married less frequently, have more affairs, and divorce more often.\n\nBut regardless of a man’s baseline levels of testosterone, here’s a truth that I want you to know.\n\nIf a woman leads with sex and lust from the beginning with a man, that man will most likely compartmentalise her in his mind as a ‘one of many’ woman.\n\nIn other words, she won’t be “the one” he forms a romantic union or ‘pair bond’ with.\n\nThe woman who shows up as the one and only will be the one with whom he feels an emotional attachment for and falls in love with.\n\nHow you start off with a man really matters. If you began with sex, it may very well end with sex – and only sex, nothing more.\n\nUnfortunately as a woman, it is you and not him, who will have to pick up the pieces after forming an attachment with him.\n\nHere are 6 behaviours you should never tolerate in a man!\n\nDo the quiz: What is my attachment style?\n\nJust Because You Are Attached To Him, Doesn’t Mean He Is Attached To You\n\nMen don’t just get emotionally attached through sex the way us women would get attached.\n\nFor us, it’s very hard to let go of attachment once we’ve given our body to a man.\n\nRelated: Why Do I Get Attached So Easily? 6 EXACT Reasons & How To Stop.\n\nWe can detach, of course, and many women deal with their tendency to attach early, by never seeing a man again after having one-time sex or a one night stand.\n\n(And a lot of men are left wondering: “why did she leave after only one bang?!”)\n\nThe answer is: possibly because either she only wanted sex, or more likely she was trying to avoid the trap of emotional attachment with you!\n\nWe tend to get very emotionally involved, and fear abandonment when we attach. And, we don’t always like that feeling. Correct?\n\nHere are 6 burning signs he doesn’t want a relationship with you.\n\nIt’s Not As Easy For Women To “Detach”\n\nIt isn’t always that easy for a woman to detach.\n\nIn fact, if you want to “even the playing field” with men and not get too attached, then promise yourself this now. Never have sex with men unless they are emotionally attached or emotionally committed to you.\n\nNever. (That’s if you want to even the playing field between yourself and men).\n\nAnd especially when you haven’t figured out what he actually wants from you yet!\n\nBy the way, there’s a huge cost for women who engage in casual sex. Learn about the secret cost of casual sex for women here.\n\nBecause here’s the truth: you can’t expect men to attach to you just because he’s been having sex with you for 10 years, 10 months or even 10 weeks.\n\nSo, never confuse him keeping you around with him loving you.\n\nEspecially never confuse him keeping you around with the idea that he might be ‘in love’ with you.\n\n(And I really do mean in love, not infatuated with you. A man being infatuated with you is really not worth much to you. Other than an ego boost.)\n\nIf a man is in love with you, romantically attached and forming a genuine pair bond with you, you will know. The man will pine for you and miss you badly.\n\nYou would have hijacked his brain, he won’t be able to stop thinking about you, and he won’t stop giving off signs that he is falling in love.\n\nIt Benefits Women To Say Goodbye To A Man Who Isn’t Committing\n\nAs a woman yourself, it benefits you to say goodbye to a man who isn’t committing to you. Because the more you invest in him emotionally and/or have sex with him, the more likely it is that you will get emotionally attached to him.\n\nIt will only get harder for you to leave him. You may try to leave, but his attempts to pull you back will often succeed (because you’re already attached).\n\nPlus, always remember this. If you’re attached to a man already, regardless of whether he is ‘the one’ or not, it will be harder for you to find and keep a new, better man.\n\nSee, the more emotionally attached you become to a non-committal man, the bigger the costs you incur in your emotional, mental and sexual health.\n\nIt does not work this way with men.\n\nHere are 10 Signs of A Commitment Phobic Man.\n\nAgain: they can keep having sex with you and not have any feelings involved.\n\nBottom line is: if he never became emotionally attached to you, the chances of him doing so now, depend largely on your ability to create an emotional bond with him.\n\nIt’s harder to create that emotional bond after leading with sex.\n\nHowever, it is possible. If you would like to learn how, I suggest checking out “Becoming His One & Only”.\n\nSex Does Not = LOVE For Men\n\nYou may be wondering why it is harder to forge an emotional bond with a man after you had a largely sexual relationship with him? It is because men separate sex from love.\n\nSex does not = love.\n\nLove does not = sex.\n\nThe following insight is taken from a popular article by D.Shen on How to Understand Men: 5 Things Every Woman Ought to Know About Men:\n\nOne of the biggest and most important insights you need to understand is that for a man, love and sex are two different and separate processes.\n\nIf you were to examine a feminine woman’s brain through an MRI scan, you’d see that the parts of her brain that light up for sex are quite similar to the parts of her brain that light up for love.\n\nThere’s a big overlap.\n\nWhereas for most masculine men, the overlap is very small. In other words, the part of his brain that lights up when thinking about sex is very different to the parts of his brain thinking about love.\n\nThink about this. If you (yes you), were so detached from the emotional side of sex, (and all you needed was a “release”), then…wouldn’t sex not mean a whole lot to you, either?\n\nWalk Away When He’s Just Keeping You Around Without Commitment\n\nHere’s my recommendation to you: if a man is just keeping you around without wanting to commit to you at all, then ask yourself: “CAN I afford that lost time?”\n\n…And ask yourself: “is it worth my effort to build that emotional bond with him?”\n\nOnly you can answer that question.\n\nIf you believe it is worth the effort, great. You put that effort in.\n\nBut you should be sure, and you should know that the focus has to be on emotional connection and not the sexual relationship that you have with him.\n\nAnd if it turns out that it’s not worth it to try to forge that emotional bond with him, remember that you must grieve the loss of this man (who was stringing you along).\n\nDon’t allow the half-in-half-out situation to continue any longer. This is for your emotional and mental health.\n\nAnd once you’ve grieved, you can then start off strong with a new man and form an emotional attachment with him from the beginning!\n\nGood luck!\n\nAnd by the way, would you like to know the ONE specific emotional hot button within every single man in this world that inspires him to WANT to commit to one woman, take care of her and worship her for life?
