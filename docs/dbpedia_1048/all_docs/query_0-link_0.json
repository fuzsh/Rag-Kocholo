        "text": "1.\n\nRandom - Introduction 01:39\n\n[Random] Yo, let me tell you 'bout this dream I had I woke up in some weird scientist's lab Standin next to a dude in a white coat It had X. Light on his pocket protector Had this big blue helmet on And a big cannon in place of my right arm He said, 'Mega Ran, what you don't remember me? The power charge must have took some of your memory We gotta go, Wily's got another plan' Man who are you, what happened to my right hand? The Doc said, 'I got no time to explain This isn't a joke, no time for the games' Yo, this all remind me of a game I played Back when I was a young boy, like 5th grade Step outside and the sky's all pink Explosions everywhere make it hard to think 'Thought I could trust Wily, but I shoulda known' Then over the horizon, I spot a big dome The Doc said, 'That's it, yeah right there!' That's what? 'Dr. Wily's secret lair!' 'He's got 8 bosses you gotta beat first' 'And when you find Wily, make him eat dirt~!' 'I brought a few weapons for your protection' And this is the beginning of the Mega Ran legend But I got a question (And this is the beginning of the Mega Ran legend) What am I doing here? Who are you? What do you want me to do? This is weird man {Still seems more like a cheap B movie to me!}\n\n2.\n\nShadowman 03:19\n\n[Random] Aiyyo we get it done, I'm in and out like a hit & run Chances of me fallin off slim and none Wanna take my mic you better get a gun Don't be fooled; he might seem tough but he only a cream puff, spittin what he dreamed up And on the real I got better unreleased stuff I can't hear him, Fermat's last theorem Ran's the future and y'all so last year with it I creep through the dirt with verses like serpents Worthless jerks get earthed beneath surface Shattered dreams'll defeat ya purpose Y'all don't need a proof of purchase - you got it~! Audible narcotics when the R drop it Attackin all topics, how you gon' stop it? Off top, Big Ran the boss, I cost Y'all doodoo with the flow boy - \"ready you are not\" {*scratching: \"give 'em that dopeness\", \"the flow is ferocious\"*} {*\"Dirty job but it must be done\"*} [Random] Yo, let me guess, you the next one to test Soundin all rapademic yeah it's just another gimmick, 'fess Fans be like \"OOOH!\" Easily they get impressed By any whack rapper receivin a bit of press I was raised by the culture, tell it sick like the Conastoga, yo' time is over Circle my prey like some kind of vulture You're not a soldier, grounded like Folger's This is real life, not a simulation I'm so bored, I guess I should work for immigration Cause Del said you need to know your limitations 14 years later you're still imitations! We innovatin, RAHM Nation Not waitin for y'all cats validation We - fully accredited, experts in settin it Don't wanna be repetitive but y'all ain't gettin it~! {*scratching: \"give 'em that dopeness\", \"RAHM Nation if you don't know\"*} {*scratching: \"give 'em that dopeness\", \"the flow is ferocious\"*} {*\"Dirty job but it must be done\"*} [Random] It's after 12, so you know the beast is out Lovelies give a Lil' Dap when I \"Speak My Clout\" Pause, cause you don't know Random beats about I'm official, blow in the cartridge 'til it whistle Old school like Voltron when it's go time I hold mine without an industry co-sign WHAT YOU DO? Write, produce, the whole nine Never left, been in the building the whole time Sure bet like LT on the goal line Foamin at the mouth cause they know what I'm about No denyin, cold as I am Leave your man with his girl's shoulders cryin Like laundry rooms when clothes is dryin You padussy rookie - WHOOPSIE! You be the next dude, slingin that the label ain't push me Got promoters linin up to book me, it's Mega Ran - what?! {*scratching: \"give 'em that dopeness\", \"RAHM Nation if you don't know\"*} {*scratching: \"give 'em that dopeness\", \"the flow is ferocious\"*} {*\"Dirty job but it must be done\"*} {Now the real fun starts!}\n\n3.\n\nBubbleman 02:44\n\n[Random] Yo... yo we make it bubble man, I don't want no trouble man I'm just here to flow and make it rock like a Knicks fan Heard you sold a couple grand? Dawg I'm still strugglin Guess I got a couple fans, got a lot of love for them So I gotta make it dope for them, brothers just don't understand That's the life of brother Ran, microphone in one hand My cock's on the other hand, tellin me to love him man But the fans wanna jam, hooked up some Mega Man But we ain't a cover band, 80's babies understand It's part of the culture fam, I ain't gon' insult ya man Bad mamma jam in Cazal shades - I love it man Like we made a covenant, but don't tell the government Capcom pseudo-ROM probably couldn't cover it Free 99 - hope the whole world discover it You ain't sellin it? Nah it's for the hell of it Let the world know, Mega Ran's still relevant WHAT?~! [Random] My place in history's solidified I'm like the first stone settin off genocide And rappers won't come to my face Cause I'm downright chillin like starin in a killer's eyes Really I'm, the type to get at you In a battle you a cat who switch sides like Storm Shadow We gon' catch you, here go a free tip From the best kept secret you'll never see slip Like a LSD trip, when I rock frequent Top secret, unorthodox sequence With this mic piece, I slice beats You might know cats that rap but trust, they ain't like me Pride of Oak Lane's alive as propane My lines is cocaine the guy's a pro mayne Hate touchers, spittin about rubbish Who don't love it, man you trippin without luggage Name a rapper that can get with me So I can send him a Random CD so he can disagree Give him the call, I gave you my all Play your position, big Ran stayed on the ball, yeah Can we make it bubb...

That's the future right there Mode 7, scaling and rotation and all that good stuff Peep this yo She had jet black hair, height five seven Caramel complected, body like heaven I see her every Sunday goin to church But she don't see me, cause I be too busy with work But I watch her ignore those ignorant brothers that only wanna get under covers, she was classy One day, we was face to face But I choked (UGH) and let shorty walk right past me I wasn't even programmed to be smitten So I can't logically explain the feeling I'm gettin But I know we can never be (why?) My career is too dangerous to consider any longevity She probably like brothers of a different breed But I know I can give her the affection she needs But if she ever knew the truth about Ran I don't think she'd ever understand, so I ain't got a chance [Chorus: Random] Cause I'm just a robot, baby I know not, what I'ma do (I don't know what I'ma do) Cause darling is so hot, and I just want to, be with you (I got to be wit'chu) But I'm just a robot and baby I know not what I'ma do (I don't know what I'ma do) Cause darling is so hot, and I just want to, be with you (So hot... I want to be wit'chu) [Random] I found out Kalinka was her name Had to get reprogrammed to get her off the brain Cause I was goin to war in 3 weeks Dr. Wily's 8 new robots to defeat I tried to focus, but everything was hopeless She blew up my spot like Bombman's explosives And I was on my way to Dr. Light's I stopped at the light, and who was at my right? Kalinka, with a big smile on her face She looked and said \"Don't I know you from someplace?\" I said yeah kinda sorta you Dr. Cossack's daughter Asked her to pull over she said \"I don't think I oughta!\" Tried not to come off like a stalker But I ain't never been too much of a smooth talker I said from the moment I met you, I felt you But it's a lot of things I just can't tell you [Chorus] [Random] A couple weeks passed and we kickin it exclusively Can't seem to put a finger on what she do to me I talk to the Doc, he got no idea He didn't give me a heart so I wouldn't have fear But he told me I should probably stop seein her 'You leavin in three days, you know you can't be with her' I know, I need to concentrate on the mission 'Too many irons in the fire burn down the kitchen' I know, I gotta go, got a date at 7:30 And if you late you timely, on time is early Vrrrrooom, I sped off to meet her at the theatre Said she'd be out front, but I don't see her So I went back to my car to sit and chill Noticed a pink note, hangin on the windshield It said \"I love you but you keep too many secrets That ain't the kind of guy I wanna be with\" [Outro] Damn Seems like our hero is in a bit of a jam Will Mega Ran and Kalinka be together? Does Dr. Light, sense evil within Kalinka? Or is he just hating? Will Mega Ran be ready, for Dr. Wily's latest assault? Stay tuned Mega fans For the next exciting episode of...

She made it clear I was gon' have to choose her, or my career But nah, I can't go out like that I'm down but not out man I gots to fight back So now I gotta get to her crib But one problem - she never told me where she lived And Dr. Light's like 'It's probably for the best' Wily's on the attack, I don't need mo' stress I hate when he's right, but he always is Ever since I was a little Mega Kid Truth is, I need to drop it like a hot potato The briefin is tonight he need to give me lots of data He said he's working on a special project with Dr. Cossack - wait a minute, got it! {*snaps finger*} It's only logic, if I'm cool with Cossack I can get him convincin Kalinka that I'm honest I met him, and he seemed real cordial He told me - \"My daughter's not the best person for you!\" I said I'm sorry that you feel that way Maybe I can get a chance to convince you someday The meeting's over, so everybody left All the personnel files sittin on the desk Should be under arrest for what I did next I snuck in his file and I found his address Then went to the rest, scoped out the premises Low-level security, should be able to enter it And I'm in it in less than five minutes Can't believe I'm doin this but I can't let him ruin this! I thought of Plan B on the fly She can tell him that I'm gone and see me on the side But that's when I had to decide I was gon' be straight up, I had nothin to hide And I was leavin - but then I found pictures of us And transcripts detailin everything we discussed Thought we was down, thought we had trust I can't believe it - this chick set me up! {Sorry, but I did warn you! *echoes*} {I hate to say I told you so but...
