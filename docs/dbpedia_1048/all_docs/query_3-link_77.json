        "text": "This time signature chart shows the most common regular time signatures.\n\nA regular time signature is one which represents 2, 3 or 4 main beats per bar.\n\nDuple time means 2 main beats per bar\n\nTriple time means 3 main beats per bar\n\nQuadruple time means 4 main beats per bar\n\nAny time signatures which do not have 2, 3 or 4 main beats per bar are classed as irregular. They are not shown in this time signature chart.\n\nThe time signature chart also shows you which are simple and compound time signatures.\n\nSimple time signatures have a main beat which divides into two 1st level sub-beats. The top number is 2, 3 or 4.\n\nCompound time signatures have a main beat which divides into three 1st level sub-beats. The top number is 6 (duple), 9 (triple) or 12 (quadruple).\n\nIn both simple and compound time, 2nd level sub-beats always subdivide by two (never by three).\n\nYou will probably come across other time signatures which are not on this chart. In Bach’s first book of 48 Preludes and Fugues, for example, you can find the time signatures 12/16 and 24/16. Time signatures with a lower number 16 are rare, but do crop up from time to time. However, the chart shows you the most common regular time signatures which you are likely to find today.\n\nHow Time Signatures Work\n\nTime signatures give you information about the “main beat” in a piece of music, and how that beat is divided up.\n\nMain Beats\n\nMost music has 2, 3 or 4 “main beats” per bar. This is the pulse you would tap your foot or clap to. Music with 2, 3 or 4 pulses per bar is called “regular“.\n\nSome music written since the turn of the 20th century has an “irregular” main beat, meaning that there are not 2, 3 or 4 main beats per bar, but some other number. Common irregular pulses are 5 or 7 main beats per bar. (e.gs in simple time).\n\nMusic with 2 main beats per bar is in “duple” time. Three beats per bar=”triple” time, and 4 beats=”quadruple” time.\n\nSubdivided Beats & Regular Patterns\n\nEach of the main beats can be split into smaller note values. This is called a “subdivision”.\n\nThere are only two ways to split a main beat – into two halves, or into three thirds.\n\nThis gives us six possible regular patterns for time signatures.\n\nSimple and Compound Time\n\nWhen the main beat is divided up into two, it is “simple time“. The top number of the time signature is 2, 3 or 4, depending on how many main beats per bar there are.\n\nWhen it subdivides into three, it is “compound time“. The top number of the time signature is 6 (2 beats), 9 (3 beats) or 12 (4 beats).\n\nTypes of Main Beat\n\nThe reason why we have more than 6 regular time signatures is because we can use different lengths of note for the main beat.\n\nThe note used for the main beat is most often the quaver, crotchet or minim, the dotted crotchet or the dotted minim.\n\nAn undotted main beat always subdivides into two (simple time), but a dotted main beat always subdivides into three (compound time).\n\nThe lower number of the time signature shows you what type of beat to count. 2=minim, 4=crotchet or dotted minim, 8=quaver or dotted crotchet and 16=semiquaver.\n\nFurther Subdivisions\n\nEach subdivision can, of course, be divided up again into even smaller notes. All further sub-divisions are into two, whatever the time signature. (If you want to subdivide into three, you need a triplet.\n\nIrregular Time\n\nIrregular time signatures are always simple (the main beat divides into two).\n\nThe top number will tell you how many main beats there are per bar, and the bottom number tells you what type of beat.\n\nE.g. 5/8 is five quavers per bar, or 11/16 is eleven semiquavers.\n\nAural Differences\n\nTo our ears, it is very difficult to tell the difference between these time signatures with the same basic pattern. Generally though, when the main beat is a quaver, the tempo is quick, and when it is a minim the tempo is slow.\n\nNotation Differences\n\nIt is easy to tell the difference between time signatures with different basic patterns, because the notes in the bar will be grouped according to their pattern.\n\nWhen there are two main beats per bar, the notes are grouped into two equal-sized blocks, three beats per bar = three blocks and so on.\n\nNotes are grouped with the use of a) note values which fall on the beat (not off it), b) beaming and c) ties.\n\nTry to draw blocks around each beat of the bar.\n\nEach block must be the same size.\n\nNotes which are the main beat, have to fall at the start of the block.\n\nTies are used when a note begins in one block but ends in another.\n\nBeams don’t cross blocks.\n\nBeams are not broken within blocks.\n\nTriplets & Duplets\n\nSometimes we will want to split a main beat into three in a simple time, instead of the usual two. Or in a compound time, we might want to split the beat into two instead of three.\n\nWhen the main beat is divided into a number which is not the one expected, we draw a bracket over the affected notes and write a number to show the subdivision we want. (If the notes are already joined with a beam, you don’t need a bracket as well).\n\nFor example in simple time the main beat can be subdivided into three with a bracket and a three, called a “triplet“. In compound time, we can write a two, which makes a “duplet“.\n\nWatch out- a triplet doesn’t always have three notes in it! A crotchet plus a quaver can make a triplet (because added together they make up the same as 3 quavers).\n\nThe Anacrusis"
