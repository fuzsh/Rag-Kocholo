        "text": "My 2-year-old son recently woke up from his nap with a remarkably specific request. He wanted to listen to “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” but not just any version of “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” It had to be the version from “CoComelon,” a wildly popular YouTube channel turned Netflix sensation that has a hypnotizing effect on children with its bright colors and repetitive nursery rhymes and songs.\n\nNow, I don’t honor my son’s every request, but asking for a nursery rhyme seemed simple enough. But as we snuggled under a blanket on the couch, I came to an unfortunate realization: I had absolutely no idea what episode featured “Mary Had a Little Lamb.”\n\nOn Netflix, this show is eight seasons long — 20 episodes of nursery rhymes that each run anywhere from 50 minutes to an hour. And because it started as standalone videos on YouTube, there’s not much in the way of a storyline. This is clearly not a problem for kids: On Netflix, “CoComelon” racked up 601 million hours of viewing time during just the first half of 2023 alone, Business Insider reported.\n\nBut it means that parents, while likely grateful to have some downtime as their toddlers enter “CoComelon” land, have no idea what separates one episode from the next. The show might as well be playing the same song for 20 hours straight.\n\nTo my son, though, it’s not all the same. He wanted “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” and with his agitation ever so gradually intensifying, I did a not-so-quick search on my phone to track down the season and episode that holds this beloved song.\n\nI scrolled and scrolled, and my toddler pleaded and pleaded, for “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” After several minutes, I came to an unsettling conclusion: The internet does not, in fact, have all the answers.\n\nSensing a meltdown on the horizon, I thought on my feet and remembered something else that was really bright and colorful and could capture my son’s attention: fruit snacks.\n\nCrisis averted.\n\nBut I don’t expect this to work every time. I’m running out of distractions, and when that dreaded day comes, I want to be prepared.\n\nSo I’ve done something big. The other night, after my son settled down for bed, I took it upon myself to go through the entire “CoComelon” series on Netflix and document every single song in every single episode. Consider this my magnum opus.\n\nBased on comments I saw as I searched for “Mary Had a Little Lamb” that fateful afternoon, I don’t think I’m alone: “CoComelon”-loving toddlers on the brink of a meltdown are everywhere.\n\nBut don’t be mistaken: This was not an altruistic endeavor on my part. If I’m the only person who benefits from this, it will have been 100% worth it.\n\nThe complete Netflix ‘CoComelon’ song list by episode\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1: ‘CoComelon Sing-Alongs: Playdate with
