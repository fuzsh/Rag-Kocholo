        "text": "On Christmas Eve 1944, San Francisco Ballet launched a national holiday tradition with the American premiere of Nutcracker—the first complete version ever staged in the United States. This year, Tomasson’s larger-than-life production which premiered in 2004 celebrates its 20th anniversary.\n\nTomasson’s Nutcracker is set in 1915 San Francisco during the Panama Pacific International Exhibition, a time when the City celebrated a new age of technology and international collaboration, much like the San Francisco of today.\n\nJoin us as the lights dim, music soars, snowflakes swirl, flowers dance, and a child dreams about a whole new world in a Nutcracker as unique as it is magical."
