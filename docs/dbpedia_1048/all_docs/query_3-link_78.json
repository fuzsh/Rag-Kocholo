        "text": "The summer hits reveal some complicated vibes\n\nNow that we're in the dog days of summer, host Brittany Luse wants to know - do we have a song of the summer this year? According to NPR Music reporter Sidney Madden and NPR Music host, writer and editor Stephen Thompson, there isn't one song - but many songs.\n\nThe summer hits reveal some complicated vibes\n\nListen · 21:58 21:58\n\nCode Switch: Do we need to stop using the word \"felon\"?\n\nEver since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, things changed. Her campaign almost immediately started framing the election as: Harris, the former prosecutor - vs. Trump the felon. And that word - \"felon\" - is one that our friends over at NPR's Code Switch have been thinking a lot about since former President Trump was convicted of 34 counts back in May. In this episode, Code Switch co-hosts B.A. Parker and Gene Demby chop it up with the comedian Arif Shahid, who performs under the name Felonious Munk, to talk about what it means for him to carry this reference to his felony conviction so publicly. Then, Gene talks to Josie Duffy-Rice, a writer who focuses on the criminal justice system, to look at the ways \"felon\" sticks to people long after their sentences end.\n\nCode Switch: Do we need to stop using the word \"felon\"?\n\nListen · 35:42 35:42\n\nThe misunderstood humor of political memes\n\nFrom the attempted assassination of former President Trump, to President Biden dropping out of the election, and VP Kamala Harris stepping up... The news these past few weeks has been buck wild. And the energy online is similarly unhinged. But what do most people get wrong when they try to interpret the latest explosion of political memes? And what do these posts actually say about how people are processing major events? And are there consequences to just posting through it? Host Brittany Luse is joined by Tatum Hunter, consumer tech reporter at The Washington Post, and Kyle Chayka, staff writer at The New Yorker, to discuss what meaning could possibly be gleaned from the meme madness.\n\nThe misunderstood humor of political memes\n\nListen · 17:59 17:59\n\nQuality chills and feel good content on Dropout\n\nIt seems like there are countless streamers these days – there's Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, Max, Peacock, Roku, just to name a few. Still, success and profit remain elusive to even some of the biggest in the biz. However there is one smaller streamer that seems to have found a path to prosperity: Dropout. In this encore episode, IBAM host Brittany Luse sat down with Dropout CEO Sam Reich earlier this year to find out how his company is forging a path to success in a successful market, all while revamping the gameshow format. The pair also play a little gameshow game.\n\nQuality chills and feel good content on Dropout\n\nListen · 29:33 29:33\n\nOlympic hurdles for women athletes; plus, big trucks and big questions\n\nThis is the first year the Olympics have gender parity between men's and women's teams - but does it mean gender equity? ESPN writer Katie Barnes and Rose Eveleth, host of NPR and CBC's Tested, join Brittany to discuss the barriers that women athletes still face - from men-only categories to women-only sex testing.\n\nOlympic hurdles for women athletes; plus, big trucks and big questions\n\nListen · 32:31 32:31\n\n'Cats: The Jellicle Ball' gets 10s across the board\n\nIn the latest revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, there are no singing cats. The actors have basically ditched the furry ears and velvet tails and reimagined the characters as competitors in the ballroom scene, vying for trophies and a new chance at life. This week, host Brittany Luse talks to Cats: The Jellicle Ball star Chasity Moore and co-director Zhailon Levingston about ballroom, spectacles and memories.\n\n'Cats: The Jellicle Ball' gets 10s across the board\n\nListen · 21:30 21:30\n\nThe rise of the AR-15; plus, why do comedians play so many cops?\n\nLast Saturday, former president Donald Trump was speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania when a gunman shot at him – killing one spectator and clipping Trump in the ear. The response? Outrage, condemnations, and prayers on all sides... but there's been less chatter about the gun that shot at him. And this gun has a lot of symbolism: The AR-15. Host Brittany Luse is joined by The Wall Street Journal's Zusha Elinson, co-author of the book American Gun, and Jennifer Mascia, senior news writer and founding staffer at The Trace, a nonpartisan nonprofit newsroom that covers guns. Together, they discuss how the AR-15 style rifle went from an outcast in the gun world to the one of the biggest pro-gun symbols and why that actually reflects bigger cultural shifts.\n\nThe rise of the AR-15; plus, why do comedians play so many cops?\n\nListen · 34:46 34:46\n\nSimmering over summer books\n\nWe're at the peak of summer, which means sunny days on the grass with a good book! Bestselling authors Tia Williams and Jean Chen Ho join host Brittany Luse to give their recommendations for great summer reads. They also offer some armchair theories on why we love a gossipy summer novel.\n\nSimmering over summer books\n\nListen · 21:13 21:13\n\n'Hawk tuah,' the Zynternet, & the bro-vote; plus, cowboys are having a moment\n\nWhat did the raunchy joke say to the podcast host? That we might need to pay attention to the \"zynternet.\" Host Brittany Luse is joined by Slate's Luke Winkie and sex and culture writer Magdalene Taylor to understand why the \"hawk tuah\" phenomenon is emblematic of a corner of the internet that's both culturally and politically powerful.\n\n'Hawk tuah,' the Zynternet, & the bro-vote; plus, cowboys are having a moment\n\nListen · 38:21 38:21\n\nMavis Staples on Prince, MLK and a life onstage\n\nThis week, the legendary singer and civil rights figure Mavis Staples is turning 85 and there's no sign of her slowing down: She released a new song, \"Worthy,\" and a children's book, Bridges Instead of Walls: The Story of Mavis Staples.\n\nMavis Staples on Prince, MLK and a life onstage\n\nListen · 23:21 23:21"
