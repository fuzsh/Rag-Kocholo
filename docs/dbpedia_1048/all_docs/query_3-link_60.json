A detailed trail map can be purchased at the park office.\n\nMountain biking and horseback riding are very popular at Seneca Creek, and the Schaeffer Farm Trails are considered a favorite place to ride. The Maryland Park Service does not rent horses or bicycles, and only provides the trails as a means of recreation.\n\nSeneca Creek State Park Trail Maps\n\nNew maps of the trails at Seneca Creek State Park can be downloaded for free from this website. Please make sure to read the printing instructions and information for how to download the file to cell phones. The maps are in a PDF format that requires Adobe Reader. To get the free Adobe Reader go to Adobe.com.\n\nSeneca Creek State Park Trail Map of Clopper Lake\n\nSeneca Creek State Park Trail Map of all areas\n\nView the instructions for printing and downloading the Seneca Creek State Park Trail Maps\n\nClopper Lake Trail System\n\nThe Clopper Day-Use Area offers over a dozen miles of trails, wrapping around the lake, extending into park upland areas, and exploring the namesake creek.\n\nLake Shore Trail\n\nBlue blaze\n\n3.7 miles - moderate\n\nEncircling the lake, this scenic trail offers continuous views across water from woodlands or open field settings. Several streams are bridged and shore locations offer good opportunities for wildlife observations of waterfowl, herons, fish and turtles, as well as access to fishing.\n\nThe Woodlands (Clopper Lake)\n\nNo blaze\n\n0.15 miles - easier\n\nA short self-guided trail located adjacent to the Park Office interprets life on the “The Woodlands,” the former plantation home of the Clopper Family.\n\nOld Pond Trail (Clopper Lake)\n\nRed blaze\n\n0.25 miles - moderate\n\nBeginning near the Park Office, a short set of steps leads hikers to the Old Pond Trail. After crossing a small bridge, hikers can choose to walk left toward the park roads or right to continue through a marshy, wooded area and across a small creek. Connecting to the Great Seneca Trail from the Old Pond Trail can extend the hike.\n\nGreat Seneca Trail\n\nOrange blaze\n\n1.2 miles - moderate\n\nFrom the parking lot near the park office, follow the Great Seneca Trail along Great Seneca Creek for a relaxing walk to hear the babbling water. The trail wanders through fields and woods, eventually leading to Clopper Lake and Long Draught Creek.\n\nLong Draught Trail\n\nYellow blaze\n\n1 mile - moderate\n\nAfter parking at Kingfisher Overlook, follow the Long Draught Trail along Long Draught Creek to observe signs of beaver activity. The trail continues to a bridge crossing, where hikers have the option of continuing onto the Greenway Trail, the Mink Hollow Trail, or hiking to the Wetland area for more wildlife observation.\n\nMink Hollow Trail\n\nWhite blaze\n\n1.5 miles - moderate\n\nThe Mink Hollow Trail is best accessed by parking at Quail Ridge. The trail skirts the edge of the Quail Ridge parking lot just to the right of the entrance to the Bobwhite Picnic Pavilion. The trail, designed to connect with the Lake Shore and the Long Draught Trails, wanders through woods to a steep descent before arriving at a boardwalk along the marshy area of Long Draught Creek.\n\nSchaeffer Farm Trail System\n\nSchaeffer Farm is the hub of a trail system unique in Maryland. The trails at Seneca Creek State Park provide the backbone of a network that extends into most of the upcounty area. Configured in a series of loops, you can enjoy as few as four miles or go for an all-day adventure. It is possible to do a trail loop stretching 60 miles or more when you leave the trailhead. Linking the Seneca, Muddy Branch, and Potomac watersheds, visitors can journey from Schaeffer to Damascus to the Potomac and back. One of these larger loops has been recognized by the International Mountain Bicycling Association as one of the best and most important routes in the country.\n\nWhite Loop (Schaeffer Farm)\n\nWhite blaze\n\n3.3 miles - easier to moderate\n\nThe White Loop is the gateway trail to Schaeffer Farm; all the other area trails branch off of it. Fun in either direction, it is a flowing, rolling singletrack through forest and along farm field edges. There are numerous opportunities to branch off and explore deeper into Schaeffer. At the far side of the loop there is a spur trail leading to Black Rock Mill and the Seneca Ridge and Seneca Greenway Trails.\n\nLonger Hiking/Biking/Equestrian Trails\n\nSeneca Greenway\n\nBlue blaze\n\n16.5 miles - moderate\n\nSpanning from the C&O Canal and the Potomac River to MD-355, the Greenway provides the full panorama of Seneca Creek State Park. Due to its alignment in the floodplains of the creek, much of the Greenway is for foot-traffic only. Exceptions include the segments from Black Rock Mill to MD-28 (for hiking, biking and horses) and MD-28 to Berryville Road (for hiking and horses). The trail design allows for beautiful photography of the flowing creek waters as well as abundant wildlife observation.\n\nSeneca Ridge Trail\n\nOrange blaze\n\n5.8 miles - moderate\n\nLocated in the upland areas on the south bank of Seneca Creek, the Seneca Ridge Trail provides a shared-use connection between Clopper Lake and Schaeffer Farm. Those willing to venture farther from the trailhead are rewarded by great unsullied vistas to Seneca Creek. So much fun for running and bicycling, this trail greatly increased interest in travelling-by-trail between Clopper and Schaeffer.\n\nSeneca Bluffs Trail\n\nYellow blaze\n\n7.5 miles - moderate\n\nSibling to the Seneca Ridge, the Bluffs Trail creates a shared use link between Black Rock Mill, MD-28, Poole’s General Store, and the C&O Canal at Riley’s Lock. True to its name, much of the trail hugs the rim of the river valley providing stunning views across Seneca Creek as it approaches the Potomac.​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​​\n\n​The Clopper Day-Use Area is home to one of the best disc golf courses in the Mid-Atlantic. With 32 acres and 27 holes (three nine-hole circuits) the Seneca course provides a popular pastime for families and groups. Each circuit spans a range of forested and open land.\n\nThe three courses start from a central location close to parking. Dual tees and multiple pin placements encourage new players to join more experienced friends and family. Plenty of benches around the course invite breaks to share tips.\n\nAbout the Course:\n\nWhen you visit Seneca Creek State Park, do you ever wonder about what’s on that part on the other side of Great Seneca Highway – well, it’s a world class disc golf course. Now you’re wondering what disc golf is. It’s a lot of things. It’s a way to spend time enjoying the outdoors. It’s a way of getting some exercise. It is an inexpensive cousin to ball golf. All it requires to play is a disc and a course and the course is already provided. While starting with the Frisbee you are used to throwing is great, as you play more, you will appreciate that discs that are custom designed for the sport make it easier. Such discs are for sale right in the park office. There are also used discs for sale even cheaper. Disc Golf is a fast growing sport that even has a professional tour and a professional organization, PDGA, which is a great place to get more information about the sport. The play is very much like ball golf except for throwing a disc instead of hitting a ball with a club. There are cement tee pads to throw from at the start of each hole and a basket to throw the disc into rather than a small hole in the ground. If you can throw a Frisbee, you can play disc golf.\n\nThe course at Seneca Creek State Park was installed by volunteers on a part of the park set aside for it. Some say it is the best of the more than 30& disc golf courses in Maryland. No one would deny it is one of the top few. It consists of three nine-hole loops to make it easy to play more or less as you are interested. There are short and long tee pads and even novice tee pads, so you can adjust the difficulty of your round. Each hole has multiple basket locations that get changed every few weeks to increase the novelty.\n\nThe course is maintained in conjunction with the park by the Cedar Farm Disc Golf Club a volunteer organization that works as a liaison between the park and the disc golf community. The club also runs a number of tournaments starting in January with an Ice Bowl, a fundraiser for the Capital Area Food Bank, and including the longest running professional tournament in the state, the Seneca Creek Soiree, which attracts the premier disc golfers in the mid-Atlantic region.\n\nWe hope to see you out there some time and when you are and need some guidance, please ask. Chances are you’ll be asking one of the many regular players out there who are more than happy to share their joy of the sport they love.\n\nA Disc Golf map is available for download\n\nA Disc Golf scorecard is available for download\n\n​​​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​The Seneca Creek valley provides numerous opportunities to explore Montgomery County history.\n\nWoodlands Estate\n\nLocated at the Park Office and Historic Area at 11950 Clopper Road, a self-guided interpretive path reveals the history of the Clopper Family and their estate home “Woodlands.” Francis Cassatt Clopper (a distant relative of the painter Mary Cassatt) was a prosperous merchant who moved to Montgomery County in 1812 and established a huge plantation farm off Clopper Road. Explore the archeological remains of the now-vanished plantation house and its outbuildings, and learn about daily life on a farm across four generations, from before the Civil War up to the middle 1950s.\n\nGrusendorf Log House​\n\n​Also located near the Park Office is Grusendorf Log House, the oldest surviving building from the original Germantown, Maryland. Built by a German-American carpenter named Jakob Snyder in 1855, this one-room log cabin once stood near what is now the corner of Clopper Road and Great Seneca Highway. When the land on which the cabin stood was redeveloped in the 1980s, the historic home was relocated to Seneca Creek State Park. Park volunteers present interpretive programs and offer interior tours periodically on weekends from spring through fall. Check the monthly program calendar for open house dates and times.​\n\nSchwartz Peony Garden\n\nThe Schwartz Peony Garden is a living reminder of one of the great commercial horticulture operations in Montgomery County. Now located in Seneca Creek State Park’s Day Use area, the garden was originally planted at Summit Avenue in downtown Gaithersburg.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1924 a prosperous real estate broker and flower fancier, Mr. Edwin P. Schwartz, collected heirloom peonies from dealers in Holland, France, England and Germany as well as the United States. Mr Schwartz’s mansion home, which once overlooked the garden, is now Gaithersburg City Hall. By the 1920s the family had become prominent peony root stock dealers, publishing a catalog offering hundreds of different varieties for order by mail. In the 1940s the family moved their commercial garden operations to five acres in what is now Seneca Creek State Park.\n\nThousands of individual peony plants in scores of varieties still bloom in the park every May and June. Visit the display garden and walk the open fields to enjoy the spectacular flowers in all their colors and varieties.​\n\nBlack Rock Mill​\n\nBlack Rock Mill sits along Great Seneca Creek adjacent to Black Rock Road. Inside the walls of the now roofless old building are displays which tell the history of this 1815 grain-grinding mill. Featuring reinstalled gears and machinery, the displays give a cut-away view of the milling operation. Startling high water marks on the inside of the walls show the magnitude of the floods which have ravaged the Great Seneca valley from time to time over the last century.\n\nSeneca Historic District\n\nCloser to the confluence of Great Seneca Creek and the Potomac River are the Seneca Schoolhouse and Seneca Historic District, including the ruins of the Seneca Stone Mill and Quarries. Located at the end of Tschiffely Mill Road, the quarry is renowned for providing the signature red sandstone used to build the Smithsonian Castle. The nearby one-room schoolhouse, located at 16800 River Road, once served children of quarry workers and other members of the local community. Historic Medley District, Inc. now presents interpretive programs at the restored schoolhouse. Also nearby are Riley’s Lockhouse and Seneca Aqueduct of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, both preserved by the National Park Service as part of the C&O Canal National Historic Park.\n\nWaring Viaduct\n\nThe park’s Seneca Greenway foot trail offers excellent views of the 110-year-old Waring Viaduct, a three-arch stone railroad bridge that soars high above Great Seneca Creek. Built by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to replace an older steel bridge on the same site, this majestic bridge still carries trains high above the Greenway and the valley of Great Seneca Creek. Access the viaduct by walking on the Seneca Greenway north from the Park Office at 11950 Clopper Road (1 mile) or south from the MD Route 355 trailhead parking lot (2 miles). Please note: Waring Viaduct itself is private property and is in active railroad use--never walk or trespass on railroad tracks.​​​​\n\n​\n\nVolunteer Spotlight​​\n\nOn a gloomy, rainy Earth Day thirteen bright eyed, excited volunteers took the time to get out of their beds to help plant trees at Seneca Creek State Park. The park received a generous donation of tree seedlings from the Maryland Department of Transportation in order to replenish trees that were removed for construction of the Intercounty Connector. Much work has gone into removing invasive plants in the park and re-planting trees in those areas will help regenerate some of the native vegetation.\n\nThe trees were planted along the Clopper Lake shore near the boat center which has seen an increase in beaver activity, so more trees will help replenish those that fell to the beavers and help stabilize the shoreline. Volunteers dug holes, planted a mixture of River Birch, Red Oak, and Red Maple, and erected tree tubes around each seedling in order to protect them from deer browsing. Over 100 trees were planted with the tireless efforts of volunteers, who will hopefully come back in years to come and see that the fruits of their generous labor have lived on in the gift of trees!\n\nThank you volunteers!​\n\nVolunteer Opportunities\n\nSeneca Creek State Park needs your help.
