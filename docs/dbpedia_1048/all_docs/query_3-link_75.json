        "text": "Changes from the original in the Director's Cut:\n\n2 mins: As Donnie Rides into town the music has changed from Echo and the Bunnymen's The Killing Moon to INXS's Never Tear Us Apart.\n\n6 mins: Before Donnie's mother enters his room after dinner she has a short discussion with Elizabeth, asking how she knew Donnie has stopped taking his medication.\n\n9 mins: As Donnie is awakened by Frank's voice we see a close up of his eye opening with Frank reflected in his iris. Also the sequence as he leaves the house is extended slightly.\n\n16 mins: As Donnie, Samantha and Elizabeth sit in the hotel room Samantha tries to think of ways to make money from the accident, and Donnie tells her when she falls asleep he's going to \"fart in your face.\"\n\n17 mins: As Donnie's parents discuss Frankie Feedler the scene is slightly extended, Donnie's dad thinks someone was watching over him.\n\n23 mins: As Gretchen Ross makes her first appearance in the classroom more reactions can be heard from the classmates.\n\n24 mins: As Donnie and his dad drive, just before nearly hitting Grandma Death, they flick back and forth between radio stations, Donnie wins and music now plays throughout the scene.\n\n28 mins: Frank's voice can now be heard during the Cunning Visions video, telling Donnie to watch closely.\n\n29 mins: Another shot of Donnie's eye opening as Frank awakens him before he floods the school, water is seen reflected in his eye this time.\n\n30 mins: While waiting at the bus stop, before they hear school is canceled, Donnie steals Samantha's poem and torments her. Donnie's friends also have another opportunity to bully Sharita Chen, calling her Porky Pig, and saying \"I hope you get molested.\"\n\n31 mins: More rumors fly around as to why school is closed.\n\n33 mins: As Donnie walks home with Gretchen he mentions how he wants to be able to \"change things.\"\n\n37 mins: As the police check the student's handwriting we see Donnie looking nervous, and Karen Pomeroy noticing it. This also fixes the continuity as all the previous names on the list are called before Donnie.\n\n41 mins: Newscast. Before the emergency PTA meeting Mrs. Farmer and Karen Pomeroy exchange words about Mrs. Farmer's intentions to get The Destructors banned.\n\n44 mins: Donnie's English class have a poetry day, where Donnie reads a poem about himself and Frank. \"A storm is coming, Frank says a storm that will swallow the children and I will deliver them from the kingdom of pain I will deliver the children back the their doorsteps And send the monsters back to the underground I'll send them back to a place where no-one else can see them Except for me Because I am Donnie Darko\" Karen Pomeroy then asks him who Frank is, Donnie tells her he's a six foot bunny rabbit, and everyone laughs at him.\n\n53 mins: We see the first of the excerpts from The Philosophy of Time Travel, concerning the tangent universe.\n\n59 mins: We see Donnie waiting for the school bus a plane flies overhead and everyone looks up nervously, then the second excerpt from The Philosophy of Time Travel appears, Chapter 2, Water and Metal. Behind this transition there is a short new scene where Donnie sits down next to Gretchen and she asks him why he has blood on his neck.\n\n61 mins: We see Donnie's parents out for dinner, discussing what they should do about disciplining him after the incident with Mrs. Farmer. Their opinions are wildly different, and they joke about getting divorced.\n\n62 mins: Whilst the parents are out to dinner we see that Donnie and Elizabeth have been sitting at home carving the pumpkins seen later in the film.\n\n64 mins: Another shot of Donnie's eye opening, along with footage of waves breaking on a beach.\n\n65 mins: We see Donnie and Gretchen in an arcade, the scene is overlaid by chapter 7 from the book, The Manipulated Living.\n\n66 mins: As Donnie watches Jim Cunningham's seminar at the school his perception changes, he sees things sped up, and mentions to Gretchen that he is travelling through time. The seminar now goes on longer, with extra scenes before Donnie steps up to the mic.\n\n71 mins: Donnie and Gretchen go to visit Roberta Sparrow, there is nobody home but Donnie checks her mailbox and is inspired to write to her. This scene is overlaid with chapter 4 from the book, the Artifact of the Living.\n\n74 mins: Karen Pomeroy tells the class they are no longer allowed to study The Destructors, and that their new book will be Watership Down, however if any student wants a copy of Graham Greene's book someone has put 20 copies aside at the Sarasota Mall.\n\n75 mins: Another overlay from The Philosophy of Time Travel, this time chapter 6, the Living Receiver.\n\n81 mins: Another eye opening shot, this time with flames reflected in it.\n\n87 mins: Another overlay, chapter 10, the Manipulated Dead.\n\n88 mins: Donnie returns home the morning after the fire and talks to his dad in the garden. His dad tells him that no matter how crazy he thinks he is, he should always say what's on his mind.\n\n90 mins: As we see Jim Cunningham arrested on TV the voiceover on the TV is slightly different.\n\n91 mins: Karen Pomeroy's firing is slightly shortened.\n\n92 mins: Karen gives one of her last classes, after the students watch a section of Watership Down they discuss Fiver (the rabbit)'s visions, and how trusting those visions of the end of the world would save the warren. Gretchen and Donnie argue in the class about the meaning of them. Donnie doesn't see the point of crying over a dead rabbit, Gretchen tells Donnie he missed the point, and Karen Pomeroy tells the class that the Deus Ex Machina is what saved the rabbits.\n\n97 mins: Donnie says goodbye to his mom in the street as she goes to LA with Sparkle Motion.\n\n98 mins: As Karen clears out her desk, her talk with Donnie is different, she suggests on a Friday night Donnie should be out scaring old people.\n\n103 mins: Donnie talks with his doctor about his belief in God, and she tells him he can stop taking his medication as they are placebos.\n\n106 mins: There is an overlay of Chapter 9, the Ensurance Trap.\n\n110 mins: As Donnie walks around the party, observing people's channels, there is another montage of his eye, as if he were putting all the clues together that lead him to thinking he should go to Grandma Death's house.\n\n114 mins: As Donnie is pinned down with the knife to his throat outside Grandma Death's house, it is now very clear he is saying Deus Ex Machina.\n\n116 mins: Roberta Sparrow tells Donnie a storm is coming, and that he must hurry.\n\n118 mins: We see a montage of things reflected in Donnie's eye as Frank counts down to the end of the world.\n\n120 mins: Another montage as we see the universe collapsing and rewinding as Donnie travels back through time.\n\n123 mins: The final overlay is of chapter 12, Dreams, which explains why everyone seems to be having a sleepless night as Mad World plays."
