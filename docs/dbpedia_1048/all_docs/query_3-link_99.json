        "text": "When you’re knee deep in marathon training (or training for any kind of race), you might need a little extra motivation—in this case, some tunes—to lace ’em up and get out the door.\n\nTo help boost your energy, the Runner’s World staff curated a list of the best running songs. This playlist is stocked with 35 songs that range across genres—from hip-hop to rock to pop to show tunes—so every runner out there can find the perfect procrastination-buster (and maybe even discover a new favorite).\n\nSo, next time you hit the trail, track, road, grass, sidewalk, or treadmill, open up your streaming service of choice, press play on the Runner’s World best running songs mix, and turn up your headphones—this is going to be fun.\n\n35 Best Running Songs\n\n1. “Eye of The Tiger” – Survivor\n\nDo I need a reason for this one? This is usually what I play on the morning of a marathon. Time to get your game face on.\n\n— Jess Movold, Runner’s World + Coach\n\n2. “Legend Has It” – Run the Jewels\n\nThis swaggy rap cut features emcees Killer Mike and El-P on a braggadocious journey through their successes. I’ve done many tempo runs to this track, and I have to say, the duo’s confidence is infectious—those tempos were some of the best I’ve ever run. I’m sure the powerful, pumping beat didn’t hurt my chances either—hence why I think it’s one of the best running songs out there.\n\n— Chris Hatler, Features Editor\n\n3. “The Final Count Down” – Europe\n\nAnother song that doesn’t need an explanation, it’s an oldie but goodie. This type of classic will make you appreciate getting to the end of your run or motivate you to get there.\n\n— Monique LeBrun, Associate Health & Fitness Editor\n\n4. “Into the Unknown” – Panic! At The Disco\n\nThis may seem like an odd choice, but believe me, this is the perfect running song. From the start, the beat will match your footsteps and every time Brandon Urie sings the words, “Into the Unknown” you are going to want to throw your arms out and just fly. The “woo” at the end will have you pumping your fist for a job well done.\n\n— Aly Ellis, Deputy Editor, Special Projects & Social Media\n\n5. “Little Black Submarines” – The Black Keys\n\nIf you’re a deep thought type runner who likes their music moody then you need to add “Little Black Submarines” (LBS) by The Black Keys to your playlist. This song hails from the Black Keys sixth album “El Camino” (which took home the grammy for best rock album in 2011.) LBS gets you in your own space with a melodic calm acoustic guitar intro then unexpectedly, but somehow perfectly, progresses into a satisfying loud electric guitar that makes you want to run at a quick tempo. Perfect for a track workout. But what are those little black submarines? Well that’s for you to contemplate as you sweat it out.\n\n— Jennifer Acker, Health and Fitness Editor\n\n6. “Sunday Candy”— Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment\n\nI like to use this song as a chance to take a breather, it’s more of a jogging song but still offers up good vibes, perfect for any runner.\n\n— Taylor Vasilik, Assistant Video Producer\n\n7. “Seven Nation Army” – The White Stripes\n\nEvery good running playlist eases you in before shocking you with pure energy. “Seven Nation Army” does just that. Percussionist Meg White’s thumping bass drum brings your stride to life. Frontman Jack White’s whispering vocals in the first verse guide you through those first stiff steps. Then, all of a sudden, a booming chorus explodes from the quiet to remind you that it’s time to get moving.\n\n— Chris Hatler, Features Editor\n\n8. “Calm Down” – Rema\n\nThis is another banger as Rema says in the intro of the song that will help you slow things down a bit to catch you breath, but don’t run too slow as you might find yourself stopping for a dance break.\n\n— Monique LeBrun, Health & Fitness Editor\n\n9. “Anklebiters” – Paramore\n\nThis song has a good beat and it’s edgy. It helps make me feel powerful when I’m out on the run.\n\n— Taylor Vasilik, Assistant Video Producer\n\n10. “X” – Kendrick Lamar Ft. Schoolboy Q, 2 Chainz, and Saudi\n\nAre you on 10 yet? If not, this song will definitely push you to get there. Though beat isn’t super fast, you this collaboration of rappers will definitely motivate you to finish your run strong.\n\n— Monique LeBrun, Associate Health & Fitness Editor\n\n11. “Safaera” – Bad Bunny\n\nI like to reserve it for the very end of a run. The song is five minutes long, but it sounds like a new song every couple minutes, so it keeps you interested, especially in those last few moments of a run when you feel like you want to give up. Also, it’s truly a fun song.\n\n— Savannah Jacobson, Senior Features Editor\n\n12. “Remind Me to Forget” – Kygo and Miguel\n\nI’ve had this song on every long run, half marathon, and marathon playlist since its release back in 2017, and it never fails to pump me up. The background beat provides the perfect rhythm to sync your steps and the smooth Miguel’s smooth vocals blended with Kygo’s lively mix offers a calming, upbeat energy that makes the miles feel breezy.\n\n— Mallory Creveling, Deputy Editor, Health & Fitness\n\n13. “Temperature” – Sean Paul\n\nI like songs with a strong beat so I can match my steps to the meter. This song has some timing skips and changes that keep me engaged. I often have to reset my steps to keep on the downbeat, and I like that challenge as I’m moving.\n\n— Donna Raskin, Senior Health & Fitness Editor\n\n14. “Kill v. Maim” – Grimes\n\nA good running song stays on your playlist for a few years before it eventually starts to get the inevitable “skip” to the next song. A great running song goes onto your playlist the moment you first discover it—and you have it ready whenever you need it for some motivation. That’s my story with “Kill v. Maim.” After hearing the artist breakdown the genesis of this banger on the Song Exploder podcast in 2016, I knew it would be a mainstay on any running playlist I owned—“I just wanted to make the song that would play during the trailer of this fictional movie in my mind,” Grimes told the show. The song truly does transport your mind to somewhere magical, like you’re entering a video game or film and it’s your sole duty to keep running.\n\n— Brian Dalek, Director of Content Operations\n\n15. “Paper Planes” – M.I.A.\n\nIt’s impossible to not feel cool while listening to “Paper Planes,” which is why it’s one of the best running songs. The bouncy beat throughout the song (a sample of The Clash's “Straight to Hell”) is guaranteed to put a spring in your step. You might’ve even heard it on the soundtrack of 2008's Slumdog Millionaire or Pineapple Express.

I’m generally a slow starter on my runs, so songs that build and gather momentum are perfect for kicking things off. This classic from Arcade Fire builds with slow, melancholic chords before finishing in a crescendo of voices and sounds. The shift in tempo in the final minute of the song never fails to get my pace up.\n\n— David White, SEO Manager\n\n17. “Survivin’” – Bastille\n\nI love starting workouts with this quintessentially British poppy song. The gentle rhythmic drum beats, soothing saxophone, and cool, calming voice from lead vocalist Dan Smith are great. The lyrics and chorus are simple (“I’m survivin’”), but it works. You can just tap away that first mile easily.\n\n— Jennifer Acker, Health & Fitness Editor\n\n18. “Wild for the Night” – A$AP Rocky\n\nSometimes, you just need a good turn up song.\n\n— Jess Movold, Runner’s World+ Coach\n\n19. “Phantom Heart” – Leathers\n\nI don’t know what it is about this song, but I’ve been stuck on it all year. Even though it was released in 2021, it feels nostalgic, and it’s just good to listen to. It has an 80’s undertone and dance club overtone. Shannon Hemmett has an ethereal voice that I sing along with when I’m driving—alone—in my car. On a run, you might see the slightest head bob, jaunt in my step, or shoulder roll because I’m caught up in this ear-worm’s pulsing beat.\n\n—Amanda Furrer, Test Editor\n\n20. “Let It Happen” - Tame Impala\n\nSome of the best running songs have a consistent uptempo beat with a drop that makes it all worth it. Get sucked in by Tame Impala’s psychedelia before a beat shift around the midway point—a well-earned payoff. Clocking in at just south of eight minutes in length, you can take a nice chunk out of your run jamming out to this one.\n\n—Dan Beck, Deputy Editor, News\n\n21. “Without You” – Avicii feat. Sandro Cavazza\n\nThis song is pure magic because it fits any run. On days when my feet seem to move almost effortlessly, I let the upbeat melody with its unstoppable energy help me find my euphoric groove and just go. On the opposite end of the scale, when all I want is to get the run over with, I focus on the lyrics and shout (internally, because these struggle runs also take my breath away) alongside Avicii that I’m not only “gonna tear this city down” but I’m also “going Bonnie and Clyde without you.” For any run in between, it’s just a great track. Must have!\n\n— Pavlína Černá, Senior Newsletters Editor\n\n22. “Smells Like Teen Spirit” – Nirvana\n\nDoesn’t this song make you want to do hills? As an xennial, this was my go-to before any race in high school or college. It’s 90’s alternative, grunge, and punk rock all in one—but with that stylistic hyper-enraged blend of lyrics and beat that Nirvana’s known for. It turns off your mind and lets you focus on killing hills.\n\n— Jennifer Acker, Health & Fitness Editor\n\n23. “Believe” – Mumford & Sons\n\nOn those runs where I’m feeling serious and in my feelings, I need Mumford & Sons. They know how to do it!\n\n— Jess Movold, Runner’s World+ Coach\n\n24. “Baby” – Justin Bieber feat. Ludacris\n\nStep back a decade to 2010 when the Biebs first hit your earbuds and brought an insanely catchy beat that leaves you dancing and singing along to his prepubescent voice. It’s impossible to hit play and not smile—or belt out the lyrics, rap Luda’s verse, or add a little pep in your step that helps you hit those splits.\n\n—Mallory Creveling, Deputy Editor, Health & Fitness\n\n25. “Feeling Myself” – Nicki Minaj feat. Beyoncé\n\nThis powerful collaboration between Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé is all about self love, and empowerment which is why it’s the perfect song to run to. I almost guarantee this dynamic duo will motivate you to run stronger and prouder while listening. No matter the distance you’re running, it will make a great addition to your playlist.\n\n—Monique LeBrun, Associate Health & Fitness Editor\n\n26. “Raise You Up” – Billy Porter/Kinky Boots soundtrack\n\nThis song, like many of those on my playlist, is spiritually uplifting, which helps as much as the backbeat to keep me moving. I’m a walker/runner with lots of tempo variations during my workouts, and I like to sing along with my music. This song is perfect for any mood and any pace.\n\n– Donna Raskin, Senior Health & Fitness Editor\n\n27. “Bulls on Parade” – Rage Against the Machine\n\nThis ’90s classic is a staple of my personal running playlist and is necessary for any rock fan. Like a spin instructor turned up to 11, vocalist Zach De La Rocha spits fire to heat me up. Not to be outdone by their frontman, drummer Brad Wilk and bassist Tim Commerford thunder rhythm into my tired legs during my final miles. Tom Morello’s guitar solo also has me bopping my head mid-stride (which earns a couple double-take glances from others on the trail).\n\n— Chris Hatler, Features Editor\n\n28. “B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad)” – Outkast\n\nDo you need a song four-minutes long that will not.let.up until the very end? “B.O.B.” gets you going from the jump at more than 150 beats per minute. While there are many great hits from Outkast’s archive like “Hey Ya!” and “So Fresh, So Clean,” many music publications like Pitchfork thought this was Outkast’s greatest song. Pair it with a harder tempo section, or use it to get through that final 800 repeat, and we don’t think you’ll be disappointed.\n\n—Brian Dalek, Director of Content Operations\n\n29. “Home” – Caribou\n\nOn “Home,” Dan Snaith, better known under the moniker Caribou, samples the 1971 Gloria Barnes track of the same name and turns it into a song ready for the dance floor—or in this case, the running trails. It combines a classic soul hook with a steady beat and thumping drums. It’s the kind of song perfect for the last half mile of your neighborhood run to celebrate, well, coming home!\n\n— Dan Beck, Deputy Editor, News\n\n30. “The House That Heaven Built” – Japandroids\n\nSure, the Canadian dudes-rock duo Japandroids probably didn’t intend for their generational anthem to end up on a running playlist, but I’ve used this powerful, sweat-soaked, pound-your-chest-and-pump-your-fist barnburner to provide a last-mile push so often over the last decade that its inclusion here is a no-brainer. Catch me shouting that classic chorus—“And if they try to slow you down, tell them all to go to hell!”—as I approach every finish line.\n\n— Andrew Daniels, Director of News\n\n31. “Yes (Symmetry Remix)” – Chromatics\n\nListening to anything from the Chromatics makes you feel like you’re in a movie. This song is literally taken from Lost River, an okay film directed by Ryan Gosling. The composer, Johnny Jewel, also scored Drive, a better film that Gosling starred in. Riverdale fans may have heard “Yes” play during an earlier season when Jughead hopped onto his motorcycle. My point is, if you want your run to be cinematic, play this.\n\n— Amanda Furrer, Test Editor\n\n32. “Holding Out for a Hero” – Bonnie Tyler\n\nWhen I joined my first run group in New York City, there was a girl on my team who swore by this song, calling it her “power” song. Something about her obsession with this song carried over to me. Every time I hear it I get fired up. A few years ago, I ran into her during the New York City Marathon (literally) and we both sang this song together for a few steps. Play it when you’re climbing a hill. You’ll thank me later!\n\n— Jess Movold, Runner’s World+ Coach\n\n33. “Sometimes” – Goth Babe\n\nThis isn’t a song that’s gonna make you want to run through a brick wall. In fact, quite the opposite. The warm synths of “Sometimes” radiate positive energy, putting a calming smile on your face when you need it in the late stages of a long run. Save it for the spot in your playlist when you need a break from all-gas-no-brakes songs but still want to keep your momentum.\n\n— Theo Kahler, News Editor\n\n34. “Sinnerman” – Nina Simone\n\nThere is no one I love more than Nina Simone; her emotional and political journey inspires me. The ten-minute version of this song keeps me moving and reminds me that I am stronger than I believe.\n\n— Donna Raskin, Senior Health & Fitness Editor\n\n35. “Champion” — Kanye West\n\nThis song makes me feel good—and it’s a fun one to sing when you pass someone.\n\n— Jess Movold, Runner’s World+ Coach"
