        "text": "I have a confession to make: It’s been less than a month since I cleared the two-week mark after the second Pfizer jab that rendered me CDC approved to hang out with other vaccinated people, and I’m already so socially exhausted that I canceled plans to spend tonight lying motionless under my duvet watching The Comeback. Am I...broken?\n\nIn the first stretch of COVID-19 quarantine, when I was alone 24/7 and resorting to Zoom hangs to glimpse my friends and family, I told myself that if and when the world opened back up, I would never let myself be lonely again. In that imagined future, I vowed to fill my days with boisterous park hangs and my nights with outdoor bar crawls, fully forgetting to take into account the fact that I would be firmly in my late 20s and all too well acquainted with the comfort of a plan-free night. Reemergence anxiety is real, but I can’t even say that I’m anxious or stressed about the prospect of social interaction; I’m just tired.\n\nRather than accepting that there’s something wrong with my newfound inability to hang, I would like to posit the following: What if our pre-COVID expectations for how long a social event should run were just miscalibrated? Back in the day, I regularly met up with friends for pre-drinks, then actual drinks, then dinner, then dancing, then drunk 4 a.m. cheese fries, all of which culminated in me spending the entire next day feeling like I’d just run a 10K across hot coals. Even lower-key hangouts tended to last the entire afternoon and well into the evening, leaving me precious little time to tend to my hobbies of lighting overpriced incense in my bedroom and staring at Twitter.\n\nDon’t get me wrong—I’m thrilled beyond belief to have some semblance of my social life back, and if there’s one thing the last year has taught me, it’s that a computer screen is no replacement for the feeling of actually spending time with my friends IRL. Still, I think there should be an informal time limit on hangouts as we all adjust to living in the world again, and my proposal involves a two-hour cap. That number might sound arbitrary, but think about it: Two hours is enough time to get coffee and stroll in the park, try on clothes together at a vintage store, catch up over several rounds of drinks, or grab dinner (assuming you pick a restaurant without too much of a wait).\n\nIt’s always in hour three of my group hangs that I start to get tuckered out, turning to cold brew for an infusion of energy that I hope makes me semi-fun to be around. For the first two hours, though, I’m golden, and so are most of my friends, except for the ones with kids (who tend to understandably fade 30 minutes into the proceedings). Why not quit while we’re ahead and obey the cardinal social rule of leaving while we’re still having a good time? Of course, not everyone is as easily wiped out as I am, and if you possess the fortitude required to hang out all day and well into the night, I salute you; for those of us nearing 30 and exhaustedly trying to adjust to the demands of an active calendar, though, the two-hour cap feels like a way of spending a good chunk of quality time together while avoiding burnout.\n\nPersonally, I always want to make my excuses around hour two of my gatherings, but it’s social convention that keeps me there, getting progressively crankier by the minute. What if we removed that sense of obligation and released each other and ourselves, convening once again for another two-hour hang when we actually wanted to? Some hallmarks of pre-COVID life, like brunch, are simply begging to be jettisoned, and IMO, an overly long hangout—even with your absolute best friends—is one of them. The only caveat: If you’re comfortable silently watching reality TV together, you can and should do that for as long as you can stand it because that’s true bonding."
