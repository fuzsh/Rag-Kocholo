If I select headset, there is no bass, its very flat and only one channel plays, also it turns itself off after about 10 minutes. It is plugged in directly to the wall outlet the whole time. If I select headphones, it connects and the bass and both channels is on, however, it stutters, like its a bad connection. The Hang Around sets right next to my computer, so there is no interference, etc. Ive disconnected, reconnected multiple times to no avail.\n\nProduct Owned For: 3 months\n\nProduct Used: Weekly\n\nRecommends this product:â Yes\n\nAlejandroTheGreat\n\nPhoenix, AZ\n\nAge 18 to 24\n\nâ â â â â â â â â â\n\nLoud Sound\n\nHonestly the best speaker Iâve had, and itâs a great price :)\n\nProduct Owned For: 1 month\n\nProduct Used: Daily\n\nRecommends this product:â Yes\n\nVicky\n\nSouth Tyneside\n\nAge 35 to 44\n\nâ â â â â â â â â â\n\nGreat sound\n\nThis is a great product, simple an easy to use and the sound quality is excellent.\n\nRecommends this product:â Yes\n\nLala\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAge 25 to 34\n\nâ â â â â â â â â â\n\nLove it\n\nI have been on the search for this speaker since my first one was stolen very pleased with my purchase\n\nProduct Owned For: 1 month\n\nProduct Used: Weekly\n\nRecommends this product:â Yes"
