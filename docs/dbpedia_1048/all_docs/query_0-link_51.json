        "text": "Being one of the vital platforms of entertainment, songs greatly contribute to represent the culture and traditions of a particular community and state. Be it Bollywood, Tollywood, or Dhallywood, item songs are at the core of vogue nowadays. These songs are engulfed with erotic representation and vulgar phrases, especially metaphors, similes, and proper nouns, that purposefully target women to objectify and commodify them both visually and verbally. The objective of the study is to examine how the female characters in Bollywood item songs are being commodified through the tactful usage of phrases. For this study, the English translated version of a list of popular item songs from 2010 to 2017 was accumulated from different websites as data which were later thematically discussed in relation to the theory of voyeurism and objectification. The auditory phrases unveiled some exclusive findings, for example, emphasis on women's body part, the portrayal of women as intoxicating substance and sustenance, use of repulsive and salacious simile or metaphor, and appreciation of beauty especially for white skin (Dwivedi, 2017).\n\nA content analysis of 150 randomly drawn songs from a total of 8 genres found on the Top 50 charts in the years 2006, 2007 and 2009 was conducted. Data obtained shows that compared to other genres, pop and hip hop/rap song lyrics contain more slang words that degrade and demean women. Male artists and African American artists, data shows, frequently include profane words in song lyrics than female, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Asian artists. No previous study has quantitatively measured differences between use of misogynistic slang found in various musical genres as well as ethnicity and gender of the artist. Data suggests that derogatory slang words may merely reproduce and uphold male ideas concerning the value and importance of women."
