        "text": "I've long admired those pretty padded clothes hangers that I often see while flipping through various magazines. After studying one recently it occurred to me that this would be a great project to try myself.\n\nThat brings me to today's project and this easy padded floral hanger.\n\nI think any fabric would work with this easy design but I decided to go with a floral decorator fabric. I actually bought this fabric for another project and I had quite a bit left over.\n\nI hate to throw away fabric remnants and this is a perfect way to use up fabric pieces that are too small to do anything else with. You'll only need about 1/4-yard of fabric for one hanger.\n\nGrab some coordinating ribbon to adorn the finished hanger. You can find ribbon by the spool at most fabric stores. I love the dainty look of these roses on a string. Each rose has a tiny pearl center. Perfect for this project\n\nYou'll need some cotton fiberfill along with a few wooden coat hangers. Many wooden hangers come with the pants bar across the bottom. This bar is easily removed with a good tug. Be sure to also remove the tiny nails that the bar is attached to.\n\nMeasure the distance between the end of the coat hanger and the center. Add about 1/4-inch to that measurement and cut with a 3-inch width. Label this piece A.\n\nCreate piece B by cutting another piece of fabric about 8 1/4-inch longer than piece A. Piece B will also have a 3-inch width.\n\nRound the corners of piece A and B identically. I used the large opening of a regular sized paper cup as corner-rounder guide.\n\nThe longer fabric piece (B) will need to be gathered all the way around. To gather, select your largest stitch width (also called a basting stitch) on your sewing machine and stitch 1/4-inch all the way around fabric piece. Make sure you leave several inches of tail thread on the end.\n\nNext, stitch an identical row all the way around about 1/4-inch to the left of your original stitching. This will give you two parallel rows of basting stitch.\n\nGently pull the top two tail threads that hang off the raw edge of the fabric and gently slide the fabric forward to create the gathers.\n\nThe thicker the fabric the more care you need to take with the gathering. There's nothing worse than getting halfway through your gathering process and having the pull threads break on you.\n\nIt's a good idea to gather from both sides of your fabric piece and have them meet in the center to reduce the risk of pesky thread breaks.\n\nThe photo below shows piece B after it's been gathered.\n\nPin piece B to piece A matching both at the bottom raw edge. Then ease the gathering so that both pieces fit together with right sides together. Pin and then stitch all the way around with a 5/8 standard seam allowance.\n\nTurn inside out and this will give you the first fabric sleeve for the hanger. Duplicate steps for the second fabric sleeve.\n\nSlightly stuff both sleeves with some cotton fiberfill and then insert the ends of the wooden hanger into each one. Do not over-stuff at this point because you still need to insert your wooden hanger. You can use a knitting needle to help get the stuffing into the farthest end.\n\nGently insert the end of the wooden hanger into the sleeve. Make sure you slide the wood under the cotton so the cotton fills out the gathered top portion of the sleeve.\n\nThe photo below shows what the project should look like at this point.\n\nBring the open ends of pieces A and B together at the center of the wood hanger. Slightly overlap one open end over the other and slip stitch them together.\n\nYou can hide the slip-stitching by wrapping ribbon around the hanger several times before topping it off with a bow.\n\nThis is another really simple but elegant project to make. As you can see, even a first-time effort can turn out nicely. Imagine how pretty three of these covered hangers would look sitting in a tissue paper-filled gift box.\n\nWouldn't a trio of fabric covered hangers make a great gift? The fact that you made them yourself, would make the offering even more special."
