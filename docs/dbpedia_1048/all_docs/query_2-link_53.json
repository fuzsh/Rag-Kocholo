        "text": "What is long COVID?\n\nLong COVID is a collection of symptoms you might experience after your initial (acute) COVID symptoms get better. You thought you’d only have to deal with COVID for a week or two, but you’re still exhausted all the time. Or you can’t think straight. Food you once loved tastes metallic — or you can’t taste it at all. You might not be able to remember the last time you got a good night’s sleep.\n\nLong COVID isn’t one symptom or set of symptoms. It’s any medical condition linked to a COVID-19 infection that goes on for three months or longer after your first COVID symptoms. It can happen whether you had a mild case of COVID or a severe one. The symptoms could be similar to autoimmune, lung, heart, neurological or psychological disorders. Some symptoms are mild and others are completely debilitating. They may come and go, change or get worse over time. You may feel like you never really got better from your initial bout with COVID at all.\n\nLong COVID is also called long-haul COVID, post-COVID syndrome (or conditions) and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. In many people, it’s compared to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Because of the different symptoms and possible causes, there’s no single treatment that works for everyone.\n\nHow common is long COVID?\n\nPost-COVID conditions may affect about 5% to 10% of people who’ve had a COVID infection. But the variety of symptoms and differences in how long they last can make it hard to know exactly how many people experience it.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of long COVID?\n\nLong COVID has a variety of symptoms. Some people with long COVID have more than one symptom, but most people don’t experience all of them. The two most common symptoms are fatigue (lack of energy) and shortness of breath. Other possible symptoms include:\n\nLoss of or altered sense of smell or taste (anosmia or dysgeusia).\n\nTrouble thinking or focusing — “brain fog.”\n\nChronic cough.\n\nHeadaches.\n\nDifficulty sleeping or insomnia.\n\nDepression.\n\nAnxiety.\n\nChest pain.\n\nHeart palpitations.\n\nDiarrhea.\n\nWhat causes long COVID?\n\nExperts can’t pinpoint one single cause for long COVID. But other coronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have been known to cause long-term effects. So perhaps it’s no surprise that COVID symptoms can last a long time, too. Multiple factors might contribute to the causes of long COVID, including:\n\nTiny blood clots. Very small blood clots might not cause a major event (like a stroke), but they can prevent your lungs, brain and other organs from working properly.\n\nInflammation. Your immune system may overreact and continue to cause inflammation in your organs and tissues long after it’s fought off the infection.\n\nAutoimmune disorders. For reasons we don’t understand, COVID might cause your immune system to start attacking parts of your own body, like an autoimmune disorder.\n\nViral persistence. SARS‑CoV‑2, the virus that causes COVID-19, might hang around in your body long after you feel better from your initial illness. You can test negative for COVID and you aren’t contagious anymore, but it could continue to cause issues in your body.\n\nReactivation of other viruses. Some viruses remain inactive, or dormant, in your body without you knowing it. These can sometimes get reactivated and cause symptoms again. Some evidence suggests that COVID might reactivate Epstein-Barr virus (the virus that causes mono), causing long-lasting symptoms.\n\nLong-term psychological effects of having a serious illness. If you had a severe case of COVID, especially if you were hospitalized, you might have anxiety, depression or other mental health conditions as a result.\n\nWhat are the risk factors for long COVID?\n\nYou’re at higher risk for long COVID if you:\n\nAren’t vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nHad severe COVID, especially if you were hospitalized. But it’s important to note that people with mild cases can also get long COVID.\n\nHad multisystem inflammatory disorder (MIS-C) during or after having COVID.\n\nHad health conditions that existed before getting COVID. These include lung disease, obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nAre a woman or a person assigned female at birth (AFAB).\n\nWhen should I seek care?\n\nSee a healthcare provider if you have:\n\nSevere COVID symptoms.\n\nSymptoms that last a long time, even if your initial symptoms have gotten better.\n\nAny symptoms that disrupt your daily life.\n\nTell them about your symptoms and how they’re impacting your life. Let them know when you had COVID and when your current symptoms started.\n\nWhen should I go to the ER?\n\nGo to the emergency room (ER) if your symptoms suddenly get worse or you have symptoms of severe illness, including:\n\nHigh fever (over 103 degrees Fahrenheit or 40 degrees Celsius).\n\nDifficulty breathing.\n\nPain in your chest or stomach (abdomen) that’s severe or doesn’t go away.\n\nPersistent dizziness.\n\nConfusion.\n\nSevere muscle pain or weakness.\n\nInability to wake up or stay awake.\n\nSeizures.\n\nBluish skin, lips or nails (cyanosis, which can be a sign of low oxygen levels in your blood or tissues).\n\nWhat questions should I ask my doctor?\n\nIt might be helpful to ask a healthcare provider:\n\nWhat are my treatment options?\n\nDo you know what’s causing my symptoms?\n\nDo people with my symptoms usually improve?\n\nHow do I take my medication?\n\nWhen should I follow up with you?\n\nWhat symptoms should I go to the ER for?\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nSometimes, medical knowledge lags behind what patients have already been experiencing for a long time. Fortunately, we’ve come a long way in understanding some of the long-lasting symptoms of COVID. Many healthcare providers now work together on diverse teams dedicated to understanding and treating your symptoms.\n\nIt’s still a learning process — it may take some trial and error to find the treatment that works best for you. Enlist the help of someone who can advocate for you if you aren’t able to do so yourself. They can help you find healthcare providers, support groups and counseling. Let your family, friends and employer or school know that you may need extra time on certain tasks or more breaks. Giving yourself permission to be gentle with yourself while you recover can be the first step to feeling better."
