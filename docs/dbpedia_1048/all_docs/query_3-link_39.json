        "text": "The answer is C.\n\nREPLETE means “full with,” and FAMISHED means “very hungry.” If a person is FAMISHED, they are not REPLETE with food. In a specific context, these two adjectives directly contradict one another.\n\nIf something is BLATANT it is very obvious, while if something is MASKED it is hidden. If something is MASKED, it is not BLATANT – these two words also directly contradict each other, and is, therefore, the correct answer.\n\nIncorrect Answers\n\nA – SHROUD means “to cover,” and HASTEN means “to do something quickly.” These two words do not have a strong relationship.\n\nB – PLAUSIBLE means “reasonable,” and PLACATE means “try to please.” These two words do not have a strong relationship.\n\nD – COMMENCE means to begin, and a person GRADUATEs upon completing a course of study. Often, GRADUATION ceremonies are referred to as COMMENCEment ceremonies. These two words are related but do not contradict one another.\n\nE – A person who is DEPRESSED may not be SUCCESSFUL, but these two words do not directly contradict each other.\n\nThe correct answer is: 2.\n\nWhen solving this type of question it is important to understand the pattern that the three circles exhibit and the numerical relationship between them.\n\nFocus on the quarter that the question mark appears in and check to see if there is a common relationship that repeats itself between that quarter and the other quarters of each of the circles.\n\nIn this example, the circles share the following pattern: (Top cell) minus (Diagonal-bottom-cell) = 1.\n\ne.g. left circle: 6 (top-left) – 5 (bottom-right) = 1, 9 (top-right) – 8 (bottom-left) = 1; right circle: 0 (top-left) – (-1) (bottom-right) = 1.\n\nAccording to the reasoning above the (top-left) cell – (bottom-right) cell = 1. Therefore, the (bottom-right) cell = 2.\n\nThe correct answer is A - Yes.\n\nThe way to solve this type of question is to examine the ratios and see if there could be an overlap between the two groups - if most of the snakes are green and most of the snakes are quick, we can deduce that there has to be at least one green snake that is also quick.\n\nThis happens because the subgroups of \"green\" and \"quick\" each constitute more than 50% of the entire snake population (most of the snakes means more than 50%) and consequently must overlap.\n\nThe correct answer is 28.\n\nIt helps to memorize the most common fractions that represent each type of percentages/decimals.\n\nFor example:\n\n1\\4 = 0.25 = 25%\n\n1\\8 = 0.125 = 12.5%\n\nIf there are 32 students in the class and only 12.5% of them own at least one pet then all that is left is to divide 32\\8 to know that 4 students own a pet and 28 do not.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\nThe logic: In all of the options except for option three, there is a vertical line which separates these boxes into two, equal, symmetrical halves which mirror one another. If these boxes were pieces of paper which were folded vertically, the items in the boxes would be matching and perfectly identical. The right and left halves are mirror-images of one another. This is not the case for option three. In option 3, there is no mirroring effect between the halves. Both hearts have to be either on the top or on the box's bottom for there to be symmetry.\n\nYou have probably noticed that the amount, shape and color of the items are insignificant features and are simply distracters.\n\nThe correct answer is 3.3%.\n\nIn order to tackle this question we will first need to understand that there are two opposite \"forces\" in this question - charging and discharging (i.e. application usage) of the battery. The charger works in a \"positive direction\" and the applications in a \"negative direction\".\n\nNow we can address the given information:\n\nCharger's work rate: 4.5/1 (4.5% charge per minute)\n\nApplications' work rate: -3/2.5 = -1.2/1 (1.2% discharge per minute)\n\nThus, the total charging rate (\"sum of forces\"): 4.5/1 – 1.2/1 = 3.3/1, meaning: 3.3% per minute.\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\nThe two black sections of the circle move around it clockwise in a different pattern: the section on the upper left side of the circle moves two sections each step. The second section (upper right side in the first frame) stays in the same spot for a step and then moves two sections in the next two steps.\n\nWhen the two sections land on the same spot, they appear as one, such as in the third frame.\n\nIn the next frame of the sequence, the first section should appear on the upper right side of the circle, so answers (A), (B), and (E) can be ruled out. The second section should stay where it is, which leaves the answer (D)."
