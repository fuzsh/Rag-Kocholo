        "text": "I can’t have Boston Fern Hanging Baskets on my front porch. As a born and bred Southerner, that’s hard to admit. Fern-flanked porches are a staple of the Southern landscape.\n\nWhile our front porch faces due South and a beautiful Boston Fern can’t take the scorching heat of the afternoon sun, you better believe our shady back patio is filled with the luscious green fronds in pots and hanging baskets! The good news is that I can also select Kimberly Queen Ferns to pot in upright containers around my front door as they can tolerate several more hours of sun.\n\nGiven the proper care, ferns are surprisingly easy to care for and grow.\n\nHow to Care for Ferns on Your Porch\n\nHere are a few tips for how to care for ferns so you can add them to your porch easily. Pretty soon, your porch and home garden will be beautiful and thriving! Whether you’re looking for fern care best practices or need tips for picking the right type for your porch, we have some guidelines below.\n\n1. Select The Right Fern\n\nBoston Ferns and Kimberly Queen Ferns are the most popular selections for porches. Depending on the look you desire, you’ll want to purchase the right fern that not only looks good but also will grow well in your planting environment. Contact our team of expert gardeners if you have questions about growing a specific type of fern on your porch.\n\nBoston Ferns are great in hanging baskets or on plant stands because of the gentle weeping nature of the vibrant green fronds; they thrive in humid climates and when their soil has consistent moisture. Kimberly Queen Ferns have more rigid, upright fronds and are perfect in pots flanking a pathway or entrance. Kimberly Queen Ferns can tolerate much more sun than a Boston Fern.\n\n2. The Right Light\n\nFerns prefer bright, indirect light. A few hours of morning sun or gently filtered light through the cover of trees is the perfect scenario. Avoid direct sunlight that can burn a fern’s more delicate fronds, especially during the hot summer months.\n\nA basic rule of thumb for selecting front porch ferns:\n\nShade: Boston Ferns\n\nPart Shade to Part Sun: Macho Ferns\n\nPart Sun to Sun: Kimberly Queen Ferns\n\nIf you have full, afternoon sun on your front porch, check to see if your side or back porch would provide a less harsh environment for your plants. At our garden center, we can help you find a different plant to better tolerate the full sun. We also offer classes and events for people looking to become better, more informed gardeners!\n\n3. Water Your Fern Regularly\n\nKnowing how often to water ferns is essential to their growth. The secret? Ferns like moisture. Keep in mind that their natural habitat is under the shady, wet canopy of a rainforest. Consistent and evenly moist soil is key in order to maintain a bright green, healthy glow.\n\nYour watering schedule will depend on how you plant your fern. If you choose to place your fern in a hanging basket or pot, remember that they can dry out quickly. Soil should be kept damp but not wet to the touch.\n\nCheck your fern daily at first to determine the frequency with which you’ll need to water your ferns. Keep in mind that watering schedules and general fern care will vary whether your ferns are growing outside or indoors.\n\n4. Fertilize Monthly\n\nFerns like a monthly dose of plant food for nutrition, especially in the warmer months. Choose a water-soluble, nitrogen-rich fertilizer for best results. If you need assistance selecting the right fertilizer, visit us at Fairview Garden center and we would be happy to help!\n\n5. Follow These Overwinter Steps\n\nFerns are tropical plants and will not tolerate cold outdoor temperatures. You might be wondering, then, how to care for ferns outside during the winter. To maintain your fern’s evergreen color, you can try to overwinter your fern by cutting it back in the fall and placing it in a light-filled area indoors.\n\nLocation, humidity, and water are essential for an attempt at overwintering. Remember that even a dormant fern likes moisture, and a heated home can dry out a plant quickly. Give your plant a good soaking in the shower a few times throughout the winter months.\n\nAdd Ferns To Your Porch Today\n\nWe hope you’re feeling excited about adding ferns to your Southern porch with these tips for how to care for ferns!
