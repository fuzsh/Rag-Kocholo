It also serves as one of the most important skills we can have. Without it, we would be lost in a sea of words with almost no way to navigate. So given this importance, why do so few people seem to read at a decent pace?",

        "text": "The average reader will read 300 pages in 8.3 hours when reading at a speed of 300 words per minute (wpm).\n\nTypical documents that are 300 pages or more include full-length novels. A typical single-spaced page is 500 words long.\n\nYou may read faster or slower than this depending on your average reading speed. Adults typically read at about 300 words per minute when reading fiction for enjoyment but that will depend on the type of book or material. For example, technical material such as operating manuals, manual repair guides, or complicated scientific research typically require more focus and attention to detail which can slow reading speeds down to 125 words per minute. College students typically need to be able to read at 400-450 words per minute in order to quickly consume textbook content.\n\nCheck out our word counter tool to see how long your text is and how long it will take to read.\n\nWhat If I'm a Slower Reader?"
