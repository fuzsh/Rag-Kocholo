Safety assistants will be stationed at various points along the climb from the bottom to the top, to instruct and encourage you. Do not be nervous, this is all part of the expedition’s experience.\n\nUnlike other hiking expeditions, this is a challenging adventure. But, as long as you have good physical fitness, you can definitely conquer the Wall with the support of the safety team. After lunch at the top of the Wall, the group will leave the cave, where a final rocky section awaits, and trek through forest to return to Ho Chi Minh Trail West. Here the Son Doong Cave Expedition ends with cool beer and soft drinks. Tour guide and driver will bring you to Chay Lap Farmstay at around 15:00 - 16:00.\n\nChay Lap Farmstay will warmly welcome you back with a glass of champagne and a fancy dinner.

Inform Oxalis’ sales staff in-advance if you want to stay longer.\n\nWeather and Climate in Son Doong Cave\n\nQuang Binh, like many northern provinces of Vietnam, has 4 seasons in a year (spring, summer, autumn and winter). Due to the weather condition and for the safety of guests, Hang Son Doong Cave tour is only operated from January to the end of August every year.\n\nFrom January to March, the weather may be quite cold. If there are sunny days, you may see sunbeams illuminating Hang En Cave campsite.\n\nFrom April to May may be one of the best times of year when the weather becomes nice and warm, landscapes and scenery turn green, and flowers bloom. This is also the time to see clouds and mist forming in the cave.\n\nFrom June to August are the warmest summer months. However, most of the time the trek is under the tree cover and inside the cave with temperature from 22 to 25 degrees, so it is not too bad at all. Swimming in the underground lakes is the best experience of this season.\n\nEach season contains its own unique features, unlike any other caves in Vietnam's national park. Son Doong Cave has its own weather system. Please read more about weather in Son Doong at “Weather of the seasons in Hang Son Doong Tour”.
