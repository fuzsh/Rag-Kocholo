        "text": "35,000 words covers 3 to 5 studio albums and EPs. I included mixtapes if the artist was short of the 35,000 words. Quite a few rappers donât have enough official material to be included (for example, Biggie, Chance the Rapper, Queen Latifah, and El-P).\n\nSince the original release, thereâs now a notable trend of fewer unique words among newer artists. This is easier to see in the following chart, where I highlighted each artistâs primary decade, based on album release dates for their vocabulary calculation (the first 35,000 lyrics).\n\nRaw Lyrics Data via John W. Miller\n\nIn short, if artists depart from hip-hop song structure, weâd expect their vocabulary to go down in the number of unique words.\n\nThat said, the results are still directionally interesting. Of the 150 artists in the dataset, letâs take a look at who is on top.\n\n#1 - Aesop Rock\n\nWhen I first published this analysis, I excluded Aesop Rock, figuring he was too obscure. The Reddit hip-hop community was in an uproar, claiming that Aesop would absolutely be #1. Sure enough, Aesop Rock is well above every artist in the dataset, and I was obliged to add him to the chart.\n\n#2 - Busdriver\n\nFor the most recent update, I pored over requests from readers, and Busdriver was most common on folksâ wishlists. He and Aesop Rock are the only rappers with more than 7,000 unique words in their first 35,000 lyrics.\n\n#4, #5, #7, #10, #15, and #20 - Wu-Tang Clan Ain’t Nuthing Ta F’ Wit\n\nWu-Tang Clan at #5 is impressive given that 10 members, with vastly different styles, equally contribute lyrics. Add the fact that GZA, Ghostface, Raekwon, and Method Man's solo works are also in the top 20 â notably, GZA is at #4.\n\n#28, #54 - Outkast and E-40\n\nOf course E-40 is in the top 20%; heâs considered to be the inventor of many slang terms. Just a few that heâs been responsible for coining or popularizing: âall good,â âpop ya collar,â âshizzle,â and âyou feel me.â\n\nOutkastâs expansive vocabulary is definitely a function of their style: frequent use of portmanteaus (for example, âATLiens,â âStankoniaâ), southern drawl (for example, ânahmsayin,â âeryâdayâ), and made-up slang (for example, âflawsky-wawskyâ).\n\n#49 and #59 - Busta Rhymes and Twista\n\nSince both rappers are known for their speed, itâs nice to see that their verses are just as lyrically diverse as their peersâ.\n\nSo what's all this mean?\n\nio9 writer Robert Gonzalez blew my mind with this point, âOn the Black Album track 'Moment of Clarity,' Jay-Z contrasts his lyricism with that of Common and Talib Kweliâ (both of whom rank higher than him, when it comes to the diversity of their vocabulary):\n\nI dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars\n\nThey criticized me for it, yet they all yell âhollaâ\n\nIf skills sold, truth be told, Iâd probably be\n\nLyrically Talib Kweli\n\nTruthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense\n\nBut I did 5 mil - I ainât been rhyming like Common since\n\nI used a research methodology called token analysis to determine each artistâs vocabulary. Each word is counted once, so pimps, pimp, pimping, and pimpin are four unique words. To avoid issues with apostrophes (e.g., pimpinâ vs. pimpin), theyâre removed from the dataset. It still isnât perfect. Hip hop is full of slang that is hard to transcribe (e.g., shorty vs. shawty), compound words (e.g., king shit), featured vocalists, and repetitive choruses.\n\nIf you’re looking for more quantitative analysis of hip hop, check out Tahir Hemphill’s many foundational projects (and whose work initially inspired this analysis) and Martin Conner’s Rap Analysis.\n\nVocabulary count data is available here.\n\nNotable artists currently excluded, under the 35,000 threshold: Cardi B, Dej Loaf, Princess Nokia, Rae Sremmurd, Dreezy, Remy Ma, Dej Loaf, Da Brat, Princess Nokia, Queen Latifah, Azealia Banks, Nav, Dreezy, Earl Sweatshirt, Eyedea, Jay Electronica, Pharoahe Monch, Pusha T, Saba, Waka Floka Flame, XXXTentacion."
