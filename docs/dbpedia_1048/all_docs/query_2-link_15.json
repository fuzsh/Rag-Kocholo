        "text": "Spending time with your girlfriends, virtually or in person, is essential for us to maintain our emotional equilibrium and sanity, especially as we age and most definitely when dealing with stress. Our friends grant us a safe zone in which we can be our authentic selves. We support each other through our personal and professional challenges.\n\nWhen you face difficult challenges at work, an objective ear from someone outside your workplace is a blessing. If you have a trusted girlfriend at work, you can use each other as sounding boards to get through the tough times. Schedule times to get together during work or after hours. Create a personal tribe of allies with whom you can speak without fear of judgement and who will give you their best advice when you need it.\n\nIt is that give-and-take in friendship that strengthens the bond. As my colleague Kare Anderson, author and TED Talk speaker, rightly notes, mutuality matters. It matters whether you’re developing alliances in or out of work. When you listen to others and make a gesture to help or add value, the bond is created. And it is gratifying. This mutual support and bonding make us feel needed and appreciated on a deep level.\n\nWith all this said, it’s no surprise then that hanging with your girlfriends is good for your mental and physical health. Although you probably don’t need proof because you feel it yourself, studies demonstrate the benefits of friendship in these areas. Research confirms that socializing improves your happiness and positivity. It helps you deal with stress and calms you down. Some experts recommend that you spend time with your girlfriends twice a week. This may not be possible with your schedule, however, weekly and sometimes daily check-in calls are important. FaceTime and Zoom have become a lifeline through the current pandemic and stay at home orders.\n\nSpending time with friends seems to be an innate behavior for women and one that extends our life expectancy. According to research out of UCLA, “women more reliably turn to their social contacts in times of stress, responses that are . . . protective of health and longevity. The fact that men may be somewhat more likely to cope with stress via fight or flight and women to cope with stress via tend and befriend may help to explain the worldwide gender gap in mortality.”\n\nSocializing with friends helps older women deal with loneliness and depression, according to a report in Psychology Today that states that “female friendships can be the key to happiness in older women, but they’re not often treated as such.” And it’s true: we hear a lot more about the importance of exercise and nutrition than hanging out with girlfriends.\n\nIn need of finding some like-minded women? Revel is great option for women over 50. Started by two young female entrepreneurs, the organization has the mission of facilitating connections through common interests as well as through their events. Their website states that “There are 58.75 million women in this country aged 50 and over. We’re in big cities, suburbs, small towns, and rural enclaves. But while we’re everywhere, we’re hard to find. Hidden in our homes, lost in dreary routines, or trapped in obligations that fail to bring joy. With children grown, and careers winding down, this is our time to revel in the rest of our lives.”\n\nYou may want to consider other groups that focus on women over 45, like NextTribe: The Voice of Women Aging Boldly, to share the experiences and challenges of aging with articles, virtual and live events, as well as fun trips; or the Covey Club, which supports women’s advancement and growth after forty. Many Facebook groups have also formed around special interests such as writing and book clubs. And local meetups to run, walk, hike, or socialize for wine tastings, art walks, and so on. Believe me, women out there are also eager to connect.\n\nYou can form your own group. When Dale Pollekoff moved to Los Angeles in her seventies and wanted to make new friends, she found it difficult meeting people in LA. Frustrated that all the Meetup groups were for young women, Dale started Finding Female Friends Past Fifty, which grew to almost 3,000 members before she joined forces with Revel.\n\nBottom line: We often think of spending time with our girlfriends as a nice pastime, a getaway from work and family routines and pressures. But we need to recognize that along with the fun and loving support, hanging with our girlfriends is important to reduce stress, to promote positivity and mental health. Hanging with our girlfriends supports our physical health and longevity."
