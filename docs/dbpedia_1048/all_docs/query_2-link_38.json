        "text": "How Long Does a Cold Last?\n\nColds are common, and they usually last for about 7 to 10 days.Â\n\nIn todayâs fast-paced world, it may be hard to slow down for a mere case of the sniffles and sneezes. Sure, you can try to work through it and hope youâll feel better quickly. And sometimes that happens. But other times, symptoms stick around.\n\nIf youâre under the weather for longer than 10 days, many things could be to blame.Â\n\nYou Arenât Getting Enough Rest\n\nSleep helps keep yourÂ immune system working like it should. Once you have a cold, you need to catch enough ZZZs to help your body fight off the virus. Try to get 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night to help recharge your immune system.\n\nToo little shut-eye can also make you more likely to get a cold. One study found that people who got less than 5 hours of sleep per night were 4.5 times more likely to get a cold than people who slept for 7 hours or more.\n\nYouâre Low on Fluids\n\nWhen youâre sick, itâs easy to get dehydrated. You lose fluid as your body makesÂ mucus and it drains away, and if you have aÂ fever, that draws moisture out of your body. And when you take an over-the-counter cold medicine to dry up your runny nose, it can dry out the rest of you, too. Also, aÂ sore throat can make it painful to swallow.\n\nItâs important to stay hydrated. This helps keep your nose and throat moist and helps loosen up the mucus.\n\nSo drink plenty ofÂ water, juice, or soup. Stay away from alcohol, coffee, and caffeine when youâre looking for things to sip, though, because they can dehydrate you.\n\nYouâre Stressed\n\nWhen youâre stressed out about work or other things in your life, it takes a toll on yourÂ immune system. You canât fight off viruses as well as you should, and that makes you more likely to get a cold.\n\nOngoingÂ stress can reduce your bodyâs lymphocytes, which are white blood cells that fight infection. This can make you more likely to get the common cold and other viruses. Chronic stress can also throw your levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, out of whack, which can increase inflammation.\n\nYouâre Treating the Wrong Illness\n\nIt's easy to confuse a cold with other illnesses. You might treat what you think is a cold for a few weeks, only to realize that the reason you arenât getting better is because youâre dealing with something else, likeÂ allergies.\n\nAllergies vs. cold\n\nThe common cold and allergies share some symptoms, like aÂ cough, runny nose, and sneezing. Hereâs how to tell them apart:\n\nAlthough you may not know exactly how long your cold will last,Â cold symptoms usually take a few days to fully show up. Allergies can come on quickly, and they last for as long as you are exposed to the allergen. If you have aches, pains, or a fever, itâs more likely to be a cold.\n\nCold vs. sinus infection\n\nBoth aÂ sinus infection and a cold can cause pain around your eyes and nose, as well as icky, yellowish mucus. With a cold, these symptoms usually happen within the first few days of a cold. But a sinus infection typically shows up after the normal time it takes for a cold to run its course. So if youâre dealing with these symptoms after a couple of weeks, it might be a sinus infection. You might want to call your doctor if you think itâs a sinus infection.\n\nYouâre Taking the Wrong Things for It\n\nYouâve probably heard about remedies that promise to cure your cold. Many product claims aren't proven, and itâs important to remember that even if a label says \"herbal,\" it could still be harmful.\n\nEchinacea is one of the first natural treatments people suggest when you have a cold, but most studies show it doesnât work.\n\nMany people takeÂ vitamin C thinking itâll speed up the cold process. But thereâs little evidence that it helps shorten a cold once you have it.Â\n\nPeople also take zinc to help end a cold, but again, the evidence is weak. And some people who used a nasal spray with zinc lost their sense of smell. So your best bet may be to leave it on the shelf.\n\nAntibiotics are another treatment people often try when theyâre sick, but they wonât help with a cold. Colds are caused by viruses, and antibiotics fight bacteria, not viruses.\n\nThere is no cure for the common cold, but home remedies and over-the-counter medicines may help ease your symptoms regardless of how long your cold lasts.Â\n\nYou Are Not Getting Enough Rest\n\nRest is important when youâre trying to get over a cold â and rest is not just getting enough sleep. If you have a cold, you might want to avoid strenuous exercise for 2 or 3 days.Â\n\nIf your cold symptoms are all above your neck, like a runny nose, stuffy head, and sneezing, it may be OK to be active. But if you have symptoms below the neck, like chest congestion, a hacking cough, an upset stomach, fever, muscle aches, or fatigue, give yourself permission to sit it out. Rest is what gives your immune system time to recharge.Â\n\nIn the first few days of your cold, you might want to consider staying home from work or school to help you get more rest.\n\nIf your symptoms keep getting worse or you start having new ones, your cold may be getting worse. A fever is a common cold symptom, but if you have a fever of over 100 degrees for more than 3 days, you should see a doctor. And if your fever goes away and then comes back, thatâs another sign that your cold is getting worse.Â\n\nYou should also get medical attention if you have intense chest pain or shortness of breath. These may be signs of other issues that need treatment.\n\nSigns Your Cold Is Getting Better\n\nIf your symptoms start to bother you less and you start to feel better in general, your cold may be getting better. Sometimes a cough lasts longer than other symptoms, like a stuffy nose, sore throat, and body aches. But if your other symptoms seem to be going away, your cold may be getting better even if you still have a cough.\n\nAlso consider how long your cold has lasted. If you felt bad for a few days and then felt better, and itâs been 7 to 10 days since your cold started, you may be nearing the end of your cold.\n\nHow Long Is a Cold Contagious?\n\nColds can spread easily. If you have a cold, you might be contagious for up to 2 weeks. You could spread your cold even before you know you have it, but you're most contagious when your symptoms are their worst. Thatâs usually the first few days you feel sick.\n\nTo avoid spreading a cold while youâre contagious, be sure to wash your hands frequently and clean surfaces that you and others touch frequently, like doorknobs.\n\nTakeaways\n\nThereâs no cure for the common cold, so if you have one, youâll probably have to deal with it for several days. But if youâre not getting enough rest and not drinking enough fluids, your immune system might have a hard time doing its job, and your symptoms might continue.Â\n\nSome remedies and medicines are unlikely to work on your cold. Instead, making sure you get enough rest, stay hydrated, and avoid stress can help you feel better.\n\nHow Long Does a Cold Last FAQs\n\nWhy does a cold never go away? Usually, a cold goes away in 7 to 10 days, but you might still have some symptoms, like a cough, that linger after that. If your cold symptoms keep bothering you or get worse, you should see a health care provider to make sure you donât have another complication, like an infection.\n\nWhy can't a cold be cured? Colds are caused by viruses, but these viruses come in many different varieties, so itâs difficult to make a vaccine for colds. Also, antibiotics donât work on viruses, so there is no cure for the common cold.Â"
