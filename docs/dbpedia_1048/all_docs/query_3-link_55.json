        "text": "While all of Samsung's earbuds are built to last the entire day, the buds' battery life and charging times may differ depending on the model you have and how you use them.\n\nGalaxy Buds FE provide up to 7 hours of play time per charge, which can be extended to up to 26 hours with a fully charged case.\n\nGalaxy Buds2 Pro provide up to 8 hours of play time per charge, which can be extended to up to 30 hours with a fully charged case.\n\nGalaxy Buds2 provide up to 7.5 hours of play time per charge, which can be extended to up to 29 hours more with a fully charged case. Placing the buds in the charging case for 10 minutes will give you up to 150 minutes of play time.\n\nGalaxy Buds Pro provide up to 8 hours of play time per charge, which can be extended to up to 28 hours more with a fully charged case. Just 10 minutes in the charging case will give you up to 85 minutes of play time.\n\nGalaxy Buds Live provide up to 8 hours of play time per charge, which can be extended to up to 29 hours more with a fully charged case. Charging them in the case for 5 minutes will give you up to an hour of play time.\n\nGalaxy Buds+ provide up to 11 hours of play time, which can be extended to up to 11 hours more with a fully charged case. Charging in the case for 10 minutes will provide 3 hours of battery life.\n\nGalaxy Buds provide up to 6 hours of play time, which can be extended to up to 7 hours more with a fully charged case. Charging in the case for just 15 minutes will give you up to 1.7 hours of battery life.\n\nNote: You can wirelessly charge your earbuds with a compatible phone using Wireless PowerShare or a QI-compatible wireless charging pad.\n\nTake care of your earbuds by keeping these charging tips and precautions in mind.\n\nDo not use a charging case that came with any other model. The case included with your earbuds is specifically designed to provide the optimal charge for your earbuds.\n\nIf there is any form of liquid, including sweat, on the charging terminals, corrosion may occur. Clean the terminals before charging the battery.\n\nUsing a power source other than the charger (such as a computer) may result in a slower charging speed due to a lower electric current.\n\nWhile charging, the earbuds and the charging case may heat up. This is normal and should not affect the earbudsâ€™ lifespan or performance. If the battery heats up more than usual, the charger will stop charging.\n\nIf the earbuds and the charging case are completely discharged, it may take a while for them to turn on.\n\nIf the earbuds and charging case are not charging properly, call us at 1-800-SAMSUNG for additional help.\n\nAvoid bending the charger. Doing so may damage or reduce the lifespan of the charger. Never use a damaged charger.\n\nIf the earbud battery indicator light is black or flashing red, remove the earbuds to make sure both the earbud tips and wingtips are properly attached. It may be necessary to clean the earbuds, including the charging contact. Then, reinsert the earbuds.\n\nIf the indicator light does not work as described in the \"Battery indicator light\" section, disconnect and reconnect the charger. Check the USB cable, wall adapter, and charging case for damage. It may be necessary to try a different USB cable and wall adapter. If the issue persists, call us at 1-800-SAMSUNG for additional help.\n\nAfter a long workout or music session, your earbuds are going to need a recharge. Remember, the charging case also has its own charge. Luckily, you can charge both your earbuds and case at the same time.\n\nFirst, open the earbud charging case that came with your earbuds.\n\nPlace the buds into their corresponding slots in the case. Then, close the lid.\n\nYou can charge both earbuds at the same time, or place just one in the case. Keep in mind that the battery life will differ if they are charged separately.\n\nNext, connect the charging cable to the USB charging port on the back of the charging case. Then, plug the other end of the charging cable into a power source, such as a wall outlet.\n\nPlease be aware that when the battery is completely drained, the case or buds need at least 20 to 30 minutes to turn on.\n\nYou can check the earbuds' charging status using the following methods:\n\nAndroid devices: The Galaxy Wearable app displays the buds' current battery percentage at the top of the Home tab. With newer models, you can see the battery life for both the earbuds and the charging case.\n\niPhone: When paired with an iPhone, you can check the charging status with the Buds app on an iPhone 7 or later running iOS 10 or higher.\n\nNote: The Galaxy Buds, Galaxy Buds Pro, Galaxy Buds2, and Galaxy Buds2 Pro are not compatible with the iOS Buds app.\n\nIndicator lights: You can also look at both the buds' and the case's indicator lights, so you know what's going on. See the next section to learn more.\n\nNote: Wireless charging is supported on the Galaxy Buds, Galaxy Buds2, Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Galaxy Buds+, Galaxy Buds Live, and Galaxy Buds Pro. However, this option is not available for Gear IconX."
