        "text": "Celebrate the 50th anniversary of one of the best selling albums of all time with an immersive space and musical experience like you’ve never seen before.\n\nOn February 27, 1973, EMI Records held a press conference for the debut of Pink Floyd’s new album, ‘The Dark Side Of The Moon’ at the London Planetarium. Although the Planetarium dome could only show an array of stars, constellations, and images of the cosmos while the music played, it was an unprecedented success. Fifty years later, in recognition of the iconic album (and with the help of huge strides in technology), an official fulldome experience with stunning visuals of the solar system and beyond is now available and being shown at select Planetariums worldwide.\n\nPurchase Tickets\n\n“The show itself will be divided between the 10 tracks off the album, in chronological order, each having a different theme; some futuristically looking forward and some a retro acknowledgment to Pink Floyd’s visual history, all relating to a time and space experience, embracing up to the minute technology that only a Planetarium can offer. It promises to be immersive; an all-encompassing surround sound and visual treat that will transcend reality and take you way beyond the realms of 2D experience.” For more information about the 50th anniversary and the show’s history, head over to the band’s official site.\n\nThe Dark Side Of The Moon plays as the last show of the day in our Grainger Sky Theater (3:15 pm Friday–Monday and 9:10 pm Wednesday nights) until December 31, 2024, during our public open hours. Last admission to the museum is one hour before close and there is no late seating for sky shows. Viewer discretion is advised due to the explicit nature of some lyrics. Please be advised: this show may also cause motion sickness.\n\nTickets to the show are $20, must be purchased in addition to a Museum Entry ticket or as an add-on to any museum admission package. Tickets need to be purchased online in-advance. The show is included for Adler Star Pass holders, our all access, all inclusive access pass for one year.\n\nThis fulldome planetarium show has been distributed in partnership with the International Planetarium Society (IPS).\n\nRun Time: approximately 45 minutes"
