        "text": "As discussed…when I got into Buzzcocks in 2015, I was assuming it was, you know, a dead series.\n\nThere was a fixed number of episodes, 28 series, I could see the end in sight even if there was a lot of show left to cover. It wasn’t like QI, Whose Line or Mock the Week where the goalpost kept shifting. Perhaps this is also why, to date, the Nevermind Watchdown I did was the only one I’ve actually finished.\n\nUntil now. I’m dragging this thing’s corpse back onto the ground. Cause there’s a new series, new stakes, and a new show almost. Unlike in years past, or even with Whose Line, I will be covering this show as it airs, as…I might not get the opportunity again.\n\nLike the previous bits of this watchdown, I should probably denote how things came to be. Well…it’s still not entirely certain. Sky came up with an idea to bring back Buzzcocks, got Noel Fielding back, got Greg Davies as host, and managed to get the inspired choice of Daisy May Cooper in Phill’s chair. I never thought they’d be able to get Noel again, considering how ubiquitous he’s become thanks to Bake-Off, but he’s here, even if Phill isn’t. I also know that Jamali Maddix will be the recurring panelist this season, which is fine. I initially thought he’d be the Johnny Vegas ‘regular panelist’ type, but I’ll take this. Gives some variety.\n\nWith these in place, we head to the first episode, which I am going into blindly, with only a promotional clip from Intros making its way to me. I have heard of a few of the guests- I watch Mock the Week, so of course I know Nish Kumar [I’m…not entirely a fan, but can agree that he’s a great ambassador for diversity, important issues, and being a good guy AND a comedian], and I have a vague idea of what Little Mix is, so I sort of know Jade Thirlwell. Anne-Marie I do not know, she’s apparently a coach on The Voice, and has accumulated a decent pop career over the last 4 years. So…the booking standard has risen. And will continue to, evidently, over the next few episodes.\n\nEnough buildup. Onto…the first new Buzzcocks episode in 7 years.\n\nThe cold open does bring back a number of old friends, like Abz from 5ive, Tinchy Stryder [with yet another crack at the height difference], H from Steps, and…of course…Antony fucking Costa. And…someone from B’Witched, but, again, I’m from the States, so unless they were on the show I have no idea who they are. They’re all very game, and there’s a decent bit about a society of pop-stars keeping the world in line. Greg himself sells the hell out of this. You forget he can act, but he really nails what this is supposed to be. And, of course, the bit is as self-referential and sly as the show always was.\n\nI really, really like the new opening intro. Lots of different logos on band t-shirts, indicating changing trends not stopping the appeal of the show. Or at least that’s what it’s trying to say\n\nGreg’s opening joke names a bunch of recent disasters, including Brexit, COVID, Trump and the like. “All since Buzzcocks went away. COINCIDENCE? GET READY TO HEAL, WORLD.”\n\nYeah, this is the same old show.\n\nNoel, in a Sonic Youth tee, is his old self. “To be honest, Greg, I haven’t left the studio. I’ve been frozen like Han Solo”\n\nOh MAN I missed covering him.\n\nDaisy I reckon I’m gonna warm up to, mostly cause it’s odd that someone else is sitting in Phill’s seat.\n\nNoel, on something in the intro package, to Anne-Marie: “are you really a black belt?”\n\nAnne-Marie: “yeeeah, 3-time world champion. SO DON’T FUCK WITH ME.”\n\nAnd we’re off!\n\nNish: “And what makes you think I haven’t got a karate black belt, Gregory?”\n\nGreg, delivered perfectly: “Because I’ve got eyes?”\n\nGreg, to Nish: “I changed my intro to you, cause I thought it was too mean”\n\nNish: “what was it?”\n\nGreg: “it’s that ‘he’s a comedian who once had loads of bread rolls thrown at him at a gig, but he caught them all in his mouth”\n\nNish, to his credit:\n\nNish does this a lot, actually. Honestly one of his best qualities. Nothing makes you feel better about your material than the distant sound of a cackling Nish.\n\nGreg, defending his decision: “hey, we’re all carrying a few pounds”\n\nJamali: “I saw you coming out of the dressing room with no t-shirt on and I nearly quit…”\n\nGreg: “Yeah, cause you can’t quiz when you’re turned on, that’s why…”\n\nGee, I wonder if the host of Taskmaster will be any good at improv and putting down other contestants? Unsurprisingly, Greg’s doing a great job so far.\n\nGreg, pre-games, brings up the seagull that shat on Jade’s face.\n\nJade: “I’m lucky it was a solid shit and not like a runny one…like, into my mouth”\n\nNoel: “You might have liked the taste of it! Imagine if you’d discovered it was like a nice..milkshake…”\n\nNish: “You’ve really learned nothing about cooking from Bake Off, haven’t you?”\n\nYES. Ah man, we’ve already got panel cohesion. Nish gets along with everybody, this should be easy.\n\nGreg does an ‘itchy beard’ thing in his Definitely Maybe intro. “Did you say Itchy Beard at school?”\n\nJade: “No, ‘itchy bum, ready to cum'”\n\nGreg: “…THAT’S THE NORTHEAST.”\n\nThe great thing about basing a question around Liam Gallagher is that LITERALLY ANY OF THESE COULD BE TRUE:\n\nYou can just hear Greg, Noel and Nish cracking up at these. God bless the jokewriters as well. I’ve heard Maisie Adam, of the Dip, did some work on the show. As did Lloyd Langford, former panelist, and writer, for the show.\n\nDaisy emits this subhuman, almost neighing laughing noise.\n\nGreg reads out his favorite Liam tweet: “I feel like I’ve had [covid] 7 times in the last few days…then I realized the house is just hot.”\n\nSometimes, the truth is stranger than fiction\n\nNish: “That genuinely sounds like the lyric to one of his songs…”\n\nGreg: “Did Noel slag you off?”\n\nJade: “Yeah, Noel did, which is a shame, because I am a real fan of High Flying Birds…shitting on us.”\n\nAND SHE CAN MAKE JOKES TOO! Daisy, Greg and Nish erupt in applause for this one\n\nJade, striking back: “I mean, we are the most successful girl group in the country, but he’s not the successful performer in his family.”\n\nShots fired\n\nNoel talks about the time where Noel did a twitter ‘ask me anything’ one: “so Liam just wrote ‘why are you such a c–t?”\n\nPFFFFF.\n\nIt ends up being B, and there was drinking involved. Greg: “It was all fun and games, until Frankie went lame and was immediately shot dead”\n\nOn Steven Tyler,\n\nGreg has to stop in the middle of reading A to let everyone laugh at it.\n\nAnne-Marie: “No…NO…”\n\nGreg: “Anne-Marie’s crashing in with a no…”\n\nI also love how Greg reads these. With just a tinge of irony and cracking behind it.\n\nNoel and Nish end up ruling out B and C\n\nAnne-Marie: “so you ACTUALLY THINK he got dragged into the fox’s magical kingdom?”\n\nNoel, being Noel: “I hope so…”\n\nNish: “Noel and I grew up in Croydon. That’s just what the woods are LIKE in Croydon…”\n\nGreg reveals it actually was A, even if Jamali swerves Noel towards C. And Greg reads a quote from Steven ‘justifying’ this’. Dear lord, man.\n\nThere are somehow commercial breaks in this version. Greg: “I’ve just got time to nip backstage and ride Nish Kumar around like a wild horse.”\n\nTHEN, AFTER THE BREAK:\n\nGreg: “alright, Nish?”\n\nNish:\n\nSay what you will about his actual comedy, but as a yes-ander and a panel show presence, Nish is everything you need\n\nThe way they do Intros now, the guesser has to go in the center of the stage, and the two performers get to keep the podium and do it there. While…still stagnated and separated due to the lockdown protocols. So it’s a little awkward, but…let’s see how well it works.\n\nDaisy, for Chain Reaction, does this pounding and grunting on the desk, which does clue me in that she’ll be a very funny and slightly pathetic intros round presence, maybe similar to Bill.\n\nNish: “WAS DAISY DOING A HAKA?”\n\nPFFFF\n\nGreg: “All I could hear was BOOGABOOGABOOGA.”\n\nThen…at the beginning of the next one, tragedy strikes.\n\nDaisy: “…WILLAWILLAAOOOUGHHH”\n\nAnd then, from the other side of the stage, Nish Kumar emits this…subhuman, second-long horrified chirp. Like a ‘DIT.’ So high-pitched, so trite and quick, but it sticks in the mind. I’m not sure what’s funnier, Daisy fucking up the intro or Nish making a bird orgasm noise in reaction.\n\nJade: “….the fuck was that?”\n\nThe whole place is gone.\n\nDaisy just stands by it. She’s the captain, she’s in position to do this every week, and if it’s gonna be pathetic, she’s gonna own it. She just goes “just let us do it…if you’re gonna laugh, can you just face the wall?”\n\nNish, still in mid-laughter: “I’m doing it right now…”\n\nAND SO:\n\nEVEN GREG. Nish is just obviously giggling back there.\n\nI’ve noticed that Daisy is a less democratic and collaborative intro giver than Phill or Bill. Her and Anne-Marie were both kind of doing the melody, and she was kind of hopping around. I have no idea how Jade guessed it was Girls Just Want to Have Fun, it sounded more like the backing of that one Little Mix song about potions and shit.\n\nNish, on Jamali and Noel: “I have to tell you guys, whatever mismatched 80s buddy comedy this is, I’m buying tickets for it!”\n\nJamali: “I’M TOO OLD FOR THIS SHIT!”\n\nNoel: “We’re on a stakeout, and I just got you some health food, you’re furious!”\n\nThat got me\n\nThe partition between Noel and Jamali does make intros a little more…individual, in a sense. Noel is sort of doing his bit of the song as Jamali does the drums, and is sort of cracking up through it as Jamali gives him a thumbs up and goes “just believe in yourself. Have confidence in the product.”\n\nNoel: “I’m just covering Daisy’s intro…”\n\nNish: “I mean, all I keep hearing is Girls Just Want to Have Fun by Cyndi Lauper, but I KNOW it can’t be that…”\n\nThe reveal that their first intro was MGMT’s Electric Feel…I feel like Junior Simpson. ‘THERE’S NO WAY THAT THAT’S THAT!”\n\nGreg: “There has been massive speculation on what MGMT stands for over the years, and thanks to a newly-unemployed writer on this show, I can tell you that it stands for Mel Gibson’s Massive Testicles.”\n\nJust for that, I wanna see this panel do Headliners. Greg has experience!\n\nThankfully Nish does get ‘A Message to You, Rudy’, which, if anything, seems like a throwback to Mark Lamarr. But again, it’s less collaborative, and a more sparse intro. Nobody’s doing the bass melody, everyone’s just doing the drums and the main melody. This is a very specific thing to bitch about, but this is what having that covid partition does to collaboration in this games. Yes, I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAVE IT, it just makes things very awkward. Here in the US, panel show guests are practically frenching again.\n\nThere’s a clever trivia round, called ‘Stop, Collaborate and List Them’, which involves song knowledge involving lists. If they don’t even bring up Lou Bega’s Mambo No. 5 then this game has failed.\n\nAlso, since it’s a point for each correct answer, this round works as a point booster, considering that the main rounds of the show, since like Series 22, have always been very tame.\n\nDaisy’s team gets Thank U by Alanis Morissette, which was famously ripped in a Indecipherable Lyrics round.\n\nAnne-Marie: “thank you India”\n\nNish, of course: “YOU’RE WELCOME.”\n\nRemember, he’s not an elephant, either.\n\nAnne-Marie starts fumbling phonetically through the rest of the chorus\n\nGreg: “don’t make words up!”\n\nThey clearly have a ton of trouble in this round. Daisy thinks ‘thank you, Israel’ is in there, which cracks up Jamali AND Nish [clearly not interested in thanking Israel for anything anytime soon].\n\nGreg, wrapping up the round: “I wish I could give points for Anne-Marie’s ‘THANK YOU HEEHEIIMAAEIIGHH..”\n\nGoing back to the theme of the night, Daisy’s team also get Independent Women Part 1 by Destiny’s Child. Which, at least in my opinion, is tougher than the Alanis.\n\nThey get a ton, then Anne-Marie looks right at Greg and makes up another phonetic song word, which cracks Greg up:\n\nEventually Daisy starts reciting gibberish til the buzzer. As Greg says “I think Daisy thought she was at a chicken auction halfway through”\n\nSURE ENOUGH, NOEL’S FIRST ONE IS MAMBO NO. 5. BECAUSE YOU’RE GODDAMNED RIGHT IT IS.\n\nAnne-Marie, noting the difference in easiness: “You basically want them to win”\n\nGreg: “I do not…d’you think I choose these?”\n\nThe disconnect between Greg and the material, even for a laugh, places him more in line with later eras of the show.\n\nGreg, on Mambo No. 5, “which may have been better titled…Hit Number 1…of 1.”\n\nHarsh, but funny. True to Mark Lamarr’s stuff.\n\nAnne-Marie, after Nish gets like 6 of them, is very cross.\n\nJamali: “YEAH, CAUSE DESTINY’S CHILD IS NOT A WOMAN’S ANTHEM! DESTINY’S CHILD IS SUCH A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD!”\n\nGreg says that Rick Astley “perfected the dance style ‘operating a loo'”\n\nJamali is stuck on one of the ones from Never Gonna Give You up, thinking it’s “turn around and…diss you.” He even guesses “Nish You.”\n\nGreg: “Rick Astley went for fish and chips with a mate of mine once, and asked him if he knew how big my penis was. THAT’S IT.”\n\nGreg definitely works as a host, with a mix of selling written material and his own experience as jokes.\n\nAnne-Marie: “How big is it?”\n\nGreg: “What, my penis? I’ll say this, every time I look at myself in the mirror, I always sigh…”\n\nPFFF\n\nGreg has some good lines for the N-Trance ID Parade, like “no chance”, “regrets going freelance”, and “Buffalo Stance”, which #5 just nods at.\n\nJamali: “#4 is pissed, man.”\n\nHe looks like if David Byrne smoked tobacco instead of cocaine.\n\nNoel: “he’s not happy.”\n\nJamali: “HE IS NOT HAPPY, HE DON’T WANNA BE HERE…”\n\n#4:\n\nTHEY HAVE COMEDIC TIMING ON THIS VERSION! I guess they’re a little more lax with what the ID Parade guys can do in reaction to the panelists.\n\nHell, they can actually ask them questions, and they can talk! Nish just asks them if they were in N-Trance. This is…not how the original worked. Nish even tricks #1 into revealing he was in the band. This is…different. I’m not sure how I feel about it yet.\n\nDaisy: “I love how #5 looks like he’s carrying two invisible shopping bags.”\n\nAND SHE CAN DO VISUAL JOKES TOO!\n\nAfter the reveal, Greg even names the imposters, which is kinda cool.\n\nFor Daisy’s, they got 3/4ths of Bucks-Fizz, INCLUDING CHERYL BAKER, who has been Garlicked by appearing on the panel then demoted to the ID Parade years later. Very high profile Garlicking. To any newcomers, the reason I call it a Garlicking is because the first panelist to be demoted to the ID Parade was Jessica Garlick.\n\nGreg’s name for #4, “new phone, who dis?”, sounds almost like a Tom Allen read. Which reminds me, anyone wanna bet when HE’LL be on this bloody show? I say episode 6. It’s only a matter of time.\n\nNish, of course: “GUYS, #1 IS CHERYL FUCKIN BAKER.”\n\nYou’re damn right.\n\nAnne-Marie: “WE KNOW.”\n\nNoel: ‘I MEAN, COME ON.”\n\nJamali: “#4’s angry at everything we’re saying”\n\nAnne-Marie: “I can’t tell if he’s angry, I think he’s had a lot of Botox”\n\nNUMBER FOUR:\n\nOooooooh, Bucks Fizz is about to declare war on pop quizzes.\n\nMike Nolan: “I’VE HAD WHAT???”\n\nPFFFF. This is why they can talk back.\n\nGreg: “If Anne-Marie had a fight with a potential member of Bucks-Fizz, it’d be the happiest thing…”\n\nFor some reason Daisy, quite clearly not a child of the 1970s, guesses it’s not the obvious taller, younger member of the panel. So they get that wrong. People are gonna cry sexism at the final point total of this game, but you also have to remember that Daisy’s just starting to do this and Noel’s been at it for years.\n\nSomething I’ve noticed- I think a round was cut, because all of the point totals were rerecorded in post, and don’t fit together. Maybe there was a round after the opening and before Intros that didn’t make it in.\n\nFirst one of Next Lines\n\nGreg: “shout out to my ex, you were really quite the man”\n\nALL EYES TURN TO JADE\n\nJade: “he’s…fuck.”\n\nPFFFFF.\n\nShe does get it, but cringes right after, knowing she really should have.\n\nDaisy does another phonetic gibberish answer for a Stormzy lyric.\n\nGreg: “I am NOT giving ya that!”\n\nTHEN SHE DOES IT AGAIN WITH SINGLE LADIES. Nish and Daisy just erupt in laughter as the buzzer goes.\n\nGreg: “I believe it’s meant to be, darling, I watch you when you’re sleeping”\n\nNish, bringing this round back to what it should be: “Wuhhh, I’m a dirty old man!”\n\nOverall: Yeah, that is Buzzcocks. Everything was pretty much in place, with Greg being an excellent host, Noel back in very fun form, Intros, ID Parade and Next Lines working like a charm, and some very fun panel cohesion moments thanks to Nish, Anne-Marie and Jamali. There are some elements that are still closer to the later series, like too many applause breaks, efforts to make conversation with the panelists made less organically, and some unneeded bits [we don’t always need to hear how the song should have sounded, it mostly feels like dead air now].\n\nAnd there’s also a few things I’m not entirely sold on, like Daisy as a regular, who is less outwardly funny than Phill but still a fine panel presence, and ID Parade members being allowed to talk. I’m also just not a fan about how isolated the panelists can feel at times thanks to strict COVID regulations. Again, I understand WHY we’re doing it like this, but one of the great things about the original show was panel collaboration and working together, being in the same space. It’s hard for a show to really be collaborative when everyone’s sort of separated. Also, one look at a plastic partition and I just want James Acaster to fling ice cream onto it.\n\nHowever, the show still works, it still feels relevant and has a reason to exist in 2021, and there still is an edge to how this show looks at music, portrayed perfectly in the Bucks Fizz round. Here they are, trifling with some of the institutions of british music. Look at them go. So maybe this show still has a lot to say.\n\nAs an episode in itself, this one was pretty good, if mostly fine. I could have used more from Jade and honestly Jamali, who hasn’t yet convinced me as to why he was brought on as a regular panelist. I think Nish and Anne-Marie worked really well here, and I think Greg’s gonna be a much better host than even Rhod was. I’m cautiously optimistic about this run, and hope that good things continue to come of it.\n\nBest Regular: Noel, for jumping right back into the earnest bizarreness that made him a favorite before\n\nBest Guest: Nish, for being insanely likable, and the perfect panel show presence\n\nBest Runner: Anne-Marie’s made up words.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: Well I’m not quite sure about the quality of the show since it hasn’t aired yet, but judging from the bookings, I think we’re in for a good one. Folks…this show has gotten so big that it’s booking current British musicians I’ve actually heard of.\n\nI was initially gonna wait a few more days for this. Maybe even a few more weeks. But current events have twisted my hand.\n\nI spent 2 years chronicling my first watch of this series, and then four years wrapping up this countdown. And then in the fall they’re gonna put the show back on and probably alter things beyond repair. If I don’t have this done by the time Greg Davies’ run begins, I’ll have lost the sense of finality I’d been trying to establish for four years.\n\nThe more I have time to think about whether my #2 should be my #1, or even if my #4 should be my #1, the more I’ll second-guess myself and prolong this even further. My #1 is valid, even if only I think it’s the best one they ever did. This is my list, I’m doing this mostly to please myself.\n\nAnd so…these are my picks for the Top 10 Buzzcocks episodes ever. And we’re gonna get the divisive one out of the way first.\n\n#10: S28E04\n\nHost: Rhod Gilbert\n\nCaptains: Phill & Noel Fielding\n\nPanelists: James Acaster, Nicole Scherzinger, Kerry Godliman & HarMar Superstar\n\nThe way I best describe this one is as a complete rebellion against the orchestrated, less-genuine era of Buzzcocks. Around when Simon Amstell gets there, there’s this undercurrent of ‘let’s plan things, let’s put in rounds throughout the show’ that takes away from the originality and looseness the show already has. And it carries all the way to Rhod Gilbert’s series, and I reckon it’ll carry through to Greg’s version. Good shows can exist for this model, but they’re impeding on the usual construct of the show.\n\nAnd so I say to people that there’s an episode where Rhod Gilbert, in the opening moments of the show, tries to do something like that by giving the panelists a talent portion. And it COMPLETELY BACKFIRES. James Acaster’s trick turns out to be a misnomer, and he completely flips the show on his side. Then Kerry Godliman bounces a cigarette off her nose to get things back on track, and Noel guesses Nicole Scherzinger’s trick is “peace pipe through the anus?”, and THUS…THE SHOW CAN START.\n\nALL OF THIS HAPPENS BEFORE THE SHOW OFFICIALLY STARTS. And when it does…it gets FUNNIER.\n\nJesus, I was so surprised as to how packed this show was, which is not only a testament to a great panel, thanks to Acaster, Godliman, Scherzinger and HarMar all being in good moods, but also just a series of really funny events and runners. In another show, an ID Parade segment where the panel would have to identify HarMar Superstar by his stomach would be the main highlight, and while this one is still funny [“it’s like a Weight Watchers glory hole, that”], it gets outshined by even just spontaneous moments.\n\nFirst of all…man, James Acaster brought so much to both his episodes late in this show’s run. Undeniably one of my favorite comedians, and one of my favorite Mock the Week panelists of his era, he is so at home on Buzzcocks, and is funny when he’s with the energy [“I can’t see Nicole’s face, Rhod, how’s that going down?”] AND when he’s against the energy, like the entire segment with Rhod torturing James by making him dance to George Harrison’s ‘I’ve Got My Mind Set On You’ [which is a great song, no slander here].\n\nBut then you also have a number of offhanded dynamic things, like James and Noel against Nicole, and Rhod, and then Rhod against Kerry. Within a span of a minute we get Noel talking about how he had a ginger root claw to wank with and then Rhod talking about ‘deep-beavering’ like it’s a phrase people use. And they’re runners for the rest of it, along with HarMar’s cocks for udders misnomer. This is the energy we’re working with. The oddest shit can become a running gag. The dynamic can touch anyone. Nicole Scherzinger can have a wonderful time even while looking almost uncomfortable at the level of humor.\n\nNot only that, but we keep season-long runners, like Rhod’s ill-fitting recorded intros to the opening round, and, of course, his ball-bongo tendency, which pops back up in one of the hardest laughs I’ve ever had covering Buzzcocks. Rhod does really well as a host here, and keeps bouncing off the competitors while also, and this is important, keeping the game going and not disrupting it. He’d get worse at this as it went on, but he’s great here.\n\nAll this plus so many funny things I didn’t even get to mention, especially with Phill’s team, leads to the last great Buzzcocks episode, and one of the funniest ones of the post-Simon run. Yes, people may dislike S28, but man this episode can convert even the cynics into fans.\n\nBest Moment: Rhod, after a George Harrison cue, quickly pivoting to the ball-bongos again, and NO SOUND COMES OUT. And he cracks up.\n\n#9: S18E03\n\nHost: Ricky Wilson\n\nCaptains: Phill & Bill Bailey\n\nPanelists: Bez, Jeff Green, Ryan Jarman & Colin Murray\n\nDuring the 18th Series of the show, for what was supposed to be an off-season for Mark Lamarr, the role of host was filled in with five friends of the show and also Dale Winton and Jeremy Clarkson for some reason. This was also the idea on panel stacking, putting in people who’d been Buzzcocks personnel since the beginning, like Sheila Ferguson, Kenzie, Rick Wakeman and Suzi Quattro, all of which didn’t carry over to the Simon era. So S18 was kind of a tribute to the initial run, a goodbye to a lot of Mark-era guests and factions, and a reprisal of some of his tendencies from friends of his like Jonathan Ross, Lauren Laverne, Huey Morgan and Simon Amstell.\n\nRicky Wilson of the Kaiser Chiefs, or Kaiser Chefs if you’re Michael Bolton, was in a similar category to those ones, upon being on a very spirited and fun Series 16 episode and bouncing off of Mark perfectly. So he’d be an inspired but fun choice to guest host. With Mark-era favorites like Jeff Green and Bez making their last appearances, Colin Murray being a normal, BBC-mandated booking [that paid off], and Ryan Jarman coming by thanks to his allyship with the Chiefs, it seemed like a pretty impressive panel for a lower-key success.\n\nAnd then it all, slowly began to come together.\n\nA lot of it was Ricky’s fault, honestly. You could tell he was having so much fun, slinging prompter jokes, having conversations with Colin and Ryan, and taunting Phill’s team in Intros [“you’ll soon run out of Kaiser Chiefs songs, we’ve only got one album [beat] …we’re gonna do MORE…”]. He just seemed really comfortable and happy in the chair. This was also at Ricky’s commercial peak, right after playing Live 8 in Philly, and right as the Kaiser Chiefs’ first album was a huge smash hit, and I’m glad he got on here rather than on the way down.\n\nAs far as panel energy is concerned, this was a knockout because you had easy connectors like Jeff Green and Colin Murray on here. Jeff was a standout in the early series’ of Buzzcocks because of his deadpan goofiness, and his little smirking snipes at friends Mark and Sean. This was also his last appearance on British TV before making like Ross Noble and moving to Australia, so he finished strong. Colin really surprised me, and was really dynamic the whole night. It made up for Bez’ usual grogginess, which seemed to be dialed up even more on this occasion.\n\nAnd then these huge runners started happening. First, Phill, in an I’m Rick James, Bitch! t-shirt, decides his team is gonna go the whole show without scoring any points, which involves deliberately tanking Intros [even as Bez tries to cheat], knowingly guessing an old fella for ID Parade, and just refusing to even try to score points. It’s a new tactic from the team that Mark would repeatedly hand the win to spite Bill Bailey, or Gail Porter, and it feels so freeing that it’s happening during the guest host era.\n\nThen Ryan Jarman has his famous ‘I inspired Live 8’ story, which is as knowingly funny as it is unintentionally funny. It helps that Jarman’s kind of a goof, and has this sort of rockstar in a haze character that he plays up while also living, but there’s so much of this story that is funny on its own, even without Ryan playing it up. Phill adding on with him imagining Ryan calling all the bands in his thick accent is even funnier. And without that, we wouldn’t have Ricky accidentally saying “sorry Stevie [Wonder], if you’re watching.”\n\nThe show ends with one of the funnier Next Lines of the era, with Phill divebombing the round with Kaiser Chiefs songs, even stopping Bez from doing Step On. Phill has never felt as deliberate, as chaotic, and as dastardly funny as he has here. Just him going, knowingly, “oh dear, dear” when Ricky tells him he’s gotten another Next Line wrong is so funny.\n\nAnd that’s this show. It just builds and builds on itself to the point where the entire ending is just a laugh riot, and everyone’s working together to make it so. Even Bez. So I love it for that reason, it’s one of the show’s most effective slow burns, and it’s proof that even a pretty standard host booking can pay off with the right energy.\n\nBest Moment: Phill and Jeff ending the show, and next lines, with a breathtaking Hallelujah in unison…and getting their first, and only, point of the show for it.\n\n#8: S11E09\n\nHost: Mark Lamarr\n\nCaptains: Phill & Bill\n\nPanelists: Coolio, Geoffrey Hayes, Peter Stringfellow and Kelly Llorenna\n\nSo this is the highest-ranking Christmas episode on this list. My apologies to Noddy Holder, Rick Wakeman and John Barrowman. Also, John, your fly’s down.\n\nThis one blew me away because it came at the end of what I consider as a very basic series, Series 11, and it felt like the first great Bill Bailey captain episode, after he’d taken over for Sean Hughes. For the first time, even keeping the Jimmy Cliff-Sheila Ferguson episode in mind, this team felt like a well-oiled machine. And all it took was Coolio and Peter Stringfellow to point that out.\n\nFirst off, Coolio is one of the biggest surprise favorites on this show. With a lot of people that come on, I only know their music so I judge them based on that, which led to me underestimating people like James Blunt, Peter Andre, Moby and Mark Hoppus. Coolio was like that too- I knew him from Gangsta’s Paradise and ruling the mid-90s, and for being slightly difficult at times. I thought he’d be hard to deal with on the panel. Far from it. Coolio had a lot of fun here, collaborating with Phill and Mark all night, and being really lawful, but in a very unorthodox, at times chaotic, sort of way. Coolio got the show, he got the humor, and he fit right in somehow, even on a panel with Geoffrey Hayes of all people [who also fit in, a lot more obviously]. He’d even do an episode of the ill-fated US version, which one of these days I’ll really put effort into searching for.\n\nI think the best Coolio moment of the show, other than his Rudolph’s Cracked Out Christmas song [which he rolled off with some improv as well], and him falling ass-first into a box of toys, was the slow smile of realization once he figured out that Mark was giving his team the answer for the Teletubbies ID Parade round. Just slowburn appreciation. Now he gets it.\n\nAt the other end was Peter Stringfellow, one of the most inspired and odd bookings the show ever did. Just get Peter Stringfellow! Sure! There were TONS of Peter Stringfellow jokes all night, the most of which he was able to laugh at. Mostly involving women with fake boobs and lots of sex and whatnot. Again, Bill and Phill dancing to Start the Calvary as Stringfellows dancers is just funny enough on its own, even before Coolio injures himself. And yeah, Peter, in his odd, Yorkshire-accented way, somehow fit into this madness.\n\nBut man, was Peter ill-equipped for a quiz show. Him in Intros was so funny because he was having such a tough time, and Mark was either giving him the answers or just telling him that he knew it. Mark’s mounting frustration, going from cursing to just completely obliterating a toy drum, made me laugh so hard in this episode. The entire bit where Mark, Bill and Kelly are trying to get Peter to guess Do They Know It’s Christmas [with even BILL getting frustrated on the toy piano] is just top-to-bottom funny. Because even Peter’s growing more exasperated in his not-knowing, and once he eventually guesses after Mark’s given him the answer 7 times [“oh, Let’s Feed the World at Christmas”, the immediate, angered “NO!!!” that Mark shouts back will never not leave me gasping for air. So well timed. So damned funny.\n\nThis is also probably the best use of the ‘instruments for Christmas intros’ trope, cause Bill and Kelly have a lot of fun with theirs, and…Coolio just looks really funny with his. This is also one of the first Xmas Next Lines to invoke singers, in this case carolers. First Coolio has to sing with the carolers with a bit, then Peter thinks the fifth day of Christmas involves Geese. The reason they keep bringing in singers and bands for the finale Xmas show is because this one went so well, and it’s one of the better renditions of it [though the Oompah Band and Barbershop Quartet in S15 are also really good]\n\nJust…too damned funny. Pretty much everything works here, and we’re set up for the looser and wilder remainder of the Mark & Bill era.\n\nBest Moment: Mark: “That was one of my favorite ever buzzcocks moments. Coolio offered me his ass, then fell in his toy box.”\n\n#7: S06E04\n\nHost: Mark Lamarr\n\nCaptains: Phill & Sean Hughes\n\nPanelists: Sean Lock, Marianne Faithfull, Gail Porter & Stuart Adamson\n\nOkay. Onto the hard part.\n\nThis was always gonna be high up for me. Nothing about that changed in the last 24 hours. At times I’d felt like lowering it due to the haziness of what actually happened with Gail, but it needs to be up here. There’s so many reasons why this is one of the all-time greats, and it’s just one hell of a ride from start to finish.\n\nLooking at it now, though, and seeing this panel over, it’s just good to see everyone here happy and healthy again. Sean Hughes, of course, is on a good wavelength, but look at Stuart Adamson! The Big Country and Skids frontman struggled with mental health and sobriety over his last several years, and here he seems to be A.) clean, and B.) in a really fun mood, cheerfully slagging off members of R.E.M., and smirkingly helping out Marianne with a Next Lines answer. He’s one of the cheeriest fellas on the panel, honestly, though Sean Lock is grumpy by choice most of the time.\n\nAs for Mr. Lock, this is one heck of a showcase for him. He’s on essentially cause Mark and him are close friends, but he still allows himself to have fun, especially alongside Phill. He had arguably the best joke in the show, about how R.E.M. can’t have been on Sesame Street [“one show, 3 letters! Emerson Lake and Palmer, they been on?”], and kept adding to other jokes throughout the night. Sean is also a rare comedian tasked with DOING intros, in the absence of Marianne Faithfull’s want to, so he and Phill have fun doing some, even giggling throughout. I also think he was good in his S8 episode, even if the episode itself isn’t as good all around.\n\nThen you have Marianne Faithfull, herself with renewed interest thanks to guesting on Metallica’s The Memory Remains. She enjoyed herself for the most part, but there was this sort of mystique around her, as if the 60s had sort of travelled with her. She had recollections of the Stones, and…gaffer tape, and living on a wall, and that cigarette-bruised throat did emit some laughs. The highlight is her reaching for a cigarette after ID Parade, and Mark immediately striking [“All the heroin you’ve had in your life, and I’m going “‘ey! None of that!”].\n\nAnd, of course, you have Gail Porter, pre-alopecia, post-posing on a building wall. Who was one of the first ‘bird on the left’ panelists to really strike back at Mark. I don’t think it’s as sexism as much as a litmus test for personality types [look at Jill Jackson], but some of the stuff Mark throws at Gail in this show are borderline sexist. Gail has thick skin, she takes it relatively well, but you can’t help but feel bad for her. Even if you know that Mark evidently made up with her and was putting it on, it still sort of stings when he snipes at her, and when he just BEGS her to say something mean about R.E.M. According to local insider Anthony Hobson [and again, thanks for all the help on the blog over the years, I miss a lot living over here, I truly appreciate it], she walked off at one point, being coaxed into returning for the rest of the show. This would have made her the only non-ejector seat panelist to walk off, but her having stayed does set her apart from Lemmy, Preston and Huey.\n\nIt all comes together in Next Lines, which I’ve said is the best Next Lines round they ever did. The first half is Stuart having fun, Gail v. Mark again, Gail fighting back, and Mark punishing Sean’s team by giving Phill’s four for every one they get right, even if they say nonsense words. And it just goes down this slope and coasts for the rest. Phill and Sean cracking jokes and getting points. Marianne initially protesting and eventually going with it. That entire Next Lines round is just so funny, even amid the Gail tension, and it leads to a very fun ending. How else can you explain it? Even through the bad energy, a good show, and outcome, emerges.\n\nYou can dislike this one because of the Gail stuff, that’s okay. But for me, this is a really sweet, and well-put-together show, and it’s one of the best pictures of Mark as a dominant proctor. And also, a great picture of Sean Lock in his element, which we’re seeing a lot of today anyway.\n\nBest Moment: During the points massacre on Phill’s side\n\nMarianne: “BUT THIS ISN’T RIGHT!!!”\n\nMark: “No? Oh, Marianne Faithfull, sitting there and telling ME what’s right!”\n\n#6: S23E08\n\nHost: Martin Freeman\n\nCaptains: Phill & Noel\n\nPanelists: Dappy, Charlie Brooker, Simon Bird & Martha Wainwright\n\nCan ya believe that I went this long without putting a Dappy episode on this list?\n\nLook, Dappy was one of the patron saints of the late Simon/early guest era, in that he’d come on, be incomprehensible and dumb, and the show would sort of work with him. The later eras of the show would do better with less-smart pop music types, like Stacey Solomon [who would at least laugh at herself while being pea-brained], but with Dappy, the best course of action would just be to let him be him, and…ya’know…make jokes about him.\n\nSo when Dappy came into his third and final NMTB appearance by being airlifted in with wires to his seat, probably due to his reputation as a troublemaker and wild one on the show, I was worried that after Simon Amstell’s departure, the show wouldn’t do as much to fight back at him.\n\nBut…this show did feature one of the best attempts at a guest host since Simon’s exit, and it came in the form of Martin Freeman, post-The Office, pre…everything else you know him for. On his previous appearances, Freeman proved he could dish out as well as resting on his deadpan laurels from The Office. In this appearance, he came out strong as a stone-walled, confident guest host, with everything in his arsenal to withstand even the Dappiest of obstacles.\n\nSo, before I even get to the Dappy stuff…this is just a funny show. We’re dealing with two nice panel anchors- Simon Bird on one side, filling in, allegedly, for David Mitchell [man would have have been something opposite Daps], and Charlie Brooker, yes-PRE-BLACK-MIRROR, on the other, back when he was just known for being an ass on panel shows [“I’ve jerked off 3 times under this desk”]. Noel is in great form in this one, dishing out one of my favorite picture jokes, from a Bonnie Tyler video [“Ah, there IS a man there. I thought it was just a horse…”]. There’s also a pregnant Martha Wainwright moving more than any pregnant person had ever moved on Buzzcocks since Claudia Winkleman.\n\nBut…this is the best Dappy episode because he tries the hardest to be a regular panelist in this. He does so well in Intros with Phill, doing a really nice Two Tribes one before…overdoing the second one. He tries giving Martha Wainwright a compliment which ends up revealing that he’s mistaken her for Cerys Matthews [“Noel: “You know the way Dappy came in? Can he go out the same way?”]. He tries so hard to actually play the game and do normal things, even sticking up for Soujla Boy at one point [that’s…telling], but…it gets in the way, because he’s DAPPY. He has to be outlandish and incoherent and over the top, because this is who he is. He can’t change for nothing.\n\nAnd that carries into the focal point of the show. Where Dappy makes an offhanded fat joke as an ID Parade panelist, and Phill just…walks off. My favorite part is that literally everyone knows that Phill’s playing it up except for Dappy, and Dappy is completely buying it. Martin does the best salesmanship here, just seriously going “he’s gone”, just yes-anding like mad and keeping it going. And Dappy is DEVASTATED. Just stopping the round to shout for Phill, to see if he’ll come back. What the fuck d’you think’s gonna happen? Phill Jupitus seriously walks off after a fat joke? He’s heard ’em from everybody! From Brian Molko, from Bob Mortimer, from Jeremy Clarkson!\n\nIt’s genuinely one of the funniest moments of this era. Dappy believes this so much that it turns into like a Bugs Bunny cartoon where Elmer thinks Bugs has died and we all know he’s okay. It’s so fun to watch Dappy squirm. And then Phill returns, says ‘no sweat’, and gets the right answer. And we sail on to the finish.\n\nBy the end, where Dappy is lifted back up to the top of the stage, we’ve run the whole gamut of emotions. Love, hate, laughter, sadness. And it’s so damn worth it. Definitely a top-tier gem of the guest host era, but there is one more that tops it.\n\nBest Moment: Phill walks off the show and gives the fat guy Dappy insulted a high five.\n\n#5: S20E03\n\nHost: Simon Amstell\n\nCaptains: Phill & Bill\n\nPanelists: Sam Preston, Ed Byrne, Anne Charleston, Fyfe Dangerfield, and an oil driller named Ed Seymour\n\nYou’re saying it’s too low. I know you’re all saying it’s too low. But I swear to god the top 4 are better.\n\nOkay, so even the people who barely know anything about Never Mind the Buzzcocks know about this episode. It’s the Richard Simmons episode of NMTB. Like Simmons, arguably moreso, you’d see people reference this episode for the remainder of the run. There’s a reference to this show in literally the very next entry. ‘Pulling a Preston’ and ‘Sitting in the ejector seat’ are as much a part of Buzzcocks lore as ‘that’s a great band name’ or ‘it’s not #5, it’s Athelston, he’s on every week’.\n\nWhich means, for so many people to know this one, it has to at least be a pretty good show. And it is. It’s in the Top 5. The Richard Simmons Whose Live didn’t crack my Top 10.\n\nSo, what makes this a Top 5 show? Well…like last entry, I have to make it clear that even without the central incident and panelist, it’s still a really good show. Bill’s team, of Fyfe Dangerfield and Anne Charleston, has a lot of lawful, fun stuff. Simon has a lot of fun with Anne Charleston, who is perfectly willing to talk about her character on Neighbours and have a lot of fun on the show. Just getting her was a cool idea, kinda like Bernard Cribbins or John Cooper Clarke, but she contributed a ton to the show, got the humor, and even collaborated with Simon when he brought up the ‘sad version of the Neighbours theme’. Just Bill’s team joking around about that is really funny. Fyfe himself was also in a good mood, nearly walking off himself, but in a funny, joking way.\n\nBut…that’s all really just a foundation for the actual meat of the episode, which is the Preston stuff. According to Preston!Ed, Ed Seymour, it looked like Preston was in a foul mood even before the show started. This was not the same Preston that had a lovely time on the show back in S15- he’d been on Big Brother, and become a tabloid star, and was more of that than a pop star at this point. I just think of how proper and low-key he looked in 15×01, and I compare him to the makeupped, flocked-jacketed drama queen that showed up for this episode. And with Simon in his usual cheeky mood, something was bound to happen.\n\nIf you believe the edit, you’d think that the very first Preston slam of the night set him off, and he was just unable to recover until Simon reading excerpts from Chantelle’s autobiography led him out the door. I honestly just think Preston didn’t wanna be there, and used the slam as an out. I think he liked Mark better because he wasn’t as downright personal in his attacks, and wasn’t in the line of fire like this before. Or maybe he just didn’t like what Simon had made the show into. Wait a minute, I’m editorializing, aren’t I? I’m a better writer than this.\n\nI just think Preston couldn’t be helped at this point. His ego was such that he couldn’t take any of Simon’s barbs, and there were tons [though I do note that he did agree with “you can’t go on Big Brother and get away with it”]. And so what happened a third of the way through the show was bound to happen. With Simon at the helm, and Preston where he was…he was gonna walk off eventually.\n\nAnd right there is where the show becomes a classic. Because Simon makes the decision to do the rest of the show and act LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. He has a few more jokes at Preston’s expense [I love his sarcastic “oh come on now, we can’t lose PRESTON!”], and eventually realizes that, from a TV perspective, this is a horrid idea, and needs to be fixed. Doing the rest of the show with an empty seat was unheard of, and at least Lemmy walked out during pickups.\n\nWhich is why Bill’s decision to scout the audience for someone who “look[s] a bit like Preston” is absolutely genius. It saves the show from having to do coverage and fake shots, and it gives us an even panel again. AND…AND…it’s a really funny thing to happen. Phill, Ed Byrne, and an audience member who sort of looks like the guy who just walked off, this one’s for you.\n\nAnd so the rest of the show happens with Ed Seymour brooding in Preston’s place. He’d said in an interview that he was so bewildered by the whole thing that he didn’t say much, and barely even reacted to Simon’s interacting with him. The crowning moment of this is Simon asking him what the intro was, seeing that he’s completely amazed, and going “how weird is this for you?”. I give Simon a lot of shit, at times wrongfully, but the best thing he did this show was treat Ed!Preston really well, and along with Ed and Phill, make him feel comfortable enough despite the oddness of what was going on. At the end of the day, they’re trying to get a show out, trying to make everyone feel good. That spreads to even the audience members…when they come onstage in place of the panelists. I love that everyone still interacted with him and made him feel welcome, complete anxiety-induced shutdown notwithstanding. And yeah, in the end Ed!Preston got to sit on Simon’s lap as they cut to the empty seat as the Neighbours sad music played in.\n\nIt’s just a phenomenal show, man. Bill has one of his best showings in going into the audience to find a replacement Preston. Simon keeps the jokes rolling despite an international crisis on set. The show does not suffer without Preston, and the incident fuels the comedy for the rest of the show. Sometimes it’s a little light on Phill’s side other than Ed!Preston, but that’s a very small quibble.\n\nIt’s a classic, undeniably. The thing I can’t believe, though, is that it’s following an episode that’s even better.\n\nBest Moment: Simon: “I didn’t even finish the quote from the book!”\n\nPreston!Ed: “That’s out of order!”\n\n#4: S24E12\n\nHost: Frankie Boyle\n\nCaptains: Phill & Noel\n\nPanelists: Professor Green, Michelle Williams, Miles Jupp & Goldie\n\nThe story so far. Frankie Boyle’s been on NMTB 3 times. All 3 made the Top 20. This one is #4. Knowing me, are any of you shocked?\n\nReally, this show was my intro to Buzzcocks. I watched this one before I started the Watchdown, and it hooked me. I already adored Frankie, and Phill, and i needed to see this in context. I spent the whole Watchdown looking for shows better than this one. Thankfully, there were 3. But man oh man, this one’s just good.\n\nI’ll say it again, Frankie Boyle just seriously works as the host of this show. He knows a lot about music, he can needle any panelist, and his sense of humor would make Mark Lamarr smirk. Let it be known that he even got one of Simon Amstell’s old prompter jokes, the World AIDS Day gag from S19, as well as several more Cheryl Cole, Wayne Rooney and sex jokes. He was so in his element here that he seemed to have a leg up on everyone, even causing bile to pile up in Phill’s throat during Next Lines. He definitely had a leg up on Miles, who knew him from panel shows and could be undone by him anyday.\n\nThe best stuff came at the expense of both members of Noel’s team. He had SO MUCH FUN with Professor Green, in the first of his multiple appearances on the show [all of them great], and Prof even had thick skin about it. Frankie installed a friggin RAP BATTLE BUTTON on the show, leading to really funny moments all night [Prof had the best: “That was funny and there’s no question, but I’m not leaving cause I’m not Preston”]. Prof was a great panel presence, and good at Intros, but spent most of the show laughing his ass off. As did Goldie, now that you mention it.\n\nThe one person who seemed ill-prepared for Frankie Boyle was Michelle Williams. I honestly think Frankie got the best Michelle joke out of the way early, with “she’s one of the most famous and beautiful women in the world….’s friend…”, leading Michelle to bewilderedly ask “what did I sign up for??”. Michelle has a very America-centric view of good TV humor, and the fact that Frankie, and Noel, could pull all of this off here seemed to really floor her. There’s like 20 shots of Michelle just reacting to things that happen, usually looking really concerned or ashamed. I do think she did enjoy herself overall [as her former bandmate Kelly Rowland did], but man the culture shock must have been painful.\n\nThe single best line of this show, which I’ve probably quoted before is,\n\nFrankie: “Dappy, he seems like a muppet…”\n\nProf: “that’s not very nice…”\n\nFrankie: “I’m not a very nice man.”\n\nMichelle: “That’s not true, I think you are a nice man…”\n\nFrankie: “Well, watch this…”\n\nThat’s Frankie in a nutshell. “Well, watch this,” [goes right into another dirty joke]. At least Prof saw it coming. Kelly just got better at dealing with it over time. And hell, Noel had fun with it too, with his little Fraggle Rock bit, and trying to convince Michelle “fingering’s quite old-fashioned”. This is also the last Noel captain show on the countdown, and man is this a great showcase for the guy. I’m excited to see what else he’s got left in the revival.\n\nReally, there’s not a lot about this show that’s big or bombastic or throws this episode into the highest gear, it’s just…a really well-run, and insanely funny, episode of Buzzcocks. It’s the best Frankie show, and it’s one of the funniest shows they put out, in an era where they were still searching for an identity. This is one of those shows that gets pieced up on Youtube a lot, and deservingly as well. It just works, and it never ceases to make me laugh.\n\nBest Moment: Noel, reading the first intro: “This is shit pop. This is music that makes me want to kill myself.”\n\nMichelle: “Noooo, life is worth living.”\n\nPhill, from across the room: “MICHELLE, FRANKIE…FRANKIE, MICHELLE…”\n\nNoel: “It is cool hanging out with you, it’s like being on an episode of Fraggle Rock. ‘HEY, NOEL, PUT DOWN THE CRACK PIPE. LIFE’S GREAT, EVERYBODY!”\n\n#3: S04E01\n\nHost: Mark Lamarr\n\nCaptains: Phill & Sean\n\nPanelists: Bill Bailey, Chris Moyles, Vic Reeves & James Broad\n\nNever Rewind the Buzzcocks, which was released at the end of Series 3, was a capper on the first three series of the show, as well as sort of a farewell to the era. It featured three well-relied-upon guest stars, Jonathan Ross, Math Priest and Noddy Holder, none of which would recur to the level they had to this point, as well as sort of saying goodbye to Shovell, Graham Norton, and, temporarily, Richard Fairbrass. I mention this because it was very much a dividing line, a statement, a marker of what had been to this point.\n\nWhich means the episode following that one would have to be a bold statement, one that would guide the show into the next stage, which I’ve been referring to as its first golden age.\n\nYeah, mission accomplished.\n\n4×01…may be the single most important show of the entire run. It establishes so much that’s going to define the rest of the show’s run, and it also exist thanks to the continuity of other shows. Going into this show, I had no knowledge of Mark’s exploits on Shooting Stars, and his rapport with Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer. I would say that it helps to frame this episode, but I adored this episode, and Mark’s payback, even before I knew what ‘OHHH, 50’S THROWBACK! 50’S THROWBACK!’ meant.\n\nSo, this entire show is Mark screwing with Vic for all that Vic did to Mark on SS. Mark literally goes back and finds a pressing of an album Vic cut in his early 20s, a fucking experimental techno album, and gives the lead single, called ‘Health and Danger’ [NOT, as the episode would have you believe, ‘Fantasia’], to the control room guys, telling them to play it, and the ‘dance version’, whenever he sees it fit. It is very much the equivalent to Wayne recording ‘MYASS, MYASS, MYASS, MYASS’ over Drew’s tape recorder on Whose Line, but this show is all payoff, and hitting the payoff over and over. Vic’s reaction to hearing this song goes from squirming, to laughing, to smiling, to gritting his teeth, to singing along with the rest of the gang. And just hearing this song, and the cue of it, or even Sean going ‘OOOOHHH TIII KOOOBA’, is funny. This is a merciless running gag, and Mark keeps hitting it because, genuinely, he feels that Vic deserves it for making him play the fall guy for all these years.\n\nVic thankfully can dole it out as well this show, and is a very fun panel presence alongside Sean [though arguably he’d do better during his later appearances], but man it’s so much fun to see him as the victim this time. And Mark has SO MUCH FUN WITH IT over the course of the show.\n\nEqually important, this is the first Buzzcocks appearance of one Bill Bailey, who’s seated next to Phill for the only time. Clearly the two get along famously, and their intros together are really fun. Their ‘Dance the Night Away’ is great, and their ‘Paranoid’ is great. I also love Bill breaking into ‘Deutschland Uber Alles’ after Sean says that Phill’s team has the colors of the german flag. He fits right in here, and though 5×07 would be a more formal audition for a captain spot, this one is a great showing for Bill, especially alongside Phill.\n\nAnd then…we have Chris Moyles. For anyone who started on Buzzcocks after this one and wondered why Mark had such a grudge against Moyles…this is why. Moyles seems progressively out of his element on the show, with none of his jokes getting response, getting zero intros [leading Vic to ask “Chris, have you ever heard any music?”], and just looking miserable as Mark puts on more and more insults his way. Moyles, as much as he’d complain, wasn’t right for the show because he wasn’t at the point yet where he could laugh at himself. As he reminds us in Intros, he’s only 24, but the ego he had then, and would build in the 2000s, could not withstand a program like Buzzcocks. Maybe if 2021-era Moyles did it, he’d come off a little better, but Moyles was just not the right fit, especially for a panel alongside Bill and Phill. So everything that came after this episode is pretty justified, honestly. He didn’t work on the show, then blamed the show for not working. Serves you right.\n\nThis one just flows on by beautifully, with the Health and Danger needle drops even going into the ID Parade for ‘There’s No One Quite Like Grandma’ [which Mark winces at right before, “for the audience only, here’s a little snatch”]. Mark’s in complete control, Sean’s having loads of fun with James and Vic, Bill and Phill get on so well together, and Moyles somehow gets out of there alive. It’s the fullest portrayal of the early era of the show, the first true moment of Mark being in complete control of the proceedings, and it lays the groundwork for the rest of the run.\n\nAll together now, HEEEEALLLLTH AND DAAAAAANGER…\n\nBest Moment: Vic: “Chris…have you ever heard any music?”\n\nPhill: “I’ll tell you what, Vic Reeves, and I know one tune that Chris Moyles HAS heard, and I think it’s this!”\n\nHEEEEEALLLTHHH…\n\n#2: S20E02\n\nHost: Simon Amstell\n\nCaptains: Phill & Bill\n\nPanelists: Noel Fielding, Alfie Jackson, Philip Oliver & Donny Tourette.\n\nThis was the one I kept going back and forth in my mind about switching it to #1. But I couldn’t. I loved my #1 so much I couldn’t do it. But you understand my hesitation.\n\nWhen I was rounding out the Watchdown, I was scouring Youtube for other random stuff, related material, better rips, something like that. And I came across somebody’s camcorder footage of…like, an interview that a couple of college kids [I think] were doing with Phill in 2007, like clearly in someone’s studio or backstage or something. And it’s clear that Phill’s doing this out of charity, or to prep for a gig. And a lot of it is very Chris Farley show, like ‘d’you remember when Dom Masters came on and Mark tore into him? That was great, wasn’t it?”\n\nAnd Phill did use that to go “well I don’t know when this is going out, but we just taped, very recently, a show with Donny Tourette off of Towers of London, and it goes even bigger than that.”\n\nHow d’you think that felt in 2007? You know that episode you really like? There’s one coming that’s EVEN BETTER. It’s like the Whosers hearing about the Robin Williams show. Like, if you got just a taste, how would that feel? You knew the Donny Tourette show was coming before it hit. Also, I need to rewatch that interview, because maybe it was done before the Preston episode, cause this episode was DIRECTLY BEFORE THAT ONE.\n\nThink about that. Donny Tourette show, break, Preston show. Consecutive gems. This is why I love Series 20 so much, and why I think it’s the peak of Simon’s era on the show. He finds his groove, rolls out some classics and then coasts. And those classics, especially 20×02, are worth it.\n\nOkay, so Donny Tourette is the biggest bulldozer of chaotic energy this show’s ever seen, including Dappy. Dom Masters at least played the game, and was just a bit of a dick. Donny Tourette barely tries to play the game, and does so badly [I refer you to the Prince round, where he fucks up a 19.99 joke AND has the incomprehensible guess of ‘did his helmet turn blue?’]. He also tries making fun of Bill [“I shall explain- Bill is a professional comedian…you won’t WIN!”], smoking [“WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO NEXT? A cigarette…that you can LEGALLY BUY IN SHOPS!”], and nearly walks off only to grope Simon on the way back. They even play in a clip of his show, which is self-promotion disguised as lampooning [I recall Farage trying something similar on HIGNFY].\n\nLuckily, Simon responded with his single best episode as host, and shut him down at every moment, just needling him all night and having so much fun with it. The biggest bit was about Donny’s stance as a ‘punk’, and proving this by doing very non-punk things, like wearing sunglasses in doors or shitting on the Sex Pistols, or…smoking a cigarette. While Simon’s Buzzcocks was definitely a purveyor of pop rather than rock, he still knew enough about what punk represented, and what punk really meant. And he knew that Donny was a fake punk who only stood for the debauchery of it and not the actual social justice, anti-establishment and especially GOOD MUSIC parts of punk [though…okay, a lot of LA punk wasn’t exactly GOOD]. So he basically tried, as much as possible, to illuminate to the audience that Donny was either a punk poser or just a really terrible punk. And it worked. Within a few years, Donny was relegated to the reality show circuit, and flamed out. Was this show responsible? Probably.\n\nBut oh my god, the whole show was just having so much fun with him. Simon stealing his glasses and doing his little ‘punk’ hand move [“and NOW I’m cool..”]. Simon and Phill making fun at him as he’s left the show. Simon taking the immortal scraggly looking ID Parade guy [Simon’s answer to Athelston] and making HIM wear the shades. Simon doing a prompter joke at Donny’s expense without him EVEN KNOWING IT. Meanwhile, Noel Fielding had a great first time out with Bill, Phillip and Alfie had solid nights joining in on the fun, and both Bill and Phill were strong, really excellent foils for the comedy going on to Simon’s right. Though, admittedly, most of the best lines of the show came from Simon, who just kept delivering the entire show, right up until Donny’s angered by his team losing by a point [Bill: “yeah, smash the system, but can we have a point please?”]\n\nIt’s wall-to-wall brilliant, and one of the best takedowns of something happening within music the show did. Simon had never been stronger, and the show had never had more dignity. All it took was someone with none, and an iconic episode was born.\n\nBest Moment: Donny: “Here’s what I think of you” (grabs crotch)\n\nSimon: “Really? You think of me…as a small penis? WELL, I NEVER!”\n\nOkay. Everybody breathe in. Breathe out. Remember that this is just one poor fella’s opinion.\n\nNow, here’s what I think is the best Buzzcocks of all time.\n\n#1: S09E09\n\nHost: Mark Lamarr\n\nCaptains: Phill & Sean\n\nPanelists: Kiki Dee, Mike Wilmot, Phil Alexander and Richard Fairbrass\n\nNow, let me explain.\n\nNever Mind the Buzzcocks has come to be an institution, a guardian over music itself. With Simon and the guest hosts, it was specifically a pop music quiz, and came to reflect the trends of pop in that time. With Mark Lamarr, it seemed like that from the outside, but the show itself had the same ideologies as Mark himself- the classics, including Motown, R&B, soul, reggae, gangsta rap and country, are good, while the new, artificial pop is bad. It is the cynic’s approach, and the stubbornness that Mark took with him all those years on the radio, that’s now carried to his Twitter.\n\nSo, with that said, Buzzcocks only nominally felt like a beacon of rock music. Yes, rock figures like Alice Cooper, Meat Loaf, Slash, Dave Mustaine and Lemmy would be welcome there, but it never specifically felt like it was curating the best of solely rock music. Mark liked rock, but he liked Jimmy Cliff more than he liked Jimmy Page. He never seemed to be too snobbish of the direction rock was going in the 2000s [nu-metal], and while he’d poke fun at people like Dani Filth, and Mudvayne…he never really challenged the factions of the genre.\n\nWell…that is until he and the producers decided to put Phil Alexander, then the editor of the protector of hip-and-cool rock music Kerrang!, on a panel…with Richard Fairbrass. The guy who sang ‘Deeply Dippy’. This would be one fun ride.\n\nAnd so this episode was. Oh my god it was.\n\nI’ll mention the other panel briefly, which is still really good, cause it’s Kiki Dee doing intros with Phill [“It’s like a porno version of Sesame Street. ‘AND TODAY’S SHOW IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY KINKY D.”], and it’s Mike Wilmot on Phill’s left. Mike was a reliably funny choice for comic panel fodder, and this was his best showing, as the gravelly Canadian worked well off of Phill, and honestly Fairbrass, in the same way Eddie Brill had in that chair before. Phill and Kiki’s intros round to Mike was a really good one, even if Kiki didn’t seem to really know Plug In Baby by Muse [one of my favorites]. Kiki even has a fun moment in Next Lines where she gets the answer about a second after Mark says it…and he gives her a point.\n\nBut the reason this is #1 is the other panel. Richard, Sean and Phil. Oh man.\n\nSo this was Richard’s first Buzzcocks since the Lemmy show, which was referenced [Richard even goes “I moved house and you never got my new address…”]. And it’s like no time has passed. Richard is his usual, giggly, flirtatious self, having great chemistry with Mark, and not being afraid to throw in some gay jokes. But because they’ve done this so many times, Sean and Phill are more prone to join in. Sean has a great bit about shagging a hamburger, which is nowhere near being rimmed by a toblerone but hey. Mark even played into the tension, almost kissing Richard until an audience member revolted [“I think they meant ‘UGGHH, HE’S GONNA KISS MARK!’]\n\nThe reason Fairbrass works so well on this show is that he’s not afraid to play up his own bisexuality, and he just sort of comes off as this camp, knowingly camp, sort of beacon of jokes and fun energy. He gets along so well with Mark, even if Mark acts like he can’t stand having him on. And he can work off of pretty much anybody. He’d be on twice more after this show, but neither would be quite as funny as this one, honestly.\n\nAnd then we have Phil Alexander. Who was editing Kerrang!, and who was in charge of curating exactly what rock music should be, circa 2001. And by this point, rock music had become Staind, Korn, Puddle of Mudd, POD, Sum-41 and Fuel. Not a lot of truly timeless bands. And Phil came on to defend the status of rock, saying that Limp Bizkit had opened the doors for so many new artists [Sean: “THEY’RE DOORMEN NOW??”], playing up Muse, and defying the old adages of rock, responding to a shooby-dooby fied intro with “Oh, it’s that old guy, is it?”\n\nSee, Phil was acting like a gatekeeper of what music should be, on a show ran by Mark Lamarr. To quote that stale LeftatLondon meme, “hahahaha…*I* DO THAT”\n\nSo Mark had an entire plan in place to humiliate Alexander for selling nu-metal and pulpy crap disguising as rock to the masses as the new direction of the genre. He fitted the studio with shock lighting, and wired a button with castle thunder, and gave himself a voice modulation pedal, and would constantly use this lightning crackle to play up Phil’s over-reliance on the absence of rock being rock. At the first easy Posh Spice joke out of Phil, he set off the lightning and went “THE VOICE OF ROCK”. Drawing a line for the rest of the show.\n\nTo Phil’s credit, he did have a wise eye about it, going “Should we swap roles? Maybe I’ll do the camp bits and you’ll do the metal” to Fairbrass, but that was never gonna be the end of it. No matter how game Phil was, he was always going to be the butt of the jokes. In a genre of titans, you hawk Papa Roach? How dare you?\n\nAnd so the castle thunder kept going for the entire show. Popping up in Intros [“STRANGERS IN THE NIIIIGHT”], in desk bits [“I’ve gotta get this setup at home, for whenever me mum calls. I’LL TELL YOU, MUM, WHAT I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS…AND YOU WILL BUY IT!”], all throughout Next Lines [literally sounding it whenever Sean’s team got one right], and at the very end of the show [him smirking while modulated-ly saying ‘good night’ is such a funny final visual]. By the end of the night, Phil was completely lambasted, and wouldn’t last much longer as editor in chief, eventually being moved to a global position.\n\nThe Man, 0, Buzzcocks, 1\n\nThis was, aside from the debauchery and lightning and buttsex, a fantastic show. Fairbrass was a great Intros presence as always, Next Lines was a lot of fun with this runner, everybody got along, and the Dance Crazes round even worked thanks to some zeal from Phill. This was also a prominent, strong moment for Mark as host, and everything he threw at Richard and Phil came from this dominance, albeit relaxed dominance, that had grown in the last 3 series.\n\nThis may not be everyone’s favorite, but by god, it’s one of mine. I laughed my ass off when I first saw this one, rewatched it a million times, and now am proclaiming it MY #1 Buzzcocks episode of all time. It may not be yours, and it may not even be in your #10…but it’s my #1.\n\nAnd I’m sticking with that. At least until somebody makes a better one. And at this rate, that may never happen.\n\nThanks for sticking with me to the end of this, everyone. I’m still running down Whose Line on this blog, and am starting the 2nd series of Mock the Week relatively soon. And I reckon I’m gonna cover the Sky Buzzcocks shows on here when they come out. The countdown may be over, but the show goes on.\n\nThe reason it’s been so long since the last one of these is that I became very worried that the list I put together back in 2017 or whatnot doesn’t really reflect my opinions of the best shows anymore. I’ve gotten impostor syndrome, I think. Looking at my favorites from the run, going ‘was that really so great?’\n\nAnd then I was thinking today, about how strong the Top 5 really are, and about how an unfinished list means nothing to no one…and so what the hell. The new one’s out in the fall, let’s at least get through this one before then.\n\nThere’s 20 spots left, two posts worth. Lots of classic shows are in this post alone, and all of them belong here. So let’s get cracking with a fella I’m now covering on this blog anyway\n\n#20- S23E11\n\nHost: Frankie Boyle\n\nCaptains: Phill & Noel Fielding\n\nPanelists: Reverend Jon McClure, Richard Herring, DJ Ironik & Carol Vorderman\n\nFrankie Boyle is one of those NMTB figures that only touched gold while on this show. He was on 3 shows, all 3 of them are in the Top 20. Maybe it’s because I really, really like Frankie as a comedian, maybe it’s because all 3 shows are just really good.\n\nMostly, it’s due to the fact that as a blunt humorist, off-the-cuff deadpanner and casual shit-talker, Frankie Boyle may have been the closest NMTB ever got to recapturing the spirit of Mark Lamarr. I said this recently about his MTW castmate Russell Howard, and while Russell was a very competent, quick and dangerous host for this show, he doesn’t hold a candle to what Frankie could do. Not only could he proctor a strong show, but he had shit to sling at all 4 panelists, as well as Michael McIntyre for old time’s sake.\n\nThere was also this looseness and rapport between everybody that had also kind of been absent since Mark had left. Frankie was an active participant in the show’s rounds, especially Intros, being just as receptive and even mean as Mark would. He also was just as strict, deducting points from Phill for making an Ian Paisley joke during a Pope Next Line, and ripping on bad guesses [“What’s happened here is when I’ve told you you’re very close, you’ve decided to guess at something from a totally different world.”]. I think he studied the old tapes and knew exactly what he needed to do, without changing much of his usual demeanor.\n\nThe show itself was also pretty strong. Phill’s team, of Jon McClure and Richard Herring, was a lot of fun, and had a lot of really fun exchanges [for Jerk it Out, “i’ll give you a clue, it’s like what you might do after watching a Kelis video” “Is it…Whiter Shade of Pale?”]. Herring is also just one of the best semi-regular guests of this era, and gave into the panel show formula when comedy partner Stewart Lee seemed embarrassed by it all in 19×03. Carol Vorderman was also a fine panel presence, though the panel had a lot of fun with her and Countdown jokes. The most notable line of the episode is Frankie shitting on her. She takes it all well.\n\nThis one’s as good as it is because even mired in the hit-miss Guest Host era it feels as consistent as any Mark Lamarr era show, and it’s just as funny as many of them. Though, admittedly, it is the weakest of Frankie Boyle’s three appearances on the show.\n\nBest Moment:\n\nCarol: “what’s your name on Facebook?”\n\nFrankie, very bluntly: “….Frankie Boyle.”\n\nCarol: [grins and bears it as the response comes in]\n\nFrankie: “To be honest, Carol, I heard you were smarter than this…”\n\n#19: S21E09\n\nHost: Simon Amstell\n\nCaptains: Phill & Bill Bailey\n\nPanelists: Christopher Biggins, Sam Duckworth, Robyn & Mark Watson\n\nI’ve been vocal about this on here, but I’m still not the biggest fan of the Simon Amstell era. I think he has some definite high points, and I think that S20 of the show is one of the most consistent ones in the show’s history, but I still think a lot of what he did was too mean, and too snipey, compared to what Mark Lamarr did. Mark was tuning out towards the end, but at least he had some respect for the show. In Simon’s final two seasons, he was more interested in probing the contestants and creating bits, a lot like on Popworld, than actually continuing the ‘game’ of NMTB.\n\nAnd that’s why I kinda turned off of him around S21. A lot of the shows in this era just kind of happened, and needed to have an artificial hook to be relevant. It’s James Lance! Have a pint with James Nesbitt! Anthony from Blue sucks! It gets old after a bit.\n\nWhich is why it felt so refreshing when a lot of the humor in this episode came natural from its contestants and players. All you need is to get Christopher Biggins laughing and we’re off.\n\nSort of like Barrowman, I take back some of the immense praise I heaped upon Biggins on this show, thanks to his contemporary dislike of bisexuals and very closed-minded elder-gay thinking. But…none of that really comes up here, and they just keep him rolling and enjoying himself. And yes, several times throughout the show we do hear that immortal Biggins laugh, mostly because Phill, Sam and Simon just kept needling him throughout the show. He’s a perfectly lawful panel presence, gets the show, and gets the very loose vibe about it. And thank the gods that the show got him as well.\n\nAnd then on the other side, you have Robyn. A few years away from ‘Dancing On My Own’ and touring with Katy Perry, as well as mainstream success, but still an international star. I think she eventually got the hang of the fun Simon and Phill were poking at her, but man, I have no idea if she was prepared for the barrage of jokes that came her way. Simon and Bill were cracking jokes about the font on her website’s homepage, and then THE WHOLE PANEL was riffing on her and her cage-fighter boyfriend. The contrast of her against Biggins, and pitting those two against each other almost, led to some of the best comedic moments of the show. Robyn can crack a joke, but the humor went on against her, rather than WITH Biggins.\n\nAside from that, you have some really funny stuff in ID Parade, and a lot of very loose stuff all around [Phill yelling NO SHOWTUNES at Biggins and Simon responds “ah, you’re like Christopher’s father, there, shouting at him. NO SHOWTUNES, BOY, YOU WILL PLAY FOOTBALL”.] Simon does really work as a proctor here, even though there are a few too many extraneous rounds interrupting usual ones. And like a lot of this season, Phill shines.\n\nJust a great picture of the height of this era of NMTB.\n\nBest Moment: The entire cage-fighter conversation. Pretty much everybody got in on it. Robyn was dying laughing by the end.\n\n#18: S05E04\n\nHost: Mark Lamarr\n\nCaptains: Phill & Sean Hughes\n\nPanelists: Melvin Aday, Billie Piper, Nick Keynes & Rowland Rivron\n\nIn the infancy of this project, I’d scroll through the Wikipedia list of episodes and look for the people I’d heard of, and the exciting bookings that’d come in the future. There were some guests I was very excited for on name recognition alone, like Slash, Alice Cooper, Dave Mustaine, Amy Winehouse and Frankie Boyle. And then there was this curious one around Series 5, one that I had to triple-take to believe.\n\nMeat Loaf…and Rose Tyler. On the same panel. Jeepers.\n\nMeat I understood. You know, music star of the 70s, would gladly come to the UK to do a show, plus he’d done the collab episodes with HIGNFY and TTIAO, so he’s no stranger to this circuit. And, and this is very important, Meat Loaf can laugh at himself. I’d seen his SNL episode he did with Tim Curry, I’d seen him in Wayne’s World, I’d seen him do Celebrity Apprentice and plead desperately to get some money for his charity that helps kids in need. He’s not entirely jaded and incapable of self-awareness.\n\nBut…Billie Piper…as an American who only knew her from Doctor Who, I had no idea looking into her that she’d had a pop career in the late 90s/early 2000s, and had a relationship with Chris Evans, and then had to reestablish herself as an actress to play Rose. Talk about having a very US-based view of things.\n\nThe episode itself pretty much delivered on those. It helps that we were in the midst of Buzzcocks’ first golden age, Series 4 through 6, and Mark, Phill and Sean were all on hot streaks. It also helps that this was two shows since Athelston’s first appearance. Mark has some high-tier barbs all around here, having lots of fun with Meat and Billie [“I’m Mark Lamarr, and if loving Billie is wrong, I don’t want to…go to prison”], and even screwing with friend Rowland Rivron [“THIS IS NEXT LINES, NOT WARN THE VILLAGERS!” always gets me].\n\nMeat himself also surprised me for being very game with the proceedings, including an extended bit during the first round where he attempts to call Snow in order to get the lyrics of Informer. Like Frankie, I think he watched some tape and got a sense of what the show was. Also, might I also say that he was excellent in Intros with Phill, with both doing great work. This also led to the first three-man Intro, with Mark joining in to provide the ‘AAAH-AAAAAH’ in Fun Boy Three’s ‘The Lunatics are Taking Over the Asylum’.\n\nThe main throughline of this show was one of Mark’s first ever ‘I’m giving the girl points because she’s hot’ sort of runners. He’d done this for a sense with Louise in S2 [more on that later], but with Billie he made it a point, because of how much of a stunner she was in the press. He’d try something similar with Gail Porter, but that wouldn’t go as well.\n\nStill, it comes together as a great early-era show, and probably S5’s best show, which says something, knowing the quality of that season.\n\nBest Moment:\n\nMark: “Vindaloo, Vindaloo, Vindaloo, Vindaloo”\n\nMeat: “Burn burn burn, and the ring of fire went down down down”\n\nMark: [bursts out laughing]\n\n#17: S28E03\n\nHost: Rhod Gilbert\n\nCaptains: Phill & Noel\n\nPanelists: Sara Pascoe, John Cooper Clarke, Amelia Lily and Alex Brooker\n\nHaha, now another opportunity for me to defend Series 28! It’s got a brilliant start! Rhod has some great moments throughout! Adam Ant and Glen Matlock came back! Ball bongos! There’s some gems in there despite a definite dropoff in the second half.\n\nA lot of people really don’t like this series, but it actually accomplishes a lot, and a lot more than I predict the Sky version is going to. Phill and Noel are still pretty much in good moods, the standard of booking is a bit more homogenized to other BBC shows but still good, and it just leads to inspired, gonzo moments like this one. Here, John Cooper Clarke’s been doing a lot of panel shows, let’s have him on here.\n\nMan, JCC completely revitalized this show in a way I was not expecting. It’s slightly similar to Howard Marks when he was on, though JCC was a bit more into the show. But he was just very good at yes-anding and jokingly connecting with people for jokes and lines throughout the show, in a way that people had rarely showed up like on the show. He was honestly similar to Harry Shearer when he was on, just sort of having fun with the idea of the show and bouncing off his fellow panelists. And man was this a receptive panel for him. I think his biggest laugh was at the end, where he allowed Noel’s team to overtake his, saying “I’m only here for the company”. The whole place lost it there.\n\nThere was also a really savage runner about Billy Idol’s Dancing with Myself, about how it’s a euphemism for masturbation, and the number of songs about Dancing that could also apply to that [Rhod: “dancing with tears with my eyes probably makes more sense…”]. I swear to god it goes through the entire episode, even through Robbie Williams’ dad’s later appearance, and it just keeps cracking the whole room up. Hell, most of this episode is a laugh riot for everyone involved. Either a John line, or something in intros, or anything can set the place off completely. We’re talking high levels of Jupitus giggling. You also had Noel and Phill bouncing off of the very Northern Amelia Lily, Alex Brooker cracking jokes, and Sara Pascoe being excellent at intros once again\n\nEven better, Pascoe was part of one of the sweetest moments on the show, being part of the ID Parade for Robbie Williams’ dad, seeing if he could recognize his old backup singer. Something kinda wholesome about him getting it right after all those years.\n\nThis episode features the best spirit, and best energy, of S28, and some of Rhod Gilbert’s best tendencies as a host. But it is NOT the best show of Series 28. That comes a bit later.\n\nBest Moment: Pete, proving he’s Robbie Williams’ dad: “i was there for the conception. It was a nice night, I was…dancing in the dark.”\n\n#16: S06E07\n\nHost: Mark Lamarr\n\nCaptains: Phill and Sean\n\nPanelists: Brian McFadden, Vic Henley, Jamie Benson & Mary Byker\n\nThis was an episode I passed by for a while. Wasn’t convinced of its all-and-all worth. Wasn’t even on this list the first time I made a draft of it 4 years ago. And then I checked back on it for a video project for, and I guess I can reveal this, the youtube channel I run. And I looked at it from the standpoint of Series 6, and also the 4 to 6 golden age area. And I realized…dang, this one’s not only good, it’s one hell of a statement.\n\nThe first six series’ of the show, Mark Lamarr was skirting by on his Shooting Stars cred mostly, and he’d had that sort of character of ‘the 50s throwback’, the slick, full-of-himself nostalgia connoisseur who was there to be stepped on rather than to fully charge. And then around S6 he starts really firing back, first at Arthur Smith [who he’s friends with, so he totally CAN], and then at Gail Porter [who we will get to]. But even then, he’s still very much the character he was on Shooting Stars, and it’s holding him back.\n\n6×07 is the turning point. A guest is so infatuated with Mark’s 50s Throwback Coif that it becomes the running gag of the show. If you wanted to know why he buzzed it off for S7 and went towards his eventual short, messy hair for the rest of the run [along with the end of the sharp suits], this episode would fill you in.\n\nAgain, it won’t look like much for a while. Some odd energy from Mary Byker from Apollo 440, him pulling out a Mark Lamarr wig almost to taunt him [“TURN MARY’S MIC OFF”], who just seems like an early edgelord whose cheek outdoes his usefulness on the show [see also: Chandrasonic from a few shows later]. Some awesome early jokes from the late Vic Henley, a comedian I always liked on this show, and always stuck around for fun occasions [see also the Darius show].\n\nAnd then around intros, Brian McFadden, then a Westlife standout, started loosening up, and taking the mick at Mark, calling him a duck, on account of his ‘greasy’ coif. On one hand, it amuses the hell out of McFadden [at one point in the show he just emits a very giggly ‘QUACK’ out of nowhere]. But on the other, it’s a downright bizarre putdown for a comic. As Mark is, to quote a much later entry on this list, “a professional comedian”, of course he’s gonna have something to say about that.\n\nAnd really, the tactic they use, which is kinda genius, is just to shruggingly yes-and Brian, and keep the duck motif going all night [“Ooh, they’re hatching! As you can see, Brian, I’m a duck!”]. Plus, pretty much everybody, including Phill, has great responses here. Phill’s best one is going to Brian and saying “I don’t recall saying to you before the show, ‘watch out for Lamarr, he can be a bit of a duck.’” Vic also has a lot of fun with it, fitting right into the current of this [cause he’s a comedian, he knows where the humor’s going].\n\nI still have some issues with this show because Sean’s team just isn’t as entertaining as Phill’s have the time, but Phill’s team delivers a laugh riot in every round, including ID Parade and Next Lines, where the duck-needling continues, and where Brian becomes even more of the butt of jokes [“I want Brian to guess, I like his reasoning” “Get ready for a barnyard analogy..”]. Mark just keeps feeling more and more dominant, and the loose nature of the show foreshadows how breezy and wild it’d become once Bill would join.\n\nSo I get it now. It’s an all-timer, and a Top 20 placer. I wonder which ones will pop out on my next watch.\n\nBest Moment: Phill, to a losing-it Mark: “you alright, there, MALLARD BOY?”\n\n#15- S26E07\n\nHost: Richard Ayoade\n\nCaptains: Phill & Noel\n\nPanelists: Matthew Crosby, Shingai Shoniwa, Caroline Flack & Ed Sheeran\n\nSome bookings don’t age very well. John Barrowman. Russell Brand. Jameela Jamil. Ian Watkins [and I don’t mean H from Steps]. Tim Westwood, nothing happened he’s just shit at Buzzcocks.\n\nBut some bookings happen to age tremendously, if the performer in question A.) manages to secure a bigger modicum of fame, and B.) continues to be completely nonproblematic. This is why Alice Cooper’s appearances on the show impressed me so much, or Martin Freeman’s, or how Bobby Mair’s guest bit towards the end prepared me for his underrated hosting run on Killer Camp.\n\nAnd then we have this one. Which honestly has a bit of both?\n\nThe reason I was so excited to cover this one back in the day was the appearance of both Richard Ayoade and Ed Sheeran. Ayoade has never not made me laugh, with great work on The IT Crowd, The Crystal Maze, Pixar’s Soul, and even the forgettable 2012 comedy The Watch. I knew he’d be perfect as a guest host for Buzzcocks. Meanwhile, as I covered this episode, Sheeran’s Divide album was an absolute smash, and he was gaining ground as one of the biggest artists in the biz [before the collaborations album would bring him…crashing back down to Earth]. It’s always nice when Buzzcocks covers a musician before they get big in the US, and early appearances by Amy Winehouse and Matty Healy confirmed this.\n\nSo, needless to say, this show outdid my expectations. Right at the top, Ayoade took a stance against proper jokes on the program. Yes, this itself was also a joke, but it also challenged the performers to get laughs without resorting to easy punchlines. For Noel, who counted the number of proper jokes he’d ever done on the show on one hand, this could be easy. For Matthew Crosby and Phill, this could be trickier.\n\nThe show itself worked in spite of its non-obviousness, and Richard got laughs out of droll factoids and blunt understatements, which he can do in his sleep. Richard’s very good at this sort of pedantic, curious sort of character, and he plays it here entirely off the cuff. Hell, even when he makes a mistake he plays it off perfectly [“Bard Romance- no, Lady Gaga, Bad Romance…or Bard Romance, her song about Shakespeare.”]\n\nHe also gets great material out of everyone, including Caroline Flack, who, despite the sad ending to her story, is in a great mood here, and is cracking jokes throughout. There’s a lot of TV presenters on this program, but she at least had a nice night, and was a bit more comfortable than her first one with Rhod Gilbert. Shingai Shoniwa and Matthew Crosby also benefitted from return visits, and Crosby is just genuinely a natural at guesting on NMTB.\n\nAnd then there’s Sheeran. Who, while a great panel presence and a good Intros partner for Noel [their Mumford and Sons one was great], led to the focal point of the entire show, his anecdote about falling asleep after sex. Which…Richard has a lot of fun with…and then it spreads to Phill and Matthew, and then Noel. And the thing about Ed Sheeran is, he’s got thick skin. He can take barbs about himself. A lot of the last few years has been peppered with a lot of ‘hey look how much I suck’ humor in his music videos. Some could even say he’s a bit TOO self-deprecating. But he lets this out, and laughs at himself, and continues to take the barbs in stride throughout the rest of the show. And yeah, with Richard Ayoade there, there’s gonna be a lot of those.\n\nThis is just a well-orchestrated, formula-breaking show, that even makes use of a great tiebreaker round, and keeps the energy going all the way to the end. Richard is one of the best guest hosts that ever did it, and without Ed to play around with, I don’t think the show would have been as memorable.\n\nBest Moment: Noel eviscerating Ed for revealing that about ‘passing out second time’, and finishing it with “…I slightly love you.”\n\n#14: S14E01\n\nHost: Mark Lamarr\n\nCaptains: Phill and Bill\n\nPanelists: Terry Hall, Dave Fulton, Kwame & Brandon Block\n\nThe show’s had several golden ages, honestly, as I’ve mentioned. 4 through 6 I’ve talked about. You could also include just 19 and 20 as the height of the Simon era, and 9 and 10 as the last true boom of Sean Hughes’ tenure.\n\nBut then there’s Series 14 through 16. Where Mark suddenly becomes looser than he’s ever been, and the show begins to act as a deconstruction of itself. People, in my preparation for the watchdown, mentioned that 12 through 16 was the best era of the show, and I do think 12 and 13 were a little spottier. Right from the beginning of Series 14, Buzzcocks becomes something bigger than it already is.\n\nAll my years I thought the show was a tale of two halves, but a lot happens in the first half, too. Terry Hall’s having another really fun show, and his dry, deadpan responses to friend Mark are as great as they were on his first appearance. Mark actually takes the mick at Dave Fulton a bit, sort of battering down his too-aggressive comedic persona, which he’d also do with both Jimmy Carr and Dara O’Briain that series. Intros is one of the better ones of this era, and the first of a few where Mark would sort of mess things up and give things to one team by accident, here prepping the wrong card and accidentally revealing what Brandon’s ones would be.\n\nThere’s also a slow, undercurrent of the Bill-Mark dynamic, that’s just growing as the episode goes on. Some good barbs in Intros, a good ‘karducian leech’ gag from Bill that confuses the hell out of Mark, and just…some tension. Comedic tension, but, as established, this season Mark is gonna actually follow through if something pisses him off.\n\nSo first, Phill’s ID Parade happens, featuring the immortal first appearance of Al the Pirate, whose sword-clutching perseverance cracks up Phill and Mark, to the point where they drag Dave and Terry over in front of them to enact a stalemate and force him to put the sword down. It’s one of the most spontaneous, silly, spur of the moment sort of deviations from the formula they’d done to this point, and you could tell they were all in a really good mood doing it, even Terry. I also love Terry, after all that torture, guessing that Al is the actual musician they’re looking for. They’d keep bringing Al back as well, in a lot of S14 shows and also just for the rest of the run, with additional pirates.\n\nAnd then, in Next Lines, the umpteenth animal gag from Bill gets Mark so angry that he proceeds to beat Bill with cards every time he does an animal joke. It’s the culmination of 3 full series’ of Bill and his schtick, and Mark, at the very least, was playful in his rapport with Bill [as he always had been], but as he’d already taken Al too seriously, he decided to also take Bill seriously, and start doing a Pete Townshend windmill into a papercut on the top of Bill’s head. It gets even funnier when he keeps going for Phill’s team, who keep doing animal jokes as well. It’s a hilariously violent, and very ridiculous moment.\n\nBy the end of this, almost an exhaustion sets in with how funny it’s all been. So much is packed into this show, even to the point where Terry almost feels subtle in his comedic presence at times. And it’s all extremely worthwhile. I’m gonna look over this in several months and I’m gonna realize this was too low. Perhaps. I still love this one, and it’s still the beginning of a deadly run for Buzzcocks in the mid-2000s.\n\nBest Moment: The close-up of Al casually tilting his head towards Mark, like “really?” The entire battalion nearly dies at that.\n\n#13: S02E07\n\nHost: Mark Lamarr\n\nCaptains: Phill & Sean\n\nPanelists: Jeff Green, Louise Redknapp, Math Priest, Norman Blake\n\nI refer to Series 2 of Buzzcocks as a ‘pretty good’ series of the show. It’s caught between two weaker entries of the series, and it’s not connected to the first golden age, but there are some good ones in S2. It’s also a showcase for a lot of the early-series repertory of recurring guests, like Jonathan Ross, Graham Norton, Richard Fairbrass, Shovell, Math Priest and Jeff Green. Very 1996, but there you go. Two of them appear in this show, Math and Jeff, and they do very well here.\n\nBut in the first two series’, the show had slowly become more confident, and had figured out more of a presence on TV than just ‘the music quiz’. So by 2×07, there was enough of a reputation, and enough time to establish what the show was known for, that the producers could just…fuck around.\n\nNot that they needed a ton of help to create a fun show. The act of putting Phill, Louise Redknapp and Jeff Green on the same panel was funny enough. Louise was one of the most beautiful people of 1996, and her doing the intro for Love Hangover by Diana Ross while essentially taunting the poor horny, “tenting” according to Phill, Jeff Green was amusing in itself. Also, Phill and Louise made a really fun duo. Having them try to do Barry White with Phill’s ill-fated impression [“for those of you who didn’t know, serial killers made disco records”] is just as amusing. Not to disparage Math, Norman and Sean, who all got along, and had some fun in Intros as well.\n\nAnd then, the producers’ work starts unraveling. First, there’s a Connected round involving Toyah Wilcox, Bjork, and SEAN HUGHES, which is funny in itself [Jeff’s guess: “Mark, is it three things you think of when you’re having sex and you wanna delay it?”]. Coming off of Sean’s Connected, where they just kept making fun of Lou Reed and Clive Dunn [“do theyyyyyy both smell of piss?”], it’s such a funny contrast, cause now Sean’s being needled, grinning and bearing it. And also, the answer being that all three were stalked is a very rare look into the lives of the regulars.\n\nThen, Phill’s bashing of Fuzzbox in Indecipherable Lyrics comes back to haunt him when two of the band are featured in his ID Parade [Mark’s smug grin and Phill’s panicked reaction when this happens are absolutely perfect]. Having to see Phill walk back his earlier comments, while also mentioning that he knew their old keyboardist, is priceless. Phill doesn’t get many moments to have a lower hand on this show [other than arse-related issues], so it’s interesting to see him struggle here.\n\nAnd then the one everyone remembers, Mark introducing an ID Parade for the Wurzels, 8 seasons early for Bill Bailey, only to reveal that the entire ID Parade is wearing Mark’s jacket and hairstyle, unbeknownst to him. It’s the culmination of the entire ‘wind-up’ the producers left for all 3 panelists at the end of the series, and it’s the funniest payoff because it, again, bounces off of Mark’s ’50s throwback’ image from Shooting Stars, and keeps him down.\n\nBy the end, Sean’s team is cracking me up throughout Next Lines, Mark’s grin and bearing it as he has to do one more Wurzels line, and the 2nd series unofficially ends with basically a reward for being on for as long as they had. It’s a reward for the cast as well as the viewers, as this is a truly funny episode, the first real gem of the show’s run, and one of the best shows of the early era.\n\nBest Moment: Mark having to stone-facedly read the joke names for the Wurzels ID Parade, eventually just asking Phill to finish it [“OR IS IT #5, COIF RICHARD?”]\n\n#12: S25E06\n\nHost: Greg Davies\n\nCaptains: Noel & Frankie Boyle\n\nPanelists: Ian ‘H’ Watkins, Amy Childs, Tinchy Stryder & Holly Walsh\n\nI did tell you Frankie Boyle would be back on this countdown soon enough. Amazingly, if Phill Jupitus hadn’t had gone sick, he’d have been left out of this one…and honestly, this show still would have been really good. But with him, it’s a Top 20 show. It’s also a harbinger of things to come for the show.\n\nGreg Davies, I am 100% sure, got the permanent NMTB job for the revival because of this show. It’s like Rhod Gilbert earning the S28 gig with his second hosting appearance, the Jimmy Osmond episode. Greg Davies did a phenomenal job hosting the show, made it look very easy, nailed the prompter reads, had chemistry with everybody, and spent the entire episode screwing with Tinchy Stryder about their height difference. The NMTB crew looks for dynamic, outgoing performers when picking hosts, and Greg was very outgoing in this show, even sort of bouncing off of Frankie after some jokes. He also used his expertise as a former educator for the final round, which was exam-based music questions, and honestly one of the best uses of the ‘final round tailored to the guest host’ trope from S25 on. Because of this show, I’m fully confident in Greg’s hosting skills, and it’s honestly up to Sky to fuck this one up.\n\nAs for the show itself, it’s a natural success because of everything slammed into this panel. It’s one of the best cases of happenstance that Frankie landed on an episode next to Ian ‘H’ Watkins, a frequent dartboard of his during Mock the Week, and across from Holly Walsh, who most famously opened the racist door for him during one of his last MTW episodes. Even better, he got to sit next to Amy Childs, from The Only Way is Essex, and sling jokes off of her the whole night. The extended bit on vajazzling, which Noel Fielding had a lot of fun with as well [also, he does so well as a show anchor without help from Phill, he takes on so much of the weight of the show solo], is a classic, and has been a favorite late-era Buzzcocks clip. Amy, like on other panel shows, can laugh at herself, and at other people laughing at her, but can be so dim sometimes that she asks for it. Not as much here as on, say, anything Jimmy Carr hosts, but close.\n\nI will say, Frankie does insanely well as a team captain, works really well with H, does great in Intros, is a great team-proctor, and also has time to throw in great dirty jokes about Justin Bieber and even Steps. I do think there’s some lawful, thought-out energy hidden beneath the exterior of a vulgar comedian, and he’s great here all around.\n\nHonestly, some of the best stuff in this episode has little to nothing to do with Frankie, and it’s all the stuff with Tinchy and Greg, cause MAN is that fun. First of all, Tinchy’s also good at taking a joke, and takes all of Greg’s short jokes with a smile. Then there’s the entire running bit about Tinchy using Range Rovers as a monetary unit [Frankie: “D’you realize that this is a type of autism that you’ve got?”], and how it goes on so long that Tinchy even smirkingly brings it back as a callback. It’s a masterful moment from one of the best recurring guests of the guest host era.\n\nAll of this doesn’t include some other fun energy moments, like Holly firing Nerf rounds into the air, or most of the Steps jokes in here. But it’s a very packed, and very funny episode. I’m hoping a lot of the Sky revival shows will be a lot like this, and not…bad.\n\nBest Moment: Tinchy, trying to guess Greg’s age: “I think you’re like [smirk], like, round the same age that a range-rover would cost…”\n\nNoel, summing up the whole episode: “That was a great joke, AND it’s the only one that can go in the show…”\n\n#11: S08E07\n\nHost: Mark Lamarr\n\nCaptains: Phill & Sean\n\nPanelists: Dani Filth, Eddie Brill, Lisa Rogers & Steve Harley\n\nI honestly think Series 8 is kind of a low point, as a lot of episodes just sort of come and go without much of an impact. The Darius episode is in here, Tania Strecker’s episode is funny, Blackburn and Slash just missed the countdown, but there’s lots of droughts, and lots of very one-dimensional shows.\n\nAnd then, at the center of it all….is this one. Where Dani Filth comes on the show “out of makeup” and attempts to be suitable to normal audiences.\n\nLike, going into this, I didn’t know much about Cradle of Filth, because I don’t really listen to thrash-type and uber-metal shit. Like, when they’d use Napalm Death and Mudvayne on Indecipherable Lyrics, I’d just laugh. How d’you actually try to understand any of that, it’s just screaming? And Cradle of Filth ties right into that, cause it’s just a bunch of goths shouting and going UNGH and being horror-y and shit. Great fit for a pop quiz. Phill, a Letterman mainstay, and Dani ‘Lord of Darkness’ Filth.\n\nAnd ohhhh man did Mark have fun with him. So much fun. The entire episode almost counts as a Mark highlight reel, cause he just keeps swinging at Dani. Making an It Ain’t Half Hot Mum reference. Repeatedly referring to him as a vampire. And the entire bleach-drinking bit, which went so far it fucking carried into the next Cradle of Filth live album. Mark says it as a joke, Dani says “I could actually go for some bleach right now”, as a joke, and then Mark just keeps needling him about"
