        "text": "TikTok is available in over 160 countries, has over 1.1 billion users, and has been downloaded over 220 million times in the United States alone. Although they’re now suing the U.S. Government, if your brand’s target audience includes anyone between the age 13 and 60, you should be on TikTok right now. Need inspiration on launching your TikTok strategy? Click here for amazing TikTok examples from brands. Want to know how the TikTok algorithm works? Click here. Without further ado, here are the most important TikTok statistics (we will continuously refresh this article as new data becomes available – some data is directly from our TikTok contacts).\n\nMonthly Active Users – TikTok officially has over 1 billion monthly active users. For reference – active users of other social platforms: Facebook – 2.9B, YouTube – 2.2B, Instagram – 1.4B, TikTok – 1.0B, Snapchat – 750M, Pinterest – 480M, Twitter – 300M.\n\nTotal App Downloads – The TikTok app has been downloaded over 2.7 billion times worldwide, as reported by Sensor Tower in December, 2020. In January 2021, TikTok had 62 million downloads. In Q1 of 2020, the app had 315 million downloads, which is the best quarter by any app, ever. 500 million of those come from India, 180 million from China, and 130 million from the U.S. In June of 2020 TikTok was downloaded 87 million times worldwide (with 7.5 million of those coming from the U.S.).\n\nMonthly Active Users in the United States – TikTok now has over 150 active users in the U.S, according to their CEO.\n\nMonthly Active Business Users – It was also recently reported that over 5 million businesses actively use TikTok in the U.S.\n\nAmong U.S. over 18, TikTok brought in 22.2 million mobile unique visitors in January, 23.2 million in February and 28.8 million in March. In April, that number jumped to 39.2 million—three times the 12.6 million who used the app last April, according to the most recent Comscore data provided to Adweek (note – Comscore only tracks users over 18).\n\nThe percentage of U.S.-based TikTok users by age: 10-19 – 32.5%, 20-29 – 29.5%, 30-39 – 16.4%, 40-49 – 13.9%, 50+ – 7.1%. This means that the TikTok userbase is aging up (so get on it now!). All data via Comscore.\n\nAverage Minutes Per User – TikTok users love the app. They spend an average of a WHOPPING 95 minutes per day (over 1.5 hours) in the platform.\n\nOpens – A user opens the TikTok app 8 times per day.\n\nCreation – 83% of TikTok users have posted a video.\n\nU.S. Audience – As we mentioned, we estimate that TikTok has about 80 million monthly active users in the United States. 60% are female, 40% are male. 60% are between the ages of 16-24. 26% are between the ages 25-44. 80% are between the ages 16-34. This data comes straight from TikTok.\n\nGen Z – 60% of TikTok users are Gen Zers. Gen Zers are trendsetters. Next year, 74 million people in the U.S. will be part of “Gen Z”, which will make it the largest generation of all.\n\nRevenue – TikTok made $165M in February alone, according to Forbes.\n\nCountries – TikTok is now available in 154 countries worldwide (and 75 different languages).\n\nTikTok Vs. The Facebook Empire – Facebook’s “Lasso” (it’s TikTok clone), has 250,000 downloads in the U.S. since last November. TikTok has 41.3 Million in that timeframe.\n\n$500 – the amount TikTok is reportedly paying influencers to join the app and start creating content. It’s working well though. The platform is growing like crazy.\n\nAccording to Sensor Tower, TikTok was the second most downloaded app in the U.S. in November with 4 million downloads (trailing only Disney+).\n\nAccording to TechCrunch/Apptopia, TikTok’s Q4 2019 revenue grew over 300% from the same period a year earlier.\n\nDouyin, aka TikTok in mainland China, just hit 400 million daily active users there (and the most active dance video creators are over 60 years old!).\n\nA top trending song is typically a top trending song Spotify, as well. Illustrates the true influence of the platform.\n\nThe TikTok Creator Marketplace is a platform run by TikTok that houses thousands of profiles of TikTok creators. Brands can search the marketplace for creators whose audiences best fit the target market of their campaign (need access? We have it!).\n\nTikTok had 104 million downloads just last month (an increase of 46% from the year ago period).\n\nEngagement – it’s hard to quantify this. But the engagement on TikTok is incredible. Case in point: Jennifer Lopez recently posted the same video on Twitter and TikTok. She has 45 million followers on Twitter and 5 million followers on TikTok. The video on Twitter got 2 million views (off 45 million followers). The video on TikTok got 71 million views (off 5 million followers). So start using TikTok now! They recently started nightly programming which is undoubtedly training Gen Z to tune in at certain times a la appointment TV viewing of days past. Engagement has increased dramatically over the past few months. The New York Times reports that TikTok usage has been skyrocketing since Coronavirus began.\n\nTikTok has recently created a $1 Billion Creator Fund. This money will be paid by TikTok directly to its creators in an effort to further solidify its relationships with influencers. TikTok has many competitors, large and small (Facebook’s Reels, YouTube’s Shorts, former Vine creator’s Byte, and Triller, among others). This fund should prove to be very effective for the platform.\n\nForbes put out a report on the highest-earning TikTok stars. Addison Rae comes in at number one making $5 Million, Charli D’Amelio is number two at $4 Million, and her sister Dixie is number three at $2.9 Million.\n\nTikTok Top 100 Influencers – this list shows the top 100 most-followed TikTok accounts.\n\nThere are six creators who have at least 50 million followers: Charlie D’Amelio, Addison Rae, Zach King, Spencer X, Loren Gray, and Bella Poarch\n\nTikTok released the Top 100 of 2020\n\nTikTok just increased the max video length from 3 minutes to 10 minutes (it was originally 1 minute)\n\nTikTok screen time per user is crushing its competitors – it’s currently at 26 hours per month.\n\n29% of consumers that have TikTok installed on their phone use it every day – second only to Instagram at 39%.\n\n67% of teens use TikTok (second only to YouTube according to a new Pew research poll)\n\nNearly half of Gen Z is using TikTok and Instagram for search instead of Google, according to Google’s own internal data.\n\nClick here to see the most followed and highest earning TikTok accounts.\n\n33% of TikTok users say they regularly get their news from the app, according to Pew Research.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, users currently spend 17.6 million hours per day on Instagram Reels, versus 197.8 million hours per day on TikTok.\n\nTikTok is beta testing live shopping in the wild now.\n\nTikTok SEO is huge (with tens of millions of searches per day), and something you need to be working on right now.\n\nMr. Beast was the fastest growing TikTok account of 2022, adding almost 36 million followers (crazily enough, he was also the fastest growing YouTube account as well, adding 38 million subscribers)\n\nConsumers in China spent over $200B on TikTok’s eCommerce offerings last year.\n\nThe Top 1000 advertisers are drastically increasing their spend on TikTok. Ad impressions there cost 50% less than on Instagram Reels, 33% less than on Twitter, and 62% less than on Snapchat.\n\nAverage time spent per day by U.S. adults is 53.8 minutes, according to Insider Intelligence in a June 2023 study.\n\nHere’s a quick rundown of some marketing and advertising related statistics:\n\nHave questions?
