        "text": "There have been so many amazing Scooby-Doo villains over the years that it was genuinely difficult to pick favorites when I came up with the idea for this article. Nonetheless, I narrowed it down to ten of my all-time favorites. We'll be starting off with an honorable mention that is probably an extremely unpopular opinion that will surprise everybody.\n\nHonorable Mention: Banshee\n\nLikely either you're shocked right now, or you're saying \"what episode was this from?\" The banshee is a very forgotten villain from The Richie Rich / Scooby-Doo Hour episode \"Scooby's Luck of the Irish,\" and it only appears for a brief minute of the episode. This banshee's design is so terrifying that it's a huge shame that it was wasted on a one-minute appearance, in my opinion. The jagged teeth, huge mouth, skeletal hands, and soulless eyes make this one of the best Scooby-Doo villains of the franchise. I wish this would have been used in a full-length episode, because I imagine the tone of the episode would have been super dark.\n\n10. The Mummy of Friar Sera\n\nPerhaps this is another surprise, since I don't think the Mummy from \"Theater of Doom\" (Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated) is a particularly popular villain. In the past, mummies had just been the same bandaged-looking prototype (with the exception of \"Mummy Scares Best,\" but I thought the eerie green mist, his glowing yellow eyes, and his decomposing corpse was amazingly creepy. The raspy voice is also super creepy!\n\n9. The Ghost of Uncle Beauregard\n\nI have a huge soft spot for Boo Brothers and all the villains from in it in general, but Uncle Beauregard particularly stands out. His design is absolutely incredible, and I love the uncertainty around whether he is a real or a fake ghost throughout the movie. Even though the audience is kind of left unsure about the Skull Ghost at the end of the film too, Uncle Beauregard is the only villain in the film that we're left completely unsure about. The sheriff never admits to dressing up as Shaggy's uncle, but the ghost seems to have conflicting purposes throughout the film - sometimes he just wants to warn Shaggy away, and other times, it seems like he wants to kill Shaggy. The mystery surrounding if this ghost is real or not, as well as the amazing design, makes this a top-tier villain for me.\n\n8. Zomba\n\nI think it's well established for those who know me that Zomba is my favorite 13th ghost, but she's also one of my favorite villains of the franchise. One of the features of villains that freaks me out the most is bugged-out eyes, so Zomba's huge looking eyes are super creepy looking to me. The raspiness of her voice is also incredibly sinister-sounding! In the one scene where she's mis-animated (pictured above), she looks absolutely terrifying!\n\n7. The Ghost of Mother\n\nIt's safe to say that this villain is one scary mother lol. (That joke was perhaps more frightening than any of the villains that made this list haha) \"Doo Not Disturb\" is one of my favorite episodes from Be Cool, and a lot of that is how amazing this villain is. The concept of the villain just being somebody's mother is hilarious, but at the same time, it's executed in such a creepy way.\n\n6. The Freak of Crystal Cove\n\nThis guy's design alone is what gets him ranked so high. He looks like something out of an R-rated horror movie, and the fact he only speaks in creepy riddles in \"Pawn of Shadows\" is so creepy. Not to mention the giant knife he holds! What brings him down just a little bit for me is that in \"All Fear the Freak,\" there's a weird inconsistency where he starts speaking in broken English and no longer holds the knife. This makes him less creepy, but only a little bit. He's still one of the most incredible and terrifying villains of the franchise IMO.\n\n5. The Ghost of Sarah Ravencroft\n\nAlthough the fake ghost was very good too, I'm talking about the real ghost of Sarah Ravencroft here. She's arguably one of the most evil villains in the entirety of the franchise, as her plan is quite literally to destroy the entire world just for the fun of it lol. The twist at the end of Witch's Ghost where she's actually real is one of my favorite moments in the franchise.\n\n4. Revolutionary Ghosts\n\nIt should come as no surprise to anyone that these guys from \"The Loch Ness Mess\" are here lol. I don't feel these are particularly terrifying like most of my other choices, but they just feel like such classic Scooby-Doo villains to me. The scene involving the ghost with the lantern disappearing into the night feels so inherently Scooby-ish to me. I wish we would have gotten to see the Redcoat Ghost more than just those two times, as he's my favorite of the three. He looks super creepy with his soulless and vacant eyes.\n\n3. The Ghost of Dr. Coffin\n\n\"The Harum Scarum Sanitarium\" is in general one of the spookiest Scooby episodes of all time, but a big part of that is the ghost of Dr. Coffin. His design is so creepy and he genuinely looks like he is insane. The creepy glow around his body really amplifies the spook-factor for me.\n\n2. Gramps the Vamp\n\nThis vampire from \"Vampire Bats and Scaredy Cats\" is my favorite vampire villain in the franchise, but a lot of that is his behavior rather than his design. Him calling Lisa in the middle of the night from the pitch black room is one of the scariest scenes of the franchise in my opinion. However, he's not only here because of his menacing looks; he's also here for having one of the most despicable motives of any culprit in the franchise. (Spoilers ahead) The fact that Uncle Leon betrayed his niece like that is beyond cold and scarring, especially considering he literally traumatized an 18-year-old girl just so he could steal her money.\n\n1. Morgan Moonscar\n\nYou could call me basic for making this my pick, but Morgan Moonscar is easily the creepiest villain of the franchise. Even though he's not seen more than a couple times in Zombie Island, his introduction of literally being a bag of bones crawling out of his own grave is absolutely terrifying. His design is so creepy looking, particularly his dried-out face and the huge scar around his eye.\n\nThat about does it for my rankings, but if you'd like to share, I'd love to see your top 10 list of favorite villains in the comments! I hope you enjoyed reading my list!\n\nThere are a lot of incredible Scooby-Doo villains out there, but there are also a lot of terrible villains. If you enjoy the classic person-in-a-mask format, I suppose you could fill the list from purely Scrappy shorts, but I tried to limit the amount of ones I pulled from the Scrappy shorts. While I don't particularly enjoy villains like Nazrat of the Jungle or the Strongman, I feel there were some costumes in other episodes that were far worse.\n\nWe're going to switch it around this time and do the worst list first, and I will post the best list soon.\n\n10. Rankor\n\nThere are a lot of options that I debated putting here, and I hate to put such a cool-looking villain here. However, Rankor (from \"Coast-to-Ghost\") looks certainly do not match his behavior. He is one of the dumbest villains in the history of the franchise IMO. He inexplicably reports to some random monster club that couldn't have been too high-level given Weerd and Bogel are trying to get into it. Even worse, he goes into the Demon Chest by his own free will, and actually thanks the gang as they capture him by exclaiming \"Thanks, you guys are real pals!\" Given this is supposedly one of the 13 most horrible ghosts in the world, the bar for that title can't be too high lol.\n\n9. Skeleton\n\nI do have a soft spot for this one because it's so bad that it's kinda funny, but the Skeleton from \"The Spooky Fog\" is one of the most low-effort Scooby-Doo villains you'll find lol. Not only is it obvious that it's just a guy wearing a cheap suit with bones painted on it, the skeleton's movements are not scary or menacing in any way. In his first appearance in the gif above, it looks like he's just taking his evening stroll through the cemetery lol.\n\n8. Ghost of Juan Carlos\n\nI feel bad having this on here, because I do really like the episode, but I have always found the Ghost of Juan Carlos from \"Don't Go Near the Fortress of Fear\" to be really bad. He looks like just a normal guy in a general's outfit. In fact, I'd go as far as to argue there's nothing really ghostly about him at all.\n\n7. Carnival Owner\n\nThis will be the first of five villains from the Scrappy shorts. A consistent problem you'll notice that I have with the Scrappy shorts is that I feel Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy sometimes act like jerks who do something really rude to somebody else, then take no responsibility. I don't like how the carnival owner was made to be the villain, when the guys were the ones that screwed up and ate all the profits, then ran rather than apologize or pay for what they ate.\n\n6. Chef\n\nI don't find the chef from \"Scooby Gumbo\" to be well-written in the slightest. He's not even really a villain, technically, he's just a guy with strict rules about animals that the guys antagonize.\n\n5. Carl and Tony\n\nBesides the fact that \"Ransom of Scooby Chief\" leads us into the Scrappy short era, which I didn't care for, I just feel like they're not great villains in general. Rather than menacing or forceful like I feel like would have been good with a kidnapper plot, they just come off kind of whiney and annoying to me.\n\n4. Doctor\n\nI think we can all agree that the doctor from \"Scrappy's Birthday\" was just a flat-out bad villain lol. The idea of a doctor becoming so enraged that he chases visitors around the hospital is completely ridiculous.\n\n3. Museum Guard\n\nThe reason the Museum Guard from \"Scooby Dooby Guru\" is here is due to the fact that his whole character is just one bad stereotype after another. I've gone into detail in my least favorite episodes/films list about how awful some of the stereotypes this character is written with are, notably the fact that he jumps on a random elephant and chases the gang around town, as well as the awful Indian voice impression that the voice actor does.\n\n2. McGurk Brothers\n\nUnless the McGurk Brothers from \"Hoedown Showdown\" are intended as a meta-reference to how stereotypes are bad, these are hands-down some of the worst Scooby-Doo villains I've ever seen. Basically their entire personalities are just bad stereotypes of hillbillies. The fact that their feud with Shaggy's family is that one of them wants to date Shaggy's cousin, but she's not interested because he doesn't take baths, is quite possibly the worst villain motive of the entire franchise lol.\n\n1. Sheet Ghost\n\nFor me, the Sheet Ghost from \"Haunted House Hang-Up\" is hands down the worst Scooby-Doo villain we've ever had. The fact that the sheet he's wearing is so short that you can clearly see his human legs and arms is ridiculous and funny. It's clear he put very little effort into his costume lol.\n\nAs I mentioned in the previous top 10 settings article, I didn't think \"Worst Settings\" would make a good companion article for this, since I can't think of any instances where I disliked an episode based on the setting alone. So instead of that, I used an idea suggested by Matt, a regular commenter on the blog, and decided to pick out 10 episodes where I feel the setting is great, but isn't talked about very often. It was genuinely pretty tough to try to condense my list into just 10, but it was a fun challenge nonetheless. I don't have an order for these, as I don't really have a sense for which of these settings are more underrated than another. I feel all of these are underrated.\n\nTheater of Doom\n\nI mentioned this one in the comments but it was not mentioned in the actual post. I honestly think the episode in general is very underrated. I love how atmospheric the episode is in the sense all 22 minutes either takes place on the tiny stage, or in the creepy backstage-like basement. Having such a focus location greatly enhanced the plot and the creepiness of the mystery, and I don't think this episode gets enough recognition for that.\n\nThe Exterminator\n\nIn general, I think The New Scooby-Doo Movies is underrated for its settings as a whole, but this is one of the episodes that really stands out to me for its setting. It's not talked about much as a haunted house episode, but the creepy house on the hill makes a great haunted house. I also particularly like the inclusion of the paintings. The fact that several of the paintings and statues (like the bird with the piggy bank, for example) can suddenly move and grab you at any time makes the setting even more spooky and disturbing.\n\nScooby-Doo, Where's the Crew?\n\nI don't hear this one talked about very much, but the ship's setting is so dark and terrifying. I would argue that this episode is as dark as any of the season 2 episodes. The gang being trapped on a ship lost at sea with three ghouls is really creepy, since there's literally no way they can escape. The atmosphere of the whole episode feels really dark in a way that not a lot of Scooby episodes do.\n\nScooby's Peep Hole Pandemonium\n\nFor an episode that has a very odd title, it has a really good setting; arguably the best of any of the 7 or 11-minute shorts. In comparison to the other series, it's not among the all-time best settings in the franchise, but I like how reminiscent this feels of a classic Scooby-Doo haunted house. The way this episode is able to do that despite the very different tone of the series from the 1960s and 1970s is definitely notable, and deserves more recognition than it gets.\n\nThe Hand of Horror\n\nOn that same subject, \"The Hand of Horror\" is another underrated setting. The Von Gizmo Estate presents another example of a setting feeling very atmospheric and being developed very well despite the short runtime.\n\nThe Weird Winds of Winona\n\nThis is another underrated The New Scooby-Doo Movies setting. The fact that this town is completely abandoned makes it feel foreboding, both at the farmer's house and the town hall. Admittedly, the short bit we get in the caves at the end of the episode isn't anything special, since this series seems to overuse caves a bit in my opinion, but the other two settings aren't talked about enough IMO.\n\nNight on Haunted Mountain\n\nI don't really know if \"underrated\" is the right word to describe this setting, but I never really hear anyone talk about this setting. The gang venturing up the mountain feels quite ominous, and the old ship remains have a very creepy vibe to them. I especially like the bit at the end with the El Aguirre's ghost showing up. I honestly wish he would have gotten his own episode, because his design is so amazing!\n\nThe Ghostly Creep from the Deep\n\nThis is the second-to-last New Scooby-Doo Movies that will appear here. I really like the setting of the old inn here. The fact that it is abandoned and in the middle of a swamp obviously enhances the setting quite a bit, but I also like the level of detail put into the outside of the inn. The inn looks very run-down and like it hasn't been used in years, which bumps this up a couple levels further in its spooky factor.\n\nThe Frickert Fracas\n\nThis episode is underrated in general, but I feel like a large part of that is the setting. Maude Frickert's farm has a very dark, spooky feel to it, and it's very challenging to do that with a simplistic setting like a farm IMO. The fact that most of the episode takes place at night adds to the creepiness of it, since the gang is walking around in the dark in a cornfield, where anything could jump out at them at any time. The farm itself is done in a very atmospheric way that really pulls you in, unlike \"The Ghost of the Red Baron\" a few episodes later, which kinda falls flat in comparison. This episode did an amazing job of using the farm to its full potential.\n\nThe Beast Is Awake in Bottomless Lake\n\nI notice that the settings I like best create a dark and foreboding atmosphere, and this is one where I feel it's done really well. Similarly to \"The Weird Winds of Winona,\" the town being basically abandoned and the whole thing taking place at night creates an atmosphere with a creepy vibe. Moreover, the Beast appearing seemingly everywhere amps up the terror even further, which I love. Also, this doesn't factor into my feelings on the setting, but it never fails to amuse me that Canada puts up a cheap wooden sign that says \"Welcome to Canada\" at the border. No other tourist information or a fancy sign at all, just a little wooden sign haha.\n\nIt was tough to condense my list into ten settings, but I hope you enjoyed reading this list! If you have any settings that you feel are underrated, I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments!\n\nIt's no secret at this point that Velma has been critically panned. Whether you love it or hate it, the majority of the fandom was not satisfied with this edgy adult reboot of the franchise. Now, Velma has wrapped up airing its first season and the fate of the show remains uncertain. Given I was one of those fans who disliked Velma, this feels like the perfect time to talk about the direction I would like the see the franchise go in the future. In the following article, I outlined three broad ideas I have for the future of the franchise, although I've included some concrete series premises amongst my discussion of these ideas. I organized it this way because I am honestly pretty open to new series ideas; honestly, it's the writing and character development that are most important to me.\n\n1. A reboot that builds on Where Are You, but does not attempt to copy it\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about Guess Who is that the show often played it too safe. It tried to replicate the tone of Where Are You exactly, but it couldn't quite capture that original magic. While Guess Who isn't my favorite series, I do kind of appreciate what it tried to do by bringing things back to the original tone. Guess Who's biggest fault for me was trying to force that tone to the point where many episodes were a bit stale. Although they are very different series, one way to interpret some people's dissatisfaction with the franchise as of late, is that the common theme betweenVelma and Guess Who is that both of them tried too hard to force a tone that didn't work. Expanding or taking inspiration from something is different than trying to force it. As amazing as Where Are You is, I don't think anybody would want 49 straight seasons of the exact same thing, because it would get old if there was no variety after a while. I think a reboot of Where Are You could work if it were done in a way that used the original tone, but created something new in the process of doing that. I thought Be Cool, Scooby-Doo! did a great job of using the same classic formula, and by adding a more humorous twist and developing the characters in interesting ways, the writers were able to create something engaging and different. Something like this that builds on an aspect of an old series, (whether it be Where Are You or not) but doesn't attempt to directly copy it, could be a good direction to go. For example, perhaps they create settings with a similarly dark feel to Where Are You, but show the gang members each developing as characters in different ways. There needs to be a unique defining characteristic of each series, otherwise there is no point in creating a new series if you are going to try to match the tone of a previous series exactly.\n\n2. A mature show that does not overuse adult themes\n\nThis is a broad umbrella, and I'll elaborate with some ideas for this later. One of my biggest issues with Velma is how overly try-hard the writers are about the humor. Although it is becoming more common in sitcoms for people to think of \"mature\" and \"adult themes\" as the same thing, I firmly believe that they do not have to be. I have never felt that a series needs to be super raunchy in order to for me to think of it as mature. \"Adult themes\" typically refers to sexual jokes, drug references, intense gore and violence, whereas mature shows can simply mean that a show is too dark for kids, or the themes might be too frightening for a younger audience.\n\nIt's always been a bit perplexing to me that WB-Discovery has never looked at the overwhelming success of Zombie Island as something that would work consistently for the franchise. In my 15 years in the fandom, I've met very few fans who have a single bad thing to say about Zombie Island, and it's critically acclaimed even by folks who do not frequently watch the franchise. They could make another show with the mature tone of the Zombie Island era movies, and I think everybody would love it. Even if they made something dark not quite to that level of glory - take the Mystery Incorporated YouTube series from last year for example - I would love to see a show like that. There are clearly plenty of adult fans who still watch the franchise, and WB-Discovery knows this, otherwise they wouldn't keep referencing old stuff from the 1970s and 1980s that no young fans would recognize.\n\nSome specific, concrete ideas that would fit that tone could be a series like Wednesday. Wednesday and Velma are night and days in terms of quality. Wednesday manages to be a great mature reboot of the series that doesn't need to rely on sexual jokes, intense violence, and inappropriate humor as a crutch for bad writing. Simply having the gang solve the mystery of a serial killer in a Halloween costume of some sort could make a really good plot, especially if it was similar in tone to Zombie Island or even Mystery Incorporated (minus the romantic drama). Perhaps you could have it set at a boarding school, much like Wednesday, and have the gang meet each other through solving the mystery together. I would love to see a mature Scooby-Doo show in the vein of Wednesday.\n\nI also think this would be a great opportunity to create a universe where there is some shared lore from previous Scooby series. For example, recurring characters could show up, or aspects of the main characters from a certain iteration could be developed further. Another thing that I've talked about before on here that I disliked with Guess Who is the overuse of references, where they almost felt gimmicky. The best Easter Eggs for me are the ones that are tied tightly into the plot, rather than just \"hey, there's a picture of Redbeard over there!\" A mature reboot presents a great opportunity to create franchise lore based upon previous series and characterizations, rather than random references that aren't connected to anything.\n\n3. Spinoff with Side Characters\n\nWB could also do a spin-off of some of the beloved side characters of the franchise. I've mentioned on here that I've written a Ghoul School coming-of-age fanfic for the girls in high school, and a Hex Girls fanfic about how they got started as a band. I think both of these things would make amazing TV shows as long as they stayed at least somewhat true to the original tone (looking at you, Return to Zombie Island). The Hex Girls show is long overdue in my opinion; I think everyone would like that as long as they kept the girls in-character from their previous appearances. Showing how they became a band seems like the most logical series to do, but you could do a number of different plots with the girls, such as getting them involved in some sort of supernatural mystery; the girls going up against a witch as they're exploring Wicca further; or they could even do a high school coming-of-age plot where the girls run into a mystery at their school.\n\nOne could even argue that a spin-off featuring a gang member that actually keeps them true to their character would make an enjoyable show. I wrote another fanfic about Velma teaching at her sister Madelyn's school, Whirlen Merlin's, which is the vein of what I'm talking about here. I would like to see a show that actually develops the characters in a natural way that is consistent with what has been established over the past 50 years. Velma missed that mark by making the characters completely different than anything we'd seen before, and Guess Who also missed that mark by making the characters too stale. Especially at the beginning of the show, some of Fred, Daphne, and Velma's lines arguably could have been interchangeable and we probably wouldn't have even noticed.\n\nAnother idea in that similar vein is a spinoff involving Scooby, or one of the gang's relatives. I'd especially love to see a show of Scooby solving mysteries with Scooby-Dum; I feel like that would be really wholesome and hilarious.\n\nThe ideas are pretty endless for a new Scooby-Doo series, but these are ultimately the elements I most want to see in the next Scooby-Doo series after Mystery Pups. WB has had a history of kind of knee-jerk reactions to previous shows after the fact, and some of them have worked, and some of them haven't. The Be Cool writers have come out and said that WB told them they wanted a funny show after the dark, frightening tone of SDMI, but then they felt Be Cool didn't play it safe enough, so they created Guess Who. The preschool tone of Mystery Pups seems like a direct response to Velma being an adult show. I am pretty open-minded to new ideas; I think the most important aspects are good characterization, compelling mysteries, and an attempt to explore some new aspect of the franchise's formula that has not already been explored.\n\nThere are so many incredible settings within Scooby-Doo! We've been doing a lot of settings polls on here recently, and I recently was thinking that it might be cool to come up with a list of my favorite settings of the entire franchise. I had never really thought deeply about what my favorite settings within Scooby-Doo are, so this was a really fun project to decide on my favoirtes. I've been doing a lot of favorite/least favorite lists lately, but for the settings, I'm not going to do a least favorite post. The reason for that being I don't really feel that I dislike any episodes based on setting alone (there's even that one Be Cool, Scooby-Doo! episode that takes place in a garbage dump that's pretty good lol). Usually, if I dislike an episode, it's because there are other elements that also were not so good, like the tone, the villain, the characterization, etc.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Secret of Shark Island\n\nThis is one of the best hotel settings of the entire franchise, although we actually will have another hotel episode appear later on this list. The tone of the episode and the vibe of the hotel is super spooky, and it makes it even more foreboding that the gang is quite literally trapped on this isolated island due to flooding.\n\n10. Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders\n\nSomething about the setting of Roswell, New Mexico is just so peaceful to me. The gang exploring the small town feels very atmospheric and homely. The animation of this film is absolutely gorgeous and really brings you into the setting. I also love the scenes exploring Scorpion Ridge as Crystal and Amber are trying to take pictures. The fact that much of this movie takes place out in nature makes the film feel very Earthy and peaceful.\n\n9. A Halloween Hassle at Dracula's Castle\n\nLike I mentioned in my favorite episodes post, I absolutely love how it feels like this episode is built around the setting by slowly taking us through the castle. This is easily my favorite castle setting in Scooby-Doo, which is a high bar because I tend to love nearly all the episodes with castle settings in general. The basement with the hidden passages and rooms that could cave in at any moment add an extra layer of creepiness to an already amazing castle.\n\n8. The Spooky Case of the Grand Prix Race\n\nI don't usually particularly love racing settings, but this episode does the best job out of any episode making a very normal setting seem creepy. The race happening on a dark, foggy night creates a very unsettling tone, and the fact that the fog serves to allow the Phantom Racer to capture people without anyone seeing him makes it even more terrifying. Season 2 of The Scooby-Doo Show certainly had some dark episodes, and this is one of the two darkest settings of that season.\n\n7. The Loch Ness Mess\n\nThis feels like such a classic Scooby-Doo haunted house to me. Everything about this setting screams \"Scooby-Doo.\" Uncle Nat's old house is super creepy, and while the lake isn't as creepy, I do feel that those scenes are quite atmospheric. As I believe I've mentioned before, the scene where the ghost with the lantern disappears into the night is one of the most memorable scenes of the franchise for me. While this is far from the darkest or most atmospheric episode out there, the reason this ranks so high to me is because the setting feels like it captures the essence of Scooby so well. It won't quite make this list, but shout out to \"Wedding Bell Boos\" for also capturing this New England atmosphere really well.\n\n6. Night Terrors\n\nI was just talking about this with a few people in the comments for our poll this week, but I feel like \"Night Terrors\" is one of the best haunted house settings in the entire franchise. This episode transcends the traditional haunted house setting in the sense it's kind of framed as both a library and an old creepy house on a hill. However, I feel the plot helps create a super creepy setting that make this one just as much of a classic as some of the other haunted house settings. Horrifying things randomly happening throughout the episode make this setting feel absolutely nightmarish. In addition, the fact that even the gang has no idea what's going on until the last few minutes of the episode really helps build one of the most suspenseful and surreal atmospheres in the entire franchise.\n\n5. Vampire Bats and Scaredy Cats\n\nWe have arrived at the other hotel episode and the other Scooby-Doo Show season 2 episode I mentioned earlier! This is one of the darkest episodes in the entire franchise in my opinion. The animators did an incredible job making the hotel backgrounds have a super spooky, dark feel to them. The whole plot of the gang wandering the halls of a dark hotel at night with a vampire on the loose is super creepy. Some of the scenes in particular, like the Lisa turning into a vampire scene, and the scene where the vampire calls Lisa from a dark room in the middle of the night, do a great job of constructing the creepy aesthetic in this episode. Speaking of dark episodes, shout out to \"The Harum Scarum Sanitarium,\" which didn't quite make the cut for this list, but is another amazingly dark episode that really pulls you in with how foreboding the tone is.\n\n4. Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers\n\n​This is another one of those settings that just feels so authentically Scooby-ish. Uncle Beauregard's mansion has such a creepy atmosphere around it, and even the outside of the house when they're walking in the caves or woods feels super creepy. The old creaky floorboards and the fact that it's run down, as well as all the secret passages, really enhance the setting to me. This feels like one of the most classic Scooby-Doo haunted house settings out there, and that's a big feat given there are so many of them.\n\n3. Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\n\nWhat else do I need to say? It's Zombie freaking Island lol. In seriousness though, the background animation in this film is easily better than any other film or movie out there, in my opinion. Mook Animation makes everything look very realistic and mature. The creepy setting of the island has a very unsettling feel to it, and of course, the setting is greatly enhanced by how dark the film is.\n\n2. Scooby-Doo and the Witch's Ghost\n\nAlthough you could argue it's slow to start, I love how the audience is gradually introduced to the setting during the slower exposition at the beginning of the film. I absolutely love the peaceful, relaxing feel that the setting of Oakhaven has, and it feels like that extra time was very well spent creating an atmosphere and letting the audience really become immersed in exploring the setting with the gang.\n\n1. Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner?\n\nIt will likely come as a surprise to people that this is above Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost lol. When coming up with my list, one of the first questions I asked myself to determine my all-time favorite setting was \"which setting best captures the essence of Scooby-Doo?\" While the settings Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost are immaculately done and arguably have the best animation of anything in the franchise, I feel like Captain Moody's house best captures the episode of a Scooby episode. Ever since seeing this episode for the first time when I was a kid, this feels like the most classic Scooby-Doo haunted house setting I can think of. It does the same thing as \"A Halloween Hassle at Dracula's Castle\" and Witch's Ghost where the episode's structure slowly leads you through the setting, which allows the audience to become more immersed in the setting. I love how creepy and dark the first quarter of the episode is, with the gang being lost and stumbling upon Captain Moody's house, then becoming trapped in the basement. The second quarter of the episode focuses mainly on the main floor, where we're introduced to Homer Pipsqueak and all his disguises, and the third quarter focuses on the top floor of the house where the bedrooms are. This episode is a perfect example of how to use a 43-minute runtime well, because it uses that runtime to gradually lead the audience through the house and slowly introduces you to the atmosphere. Some of my favorite episodes and films are the ones that give the plot space to build atmosphere, and this episode does it best in my opinion.\n\nIn making this list, I found that episodes that slowly but steadily build atmosphere were among my favorites. Moreover, I also tended to gravitate towards episodes that completely immerse you in the setting, and this was an especially prevalent feeling for me when being immersed in the setting led to the episode/film feeling darker. Lastly, episodes that can only be described as feeling \"authentically Scooby-ish\" also tended to make this list quite a bit. I feel like \"Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner?\" is the best example of this because it perfectly represents all three of these phenomena.\n\nThere have been quite a few different adaptations of the iconic Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? theme song over the years. By request, I'm going to rank them all for you here! I don't necessarily have a ton to say since I'm basically ranking the same song over a dozen times haha, but if for some reason I glossed over any aspect of the song you'd like to know my opinion about, you're welcome to ask in the comments1\n\nLike with the other music post from Tuesday, I tried to find official versions of each of theme songs, but there weren't any official uploads for many of these, so I unfortunately will have to link some unofficial YouTube uploads here.\n\n13. Guess Who Theme Song\n\n​This is basically the Where Are You theme song, so I'm including it here. This is likely a hot take, but I am not a fan of this version. Someone left a comment a few months ago that said the theme song sounds like a \"playground taunt against the guy who sang the original,\" and honestly, I kind of agree with that lol. Something about the guy's voice is sounds almost mocking and unpleasant to listen to.\n\n12. Best Coast\n\nI want to start by saying even for these I've ranked lower, there's no version of the Where Are You theme song from here forward that I actively dislike. For this one, it's just kind of mediocre. Best Coast's vocals sound kind of generic, and the production isn't really anything special.\n\n11. Legend of the Vampire Opening\n\nThis is the last version I'm not a big fan of. The rock-inspired cover here sounds kind of generic and there isn't really anything special about it, especially compared to the others.\n\n10. Legend of the Vampire - Velma's Cover\n\nAnother version from Legend of the Vampire, but I like this one much better. I think Crystal Harris, the voice actress who was Velma's singing voice in this movie, who sounds great here.\n\n9. Shaggy\n\nFun fact if you didn't know, the 2002 live action Scooby-Doo film originally had a completely different opening that provides a backstory to why the gang started chasing the Luna Ghost. This opening includes a cover of the Where Are You theme song by the rapper Shaggy (not to be confused with the character of the same name haha). I think Shaggy's version sounds quite good here, and Shaggy's additional rap verses work well for what they are.\n\n8. MxPx\n\nSurprisingly, I had actually never heard this before writing this post. I thought I had, but when I relistened to all these, I had no memory of this. In contrast to the generic sounding Legend of the Vampire rock cover, I think this sounds really good! It reminds me a bit of Simple Plan's What's New, Scooby-Doo? theme song, as it's in that same 2000s punk rock vein. I think their take on the song sounds really good! Besides the version I linked, there's also apparently the \"10 hour extreme extended version\" of this song lol.\n\n7. B-52s\n\nI genuinely did not realize this version was the B-52s until now, but that's really cool! You may recognize the B-52s for their famous hit, \"Love Shack.\" I quite like how they got famous singers to perform the Where Are You theme song for these four Zombie Island era movies. That's a concept that easily could have been cringey, but I think in all four cases, they fit in really well. I think their version sounds really good, and I like the production here.\n\n6. Jennifer Love Hewitt\n\nJennifer's cover of this sounds great! The electronic production works really well here, and gives it a kind of out-of-this-world feel, which fits well with Alien Invaders for obvious reasons haha.\n\n5. Third Eye Blind\n\nI really like Third Eye Blind's version of the cover. I like the echoey sound of their voices, and it feels very reminiscent of the new wave music that was becoming popular in the 90s.\n\n4. Scooby-Doo, I'm So Blue\n\nThis version of the theme song in Trick or Treat, Scooby-Doo when the gang has no monsters to catch is absolutely hilarious! It was so funny watching the gang doing odd jobs around town haha.\n\n3. Billy Ray Cyrus\n\nThe original two will always be my favorites, but this is easily my favorite cover. I think Billy's voice sounds great here combined with the groovy retro instrumental. The production feels very 60s to me, and the twang in Billy's voice sounds really good combined with it.\n\n2. Season 2 Version\n\nThe higher-pitched vocals are a cool spin on the original, and I think George A. Robertson sounds really good. However, the classic season 1 version will always be my favorite out of pure nostalgia. I'm not going to rank the unused instrumental version, since it basically just became the score music for the title card, and it was used a couple times as background music in the series.\n\nWhich leaves us with my #1 choice...\n\n1. Season 1 Version\n\nI hope you enjoyed this article! It was fun going through all the different versions of the theme song, and as always, if you want to share your own rankings, I'd love to see them in the comments!\n\nWe've been doing a lot of rankings on here lately, but I love doing editorial articles as well (I would say the Analysis of Technology's Evolution in Scooby-Doo article and the Another Perspective on Fake vs. Real Monsters are among my favorite pieces I've written on here). For this post, I wanted to do something completely different and random that's kind of a mix of rankings and an editorial article.\n\nFor those that don't know this about me...and you probably don't, because I think I've only mentioned it once in a comment section lol...besides Scooby, I'm also really into music. There are so many amazing songs in the Scooby-Doo franchise - The Hex Girls and the Where Are You chase songs being among my favorites - but I don't necessarily listen to those outside of watching the episodes they're in. There are several songs from Scooby-Doo that I will sometimes listen to outside of their respective episodes and films when I am listening to music. I thought it would be fun to outline those 12 songs here. I'll talk about them by ordering them from least favorite to favorite.\n\n11. The Worst Day Ever by Simple Plan\n\nFrom: \"Simple Plan and the Invisible Madman\" - What's New, Scooby-Doo?\n\nThis is one of three Simple Plan songs that I listen to outside of the respective episodes. Unlike some of the forthcoming artists, What's New, Scooby-Doo? introduced me to the band. Although many people call the pop-punk era cringey, I actually kind of like some stuff from that genre...Paramore, Bowling for Soup, Avril Lavigne, Good Charlotte and Green Day come to mind. This is not one I listen to super frequently, but it's a nice track from Simple Plan and always makes me think of the episode whenever I listen to it.\n\n10. Yikes by Jack Harlow\n\nFrom: SCOOB! soundtrack\n\nIt's really neat to me how Jack Harlow appeared on a Scooby-Doo movie soundtrack right before he became famous. The song was released back in 2020 when he was outside freely (bonus points if you get that reference lol) before he released \"What's Poppin\" and \"First Class,\" which are his most famous songs. I don't have much to say about this one other than the production is nice and quite spooky, and Jack sounds good here. It's not one I return to super often, but it is a good song and one I find myself listening to occasionally. It's also notable for being one of the only Scooby songs to have a bit of a risqué lyric, that being the random lyric about him driving the Mystery Machine while intoxicated lol.\n\n9. I Fly by Galantis & Faouzia\n\nFrom: SCOOB! soundtrack\n\nThis is the song that Blue Falcon plays right at the end of SCOOB! during the dance party. I'd never heard of Faouzia prior to this song, and my only exposure to Galantis was his collaboration with Sofia Carson. This is a really cute song, and while it's not necessarily one I'll listen to a lot, it's such a feel-good song that I'll listen to it on occasion. The upbeat production is great and Faouzia has a very powerful voice.\n\n8. Thank You by Big Brovaz\n\nFrom: Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed Soundtrack\n\nThis is among the more obscure picks on this list, but I've found myself listening to this occasionally. This is the song played during the end credits in Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. Scooby-Doo soundtracks seem to have a knack for being full of great, feel-good songs, and this definitely falls in that category. It's a very smooth R&B sounding jam, and I think all of the members of Big Brovaz do a great job with making their vocals flow smoothly with the production. Also, fun fact, this is actually a cover of a Sly and the Family Stone song from 1969, the year Scooby came out.\n\n7. A Donde Vas by Carolina Lao\n\nFrom: Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico\n\n​I did a fun fact on this back in 2017, but if you don't remember it or weren't on the site back then, you may be surprised to find this out. You know that chase song in Spanish played during the pyramid chase in Monster of Mexico? It's actually a real song not made specifically for the film. It's on the debut album of Carolina Lao, an up-and-coming Spanish singer at the time. I believe this song was placed in the film to promote her album like they did with Lindsay Pagano and Simple Plan, and it would line up with that 2002-2003 time period where WB was doing that. I've been listening to this one often on lately, and I absolutely love her voice. The upbeat production and cheerful energy throughout the song make this one really enjoyable to listen to. This is definitely an underrated standout of Scooby-Doo chase songs, IMO.\n\n6. You Don't Mean Anything by Simple Plan\n\nFrom: \"Simple Plan and the Invisible Madman\" - What's New, Scooby-Doo?\n\nNext up, we've got another Simple Plan track which is the chase song from \"Simple Plan and the Invisible Madman.\" This is another song that always reminds me of the chase scene from that episode whenever I listen to it. The first time I listened to this, I was surprised to discover that the version we hear in the episode is actually not the full song! There is bridge and another chorus that's cut off in the episode, but it made it on their album. I find it really neat how WB struck a deal with several up-and-coming artists (i.e. Simple Plan, Lindsay Pagano) during that early 2000s period to include them in an episode. It always felt very natural, and never felt forced in.\n\n5. I'd Do Anything by Simple Plan\n\nFrom: \"It's Mean, It's Green, It's the Mystery Machine\" - What's New, Scooby-Doo?\n\nThis is the last of the Simple Plan songs that made my list, and it's my favorite of them. To me, this is quintessentially that early 2000s rock sound, and I absolutely love it. This reminds me so much of the chase scene in the episode whenever I hear it, and it remains a favorite of mine that I listen to semi-frequently. I also think it's really cool that this is the only Scooby-Doo chase song to be charting on the Billboard Hot 100 around the time when it was used in the episode.\n\n4. Shining Star by Ruben Studdard\n\n​From: Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed Soundtrack\n\n​I tried to find the official videos to link for all of these, but this one did not appear to have one, as you can probably tell by the image of the cartoon fish in the top left corner rather than a picture of Ruben lol. This is another smooth R&B jam that I love for how funky the production it is. I quite like Ruben's voice as well. Like the other Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed song that made my list, this is a cover of an Earth, Wind and Fire song of the same name from 1975.\n\nI've also got a bit of a fun anecdote to share with this one. Back when I was in college, my math professor would always play music for a few minutes before class while everyone was coming in. I've never heard any of these other songs out in public, but oddly, my math professor would play this song at least once every couple weeks before class. I have no idea why, or if he was a Scooby-Doo fan or not, but it was really surprising to hear this haha.\n\n3. On Me by Thomas Rhett & Kane Brown featuring Ava Max\n\n​From: SCOOB! Soundtrack\n\nThis is another one from the SCOOB! soundtrack played during the end credits. While I consider myself pretty open in terms of music genre, I am generally not a fan of country. I enjoy \"Be Like That\" from Kane Brown and \"Memory\" to an extent, but I have not liked anything I've previously heard from Thomas Rhett. I have heard quite a few songs from Ava and have liked them. Surprisingly, Kane, Ava and Thomas have great chemistry together in the song. I will say it is a bit hard for me to tell Thomas and Kane's vocals apart due to the autotune haha, but overall I think their vocals sound great, and Ava's make a nice addition. The lyrics are once again very cute and feel good, and this is one I listen to more often than any of the previous ones. Also, fun fact if you didn't know, it appears there are two slightly different versions of this song. I was listening to the songs as I wrote my reviews up, and the music video version appears to make Ava's vocals at the end of chorus much quieter, whereas her vocals are the same volume throughout the whole chorus on the non music video version.\n\n2. Summer Feelings - Lennon Stella & Charlie Puth\n\nFrom: SCOOB! Soundtrack\n\nThis is the final song off the SCOOB! soundtrack that makes my list. It's the only song here I believe that didn't actually appear in a film or episode to any extent, but it was on the soundtrack. I'd previously only heard Lennon Stella on \"Takeaway\" (her collaboration with The Chainsmokers and Illenium), but I've heard a lot of Charlie Puth's music and like him as an artist. I think they sound great together, particularly in the final chorus. The production is very bubbly and atmospheric, and it works really well with their soft vocals. This is a standout in terms of Scooby-Doo soundtrack material IMO.\n\n1. You & I by Anarbor\n\nFrom: Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed Soundtrack\n\nI've talked about how I like that pop-punk sound previously in this post with the Simple Plan songs, so it seems only fitting that the #1 song here is \"You & I\" by Anarbor. It's another obscure one that was played briefly during Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins when Scooby and Shaggy first meet each other (and it's also played during the end credits). This is the only song of the bunch where I have any comments about the music video, but this music video is so cute. You can tell the band really had a lot of fun dressing up as monsters and playing in an old spooky barn. To me, the best music videos are always the ones that either tell a story, or where you can really tell the artist/band is having fun. I'm honestly not much of a fan of music videos where the artist is just posing or mindlessly dancing around. It's the ones where you can really tell the artist was passionate about making it that are the most enjoyable for me, and this one certainly fit the bill. The tone of the song is so carefree and lighthearted that you can't help but love it. I really love Anarbor's vocals here...and clearly I'm not the only one, since WB has put their cover of What's New, Scooby-Doo? on pretty much every DVD menu since lol. My personal head canon is that one of the WB executives is up in their room full on head-banging to Anarbor's What's New, Scooby-Doo? cover every night lol.\n\nThis was definitely an unorthodox post, but I hope you enjoyed reading it! I do have three more rankings posts written up that have been pre-written since October now (and I'll post them in the coming months), but I also don't want to get caught in the rut of having the monthly articles be rankings every single time. I plan to start doing some more editorial articles here at some point mixed in with rankings, just so there's a bit more of a balance than there has been lately. I really enjoyed writing this up and doing something different, so I'm excited to continue experimenting with different types of posts like this! :)"
