        "text": "If you’re considering buying an MP3 player, or are just wondering how much of your music collection will fit on to one, then this little utility could be just what you’re looking for.\n\nThe memory, or storage capacity, of an MP3 player is usually measured in GB (Giga Bytes), or MB (Mega Bytes) for the smaller/older players. However, the number of songs that your MP3 player can potentially store is not only determined by its memory capacity, but also by the bit rate of your MP3 tracks.\n\nIf you’re not sure of what a bit rate is, or what it has to do with things, then the previous article on What are bit rates? may help explain things for you.\n\nIf you’ve already got a collection of music in MP3 format (or one of the other popular music compression formats such as WMA or AAC), then your bit rates have already been set. However, when you’re converting your music from CD to MP3 (ripping as it’s called), you should be able to choose the bit rate most suitable to your requirements from within your chosen conversion software. 128 kbps is usually a good starting point as a compromise between sound quality and storage requirements.\n\nMP3 Song Capacity Calculator\n\nMP3 Song Capacity Calculator\n\nPlayer Memory Capacity: Bit Rate of Songs: Hours of Music: Typical No. Albums: 45 mins/album Typical No. Songs: 3:30 mins/song\n\nAssumptions\n\nThe MP3 Song Capacity Calculator makes a few assumptions for its calculations. As such the quoted results are only approximations and may vary from actual results. The key assumptions are:\n\nAverage album length is 45 minutes\n\nAverage song length is 3 minutes 30 seconds\n\nAll MP3 track data is 100% audio\n\nAll of the MP3 player’s memory can be utilised\n\nIf you’d like to use this calculator on your own website, please feel free to do so. All I ask is that you put a link next to the calculator crediting me and linking back to this web page.\n\nThe JavaScript for this and the following storage capacity calculator is:\n\nDownload this file: song-calc.js [2.4kB]\n\nMP3 Storage Capacity Calculator\n\nThis simple little calculator estimates how much space will be required to store your CD collection on your computer’s hard disc or portable music player based on a given bit rate:\n\nMP3 Storage Capacity Calculator\n\nNo. Albums: at 45 mins/album Bit Rate of Songs: Storage Required:\n\nAssumptions\n\nThe above MP3 Storage Capacity Calculator makes a few assumptions for its calculations. As such the results are only approximations. The key assumptions are:\n\nAverage album length is 45 minutes\n\nA single piece of album artwork is added to each album at 50kB\n\nThe HTML code for the two calculators is:"
