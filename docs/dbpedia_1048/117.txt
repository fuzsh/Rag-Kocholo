(Chorus:)

Funny But It Seems That It′s The Only Thing To Do,

Hanging Around, Hanging Around.

(Verse 1: Randy)

Nah Mate,

It's A Whole New Date,

Time For Randy Now To Eat Up

Off A Whole New Plate.

My Estates Way Too Bate

To Try And Move Weight,

I′m Too Popular

Everybody Knows My Face So.

(Hanging Around)

For Me Is Out The Question,

I Gotta Make Move's No Less Than

A G For A Session,

Letting The Streets Know We Rep Them

Still Here For You

But Never Really Left Them.

Its... (Funny)

That Some People Think Were Pop,

But After The Awards Then

Its Back To The Blocks.

And After The Applause,

Then Its Silence When It Stops,

And Its Back To The Violence, And

The Sirens And The Shots.

(Nadia:)

I Know Its Kinda Funny

But It Seems The Only Thing To Do

(Only Thing To Do)

Whats Holdin You Down

Is Hanging Around

Its About Time To Break Through

(Chorus: x2)

Funny But It Seems That It's The Only Thing To Do

(Coz Everybody′s Just)

Hanging Around

(And Everybody′s Just)

Hanging Around.

(Verse 2: Rock)

Coming Up On The Blocks,

I Was Up In All The Usual Spots,

In The Streets With Rest Of The Have Nots,

Coz That's All I Have Got.

Robbing Sweeties Outta The Shops,

Momma See Me Tell Me Lil Rock,

You Need To Stop Just

(Hanging Around)

Wont You Try Something New?

There′s So Many Things That You Could Pursue.

I Know Your Trying To Be Cool

And Keep It True Wit Your Crew.

And Some Time's

(It Seems That It′s The Only Thing To Do)

Sorry Ma For All Of The Drama,

Its Hard, I Know That You Can't Take It

No Longer.

My God,

Let Me Help You Wipe The Tear From Your Cheek.

Acting Like I Don′t Listen

But I Hear When You Speak.

I Know Its Kinda Funny

But It Seems The Only Thing To Do.

(Only Thing To Do)

You Aint Holding Me Down

I Aint Hanging Around

This Is My Time Break Through.

(Chorus: x2)

Funny But It Seems That It's The Only Thing To Do

(Coz Everybody's Just)

Hanging Around

(And Everybody′s Just)

Hanging Around.

(Verse 3:)

(Funny)

Thought It Was Over For Me

But Im Still Standing On My Feet

(No More)

Hanging Around

(No More)

Hanging Around

Finally Found A Way

To Make It Threw The Rainy Days

(No More)

Hanging Around

(No More)

Hanging Around... Its Soooo... Funny

(Chorus: x3)

Funny But It Seems That It′s The Only Thing To Do

(Coz Everybody's Just)

Hanging Around

(And Everybody′s Just)

Hanging Around.

(Coz Everybodys Just)

Hanging Around

(And Everybodys Just)

Hanging Around

O0o0hh
