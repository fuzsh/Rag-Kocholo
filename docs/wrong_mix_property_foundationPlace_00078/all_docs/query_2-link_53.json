        "text": "Oracle Corp. chief legal officer Stuart Levey earned almost $12.8 million in total compensation during 2023, his first year leading the company’s law department.\n\nLevey joined Oracle late last year as a replacement for longtime legal chief Dorian Daley, who postponed her retirement until the technology giant finalized a $23 million settlement of foreign bribery charges levied by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOracle disclosed in a proxy statement filed Sept. 22 that Levey received nearly $558,000 in base salary, a $650,000 cash bonus, and more than $11.5 million in stock awards in fiscal 2023. Levey’s full-year base salary going forward will be $950,000 with an annual target bonus of $750,000, Oracle said.\n\nAt Oracle, Levey oversees all legal matters and manages a “large-scale multinational legal team,” per its proxy. His duties require him to play a “critical role in setting the strategy for Oracle’s litigation and regulatory matters,” as well as take the lead on compliance and ethics, corporate governance, data protection and privacy, and intellectual property, the company said.\n\nOracle didn’t immediately respond to a comment request about Levey or its in-house legal group. Levey’s compensation package at Oracle is comparable to the roughly $13 million in pay that Deborah “Dev” Stahlkopf earned last year in her first as the top lawyer at Cisco Systems Inc.\n\nOracle is now based in Austin, Texas, having announced three years ago the relocation of its headquarters from Silicon Valley. The company’s stock price plunged earlier this month after it reported a slowdown in the growth of its cloud business. Oracle’s founder, chairman, and chief technology officer, billionaire Larry Ellison, earlier this year sold off $640 million in company stock.\n\nDaley had been Oracle’s top lawyer since 2007 when she succeeded former law chief Daniel Cooperman. During her nearly two decades at the legal helm, Daley led Oracle through numerous high-stakes legal fights, including a long-running copyright battle with Alphabet Inc.’s Google."
