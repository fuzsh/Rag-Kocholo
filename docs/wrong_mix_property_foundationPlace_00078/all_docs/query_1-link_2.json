Whether it’s a national grocery chain shaving two full days off its financial close, a regional health system simplifying and enhancing human resources processes, or a financial software provider improving efficiency and customer satisfaction with generative AI, there’s already a lot to celebrate in 2024.\n\nWhich is why we’re thrilled to announce the winners of the 2024 Oracle Excellence Awards. These awards celebrate organizations that leverage Oracle’s cloud application and infrastructure technologies to drive business success, showcasing the achievements of some of the world’s most innovative and impactful companies.\n\nThese companies are using Oracle Cloud services to drive tangible, bottom-line results through their artificial intelligence, enterprise resource planning, supply chain management, human resources, marketing, IT, and sustainability initiatives. Here’s a look at this year’s honorees."
