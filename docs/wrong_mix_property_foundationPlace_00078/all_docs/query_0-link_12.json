        "text": "Peel Region becomes the first to migrate its water billing system to Oracle's new cloud service billing platform.\n\nOn March 26, 2024, Oracle selected Peel Region as the runner-up finalist of the prestigious Oracle’s 2024 Energy and Water Innovator Award. Our success was recognized in Austin Texas on March 25, 2024, at the annual Oracle Energy and Water Customer Edge Conference and User Group.\n\nAccording to the Oracle Corporation - 2024 Energy & Water Awards, the Innovator Award celebrates businesses that have created a culture of innovation that ultimately benefits “its” customers, stakeholders, and industry.\n\nIn November 2023, Peel Region upgraded and migrated its water billing system from a self-hosted version of Oracle's Customer Care and Billing to the Customer Care and Billing Cloud Service platform. This upgrade made us the first to implement Oracle’s cloud service billing platform globally and its success led to our nomination by the Red Clay vendor.\n\nThe benefits of this cloud-based billing system include:\n\nEnsuring business reliability with a fully supported and up-to-date system.\n\nA stable system for billing and collecting an annual revenue of $500 million.\n\nEnabling a new rate structure approved by Regional Council.\n\nImproved features for better customer interaction.\n\nAlignment with corporate digital strategy for online services.\n\nThe upgrade and migration of the water billing system to Oracle’s Customer Care and Billing Cloud Service platform is an excellent example of our IT division's cloud-first approach to technology solutions.\n\nIn addition, this is an important step to advance our Digital Strategy where our goal is to offer an engaging and effortless experience for both our residents and employees. Our strategy is also focused on digitizing our services, making accessing information easier, and improving service efficiency. We are committed to achieving these objectives through sustainable, integrated business and technology modernization."
