        "text": "FACTS:\n\nPlaintiff-Appellants were Colorado or Arizona residents and were formerly employed by Oracle as Instructors (i.e., customer trainers). They traveled to and worked in various states, including California, as part of their jobs. At various times, they worked days longer than eight hours and weeks longer than forty hours entirely in California, but did not receive overtime pay from Oracle.\n\nOracle’s Instructors brought a class action alleging misclassification as exempt employees and seeking overtime compensation. Oracle settled claims by California residents but did not settle claims by the Colorado and Arizona residents. Relevant to the proceedings before the California Supreme Court were (1) a claim relating to work performed in California for overtime pay due under Cal. Lab. Code §§ 510(a) and 1194; (2) a restated version of the same claim, for restitution under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17203; and (3) a claim relating to work performed in other states for restitution under the California UCL for violation of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. § 207(a). (The reason for restating claims under the UCL is that the statute of limitations provides for a longer limitations period for UCL claims than for freestanding Labor Code violations.)\n\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY:\n\nBased on stipulated facts, the district court for the Central District of California granted summary judgment to Oracle. It held that the Labor Code and UCL did not apply to the nonresident Plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs appealed. The Ninth Circuit initially reversed as to claims (1) and (2) and affirmed as to claim (3), but then, after both parties filed petitions for rehearing, withdrew its opinion and certified underlying questions of California law to the California Supreme Court.\n\nAfter the California Supreme Court answered the questions certified to it, the Ninth Circuit resolved the remaining issues in the appeal. See Sullivan v. Oracle Corp., 662 F.3d 1265 (9th Cir. 2011).\n\nISSUES:\n\nDoes the California Labor Code apply to overtime work by nonresident employees performed in California for a California-based employer?\n\nDoes the UCL apply to such overtime work?\n\nDoes the UCL apply to overtime work performed outside California for a California-based employer by nonresident employees if the employer failed to comply with the FLSA?\n\nHOLDING:\n\nThe Labor Code applies to overtime work performed in California for a California-based employer by nonresidents. Claims for such violations can serve as predicates for claims under the UCL. But claims for overtime compensation for work performed by nonresidents in other states cannot serve as predicates for UCL claims.\n\nANALYSIS:\n\nThe Court first engaged in statutory construction to determine whether the Labor Code required overtime compensation for work performed by nonresidents in California for a California-based employer. By their terms, the overtime provisions apply to work performed in the state without reference to the employee’s place of residence, but there are several other statutory bases for exemptions (see Lab. Code §§ 510(a)(1)-(3), 511, 514, 515). Additionally, exempting nonresidents from the overtime laws would encourage employers to import unprotected workers from other states, and California has a strong interest in governing overtime compensation for work performed in California.\n\nOracle had argued that construing the overtime provisions to cover the work at issue here would violate the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution because it would result in a substantial burden on out-of-state businesses. The Court rejected this argument as entirely conjectural and unsupported by the record. Additionally, the work at issue in this case was for California-based, not out-of-state, employers.\n\nSecond, the Court considered whether the Plaintiffs’ home states’ overtime laws should govern rather than California’s under conflict-of-laws principles. The Court applied its three-step governmental interest analysis. The first step is to determine whether the law differs between jurisdictions. The Court found that California’s overtime law clearly differs from that of the Plaintiffs’ home states in multiple ways.\n\nThe second step is to determine whether the jurisdictions have conflicting interests in the application of their laws. It found that California has a strong interest in preventing the evils associated with overwork inside California, and that neither Arizona nor Colorado had asserted an interest in regulating overtime work performed in other states or in disabling their residents from being protected by California overtime law while working there. Additionally, one state cannot project its regulatory regime into the jurisdiction of another state. Accordingly, there was no genuine conflict.\n\nThe third step is to determine which jurisdiction’s interest would be more impaired if its law were not applied. Assuming, arguendo, that a genuine conflict existed, the Court found that there would be greater impairment to California’s interests if its laws were subordinated, because California’s interests would be sacrificed even though Colorado’s overtime law expressly does not apply outside its borders and Arizona has no state overtime law of its own. The Court also addressed an alternative argument that the other states have expressed an interest in providing a business-friendly environment, which would be impaired by applying California law. The Court found that this interest is not implicated by subjecting Oracle, a California-based employer, to California law.\n\nThus, the Court concluded that California’s Labor Code governed the overtime work at issue as a matter of both statutory construction and conflict of laws.\n\nRegarding the second certified question—the application of the UCL to the Labor Code violations in this case—precedent established that failure to pay legally required overtime is an unlawful business act or practice under the UCL. In light of the Court’s answer to the first certified question, it follows that the UCL also applied in this case.\n\nRegarding the third certified question—whether the UCL reaches FLSA claims regarding overtime worked in other states—the Court found that the traditional presumption against extraterritorial application of state laws applied. Specifically, neither the UCL nor its legislative history provides a basis for concluding that the Legislature intended the UCL to operate extraterritorially. The only potentially relevant intra-California occurrence was the employee classification decision made at Oracle’s California headquarters. But this was not unlawful in itself; the FLSA was not violated until Oracle failed to pay overtime. It was not established that the underpayment of wages or any other event actually relevant to the claims under the UCL for FLSA violations occurred in California. Therefore, the UCL could not operate with respect to the failure to pay nonresidents overtime compensation for work performed outside California.\n\nTAGS:\n\novertime, wage and hour, labor code, nonresident, out-of-state employee, conflict-of-laws, unfair competition law, UCL, unfair business practice, fair labor standards act, FLSA, employment litigation, police power, commerce clause, extraterritorial application, certified question\n\nRELATED CASES:\n\nSullivan v.
