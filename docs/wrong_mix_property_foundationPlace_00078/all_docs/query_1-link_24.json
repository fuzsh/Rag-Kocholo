        "text": "Oracle Specialized Partner of the Year - BI Applications\n\nKPI Partners is the recipient of the 2012 Oracle Specialized Partner of the Year in the area of business intelligence applications. KPI also won the same award in 2011 when it was known as the Titan Award and is the only firm ever to win this award 2 years in a row. (see Press Release)\n\nKPI was also honored with an Honorable Mention designation for a services industry solution in the area of travel & transportation.\n\nOracle North America Titan Award\n\nKPI Partners received top honors in the Business Intelligence Application Solution category of the Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN), North America Titan 2011 Partner Awards, the most prestigious honor a partner can receive.\n\nThe Oracle North America Oracle Titan Awards are given by Oracle to its leading alliances, recognizing solutions and business practices developed or delivered within Oracle’s fiscal year. These awards recognize alliance excellence in a number of categories, including sales, marketing and solution development. Nominations for the awards were submitted directly by and were open to all alliances in the Oracle PartnerNetwork.\n\nOracle Pillar Partner for Business Intelligence\n\nKPI Partners has been selected by Oracle Corporation as a Business Intelligence (BI) Pillar Partner for multiple regions within North America.\n\nThis recognition is part of the recent “Partner Sales Readiness Verification Initiative” announced by Oracle. The initiative was developed to identify partners in North America with proven expertise in strategic technology areas such as Business Intelligence, Identity Management and Fusion Middleware. Oracle will nominate and select 1 or 2 partners for each region which must then pass stringent competency requirements within the designated pillar technology.\n\nOracle has designed this program to further collaborate with partners and drive revenue based on specialization within the market. Members of the KPI Partners staff have completed the necessary verification testing and are already working to support the Oracle field sales team by sharing implementation best practices and BI project success stories.\n\nOracle Platinum Partner\n\nKPI Partners is proud to have achieved the coveted Platinum Partner status in the Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN). As one of the highest levels of membership within the Oracle PartnerNetwork, this prestigious partner status recognizes KPI Partners for our in-depth expertise and excellence across the entire suite of Oracle BI & EPM Solutions.\n\nWith this platinum status, KPI Partners and our clients benefit by receiving the highest level of engagement, commitment, and benefits available to OPN partners. This means that KPI Partners will be provided with Oracle's direct and continuous support. Also, KPI Partners will have in-depth knowledge of, and access to, forthcoming product enhancements and new product developments, thereby allowing us to better serve our clients."
