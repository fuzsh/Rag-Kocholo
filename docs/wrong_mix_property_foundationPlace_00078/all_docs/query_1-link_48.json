        "text": "Larry Ellison’s total compensation grew by about 12 times the amount seen the year prior.\n\nA successful 2022 fiscal year for Oracle included huge growth in the pay packages of some of its top executives, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOracle co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison’s total compensation grew by about 12 times the amount seen the year prior, according to the documents. CEO Safra Catz’s total compensation grew about 13 times.\n\nOracle’s 2022 fiscal year ended May 31, 2022.\n\n[RELATED: Oracle Cloud, Licensing Demand Leads To Strongest Organic Growth In Over 10 Years]\n\nThe median global employee at Oracle made $75,043 in fiscal year 2022, according to the documents. Catz’s total compensation is 1,842 times that amount.\n\n“This total compensation amount was atypically high due to the modification of the PSOs [performance stock options] in fiscal 2022 to extend the PSO performance period by three fiscal years,” according to Oracle.\n\nCatz’s annualized compensation value without performance stock options brings the compensation down to 334 times the pay for the median global Oracle employee.\n\nFor all of fiscal year 2022, Oracle reported revenue of $42.44 billion, up 5 percent over last year’s $40.48 billion. Cloud services and license support revenue rose 5 percent to $30.17 billion, cloud license and on-premises license revenue grew 9 percent to $5.88 billion, hardware revenue fell 5 percent to $3.18 billion, and services revenue increased 6 percent to $3.21 billion.\n\nThe first quarter of Oracle’s 2023 fiscal year also showed healthy growth, with $11.4 billion in total revenue for the quarter, up 18 percent year over year. Recent acquisition Cerner contributed $1.4 billion to total revenue.\n\nHere’s a look at the fiscal 2022 compensation packages for Oracle’s top executives.\n\n4. Dorian Daley\n\nDorian Daley, the company’s executive vice president and general counsel, received $14.9 million in total compensation in fiscal year 2022, according to the SEC documents. Her total compensation increased about 30 percent year over year.\n\nDaley’s total compensation included a base salary of $890,000 in fiscal year 2022, an increase of about 2 percent over her base pay in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. She also received about $13 million worth of stock awards, according to the documents.\n\nDorian Daley received a $1 million cash bonus “in recognition of Ms. Daley’s significant contributions to Oracle’s legal strategy and successes,” according to the SEC documents. She was eligible to receive between $750,000 and $1.5 million as a bonus.\n\nHer pay came from a “significant role and responsibilities overseeing all legal matters at Oracle and managing a large-scale multinational legal team in addition to her contributions to Oracle’s commercial business and executive sponsorship program and her ongoing engagement with our large international customer base.”\n\nThe SEC documents continue: “In particular, Ms. Daley plays a critical role in setting the strategy for Oracle’s litigation and regulatory matters and provides leadership in the areas of compliance and ethics, data protection and privacy, intellectual property and corporate governance, among other responsibilities.”\n\nDaley received about $8,100 in “other compensation,” which included $5,100 toward her 401(k) and about $3,000 in flexible credits to cover the premiums of her benefit plans, according to the documents. Like Catz and Screven, Daley received $154 for legal counsel fees.\n\nDaley announced in June that she intends to retire from Oracle, according to an SEC filing. Although she intended to retire in August, “Daley and Oracle have elected to extend her employment for a short period of time to further help with the transition of her duties,” according to the company. “There has been no change in her intent to retire.”\n\nShe joined the company in 1992, according to the company. She has served as general counsel since 2007, according to Bloomberg.\n\n3. Edward Screven\n\nEdward Screven, Oracle’s executive vice president and chief corporate architect, received $22.1 million in total compensation for fiscal year 2022, according to SEC documents. That is about 60 percent higher than his total compensation the year prior.\n\nScreven’s compensation package included a salary of $900,000 in fiscal year 2022, an increase of about 12 percent from his base pay in fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n\nScreven received a $3.9 million cash bonus for fiscal year 2022 and $17.3 million worth of stock awards, according to the documents.\n\nHis total pay package includes $8,000 in “other compensation.” Other compensation includes $5,250 toward his 401(k), about $3,000 in flexible credits to cover benefit plans premiums and $154 in legal counsel fees.\n\nScreven “drives technology and architecture decisions across all Oracle products and leads company-wide strategic initiatives, including industry standards and security,” according to the company.\n\n“He is responsible for Oracle Labs, which identifies, explores, and transfers new technologies that have the potential to substantially improve Oracle’s - and customers‘ - business” and is “responsible for many of Oracle’s best-known open-source programs including Java, Oracle Linux, MySQL, and VirtualBox,” according to Oracle.\n\n2. Safra Catz\n\nOracle CEO Safra Catz, 60, received $138.2 million in total compensation for fiscal year 2022, about 13 times her total compensation the year prior, according to SEC documents.\n\nShe received $129.3 million in option awards, which she did not receive last year, leading to the larger total compensation package.\n\nHer pay package includes $950,000 in base pay for the fiscal year, her same base pay since fiscal year 2012, according to SEC documents.\n\nLike Ellison, Catz also received a $7.8 million performance-based cash bonus, and she received no new equity awards.\n\nCatz received $168,000 in “other compensation,” which included $5,100 for her 401(k), $9,546 in flexible credits to cover benefit plan premiums and $153,000 in security costs for her primary residence.\n\nOracle paid for a video surveillance system at Catz’s primary residence plus “the costs associated with previously leased office space for executive protection staff that was located near her primary residence.”\n\nCatz also received $154 for legal counsel fees, according to the documents.\n\n1. Larry Ellison\n\nOracle co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, 78, collected $138.7 million in total compensation for fiscal year 2022, according to the SEC documents. That amount is about 12 times his total compensation the year prior due in part to option awards he didn’t receive last year.\n\nEllison’s pay package includes his $1 in annual base pay that he’s received since fiscal year 2011, according to SEC documents. He received a performance-based cash bonus of $7.8 million, about 20 percent less than the bonus he received the prior fiscal year.\n\n“Although Mr. Ellison has a significant equity interest in Oracle, the Compensation Committee believes his annual compensation package is necessary to maintain the focus of his visionary drive and his active role in our operations, technology, strategy and growth,” according to the SEC documents.\n\nEllison received option awards equating to $129.3 million. And he received $1.6 million in “other compensation.”\n\nOther compensation included $5,100 for Ellison’s 401(k) and $648 in “flexible credits used toward covering the premiums for cafeteria-style benefit plans, including life insurance and long-term disability benefits.”\n\nOracle paid $1.6 million in security-related costs and expenses for Ellison’s primary residence, according to the documents. He pays for the security at his other homes.\n\nThe company also paid for about $7,600 worth of legal counsel fees for Ellison. “We hire legal counsel to assist our executives with complying with reporting obligations under applicable laws in connection with their personal political campaign contributions,” according to the documents.\n\nEllison’s pay package didn’t include any new equity awards, according to the documents. He is the largest Oracle stockholder, owning about 42.9 percent of the company’s common stock, according to the documents."
