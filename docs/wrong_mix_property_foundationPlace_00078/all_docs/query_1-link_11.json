        "text": "Oracle has been named the overall winner of Ventana Research’s 15th Annual Digital Innovation Awards for its Oracle ME employee experience platform.\n\nThe Digital Innovation Awards highlight technology providers that exemplify innovation and strive to create solutions that improve people, processes, information, and technology. This awards program recognizes achievements in innovation across the entire technology industry, including analytics, customer experience, data, digital business, digital technology, human capital management, marketing, office of finance, office of revenue, and operations and supply chain.\n\nThe Overall Digital Innovation Award recognizes one innovation among all submitted that judges believe will most successfully maximize value across the enterprise. All 30 finalists in the individual award categories were considered for this prestigious award and Oracle ME was selected as the highest scoring product.\n\nPart of Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM), Oracle ME (My Experience) is a complete employee experience platform that helps organizations increase employee engagement and ensure employee success. The platform delivers a better way to work by providing contextual and guided experiences that strengthen workplace relationships and allow employees to provide continuous feedback. It also enables managers to track and act on real-time employee sentiment, while helping HR teams deliver personalized employee communications and support their entire workforce with direct access to the tools they need, when they need them.\n\n\"The voice of the employee is more important than ever for organizations that want to attract and retain the best talent. Many companies have struggled with this because they didn't have the tools available to listen and respond to their employees' changing needs. Oracle ME is a direct answer to this problem,\" said Quincy Valencia, vice president and research director, Ventana Research. \"For our annual Digital Innovation Awards, we evaluate a wide range of technologies that help organizations manage their most important assets—including people. This year, Oracle ME stood out as the most innovative solution for its comprehensive approach to one of the biggest challenges facing employers today: building an experience that keeps employees engaged, productive, and happy.\"\n\nAs part of the Digital Innovation Awards’ scoring process and methodology, Ventana Research examines the submissions to evaluate not only the technology’s innovative approach, but also the best practices it supports, the degree of team involvement, the technology’s business impact and value, and how it applies to the customer’s people, processes, information, and technology.\n\n“We believe Oracle ME is unlike anything else on the market. It is the only complete employee experience platform that empowers talent to connect, grow, and thrive. And that has now been validated by Ventana Research,” said Chris Leone, senior vice president of development, Oracle Cloud HCM. “Employee needs and values have shifted over the past few years, and organizations need to listen more intently to build trust and empathy with their workforce. Knowing the whole employee is critical to succeed in today’s market and we’re committed to helping customers nurture talent and better engage employees.”"
