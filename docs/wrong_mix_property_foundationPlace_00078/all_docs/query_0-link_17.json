        "text": "Frequently asked questions\n\nWho can enter?\n\nThe HR Heroes are for any organization that uses Oracle Fusion HCM Cloud in HR and has done extraordinary things in the workplace to make work more human. This includes driving exceptional focus on the employee experience and overall well-being.\n\nAre the HR Heroes Awards global?\n\nYes, with very few exceptions. Review the program rules (PDF) for any current restrictions.\n\nIs this a new version of the Rubies Awards?\n\nYes. HR has been at the frontlines of one the most challenging times in history for people and business and we wanted to create a new program to recognize that.\n\nWhat are Oracle’s goals for the program?\n\nWe have two main goals. To celebrate our extraordinary customers and, to showcase the remarkable success stories of these customers on Oracle.com.\n\nHow will winners be recognized?\n\nFinalists and winners are recognized on the Oracle HR Heroes Awards web page and are celebrated via various social communications activities. Winners are also presented with a trophy in recognition of their achievement. Depending on current conditions, the announcement of finalists and winners may take place during a virtual event or at a live, in-person event.\n\nHow many finalists will be announced in each category?\n\nThis year, for the HR Heroes Awards, we will not be announcing finalists, just winners.\n\nCan I submit an entry on someone else’s behalf?\n\nYes. If you know of a person or organization that deserves recognition, please do. Be sure to include their contact details so we can reach out and see if they want to participate.\n\nCan I enter more than one category?\n\nAbsolutely. However, each organization may only submit one nomination per category. If nominations are submitted by one organization for additional categories, each nomination must be materially different than any others submitted.\n\nWhat makes a winning entry?\n\nOur judges are looking to highlight some of the incredible stories emerging in recent years, where people in HR are putting employee experience, equal opportunities and overall employee well-being front and center. It helps considerably to include metrics and measurable results to demonstrate the extent of the impact HR has had on people and business.\n\nCan I change my nomination after the nomination period ends?\n\nUnfortunately, no. All information is final as of the nomination period end date, which is listed on the HR Heroes Awards home page."
