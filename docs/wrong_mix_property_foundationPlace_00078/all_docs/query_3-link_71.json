        "text": "Oracle Partner Award Apps/SaaS for breakthrough innovations\n\nFrom September 18 - 21, 2023, business users, technology experts and visionary thought leaders from over 140 countries met to share knowledge at Oracle CloudWorld (#OCW23) in Las Vegas. The event kicked off with the presentation of this year's Oracle EMEA Cluster Partner Awards on the evening before, September 17, 2023. The award honors partners who drive innovation, accelerate business growth, or add value for customers. For the Europe North region, PROMATIS – specialist for intelligent business processes and Oracle digitization solutions – prevailed in the Innovation category and won the Oracle Award for Apps/SaaS as \"Innovation Partner of the Year 2023\".\n\nAs one of Oracle's most important solution partners, PROMATIS has been working closely and successfully on a national and international level with Oracle, world market leader for application and technology products, since 1990. As early as 2014, the process innovator and technology expert identified consulting, services, and turnkey solutions for Enterprise Cloud Services as an important element of corporate strategy and supports companies on their transformation path into a digital future. Successful digitization projects, for example, are characterized by a cultural change that goes hand-in-hand with the use of modern cloud-based enterprise applications. After all, digitized business processes only ensure perfect usability and best performance if they are also accepted and lived by the user community. Together with leading German research institutes, PROMATIS has been working for years on the development of methods, models and software tools that ensure improved user involvement in implementation projects through new forms of project communication and in doing so promote digital adoption. Here, the current research focuses on the development of AI-based process improvement systems.\n\nAs part of the Oracle Innovation Award, partners who have developed groundbreaking, thought-leadership-level solutions to help Oracle customers realize their challenges have been honored. PROMATIS developed business process reference models – based on the cloud-based Horus Business Process Platform – which are used in Oracle digitization projects. Under the product label BP4Apps ('Business Processes for Oracle Cloud Applications'), the company created modules for Oracle Cloud Applications and NetSuite ERP. The industry-independent models are currently being extended with industry specifics, e.g., for healthcare, high-tech manufacturing, and retail.\n\n\"The basic idea is to familiarize future users as early as possible with the digitized business processes that are new to them, and to design an adaptation to customer-specific requirements together. The models accompany the users from the first system introduction to the later usage phase and are therefore an essential aspect for high customer satisfaction while achieving business process excellence,\" adds Dr. Frank Schoenthaler, CEO of the PROMATIS Group."
