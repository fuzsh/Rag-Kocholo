        "text": "Mannai Corporation, an Oracle Platinum Partner and the largest system integrator in Qatar, was honoured with the Application Partner of the Year 2011 and the Exadata Partner of the Year 2011 awards. These two were out of the six awards announced by Oracle at GITEX. Mannai Corporation was selected out of 1000+ partners from across 70 countries in the Middle East and Africa. These awards are to recognize partners who have demonstrated proven and consistent capability to deliver innovative solutions to customers. It is undoubtedly a great honour not only for Mannai but also for Qatar. This demonstrates Mannai’s ability to introduce latest Oracle business and technology solutions and reinforces Qatar’s track record in implementing these IT technologies.\n\nLast year, Mannai was awarded the “Industry Partner of the Year 2010 Runner-up” for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region and “Industry Partner of the Year (2010) – Public Sector” for Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, by Oracle Corporation.\n\n“These awards are a testimony to our commitment to bring the latest technological solutions to our customers in Qatar in terms of promoting, adopting and leveraging cutting edge information technology trends and solutions”, said Moni George, General Manager-Information Services, Mannai Corporation. “We would like to thank all our valued customers and partners for their consistent trust and confidence in Mannai Corporation and for their continued support which has made these achievements possible”, added Moni George.\n\nBinu MR (Head of Applications & Exadata) and Moni George (General Manager – IS) receiving the award from Alfonso Di Ianni, Sr. V.P,Oracle EMEA."
