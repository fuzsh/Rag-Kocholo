        "text": "Executive Mosaic is excited to announce that Kim Lynch, executive vice president of government defense and intelligence at Oracle, has won her first Wash100 Award for her leading role in widening the company’s public sector presence and driving cloud technology enhancement.\n\nThe annual Wash100 popular vote contest is in full swing! Cast your vote for Lynch at Wash100.com.\n\nFor 11 years, the prestigious Wash100 Award has annually highlighted key figures in the government contracting industry. Each Wash100 cohort is chosen from a competitive selection process that illuminates the past accomplishments and anticipated future influence of each winner.\n\n“I am honored to have received the Wash100 Award. This recognition is a testament to Oracle’s ongoing commitment to transforming our business to better serve customer missions through cloud technology. In my first year here at Oracle, we focused on enabling customer success by updating our Oracle technology to not only be the newest and most performative cloud, but to build on our 40-year history supporting the government’s most important missions through our data and AI platform,” Lynch said.\n\n“The journey of business transformation is both challenging and rewarding, and this award serves as validation that our strategic changes are aligned with a successful future. Thank you for this meaningful acknowledgment, which inspires us to continue making the right strides for our company and the clients we serve,” she continued.\n\n“Kim has taken the reins of Oracle, one of the GovCon industry’s most visible providers of cloud-enabled services in a furiously competitive sector. With a foundation of more than 24 years of executive leadership, Kim represents a gyroscopic force to focus Oracle’s aggressive and highly capable federal division amongst the agencies that require cloud excellence with more urgency than ever,” said Jim Garrettson, CEO of Executive Mosaic and founder of the Wash100 Award. “Kim’s attention to innovation, reliability, achievement, vision and leadership make her an obvious inclusion in our Wash100 list this year.”\n\nLynch joined Oracle in early 2023 after over two decades at Booz Allen Hamilton. Since her entry into the company, Oracle has demonstrated consistent growth in the federal marketplace with new authorizations, product launches and contract awards.\n\nIn August, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure received approval from the Intelligence Community to host Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information missions, opening up Oracle’s cloud offerings to the IC and Department of Defense.\n\nThis move gave the IC access to over 50 new cloud services on Top Secret networks, and additional services are expected to be authorized through a continuous accreditation process.\n\n“This latest authorization reinforces our commitment to accelerating our nation’s decision advantage to protect and advance our country,” Lynch said in the announcement.\n\nOracle, she said, is proud to provide its cloud services to support the important work of the IC and DOD.\n\nThat same month, Oracle introduced Secure Cloud Computing Architecture Landing Zone, a cloud-native computing architecture designed for the DOD. The product is built to host mission-critical workloads and store data at different levels of confidentiality, integrity and availability impact levels.\n\nThese milestones followed Oracle’s May completion of technical reviews from the Defense Information Systems Agency and Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program’s Joint Authorization Board for multiple cloud service offerings. OS Management, Cloud Guard, Tenant Manager and Management Agent were approved at DISA Impact Level 5 and the FedRAMP High baseline while Database Management Service, Operations Insights and Network Load Balancer were certified by FedRAMP for use within the infrastructure.\n\n“Oracle is committed to helping the DOD achieve its defense modernization priorities and stands ready to partner with the department to bring AI-enabled sensor-to-shooter capabilities, asset tasking, mission autonomy and real-time decision advantage tools to the mission,” Lynch commented.\n\nIn April, the company booked a $22.3 million task order from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to lengthen its access to Oracle’s software. This contract will run through March 2024.\n\nExecutive Mosaic congratulates Lynch on her first Wash100 Award win and looks forward to seeing her momentum continue. Don’t forget to vote for Lynch at Wash100.com."
