The award was introduced after the Lugano International Conference.\n\nDuring the full-scale russian war in Ukraine, Oracle was one of the first to stop its activities in the russian federation. The company supported Ukraine and helped move many registries and critical databases to a safe place; created their backup. Thanks to this, our state continued to function in wartime conditions. The company provided services to Ukraine for more than $3 million.\n\nOracle is an American technology corporation that is one of the three world leaders in IT products and services. In May 2022, Oracle joined the Lviv IT Cluster community.\n\n“Peace Award” is initiated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyi for companies, governments, and world politicians who support Ukraine the most."
