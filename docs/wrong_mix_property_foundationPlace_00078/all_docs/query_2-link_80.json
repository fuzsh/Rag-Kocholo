        "text": "Oracle Lighting Wins 2021 Louisiana Lantern Award\n\nThe Louisiana Lantern Awards provide an opportunity for the state to celebrate manufacturers from across Louisiana.\n\nOracle Lighting received the 2021 Louisiana Lantern Award last Wednesday evening during a special reception at the Hilton Baton Rouge Capitol Center. The company is one of eight manufacturers across the state to be recognized this year.\n\nThe Louisiana Lantern Awards provide an opportunity for the state to celebrate manufacturers from across Louisiana. The winning company for each district displays a contribution to the Louisiana economy and their local business communities through employee growth, increased revenue, facility expansion and community engagement. The Jefferson Parish Economic Development Commission (JEDCO) nominated Oracle Lighting for the special distinction this year. The lighting manufacturer was selected from the Greater New Orleans region to receive the coveted award.\n\nBorn from humble beginnings in a Metairie, Louisiana, garage, Oracle Lighting has grown into a global leader in the automotive lighting industry. The company was founded by Justin Hartenstein when he was just 18 years old. Now he and his wife, Tiffanie, run the business together, innovating in both product offerings and operations. Today, Oracle employs more than 30 full-time team members and has made nine appearances on the Inc Magazine “Inc. 500/5000 List”, which highlights the nation’s fastest-growing small businesses. Oracle plans to expand the company’s headquarters to double the size of the main facility in 2022, which will allow Oracle to create more jobs and significantly increase their production capabilities.\n\nIn November of 2021 Oracle also received an honor from SEMA, when it was named the 2021 Manufacturer of the Year. Oracle Lighting has won many local, national and international awards for its work. The company gives back whenever possible. As an example, Oracle helped to donate thousands of PPEs to first responders and health care workers at the start of the pandemic. The founders also serve a number of local charitable organizations.\n\nRace Winning Brands Welcomes Cary Redman to Its Team\n\nRace Winning Brands (RWB) welcomes seasoned industry professional Cary Redman to the RWB family as vice president of sales – automotive.
