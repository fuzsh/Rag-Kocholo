Comments: Barracks Patch – 2nd/17th Battalion (Royal New South Wales Regiment).

2nd/17th Battalion, The Royal New South Wales Regiment (2/17 RNSWR) is a reserve infantry battalion of the Australian Army and is part of the 8th Brigade, attached to the 2nd Division.

The battalion currently consists of a headquarters and four rifle companies spread out across a number of depots throughout the state of New South Wales.

The unit was formed in 1987, following a reorganisation of the Australian Army Reserve which saw the amalgamation of a number of Reserve units across Australia.

Through the 2nd Battalion and the 17th Battalion, the unit can trace its lineage back to 1860 and today it carries battle honours from both of these units, as well as the units of the Second Australian Imperial Force which fought during World War II.

Alpha Company traces its lineage to the NSW Scottish Rifles unit which was affiliated with the Black Watch (the Royal Highland Regiment). Until late 2010, Alpha Company members paraded in a khaki balmoral with a Black Watch tartan and RNSWR cap badge complete with red hackle; the ceremonial balmoral being navy blue. The khaki balmoral was presented to the qualified infanteers of the company upon completion of their second and final infantry module.
