        "text": "This page is a work in progress. The details provided are reliable but the page does not yet include a complete analysis of all the brigades and battalions, and details of a given unit’s locations and its place in the command structure may not be complete.\n\nBackground\n\nIn June 1915 the War Office authorised the raising of a number of Provisional Battalions, to be grouped into Provisional Brigades. The manpower would be provided by posting men of the depots and “third-line” training units of the Territorial Force who were classified “for home service only”. This classification may have been due to their medical rating or that they had not signed the Imperial Service Obligation. Had they not signed, the army could not legally transfer them to a different unit and this raised a question in the House of Commons. On 21 June 1915 it was confirmed that these battalions were not considered to be a new corps for the purposes of the Army Act and were simply for “ease of administration”. It was not the intention to separate home service men belonging to the same unit or in any way affect their military identity as a menber of the TF unit into which they had enlisted. In other words, it was a compromise way around the law that enabled a man to remain associated with his unit of enlistment but also to be usefully employed.\n\nAlthough in some cases a given provisional battalion was wholly manned by troops from a single regiment, the battalion was not considered to be part of that regiment and did not refer to the regiment in its title.\n\nMen who were serving with the provisional battalions became available for posting or transfer if they were medically reclassified as fit for general service, and from the introduction of the Military Service Act 1916 were also deemed available for overseas service if they met the medical standards required.\n\nBy March 1916 there were 40 Provisional Battalions under command of Provisional Brigades and another 19 that were independent and unbrigaded.\n\nThe Provisional Brigades also included provisional units of Royal Engineers, Army Service Corps, Royal Field Artillery and Royal Army Medical Corps. They were later called Mixed Brigades.\n\nOn 1 January 1917 under Army Council Instruction 2364 of 1916 the provisional infantry battalions were returned to the regimental system but not necessarily to the regiments that had originally formed them. Some of the brigades were disbanded as the various units under their command were transferred elsewhere.\n\nBrigades\n\n1st Provisional Brigade\n\nHeadquartered at Deal in Kent.
