I did not get to meet him, as he died about a good 9 years before I was born. I have only ever seen one picture of him during the war, but it was from World War 2.\n\nI also got the chance to read a letter that My Aunt has from him, saying how horrible the conditions were, that \"Life or rather existence has been the toughest I have ever known. The weather is extremely cold and we are out in it all the time. When it does warm up some days, the snow melts and it's impossible to stay dry, then the long nights set in, and one wonders how the human body can withstand such torture. I've battled to save my feet from trench foot and frostbite, but I am afraid I am fighting a lost cause. We are always outnumbered it seems and forever surrounded. If I had known what I was getting into, I would never have come back to the army. But I'm here and fate played me dirty again. I will just try to make the best of it and hope that I'll come out of it alive and that if I don't, then God will take care of me.\" He then ends the letter by saying they were getting orders to move out, so he had to go.\n\nFrom just that letter, I can tell that my grandfather went through a lot, but I'm wondering if anyone has any information on him or someone who served with him? I have been trying to find out everything I can about him because I don'tknow that much and would love to know more about his time in the army, as even when he was alive, it wasn't something he talked about at all, so no living family members know anything about his time there.\n\nThank you any & everyone in advance for your time and any info!!!"
