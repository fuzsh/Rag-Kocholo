        "text": "The Australian Army of 3rd September 1939 consisted of a small Permanent Force cadre mostly manning staff, Royal Australian Artillery fortress units and Royal Australian Engineer fortress units. The majority of the army formed part of the Citizen Military Force (CMF), which was also known as the militia.\n\nUnlike the United Kingdom, where both regular and Territorial Army units were integrated into a single force entitled the British Army, Australia maintained two distinct armies until the third year of the war. Many people have felt that this put Australia's security in jeopardy, especially during the dark days of 1942/3 when the Japanese threatened Australia with invasion.\n\nDuring September 1939 an all-volunteer force was raised for service world-wide. This force was entitled the Second Australian Imperial Force or 2nd AIF and was modelled after the First Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF) that was raised during the first world war. Units of the 2nd AIF had the prefix 2/ in front of the unit, hence the 2/4th Field Regiment.\n\nThe divisions and brigades of the CMF or Militia constituted the part-time home defence army and held this role until the start of the war with Japan on December 7, 1941. The Militia was not mobilized until that date, but all units did a series of brigade camps beginning at the outbreak of war and ending with full-time service on mobilization. For example, the 5th Battalion (The Victoria Scottish Regiment) of South Melbourne, Victoria did a 90 day camp at Mt. Martha starting on January 3, 1940, another 90 day camp from September to December 1940 at Mt. Martha, and a third camp there from 1 May to 29 July 1941. At the end of the later camp, the battalion remained on full-time service. The 5th's experience was repeated by the other units of the militia.\n\nDuring September 1939 an all-volunteer force was raised for service world-wide. This force was entitled the Second Australian Imperial Force or 2nd AIF and was modelled after the First Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF) that was raised during the first world war. Units of the 2nd AIF had the prefix 2/ in front of the unit, hence the 2/4th Field Regiment.\n\nBy 7 December 1941, the AIF had units in the Middle East, Malaya, Australia, the islands and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe role of the militia changed on the 19th February 1943, when the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act was passed. Commonly known as the Militia Bill, it defied the area by which those units could be stationed. It also allowed for Militia units to pass to AIF control if more than 75% of the units strength or 65% of the authorized \"war establishment\", whichever was greater, had volunteered to join the AIF."
