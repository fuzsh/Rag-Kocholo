        "text": "The following article is by Micah Parsons\n\nThe Battalion Battle Patch was a pair of red cotton bars which were worn vertically on each arm, the companies were identified by a strip of worsted tape which would have been worn on the epaulette, each company had the following colours, H.Q. Company – a mixture of all company colours which went in the following order blue, red, yellow and green, A Company – blue, B Company – red, C Company – yellow and D Company – green.\n\nAt the outbreak of war in August 1914, 6th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment (RWR) was part of the Warwickshire Infantry Brigade of the South Midland Division. The South Midland was one of the 14 divisions of the Territorial Force. By early 1915 the battalion was designated 1/6th RWR, and was a constituent part of 143 Infantry Brigade, 48th (South Midland) Division. Other units in the same brigade were: 1/5th, 1/7th and 1/8th Battalions RWR. The division sailed for France in March 1915.\n\nMy Great Grandfather Henry Nichols was born on Tuesday 26th January 1886 to Richard Nichols (aged 42) and Eliza Nichols (Jeacocks) (aged 36) in Earlsdon, Coventry. On Tuesday 21st September 1886, Henry was baptised at St. Thomas’s Church in Earlsdon. During 1891, a census was taken which lists Henry as a child of five years of age and during the same year Henry’s sister Mabel Nichols was born.\n\nBetween 1904 and 1911, Henry Nichols became a Salvationist and bandsman with The Coventry City Salvation Army Band where he played both the Cornet and Flugel Horn. In 1904 the band started to save for a new set of instruments and raised over £36.00 over the Christmas of 1904 under the leadership of Bandmaster Robert Minton. Each bandsman was given a set of greetings cards and were assigned to distribute these cards to streets within their local area. For the carolling period the band was split into three groups, where carolling's were both played and sung on various streets around Coventry which often took place after a long day at work for many of the bandsmen. Over two Christmas periods the band raised £70.00 with the band league raising a further £40.00 with other concerts and donations giving a total of £200.00 towards the new band's instruments. The £100.00 shortfall was met by two bandsmen (a full set of Salvation Army instruments cost around £315.00 in total).\n\nPicture no.1\n\nPicture no.2\n\nIn 1907, the band numbered around 36 players and were asked to spend a weekend in London which was known to be a hotspot of Salvation Army banding. The band's first concert of their time in London was at The Chalk Farm Salvation Army Corp also known as the farm where Bandmaster Punchard stated that “the playing all round was good and there was ample evidence of careful working out of pieces”. The band played again at the Monday night festival at The Regent Hall Salvation Army Corps also known as the rink alongside The Chalk Farm Salvation Army Band and The Regent Hall Salvation Army Band, a comment by a member of The International Staff Band stated that “Coventry Band was a surprise to many and it drew notice to the new emerging musicians”.\n\nPicture no.3\n\nOn the 19th December 1908, William Booth, the founder of The Salvation Army made a visit to Coventry and stated 'When we get up to the celestial city we shall say, what is the bright shining star up there? The reply will come back, tis a Coventry Bandsman'.\n\nPicture no.4\n\nIn 1909, Bandmaster Robert Minton resigned from the band for personal reasons and was replaced by Bandmaster Walter Coombes. In July 1909, the band conducted a pre-tour festival which included well known works for brass band including ‘Vesper Hymn’, ‘Chalk Farm’ and ‘Regent Hall’ Marches alongside selections including ‘Welsh Melodies’ and ‘Songs of Scotland’. Between Saturday 31st July 1909 and Saturday 7th August 1909 the band went on their first tour of Scotland via train visiting Anderton Govan, Paisley, Clydebank, Greenock, Gournock, Port Glasgow and finally Pollockshaw. On Sunday 1st August 1909 whilst the band was holding an open air service in Govan there was an estimated 60000 people in attendance.\n\nThe next major tour for the band happened around the August Bank Holiday in 1910, although there was some slight worry that this would go ahead as Bandmaster Robert Minton had injured his lead and the night before the tour was to commence Bertie Bertenshaw (who was a Bass Drummer in the band) father passed away the night before the tour and was unable to accompany the band.\n\nThe band travelled to St. Peter’s Port, Guernsey where it held a bandstand on the evening of Saturday 27th August 1910. The following day, on Sunday 28th August 1910, it was estimated that the band had already played to around 6000 people. On Monday 29th August 1910, the band played at St. Paul’s Church where the audience enjoyed the band's singing. On Tuesday 30th August 1910, the band travelled to L Islet where two festivals were held before leaving early on the morning of Wednesday 31st August 1910, to travel to St. Helier where two final concerts of the tour were held. The band returned to Coventry on Friday 2nd September 1910, arriving back at 11:30pm in an extremely tired state.\n\nOn Saturday 26th November 1910, at 24 years of age, Henry Nichols married Mary Elizabeth Hobley at St. Thomas’s Church in Earlsdon, Coventry and moved into their new house at 98 Westwood Road in Earlsdon. Henry’s best man at his wedding was William John Sherwin who also happened to be a bandsman in The Coventry City Salvation Army Band.\n\nPicture no.5\n\nThe following year on Saturday 25th November 1911, Mary (aged 18) and Henry’s (aged 25) first child was born which was a little girl who was later named Agnes Elizabeth Nichols or Annie for short. Two years later on Thursday 29th May 1913, Mary and Henry’s second child, Victor Henry Nichols was born. Both children were baptised in Stretton Upon Dunsmore.\n\nOn Tuesday 4th August 1914, British declared war on Germany, at this time Henry was living in Brinklow with his wife and two children and working and residing in Coventry during the weekdays. On Monday 7th September 1914, Henry Nichols attended the recruiting station in Rugby and joined The 12th Service Battalion, The Rifle Brigade being given the service number S/1208 and being sent to Brownlett Camp for training where he was assigned to D Company. At this time Henry was 28 years and 7 months and his height was 5 feet 4 5/8 inches, Henry weighed 112 pounds and had a waist size of 34 inches his eyes were described as being brown and his hair described as being dark with an overall dark complexion. Before joining up Henry had had a variety of different jobs including being a milkman but before joining he had been working as a labourer which suggests that times may have been hard for Henry and his family. Henry was vaccinated in October 1914 but after 32 days of training on Thursday 8th October 1914, Henry was discharged from the army due to his teeth which was an essential requirement for soldier’s who may have to eat hardtack which had a reputation for being so hard that it could break teeth if not soaked before being eaten. A positive twist in this story is that in May 1915, Henry’s third child, Olive Christina Nichols was born on Thursday 29th April 1915.\n\nAt the beginning of March 1916, Private Henry Nichols visited the recruiting office in Coventry and reported to Budbrooke Barracks for his initial training, having joined The 1/7th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment. After an initial period of training, Henry was posted to France and No.29 Infantry Base Depot at Rouen for further training before being posted to The 1/6th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment with service number 20731.\n\nAugust 1916\n\nAt the end of July, The 143rd Infantry Brigade stated that there had been 8 officers and 128 men killed in action (this figure includes men missing in action) and 12 officers and 391 men wounded in action with 3 officers wounded in action in the month of July 1916. The total fighting strength of The 1/6th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment on Monday 31st July 1916 was 42 officers and 643 other ranks.\n\nThe 1/6th Battalion, RWR, began August 1916 in training in Maison Rolland, where Captain T.H Lawley joined the battalion for duty on Tuesday 1st August 1916. On Friday 4th August 1916 and Monday 7th August 1916, 8 and 5 other ranks respectively joined the battalion. On Wednesday 9th August 1916 the battalion ate breakfast and then at around 6:05am marched to Gezaincourt the following day at around 6:19am the battalion marched to Lealvillers where 48 other ranks joined the battalion. The following days were spent in training, on Saturday 12th August 1916, 2nd Lieutenant F.T.J Belcher joined the battalion and on the following day 2nd Lieutenant A.E. Clarke was confirmed as being held as a prisoner of war.\n\nOn Monday 14th August 1916, the battalion marched to Bouzincourt setting off at around 8:00 am where 2 other ranks joined the battalion for duty. On Wednesday 16th August, the battalion moved into the line between Ovillers and Thiepval, relieving The 1/4th Battalion, The Gloucester Regiment from The 144th Infantry Brigade. Guides (which the battalion met at 2pm) from The 1/4th Battalion, The Gloucester Regiment guided the battalion up the line from Crucifix Corner (map reference W.11.D.1.9). The 1/7th Battalion, RWR was on the left of the battalion and The 1/4th Battalion, The Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry were on the right of the battalion. Three men were killed in action and ten men wounded.\n\nOne of these men was Private George Lefley (4520) who has no known grave and is remembered on The Thiepval Memorial to The Missing.\n\nPicture no. 6\n\nOn Thursday 17th August 1916, a counter attack was launched by the Germans but was stopped by the artillery, 2nd Lieutenant B.J.W Purchase and 2nd Lieutenant A.P. Haggo were wounded in action with 2nd Lieutenant Haggo remaining on duty, three other ranks were killed in action and eleven men wounded in action who included;\n\nPrivate William Alfred Cordin (5154) who was 21 years of age at the time of his death.\n\nPrivate Henry Richard Boffin (4928).\n\nPrivate Arthur Roberts (5182).\n\nLance Sergeant Alfred Whitehouse (1797).\n\nThe above individuals have no known graves and are remembered on The Thiepval Memorial to The Missing.\n\nThe below individuals were exhumed and reburied by a Canadian burial party on 12.05.1919 at Pozieres British Cemetery at Ovillers La Boisselle.\n\nPrivate R.

Throughout January, the battalion received 250 other rank reinforcements and were joined by 2nd Lieutenant A .R Drowning on Tuesday 9th January 1917.\n\nPreparations for moving back up to the front line were constantly in motion, a document entitled ‘Scheme of Medical Arrangements In The Event Of Heavy Fighting’ located within the war diary of The Assistant Director of Medical Services who was a Colonel C.A. Young notes that Regimental Aid Posts (RAP) which were to support the units of The 143rd Infantry Brigade were to be located at the following map coordinates 62C.H.30.D.3.2., 62C.H.30.C.3.1. and 62C.H.21.A.9.4. these locations were stated as being there to support the battalions in the left sector with regimental aid posts being set up for the right sector. Each Regimental Aid Post was allotted ten bearers from The Royal Army Medical Corps with a hundred bearers operating between The Regimental Aid Posts, The Royal Army Medical Corps Posts and The Advanced Dressing Stations. Stretcher bearers from The Royal Army Medical Corps were ordered to assist regimental bearers with bringing in the wounded from the forward posts to The Regimental Aid Posts with fresh sets of bearers being provided until the casualty reached the Advanced Dressing Station at Flaucourt and from here seriously wounded casualties would be moved at night by motor ambulance to a Main Dressing Station via Herbecourt and Eclusier, all ambulances were ordered to return to Flaucourt via the Cappy Chateau – Herbecourt Roads.\n\nPicture no. 12\n\nField Ambulance Posts (FAP) were set up in the trenches at Desire Post (62C.H.36.C.2.5.) which had the capacity for twenty stretcher cases, Achille Post (62C.N.5.A.7.7.) which had the capacity for twelve stretcher cases and Guerrier Post (62C.H.29.B.8.1.) which had the capacity for two stretcher cases. An Advanced Dressing Station (ADS) was set up in Flaucourt at 62C.N.4.A.3.3. which had a capacity for 25 stretcher cases.\n\nThe Main Dressing Stations (MDS) were set up and manned with The 1/3rd South Midland Field Ambulance located in Eclusier at map coordinates 62C.G.15.C.2.4. which had accommodation for four hundred lying cases. The 1/1st South Midland Field Ambulance was located in the Mairie in Cappy at map coordinates 62C.G25.B.3.5. which had the accommodation for three hundred lying cases and finally The 1/2nd South Midland Field Ambulance was located in the south of Cappy at map coordinates 62C.G.25.D.2.4. and had the accommodation for three hundred lying cases. Temporary accommodation was also found for two thousand sitting cases in the village of Cappy which was located close to The 1/1st South Midland Field Ambulance which as stated previously was located in the Mairie in Cappy. A Divisional Collection Station (DCS) was also located at map coordinates 62C.H.32.A.1.9.\n\nFebruary 1917\n\nOn the night of Thursday 1st February 1917, 1/6th Battalion RWR assembled and marched along the road from Herbecourt, travelling from Cappy to Biaches to relieve the 2nd Battalion of the 125th French Infantry Regiment which was based in the trenches to the south of Biaches. Three companies were in the line with one company left at Eclusier as a working company.\n\nPicture no. 13\n\nIn the book ‘Some Desperate Glory’ author Edwin Campion Vaughan (who served with The 1/8th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment) describes the scenes around Biaches in February 1917, he writes on Friday 2nd February 1917 that;\n\n'This evening we were engaged in carrying rations and tools and helping to pull the lewis gun cards. It was a very lonely road along which we marched, rising in a gradual slope until we reached the crest of the ridge. Here we had to wait until dusk before we could cross. Around us where we were halted stretched a large dump of wire, stakes, pickets, sandbags, mine timber and all the materials used in trench warfare'.\n\n'After about half an hour of sitting in the snow, and when we were thoroughly hilled, we were able to continue and at 7 o'clock we passed over the ridge and turned off the road onto a narrow track to the right. Ploughing through the snow, we came to the head of a trench, where we halted, it was now quite dark except for the dim light thrown up by the snow. We were not, of course, allowed to smoke and we stood freezing in the wind that blew steadily on to our flank from the icy darkness'.\n\nOn Friday 2nd February 1917 and Saturday 3rd February 1917, it was reported that a thin layer of snow lay on the ground with the sun shining brightly, there was intermittent artillery fire which wounded three other ranks and five other ranks respectively.\n\nOn Saturday 3rd February 1917, Vaughan states\n\n'At 6 p.m. Thomas and I set out with the company to carry the rations up to the line. This time we went straight up the road leading through Herbecourt. We had passed through the village and were descending the further slope, where all was dead quiet and peaceful, so that as I walked beside Thomas I had no qualms of fear, when he said in a low voice, \"if they start shelling, we will have to split up. You take the front two platoons onto the fields on the right and I will take the remainder onto the left\"'.\n\nPicture no. 14\n\nOn the afternoon of Sunday 4th February 1917, The 1/6th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment was heavily bombarded between 12:00 pm and 5 bombardment. During this period dugouts were blocked trapping men inside who due to the intensity of the bombardment could not be freed, where the trenches had not been blown by direct hits lay littered deep with debris. The bombardment was so deafening that orders were not understood. Casualties were all too numerous with the seriously wounded being unable to be evacuated. During this period of heavy artillery bombardment, Private Christopher Coling (21008) who had enlisted in June 1916 alongside other men from his home village of Grandborough was hit by artillery fire and died immediately from his wounds. It was only after the war that relatives of Christopher found out about the true nature of Christopher's death, just over a year later both of Christopher's older Brother, Philip and younger Brother, Arthur would be killed in action. Another soldier, Private Herbert Harold Kenny, who had joined in March 1916, was taking cover in his dug out when it received a direct hit from a German artillery shell and was killed outright. Herbert Kenny may still lie within that small field which faces La Maisonette and is remembered on the Thiepval Memorial.\n\nPicture no. 15\n\nSupport was provided by French artillery who were in the process of being relieved by the British Artillery of 48th South Midland Division however it was reported that the French Gunners were short of ammunition for their Guns and although British Guns were in position they had not yet registered the s.o.s line.\n\nFrom 5:40 pm onwards there was an intense barrage which focused on the front line and support trenches including Stetting Trench and the communication trenches leading to and from the front line. At 6:15pm, German raiding parties entered The British Front Line just left of B Company which was designated as the central company in the front line and began to move down the British trenches in both directions. The companies disposition in the front line were as follows C Company on the left, B Company in the centre and D Company on the right with A Company being in reserve in Eclusier. All surviving men of The 1/6th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment in the front line manned their Lewis guns and lee enfield rifles and gave rapid fire on the advancing German forces. However, in some places in the line there were woefully few men to defend their positions which were rapidly infiltrated by the German raiding parties. 2nd Lieutenant Belcher along with two serjeants of B Company met the German Raiding Party on the right and proceeded to throw bombs at the German Raiding Party who were held up in their progress. The other party of German raiders withdrew before reaching C Companies designated position. Lieutenant Harrison of C Company took a party of bombers to clear out the trenches, all of whom fell victim to the. incessant artillery fire with the exception being Lieutenant Harrison himself.\n\nBy 6.25pm The British Front Line was clear with the exception of the dead and dying of both sides which crowded the trenches. By this time B Company and C Company had cleared the remaining trenches and regained communication with each other. Throughout the night stretcher bearers worked to remove the wounded to the rear. During this period 2nd Lieutenant Belcher was found lying dead where he had made his last stand, he was 17 years old. The Battalion War Diary stated that thirty four men were killed of which four men died of wounds, alongside 66 men wounded and 14 men missing some of whom were captured and others who lay buried in their shelters. It was found that the raid had been conducted by The 1st Prussian Guards. A German was found half blinded by a bomb in the British Lines and another was found dying amongst the British dead.\n\nPicture no. 16\n\nThe grave of 2nd Lieutenant F.T.J. Belcher who had first joined the battalion on Saturday 12th August 1916 was assigned to B Company at the time of his death. 2nd Lieutenant Belcher was killed alongside two sergeants of his company.\n\nIn contrast to this account the German reports written after the war state the following course of events.\n\nTo our honoured leader in serious time. This fallen general also created the name Giftpille (which translates to poison pill). We started the attack on February 4th 1917 at 1pm with artillery and minnenwerfer. From planes they checked that the fire was hitting everywhere. at 2:30pm they stopped firing for half an hour then they fired again from 3pm to 3:45pm. We were surprised that the counter fire from the enemy was only weak and without much plan. They shot again from 4:30pm to 5pm and then from 5:30pm to 6pm they started Vernichtungsfeuer (destruction fire) onto the trenches. The enemy's artillery responded again only sparsely.\n\nAt 5:45 the German troops went over the top and broke into the enemy's trenches which they found unexpectedly strong. The trenches were less destroyed than we thought so we lost some soldiers and got into some trouble but we managed to break into the trenches and an embittered fight started.\n\nThe enemy was forced out of the first line of trenches and the pioneers blew up the trenches. Twelve British prisoners of war were taken. The success was \"funny\" (spaßig) the front line reported they had severe losses and brought in many injured people, but as they came closer the carrier people brought no wounded but 12 British prisoners, who \"resisted their capturing with their characteristic tenacity and the pride which is typical for this race and resisted with fighting with their arms and legs and so they had to be dragged.\n\nThe success was important as they thought before that there were English troops only north of the Somme, to know they are also in the south was worth the losses that Giftpille cost, two raiding patrol leaders Leutnant der reserve Kirmz and Kuhn were wounded (Kuhn severely), furthermore ten men wounded, one dead. Losses through artillery fire were one dead and fifteen wounded. The following days were quiet, on 8th February 1917, the replacement troops arrived.\n\nPicture no.17\n\nThe following men who were Killed in Action on Sunday 4th February 1917 were buried in Kiboko Wood at the following map coordinates 62C.H.35.b.9.9.\n\nPrivate G.

Perkins (21093)\n\nPicture no.20\n\nIn his book ‘Some Desperate Glory’, author Vaughan states that;\n\n'He (Watkins) had been leading the company across the open road in front of Herbecourt, when a burst of enemy gunfire swept the road, The company scattered and lay in shell-holes while shells and shrapnel rained about them. Along the front line they saw a terrific barrage falling and faintly distinguished the rattle of machine guns. After a while the shelling suddenly ceased and they went forward with their rations, to find the trenches wrecked but now peaceful. The enemy – The 4th Prussian Guard – had attacked three times, penetrating our lines on the third attempt, chiefly on the sector held by the 6th Warwicks. We had had some casualties, but he did not know how many'.\n\n'This story seriously disturbed my rest: it brought danger so close to me. I lay awake for hours, thinking that I might have been in the line during that barrage and attack, or I might have been in Watkins’ place. Then how would I have acquitted myself? I saw horrible pictures of myself lying dead in a shattered trench, or helplessly bleeding to death in a shell-hole, with no power to call for help. And not less terrible I saw myself on the road, panic-stricken and unable to go forward with the rations. Devoutly I wished that the war would be over before our turn came to go into the line'.\n\nPicture no.21\n\nOn Monday 5th February 1917, The 1/6th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment was relieved by The 1/5th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment.

Moved at dusk up the old Herbecourt road, which is now much softer; the snow is mostly melted and slushy but the ground underneath is still frozen. I knew the way up to Battalion HQ, of course, but from there on was new to me. It was a long and winding trench, which rather bewildered me, for the scattered sentry posts seemed to face in all directions. After a short time, the guide warned me in a whisper that we must now go quietly as we were close to the line.Then the trench got narrower and shallower until it was only knee deep, and we ran into a broken wall of a house. The trench recommenced at the cornet of the building, and here was the entrance to the cellar used as the sergeant majors’ dugout. Here we dropped Sergeant Bell to take over his duties, and we carried on down another 30 years of deep narrow trench where I tore a great rent in my British warm. We hit the front –line trench at right angles, and almost opposite was another cellar into which Hatwell had disappeared in a moment'.\n\n'I hardly noticed the troops melting away into different directions, but suddenly found myself quite alone outside the cellar. For a quarter of an hour I sat up against the side of the trench, soaking in the atmosphere. It was quite dark and damp, around my feet the mud was six inches deep, and above me I could see only the faint outline of the parapet all jagged and broken with bricks and stumps and over it the dim silhouette of loose wire. Occasionally a huge rat would scamper past, or a couple of men would stagger by, swearing gently at their load of sandbags or stakes. All was deathly quiet except for the low voices in the dugout or the faint click of a bayonet against a steel hat'.\n\n'Soon, in twos and threes, men began to dribble back down the way we had come, and then a sturdy sergeant major lifted the blanket of the dugout and reported in a deep confident voice, ‘relief complete. Sir!’. He went steadily off, hoisting his rifle-sling higher on his shoulder and was lost in the darkness. A few minutes later I descended the cellar steps to find a couple of officers finishing their drinks and putting out their cigarettes before they too said goodbye to the line for awhile'.\n\nVaughan later describes his first experience of visiting the post:\n\n'The night was perfectly quiet, and we picked our squelchy way after Bell along the trench to the right. After ten or twelve yards we turned to the right, ducking under a trench board, and came to the first post. Here, with his head above the parapet, stood private Newey, perfectly motionless. He answered whispered questions without turning his head, and we stood beside him for a few moments peering into the darkness. Nothing could be seen or heard and we stepped down and talked to Corporal Bobby Wood who was in charge of the post. He showed us his shelter, a bare hole scooped out of the side of the trench; his six men were in a tiny shelter on one side'.\n\n'Leaving them to their watch we passed on to the Lewis gun post some dozen yards away. Here Corporal McKay, who was smoking his little pipe upside down, greeted us very cheerily and seemed quite happy. His gun was pushed forward down a little sap, along which we crept quietly to where the gunners were lying face downwards under a belt of wire, with their eyes glued on the faint outline of the ground in front. We could not talk so we returned to the trench'.\n\n'The remainder of the line was very irregular and the posts seemed to be firing in different directions. At the end of our sector on the left, a communication trench ran back to the rear, and a little way down was a nice big shelter in which Sergeant Allsop and one of two men of 14 platoon were sleeping. Close to our third post were two trees, one of which stripped and shattered by a shell, was still standing; the other was cut in half and hung down across the trench like an arch. Under this ran a shallow trench which was a shortcut back to our HQ. This trench we took, walking in the open for nearly 50 years, which I thought a highly dangerous proceeding'.\n\nThe following day on Wednesday 15th February 1917, whilst in brigade reserve, Lieutenant E. Spencer joined the battalion for duty.\n\nOn Thursday 15th February 1917, Vaughan talks about the grizzly task of burying the dead:\n\n'As I turned to re-enter the dugout, he said 'There's a job for you tonight,' and he pointed out a cluster of corpses three or four years behind the parados. Lying flat on their backs, with marble faces rigid and calm, their khaki lightly covered with frost, some with no wound visible, some with blood clotted on their clothes, one with a perfectly black face, they lay at attention staring up into the heavens. This was my first sight of death and I was surprised that it did not upset me. Only the one with the black face has stayed with me. The thick, slightly curled lips, fleshy aquiline nose, cap-comforter pulled well down over his head and the big glassy eyes have become stamped on my brain'.\n\n'When my tour of duty came round, I drew one or two men from the posts and went out to bury the bodies. It was very dark and we had to feel about finding them. When we tried to dig, we found the ground so hard that we could not get a pick into it. According to orders, also, we tried to take off their boots and equipment, but it was not very pleasant pulling frozen corpses about, so we decided that the country could afford to pay for that equipment, and we ended by covering them with old blankets, and piling the corners with stones, until the ground should be soft enough to bury them.\n\nA few weeks later on Sunday 11th March 1917, Edwin Campion Vaughan makes the following statement \"Whilst we were eating, the pioneer sergeant bought in some crosses that he had made for the men whom I had covered with blankets and whom were no buried and when I went to the front line Dunham carried them along'.\n\nOn Sunday 11th February 1917 – Monday 12th February 1917, Private V.O. Hoare (5401) was accidently killed with Private F.E. Davies (2736) being listed as having died (the war diary lists that one man died and another man was wounded) this man may possibly be Private W. Winnett who is listed as having died of his wounds.\n\nOn Thursday 16th February 1917, the following man died of his wounds and was buried at St Souplet British Cemetery; he is listed as having been taken as a prisoner of war.\n\nPrivate Frederick William Mander (241770).\n\nOn Friday 17th February 1917, another man was accidently wounded. On Saturday 18th February 1917, Private J.W. Loveridge (20921) died of his wounds and was buried at St Sever British Cemetery Rouen.\n\nMonday 20th February 1917, The 1/6th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment relieved The 1/5th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment for their third tour in the trenches at Biaches.

Dowsett joined the battalion for duty.\n\nOn Wednesday 22nd February 1917, the Battalion front was heavily bombarded between 7.40pm and 8.30pm during this bombardment Private David Francis Bermingham (242537) was Killed with one other man being wounded. Private Bermingham’s body was never recovered and he is remembered on The Thiepval Memorial to The Missing.

Shipway (241187) who was buried by his comrades at map coordinated 62c.I.31.d.2.8.\n\nOn Friday 24th February 1917, the battalion received 7 other rank reinforcements and had one other rank wounded. On Saturday 25th February 1917, rumours went around the trenches that “enemy was evacuating” however patrols were sent out and found that the Germans still occupied their posts. On Sunday 26th February 1917, after six days in the trenches the battalion was relieved by The 1/5th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment. A patrol was sent out to secure identification however this was not successful and resulted in 2nd Lieutenant Draper being seriously wounded. The Battalion moved into divisional reserve. On this day The 1/6th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment received news that the following men had been bestowed awards and honours in The New Year's Awards.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Danielsen was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.\n\nLieutenant J.

During February 1917 and March 1917, this road would have seen much activity with men and supplies moving up to the front line and wounded men being transported back down this road via motor ambulances. As you walk or drive down this road on the right you will see the village of Flaucourt which was a forward position for the collection of men and supplies."
