He has a WO363 service record online. He was a schoolteacher living at Woodman Road, Warley in 1915, was born 1889 at Leyton/West Ham, and was living at Woodman Road (not clear if it is the same house as later) in Warley in 1901 with his parents, Robert (G.E.R. platelayer) and Annie, and siblings Beatrice, Annie, Henry and Arthur. Sgt Bear was married on 2-8-1915 to Marie Stannard. He joined up on 7-1-1915 (presumably shortly after Herbert Earl), was one of the original contingent of the battalion to France on 17-11-1915 and served with the battalion until March 1918, and thereafter as a CSM with the 1/8th Middlesex. The service record offers a bit more detail on his DCM (he was wounded in the head) it doesn't mention any other men apart from \"being part of a covering party\"}\n\nThe 17th Bn. were in major action on 1st June 1916 (3 pages in the \"Die Hards\") at Souchez - specifically Broadbridge and Mildven craters. I don't have time to post the pages tonight, but might have chance tomorrow.\n\nTemp Captain Salter of \"B\" Company, and 2/Lt Engleburrt are mentioned in the narrative for their work.

Cook\n\nThis Cook link warns me not to proceed so is there a safe way to access the details because I feel this is the key to me finding more about my Grandfather's MM with his sergeant and the information so far fits with what we think we know. I think this is the closest I've been to finding out more about what happened so thanks to everyone. Well, as close I could be since speaking to my Grand-Dad when I was a kid...\n\nSteve.\n\nBy the way General re. your comments about Bertie's shoulder injury and shrapnel wound , comments on 12/10/2008, he only had the one right shoulder so I'm guessing that was the site of the injury!!\n\nThank you for posting the images. It looks like a nice thing to have, and to be able to pass on to future generations.\n\nThank you, and I have had a provisional response from the National Army Museum tht would be interested in the trenches one day, and they would be better preserved there in a display with Mr O'Hara's details as background, than if just left forever lying in my attic etc. I doubt that future boys will be interested in playing with them as I did using miniature soldiers and a lot of imagination. So even if no longer played with I will be happy that they are looked after there in perpetuity. . I might be able to take them in person one day rather than bequeathing them. An alternative might be RAF Hendon because Mr O'Hara was the onlyJapanese RAF pilot on the Western Front. I have notified his daughter in Holland of my plans and sent her photographs as well. She ought to know her father was remarkable!If she doesn't know already o course?\n\nRegards\n\nChris\n\nAlthough I will never know for certain, I have tried to piece together and summarise the various replies and information from the Whistle Blows/Middlesex's book and reached the following conclusion as the most probable events leading to my Granfd-dad's Military medal.When he was alive and I was just a boy, I never appreciated that he genuinely could be called a hero, saving lives! But, the likely events wereas follows, I now have to believe:\n\nThe conclusion is that a \"bombing contest\". occurred on the 1st June 1916 near Souchez A raiding and consolidating party that was fiercely resisted on the edges of a crater caused by a mine; . The two Lewis guns proved particularly effective at keeping the Germans at bay. but A series of bomb-fights ensued despite the use of Lewis machine-guns, bombs [i.e. grenades] were exchanged! as Bertie had said .We still have the the letter to Bertie from his comrades indicating that he was wounded when he was recommended for a medal. commenting that they feel as proud \"as his family no doubt does as well\".\n\nSERGEANT Cook led Bertie in a \"bombing contest\" to defend their position. and although we will never know for certain, the evidence available points towards this. as being the closest we have to an official-version of how and why Bertie and his sergeant received their medals. I confess that am unsure how the the portion of the replies and text referring to Lt. Engleburtt,. fits in with this.\n\nAs I signed off to Richard Gardiner/Paul; I am the proud Grandson of Herbert Arthur Earl F/218. and no doubt, my Dad his brother would call themselves the proud sons.My Dad started this rearch in the nineteen eighties, long before the wonders of this internet-thingy!\n\nWhat do you think of my conclusions please? If you state that I am obviously wrong on some facts, please let me know and I'll try not to be too disappointed!\n\nApologies if this is a duplicate, I've just posted but it doesn't appear to be here?I visited Lincoln castle yesterday to see the Poppy-wave transferred from London recently and it was well-attended. My wife pointed out the date: 1st June and we realided it was 100 years to the day sinc my Grand-Dad Bertie was awarded his Military medal. We couldn't have planned it beter. All of a sudden the cold wind there blew a lot of dust and grit into my eyes as I realised the significance of the date. RIP Bertie."
