        "text": "This article describes the current structure of the Australian Army. It includes the army's order of battle and the headquarters locations of major units. Members of the Australian Army also serve within joint units of the Australian Defence Force which fall outside the direct command of the Australian Army.\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Australian Army is organised into three main elements which report to the Chief of Army, the Headquarters of the 1st Division, Special Operations Command and Forces Command.[1] Headquarters 1st Division is responsible for high-level training activities and is capable of being deployed to command large scale ground operations. It does not have any combat units permanently assigned to it, though it commands units during training activities and the Land Combat Readiness Centre reports to the divisional headquarters.[2][3]\n\nMost of the Army's units report to Forces Command, which is responsible for overseeing their readiness and preparing them for operations. This organisation came into effect during January 2011. Before this time the Army's three regular brigades were permanently assigned to the Headquarters 1st Division.[4][3]\n\nOrganisation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following order of battle describes the Army's organisational structure at the battalion and independent company/squadron level at the end of April 2023. It does not take into account changes to units' structure and command arrangements associated with operational deployments.\n\nChief of Army\n\n[edit]\n\nChief of Army[5]\n\nForces Command[5]\n\n1st
