        "text": "Let’s Talk About It\n\nThe last few weeks have been incredibly hard to watch. After nearly two decades in Afghanistan, the war has ended. But it did not end with an unconditional surrender and a ticker tape parade, did it? Instead, on live TV, we watched the Taliban rapidly regain control of Afghanistan, ending with a crisis at the Kabul airport as people attempted to flee.\n\nSo here we are, two decades later. We are a generation of wartime leaders, who, for a brief moment, have no war to fight. Before we move on, as leaders often do, let’s take a few minutes to talk through what happened, to make an honest attempt to learn through it. By writing this, I offer three simple questions. If you can, take some time today to reflect, think, and discuss.\n\nHow are you doing? For many, the end of this war has forced us to address unhealed wounds. We knew the war wouldn’t go on forever when we left in ‘05 or ‘11, but we knew we were contributing to a larger campaign. The war became a constant, something we could point back to and justify the collective sacrifice. Now that the war is over, many are wrestling with the conclusion and wanting to quantify that sacrifice while seeing images of the Taliban inspecting American military equipment.\n\nWhat did we get right? While we’re working through all of that, it is important to remember what we got right. First, I couldn’t be more proud of how a rapidly formed joint force, including the Devil Brigade, handled a humanitarian crisis at the airport in Kabul. Now, as refugees begin to hit the States, we have ad-hoc teams coming together to welcome them. These efforts should make us all proud. This is the true American spirit, the very ideal we chose to fight for.\n\nAlso, many of us “got it right” when we fought in Afghanistan. During my time as a Company Commander in Paktikia Province, we protected the people in our area of operations. We provided them some semblance of stability, giving our enemies no rest as we hunted them through the valleys and into the mountains. Collectively, we gave the Afghan people a taste of freedom, their children watching and learning from our example. We gave their little girls hope. Only history can truly judge the impact of our efforts in Afghanistan.\n\nHow can we learn? As we get past the raw emotion of what’s occurred, let’s start talking about what we learned in Afghanistan. At the tactical level, share your experiences and challenges as a leader in combat. For other leaders, it is imperative to discuss our experiences on higher level staffs. These are tough conversations, especially when we discuss our own shortcomings, but they are essential to enabling learning.\n\nThis is a tough time, but what do leaders do in the face of adversity? We step up to the challenge and lead. That’s what I am asking each of you to do today. Be a leader and start a dialogue with your network. Together, we can shape how our institution learns and grows.\n\nWriting with Precision: How to Write so That You Cannot Possibly Be Misunderstood\n\nBook Review\n\nWriting with Precision is a practical manual that teaches clarity. The book offers many specific ‘ways’ to be clear; so many in fact, one must practice them to understand. Fortunately for us, Writing with Precision includes a handful of practical exercises.\n\nThe author Jefferson Bates is a former NASA writer of some renown and published the first edition in 1978. In the book, he lays out what he learned over four decades as a professional writer who focused on clarity in government documents. His cover letters, memos, instructions, regulations, and reports were the acme of precision, and he was a key player in de-mystifying government writing…and I thought it was bad now. Some may think this is too pedantic a topic but it gives those of us in government service something to ponder. Specifically, what has the culture of the military taught us about writing that isn’t helpful? Bates sees eliminating jargon, vogue words, and gobbledygook as a start.\n\nBates breaks Writing with Precision into several parts which cover a variety of topics. Part 1 focuses on writing with 10 principles and 7 axioms. Part 2 covers editing skills while Part 3 is a handbook organized in alphabetical order that further explains and complements his principles and axioms. Finally, Part 4 is a series of practical exercises with answers and comments. Throughout all four parts, Bates adds checklists and exercises to drive home his points.\n\nOverall, a worthy read for those on a quest to write better. My two biggest takeaways were a new method for building an outline using index cards and the reasons you SHOULD use passive voice. This will go on my reference shelf. It is a great tool to come back to as you edit your own (or someone else’s) work.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Christopher L’Heureux is an Armor Officer who tries to write, likes to think, and routinely sips whisk(e)y.\n\nThe Infinite Game by Simon Sinek\n\nBook Review\n\nThe latest installment of the Simon Sinek enterprise, The Infinite Game, has a lot of what I found compelling from Sinek’s past works. It explains a big idea in simple terms but this one didn’t seem to deliver. I found the read clunky and disorganized. I am a huge Sinek fan which is probably why I was so distressed. While he presents some valuable ideas in this book, I did not find the depth I was expecting.\n\nThat said, the overall premise of The Infinite Game is sound. Sinek starts with the idea that humans view the world in win-lose terms. Stated another way, we believe our games are finite. We know the players, play by agreed-upon rules, have commonly understood goals, and somebody always wins and losses at the end. We yearn for this consistency and often get frustrated with interactions fraught with disorganization and surprise. The win-lose dichotomy clouds our perception of the world, and we view our interactions through this prism.\n\nInfinite games, however, are not the exception; they are common, and viewing the world under this paradigm is more useful than we realize. Known and unknown players play these games, without exact or agreed-upon rules, and they have no practical end. The primary objective of the infinite game is to continue to play. You can win at chess but how do you win in a friendship? Drug dealers aren’t trying to beat police to win; they just want to continue their business. This long-view method of perceiving the world changes incentive structures, understanding risk, and how we manage our resources.\n\nTo play the infinite game, you must start by adopting an infinite mindset. Sinek’s prescription is to advance a just cause, build a trusting team, study rivals, show existential flexibility, and lead. A just cause is the feeling of being part of something bigger than yourself supplying a purpose so appealing people will sacrifice for it. Trust is aligned with psychological safety to embolden risk-taking. A worthy rival is a healthy competitor giving your organization a focus. Existential flexibility is the ability to change a process or path to align better with your cause. Finally, leading with an infinite mindset is focusing on a long-term view and taking care of the team.\n\nThe key point I took from this book was the need to focus on the long-term vision over a short-term goal-oriented approach. The short-term mindset incentivizes near-term wins without regard to long-term effects. This is akin to an Army unit focusing on individual weapons qualification statistics over the amorphous vision of being lethal when engaged with the enemy. Weapons’ qualification percentages are easily measurable and comparable; they’re also eminently necessary to winning a battle. Succeeding in battle, however, requires many more skills that are much harder to define than just shooting straight. Theoretically, an organization could be successful in battle with poor weapons qualification skills. At least one deep thinker wrote the acme of skill was winning without firing a shot. Thus, too much focus on short-term measures can lead to some great shooters at the expense of honing other necessary skills not easily measured.\n\nIn the end, Sinek’s big idea is worthy of reflection, but I recommend watching his talk on the web before picking up this one.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Christopher L’Heureux is an Armor Officer who likes to write, think, and sip whisk(e)y.\n\nMeet The Staff: Intelligence (S2)\n\nA Guest Post by CPT Justin Beverly, CPT Michael Zequeira, and MAJ George Fust\n\nWelcome to the Battalion! As an incoming field grade officer, we know you are busy so we will get straight to the point. The following article will be an introduction to the Battalion intelligence section. We want to enable your efforts by helping you understand the section. The intelligence warfighting function is critical for organizational success both in garrison and deployed. We hope you leverage this initiative to gain an understanding of the intelligence section’s capabilities and limitations as you shape your vision for the staff. The S2 is more than a glorified weatherperson. Leverage the ideas below to minimize friction while maximizing unit readiness.\n\nMeet The Staff: The Master Gunner\n\nA Guest Post by SFC Zack Eckert\n\nEditor’s note: As the world watches the best of professional golf in The Master’s this weekend, it is not ironic that we have the opportunity to run this piece. For the Army, the Master Gunner is the foremost professional on how to make our organizations lethal. Their expertise, knowledge, and drive are the same as the individual who will wear the “Green Jacket” on Sunday. If you want to win when you arrive on the next battlefield, find the NCO wearing the “Master Gunner Identification Badge” on your staff, it is imperative to make them a centerpiece of your staff and all training to ensure we do.\n\nOf all the NCOs in the Operations Cell (S3), none is more valuable than a Master Gunner (MG). On any particular morning, you’re most likely to encounter the “Mike Golf” whittling away at one of several projects that seem to require attention. During the humdrum of the morning routine, the MG has to answer emails, re-route correspondence, and oversee both the land manager and the ammunition manager. On a typical day, this takes the first hour to complete before they are free to travel, moving down to the Company’s to catch up on maintenance and crew training. Moving rapidly from place to place, the MG can be difficult to pinpoint unless they are tethered to a computer somewhere, working diligently to generate a product that is as close to complete for the next big brief.\n\nMeet The Staff: The Assistant Operations Officer and Planner\n\nA Guest Post by LTC Chad Pillai\n\nCommander of 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division in 2015 at the National Training Center (NTC) going through Orders Development Process with Staff. Photo provided by Captain Sean Williams\n\nIn June 2004, I signed in to the Headquarters (HQ) of the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division (Ready First) at Ray Barracks, Friedberg, Germany. I signed in to the unit rear detachment since the Brigade was completing an extended tour in Iraq after the Shia uprising in Sadr City and Najaf. I briefly served as the rear detachment S-1 and later the rear detachment Executive Officer. When the Brigade redeployed, I transitioned into my official first staff assignment – the Brigade S-3 (Operations) section. Within the S-3, I served as the Assistant S-3 for Plans responsible for planning and writing the Brigade’s Operations Orders (OPORDs).\n\nMeet The Staff: The Operations Sergeant Major\n\nA Guest Post by SGM Tyler Benge\n\nIn the last few years, I have heard numerous discussions on what an Operations Sergeant Major (OPS SGM) actually does at the battalion level. Doctrine provides some guidance but truthfully, it is minimal, which could be good or bad depending on the organization, the leaders in the organization, and the OPS SGM. The purpose of writing this article is to offer my thoughts and lessons learned throughout my ten months in the position for two different organizations. It is my hope that it could help a future Sergeants Major along with his or her field grade counterpart and the Battalion Commander in the garrison environment.\n\nMeet The Staff: “The Majors”\n\nA Guest Post by LTC Aaron Childers\n\n“In the beginning, there were majors.”\n\nThe first standardized brigade in the continental Army had one major. As the staff expanded, the Army increased the number of officers in a brigade and battalion. For a company-grade officer who has never been on a battalion staff, the majors may seem unapproachable, but they have always been essential to a unit’s operation. Their experience, relationships, and leadership help the unit function. Whether you are a Company Commander or a member of the staff, it is important to know who the majors are, what their jobs entail, what roles they play, and how you can build a relationship with them.\n\nWelcome to Meet The Staff! – 21 Principles of Good Staff Work\n\nGuest Post by MAJ Doug Meyer of The Company Leader\n\nStaff work isn’t always glamorous. But the reality is that you will spend most of your career in a staff role. Even the highest-ranking officers in our military are not commanders per se, but chiefs (and one chairmen) of staff. The requirement is crucial; do the hard and scientific work of war where your output will directly impact the soldiers and leaders charged to enthusiastically carry out your orders. Glamorous or not, if you want to be a great officer then you must be a great staff officer.\n\nPredictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions by Dan Ariely\n\nA Guest Post by Chris L'Heureux\n\nWe acknowledge that emotion can cloud human decision-making and affect action. We also know our mind creates shortcuts that are sometimes faulty. Despite this understanding, we often do not account for it. We think of ourselves as rational decision-makers, doing whatever offers the most utility based on the information available. This is not true.\n\nWe are Predictably Irrational as Dan Ariely describes in this book, a fast and entertaining read. Ariely lays out several common traps found in human thinking with the hope that being aware of the traps helps us dodge the effects.\n\nLet’s review a few of Ariely’s more common snares: anchoring, the decoy effect, the endowment effect & loss aversion, and short-term thinking.\n\nA Letter to My CGSOC Peers\n\nA Guest Post by MAJ George Fust\n\n“You go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time.”\n\n-Donald Rumsfeld, 21st Secretary of Defense\n\nTo my fellow Command and General Staff Officer Course (CGSOC) peers, this course is an opportunity to understand our current Army and we can help shape it for the future fight. This is our Army. This is our moment to be stewards of the profession that we have invested a decade or more in. The Army most of us plan to be a part of for the next decade. Our life choices have led us here. Now is the time to stay switched on. While completing CGSOC, I propose three broad areas to focus on and think about. These include organizational leadership skills, stewardship of the profession, and personal goals. The Army gifted us an entire year for personal development and to contribute to our organization. If not us, then who? If not now, then when?\n\nPart 8: Got Shock? How to Train your Brigade for Lethality and Winning in Large Scale Combat Operations\n\nA Guest Post By COL Michael Schoenfeldt (@IRONHORSE6_) and MAJ Patrick Stallings (@DustyStetson9)\n\nThis is Part 8 of an 8 Part Series. The full and unredacted article with all enclosures is available on Milsuite at https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/abct-training\n\nBrigade FTX\n\nAfter completing platoon LFX, battalion STX, and CALFEX, the BCT should identify any outstanding requirements to prepare for their brigade FTX as their final collective training opportunity before deployment to the National Training Center. Individual qualification ranges or secondary crew gunnery may be necessary before or immediately following the brigade FTX, but the brigade will also need a significant amount of time for recovery, unscheduled maintenance, and services after the crucible of training they just completed. The overall planning of a brigade FTX is the responsibility of the division, but the BCT has significant responsibilities in proposing and refining training objectives, integrating external enablers, and meeting preliminary requirements. The division will serve as the HICOM and EXCON for both the brigade and the OPFOR, has responsibility for sourcing and training OCs, and is responsible for spectrum management, approving training objectives, requesting training areas and resources, and the budget. The brigade must assist in the development of the simulations and communications architecture and must request Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) and Home station Instrumentation Training System (HITS) for all personnel and equipment, so direct and indirect fire systems register effects during the training.\n\nPart 7: Got Shock?

The full and unredacted article with all enclosures is available on Milsuite at https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/abct-training\n\nCompany STX and CALFEX\n\nUpon completion of the gap crossing and battalion STX, one company from the battalion proceeds immediately to the CALFEX while the other companies proceed to STX. The battalion establishes its CTCP, MCP, FTCP, and Main CP in their TAA. The FLE or BSA remains established throughout the execution of CALFEX to support units as they train. The battalion retains control of its companies executing company STX. The battalion has responsibility for planning, resourcing, and executing the company STX. The battalion should adopt a similar model as they did for platoon STX, including training on company mounted and dismounted maneuver, changing movement techniques, changing movement formations, movement to contact, attack, hasty defense, breaching, and battle handoff. Cavalry troops should train zone reconnaissance, screen, and reconnaissance handoff.\n\nPart 6: Got Shock?

After a few days, the battalion prepares to deploy to the Combined Arms Live Fire Exercise (CALFEX). This brief recovery period allows all battalions to refit personnel, clean equipment, and conduct unscheduled maintenance. The battalion motor pool serves as the Division Support Activity (DSA), and the battalion receives an OPORD tasking them to deploy to a Tactical Assembly Area (TAA) to defend Atropia from invading Donovian forces. This deployment operation serves as a battalion STX lane, providing the battalion an opportunity to exercise tactical control of multiple companies, assign tasks and purposes to different C2 nodes, and integrate attachments. This battalion STX also prepares the battalion to conduct Reception, Staging, Onward movement, and Integration (RSOI) in a theater of war.\n\nPart 5: Got Shock?

The full and unredacted article and all enclosures are available on Milsuite at https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/abct-training\n\nPlatoon Training, Battalion STX, and CALFEX: Maximizing Combined Arms Lethality\n\nThe decisive point of the ABCT’s training progression is building lethal companies and platoons which occurs during platoon LFXs and the CALFEX. Much like crew gunnery, these training events involve the integration of all C2 and sustainment nodes. These events require the participation of the entire brigade and battalion staff to synchronize all WfF and forge the brigade into a combat-ready team. Without putting all WfFs together, the brigade cannot function effectively. The purpose of combined arms training is training the synchronized and simultaneous application of arms to achieve an effect greater than if each arm was used separately or sequentially. Combined arms enables the ABCT to overwhelm and destroy enemies on the battlefield. To compress the time required for training and prevent the need to conduct ten days of deliberate recovery after training each echelon, the ABCT should structure training so that the ABCT conducts platoon through battalion training in one continuous block through multi-echelon design.\n\nPart 4: Got Shock? How to Train your Brigade for Lethality and Winning in Large Scale Combat Operations\n\nA Guest Post By COL Michael Schoenfeldt (@IRONHORSE6_) and MAJ Patrick Stallings (@DustyStetson9\n\nThis is Part 4 of an 8 Part Series. The full and unredacted article with all enclosures is available on Milsuite at https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/abct-training\n\nLethality Validation Exercises\n\nExercising CPs and staffs requires a deliberate training approach. Trained staffs enable lethal crews, platoons, and companies to win. The BCT fight requires shaping the enemy in the deep fight and destroying the enemy in close combat with an overwhelming shock through violent, synchronized, combined arms maneuver. Achieving these outcomes requires effective staff at the battalion and brigade. Training staffs and CPs requires regular employment and exercise at echelon. Without regular exercise, CPs will fail to integrate resources or synchronize the fight. For this reason, ABCTs should conduct Lethality Validation Exercises (LVEs) every month where they do not deploy CPs as part of another collective training event. LVEs validate the setup standards, layout, and infrastructure of CPs as a TENTEX, validate communications systems configurations during a COMMEX, train plans sections by conducting tactical MDMP and rehearsing distribution of an Operations Order (OPORD) including all fighting products, and validate that fighting products enable current operations functions during a Command Post Exercise (CPX).\n\nPart 3: Got Shock?

The full and unredacted article with all enclosures is available on Milsuite at https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/abct-training\n\nCrew Gunnery: Setting the Foundation for Lethality\n\nThe brigade must establish and enforce the ABCT’s gunline. An ABCT consumes tremendous resources on an installation, and crew gunnery is an opportunity to train multiple echelons. The brigade is the headquarters that synchronizes and resources the gunnery and assists battalions in maximizing the multi-echelon training opportunities. While crew gunnery is a brigade training event, individual companies run each range and battalions support the training. The brigade master gunner should draft the gunline, develop the shot sheets, and coordinate for Vehicle Crew Evaluators (VCEs) to evaluate crews outside each battalion during crew Gunnery Table VI (GT VI). The division headquarters must shift red cycle and installation support requirements away from the brigade executing crew gunnery months for it to be a successful training event. Because an ABCT requires so many ranges over a block of time, smaller units on the installation must make the space for the ABCT to train.\n\nPart 2: Got Shock? How to Train your Brigade for Lethality and Winning in Large Scale Combat Operations\n\nA Guest Post By COL Michael Schoenfeldt (@IRONHORSE6_) and MAJ Patrick Stallings (@DustyStetson95)\n\nThis is Part 2 of an 8 Part Series. The full and unredacted article with all enclosures is available on Milsuite at https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/abct-training\n\nOperationalized Multi-Echelon Training\n\nTime is a finite resource and units cannot simply add requirements to training calendars that are already overloaded. Increasing lethality and the ability of ABCTs to synchronize all WfFs requires multi-echelon training with clearly defined objectives and outcomes. During a properly designed company live-fire certification, an infantry company—the primary training audience— will train on all of its assigned METs. Additionally, that training event provides an opportunity for the parent battalion to establish its own Main Command Post (CP), Tactical Command Post (TAC), Combat Trains Command Post (CTCP), and Field Trains Command Post (FTCP) while validating current operations functions at each node. The company has an opportunity to deploy its CP and company trains. By evaluating the infantry company on its performance while receiving a Logistics Package (LOGPAC) at a Logistics Release Point (LRP) during a service station resupply, the distribution platoon and Forward Support Company (FSC) for the battalion can demonstrate proper tactics and validate their SOPs. The brigade trains the Brigade Aviation Element (BAE) and Fire Support Element (FSE) on managing airspace and de-conflicting fires by incorporating lift aviation, attack aviation, artillery, mortars, Shadow Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), and Raven UAS into the company live fire. Sappers from the Brigade Engineer Battalion (BEB) participate and integrate into the company by conducting a combined arms breach. By executing all of these events at the same time, the ABCT builds readiness and lethality across multiple echelons in one training event.\n\nPart 1: Got Shock? How to Train your Brigade for Lethality and Winning in Large Scale Combat Operations\n\nA Guest Post by COL Michael Schoenfeldt (@IRONHORSE6_) and MAJ Patrick Stallings (@DustyStetson95)\n\nThis is Part 1 of an 8 Part Series. The full and unredacted paper with all enclosures is available on Milsuite at https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/abct-training\n\nPreface\n\nCavalry – The cavalry soldier must consider his horse as a part of himself, and the perfect management of the horse cannot be learned either in schools or in a few weeks of practice. If daily exercises are dispensed with, both horse and man return to their natural state, and such mounted men cease to be efficient… Cavalry is indispensable in time of war. It will always take a leading part in pursuing a retreating enemy; it is the proper arm of ordinary reconnaissances; it will always serve as eclaireurs, and as escorts, and should, in the present state of war, carry carbines and be prepared for service on foot. It is weakened and destroyed in a country without forage. Its first cost, its constant maintenance, the defects of its employment, and the system of providing horses make it expensive; but it ought nevertheless to be maintained in a complete state, for its art can only be exercised by men and horses that are properly instructed.\n\nCavalry Tactics – The individual instruction of men and horses should be regarded as the most important point of the whole system, and should be as simple as possible; the man should be taught to manage his horse with ease and address over all kinds of ground and at all gaits, to swim rivers, to go through certain gymnastic exercise – such as vaulting, cutting heads, to fence, to fire very frequently at a mark, and to handle his weapon with accuracy and effect at all gaits, and in all situations… Insist upon the sabre being kept sharp in the field, provide the men the means of doing so, and lay it down that the strength of the cavalry is in the “spurs and sabre.”\n\nFrom Military Dictionary: Comprising Technical Definitions; Information on Raising and Keeping Troops; Actual Service; and Law, Government Regulation, and Administration Relating to Land Forces,\n\nby Colonel H.L. Scott, USA, 1861.\n\nCALLING ALL WRITERS: Meet The Staff Initiative\n\nAn FGL Initiative\n\nThe “Meet the Staff” initiative is an opportunity for staff officers to explain who you are and what you do to all the Field Grade Officers that never had the chance to learn why they need you.\n\nOrganizational Goals for NTC – From a Former Battalion XO\n\nA Guest Post by MAJ Kevin Krupski\n\nI forget what time it was, but it was dark, and we had finally gotten the semblance of a TOC established “in the box” after a long day leaving the RUBA. I was trying to account for the trail of equipment scattered along the route when the wind picked up – somehow the Ops Group was able to conjure up a dust storm just in time for our push through the “whale’s gap.” I could not help thinking to myself that this was just the beginning.\n\nTips for Navigating the AIM Marketplace\n\nA Guest Post by LTC Trey Guy\n\nThe relationships between field grade leaders at the battalion level can make or break the ability of a unit to perform in combat. Those who are preparing to take command at the battalion and brigade level owe it to their soldiers to ensure the best possible command climate. With the opening of the AIM Marketplace for the 21-02 movers just a few days ago I thought it might be useful to share my experience. First off, I am not a branch manager nor have I ever worked at HRC and I do not have the information or experience that those professionals have. I am, however, a CSL select Air Defense Officer, slated to take command in the summer of FY21 (21-02 YMAV cycle). Over the last few weeks, the current battalion commander of the unit I will command was gracious enough to allow me to have a large amount of input into who the unit preferences in the AIM Marketplace.\n\nACFT Prep 3.0/4.0\n\nA Guest Post by Ed Arnston\n\nNow that the ACFT is our official fitness assessment of record, I’ve written – and tested – two additional programs that will help you and your Soldiers prepare for the test.\n\nAs I have continually reminded my Soldiers – performing well on the ACFT is important, but the training we conduct to prepare for the ACFT is more important. Soldiers are consistently training lower body strength, core, and work capacity much more often since the ACFT has been introduced. This is excellent and will lead to stronger, more fit Soldiers on the battlefield.\n\nTraining the Platoon Fundamentals: Lessons Learned from a Combined Arms Battalion Training Exercise\n\nA Guest Post by Ethan Olberding, Ryan Feeney, Jonathan Punio, and Graham Foresman\n\nHow do you define platoon “fundamentals?” Some would answer that with shoot, move, communicate, sustain, etc. One could not argue with those points, but we must specifically define fundamentals so that our platoon leaders can focus precious time and understand expectations. Sometimes fundamentals are the product of a simple face-to-face discussion between Commanders and their subordinates, which starts with “I expect that you can perform the following….” Once defined, we have to ask, how do you train the fundamentals?\n\nThe Boss Hates Me!\n\nA Guest Post by Major Vernon Pittman\n\n“The teacher hates me.” You have either said it yourself, heard it in school, or now have kids who are trying to convince you of this. Or perhaps the statement has taken on a new spin in your professional career: “the boss hates me.” What are you supposed to do in those situations? At this point in your career, the pressure to do well and set yourself apart is immense. You can see the finish line (retirement), and you want to make it there. But those goals may seem unreachable if the people responsible for your development and evaluations appear to dislike you or your work for some unapparent reason. In the military, we are often told that promotions, and good report cards, come down to luck and timing. If you find yourself in this situation, you are probably out of luck and your timing didn’t work out. If you think that you can’t get ahead no matter how hard you try allow me to offer some suggestions.\n\nThe Trooper\n\nA Guest Post by LTC Rich Groen\n\nWhile attending the Pre-Command Course (PCC) at Fort Leavenworth, I pondered ideas of grandeur. I was about to take the reins of one of the most storied Cavalry Squadrons in the United States Army. In true pompous fashion, I wrote out my vision or keys to success:\n\nBe a positively intrusive leader that inserts yourself at the point of friction.\n\nOperationalize everything to ensure synchronization.\n\nWin!\n\nIt seemed simple enough, but I was quick to learn that to be a successful leader I needed to do more than just publish words. Humility and teamwork are the keys to successful command. Reflecting over the past 16 months, I’ve learned that I cannot do it all and that you cannot achieve your vision without partnerships that exist within and outside of your organization.\n\nField Grade Survival Guide: Leadership\n\nA Guest Post by Major Joe Owens\n\nEditor’s Note: In July FGL released a new logo (pictured above). The Army uses graphic control measures to control maneuver and build a common operational picture on a map. The arrows that point units towards their objective identify who is the “decisive operation” (DO) or the unit that will achieve the end state. If you look at the logo the “L” in leadership is identified as the DO in what we do and what we want to help develop with our followers. As the author identifies below, leadership is the priority. Not powerpoints. Not emails. Not to cite doctrine from CGSC or SAMS. Not tell everyone how much harder you had it. It’s simple, invest in your people and give them the leadership they deserve.\n\nBe a leader, always! I’ve discussed management quite a bit throughout the course of this article and without doubt systems management is absolutely your job as a Field Grade Officer. However, individual leadership is just as important now as it was when you were a Company Commander. Be the boss you’ve always wanted to work for. Be yourself but strive to be the best version of yourself and incorporate the best parts of your previous bosses. Like all leadership positions, achieve consensus. Ensure the Company Commanders and Battalion Staff have a voice in how you do business as a team and how you conduct operations as a Battalion. First, they will work harder for something they have a vested interest in seeing succeed and second you must banish the staff mantra of ‘row well and live’. That is the mantra of slaves rowing on Roman warships, not of barrel-chested freedom fighters. It is the opposite of what we stand for as Army leaders and I despise that it has become a part of our lexicon.\n\nField Grade Survival Guide: Tips for Operations and Executive Officers\n\nA Guest Post by Major Joe Owens\n\nOperations Officer (S3)\n\nMany Officers will step into an operations officer job right out of the Command and General Staff College without having the luxury of spending a year on a Division staff to learn the cultural norms of their new organization so it’s extremely important to have a game plan when you step into the seat. The following is my best advice to a brand new S3. I’m not looking to insult anyone’s intelligence, but I’ve found over the past 15 years that there is a wide variety in how Battalion Operations sections function, ranging from highly effective to nearly dysfunctional. Below outlines ‘a way’ (not ‘the way’) to function as an S3. I believe it will produce a highly effective and efficient battalion.\n\nField Grade Survival Guide: Relationships\n\nA Guest Post by Major Joe Owens\n\nAs a Field Grade Officer within a Brigade Combat Team, everyone knows who you are. There is no more anonymity. I cannot stress enough how important the relationships and reputation you build are. It’s no longer good enough to simply keep your rater happy with your performance. Sure, your rater still has the biggest say in your career trajectory and you should ensure that you aggressively execute his priorities in a manner that they are comfortable with; however, that is no longer enough. For the sake of getting the job done, as well as developing a positive reputation across your Brigade, I highly recommend you cultivate relationships in a 360-degree fashion. This must be genuine as your teammates will see right through a “spotlight ranger”. Be the best teammate you can be and strive to help your peers, subordinates, and superiors alike. It’s about being a good teammate.\n\nField Grade Survival Guide: Manage Yourself First\n\nA Guest Post by Major Joe Owens\n\nIf you can’t manage yourself, then you can’t manage your Battalion staff systems. If you can’t lead yourself, then you can’t lead your subordinate Officer and Non-Commissioned Officers. The two top ways a Major will fail as an S3 or XO is by failing to delegate and failing to manage time. You can get away with doing it all yourself as a Company Commander (though it won’t be fun); you absolutely cannot do it all yourself as an S3 or XO. While these seem simple at first glance, you’ll find they take an exceptional amount of discipline to put into practice.\n\nA Field Grade Survival Guide\n\nA Guest Post by Major Joe Owens\n\nIntroduction\n\nAfter completing three years of key and developmental assignments as a Major, I’ve taken some time to reflect and evaluate bothmy shortcomings and successes. A couple of things came to mind immediately; first, there are a bunch of lessons learned and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), that have been learned the hard way by others. The second, I remember going into my first key developmental job as a Battalion Executive Officer and wishing there was more out there in terms of ‘how to’ from people who had held the position before. I wasn’t looking for doctrinal checklist of things I was responsible for; I was looking for some useful advice. Things like – what’s the best way to synchronize a Battalion? Best practice for task management? How do I keep myself armed with relevant information? I found a few articles.\n\nI reached out to mentors for TTPs. I was blessed that the BDE XO in the organization I was joining, was an old friend who allowed me to bombard him with questions every day. Now, as I sit and AAR my KD time, I’d like to pass along my lessons learned so they don’t have to do it the hard way.\n\nIn this article I’ll discuss the art of managing yourself, key relationships that should be cultivated, some specific advice for S3s and XOs, leadership as a Field Grade Officer and pass on some specific TTPs that worked for me. All my thoughts are ‘a way’, not ‘the way’ and the goal of this article is to help Officers conceptualize and frame their strategies for filling these positions. Do not mistake anything in this article as me touting my superior knowledge and practice of organizational leadership. Many of the things chosen to highlight are the result of failing and eventually coming to conclusions at a point that was too late for me and my organization to benefit. Being a Major is a lot of work and if you do not stay organized and disciplined it can easily become overwhelming; however, once you get the hang of it, it’s a lot of fun and extremely rewarding.\n\nMajor Hog Molly\n\nMeet Your New S3\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have been absolutely infatuated with playing football. I tended towards the larger end of the weight spectrum as a youth, thus I was one of the chosen few whom the coach put on the offensive line. My life as a “Hog Molly” had begun, and I never looked back. Like most young kids, I dreamt of playing professional sports. Well, I got recruited during high school and chose to play football at Army. As luck would have it, I had a solid career at Army and signed a contract with the Green Bay Packers. My pro career was short-lived. So short-lived in fact, that the previous sentence is longer than my time with the Packers. But, I’m a born and bred Wisconsinite. I played on the same field as Brett Favre and got to snap the ball to Aaron Rodgers. Being a Packer was a literal dream come true. I achieved a lifelong goal, learned a lot about football, and even more about life.\n\nField Grade Love Languages\n\nUtilizing the Long Range Calendar\n\nDuring the 2018 graduation week series, I offered that “elite field grade officers know how to plot and manage a Long-Range Calendar (LRC) with high fidelity, even when the entire enterprise above them conspires against them.” This article describes in detail the seven rules of thumb for successful LRC management that I outlined in 2018.\n\nBeneath the Surface: How Jewish Wisdom Can Inspire Army Leaders & Culture\n\nThe future of Army leadership and the soul of our culture will not be rooted in technology. As General Omar Bradley said, “Man is stumbling blindly through a spiritual darkness while toying with the precarious secrets of life and death. The world has achieved brilliance without wisdom, power without conscience. Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war than we know about peace, more about killing than we know about living.”\n\nThe Bottom 10%: Why the Military Can No Longer Afford Underperformers\n\nWe have all heard the ubiquitous saying that causes most of us to slap our foreheads in a mixture of shame, dread, and loathed acceptance: “I spend 90% of my time on the bottom 10% of my people.” Our admitted dilemma centers on the sense that there is a population that requires so much direction and maintenance that their presence is detrimental to the whole. With this acceptance is the underlying assumption that that top 90% can make up for the performance of the bottom 10%. In the current military paradigm, this assumption is not only not pragmatic, but it is also dangerous.\n\nReflections on the Command General Staff College\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide an examination and evaluation of the Command and General Staff College (CGSC) 2020 academic year. Three officers, from three different sections, evaluated virtually all aspects of the academic year. We chose to use three perspectives to provide a more expansive insight into a year at CGSC. Often one person’s perspective can be dismissed as anecdotal and this was our attempt to offer legitimacy to the evaluation. This evaluation includes our assessment of the day-to-day classroom instruction, administrative elements of CGSC, and garrison activities of Fort Leavenworth. Our examination does not include an evaluation of all aspects of CGSC. For example, none of us participated in the Masters of Military Arts and Sciences (MMAS) degree program, and all three of us lived on Fort Leavenworth. Each section will show the average grade based on all three of our evaluations and then provide our assessments and comments. For our evaluation, we based the format on that of MAJ Jamie Schwandt, USAR, used for an article he wrote for the Task and Purpose in 2018.\n\nBuilding Bridges Before the Fight: Foreign Exchange Broadening Programs\n\nThe United States military has been the leader in major combat operations around the world for the last 19 years. Given this framework, many US military personnel have a limited view of how our global partnerships work. For 19 years the average soldier has known nothing but an American General Officer leading the fight. As we move further into the 21st century, it is imperative that the United States military is comfortable serving with, and in some cases be subordinate to an allied military commander. These exchanges are governed by Army Regulation 614-10, Army Military Personnel Exchange Program with Military Services of Other Nations. These assignments are completed during broadening times in an individual career path and encompass four main objectives for the United States Army.\n\nFive Lessons from A Leadership Failure\n\nAs a young military prosecutor at Camp Lejeune in 2007, I was responsible for prosecuting some of the worst felony crimes from commands across one of the busiest military bases in the DOD. The cases included a steady stream of violent crimes, property crimes (like theft or vandalism), and various military offenses. My boss entrusted me with a big caseload, but I was confident in my ability to handle it.\n\nGenuine Leadership\n\nI am expanding on the recent topic of building trust by being approachable. In his article, the author stated, “Be open and readable … What you see is what you get. No false pretenses or pretending to be something you’re not.” I submit that two key components of approachability are self-awareness and sincerity. Being self-aware and sincere helps leaders humanize themselves and become more relatable to the rest of their team. While some professional distance between leaders and subordinates is required for good order and discipline, most approachable leaders will see more buy-in and initiative from their team members. A close team, full of mutual trust, will be more successful in garrison or combat than a team that is distant and micromanaged.\n\nA Two-Way Street for Battalion-Level Commanders: A Guide for Transitions\n\n“The formation is never as good as you think it is, but it also is not as screwed up as some may indicate it is to your successor.”\n\nThe Eight Essential Characteristics of Army Officership: BE A STUDENT OF HISTORY\n\nAs a professional, you must immerse yourself in your profession. Military history is full of lessons and examples that you can compare to your situation. “Top block” officers read history and apply it regularly in their work. Taking the time to learn from the past will increase your ability to answer the tough questions when they arise.\n\nField Grade Survival Kit: Succeeding in a Large Headquarters\n\nWhile much has been written about the challenges of serving as a Field Grade (FG) officer at the Battalion and Brigade level, much less is available about the echelons at which you will spend most of the second half of your career. Put simply, there are more ways to fall short than there are to succeed, yet no one tells you the rules when you arrive. Consider a large Headquarters (HQ) to be at the Division level or above and a “boss” to be any of the large numbers of senior leaders, principal staff officers, advisors, and influencers in the HQ, whether in your chain of command or not. While not comprehensive, here are six big ideas.\n\nThe Eight Essential Characteristics of Army Officership: SERVE THOSE YOU LEAD\n\nLeaders who take a genuine interest in their subordinates will see their teams achieve amazing feats. This goes hand in hand with counseling. You must get to know your Soldiers and help them personally and professionally. Find out their goals and help develop a plan to achieve them. If you take care of your Soldiers, they will always take care of the mission.\n\nThe Eight Essential Characteristics of Army Officership: COUNSEL YOUR SUBORDINATES\n\nCounseling is the most important tool that leaders have at their disposal. Clearly communicating expectations and standards provides a baseline for measuring performance and ensures that both the rater and rated officer understand expectations. This is especially important when managing your rater profile and justifying the contents of evaluation reports for both officers and NCOs.\n\nThe Eight Essential Characteristics of Army Officership: LEARN AND IMPROVE\n\nSuperior leaders are acutely aware of their strengths and weaknesses. They actively build on their strengths and improve upon their weaknesses. Complacency is a fatal leadership flaw and we should never find comfort in remaining stagnant. This goes for every aspect of the profession of arms. Make realistic and achievable goals and then work to achieve them.\n\nThe Eight Essential Characteristics of Army Officership: REQUIRE MINIMUM SUPERVISION\n\nOfficers who require constant oversight are detrimental to high op tempo organizations that operate in complex environments. Valuable members of the team understand their responsibilities and execute with little supervision. Asking for the occasional azimuth check is important, but don’t inundate your boss with questions you should be able to answer yourself.\n\nThe Eight Essential Characteristics of Army Officership: SUPPORT YOUR COMMANDER\n\nAn officer who understands mission command and commander’s intent is worth 10 officers who don’t. When you are given a legal and lawful order, execute and stay within your limits. When a commander decides on a course of action, it is not your place to second guess. We advise and make recommendations, commanders make decisions, and assume the risks.\n\nThe Eight Essential Characteristics of Army Officership: LISTEN\n\nAn officer who understands mission command and commander’s intent is worth 10 officers who don’t. When you are given a legal and lawful order, execute and stay within your limits. When a commander decides on a course of action, it is not your place to second guess. We advise and make recommendations, commanders make decisions, and assume the risks.\n\nCommand: A Comeback Story – Part II\n\nTwo weeks ago, I published “Command: A Comeback Story.” Within 24-hours, that story had been viewed more than 2,500 times, and my inbox filled with notes from officers from across our Air Force. Many of those officers asked me to share the “Thoughts on Leadership” document I discussed with my team in 2018. I am happy to do that.\n\nThe Eight Essential Characteristics of Army Officership: LEAD\n\nLeadership is more than knowing where you are, where you want to go, and how you are going to get there. Leading includes inspiring others to take the journey with you. All officers are leaders, regardless of duty position. You must be ready to make decisions, move the mission forward, and lead by example. Great leaders never ask a subordinate to make a sacrifice that he or she is not willing to make. If we hold ourselves to the same standard that we hold our Soldiers, they will strive to meet or exceed that standard.\n\nThe Eight Essential Characteristics of Army Officership\n\nLeadership has always been required, and that remains true in today’s digitally connected, global environment. Leaders must continue to prepare for what is, and for what may come. After 34 years of active-duty service to our country in the Infantry and the Special Forces, I have seen and learned a great deal from many different leaders. Like the author, I have learned many valuable leadership lessons, and continue to learn every day.\n\nAs we all strive to continue learning, MAJ Player has eloquently captured some excellent lessons in the “8 Essential Characteristics of Army Officership.” This book helps to define a number of leadership characteristics that are instrumental in the development of an Army Officer. Excellent leaders attack each day with an intense resolve to improve and become a better leader than they were the day before. This book will be a helpful tool to help hone the critical qualities necessary to become a successful leader. A detailed read and following action plan to personally develop as a leader from some of the lessons in this book will be key as you continue to develop your own leadership skills.\n\nThe views expressed in the foreword are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Army, the Department of Defense, or the US Government.\n\nEric P. Wendt\n\nLieutenant General, U.S. Army\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI wrote the article that would later grow into this short book while sitting in a hotel room in Madrid contemplating how I got there. I was visiting the Spanish and Portuguese militaries as part of my experience in the Army’s Schools of Other Nations (SON) Program. I have spent the last nine months studying at the Colombian Superior School of War, and I sometimes pinch myself to make sure I am not dreaming.\n\nIn 2007, if you told 2LT Player, a “CHEMO” for 3-7 Field Artillery, what the next decade would look like, he would have told you to stop teasing him because he had to finish the USR. I am confident about what he would have said, because I am him, just ten years later. However, in the next ten years, I served in multiple leadership positions at the platoon and company level. I also served in a joint special operations unit, taught ROTC, and was selected to attend a foreign service’s ILE.\n\nI arrived at my first assignment at Schofield Barracks with doom and gloom ringing in my ears. During my Basic Officer Leader Course, my small group leader told me that as a 74A headed to the 25thInfantry Division, I most likely would not have a chance to lead and it would be a constant struggle to be viewed as a serious professional.\n\nFortunately, the battalion operations officer changed my outlook during our initial counseling session. He listened intently as I told him my concerns of being “stuck on staff” and my desire to lead a platoon. He said: “There is no such thing as a bad branch, only bad officers.” He went on to say that if I wanted to lead Soldiers, I needed to demonstrate my leadership potential by performing well. He had a good point. In the Army, we do not always have control over duty assignments, but we have complete control over our performance. I committed myself to earn the right to lead Soldiers and developing the skills and attributes required for success.\n\nAs a result, I discovered what I consider the “Eight Essential Characteristics of Officership.”\n\nLEAD\n\nLeadership is more than knowing where you are, where you want to go, and how you are going to get there. Leading includes inspiring others to take the journey with you. All officers are leaders, regardless of duty position. You must be ready to make decisions, move the mission forward, and lead by example. Great leaders never ask a subordinate to make a sacrifice that he or she is not willing to make. If we hold ourselves to the same standard that we hold our Soldiers, they will strive to meet or exceed that standard.\n\nLISTEN\n\nKeep an open mind and seek advice. Every team has experienced members that are an extremely valuable resource. These team members can provide historical examples of past issues and help guide your decisions. But first, you must be approachable and willing to listen.\n\nSUPPORT YOUR COMMANDER\n\nAn officer who understands mission command and commander’s intent is worth 10 officers who don’t. When you are given a legal and lawful order, execute and stay within your limits. When a commander decides on a course of action, it is not your place to second guess. We advise and make recommendations, commanders make decisions and assume the risks.\n\nLEARN AND IMPROVE\n\nSuperior leaders are acutely aware of their strengths and weaknesses. They actively build on their strengths and improve upon their weaknesses. Complacency is a fatal leadership flaw and we should never find comfort in remaining stagnant. This goes for every aspect of the profession of arms. Make realistic and achievable goals and then work to achieve them.\n\nREQUIRE MINIMUM SUPERVISION\n\nOfficers who require constant oversight are detrimental to high op tempo organizations that operate in complex environments. Valuable members of the team understand their responsibilities and execute with little supervision. Asking for the occasional azimuth check is important, but don’t inundate your boss with questions you should be able to answer yourself.\n\nCOUNSEL SUBORDINATES\n\nCounseling is the most important tool that leaders have at their disposal. Clearly communicating expectations and standards provides a baseline for measuring performance and ensures that both the rater and rated officer understand expectations. This is especially important when managing your rater profile and justifying the contents of evaluation reports for both officers and NCOs.\n\nSERVE THOSE YOU LEAD\n\nLeaders who take a genuine interest in their subordinates will see their teams achieve amazing feats. This goes hand in hand with counseling. You must get to know your Soldiers and help them personally and professionally. Find out their goals and help develop a plan to achieve them. If you take care of your Soldiers, they will always take care of the mission.\n\nBE A STUDENT OF HISTORY\n\nAs a professional, you must immerse yourself in your profession. Military history is full of lessons and examples that you can compare to your situation. “Top block” officers read history and apply it regularly in their work. Taking the time to learn from the past will increase your ability to answer the tough questions when they arise.\n\nMajor Nathan Player is currently serving as the Raleigh Recruiting Battalion Executive Officer. He has 15 years of combined enlisted and officer service, has taught ROTC, commanded, and served in various Joint Staff, USAREC, and Special Operations assignments.\n\nNavigating the Digital Thayer Hall: Remote Learning and the Self-Development Pillar\n\n“I’ll see you after spring break when we will discuss how the Allies won World War Two. Enjoy your week off.” The seventeen cadets enrolled in one of my sections of, “History of the Military Art from 1904 to 2013,” at the United States Military Academy took my words as the cue that class – our final one before the 2020 spring break – was dismissed. They got up from their desks and began filing out of our Thayer Hall classroom to head to a lunch formation.\n\nCommand: A Comeback Story\n\nMy first command experience was difficult. The performance report I received upon “graduating” contains a line without any stratification or quantifiable accomplishments. It would be safe to characterize that line as a throw-away. In my case, that throw-away is the line I take the most pride in. That line is as follows:\n\n“-Inherited broken Gp-lvl unit—applied core values/grit; built standard-setting Sq-equiv—amazing morale & execution”\n\nThe Uncomfortable Conversation: How to Start and Why to Keep Going\n\nProtests in America have literally been a staple of rectifying inequalities from this nation’s origins. In fact, it has been codified and is protected in the First Amendment of the Constitution as the freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. From the Boston Tea Party to the Civil Rights movement that ended segregation and Jim Crow laws, there have been peaceful protests mixed in with violence.\n\n“If you can’t handle the tough conversations, you can’t handle the tough decisions.”\n\nUS Army Command General Staff College: The Lobotomy That Never Was\n\nOn July 10, 2019, I reported to Fort Leavenworth and the Command General Staff College. I had prepared myself to be led into a room with a doctor holding an orbitoclast for the lobotomy I had been promised. After some quick in-processing, I received administrative information before they sent me on my way. I was relieved to still have my mind, but surely the lobotomy everyone had promised would happen later in the year.\n\nU.S. Army CGSC: Overview and Advice for the Class of 2021\n\nWhen I found out that I was selected to attend resident Intermediate Level Education (ILE) at Fort Leavenworth, I immediately realized how little I knew about the course. My research brought up numerous articles from officers discussing their year at Fort Leavenworth. These articles are what I found most useful and are the reason that I decided to write my own. Hopefully, my experience and advice serve two purposes. The first is to assist future classes in understanding the course of instruction and aid in your preparation for the “Best Year of Your Life.” Second, this article will be my attempt to, as General Funk says, “Leave the jersey in a better place than I found it.”\n\nCGSC Speed Dating: AIM2 and You\n\nAssuming the fall assignment and unit interview cycle will proceed as normal, the authors of this blog set out to provide insight into the AIM 2.0 and unit interview process for the incoming CGSOC AY20-21. The process begins almost immediately once the course begins. Prepared officers will develop a game plan to increase their chances of receiving their desired assignment.\n\nReflections on Being an “Iron Major”\n\nIt’s been two years since I completed my Field Grade Key and Developmental (KD) time. Since then, I’ve had the fortunate opportunity to gather my thoughts and reflect on my time as a Battalion and Brigade S3. By no means does my experience make me an expert. If anything, it’s an opportunity to think. My intent is to reinforce common fundamentals with personally unique thoughts. Much of it is directed at the man in the mirror.\n\nA Case for Mastering the Humble Argumentative Essay\n\nThere I was…It was 2013, I was an aviation battalion S-3 in Afghanistan, and my boss had just given me less than 24 hours to write an argumentative essay. Someone at a higher headquarters wanted to redeploy one of our aerial medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) helicopter companies without replacing it. My boss believed this decision would severely impede MEDEVAC in our area of operations and the division commander agreed. He said he would take the issue to his boss and asked us to provide a short paper summarizing our analysis and recommendation. The writing fell to me. I had thought I’d left the argumentative essay behind two years earlier when I graduated from the Command and General Staff College (CGSC). But once again, I found myself crafting a thesis, gathering evidence, and writing an argument.\n\nDon’t raise your voice, improve your argument.\n\n―Desmond Tutu\n\nThe Field Grade Reader\n\nAnyone following the Field Grade Leader knows the importance of reading. Anyone short on material or motivation can find dozens of book lists and a stream of articles that support professional reading. Everyone knows we need to read, but rarely do we talk about how to read. We assume that because we can see and comprehend words and the order they are in, we can read. But is that true? Everyone knows what a map looks like, but not everyone can use it for land navigation.\n\nRowing Through The COVID Era\n\nThis article will review the authors observed trends of new field grades reintroduced back into their respective formations following their year of study at Command and General Staff College (CGSC). It will provide a synopsis of four areas that new field grades inquire about the most before they take on a staff position and considerations on how the environment has changed due to COVID19 since their last position prior to CGSC.\n\nMicrosoft Teams: Information Age Technology to Flatten Communications and Gain Efficiency\n\nMicrosoft Teams is a highly effective command and control system that empowers leaders at echelon to create a collaborative and inclusive environment to share information rapidly, increase understanding, and enable decision making. The Army must maintain this capability to effectively operate in a COVID environment in the 21st Century and Field Grade leaders must embrace technology that helps us propagate data, information, and knowledge across our formations quickly to enable Mission Command and maintain a competitive edge over our adversaries.\n\nLeading During a Pandemic\n\n“Black Swan – First, it is an outlier, as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations…Second, it carries an extreme impact. Third, in spite of its outlier status, human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact…”1\n\n– Nassim Taleb, Black Swan\n\nThere are certain events and circumstances in life that will catch you unprepared or place you in unexpected situations. The author Nassim Taleb categorized these significant events as “Black Swans” in the book that shared the same title. The premise for those types of events is that they are unexpected and have radical and far-reaching effects. Depending on whom you ask, a global pandemic may not have been a surprise throughout certain parts of the world. However, the CoronaVirus-19 (CV-19) pandemic drastically changed how the military operates daily both in garrison and deployed environments. Routine daily in-person contact, group physical training, and meetings were replaced by phone calls, text messages, and smartphone/computer applications. The pandemic highlighted the importance of the individual disciplined initiative, distributed leadership, and technological solutions. The intent of this article is to offer insights from serving as a field grade officer during the CV-19 pandemic and provide concepts and recommendations for future field grade officers that are faced with similar circumstances.\n\nMission Command: The Swiss Army Knife in the “New Normal” of COVID-19\n\nIn March of 2020, the majority of offices in the United States closed to protect its most precious resource, it’s people, from the coronavirus (COVID-19). The Department of Defense leaned forward and transitioned to a majoritytelework environment. How does an organization that is “key and essential” continue to operate? What are the mechanisms and fundamental processes that enable productivity in vulnerable, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environments? The field grade officer must be adaptive and agile in operating any of the settings that may present as a result of COVID-19. These categories are the new normal.\n\nWe Soldier On: Command and Control in the Age of COVID\n\nToday marks a bitter day in the fight against Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), the disease caused by the virus known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Army lost a good leader today, a friend to many across the Army Reserve and Joint communities. He will remain nameless here. His cause of death is still not disclosed, though COVID-19 symptoms appear to have contributed to his death. And by the time you read this, his death will be in the past. The Army will have moved on in a positive direction, with new ways to organize its command and control systems (C2) in the age of COVID. These innovative ways are driven by the mission command approach and by the management of people, processes,networks, and the organization (command post). This leader’s death strikes a lot of America’s front–line warriors personally, as do all deaths and sicknesses caused by this disease. But we Soldier on.\n\n“Bother To Connect…”\n\nWhen asked by a peer and fellow field grade officer, Major Josh Powers, to discuss my thoughts that would best prepare the recent graduates of Command and Staff as they transition back to the operating forces, many themes and ideas came to mind. One idea stood alone…\n\nThe Intangibles of Field Grade Leadership: Seeing the Field and the Power of “No”\n\nBy now, you’ve probably been inundated with advice on how to be an effective staff leader as an Iron Major serving in an S3 or XO role. You’re eager to establish efficient systems for operations and administration, develop a brilliant PSOP, lead the staff through MDMP, translate your commander’s intent into guidance and taskings, and oversee a command post. You’ve probably received some valuable warnings about the ways in which Majors fail. However, successful completion of every task and every mission as a Major means little if you leave a trail of burned-out, bitter, and cynical staff officers and NCOs in your wake. You are now visible to a far broader audience, especially company-grade officers and mid-career NCOs who may be nearing decision points about their future in the military. Unfortunately, the caricature of the grouchy, miserable Major stroking the commander’s ego and sleeping in the office has gained considerable traction in military culture. Gifted junior officers will often see this as a glimpse into their future and choose to pursue another line of work. Understanding and practicing the intangible elements of field grade leadership – beyond staff systems and MDMP – can elevate you from the clichéd stereotype of the grumpy, overworked, “yes–man” clawing for a top-block evaluation to a transformational leader that brings out the best in your unit and its people.\n\nWhat is the “New Normal?”\n\nIt was Romania, and four feet of snow had fallen the night before. Nearly all functions base-wide had been shut down for two days, but my Detachment still had a mission to do. With limited support, to include an impassable three-mile stretch to our office, my Detachment Sergeant and I were literally frozen in time. As we walked through a dug out tunnel of snow to our dining facility, we war-gamed what was important, what could wait, and what just didn’t matter anymore. We knew that we had to decide how and when to put our soldiers in harm’s way to complete the essential aspects of our mission. Even considering the Army’s prescribed Mission Essential Tasks (METs), our definition of essential had changed.\n\nThinking Differently through Think Tanks\n\nA Guest Post by Cody Griner\n\nOver the course of my career, I have had some incredible experiences to discuss strategy with some of the world’s most brilliant minds. One particular moment that really stands out to me is when I had the opportunity to sit in an off the record meeting, in a small, intimate group with a former Secretary of Defense, who I had previously served under. Although I did not agree with all the decisions he had made, through the conversation I came to better understand how he came to those life and death decisions. It was illuminating to hear him discuss the difficult decisions of his career and then his reflection upon in retirement. Ultimately, did what he felt was right at the time for American security and few people have been in such an important role under that kind of microscope. Learning from people with this kind of experience is the best means to prepare for future difficult decisions. This opportunity did not come as part of a formal military program but through a Young Leader program at a think tank.\n\nHumility and Its Discontents\n\nA Guest Post by Matt Kopp\n\nHumility has taken its place in the pantheon of critical military leadership qualities in recent years. The highest praise of a senior leader often is that they accomplish great goals through their units – with a sense of humility. Toxic work environments, operational failures, and personal indiscretions all appear to stem, in part, from an underlying lack of leader humility. The challenge for military leaders is that humility exists on a continuum, and too much humility can lead to passivity and indecision. Also, attempts to demonstrate humility through statements and acts can give off an aura of disingenuousness. Given the amorphous and contradictory nature of humility in military leadership, the concept may provide little functional utility for officers. The following narrative attempts to give a brief framework of the factors that allow officers to lead in the optimal zone of humility.\n\nSuccess in the Army is spelled with a P.\n\nA Guest Post by Joshua Trimble\n\nIn more than 20 years of service there have been several opportunities to offer guidance, mentorship and opinions to other Soldiers on career moves and life decisions. Every situation is slightly different as most individuals have slightly different career, life or family goals. While it may make sense for that aspiring general to move their family five times in six years, it may not be the right move for someone who believes in the Chief of Staff of the Army’s guidance that taking care of our people is the key to success.\n\nGraduation Week 2020\n\nThis year’s Command General Staff College will be graduating and PCSing (hopefully) in the midst of a pandemic that has fundamentally changed the daily lives of people across the world. As these newly minted Majors head back out across the force they are taking the institutional knowledge imparted upon them that will continue to move the Army forward. But it is important to take a look at how COVID-19 has possibly changed some of these lessons learned in the classroom.\n\nThis year’s graduation week initiative will be focused on conducting an “after-action review” of sorts to take a look at how we did in the ongoing response to COVID-19. We all saw leaders across the force do an exceptional job leading organizations through this and we have also seen the struggles to break our norms like haircuts and mass formations for accountability. So how have we done? How will the Army’s experience and DOD inform the future? What systems succeeded or failed? Did Mission Command work in this de-centralized environment or did it prove we talk the talk, but not walk the walk with MC? Should more staff work be done via telework? How else will COVID-19 shape the force moving forward?\n\nContact us at fglinitiatives@gmail.com if you are interested in writing a piece for Graduation Week or have additional questions.\n\nWhy We Read\n\nA Guest Post by Joseph Michaels\n\nMany – if not all – Field Grade Officers (FGOs) can recall the enormous leap from being a highly proficient tactician to an accomplished strategist at a Joint Command. Up until that point in their career, they had forged reputations based on applying their technical expertise in complex scenarios that left little time for second guessing and debate. The first day serving at the operational or strategic level can be particularly nerve-racking. After offering an extensive overview of the mission to a new Major in our Division at Joint Command, he asked how he could best prepare for his new position. The response was simple; read as much as possible. Professional developmental reading will always have a place in each officer’s growth, but every officer can benefit from purposeful reading that facilitates a depth of knowledge capable of assessing dynamic complexities across a wide spectrum of problems.\n\nDisease and Readiness\n\nLessons from the Russian Army in Chechnya\n\nTown hall meetings across the Army in recent weeks have been filled with similar rhetoric from leaders: “we will be safe where possible, but we still have to train in order to maintain our readiness.” Stories from social media and the Army Times have detailed the specifics of this guidance. Large accountability formations, morning physical training in groups, physical fitness tests, Expert Infantryman Badge testing, barracks cleaning parties, units headed to the field to train, the stories of leaders flaunting CDC guidance are almost unending. All of this is being done in the name of readiness. Medical readiness is not simply about ensuring a unit is “green” on MEDPROS slides. Leaders who blindly strive to meet requirements, without understanding or complying with the intent behind them, are missing the point. Leaders seem to forget that health, perhaps more so than training, is an essential part of readiness. While disease is an invisible threat, history shows us that ignoring it or treating it as a tangential factor in decision-making is a costly mistake.\n\nDistributed LPD Session with LTG Martin\n\nWe are super excited to announce our guest for this week’s distributed leader professional development session, Lieutenant General Martin, Training and Doctrine Command Deputy Commanding General.\n\nJoin us via Facebook live on Saturday at 7 PM eastern\n\nClick here to register via Facebook\n\nThe Sun Will Rise\n\nLike you, I’ve spent the past few weeks glued to the news and social media. I’m concerned about all kinds of things, from the safety of my family to the global economy. These are scary times. Still, I’ve faced adversity before. We all have, right? The conditions may have been different, but we’ve all developed tools to survive challenging times. I’d like to offer a few thoughts, given my experience, to help work through these challenges together.\n\nMission Command is Applicable to the Total Force\n\nA Guest Post by Lukas Toth\n\nAs a junior major, wrapping up my year at the College of Naval Command and Staff, I fully expected to find myself as Battalion Executive Officer or maybe on a Brigade or higher staff. I was very surprised when I was selected to command a unique headquarters company in a two-star headquarters consisting of nearly 300 Army Civilians, numerous contractors, and 135 Active and Reserve Soldiers. I had spent the last year learning about operational art and comparing and contrasting the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) with the Naval Planning Process (NPP) in preparation for my cubical on staff.\n\nStruggles in Mission Command\n\nCollectively, the U.S. Army understands the philosophy of Mission Command and defines it well in current doctrine, yet fails to understand how to effectively execute mission command.\n\nThis paper will highlight two significant areas of improvement in the execution of current mission command doctrine within the U.S. Army. First, commanders at echelon must understand well defined strategic and operational objectives in priority order. A greater understanding of the strategic and operational objectives by tactical and operational commanders will encourage disciplined initiative in achieving higher objectives where appropriate. Understanding initiative and risk because immense responsibility has been laid at their feet with unbalanced authority to execute the mission within the commander’s intent. The concept of risk acceptance weighs heavily in this dynamic. Adjustments in the practice of mission command in these two areas will have far reaching effects across domains.\n\nRX: Mission Command\n\nIt’s finally happened. After years of toil and growing pains as a company grade officer, you’ve made it to the next level: the key position of field grade. Moving to your new unit, you are in your first year as the S3 Operations Officer, ready and energetic to make a difference and earn your title of “Iron Major.” The first few weeks of transition and the honeymoon period sail by as you learn the organization, your team, and the new boss. But as the dust settles and you begin to see the landscape from an informed position, you realize that something is wrong.\n\nThere is frustration. There is a lot of frustration. The tension is palpable, with friction on multiple levels. The staff doesn’t cooperate, fights with higher headquarters staff, and is constantly at odds with the company commanders. The commanders are disjointed, with each unit pulling in different directions. No one seems to know what to do next, so they do nothing. You’re frustrated, they’re frustrated, and to make it worse, the boss is frustrated. However, as the newest addition to the team, you realize that you may be the only one with enough perspective to solve the problem.\n\nIt’s clear to you that there is a failure in mission command and that something has to change. However, what is less clear is what the actual problem is. You’ve seen other organizations disintegrate amid mission command failures, with the unit unhappy and unproductive, where it seemed easy to blame the commander for not trusting or providing guidance, or – on the other side of the coin – blame the subordinates for being lazy and not taking initiative. But no one wins in these situations when you’re blaming your own people.\n\nOne evening, after the office has cleared out and you have time to think, you reconsider some past observations. You wonder what your unit’s problem is, and you realize that each of those previous situations was different and unique. A line from Tolstoy drifts into your head, that “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,” and that you need to figure out what your family’s problem is… Deep… You must be getting this field grade thing already. Ok, back on track.\n\nYou intuitively know that jumping to implement a new program or aggressively embarking on a campaign to improve OPORDs is a real rookie mistake. You realize that the first thing you need to do is correctly diagnose the problem – a little mission analysis. From your perspective as mid-level management, you look at both the staff and the commanders as different entities, which might have their own subpopulations and problems. The unit overall is failing and ineffective, and, while this manifests in different ways, it seems like the common theme is lack of confidence.\n\nExamining each piece as if it were a puzzle, you think about what makes the different groups that way… Is it that they are unwilling to take responsibility and initiative? This is the easy and first answer to come to. But with a little more thought, maybe it is more complex than that. Maybe it is about ability, that they are not able to carry out the tasks, based on access or resources, and cannot take the next steps on their own… Or maybe it is that they do not have the capability to do so, that the potential to move forward is there, but not the skill mastery.\n\nIn dissecting the complex problem from different perspectives of staff sections and companies, you realize that they each have different challenges, and that each of these challenges requires a different solution. You come to the conclusion that the principles of mission command align with different approaches to these problems. An incapable staff section with junior leadership might need more training and coaching to increase its competence. A company commander who has recently stepped on it (more than once) does not have the battalion commander’s trust and isn’t allowed to do anything without express permission. In another example, you realize that the whole unit was hamstrung by the ability to exercise a mission, because the staff’s directions and analysis of their order were not good quality, resulting in a less-than-stellar order to the companies.\n\nYou recognize that different populations and diverse situations all had different symptoms of the disease of mission command failure. Not escaping scrutiny, you also realize that there may be situations where the boss did not provide the clearest intent, or may have been unwilling to release the grip of control enough to let things happen. That’s another knot to uncoil.\n\nWith new understanding washing over you, you sketch out a few ideas and recommendations that can be broadly implemented, with a few more that require specific direction at a targeted audience. You know that you need to discuss this with the other Major on staff, your battle buddy, whose different experience and perspective may illuminate other circumstances. Any approach to treating this disease of dysfunction has to be a combined effort.\n\nWhile you are fairly confident with your assessments, you are even more convinced that to cure the mission command problem, you have to correctly diagnose it. Failure to do so would waste precious time and staff calories on the wrong problem. Or, worse yet, succumbing to an attribution error or placing a value judgment (“the staff is lazy” or “the commander doesn’t give guidance”) would create more harm and allow the disease to grow… Armed with this clarity, you’re ready for the next step. You’ve got this.\n\nSubscribe to The Field Grade Leader!\n\nMAJ Williams has operational experience in Iraq and Afghanistan and completed KD time as a battalion and brigade S3.\n\nMission Command + Command and Control: An Imperative for the Reserve Components\n\nA Guest Post by Jon Farr\n\nThe July 2019 update of ADP6-0 contained several changes, notably the reintroduction of command and control as both a method for executing mission command and a warfighting function. The manual’s introduction explains that this was necessary because, since the 2012 edition, the term mission command had become something of a catch-all phrase, muddying definitions and diluting the potential found in decentralized operations. As the Army refocuses on large scale ground combat operations (LSGCO) in a multi-domain environment, differentiating between mission command and command and control is necessary. For the Reserve Components (RC), constrained by time and distance, employing an integrated Mission Command + Command and Control (MC+C2) approach is critical to building readiness. When the commander owns MC and the staff enables C2, units turn the inherent constraints of the RC into building blocks for readiness.\n\nMission Command\n\nA Guest Post by Ryan W. Pallas\n\nThe title gives the reader two words: (1) Mission and (2) Command. For the purpose of this discussion, “Mission” will be referenced as a noun. It is an assumption of the author’s that missions will continually evolve but military forces remain ready to adapt to achieve a successful end state.\n\n“Command” on the other hand will be referenced as a noun and a verb. “Command” is a position found throughout varying levels of the military. “Command” is also a verb. For example, “A Lieutenant Colonel commands a battalion.”\n\nThe Commander’s Intent in Mission Command\n\nA Guest Post by Reece Collins\n\nJuly 2019 saw a huge revision of U.S. Army doctrine. Like everything in the Army though, as much as things change they also stay the same. One of the biggest revisions is the reintroduction of Command and Control into Army lexicon. One of the main reasons this was done was because the concept of Mission Command never took hold across the joint community. The joint force maintained command and control and when joint operations took place that was the terminology used. The reintroduction of command and control into army doctrine synchronizes the Army with the rest of the military arm of national power, yet how the Army approaches command and control will be familiar to anyone who has been leading in the Army over the last decade.\n\nA Rose by Any Other Name\n\nA Guest Post by Andrew Bordelon\n\nThe new mission command approach to command and control identified a confusing gap in command techniques for Army leaders. Prior to the revised 2019 publication of ADP 3-0 Operations and ADP 6-0 Mission Command, mission command and command and control were presented as two techniques for leaders to accomplish their mission. Both techniques had guiding principles, but the commander ultimately chose how much to empower or control a subordinate’s initiative. Both Mission command and command and control, as described in doctrine prior to 2019 strove to reach a similar endstate. A commander wants his subordinates to understand what they have to do and what information he needs to know throughout an operation. He understands that the “fog” of war will present unforeseen challenges to his unit. The two previous concepts were simply different ways to manage multiple subordinates working towards an end state. Today, these concepts have been codified into Mission Command doctrine. The new Mission Command doctrine lays out what the Army wanted to emphasize all along which is the importance of leadership.\n\nEvolutions of Mission Command\n\nA Guest Post by Christopher L'Heureux\n\nSeven years after replacing command and control with mission command, the Army decided to bring it back. There was an oft-stated problem that mission command was a confused concept. It was a group of communications systems, a warfighting function, and a philosophy. The rewrite aimed to clear the ambiguity. In addition, the Army was on its own doctrinal island and the rewrite realigned the Army with sister service, joint, and allied doctrine that had retained the concept of command and control. Finally, the Army had an opportunity. We were planning to consolidate ADPs and ADRPs anyway.\n\nThe problem in the Army wasn’t understanding the difference between a CPOF, using mission orders and intent to get things done, and tasks and processes needed to produce orders. The problem was that we misunderstood the philosophy. Most commonly, leaders interpreted mission command as a hands-off approach to let subordinates figure it out. Mission command was decentralized command and control.\n\nThe Need to Incentivize the Well-Rounded Leader\n\nA Guest Post by Jamison Richart\n\nMilitary leadership understands there is a problem with retention. Across the services, a common hot button issue is how to maintain a force large enough to meet the military’s requirements. To maintain current strength the services must recruit 150,000 individuals per annum to replace those who are choosing to leave, and this training bill in terms of manpower and money greatly detracts from readiness. This is true in both the enlisted and officer ranks and across career fields. With some training pipelines lasting anywhere from six months to two years the numbers game is academic.\n\nA Candidate’s Thoughts on the Battalion Commander’s Assessment Program\n\nA Guest Post by Tara Bradley\n\nIn full disclosure, if you think this article will provide some sort of insight to gain a foothold at the Battalion Commander’s Assessment Program (BCAP); it won’t. What it will do is provide some of my thoughts based on my attendance as part of FY20’s BCAP Cohort 002. There is a lot of mystery surrounding the program and within the scope I’m allowed, I will share my impressions on my involvement.\n\nPerhaps due to my 16+ years within the legacy command slating process, I was skeptical on the utility of the BCAP. While the BCAP introduces multiple “vectors” of additional information for a board to consider, it also only presents a snapshot in time of an officer. You have a bad day, and your physical fitness test score is not as high as usual. You didn’t sleep well, and your assessments suffered. The reality is, although it is only a snapshot, it is also real life for a Battalion Commander. Not every day is a great day; sometimes it’s just okay. If the BCAP can provide some additional insight into the “wholeness” of an officer, or even just identify an officer who may potentially derail an organization with an abusive or toxic attitude, then I think it is worth a try.\n\nAudiobooks are Life Changing\n\nA Guest Post by Allie Weiskopf\n\nTwo years ago someone gave me an audio book (“Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less” by Greg McKeown, read it!) and it changed my life. Without altering time with work or family, I listened to 100 books in 2018, and I listened to 150 books in 2019 – audiobooks literally changed my life.\n\nLeader, Upskill Thyself: Learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as an FGO\n\nA Guest Post by Kurt Degerlund\n\nThis winter, as I watched my foreign language instructor spend 5-10 hours every week filling out routine administrative paperwork, I realized that there were AI/ML technologies available that could not only have automated most of that work but also made it more accurate. This would have allowed her to spend those hours working on class preparation or working on the textbook she dreams of writing. But, because I didn’t know how AI/ML works, I could not advise her on the basics of how to free her time. Who has not stayed late at work, filling out paperwork that should have been automated? Wouldn’t it be nice to not waste time filling out paperwork, but instead use the insights we are supposed to be getting from that data to build better units? This frustration motivated me to begin looking more closely at how AI/ML works, what it requires to be implemented, and how to prepare myself to lead in an AI/ML environment. As I investigated this field, I realized that my technical skills are lacking. I needed to go back to school to be an effective AI/ML leader so I began exploring where I could learn these skills on my own. And if I, one of the slower people in the room, am looking for ways to learn these skills, then other FGOs must be looking as well.\n\nGoal Setting – A Military Leader’s Perspective\n\nA Guest Post by Chris L’Heureux\n\nGoal setting is something we do almost every day without much thought. I carry around a list of things-to-do with 50+ items on it. Most of these tasks are simple – respond thoughtfully to an email for example. Many are sub-tasks that contribute to a larger goal. Within this list are a several things I want to accomplish but tend to carry from week to week. A few align to personal or professional development objectives, but these are rare. Is a things-to-do list the acme of goal setting? I think not, but it is a list of what needs to be done…and a start.\n\nUncertain Times\n\nDoesn’t it seem like the world is just plain crazy these days? Should we attribute it to the 24-hour news cycle? The constant interconnectivity of human beings through social media? Perhaps it is just increased awareness associated with a coming of age. Whatever the cause, the world seems to spin faster and faster, pushing us along a path towards uncertainty and potential danger.\n\nTalent Management: Expose your Captains to Post-KD Opportunities\n\nA Guest Post by Zachary Griffiths and Nicholas Frazier\n\nWhat advice should one offer to Captains for post-company command assignments? After Captain branch qualifying or key development (KD) positions, officers face significant career decisions. Should they stay in their current branch, leave active duty, or apply for a functional area? For those staying in, Intermediate Level Education (ILE) options present a wide-range of options. As first-line mentors, Majors have a responsibility to educate and inform Captains about broadening opportunities. In the spirit of talent management and AIM 2.0, the article explores methods to educate Captains to post-key developmental (KD) broadening opportunities. We conclude panels best educate and inform about their opportunities ahead.\n\nNot Already!: How to Escape the Dreaded New Year’s Resolution Curse\n\nA Guest Post by Heather Pace\n\nIt’s that time of year again—when some of us ponder our new year’s resolutions, determined that this time we will PT more, read more, spend more quality time with our families, and never eat fast food again. And, depending on our level of discipline, some of us may stick with those resolutions for days or even weeks. Few of us, though, manage to adhere to them for an entire journey around the sun. Maybe, just maybe, you’re reading this laughing because you’ve already broken one of your 2020 resolutions. If so, no worries. It’s time to start over again and ensure you meet one goal by resolving to finish reading this short article.\n\nFour Keys to Ensuring Your Subordinates’ Success\n\nA Guest Post by Nathan K. Player\n\nIn the eyes of many young Soldiers, “their LT” represents the Army. If you care, the Army cares. If you don’t, the Army doesn’t. When an organization cares about your well-being, the natural reaction is to return the sentiment. Leaders who take a genuine interest in their subordinates will see their teams achieve amazing feats. To help new leaders get started in this important facet of their stewardship this article will discuss four topics: get to know your Soldiers; assist in their personal and professional needs; find out their goals and help develop a plan to achieve them; take care of your soldiers, they will always take care of the mission.\n\nThe System is Down – An Approach to Systems Leadership as a Major\n\nA Guest Post by Kevin Ryan\n\nI often tell people that being the Intelligence Officer for a Brigade Combat Team was the only job in 13 years of service that I felt as uncomfortable on Day 1 as I did on my last day. It was the first position I held after graduating from Command and Staff College; a training center rotation 3 months into the job; and deploying to Iraq 3 months later to advise and assist the Iraqi security forces in the liberation of Mosul from the Islamic State made for a tumultuous tenure. But probably the toughest part was that it was my first “key developmental” job as a field grade leader – finding my leadership style as a Major was my biggest challenge.\n\nMajors Play Key Role in a Battalion’s Leader Development Program\n\nA Guest Post by Christopher L'Heureux\n\nRecent posts on this blog got me thinking about the role majors play in leader development within a battalion. The responsibility for leader development, as with everything else, falls squarely on the commander’s shoulders, but most majors possess a strong desire to mentor and the critical knowledge and skills needed to develop others. They have two or three assignments and a year of school between them and the next most senior officers in a battalion. But they command nothing and are most often caught in a robust game of whack-a-mole in their everyday jobs as XO and S3. They have desire and experience but little time and no control of the program. So how can majors contribute? While each commander will have a perspective on what the majors do, I offer a few thoughts:\n\nOrganize. To start, organize the program for the boss. Sure, the boss is hands-on and directive but you can help. Make sure leader development on the calendar, discussed in the training and training resource meetings, and that it aligns with the overall training guidance. If you cannot answer “why” you’re executing a particular leader development session, then there is work to be done. Initially, my program focused on character due to some culture problems in the organization. As we got past those, we shifted to competence-based topics oriented on upcoming training, all the while ensuring the team understood why we were talking about what we were talking about.\n\nPrioritize. Where does leader development fit into unit priorities? Maybe it’s not first in your organization but it was my top priority. That didn’t mean it didn’t get stepped on now and again. Prioritizing is a continuous fight, and it was my majors who kept most leader development sessions from being stepped on from above and below. You only control what you add to the calendar. Can you cancel the static display for the visiting dignitaries that just came up? Nope. But higher will not bat an eye when you cancel your LPD. Take the hard road and use your relationships up and across the brigade to minimize the effect on leader development sessions…fight for the time.\n\nFill the gaps. Leader development is often parceled off to a subordinate who is told to run with it. Ensure those charged with execution prepare (even when it’s the boss). If the commander is not personally getting the back brief, majors should pick up that slack. A single poor leader development session can kill the motivation in a program. Make sure sessions are interesting, relevant, and with the right audience. Interject when necessary. You’ll need platoon sergeants and above to orchestrate big change within a battalion. Having lieutenants read new doctrine in front of the battalion leadership like open mic night at the local coffee house, however, isn’t going to cut it.\n\nProvide all-around feedback. Leverage the natural relationships the XO and S3 have with company commanders and XOs to explain objectives and obtain feedback. Is the program doing what the boss wants? If not, let the boss know. Also, support bottom-fed ideas. When the LTs ask to do a book club, figure out how to make that happen. Any spark from below is a thousand times more powerful than something from above. Help the boss understand what the officers and NCOs of the unit want and need. Push back when you don’t think the program is aligned with organizational objectives. Remember, the commander will often do things based on their experience; help them connect the dots.\n\nDevelop content. Seek opportunities to develop content; I see this as a major’s greatest contribution to leader development. The XO and S3 oversee almost every system in the battalion. As a result, you are in a unique position to understand where the organization is weak and have the experience to do something valuable to address it. Is it command supply discipline, maintenance, weapons qualification, or LFX planning that is lacking? My XO created and ran an XO Academy for company XOs and any other lieutenant who aspired to be one. My S3 instituted a Maneuver LFX Certification Program for leaders. Both programs developed individual competence and a more effective overall"
