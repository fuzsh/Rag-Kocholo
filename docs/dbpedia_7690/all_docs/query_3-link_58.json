        "text": "1 RNSWR - A Brief History and lineage\n\n1 RNSWR traces its ancestry furthest back of all New South Wales battalions, directly to the 1st Sydney Volunteer Rifles, which was formed in Sydney in 1854 as part of the Colony's concern at the possibility of a Russian naval squadron raid associated with the Crimean War.\n\nInterim 'ancestors' through to the Great War were:\n\nFrom 1860, 1st Regiment, New South Wales Rifle Volunteers, comprising 1st (Sydney) and 2nd (Suburban) Battalions;\n\nFrom 1878, 1st and 2nd Regiments, New South Wales Volunteer Infantry;\n\nFrom 1903, '1st and 2nd Australian Infantry Regiments.\n\nThese units had made substantial contributions to the forces for the Soudan in 1885 and the Boer War 1899 to 1902.\n\n1st Battalion, Australian Imperial Force was raised at Randwick, as part of 1st Brigade, 1st Division of the expeditionary force for Great War service overseas. Serving with distinction throughout the Gallipoli Campaign, its members Private Keysor and Captain Shout each won a Victoria Cross at Lone Pine in August 1915. 1916 to 1918 saw the Battalion in France and Flanders, Corporal Howell being awarded a Victoria Cross at Second Bullecourt in May 1917\n\nBetween World Wars, 1st Battalion AMF, the inheritor of twenty-four Great War Battle Honours, was in 1927 titled The East Sydney Regiment, then in 1937 The City of Sydney's Own Regiment. At various times it was linked with `19th and 45th Battalions. Not serving overseas in the Second World War, it was disbanded in 1944.\n\nThe Second Australian Imperial Force, raised as in the Great War, saw the advent of 2/1st Battalion, at Ingleburn in October 1939, as part of 16th Brigade, 6th Division. Hard service in North Africa, Greece, Crete and New Guinea included distinguished action in Crete, nevertheless culminating in surrender on orders from higher command. Its nineteen Battle Honours passed in due course to the 1st Battalion AMF.\n\nFrom 1954, the '1st Commando Company provided continuity, until its 1957 redesignation and the raising of 1st Infantry Battalion (Commando) (The City of Sydney's Own Regiment). On 1 July 1960, this became No. 1 Company (Commando) (The City of Sydney Company) The Royal New South Wales Regiment, in turn redesignated in 1965 1st Battalion, The Royal New South Wales Regiment (Cdo).\n\nThe Commando role was separated from the Regiment] May 1971, 1st Battalion then being linked with the 19th to form 1/19 RNSWR, whose 'Special Conditions', remote location membership role continued until 1995, when all units became able to offer flexible conditions of service.\n\n2 RNSWR - A Brief History and Lineage\n\nThere has been a volunteer infantry presence in Newcastle since 1860, when The Newcastle Volunteer Rifle Corps was formed. The 2nd Battalion traces its lineage through various name changes and reorganisations from this time. Troops from the Newcastle area served in both the Soudan 1885 and Boer War 1899 to 1902 Campaigns.\n\nRecruited generally from Newcastle and the Hunter Valley, the 2nd Battalion, Australian Imperial Force was raised at Randwick as part of 1st Brigade, 1st Division of the expeditionary force for Great War service overseas. Its distinguished service included the Landing at Anzac, the Gallipoli Campaign and France and Flanders, and one of its members, Private Kenney was awarded the Victoria Cross at Bullecourt in April 1917.\n\nBetween World Wars, 2nd Battalion AMF, which had inherited twenty-four Great War Battle Honours, was titled The City of Newcastle Regiment. It was at various times linked with the 41st and 35th Battalions. Not serving overseas in the Second World war, it was disbanded, as 41st/2nd Battalion, in 1946.\n\nThe Second Australian Imperial Force, raised as in the Great War, saw the advent of 2/2nd Battalion, at Ingleburn in October 1939, as part of 16th Brigade, 6th Division. Again recruited largely from the same areas as its Great War predecessor, it created its own distinguished war record in North Africa, Greece, Crete and New Guinea. Lieutenant Chowne was awarded, posthumously, a Victoria Cross for action in the Dagua area, New Guinea in March 1945. The Battalion's fifteen Battle Honours passed in due course to the 2nd Battalion AMF.\n\nThe post-war Army restructuring in 1948 included the reformation of 2nd Battalion, based on Newcastle. The 1 July 1960 reorganisation resulted in redesignation as C Company (City of Newcastle Company) 2nd Battalion The Royal New South Wales Regiment. However, from 1 July 1965, the 2nd Battalion was reformed in its own right as a battalion of The Royal New South Wales Regiment.\n\nIn 1968, the battalion was honoured by the Grant of the Freedom of Entry to the City of Newcastle.\n\nThe reorganisation of the Army Reserve in 1987caused the linking of the 2nd and 17th Battalions, to form 2/17 RNSWR.\n\nThe Ceremonial linking Parade was held in Newcastle on 5 December of that year.\n\n3 RNSWR - A Brief History and Lineage\n\nThere has been a volunteer infantry presence in the Werriwa district since 1869, when the Goulburn Volunteer Rifle Company was formed. The 3rd Battalion traces its lineage to this Colonial era corps, through the 3rd, 1st and 2nd Regiments of New South Wales Volunteer Infantry successively, and, from 1903,the 2nd Australian Infantry Regiment. (2 AIR)\n\nTroops from the Werriwa area served in both the Soudan 1885 and Boer War 1899 to 1902 Campaigns.\n\nThe 3 rd Battalion, Australian Imperial Force was raised as part of 1st Brigade, 1st Division of the expeditionary force for Great War service overseas. The battalion, initially located at Randwick, drew its recruits generally from the Werriwa (at that time the 43rd Infantry Regiment's) area. It served throughout the Gallipoli Campaign and subsequently played a notable role in all the major operations of the AIF in France and Flanders. One member, Private Hamilton, was awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry at lone Pine in August 1915.\n\nBetween World Wars, 3rd Battalion AMF, which had inherited twenty-three Great War Battle Honours, was titled The Werriwa Regiment. lt was at various times linked with 4th and 53rd Battalions. This unit saw active service in the Second World War in New Guinea and was one of only two militia units to fight alongside its Second Australian Imperial Force counterpart. It was subsequently absorbed into that unit, and shares seven Battle Honours with it.\n\nThe Second Australian Imperial Force, raised as in the Great War, saw the advent of the 2/3rd Battalion, at Ingleburn, in October 1939, as part of 16th Brigade, 6th Division. The unit saw hard service in North Africa, Greece, Syria and New Guinea, while elements fought in Crete.\n\nlt was one of only two Australian battalions to fight against 'all the King's enemies' in that war.\n\nThe battalion's twenty-two Battle Honours passed in due course to the 3rd Battalion AMF.\n\nThe post-war Army restructuring in 1948 included the reformation of 3rd Battalion, based on Canberra. The 1 July 1960 reorganisation resulted in redesignation as C Company (The Werriwa Company) 3rd Battalion The Royal New South Wales Regiment, however from 1 July 1965, 3rd Battalion was reformed in its own right as a battalion of The Royal New South Wales Regiment. In 1981, the battalion was honoured by the Grant of the Freedom of Entry to the City of Canberra.\n\nThe reorganisation of the Army reserve in 1987 caused the linking of the 3rd and 4th Battalions, to form 4/3 RNSWR.\n\nThe Ceremonial linking Parade was held at Ingleburn on 26 September of that year.\n\n4 RNSWR - A Brief History and Lineage\n\nThe lineage of 4 RNSWR descends in two strands from the Newtown Volunteer Rifle Corps (1862) and the Ashfield Volunteer Reserve Corps (1885), through many re-designations, culminating in the raising of 4th Infantry Battalion in 1921 from 2nd Battalion, 36th Infantry Regiment (Newtown strand) and 5th Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment (Ashfield strand).\n\nThrough its colonial forebears, 4th Battalion derives its title 'The Australian Rifles and the Battle Honour 'South Africa 1900-02'.\n\nThe4th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force was raised as part of 1st Brigade, 1st Division of the expeditionary force for Great War service overseas. Initially located at Randwick, the battalion saw service throughout the Gallipoli Campaign, notably at Lone Pine and subsequently served with distinction in the campaigns of France and Flanders through to 1918.\n\nBetween World Wars, 4th Battalion AMF, which had inherited twenty-three Great War Battle Honours, was titled Australian Rifles and for a time was linked with the 3rd Battalion. The 4th Battalion saw active service in New Guinea in the Second World War, being awarded two Battle Honours.\n\nThe Second Australian Imperial Force, raised as in the Great War, saw the advent of 2/4th Battalion, at Ingleburn in October 1939, as part of 16th Brigade, 6th Division. With subsequent reorganisation, it became part of 19th Brigade, of that same division. Serving with distinction in North Africa, Greece, Crete, the Northern Territory and New Guinea, its share of the defence of Crete against airborne invasion was notable. Private Kenna was awarded the Victoria Cross for action near Wewak, New Guinea in May 1945. The Battalion's fifteen Battle Honours passed in due course to 4th Battalion AMF.\n\n1957 saw the re‑raising of 4th Battalion AMF, from existing Riverina District units. Subsequent absorption into 3rd Battalion The Royal New South Wales Regiment as D Company (The Australian Rifles Company) and E Company (The Riverina Company) was followed by re-activation in its own right, on 1 July 1965, as 4th Battalion The Royal New South Wales Regiment. In 1980, the battalion was honoured by the Grant of the Freedom of Entry to the City of Wollongong.\n\nThe reorganisation of the Army reserve in 1987 caused the linking of the 4th and 3rd Battalions, to form 4/3 RNSWR.\n\nThe Ceremonial linking Parade was held at Ingleburn on 26 September of that year.\n\n17 RNSWR - A Brief History and lineage\n\nThe first volunteer infantry corps to be raised in Sydney's northern metropolitan area was the St. Leonards Volunteer Rifles, in 1860. From this, and through the 1stRegiment, New South Wales Volunteer Infantry and, from 1903 the 1st Australian Infantry Regiment, the 17th Battalion traces its lineage, and from these predecessors it derives the Battle Honours \"Suakin, 1885 and \"South Africa, 1899-1902\".\n\nIn 1914, 17th Infantry Regiment AMF was on the Order of Battle but was not called on for overseas service.\n\nThe 17th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force was formed at Liverpool as part of 5th Brigade, 2nd Division, of the now enlarged expeditionary force for Great War service overseas. Its distinguished war service commenced with the August 1915 Gallipoli Peninsular battles and continued notably throughout the France and Flanders operations, to 1918. Private Jackson's actions near Armentieres in June 1916 resulted in the award of the Victoria Cross.\n\nBetween World Wars, 17th Battalion AMF, which had inherited twenty Great War Battle Honours, was titled The North Sydney Regiment. Not serving overseas in the Second World War, it was disbanded in 1944.\n\nThe Second Australian Imperial Force, raised as in the Great War, saw the advent of 2/17th Battalion, at Ingleburn in May 1940, as part of 20th Brigade, 7th Division. Becoming part of the 9th Division in the Middle East, it saw hard service in North Africa, New Guinea and Borneo. Its first action, at Tobruk in April 1941, included gallantry by Corporal Edmondson resulting in the award, posthumously, of the Victoria Cross. The battalion's sixteen Battle Honours passed in due course to the 1 7th Battalion AMF.\n\nThe post‑war Army restructuring in 1948 included the reformation of 17th Battalion, which was then linked with 18th Battalion AMF to form 17th/1 8th Battalion (The North Shore Regiment). The 1 July 1960 reorganisation resulted in re-designation as B Company (The North Shore Company) 2nd Battalion The Royal New South Wales Regiment, however from 1 July1965,the 17th Battalion was reformed in its own right as a battalion of The Royal New South Wales Regiment.\n\nIn 1978, the battalion was honoured by the Grant of the Freedom of Entry to the Municipality of Kuring-gai.\n\nThe reorganisation of the Army Reserve in 1987 caused the linking of the 17th and 2nd Battalions, to form 2/17 RNSWR.\n\nA Ceremonial linking Parade was held at Newcastle on 5 December of that year.\n\n19 RNSWR - A Brief History and Lineage\n\nIn 1860 the South Sydney Volunteer Corps, a sub‑unit of 1st Regiment, New South Wales Rifle Volunteers, was raised. From this colonial era corps, through a complex series of re-designations and reorganisations, 1 9th Infantry Battalion was formed in 192 1.\n\nThe 19th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force was formed at Liverpool on 27April 1915 as part of 5th Brigade, 2nd Division, of the now‑enlarged expeditionary force for Great War service overseas. Serving with distinction in the latter part of the Gallipoli Campaign and then throughout the France and Flanders operations, it was notable for its part in the 2nd Division's attack on Mont St. Quentin in September 1918. Lieutenant Storkey was awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry at Villers Bretonneux in April 1918.\n\nBetween World Wars, 19th Battalion, which had inherited twenty Great War Battle honours, was based in the Southern Sydney area, and at various times was linked with 1st and 20th Battalions. The 1 9th Battalion (redesignated from the Darwin Infantry Battalion) from November 1941 served in the defence of Darwin and later as an Australian Imperial Force unit in New Guinea and New Britain, until disbandment in 1945.\n\nThe Second Australian Imperial Force, raised as in the Great War, saw the advent of 2/19th Battalion, at Wallgrove on 15July 1940, as part of 22nd Brigade, 8th Division. Following the Pacific War outbreak in December 1941 and being deployed in Northern Malaya, they were the first Australian Army unit to engage the Japanese. There followed a fighting withdrawal, with numerous fierce actions, culminating in a general capitulation on Singapore Island. The battalion's members suffered severely as captives to war's end. Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, the Commanding Officer, was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions at Parit Sulong in January 1942.\n\nBattalion AMF, though not raised until somewhat later, was the inheritor of the wartime units 'three and four Battle Honours respectively. Its raising occurred on 12 December 1966, as Battalion The Royal New South Wales Regiment and as a 'Special Conditions' unit, to provide remotely-located persons subject to National Service legislation with the opportunity to exercise the option of Citizen Military Force, rather than Regular Army, service.\n\nOn 1 May 1971, the 1st and the 19th Battalions were once again linked, to form 1/19 RNSWR, with a continuation of the 'Special Conditions' role.\n\n41 RNSWR - A Brief History and Lineage\n\nThe volunteer infantry presence in the State's Northern Rivers area since 1899 provides the earliest military links for the 41st Battalion. The then Maclean Company Scottish Rifles became, through various reorganisations, the 12th (Byron) Infantry by early in the Great War. Further reorganisations led to the forming in 1921 of41st Infantry Battalion.\n\nThe 41st Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, came into existence in the Enoggera area on 1 January 1916, as part of the raising of additional expeditionary force divisions following the evacuation of the 1 stand 2nd Divisions from the Gallipoli Peninsular.\n\nThe 41st, originally the 35th but now renumbered, embarked for England on 17May`1916, as part of M th Brigade, 3rd Division. Its recruits were generally from southern Queensland and northern New South Wales.\n\nFrom December of that ear to May 1918, the battalion played a distinguished part in all significant operations of the AI Fin France and Flanders. In its first major action, Messines Ridge, the whole of the battalion staff was lost to enemy action. Notwithstanding this severe setback, the battalion still performed to a standard warranting receipt of a commendation from the Divisional Commander, (then) Major General John Monash. It has been a matter of pride that no member of 41st Battalion was taken prisoner. The Victoria Cross was awarded to lance Corporal B.S. Gordon, MM, for his gallantry at Bray, France, 26‑27 August 1918. The Battalion was awarded fifteen Battle Honours for its Great War service.\n\nThe inheritor of these Battle Honours and traditions was the 41st Battalion AMF whose territorial title 'The Byron Regiment was reconfirmed in 1927.\n\nBetween the Great War and Second World War, the battalion experienced various linkages with 2nd and 33rd Battalions, and was re‑activated in its own right in 1937. Though becoming an AI F battalion in 1942, it d id not serve overseas during the Second World War, rather being linked, as 41st/2nd Battalion (AI F) from December 1943. The battalion was disbanded on 17 December 1945."
