        "text": "So I have a glorious update since my first entry. I have found \"hints\" in letters then explicit (some very disturbing) information in letters dated AFTER May 15th 1945. This quest has occupied my thoughts and life for a solid 6 weeks. I'm getting so close. I lost any connection of him in 1943. I was told he went to Iceland and now made \"that\" connection. I was confused about his accounts of Cherbourg (not Normandy) but now know he then joined Patton's 3rd Army after battle in Liege (which he later says was the worse place ever), St. Lo, mentioned \"hedgerows & pillboxes\" which, no clue until I drilled down weeks later, left Patton's 3rd Army and joined the 4267th Quartermaster Truck Company which there is absolutely NO records published \"yet\". I did find a report written by Brig. Gen McNamara outlining 1st Army through Europe. After leaving the 3rd Army, he joined the 9th Army- Quartermaster Truck Company and references \"Red Ball Express\" often. He even sends newspaper clips. I'm not certain of the (9th Army) but he says that's where he went after 3rd. But no doubt, he was mailing home 4267 Quartermaster Truck Co, APO 350 for almost a year. His letters his December 1944 are normal and they reference \"hope we eat as good on Christmas as Thanksgiving\", next letter dated the 16th December 1944, we are leaving so I can't write every day AND was transferred \"yesterday\" to 1st Army. So history is clear. He says he has \"lots of points\" since he received 4 stars from \"Fortification of Europe & Germany\" and I cannot figure that out. He's afraid to come home later because they said he'd go to Pacific after.\n\nSo I find out, the army plays a \"shell game\" with soldiers and points and tries to \"reassign\" him. He tells my grandma his \"new APO\" but next letter says they cancelled his transfer.\n\nI forgot to mention that he writes my grandma after May 15th, that if she saw any newspaper of the \"crossing of the Rhine\", then she'd see his truck crossing the temp bridge, Couldn’t see him but that was his truck, I downloaded that photo\n\nSo until August 1945, he is hauling German prisoners back to Berlin. He actually (typed for only the 2nd time) a V-Mail dated 4-17-45 what he witnessed the day before. What he witnessed I now know was the beginning of the nightmares he had written many times about and my grandma telling me when he got home she was afraid of him hurting her because of bad dreams. They were a 1/2 day behind the Gardelegen Massacre. The V-mail affected me greatly. He had already passed the Malmedy event so this is the second.\n\nAfter the war was over, they had his company transporting prisoner’s non-stop. He never sleeps, food isn't provided, Russians are stealing everything and his convoy has been held up 2 times, both 5-7 hours. Russians would take the female prisoners and rape them all, in plain sight he said. If they resisted, they killed them. He drove up until August 5, 1945. It was only then that they inspected his trucks and told them they were going home.\n\nTo end my long and rambling email, the things I am trying to piece together now is anything about 4267 Quartermaster Truck Company and their \"activities\" reports. To my knowledge and all of my never-ending searches, I have hit a dead end. It shows the Archives \"have\" files but not available yet. I also contacted the Quartermaster Museum and they have no info either.\n\nYou all have been a Godsend from day one and those \"hints\" have helped fill in a lot. He reinlisted in the Air Force and I am in touch with Vance AFB Historian and making a trip on September 25th to visit on base about his \"after Army\" carreer with was full of adventure itself\n\nBlessings to all! I'm just a proud grandaughter to an amazing grandpa, war hero and Master Sergeant, Glenn Morse Hardgrave!\n\nAngela Hardgrave Hudson\n\nPS: Now I have an outline, I have a friend who is a published author (history mostly) whi is helping me write a report to present to the WWII museum for the archives at my appointment with \"their\" historian in November! :-)\n\nSome information from the Army interwar order of battle, published by the Army University Press.\n\nK Company would have been in the 3d Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment. Although the Regiment was stationed at Fort Benning, the 3d Battalion was stationed at Fort Sill. It was a separate infantry regiment (not assigned to a division) and served as the demonstration regiment for the Infantry School at Fort Benning (now Fort Moore).\n\nThe 38th Infantry Regiment (less 1st Battalion) was stationed at Fort Douglas Utah, with only a 2d and 3d Battalion. The 1st Battalion was activated at Fort Sill, Oklahoma on 1 May 1939 at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Company B would have been part of the 1st Battalion, and typically when they activate a new battalion, they will assign personnel from other units on the installation to serve as cadre for the new unit. I suspect that both battalions were understrength until the peacetime draft started in September 1940. Oh, and the 38th Infantry Regiment was part of the 3d Infantry Division. On 12 October 1939 The Regiment was reassigned form the 3d Infantry Division to the 2d Infantry Division, which was headquartered at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\n\nOn 9 November 1939 the Regiment was transferred to Camp Bullis, Texas, which was a sub-installation of Fort Sam Houston. At the time it was \"in the boonies;\" it's now surrounded by expensive housing on three sides. Living conditions were probably miserable there--they are now. I've spend my fair share of time there. It's hot and dusty in the summer and cold and dusty in the winter.\n\nOn 24 February 1941 the Regiment moved from Camp Bullis to Fort Sam Houston.\n\nAs for the change between armies:\n\nIn World War II, the field armies provided logistical support to the divisions (not, as was stated, the corps--that change came in the 1970s--in World War II the corps were tactical headquarters only).\n\nWhen the Normandy landings were made, the two US Corps that landed--the V and VII Corps--fell under the Control of Omar Bradley's First Army. Once the beachhead expanded, more divisions were landed, then more corps headquarters, and then the Third Army under Patton. He was in charge of the breakout from the beachhead. The British also had the Eighth Army under Montgomery, and once we got a large enough force, Courtney Hodges took command of the First Army and Bradley stood up the Twelfth Army Group. The Ninth Army landed after the Third Army did, and was generally on Patton's flank.\n\nSo an army-level support unit, like the one your grandfather was in, could easily have been under the control of the First Army early on in the landing, then been moved under Third Army, then under the Ninth Army. And if they were in support of a specific division or corps, and that division or corps was moved from one army back to another, his company could have moved back and forth as well.\n\nSo why did he go from infantryman to truck driver to air force person?\n\nTwo thoughts:\n\nFirst, he might not have. Every company has people assigned to it who aren't infantry. Company clerks, the company supply clerk, etc. So he could have been one of those, and then just been reassigned. And then when he joined the Army Air Forces, he could have still been in the same specialty, just with better living conditions. Although he could have reenlisted and been retrained for something else.\n\nOr maybe he was just so bad a shot they figured it best for all that they let him drive a truck . . . :-)\n\nIf you want to understand what his campaigns were, go to Wikipedia and look up the \"European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal\" and it will explain all of them. But basically:\n\n\"Normandy\" was the initial landings and the fighting in the hedgerow country. That's where Cherbourg comes in. It was critical to the overall plan and took much longer to capture than they expected. And when they did capture it, the Germans had destroyed the port, which was NOT part of the plan.\n\n\"Northern France\" was the Breakout and Pursuit.\n\n\"Rhineland\" was the approach to the German border\n\n\"Ardennes\" was the Battle of the Bulge\n\n\"Central Europe\" was the fight for Germany\n\nEash of these campaigns covered large areas. So, for example, if your dad was in the Ninth Army during the Battle of the Bulge, he may have been holding the shoulder of the Bulge and the rest of the front line while Patton wheeled the Third Army 90 degrees to launch a counterattack."
