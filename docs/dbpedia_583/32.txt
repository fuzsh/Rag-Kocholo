Inukai Tsuyoshi (犬養 毅, April 20 1855–May 15 1932) was a Japanese politician and the 29th Prime Minister of Japan from December 13 1931 to May 15 1932.

He was born in Okayama Prefecture. Initially working as a journalist, he turned to politics and became Minister of Education in 1898. In 1929 he became president of the Seiyukai party and was elected as Prime Minister in 1931.

Inukai's assassination by young naval officers in Tokyo on May 15 1932 was a key event in Japanese history, known as the go ichi go jiken (May 15 incident). It marked the end of party political control over government decisions until after World War II.

Interestingly, in the original assassination plot, the plan included killing Charlie Chaplin, the film star who happened to be visiting Japan at the time. When the prime minister and his family members were killed, his son Ken Inukai was watching a Sumo wrestling match with Charlie Chaplin, which probably saved Ken.
