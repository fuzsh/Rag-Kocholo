        "text": "Inukai Tsuyoshi (born 4 June 1855) is a Japanese politician and the 29th Prime Minister of Japan.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nInukai was born to a former samurai family of the Niwase Domain, in Niwase village, Bizen Province, Okayama Prefecture, and was a graduate of Keio Gijuku in Tokyo. In his early career, he worked as a journalist. He went with the Imperial Japanese Army to the front during the Satsuma Rebellion as a reporter for the Yubin Hochi Shimbun.\n\nPolitical career[]\n\nInukai helped form the Rikken Kaishinto (Constitutional Reform Party) political party in 1882, which supported liberal political causes, and strongly opposed the domination of the government by members of the former Chōshū and Satsuma domains. He was first elected to the Lower House of the Imperial Diet in 1890, and was subsequently reelected 17 times.\n\nHis first cabinet post was as Minister of Education in the first Okuma Shigenobu administration of 1898, and as Minister of Posts and Communications in the second Yamamoto Gonnohyoe administration.\n\nHe was a leading figure in the Shimpoto (Progressive Party), the Kenseito (Constitutional Party), and the Rikken Kokuminto (Constitutional Nationalist Party), which eventually toppled the government of Katsura Taro in 1913."
