        "text": "On May 14, 1932, film icon Charlie Chaplin arrived in Japan as a guest of then-Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi. The next day, he went with the Prime Minister's son to watch a sumo match.\n\nOn that same day, May 15th, Inukai was assassinated by junior Naval officers in a move that ended civilian control over the Imperial Japanese government.\n\nAs it turns out, however, the original assassination plot had included Chaplin as an additional target, meant to rile the UK and US up.\n\nhttps://books.google.co.in/books?id=YTS8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA229#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nNow, say Chaplin decides against going to see the sumo match, is in the Inukai's vicinity like the assassins expected, and is thus shot as well. What would the exact fallout of the attack be, cinematically and politically?\n\nThis very event happens in my own timeline!\n\nFor Chaplin, I unfortunately think that his reputation takes a bit of a hit due to an earlier death. He had already directed some great movies, but with perhaps his two greatest films, Modern Times and The Great Dictator, not being made he would be more obscure to modern audiences.\n\nThe killing of the most famous movie star on earth would cause international outrage. Not enough to go to war, but other countries would take the Japanese military more seriously than they did in OTL.\n\nChaplinâ€™s killers would represent a rival faction of the Japanese military than the ones who eventually took over in OTL and lead us to World War Two. Assuming the coup is successful, and it might fail even with Charlie dead, there would be very interesting butterflies to the military philosophy of Imperial Japan. No doubt they would still be aggressive, racist, and ultranationalist, but the outcome would change. Perhaps a poorer leadership in the years following the coup makes them weaker on the world stage?"
