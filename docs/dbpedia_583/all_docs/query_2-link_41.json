        "text": "Watching a TV docu on odd events in history, I found this intriguing piece of Japanese history\n\nCharles Chaplin traveled to Japan invited by some Japanese authorities, he was welcomed at his arrival by a legion of otaku all dressed in The Tramp custome\n\nWhile being there and before meeting with the prime minister Inuki Tsuyoshi,\n\nthe so called League of the Blood, a far right organization, attempted killing him on three occasions, one more comical after the other. In the third one, a man approached him with the intention of showing his collection of Japanese ....ography. Then, offended by the negative of Chaplin to such action, the man and a gang of League of Blood colleagues approached him in a bar; Chaplin put them back simulating having a gun on his pocket. The idea of the fanatical League of the Blood, was killing Chaplin to start a conflict with the US\n\nChaplin then met the ministers that had invited him, what they expected to improve the international opinion on Japan after the incidents in Manchuria, and he was invited to a great official reception. But Chaplin contacted Tsuyoshi and told him he prefered to watch a Sumo wrestling, the Prime Minister acepted and told Chaplin to take his son with him to the event.\n\nInukai Tsuyoshi was killed that night by some far right Navy's cadets, some of then associated with the League of the Blood\n\nInukai said: hanaseba wakaru = If I could speak, you would understand\n\nThe young cadets replied before shooting: mondō muyō = dialogue is useless\n\nDuring their trial, the judge received a petition to free them signed by 250,000 people through Japan, their signs were written with their own blood\n\n(Picture of another trial of this group)\n\nThis incident seem to be just one in the convulse Japan of the interwar period. I wonder if the infamous members of League of the Blood achieved their objetives at the end"
