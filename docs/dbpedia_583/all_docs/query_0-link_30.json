        "text": "The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on July 13, 2024, is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat of political violence . This incident adds to the long history of attacks on presidents and political leaders in the United States and globally.\n\nPicture credit: nftnow\n\nIn the US, the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, President James Garfield in 1881, and President William McKinley in 1901 led to the establishment of the Secret Service to protect presidents.\n\nThe assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 further heightened security measures. More recent attempts include those on President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and President Gerald Ford in 1975, both of which were foiled by the Secret Service.\n\nThe assassination of JFK was a pivotal moment that altered the trajectory of history. Kennedy's death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald led to a period of national mourning and uncertainty in the US, and some argue it derailed the civil rights movement and the country's involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nHowever, political violence is not unique to the US.\n\nHistorically, political violence has affected leaders worldwide. For instance, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria is thought to have been the trigger that started World War 1 -- a devastating global conflict that reshaped the political and social landscape of Europe and the world, leading to the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian, German, Russian, and Ottoman empires.\n\nHere is a list of 200 world leaders that were either assassinated or survived an assassination bid:\n\nAncient World (Before 500 CE)\n\n1.
