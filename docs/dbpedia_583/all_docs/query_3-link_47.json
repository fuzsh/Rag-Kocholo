May be incomplete or contain other coding.\n\nThe Autobiography of Ozaki Yukio:\n\nThe Struggle for Constitutional Government in Japan\n\nTranslated by Fujiko Hara\n\nWith a foreword by Marius B. Jansen\n\nChapter 1\n\nTHE BIRTH OF CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT IN JAPAN\n\nIN SETTING OUT these recollections of Japanese constitutional government, it is not my intention to write an academic study. There are enough scholars for that. This is to be a personal memoir. I shall tell the story of constitutional government in Japan through my own experience, how it germinated and evolved, where it is today, and where it should be going.\n\nEver since the Movement for Freedom and Peoples Rights (jiyuminkenundo) was launched in the first years of the Meiji era, I never stopped working to promote the development of constitutional government in Japan. From the very first assembly of the newly founded national parliament, the Diet, in 1890, I have held a seat in the House of Representatives without a break. My entire life has been dedicated to the development of constitutional government. These memoirs, therefore, should be instructive in some degree for people today as well as for later historians. It was with the establishment of the Progressive Party (Kaishinto) under Okuma Shigenobu in 1882, that I first became directly involved in the mainstream of Japanese constitutional government. However, I would like to begin by briefly outlining the circumstances of my birth and the development of constitutional government in Japan prior to that date.\n\nSON OF A SAMURAI LOYALIST\n\nI was born in the Sagami hills, in a village by the name of Matano in the county of Tsukui.1 Here, the pure streams that gushed and trickled from the green Musa-shino, Kai, and Sagami mountains gathered into the Sagami river, famous for its ayu trout fishing. This makes it sound rather idyllic, but in reality it was an unremarkable and remote place where ones dreams would be trapped in the skirts of the pressing hills. My family members were apparently long-term residents of Matano, and the Buddhist mortuary tablets and graves of successive generations of my ancestors are to be found in the Shosenji temple in Osawa, about one ri [2.44 miles] away. We are descended from Ozaki Kamon-no-kami Yukinaga, an important official in the pre-Tokugawa government. In Matano one can still see what remains of Fuukumaden Castle, where he is believed to have lived, and below the castle ruins there is a field by the name of Ozaki. Nothing, however, is known about what he did or where he came from. The mortuary tablets at Shosenji suggest that he died in 1622 and was followed by his wife in 1628, but apart from this there is not a single record pertaining to him. The year 1622 came toward the very end of the reign of the second Tokugawa shogun, and the third shogun, Iemitsu, acceded the following year. The shogunate was thus still only newly established, and it may have been the case that my ancestor retired to Matano to live a secluded life after having fallen into disfavor for rebelling against the Toku-gawa. In any event, the wording on his mortuary tablet indicates that he was a man of considerable status, although Fuukumaden Castle can only have been a modest structure on the top of the hill, nothing like what would ordinarily be thought of as a castle.2 The area is on the border of the Kai and Sagami districts, where there had been frequent warfare between the Hojo and Takeda families, and so it may have been that a watchtower of some sort was built there. Either way, it certainly is a tale shrouded in mystery.\n\nWhen I was about three years old a fire destroyed our home and everything in it, including all the family records. Later I learned from books published in the Tokugawa era that the Ozakis were an old family. Beyond that, however, I could discover nothing more about my ancestry. I hold no particular sentiment regarding the provenance of my family, and it matters little to me whether we are descended from apes or men. In this sense, I am not at all bothered by our lack of a family tree. I was aware, though, that my family was given special treatment in the village, and I do recall that my parents treated ordinary people in the village as if they were their retainers.\n\nI was born in November 1859.3 This was the year of the notorious Ansei Purge, which was followed the next year by the assassination of the Shoguns Chief Minister, Ii Naosuke, outside of the Sakurada-mon gates. Six years earlier Commodore Perry had sailed his black ships into Uraga Bay, and ten years more would bring the Meiji Restoration. It was thus a time in which the crises of the late Edo period were building to a climax.\n\nMy father, Yukimasa, had been adopted into a family from the Mineo family of Sanda village in Hachioji. I was his first son. It was difficult for a small child to understand what was happening at the time, but riding the tide of history, my father seems to have become involved with loyalist activists from an early stage, and he travelled the country to promote their cause. He was hardly ever home when I was a child. I vaguely remember the day when we received news of his death. We were soon informed that the report had been incorrect, but it seems that at the time of the Restoration he led a troop of Koshu ronin [masterless samurai] called the Dan-kin-tai, which had joined Itagaki Taisukes expeditionary army when it set out to subdue the recalcitrant Aizu clan in the Restoration War of 1868. I never heard much about the details.\n\nOne of the interesting men with whom father was closely associated in those days was Ochiai Naosuke. He was both a very good friend and a relative of my fathers. He came from a village called Komagino, across the river from Matano, in the Bushu country at the foot of the Takao mountains. From early childhood Ochiai had been trained in the Motoori and Hirata schools and was an ardent loyalist. He was the father by adoption of Ochiai Naobumi, a well-known literary figure in the Meiji period.\n\nOchiai Naosuke was a resourceful and determined man. On a number of occasions he conspired to bring down the Tokugawa shogunate, at one point with Kiyokawa Hachiro , and at another with Fujimoto Tesseki. In 1867 he had been plotting with the Satsuma forces to incite an insurrection in Edo, but before any of these plans could achieve their purpose he was found out by the shogunate, and forced to flee. Chased by a warship with orders to take his life, he managed to escape safely to Satsuma, where he linked up with Saigo Takamori and Iwakura Tomomi and went on to render meritorious service in the campaign to restore Imperial rule.\n\nWith my father away like this, our household was very poor, and we lived a truly lonely existence up in those mountains. Around us there were a number of families with the surname Wako , who were all said to be descended from former retainers of my family. Yet, by this point, as a result of the mysterious fire, our home had been completely destroyed and only the godown was left standing. In this situation and with father absent, the Ozaki household teetered on the brink of extinction and came to know utter poverty. There was only my mother and myself, and although we had some relatives, they lived far away and were of no help to us.\n\nTo make matters worse, I did not have a strong constitution as a child. From infancy I was tormented every day by headaches. And, as if this were not enough, my entire body was plagued by itchy boils. My childhood was quite miserable. My mother apparently worried less about educating me than keeping me alive. Later I shared her attention with my brother and sister, but in my early childhood my health and well-being were her sole concern.\n\nAs for my education, there were no schools or teachers in the mountain areas in pre-modern Japan. I recall on those rare occasions when father was home that he taught me verses from an anthology of Tang poems. Even now I can remember thinking to myself at the time how difficult and incomprehensible scholarship was! This is of course understandable, for imagine the shock it would cause today if first-year elementary school textbooks began with Tang poetry. In any case, I received only the roughest of educations. I was taught Chinese characters by my parents but never had to practice writing very much. This was how I spent my childhood, without any proper education, in a mountain village forgotten by the world.\n\nmay have been both of vanity and as an expedient to avoid complications in official documents. Much later, he gave his real age and often wrote it in the calligraphy he produced.\n\nEventually the Tokugawa shogunate fell and Imperial rule was restored. My father, like the other samurai loyalists who had been constantly on the move in their struggle to bring this about, now found himself in the employ of the Meiji government. In the first year of the new Meiji era he became a civil servant and was assigned to Tokyo. I was ten years old by the Japanese way of counting.\n\nTHE FIVE ARTICLES OF THE CHARTER OATH\n\nIn that same first year of Meiji that I accompanied my father to Tokyo, a solemn ceremony to proclaim the Charter Oath took place in Kyoto.4 On April 6, in the Hall of State Ceremonies, Emperor Meiji read out the following covenant before the gods of heaven and earth:\n\n1. Deliberative assemblies shall be widely established and all matters decided by public discussion.\n\n2. All classes, high and low, shall unite in vigorously carrying out the administration of affairs of state.\n\n3. The common people, no less than the civil and military officials, shall each be allowed to pursue his own calling so that there may be no discontent.\n\n4. Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything based upon the just laws of Nature.\n\n5. Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of imperial rule.5\n\nThese five articles of the Charter Oath laid the foundation for constitutional government. Following the wishes of his forefathers, Emperor Meiji had graciously enunciated the basic principles of the nation and in so doing had clearly defined the noble objective of building a constitutional government in a most unprecedented manner. On that same day, Saigo Takamori and Katsu Kaishu had been in Edo (present-day Tokyo) to negotiate the surrender and evacuation of Edo Castle. My young heart filled with emotion to think that on that historic day the course of national policy had been given to posterity by the emperor himself.\n\nNeedless to say, the ten-year-old boy that I was then hardly appreciated the historical significance of the Charter Oath. Later, when I became involved in the movement for constitutional government, words could not express the strength we were able to draw from the covenant. It meant more to us than having a million allies. A clear national policy had been set. Devoting our energies to the cause of constitutional government was to obey the Imperial will and serve the empire. The belief that anyone who obstructed the realization of a constitutional government was a traitor to the people and an enemy of the throne gave us courage to stake our lives on the cause.\n\nWith the oath the emperor also released a letter declaring his intention to promote the welfare and honor of the nation. In it he stated: At this time of national renewal, if any person shall be unable to realize his full potential it shall be deemed Our own failure. Therefore, we are conscious of Our duty to fulfill our mission and be worthy of Our people, as we hold ourselves accountable for the achievement of Our objectives, being the first to face adversity, following faithfully the wisdom of the sages, and promoting good administration throughout the land. He further encouraged the people: You shall enjoy happiness in life by fulfilling our wishes, elevating each other and setting aside personal interest for the public good. Assist us in Our enterprise, defend the integrity of Our divine land, and thus console the spirits of Our Imperial ancestors. Who would not be moved in his heart and stirred to great deeds by these words? As loyal subjects we had no choice but to follow the Imperial will and dedicate ourselves body and soul to achieving true constitutional government.\n\nIts fundamental principle, as surely as the sun is in the sky, was established by the first article of the Charter Oath: Deliberative assemblies shall be widely established and all matters decided by public discussion. The other four articles also concerned themselves with constitutional government.\n\nArticle 2 states: All classes, high and low, shall unite in vigorously carrying out the administration of affairs of state. Communicating the minds of the leaders to the people and theirs to those who lead them is the essence of constitutional government. A true debate can only be had if there is effective communication.\n\nArticle 3 states: The common people, no less than the civil and military offi-cials, shall each be allowed to pursue his own calling so that there may be no discontent. In the despotic feudal age the bureaucracy and military did not live up to their mandate and citizens were unable to fulfill their aspirations so that in the end they no longer supported the government of the shogun. The rest can be easily imagined.\n\nArticle 4 states: Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything based upon the just laws of Nature. Of all the transgressions of the autocratic government that had but lately been overthrown, the worst was that the lives of the common people were at the mercy of the samurai. People were treated like animals and their rights to life and property ignored. To treat humans as they ought to be treated was the foundation of constitutional government as well as the path of justice.\n\nArticle 5 states: Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of Imperial rule. The political history of civilized countries teaches us that constitutional government is the supreme form of political institution. With such a government in place, love of ones country and loyalty to the emperor would join to promote the highest good for our land.\n\nThe Five Articles of the Charter Oath laid the foundations of Japans constitutional government. The challenge lay in building a fitting edifice on this sure foundation. This was a grand venture that the people of Japan should undertake together in compliance with the Imperial will. My own life was totally given to this momentous purpose. I felt immense pride in the fact that the first page of the history of constitutional government in Japan was graced with the emperors inexpressibly grand oath.\n\nTHE NEW MEIJI GOVERNMENT\n\nAfter coming to Tokyo with my father in the first year of Meiji we lived for some time with the Yasuokas at their Surugadai residence. A loyalist, Yasuoka Yoshitaka was a country samurai from Nakamura village in the county of Hata in Tosa domain (todays Kochi Prefecture). He was trained in the Hioki school of archery and the Otsubo school of horsemanship. He had also practiced the martial arts with sword and spear under Hijikata Kenkichi and studied artillery with Tadokoro Sayoji. In addition to these skills, he was well versed in literature as a distinguished student of Kamei Tetsutaro of Chikuzen (northern Kyushu). He was, in short, a man of both martial and literary excellence. His outstanding background stood him in good stead when he joined the Restoration forces in the campaign to subdue the eastern clans. After the Restoration he was chosen to occupy important government positions, first as an official in the judiciary (danjodai daichu ) and then the Deliberative Assembly (shugiin hankan) and the Ministry of Civil Affairs (minbu shokyoku). My father served as a government official under Yasuoka for about ten years.\n\nUntil I came to Tokyo I had hardly received any education to speak of. Now I studied the Confucian Analects and the teachings of Mencius and sat in on Mr. Yasuokas lectures on the Seven Books of Classical Chinese. Among my classmates were Kono Toshikama, Obata Mine, and Otsuka Narumi, who were as old as my parents. After two years or so we moved to Bancho (Chiyoda-ku) and I continued my study of the classics at Hirata Academy. My teacher there, Mr. Hirata, was the son of the famous kokugaku scholar Hirata Atsutane, and I seem to recall that he had also presented lectures to Emperor Meiji. Among my memories of the Hirata Academy were three or four occasions in which I blacked out while playing with my friends, turned deathly pale, and fell senseless to the ground. Perhaps because of this unusual tendency I came to develop certain views, if not firm convictions, about the soul.\n\nThe most disagreeable part of my journey to school each day was the harassment I received from boys who threw stones and shouted insults at me. This experience gave me an unfortunate sense that all strangers were my born enemies. I could not understand why I should be the target of abuse and stone-throwing when other boys seemed perfectly able to escape such ordeals. Perhaps there was something about me that encouraged them to pick on me. Had I been physically strong I would certainly have taken them on, but since I was timid anyway I knew better than to fight. I did not flinch from this wretched treatment but simply endured it in silence as I made my way with a heavy heart each day. This tendency to be disliked by others continued for a long time after this. In my mid-teens I was called a snob and accused of being affected, and this persisted even when I was thirty. I cannot exaggerate how much I suffered because of whatever it was in me that made me so disliked. I suspect that I am not free from it even today, but after forty it has bothered me less.\n\nIn the meantime, the new Meiji government gradually strengthened its foundations. At first it seemed to me that the government took the will of the people seriously, respecting the intention of the Five Articles of the Charter Oath and attempting to develop a system of governing based on public debate. One of the reasons for the downfall of the Tokugawa shogunate was that it had lost the support of the people. The obstinate feudal system presented an obstacle to the recruitment of bright young men into the service of the central government. The government of the shogun and the life of the people had become disconnected. Government officials had no way of fathoming the desires of the ordinary people, who in turn had no way of channeling their yearning for political reform. Officials were blind to the forces stirring beneath them. As rulers and ruled became increasingly alienated, the fall of the shogunate became inevitable. The new government of Meiji was painfully aware of this. This was what inspired the rediscovery of the ancient device of appointing a Dajokan, or Council of State, and filling it with princes, aristocrats, loyalist clan chiefs, and samurai.6 The government also established a new system to recruit able people from the rank and file. Men known as choshi were recruited from among the best of the clansmen and the public, and assigned as councilors or directors in the government departments. They were normally to serve a term of four years. It was decided, however, that the most meritorious of them might serve for an extended period to be decided by public discussion.\n\nThere was no particular limit to the number of those who would be recruited as choshi. Naturally, however, there was a limit to the number of posts to be filled at councilor and other senior levels. To ensure that a greater number of capable men could be recruited, a second, parallel system was instituted. This second type of recruit, known as koshi, was equivalent to the present-day elected representatives. The head of a clan was invited to pick the brightest of his clansmen, and they then served in a Lower Assembly (kagijisho). It was decided that major clans would appoint three such men, middle-sized clans two, and small clans one. When it was established, it was stated that this Lower Assembly was to be an office for public debate and for gauging public opinion in the realm. This was the first time that the terms public debate and public opinion (kogi yoron) had found their way into official documents. In addition to the Lower Assembly, the koshi also had their own Policy Office (koshi taisakusho), through which they could make policy recommendations to the government and be asked by the government for their views on specific proposals.\n\nIn some respects then, this Lower Assembly where representatives of the clans debated could be compared to the later House of Representatives. Naturally, the organization was underdeveloped and its authority extremely limited. Nonetheless it was a sure step toward constitutional government insofar as it recruited from among the people wise men who would devote themselves to national business, allowing them to engage in public debate and play an effective, if qualified, role in government. This is impressive evidence of the expeditious manner in which the Meiji government promoted public debate and opened its ears to public opinion.\n\nThe institutions of choshi and koshi were established in February of the first year of Meiji, on the eve of the promulgation of the Five Articles of the Charter Oath. In April of that year, the government reintroduced the ancient Dajokan system, while also instituting a separation of legislative, administrative, and judicial functions for the first time. Within the Dajokan, departments were established for legislative and administrative matters, and for religious, accounting, military, foreign affairs, and the judicial system. Legislative officials represented the legislature, criminal judges oversaw judicial affairs, and the remaining five offices constituted the administrative branch.\n\nMembers of the legislature were divided into two tiers. The upper tier was composed of persons holding the positions of senior councilor (gijo) and councilor (sanyo), while the lower tier accommodated the koshi.7 Thus, what was now created was a bicameral system in which the upper tier was analogous to a House of Lords while the lower served as a House of Commons. This was not, however, a bicameral system in the evolved sense because the authority of the two houses was unequal, with the lower house expected merely to deliberate if and when it was required by the upper house.\n\nIt can be seen then that through the appointment of recruits from each domain, the Meiji government sought to encourage broad public debate and deliberation. In fact, however, often times the recruits would aimlessly pursue useless debates, and they were criticized as being incapable of dealing with the practical business of government. At this point, the Meiji government decided that there was a pressing need to first unify the debates going on in each of the domains, and to promote mutual understanding between upper and lower elements of society. A new system of domanial administration was thus settled upon, with executive, administrative, and deliberative officials appointed to serve as a link between the various regions and the central government. In other words, within each domain the deliberative officials were to make sure the policies of the central government were thoroughly understood, while at the same time, within the central government, they served as members of a Deliberative Assembly (kogisho), presenting the issues that were of particular concern in their domain. This Deliberative Assembly was the lower chamber of the governments legislature, the Gijokan, and the structure described here was more or less in place by the early months of 1869.\n\nIn the spring of the same year, an Ombudsmans Office (taisho-kyoku) was set up in Tokyo to collect petitions from all across the realm. Since there was inevitably a limit to the number of choshi, koshi, and members of the Deliberative Assembly, this marked yet another attempt to gain access to public opinion.\n\nTowards the middle of 1869, canvassing (tohyo kosen) for various important public offices took place. As a result, Sanjo Sanetomi was selected as chief minister (hosho), and Iwakura Tomomi, Tokudaiji Sanenori, and Nabeshima Naomasa were selected as the three senior councilors. Higashikuze Michinobu, Kido Taka-yoshi, Okubo Toshimichi, Goto Shojiro, Soejima Taneomi, and Itagaki Taisuke were elected councilors. The successful candidates were all predictable winners. What was remarkable was that an attempt had actually been made by the Meiji government to appoint government officials through public elections. However, public participation in the election of government officials was discontinued after this first attempt.\n\nA few months later, another major reform of the Dajokan was undertaken, and the legislative and executive functions that had been clearly separated earlier were united once more. The upper and lower tiers of the legislative organ were also abolished. The government, however, still recognized the need for an organ in which public opinion could be aired, and in their place a National Assembly (shugi-in) was established. It provided for debate by officials appointed from among senior figures representing the various regions of the country.\n\nThis development was still a variation of the constitutional system, and one could say that it marked yet another step toward the establishment of proper constitutional government. This much is clear from the official duties assigned to the National Assembly in its rules: The Assembly shall be for the wide ranging consultation of public opinion and, respecting the Imperial will which laid the foundations of national government, it will be a place where the energies of the multitude are harnessed. Thus, it is necessary that proceedings will show respect for the Imperial rescript, be united in purpose with the Dajokan, take the fundamentals of government to heart, judiciously address matters which arise, and act to ensure that unity within the country is not compromised. In the latter part of 1869, the Emperor Meiji paid a visit to the National Assembly and observed a session attended by the chief minister, Sanjo Sanetomi, the three senior councilors, Iwakura, Tokudaiji, and Nabeshima, and other lords and councilors. Originally, the plan had been for the emperor to receive all of the members of the assembly in a single audience, but this was not possible due to the lack of adequate space, and each member was presented with a gift from the emperor in compensation.\n\nOne can see then how zealous the emperor Meiji was in his efforts to conduct the government of the people with the people.8 We can also see that at this point the new Meiji government was striving sincerely for the development of government based on public debate, and thus remained faithful to the first article of the Charter Oath: Deliberative assemblies shall be widely established and all matters decided by public discussion. The attitude of the Meiji government changed abruptly, however, with the introduction of the haihan-chiken (abolishing clans and establishing prefectures) policy in 1871.\n\nI WITNESS TORTURE AND EXECUTIONS\n\nWith the inception of haihan-chiken and the setting up of new administrative districts in place of the former feudal fiefdoms, Yasuoka Yoshitaka was appointed Governor (daisanji) of Takasaki Prefecture. My father accompanied him.\n\nThe abolition of the clans was the most sweeping of all the changes that had occurred since the Restoration of Imperial rule. For all practical purposes it dealt a death blow to the feudal system in Japan. It is understandable then that there was an atmosphere of trepidation throughout Japan at this time. The Joshu region (where Takasaki Prefecture was located) was, however, a particularly rough place, and even though I was only a child I remember constantly hearing of rowdy local samurai making trouble by attacking the prefectural office that the Meiji government had established, or killing government officials. I expect that it was because Yasuoka was such an accomplished man, with both literary and military training, that he had been dispatched to this area to quell the disturbances.\n\nMy own recollections of this period include witnessing torture, beheadings, and ritual suicides (seppuku). Since administrative and judicial powers were no longer separate, my father was often required to serve as a judge in addition to carrying out his responsibilities for school affairs. When he conducted torture himself, he would call me to watch secretly from behind a sliding screen. When criminals were to be executed he would take me, together with the students from school, to the scene of the beheading. In Tokyo too the bodies of people who had been executed or who had disemboweled themselves were sometimes to be seen lying out in the streets, and I remember my father urging me to look at them. Why should my father have wanted me to see such things? I suspect he was trying to cure my timidity by shocking me with these gruesome scenes, but the result was quite the opposite. It not only failed to cure me of the cowardice I was born with, but every time I was taken to a beheading I felt terribly sick. I barely glanced at the disemboweled bodies I was told to look at. My classmates, however, proved more stout-hearted, some even stirring the spilled bowels with a stick. Such boys were praised later while I was harshly scolded. At times when we saw many heads roll and I smelled the stench of blood I could hardly eat my lunch. I was reproved for being a coward. What would boys living under a democratic government today feel to see such horrors? Disregard for human life and property was a vice inherited from the despotic feudal age. It is at the very core of the principles that inspire constitutional government to destroy such appalling customs and treat people as human beings. I did not, of course, understand such things as a boy, but I hated the bloodcurdling experience of having to watch torture and beheadings.\n\nIn Takasaki I was enrolled for the first time in a school and learned English. The head English teacher was Koizumi Atsushi, who enjoyed a high reputation for his command of the language.\n\nI have since lost contact with most of my schoolmates, but one of them was Arai Ryoichiro, who was later to become active in US-Japan relations as an exporter of silk yarn.9 Arai was a handsome boy, while I was as ugly as sin. My teeth protruded and my nostrils opened to the sky. People made fun of me and told me to hold my head down so the rain would not go up my nose. My mother was much pained by this. I resolved to try hard to do something about my unsightly features, and with Arai as my model, I was able to improve greatly the way I looked.\n\nWith the disturbances in Takasaki successfully suppressed, Yasuoka was transferred to Ise, another area racked by disorder. Since father was again transferred with him, we all moved to Doai Prefecture (part of todays Mie Prefecture). This was the beginning of my lifelong relationship with Ise.\n\nAt the time of the transfer, my father, mainly in consideration of my weak constitution, requested a months leave to take his family to the Kusatsu hot springs. Some time during the thirty days we spent there I was completely freed of my persistent headaches. My skin improved too. I recall with horror the famous thermal bath. It has since become much more respectable, but in those days it was extremely filthy, and consisted only of a roof over the crowded bathers, among whom were many with advanced cases of syphilis and lepers with deformed limbs and no noses. Told that only cowards shied away from taking these renowned waters, I gritted my teeth and shared the bath with them a couple of times, fervently hoping that I would escape infection.\n\nThe Doai prefectural office was in Yamada city in Ise district. Mie Prefecture with which Doai was later merged had its office, as I recall, in Tsu. In Yamada there was a library called Miyazaki Bunko near the Outer Shrine of Ise. Attached to the library was an English school, and Mr. Koizumi from the school in Takasaki was invited to join the teaching staff. Some of my friends from this school, such as Motoba Chu and Oi Saitaro , went on to earn doctoral degrees at Kogakuryo; (now Tokyo University) and make important contributions to the country in their own fields.\n\nFather took me to see beheadings in Ise as well. Young as I was, I soon discovered that there was a considerable difference between criminals here and those in Takasaki. On the way to the execution ground in Takasaki the condemned men often hummed a tune. Some even dared to taunt their executioners, admonishing them to take extra care with their sword, and warning them that their necks had muscles of iron so that no half-hearted cut would do the job. The ultimate pride of an executioner was to sever the head but leave it dangling by a single piece of skin. This was no easy task, and even a veteran might miss after being harassed in this way. In contrast to those in Takasaki, most of the victims I saw at Ise were so paralyzed with fear that they could barely walk, let alone hum a tune. Indeed, they already appeared half-dead before they even reached the execution ground. I do not know whether their abject appearance was to be accounted for by the treatment they had suffered in prison, or whether the people themselves were of a different grade: Ise men were submissive and weak, while those from Jo shu were inheritors of the areas proud tradition of popular rebelliousness. In any case, whatever the cause, there seemed to me a great deal of difference between the two groups of men in their last hour.\n\nAfter we had been at Ise for a year or so, I began to yearn to study in Tokyo. There were two reasons for this. Accompanying my father in the course of his peripatetic career as a teacher and low-ranking local government official, I had become infatuated with the widespread fame of a school in Tokyo called Keio Gijuku. Keio Gijuku was considered to be the best in Japan, enjoying a far higher reputation than any government school. I thought that if I was to pursue my education then I should have the best the country could offer. The other reason I wished to go to Tokyo was that as much as I enjoyed being with my parents I also longed to be independent. I very much resented their well-intentioned interference and I heartily wished to escape from it. I begged my father to let me go, and at last received his permission in the summer of 1874. With my ten-year-old brother I left for Tokyo to enroll at Keio Gijuku. I was sixteen.\n\nSo it was that I came to attend Keio Gijuku, which was considered to be in the forefront of liberal democratic ideas in the early Meiji years. It was an event that had a large impact on my life. At this point it will be appropriate to resume the story of the nations political development following the abolition of the domains and the impact it had on the evolution of constitutional government in Japan.\n\nTHE GENESIS OF CLAN CLIQUE GOVERNMENT\n\nWhile the Tokugawa shogunate itself fell with the Meiji Restoration, the three hundred or so regional clans at first continued to rule their own areas of the country as they had always done. This meant that the Restoration of Imperial Rule was a reform in name only, with the mechanisms of feudal government essentially unaffected. Consequently, a second convulsion, to which I have already alluded, soon took place. Called haihan chiken, it would involve the abolition of feudal fiefs and the establishment of new administrative districts known as ken or prefectures. The abolition of the clans proved to be a formidable undertaking.\n\nWhen the Tokugawa family returned their power to the throne, it was argued that they should also return its land and people. By the same argument it was held that other clans should do the same, return their fiefdoms and privileges as local rulers, so that all the lands and peoples of Japan might be unified under their emperor. There could be no question that this was the right thing to do. Nonetheless it was not done, since the main forces responsible for the Meiji Restoration were the major clans of Satsuma, Choshu, Tosa, and Hizen. Only when the haihan chiken was carried out in the latter months of 1871 did the foundations of the feudal system finally collapse.\n\nThe haihan chiken was a bold decision on the part of the Meiji government, and it resulted in two major changes affecting the work of laying foundations for constitutional government in Japan. One was the blatant backsliding on the governments part regarding its commitment to constitutional rule. The other was that the ambitions of the Satsuma, Choshu, Tosa and Hizen clans to usurp the powers of government were no longer covert.\n\nWith the introduction of haihan chiken, a major reform took place in the structure of the central government involving the establishment of three new boards (center, left, and right). Ministries were administratively distinct from the three boards as branches of the Dajokan. The Central Board with the prime minister and other ministers advising the emperor and conducting all the affairs of state, looked very much like todays cabinet. Ministers of the right and the left were directly responsible to the prime minister. There was no restriction on the number of councilors of state (sangi) appointed to serve the administration and assist the three ministers. Thus the prime minister, the ministers of the left and the right, and the councilors were the principal officials advising the emperor and wielding the actual power of the government. The Left Board was where members of parliament enacted law, with a speaker assisted by a councilor. The Right Board was where heads of ministries and their deputies discussed administrative business. For the sake of appearances, the establishment and abolition of rules and regulations was officially to be done within the Left Board after public deliberation. On the surface, therefore, it seemed that the Left Board had the right to legislate; however, in reality the authority of the so-called legislature to participate in the process of legislation was limited to the ability to seek the judgment of the Central Board. Actual authority to adopt or disregard legislation thus resided solely in the Central Board. In short, legislative powers were all but absorbed by an omnipotent Central Board, relegating the legislature to the position of a mere bureau taking orders from above. As a matter of fact, when the rules for the Central Board were revised in 1873 it was clearly stated that legislative affairs (were) the prerogative of the Central Board. Its officials (should) deliberate on their merits and priority, reach consensus, and submit them to lower officials for implementation. Soon after this, the National Assembly, which had continued to maintain some semblance of its role as a bureau for consulting public opinion, was also abolished and merged into the Left Board. With this, the constitutional system that had been developing since the first year of Meiji disappeared completely.10 At the beginning, the new Meiji government had been disposed to respect public opinion and debate, but as its foundations firmed, especially when the transition from the old clan system to the new prefectural system went smoothly and it felt more assured of its own base, the government began to show less and less respect for public opinion. Even when institutions such as the National Assembly and the Ombudsmans Office (where petitions were received) had existed, the government had done no more than make a symbolic effort to listen to opinions emanating from the people and in practice left it up to the arbitrary discretion of the administrator to decide whether action would be taken. In this sense, these institutions had never been able to fulfill the promise of their names, and now that the Assembly had been formally abolished as a concomitant of the haihan chiken, the Japanese constitutional system had clearly begun to retrogress.\n\nIt is a truism of realpolitik that for those in power there is nothing more convenient than arbitrary despotism. Therefore, in countries where a constitutional system has but lately been established, it is tempting for the government to revert to autocratic rule and neglect public opinion as soon as it is confident of its foundations. As noted above, the second of the changes that followed the abolition of the feudal fiefdoms was the emergence of clan cliques as a dominant force on the surface of the political scene. The smooth implementation of the abolition of the fiefs itself was a result of the united support of the four most powerful clans; and, to go further, it was common knowledge that they were the main forces behind the collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate and the successful Restoration of Imperial Rule.\n\nAt this time, Okubo Toshimichi wrote that in judging the current balance of power, we see that Satsuma and Choshu have greater power than the court. The two, however, do not use their power to assist the court but rather each one stores up what they have for their own selves. Rather than advance, they retreat. This is why the court is feeble. At the time of the abolition of the fiefdoms the four major domains lent their weight to the cause of national integration, which boosted the strength of the central government. A not unintended corollary of this was that the influence of the clan cliques within the central government became unshakable.\n\nAs I have intimated, it was an unchallenged fact that already Satsuma, Choshu, Tosa, and Hizen had wielded real power within the Meiji government from the first days of the Restoration. In the beginning, however, they did not allow this to be too conspicuous, at least not at an official level. Thus, for example, all of the important offices at the Court, such as the fuku sosai, hosho , and hohitsu, were filled by court nobles and feudal lords, as were the important positions of minister of state (dajo daijin), minister of the left, minister of the right, nagon, and all of the headships of the various government departments. At the same time, samurai from the four clans were restricted to such posts as advisor to a ministry (sosai-kyoku komon), councilor to an administrative official (gyoseikan sanji), the deputy headships of various departments, or else prefectural governorships. In fact, the clansmen were hesitant even to take up the deputy headships of departments, and were content to hold the position of secretary (hanji), or lower. Following the reform of mid-1867, these samurai became eligible for appointment to the new position of councilor of state (sangi), but the nobility and feudal lords continued to head the ministries and agencies, and clansmen could not aspire to any post in government above that of their deputy.\n\nFollowing the institutional reform that was carried out at the same time as the haihan chiken, members of the four major clans began to infiltrate the political system and were even appointed as heads of ministries. At the same time, the court nobles and feudal lords were gradually eased out of the main offices of the central government, and thereafter did not hold important posts other than those of minister of state, ministers of the left and right, Nagon, and one or two others.\n\nIn the cabinet reshuffle that accompanied the haihan chiken, four councilors of state were appointed: Saigo Takamori (Satsuma), Kido Takayoshi (Choshu ), Ita-gaki Taisuke (Tosa), and Okuma Shigenobu (Hizen).11 Thus, each of the four big clans now had a representative through whom to consolidate their influence in the cabinet. After this, the number of councilors of state was gradually increased so that in the end all of the heads of ministries and agencies held this position. Moreover, they were all selected from Satsuma, Choshu , Tosa, and Hizen. Thus, the councilors of state came to include men such as Goto Shojiro of Tosa who was also the president of the left board (sain gicho ); Oki Takato , the education minister; Eto Shinpei, the justice minister; and Soejima Taneomi, the foreign minister, all of whom were from Hizen, and Okubo Toshimichi, the finance minister, who was from Satsuma. In this way the core of the government came to be occupied solely by representatives of the four clans, and their ambitions to conduct autocratic government with the aid of their cliques were now becoming obvious.\n\nPETITION FOR A POPULARLY ELECTED PARLIAMENT\n\nThe rupture that occurred within the cabinet over the proposed Korean expedition shook the basis of the Meiji government.12 The government was thrown into a panic. Opinion within the cabinet swung from one day to the next. It was impossible to know what its decision would be. When Saigo Takamori realized that his recommendations were not going to be acted upon, he thrust a letter of resignation at his colleagues and stormed back to his native town in Satsuma. Four of his sympathizersItagaki Taisuke, Goto Shojiro, Soejima Taneomi, and Eto Shin-peifollowed his example and quit their posts. Imperial Guard officers from Satsuma also resigned their commissions. The whole country, sensing imminent conflict, fell into a state of confusion.\n\nWith the resignation of the five councilors of state, the government was left without teeth. The cabinet was hastily reformed around Iwakura Tomomi and Okubo Toshimichi. Oki Takato added the ministry of justice to his responsibilities, Ito Hirobumi was made a councilor and minister of industry, the former vassal of the Tokugawa shogunate, Katsu Kaishu , was asked back as councilor and minister of the navy, and Terajima Munenori was also recalled as councilor and minister of foreign affairs. Shimazu Hisamitsu, the erstwhile lord of Satsuma, was appointed government advisor (naikaku komon), a new post that was created in an attempt to mend the damage which had been done in the crisis. Yet, the restlessness that resulted from the split over the ill-conceived Korean enterprise could not be paci-fied by these half-hearted, makeshift measures.\n\nSoon, insurrections broke out in various places in the Southwestern part of the country, first in Saga, then in Kumamoto, Akizuki, and Hagi, and finally in Kagoshima, where a major uprising took place in 1877.13 All these convulsions were rooted in the deep controversy that surrounded the proposed expedition to Korea, fomented by people discontented with the clan clique (hanbatsu) government and conspiring its overthrow.\n\nYet, the movement to do something about the evils of the Meiji government did not consist solely of persons who sought to do so with military force. There were also those who saw that at a fundamental level the problem with the government was that it was controlled exclusively by the clan cliques, and thus a movement now emerged that sought to eradicate the evils of clique government through the establishment of a genuine constitutional system and an approach to politics that was truly based upon the nations people. This was the Movement for Freedom and Peoples Rights (jiyu minken undo ). Thus, the upheavals created by the planned invasion of Korea unexpectedly provided a major opportunity to promote constitutional government in Japan.\n\nIt happened that just at this time Komuro Nobuo, Furusawa Tsujiro , and others had newly returned from abroad, where they had been much inspired by the development of democracy in western countries. They forcefully presented the advantages of the parliamentary system to their fellow intellectuals. Itagaki Taisuke, who was indignant over developments within the autocratic Meiji government, was deeply stirred by the report. On January 18, 1874, he submitted a recommendation to the Board of the Left requesting the establishment of a popularly elected parliament. The recommendation was co-signed by eight menfour councilors who had resigned earlier: Itagaki, Goto , Soejima, and Eto , together with Komuro Nobuo, Furusawa Uro , Yuri Kimimasa, and Okamoto Kenzaburo .14 It began:\n\nWhen we humbly reflect upon the quarter in which the governing power lies, we find that it is not in the Imperial House above, nor the people below, but in the officials alone. We do not deny that the officials revere the Imperial House, nor that they protect the people. Yet, the manifold decrees of the government appear in the morning and are changed in the evening, the administration is influenced by private considerations, rewards and punishments depend on personal favor or disfavor, the channel by which the people should communicate with the government is blocked, and they cannot state their grievances.\n\nAfter enumerating the inequities of the bureaucracy, the petition went on to declare:\n\nUnable to resist the promptings of our patriotic feelings, we have sought to devise a means of rescuing [the country] from danger. We find this means to consist in developing public discussion in the empire. The means of developing public discussion is the establishment of a council-chamber chosen by the people.\n\nIt continued:\n\nThe people whose duty it is to pay taxes to the government have the right of sharing in their governments affairs and of approving or condemning. Since this is a universally acknowledged principle, it is not necessary to waste words in discussing it\n\nDeclaring the right of the people to vote refuted every argument put forth by those who were of the opinion that it was too early for a parliament. The petition thus provided the following rejoinder to those who said Our people are wanting in culture and intelligence, and have not yet advanced into the region of enlightenment. It is too early yet to establish a council-chamber elected by the people:\n\nIf things really are as they say, then the way to give to the people culture and intelligence and to cause them to advance swiftly into the region of enlightenment is to establish a council-chamber chosen by the people. For in order to give our people culture and intelligence and to cause them to advance into the region of enlightenment, they must in the first place be induced to protect their rights, to respect and value themselves, and be inspired by a spirit of sympathy with the griefs and joys of the empire, which can only be done by giving them a voice in its concerns. It has never happened that under such circumstances the people have been content to remain in a backward condition or have been satisfied with their own want of culture and intelligence.\n\nTo those who argued that to establish a council-chamber at once would be simply to assemble all the blockheads in the empire, the petition dealt a crushing blow:\n\nWhat shocking self-conceit and arrogant contempt for the people this indicates! No doubt there are among the officials men who surpass others in intelligence and ingenuity, but how do they know that society does not contain men who surpass them in intelligence and knowledge? Whence it may be inferred that the people of the empire are not to be treated with such arrogant contempt. If again they deserve to be treated with arrogant contempt, are the officials themselves not a part of the nation, in which case they also are wanting in intelligence and culture?\n\nIt went on, sharpening its attack:\n\nBetween the arbitrary decisions of a few officials and the general opinion of the people, as ascertained by public discussion, where is the balance of wisdom or stupidity? We believe that the intelligence of the officials must have made progress as compared with what it was previous to the Restoration, for the intelligence and knowledge of human beings increase in proportion as they are exercised. Therefore to establish a council-chamber chosen by the people would promote the culture and intelligence of the people and cause them to advance rapidly into the region of enlightenment.\n\nIt was a well-reasoned line of argument. Finally, it urged the establishment of a strong and above all legitimate government:\n\nHow is the government to be made strong? By the peoples being of one mind The establishment of a council-chamber chosen by the people will create community of feeling between the government and the people, and they will unite into one body. Then and only then will the country become strong.\n\nWhen the petition was published in the daily news journal Nisshin shinjishi,15 public opinion was inflamed, and the pros and cons were debated throughout the nation. When I too read the petition while attending class at the English school in Yamada, I was jolted as if I had received an electric shock, and I felt that my course in life had been set. It was then that I resolved to become a politician.\n\nThe rupture over the Korean invasion fracas brought about two major changes in the political scene in Japan. First, one of the four pillars of the alliance that had supported the Meiji government collapsed, and with the complete disappearance of Tosa from the central government it in effect became a Satsuma-Cho shu operation. True, Okuma Shigenobu of Hizen and also Oki Takato remained in the cabinet to defend their ground, but they gradually succumbed to pressure from the clan cliques of Satsuma and Choshu . As I shall discuss further below, Okuma was eventually to resign during the political crisis of 1881, leaving the government both in name and in practice under the unchallenged control of Satsuma and Choshu .\n\nSecond, the controversy over Korea ironically provided the impetus for the eventual establishment of a constitutional government. Prior to this, voices had been heard among the people calling for democracy, but it was only after the petition for a popularly elected parliament that these isolated voices were converted into a mass movement throughout the nation.\n\nIt was a portentous coincidence for me that it was at this very time that I moved to Tokyo to take up my studies at Keio Gijuku , which was one of the centers of the movement for democracy. What sort of a place was Keio Gijuku ? Permit me to turn now to some personal reminiscences.\n\nAlthough it is called Keio , the school was in fact established in the fifth year of Ansei (1858), seven years before the beginning of the Keio era. It is, of course, the oldest existing institution of higher learning in Japan. In the social field it stood for the eradication of all the evils of the old system, while in the political arena it advocated the establishment of constitutional government.\n\nThere were two principal schools of political thought that inspired democratic ideals in Japan. One was the French school of liberty and equality, and the other was the English school of peoples rights.\n\nIt was the members of the French school who first rose against the autocracy of the Meiji government, proclaiming human rights and equality. Some compared the Japanese situation to that of pre-revolutionary France and argued that the means to redress the abuses of the government must be learned from the French revolutionary leaders. Among this group was Nakae Chomin, who opened a French school and taught political philosophy. He lectured on Jean-Jacques Rousseaus idea of the social contract, and taught basic political principles through publications such as his Seiri sodan. Excited by its theories of liberty and civil rights, hot-headed young people embraced the notion of a social contract, sang revolutionary songs, and turned increasingly to radical tactics. The later Liberal Party (Jiyuto ) belonged ideologically to the French school.\n\nBy contrast, those who were affiliated with the English school had a more realistic agenda. Rather than indulging uselessly in theory, they argued that the most effective way of extending freedom and peoples rights was to establish a pragmatic English-style parliamentary government. Among the educational institutions advocating this line of thinking were Seki Shinpachis Kyo ritsu Gakusha and Nakamura Masanaos Do jinsha; but Keio Gijuku was indisputably the leader among them. The later Progressive Party (Kaishinto ) drew its ideology mainly from this school of English thought.\n\nFukuzawa Yukichi, the founder and headmaster of Keio , had been a brilliant student at Ogata Ko ans Tekijuku school in Osaka.16 When the shogunate dispatched a warship to the United States in 1860, he was sent as an assistant to Kimura, Lord of Setsu, the governments naval magistrate (gunkan bugyo ). And when the shogunate sent a mission to Europe in 1862, he again went as a member of the delegation. His observations and experiences on these missions were compiled in his book, Conditions in the West (Seiyo jijo ) published in 1867. It was this book that for the first time made knowledge of western civilization and the situation in the outside world widely available in Japan. The whole nation, including men in government and opposition alike, all read the book.\n\nAt the time of the Restoration, the number of students at Keio , which had previously been around one hundred, dropped for a time to as few as eighteen.\n\nThe headmaster was not the least daunted by this, however, and indeed, it is said that on the day that the battle of Ueno was being fought he continued to instruct his eighteen students from a recently acquired economics text by an American named Wayland, as if nothing unusual was happening.17 Fukuzawa, as I have mentioned, had been abroad twice during the old re ´gime and was painfully aware that the waves of civilization were washing at the shores of Japan. It was not enough for the shogunate to return the government to the imperial court. The lives and values of the people had to be totally reconstructed if they were to be able to compete on equal terms with the Western countries. He believed that the evil traditions of the feudal era must be completely abolished. Without such sweeping reforms, he reasoned, a new civilization could not be built. He set himself to this task by means that were considered radical and eccentric by the standards of his day. He threw away his two swords, which were considered the soul of the samurai, wore his hair in a knot like a common man, wore an apron (as do merchants), and went about proudly calling himself commoner Yukichi of Edo (Tokyo). It was the custom then for married women to have their eyebrows shaved and their teeth blackened. To put an end to this barbaric practice, Fukuzawa published a story book called Deformed Girl (Katawa musume). It was a time when few people were willing to give their lives for the emperor, but samurai were expected to die for their lords. In public, Fukuzawa dared to call his lord, the Daimyo of Nakatsu, a dullard. At a time when the movement to restore imperial rule was flourishing and the name of Kusunoki was associated with heroism, he also likened the death of Lord Kusunoki at the battle of Minato-gawa to the beheading of a servant.18 There was no end to these daring acts of the master. What does not seem exceptional today could well have cost him his life then. On one occasion, in fact, Asabuki Eiji, a junior man from Fukuzawas home town, came to Edo on a secret mission to assassinate him. He lived every day with this ever-present threat.\n\nFukuzawa was perpetually misunderstood by his contemporaries. He not only failed to explain or apologize for his deed, for some reason he also had a strange inclination to downplay his achievements and flaunt behavior that was sure to be criticized. I once had the temerity to call him a false villain. I suspect that he was so disgusted by the many false heroes around him that out of disdain for them he played a reverse role. Some of his contemporaries considered him to be too interested in money, but the charge was completely unfounded. Some time around 1897 one of the clever young men at Keio Gijuku published a small book titled Money Worship (Haikin shu ).\n\nIt was simply a translation of an American booklet with a similar title, but without ever reading the book some people concluded that it somehow reflected the masters thought.\n\nFukuzawa was exceptionally versatile and resourceful, and he certainly had great ability in business matters. It would have been easy for him to make a fortune for himself had he wished to do so, but the fact was that he was almost totally indifferent to his own financial situation. He gave others ideas as to how they might make money, but for himself he was never interested. He exhorted his pupils to save well and spend well and he lived by the same maxim. He was also fond of saying that it was foolish to spend money without good reason. Yet, at the same time, I am sure that the amounts he gave to students, friends, and acquaintances, and to Koreans and Chinese seeking asylum in Japan must have been very large.\n\nHis contribution towards building a new civilization in Japan was enormous. He took the lead in advocating the promotion of sericulture, the construction of a national railway system, support for peoples rights legislation, the opening of parliament, the assertion of national power, the expansion of the navy, the improvement of the status of women, revision of the tax system, and the development of commerce and industry. He was the first to organize public speaking events and parliamentary-style debates, and enterprises such as the Maruzen foreign book store, the Meiji Life Insurance Company, various private banks, and the Jiji Shinpo newspaper were all projects of his, which he gave to former students to manage. The greatest of all his projects was, however, Keio Gijuku. A great builder must also be a great destroyer. Fukuzawa was a man of extraordinary accomplishments who had the greatness to destroy and to build at the same time. His prodigious contribution to the nation outshone that of all others who lived at the time of the Meiji Restoration. In my eyes he had no peer.\n\nHaving had the immense good fortune to study under this great man, I was nonetheless unable to fully comprehend his greatness until after his death, and constantly defied him while he lived. It is too late to regret my shameless behavior, which I can now see was like a small insect attacking the Imperial carriage. It was of course terribly thoughtless on my part, but it was due in part to the special circumstances of my first days at school in Tokyo. Let me explain.\n\nI PRETEND TO BE DUMB\n\nIt was the summer of 1874 when I sailed with my little brother from Ise to Yoko-hama by steamship (for there were no railways in those days) and arrived at last in Tokyo, where we both enrolled at Keio Gijuku. I was sixteen by the Japanese way of counting (though no more than fourteen the western way). My long-held dream of studying in Tokyo had come true, and I was happy, but at the same time extremely anxious. I supposed that a school as famous as Keio would have many excellent students. Believing with a heavy heart that it was my fate to be disliked, I dreaded the thought of being treated with disdain and rejected. From childhood I must have been extremely proud for I could not bear to be scorned. Worrying over how I could avoid being reproached or treated as a fool, I tossed sleeplessly in my bunk each night during our voyage from Ise. After mulling it over, I came up with a solutionI would play dumb. At the time I thought it was an extremely fine idea. My lack of education and ability would be exposed as soon as I opened my mouth. It followed that if I avoided saying anything then I would never betray my intellectual shortcomings, and no one could ever reproach me for them. I believe my classical Chinese education had something to do with this decision to live the life of a mute. It had taught me to despise speech and men of many words, and to revere the ancient art of writing. Since I was brought up in this Chinese way of thinking, it was not surprising that I looked down on speech and spoke very little. At the same time, however, even though I worked very hard at my writing and was bent upon becoming a good writer, I could never manage to be any better than second rate. In any event I grimly resolved not to say a word unless I had to.\n\nWhen I entered the school I was enrolled in the lowest possible class, just as I had expected. I was sixteen years old, and yet the class I was in was only one small step up from my ten-year-old brothers. This greatly increased my misgivings about being ill-treated, and I resolved more firmly than ever to remain silent. On arriving for the first day of school among my noisy classmates, whose ages ranged from thirteen down to ten, I kept my mouth closed tight as a clam. Once in the classroom, however, I quickly found that the other children were asking trivial questions that even I could answer. My apprehensions were somewhat eased when I realized that I actually knew more about some things than they. Of course, this was to be expected since I had been put in a class with much younger children. The teacher must have realized it too, and in less than a month I was promoted to a higher class. In those days the school held tests every month, and promotions and demotions were made on the basis of the results. In this way I was able to move up every month, and sometimes even twice in a single month. Before long I was in the highest grade but one. Nevertheless, I continued all this time to avoid speaking more than I could possibly help; in fact, if anything, I was more determined to keep it up than ever.\n\nA childs psychology is strange. At first I stayed silent because I was afraid of the other students, but as soon as I realized I was better than they were arrogance took over, so that now I would not speak to them because they were not worthy of my attention. Inevitably they called me smug and snobbish, and I made few friends during my schooldays. Some of my classmates at Keio whom I remember fondly were Hatano Shogoro, Inukai Tsuyoshi, Kato Seinosuke, Yoshida Karoku, Morita Bunzo , Miyake Yonekichi, Minoura Katsuto, and Fujita Mokichi. Yano Fumio is another, but he was in a senior class. Most of these in fact became my close friends after we left school, and while I was there it was really only Hatano, Miyake and Yoshida that I had relations with. Miyake was a boy of few words too, and he would spend the whole day sitting opposite me in my room without saying much. Strange as it may seem, this was what he enjoyed and why he came to visit me.\n\nI had never been a talkative boy at the best of times, and with my resolve to remain silent I became a total mute. While I was attending the school, which was located in Tokyos Mita district, I suffered from chronic beriberi and had to go to Hakone every year for treatment at a hot spa. The Fukuzumi Inn had long been frequented by Master Fukuzawa, and as a favor it gave special treatment to his pupils from Mita. Public hot springs were usually a good place to make friends, but even there I did not make any. I used to stay in Hakone for thirty or forty days at a time, but apart from asking the maid to make my bed or bring my meal I kept to myself and just read books in my room. Later I learned from a friend that the people at the inn were quite concerned about their eccentric guest. In those days I played dumb not just to my schoolmates but to everyone. I was a poor communicator anyway, but I only made myself worse.\n\nIn spite of my obsession, however, when it suited me to torment my teachers I could speak well enough. My behavior was so terrible that I burn with shame today and feel the need to confess to it in order to absolve my guilt. I remember thinking that if the teachers were promoting me when I behaved well, they would be all the more anxious to move me into the next class if I behaved badly! My strategy was to buy books that were more advanced than those that were being used in the class. Armed with superior knowledge, I would then deliberately ask questions in order to harass the teachers. To my great satisfaction, they were usually unable to answer. So they took it in turns to advance me to higher grades, partly to avoid embarrassment and partly because they overestimated my academic abilities. Not surprisingly, though I was not aware of the fact then, I was soon put on the blacklist.\n\nAmong the teachers at the school there were two who had answers to all my questions and took no nonsense from me. As I recall, they were Kadono Ikuno-shin, and Goto Makita. They were among the youngest of the teachers and I admired them greatly. In the end, I decided that being impressed was not enough, and I strove to emulate their intelligence and scholarship. It gave me quite a shock later when Mr. Kadono turned up as my rival for a seat in the House of Representatives. Kadono Ikunoshin was the elder brother of Kadono Ju kuro , who became a prominent businessman.\n\nKeio Gijuku had three dormitories to which one was allocated according to age. There was one for adults, another for teenagers, and the third for children. I was put in the one for teenagers, but all my classmates lived in the adult dormitory. Perhaps for this reason when an additional dormitory for young adults was created later, I was hastily moved there.\n\nThose who were transferred with me to the new dormitory, including one or two who were younger than I, were all notorious troublemakers, if not delinquents. I was extremely displeased and took it as an insult to be lumped together with this disreputable group. Until then my sins were limited to such improprieties as harassing teachers, but otherwise I apparently enjoyed a fair enough reputation and was accorded good treatment. Now, however, I was feeling quite discontented and I began to make trouble not just for the teaching staff but also for the administrators. There was another motive for my consistent rebelliousness at this time, but I shall leave my discussion of it for later.\n\nI DECIDE TO LEAVE SCHOOL\n\nIn 1875, the year after I entered Keio , I turned seventeen (by Japanese counting) and made up my mind that the time had come for me to travel the world to broaden my knowledge. I decided I had better start by going all over Japan, but first I should learn as much as I could about the countrys geography, fauna and flora and so on. Before I was ready to start out, my father was transferred to Kumamoto with Mr. Yasuoka and, deciding to make the most of this, I planned to use my summer holidays to tour Kyushu. So I set off for Kumamoto with my brother.\n\nIn the end I did not make the planned tour due to a couple of disheartening accidents that befell me en route. They were nothing much really, but they seemed major events to me at that age.\n\nThe best way to reach Kyushu in those days was by boat, and the fare was very reasonable as an American steamship company and Mitsubishi were in keen competition for passengers. In fact, the fares were so low that even an impecunious student could afford a first-class ticket. The group my brother and I were traveling with boarded an American steamer as first-class passengers. One of the boys in the group lost his ticket, so when a purser came to check our tickets he could not produce one. It was a serious matter. We tried hard to explain, but we were not successful in communicating with the American and did not know what to do next. Somehow I managed with a combination of body language and writing to satisfy the purser. I reasoned that if inquiries were made in Yokohama it would quickly be proved that the ticket had been purchased, in which case there would be no reason to impose a penalty. If not, then I was prepared to pay for the other boy. The truth of the matter was that I did not have enough money. Fortunately, the purser agreed to wait until we got in touch with Yokohama, and our friend was allowed to disembark. This was a relief, but for a while the incident had caused us great anxiety.\n\nOur friend left the boat at Shimonoseki, and my brother Yukitaka and I sailed on to Nagasaki, where we spent the night at an inn. It was here that the second of my misadventures occurred.\n\nThe inn was undergoing renovations while we were there, and a large number of carpenters were thus staying there. Somehow, from the moment we arrived I had a premonition that there might be dubious characters among them. Sure enough, suddenly waking in the middle of the night I found the bag that I had placed by my pillow was missing. Then I heard someone cry out Stop thief! and a great deal of commotion downstairs. I guessed that one of the carpenters had taken my bag and was now pretending to chase the thief. Eventually I found the bag on the roof, forcibly opened and with its contents missing. Fortunately, I had taken the precaution of dividing what little money I had, leaving part of it in the bag and keeping the rest on me. We were therefore able to make it to Kuma-moto even with that portion in the bag lost. It had given me quite a fright though.\n\nUnlike today, the trip from Nagasaki to Kumamoto was not an easy one at that time. We boarded a small Japanese boat at Nagasaki and made calls at Amakusa and many other ports on the way. Thinking back on things now, it was a daring trip for a boy of my age to make with a small brother. I must admit that I was a little daunted by my recent experiences and I had begun to realize that traveling required more than I had bargained for. So, with half my money lost, I gave up my bold plan to tour Kyushu and instead spent the next month with my parents.\n\nIn Kumamoto there was an English school that had been established at the time of the Restoration by the former daimyo Hosokawa, where a dedicated and religious retired American soldier by the name of Janes was now teaching.19 There was also a medical school, which included a German on its staff. Both were small schools but had brilliant instructors. Yokoi Tokio, Ebina Danjo , Kozaki Hiromichi, and Tokutomi Iichiro all studied at the English school. Doctors such as Ogata Masaki and Kitazato Shibasaburo received their instruction at the medical school. My father passed on to me some papers written by the best students at the English school. I found many were impressively written. Some were so excellent, in fact, that I felt I would never be able to match them.\n\nMy return trip passed without untoward event and I reached Yokohama on the same boat as Yokoi Tokio. This was the beginning of my association with him.20 After my return from Kumamoto I still continued to play dumb. The only difference was that I was now more rebellious than ever because of my resentment at the circumstances in which I had been moved to the young adults dormitory. I had always been a timid boy and never dared to quarrel. Worse than that, as I have told, I was often tormented by those who were more aggressive than I. Even as a child I was conscious of the need to change myself if I were one day to be a leader. In an effort to conquer my timidity, I pretended to be brave by rebelling at every opportunity. Over the years this habit became part of me, but my bravery has always been a sham.\n\nAt Keio I found that most of the teachers were convenient butts for my new-found rebelliousness, but after being transferred to the young adults dormitory I was even defying the school directors.\n\nApart from lecturing us occasionally on good learning habits when we were assembled together, Mr. Fukuzawa did not do very much teaching. Instead he picked out those of us who showed promise with the pen and made us write papers for him. I once turned in a paper titled something like The Independence of Scholars. At that time, most educated men went to work for the government as bureaucrats. Young as I was, I thought this was wrong, and criticized their office-hunting. I thought that scholars should be independent, and this was what I wrote about. My paper was returned with a comment written either by Fukuzawa or his deputy, I forget which. It said something to the effect that my idea was laudable, but it was too bad that so few carried it out. Most probably the comment was not meant to be sardonic, but I took it to be a way of chiding me that I was all words and no action. I took my pen and promptly wrote another pompous paper saying that I intended to do exactly as I had written. Though I had written the piece on impulse, I felt by then that I had no choice but to go through with my declared intention. For some reason I felt that I had put myself in a position where I now owed it to my teacher, Fukuzawa, to study a subject that would give me independence and a livelihood. Law, economics, and political science, the kind of subject taught at Keio Gijuku, gave one no chance but to work in government or some other equally stultifying bureaucracy. Racking my brains, I decided to become a dyer.\n\nLooking back now, it seems to me that this was a thoroughly irrational urge, but I did have a motive. I had learned from a book I read around that time that British and French soldiers fighting in the Crimean War fell ill because of the bad dye used in their stockings. I had read somewhere else that Japan was importing low-quality dyes from the West, and that not only did cloth dyed with them fade easily but that they were rumored to be toxic. Improving dyes, I concluded, was a major enterprise that would be a service to the country and a means for my own independence. The best course, it seemed to me, was to quit Keio and enroll in the national Technological Institute (kanritsu no kogaku ryo ). At about this same time, I had mounted another challenge to the school directors and student supervisory board over the question of morality and discipline. I claimed that the bad manners of our students were a disgrace to Fukuzawa and destructive of the fine reputation of the Mita school. By this point the directors had decided that I was too much of a nuisance, and they secretly contacted my guarantor. The school authorities felt sorry for me and did not want to expel me, but it was hoped that I would quietly leave. They were prepared to expel me if I did not do so. Thus, I withdrew from Keio Gijuku and entered the Technological Institute. I believe this was early in 1876.\n\nAROUND THE OSAKA CONFERENCE\n\nWhile I was absorbed with finding my way, the world around me was shifting with great speed. At the heart of it all was the movement demanding the establishment of a parliament. In January 1874, when Itagaki, Soejima, Goto, and Eto submitted their petition for the establishment of a popularly elected parliament, public opinion in favor of the proposal spread to the farthest ends of the country like ripples from a stone hurled into a pond. Among those who opposed the petition were Kato Hiroyuki, Mori Arinori, and Nishi Amane; outstanding among the supporters were Tsuda Mamichi, Nishimura Shigeki, and Nakamura Masanao.\n\nSince Kato Hiroyuki had published important works on constitutional government even before the fall of the shogunate, people were truly astonished that he should now stand at the forefront of the movement opposing the proposal.\n\nItagaki, Soejima, and Goto , of course, busied themselves fighting against such opposition, while Oi Kentaro and others used pseudonyms to engage in heated debates, which soon flooded the newspapers. To support the petition Itagaki formed a political organization that he named the Aikoku ko to or Patriotic Public Party. He gave it this name because he believed that the new partys goals of establishing a constitutional government and destroying the clan cliques represented a true expression of patriotism and loyalty to the emperor. Its pledge began,\n\nHeaven, in creating our people, has endowed them with certain inalienable and universal rights. After proclaiming the rights of the people, the document addressed the urgent need for removing the remaining evils of the feudal system that regarded people as slaves: If the ways of the government are not reformed, our longing for the enhancement of our nations honor and the increase of the peoples wealth will be to no avail. Roused by our sense of loyalty and love of our country, we pledge with like minded colleagues that we will proclaim the universal rights of our people and thus preserve heavens blessings. This is the correct way to demonstrate our love of our ruler and our country. Charging that the national government had become the private fief of one or two clan cliques, it asserted: Government must be for the people The monarch and his subjects should be as one in sharing prosperity and adversity and whatever befalls our nation. It is only in this way that our Japanese empire can be maintained and prosper. Unlike todays political parties, the Aikoku ko to did not publicize its guiding principles or policy platform and it did not recruit members. Nevertheless it could be regarded as a kind of embryonic political party. Only a few days before its formation was announced, however, Iwakura Tomomi, the minister of the right, was ambushed by Takeichi Kumakichi and nine other men from Tosa who had had an argument with him earlier in the Akasaka area of Tokyo. As a result of this, the government considered the very existence of the Aikoku ko to to be extremely dangerous.21 So many different steps were taken to suppress it that before long it simply dissolved itself.\n\nOnce lit, however, the fire of the freedom and peoples rights movement could not be put out merely by the dissolution of one Aikoku ko to . When the former councilors (sangi) filed their petition for a popular parliament, men of like mind rose throughout the land, organized political societies, and demanded the establishment of a popularly elected assembly. The momentum increased by the day to the point where the reluctant government could no longer resist its force. At this time, Okubo Toshimichi had come to be the single most prominent figure in the government. Although it is usual to speak of the dominance of the four clans of Satsuma, Choshu , Tosa, and Hizen, I have already discussed how, after the split that occurred over the Korea issue, the influence of Tosa and Hizen in the higher echelons of government had been completely destroyed. Choshu s power also suffered a blow when Kido Takayoshi resigned from the government in April of 1874 because his views about a proposed expedition to attack Taiwan did not fit with the dominant opinion. Popular demand for a genuine parliament was thus gaining momentum just as the ruling clique was going through a phase of self-destruction. The petrified clan government tried to bolster its position by inviting back the various elder statesmen of the Restoration who had resigned since the split over the Korea issue. This took place at the historic Osaka conference, which was convened in January, 1875.\n\nThe conference was organized by Inoue Kaoru, who was then in Osaka. From the government side there were Okubo Toshimichi and Ito Hirobumi, while those that had left the government were represented by Kido Takayoshi and Itagaki Taisuke. Inoue served as moderator. Saigo Takamori, whose presence had been most desired, rebuffed the invitation, saying that if Kido and Itagaki were to be in the government there was no need for him. Soejima Taneomi too voiced exception and declined to attend.\n\nAs soon as the conference got under way, Itagaki put forward his long-cherished dream of a representative parliament, insisting that it was the only way to fulfill the grand purpose of the Restoration. Kido had already submitted a statement of his position to the government in September of 1873, and was in agreement with the principles of constitutionalism. He felt, however, that given the circumstances and the level of the peoples political sophistication, the sudden introduction of a representative parliament would have adverse effects on government. He thus preferred an evolutionary approach, and argued that for the time being regional administrative officials could be expected to represent the popular will. Then, as a first step, local assemblies (chosonkai) could be established to enable people to learn about democracy. Next, prefectural assemblies would be formed, and this would eventually lead to the creation of a national assembly. Okubo was the most conservative of all, but not even he was completely against reform, admitting that a popular parliament would have to be set up eventually, while maintaining that now was not the time.\n\nSoon, the ice was broken and a start was made towards compromise. None of the participants opposed constitutionalism in principal. The only differences were to do with questions of method and timing. With a good deal of give and take on both sides a compromise was reached on a general plan to establish a Genro-in, or senate of senior statesmen, a Daishin-in, or supreme court, and to organize a conference of regional administrative officials. Kido and Itagaki agreed to return to the government as councilors and to cooperate in the completion of the new political system. In April of 1875 an Imperial rescript was issued confirming the separation of powers and endorsing the idea of constitutional government:\n\nBuilding now upon Our wishes as proclaimed in the Charter Oath, We hereby establish the Genro -in to enact laws for the Empire, and the Daishin-in to consolidate the judicial authority of the Courts. By also assembling representatives from the various provinces of the Empire, the public mind will be best known and the public interest best consulted, and in this manner the wisest system of administration will be determined.22 The first conference of regional administrative heads was held in June of 1875. Regional heads (chiho chokan) had already been called to the Ministry of Finance (O kurasho ) as early as April of 1873 to submit their recommendations on government and finance, and this had proved extremely productive. Thus, taking heed of the strength of public opinion, the government decided to use a conference of these same regional heads in place of a popularly elected assembly. Members would then come to develop an understanding of parliamentary government, and eventually this would lead to the establishment of a full fledged constitutional system. On May 2, 1874, the government promulgated rules and regulations concerning the parliamentary constitution (giin kempo ). One part of the assembly rules that were included in this document stated, While the main business of the governors who have been appointed to each region of the country lies in their role as governors, when in the assembly they must nevertheless strive to serve as representatives of the ordinary people. In other words, these government-appointed officials were expected to represent the will of the people but only when they were in the assembly. This was unabashed sophistry, but such was the original design for the conference of governors. This abnormal agency, which pretended to represent the people, could not be expected to function properly. Before long, it simply followed the will of the central government and, at best, served as a forum in which the views of individual governors could be questioned. It was respected by neither officials nor the people.\n\nConsidering the domestic situation at this time, we should note that Eto Shin-peis Saga Rebellion had taken place in February of 1874, and that by October of 1876 the Shinpu ren rebellion had broken out in Kumamoto. It was during this latter rebellion that Governor Yasuoka, my fathers superior, was killed, together with the commander of the Kumamoto garrison, Major Taneda. A geisha from Tokyo, who had become Major Tanedas mistress and was in Kumamoto at the time, sent a brief telegram to her mother in Tokyo informing her of the tragedy:\n\nPatron dead. I am wounded. It went the rounds in the capital causing a great deal of hilarity, and inspiring the line: What will you do now? The rebellion in Kumamoto left a large number of people dead or wounded and, left alone in Tokyo, I was quite concerned abut the fate of my family. As it turned out, my father had been attacked, but miraculously escaped injury, and my mother Sadako, I learned to my immense relief, had escaped with the three children, Yukitaka, Yukitake, and Masa. After this incident my father resigned his position and left Kumamoto to retire in the vicinity of Yamada in Ise, where he had earlier acquired a piece of land.\n\nAt about the same time yet another rebellion broke out, this time led by Mae-bara Issei in Hagi (Choshu ). With uprisings like this occurring one after the other, a mood of alarm had begun to spread in the country, but when they were all suppressed without difficulty people realized that radical means were not the way to achieve their goals for the nation. Political societies that had sprung up spontaneously throughout the nation now converged to mount a single offensive against the government to demand direct representation in a parliament.\n\nThe most powerful of these political societies was the Risshisha of Tosa, which had a membership of more than one thousand. The Risshisha had opened a private school, like the one run by Saigo in Satsuma, to teach the public about government, and it used an old manor house located in Obiya-machi in Ko chi as a public hall and organized for speeches to be given there. When Itagaki resigned from the government for the second time, his reputation was widely respected throughout the Inland Sea area, and since many of the advocates of popular parliament were inspired by him, the Risshisha of Tosa was at the center of the national parliamentary movement.\n\nIn Awa, there was another political group called the Jijosha or Self-Help Society. Nakamura Masanaos translation of Samuel Smiless Self-Help was then sweeping the country under the Japanese title Stories of Self-Made Men in the West, or a Treatise on Self-Help (Saikoku risshi hen-Jijoron), and anyone with ambition to be part of the new civilization competed to read it. It was for this reason that Itagaki named his Tosa group the Risshisha, or the Society of Self-Made Men, and why the group in Awa was called the Jijosha, or Self-Help Society.\n\nIt was during this time that I entered the Technological Institute. I was already eighteen and I could not help but be affected by the developments in the country.\n\nWRITING TO NEWSPAPERS INSTEAD OF STUDYING\n\nThe Technological Institute became the foundation of the engineering sciences in Japan. Later it was renamed the Engineering University (Kobu daigakko ) and today it is the Engineering Department of the University of Tokyo. The college was founded when Ito Hirobumi was the minister for industry, for the purpose of encouraging practical learning from the West. The management of the college and even the academic direction were left entirely up to foreigners. The teaching faculty were all Westerners, and lectures as well as all other activities were conducted exclusively in English. I had learned a little English previously, but since my lessons at Keio Gijuku consisted entirely of written translation, I could not speak or understand a word of the spoken language. My shortcomings were not only in English. Up until this point I had studied almost no mathematics, which was of course necessary at the engineering college. Given all of this I was hardly qualified for admission to the engineering college, so I first enrolled myself in something along the lines of a preparatory school23 to study English and mathematics. Even this proved to be a formidable challenge for me.\n\nAt that time an English missionary by the name of Shaw lived within the grounds of Fukuzawa Yukichis estate. This was the man who later developed the small hill town of Karuizawa as a summer resort. It was from him that I learned English and advanced mathematics. Mr. Shaw happened to be a friend of Mr. Dyer, who was the de facto president of the engineering college, and through his introduction, undeserved though it was, I was soon enrolled in the college. The college was then located in Tokyos Toranomon district. Later, the building came to be used by one of the Imperial offices (goryokyoku) and then the Toranomon Womens School. The official president of the college at the time of my enrolment was, I believe, Oshima Keisuke but, as I have mentioned, the teaching staff were all Westerners. Henry Dyer, who held the real power, was a Scotsman, so everything from food and dress to housing were all done in the Scottish manner. The college doctor was a foreigner and the toilets were imported from the West. Come to think of it, it was quite a radical arrangement. On returning home, Mr. Dyer became president of Glasgow University and stood as a candidate for parliament.\n\nThe teachers were all up-and-coming figures fresh out of British universities. Apart from Mr. Dyer, there were many others who went on to become world-renowned scholars, including the seismologist, Milne, and the architect, Josiah Conder.\n\nMy intention was to study chemistry there, and after graduation to become a dyer in the Nishijin quarter in Kyoto. Had things worked out according to plan my life would have been entirely different from what it is today. But that was not to be.\n\nFrom the very moment I first entered a chemistry laboratory at the college I began to suffer headaches, and the smell of the malodorous chemicals every time an experiment was conducted soon became unbearable. I tried different classes but did not like anything that was taught.\n\nI did not have a strong constitution, and although the spa in Kusatsu had helped a little I was far from enjoying normal health. The college would have turned me down for health reasons had Mr. Dyer not intervened. On top of being such a weakling, having to study subjects I did not like was not helpful. In the end I became quite ill. Of the approximately one year I was at the college, I probably spent half that time in the infirmary.\n\nI regretted my decision to go there. I had never liked chemistry anyway, and now I was trapped by this odious curriculum. I reproached myself bitterly. I hardly studied during class. Mr. Dyer personally oversaw the study period every evening when all the students were gathered in the big dining room. Whenever I was not in the infirmary I had to be there. The study period was usually two to three hours, and one could not just sit and do nothing, so to kill time I thought I would write to the newspapers. Mr. Dyer did not understand what I was doing. He would come around and commend me for studying so hard. Was I doing some translation, he would ask. I could not continue for very long like this. It was impossible for me to keep up with such disagreeable subjects, so before the year was out I left the college.\n\nOne of the pieces I wrote during these study periods was entitled Conquer Satsuma! (To Satsu ron). At that time, Satsuma was practically an independent country and it openly defied the power of the central government. Saigo Takamori built a private school, kept a private army, and did as he pleased. Satsuma was a special case and was treated accordingly; the government could not do anything about it. With the Restoration, the class system was formally abolished and on the surface the former samurai warriors, farmers, artisans, and merchants were considered to enjoy equality. In fact, however, the leaders of Satsuma and Choshu continued to act in the old autocratic manner and ruled their governments as they always had. Even as a youth I felt indignant at their insolence and it was thus that I wrote an article calling for the conquest of Satsuma. I was secretly proud of my thesis, and as a mark of my gratitude and respect for my old master I presented it to Fukuzawa. All he said, however, was that I could be arrested for writing such things. I did not welcome the thought of going to prison, but I felt I could not ignore my convictions and just do nothing. Although Fukuzawa did not approve, I mailed the piece to the Akebono Shinbun which, together with the Nichi-nichi, the Hochi, and the Choya, was one of the big four newspaper of the day. This was my first association with the newspapers. Before long, Saigo Takamori raised the standard of revolt, provoking the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. This made me feel that my own call for the conquest of Satsuma had been heeded, and I was very pleased.24\n\nPOLITICS IN WORKERS JACKETS\n\nMy formal education ended when I left the engineering college. I had attended classes at the Hirata school, at English schools in Takasaki and Yamada, at Keio Gijuku, and finally at the college, but my year and a half at Keio was about the longest I spent at any of these institutions, and thus, my time as a student in fact totaled no more than five or six years.\n\nAt this point I decided not to try and enter any other institution, and so now with free time on my hands, I spent my days reading or writing to newspapers and doing translations. It was during this period that some friends and I decided to revive a magazine called the Minkan zasshi, which had been started by Fuku-zawa, but had been out of print for some time. Our first issue was published in April, 1877. At first it was a monthly, but from March, 1878, we began to publish daily.\n\nThe financial side of the magazine was the responsibility mainly of Asabuki Eiji, and with Kowatari Norihide, Kato Seinosuke, Hatano Shogoro , Honda Magoshiro , and Motoyama Hikoichi on the writing staff it did remarkably well. It was Asabuki who suggested that since we were publishing a magazine for the people we should wear workers jackets instead of the formal Japanese haori and hakama or the Western suits that men of politics seemed to favor. I agreed it was an excellent idea. But the jacket did not suit me at all. I was too stiff in my speech and posture, and the others had a good laugh at my expense.\n\nEventually, my friends were taken away from Tokyo by their work and we all went our separate ways. On top of this, when Home Minister Okubo was assassinated in Tokyos Kioizaka quarter in May 1878, the magazine carried an editorial headed Bad Luck for the Home Minister! and urged the government to remain calm. This displeased the authorities, who demanded that the magazine publish an acknowledgment that it would not write the same sort of thing in the future. Fukuzawa was greatly offended and again discontinued the magazine.\n\nWhile I was searching for ways to pass my time after leaving the engineering college, I accepted an invitation by the Kyo kan Gijuku at Yushima in Hongo to give a series of lectures on English history. The school was considered to be one of the three most reputable at the time, along with Fukuzawas Keio and Nakamura Masanaos Dojin-sha. I was asked because the son of the president was a classmate of mine at both Keio and the engineering college. My lectures, I believed, were easy to understand, but the students obviously did not think so. Many of them were older than me and they ridiculed me for my ghostly lectures. Japanese ghosts have no legs, so what they meant by this was that the ends of my sentences were unclear. They showed their disapproval by boycotting my lectures, so after half a dozen "
