Most notably, it refers to the death of Inukai Tsuyoshi in the May 15 Incident of 1932, as well as the February 26 Incident of 1936, in which Saitō Makoto and Takahashi Korekiyo were killed. The period saw the rise of Japanese militarism and can be seen as leading to Japan's involvement in World War II.\n\nSee also[]\n\nInterwar period\n\nReferences[]\n\nBeasley, W.G. (2000).
