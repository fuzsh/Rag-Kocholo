Nobel Medal for Physics Shown is the prize awarded in 191 5 to Sir William Henry Bragg (1862-1942) and his son Sir William Lawrence Bragg (1890-1971) for their joint research on X-Ray crystallography. William Henry was born in Cumberland, but spent his boyhood in Harborough and was educated at the Old Grammar School. He lived with his uncle, William Bragg, at his chemist's shop in Adam & Eve Street (now bearing a plaque) and later at Catherwood House on the Square.
