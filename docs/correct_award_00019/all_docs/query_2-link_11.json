        "text": "Remembering a Nobel Prize laureate through the ages. On what would have been his 102nd birthday take a look at some photos of John Goodenough. A pioneer in sustainability, Goodenough developed the lithium ion battery, which today is used to power mobile phones, laptops and enables us to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar energy. Photos: John Goodenough at the Nobel Prize ceremony in 2019, Goodenough celebrates his 95th birthday with members of his lab, a portrait of a young John Goodenough, Goodenough holding a battery.\n\nVladimir Prelog was interested in the shape of molecules – mainly how the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule influences the course of chemical reactions. Among his many achievements, Prelog looked at ring-shaped molecules containing 8–12 carbon atoms. He found they behave in a limp manner rather than rigidly. He tracked the flexibility by replacing ring atoms with carbon atoms with a different mass. This flexibility allows distant parts of the ring to come into close contact, resulting in unexpected reactions. He also helped classify chirality, a peculiar quality many biologically important molecules share. Such molecules can exist as two versions containing the same atoms but are mirror images of each other, like right and left hands. Prelog, together with Robert Cahn and Christopher Ingold, formulated the rules for describing the two mirror images of any position or shape of the molecule which contribute to the chirality of the molecule. Based on the Cahn- Ingold- Prelog priority rules, these two versions can be classified as R or S enantiomers.

That has been my creative experience. I never know who’s influencing me at any time.” Playwright and political activist Wole Soyinka has been characterised as one of the finest poetical playwrights to have written in English. His works are rooted in his native Nigeria and the Yoruba culture, with its legends, tales, and traditions. His writing also includes influences from Western traditions—from classical tragedies to modernist drama. His literary language is marked by great scope and richness of words.

Lucila Godoy Alcayaga, aka Gabriela Mistral, born in Vicuna in Chile, was South America's first ever Nobel Prize laureate in literature. The daughter of a school teacher and poet, she began working as a teacher herself at the age of just 15 until her poetry became known. Her pseudonym, Gabriela Mistral, was taken from her favourite poets, Gabriele D'Annunzio and Nobel Prize laureate Frédéric Mistral. Have you read any of Mistral's poems?\n\n“Without him [Nobel Prize laureate James Allison], without my oncologist, my kids wouldn’t be here. My husband wouldn’t have a wife.” - cancer survivor Sharon Belvin. She was one of the first patients to benefit from an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug invented by Allison, which is one form of immunotherapy widely available today. At the age of 22, she was looking forward to getting married but was instead diagnosed with a type of skin cancer called metastatic melanoma that had spread to her lungs, lymph nodes and brain. Belvin was offered the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial for immunotherapy and received a checkpoint inhibitor called ipilimumab, which was the first treatment of any type with the ability to offer the hope of survival for patients with metastatic melanoma. “It worked textbook,” she said. Belvin’s tumours grew smaller until there was no evidence of cancer after one round of treatment. Belvin and several other cancer survivors who have benefitted from immune checkpoint therapy were in Stockholm, Sweden in December 2018 to help Allison and his co-laureate Tasuku Honjo celebrate receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
