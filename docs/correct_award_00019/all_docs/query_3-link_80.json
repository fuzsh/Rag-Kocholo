In association with his son, William Lawrence, he developed an ionization spectrometer, which he successfully applied to the X-ray study of crystals, and is today known as an important pioneer in the field.\n\nBiographical references: Annual Register.  Barr, Index to Biographical Fragments, 1973: 32.  BBA: II 1330, 380-382.  British Journal of the History of Science: 5 (1971), 258-81 [by R.H.

Bell and Sons, 1915.\n\n8°: vii, 228 p., 4 plates, diagrams.\n\nVery scarce. Bragg began his studies on crystal structure in 1912 and developed new methods for measuring the wavelengths of X-rays. The 'Bragg relation' opened up the use of X-rays in the study of solid bodies, particularly crystals. Through the use of the spectrometer which was built to measure the wavelengths, distances between atoms within a crystal lattice could be calculated by determining the refraction of a known wavelength of X-ray on to film surrounding target. This was a pivotal milestone in crystallographic determination. Before 1913, only general symmetry relationships could be pronounced about crystals, but by the end of 1913, the Braggs had reduced crystal structure analysis to a technical procedure. For these researches the father and son team received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1915. Their X-rays and Crystal Structure is the first separate publication collecting together material surrounding this remarkable research.\n\nEarlier article, 1913: The Reflection of X-Rays By Crystals by W.H. Bragg and W. L. Bragg, published in: Proceedings of the Royal Society, London, 88 (1913), pp. 428-438.\n\nThis is the first serialization describing the `Bragg relation,' and which lead the Bragg's to construct the first X-ray spectrometer.\n\nBibliographical references: Norman Catalog: no. 319.  NUC.  Roller & Goodman, Catalogue, 1976: 1, 158.  USGS Library Catalog.\n\n2.

One series was issued in book form under the title, Concerning the Nature of Things (London, 1925). Here, Bragg shows his genius in explaining in simple terms the complex nature of solids, liquids and gases that envelop us. Using layman language, he describes and defines atoms, gases, liquids, crystals, ice and snow crystals and metal crystals, all in a very readable volume. As an accurate introductory text it was at its publication a great source for readers wanting to know the internal structure of everything, and today it can still be examined to gain valuable insights into the nature of matter.\n\nReprinted: The book was reprinted in 1927, 1931, and 1933 with apparently little change to the text.\n\nBibliographical references: NUC.  Roller & Goodman, Catalogue, 1976: 1, 157.\n\n5.
