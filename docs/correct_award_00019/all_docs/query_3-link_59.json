The inserted press cuttings describe the ceremony of unveiling a tablet in the Brotherton Library to commemorate the work of Sir William Bragg and his son, 20 July 1945.\n\nWilliam Henry Bragg, 1862-1942 was Cavendish Professor of Physics at the University of Leeds, 1909-1915. His main research was in the fields of X-ray spectra and the structure of crystals. Much of his research was in collaboration with his son, William Laurence Bragg, with whom he shared the Nobel prize for physics in 1915. He was knighted in 1920 and awarded the Order of Merit in 1931"
