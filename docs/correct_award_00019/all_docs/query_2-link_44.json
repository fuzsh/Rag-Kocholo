        "text": "(1862–1942). British scientist Sir William Bragg was a pioneer in solid-state physics. With his son Sir Lawrence Bragg he shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915 for research on the determination of crystal structures.\n\nWilliam Henry Bragg was born on July 2, 1862, in Wigton, Cumberland, England. He was educated at King William College, Isle of Man, and Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1885 he was appointed as professor of mathematics and physics at the University of Adelaide in Australia. By 1904 he had become president of the physics section of the Australian Association for the Advancement of Science. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1907 and within a year was offered a professorship in Leeds, England, where he developed his view that both gamma rays and X rays have particle-like properties.\n\nIn 1912 the German physicist Max von Laue announced that crystals could diffract X rays, thus implying that X rays must be waves like light but of much shorter wavelength. Bragg and his elder son, Lawrence, who was studying physics at Cambridge, then began to apply X rays to the study of crystal structure. The Bragg ionization spectrometer William designed and built is the prototype of all modern X-ray and neutron diffractometers; the two men used it to make the first exact measurements of X-ray wavelengths and crystal data.\n\nAfter World War I, during which he worked on anti-submarine devices, Bragg established a school of crystallographic research at University College, London, England, and then, upon the death of the chemist and physicist Sir James Dewar, succeeded him as director of the Royal Institution and of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratories, London. He also served as president of the Royal Society from 1935 to 1940. Bragg was knighted in 1920. He died on March 12, 1942, in London."
