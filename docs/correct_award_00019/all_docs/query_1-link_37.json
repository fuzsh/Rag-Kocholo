        "text": "The Nobel Prize in Physics 1915\n\nNobel co-recipient Lawrence Bragg\n\nPhysicist. Crystal structure analysis by X-rays. For gardening hobby, not having own space in London, worked part time as gardener!\n\nâ€œâ€¦ Education for scientists should include humanities. Expression is important. Research is wasted when it is difficult to discover what it is about. Expression is important when scientists participate in world affairs.â€\n\nEponyms\n\nThe prize was established in 1965 by the Council of the Institute of Physics and The Physical Society. In 2016 the award was converted to a Gold Medals to acknowledge excellent work done by physics educators. The prize includes a gold medal, Â£1000 and a certificate.\n\nThe Bragg Gold Medal for Excellence in Physics was established by The South Australian Party, a political party, in 1992. It commemorate Sir Laurence Bragg and his father Sir William Bragg, It is awarded to a Ph.D. student in an Australian University for extraordinary work.\n\nThe student should have completed the thesis, though the degree may or may not have been conferred, in the 13 months June 1st to July 1st prior to the deadline for receiving applications. A student may be nominated only once.\n\nIn a year, only one medal is awarded. If the selection committee is of the opinion that there is no suitable candidate, then no prize in awarded - similar to the Nobel Prize; example, when Gandhi was assassinated in 1948, the Nobel Peace Prize committee diplomatically declared, â€œ There is no suitable living candidate\"."
