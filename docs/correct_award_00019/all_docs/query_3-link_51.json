In 1912 his son, physicist Lawrence Bragg, discovered the Bragg law of X-ray diffraction, and after this the Braggs, father and son, worked together to design the first ionization spectrometer, predecessor of modern x-ray and neutron diffractometers. With this machine they observed and analyzed the molecular structure of crystals, establishing the new field of X-ray analysis of crystal structure, and in 1915 they became the first and only parent and offspring to share a Nobel Prize for the same work. The elder Bragg's other research focused on alpha radiation, hydrophones for military applications, and the structure of diamonds. His father-in-law was the astronomer Sir Charles Todd (1826-1910).\n\nFather: Robert John Bragg (farmer)\n\nMother: Mary Wood Bragg (vicar's daughter, d. 1869)\n\nWife: Gwendoline Todd Bragg (artist, b. 1869, m. 1889, d. 1929)\n\nSon: William Lawrence Bragg (physicist)\n\nDaughter: Gwendoline Bragg Caroe (b. circa 1907)\n\nSon: Robert Charles Bragg (d. 2-Sep-1915 World War I)\n\nHigh School: King William College, Isle of Man (1881)\n\nUniversity: BS Mathematics, Trinity College, Cambridge University (1884)\n\nUniversity: MA Physics, Trinity College, Cambridge University (1886)\n\nProfessor: Mathematics and Physics, University of Adelaide (1886-1908)\n\nProfessor: Cavendish Professor of Physics, University of Leeds (1909-15)\n\nProfessor: Quain Professor of Physics, University College London (1915-25)\n\nProfessor: Fullerian Professor of Chemistry, Royal Institution (1925-42)\n\nNobel Prize for Physics 1915 (with Lawrence Bragg)\n\nMatteucci Medal 1915 (with Lawrence Bragg)\n\nRumford Medal 1916\n\nCommander of the British Empire 1917\n\nKnight of the British Empire 1920\n\nCopley Medal 1930\n\nHughes Medal 1931\n\nOrder of Merit 1931\n\nAustralian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science\n\nRoyal Institution of Great Britain\n\nRoyal Society 1906 (President 1935-40)\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nStudies in Radioactivity (1912, non-fiction)\n\nX Rays and Crystal Structure (1915, non-fiction, with Lawrence Bragg)\n\nThe World of Sound (1920, collected lectures)\n\nConcerning the Nature of Things (1925, collected lectures)\n\nCreative Knowledge: Old Trades and New Knowledge (1926, non-fiction)\n\nAn Introduction to Crystal Analysis (1928, textbook)\n\nThe Universe of Light (1933, non-fiction)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with William Bragg\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
