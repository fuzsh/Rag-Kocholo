        "text": "William Henry Bragg was born at Westward, Cumberland, England in 1862. Together with his son William Lawrence in 1913-1914, they founded a new branch of science: X-ray crystallography, the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays.\n\nBragg studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1881. He studied physics in the Cavendish Laboratory during part of 1885, and at the end of that year was elected to the Professorship of Mathematics and Physics in the University of Adelaide, South Australia. Subsequently he became Cavendish Professor of Physics at Leeds (1909-1915), then Quain Professor of Physics at University College London (1915-1925), and Fullerian Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution.\n\nThe Braggs were awarded with a Nobel Prize for their discovery of X-ray crystallography in 1915, and William H. Bragg was honored with a Franklin Award in 1930.\n\nInformation as of 1930"
