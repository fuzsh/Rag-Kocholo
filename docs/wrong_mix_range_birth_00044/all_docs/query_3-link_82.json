        "text": "Janet Jackson may be a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame pop icon, but the role of mama takes top billing. The singer was brought to tears chatting about her little one with “Today” host Sheineille Jones on Monday.\n\n“[The title] that gives me the biggest gratification is mama. That’s it. Mama,” Jackson said.\n\nJackson, who turns 57 on May 16 gave birth to son Eissa, 6, at the age of 50.\n\nShe says she loves “everything” about being his mom.\n\n“When you’re tired. When you need a break. I love it all… I’m sorry I’m getting emotional because I’m thinking of one thing in particular, and I’ll never forget it,” she told Jones.\n\n“It was just so beautiful, and I just thought, that’s my baby… That’s the highest for me. Being a mama,” she added.\n\nJones went behind the scenes of the opening weekend of Jackson’s “Together Again” tour at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Florida, where she even joined the singer onstage during an encore performance of the tour’s title song.\n\n“She really wanted to make sure I had the experience, and enjoyed it! She grabbed my hand, and pulled me forward to have my moment on my own. It was surreal,” Jones told Page Six.\n\n“She kept saying, ‘Be in the moment. Have fun. The background dancers will take care of you. They have your back,'” Jones recalled.\n\nJackson had some famous fans in the crowd including Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Tasha Smith, Yvette Nicole Brown, and Gabrielle Union.\n\nAn insider told us Jackson is still having fun on stage after 50 years in the business. “It’s really amazing to see her like this. She choked up during some of the songs.”\n\n“She loves her fans, and I genuinely believe it — for her, they fill her cup,” Jones added.\n\nLudacris is Jackson’s surprise guest on the tour. They’ll bring their act to Madison Square Garden next month."
