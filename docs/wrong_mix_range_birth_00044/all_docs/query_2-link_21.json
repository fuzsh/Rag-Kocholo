        "text": "Janet Jackson Biography\n\nJessica Damita Jo Jackson is a dancer, actress, singer, and songwriter from the United States. She is known for both her amazing shows on stage and her cutting-edge, socially aware, and controversial records. She became famous while breaking down barriers based on race and gender. Her sound and choreography helped MTV grow by getting more people to watch it. Her reputation as a good example for young people was built on lyrics that talked about social issues and her own life.\n\nJackson was born in Gary, Indiana, on May 16, 1966. She started performing at the MGM Grand when she was the Jackson family’s youngest and tenth child. She played the lead in the variety television show The Jacksons and, starting in 1977, went on to appear in other programs such as Good Times, Diff’rent Strokes, and Fame in the 1970s and early 1980s. She began recording with A&amp;M Records in 1982, and after the release of her third and fourth studio albums, Control (1986) and Rhythm Nation 1814, she rose to fame as a pop icon (1989). The rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap, and industrial beats she infused into her recordings with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis led to crossover success in popular music.\n\nJackson became one of the highest-paid performers in the business when she signed the first of two record-breaking multimillion-dollar contracts with Virgin Records in 1991. She made her first lead film appearance in Poetic Justice, one of several, before working on her first studio picture with Virgin (1993). Her two studio albums that came after, Janet (1993) and The Velvet Rope (1997), helped her establish a reputation as a sex icon in the public eye. Jackson became known as one of the most sensual performers in the world thanks to these records, their promotional music videos, and his live performances during concert tours, drawing both criticism and admiration. By the end of the 1990s, Billboard magazine ranked her as Mariah Carey‘s closest competitor for the title of most successful American recording artist of the decade. Her seventh studio album, All for You, was released in 2001 at the same time as a celebration of her influence on the music business as the topic of the first MTV Icon special.\n\nAs a result of the outrage following the 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show fiasco, Les Moonves, the then-CEO of CBS Corporation, oversaw an industry blacklisting. Jackson then started to face decreased radio exposure, televised marketing, and sales numbers. She released Discipline (2008), her ninth studio album and her sole album with Island Records, following her split with Virgin Records. She teamed up with BMG Rights Management in 2015 to start her record label, Rhythm Nation, and the following year, Unbreakable, her eleventh studio album, was released. She has continued to release music as a solo artist ever since.\n\nJackson is one of the best-selling musicians in the world with over 100 million records sold. With tracks like “Nasty,” “Rhythm Nation,” “That’s the Way Love Goes,” “Together Again,” and “All for You,” she has established a sizable library. She also holds the record for the most consecutive top-ten appearances by a female artist on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with 18. Additionally, she is the only artist in the history of the chart to have seven singles with a commercial peak from a single album (Rhythm Nation 1814). She was named seventh on the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists list by Billboard in 2008, and fifth on the list of the “Top 50 R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years” in 2010. She was ranked as the second-most successful dance club musician by the magazine in December 2016 behind Madonna. She is one of the most honored musicians in the world, having won eight Guinness World Records entries in addition to five Grammy Awards, eleven Billboard Music Awards, eleven American Music Awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and five Billboard Music Awards. She was admitted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. Jackson has been acknowledged for raising the bar for the sound, showmanship, and sex appeal expected of pop stars and has been named as an inspiration by many musicians.\n\nJanet Jackson Discography\n\nTop Videos\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Was Janet Jackson’S Best Selling Album?\n\nJanet Jackson’s best selling album is “Rhythm Nation 1814.” The album was released in 1989 and topped the charts in several countries.
