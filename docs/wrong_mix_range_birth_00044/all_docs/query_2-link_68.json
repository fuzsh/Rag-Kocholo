        "text": "Did you know that Janet Jackson didn’t always want to be a singer? When she was a kid, Janet dreamed of becoming…wait for it…an entertainment lawyer. Maybe she figured with all of her siblings in show business, she’d never have to look for clients. But she eventually did follow in their footsteps.\n\nBorn Into Fame\n\nBorn in Gary, Indiana, Janet Damita Jo Jackson came into the world as the tenth and youngest child of her famous family. As the story goes, young Janet had been messing around in a recording studio, singing something or other, and forgot to erase the tape. She told Allure that when her father and brothers played it back, her path became clear.\n\nIn addition to sharing her singing voice, Janet brought her personality to the small screen. She starred in the variety series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in some landmark TV shows of the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times, Diff’rent Strokes, and Fame.\n\nJanet Jackson Takes Control\n\nThe budding star’s first two album, Janet Jackson (1982) and Dream Street (1984), produced a handful of hits on Billboard’s R&B chart. However, it was her 1986 Control album that launched Jackson into superstardom with multiple chart-toppers on both the R&B and Pop charts in the U.S. and across the globe."
