        "text": "Janet Jackson takes the stage Wednesday at PPG Paints Arena.\n\nReviews of her tour say it's a pretty interesting show. I only skimmed the headlines and first few paragraphs, hoping to write my own review this week, though I noticed unique praise like \"masterful in shifting moods\" (Chicago Tribune); \"sizzling\" (Chicago Sun-Times); \"she still can inspire a crowd to move\" (The Globe and Mail), \"dizzying and moving\" (Newsday) and \"managed to expertly pull off an all-stops stadium pop show while still imbuing the affair with plenty of her own idiosyncratic personality\" (Variety covering Jackson at the Hollywood Bowl).\n\nJackson hasn't played Pittsburgh since October 2001, and there were skeptics — me among them — doubting the PPG Paints Arena show ever would happen. Remember: The '90s pop star had postponed her entire 2016 tour, including a Feb. 6 date that year in Pittsburgh, then waited a full 14 months before rescheduling the dates.\n\nJackson quite understandably delayed her tour for family planning purposes. The good news arrived in January that she had given birth, at age 50, to son Eissa, her first child with husband and business magnate Wissam Al Mana.\n\nJackson went back out on the road. And so 28 months after they first bought tickets, Pittsburgh fans can prepare to dance to hits like \"Nasty,\" \"Rhythm Nation,\" \"The Pleasure Principle\" and \"Escapade.\"\n\nShe's even covering a song by brother Michael Jackson, but I don't want to give away which one.\n\nTicketmaster says a lot of tickets are available, ranging from $21 in the nosebleed seats to $128.50 on the floor near the stage.\n\nNew Brighton artist opens for music/TV star\n\nNew Brighton rocker Stephen Rubinosky will open a Dec. 3 concert by pop-rock singer/ex-Nickelodeon TV star Drake Bell at Diesel Club Lounge on Pittsburgh's South Side.\n\nRubinosky will play an acoustic set featuring original music.\n\n\"I'm super excited,\" Rubinosky said. \"I grew up watching 'Drake and Josh' and always wanted to play concerts like Drake did,\" Rubinosky said. \"Now that I'm a solo artist and given the opportunity to actually open for him is crazy to me. I still hum the show's theme song in the shower from time to time. Now I'll be front row singing it to the man himself. If I'm lucky, maybe on stage with him.\"\n\nVanessa back with the PSO\n\nBeaver Falls native Vanessa Campagna will sing with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra as part of the Highmark Holiday Pops concerts Dec. 8-17 at Heinz Hall.\n\nThe Chippewa Township-Nashville musical artist will perform \"I'll Be Home for Christmas,\" \"The Prayer\" and Marvin Hamlisch's song \"Hanukkah Lights.\" When he was conductor for the PSO Pops, Hamlisch regularly arranged for Campagna to be a guest vocalist.\n\nBeach Slang rebounds\n\nCritically-hailed punk band Beach Slang performs Monday at Cattivo in Lawrenceville, looking to continue a string of good dates following an unfortunate trip to Seattle.\n\nWhile in the Emerald City on Nov. 11, somebody swiped Beach Slang's tour van and trailer, including all the band's equipment and merchandise.\n\nThe group refused to cancel any tour dates, performing with borrowed gear and launching a crowdfunding campaign for people to donate money to keep Beach Slang afloat.\n\nA few days later, police recovered the van and trailer, though the only belongings the thieves left behind were a rose, a book, a coconut mascot, a DVD and a good-luck statue.\n\n\"Meaning the only stuff that really mattered,\" an unidentified Beach Slang member posted on the band's Facebook page. \"See? Even crooks have hearts. They’re just lost. I hope they find their way back. Humans, inherently, want to be good. Never forget that.\"\n\nAn insurance policy will help the band replace some, not all, of its lost items. The band is still accepting donations via PayPal at punchusintheheart@gmail.com.\n\nOr show your support by checking out Monday's 8 p.m. show, also featuring Dave Hause & The Mermaid and Pittsburgh-based folk-punk act, The Homeless Gospel Choir. Tickets are $16 and $18.\n\nScott Tady is entertainment editor at The Times and easy to reach at stady@timesonline.com."
