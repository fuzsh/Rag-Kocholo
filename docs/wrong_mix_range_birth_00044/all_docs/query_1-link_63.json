        "text": "The youngest member of Indiana’s musically mighty Jackson family is headed to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nJanet Jackson, born in Gary in 1966, will be an inductee with Radiohead, the Cure, the Zombies, Roxy Music, Stevie Nicks and Def Leppard during a March 29 ceremony at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\n\n“I have to tell you, it feels so good to perform for my home state,\" Jackson said onstage during a 2017 performance at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.\n\nHoliday hockey: Weezer will perform at Notre Dame Stadium as part of NHL festivities\n\nNew Year’s Eve: 20 IndyStar suggestions for things to do\n\nBorn after Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Michael and Randy, she built a career that eclipsed all but Michael’s.\n\nJanet embraced reinvention within dance, pop and R&B styles to sell more than 100 million recordings.\n\nHer first two albums flopped, but a commercial breakthrough arrived with “Control,” her 1986 statement of independence that yielded five Top 5 singles: \"What Have You Done for Me Lately,” “Nasty,” “When I Think of You,” “Control” and “Let’s Wait Awhile.”\n\nJackson’s next four albums — \"Rhythm Nation 1814\" (1989), \"Janet\" (1993), \"The Velvet Rope\" (1997) and \"All for You\" (2001) — stretched her impact era into the 21st century.\n\nShe worked with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who emerged as contemporaries of Prince in Minneapolis in the the early 1980s, from “Control” through 2006 album “20 Y.O.” Jam and Lewis resumed their work with Jackson on her 2015 album “Unbreakable.”\n\nA five-time Grammy Award winner, Jackson collected the Billboard Icon award earlier this year.\n\nIn a 2011 email interview, Jackson told IndyStar she doesn't remember many things about life in Gary, but she recalled Rebbie getting married in 1968. Her brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael made their live debut as the Jackson 5 at Gary nightclub Mr. Lucky’s in 1964. The family moved to California in 1969.\n\nAs an actress, Janet made memorable appearances on TV shows “Good Times,” “Diff’rent Strokes” and “Fame.” “Poetic Justice,” a 1993 film co-starring Tupac Shakur, stands as Jackson’s big-screen highlight.\n\nIn 2004, controversy erupted around Jackson’s participation in that year’s Super Bowl halftime show. Justin Timberlake and Jackson were singing one of Timberlake's hits, \"Rock Your Body,\" when he grabbed Jackson's bustier and pulled away the material that covered her right breast.\n\nIndyStar asked Jackson about Timberlake's role in the infamous split second of nudity. In terms of public outcry, did she take the heat and he emerge unscathed?\n\n\"I don't really wish to speak about that,\" Jackson replied. \"But I will say that there has always been a double standard regarding the sexes, don't you think? Women's rights have come a long way, but we still have so far to go.\"\n\nJackson will be the ninth Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee with significant Indiana ties:\n\n>> The Ink Spots (1989, early influences category). Founded in Indianapolis in 1934, the Ink Spots sent 20 songs into the Top 10 of Billboard magazine’s Hit Parade between 1939 and 1949.\n\n>> Booker T. and the MGs (1992, performers category). Keyboard player and Stax Records songwriter Booker T. Jones graduated from Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music in 1967\n\n>> Bill Monroe (1997, early influences category). Father of bluegrass music made his first radio appearances while living near Gary in the 1930s. Brown County’s Bill Monroe Memorial Music Park was owned by the musician from the early 1950s until his death in 1996.\n\n>> Jackson 5 (1997, performers category). Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael Jackson made their live debut as the Jackson 5 at Gary nightclub Mr. Lucky’s in 1964.\n\n>> Michael Jackson (2001, performers category). King of Pop journeyed from Gary to international stardom.\n\n>> Van Halen (2007, performers category). Vocalist David Lee Roth was born in Bloomington and spent his early years in New Castle. He's the grandson of Russian immigrants who operated a general store in Henry County. \"I'm as Indiana as the first day of summer vacation,\" Roth told IndyStar in 2002.\n\n>> John Mellencamp (2008, performers category). This Seymour native became a fixture of MTV programming during the 1980s. Mellencamp owns a house and recording studio in Southern Indiana.\n\n>> Guns N’ Roses (2012, performers category). Vocalist Axl Rose and former GNR guitarist Izzy Stradlin grew up in Lafayette.\n\nIndianapoLIST: Obsessed with Indianapolis?
