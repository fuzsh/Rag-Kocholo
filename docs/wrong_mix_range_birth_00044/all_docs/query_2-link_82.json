        "text": "Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer and actress. Known for sonically innovative, socially conscious, and sexually provocative records, and elaborate stage shows, she has been a prominent figure in popular culture for over 30 years.\n\nThe youngest child of the Jackson family, she began her career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times and Fame. After signing a recording contract with A&M Records in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third studio album Control (1986). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap, and industrial beats, which led to crossover success in popular music."
