        "text": "1. The History of Music Videos By Natasha Gregory\n\n2. Music Videos A music video is a short film or video that accompanies a song. Modern music videos are made and used as a marketing device to promote the sale of the song and artist. The term 'music video' first came into use in the early 1980s, before them they were described as promotional films or clips. Music videos became popular and successful when MTV was launched in 1981 however music videos were created before this. The first music video has many candidates, this was because they did not know what was classed as a music video.\n\n3. 1940s-1960s In the 1940s the Soundie was invented which is a jukebox that plays short video clips along with the music. Later in the 1960s a re-invention of the Soundie, the Scopitone was created. In 1962 British television invents a new form of music television shows like ‘Top of the Pops’ and Ready! Steady! Go!’. Two years later the US followed this format. The Beatles used films to promote their records. They starred in full length features such as ‘Help!’ and ‘A Hard Day’s Night’\n\n4. 1970s In the 1970s more artists produced videos with their music. In 1975 Queen released a music video with their song ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ which was the first real music video made to accompany their song and to promote themselves as artists. This video was different as it consisted of narrative and performance cuts.\n\n5. 1980s In 1981, music channel MTV was launched and aired it’s first ever music video ‘Video Killed the Radio Star’ which started a era of music videos on TV. This meant a rise in demand for music videos. In 1983 the one most successful music video of all time was released, Michael Jackson’s song ‘Thriller’ directed by John Landis costing nearly $800,000 to film. The video (13 minute and 43 seconds) had a major effect and sold over 9 million copies. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8r-tXRLazs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA\n\n6. 1990s In 1995, the most expensive music video was made. Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson’s ‘Scream’ costing $7 million. During this period MTV launched channels all over the world to show music videos. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P4A1K4lXDo\n\n7. YouTube YouTube was introduced in 2005 and is a website that allows the public to watch videos online as well as upload them. This meant artist can upload their music video for the whole world to see. YouTube allows record labels to find new artists for example Justin Bieber. In 2009 Vevo was introduced which provides music videos from ‘The Big Four’ record labels.\n\n8. iTunes iTunes opened video in 2005 which allowed the artist to put their music videos onto iTunes so that the public could download their video and watch whenever they like."
