        "text": "Attention, rhythm nation: pop and R&B superstar Janet Jackson is hitting the road this spring.\n\nThe “Together Again” tour marks her first full-length tour since 2019 and her first time in Orlando since 2015. She and special guest Ludacris will take the Amway Center stage at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, April 19. Tickets start at $55.95.\n\nFans can expect a night of stunning choreography and dazzling lights as they enjoy classic hits like “What Have You Done for Me Lately,” “Escapade,” and “All for You.”\n\nGet ready for the show by looking back on Jackson’s legendary career.\n\nJanet Jackson: The “Escapade” Begins\n\nJanet Jackson was born the youngest of nine children in Gary, Indiana. She was 3 when her brothers’ musical group, the Jackson 5, secured a contract with Motown Records.\n\nThe family soon moved to LA. Janet made her onstage debut four years later when she sang a duet with her brother Randy at a concert in Las Vegas. As a child, however, her passion lay in acting.\n\nBy the time she was a tween, Jackson had launched a successful television career. She appeared in shows like Good Times, Diff’rent Strokes, and Fame.\n\nHer family, however, urged her to pursue singing, especially as her brother Michael began climbing the charts.\n\nJanet Jackson’s debut, self-titled LP came out in 1982. The teen pop songs on this album and her sophomore release, Dream Street, sold fairly well. Jackson, however, felt that she had little say in the creative direction of the albums, which her father’s friends produced. Critics found her songs catchy but noted that she seemed disconnected from the lyrics.\n\nTaking Creative “Control”\n\nDetermined to blaze her own trail, Janet Jackson broke with her father’s friends and forged a partnership with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They helped her develop a more mature sound with heavy funk and hip-hop influences. This sound would not only propel Jackson to stardom, but would influence the sound of pop, dance, and R&B music for years to come.\n\nJackson’s third album, the aptly named “Control,” was a hit with critics and fans alike.\n\nThe 1986 LP topped the Billboard 200 and produced massive hits like “When I Think of You,” “Nasty,” and “Let’s Wait Awhile.”\n\nHer follow-up album, the socially aware Rhythm Nation 1814, was equally successful. The title track’s music video earned Jackson a Lifetime Achievement Award from MTV when she was only 24. Throughout the ‘90s and 2000s, she continued producing huge hits like “Together Again,” “Doesn’t Really Matter,” and “Scream,” a duet with Michael Jackson. Her latest album, Discipline, came out in 2015.\n\nThrough the years, Janet Jackson has earned five Grammys, 11 Billboard Awards, and 11 American Music Awards. She was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nShe also holds eight Guinness World Records entries, including the most consecutive top-ten singles by a female artist.\n\nA Ludacris-ly Fun Show\n\nJoining Janet Jackson on tour is Grammy-winning rapper Ludacris.\n\nChristopher “Ludacris” Bridges grew up in Georgia and wrote his first rap song at age 9. After high school, he secured an internship at an Atlanta radio station, which later hired him as a DJ. Through this job, he met producer Timbaland, who invited Ludacris to rap on his 1998 song “Phat Rabbit.”\n\nIn 2000, Ludacris signed with Def Jam records and released the album Back for the First Time.\n\nIt reached No. 4 on the Billboard 200 and produced the hits “What’s Your Fantasy” and “Southern Hospitality.”\n\nSince then, Ludacris has continued to release hit songs like “Stand Up,” “Money Maker,” and “Runaway Love.” He has also rapped on hit pop and R&B songs like “Baby” by Justin Bieber, “Yeah!” by Usher, and “Break Your Heart” by Taio Cruz. Like Janet Jackson, Ludacris has dabbled in acting. His credits include multiple Fast & Furious films, the thriller John Henry, and the kids’ movie Show Dogs.\n\nRosen Plaza: Your Hotel for Orlando Concerts"
