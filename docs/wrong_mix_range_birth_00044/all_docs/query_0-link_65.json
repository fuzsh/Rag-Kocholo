Script error: No such module \"Respell\".)[3][4][n 1] is a Barbadian singer, songwriter, actress, fashion designer, and businesswoman. Born in Saint Michael and raised in Bridgetown, Barbados, Rihanna was discovered by American record producer Evan Rogers who invited her to the United States to record demo tapes. After signing with Def Jam in 2005, she soon gained recognition with the release of her first two studio albums, Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl Like Me (2006), both of which were influenced by Caribbean music and peaked within the top ten of the US Billboard 200 chart.\n\nRihanna's third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), incorporated elements of dance-pop and established her status as a sex symbol in the music industry. The chart-topping single \"Umbrella\" earned Rihanna her first Grammy Award and catapulted her to global stardom. She continued to mix pop, dance, and R&B genres on her next studio albums, Rated R (2009), Loud (2010), Talk That Talk (2011), and Unapologetic (2012), the latter of which became her first Billboard 200 number one. The albums spawned a string of chart-topping singles, including \"Rude Boy\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\", \"What's My Name?\", \"S&M\", \"We Found Love\", \"Where Have You Been\" and \"Diamonds\". Her eighth album, Anti (2016), showcased a new creative control following her departure from Def Jam. It became her second US number one album and featured the chart-topping single \"Work\". During her musical career, Rihanna has collaborated with many artists, such as Drake, Eminem, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Adam Levine, Paul McCartney, Ne-Yo, and Shakira.\n\nWith sales of over 250 million records worldwide, Rihanna is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She has earned 14 number-ones and 31 top-ten singles in the US and 30 top-ten entries in the UK. Her accolades include nine Grammy Awards, 13 American Music Awards (including the Icon Award), 12 Billboard Music Awards, six Guinness World Records, and the NAACP's President's Award. Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012 and 2018. Forbes ranked her among the top ten highest-paid celebrities in 2012 and 2014. As of 2021, she is the wealthiest female musician, with an estimated net worth of $1.7 billion.[5]\n\nAside from music, Rihanna is known for her involvement in humanitarian causes, entrepreneurial ventures, and the fashion industry. She is the founder of the nonprofit organisation Clara Lionel Foundation, cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, and fashion house Fenty under LVMH; she is the first black woman to head a luxury brand for LVMH.[6] Rihanna has also ventured into acting, appearing in major roles in Battleship (2012), Home (2015), Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017), and Ocean's 8 (2018). She was appointed as an ambassador of education, tourism, and investment by the Government of Barbados in 2018, and was declared a National Hero of Barbados on the first day of the country's parliamentary republic in 2021, entitling her to the style of \"The Right Excellent\" for life.[2]\n\nPage Template:TOC limit/styles.css has no content.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nRobyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados.[7] She is the daughter of accountant Monica (née Braithwaite) and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty.[8][9] Her mother is an Afro-Guyanese, while her father is a Barbadian of African, Irish, English, and Scottish descent.[10][11][12][13] Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships.[14][15] She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. Rihanna's father used to physically abuse her mother, and Rihanna would try to get in between them to break up fights.[16]\n\nAs a child, Rihanna had many CT scans for the excruciating headaches she suffered, recalling, \"The doctors even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense.\"[14] By the time she was 14, her parents had divorced, and her health began to improve.[9][17] She grew up listening to reggae music.[14][18] She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere School, where she studied alongside future international cricketers Chris Jordan and Carlos Brathwaite.[19][14] Rihanna was an army cadet in a sub-military programme, where the later Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant.[20] Although she initially wanted to graduate from high school, she chose to pursue a musical career instead.[21]\n\nMusic career[]\n\n2003–2006: Beginnings and early releases[]\n\nIn 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates.[14] She was discovered in her home country of Barbados by American record producer Evan Rogers. Without a name or any material, the girl group managed to land an audition with Rogers who commented, \"The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.\"[14] Rihanna went to Rogers's hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's \"Emotion\" and Mariah Carey's \"Hero\".[22] Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with Rihanna's mother present and then invited Rihanna to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes that could be sent to record labels.[22] Recordings were intermittent, taking about a year, because she was only able to record during school holidays. \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\" were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album Music of the Sun.[23] That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers's and Carl Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.[22]\n\nRihanna's demo was shipped out to Def Jam Recordings, where Jay Brown, an A&R executive at the record label, was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for rapper Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam.[24] When Jay-Z first heard the track \"Pon de Replay\", he felt the song was too big for her.[25] Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to audition for the label. In early 2005, Rihanna auditioned for Def Jam in New York City, where Jay-Z introduced her to music mogul Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid.[22][26] At the audition, she sang Whitney Houston's cover of \"For the Love of You\", as well as the demo tracks \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\".[22] Jay-Z was absolutely certain about signing her after she performed her future single \"Pon de Replay\".[25] His boss, L.A. Reid, was also impressed with her audition, telling Jay-Z not to let Rihanna leave the building until the contract was signed.[27] Reid left it to Jay-Z and his team to close the deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam. She waited in Jay-Z's office until 3:00 in the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with another label.[25] Rihanna canceled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to the United States to live with Rogers and his wife.[28]\n\nAfter signing with Def Jam, Jay-Z and his team did the A&R for Rihanna's debut album and spent the next three months recording and completing her debut album.[27] She worked with different producers to complete her debut studio album, primarily Rogers and his production partner Carl Sturken.[29] With several songs to pick as a lead single, \"Pon de Replay\" was chosen because it seemed like the best song suited for a summer release.[30] In May 2005, her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\", was released under her mononym \"Rihanna\". It charted successfully worldwide, peaking in the top five in fifteen countries, including at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart.[31] The song became a club hit in the United States, peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs.[32]\n\nMusic of the Sun was released in August 2005. It debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 and received a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over 500,000 units.[33] The album sold over 2 million copies worldwide. A second single, \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\", was not as successful as its predecessor, but reached the top 10 in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.[34] Aside from her work in music, Rihanna made her acting debut in a cameo role in the successful straight-to-DVD film Bring It On: All or Nothing, released in August 2006.[35]\n\nA month after the release of her debut album, Rihanna began working on her second studio album.[36] A Girl like Me was released in April 2006.[37] Rolling Stone felt that \"the burning rock guitar\" and haunted strings of some of the album's tracks made \"A Girl like Me [...] likable.\"[38] The album was a commercial success, charting in the top 10 in 13 countries. The album reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 5 in the United Kingdom and the United States, where it sold 115,000 copies in its first week.[33][39] The album became Rihanna's first to be certified Platinum by the RIAA, after selling over 1,000,000 units.[40] Its lead single, \"SOS\", was an international success, charting in the top five in 11 countries. The song reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and in Australia, her first to reach this chart position.[41] \"Unfaithful\", the album's second single, reached the top 10 in 18 countries, including No. 1 in Canada and Switzerland.[42] Two more singles were released from the album: \"We Ride\" and \"Break It Off\".[43][44]\n\n2007–2008: Breakthrough with Good Girl Gone Bad[]\n\nIn early 2007, Rihanna appeared on the single \"Roll It\" with Jamaican band J-Status and fellow Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle. The song appeared on J-Status' debut album The Beginning, released in several European countries only. Around that time, Rihanna had already begun work on her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad.[45] With the help of producers Timbaland, Tricky Stewart and Sean Garrett she embraced a new musical direction through uptempo dance tracks.[46][47] Released in May 2007, the album charted at No. 2 in Australia and the US and topped the charts in multiple countries, including Brazil, Canada, Ireland and the UK.[48] The album received the most positive critical reviews of her first three albums.[49]\n\nThe lead single, \"Umbrella\", topped the charts in 13 countries and remained at No. 1 in the UK for 10 consecutive weeks, the longest-running No. 1 single there since Wet Wet Wet's single \"Love Is All Around\" spent 15 weeks at the top in 1994.[50][51] It was Rihanna's first single to be named one of the best-selling singles worldwide, with sales of over 8 million copies.[52][53] The songs \"Shut Up and Drive\", \"Hate That I Love You\" (featuring Ne-Yo), and \"Don't Stop the Music\" were also released as singles, with the latter becoming an international hit. In support of the album, Rihanna began the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in September 2007, with 80 shows across the US, Canada, and Europe.[54] Rihanna was nominated for several 2008 Grammy Awards for Good Girl Gone Bad, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Umbrella\" alongside Jay-Z, her first Grammy Award.[55]\n\nOn June 9, 2008, Rihanna released Good Girl Gone Bad Live, her first live long-form video. The DVD and Blu-ray release featured Rihanna's concert at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, United Kingdom, held on December 6, 2007, as part of the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour. The release also contained a special documentary that presented Rihanna discussing her experiences during the tour. By late 2008, Rihanna still remained on the charts with the release of the fifth single from Good Girl Gone Bad, \"Rehab\", and was named \"Diva of the Year\" by Entertainment Weekly for her \"newfound staying power\".[56] Good Girl Gone Bad has sold over 2.8 million units in the United States alone, receiving a two-times-Platinum certification from the RIAA. It is Rihanna's best-selling album in the country to date.[33][57] The album has sold 9 million units worldwide.[58][59]\n\nDuring the late 2000s, Rihanna experimented further with pop, dubstep, and rock music, officially shifting her musical style and image away from the Barbados island girl.[60] Throughout 2008, Rihanna performed on the Glow in the Dark Tour alongside Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and N.E.R.D.[61] Her third studio album's reissue, Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, was released in June 2008 with three new songs: \"Disturbia\", \"Take a Bow\" and the Maroon 5 duet \"If I Never See Your Face Again\", plus a Spanglish version of \"Hate That I Love You\" featuring Spanish pop singer David Bisbal.[62] All four were released as singles and charted highly, reaching peak positions worldwide.[63][64][65] In August 2008, Rihanna and a host of other female singers recorded the charity single \"Just Stand Up!\", the theme song to the anti-cancer campaign Stand Up to Cancer.[66] \"Live Your Life\", a duet between T.I. and Rihanna, was released that November and topped the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n2009–2011: Rated R and Loud[]\n\nOn February 8, 2009, Rihanna's scheduled performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards was cancelled.[67] Reports surfaced that then-boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, had physically assaulted her. He was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats.[68] On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats.[69] A leaked photograph from the police department obtained by TMZ.com revealed that Rihanna had sustained visible injuries.[70] A few months after the incident, Rihanna was featured on the single \"Run This Town\" by Jay-Z, which also featured Kanye West and was released as the second single from Jay-Z's eleventh studio album The Blueprint 3.[71]\n\nIn early 2009, Rihanna began working on her fourth studio album, Rated R.[72] Rated R was released in November 2009.

It's decidedly unfriendly, made to give orders\".[167]\n\nPage Template:Quote box/styles.css has no content.\n\nScript error: No such module \"Check for unknown parameters\".\n\nGrowing up in Barbados, she mainly listened to reggae, hip hop and soca music.[169] When she first came to the US, she was exposed to different types of music with \"rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [Now] I love rock music.\"[169] During her debut, she recorded songs that were inspired by her Caribbean roots and described her early sound as \"a fusion of reggae, hip-hop and R&B, with a little something different thrown in\".[26][170] Her early dancehall roots can be found on her debut album, Music of the Sun, and its follow-up, A Girl like Me.[171] Her debut album demonstrates the influence of Rihanna's musical heritage of the Caribbean. Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times complimented its combination of dancehall and reggae, who said, \"Dancehall reggae sometimes seems like a furiously insular form of music, but ... Rihanna is only the latest singer to discover how versatile the genre's spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be\".[172] Her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\" features a dancehall-pop mixture that infuses a reggae style, while \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" talks about a girl seducing a guy to be her boyfriend.[34] Aiming for artistic growth, A Girl like Me expresses personal experiences that typical 18-year-old girls go through with ballads that were described as elegant and mature.[173] After her second album, she slowly dismissed her dancehall and reggae roots.\n\nRihanna's musical career has been an experiment with new musical ideas and stated that she wants \"to make music that could be heard in parts of the world that I'd never been to\".[174] With its provocative subject matter and lyrics, she began incorporating a wide range of genres including, pop, R&B, reggae, dubstep, hip hop and EDM.[175] During a review for Good Girl Gone Bad, Slant Magazine to write that Rihanna \"finally figured out that she's a dance artist and the majority of the album is Template:Sic uptempo dance-pop [songs like]\" \"Push Up on Me\" and \"Don't Stop the Music\".[176] It represents a departure from the Caribbean sound of her previous albums and is described as a turning point in her career.[177][178] While the first half of the record shares many 1980s pop influences with songs like \"Don't Stop the Music\" and \"Shut Up and Drive\", the second half retreats into standard R&B.[14][179]\n\nRecorded after the assault by her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown, Rated R had a much darker tone and was filled with various emotions she experienced throughout 2009.[180] In her fifth album Loud, Rihanna reflects on the fun and energetic vibe she had while recording the album.[88] The album is a mixture of ballads, party anthems and empowering love songs.[181] Talk That Talk was similar to Rated R, as both contain hip hop, R&B, dancehall and dubstep genres.[182] Loud and Talk That Talk saw her explore sexuality in her work (\"S&M\" and \"Birthday Cake\") and return to her dancehall roots (\"Man Down\" and \"Watch n' Learn\").[183] She also branched out into house music with tracks like \"We Found Love\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\" and \"Complicated\".[184] Her songs are also inspired through record sampling from other artists.[185]\n\nInfluences[]\n\nRihanna has named Madonna as her idol and biggest influence. She said that she wanted to be the \"black Madonna\" and praised her ability to reinvent herself throughout her career.[186] She noted, \"I think that Madonna was a great inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world.\"[186] Another major influence on Rihanna's music and career has been Mariah Carey, whose song \"Hero\" she performed when Rihanna was still a teenager at her high school talent show.[187] She revealed that Carey's song \"Vision of Love\" \"was the song that made [her] want to do music.\"[188][189]\n\nIn her youth, she would see Bob Marley on television because of his fame in the Caribbean.[190] She stated, \"He's one of my favourite artists of all time – he really paved the way for every other artist out of the Caribbean\".[191] She built a shrine in her home dedicated to the reggae legend and has covered Marley's \"Is This Love\" and Bob Marley & The Wailers' \"Redemption Song\" during her concert tours.[192][193] During her childhood, she would go around singing Whitney Houston songs and \"A Whole New World\" into her hairbrush so much that her neighbors started calling her \"Robyn Redbreast\".[28] She also stated that one of the first songs she remembers falling in love with was Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" and that it \"was really inspiring, and it made me develop a passion for music, so really, she's partly responsible for me being here in this industry.\"[194][195]\n\nRihanna was also influenced by Janet Jackson, Aaliyah, Beyoncé and Destiny's Child.[196][197][198][199] Other musical influences and idols include Celine Dion,[200] Grace Jones,[201] Lil' Kim,[202] Alicia Keys,[203] Prince,[204] Fefe Dobson,[205][206] and Brandy.[14]Rihanna takes influence from the different types of music she discovered when she came to America and revealed that rock music was one of the first genres she fell in love with.[169] She commented, \"as I grow older, I want to know more about music. I want to discover more types of music\".[14] She cited Brandy's fourth studio album, Afrodisiac (2004), as her main inspiration for her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007).[14] In her early career, her music contained strong influences of Caribbean music, including reggae and dancehall.[207] The music video of the song \"Rude Boy\" featured images inspired by her Caribbean roots.[207]\n\nVideos and stage[]\n\nRihanna has worked with music video director Anthony Mandler on more than a dozen music videos, the first being \"Unfaithful\" (2006).[208] \"We've done 16 videos together; they're not all tough, [...] Yeah, I mean, I'm known for the 'Disturbia's and the 'Russian Roulette's and things like that, but 'Only Girl (In the World)' is certainly an ethereal kind of empowering, beauty-filled video,\" Mandler said.[208] Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, \"Rihanna, like Madonna, also has a tendency to make truly thought-provoking music videos that fit the songs they represent. Smattered in between glitzier, more glamorous clips, Madge and Ri want us to think about bigger issues\".[184] Jon Bream of the Star Tribune commented \"[i]n the tradition of Madonna and Janet Jackson, Rihanna has become the video vixen of the '00s ... Rihanna has perfected the pout, the long-legged strut and trend-setting hairdos that keep women and men alike checking her out on YouTube.\"[209] George Epaminondas of InStyle considers Rihanna's music videos to be \"cinematic\" due to her \"blend of lush island rhythms and swinging pop and ... mischievous sensuality.\"[210]\n\nMany of her music videos were shot as short films exploring issues such as love triangles, abuse and substance abuse romance, including \"We Found Love\" and \"Man Down\".[184] Her music video for \"Umbrella\" shows Rihanna's transition into adulthood and her newly adopted image.[211] The \"dark, creepy\" scenes of \"Disturbia\" have been compared to Michael Jackson's Thriller.[209][212] The video for \"Russian Roulette\" features Rihanna in a padded room playing a game of russian roulette with her partner. A scene of Rihanna being approached by a speeding car at night was compared to the altercation with Chris Brown.[213] In 2011, Rihanna released three controversial music videos about sadomasochism, rape and domestic violence.[214] \"Man Down\", which features Rihanna shooting a man in a train station, was criticized by the Parents Television Council.[215] \"We Found Love\", which shows Rihanna and her love interest in a drug-filled unhealthy relationship,[213] sparked criticism from the Rape Crisis Centre for its message.[216] Charne Graham of the Houston Press defended her, asking, \"Why should Rihanna's music videos get everyone riled up when others' equally sexual and controversial videos are in rotation? [...] she just like[s] to make music videos that give us something to talk about.\"[214] Rihanna was the first woman to pass 2 billion cumulative views on the music video website Vevo.[217] As of December 2016, she has accumulated over 10 billion views on the site.\n\nDenis Armstrong of Canadian Online Explorer commented on her performance at the Ottawa Bluesfest, saying \"her show was a Disney-esque choreographed fantasy of non-stop hip-swiveling, sassy attitude and personal endearments and a string of funky, sugar-free hits.\"[218] Her performance of \"Disturbia\" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards was ranked tenth best on the MTV Video Music Awards, according to a Billboard poll.[219] Her revealing leather costumes during her Good Girl Gone Bad Tour were highly criticized by Malaysia's conservative Islamic party, who recommended that her concert tour should be banned.[220] Whilst commenting on her third album's accompanying tour, The Times compared Rihanna's stage wardrobe styling to that of Janet Jackson and called her \"a vision of Ann Summers couture in thigh-high boots and a few scraps of black PVC.\"[221] In the October 2011 issue of British Vogue, Rihanna said her performance outfits and appearances are all an act; \"[t]hat's not me. That's a part I play. You know, like it's a piece of art, with all these toys and textures to play with\".[222]\n\nPublic image[]\n\nKnown for her style and image, the evolution of Rihanna's music and fashion sense have been constantly followed by the media.[223] In 2009, New York magazine described Rihanna's early look as that of \"a cookie-cutter teen queen\", noting she has the ability \"to shift looks dramatically and with such ease\".[224] Around the time of the release of her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé.[225][226] In an interview with Look magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyoncé: \"Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but we're different performers with different styles\".[227] She revealed during Oprah's Next Chapter that Def Jam's pop-princess blueprint made her feel claustrophobic during her early years with the label.[228] According to Rihanna, \"I felt like they were giving me a blueprint. [...] They had a brand, they had an idea of what they wanted me to be without figuring out who I was.\"[229] With the release of her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron's bob cut in the science fiction thriller Æon Flux (2005).[230] She followed the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera who also shed their innocent image for an edgier look and sound.[231]\n\nNico Amarca of Highsnobiety magazine wrote \"over the course of her now 10-year career, [Rihanna] has undergone one of the most significant aesthetic metamorphoses the world has ever seen\".[232] Her image and fashion has changed several times with different hairstyles since the release of her third album.[233][234] She commented that as a child she \"used to watch her [mother] get dressed\" and that her love and admiration for fashion started with her mom.[235] When putting together her own wardrobe she stated, \"It's become more about taking a risk ... I always look for the most interesting silhouette or something that's a little off.\"[236] Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian wrote that \"Rihanna's wardrobe is the most talked-about, influential and dissected in pop right now\" and that whatever she wears \"is immediately reproduced on the high street, because it sells\".[237] Country singer Miranda Lambert admires Rihanna's fashion and style stating, \"I don't necessarily get inspired by the whole no-bra thing, but I love that you never know what she's going to wear. It always keeps you guessing, which makes her sassy and interesting.\"[238]\n\nIn an interview with Alexa Chung during Vogue Festival 2015, Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing praised Rihanna by stylistically comparing her to some of the biggest fashion icons in music history, such as Madonna, David Bowie, Michael Jackson, and Prince.[239] Commenting on the cultural expectation for pop stars to be role models, Rihanna said \"[being a role model] became more of my job than I wanted it to be. But no, I just want to make music. That's it.\"[222] In a May 2013 interview with MTV, The Vagina Monologues writer and feminist Eve Ensler said, \"I'm a huge Rihanna fan, I think she has a kind of agency over her sexuality and she's open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she's immensely talented.\"[240] [241]\n\nDescribed as one of the sexiest women of her generation,[242][243] she revealed that being a sex symbol is not a priority and that \"it's definitely flattering, but also uncomfortable.\"[244] Her appearance has landed her on the cover of magazines such as Maxim, FHM, Rolling Stone,[245] and in December 2012, Rihanna became the first woman to be featured on the cover of GQ magazine's \"Men of the Year\" issue.[245]\n\nRihanna made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2007.[246] She has made eight appearances in the years since; notably in 2015, for China: Through the Looking Glass, her Guo Pei-designed yellow dress garnered the most attention of the event, accruing a billion impressions on social media.[247] The dress, which had taken two years to make before Rihanna came across it,[248] became the subject of a documentary by Pietra Brettkelly, entitled Yellow Is Forbidden.[249] She co-chaired the 2018 Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination themed event, wearing Maison Margiela.[250]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nRihanna is regarded by the media as a pop and fashion icon, particularly since her third studio album Good Girl Gone Bad (2007).[251][252][253][254][255] Nick Levine of Digital Spy described Good Girl Gone Bad as \"the closest thing to a Thriller that 2007/08 is likely to produce\".[256] According to Rolling Stone, her single \"Umbrella\" and her eighth album Anti are regarded as among the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, respectively.[257][258] Her single \"We Found Love\" was ranked by Billboard as the 24th biggest US Billboard Hot 100 hit of all time[107] and her single \"Work\" has been credited by a Billboard editor for bringing the dancehall genre to the forefront of mainstream American music.[259] Music critic Jayson Greene of Pitchfork described Rihanna as the most influential singer of the past decade, writing:\n\n\"Rihanna Voice has become an industry-wide idea, a creative property like the Korg synth or LinnDrum [...] We crave the thrill that you can only get when a dozen or so good ideas manifest themselves in a single voice. For the past 10 years, that voice has more or less been Rihanna's. Now that she's gleefully shredding it apart, she'll probably generate a whole new comet trail of Rihannabes. Inevitably, none of them will carry the charge, the glassy cool and subterranean heat, of the real thing.\"[260]\n\nTime magazine included Rihanna on its 100 Most Influential People in the World issue in 2012 and 2018,[261] with Stella McCartney writing: \"She's one of the coolest, hottest, most talented, most liked, most listened to, most followed, most impressive artists at work today, but she does it in her own stride. She works hard, very hard. She gives to her fans, friends and foundation not just herself but her energy and spirit.\"[262] Rihanna was ranked one of the best dressed women in 2018, by luxury fashion retailer Net-a-Porter.[263] On June 2, 2014, Rihanna was presented with the Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award from Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), a special prize reserved for \"an individual whose style has made a significant impact on popular culture on an international stage\".[264] In August 2018, Billboard ranked Rihanna as the tenth biggest Hot 100 artist of all time, as well as the fifth biggest female act of all time.[265][266] Billboard also ranked Rihanna the top Hot 100 artist of the 2010s decade.[267] In 2014, Time magazine's pop stardom ranking metric ranked Rihanna second in history, based on all-time chart performance and contemporary significance.[268]\n\nRihanna has become a dominating figure on social media and internet streaming, ranking at No. 1 on Forbes' 2012 list of Social Networking Superstars.[269] In 2013, Rihanna was also named the most influential pop star in the United Kingdom by UK channel 4Music.[270] Rihanna's work has directly influenced numerous artists such as Lorde,[271] Sam Smith,[272] Little Mix, Rita Ora,[273] Billie Eilish,[274] Selena Gomez,[275] Justin Bieber,[276] Ellie Goulding,[277] Kim Petras,[278] Jennie from Blackpink,[279] Marilyn Manson,[280] Jessie J,[281] SZA,[282] Fifth Harmony,[283] Camila Cabello,[284] Demi Lovato,[285] Alexandra Stan,[286] Grimes,[287] Sleater-Kinney,[288] Tegan and Sara,[289][290] Cover Drive,[291] and Cher Lloyd.[292]\n\nRihanna has an honorary title of Ambassador for Culture and Youth in Barbados.[293] On February 22, 2008, former Barbados Prime Minister David Thompson launched the national \"Rihanna Day\" in their country.
