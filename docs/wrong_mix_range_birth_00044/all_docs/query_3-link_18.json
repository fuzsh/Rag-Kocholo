No further details are available at this time,” the statement read.\n\nThe 50-year-old pop star postponed a tour following the release of her 2015 album Unbreakable in order to plan a family. Jackson posted a video on social media at the time, telling fans that she was taking a break from performing live because “there’s been a sudden change” – which triggered false rumours about the musician’s health.\n\nEissa Al Mana is the singer’s first child. Jackson and Wissam Al Mana married in 2012. A statement said the musician and the Qatari businessman were “thrilled” to welcome their son."
