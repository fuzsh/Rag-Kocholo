Janet Jackson has recalled giving birth at the age of 50 in an Instagram post celebrating her child’s third birthday.

On 3 January 2017, Jackson gave birth to a son, Eissa Al Mana, who she shares with businessman and former partner Wissam Al Mana.

The couple were married in 2012 but announced their separation in April 2017.

On Friday, the singer shared a photograph taken during her pregnancy, showing her wearing a white rib-knit dress, a light grey cardigan and a pair of black glasses.

“Three years ago today God blessed me, at the age of 50, with the greatest gift of all. My baby!” she wrote in the caption.

“Happy Bday sweetheart. Mama loves you more than anything else in this world!”

Several of Jackson’s Instagram followers left birthday messages for the three-year-old in the post’s comment section.

“HBD Eissa!” wrote singer Ciara.

“Awww happy birthday to your son. Many blessings for him,” another person said.

Following the announcement that Jackson had given birth to Eissa, her representative stated that she had a “stress-free healthy delivery” and was “resting comfortably”.

In November, the musician spoke about the “patience” that is required when looking after a child.

“I never knew I was as patient as I really am,” the 53-year-old said during an interview on Australian radio show Carrie and Tommy.

“He’s first and foremost in my life. I get up, I go to sleep – everything is about him. He comes first in my life.”
