Plakat is an alternative movie poster company based in Paris, France.

Working on this image was a long but wonderful process, exploring the themes and messages evoked by the classic film.

The film is said by many to be the greatest of all time, due to how important it was in setting the standard and artistic intent for movies of the future. The process involved many sketches and concepts that were explored at great length. Ultimately we landed on the concept that provided a balance of simple elegance with room for exploring the themes famously explored in the movie.

All text was also hand-illustrated by the illustrator.
