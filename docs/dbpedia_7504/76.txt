Photo Print 40 x 30cm

Original FUJIFILM Crystal Archive photo paper with brilliant colour reproduction. Glossy photo paper features a smooth and shiny top layer with bright colours of high quality giving sharp details and strong contrasts. Lustre photo paper features a stylish, non-reflective top layer that offers remarkable smoothness while maintaining colour accuracy and contrast. Size refers to the size of paper used.

Our Photo Prints are in a large range of sizes and are printed on Archival Quality Paper for excellent colour reproduction and longevity. They are ideal for framing (our Framed Prints use these) at a reasonable cost. Alternatives include cheaper Poster Prints and higher quality Fine Art Paper, the choice of which is largely dependant on your budget.
