Description: My film poster for The Third Man is my tribute to one of the greatest films of all time, and my very favorite film noir. From the eerie, unique zither music soundtrack to the striking cinematography to the beautiful Vienna, Austria setting to the brilliant writing and directing to the exceptional acting, The Third Man is, quite simply, a perfect film.

Description: Version 3 of my artwork for The Third Man featuring the inimitable Orson Welles recalls one of the greatest and coolest screen entrances of all time, as Harry Lime attempts to hide in the dark from Holly Martins, but the apartment light illuminates just his face along with a very Welles-ian coy grin, revealing the shocking truth that he is in fact very much alive.
