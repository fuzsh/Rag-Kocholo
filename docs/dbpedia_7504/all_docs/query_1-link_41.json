        "text": "The man behind this iconic 1991 film has died. The director John Singleton was 51 years old. His family took him off life support after he had a stroke earlier this month. He’s best known as the director and screenwriter of “Boyz N the Hood,” a coming-of-age story of three black teenagers in South Central Los Angeles. “Wait a minute — hey. Man, this is family business.” The film earned him an Oscar nomination for best director, becoming the first African-American nominee, as well as the youngest, in that category. He was also nominated for best original screenplay. His hometown of Los Angeles featured prominently in many of his films. “You know, at film school they always teach you write about what you know. And I was like, wow, you know, this is what I know. This is where I’m from. So, I can do something different. I can make something that is really about where we’re from in South Central Los Angeles.” Singleton took an early interest in film during his younger years. “My mother used to take my little rolls of film to the lab and get them made for me — developed for me in high school. So, I wouldn’t be — I wouldn’t be where I am if it wasn’t for my mother. Growing up, he was influenced by “Cooley High” and Spike Lee’s “She’s Gotta Have It.” After “Boyz N the Hood,” he would go on to direct in a variety of genres. He went on to inspire and mentor many African-American filmmakers and actors."
