One of his greatest gifts was being able to spread his passion for filmmaking to peers and future generations, something that his writing still does every day on this site. He has written about Satyajit Ray‘s “Apu Trilogy” several times, recognizing in these films a deep well of humanity, and perfect examples of what Ebert called the empathy machine. These are lives so different from our own, and yet so easy to emotionally understand because of Ray’s deeply humanistic storytelling. He was quite simply one of the best to ever do it, and I love that Criterion has chosen this box set to upgrade to their stellar 4K collection, not just giving the films a typical home entertainment polish but working on 4K restorations with the Academy Film Archive and L’Immagine Ritrovata. This excellent collection also includes a great array of archival and more recent bonus features. It’s a must-own.\n\nBuy it here\n\nSpecial Features\n\n4K digital restorations of all three films, undertaken in collaboration with the Academy Film Archive at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and L’Immagine Ritrovata, with uncompressed monaural soundtracks on the 4K UHD and Blu-ray editions\n\nIn the 4K UHD edition: Three 4K UHD discs of the films and three Blu-rays with the films and special features\n\nAudio recordings from 1958 of director Satyajit Ray reading his essay “A Long Time on the Little Road” and in conversation with film historian Gideon Bachmann\n\nInterviews with actors Soumitra Chatterjee, Shampa Srivastava, and Sharmila Tagore; camera assistant Soumendu Roy; and film writer Ujjal Chakraborty\n\nMaking “The Apu Trilogy”: Satyajit Ray’s Epic Debut, a video essay by Ray biographer Andrew Robinson\n\n“The Apu Trilogy”: A Closer Look, a program featuring filmmaker, producer, and teacher Mamoun Hassan\n\nExcerpts from the 2003 documentary The Song of the Little Road, featuring composer Ravi Shankar\n\nThe Creative Person: “Satyajit Ray,” a 1967 documentary short by James Beveridge, featuring interviews with Ray, several of his actors, members of his creative team, and film critic Chidananda Das Gupta\n\nFootage of Ray receiving an honorary Oscar in 1992\n\nPrograms on the restorations by filmmaker Kogonada\n\nPLUS: Essays by critics Terrence Rafferty and Girish Shambu, as well as a selection of Ray’s storyboards for Pather Panchali\n\n“Blood Simple” (Criterion)\n\nA child of the ’80s, the early run of films by Joel and Ethan Coen was a formative chapter of my early film-loving. In fact, I even wrote a college film class paper on the thematic connections in their first four films: “Blood Simple,” “Raising Arizona,” “Miller's Crossing,” and “Barton Fink.” (I wish I could find it somewhere. It’s probably in storage.) By the time I was a full-fledged film watcher, the Coens’ stunning debut had already garnered attention around the world, but it still felt a bit underrated through most of their career, only really rising to the top tier of their career in the last decade or so. A great Criterion release helped, and it’s nice to see that edition given a 4K transfer that’s been approved by the creators, including the Coens and cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld. The future director of “Get Shorty” also joins his collaborators on a great conversation about the film, accompanied by an even-better one between the Coens and the great Dave Eggers. All Criterion releases of Coen films are worth picking up. This one is no different.\n\nBuy it here\n\nSpecial Features\n\nRestored 4K digital transfer, approved by cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld and filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen, with 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack\n\nOne 4K UHD disc of the film presented in Dolby Vision HDR and one Blu-ray with the film and special features\n\nConversation between Sonnenfeld and the Coens about the film’s look, featuring Telestrator video illustrations\n\nConversation between author Dave Eggers and the Coens about the film’s production, from inception to release\n\nInterviews with composer Carter Burwell, sound editor Skip Lievsay, and actors Frances McDormand and M. Emmet Walsh\n\nTrailers\n\nEnglish subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing\n\nPLUS: An essay by novelist and critic Nathaniel Rich\n\n“Chantal Akerman Masterpieces, 1968-1978″ (Criterion)\n\nIt’s hard to believe it’s been over a year since the Sight & Sound poll revealed that Chantal Akerman’s “Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai de Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles” had been chosen by critics as the best film of all time. To kick off 2024, Criterion has included that masterpiece with seven other Akerman films from the era, including the beloved “Saute ma ville” and “Je tu il elle.” Not enough? How about an unfinished film from Akerman herself that hasn’t been available on disc before titled “Hanging Out Yonkers”? Want more? A new program by B. Ruby Rich, a new visual essay, and a documentary made during the filming of “Dielman.” This box is a bar-setter for the year, a great collection of films with supplemental material that enhances the appreciation of not just these works but an entire career and an artist’s place in film history.\n\nBuy it here\n\nSpecial Features\n\nNew 4K digital restoration of Les rendez-vous d’Anna and 2K digital restorations of Saute ma ville; L’enfant aimé ou Je joue à être une femme mariée; La chambre; Hotel Monterey; Le 15/8; Je tu il elle; Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles; and News from Home, with uncompressed monaural soundtracks\n\nHanging Out Yonkers, an unfinished film from 1973 by Chantal Akerman\n\nFilm-school tests by Akerman\n\nNew program on Akerman featuring critic B. Ruby Rich\n\nNew visual essay on Akerman featuring archival interviews\n\nAutour de “Jeanne Dielman,” a documentary made during the filming of Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, shot by actor Sami Frey and edited by Agnès Ravez and Akerman\n\nInterviews with Akerman, cinematographer Babette Mangolte, actors Aurore Clément and Delphine Seyrig, and Akerman’s mother, Natalia\n\nAppreciation by filmmaker Ira Sachs\n\nPLUS: An essay and notes on the films by critic Beatrice Loayza\n\n“Coming Home”\n\nHal Ashby‘s films are often portrayed as light-hearted or whimsical due to the continued adoration for films like “Being There” and “Harold & Maude.” However, one of his best films, and one of Roger’s favorite films of Ashby’s, was this 1978 war drama. Less of a commentary on the recently-ended Vietnam War than a detailed character study starring three of the best actors of the ’70s, “Coming Home” was a massive critical and commercial darling, landing in the top 20 grossing films of 1978, and winning Jon Voight the Best Actor Prize at that year’s Cannes Film Festival, starting his track to winning the Oscar in the same category. It also won Jane Fonda an Academy Award, and won for the excellent screenplay by Waldo Salt and Robert C. Jones. Forty-five years later, Kino Lorber has re-released the film on Blu-ray with an audio commentary that features Voight, Bruce Dern, and the legendary Haskell Wexler.\n\nBuy it here\n\nSpecial Features\n\nAudio Commentary by Actors Jon Voight and Bruce Dern with Cinematographer Haskell Wexler\n\nComing Back Home: Featurette\n\nHal Ashby – A Man out of Time: Featurette\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\n“Cutting Class”\n\nFrom a ’70s Oscar winner to an ’80s B-movie, the Home Entertainment Guide has something for everyone. Every once in a while, I’m blown away by the lavish treatment given a film that history has generally forgotten because it displays a great deal of respect for the fans of a cult classic like “Cutting Class,” the 1989 slasher flick that was known mostly for giving Brad Pitt his first major role. Would it be getting a two-disc 4K special edition release if the casting director hadn’t picked the instantly charming future star of “Ocean's Eleven“? Probably not, but that’s what happened and so this direct-to-video slasher comedy gets an insanely detailed treatment that features a new 4K restoration from Vinegar Syndrome, new artwork, interviews with stars Jill Schoelen & Donovan Leitch, & much more.\n\nBuy it here\n\nSpecial Features\n\nDISC ONE – 4K BLU-RAY\n\nTWO-DISC SET (4K BLU-RAY DISC/BLU-RAY DISC)\n\n4K RESTORATION BY VINEGAR SYNDROME (2018)\n\nAudio: LPCM 2.0 Mono, Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo\n\nOptional English Subtitles\n\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer (2:33, HD)\n\nCollectible LaserVision Mini-Poster\n\nReversible artwork (reverse side features MVD Rewind Collection Artwork and Rewind number sequence)\n\nLimited Edition Slipcover (First Pressing Only)(with Rewind number sequence on right spine)\n\nDISC TWO – BLU-RAY\n\nTWO-DISC SET (4K BLU-RAY DISC/BLU-RAY DISC)\n\nAudio: LPCM 2.0 Mono, Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo\n\nOptional English and Spanish Subtitles\n\nInterview with star Jill Schoelen (20:26, HD)\n\nInterview with star Donovan Leitch (16:25, HD)\n\n“Kill Comparisons” featurette (3:53, HD)\n\n“Find The Killer and Win” VHS Video Store Retailer Promo (4:04, SD)\n\nR-Rated / Edited Version of “Cutting Class” (91 mins, SD)\n\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer (2:33, HD)\n\n“The Devil's Brigade“\n\nThe excellent month for Kino Lorber continues with a 1968 war film starring legends of the time William Holden, Cliff Robertson, and Vince Edwards. Based on the book by Robert H. Adelman and Col. George Walton, “The Devil’s Brigade” was the name given the 1st Special Service Force, a Canadian-American unit in World War II. Andrew V. McLaglen’s film fictionalizes the unit’s first mission in Italy, when they were assigned to take a German stronghold named Monte la Difensa. Fans of Holden, Robertson, or this era of WWII films might want to add this relatively unheraled genre flick to their collection, a Blu-ray that’s accompanied by a commentary track from a historian and expert on combat films.\n\nBuy it here\n\nSpecial Features\n\nAudio Commentary by Filmmaker/Historian Steve Mitchell and Combat Films: American Realism Author Steven Jay Rubin\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\n“Inside the Mind of Coffin Joe” (Arrow)\n\nJosé Mojica Marins is a Brazilian writer, director, and actor who became internationally influential under the stage name of Coffin Joe. Recognizing and hopefully elevating his legacy, Arrow Films has released an incredible box set of his most important work, loaded with special features, and even a collector’s book with new writing on the iconic character and creator. Coffin Joe originally existed only as the bad guy in 1964’s “At Midnight I’ll Take Your Soul,” one of 10 films included in this incredible box set. All of the films have been restored in 4K (as best they can be with the elements available) and simply LOADED with special features. This is one of the best horror box sets in years, a must-own not just for fans of Coffin Joe, but for those who have never heard of him before too.\n\nBuy it here\n\nSpecial Features\n\nBrand new 4K

same movie? What if it’s a movie as phenomenal as Martin Scorsese‘s timeless “Mean Streets”? Because the truth is that last year’s Criterion 4K release of the 1973 classic is a must-own, but so is the newly-issued 4K release by the U.K. company Second Sight, who put the same kind of love and care into their supplemental material as the industry leader. One has to imagine that the 4K transfer is identical, so what potential buyers probably want to know about most of all is the bonus features, which are pretty impressive. The 1973 promo video “Back on the Block” that was included on the Criterion release, along with the scene commentary from Scorsese & Amy Robinson and footage from a 2011 DGA event, do double duty on both editions, but Second Sight also includes a new commentary by two Scorsese experts, a new interview with the producer, and another archival featurette. Most interestingly, they include an entire feature-length documentary titled “Mardik: Baghdad to Hollywood,” about the writer Mardik Martin, who wrote not only “Mean Streets” but “Italianamerican” and “New York, New York.”\n\nBuy it here\n\nSpecial Features\n\nDual format edition including both UHD and Blu-ray with main feature and bonus features on both discs\n\nNew 4K restoration supervised and approved by Director Martin Scorsese and Collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker\n\nRestored original mono audio\n\nUHD presented in Dolby Vision HDR\n\nNew audio commentary by Demetrios Matheou (author of BFI Films Classics Mean Street) and David Thompson (Co-Editor of Scorsese on Scorsese)\n\nScene specific audio commentary with Martin Scorsese and Actor Amy Robinson\n\nKeep Moving Forward: a new interview with Producer Jonathan T Taplin\n\nSaints and Sinners: Dr Catherine Wheatley on Mean Streets\n\n2011 Film at Lincoln Center screening introduction, interview and Q&A with Martin Scorsese\n\nMardik: Baghdad to Hollywood feature-length documentary\n\nArchive featurette: Back on the Block\n\nArchive featurette: Home Movies\n\nTrailer\n\n“Mudbound” (Criterion)\n\nI can still remember the premiere of Dee Rees‘ Oscar nominee at the Sundance Film Festival. It was a stunning blend of old-fashioned storytelling and the powerful thrust of a current filmmaker with something urgent to say. I know the cultural wheel spins faster every passing year, but it feels like we’ve moved on too quickly from this excellent drama, so I’m happy that Criterion has partnered with Netflix to give it such an excellent home release. It includes a new commentary by Rees, two new documentaries, and a new interview with the production designer. The Netflix to Criterion pipeline has been controversial, but the truth is that their best films are getting buried by their own content machine. I’m happy to see Criterion try to unearth this one.\n\nBuy it here\n\nSpecial Features\n\nNew 2K digital master, supervised by director Dee Rees and director of photography Rachel Morrison, with Dolby Atmos soundtrack\n\nNew audio commentary featuring Rees\n\nNew documentary featuring Rees, composer Tamar-kali, editor Mako Kamitsuna, and makeup artist Angie Wells\n\nNew documentary made on set, featuring members of the cast and crew\n\nInterview with Morrison\n\nNew interview with production designer David J.

One of the most important filmmakers of all time could literaly handle any genre. He won Oscars for directing “West Side Story” and “The Sound of Music,” and also happened to edit a little film called “Citizen Kane.” “The Day the Earth Stood Still,” “The Haunting,” “The Sand Pebbles.” The guy is a king. And KL has re-released two of his films from the late ’50s this month, both with new audio commentaries from film historians. “Odds Against Tomorrow” is a noir starring the incredible Harry Belafonte, Robert Ryan, and Ed Begley. It was technically released the year after a banger of a war film called “Run Silent, Run Deep” with two of the biggest stars of all time: Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.\n\nBuy it here\n\n“Odds Against Tomorrow” Special Features\n\nNEW Audio Commentary by Author/Film Historian Alan K. Rode\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\n“Run Silent, Run Deep” Special Features\n\nNEW Audio Commentary by Filmmaker/Historian Steve Mitchell and Combat Films: American Realism Author Steven Jay Rubin\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\n“The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming”\n\nAnother Hal Ashby movie! Sorta. This one was edited by the man behind “Coming Home” but directed by the incredible Norman Jewison, who just recently passed away. Released at a time when the Cold War was really heating, this satirical tale of a Soviet submarine that crashes of the coast of New England has a place in film history as the first major role for the great Alan Arkin, who is just fantastic here. Arkin made an impact from a young age, earning an Oscar nomination for his work in this comedy, alongside nods for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture. Arkin even won the Golden Globe. This is another pretty standard KL release with a historian commentary, but it’s a good collectible for fans of this mid-’60s classic.\n\nBuy it here\n\nSpecial Features\n\nNEW Audio Commentary by Film Historians Michael Schlesinger and Mark Evanier\n\nThe Russians Are Coming to Hollywood: Featurette with Director/Producer Norman Jewison\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\n“Trainspotting” (Criterion)\n\nIt’s hard to believe it’s almost been three decades since Danny Boyle‘s sophomore smash, a movie that feels like it hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves for its cultural impact. As a person who was in college when it was released, I can confirm that this movie felt major, a merging of form and music and culture in a way that felt like it had a vibrant pulse. People have written a great deal about the shift in independent filmmaking in the early ’90s and the impact of Quentin Tarantino, but don’t overlook “Trainspotting,” a movie that felt like nothing else at the time. Criterion hasn’t forgotten, giving the film an incredible 4K release with TONS of special features, including deleted scenes, new interviews, a 2008 documentary, a great music feature, and a commentary that includes both Boyle and Ewan McGregor.\n\nBuy it here\n\nSpecial Features\n\nNew 4K digital restoration of the uncut version of the film, supervised by director Danny Boyle, with 2.0 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack\n\nOne 4K UHD disc of the film presented in Dolby Vision HDR and one Blu-ray with the film and special features\n\nAlternate 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack\n\nAudio commentary featuring Boyle, producer Andrew Macdonald, screenwriter John Hodge, and actor Ewan McGregor\n\nNine deleted scenes with commentary from the filmmakers\n\nNew interview with production designer Kave Quinn and costume designer Rachael Fleming\n\nOff the Rails: The Making of “Trainspotting,” a documentary featuring archival interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes footage\n\nMemories of “Trainspotting,” a documentary from 2008 featuring the filmmakers as well as actors McGregor, Kelly Macdonald, Ewen Bremner, and Robert Carlyle\n\nReflections from soundtrack artists Iggy Pop, Jarvis Cocker, Bobby Gillespie, Damon Albarn, Leftfield, and Underworld\n\nTheatrical teaser and trailer\n\nEnglish subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing\n\nPLUS: Essays by critic Graham Fuller and author Irvine Welsh, Welsh’s glossary of terms from the novel, and limited-edition glow-in-the-dark packaging\n\n“Trolls: Band Together”\n\nThe Trolls never die. They just find a new song to sing. The relatively charming first film came out in 2016, leading to a pandemic era release of “Trolls World Tour” in 2020, two holiday specials, two TV series, and now a third film in this late-2023 theatrical release, getting a quick turnaround to the home market. If you’re more interested in the Robert Wise and Hal Ashby films in this column, you may wonder who is the audience for “Trolls 3.” They’re out there, leading to a film that has made more than $200 million worldwide, a smaller number than some blockbuster animated sequels, but an impressive one nonetheless. The Blu-ray from Universal has a healthy amount of special features too, including deleted scenes, a new short film, making-of footage, and even a brand new commentary. Trolls fans are loyal, and Universal knows how to treat them well.\n\nBuy it here"
