        "text": "Jack Hulbert is a somewhat atypical awful British comedian. Less awful than some, it’s more his undistinguished films that drag him down. He fits the Matthew Sweet formulation of looking like a human being reflected in a tap, but more precisely he looks like an inept drawing of a handsome man. While the stereotypical hero is supposed to have a lantern jaw, the Hulbert chin is more like a melted candle or perhaps a stalactite. Disturbing in a frontal view it surprises with an outward curve when viewed in profile, like its gotten caught in a mechanism. Like most chins, you can’t see it from the back, his neck’s in the way, and this is perhaps a blessing. Who knows what it’d get up to in a dorsal elevation.\n\nTHE CAMELS ARE COMING is a title that brings a smile to my lips, which the film itself rarely manages. It’s not totally cringe, though. Hulbert can do a parody of stiff-upper-lip acting which is quite winning. Rather than being a low-status chump man-child like Formby or Wisdom later on, or a smutty imp like Max Miller or Arthur Askey, Hulbert is more of a twit or silly ass. In his more sympathetic moments he can get you thinking how awkward it must have been to be a posh idiot, automatically placed in a position of power and responsibility by dint of race and birthright that you’re totally unequipped to handle. Then you reflect that there may be better people to feel sorry for in this situation.\n\nTCAC has one thing most Awful British Comedian movies don’t have, which is production values, considerable location shooting having been accomplished in Egypt. It’s inspiring to see Hulbert, in blackface, patrolling the same historic sites Peter Ustinov and Mia Farrow would breeze through in DEATH ON THE NILE. History! The war would put a stop to this kind of foreign entanglement, and most ABCs are men of the sound stage or back lot almost exclusively.\n\nInteresting credits — Tim Whelan, one of the team of piano-movers responsible for directing THIEF OF BAGDAD, is credited here, but the more interesting Robert Stevenson is his uncredited co-helmer. His KING SOLOMON’S MINES and NON-STOP NEW YORK and THE MAN WHO CHANGED HIS MIND are an Imperial ton of fun.\n\nThe fact that this is — maybe — an actual adaptation and spoof of a Biggles novel makes a lot of sense. What doesn’t make sense is that there’s nobody called Biggles in it and original author W.E. Johns gets no credit. I now learn that The Camels are Coming was the very first Biggles book in 1932. Already by 1934 considered too ridiculous to be played straight. Or, as seems possible, maybe they just stole the title. But the movie is about a heroic (but silly) British aviator, pretty much a Biggle parody. (The book derives its title from the Sopwith Camel, as also flown by Snoopy — but the filmmakers were right, it’s clearly a comedy title, even if you don’t immediately get the pun on The Campbells are Coming — which the soundtrack obligingly points out.)\n\nLike CITIZEN KANE this begins with a fake newsreel. There, it’s fair to say, the resemblance ends. Hulbert’s ass or arse character has elements in common with Clouseau — you get the impression he knows he’s a nit, but is not smart enough to know everyone else knows it too, so he has to put on a front to try and keep his incompetence a secret. A man in hell.\n\nBecause Hulbert (whose more distorted brother Claude played silly ass Algie in several BULLDOG DRUMMOND pics) looks more like a travesty of a leading man, less like a genetic throwback to amphibian times, the problem of how to pair him with a convincing leading lady is less hideously awkward than it would be with Formby (who, improbably, co-starred with the gorgeous Googie Withers, Kay Walsh, Phyllis Calvert, Linden Travers, Kathleen Harrison and Elizabeth Allen). The decorous Anna Lee is cast opposite Jack. Her main technique is to grin amusedly in closeup and then be merely smiling, lips closed, when we cut to the wide shot. A fine method if you can master it. She’s winning, but it’s not certain she can act. She’d have to get in with John Ford to prove that.\n\nHulbert is a proper posh boy — educated at Winchester and Cambridge (a Cambridge footlight, like several Pythons, though it was a rather different outfit in his day). He appears in ELSTREE CALLING but likely missed being directed by Hitchcock. He seems to have been a decent chap. Married for many years to Cicely Courtnidge, who sometimes co-starred with him. He was once listed as Britain’s most most popular lead, which shows you.\n\nOh yes, racism. Considering the period, it’s not as awful as it might have been. Jack does black up to pass as Egyptian. Since most of the film’s other Egyptians are also played by white dudes, this isn’t as unconvincing as it’s probably meant to be. The film is about drug smuggling — does this mean it would have been banned in the US? Or maybe it wouldn’t have stood a chance of release there anywhere outside the UK — none of our awful comedians cracked America, though HEY! HEY! USA! (1938) paired Will Hay with Edgar Kennedy in a foredoomed attempt at breaking through to a new and bigger audience. But America always had bigger idiots of their own.\n\n(Wikipedia notes that TCAC never got a US release, also that Anna Lee met and married Robert Stevenson, who’s billed as Associate Producer, on the picture.)\n\nThere are a couple of songs, I have to warn you. There’s an Arab caravan chorus about robbing and killing which is quite cheerful, and then Jack has a gratuitous solo number which is good fun. Speaking of which, here’s a fun drug trip musical number with Melesian trick effects from another Hulbert flick.\n\nBy coincidence, this song is memorably used in MURPHY’S WAR, for which I’ve recently made a video essay (for the Arrow Films Blu-ray release).\n\nTHE CAMELS ARE COMING is mostly harmless, if witless. It took four chumps to write this rubbish, plus Hulbert himself on dialogue. Had the story been stronger, the comic situations been more and funnier, he could have been inspired to greater heights. Still, I can’t say I wouldn’t watch another Hulbert film. BULLDOG JACK has Ralph Richardson in it, and KATE PLUS TEN is a comic thriller based on an Edgar Wallace “shocker.” I find Wallace unreadably dully, despite the fact that one third of novels sold in English used to be written by him, or some such fantastical statistic. Spoofing him seems like the correct approach, though even there he may be too tedious.\n\nNB: Doesn’t actually look much good, apart from an imported Genevieve Tobin.\n\nThe big finish of TCAC, in a besieged fort with Jack shooting Arabs off their camels, is a bit uncomfortable. I don’t recall any films where even Germans in wartime get this kind of treatment — killed as slapstick. It makes you appreciate how careful Keaton was with the very black comedy in THE GENERAL’s battle scene. Other examples of this kind of thing: Tashlin’s SON OF PALEFACE, where the slaughter of Indians for laughs is now very uncomfortable, even though it could be defended as genre parody — alas it’s not really ATTACKING the genre assumptions — and from the same director, the weirdly dislikeable (and I love Tashlin when he’s good) MARRY ME AGAIN, which celebrates Bob “the Butcher of Strasbourg” Cummings’ wartime heroics by having him shoot down countless “Jap” fighter planes, for laffs.\n\nA strange personal resonance — when I were a lad, at the local Odeon in the seventies there was an ad for Rank Cinemas, a montage of unknown film clips, culminating in a closeup of a masticating or ruminating camel, with the words COME – BACK – SOON appearing sequentially over its face. The shot, as I recall, was in black and white, showing how far behind the times Rank had fallen. This movie MAY be the source of the camel shot.\n\nVerdict: Jack Hulbert is Not Entirely Awful, but his films kind of are.\n\nThe two posters above do evince a certain desperation, but most film publicity does. The exclamation marks, bold print, hysterical repetition — this is not the behaviour of a confident form. But here we see perhaps more performance anxiety than usual. The change of title betrays a lack of fixity of purpose, and the decision to brand the film as “something unusual” suggests uncertainty, just as the CITIZEN KANE poster’s “It’s terrific!” conveys less a filmmaker’s bold artistic achievement, more an advertising man’s helpless confusion. Maybe a film poster with HOW DO I SELL THIS? would result in a hit, as a piece of Stan Freberg type honesty in advertising?\n\nMORITURI or “MORITURI” or THE SABOTEUR: CODENAME – “MORITURI” is no KANE, but it’s a lot better than I was expecting, never having learned to love director Bernhard Wicki as much as director Bernhard Wicki loves skin blemishes. Aided immeasurably by cinematographer Conrad Hall he gloats and glories at and in Trevor Howard’s extravagantly cratered mug, then revels in the scars, creases and skin damage of an entire shipload of players. Even Yul Brynner has never looked so pitted — he has little crevasses at the left corner of his mouth not normally perceived by the camera. Brando seems to sprout a great bump on his forehead whenever he furrows his brow, though it vanishes whenever he unwrinkles himself, some kind of subcutaneous continuity error. Maybe an alternative title could be ON THE WARTY FRONT.\n\nThe plot is all about rubber, which seems a hopeless premise — the Brits want to capture a big shipment of NAZI RUBBER and they need German pacifist Brando (good accent) so get on board in disguise and disable the scuttling devices, small bombs planted all over the craft. That’s the plot. I would say it’s not easy to care about a ship full of rubber, but that wouldn’t really be true. It’s impossible to care about a ship full of rubber. MacGuffin as verfremdungseffekt, an alienation device at the heart of the plot, and one not susceptible to defusing. It is of course possible to care about Brando and other characters whose fates become intertwined with this rubbery cargo, and I did to some small extent.\n\nThe film looks great — early on, Hall lights some studio scenes meant to be set in India in a very odd way — twigs cast pin-sharp shadows on the actors in a way that trees in daylight never do. But once we’re on board this real ship it gets terrific, especially in the engine room. Vertiginous angles and near-expressionist concatenations of ducts, pipes, wiring, walkways, hatches, dials, levers, bulbs, scary and oppressive metallic intestines that keep Hall’s nimble camera dancing from one jagged, lurching composition to another.\n\nThere’s also an unusual — that word again — early score by Jerry Goldsmith which is very nice.\n\nThe one extraneous or problematic element is Janet Margolin as a Jewish prisoner picked up from a sunken ship. It’s a zesty performance, maybe a little too much so. But the character is someone we can really care about, more than a hold full of rubber. The film doesn’t seem to realise this, though, or thinks that her narrative purpose should be to be tortured, to torture the audience and thus make us take this thing seriously. It ended up making me feel a bit sick. Daniel CASTLE KEEP Taradash and Walon THE WILD BUNCH Green are implicated.\n\nWith a better story, this could have been really excellent, but thanks to the intersection of Hall and that ship, it’s very watchable, a waste of Brando’s talents arguably but one which allows him to vault about in a tight jumper. A rehearsal for LAST TANGO, then.\n\nMORITURI stars 1st Lt. Fletcher Christian; Rameses; Ellie Fabian; Captain William Bligh; Thomas Mann; Maj. Werner Pluskat; Mr. Robinson J. Peepers; Uncle Max; Grand Admiral Erich Raeder; Harding; Brain Control; Jules Verne; Joseph Goebbels; Emcee at Frankenstein’s Show; Von Ellstein; Dr. Charles Forbin; Horst; and Sulu.\n\nWhat got Dmytryk his big break into A pictures was a double-whammy of sadistic propaganda films. I haven’t seen HITLER’S CHILDREN but I gather it has Nancy Drew being flogged in it. I can now say I’ve seen BEHIND THE RISING SUN — mostly from between my fingers.\n\nit is possible to say that this film makes several mistakes. It features Chinese-american propaganda mainstays like Richard Loo and Philip Ahn doing what they always did, playing evil Japanese. I can accept their casting with something like equanimity since they’re getting payback for what Japan is doing to Mother China, in a way, though I wonder if they also found this stuff kind of degrading? But with these guys on tap it was rather unnecessary to cast white folks in yellowface, though I guess they had to get some stars in there…\n\nBut that won’t really wash, because was there really a huge audience gasping for J, Carroll Naish? No, he’s in it because of the belief that, as a versatile character man, he can play anything. He gets the opportunity to disprove that here, and does so with a ghastly aplomb.\n\nAlso continually hard to look at in wouldn’t-it-be-rubbery eyelids is Tom Neal, who, OK, I guess probably had some kind of “following,” however reluctant. He’s first introduced as a photograph, which already is enough to make the audience’s collective head recoil in horror to a distance of about a foot, and which in no way prepares for the full awfulness of his 24fps moving picture appearance, which comes soon after and then lingers for the whole picture.\n\nAnd then there’s LOST HORIZON’s Margo — because Mexican is kind like Chinese, right? — under contract to RKO and also featured in THE LEOPARD MAN the same year. I can guess which item she kept on her résumé longer. CITIZEN KANE makeup whiz Maurice Seiderman apparently did her lids, proving there is no way to make this kind of thing look good. She’s granted also a Dan Dare widow’s peak, NOT a Japanese fashion, just something that apparently felt appropriately witchy to somebody, “Madness! Madness!” as James Donald is always saying.\n\nThrow in Abner Biberman — another “he can play anything” type for whom the argument disintegrates in real time as you watch — and the cast of fauxrientals is more or less complete. Oh wait, Mike Mazurski, limbering/lumbering up for Moose Malloy in Dmytryk’s first A-picture, MURDER, MY SWEET.\n\nI guess they could melt down his eyelids afterwards and make some jeep tyres.\n\nThe moderately good news is we also get, um, Gloria Holden, Dracula’s Daughter herself, the kind of actor who might be expected to vamp it up as a dragon lady but is here playing an occidental tourist, oh hey Robert Ryan, reliably psychopathic though I think we’re supposed to find him loveable. A man with a cucalorus permanently in his background, maybe it’s somehow shadowing him. There’s a deeply weird scene where he’s picked on by the Japanese cops for shooting at a cat — because how else are they going to show what a dystopian dictatorship Imperial Japan is, if they don’t show an American getting a hard time for shooting at a cat? What kind of country is this?\n\nThe film’s highlight, I guess, is an incredibly protracted fight between Ryan and Mazurki, with RR in boxing gloves and Mazurki doing judo throws and kicks and wrestling moves. I guess this is what they call mixed martial arts. Before we judge too hastily, at around the same time Kurosawa was shooting the same scene, sort of, in the propagandistic sequel he’d been forced to make to SANSHIRO SUGATA. Sanshiro gets in the ring against an African American pugilist… I should watch that so I can answer the question Which is more uncomfortable? which is a question I’m bound to be asked one day.\n\nApart from the racial imposture the other thing wrong with the movie is it kind of scores an own-goal by showing Japanese characters we like — how are we supposed to feel OK about bombing them? But I can’t have it both ways — complaining that there’s disgusting racism and also an attempt to humanize the enemy, or at anyhow suggest that not everyone in this nation IS the enemy. That’s commendable and probably rare if not unique in wartime, when, as I understand it, there was a deliberate attempt to demonize “the Jap”, in counterpoint to the way Germans were portrayed as the victims of evil leader. The explanation I read somewhere was that it was known that Hirohito was going to have to stay, so they couldn’t put all the blame on HIM…\n\nAnyway, weird film. Its most obnoxious element is making Neal’s character an American-educated, likeable guy at first who gets corrupted by Imperialism, which comes close to making the case for the detention of Japanese-Americans, a suggestion that some innate barbarity lurks within the whole people. Maybe the whole of humanity, sure, I’d buy that.\n\nThere is another film, which sounds even more appalling than this — FIRST YANK INTO TOKYO — in which Neal plays a GI who gets “racial reassignment” plastic surgery to go undercover in Japan. I presume once he arrives he finds lots of other Yanks made up as the enemy, and it’s like The Man Who Was Thursday — the whole of Nippon is just Caucasians in phony eyelids and a bunch of cooperative Chinese-American bit-players. I may have to watch it, but this one was enough to last me a while.\n\nBEHIND THE RISING SUN stars Soldadera; Bruce Gentry; Chief Sitting Bull; Smith Ohlrig; Countess Marya Zaleska; Dick Stanley – aka Deadwood Dick; Neb Jolla; Ernie Wright; Saburo Goto (uncredited); Latigo Means; Wang Chi-Yang; Sgt.
