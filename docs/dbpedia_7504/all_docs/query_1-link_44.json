        "text": "I have exciting news to share for my Reel Librarians readers! Last week, I got an email from a Hachette Books editor letting me know that I was in a new book entitled This is What a Librarian Looks Like, by photographer Kyle Cassidy, and that I could get a complimentary copy. My first reaction?\n\nThat‚Äôs so cool! And a free book!\n\nThen my face fell in shock as I looked at the book cover image in the email‚Ä¶ and realized that I was one of the librarians featured on the cover! WHUT?!!!\n\nI then forwarded the email on to my co-workers and shared it on Facebook. And since I was on a Reference Desk shift at my library, I then got back to work. üòâ\n\nMy library ordered a copy of the book for our own collection, and over the next few days, I enjoyed sharing with co-workers how I came to be involved in the project. And now I can share this story with you!\n\nIt was over three years ago when Kyle Cassidy published a photo essay on Slate.com called ‚ÄúThis is What A Librarian Looks Like,‚Äù which quickly became one of their most popular photo essay posts ever. The post got a lot of buzz and prompted a lot of discussion and debate online ‚Äî and in librarian circles. Cassidy had taken portraits of librarians for that piece at that year‚Äôs American Library Association (ALA) Midwinter Conference in Philadelphia, and then I read that the project was coming to the 2014 ALA Annual Conference, which was in Las Vegas that summer. I was going to ALA that year because I was finishing up as committee chair for the ALA International Relations Round Table, so I was going to be there anyway. I thought it would be a neat thing to participate in, and I printed out and completed the photo release form, which included a space to provide a personal comment.\n\nMy husband had gotten me a library card catalog-themed tee at a writer‚Äôs conference that spring, since I have a (growing) collection of librarian-themed tees, which I have previously featured here on this blog. I love wearing library- or librarian-themed clothing at librarian conferences ‚Äî because OF COURSE ‚Äî so I took the Unshelved ‚ÄúNEVER FORGET‚Äù library card catalog t-shirt along with me to wear at the ALA conference. I remember wearing the tee with a tan pencil skirt, metallic sandals, and a denim jacket.\n\nHere‚Äôs a close-up of my Unshelved card catalog tee:\n\nI can picture the librarian photoshoot set-up in my mind; the location was off to one side of a large escalator, kind of tucked into the side. There wasn‚Äôt a huge line (yet) when I arrived, but I do recall long lines later on. The whole thing took less than 10 minutes. I turned in my form and, when called, stepped up to the mark designated on the floor.\n\nThen I smiled and opened my denim jacket to reveal my cheeky card catalog tee ‚Äî and I remember the photographer, Kyle Cassidy, and an assistant beside him, kind of start in surprise. They laughed, which made me smile even bigger. Click, click, click. Cassidy then looked at his camera, said he wasn‚Äôt sure he got the tee, and then asked to take a few more photos. Click, click, click. Then it was done. I thanked them and then went about my conference. I do remember urging other librarians to check it out and participate. [You can also see a ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù bit here on Cassidy‚Äôs website.]\n\nAnd then, honestly, I kind of forgot about it. Until last week! üòÄ\n\nI received my complimentary copy of the book a few days later:\n\nAnd then imagine my surprise when I then realized a couple of things:\n\nThat the editors managed to update both my new job title and my new workplace ‚Äî even though I was working at another library when I took the photo three years ago! I was VERY impressed by this attention to detail. Plus, I was thrilled to bring attention to my current college.\n\nThat an excerpt from the quote I had submitted on the photo release form was chosen as one of the blurbs on the back cover! üòÄ\n\nI went through the book slowly, marveling at the wonderful portraits ‚Äî and giddy that I even personally knew a few names and faces! It is like a librarians‚Äô yearbook that I magically got to be a part of.\n\nI also loved loved loved that my portrait is opposite Captain America! I assume that Young Lee and I were paired together because of our excellent taste in t-shirts. üòÄ\n\nI also looked through the indexes ‚Äî because that is what librarians do, y‚Äôall! ‚Äî and noted my fellow librarians from Washington and cheered librarians from other states I‚Äôve worked in.\n\nI noted the breadth of diversity throughout the book, including diversity of ages, gender, ethnicities, locations, type of libraries, and types of library jobs. I geeked out at Neil Gaiman‚Äôs essay, because Neil Gaiman loves and appreciates librarians and has spoken at several ALA events and programs over the years.\n\nAnd then I came to Kyle Cassidy‚Äôs afterword, and I teared up:\n\nIt‚Äôs been my honor to stand before so many of these people who are fighting daily to bring access and information to the public. Some of them I met for only a few minutes, but in the past two years I‚Äôve looked at their faces and read their words over and over and I feel like I know them.\n\nI‚Äôm one of those he met for only a few minutes, and I continue to be gobsmacked at the thought that he, and others, have looked at my portrait and my library card catalog tee and read my words multiple times these past three years. And now others can, too. Amazing.\n\nAnd it‚Äôs amazing that I‚Äôm one of only a couple hundred librarians and library workers helping to represent thousands of us across the globe. As I recently tried to articulate to a friend on Facebook:\n\nTo *literally* help represent, visually and with words, my profession, in all its diversity and earnestness and commitment to ideals beyond ourselves‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a feeling I can‚Äôt really describe at the moment. A mixture of pride and humility.\n\nYou can also continue to help out this project in several ways:\n\nBuy a copy of the book yourself!\n\nRecommend that your local public library purchase a copy. (Look for a book or purchase recommendation form on your local library‚Äôs website ‚Äî I can tell you from personal experience that we LOVE when users submit purchase recommendations!)\n\nDonate to EveryLibrary, which is hosting a book release party and fundraiser at this summer‚Äôs ALA Annual Conference. EveryLibrary advocates for libraries and library funding across the country.\n\nThanks again to Kyle Cassidy for his visionary work and for everyone else who contributed to this project, who are mentioned in the book‚Äôs back matter.\n\nI am so proud and humbled to be one of the names and faces in This is What a Librarian Looks Like. It is an honor to help represent my profession. And my work here analyzing portrayals of reel librarians would mean nothing without the acknowledgement and appreciation of real librarians.\n\nSources used:\n\n‚ÄúBehind the Scenes Photo Geekery.‚Äù This is What a Librarian Looks Like, KyleCassidy.com.\n\nCassidy, Kyle. This is What a Librarian Looks Like: A Celebration of Libraries, Communities, and Access to Information. Black Dog & Leventhal, 2017.\n\nTeicher, Jordan G. ‚ÄúBehold: This Is What a Librarian Looks Like.‚Äù Slate.com, 11 Feb. 2014.\n\n‚ÄúThis is What a Librarian Looks Like.‚Äù KyleCassidy.com, n.d.\n\nI recently rewatched the 1966 film version of Fahrenheit 451, directed by French New Wave director Francois Truffaut and starring Julie Christie in a dual role and Oscar Werner as Montag, the fireman who falls in love with books, the very thing he‚Äôs charged with burning.\n\n*MAJOR SPOILER ALERTS THROUGHOUT*\n\nHere is one of the original trailers for the film:\n\nThe origins of Fahrenheit 451:\n\nOne of the major themes of the book, and resulting film, is about authoritarian censorship, the kind that led to book-burning in World War II. The finished novel of Fahrenheit 451 was first published in 1953, so this was still fresh in people‚Äôs minds.\n\nThe origins of the book, however, actually go back to 1947-1948, right after the war ended, when Bradbury wrote a short story, ‚ÄúBright Phoenix.‚Äù This story featured a librarian who confronted a book-burning ‚ÄúChief Censor.‚Äù Bradbury turned that story, plus another story in 1951 called ‚ÄúThe Pedestrian‚Äù set in a totalitarian future, into the novella called ‚ÄúThe Fireman,‚Äù which was published in the February 1951 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction. Bradbury relished retelling the story about how he wrote ‚ÄúThe Fireman‚Äù (which essentially serves as the first draft of Fahrenheit 451) in 9 days on a typewriter he rented in the basement of UCLA‚Äôs Powell Library for ten cents per half hour. He then expanded that story into the novel we know today.\n\nIn a dystopian future ‚Äî one again, like in The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, is too eerily familiar to modern times ‚Äî books are forbidden and burned when discovered. In this future, firemen are trained to burn books, rather than prevent fires. Neighbors are encouraged to spy on one another and report those they suspect have books. Information (or rather, propaganda) is spread through television, called ‚Äúwall screens,‚Äù as well as through comics-like publications, as seen in the screenshot below.\n\nThe hidden library scene:\n\nA turning point in the film comes almost exactly halfway through the film, when Montag is called to the house where he knows Clarisse lives. Clarisse is described as Montag‚Äôs ‚Äúrebellious, book-collecting mistress‚Äù on the back of the DVD case, but her role in the film is much tamer than that description suggests. His supervisor, Captain Beatty (played by Cyril Cusack), discovers a ‚Äúhidden library‚Äù in the attic and cannot hold back his glee at the prospect of burning all those books:\n\nI knew it. Of course, all this ‚Äî the existence of a secret library was known in high places, but there was no way of getting at it. Only once before have I seen so many books in one place. I was just an ordinary fireman at the time.\n\nIt‚Äôs all ours, Montag.\n\nOnce to each fireman, at least once in his career, he just itches to know what those books are all about. He just aches to know. Isn‚Äôt that so? Take my word for it, Montag, there‚Äôs nothing there. The books have nothing to say!\n\nDuring this scene and monologue ‚Äî only the captain is talking, Montag only reacts ‚Äî Captain Beatty expounds on different types of books and genres, dismissing each in turn. At the end, he finally reveals the reasons behind this society‚Äôs book-burning:\n\nWe‚Äôve all got to be alike. The only way to be happy is for everyone to be made equal. So, we must burn the books, Montag. All the books.\n\nThis scene reminded me of the forbidden magazines scene in The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale and the reasons the Commander gave for their totalitarian regime. The reasons in The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale were different, that they needed to ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù all the dirt and filth and sex from the world. The reasons expressed in Fahrenheit 451 come off as a search for a mythical, Utopian, and elusive ‚Äúpursuit of happiness.‚Äù A generic happiness, but happiness nonetheless.\n\nModern martyrs:\n\nThe captain‚Äôs assertion that ‚Äúthe books have nothing to say‚Äù is directly contradicted in the next scene, in which the older woman refuses to leave her books.\n\nFabian, another fireman, rushes in to say that the woman won‚Äôt leave. ‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt leave her books, she says.‚Äù\n\nWoman: I want to die as I‚Äôve lived.\n\nCaptain Beatty: Oh, you must have read that in there. I‚Äôm not going to ask you again. Are you going?\n\nWoman: These books were alive. They spoke to me.\n\nAnd so the older woman lights the match herself, to die as she lived, with her beloved books.\n\nTruffaut also lingers several minutes over the burning of the books, with several close-ups.\n\nIn the final act of the film, Montag and his firemen troop are called to his own house. He is forced to burn his own hidden collection of books.\n\nHe is chastised and criticized by his captain:\n\nWhat did Montag hope to get out of all this? Happiness? What a poor idiot you must have been.\n\nHis captain tries to grab the last book from Montag‚Äôs hand ‚Äî we find out later this is a collection of Edgar Allan Poe‚Äôs stories, Tales of Mystery and Imagination ‚Äî but Montag finally breaks, blasting Captain Beatty with the fire hose instead.\n\nNow compare this photo, of his captain lying facedown in the pile of books, ablaze, with the previous screenshot of the older woman, standing upright, proud and defiant. Both are martyrs of their own kind, but the woman chose to go up in flames.\n\nThe book people:\n\nMontag goes on the run then, hunted by the state, but he manages to escape to a hidden Utopia, deep in the forest, where others have escaped and banded together. These people are known as the ‚ÄúBook People,‚Äù as they have memorized a single work of literature and recite their tales for anyone who wishes to hear. The ‚Äúbook people‚Äù scenes were also filmed last.\n\nHere‚Äôs how the leader of the camp describes how they came together, the 50 or so at their station. But he mentions there are more of the books:\n\nIn abandoned railway yards, wandering the roads. Tramps outwardly, but, inwardly, libraries.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt planned. It just so happened that a man here and a man there loved some book. And rather than lose it, he learned it. And we came together. We‚Äôre a minority of undesirables crying out in the wilderness. But it won‚Äôt always be so. One day we shall be called on, one by one, to recite what we‚Äôve learned. And then books will be printed again. And when the next age of darkness comes, those who come after us will do again as we have done.\n\nAnd the book people also burn books themselves! But like the older woman in the house, they choose to do so, for their own specific reasons.\n\nYes, we burn the books. But we keep them up here [pointing to the brain] where nobody can find them.\n\nThe book people have literally ‚Äúbecome‚Äù their chosen book and even introduce themselves as such:\n\n‚ÄúAre you interested in Plato‚Äôs Republic?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell, I am Plato‚Äôs Republic. I‚Äôll recite myself for you whenever you like.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am The Prince by Machiavelli. As you see, you can‚Äôt judge a book by its cover.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat man over there hasn‚Äôt much longer to live.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs The Weir or Germiston by Robert Louis Stevenson. The boy is his nephew. He‚Äôs now reciting himself, so the boy can become the book.‚Äù\n\nThe film clip below is a combination of the final two scenes from the film.\n\nIn a special ‚Äúmaking of‚Äù featurette in the DVD‚Äôs special features, film historian and professor Annette Ensdorf gave her own interpretation of the film‚Äôs final scenes among the ‚Äúbook people,‚Äù stating that the people reciting their books at the end are just as self-absorbed as the narcissists we saw at the beginning of the film. Ensdorf sums up the finale and the ‚Äúbook people‚Äù as:\n\n‚Ä¶instruments of the text ‚Äî not really existing as a completely integrated social community but rather as individual icons.\n\nBut there‚Äôs the feeling of a certain muted triumph, namely that the book people will maintain a portion of civilization, that someday these books will still be alive, even if they are recounted rather than as written text.\n\nClassification and connections:\n\nAlthough the people literally become books in the end and could therefore be argued to be the only thing left resembling a librarian in a futuristic sense, I have to categorize this film in the Class V category, films with no identifiable librarians, although they might mention librarians or have scenes set in libraries. There are definitely library and censorship themes in the film, but no actual, identifiable librarians.\n\nThis contrasts with the ‚ÄúBooks‚Äù in another sci-fi classic, Soylent Green. In Soylent Green, ‚ÄúBooks‚Äù are former librarians and professors who become personal researchers in a dystopian future, a world in which books have ceased to be written and published. Books become rare commodities, precious treasures to be hoarded ‚Äî but not due to fear of burning. Rather, books ‚Äî and the people who take care of them, who then are referred to as ‚ÄúBooks‚Äù themselves ‚Äî are almost revered, and they have a unique power of their own.\n\nIn Soylent Green, the ‚ÄúBooks‚Äù guard the past, but there is little hope for the future.\n\nIn Fahrenheit 451, however, the ‚ÄúBook People‚Äù guard, or consume, the past because they are the only hope for the future.\n\nBooks in Fahrenheit 451:\n\nHere‚Äôs a list I compiled of all the books mentioned in the final scenes, in the order they are mentioned. The leader mentions there are around 50 or so around their camp, but says there are many others out there. A southern camp is also mentioned in the last scene.\n\nThese are some of the books we know that will live on:\n\nPlato‚Äôs Republic\n\nWuthering Heights by Emily Bronte\n\nThe Corsair by Byron\n\nAlice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll\n\nAlice Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll\n\nPilgrim‚Äôs Progress by John Bunyan\n\nWaiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett\n\nJean-Paul Sartre‚Äôs The Jewish Question\n\nThe Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury\n\nThe Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens\n\nDavid Copperfield by Charles Dickens\n\nThe Prince by Machiavelli\n\nJane Austen‚Äôs Pride and Prejudice, volumes one and two\n\nTales of Mystery and Imagination by Edgar Allan Poe\n\nThe Memoirs of Saint Simon\n\nThe Weir of Germiston by Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nBook-burning in Fahrenheit 451:\n\nOn the ‚Äúmaking of‚Äù feature on the DVD, producer Lewis M. Allen shared this tidbit about censorship he experienced during the making of the film:\n\nAn interesting thing about censorship is that when we were doing the book burning scene, the studio‚Ä¶ wanted to eliminate all books that were by living authors that were not in public domain, and the fact that they may be sued or whatever. And we just ignored that. We said, the hell with it, because I think everybody, anyone who was around who had a book being burned in there would be very much flattered by it. ‚Ä¶ So we ignored that and went right ahead.\n\nAllen also shared an amusing anecdote about how they compiled and played with all those books for the book-burning scenes:\n\nTo me, the most interesting part of the film‚Ä¶ was the burning of the books, which went went on and on. And we had those books in our offices, we had hundreds of books, from the beginning of the film. And he would play with them. We‚Äôd go round and pick ones out, play with them, and toss them, and put piles and so on. Every day this was done, as a kind of ritual, which was fun to do, ‚Äòcause we‚Äôd come up with strange books.\n\nHomme livre/libre:\n\nThe screenplay was originally written in French, as it was director Fran√ßois Truffaut‚Äôs vision, so there were several puns that got lost when translated into English.\n\nOne of the best puns focused on ‚Äúhomme livre‚Äù versus ‚Äúhomme libre.‚Äù\n\nThe original script had a moment between Clarisse and Montag, in which Clarisse explains about the ‚Äúhomme livre,‚Äù which translates to ‚Äúbook man.‚Äù But in French, ‚Äúhomme livre‚Äù sounds very close to ‚Äúhomme libre,‚Äù which translates to ‚Äúfree man.‚Äù\n\nAs producer Lewis M. Allen shared on the ‚Äúmaking of‚Äù DVD feature:\n\nThat was a nice pun, about the book people and the free people, livre and libre, which could not be translated.\n\nDefinitely an attempt to preserve the nature of the original pun in French, but it‚Äôs a pale ghost of the original.\n\nHomage to the written word\n\nThe ultimate message of Truffaut‚Äôs film version of Fahrenheit 451 gets discussed by several people in the DVD features.\n\nFrom film historian and critic Annette Ensdorf:\n\nWhat you‚Äôre going to get is Truffaut‚Äôs really passionate homage to literature, to the written word, to the notion of a text as a living, breathing entity and process that can still affect us.\n\nEnsdorf‚Äôs thoughts on the ultimate significance of the book people‚Äôs actions:\n\nYou learn it [the book] by heart, through the process of love. [‚Ä¶] Is there not freedom in the very choice of which book you want to be?\n\nFrom producer Lewis M. Allen, who praised Truffaut playing down several of the more overt sci-fi elements in the book, like the ‚Äúmechanical hound,‚Äù because:\n\nIt would be very distracting, in fact, from the simple story of the books, which was really what he was interested in most of all.\n\nFrom Steven C. smith, biographer of composer Bernard Hermann, who composed the music for the film and who was personal friends with the book‚Äôs author Ray Bradbury:\n\nThe act of reading becomes‚Ä¶ the most romantic thing in Fahrenheit 451.\n\nAnd in the music feature on the DVD, Ray Bradbury summed up the themes of the film‚Äôs musical score and its connection with the story itself:\n\nWhat we have is a romance with books.\n\nFinal words from the author himself:\n\nThe DVD that I checked out of this film also included in its special features an interview with Ray Bradbury, who talked about how he first wrote the book in a library basement and how the title came about.\n\nOn reflection in 2002 special feature on the DVD by Universal Studios, Bradbury remarked:\n\nI am a library person. I never made it through college you see. I‚Äôm self-educated in the library so anything that touches the library touches me.\n\nYou can also read a bit more background info and personal quotes from the author in my obituary post for Ray Bradbury, who passed away in 2012 at the age of 91. He was a lifelong and vocal supporter of libraries, and as he stated in 2009:\n\nLibraries raised me.\n\nHere‚Äôs to the ‚Äúbook people‚Äù around the world who stand up to censorship and advocate for reading, books, libraries, and librarians. ‚ô•\n\nHave you read the book and seen the film version of Fahrenheit 451?

The AFI, which will celebrate its 50th anniversary this September, is a nonprofit educational arts organization that ‚Äúprovides leadership in film and television and is dedicated to initiatives that engage the past, the present and the future of the moving image arts.‚Äù\n\nThis conversation with a fellow librarian movie buff gave me the idea of comparing the AFI Top 100 list with my own Master List of reel librarian films ‚Äî was there any overlap? Sometimes, an idea for a blog post is as simple as that. üòâ\n\nGood news, there ARE overlaps! I count 12 so far, but that comes with a caveat that I need to rewatch several of the films listed below to verify if there is actually a librarian (versus a library scene) in them or not.\n\nWithout further ado, below I‚Äôve detailed the overlaps between the AFI Top 100 list and my own Master List. (Also, please note that the numbers on the list below correspond to that film‚Äôs ranking on the AFI Top 100 list.)\n\n1. Citizen Kane (1941)\n\nCitizen Kane is classic saga about the rise and fall of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles). A reporter visits the Thatcher Memorial Library of Philadelphia to research Kane and runs into the steely, no-nonsense presence of the librarian.

The Graduate (1967)\n\nI need to rewatch this film! The first time (and only time, thus far) I have watched this film was right before I went away to college, so‚Ä¶ perhaps not the best timing or circumstances to watch and appreciate this movie! I do remember a major scene in the library, but I need to rewatch the film to see if there‚Äôs an actual librarian in the scene.\n\nHere‚Äôs an excerpt from the film‚Äôs summary on the AFI site:\n\nBenjamin Braddock, filled with doubts about his future, returns to his Los Angeles home after graduating from an Eastern college. His parents soon have a party so they can boast of their son‚Äôs academic achievements and his bright prospects in business. Mrs. Robinson, one of the guests, persuades Ben to drive her home and there tries to seduce him, but her overtures are interrupted by the sound of her husband‚Äôs car in the driveway. Blatant in her seductive maneuvers, she soon has the nervous and inexperienced Ben meeting her regularly at the Taft Hotel. As the summer passes, Benjamin becomes increasingly bored and listless; he frequently stays out overnight and returns home to loll around the pool.\n\n20. It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life (1946)\n\nIn It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life, George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) falls on hard times and is granted the wish to experience life as if he‚Äôd never been born.

Brian goes to the shabby boardinghouse run by Fraulein Schneider and there is greeted by Sally Bowles, an exuberant American singer. Sally, obsessed with becoming a movie star, is oblivious to the economic and political turmoil in Berlin, especially between the Nazis and Communists, and instead revels in the decadent atmosphere of alcohol, sex and excess.\n\n70.

The Shawshank Redemption (1994)\n\nIn The Shawshank Redemption, young banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife.

I haven‚Äôt done a ‚ÄúQuotable Librarian‚Äù post in quite awhile ‚Äî the last one was over two years ago, in February 2015! ‚Äî so I thought it high time for another post in the series.\n\nI thought about what kind of theme would be appropriate, and inspirational, this time around. And that‚Äôs when I came to seeking out inspirational quotes about libraries and librarians from real-life librarians themselves, including writers who were librarians.\n\nLet the inspiration commence!\n\nJorge Luis Borges (1899-1986):\n\n‚ÄúI have always imagined Paradise as a kind of library.‚Äù\n\n~ ‚ÄúPoem of the Gifts‚Äù [‚ÄúPoema de los Dones‚Äù], Dreamtigers, 1960\n\nThis is arguably the most famous of all library-related quotes, from the writer and librarian Jorge Luis Borges. He rose to be the Director of the National Library of Argentina in 1955, but was forced to resign (twice, in 1946 and in 1973) due to political clashes with Juan Per√≥n. But all the while, he was writing.\n\n‚ÄúI cannot think it unlikely that there is such a total book on some shelf in the universe. I pray to the unknown gods that some man ‚Äî even a single man, tens of centuries ago ‚Äî has perused and read this book. If the honor and wisdom and joy of such a reading are not to be my own, then let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my own place may be in hell. Let me be tortured and battered and annihilated, but let there be one instant, one creature, wherein thy enormous Library may find its justification.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDeutsches Requiem,‚Äù Emece edition, 1974\n\nCarla Hayden (1952- ):\n\n‚ÄúLibrarians were called during that time [during the Patriot Act] feisty fighters for freedom, and we were very proud of that label.‚Äù\n\n~ interview with Jeffrey Brown, PBS, 2016\n\nCarla Hayden is our current and 14th Librarian of Congress, becoming the first woman and the first African American to lead our national library. She received her master‚Äôs and doctorate degrees in Library Science from the University of Chicago Graduate Library School, and she worked as a children‚Äôs and public librarian.\n\nMadeleine L‚ÄôEngle (1918-2007):\n\n‚ÄúTo be a librarian, particularly a librarian for young adults, is to be a nourisher, to share stories, offer books full of new ideas. We live in a world which has changed radically in the last half century, and story helps us to understand and live creatively with change.‚Äù\n\n~ Acceptance Speech for the Margaret Edwards Award, 1998\n\nMadeleine L‚ÄôEngle was a longtime librarian and writer-in-residence at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. She won the Newbery Award in 1963 for the young adult classic novel, A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nBeverly Cleary:\n\n‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been very enthusiastic about the commercialization of children‚Äôs literature.
