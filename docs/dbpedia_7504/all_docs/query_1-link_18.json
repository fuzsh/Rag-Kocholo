        "text": "🚗💥 Behind the Scenes of Mad Max: Fury Road 🚗💥 Excitement is at its peak in Cannes with the screening of Mad Max: Furiosa! This new installment of the iconic saga follows in the footsteps of its predecessor by using the same storyboard process to guide the film's creation. 🎥 A Vision Through Storyboards Rather than following a traditional script, director George Miller relied solely on meticulously crafted storyboards to bring his post-apocalyptic vision to life. Mad Max: Fury Road was based on over 3500 detailed storyboards, guiding every aspect of the film's production. These storyboards allowed for the visualization of each scene, providing a visual coherence that left a lasting impression. 🌟 Create Your Own Visual Stories with Artale.io Now imagine if you could create your own visual stories with the same intensity and precision.

Where I agree. ‘Citizen Kane’ beaten by ‘How Green Was My Valley’ (1941) - Studios campaign for films to win. William Randolph Hearst campaigned for Kane to lose. ‘The Searchers’ beaten by ‘Around the World in 80 Days’ (1956) - John Wayne's best performance was in this film that explores prejudice at a time when those conversations were rare. ‘Vertigo’ beaten by ‘Gigi’ (1958) - Gigi is a movie about a creepy old man pursuing a teenager. ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ beaten by ‘Oliver!’ (1968) - Please sir, no more gruel. ‘The Truman Show’ beaten by ‘Shakespeare in Love’ (1998) - The Truman Show was a very inventive story. Shakespeare in Love, not so much. Where I disagree ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ beaten by ‘The Life of Emilie Zola’ (1937) - The fact that Disney transformed animation with his film, does not make it the best film. ‘The Exorcist’ beaten by ‘The Sting’ (1973) - The Sting is rewatchable. ‘Star Wars’ beaten by ‘Annie Hall’ (1977) - Star Wars is one of the most overrated movies. I prefer science fiction over science fantasy. The two other titles are ones where either choice is a good one.\n\nThere is a wonderful scene in one of my favorite films about artists. The film is called Rivers and Tides. The film’s focus is on the brilliant artist Andy Goldsworthy. The setting is the rural countryside of Ireland, where he lives with his wife and children. The film was made several years ago, so my guess is that his children are young adults now. Imagine you are in your kitchen having breakfast with your kids, and your spouse was getting the kids fed, and your significant other, a world-renowned artist, strolls through the kitchen at the time (this was Andy in the film). In the average family, the first thing in the morning, most people would connect briefly, and greet each other. Andy breezed through his kitchen and barely said a word to his family, all with a look on his face of “not now” I have something waiting. He was out to confront nature head on, and little was going to stand in his way. (Goldsworthy- creative, sculptor using the earth and its natural materials…. knowing that “the weather will ultimately destroy the art he’s making). He starts with known materials, then moves toward a known assemblage, in his mind’s eye, which will then disappear, sometimes within hours or even minutes. Andy is saying to us I’m living and creating in the moment, knowing that the beauty I make will “wash away.” There’s so much, all artists can be reminded of when watching this film. The film indeed altered my life, reminding me that it’s the art-making journey that must be honored, wherever one’s studio is and by submersing oneself in “the play” of the moment…………. That’s me from the unknown to the known. #IvanBarnett, #IvanBarnettStudio, #SantaFe, #SantaFeArt, #SantaFeArtist, #studio, #studioart, #salon, #homestudio, #collaboration, #ArtCollaboration, #NewMexico, #Art, #SeriousPlay, #collaboration, #IvanBarnettconsulting, #SeriousPlayConsulting, #consulting, #artconsulting, #business, #marketing, #motivation, #branding, #coaching, #consultingagency, #consultingservices, #brandconsulting, #marketingconsulting, #creativeconsulting,\n\nSecond thing I will share from \"Historien om Sverige\" is the importance of educating your users. If you just 3d-scan something and give your client a file, there is a big risk it will never actually get used. There are a ton of ways you can use a scan, but it will only get done if everyone involved knows it is possible. In episode 1 there is a short clip of a stone axe rotating on a turntable. The crew has to go to the museum. Members of staff has to get the item. Light and camera has to be rigged. Then you can shoot it. This exact axe was scanned by me for the museum a year ago. It took me 30 minutes to find the file, import it in #Blender, find the camera angle, animate it and match the lights. Then it rendered in 40 minutes while I sat on the sofa. And no one had to handle the original artifact. PS. They probably filmed a lot of other stuff, that isn't scanned, that same day to save some time.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dK_T_rU9 ---‐---------------------------- In the \"Papyrus\" sketch from Saturday Night Live (SNL), Ryan Gosling portrays a character who is deeply bothered by the everywhere use of the Papyrus font for the movie \"Avatar.\" He can not belive that such a blockbuster film would use a font that he perceives as overused and unoriginal. This character represents someone who is perhaps overly focused on minor details and aesthetics, to the point of being overly critical or obsessive. On the other hand, the character played by Beck Bennett, who created the font, represents someone who is proud of his work and doesn't understand why it's being ridiculed. This character embodies the creative process and the pride that comes with creating something, even if it's not always appreciated by everyone. Both characters offer insights into different aspects of creativity and criticism. The sketch humorously highlights the sometimes absurd debates that can arise over seemingly unimportant matters in the creative world. ------------------- What are your views? 🌱Repost if you find this thoughtful and relatable and do share what you feel 😀 #thoughtoftheday #creativedigitalmarketing #logo #logofonts #creation #digitalmarketcreators\n\nThe Role of Film in Society \"There is an old movie-saying, which the distribution and marketing people love… During a recession, business gets better! It doesn’t slump! If you look at the numbers of the movie business you will wonder why that happens. It’s because people want to go and get away, and they want to be able to feel different. In this sense, it doesn’t matter whether you agree or disagree with the movie content.\" The arts are not just one, they are all connected- and movies have become a huge part of the arts. Movies inspire, they have a way of setting tones. All elements of art are interconnected, they are very similar. It used to be that you go to a museum and you see an art exhibit and it was someone who was well known- you had lines to see the exhibit. If someone wasn’t well known, it would start small and grow. Movies are like that- but the difference is that movies can both take the lead in creating other arts, and following arts (by which I mean they are able to take a piece of art, and tell the story behind it). When you paint a picture, you just paint that picture! A movie can take that picture to a whole other place… with a story. I think that capability is what separates film, to a degree- from the other arts. https://lnkd.in/gjXg57rG.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gFYbUwqs Some of our favourite NAB Show 2024 presentations weren't about the latest tech, but about using established media and great artistic ideas to tell a story. Yesterday at NAB, Eastman Kodak Company went behind the scenes of Oscar winning-pictures to reveal the secrets of shooting on film. Killers of the Flower Moon DP Rodrigo Prieto used KODAK 35mm color and B&W filmstocks to create looks that honored the heritage of the Osage people for Martin Scorsese's lauded period-thriller. \"I knew Marty wanted to tell a strong, powerful story in a visually realistic way that honored the Osage,\" said Prieto. \"So, I went back to my idea from The Irishman... evoking the memory of a certain era through stills photography of the time. I prefer to take my visual inspirations from real stills and to observe where the camera is in relation to the light.\" Prieto's words and work were inspirational because they resonate with our approach - but also remind us that ideas and clarity of thought are the real keys to successful art and design. If you have a strong vision, respect your subject and understand your audience, you'll be able to generate strong, clear ideas that resonate. The same applies to designing exhibitions and bringing brands in to focus. #nabshow #kodak #killersoftheflowermoon #film #design #vision\n\nDay 69: Today we wrap up the D.C series. It was amazing spending a week in the DMV area filming. With today’s film, we decided to explore the versatility in Architecture filmmaking by employing a retro/soul music style. I was thinking yesterday that it is possible to use any musical style to create a great architectural film. Depending on the context of film, one musical style may be more favorable for a film over another. I think before the challenge is over we would experiment using Afrobeat musical style to create an architectural film 😁. For now, enjoy this film of the Arena Stage at the Mead Center for American Theater ’s cantilevered roof in D.C by Bing Thom Architects 🎥. - “The 180” is a series of 10-15 Seconds short, personal, and primarily architectural film projects spanning a total of 180 days. This endeavor serves as an opportunity for us to explore and expand our creative boundaries. While the majority of the films focus on architecture, there may also be creative film concepts incorporated into “The 180.” Follow along with the hashtag #the180shortfilm on Instagram, LinkedIn, and TikTok to engage with daily posts. Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in licensing any of the films from “The 180” projects or if you’re seeking consultation for your firms film project. 🎥 #Architecture #ArchitecturalDesign #BuildingDesign #ArchitecturalInspiration #uniquearchitecture #monument #washingtonmonument #arenastage #cantilever #cantilevered #cantileveredroof #thewharfdc #theatre #theatrearchitecture #ArchitecturalPhotography #ArchitectureDocumentary #architecturevideo #architecturefilm #architecturefilmmaking #architecturalfilm #shortfilms #dmvarchitecture #dcarchitecture #washingtondc #dcmoments #dmv #tobiabawonse #tobiabawonsephotography #the180shortfilm"
