        "text": "Posters are one of the oldest, most tried-and-true types of marketing collateral. Posters are an effective way to draw attention to your sales, events, fundraisers and more.\n\nWhile there is no one right way to make a poster, there are still poster design best practices that you should follow.\n\nSo we decided to take it upon ourselves to write the ultimate, most in-depth poster design guide out there. If you want to learn how to design a poster from scratch (or with our professionally designed poster templates), you’re in the right place.\n\nThese poster design tips can be applied to virtually any poster you design. So let’s get into it!\n\nHow to design a poster from scratch\n\nCreating a poster from scratch can be a fun and enriching experience. Whether you’re crafting a school project to impress your teacher, using one to promote an event or simply presenting information in an engaging way, posters offer a unique opportunity to express yourself visually and share your message effectively.\n\nThis step-by-step guide will equip you with the tools and techniques to make your own compelling poster:\n\nIdentify the goal of your poster\n\nConsider your target audience\n\nDecide where to share your poster\n\nSelect a professional poster template\n\nPick a relevant or branded color scheme\n\nInclude a clear call to action\n\nUse fonts to create a hierarchy of information\n\nUse icons to visualize concepts and grab attention\n\nAdd high-quality images & stock photos\n\nDownload & export in the right format\n\nHow to design posters for different occasions\n\n1. Identify the goal of your poster\n\nThe most important step in the poster creation process is to understand why you are creating this type of promotional material in the first place.\n\nIs it because of advertising purposes for a new product? To grab the audience’s attention about a concert in the area? To highlight important details about a campaign? Or even just because there’s a sale coming up? All of these are goals that some engaging poster templates can help you achieve.\n\nIf you think about your main goals from the beginning, you can use those goals to guide your choices like a professional designer would.\n\nFor example, if the goal of your poster is to invite your community to a fundraising event, then your poster should be designed strategically to help you achieve this goal. A common rule for written communication is that simplicity wins.\n\nTake a look at another fundraising event poster:\n\nJust so you know, some of our poster templates are free to use and some require a small monthly fee. Sign-up is always free, as is access to Venngage’s online drag-and-drop editor.\n\nNow, if you’re looking for information posters for your fundraising event, here’s another example you can keep in mind:\n\nStart with a goal and plan your custom poster around it.\n\n2. Consider your target audience\n\nNext, you should consider who you are trying to reach with your poster. Answering this question will probably remind you of all the important details you should highlight while you make your poster.\n\nFor example, say you’re advertising an event for women’s rights like below:\n\nNow compare it to this other design below:\n\nThe goal and audience on each of these templates are different and both designs will appeal to distinct groups of people. Make sure you have decided exactly who you want to appeal to, before jumping into your online poster creator tool and starting your creation process.\n\nA perk of these eye-catching posters is that we can see inclusive visuals, maximalist elements and bold shapes — which happen to be some of this year’s biggest graphic design trends.\n\nAlso, remember that you can make multiple posters that cater to different customer personas. You don’t have to use one for every type of customer!\n\n3. Decide where you want to share your poster\n\nThe final thing you should determine to save time — before designing your poster — is where it will be shared.\n\nWould you like to hang it up on a wall? Or just share it with your followers on social media so they can leave comments and send it to other friends?\n\nIt’s important to decide where you want your poster to be seen before you start working on your online poster maker. This is because, as you will see below, optimizing a poster properly for print is slightly different than for Twitter or Facebook.\n\nOptimize your poster for print\n\nYou probably have an idea of where you’re going to share your poster. Where you decide to pin it up can help you make a few design decisions.\n\nIf you’re planning on printing out your poster, there are some basic guidelines you should keep in mind.\n\nVisualize where you will pin up your poster\n\nIf it’s going on a wall with a bunch of other movie posters though, print your poster in a larger size so it will stand out:\n\nBut if it’s going on a relatively bare wall, print it in a smaller size and pin up a bunch of them to then create posters with a larger footprint like the minimalist poster templates below:\n\nIf you’re looking for more ideas to present your findings effectively, search through our selection of scientific poster templates.\n\nSelect a standard paper size\n\nUnless you want to create a big poster background, you probably don’t want to spend money on getting it printed. You can print it yourself by simply designing your custom poster to fit the standard ISO A1-A5 printer paper.\n\nWith Venngage you can magically resize any of our poster templates into Letter, A3, A4, A5 and any custom dimensions with a few clicks. First, click on the page size tab on the top left and then select what size you would like:\n\nThe page resize option will also reformat your poster content to fit the new size you select — if you want it to. This simple feature will save you a TON of time in the long run, so be sure to try it out.\n\nYou’re more than welcome to manually resize your poster the old-fashioned way, by updating the page size:\n\nYou can also set the size of your poster background in Pixels, Inches, or Centimeters as well.\n\nThat said, for most of the posters that you’re going to print out, it’s best to use the preset sizes. This will ensure that your printer can actually print out a beautiful poster.\n\nabove, there’s now a white border added to your design. This is — you guessed it — the bleed marks!\n\nOptimize your poster for social media\n\nThere are fewer restraints when designing a poster for web than for print. This is a great opportunity to do something really fun with your design. Still, there are some guidelines you should follow.\n\nIf you want your poster to look really good on social media, size it for the specific platform you’re promoting it on. You may want to make a couple of different versions of your poster for different platforms.\n\nRemember, a square or portrait orientation looks best for mobile viewing. People are used to scrolling up and down on mobile, rather than side to side.\n\nThese are the ideal dimensions for each of the big social media platforms:\n\nFacebook: 1200 x 630 pixels\n\nX (Twitter): 1200 x 675 pixels for landscape images, 900 x 900 pixels for square images and 506 x 253 pixels for 2:1 aspect ratio images.\n\nInstagram: 1080px by 1080px at a 1:1 aspect ratio. For landscape posts, use an image that is 1080px by 566px, with an aspect ratio of 1.91:1.\n\nPinterest: You have more wiggle room here for length, but try to use a ratio of 2:3 to 1:3.5.\n\nIf you’re creating an advertisement poster for Twitter or Facebook, banners generally fit better on their newsfeeds. In that case, landscape orientation is fine.\n\nOr if you’re looking for awareness campaign poster ideas to share on a Pinterest board:\n\n4. Start with a professional poster template\n\nYou don’t need to hire professional designers to create powerful poster backgrounds. Designing your own poster might sound intimidating but with Venngage’s free poster maker, you can make an engaging poster online — for business, virtual events, scientific facts, and much more.\n\nA poster template will give you a foundation to create your own poster stand, your own design.\n\nStart by picking a template that will help communicate the goal of your poster. Look for templates that reflect your poster’s theme or have the right layout you’re looking for.\n\nHere are some things to keep in mind when picking a poster template:\n\nLook for a poster template with a layout that fits your vision and goals (ex. header placement, image placeholders, icons and more).\n\nPick a poster sample with the right dimensions for where you will be sharing your poster (ex. on a wall, on Facebook, in an email marketing campaign, etc).\n\nRemember that you can always customize your templates if there are aspects of the design that you don’t like.\n\nFor example, if you want to create a poster for your job fair, you would want to focus on the location, date, and jobs available:\n\nHowever, if you’re creating information posters to raise knowledge and awareness about an important holiday or event:\n\nIf you’re creating an advertisement poster to promote a sale, the discount and date are probably should be the most eye-catching parts of your poster:\n\nAs you can see, these are all great poster templates, but each example is designed to help you achieve a unique goal. So just make sure you are picking a template that fits your goal and you will save a ton of time.\n\nNow if you want to learn how to create an event poster, business poster, sales poster and more, jump to the last section. There you will find a more in-depth guide on creating a killer poster.\n\n5. Pick a relevant or branded color scheme\n\nOne of the first things that someone will probably notice about your poster is the color scheme.\n\nIn most cases, the appropriate color scheme will be obvious. So try not to overthink it!\n\nFor example, if you’re creating a poster for a winter event, then a color scheme of warm green, red, and white will evoke the feeling of the holidays.\n\nIf your company has strict brand guidelines you need to follow, then you can incorporate your brand colors into your custom posters.\n\nNow if you want to use your brand colors on any of our poster templates, just click the My Brand Kit tab on the left side of the screen:\n\nThen click one of your branded colors to add them to any poster template:\n\nClick the palette again to change where the branded colors are used:\n\nWith a few clicks, you can create a ton of variations of your poster, like so:\n\nHowever, if you’re still struggling to come up with a relevant color scheme, take a look at the meanings and emotions of each color.\n\nThe color blue is usually associated with wisdom, trust, and loyalty. Use this color palette on a business, event, or marketing poster to make it feel very professional:\n\nGreen is associated with energy, the environment, and tranquility. It would make sense to use a green color combination on a nonprofit or fundraising poster, like below:\n\nRed is associated with strength, courage, and joy. It also is super eye-catching, which you can see in the minimalist but stunning poster below:\n\nAs you can see, color theory should help you pick the right color palette in no time. Now if you’re not sure where to start when it comes to pairing colors, a color scheme generator tool like Coolors can be helpful.\n\n6. Include a clear call-to-action\n\nOnce you have someone’s attention, you need to make it very clear what their next steps are to help. This is commonly known as a Call-To-Action (CTA).\n\nEvery poster, no matter the topic or type, should have a CTA. Otherwise, what is the point of creating a poster in the first place?\n\nIn this marketing poster template, the CTA is the “Register Online” at the bottom:\n\nThe designer made sure this CTA would stand out from the rest of the poster by highlighting it in blue and using a unique font.\n\nAdditionally, they made the CTA very simple to follow. You don’t want to make your CTA a chore, especially if your poster wants them to visit a website.\n\nThe same can be said about this fitness poster template:\n\nBut in this example, the creator of this poster made the CTA stand out even more!\n\nAs you can see these CTAs are both near the bottom of the poster. This is on purpose and allows the reader to get more information before taking action:\n\nCan you imagine if the first thing you read on a poster was CTA? It would be very confusing and probably make you ignore the rest of the poster.\n\nNot all CTAs require the reader to visit a website, call a business or make a purchase immediately.\n\nThat action may be as simple as telling their friends about what they learned on the poster. Or about when a garage sale happens to be:\n\nThe call to action on this poster is actually the entire black section of the poster. The top section informs the reader and the bottom helps them take an action.\n\nIn this case, the action is visiting the garage sale, but it still is a CTA. Without it, no one would know what this poster was trying to get them to do.\n\n7. Use fonts to create a hierarchy of information\n\nWhat information you choose to include on your poster will depend on the goal of your poster.\n\nBut if you’re creating a fairly standard poster, it’s best practice to follow a hierarchy of information.\n\nFor example, if you are creating an event poster the information on your eye-catching posters should be read in this order:\n\nThe name of your event.\n\nThe date and time of your event.\n\nA short description of the event or a catchy tagline.\n\nThe location of your event (if you choose to include it).\n\nA simple call to action like a website, social media page or contact number.\n\nThe name of your company, department, organization, etc.\n\nAs you can see in this event poster design, the designer used a handful of different fonts to organize the information:\n\nThe title of the event obviously uses the largest font, because it will hopefully catch someone’s attention. It also will give the reader context for the other information on the poster.\n\nBut if they aren’t interested in learning more, they can quickly move on with their day after reading the title.\n\nIf they are interested in the event, they can move on to the next piece of information, the date.\n\nThe designer used a bright yellow to catch your eye directly after reading the title of the event. If they would have used a simple white, the information would have been easily overlooked.\n\nThe tagline of the event is italicized below the title, giving the reader a little more context about the event. Again, if this sounds interesting to the reader, they can move on to the next piece of information, and so on.\n\nThis process will help eliminate people who don’t really need to see the CTA at the end of your poster.\n\nAnd finally, after moving through all the information, the CTA at the bottom uses another bold font and color so that people will not miss it.\n\nCan you imagine how hard it would be to navigate this poster if they would have used the same font throughout? It would look like a term paper that no one wants to read.\n\nNow if you’re struggling to decide what the hierarchy of your poster should look like, think about the most important info you want the reader to walk away with.\n\nIn this example, the title of the event, the location and the CTA seem to be the most important.\n\nAdditionally, the font color used in this design contrasts exceptionally well with the poster background color. If you choose a font that doesn’t contrast, it will be very difficult to read your poster.\n\nAs you can see below, a good rule of thumb is to use a light font color on a dark background:\n\nOr a dark font on a light background:\n\nEven if you use a single font on your poster, you can quickly create a hierarchy of information just by changing the font’s color, size or weight. So again, don’t overthink it!\n\n8. Use icons to visualize concepts and grab attention\n\nIcons are symbols used in design to represent concepts. Icons are the perfect way to enhance your custom posters. You can use icons to embellish points and, in certain cases, replace text.\n\nThey’re also great for illustrating ideas quickly. Or you could make icons the main focal point of your design, like the template below:\n\nKeep these best practices in mind when using icons in your poster design:\n\nPick icons with a consistent style (line thickness, flat or illustrated, line art or filled).\n\nUse icons sparingly and allow for plenty of whitespaces to let your design breathe.\n\nAdd a simple border or background shape to your icons.\n\nIf you do replace the text with icons, make sure that the meaning is very obvious.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of those best practices in action, starting with keeping your icons consistent.\n\nAs you probably know, there are a few different kinds of icons that you can use. Some are flat, and can be changed to match the color of your poster very easily:\n\nWhile others are illustrated, and the colors can’t be changed:\n\nWhatever icons you choose to use while designing a poster, just make sure the styles are consistent, like in the examples above.\n\nSo if you use a flat icon in one section, use flat icons throughout your poster and vice versa.\n\nNext, let’s talk about using whitespace correctly when it comes to icons. If you’re not aware, whitespace is the open space around a design element like a block of text, a title or an icon:\n\nWithout it, your poster design will feel exactly cramped and unprofessional. It will also make your poster very hard to read or navigate. Check out how odd the poster below looks without adequate whitespace:\n\nIt looks like a mess, so be sure to take the time to use whitespace throughout your poster!\n\nOne very easy way that you can create this whitespace around your icons is by using a background or border shape. Each icon in the template below uses a background shape:\n\nUsing background shapes in this way will not only give your icons some room to breathe, but it will also make them a lot more eye-catching. Without the border shapes in the example above, the icons would have just faded into the background.\n\nPlus, if you’re using illustrated icons it will make the design feel much more consistent across the poster:\n\nAnd the finally best practice, be sure that if you replace text with an icon, the reader will actually understand it. The poster example below illustrates this tactic well in the contact section:\n\nReaders are going to be able to decipher those icons because they are used a lot in the real world already. Others might not be so easy to understand, so you might have to add a label or title to them. Like below:\n\nWith Venngage, you can quickly swap any icon on your poster or one of our customizable poster templates, with just a few clicks as well. First, select on any icon on your poster and then click the Replace button:\n\nThen just search for the icon that you want, and click on it to replace:\n\nIt’s really that simple and can help you turn any template into your own unique graphic in no time.\n\n9. Use high-quality images & stock photos\n\nIf you have been paying attention to the templates and examples in this article you may have noticed that they use a lot of premium images.\n\nVenngage’s free poster maker tool offers free and premium images, icons and graphs to help you edit poster designs with ease — no prior design skills needed. Here are some examples of stock images in the background:\n\nWhile others make it one of the main focal points of the poster:\n\nBut all of them use very high-quality images, no matter the type of poster.\n\nIf you plan to print out the poster or enlarge it, using high-quality photos is important. The slight blurriness or pixelation will quickly become a nightmare.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you are using a stock photo or one that you took, all of them should be very crisp and clear.
