        "text": "Posters are widely used in the academic community, and most conferences include poster presentations in their program. Research posters summarize information or research concisely and attractively to help publicize it and generate discussion.\n\nThe poster is usually a mixture of a brief text mixed with tables, graphs, pictures, and other presentation formats. At a conference, the researcher stands by the poster display while other participants can come and view the presentation and interact with the author.\n\nPowerPoint\n\nA popular, easy-to-use option. It is part of Microsoft Office package and is available on the library computers in rooms LC337 and LC336. (Advice for creating a poster with PowerPoint).\n\nAdobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign\n\nFeature-rich professional software that is good for posters including lots of high-resolution images, but they are more complex and expensive. NYU Faculty, Staff, and Students can access and download the Adobe Creative Suite.\n\nOpen Source Alternatives\n\nOpenOffice is the free alternative to MS Office (Impress is its PowerPoint alternative).\n\nInkscape and Gimp are alternatives to Adobe products.\n\nFor charts and diagrams try Gliffy or Lovely Charts.\n\nA complete list of free graphics software."
