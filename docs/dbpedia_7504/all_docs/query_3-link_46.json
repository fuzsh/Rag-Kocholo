        "text": "By Vanessa Zimmer\n\nWhere do you start to tell the story of 40 years of poster art at the Sundance Film Festival? At the beginning, some would say. No, I would reply, you start with the people.\n\nMaybe you’d start with Chelsea Christensen, because, if you’re looking for a cheerleader for the independent film festival (and its parent Sundance Institute), she’s the one. You’ll likely find her in an unassuming warehouse in Park City, Utah, that houses the official merchandise for the Festival.\n\nAt the height of the Festival season, Christensen will be cheerfully packaging and sending out orders for coffee cups, hoodies, T-shirts, water bottles, beanies, puffer jackets, socks, everything — including posters.\n\nEach year, the poster becomes a symbol of the January Festival. “Some people buy it for the year, as a souvenir, and some people buy it as a beautiful piece of art,” Christensen says in a Zoom interview. “And if we can combine the two together, where people love it as a souvenir and as a piece of art, I think that makes a perfect poster.”\n\nNow a veteran of her “26th Festival” — funny thing, Sundance Institute staff tend to measure their employment by the number of Festivals rather than years — Christensen identifies some favorite designs over the years.\n\nProbably third on Christensen’s list of favorites are the regular and Limited Edition 2007 posters — “the year of the fire.” Not as in a destructive fire, but a flame that symbolizes the spark of creativity.\n\nChristensen was running the Festival Headquarters that year in a Park City hotel. Inspired by the posters, she asked hotel maintenance to help her change out the light bulbs in the ballrooms and replace them with the bulbs that resembled flickering flames. “I was just so into the theme of sparking the flames.”\n\nPerhaps like-minded on the minimalist scale is longtime Sundance Institute archivist Tanya De Angelis (“2005 was my first Festival”).\n\nConsider the 2017 poster, which involved the Institute content team accompanying photographer Jonathan Hickerson to the Sundance Resort, where they proceeded to play with flashlights and the camera shutter.\n\n“I think I enjoy that one a lot because it’s one of the only ones in the last 10–15 years that was actually a photograph and people were technically in the photo, you can’t see them, but it’s something that was created in real time.” An extra boost is the mountain skyline in the background.\n\nThe steampunk clock of the 2009 poster also appeals to De Angelis, in part because she remembers the clock was re-created in three-dimensional form for the awards statuettes passed out that year.\n\nTwo other De Angelis selections also use human figures: 1) the 1995 poster of a person lying stomach-down, pointing what appears to be an 8mm movie camera at the camera that actually recorded the shot, and 2) the 1987 poster of a man “who looks a little like David Lynch… and there’s a film reel kind of circling around his head.”\n\n“It’s very like: This is a film festival. But also just kind of fun and very, very ’80s-feeling,” De Angelis says of the latter. That’s fitting, because back then the Sundance Institute was just getting its start.\n\nRedford established the Institute in 1981 with the intention of nurturing emerging storytellers with new and distinctive voices, apart from the rigid Hollywood studio system. Redford and the Institute assumed control of the Park City-headquartered U.S. Film Festival in 1985, and by 1991, it was called the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nGilberto Schaefer was a new Salt Lake City businessman back then, not too long after arriving from his native Switzerland. He and a partner were trying to get their graphic design business off the ground, and some branding work they did for the Deer Valley ski resort apparently caught the eye of Redford’s group.\n\nAs a result, Schaefer’s company, Innovation, designed the 1985 and 1986 posters, under the U.S. Film Festival moniker.\n\nSchaefer recalls how he and his wife wrapped up a borrowed movie camera in their kitchen, much like the artist Christo did with his art, for part of the 1985 image. Schaefer and his partner then came up with the blue/lavender mountain for the background. The concept was to convey the idea: Something is coming.\n\nRedford was looking for something more abstract after that, and Schaefer’s vision of hiding a movie camera in each year’s poster didn’t fit the bill. Schaefer was disappointed, but he maintains a heart full of respect for Redford and his mission for independent film."
