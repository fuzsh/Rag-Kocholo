        "text": "Inspired by an original ATS recruitment poster and uses an IWM archive image of women pilots gazing as if they are looking to the future.\n\nDuring the Second World War male dominated industries found their workforces depleted, and by the end of 1941, Britain began conscripting women. They found themselves developing skills and earning their own wages, giving them a newfound independence.\n\nGender inequality was still prevalent, women were not allowed to fight on the front line in Britain and still had to support the household duties whilst in work, but it was evident that this was the start of something more for women and their important position in society.\n\nThe future is female poster dimensions:\n\n50cm x 70cm"
