        "text": "We've closed the NHSC Loan Repayment Program application cycle.\n\nLicensed primary care clinicians can receive loan repayment assistance through the NHSC Loan Repayment Program. Providers must be in an eligible discipline.\n\nIn exchange for loan repayment, you must serve at least two years at an NHSC-approved site in a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA).\n\nMaternity Care Target Areas\n\nIn addition to HPSAs, we also will use designated Maternity Care Target Area (MCTA) scoring to distribute maternity care health professionals. MCTAs are within primary care HPSAs. MCTAs are within primary care HPSAs. We award maternity care health providers using either the primary care HPSA or the MCTA score of their site, whichever is higher.\n\nService\n\nYou have an opportunity to increase access to primary care services to communities in need.\n\nFlexible Service Options\n\nYou have a choice of service options:\n\nTwo-year full-time clinical practice at an NHSC-approved site.\n\nTwo-year half-time clinical practice at an NHSC-approved site.\n\nLoan Repayment\n\nYou will receive funds to repay your outstanding, qualifying, school loans.\n\nNHSC loan repayment funds are exempt from federal income and employment taxes.\n\nFull-time service: Up to $75,000 (primary care providers) or $50,000 (for all providers) for a two-year initial term.\n\nHalf-time service: Up to $37,500 (primary care providers) or $25,000 (for all providers) for a two-year initial term.\n\nNote: If you serve in a private practice, you aren't eligible to practice half-time.\n\nComplete Repayment of Qualifying Loans\n\nAfter you complete the initial two-year service contract, you may be eligible to apply for additional loan repayment funds to pay any remaining school loans through one-year continuation service contracts.\n\nThere is no guarantee that you will receive a continuation contract.\n\nNew award enhancement for Spanish-language proficiency\n\nFor the 2024 NHSC loan repayment programs, we aim to address language access barriers to health care. To support this effort, we will provide a one-time enhancement award of $5,000 for a total loan repayment award of:\n\nPrimary care participants (physicians, nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants serving in a primary care HPSA):\n\nUp to $80,000 for full-time participants.\n\nUp to $42,500 for half-time participants.\n\nNon-primary care participants (physicians, nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives and physician assistants specializing in behavioral health serving in a mental HPSA, as well as dentists, dental hygienists, and behavioral health providers):\n\nUp to $55,000 for full-time participants.\n\nUp to $30,000 for half-time participants.\n\nAward amounts are based on the outstanding balance of an applicant’s qualifying educational loans. Participants must complete the two-year service obligation regardless of the amount of their award.\n\nWho is eligible for the enhancement?\n\nIf you indicated that you have proficiency in Spanish when the application closes, you will receive an email containing a link to a Spanish-language competency assessment. This assessment will be conducted by a vendor approved by the General Services Administration. To be eligible for the award enhancement, your score on the assessment must be three or higher.\n\nNote: If your loans are less than the maximum $75,000 (full-time) or $37,500 (half-time) increased award amounts or the $50,000 (full-time) or $25,000 (half-time) traditional two-year award amount, you will not receive the award enhancement even if you are eligible under the other criteria.\n\nAward increase for primary care providers\n\nWe have increased the award amount for physicians, nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and physician assistants who provide primary care services in high-need communities (located in a primary care HPSA) to address the critical shortages of these providers.\n\nThe increased award amounts are:\n\nUp to $75,000 for a full-time, two-year service commitment\n\nUp to $37,500 for a half-time, two-year service commitment\n\nIf you are in an eligible discipline but you provide mental or behavioral health care services, you will not be eligible for the increased award amount. Instead, all other providers eligible for an NHSC award will receive up to $50,000 of support for a full-time, two-year service commitment.\n\nRemember, all two-year loan repayment program participants can apply for an NHSC Loan Repayment Program Continuation Contract. This option may allow you to pay off most or all of your health professional education debt.\n\nPrimary Care Disciplines Specialties\n\nPhysicians\n\nAllopathic (MD)\n\nOsteopathic (DO)\n\nFamily Medicine\n\nGeneral Internal Medicine\n\nGeneral Pediatrics\n\nGeriatrics\n\nPhysician Assistants (PA)\n\nNurse Practitioners (NP)\n\nAdult\n\nFamily\n\nPediatric\n\nWomen's Health\n\nGeriatrics\n\nMaternal Care Disciplines Specialties\n\nPhysicians\n\nAllopathic (MD)\n\nOsteopathic (DO)\n\nFamily Medicine Physicians who practice obstetrics on a regular basis\n\nObstetrics/Gynecology\n\nCertified Nurse Midwives (CNM) N/A\n\nApplication information\n\nDetermine if you're eligible\n\nEligible disciplines\n\nNHSC-approved sites\n\nHow to apply\n\nReview the application sections\n\nAfter you apply\n\nWhen we notify you\n\nUnderstand your contract and service obligation\n\nDetermine if you're eligible\n\nDo I qualify for the NHSC Loan Repayment Program?\n\nYou qualify if you meet these requirements:\n\nA United States citizen (U.S. born or naturalized) or a United States national\n\nA provider (or eligible to participate as a provider) in the Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as appropriate\n\nFully trained and licensed to practice in the NHSC-eligible discipline and state in which you are applying to serve.
