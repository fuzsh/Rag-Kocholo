        "text": "Moulin Rouge\n\nThe poster as we know it was born in 19th century France, where a new style of advertisement for products, exhibitions and events developed.\n\nOften called the father of the poster, Jules Chéret was one of the first masters of the new four-colour lithographic print process. This is his 1890 poster for the Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris.\n\nAbsinthe Robette\n\nThrough the late 19th century and into the 20th, new posters advertising luxury goods were commissioned from influential Art Nouveau artists.\n\nThis Henri Privat-Livemont’s poster is typical of the style, with a Pre-Raphelite inspired figure enjoying the goods – in this case, Absinthe Robette.\n\nLe Chat Noir\n\nLe Chat Noir was said to be the first modern cabaret, opening its doors in Paris in 1881.\n\nThis poster was created by Art Nouveau printmaker Théophile Steinlen in 1896 to promote an upcoming tour of the cabaret’s performers.\n\nThe club closed in 1897 after the death of its owner, Rodolphe Salis.\n\nPriester\n\nSoon the complexity of Art Nouveau poster design gave way to the simplicity of Sachplakat, or the ‘object poster’.\n\nThe originator of this stark style was an 18-year-old German cartoonist who designed under the name Lucian Bernhard. In 1906 he entered a poster competition with a design for Priester matches. His first draft is said to have featured a tabletop, ashtray, cigar and nymphs emerging from the tobacco smoke. Bernhard simplified until all that was left were two match sticks and the brand name.\n\nPates Baroni\n\nLeonetto Cappiello progressed this new fashion for posters with just a few strong elements. He turned the earlier style of artists like Jules Chéret into a bolder ad form with figures set against simple backgrounds.\n\nWhile Chéret was called the father of the modern poster, Cappiello is often called the father of modern advertising. This 1921 pasta poster is one of his best known.\n\nKeep Calm and Carry On\n\nThis poster was originally designed by the British Ministry of Information in 1939 to keep public morale up during World War II.\n\nIt was hardly used at the time, but 60 years later the print was rediscovered and its very British slogan (and countless variations) can be seen printed on tea towels, mugs and T-shirts today.\n\nWe Can Do It!\n\n‘We Can Do It!’ started life as an American wartime propaganda poster in 1943, designed to boost workers’ morale.\n\nIn the 1980s it was rediscovered and its hero, who came to be known as ‘Rosie the Riveter’, found fame again as a symbol of feminism and political empowerment.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Santa Claus\n\nContrary to popular belief, Coca-Cola wasn’t the first to dress Santa in red – though the fact that the outfit was on-brand didn’t hurt.\n\nThe drinks company did however popularise the image of a cheerful, plump, white-bearded Santa that persists today.\n\nThis 1931 ad was illustrated by Haddon Sundblom.\n\nSee America\n\nIn the Great Depression of the 1930s, U.S.President Franklin D. Roosevelt set up the Works Projects Administration to encourage economic growth.\n\nPart of this project was creating work for artists like Dux Alexander, who designed a series of prints to attract tourists to American national parks.\n\nThe Motherland calls!\n\nOne of the most iconic images in Soviet propaganda, The Motherland Calls features a woman in red staring into the viewers’ eyes as she leads a sea of bayonettes with her left hand held high. In her right hand she holds the oath of the Red Army.\n\nThe artist, Iralki Toidze, is said to have modeled the woman on his wife who, on the day of the German invasion, ran into his studio crying out news of the war. Toidze told her to freeze and immediately began sketching.\n\nVertigo\n\nThe poster for Alfred Hitchcock’s blockbuster was designed by Saul Bass, who was also famous for his film title-sequences. He was the first to create stylised sequences that integrated with the movie and set the audience’s mood\n\nThe poster’s vertiginous design shows two figures tumbling into the warped space Bass created using geometric shapes called hypotrochoid curves.\n\nAttack of the 50 Foot Woman\n\nCinema-goers were no strangers to oversized men and giant apes, but 1958 saw the first female colossus hit the city in Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.\n\nPainted by realist artist Reynold Brown, the movie poster shows the giant woman terrorising citizens from what looks like a height much greater than 50 feet.\n\nSave These Lives\n\nIn 1964, ten members of the African National Congress, including Walter Sisulu and Nelson Mandela, were charged with sabotage against the apartheid state.\n\nThe Anti-Apartheid Movement created this poster as part of a global campaign in response to fears that the defendants would be sentenced to death.\n\nJaws\n\nCapturing our fear of the unknown in one image, Roger Kaste’s poster shows the moment before the great white attacks Chrissie Watkins.\n\nThe story’s first kill was also seen on the front cover of Peter Benchley's novel, on which the Spielberg blockbuster was based, but it was Kastel who made the shark a more life-like threat baring ragged rows of teeth.\n\nDie Gute Form\n\nThe dominant poster style that emerged after World War II came to be known as International Typographic Style. Its bold use of sans serif typefaces (especially Helvetica, the rising star of the font world) and monochrome photography was perfect for striking but clear communication in a global marketplace.\n\nThis poster by Armin Hofmann, one of the Swiss movement’s leading figures, is typical of the style with its grid-based design.\n\nSwiss Typography\n\nAnother pioneer of typography, Wolfgang Weingart brought a sense of chaos back to poster art.\n\nHis offset printing experiments would break many of his predecessors’ rules and usher in the the new era of post-modern design as we know it today.\n\nPeace\n\nThe universal symbol for peace was originally designed by Gerald Holtom for the British nuclear disarmament movement.\n\nThe artist created this poster for a march from Trafalgar Square, London, to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston.\n\nThe lines within the circle mirror the shapes made when the letters N and D, standing for ‘nuclear disarmament’, are spelled out in flag semaphore by a signalman.\n\nThe Guinness Toucan\n\nJohn Gilroy was the designer behind the memorable zoo animals in early Guinness ads. Most famous was the toucan, which came to represent the Guinness brand.\n\nThe copy accompanying the design was penned by English poet, playwright and crime writer Dorothy Sayers, whose time in the ad industry inspired her detective story, Murder Must Advertise.\n\nI Am A Man\n\nOn April 3, 1968, Memphis workers went on strike to fight for the right to unionise, following the death of two African-American sanitation workers.\n\nPrinted placards bearing the statement ‘I Am A Man’ were held by members who gathered at the Mason Temple\n\nIt was to these 1,300 people that Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ‘I’ve Been to the Mountaintop’ speech. He was assassinated the next day.\n\nSweet Corn Festival\n\nSteve Frykholm’s designs began life as internal posters for the annual summer picnics at Herman Miller, where he began working in 1970.\n\nHis bold, foodie screen prints were so popular they became a highlight of the event for 20 years. Ultimately, the series found fame outside the company walls when they were exhibited at major institutions like New York’s Museum of Modern Art.\n\nChe\n\nThe image of Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara has entered popular culture and come to stand for revolution everywhere.\n\nThis high-contrast design of the Argentinian icon was created by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick. If you look closely you’ll see the initial F that the artist hid on Che’s shoulder.\n\n‘High Noon 4 June’\n\nSolidarity, the first non-government trade union in a Soviet-bloc country, was a driving force in Poland’s transition from one-party communism to modern democracy.\n\nThis lithographic by Tomasz Sarneck was used during the Polish election of 1989. It features Gary Cooper, star of American western ‘High Noon’, with a Solidarity badge on his chest and a ballot in his hand.\n\n1972 Summer Olympics\n\nAs lead designer for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Otl Aicher created designs inspired by Alpine colours.\n\nThese colours were used thematically so that visitors could find their way around the Olympic village.\n\nAicher also designed pictographs for use around the site, and the influence of his round-ended stick figures can be seen on city signage today.\n\nNew way of office copying\n\nThe Xerox 914 was the first of its kind: an office copier that produced black & white copies on ordinary paper at the touch of a button.\n\nOur 650-pound baby hit offices in 1960 and changed the way we work forever.\n\nMarilyn Diptych\n\nAndy Warhol popularised screen printing in the 1960s with his colourful pop art images of celebrities, Coca-Cola bottles and cans of Campbell’s Soup.\n\nThe Marilyn Diptych was created in 1962 after the death of the star and shows 50 images of her face, 25 in colour, 25 in monochrome.\n\nRumble in the Jungle\n\nThe 1974 World Heavyweight Championship boxing match – also known as the Rumble in the Jungle – pitted undefeated world heavyweight champion George Foreman against challenger Mohammad Ali.\n\nHeld in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the Rumble ended in the eighth round with an Ali victory by knockout.\n\nGot Milk?\n\nMany famous faces have donned a white moustache under the ‘got milk?’ banner since the posters first appeared in the nineties.\n\nCreated for the California Milk Processer Board, the milk-endorsing campaign has been credited with boosting dairy milk consumption in the California area and beyond. This 1996 image features baseball's Cal Ripken, Jr.\n\nLive Aid\n\nJuly 13, 1985 was celebrated as ‘the day that music changed the world.’\n\nOrganised to raise money for famine relief efforts in Ethiopia, simultaneous concerts took place in arenas in London and Pennsylvania, linked for live broadcast.\n\nIt’s estimated that to date the event has helped raise over $230 million for famine relief.\n\nSilence=Death\n\nIn 1984, the Center for Disease Control reported 4,177 known cases of AIDS in America. Politicians, however, stayed silent on the epidemic.\n\nIn response, six gay activists formed the Silence=Death Project in New York. This poster appeared around the city with the message that open discussion was the only way to tackle the devastating issue.\n\nThe pink triangle recalls the shape used to mark out homosexuals in Nazi camps. In the poster it is inverted to symbolise the disavowal of victimhood.\n\nForest / Woods / Tree / Death\n\nThis World Wide Fund for Nature poster used symbols and minimalist storytelling to raise awareness of the threat of deforestation. The three Chinese characters on the left can be translated as Forest, Woods, and Tree, each one reducing in turn, and the final symbol, stripped of its leaves, is not a character but a cross.\n\nHOPE\n\nBefore it came to represent Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, Shepard Fairey’s poster was designed in one day and sold on the street by the artist.\n\nIts bold stencil design features a simple colour palette of blues, beige and red. ‘Hope’, ‘Change’, ‘Progress’ and other slogans were used at the foot of the image.\n\nOnly for children\n\nAdvertising agency Grey Spain worked with the ANAR Foundation, a Spanish child-advocacy organisation, to create a poster that to most passers-by at street level read: ‘Sometimes child abuse is only visible to the child suffering it.’\n\nLook from a child’s height, however, and you see bruises on the boy’s face and a different message: ‘If somebody hurts you, phone us and we’ll help you.’\n\nWith this smart use of lenticular printing, the foundation got their message safely to children who might need it.\n\nMaking drinking water out of thin air\n\nThis billboard in Lima, Peru, is another great example of a poster that does as well as shows. Look inside and you’ll find five machines with built-in filtration systems that turn moisture in the air into drinking water.\n\nAtmospheric humidity in Lima is around 98 percent but only half an inch of rain falls each year. This poster was created by UTEC, the country’s biggest university of engineering and technology, as a very practical response to the challenging conditions. It also served to attract more students to the university.\n\nDumb Ways to Die\n\nThe hapless characters in this rail safety campaign by Metro Trains in Melbourne, Australia, proved there are plenty of dumb ways to die – and helped to save lives along the way.\n\nIn 2012 the posters ran in parallel with a viral video and early results showed an amazing 20 percent reduction in accidents and near-misses on the Melbourne Metro.\n\nVisit Mars\n\nSpace Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) was founded by Elon Musk with the dream of one day taking humans to Mars.\n\nThe company created a series of posters looking ahead to a possible future of interstellar tourism when travellers can explore the Red Planet’s moons, its valleys and Olympus Mons which, as this poster tells us, is ‘the solar system’s highest peak.’\n\nWhen can we book our tickets?\n\nBonus Poster\n\nBrother Dominic\n\nOkay, he may not have saved lives or won elections, but this monk changed our world at Xerox.\n\nHitting the screen in a Super Bowl ad in 1975, Brother Dominic went on to become the face of Xerox in the eighties. In posters like this one, he shared the good news that technology can do miraculous things for your working life."
