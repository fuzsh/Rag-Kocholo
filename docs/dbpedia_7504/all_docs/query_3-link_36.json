They were originally produced in English but we are delighted to say you can now download the complete set in 8 languages including French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese Brazilian, French Canadian, Simplified Chinese and English.\n\nThe women featured serve as amazing role models in their fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (or STEM as it’s often referred to). You can listen to our episode on STEM Role Models here.\n\nWe’d love you to download the posters and print them out for your school or workplace. By taking part, you’ll help raise awareness of their achievements, and hopefully inspire a new generation of girls and women in STEM.\n\nWe’re really enjoying seeing these posters on walls all around the world.

The case Maria filed languished in court for two decades, while her husband remained free. Years later, in a landmark ruling, the Court of Human Rights criticised the Brazilian government for not taking effective measures to prosecute and convict perpetrators of domestic violence. In response to this, the Brazilian government in 2006 enacted a law now known as the Maria da Penha Law on Domestic and Family Violence, which increased the severity of punishment for domestic violence against women, whenever it occurred in a domestic or family environment.\n\nArtist: Camila Rosa.
