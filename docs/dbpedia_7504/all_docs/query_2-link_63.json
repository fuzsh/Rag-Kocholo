        "text": "In technology and urban development, the Tōkaidō Shinkansen project and the futuristic elevated highways. In architecture, the Yoyogi National Gymnasium, designed by Tange Kenzō, and in graphic design, the iconic Tokyo Olympics logo designed by Yusaku Kamekura, were examples of the new modern identity that Japan sought to convey to the world.\n\nThat same year, Japan’s top designers, photographers, and copywriters [among them, Yusaku Kamekura and Hiromu Hara], sponsored by the most important companies [Asahi Breweries, Asahi Kasei, Nippon Steel, Toshiba, Toyota Motor, Nikon, NKK, Nomura Securities] formed the Nippon Design Center [NDC], an organization that aims to develop and improve the quality of Japanese advertising on a large scale. The NDC was officially established in March 1960 and cooperated in designing the identity of each of the 1964 Olympics events.\n\nThese events, along with the 1960 World Design Conference, held in Tokyo, established Japan as a new global design epicenter. Kiroku Higaki being a design student himself, suddenly was in the front row of the new need for design happening in every industry, one of them being, Cinema.\n\nStill, in 1959, the NCC [Nippon Cinema Corporation], an independent film distribution company founded in 1948, hired Kiroku Higaki as an intern of its promotion team, working on newsletters and ads for the magazine \"Screen\". Even though it was a part-time job, NCC [which in 1961 was bought by Kadokawa Herald Pictures] provided him with the opportunity to work in the industry from day one.\n\nThe next year, in 1960, Nobuhiro Tachibana, the head of the advertising division at NCC, wrote a letter of recommendation for Higaki, but he still had to pass an interview and a test to enter Toho-Towa. The interview never happened, but he did take the test, consisting in designing a newspaper ad for the movie, The Lost Alibi [黒い画集, 1960]. However, he did not receive any response from the company about the results.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks, Higaki went to Toho-Towa to ask for them, and that’s when he met legendary movie poster designer known for his calligraphy, Susumu Masukawa who informed him that he didn’t receive a proper response because he was on a business trip in Takarazuka and put him to work immediately. Just like that, he became a designer at the number one company in the Japanese cinema industry, Toho-Towa, and was assigned to their top design team with Masukawa himself, who became his new mentor and boss alongside the distinguished illustrator, Shin Nakamura.\n\nHis new job at Toho-Towa would coincide with the creation of the Toho Art Bureau, preceded by his boss, Susumu Masukawa, an area specialized in the design and promotion of Toho films. His first task at the studio was to cut still frames from the film Desperado Outpost [独立愚連隊, 1959].\n\nBefore Toho Art Bureau, not all posters were produced in color and photomontage was heavily underused. So although Higaki did not plan for this, he would eventually come to develop the blueprint of the “Toho-Tawa graphic style” of movie posters.\n\nDuring the first half of the 60s, under the guidance of Susumu Masukawa, Artistic Director of Toho-Towa, Higaki polished his design skills. At this point, he didn’t make any movie logos yet [that was a job still reserved for his master], but he became highly skilled in photomontage and composition. This is particularly notable in his Spaghetti Western works of the time.\n\nA Western is a movie set in the second half of the 19th Century in the Western US. While, Spaghetti Western, is the term used to describe movies that were made in European countries [especially, Italy, because it was cheaper to make films there], during the early ’60s to early ’70s but remained close to the American west, both in theme and aesthetic. A Western and a Spaghetti Western are essentially the same thing but differ in where the movies are made.\n\nThis particular genre can be seen as one of the first iterations of action movies, heavily using the figure of a hero, a villain, and the conflict between them. That is why it was perfect for young poster designers such as Higaki to improve their technique because all the elements to make a great poster were already there.\n\nAt this early stage of his career, two works would heavily influence his style, the poster of Akira Kurosawa's classic, Yojimbo [用心棒, 1961] that he designed alongside his mentor and the poster for Sergio Corbucci's DJANGO [1966], a re-interpretation of Yojimbo. Using the experience that both works provided him, Kiroku Higaki cemented his position as a trusted designer of blockbuster films, working for the DJANGO saga well into the beginning of the 70s.\n\nDesigning a movie poster at the time was a slow process, especially in countries like Japan. Studios in Hollywood and other parts of the world provided distributors with a limited number of design resources, like photos of actors and actresses, images of official props, and color palettes. Asking for more resources was also off the table, as movie stars only worked with a small circle of certified photographers whose work was incredibly expensive. And oftentimes, the prop images studios sent over were useless, and obviously, asking for different ones came at a price.\n\nFor these reasons, designers constantly had to overcome challenges by using still frames from trailers and pre-screening copies, and making and shooting props themselves. Yet, the logo design was the trickiest part, since they had to adapt the title to a totally different writing system, without leaving aesthetics and cultural needs behind. Making a poster was critical for a movie in many ways but still, it was the last step in a long and complex promotional process.\n\nThe promotion and distribution of foreign films in mid-20th Century Japan was an artisan work based almost entirely on the intuition of the distribution companies and their leaders. Japanese production companies acting as distributors, bought theatrical screening rights from foreign studios in Hollywood, based on closed-door screenings of the films reserved for “staff members” only and Chief Officers [President, Vice-President and General Managers of Distribution and Advertisement] had the last word. If a movie seemed to have the potential to be a success at the box office, the screening rights were bought, if not, the film might never be released.\n\nHowever, Toho-Towa was interested in creating new and loyal audiences, even with films that were classified as artistic and not necessarily successful. That is why, in 1961, they created the ATG [Art Theater Guild], a limited distribution division for these types of movies. Through this, beginning in 1996, Kiroku Higaki would work as the lead designer, allowing him to experiment with new techniques and themes.\n\nDuring his time at ATG, Higaki showed his skill to successfully portray abstract imagery, as proven in his poster for the documentary Loin du Vietman [1967], in which he uses fighter jets as the symbol of the United States instead of the traditional stars. As well as, his work for the classic, Citizen Kane [1941 released in Japan in 1966] where he used a halftone effect, to make it look like a newspaper and allude to the journalistic theme of the story.\n\nBut above all, there are three posters of this period that became a staple of his pushing forward approach to poster design: The “ATG trilogy”, three cult classic movies distributed by ATG that although not related to each other, shared a common poster design language, that is, black and white images with a solid color. The movies of the trilogy are Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors [1966, 1969], Procès de Jeanne d'Arc, [1962, 1969], and Au Hasard Balthazar [1966, 1970].\n\nThe Cannonball Run [1981]\n\nIn the early 1980s, Toho-Towa had to compete not only against rival studios and television but also with the growing number of stores and boutiques that took the attention of the audience on the streets. That's why posters with huge logos [called “Ben-Hur logos” in the industry, after the iconic 1959 film poster], became popular. The poster for The Cannonball Run was one of Higaki's favorites, as it not only contained a massive iconic logo, but also the \"exploding\" composition that he would constantly use that decade. The illustrations accompanying the logo were done by Shin Nakamura, a longtime collaborator of Higaki and Toho-Towa.\n\nSuspiria [1977]\n\nRedesigning the iconic logo for Dario Argento's Suspiria was tricky, however, Kiroku Higaki successfully adapted the \"wavy\" letters to katakana, this title style would become really important for his own work with horror-themed movies.\n\nFor the poster, he kept the iconic illustration of the original design, colored bright green a still frame of Jessica Harper, and used yellow for the logo. He was looking for a strong contrast.\n\nAs he puts it, “the color palette was closer to the Chinese traditional design than to European horror cinema” but it worked well.\n\nZombi 2 [Released in Japan in 1980]\n\nFor the poster for the cult movie, Zombi 2, Higaki wasn’t informed about the plot of it, he didn’t even watch a trailer, all he knew is that it was a zombie movie that happened in New York, so he went with his gut and decided to give it the aesthetics of Suspiria, with the logo, the colors and a photo of the city.\n\nSanguelia was the title that Toho-Towa decided for the film in Japan against the desires of the producers in Italy, which caused conflict between them. On top of that, there are two logos in the poster, Higaki’s and the one designed by Susumu Masukawa, written in English.\n\nDie Hard [1989]\n\nWhen Die Hard premiered, Bruce Willis wasn’t associated with action movies, since he debuted just a year before in the romcom Blind Date. Because of that, producers weren’t sure about using his face on the poster, that’s why the first version of it didn’t show his face at all.\n\nOnce Die Hard became a box office hit, 20th Century Fox ordered a new design for the movie. Kiroku Higaki using his knowledge of “selling” protagonists that DJANGO and Blade Runner taught him, heavily pushed Willis in his poster.\n\nThe design was exactly what the studio wanted and became \"world pattern\", used even in the United States as the official poster.\n\nEmpire of the Sun [1989]\n\nHigaki rarely watched the films he was designing for, he didn't have time to do it, he relied on trailers, their plots and the graphic material studios gave him to work.\n\nEmpire of the Sun was an exception. He lived his childhood during WWII and was part of the first generation of Japanese children that had the opportunity to go to school after the war ended. Because of that, he deeply identified with the protagonist, a British kid trapped in China during the Japanese occupation and WWII.\n\nThese personal feelings are depicted in the poster of Empire of the Sun, where he merged together two different scenes of the movie to make a touching composition that remains his favorite work to date."
