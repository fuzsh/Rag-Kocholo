        "text": "“Citizen Kane,” “The Godfather” or “Raiders of the Lost Ark” it’s not.\n\nBut “I Was a Teenage Mummy” holds a place in movie history.\n\nIn Westport, anyway.\n\nAnd if you were in town 60 years ago today, you remember it well.\n\nThe film had its world premiere on April 26, 1963 in the Staples High School auditorium.\n\nA full house — 1,200 people — packed the place. The next night there were 2 more showings, both also sellouts. Tickets were 75 cents in advance, $1 at the door.\n\nLife Magazine and the New York Times covered the event. Hugh Downs invited the cast onto the “Today Show.”\n\nNot bad for a 90-minute film, produced and acted by a group of feisty Long Lots Junior High 9th graders.\n\nOf course, they had adult help: a 21-year-old, with fantasies of Hollywood.\n\nJeffrey Mullin — one of the “Teenage Mummy” stars — went onto a 40-year career as a documentary filmmaker. He learned editing and cinematography from legendary documentarian Bill Buckley, and between 1985 and 2008, worked with Buckley and fellow Westporter Tracy Sugarman.\n\nThese days, Mullin is retired. But as the 60th anniversary of his teenage adventure drew near he checked in with “06880” from his Cape Cod home, with a trove of materials.\n\n“Mummy” — a satire on horror movies — was the brainchild of that 21-year-old, Ralph Bluemke (part-time manager of a Stamford theater).\n\nHe enlisted his Half Mile Common neighbor Mullin, Allen Skinner of nearby Cross Highway, Steve Emmett and Jayne Walker. Michael Harris played the mummy. Jeff’s 8-year-old brother Scott was the villain.\n\nThey raised funds by selling “stock” in Jerall Films (a combination of their names) to parents and friends.\n\nFilming began in September of 1962. Locales includes beaches (for “the desert”), Longshore, and an auto chase scene throughout town.\n\nThe Westport Police Department let the teenagers “borrow” a police car — and officer. An auto dealer provided a Cadillac. And, Life reported, “one mother was conned out of her new Mercedes.”\n\nThe movie also includes a scene at Idlewild (now John F. Kennedy) Airport. Jayne Walker’s father — a TWA pilot — held his passengers on board for half an hour while the main characters scurried up the steps, and were filmed “disembarking.”\n\nIt ran through January, with interruptions when the cast had to raise more cash. The go-to job was babysitting.\n\nThe total cost: about $375.\n\nAfter its Westport premiere, Life magazine said, the film was booked into theaters in Fairfield and nearby counties.\n\n“I Was a Teenage Mummy” did not reach the enduring fame of “The Wizard of Oz.” It’s not mentioned with classics like “The Jazz Singer” or “Star Wars.”\n\nBut for a few brief springtime weeks — beginning 60 years ago today — “Teenage Mummy” was very much alive and well in Westport.\n\n(If a story happened — or happens — here, “06880” covers it.

Thank you!)\n\nIn today’s technologically marvelous world, any kid with a camera and a computer can make a movie.\n\nLocal teenagers do it uncommonly well. Nick Ribolla (“Welcome to Westport“) is one viral sensation example; there are countless others.\n\nIn 1962, movie-making was considerably more difficult.\n\nSo when a group of Westport youngsters made a feature-length, color production, everyone took notice.\n\nAnd by “everyone,” I mean the New York Times and Life magazine — along with plenty of movie-goers.\n\n“I Was a Teenage Mummy” was a spoof of classic horror films. The plot is typical: a 3,700-year-old mummy menaces (of course) Westport.\n\nThe movie was the brainchild of Ralph Bluemke. He was the “old guy” — 22.\n\nHis co-producers were Jeff Mullin (15) and Allen Skinner (14). The cast — all local kids — ranged in age from 15 down to 9.\n\nAll the cameras were borrowed. “A local automobile dealer lent a Cadillac for one sequence,” Life reports, “and one mother was conned out of her new Mercedes.”\n\nThe Westport Police Department lent a cop car — and a cop.\n\nSome scenes were shot at Longshore; “suburban homes were pillaged for props and costumes.”\n\nSomehow, a pilot at Idlewild Airport (now JFK) persuaded passengers to sit in their seats for half an hour after landing, while a climactic scene was filmed.\n\nLike any moviemaker, Bluemke faced challenges. The mummy’s makeup took 3 hours to apply each day. And “a passing train or somebody dashing by in a bathing suit could bug a whole scene,” he told Life.\n\n“I Was a Teenage Mummy” had its world premiere at the Fine Arts Theatre (now Restoration Hardware) on April 26, 1963. The next night, there were 2 screenings at in the Staples High School auditorium.\n\nThough “obviously an amateur production,” a website notes, “the details are spot on. Lots of little touches and accurate costume details that make it an impressive achievement for a group of youngsters, or adults for that matter. It doesn’t take itself too seriously.”\n\nMore than half a century after its release, “Teenage Mummy” lives on. You can buy a DVD for $10.\n\nRalph Bluemke — the young director — thought of everything, cinematically speaking.\n\nBut he never imagined that 50 years later, anyone with a TV could watch his film about a 3,700-year-old mummy terrorizing his — now our — suburban town."
