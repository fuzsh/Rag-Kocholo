Like the armed services, the people at home had to do their bit. The government used posters, leaflets, film and radio broadcasts to get its message over to the public.\n\nPosters were put up in local shops, public buildings and village halls. These posters were used to give different messages. For example, the famous ‘Dig for Victory’ posters were used as the government wanted people to grow their own food during wartime. Special government films were made and shown in cinemas to persuade people to behave in certain ways. There was no television or internet in those days.\n\nUse this lesson to take a closer look at some posters and a film clip to find out how they were used to persuade people to play their part on the home front during the Second World War.\n\nTasks\n\nBackground\n\nAll of the posters used in this lesson are the work of artists who worked for the government Ministry of Information formed in 1939. The posters were used to try and influence public opinion.\n\nFor example, people were encouraged to grow their own food, and save waste. This was because it was difficult to import food from other countries during wartime. Kitchen waste could be fed to hens and pigs. People were asked to salvage as many materials as they could. Wastepaper, metal or bones could be made into planes and ammunition.\n\nTravel within Britain was to be limited at all times. Posters with the slogan ‘Is your journey really necessary?’ were used to remind people to save fuel and allow trains to transport soldiers and war supplies instead.\n\nSome posters encouraged women to work in factories to make weapons or planes. Others called women to join the Land Army to work on farms ‘for a healthy, happy job’.\n\nThe Ministry of Information was also keen to explain to the people the danger of ‘careless talk’. They wanted the public to become much more careful about security because information or secrets might be used by enemy spies listening in.\n\nPosters were also used to up keep morale or wartime spirit. They made it clear that everybody was in this war together and everybody had an important part to play. This also helped the public to feel involved. This really mattered if Britain wanted the workers in the factories to make as many planes, bombs, and tanks as they could or farmers to grow as much as possible.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the people faced many dangers such as the bombing of cities, ports and factories. They also had accidents caused by the blackout. Health during the war was a big worry for Britain. The public needed to keep fit and healthy in order to work and keep up production in the factories and on the land. Therefore the Ministry of Information produced many posters on these subjects.\n\nTeachers' notes\n\nThe posters used in the lesson show how the government encouraged people to salvage certain materials for the war and pointed out the dangers of ‘careless talk’. Teachers are advised from the start to ensure that students understand the meaning of key words such as:\n\nSalvage: collecting and reusing or recycling waste material\n\nPersuade: to try and change a person’s mind or way of thinking\n\nSlogan: catchword or catch phrase, such as ‘Dig for Victory’\n\nThe lesson can be used to support literacy for Key stage 2 on the concept of persuasive writing. Students can explore how the language of these government posters is used to persuade. They can look in detail at persuasive devices such as slogans, humour and emotive language. They can consider how persuasive language is used to gain attention, influence and inform and can be adapted for different audiences and purposes. Teachers may wish for the students to work in pairs or small groups on individual sources and report back to the group.\n\nThe lesson could also serve as an introduction to the concept of propaganda within the history classroom for Key stage 2. Students could be encouraged to use a dictionary to find the meaning of propaganda, then discuss whether these posters help explain the term and why did the government felt the need to do this.\n\nUsing the sources pupils can examine the power of the images themselves and their techniques of persuasion. They could discuss the differences between the strength of the visual over the written. How effective would the posters be without their words? The film clip used here offers further opportunities to compare the power of the moving image. Which is more effective, poster or film?\n\nThe questions increase in difficulty. Task 2 builds on the understanding of the concept of ‘persuasive writing’ acquired in Task 1. Task 3 gives students an opportunity to transfer it to the medium of film. This work could also be extended using the film archive in The Art of War website in Related Resources that contains clips from a wide range of public information films for the Second World War. For example, in the archive there is a film that was used to encourage people to save scraps to feed hens, featuring a talking chicken. This directly relates to the illustrative image used at the top of the web page for this lesson.\n\nExtension tasks\n\n1. Students could examine a selection of television or magazine advertisements (supplied by the teacher) and consider their persuasive techniques. Students then create advertisements for their own products.\n\n2. Students design a poster for recycling today:\n\nWrite a slogan\n\nDoes your slogan persuade or convince people to recycle?\n\nMake clear what things should be saved\n\nMake clear why they are useful\n\nMake your poster colourful\n\n3. Students produce their own leaflet to persuade others of a particular point of view, presenting the case for or against ending school uniform or changing school holidays, for example.\n\nSources\n\nBanner image: ‘Save Kitchen Waste to Feed The Hens’, Ministry of Food, 1939-1945.
