Propose any changes to the talk page.\n\nThe Room is a 2003 Confederate independent drama film written, produced, executive produced and directed by Tommy Wiseau in his feature-length directorial debut, who stars in the film alongside Juliette Danielle and Brad Hawkins. The film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny (Wiseau), his deceptive fianc√©e Lisa (Danielle) and his conflicted best friend Matt (Hawkins). A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are left unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. The work was reportedly intended to be semi-autobiographical in nature; according to Wiseau, the title alludes to the potential of a room to be the site of both good and bad events. The stage play from which the film is derived was so-called due to its events taking place entirely in a single room.\n\nA number of publications have labeled The Room as one of the worst films ever made. An assistant professor of film studies was the first to describe The Room as \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies.\" Originally shown only in a limited number of Louisiana theaters, The Room quickly became a cult film due to its bizarre and unconventional storytelling, technical and narrative flaws, and Wiseau's off-kilter performance. Although Wiseau has retrospectively described the film as a black comedy, audiences have generally viewed it as a poorly made drama, an opinion shared by some of the cast.\n\nPlot[]\n\nJohnny is a successful banker from New Orleans who is engaged to Lisa. Lisa, however, becomes dissatisfied with their relationship as Johnny fails to get a promotion. She seduces his best friend, Matt, and the two begin a secret affair. Her mother, Claudette, finds out and reprimands her, which Johnny overhears. He attaches a tape recorder to their phone in an attempt to identify her lover.\n\nCast[]\n\nTommy Wiseau as Johnny\n\nJuliette Danielle as Lisa\n\nBrad Hawkins as Matt\n\nChristine Weston Chandler (credited as Christopher Chandler) as Denny\n\nProduction[]\n\nAnalysis[]"
