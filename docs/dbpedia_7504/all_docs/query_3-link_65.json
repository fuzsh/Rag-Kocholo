In 1997, 55% of Americans wrongly believed they could become infected by sharing a glass of water, up from 48% in ’91. Ignorance is bliss. 29% of Americans living with HIV have no health insurance. ADAP (AIDS Drug Assistance Program) is bankrupt in over half of the 50 states, which means that they cannot provide access to the protease cocktail. The protease cocktail costs $16,000 per year per person. Ignorance is bliss. Unprotected sex is the main risk behavior amongst teenagers, accounting for 55% of reported HIV infection in young men, and 37% in young women, as of 1996. While 95% of Americans believe that public schools should provide HIV prevention education, frank discussion of sexuality and condoms in the classroom is still virtually taboo. Ignorance is bliss. Last year, 41% of Americans wrongly believed they could contract HIV from a public toilet, up from 34% in ’91. Ignorance is bliss. AIDS deaths are down. Transmission is up. More people are living with AIDS. Nearly half of HIV+ people undergoing triple-combination therapy have developed resistance, rendering the drugs useless. Ignorance is bliss. One person is infected with HIV in the US every 13 minutes. Ignorance is bliss. 33 Americans are infected every day due to lack of access to needle-exchange programs. 66% of Americans approve of need-exchange programs, yet the government has maintained the ban on funding for needle-exchange. Ignorance is bliss. More than 40% of AIDS cases worldwide are among women. 16,000 people become infected with HIV every day. By the year 2000, there will be more than 40 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. AIDS is over, right?\n\nDAY WITHOUT ART\n\nDecember 1, 1998\n\nthe tenth international day of actin and mourning in response to the AIDS crisis\n\nDon’t turn your back on AIDS.\n\nSTOP AIDS.\n\nMake the Promise.\n\nEach of us can help stop the spread of HIV and reduce the impact of AIDS.\n\nYou don’t have to be a top scientist working on a cure to make a difference.\n\nProtecting yourself and others from HIV infection, welcoming someone living with HIV into your life or even just talking about HIV and AIDS can help.\n\nAre you taking action?\n\nMake your promise now at www.worldaidscampaign.org"
