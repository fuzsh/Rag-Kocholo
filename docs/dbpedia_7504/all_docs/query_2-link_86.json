        "text": "So, yes. If it is indeed a documentary about movie posters, at least in those released in the United States, it should really be called ‚ÄúTwenty Seven by Forty One‚Äù‚Ä¶which is the approximate size of a one sheet. However, when Kevin Burke started out, he had been inspired by his love for movie posters that had been hand illustrated and drawn, like those of our great John Alvin, as well as the likes of Bob Peak and Richard Amsel. When the studios switched to all photoshopped and photographic images, making the posters lackluster and boring, and largely devoid of artistry, he turned to Mondo and other companies creating after-market fan inspired, fan-made posters for movie lovers who already knew the movies, and enjoyed art that played on aspects of a movie that true fans would appreciate‚Ä¶\n\nThese pieces are created by artists who have more of a graphics and comic illustrator background, and they are not meant to SELL a movie. They are meant to be enjoyed by people who have already seen them. These posters are mainly sized at 24 x 36, hence the movie‚Äôs name.\n\n(as example of subject matter, imagine a big black poster with just one small image in the center, featuring a tiny red sled. This would be something fans of Citizen Kane would appreciate, but would not inspire anyone who hadn‚Äôt seen the movie to seek it out.)\n\nKevin informed me during the day we talked and his crew filmed me for his documentary, when we at ArtInsights and he started a dialogue, he realized he could interview artists who either still actively illustrate traditionally or who had been working when posters were designed by professional artists to actively get movie fans to go see something in a theater. We helped him get in contact with those in the know, and we also talked a lot about getting traditionally illustrated movie posters made again for movies in the future. (BECAUSE WE FEEL PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS!)\n\nThere are tons of artists working for the companies making alternate posters that will be part of the movie, many of which as seriously great‚Äì(OLLY & LAURENT, I‚ÄôM LOOKING AT YOU!)\n\nThere are also some great artists we know who have been working inside the studios and in Hollywood and are working with them too, they are masters at the art of movie posters..these folks are actually making the movie posters that get people to get to see the movies.\n\nand we are so excited about the idea of them making many more new images for new movies, and have plans‚Ä¶stay tuned!\n\nWe are so looking forward to this movie now, although wish we could change the name üòâ"
