        "text": "I saw him interviewed last year, and thought he looke really frail, and didn’t realize he was well into his 70’s.\n\nDied today at 76 of cancer.\n\nAlso didn’t realize (or forgot I knew) he was Albert Brooks’s brother (you can sort of understand why Albert changed his name…)\n\nEinstein did two episodes on Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee and I really enjoyed them, even though I wasn’t ever a Super Dave fan. (Larry Middleman and Marty Funkhouser, however, I adored.)\n\nWas just reminiscing about the old Bizarre show (with John Byner) where Super Dave was “born.” That was some funny, irreverent, early-80s stuff.\n\nSuper Dave has long been a favorite of mine. I did try a couple years ago to find a version of his hat, but surprisingly it wasn’t available anywhere, even though there is some SD merch out there.\n\nThis is going to sound kind of crazy, but I thought he had died some time ago, and in fact I was certain he had died onstage. But after googling around, I must be thinking of a story he or Albert Brooks told about their father, who did in fact die onstage in fact mid-joke, prompting Milton Berle (seated next to him) to joke, Is there a doctor in the house?\n\nAnyway, I remember watching Super Dave way back in the days of Bizarre also, I used to have to sneak that one because I remember it having the occasional bare breasted woman too. The guy was always a riot, and I loved that he turned up again on Arrested Development.\n\nAt one point maybe 2-3 years ago he was a regular on the Dan Lebatard ESPN Radio show. He would pick NFL football teams during the season. Well the show had a string of pickers die (some famous wrestler, the father from The Facts of Life) and Einstein refused to do the show anymore."
