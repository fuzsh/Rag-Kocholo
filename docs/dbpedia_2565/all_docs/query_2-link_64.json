        "text": "Bob Einstein—the straight-faced comedian best known for his characters Super Dave, Marty Funkhouser, and Larry Middleman—died on Wednesday at the age of 76. Remembered for his iconic roles on Arrested Development, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and as Super Dave, Einstein's unique delivery and gravely voice had become something of comedy legend. Outside his appearances as Super Dave, he's probably best known for his role on Curb Your Enthusiasm for five seasons as Larry David's bothersome friend Marty Funkhouser.\n\nBut, his most memorable moment came in the ninth episode of Season Seven. During this season, Larry was putting together a Seinfeld reunion with the original cast. At the first table read, Funkhouser randomly shows up and wants to meet Jerry Seinfeld. Despite Larry's protests Funkhouser introduces himself to Jerry and insists on telling him a joke.\n\nNow, according to Curb lore, the script just said \"Marty tells a joke,\" and Einstein proceeded to improve an absolutely filthy minute-long joke.\n\nWhen he delivers the punchline, Jerry doubles over with laughter.\n\n\"It surprised me,\" Jerry tells Funkhouser after he finishes the joke. \"I had no idea it would be that revolting.\"\n\nThen when Funkhouser walks away, Jerry tells David, \"I like that guy.\"\n\nAnd, it turns out, as the two later recounted on an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, what we're seeing in the episode is actually the first take of the scene. They left it as is to preserve Jerry's reaction to the first time he heard the joke. This scene also happened to be the first time Einstein and Jerry ever met.\n\nIt acts as a perfect example of Einstein's talent, his deadpan delivery of extremely nasty jokes. It also shows his incredible improv ability, where he saved the most awkward, perfect joke to build the tension and humor in such a hilarious situation.\n\nOf course, there's also the time Funkhouser was trying to explain to Larry why his nephew couldn't masturbate anymore."
