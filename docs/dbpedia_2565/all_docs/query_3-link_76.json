        "text": "Hugh Hefner\n\nHugh Hefner, who parlayed $8,000 in borrowed money in 1953 to create Playboy, the hot-button media empire renowned for a magazine enriched with naked women and intelligent interviews just as revealing, died of natural causes Sept. 27 at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. He was 91. \"My father lived an exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer and a leading voice behind some of the most significant social and cultural movements of our time in advocating free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom,\" read a statement from Hefner's son, Cooper Hefner, chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises. While most famous for Playboy, the businessman dabbled in all forms of media, including hosting his own TV shows, beginning with Playboy’s Penthouse in the late 1950s and early '60s. Shot in his hometown of Chicago and syndicated, the show featured Hefner in a tuxedo and smoking a pipe surrounded by “playmates” and interviewing such celebrities as Bob Newhart, Don Adams and Sammy Davis Jr. Hefner also co-produced hundreds of Playboy-branded videos and a few feature films, such as Roman Polanski’s Macbeth and Monty Python’s first film, And Now for Something Completely Different, both released in 1971. He had been a sought-after guest on TV shows as far back as 1969 when he played a Control agent on an episode of Get Smart, and more recently he appeared on Curb Your Enthusiasm, Entourage and Sex and the City, as well as in animated shows like The Simpsons and Family Guy.\n\nJerry Lewis\n\nJerry Lewis, whose irrepressible zaniness and frantic creativity vaulted him to stardom as a comic movie star who wielded unparalleled green-light power at Paramount in the 1960s, died Aug. 20. He was 91. Lewis, who teamed with Dean Martin in the 1950s as one of the most successful tandems in the history of show business, at his home in Las Vegas, John Katsilometes of the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, citing a statement from Lewis' family. Publicist Candi Cazau confirmed the news. Lewis' health ailments over the years included open-heart surgery in 1983, surgery for prostate cancer in 1992, treatment for his dependence on prescription drugs in 2003, a heart attack in 2006 and a long bout with pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic lung disease for which he took Prednisone, causing his face and body to balloon. At the peak of their popularity, Martin and Lewis ruled nightclubs, radio and then the box office with their breezy yet physical comedy act, reigning as the top draw at theaters from 1950-56. After an acrimonious breakup with his partner, Lewis remained as the No. 1 movie draw through the mid-1960s on the strength of such classics as The Bellboy (1960) and The Nutty Professor (1963). As Paramount's biggest star, he had the creative freedom to make the movies he wanted to make. Lewis also was known for his efforts as national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. He devoted more than a half-century to fighting the neuromuscular disease, hosting an annual Labor Day telethon — and raising nearly $2.5 billion — from 1955 until he was ousted before the 2011 telecast. Lewis was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 for his efforts.\n\nTom Petty\n\nTom Petty died after suffering cardiac arrest on Oct. 2. The singer-songwriter was found unconscious at his home in Malibu in the early hours of Monday morning and passed away at 8:40 p.m local time after being taken to UCLA Medical Center, according to Petty's manager. \"On behalf of the Tom Petty family we are devastated to announce the untimely death of our father, husband, brother, leader and friend Tom Petty,\" Petty's manager said in a statement. \"He died peacefully surrounded by family, his bandmates and friends.\" Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers had just wrapped their 40th anniversary tour at the Hollywood Bowl the week prior to his death. Petty was born in Gainesville, Fla., on Oct. 20, 1950. Despite his easygoing, affable persona, Petty endured a rough childhood, living in poverty with an alcoholic, abusive father and a mother who was in fear of her husband. But a childhood handshake with Elvis Presley in the '50s piqued his interest in rock 'n' roll, and at the age of 17, inspired by The Beatles and The Byrds, Petty dropped out of high school to play rock with his band Mudcrutch. After that band broke up, Petty and several of its members formed Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, which catapulted him to the forefront of rock music for the next 40 years. (Mudcrutch reformed in 2007 and released two studio albums, 2008's self-titled and 2016's 2, his most recent studio effort.)\n\nHarry Dean Stanton\n\nHarry Dean Stanton, the character actor with the world-weary face who carved out an exceptional career playing grizzled loners and colorful, offbeat characters in such films as Paris, Texas and Repo Man, died at the age of 91. Stanton, who also was memorable in Cool Hand Luke (1967), Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), Ridley Scott’s Alien (1979), John Carpenter’s Escape From New York (1981) and John Hughes’ Pretty in Pink (1986) — in fact, what wasn’t he memorable in? — died Sept. 15 of natural causes at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, his agent, John Kelly, told The Hollywood Reporter. Stanton was eerily creepy as evil polygamist and self-proclaimed Mormon prophet Roman Grant on HBO’s Big Love, and he partnered regularly with David Lynch, appearing in the director’s Wild at Heart (1990), Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (1992) and the series' recent return, the 1993 miniseries Hotel Room, The Straight Story (1999) and Inland Empire (2006). (He said he turned down a meeting with Lynch about playing Dennis Hopper’s part as a serial killer in Blue Velvet.)\n\nMary Tyler Moore\n\nMary Tyler Moore, whose roles as a perky housewife on The Dick Van Dyke Show in the 1960s and as a spunky, single working woman in her eponymous ’70s sitcom made her America’s sweetheart, died Jan. 25. She was 80. \"Today, beloved icon, Mary Tyler Moore, passed away at the age of 80 in the company of friends and her loving husband of over 33 years, Dr. S. Robert Levine,\" Buxbaum said in a statement.

The cause of death was immediately unknown and under investigation by Detroit police. Later on Thursday, the medical examiner ruled Cornell's death as suicide by hanging. Two Detroit newspapers citing a police spokesman first reported that Cornell, who was on tour, was found with \"a band around his neck.\" Cornell was born July 20, 1964, in Seattle, which became the fertile crescent of the grunge rock scene in the 1980s. Cornell formed Soundgarden in 1984 with Kim Thayil and Hiro Yamamoto, both of whom he had played with in a Seattle cover band called The Shemps. Predating most of the grunge bands who would come to define the sound for the mainstream (Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains), Soundgarden were an essential force in establishing the sound of grunge — a melange of sludge metal, punk, distorted guitars, wounded vocals and lyrics about alienation. Soundgarden debuted with the 1987 EP Screaming Life on Sub Pop Records, which was followed by the 1988 EP Fopp prior to the band's full-length 1988 debut album, Ultramega OK, an essential touchstone in the codification of the grunge genre. Soundgarden's 1989 major-label debut for A&M Records, Louder Than Love, became their first album to chart on the Billboard 200, and they broke through commercially with 1991's Badmotorfinger, which produced the singles \"Jesus Christ Pose,\" \"Rusty Cage\" and \"Outshined\" (videos for the latter two songs got heavy MTV airplay).

The Philadelphia native also penned the 1962 pop song \"Palisades Park,\" a tribute to the old amusement park in New Jersey that was a hit for Freddy Cannon and figured high on Barris' list of career achievements.

Within its first year, Benderspink had sold more than 20 scripts and helped set up American Pie (1999), which grossed $235 million worldwide. It then signed a first-look production deal with New Line Cinema. Benderspink specialized in spec scripts, and the partners were instrumental in big sales for scripts that ended up becoming movies — ranging from Cats & Dogs (2001) and The Ring (2002) to Monster-in-Law (2005) and We’re the Millers (2013).

After being named CEO of National Geographic Channels in 2011, he put NatGeo on the map, helping to bring such hits as Wicked Tuna, Life Below Zero and the Emmy-nominated Brain Games to the screen. Lyle also took the channel into the scripted arena with Bill O'Reilly's Killing series, beginning with 2013's Killing Lincoln, starring Tom Hanks. That resulted in the company's first three scripted Emmy noms.

He was sent to the canvas just once in his career and was known for absorbing great punishment while stalking his opponents around the ring. \"I was able to convince my body that I could take it and nobody could hurt me,\" he told Esquire in 2012. \"I might've gotten cut, stitches over my eyes. Broken nose. Broken hands. But I never really got hurt.\" The ferocious brawler had a fabled six-bout rivalry with Sugar Ray Robinson, knocking him down in round one of their first fight in 1942 and handing one of history's greatest boxers his only loss in 131 career bouts a year later. (Incredibly, the two battled twice in a 21-day span in 1943.)\n\nTroy Gentry\n\nTroy Gentry, half of the country duo Montgomery Gentry, died Sept. 8 in a New Jersey helicopter crash.

Along with contemporaries like George Romero and John Carpenter, Hooper crafted some of the scariest nightmares that ever haunted moviegoers. Hooper directed 1982's Poltergeist from a script by Steven Spielberg and helmed the well-regarded 1979 miniseries Salem's Lot, from Stephen King's novel. Hooper was a little-known filmmaker of documentaries and TV commercials when he made his most famous work: 1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. He made it for less than $300,000 in his native Texas, and yet it became one the most influential films in horror: a slasher film landmark.\n\nJohn Hillerman\n\nJohn Hillerman, the actor who made a career out of playing snooty types, including Tom Selleck's fastidious estate caretaker Jonathan Quayle Higgins III on Magnum, P.I., died Nov. 9. He was 84. Hillerman, who received four Emmy nominations in consecutive years for portraying Higgins and won in 1987, died at his home in Houston, family spokeswoman Lori De Waal told the Associated Press. She said the cause of death had not been determined. His Higgins character was a natural extension of a part he played on the TV detective show Ellery Queen: Simon Brimmer, a radio personality and affected gent who fancied himself a savvy sleuth. Ironically, Hillerman, who often played condescending characters with more than a touch of the Tory Brit — the Mayfair accent — was a Texan from a tiny railroad town, the son of a gas station owner. Hillerman also appeared as Higgins on episodes of Murder, She Wrote and Simon & Simon.\n\nBob Schiller\n\nBob Schiller, the legendary sitcom writer known for his work on such shows as I Love Lucy and All in the Family, died Oct. 10.

For All in the Family, the pair penned the two-part episode \"Edith's 50th Birthday\" in which Edith (Jean Stapleton) is the victim of an attempted rape. They also wrote for such popular 1950s comedies such as Make Room for Daddy, The Bob Cummings Show, My Favorite Husband, The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour, The Ann Sothern Show and Pete and Gladys.

She was 100. One of France's best-loved actresses, Darrieux appeared in dozens of plays and more than 100 films during her long career. Generations of French moviegoers watched her mature from a precocious, fresh-faced teen into a radiant nonagenarian starring in films into her 90s. Darrieux was born on May 1, 1917, in the southwestern city of Bordeaux. Her father, an ophthalmologist, died when she was 7, and her mother supported the family by giving singing lessons. Darrieux was just 14 when she made her screen debut, with a supporting role in 1931's Le Bal. With her expressive face, liquid eyes and original, slightly nasal voice, Darrieux quickly became a favorite of French directors, appearing in films by heavyweights Claude Chabrol, Jacques Demy and Andre Techine. She starred in legendary Austrian-born director Billy Wilder's first film, Mauvaise graine, a 1934 gangster flick in French. Darrieux played the leading lady in more than a half-dozen movies by Frenchman Henri Decoin. They married in 1935 and divorced six years later.

He had been battling prostate cancer. Guillaume's penchant for playing distinguished characters resolutely defied racial stereotypes — as he did on ABC's critically acclaimed Aaron Sorkin series Sports Night, on which he played Isaac Jaffe, the managing editor of an ESPN-style news program. In 1999, Guillaume had a mild stroke while in his dressing room on the Sports Night set. \"I was fortunate in the sense that the stroke I suffered was not so debilitating that I could not move around with some degree of regularity,\" he said in a 2008 interview. \"My wife, Donna, suggested to Aaron that perhaps we could incorporate the stroke into the series and he agreed … it allowed me to come back and not pretend that I had not had a stroke.\" Guillaume's polished portrayal of the imperious family retainer Benson DuBois endured for nine years, first in three seasons on Soap (1977-80) and then on the spinoff Benson, which ran until April 1986. Both shows were created by Susan Harris.\n\nFats Domino\n\nFats Domino, the amiable rock 'n' roll pioneer whose steady, pounding piano and easy baritone helped change popular music while honoring the traditions of New Orleans, died Oct. 24. He was 89. Mark Bone, chief investigator with the Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, coroner's office, said Domino died of natural causes. In appearance, he was no Elvis Presley.
